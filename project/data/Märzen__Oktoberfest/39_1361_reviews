"I am an outlier because I prefer beers in the style of oktoberfests. This is the best oktoberfest I have had (or can remember at the moment).  It is good from the first sip until the bottle is finished.  No awkward initial tastes until the palate adjusts. This beer is worthy of the 5 i wanted to give it, but it seems like I had to justify it"
"Tasting note: cask pour into a 6 oz. short-stem flute."
"Good mar zen and a pint only cost me a $1.59"
"Medium amber (12) with off white head. Ok lacing in my SAPP.  Semi sweet fruit/Apple nose and whisper of spice. Semi sweet, lite fruit start. Lite mouthfeel and tasty tongue coating. Overall a tasty October fest Marzen."
""
"Awesome as always.  A go to brew for the ages."
"It was pretty refreshing. I think it's summery."
""
"One of the smoothest Oktoberfests I've ever had with no unpleasant aftertaste whatsoever.  Danka!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D:  Easy to drink and still flavorful but not all that in depth and sometimes watery thin.  Not my favorite in the style but you can still taste the years of tradition. Quintissential? Maybe. Decent enough for some Festivus sessions that’s for sure."
""
"Wanted to give this beer a five to be honest. Randomly picked up a 500 ml bottle and was quite impressed first by the look- beautifully golden and perfectly bubbly. Quite the perfect head. A nice little surprise."
"500 mL (16.9 fl. oz.) bottle purchased at TJ's in Fog Bot, NW D.C., unknown brewing/bottling date but sitting in my fridge for at least 2 months; poured into my Snallygaster 2014 mug; drank over 30 minutes"
"Will always revisit this one; worth trying if you haven't or if you are new to beer and want to know what the prototypical Oktoberfest bier is like.  (4.25)"

"Pours a hazy copper with little to no retention. Aroma of biscuit and yeast (in a good way). Taste of toast and caramel. Smooth, almost buttery palate... mouth feel is remarkable. The finest I’ve had yet of this style. Off to get another!"
"What can you say? Octoberfest personified."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Possibly the best Oktoberfest I've yet had. Easily ranks with my top two or three examples. This is one that I will seek out more aggressively next fest season."
"This is clearly one of the bestmarzens"

"O – A very good, flavorful, refreshing beer, made for drinking a lot of it outdoors on a cool, sunny autumn day.  No flash, just substance. Can’t go wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a big, wonderful beer that is greater than the sum of its parts. The sweet, bold malt is complemented by the mild, dry hops. Delicious!"

"Light amber in color with great clarity, nice fluffy white head and great lacing down the glass.  Aromas of honey, clean husky grains, sweet malt, floral hops and raisin.  Aromas are faint but worth the effort to pull out.  Taste is malt forward with some of that honey and a floral presence up front.  Sweetness from the malt barely kept in check by the hops floral and spicy in there own right.  Finish brings sweet malty notes and some of that raisin and fig from the nose.  Light yet chewy body costs the palet on the finish.  Overall, this is the best oktoberfest beer I've had yet. Lovely malt flavors compliment the season and stay true to the style."
""
""
"Overall:  I always say Germans make the best Oktoberfest and this is another that stands up to the phrase.  Definitely will be enjoying more of these.   It has been some time since the last one."
""
"Great Octoberfest beer.  Malt sweetness, tastes more like an ale than a lager. Good thick mouthfull with a nice head and lacing. It was great with Knockwurst and German pretzels that I went out of my way to buy to accompany it.  If you want to have a little backyard Octoberfest do yourself a favor and buy or make some German food to go with it.  Good pairing is Knockwurst, Red Cabbage, and fresh made German PRETZELS!"

"Overall - I thought it was too floral at first, but it keeps things interesting and it's extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a golden/amber color lager with a huge white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of clean cereal notes with light grainy notes. Taste is dominated by clean cereal notes with a touch of sweetness and some light grainy notes also noticeable. Body is above average for style with good carbonation. Simple and easy to drink with good balance overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!!"
""
"Again, it was okay.  if I am in the mood for an Oktoberfest, I will pick up another brand."
"Overall - wonderful, full-flavored Oktoberfest beer.  One of my two favorites of the style, along with Hacker-Pschorr.  As someone else mentioned, it's great to drink a liter and taste the changes as it warms.  Also very good in a bottle (as long as it's not too old), though draft is best."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brilliant golden hue with brilliant clarity. BA wisp of white foam barely covers half of the top of the beer.  I smell doughy,bready malt and a bit of salt.  The flavor is sourdough bread.  The mouth is smooth and crisp."
""
""
"O - Solid and classic Oktoberfest.  I would def get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended for anyone wanted to be introduced to this more than worthy style."

"Was expecting more.  Tastes more like a traditional (well made) German Lager than a Marzen.  Surprised that I like the American examples better especially since other Ayinger brews are top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the better representations of the style. I guess for good reason its an actual German Marzen."
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In summary, I just don't feel the Oktober love from this beer.  It lacks a lot of the full body/full flavor characteristics that one expects from an Oktoberfest beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Radiant orange body with a small white cap. Aromas of lager yeast, subtle spice, fruity malt. Smells true to style. Clean and easy drinking. A good Oktoberfest bier is a thing of beauty. It's that time of year. A solid German brew."
""
""
"Nicely done fest bier."
""
"O: 4.25 This beer has a lot going on for the style. Interesting and satisfying without being too heavy. Great for the transition into winter."
""
""
""
"90 (A)"
"Overall a very good marzen, one of the better ones I've had. Not my favorite style but if you're going to have it, I say go German and this is one of the better ones."
"O:  A solid beer, but Oktoberfest isn't my go-to style.  Good for what it is, though."

"big flavor-caramelized malt is pronounced, toasty, warm, creamy mouthfeel. a great fest bier. this has gotta be one of the better examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Very good"
""
""
""
"Good amount of lacing which disappears quickly. Clean and spicy smell. Caramel and honey taste with medium carbonation. Pretty smooth beer. My first real oktoberfest and I am impressed."

"A deep and satisfying German fest beer. Flavors and aroma are well-rounded and complement each other nicely. Couple that with a dynamite appearance and you have one appealing and satisfying beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""

"Medium body and low medium carbonation, creamy, clean, well balanced."

"Very good Marzen.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to others.  I only wish the ABV was a little higher because one pint bottle isn't enough."

"O- Never really got into october fest - marzen beers, so I went down to the local craft beer store for a marzen tasting and was pleasantly surprised.  I expected this beer to be heavy, yeasty, very breadlike and it wasn't.  I found it to be easy to drink and pleasant.  I definitely will start drinking more beers like this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Damn, this is a good beer and I really enjoyed it. This is what I imagine when I think ""Octoberfest"". It's just a wonderfully balanced, super flavorful malt bomb. Maybe it's most impressive quality is it's semi-sweet, bready malt nature that somehow remains very drinkable and non-cloying; delicious, liquid bread."
""
"Clear light amber pour with a hint of garnet.  Massive head with excellent lacing and retention.  The nose is sweet biscuit malt with a little caramel over a faint, almost citric, spiciness.  Nice light medium body with a slick smooth texture that approaches creamy.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a good bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is quite nice, a bit complex, and very well balanced.  The sweet malt flavors are there, but not to the extent that they are overpowering.  It begins with sweet biscuit, flows to a caramel note and then the effervescence cleans the palate and allows the complexity to escape.  The middle presents a multitude of subtle flavors - citric, dark fruit, light bitterness and spicy hops.  The smooth finish leaves you with a blend of the aforementioned flavors."

"Glad I finally got to enjoy this classic."
""
"Delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
"A very orderly beer that is uniform in it's particular (and pleasant) qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perplexing.  I only had a glass of Great Lakes Okto previous to this, so a mixed up palate doesn't seem likely.  It was very enjoyable (I had two), but will have to find a bottle to get to the bottom of this mystery..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent marten style German lager, very drinkable and true to style. Classic light amber color, generous carbonation and nice lacing. A bready, carmel, malt smell in the glass and translated directly to the palate. Medium body, malty with a very unusual hop spiciness that was almost metallic-like. Nobody makes an Octoberfest like the Barvarian's and Ayinger is right in the mix. Delish..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 3.93"
"Kicked up a huge head- frothy, thick white foam that laced the glass beautifully. Clear golden color.  Smell is bready, malty, with a hint of honey-like sweetness. Tastes just like the smell, although I get some bitterness (the German word is herb) in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly light-bodied, that I would be satisfied to roll around on my palate all day long. This one makes me feel like I'm back in Deutschland sitting in Biergarten on a lazy warm herbst (fall) afternoon. Prost BAs!"
"Notes:  fantastic!  One of the better beers I've ever had.  Definitely the best Marzen."
""
""
"Beer club Octoberfest night winner.  Smooth and Honey gold color and slightly toasted malts but easy to drink"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- One of the better oktoberfests I've had for sure.  Regardless of style though, this is slightly sweeter than I generally prefer, but for the style its definitely more balanced than some american counterparts and even some german ones.  Very good beer all around and one worth making a fall staple brew. (86/100)"
""
""
"O:  very good, better than all the American-made oktoberfests I've tried; the malt presence is fantastic, and the pinch of dirt/earth hop bitterness offers good balance"
"Cheers!"

"500 ml bottle, the beer pours a mostly clear dark gold/amber color with about an inch frothy off-white head that sticks around a while.  There's also a lot of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel and bready malt, honey, and light earthy hops.  Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of apple and dark fruit.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with moderate carbonation.  I thought this was a good Oktoberfest brew, I'd buy this again in the future.  $3.49 a bottle."
"Smooth, beautifully blended cereal grains and overtones of near licorice malt. A classic."
""
""
""
"Lots of caramel malt on the palate, but the sweetness is restrained. There's a bit of toasty grain character, and light hop bitterness picks up toward the finish. There's even some light fruit (apple, pear) notes. Having had my fair share of different Marzens, this has the most tasty and complex flavor profile of the lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty golden-amber in color with a good 3-finger foamy head that settles down to a good 2mm layer on top of the brew and more on the sides. A decent amount of lacing was seen with each sip that sticks to the side of the glass. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is mostly of sweet caramel malts for the most part. The taste even has more going on with the sweet caramel malt with some bread (yeast) with very mild hop finish with a hint of spice in the mix as well. VERY easy to drink and smooth. Medium bodied. One of the best 'Marzen / Oktoberfest' brews I have tasted as I am usually not a huge fan of this brew style. A exception here for sure! PROSIT!"
"Classic in taste"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a beautiful medium golden amber color, topping itself off with a rich creamy head, which then settled down to a 1/2 finger. Very inviting to the eye, as well to the nose. A Classic Marzen aroma, of sweet caramel malt. The taste, light bready, toasted malt with a nice hop finish. All in all, a nice full body, and the right balance of sweet and bitterness. Very enjoyable. A true Oktoberfest, that is best served in a stein, under a beer garden tent, with your friends. Prost!"

"I don't think I can appreciate this style but I thought it was an ok beer. Very bready and it was smooth. I probably won't revisit the oktoberfest style. I love ayinger but this was not nearly the best that they make. It wasn't unpleasant by any means but I didn't have a ""Wow!"" moment."

"Overall: My overall impression of the beer is positive having a full bodied taste with the right balance of sweet and bitterness. The only downside was the lack of the aroma."
""
""
""
"Overall this is in my top few for oktoberfest style, great malt flavor and full body."
""
"Had a 1 pint tall bottle that I purchased perhaps a month ago, I kept it ice cold and ready for when an amber malt craving struck. Poured a color reminiscent of dark honey, like a yellow to orange sunset with a creamy head that broke quite quickly. Aroma was marvelously fruity and spicy, with ample aromatic malt character. Taste was a layered blend of caramel and cherry fruit, floral vanilla, a darker malt note like faint molasses, and herbal hops that recall black tea. Semi-chewy body but not that much residual sweetness, just enough to balance some spice that replaces the sweet malts and fruit for the finish. The whole flavor palette integrates as you drink and yet the individual components become more salient as well. I love beers that actually reveal more of themselves as you proceed. A prime example of how complex and aromatic a well-crafted lager can be. Malt-forward but with enough fruit and spice from yeast and hops to provide balance and nuance. I am a bit of a Luddite when it comes to beer, pro-Reinheitsgebot when it comes to non-Belgian offerings and this sort of brew gives me strength."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic brew and one that I would highly recommend. Plus a cool bottle cap to boot. Would highly recommend. Look forward to trying more from Brauerei Aying."
""
""
""
"O: It's difficult to describe the best beers of specific German styles because these are the beers you base other versions of the style from. This is exactly how I expect, want, and need an Oktoberfest/Marzen to taste, smell, and satisfy. I could drink mug upon mug of this tasty stuff."
""
""
"I believe I paid only about 3.35 for this bottle- one of the cheaper offerings at my local exotic beer emporium (not quite). So, definitely a good bargain for the quality and a good try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great German marzen that really showcases the noble hops rather than malt character. Very balanced still thought with a crisp finish."
""
""
"O- Good brew. Well balanced."
"M: a bit light, and a bit over carbonated Pleasant grain."
"Overall 3.50: Not the best ""October Fest"" (as the folks at Ayinger spell it), but nonetheless, it is a pretty darn good maerzen. More subdued and slightly flavorless compared to other Oktoberfests I have had, this brew also features a slightly smaller ABV. Regardless, I do not regret picking it up and it certainly would serve to remind one of why one loves a maerzen when no other maerzen is available."
""
"The feel is full but a little slick with moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"D) It's nice to have something calm every once and a while."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer for the style, and memorable. I don't want to drag down an authentic and well crafted Oktoberfest, but I can't praise it much more than that due to its uncomplicated and not overly appealing (for my taste) nature."
""
""
"RJT"
""
""
""
"O- This is one style that usually doesn't do much for me but this beer is textbook. Its true to the style and one of the best out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Phenomenal beer for the style and great when in season. Were I in Germany for Oktoberfest, I'd easily put back several big ol' boots full of this with some soft-baked pretzels..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite styles and comparing this to some of my favorite US examples of the style I definatly get the purity law in action. There is always a distinct 'german lager flavor' I can't quite put my finger on and this has it. Extremely drinkable, flavor rich, makes me want to drink a full Liter, Prost!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious, satisfying and extremely sessionable, everything you want in an Oktoberfest-Märzen. This is a very solid German offering and probably some of the best of this style you can get in the States. Definitely pick this up when it’s out if you like this style."

"O: Solid offering. Nothing out of the world about this but there is not a single thing wrong here, each and every component is done correctly. The whole package is superbly put together in its balance and complementary nature. It is a very, very good beer that goes down well and represents a Marzen superbly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: i would not drink this beer often just because i'm not crazy about the marzen style but it's great to have during Oktoberfest season, easily the best marzen i've had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good representation of the style. The flavors are well-balanced, not overpowering in any sense, but enough is there on the initial malt and hop back to produce a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good oktoberfest! probably my favorite german offering."
"O: Outstanding, although this style lacks the complexity and intensity to achieve a very high rating. As good as any bottled märzen I can remember, and likely the best bottled example of a German Oktoberfest you'll find in the U.S."

"Light copper and clear, with a nice head of light ecru foam. Very smooth, yet not too sweet as the malt is cut by a mild, dry bitterness. A great German Festbier. If the sold this by the case at Costco like they do Sam Adams, I'd definitely stock up! Easy to drink with a complete taste."
"Overall an easy drinking octoberfest, on the lighter end of the style, but clean and crisp and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not full-bodied, as the label boasts, but it's got a hefty, rich medium body I prefer to the alternative. There's a gentle crispness all the way, as well as being smooth and creamy."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very enjoyable märzen!  Very tasty and well-balanced.  Definitely looking forward to having this beer again.  I agree with those who say that this brew sets the bar for Oktoberfest Märzens, although I personally prefer Samuel Adams' Octoberfest and Victory's Festbier."
"Taste: very creamy, light caramel notes, tea-like, a great all around lager."
""
""
""
"O - excellent example of the style. Even though it's not a true Munich brewed Oktoberfestbier, it's one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great version of the style. Great beer overall and highly drinkable."
""
""
"o: classic. if you're looking for a nice representation of an Oktoberfest this is a must try. easy drinking with great flavor. one of the beers i 'must' drink from a mug. good stuff"
"Flavor starts off with some nice candy-like caramel malt notes. Nice notes of fresh bready grain notes. There is some nice herbal and flowery hop notes mixed in there that give the brew a slight spice as well. Malty notes are delicious andn the hops give a good balance. Yummy Marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good, drinkable, but I'll probably stick with more local examples of the style to take advantage of freshness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really great oktoberfest. Maybe a little on the thinner side, but really a great late summer/early fall brew on a sunny afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"O: nice festbier. Not anything offensive, but nothing really punches you in the face. The finish dryness is kinda surprising and welcome. I like this quite a bit. Would not turn it down if offered. Would seek it out in September for fest bier choice."
""
""
"Ayinger Oktoberfest is probably the best bottled example of an Oktoberfest you'll find in the states. The malts are very complex offering many facets of the drink, while still being extremely drinkable due to a spot on carbonation level and lighter body."
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable but far from the best in the Ayinger catalog"
""
""
""
""
"I couldn't ask for anything more."
""
"Oktober Fest-Marzen pours a golden color with very little head. There is a harsh malty and sour aroma. The taste is the same rather harsh, malty, and almost a bit sour. The body and flavors are light, but that is a good thing. Overall its a below average Marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A quite nice and tasty Oktoberfest with a great blend of sweet, malty, roast, and some spice. A job well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as sweet as expected, with great malt complexity.Very clean and drinkable. The mineral notes are a bit offputting."
"O- A very nice malt forward beer with lots of malt complexity, wonderfully smooth mouthfeel, and easy to drink. It does drink a little higher than 5.8% ABV though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easily this is a top three Oktoberfest Marzen lager. This beer comes fairly close to living up to the hype. Rarest of the style in my area, but worth hunting down every year!"
"O- A very good beer, full flavored, just enough complexity to keep things interesting. This is the best example of this style I have ever had."
""
"O- On the whole, this beer isn't especially good, just decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overalll-One of the better Oktoberfests I have had. Great flavor and goes down smooth."
""
""
""
""
"All-in-all I was disapointed. I love the hefe from this brewery, I'm finding that Oktoberfest beers are hit and miss for me."
""
""
""
""
"Prosiit! Fill up the stein and drink deep on this delicious malty Marzen. Makes you want to drink many steins of this delicious brew. Tastes great and you want more. Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
""
"Overall: Very nice. More of a drier strong pale lager/helles bock/dortmunder composition as compared to some of the more commercial Oktoberfest examples, which tend to be much sweeter in my opinion."
"The most well-balanced marzen on the shelf. Take note America - THIS is how you do it. The closest American version in terms of overall quality is either Great Lakes Okt or Mektoberfest, but personally, I believe this to be the world-wide standard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I was expecting something a bit more robust since it's a German brewed Oktoberfest, but it is still a delicious brew. One I'll definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good Oktoberfest. Lots of flavor while maintaining an insanely high level of drinkability. Definitely pick up a few of these."
""
""
""
"Not exactly a sessionable beer and I wish there were more in this style. But here it its and its a good one."
""
"O - 3.75 - Good beer, great for the fall. I'd love to drink this at a hay ride or while raking leaves, but I live in Arizona. It has a light flavor that makes it easy drinking."
""

"Overall: This is an unusual marzen, and it's good, but I wouldn't call it perfectly balanced. The malt drives the beer, and the hops just don't offer much more than black tea flavor. It's worth trying but is overrated in my opinion."
"I buy one of these every year and it always hits the spot. A great example of the Oktoberfest style."
""
"In my opinion this is the industry-standard when it comes to Oktoberfest. Poors out of the bottle with a 3 inch had that lasts for about 5 to 10 minutes. The lace on the side of the glass extends throughout the drink itself. A little lighter orange amber color than other Oktoberfest but seems to have a little more pronounced mouth feel. Like all other Oktoberfest's you really start to enjoy the depth and quality of the malt as it approaches 50°. This beer, and its brothers and sister in the style, coupled with NFL football is what makes the fall season exceedingly enjoyable!"
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer, but I didn't think it was the best example of the style since the yeast and the sweetness seemed a little too dominant for this beer and I think that's pretty out of place for this style. This beer has ok drinkability, it's fairly smooth, but the flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention and one would be enough for me, this isn't the kind of beer that I would drink multiples of since I think the yeast and sweetness would really start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer is the appearance, it looked good and pretty true to style. What I liked least about this beer was the yeast and the sweetness, they seemed to dominate this beer and over power the classic Marzen flavors that are suppose to shine through. I wouldn't buy this beer again, there's many other German Marzens that I prefer more, All in all I thought this was a nice beer, but it didn't impress me since it wasn't what I was looking for in a traditional German Marzen, it just wasn't what I was expecting from the style. It's not a bad beer, but it's not a great example of the style. So far it's my least favorite German made Marzen."

"Overall: As far as Oktoberfests go (and beers in my general opinion), this is a superb specimen. Bready, yeasty, dangerously drinkable...this beer goes down smooth in quantity. I will definitely seek this out for years to come."

"500ml bottle. Pours a crystal clear golden amber wit a med to large lasting fluffy white. Aroma and taste of sweet toasted barley and grains, a bit of caramel malt, some light fruity notes. A medium bodied, crisp and refreshing on the palate, with good carbonation. The finish is sweet toasted barley and grains, fruity, light bitterness, some yeast notes. This is an all nicely balanced, crisp and refreshing Oktoberfest. Very nice."

"O - A decent representation of the style. Good flavor, just a bit on the lighter side for a Marzen. Could also be a bit past it's expiration, too. Certainly a quality brew for the $1.99 I paid. Won't rush out to grab this again, but it's certainly a beer I won't mind sampling again."

"I'm having a bottle of Ayinger Oktoberfest out of season for the second time. Not a problem - it tastes just fine, even in June.This orange-gold brew looks great and has good head. Smells apple sweet. From what I've been reading in other reviews, the yeast is part of what lends the aroma. The flavor has great malty texture, the hops lend a mild spiciness, but the yeast again gives it some fruit. Exceedingly pleasant to drink, a great member of the family of Bavarian lagers."

"I tried this one because it claims to be somewhat of an official Oktoberfest beer and I would love to go to Oktoberfest one day. It certainly did not disappoint. For an Oktoberfest lager, it was sweeter than I expected it to be. It beat 90% of the lagers that I have had to date and the sweetness actually made it a little better."
""

"This is the best Oktoberfest in the game. Absolutely beautifully crafted. Great amber color, caramelized malt note, and subtle sweetness. this one absolutely nails it. Buy one to know what they should all be judged by!"

"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours a burnt yellow colour. The nose on this is just amazing--so complex and inviting. It's nutty, fruity and brimming with so many great malt notes. Taste-wise it's equally complex. It's slightly sweet, but has a nice robustness with a delicious spicy finish. The best of this style we've had, it's perfect for hearty holiday meals."
""
"overall, typical ayinger.... commercial, but very nice tasting and average 5- 5.8% abv. except for the celebrator, of course. great session beers, normally. straight 80's in my opinion..."
"O: Not bad at all. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
""
"Overall - Decent flavor profile but, as with most Ayinger brews, a wonderful mouthfeel. There are a handful of Oktoberfest brews I'd opt for over this one, but it's not a bad choice if options are limited."
"Overall: A decent Oktoberfestbier. There are others that I like better, but this one certainly will get purchased again in the future."

"Bottle into a pint glass. Nice copper pour with off white 2 finger pillow head with some active carbonation. Nice smell of marzen spices, nutmeg and some bready notes. Taste follows the nose with a nice crisp balance of malts, spices and mellow hops. Easy drinking/sessionable marzen. Perhaps some carmel on the end as it fades to earthy hops. Feel is middle of the road, but more active on the carbonation end, which was nice. Overall- A pretty impressive, balanced marzen. Liked the blend of spice, malts and subtle hops. A very solid effort and pretty true to the form from the German end. Nothing outstanding, but very drinkable and perfect for a fall evening. Will be hitting another soon-"
"An excellent märzen."
""
""

"O: Easy to drink, sessionable, and enjoyable - pairs nicely with a burger and fries. Definitely one of the better German offerings in the style that is easy to find in the US."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is excellent- medium body, moderate to full carbonation, SLIGHTLY chewy but really very refreshing and smooth. Exceptional marzen- definitely the best one that I have had thus far (i've been coming back to it all season and finally decided to review)."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Nice head with some lacing. Color is golden amber. The smell is a mix of the malty grains and floral hops. But the real reason we drink is the taste. This is the bench mark of all Oktoberfest beers. Fresh clean taste of the roasted malts leaving it slightly sweet. There is a light hop finish. This is a very drinkable beer, but hard to have just one. Great with a soft pretzel or bratwurst with kraut."
""
"Overall (4.5): As stated before I can only compare Ayinger's Oktoberfest to Paulaner's. Where Paulaners keeps their price-point down, and the taste is certainly one of my favorites, Ayinger seems to capture the essence of Oktoberfest. It's my favorite but I'm not sure I can afford more than two or three 500ml bottles a season."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice initial appearance including a nice head. Nose of sweet and nutty components. Light in body, but sweet and malty flavor. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"O:  After exploring many Oktoberfest beers this year I can say this is one of the top I have tried. The body is not overly thick compared to the aroma but it packs great flavors that are nice and filling.  This is Oktoberfest that I will have every year. "
"Overall this isnt a bad beer by any means and the price is unbeatable. I think I paid around $3 for this one, WELL worth it."
""
""
""
""
"A very satisfying malty, slightly citrusy beer. As so many German beers are, the look (head and color) is superb. So easy to drink, so refreshing, and always consistent. This beer could be enjoyed, in the words of Usain Bolt, ""all day, every day."""

""
""

""

"O - Sadly I cannot get behind this one. I have yet to find a beer from Ayinger that I would not have again, and this makes the first. Average across the board, lacking that certain something special the other beers contain."
""
"Overall, It's a good Oktoberfest, but I am comparing it to all other German Oktoberfests. And it's just not my favorite."
"Pours a golden orange color with a finger width head, some lacing and chunky remainder. Smell is a little biscuity with some caramel. Taste is again biscuity with slight apple undertones. Lots of bubbles feel quite nice, but it's got a fuller body than I like with my lagers. Overall, I think it's a really solid beer. A noteworthy brew in the Marzen style."
"I think more on the ""drink of bunch"" of side than ""contemplate the flavors"" side. Still good, just think others have surpassed it."
""
""
"O-Ayinger does many things well and unique to their brewery...disappointingly so their oktoberfest is not one of them"
""
""
""
""

"O: This is just a great beer that can be drunk in excess (and is!). I want to combine the taste of this with the mouthfeel of Paulaner's marzen. It vould be the greatest beer in all ze vorld!"
"this is a wonderful for the price, just under 3 bucks for a 500ml bottle. it has a great nose on it, perfect for the seasonal change now occuring. lots of german malts, caramunich and pale flavors, but it must be more complex than that. there is also the classic marzen yeast aroma that is pungent and strong. the flavor is malt driven, but in reasonable balance for the style. there is some bittering hops throughout, and a very organic feel to this one. wheat malt profile in the flavor, although i doubt its presence. the finish is cleaner than expected as well, and the mouthfeel overall is pleasing. great carbonation and a medium body. it is enough to take the cold edge out of a fall evening. ill buy this again this season, especially for the price. this is a very authentic product, true to style, bold and flavorful. very drinkable. well done."
""
"As far as I am concerned, this beer sets the standard in the Märzen style. Do try others, but accept no substitutes."
"O: Definitely one of the best Marzens out there and a staple for the style. Very enjoyable and it shows that a Marzen can be both clean and complex."
""
"This was good. I liked how it kept the focus here on those crisp hops, yet still left room for plenty of flavor from those malts as well and the overall drinkability of this was top notch. I could knock back bottles of this all during the O-Fest season."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely on the sweeter side, this Marzen is incredibly drinkable. I can see why Germans and tourists alike pound back liters of this stuff this time of year."
"Light and sweet and delicious. I mean just what you want in an oktoberfest... Easy to drink. Amazingly flavorful and not too bitter so you can knock em' back as it was intended. Great beer that is just fun to have."

"This one's a winner. One of the better Okt's on the market. Puts most any stater to shame."
"Not a beer to remember. I have had better marzens."
"An excellent and well-executed Fest Beer that represents what these things are SUPPOSED to taste like. No watered-down malt flavors and no excessive hops. Just bread in a bottle. A classic beer that will accompany any dish from chicken or burgers to pizza or pasta. I think this is the best Oktoberfest I've had."
""
"O-A nice O-fest lager that suffers from a strange flavor in the finish (maybe my batch was a bit old/oxidized?). It compares well against its competition, but is not going to set the world afire. If you want a drinkable brew this fall for a mild (not hot/not cool) afternoon, here you go."
""
"Overall, one of my favorite Oktoberfests. My one complaint is that the aroma and flavor is a little too subdued. That aside, the drinkability is incredible and I could easily put back lots of this in a sitting."
""
""
"Crystal clear deep yellow. Excellent lacing. Big sweet cereal malt notes. Insanely crisp finish.  Great oktoberfest."
""
"O: This is good stuff, I could easily knock these back all night to celebrate the season. Of the Okto brews I've had, this is definitely one of the better ones, if not the best."
""
""
""
"This is by no means a bad beer. It does however have some qualities that I don't care fore: musty, metallic, warm. On its face it's a solid Oktoberfest, but the off-putting subtleties ruin it for me. I probably won't buy this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- superbly drinkable"
""
""
"Smells and tastes like a toasted whole wheat bagel, with medium levels of pecan, hazelnuts, and light fruity apple esters floating around in the background. Earthy and herbal hopping garnishes appear along with a touch of chamomile tea as the glass warms up. Very clean flavor profile overall."

""
"A nice Octoberfest. Quite drinkable. I found this one in a 16oz single but I'd certainly buy a sixer of it."

"Overall, you could do a lot worse for Oktoberfest, but you could also do a lot better."

"The Germans make this type of beer to appeal to the American market. I've found German amber fest beers to be lacking. They truly shine with their blond fest biers (see Hofbrau and Traunstein)"
""
""
""
""
""
"500ml bottle, been trying to move through some German beers lately so I can educate myself. nice orange-amber color, good foamy head. Smells like lager, eh. Flavor is just a real lager, grain, type of event. Shit was good but nothing stellar. I could probably knock back a couple liter of this and pass out on a picnic table. Nein!"
""
""
"O – This is a really good Oktoberfest. It’s full of excellent German malt flavors and aromas and has the perfect ABV for a fest beer – not so little that you have to be drinking all day to feel anything but not so little that you’re one and done. I wish the head retention was a little better and there was a bit less carbonation for the sake of the flavor and mouthfeel, but this is a great beer. I’m so glad it’s getting to be fall. Even if I do live in Charleston and it’s still 90 degrees, I’m gonna drink some fall beers, dammit."
"Overall- A tasty oktoberfest style brew. Very drinkable and very enjoyable."

"This was really nice oktoberfest, nice balanced flavor and refreshing."

""

"Pours a dark, super clear and lustrous bronzy whiskey-ish yellow. Nose is hidden, some tones of alcohol, and an oddly new car like vibe. Taste is light toasted grain, and light malt and some light sweetness. Mid to low on bitterness. Mouth-feel is wet, refreshing, carbonation is high and scrubbing, with a creamy, but not oocky finish. Really liked this too, my first marzen, and came with a very spiffy bottle cap that will look terrific with our other frig-mag caps. Would have again."
""
""
"This is medium bodied with nice crisp carbonation. Delicious."

""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not as good as I was expecting, but still an above average brew. Some good grassy/grainy flavours here that suit the fall/Oktoberfest season well."
""
""
""
"Wow very good. Rich mouthfeel yet creamy and smooth. Toasted grain up front followed by caramel and finishes with a refreshing spicy hop bite. Bit of detectable tin throughout and waters down a bit on the finish. Otherwise though an amazing oktoberfest beer!"
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a light to medium orange amber with a thin head and little lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and wheat. Very mild, sweet caramel malt and wheat flavor, much like the aroma, but surprisingly subdued. Pleasant, but light flavored. Caramel malt improved with warming. Nothing outstanding, but nice light refreshing Octoberfest beer."
"O - Brewed perfectly for what it's meant for; sheer drinkability. Ayinger's Oktober Fest-Märzen is a world-class beer that's incredibly well done and as close to the epitome of an oktoberfest as possible. A malt-lover's dream, this is devoid of hop flavor and bitterness, letting the deep maltiness really shine."

"I had several of these on tap during Octoberfest event. Out of 10 or so Octoberfest brews this one stood above. The appearance was darker brown but clear with a beautiful head, Smell was of sweet roasted malts and bread, very pleasant. Taste was sweet and roasted not much hops but very very smooth. Mouthfeel is medium to light, you can drink several to many at a time if you are in the mood (and at an octoberfest event you should be in the mood). Fresh on tap was memorable and look forward to it every fall."

"The Okatoberfest Märzen, with its beautiful brown color and malt aroma, is one of my favorite German style beers. There is little head and little head retention, but the head is certainly thicker than that of a pilsner or lager. There is perhaps a hint of a hops aroma. The taste is more malt sweetness than it is hops. The flavor is quite balanced with a leaning toward sweet. The mouth feel consists of little alcohol heat and little carbonation. The finish is quite smooth due to the balance between the malt sweetness and hop bitterness."
""
"M/O: Quaffable, more complex than a regular pale lager or even Oktoberfest beers made here. A classic."
""
""
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big bready malts, caramel, herbal spiciness, toasted malt, and light apricot fruitiness. Classic Oktoberfest aromas, very nice stuff. Taste of caramel, toffee, biscuit, herbal spiciness, toasted malt, and light fruitiness. No bitterness present; with lingering notes of caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, and herbal spices on the finish for a bit. Great flavor balance and maltiness; with absolutely no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any noticed at all. Extremely drinkable and smooth as expected for the style. Overall this is a great Oktoberfest and one of the best I have had yet. Great balance and great malt flavor."

"Finally found this one. Still looking for a great octoberfest beer. Pours a wonderfully clear pale amber with a huge and persistent head. Smell is light. Floral. Taste is huge malt for such a light beer. Herbal and grasy with some vanilla. Creamy almost. Fantastic. I think the heavy malt may put some off. It I love it."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a very light copper color, that's crystal clear. A large white foamy head sits on top. Dissipates to a thin layer, minimal random lacing. The beer smells of sweet caramel and roasted malts. Tastes like an Oktoberfest should: sweet caramel overtone, roasted malts, a smooth finish. The mouthfeel is light and slightly carbonated. Overall, a nice Marzen. I'll try this next year to see if it changes like some of the American Oktoberfests do."
""
""
"Nice body that goes down smooth with a little tingle from the carbonation on the tongue."
"Golden yellow in color with a heavy orange hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a rocky off-white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Earthy toasted malt aroma with hints sweet biscuit. Smooth, delicate feel with lazy, rich, tight carbonation. Toasted and bready malt flavors throughout. Tangy carbonation through the middle introduces light herbal hop flavors. Finished crisply, with a lingering toasted malt character."

"Light, almost watery beer, but doesn't bothers you palate, you don't get used to it. Excellent beer. Truly an exceptional oktober marzen bier!!"
"This is a pretty good representative for Oktoberfest beers."
"Body-Light to medium weight, heavy crisp effervescence that has nice lasting qualities, kind of frothy and a little bit creamy, a hint of dry in the finish. Flavor intensity matches the body, sweet sour and bitter are all balanced pretty well just nothing too complex. Love it, great Oktoberfest style, also easy to drink while still being a great example."
"Overall an Oktoberfest that is super light in body and flavor. Although a tasty brew it could have used a little more of both."
"O: very nice oktoberfest beer. Drinkable, $4 for a 500ml bottle. Overall, it's well put together."
"overall - not a bad brew, has some good flavor profile to it, could be a fun session beer if you're in the mood"
"What's so great about this Marzen? It's nearly perfect in what we should expect from the classic style. Of course, it's not perfect, it's just amazingly available, high quality, and traditional."
"O: Solid beer, like it quite a bit in a style that doesn't often do it for me."
"All that said this one is very drinkable. It is going to be a malt heads go to beer in many cases, but I don't see why this is a fall seasonal nor am I impressed. just another ok beer that's lost among the crowd."
"For an Oktoberfest it is definitely in a league of its own. I haven't had an American one quite like this at all. Its does have that same European beer taste for lack of a better term but this one takes it up a notch with the hops and the way the balance the beer as a whole. You can tell in the smell theres something different about this one. One of my favorite Oktoberfests definitely the best I've had this year."
"A very good Oktoberfest that I enjoyed very much. It's a very flavorful example of the style."
"I'm a real fan of this oktoberfest. One of my favorite oktoberfest beers. Well balanced and brings everything that an oktoberfest beer should"
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker pint. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, and spices. The flavor was of sweet matl, wheat, grain, biscuit, subtle fruit, floral, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. My impression of this one was the aroma was lacking, but the flavor had potential. There were a lot of flavors I had never picked up on before going on in this one which was a nice change-up from the normal brews from this style. The aroma was just plain and simply lacking in complexity. Worth trying for a fan of the style, but that is about it."
"Gotta get a bunch more before the season's over. Can't beat the German beer price either!"
"Taste is pretty much in the lager/pilsner realm, light and easy drinking, just a touch more in the mouthfeel. Again there's a little malt, and maybe a whisper of the cocoa butter I sometimes pickup from Marzens. But honestly, in a blind taste testing I'd probably rank this higher than a BMC but not by much, and I guess I expected so much more."
"Poured this Marzen from a bottle into a pint glass.This ale poured a hazy orangish amber color, it produced a very nice thick white head and had excellent retention. The aroma of this Oktoberfest was full of caramel, fresh sourdough and slightly sweet. The ale is medium in body, very nice mouthfeel. The taste had a nice bready backbone, toasted malt. There is a nice sweet caramel, toffee flavor that is balanced nicely by earthy hops. The finish is slightly dry. This is the best Oktoberfest that I have tried. This will be the one that I measure all others against. Excellent beer from an excellent German Brewery. Prost!"
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a nice balance of earthy hops, sweet malt and mild spiciness.  Grassy, earthy hops up front which are floral and only slightly dry/bitter followed by cinnamon and brown sugar over a prominent malt backbone.  Lots of sweet caramel with hints of pumpkin, toast, nut and biscuit.  Really well balanced and very quaffable.  Nice example of the style.  "
"O: Good representation of the style. Easy to drink."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is easy drinking with a crisp finish. However, I found this one to be just a little too sweet to be able to sit down and enjoy more than one. The alcohol is completely hidden under this brews residual sweetness."
"O: Marzen on ""juice"" looks like a marzen and drinks like a bock. not as easy drinking as HB or Spaten or any domestic marzen, but certainly much more complex. Huge flavor profile for style. Don't know if my oktoberfest would last all day if I was drinking this alone."
"O: Just a world class Marzen, my favorite to date."
"Excellent brew."
"Overall- It is a good Oktoberfest when you get down to drinking, there was some apprehension when it was first brought to the table, but it drinks well. A nice herbal mix that really works."
"Not a great beer, but a very respectable beer. If there are any bottles of this left when I'm next at TJ's I'm going to pick them up."
"Overall this is one of the better oktoberfests that I have had, and this isn't a style I normally get hard over. Will definitely seek this out again."
"This is a good example of a marzen. Not the most flavorful one, but it does what it does very well and is an easy drink."
"Granted, these beers have no (obvious) date on the bottles, so you could pick up an old one and not be any the wiser until you drink it. Solution: buy from a store with high turnover."
"O - I haven't had too many Marzens that I like but I really dig this one. The flavors are lot more complex and distinguishable throughout. They seem more natural than some of the American versions Ive tasted."
"Very nice, very enjoyable, spot on. Must be one of the best Octoberfest beers I have had."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. One of the better Octoberfest beers on the market. Give it a shot."
"O: This is a very nice and refreshing lager that represents the märzen style well. Simple and traditional, try this one if you really want to know what a German oktoberfest beer is supposed to be"
"This beer also features the coolest crown I've ever seen!"
"Overall, it is an easy-going beer with a lot of character; perfect for a Fall day."
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a honey-golden yellow coloring that pours with a ton of white, foamy, frothy head. The head initially stacks up fast while you pour, but it settles into a two inch layer with great endurance. The beer's nose is heavy with toasted grains and rich malt sweetness, and some light spicing throughout. Flavors have a rich, honey and sugary sweet malt profile, with light toasted cereal flavors in the background. The flavors are very light and crisp, with a smooth and round body. Great cling slong the glass while you drink. The aftertaste is light, but a slight sweetness does linger behind. This is a very clean brew. The finish is quick and slick. Very easy to drink, and very tasty while avoiding the overpowering and cloying sweetness that some Marzens carry. Impressive."
"Decent stuff, not mindblowing. Picked it up for only 1.99, at that price, I'd check it out again."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a large white head. The aroma is heavy on the nutty and toffee malts with a little bit of grass thrown in from the hops. The flavor is is full of toffee, caramel and biscuit malts. There are some nice floral hop notes in the flavor as well which really add to the flavor profile. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very easy to drink and one of the best German-brewed märzens out there."
"tasty beers always a good thing and this is no exception, nice beer for this chilly fall evening"
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer and in my limited experience with marzens(and German lagers in general)this stands out as one of my favorites."
"An excellent malty aroma was present during the pour and lingered thoughout the pint. Decent fizz but not overpowering. Sweet malt is the main flavor but with a hint of hops to make it a wonderfully smooth beer. A great beer, its a shame I only had one to try!"
"Prost!"
"Verdict: Pretty delicious Oktoberfest beer, its a bit bolder and more intricate than most lagers that goes down easily and bridges the gap well between summer and fall."
"Overall: This one gets better with every sip. May be one of the best Oktoberfests out there."
"I don't actually know what it looked like because I had it poured in a cinema that was very dark. No head, though, I know that. It smelled distinctly of apple juice. Not like green apples, just regular, sweet apple juice. The taste was somewhat sweet as well, but also biscuity. It had very much a taste of both bread and still some of that apple juice that dominated the smell. It sounds like a terrible combination. But actually, it was fairly appealing to me. Biscuity and sweet. Delicious."
"Overall: A totally legit session Oktoberfest. I really don't like Oktoberfest/Marzens to tell you the truth. This is probably the only one that I've had so far that I will drink again. When you drink a brew like this one, you understand why there is an entire tradition that surrounds the Marzen style. I could drink this one for days. If you rate to style, rating should be higher. I'm grading this one overall, because the best Marzen I've had fails in comparison to the best DIPA or Wee Heavy I've had."
"A first-class, festive, malt-forward brew with a lingering sweet taste. Can't go wrong here."
"This one nailed the mark; obviously a classic, but nice to try among many other recent Oktoberfests - definitely the standout. If you want to experience the style this is where to go!"
"I love the fall !!!"
"O) Top notch Oktoberfest right here. A great session beer for the fall. I paired it with cheddar cheese, crackers, and playoff baseball. Perfect..."
"D/O In a style that is prepared to be very drinkable, this one is no exception. 4.0"
"O - Very good oktoberfest beer. I highly recommend it."
"O: Maybe Marzen's just aren't my cup. I know Ayinger makes some world class stuff, but this fell pretty flat compared to some of their other offerings. A good beer, but not a great one."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a clear light copper color aith a slight bone white head. Sweet, bready nose with some caramel. Medium mouthfee. Sweet start with a nice malty backbone. Biscuity. Honey. Medium mouthfeel. Ever so slight bitterness built in. Pretty nice. Some lace."
"A really good marzen, but a little on the lighter side for me."
"O: Really nice O-fest and more than worthy, in a very competitive style."
"O: I like it. One of the better Marzens I've had. Balanced flavor, not too sweet or too bitter."
"Great example of the style, really smooth and drinkable."
"Overall- I'll be honest, the style I dislike the most is any kind of lager so don't mind a somewhat poor review. If you enjoy lagers you will probably love this beer. I don't regret trying this beer, it wasn't bad, but I would not buy it again. Ayinger makes some great brews and if you like them, buy if you can find it."
"O- I gave this 4s across the board and a 4.5 overall. This doesn't stand out in any one aspect, but is a very good, widely available, German brewed Oktoberfest. One of the better of the style I've had. It also happens to have one of the cooler caps around for those of us who are into that. Thanks to titosupertramp for nabbing two of these for me."
"T: Lots of bready malts. A bit of nuttiness and some faint hop resin on the finish. Very drinkable and one of the better ones in this style."
"Pretty good marzen style, probably the best I have had so far but i have many more to try this fall. Nice bready' smell not overwhelming. The color pretty much sets the scene for the fall time. slightly creamy and taste is right on for the style, very slight spice towards the end but nothing to powering it is very light spice, also slightly dry with a hint of caramel throughout. overall very good and will pick up again."
"Pours an orangish clear color with a lot of visible carbonation. There is a two finger head which gives way to skim and leaves some rings of lace. The aroma is of breadiness and caramel malts. There is a hint of green fruits at the end. The taste follows suit with the bulk being biscuits and bread. There is also a roastiness to it. At the backend there is a sweet green fruit taste. The mouthfeel is well carbonated. Overall this is a good beer, it is one of the easiest drinks you will ever have."
"Overall: A very good version of a Marzen. Nice combination of malts and yeast."
"The only thing that I wish is that I could find more Oktoberfest beers like this that are more affordable. Another solid beer from this brewery."
"This is a very tasty marzen that get’s my award for the most drinkable of this style that I have had to date. It is not as rich or exciting as some others, especially those brewed in America, but it goes down so easy. I could surely tip back two or three liters of this at an Oktoberfest celebration."
"This poured a nice amber color with a good amount of white head. This had a nice toasted malt flavor to it. This was probably my favorite of the German Oktoberfest lagers I've tried this year. It had a nice richness of flavor and good balance of alcohol. So far it's tops of the German Marzen list for me."
"Better hopped than most marzens, this still has a wonderfully round body with a solid dry caramel malt flavor. Rich body that belies the lager monicker. The swallow is mildly bitter, but the aftertaste lasts well."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper body with a white head with decent retention and lacing properties. The aromas are more subdued than those of comparable quality oktoberfests, such as Spaten, but every bit as complex and seductive. I smell a lot of toastiness and earthiness at first, and then pick up delicious notes of spicy apple sauce and sliced peaches. The taste is very toasty and bready up front, with lots of earthiness and pie crust on the mid-palate, with hints of autumn spices and fruits adding yet another layer on the finish. One of of my favorite German-made oktoberfests."
"Notes:  exceptional beer."
"O - This one is great!! I think what make this beer so good is the combo of subtle hops, fruity-flavor, pine/spice, carbonation, and last but not least, alcohol level). VERY refreshing and will get again and...…Goin’ to look for a tap ASAP!!!"
"Clear medium body multiple streams of quickly rising carbonation, medium pour resulted in a mere finger and a half (my bad) pure white head over deep gold body, good sized layer of head retained, not much lacing. Caramel and vienna notes dominate the nose, really clean. Taste features the caramel notes up front, with very little hops. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, medium effervescence, pretty dry finish. While it isn't my favorite style, IMHO this is a very well made beer and certainly one of the world's best Oktoberfests. Recommended"
"This is the second time I have had Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen and I guess the second time was a charm. The first time I had it I was underwhelmed, but I thought Ayinger deserved another chance considering I loved the other offerings I have had from them and this time they delivered. A very solid, crisp drinkable Oktoberfest."
"Wunderbar! One day I will travel to the motherland to taste all the wonderful brews, and only then will I know how this sizes up."
"Pours a nice golden color with a good white head with decent retention. The smell is good and malty, some bread and toffee along with a little floral hops. The feel is medium to light with good carbinonation. The taste is pretty good also, some rich maltiness, bread and toffee, there is just a hint of hop bite, but not much. Overall a pretty tasty Oktoberfest beer."
"o: Based on other reviews, I'd say I didn't get a fresh bottle. Thanks for thinking of me Lub, but this is why I don't buy freshness critical beer from brewers who don't date their products."
"Damn, this bottle has to have the loveliest cap of all time! Regardless, it pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, light grass, light rye bread, cabbage, light mandarin orange, and a decent amount of straight, bready yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is slightly sweeter, the rye bread is toastier, and some black pepper and cinnamon find their ways in as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a mostly solid O-Fest, but one that doesn't really stand out from the crowd in any appreciable manner. It rises above the light cabbage character, but it doesn't soar. Still not bad, though, especially for the price..."
"Poured this 500 ml bottle into a snifter. Pours a golden yellow will a nice amount of white head and crisp carbonation. Smell is light and airy. Taste it a little bland on my end, i have tried a few other octoberfest beers and this one for me falls a little short. I will admit that i am a bit new to the style, but having came from a love of IPA's, maybe that has skewed my pallet. I do like that it is brewed with the purity laws but there just isent enough umph to this brew. I will say that this is a great sessionable brew."
"The feel is creamy, silky, and smooth, with a nice vibrancy to the carbonation. This is clearly fresh, and as a result, the beer displays a remarkable balance. Once of the best of the style that I have enjoyed."
"Pours a clear light copper orange with a huge 3 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a craggy cap. A nice latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of biscuit-like malt, honey, and some caramel notes. Taste is of biscuit-like malt, caramel, honey, and some mild hop flavors. There is a very mild grainy bitterness on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good easy drinking beer that is probably my favorite of all beers in this style I have tried. I could easily put down lots of this one at an Oktoberfest celebration."
"I've always been enamoured with Celebrator so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this is one of the better Oktoberfests in the world. Perfect beer for the season."
"It pours a caramel-straw color with some foam and head retention. Tight lacing. It’s sweet, but not overly so. There’s no hop profile to speak of, consistent with the style, but the hops there provide a nice spice and balance to the malty flavor of the beer. It’s refreshing, in a way, starting out crisp with a some caramel on a subdued, sweet finish that I think of as characteristically marzen. The flavors hold up as it warms. Really, a terrific beer. One of my favorites and real treat for the season."
"Up front Biscuity malt, slight sweetness and then bite from the carbonation and slight hop profile and faint yeast in the finish. Refreshing to say the least. I didnt look at the grade on this before I did this review, but I would say it would have to rank in the top ten for the style."
"I was excited to find this beer at Midtown Wine & Sprits (Nashville, TN) and immediately grabbed one. I enjoy the Octoberfest beers and have typically had American versions in the past. The beer is quite bubbly and pours with a small off-white head. The color of the beer is golden tan. Taste? The taste was great, it felt like a true Octoberfest and I'd gladly have this over American versions. It was malty and had a unique biscuit flavor. A little sweet, but the finish was very smooth...very easy drinking beer. I'm hoping to grab a few for the fridge before they vanish for the season. Also, this beer has one of the most awesome caps, if you collect beer caps."
"Oktoberfest is not my favorite style, but this is a very nice, malt-forward beverage. Quite good, but I would expect no less from Ayinger."
"Another selection at the 2011 Choctaw Oktoberfest. It went great with the smoked bratwurst and grilled knackwurst. Cleanly malty with the typical bread crust, biscuit, and barley husk character of Munich-type malts. Light on the caramel character, which in my mind is the better way to brew this style. Hops run about even with the malt lending plenty of spiciness to balance. It manages to capture the dry yet malty palate that separates the best of the style. Another well-done beer from Brauerei Aying."
"O: Good representation of the style. Easy to drink. Easily sessionable."
"D: This drinks quite nicely, I really love this beer."
"Overall, I think its decent. I personally would like a lot more malt in there. Also the metallic taste in there really kills it. Had better oktoberfest beers for sure."
"I'll spare one the formalities. This beer is Awesome. I've been meaning to try one of the Ayinger brands since they've come into this market or when I've been traveling but the opportunity hadn't presented itself. I'm a fan of Marzen beers but this one is quit different. Slightly lighter in color and flavor than the traditional exports I've had, and I've had most of them, this one I could drink all day. A very pretty beer. Not for the spice and pumpkin crowd, but if you enjoy traditional German fare, this one is a must."
"Overall, I'd drink this again. I am starting to see a pattern in german beers, and I think I like it. It's a refreshing change from all of the new beers that American breweries have been churning out lately. Tradition is often good. It is in this case."
"Taste - Sweet and bready malt with slight hit of bitterness on the finish."
"O. While there's nothing outstanding about this beer there's nothing wrong with it either. It's a very good, well made example of the style. Not every beer has to blow my socks off - most of the time I'm looking for something that's just plain good, and this fits the bill perfectly."
"Overall very impressive would have any time."
"Overall: This is a decent example of a German Oktober Fest brew."
"The mouthfeel steps it up slightly with a solid carbonation. The strong fizz brightens the lazy malt bill and keeps it worth drinking. All in all just an average brew."
"I could drink this all day long. This is one of my favorite Märzen/Oktoberfest biers; nothing flashy, just rock-solid good. Really puts me in the mood for fall and I want another one immediately. Prost!"
"Oh, to be in Munich for Oktoberfest and holding a liter of this in a mug! Tasty, balanced and easy drinking, this is a must-have fall beer."
"This is one outstanding beer. I thought nothing could dethrone Great Lakes Oktoberfest, but at least it lost to a German brewery."
"Reviewed on: 09-14-2009 18:48:42"
"After reading all of the positive things about this beer, I have to wonder what I am missing. This is an average beer overall at best and that's not even to speak for its ranks in the style. Lacks in so many areas that I can't believe the overall rating that it holds. I won't be reaching for this one again."
"Overall / Drinkability: A solidly good Marzen beer. I suspect this would be much better with food but by itself it's quite nice. Definitely better when warm than cold, but hey, that's on purpose isn't it?"
"Surprisingly average given the hype. Maybe I am just not a huge fan of this style or of Brauerei Aying. Similar to Sam Adams Octoberfest other than the distinctive yeast profile. Good, but not special. Strong caramel malt, hardly any hop character, slightly bitter finish. Standard Oktoberfest appearance and mouthfeel."
"O- Very good brew, perfect way to welcome fall. Everything is well balanced and finishes clean. The earthy notes are impressive, feels like drinking the fall season."
"O- a tasty marzen and one i recommend"
"Awesomely delcious."
"VERY GOOD, SEEK THIS OUT!"
"Overall: I must admit that I am drinking this a little out of season. The aromas and taste bring me to the cool fall months. Nice and mild, nothing too crazy. Not a bad brew by any means."
"O - This is a solid lager. It was very refreshing at the end of a rough day."
"The drinkability of this brew is great. Its has some great flavors. A great Märzen/Oktoberfest, that was refreshing, but a little different then its fellow brews in the style. I will have to seek out more brews from this German brewery."
"Very prickly and drinkable. Very good ""Wiesenbier""."
"D: Again I would like a properly cellered version of this to try, but as it I would be able to drink two or three of these. Feels like it would be a good late summer/early fall beer."
"Pours a light clear golden with a full white head that is gone rather quickly leaving behind no lacing to speak of. This has a fairly significant amount of grass and lemon aromas to it fresh after the pour. As it sits for a short spell, it takes on a nice sweet honey aroma and rich caramel malts. Rather mild on the palatte, but yet not short of complexity. Hay and citrus fruits are first noticeable and are quickly followed with honey. the finish is a little short and light."
"Truth be told, I'm not a big Oktoberfest beer fan. I apologize. Still, this is a damn good Oktberfest."
"D: Pretty darn good beer, sweet, but not syrupy. Spices are integrated well. Fine example of the style."
"Cheers"
"Its slightly over carbonated out of the bottle but if your at Oktoberfest chugging away this will be a great beer to have all day."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimple glass. One of my top rated Oktoberfests. Poured an amber thick creamy white head. Rich nose of toasted toffee bread rides undercurrents of sweet nutty grains. Well balanced toasty caramel notes round to a light hop finish. Medium bodied, light carbonation, dry malt finish."
"Overall - Is it a Marzen or a Festival Lager? Are they the same? Who cares what style its defined as this is a great Bavarian beer and everyone regardless of being a craft beer snob or an usual American adjunct bozo should enjoy this one!!!!"
"D: Carbonation makes this a bit of a slow drinker; sweetness grows on me over time to slow things down a bit too."
"D- They need to make this in 6 packs and available year round. I will pick this up again."
"Wow, one of the lagers that has really impressed me. This is a legitimate Oktoberfest ladies and gentlemen, I highly recommend this."
"Pours an orange/amber with a two finger pearl white head. Quickly dissipated, but lacing remained solid. Aroma of honey sweetness and caramel notes. Taste begins with more of the same. Sweet blast of honey and caramel, followed by a bit of fruit in the middle and a big tosted grain finish. Good flavor combination. Light mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable!"
"D: One of my first German Marzens... Very nice, good and complex flavor with a good ABV... Worth looking for..."
"The nose detects the cloying subtleness of honey and apple; the palate succumbs to sweet caramel balanced with toasty malt that provides the necessary warm finish. A wonderful expression of a much maligned style. Prosit!"
"D - Delicious example of this style. Could easily enjoy several of these in an afternoon, especially with grilled brats and sauerkraut."
"This will be my last Oktoberfest of 2010. I feel like I ended on a good one. I can see myself coming back to this one."
"Toward the lighter end of the style's color spectrum - straddling amber-copper, this pours with a head at the start, but it had a previous engagement apparently, disappearing quick. Straight-forward, sweet malt aroma, in-line style-wise, clean with some surprising noble hop presence - real distant - a bit floral and oxidized. As it warms up, alcohol becomes more apparent. The flavor boasts some roasted nut and caramel aspects - strange for the style, so I've read. The malt profile is clean and has a light-moderate toasted angle to it, however, it finishes with a thin vegetable essence. A lively-enough level of carbonation washes much of that away in the end. Not too shabby, this Ayinger - I'd certainly try drinking it with some German cuisine when I can. Some of those perceived off-flavors, though, while not ruining this, will surely steer me toward other examples of the style 4 out of 5 times."
"Mouthfeel is thin and surprisingly thirst quenching. This enhances its drinkability. Carbonation is tingly and pleasant. Drinkability is high, as this was designed for mass consumption. Overall a very good fest beer."
"D - has a savory quality that could possibly deter one from drinking several steins. but it is fresh, it is clean, it is a good sessionable beer, although with a quality that will prevent you from stuffing too many into your GI."
"I think this is my favorite German Oktoberfest. I wish I could get more Ayinger, they have yet to disappoint me."
"Good stuff. Now this is a lager."
"High drinkability as I could drink this all night on its own or with a meal. A really good beer to pound in October, November, December..."
"500 ml bottle. Pours deep golden with a lasting head and medium carbonation. Nose is sweet, juicy malt. Crisp, medium body. Bready, sweet malt dominate the palate, with some perfume and floral hops in the background. Medium finish is more balanced. The beer is lighter on hops and color than the best American Octoberfests, but it's clean, easy drinking and overall delicious."
"Drinkability - A lovely brew and very drinkable. Complex and great taste with a moderate abv."
"A refreshing beer, great cold. I could drink several of these happily when the mood strikes."
"Probably a great beer for the style, but just not for me at this point of my beer journey."
"500 ml. bottle. 2010 batch. The pour is orange-gold with a whole lot of puffy, long lasting head that never goes away. Sweet and roasted malts greet the nose in an inviting fashion. The creamy body leads to a caramel sweetness in the taste, which is almost honey like. There is a nice roastiness and pleasant dryer finish. A very nice Octoberfest beer from those who know how to do it right."
"Great beer. One that I will be drinking again; I really enjoyed it."
"Of all octoberfest beers I had this fall,I enjoyed this one the most. It smelled like honey when I opened it. The beer has a dark golden haze to it. A lil carbonation and foam. The taste is fresh clove,fruit,malty flavor. Very smooth tasting.I really enjoyed it I wish I had more. Looking foward to getting more beers by Ayinger."
"A real light orangey yellow color. The head was simi-clear, thin off white head. The nose was odd. I can't really pin point anything. It is a little skunky and a little bitter? Nice mouth feel! There is some earthy and leathery taste. Some nice walnut or pecan nuttiness. However, the finish is light. This is a good beer and great for the season but it seems like it's missing something?"
"Not a bad beer at all but it does feel a bit unorganized. Just doesn't quite work for me. (again this is a tough style of beer with many amazing competitors)"
"Drink- Again, I just really like what Ayinger does. Call me biased. This is a solid product."
"An Oktoberfest with great yeast character. Good all around. I wish it was cheaper."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, a bit of malts. Taste is a good balance of malts and hops, just a tad of sweetness to it. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D- A style I'm not really familiar with, but it went down awful fast."
"Good Oktoberfest although I was more impressed by it last year. This year I preferred the more complex flavors of Paulaner's. If only I could combine those flavors with this mouthfeel..."
"This is a tastey brew but not my personal fav. I still like Hacker Pschorr Marzen/Oktoberfest the best. This is not too far off. I bit more carmel sweetness to it. Excellent beer nonetheless. Very pricey in my area. 60 case of beer is pushing my pricing point. I love great beer but that's getting crazy for a fest beer. If you get a chance try it. It's a solid offering."
"M, D- Rich medium body with super-easy drinkability."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a mug. Showed a deep caramel orange/brown with a thick white head with tremendous retention and lacing. Smell was sweet with bready malts, caramel and brown sugar. Some faint earthy hops as well. Taste was full and chewy with the caramel sweetness playing big and balanced by some hop dryness in the finish. Not typically a fan of Oktoberfest beers but this was incredible. One of the most drinkable beers I've had in a while, certainly going to pick up a few more bottles while I can."
"Notes: I'm not particularly familiar with the style, but I'm not exactly impressed. While it is a good beer that I'd drink on many occasions, it isn't great."
"Dimpled mug for this guy. First thing I notice about the beer is the clarity - it's very clear. The next thing I notice is the aroma, which I can smell from where I'm sitting - my glass is about an arm's length away. Next we have the head, which is rocky, with inconsistent large and small bubbles. As it fades, the head retention is strange. It looks like fat suspended in broth - lets hope it doesn't taste like that. Aroma reminds me a little bit of a farm, kind of like damp straw. Damp leaves maybe. Color is amber moving to gold, a little bit darker than a pumpkin. Taste is light, with a slightly salt water mineral finish. Mouthfeel isn't sticky, more along the lines of creamy. Lager yeast is the name of the game here, as it dominates everything, from the nose of the beer into the first taste. I expected this to have more malt characteristics, honestly, and they are there, to be sure, though not as sweet as I would like. Instead hops are the focus, with some grassy dandelion hops lending a small amount of bitterness to the whole thing. I find this beer strangely drinkable. It's not like anything I've had before - and that's always surprising. Distinctive."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking."
"D: I have finally found the best Märzen of the season. The Germans have been doing it for centuries, and they still do it better than anybody else."
"D - Very drinkable and this is preferable to some of its peers."
"The flavor has sweet and bready malt, mild hops, and some earthiness. Smooth, easy to drink, medium bodied, modest carbonation. A very nice Oktoberfest, which I would buy again."
"Not super aggressive or crazy, which can be a nice change from other fall seasonals, especially for the price."
"D: I thought it was upper-tier; I preferred this to the Paulaner version, but it doesn't measure up to New Glarus Staghorn, in my opinion. It's heftier than the Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr interpretations, so I would prefer those on drinkability. For me an Oktoberfest is something I should be able to finish a stein of. I was in Germany last year!! This is what they do!!"
"D- At first the mixtures of flavors threw me off but after I spent some time with it, it turned out to be a pretty solid beer."
"Glad to finally try this one. A beautiful light orange amber. Great big fluffy white head nice lacing a nice looking beer. Not much aroma, little bread and yeast aroma. Nice sweet malty taste. Not as heavy as some Marzens can be. A really nice session beer. This is what a good Octoberfest should be."
"M: Smoth, nice carbonation, could be a little creamier/smoother."
"drinkability; this stuff taste pretty good and the aftertaste is really pleasant. One could drink a lot of this, one of the better Märzens."
"D: This is marked by fantastic subtleties. It is light yet flavorful, and is completely unoffensive in every way."
"Pours an orangish copper color with a small white head. Aroma is malty, bready, and earthy. Taste is malty with caramel sweetness and some hops bitterness. Medium-light body with good carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Good drinkability; overall not a bad beer."
"Everything works in this beer. The mouthfeel is full and rich, but the carbonation lightens the feel and keeps the palate clean. Although the flavor profile leans more malty and sweet, there's enough hop spice to keep things balanced and drinkable. This is one of the better Marzens I've had."
"As much as I wanted to love this, I'd prefer many of the local Octoberfests (New Glarus, Summit, Point, maybe even Leinie's)."
"D: Certainly an easy drinker. I downed my 500 mL bottle rather quickly and could have gone for another. This may be my favorite Marzen to date."
"A very balanced, solid, and tasty ceremonial lager, the kind where just less than a single digit of ABV uptick can make all the difference. Ergo, I can totally see the appeal of downing 1 liter steins of this kind of stuff amongst thousands of like-minded imbibers, especially if they too are choosing this kick-ass Bavarian brewer."
"Pours a big three finger plus head yet so loosely knit and comprised of huge bubbles that it is gone almost before you can try to measure it, zero lacing as well. Bright orange amber color with a metallic cast, clear and transparent, abundant streams of bubbles visible, especially after first poured. Sweet, bready, malty nose full of molasses, honey, caramel, fruit cake, golden raisin, date, apple fruit, orange glaze, with some milk chocolate for good measure, a dried graininess appears as you acclimate to it. Lighter-bodied with plenty of fizzy carbonation to keep it swirling actively from start to finish. Its inherent sweetness helps it gain some traction, Honey, sweet butter, maple syrup, orange peel, root beer and chocolate bits pretty up things first. Challah bread, croissant flakes and buttermilk up next. Keeps that golden raisin, date aspect but blends in fresher apple, pear, apricot flavors too. As with the nose, it is not like there's no hops at all, they just seem to fill in cracks rather than stand center stage. This is about the perfect bottle size for the flavors, any more and it would get tedious."
"Good beer but im just not that fond of marzens."
"Drinkability: Malty but not really sweet. A top notch brew from Ayinger."
"I tried it about two weeks ago so I can't give you any details at this point. All I know is, I have to get more. For my taste, it's much better than the Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest which I just tried last weekend."
"Poured this into a pint glass. The beer is clear amber color with visible carbonation and a thick frothy looking white head that dissipates leaving soapy lacing all along the side. The smell is toasty malts and minimal hops to be found. Hints of vanilla and tea peer through. If Autumn has a smell, this is certainly it. Big malt flavor that mostly overshadows everything else. Slightly biscuity and with a slight bitter finish. The taste is leaving me somewhat underwhelmed. The mouthfeel isn't as lively as I had expected, with the carbonation so visible I'm surprised by the lack of it in my mouth. This is smooth and leaves me with a buttery kind of sensation on my buds. I'll be able to drink this just fine but it certainly isn't my favorite. Very unlikely I'll snag this again."
"A great example to the style, and especially inviting if you can find it on draught."
"Drinkability: quite good indeed. I could probably quaff these all day long; preferably in a long tent with a few thousand new friends."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, the great October beer."
"Did I mention that this stuff is good?"
"mouthfeel light bodied that is crisp and clean"
"D- I had to keep myself from chugging this. It really is a great thirst quencher, but it also has enough weight to it to make it very enjoyable on a cool October evening."
"D - Very high for the style and season."
"The only way to describe it is a fluffy mouthfeel. Soft and delicious. Clearly a very clean fermentation. Very slightly acidic at the end of the sip. Super balanced. Quality craft brew."
"very high. so far, if i had to pick 1 Oktoberfest brew, it would be this one. Great taste, great mouthfeel."
"Since this isn't anywhere near my favorite style, I was careful to grade it based on what makes the representatives of this style really stand out. I've had a few Marzens that I enjoyed more while in Germany, but for what I've had stateside, this one is a can't miss."
"Ayinger Oktober Fest-Marzen was amber in color with good clarity. It had a large off-white head that didn't last. The smell was sweet malt. The taste was lightly sweet, toasty malt with a little spice coming through towards the dry finish. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and just over medium carbonation. Drinkabity was very good. This is a tasty Oktoberfest and worth trying."
"D - High marks here since you could quaff this for awhile."
"Overall - Having recently traveled to Munich I have come to learn that the strict limitations of ingredients stemming from the Purity Law result in fantastic, simple, and incredibly fresh tasting beer..this is no exception. A friend of mine who works at a distributer recommended this as being his favorite Oktober fest beer, and now I can confidently say that I fully agree."
"Drinkability: I would drink this beer again. Excellent example of the style. You should try it"
"PROST!"
"This is very sweet and malty for an Octoberfest (which is saying something since -fest beers should be sweet and malty). The mouthfeel is very smooth and this beer is quiet drinkable but do not expect your typical -fest beer. This one is uniquly malty."
"D: Pretty good. That aftertaste makes this less-than-quaffable, but it still goes down pretty easy."
"D - Great beer. I still think that Paulaner makes a better Oktoberfest, but this one is a close second. I think the malt/hops balance is a little better in Paulaner. Still, I'm most likely going to be buying more of this beer before they're gone for the year."
"great to see this in BC as we have been lacking in real OK Fest beers. Pours mid gold with a great hop nose. I love the thick mouthfeel with the hoppy midbody. This is a well made marzen with all the right flavours. A slight dryness in the finish makes it oh so drinkable"
"D- not amazingly tasty over here but very decent and very easy to quaff"
"Notes: Good brew, maybe the best Octoberfest I've had so far this fall."
"Pours an almost clear caramel color with a big white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is a bit grainy with some nice smelling malts. A bit of caramel and toffee along with a faint hop presence. The taste is awesome. The taste is a lot better than the smell IMO. All the scents from the nose are present in the flavor, but much more noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, but crisp at the same time. This could be one of my favorite Octoberfest beers so far. Drinkability is high."
"Aroma is caramelly and bready with a good level of fragrance. The flavor has the same aspects, with a touch of toffee layered in. It's very malty and rich, but has a light and crisp feeling as well. Drinkability is outstanding. I had plans for a different brew after, but I decided to pour another half liter of this instead."
"D-could see this going perfectly with Octoberfest activities, but didn't wow me. That said, it does go down very easily"
"D: Highly drinkable. I wished I had bought more after I drank this."
"Appearance is a clear light orange with a decent frothy light tan head. Smells of starchy grains, semi-sweet with brown sugar, a bit of dry clove. Taste is fairly strong light brown sugar sweetness, fresh cinnamon, silage, mild lemon hop as a minor character. The carbonation is light and smooth, body pretty light, sweetness thin and tasteless like sugar syrup. A bit too thin, not enough malt, sweetness out of place."
"This is a tasty, quaffable festbier with some surprising flavors for a lager."
"A classic example of the style, and a great beer all around - I typically drink only 1 or 2 a year, and as always I'm left satisfied. A perfect beer for those 55 degree days when the leaves start to turn..."
"Price = $3.50"
"D: Wow. I really liked this beer. The flavor and aroma make this one lead the pack for me. I'd like to try this one fresh in Germany. It is dangerously drinkable. I could put down a 1L stein of this no problem."
"...."
"Smooth lager a nice crisp bite on the tongue. Very drinkable beer. I really like the Oktoberfest malty taste. The flavors are very well done."
"D - I could enjoy this all day. Not quite in sessionville, but damn close, and I don't mind if I end the day a little tipsy."
"D_Very solid Oktoberfest. Could drink this all night.. ."
"Pours a somewhat dark amber with an off white head. Tiny bits of lacing. Smell is slightly sweet with some caramel and a tiny bit of hoppiness coming through. Taste is similar, and is somewhat buoyed by a fairly thick mouthfeel. Not much alcohol presence on a medium body. Drikability is okay. Nothing is particularly wrong with the beer, but there's nothing to write home about either."
"D-Not bad on drinkability. Not one of Ayinger's better beers tho."
"Overall: On the eve of the first weekend of Oktoberfest, this beer brings back great Bavarian memories from my first trip to Germany. Fantastic authenticity which gives a cozy feeling on a late-summer evening. The painted bottle caps are a nice touch too."
"D- very drinkable, could have a couple of liters of this every fall."
"The best food pairing with this beer will no doubt be regional. Try it with the traditional Bavarian cuisine that you would find at Oktoberfest. Pretzels, goulash, Wiener Schnitzel, bratwursts, and sauerkraut would all be delicious with this one! The rich maltiness of the beer also plays well against the meaty, nut-like character of a Swiss cheese such as Appenzeller, which is washed in white wine and cider, or a raw milk, Cave-aged Gruyere, a toasty, salty cheese."
"Drinkability is great. Well balanced and highly sessionable."
"medium-bodied, somewhat creamy mouthfeel; IMO the kind of beer that is very enjoyable for a strict run of one or two, then experiences a steep drop-off."
"German lagers like these are often overlooked--yes, we still think the world needs more lagers! This is a classic--an exceptional and flavorful alternative for the ongoing lightening of the celebratory Märzen."
"D- Great. I find it one of the better balanced sweet beers. I could use this with dinner, casually drinking, or as a session brew. Swiss Army knife of beers."
"Taste is not as up front as most Oktoberfests I have had. Very smooth and easy to drink. Some roasted malt with a little bitterness at the finish. The mouth feel is very slick and wet. This is very appealing. I would suggest this one fairly cool when drinking."
"I could drink this all day. Too bad I'm not willing to pay what it would cost to drink this all day. Really though, I think this is one to savor, because getting blitzed on this...you would lose the subtlety that makes it so great. Awesome Oktoberfest beer. As usual, Ayinger doesn't disappoint. They have made such an incredible lager with a flavor balance that most brewers could only dream about. I'll be coming back to this whenever I feel like treating myself."
"D-Not bad on drinkability but a little sweet for my taste. I expected more from this one based on reputation and the quality of their dopplebock."
"overall: very drinkable and enjoyable beer goes down smooth finish is clean and the malt sweetness is there as well not complex but very good!"
"Good representation of the style. To quote BJCP, ""This is one of the classic malty styles, with a maltiness that is often described as soft, complex, and elegant but never cloying"". However, as a beer, it's not something that I would designate as ""must have""."
"This has that pretty amber color in the glass. The smell is pretty sweet, maybe caramelish. The first thing I tasted was the sweet caramel that shines through on the nose, but after the initial taste there is a good deal of spicy tingliness on the tongue. It feels a little thin on the mouth, but because of that one could drink a few of these in a night without difficulty. Pretty good."
"D: Nice example of the style. Pretty smooth and easy to drink, yet spicy and flavorful. This would pair nicely with a grilled sausage or braut on a fall day."
"D: I would definitely not complain at being served this all night PROST!! first German Oktoberfestbier of the season and America just can't compete..."
"Drinkability -- While definitely good, this one didn't quite do it for me. It goes back to the mustiness. Would've liked less malt sweetness and a little more roast character - within reason."
"Tasty and drinkable, though not as impressive as other offerings from Ayinger."
"Pours into my mug a crystal clear copper, with a white head that fills the glass, but soon drops to a thin sheet. Sweet, bready German malt aroma...clean lager notes and a pinch of noble hops. Toasted malt sweetness, caramel, and spice flavors. Crisp, clean, and lightly bitter. Hints of dough. Medium-light bodied, smooth, and dry in the finish. Refreshing and drinkable...one of the better examples of the style that I've had."
"D: It's very easy to drink this beer; I could easily drink several of these in a single sitting. I definitely won't pass up the opportunity to have this beer when it is available in the fall."
"Pours light orange/amber with a rich white head with excellent retention. Aroma of bready grains and a bit of yeast, most certainly caramel grains. Taste is very crisp, primarily caramel malt which overpowers mild hop bitterness. The malt/yeast combination is reminiscent of white crackers. Mouthfeel is excellent, very crisp and medium carbonation perfectly matched to the malt's feel. Very drinkable, overall it is a very 'clean' tasting beer."
"Pours a very bright orange color with a large 2 finger fluffy head with sup rising lacing and retention for a marzen. The coloring is simply amazing and the body is perfectly clear. The aroma has a distinct cooked sweet potato aroma. Bready malts follow with a clove or allspice undertone.also has a touch of that German lager yeasty aroma. The flavor is clean and crisp with focused bready malty flavors. There is also a semi spicy flavor that flows nicely. The mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on with classic oktoberfests. Unlike American versions, this is light and refreshing and easily put down rather quickly. Well worth the 3 bucks for this bottle."
"D - Smooth and relatively mellow with nicely balanced flavors. Very happy with the ABV and will likely grab again."
"http://1yob.com/post/1050445861/ayinger"
"Just an all-around good beer. Very subtle but everything is reminiscent of Fall and it is so smooth it just slides down your throat so it's easy to take down a couple of these."
"Good connectivity and a nice beer overall. One of the best oktoberfests I've had."
"D - Nice oktoberfest. That being said, I still havent found a great okotoberfest stateside. This is a pretty basic/straightforward Oktoberfest."
"Not overly complex, pretty much exactly what I was expecting. It may not have any tricks up its sleave, but it is a nearly perfect example of what German Oktoberfests represent."
"This is good stuff. To be honest there's not a whole lot of complex aspects to this beer but it goes great with the food its intended for. I see myself picking up some more next time I'm at Otto's for my sausage fix."
"Drinkability is nice, dusted off the 500ml myself."
"Cheers!"
"Sorry Ayinger... you can do A LOT better!"
"PS: Love the cap!"
"To me this is a grand example of a marzen-fest beer, tasting very fresh and generously delicious."
"This went GREAT with onions dipped in hummus."
"Easy to drink but the hops provides a fun little bite at the end."
"Drinkability is great, easy drinker, but good for cooler weather. Not very heavily bodied, which is nice."
"Poured a very nice orange-copper color with some very nice head and a bit of nice lacing. Decent scent, with a nice crisp maltiness, though nothing very deep. Excellent taste, a very nice burnished maltiness with a hint of leaves turning color. Goes down exceptionally well."
"D: light overall flavor but marzen is made to be very drinkable. wishing this came in liter bottles."
"Overall a very quaffable beer, though if I were to open another bottle I think the sweetness would be cloying by the end of it. Drinking this makes me want to sit on the porch and watch the leaves change color, and I think that's great."
"D- Drinkable to be sure. Very refreshing and not too heavy. That being said, I found this beer, based on the brewery and the style, to be somewhat of a disappointment. Not a bad beer, just underwhelming."
"Although on the sweeter side, the malt presence in this beer does not make the flavor overwhelming and when combined with its light body and crisp refreshness, you get one sessionable brew. I could definitely see an all day booze-fest centered around this beer."
"re-rate 8/14 - MUCH better...pretty much all around, and in every way.  Wow.  re-rate is ridiculously higher.  DATE THE BOTTLE please!"
"D: After a long day at work, this hit the spot. Picked up the last bottle at the corner store and glad I did. Will look for this in the future. Another great brew from Ayinger."
"D - really nice to drink, nice mix of the caramel and citrus, very easy to drink and a bit lighter than alot of marzen beers"
"Another gem from the Ayinger Brewery, which has yet to disappoint me. I will be seeking more of this as its the best Marzen I've has thus far."
"This is a highly sessionable beer that I would love to have again, so drinkability is quite high."
"Overall a really enjoyable German Oktoberfest beer. Very easy drinking and refreshing - just as it should be."
"Appearance 3.0, Smell 3.5, Taste 3.5, Mouthfeel 3.0, Drinkability 3.5, Score 3.35"
"If you like marzens you should consider this. Yet another winner by ayinger."
"D - Very nice and drinkable. Sufficiently dry to quenching and no one flavor is overpowering. Could easily drink a few liters."
"Taste is sweet and malty with a good toastiness and a slight metallic finish but still very good. Has a crisp light mouthfeel, excellent beer!"
"D - This is a really solid o-fest. Good price and quite tasty."
"Tasty brew that I'll look for again next year."
"Pours with a nice three finger, sorta off white head with soapy lacing. Medium amber body pretty typical of the style. The smell is malty with a bready kick at the end - kinda reminds me of grape nuts. The taste is decently balanced - malt forward, sweet, but some hops to give the slightest bitterness. A pleasantly smooth aftertaste. Overall a good beer, but nothing really stands out to make it great."
"500ml bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a clear gold with a little amber tint. About a finger of white head. Malty aroma with some noble hops. You get that good malt complexity that only seems to come from Germany. A bit of malt sweetness. Crisp and clean with a fair amount of noble hop bitterness in the finish. On the lighter side of medium bodied. Great rendition of the style."
"Overall: a classic revisited--sweet, pleasant pairing with the Saturday afternoon...satisfyingly balanced..."
"the pour is a golden amber with a consistent white head... german and crisp but not steadfast. some lace. nose of apple and malt. palate of bitter stale apple and a mild funk. not barnyard but stale earth in finish. it has the quintessential marzen quality and an extremely light body... i don't know if the body is suffiecent in comparison to the range of flavor though. not as sweet as some which is really nice. thin... but complex. it seems to loss a lot as it airs out and warms up and just leaves a sour dough water quality. one of the best marzen for some that like a lean one. just good by me. not so good if it sits."
"Prost!"
"D - Excellent. Definitely one of the easiest to drink Octoberfests I've had."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear orange with two finger sudsy head. Smell: pale malt, light toffee and butter, a bit musty and grainy. Taste: buttered bread, toffee, lightly spicy hops, grainy, pale malt. Mouthfeel: soft carbonation, edging towards creamy. A bit more to it than other light fest beers, would have liked to see Ayinger do a heftier marzen."
"Drinkability: This is what an Oktoberfest should taste like. Very drinkable, and one of my favorite Fall brews."
"The Ayinger marzen pours a pale amber color, almost golden. Very carbonated head that fizzes and dwindles. Nose is malty and quite sweet with the marzen bready aromas also present. Palate is sweet with lots of caramel and hints of a hoppy bite with the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is above average. In my opinion, there are other better Marzen's available but the heritage and history that this beer has keeps me coming back each year."
"This beer was being sold as bombers in the store where I bought it. The guy in front of me just grabbed the whole display and bought the entire stock (sparing one for me). So apparently I'm not alone when I say that Ayinger Octoberfest is pretty drinkable."
"I was surprised that this was only 5.80% ABV since it was pretty easy to detect. Maybe it was because it didn't take me long to get through the bottle. I'm not a huge fan of this style but if you're going to have a beer to celebrate Octoberfest, you can't go wrong with this one. Maybe the most authentic stylistically that I've ever had!"
"Mouth-feel lighter than I expected, but a drinkable and enjoyable brew nevertheless."
"Very drinkable, good german october brew."
"The beer pours a brilliant golden with copper hue and a moderate white head. The aroma is intensely malty -toasty, bready and sweet. The flavor is a blast of malt; sweet, toasty, and silky smooth. The hop bitterness and slightly dry finish provides a perfect counterpoint to the malt centric beer. The body and carbonation are both medium. Overall a great Oktoberfest, highly recommend. I'm having mine with a crusty rye bread - a fantastic snack!"
"MF&D - the feel is fine, but the only reason that the drinkablilty suffers is because of the blandness of the brew itself, otherwise the drinkability is good."
"A very drinkable festbier! I'm afraid if I were supplied with several Maßkrugs of this beer it might disappear at an alarming rate. Easily in my top five of Oktoberfest beers and may be much closer to the top than that!"
"Drink I could spend all day at the fest drinking this. Darn good beer."
"A true example of the traditional German Marzen. Great maltiness and the sweetness nicely balanced by the earthy hops. Unbelievably drinkable, my only knock being i wish there was a touch more malt."
"This is a decent version of the style that in my opinion, seems more authentic than American versions."
"Overall: A success of an Oktoberfest. Drinkable, rich, and pleasing."
"D - An easy drinking marzen. Flavors are well integrated, not overwhelming. Lightly filling due to some of moderate carbonation. ABV is in line."
"(Score/review based on my on-tap experience)"
"Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. It comes out a yellow/amber color, slightly lighter than I expected. This beer has perfect clarity to it with an off white frothy head with many different sized bubbles. The head dissipates fairly quickly, and I thought there was some lacing but most of it just kind of crawls very slowly to the bottom of the glass. The smell is good, not very strong. Smell of roasted, or more like toasted malts. It has a kind of clean smell if that makes sense. The taste is good. The taste is mostly comprised of caramelized roasted malts. It certainly one of the sweetest tasting Oktoberfest style beers I've ever had. Almost like a toasted sweet breaddy taste or grain. The beer really comes out with a clean crisp taste to it. The mouthfeel was pretty good, left a little bit of a dry feeling, but very light bodied. It's an incredibly drinkable beer. I think this would be more of an early fall or even late summer beer. It would be an excellent beer for a hot day. Not something I'd recommend for the later fall season considering how light it is."
"D - this is a solid Oktoberfest. I haven't had too many oktoberfests this year, however this one was one of the better ones I have had."
"Purchased a bottle at Wine Gallery, Brookline. Poured into a stemmed glass. Faded peach color. Attractive looking and moderately carbonated. Average sized head. A bit malty in the smell, but not too noticeable. Tasted like an average Oktoberfest beer, balanced and straightforward German. What I disliked about this beer was the mouthfeel. Very sticky on the palate and on the aftertaste. Needs to be cleaned up. I can drink this beer, no issue there, but I would not particularly enjoy more than one of these."
"Overall, this is an exceptionally good oktoberfest, possibly even my favorite so far."
"The body was perhaps a little thinner than I like for the style. Drinkability was very good, but suffered due to the stickiness of the caramel. Overall, a good beer worth trying and worth having several of."
"Overall: The mouth feel is has a medium creamy texture and very smooth. The body of the beer is medium to medium thick. The finish is clean. I really enjoyed drinking this beer it is a wonderful Octoberfest."
"A nice beer that I would drink again but not search it out."
"mouthfeel is excellent. good body yet clean on the palate. great balance. great drinkability."
"Overall - A very good example of the style that should please most fans of it. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability? I could drink this non stop until nanobots turn the earth to grey goo, it is that yummy!"
"Drinkability: I think this a very drinkable beer. It is perfect to go with a meal and an evening's conversation with friends. Just the kind of beer you want to go with a pleasant time. It is tasty, not particularly challenging, but enjoyable."
"Overall a solid Oktoberfest beer, would like to have it by the 12 oz bottle though rather than the larger bottle. It is a well balanced entry into the field and may be what you want to try first if your pondering on which one to choose."
"I poured my half liter bottle into my quarter liter German mug. The appearance is classic, clear copper with ample fluffy white head. The aroma is not very intense but has a nicely rounded sweetness. The taste is very well rounded. Nice nutty cereal malt and enough hops to finish clean. The mouthfeel is fairly light and clean. This is an amazingly drinkable beer, in my opinion world class for the style, Oktoberfest beer is meant to be drank from 1 liter steins, and this is one I could down all night. There's not a whole lot I can really say to describe the taste, but it is just one of those beers that just begs to be drunk."
"Certainly one that I could drink plenty of at an O-fest gathering!"
"D - Not as flavorful as other October fests I have had."
"Fill up Das Boot and let me pound it. I could drink gallons of this stuff. Thin crisp and balanced, in a good way."
"As good a Märzen as I've ever tried. I'm trying this against Spaten's version, and the Ayinger is the clear winner. The beer pours a relatively light amber-golden color with a smallish white head and pretty good retention. The beer smells of peaches, apples and concord grapes. It's very pleasant, even if that description makes it sound oversweet. It's a light but rich malty character that transmits to the flavor quite well. The beer is has a delicate and complex malt character that has fruit and caramel notes. The Germans really know how to tease out delicate malt flavors. The finish is mildly bitter and cuts out much of the lingering sweetness. It's a very drinkable beer, and I'd be quite happy spending a day drinking this beer out of enormous steins."
"This is a really good Marzen/O'fest. Something I would recommend. One of my favorites of the style."
"Pours a clear pale amber/honey color with a nice dense khaki colored head that settled into a nice ring and light cap. The aroma is sweet and doughy; touch of caramel to go with the munich malt. Some light grassy hops to round out the flavor. The taste is quite neutral, the caramel seems to offset the doughy malt characteristics, leaving a somewhat bland yet enjoyable flavor. Any hop presence is minimal. Nice moderate body with tingly carbonation, sweet overall but balanced. A nice marzen style German Oktoberfest. The caramel flavors play nicely with the malt. Very tasty and a good Oktoberfest to celebrate."
"D - Very good Marzen... Easy drinking and quite quaffable... Filling... However, I think it is a step below the top of the class (Hacker-Pschorr) in the category..."
"Notes: This is a very well made Oktoberfest. To me it's like a Munich Helles Lager but a little deeper in color, richer and fuller in flavor and body with the same wonderful drinkability."
"Tastes of fresh grains, doughy biscuits, banana, toasted malts. Extremely consistent flavors on the midpalate and finish, very cohesive with a moderately bitter and crisp finish. Really some exceptionally doughy flavors going on here I haven't experienced much. A little different than the styles I have normally had, but some nice stuff here. Medium body with a fine-medium carbonation that is quite likeable, goes down real easy. Real flavorful stuff, I am enjoying this one a lot. Ayinger is a hell of a brewery, pure quality."
"That's two down, and two to go in the German Oktoberfest Inviational. I'll be back tomorrow night to crack open another bottle."
"Poured from a 500-mL bottle that had no evident date. Lovely golden with an accompanying finger-sized head that stuck around for a short time. Lacing present but wasn't ample. The nose was pretty much the usual Oktoberfest, as was the taste. Pleasant, crisp, malt, medium carbonation. Not the strongest from Brauerei Aying, but a decent representation of the style. I'll certainly have one again next year."
"Very drinkable and one of the best in class."
"Sophisticated malty lager, though a bit sweet and lacking retention appropriate to the style. A fantastic brewery, but this isn't their shining moment here..."
"Solid O-fest. Deep gold to amber in color. Head quickly falls in to glass with some lacing. Floral perfume hops in the nose with some caramel aroma. Toasted malt flavor and again the caramel comes through.Medium bodies and good drinking. Not as robust as some others but true to style."
"Drinkability..tastes good, and maybe a little lighter than it should be but I'd have this again"
"A fairly robust Oktoberfest, a bit too sweet and sticky for my liking, although it still delivers the goods."
"this is hands down my favorite marzen, even if it truly is not an authentic oktoberfest. its very well rounded and very easy to drink without getting boring."
"This beer has a very nice body, with a great amount of carbonation to really make it feel alive in your mouth, but not to the point of being soda-like. Very clean flavor profile and a very nice refreshing quality (for a Marzen)."
"This beer is in a lot of ways very middle-of-the-road Marzen.. Pour is your typical auburn- good, but nothing unique. Mouthfeel is fairly moderate with a noticeable amount of carbonation. The one thing that really stood out is theres a noticeable apple presence, sort of like a hard cider. Much more present in the flavor than the aroma. The drinkability seemed to suffer a bit.. I wasn't necessarily enthralled with the beer, but it was certainly pretty good and I would gladly take it over many things, many other Marzens even."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Has a clear golden color with two inches of head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is weak with light scent of malt and noble hops. The flavor is really surprising with the high amount of noble hop flavor packed into this beer. A little sweetness in the front compliments the hops. The body feels a little thin for the style. Carbonation is good. Different from most German Oktoberfest with the big hop flavor and the malt being secondarty. Could use a little more body to make this one the better fest beers."
"**Edited after having this beer fresh on tap in Munich. **"
"D - Very easy to drink for the most part but the sweetness kind of got to me. Nice flavors and aromas the whole way but by the end of the glass I needed something to get that malt sweetness out of my mouth."
"Fresh tasting and smooth, with some definite substance to it. Very drinkable, went down easy with a couple of landjagers"
"Drinkability: A solid Marzen overall. A little sweeter than Paulaner and not quite as good. While a decent brew, I honestly expected more."
"D'ability - a nice balanced, malty lager. Way too easy to drink!"
"D: I was pleasantly surprised this being my first time with an Ayinger in recent memory. Not in my mind what an Oktoberfest beer is thought of in America but will make a lot of people happy this fall."
"D: I love this time of year for beer. I look forward to O-fests alot, and this is always one of my favorites. A sane ABV makes this easy to session."
"D- an extremely drinkable and addictive brew, poss. my new fav. imported o'fest, this is one freeking awesome beer"
"Fall is my favorite part of beer season (next to spring, summer and winter), and this year there seem to be more Oktoberfests available than ever before. This one is a classic. Deep amber in color, the off-white head lasts a few bubbly minutes before fading and leaving a somewhat sticky ring around the glass. Caramel, graham crackers and toast are all over the aroma, with hints of apples. The body is very smooth, broken up by a constant churn of teeny-weeny bubbles that fizz from the bottom of the glass in huge columns. It's like drinking a glass of staccato. The taste has more caramel and crackers with a hint of carrots (surprise!), but mostly this just tastes *good*. Ayinger can't do wrong."
"Poured a 16.9 oz. bottle into a 20 oz. nonic. Deep orange, amber with a slight haze to it. aroma is a bit subdued, with hints of apple, sweet bready malts. The flavor starts out with a warm, creamy dose of carame andl bread goodness, which dries out with a crisp finish. a slight memory of the malt lingers on. This beer is delicious, and perhaps a tad on the less malty side than some of it's german counterparts (excluding the largest -selling ones, e.g. Warsteiner, which are less malty). This is a delicious, quite drinkable oktoberfest, in the middle as far as alcohol, maltiness, and sweetness. Well worth trying."
"All together a solid Festbier. Lots of malt flavor matched well with the right amount of hops. Pours brighter and a little cloudier than most Marzens. Great aroma. Complex and deep. Presence of diacetyl mixed in with caramel malts. A great treat to celebrate the arrival of autumn."
"Drinkability: An Outstanding Oktoberfest. One of the best served in this area."
"A good example of an Octoberfest that I will be revisiting next year."
"A very cool German Marzen. Quite worth the try."
"Cheers - Matt"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability scored points with me - the pleasant flavors combined with being quite low in carbonation encouraged large mouthfills. Pretty sure I could polish off a couple liters of this in an evening."
"Overall this was a good beer although the malt flavors weren't quite crisp enough for a marzen. Still, the mouthfeel is very good and I say it's worth a shot."
"Pours a clear, medium gold in color with about a finger of white head. Aroma is good with Munich and Veinna malts, light toasted malts and clean lager characteristics. Flavor is pretty good. This beer starts fairly sweet but then finishes moderately dry. Hop bitterness is moderate and noble hop flavor is low; both are present near the finish. A complex malty character dominates with Munich and Vienna malts and a toasty aspect again present. Mouthfeel is good with medium body and carbonation and a creamy texture. Drinkability is pretty good. Good complexity, very enjoyable."
"Nice gold in color, continuous carbonation, contains a great atumn pumpkin tasts, and some spice remains after each sip. All in all a great brew--especially in the genre of Marzen...This is a good time of year."
"Drinkability- Truly refreshing. The balance of hops and malts was highly appealing and the carbonation made it quite refreshing. Nice beer for a cool late summer/early fall day and with lighter fare on the grill. I've yet to find a beer from Ayinger that I don't love."
"A very drinkable beer. Definitely a session beer."
"D: This is what fall is about; bring on Oktoberfest and bring on Ayinger!"
"I could drink a fair bit of it, I like it. It might be the O-fest I've liked the best out of what I've tried - not my favorite style."
"Poured amber with a generous head that quickly faded. The aroma was a little skunky, but did not put me off as I usually lose the aroma early anyway. The taste is sweet, bland and a little bananaish (if I may use that non word). This one was medium bodied with a small amount of carbonation left over from the head. Drinkability above average, because the beer is above average. Too be honest, even after moving the lawn, I'd rather have any number of lagers rated lower."
"Very drinkable beer for the price. A nice beer while eating dinner."
"(D)- A solid beer with a lighter body than what I was expecting. Fruity with a good malt balance. Simple yet enjoyable for sure."
"Drinkability> Not bad. Just not what I expected"
"I wasn't crazy about this beer. It has a nice amber appearance, decent lacing. But the smell and taste were too sweet for me: there's an overwhelming caramel character that is just too much for me. Not bad, but this is definitely a sipping beer. Reminds me of one of those mochiato type drinks you get at Starbucks."
"Overall great, this is essentially the staple for Oktoberfest beers, delicious malts, nice cracked straw that I wish was a bit more prominent, nice light caramel malts that don't come on strong like most American versions, nice clean crisp lager flavors that really give this beer it's character. The only downfall is the lack of carbonation, and the finish doesn't dry as much as it did on previous batches... and this is as fresh as I've had it before so I think I need to let it condition a bit more in the bottle and maybe that will solve all the issues, or they just released it a bit too early this year."
"This is wonderfully chuggable. This is what i think of when i think of octoberfest."
"Dark Gold color, fresh smell...a little nutty perhaps? This beer is a great example of the Oktober Fest-Marzen style. Easy to drink, tastes delicious. Definitely enjoy this with some bratwursts. There are a lot of Oktoberfest beers out there, and this one is a good choice."
"Oktober Fest-Märzen is a pretty impressive beer, especially for the style. It's generally not one of my favorite styles, but this is a good one. It's consistent with the style in that it's relatively simple, but for what it is, the flavor's good. The nose is a tad weak and it would benefit from a little more body. But, it's pretty good stuff. It's definitely an Oktoberfest that you can't miss if you're into the style."
"Mouthfeel - the beer seemed not far from flat: perhaps by design, perhaps by bad regulator settings. In any case, not much fizziness in the beer, but still a medium mouthfeel."
"A half liter bottle poured into my Great Lakes dimpled mug. Appears a slightly hazed deep apricot color with about two fingers of creamy, lingering off white foam. Smell is dominated by malt, biscuits and a light fruitiness. Tastes of sweet caramel malts, lightly toasted grains, green apples, and bread. A great balance between roasty bitterness and the sweet malt. A bit more than medium bodied and amply carbonated. A classic marzen."
"Drinkability gets good marks. No problem finishing this one off, and it left me ready for more."
"nothing exceptional, but solid."
"Really nice - nothing in the least bit extreme, but still supremely satisfying on one of the first cool evenings of fall. Something about the perfect balance of bready malt and crisp hops just nailed it for for me tonight. Delicious."
"Orange blonde with a nice fluffy off white lead that leaves minimal lacing. Smells bready, mildly herbal with some toffee and fruit. Tastes of toasty grain and rich buttery malt well balanced by bitterness. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, well made, one of the best of the style."
"Drinkability: For the time of year this is, it's the perfect choice! Definitely a must drink."
"Refreshing beer, would like to see the creaminess go away."
"This beer is just another reason why I have become a big fan of Ayinger. This poured a nice amber with a big fat head that stuck around for a long time with great lacing. I noticed the sweet caramel scent right away, great maltiness and spice in the smell as well. The taste was packed with sweetness that was kept in check with a citrus taste and some hopiness. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth with great coating. This beer goes down very easy and was much enjoyed."
"D- Smooth and refreshing, very drinkable."
"This beer poured a cloudy copper-brown with a two-finger head with some lacing. The smell is some toasty caramel malt and a little bread. The taste starts off with sweet caramel that gives away to a little bit of alcohol and hop spiciness. Not the most complex version of the style, but a damn tasty one. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and crisp thanks to some fine carbonation. This is a nice drinkable beer that I will definitely think of picking up again sometime."
"Medium-bodied and medium carbonation, fairly smooth and an all around easy drinker. Nice and refreshing, I don't need a whole case of these, but I'd probably go ahead and pick up another bottle or two next year."
"The body is just slightly thickened and the carbonation is medium. This beer to me is the definition of a seasonal quaffer. Very nice."
"Poured an attractive copper color with nice white head that lasted a while. Aroma was of sweet malt, caramel, and just a bit of hop aroma. Flavor is pretty much the same with the sweetness being offset by just a bit of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is good. Beer is good, but I've had much better O-fests."
"After having alot of so-so domestic versions, this beer totally reminded me why I love this style. It's on the lighter side but still retains a fabulous malt profile."
"6/3/6/4/13 (3.2/5)"
"A clear orange/amber color pour with a large fluffy off white head. Nice lacing and lively carbonation. Aroma is of sweet toasted nutty caramel malt,apple,and a hint of spice very pleasent. The flavor blew me away,a huge sweet malty nutty taste,with some hints of bread,peaches and maybe some orange zest. A good creamy mouthfeel. Just a hint of bitter hops at the end. VERY GOOD !"
"I recomment this bier. Prosit!"
"Very high quality brew here, it's obvious even on the pour. Thick, copper hue with a huge beautiful looking head. Strong lacing as the brew is consumed. Taste is strongly bready, malty, biscuity -- quality oktoberfest here. Great texture, palate has just a bit of carbonation with a thick, full feel to it. Up there with the best marzens I've had. Highly recommended."
"From a 0.5 L bottle purchased locally. Aroma is rich with malt with a little sweetness and maybe a hint of orange peel and something slightly mango peppery in there in a good way. Deep golden color with a big off-white head, crystal clear. Flavor is bready rich malt with some of that toasty malt from the aroma. Some sweetness but balanced with the slight hint of bitterness. Clean and drinkable. Makes me want some bratwurst."
"D - I was a little disappointed with this beer because of the light flavors and thin body overall just an ok Oktoberfest beer"
"Medium bodied. Very smooth on the palate, with a soft dryness as described from brewer. Absolutely wonderful brew! Thank the Lord for the hop harvest."
"Drinkability: is high very high actually ..easy OFEST to drink very easy"
"Amber-orange pour with a frothy head. Bread, orange, and malt in the nose. Light mouthfeel with a lot of flavor. Buttery is a good description, with a nice hop profile that balances the sweet malt character. Delicious. This is what I expect out of an Oktoberfest."
"Nikki"
"500ml brown bottle picked up at Total Wine in Charleston, SC. Pours a crystal clear light amber/copper color with a nice fluffy off white head. Slight aromas of biscuity malt and caramel. Taste is of biscuity malt with a smooth clean finish. A little on the thin side but a decent Oktoberfest."
"D: i could easily drink this beer all night, and it gets points for that, as that is right on for the style. really nothing that spectacular though. a good solid beer, but noting that special in the end."
"The aroma has mild floral hops and caramel malt. The appearance is red/copper with a foamy head that turned a little ...clumpy. The flavor is very malty and has plenty of caramel and some honey. It's a simple taste but good. The palate is just right for the style. Very nice and true to the style but, it did have a couple of issues. For one it did taste a little stale."
"D: A better-than-average marzen, but there are others than are more enjoyable and a better value."
"This is a great O-fest, rich with bready caramel malts with a smooth, oh-so drinkable body. It is a touch thicker than other in the style, Spaten comes to mind as a thinner beer, but man it's good. The flavor has subtle layers of malt with a touch of crisp light toffee, with an aroma to match. I'll be looking forward to having this again next fall."
"This beer is a crystal clear orange/gold with a medium off-white head. Smell is slight; herbal and grainy. Taste is biscuity, slightly fruity with a big herbal hop finish. Very nice high bitterness that matches up with the malt quite well. Mouthfeel is slightly light, good carbonation. Very drinkable, this is a very good Marzen beer, I would definitely buy again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I'm just not sure I enjoy the Oktoberfest type of beer as much as I'd like to. If I did then I would be almost sure that Ayinger would do it justice. This one pours a hazy orange, with a frothing rocky head. Aroma is grainy malts. Flavor kind of matches that as well. There are some great malts in this one, but it seems like it is a bit too raw. Slight note of German hops after the swallow."
"Pours an amber color body, some orange. Whitish head, small and diminishing. Malty sweet aroma, fruity, but not very strong. Fruity, flowery, and malty taste. Some light fruity, malty taste. Not too bad, kinda tasty."
"could spend all day drinking this pint after pint..."
"Not a bad beer but not among Ayinger's better efforts in my opinion."
"A bit more body than most German Marzen offerings and a bit less that the maltier American versions. Definitely drinkable, if not the best German Oktoberfest."
"Could I drink down several of these? Yes, of course. But would I want to? That's the real question. And I'm afraid the answer is bordering on no."
"D: A nice Okto. A well done representative of the style."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, which I've found is common in alot of German Marzens, I can def. session these easily, a good stab at the style, not my favorite, but certainly good."
"and im glad i tried it, but i liked several others more than this one."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Mouthfeel was appropriate for the style, but the taste could have used a bit more work as it seemed a little too sweet. Fairly good drinkability overall."
"D: On the whole this is a drinkable beer. While not the best of its style, it's still a highly likable brew."
"D- a nice oktboerfest/marzan beer. I would def have another and i recommend a sixer."
"Decided to try this back to back against Paulaner's Okto. Pours with almost no head, and what's there is gone in an instant. Doesn't lace at all either. Pleasing color, though - a clear cider gold. Smells sweet - bread, apple, and plum. Taste is less pronounced than Paulaner, but very similar - sweet, fruitlike malt tempered by a dash of noble hops. Nothing unpleasant, but flavors lack the clarity of the Pauly Okto. Mouthfeel is this beer's strongpoint: not thick, not thin, just right - Goldilocks would approve. A very drinkable beer, to be sure, but I wouldn't choose this over the Paulaner."
"*More beer and sauerbraten! Prost!!"
"I had this beer on tap @ Deep Ellum, the night after I tasted 28 Oktoberfests, this one hit the spot, a beautiful Oktoberfest. it pours a dark amber with a 2 fingered white head. the smell is of toasted malts. The taste is big on toasted malts with a wonderful cramy mouthfeel. A highly drinkable beer, and it could be the best Oktoberfest out on the market."
"Well carbonated on the lighter side of medium. Clean tasting and very drinkable. I would love to have this fresh at Oktoberfest in Germany with their traditional food. Some day..."
"D- Very drinkable."
"The nose on the beer is the usually oktoberfest/lager smell with a bit of biscuit. The colour of the beer is a light copper colour with a lot of carbonation. The head is about one inch and has pretty good retention. The beer could be slightly more dark. The beer has an initial bite from the lagering, then continues through some sweetness and some biscuit flavours. There is a slight taste of something roasted as well that brings a nice balance to everything in the beer. The beer is really damn good and a bit more bitter than I expected, but it works very well! The mouthfeel is almost perfect. It's creamy and crisp. Pretty drinkable beer, like pretty much all Oktoberfests."
"I would recommend this Oktoberfest-Marzen to anyone who is longing for a classic German Munich Oktoberfest Marzen."
"This beer offers excellent drinkability, great alcohol balance to coincide with the flavor offerings, something I could drink all night on a nice autumn eve ning."
"Drinkability: This is the most refreshing Octoberfest beer I've had this year. This is the ideal beer to drink on a warm Autumn day, espcially while sitting back and relaxing. This is also a great session beer, and perfect for enjoying while watching a football game. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this fine Marzen. It will make you appreciate the month of October even more."
"Pours a crystal clear light copper color with a two finger cloudy white head made up of little buttles with solid retention and light spidery lacing. Aromas of sweet citrus, toffee, and caramel. Toasted malt flavors, biscuity and grainy with a sweet orange citrusy finish. Mdeium carbonation, medium body, very clean and crsip and full of malty goodness."
"Poured into a glass from a 500ml bottle. Great amber color, fairly clear, with a big head on it. Dry fruity taste, with a fleeting (metallic?) aftertaste at first. Fairly clean drinking, mouthfeel is crisp and light. Not my favorite Oktoberfest by a long shot but its not bad, well other than that aftertaste. I think I must have had a bad bottle, or an old bottle."
"A nice beer, indeed. I'll definitely have again and again."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a maltier o-fest but still pretty light and easy drinking. Not the most complex, perhaps a bit dumb downed, but at least it looks like it should!"
"500 mL bottle of Oktober Fest-Marzen from Ayinger. The beer pours a crystal clear amber color with a big off-white head. Aroma is malt with a hint of husky grass. Decent body as it streams across the palate. The flavors seem very raw: grain, crackers, and a little caramel sweetness. A slight bitterness at the end. This is an alright beer, but not the best of the style."
"Pours translucent amber, not completely transparent like most festbiers. Head is white and full, good lacing as well. Nose is fruity with roasty malts. Taste is full and rich, good balance of malts, slight hops and spice. Refreshing but not too thin."
"Pours a vibrat, clear yellow pine color with a creamy, puffy white head. Smells so sweet. Bready, some brown sugar, red apples, some floral hops in the background. Wonderful. Taste begins with a very nice white bread, toasted short bread, white grapes and a bright red apple sweetness, with a crisp, refreshing citrusy finish. Incredibly drinkable. Leaves you yerning for more. Best of the season so far."
"Very drinkable, no shame or risk in offering this choice to an oktoberfest newcomer."
"The Ayinger fest offering pours a perfect warming orange brown color with a beautiful creamy white head and lots of visible rising carbonation. Lots of clean toasty malts on the nose with a subtle nutty character. While tasting, lots of crisp, smokey malts, biscuit tones and a good citrusy hop twang and spice lingering towards the finish. The bitter hops meld with the smokey malts into the after taste. Very well balanced and highly drinkable. This is a great example of what Oktoberfest biers are all about."
"It's zesty, lively, easily drinkable, and quite tasty."
"Poured light brown in color. I had a hard pour and I think it paid off. Decent head that lasted. Head was off white in color. Had some decent lacing. Smelled of malt, a hint of alcohol, and caramel. Tasted ever so lightly sweet. With caramel and maybe a hint of coffee. Reminded me of a light dark beer. Felt good in the mouth. Probably a little on the light side. Carbonation was good. If you was at a party and wanted to use this as a session beer, you would of made a good choice. I think it would be good outside at a campfire with a light jacket on and enjoying a October evening."
"Pours clear bright amber, almost sparkling with a very thick off-white head made up of tiny uniform bubbles. The head dissipates kind of quickly but stays around nonetheless and leaves a decent lace. Smells malty and maybe a little nutty. Tastes clean and a little light with nice malt base and a lightly hopped aftertaste. Smooth and refreshing with a slightly creamy texture, medium body and active carbonation and a crisp finish. This is a solid Octoberfest offering from Germany and worth a try."
"D: Really drinkable, I'm enjoying this one!"
"While a little on the heavy side from the abundant malt profile this drinks very easily. A good ol' standby for Fest season."
"An amazingly drinkable brew; one of the best Oktoberfests I've tried yet. The half-liter just wasn't enough. Ayinger's take on the style is extremely distinct and most definitely rivals Spaten's original."
"Ayinger's Marzen is one of my favorite examples of the style, along with Bell's seasonal offering."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Incredibly crisp while still maintaining a light malty sweetness - this is what marzens are all about. Peaches and honey come to mind here. Appropriately light bodied and dry in the finish with a hint of flowery hops. I've got nothing bad to say about this one - simply great stuff."
"Very drinkable and refreshing."
"MF&D - Very good Oktoberfest beer. Goes down easily, with plenty of flavor."
"D: Very drinkable beer and well worth a try."
"D - Leave it to the German's to make a great Oktober Fest-Marzen. This is a great beer from a great brewery."
"An exception Octoberfest for sure. Highly drinkable."
"A reddish-orange pour results in a two-finger, thick and rolling tan head. Retention is excellent, and a slight, but consistent lacing is left behind. Smells of sweet malts, caramel, and some spice. An undercurrent of fruit is present, but almost goes unnoticed. Tastes spicy and malty with some hoppy balance in the end. Very tasty, very interesting. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, and this one's fairly well carbonated. Drinkability is excellent with the tastiness in no way limiting it's smoothness going down the gullet. The best Oktoberfest I've had so far."
"D: Smooth as a marzen can be. Tasty, refreshing and tremendous alongside virtually any cuisine I would imagine. We have a winner here. The taste and aftertaste lets you know what so many others are missing in their effort on this style."
"M&D--Again, a little too much pine for this lumberjack. Other than that no complaints. Carbonation was spot on, and it had an easy creaminess that smoothed the ride out amid the tongue-parching. If I liked hops a lot more I'd order plenty of this, rather than the Paulaner, which so far is my favorite in this style."
"D. The drinkability is over the top. A smooth drinker with a warming of flavors. I could drink this beer all night long. A light body and easy to drink."
"Pour a cloudy yellow with a thick white head. Smelled of malts and spices. It was a very thin beer, almost no body to it, but very easy to drink. Tasted of average malts with a faint hint or caramel. Not to much going on with the flavor. Dont get me wrong its a good beer, but it doesnt compare to some other Oktoberfest-Marzens. I still say try it."
"Nice O-fest from Ayinger not the best of zee german's I've had, but definitely a worthy offering."
"Pours a huge, two-finger head that died very slowly with immense lacings on top of an orange body that looked beautiful. Some sweet malts, caramel mostly. OK, a lot of caramel, like a liquid Caramello bar. Some spices also in there. Medium bodied and a little fluffy, this beer is real smooth and has some creamniess to it. Still complemented with a hop bite that is mixed in well, there is a sweet malt taste that pervades in this beer yet has a perfect counterpoint in a dry finish (finish has some nice hops and a little spiciness). I am not an expert in Oktoberfest beers, but this was tasty and not overpowered by spices like other ones I've had. I'd recommend this as a must try for any Oktoberfest beer fan."
"Orangish-gold with a very light chill haze forms a fluffy white head of fine bubbles with excellent retention, leaving nice sheets of lace. Moderately-strong carbonation. Aroma is predominately bavarian lager yeast with a clean profile, sweet pale and crystal malts, and round hops, similar to a Harp Lager but with more sweetness. Flavor profile is very clean. Wet, mid-bodied mouthfeel and mild malt sweetness makes it an extremely drinkable session brew. Starts with delicately spicy hops but fades into a subtle grainy Munich/Crystal malt sweetness. Hops are used very delicately, adding to the initial complexity but lending to an extremely drinkable brew without risking taste-bud fatigue. Mild to moderate pleasant well-balanced bitterness. Sweet grain husk lingers on the palate. Throughly enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"One of the better O-fest brews I've had the pleasure of drinking!"
"M + D: Kinda slick, with a lingering taste on the finish. Crisp carbonation, and a little oiliness. A pleasant example of the style... another, please!"
"Poured 16.9 oz bottle into 20 oz mug. Nice golden amber color with 1 finger white head that fully diminished in a couple of minutes with light lacing. Malty aroma with no hops. Full bodied, moderately sweet taste that lasts through to finish as to be expected with this style. This is a good example of a MarzenOktoberfest."
"This is a very good example of a good Oktoberfest lager. Eminently drinkable, yet each one has enough character that you know you're not just throwing down Perrier. It's not always easy to get that balance between character and drinkability, yet Ayinger does it quite well with this brew. If you can locate this one, it's well worth seeking out."
"D - Overall, a great Oktoberfest style beer. I could definitely see myself drinking more of these this fall. A great find IMO."
"Pours a clear amber color with a small, white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of grains, yeast, slight caramel. Tastes of more german malts, light grains, yeastiness, very light hop bitterness, and a very delicate caramel flavor. Mouthfeel is light yet slightly creamy, good carbonation and crisp finish. Pretty drinkable but not my favorite of the style."
"D- Drinkable, but could be a little more complex."
"Pours a orangish copper in color. There is a huge, fluffy white head on the pour. Not a lot in the nose of this beer at all. Taste is lots of malt. There's a hint of nut and spice in the flavor. Very creamy on the mouthfeel and very easy drinking. This one will be gone before I realize it."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Nice flavors and low alcohol make this a nice Oktoberfest session. It also destroys most of it's American counterparts IMO."
"D: Drinkable, but man I felt like I just ate a steak dinner after drinking this beer. Not sure I could drink more than one bottle at a time."
"Caramel malt dominates first taste followed by mild hop, citrus tone. Alcohol warms at finish."
"taste is watery at first then thickens up, malt, touch of roasted nuts, caramel comes through in the back, bread dough, end is a tad chewy and leave the mouth oily, slight bitter aftertaste."
"Worth a try if you can find it!"
"This beer is quite nice and approachable - a good session beer."
"Pours a light amber color with a massive head that's slow to recede, leaving behind nice lacing along the imperial pint glass. Aroma of some spiced apple cider, hints of caramel and very light hopping. Flavor is on par with the nose. A bit of apple spice, sweet caramel malts, fruity in a way, slightly bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not much carbonation in this one. Changing these two aspects would really help the flavor. A decent OFest. I was expecting more coming from this brewery, but I feel like I was somewhat let down."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a nice fluffy white head. Nose has good graininess and a bit of clear malt. Taste follows a solid lagery grain taste with some amped up malt presence (relatively speaking). Some breadiness in here as well. A touch of spice. A nice slight euro hop nip. Mouthfeel is quite nice, and drinkability is very solid as well. Glad to see these hitting the shelves again, as oktoberfest is right around the corner!!!"
"D- smooth and refreshing, flavorful at fridge temp but more complex a little warmer. i've always thought this style wouldn't suit me but brau von aying has changed my mind. thanks to the bier depot for having the best selection of german beer around. i feel like putting on a funny hat and smashing mugs with buddies. prost!"
"Taste is full of sweet malt as is expected for the style. Finish is bitter from the hops and is a bit dry. Pretty decent Oktoberfest but not my favorite, definitely prefer the Paulaner as far as the Germans go. Still drinks pretty easy though."
"D- Easy to drink I just think there are better examples of the style."
"4/3.5/3.5/3/3.5"
"Served in a tumbler. Poured a translucent amber with a dense, two inch off-white head. Some spotty strands of lacing present durng the tasting. Nose is mild; however, the sweetness and the malty backbone can't be missed. Taste consisent with nose. Caramel quality also revealed once consumed. Strongly biscuity in nature, but I also picked up a bit of skunkiness as the brew began to warm, lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel was between light- and medium-bodied with a balanced amount of carbonation. Solid example of the style. Went down easy and alcohol was well-hidden, but not my favorite."
"D - Great and as easy drinking as any decent marzen. A little disappointed by some of the grainy aspects but solid nonetheless."
"D: Easy drinking and tasty. Might get lost a bit in the crowd, especially with limited quantities."
"D- 5.8% isn't terribly sessionable but I could see this one becoming a staple in my fridge for the fall."
"Quite drinkable traditional Oktoberfest beer. Looks good in the mug and drinks as this beer style should."
"This is a great standard for an Oktoberfest. It took a little while for the aroma to open up but once the beer warmed a bit It was rewarding. Malty with a nice sweetness, good to the nose. Pour was standard, medium copper with a nice white head and medium lacing. Very creamy on the palate smooth and clean, unbelievably pleasant mouthfeel. Flavor like the aroma takes a short while to warm up and release all of it's potential. Slightly aggressive and nicely sweet, there is a good bread quality present. Tops on the list for Marzens that I have encountered so far."
"Pours a dark apricot orange with a frothy white head that sticks around. The smell is malty with yeasty bread notes and some sweet characters from the malt. The taste is huge, very malty a bit sweet, with some bread characteristics coming through. The mouthfeel is decent, having good carbonation, a consistent flavor with a medium body. This beers large flavor makes it a great drinker for the fans, and a hard one to introduce to anyone who stays away from the oktoberfest/Marzen. Worth checking out for the fans of the style."
"A big fan of this style and a big fan of this beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Anyway, if you want a fuller-bodied, even-keel Märzen, try this one."
"This is a good beer across the board but not exceptional, definately worth buying, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Gotta love Ayinger, since they brew this ""seasonal"" all year long!"
"A very enjoyable beer which I will pick up again in the future. Another nice offering from Ayinger."
"D - Great malt character with just enough hops to balance and give it the high level of drinkability that characterizes a fest bier. An excellent example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, with that classic German lager balance and drinkability."
"Its hard to believe that light beer like a festbier would age nicely but I think that sitting a few months may have helped this beer. Could easily drink a few pints of this."
"Pours a hazy orange with a wispy head of small white bubbles. Aroma is of sweet apricots. Flowery. Apricot is the predominant flavor as well, but more subtle- not overwhelming. Medium body. Leaves a bit of a slick, syrup sensation in the aftertaste. Mild bitterness in the flavor/aftertaste as it warms. Good, but on the expensive side for what it is."
"D: Could drink this all night. Medium alcohol content allows having a few and still being able to stand up, and the flavor is the signature of German brewing. Feel like I'm in a neighborhood biergarten and pining for wursts and spaetzel."
"Cloudy amber pour with an offwhite head. Smell of honey, malt, and yeast, with a creamy taste. mouthfeel is bubbly, and somehow almost a gritty aftertaste feel. Something distinct about the taste that I can't place. Not bad, but not great. Somewhat of a sweet yeasty taste."
"Ayinger Oktober Fest-Marzen pours a light copper color with a thick off white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is a very nice bready malt. The flavor is also a nice bready malt. There is a bit of an odd metallic flavor at colder temperatures, but it didn't really put me off. Definitely worth a try."
"I may remove all of my labels from now on."
"A pretty good Oktoberfest, very basic, worth trying."
"Saved the best for last here, as far as my opinion and, I will admit, preference are concerned (after trying the Altbairisch Dunkel, Ur-Weisse, and Brau-Weisse). This one is smoother and more rounded than the others I thought with an even, sweet, smooth tone, and hints of grain that do not overpower the flavor. Yet again though, nothing overly unique or interesting. Just another smooth, fairly well made brew."
"First brew I had from Ayinger was their Brau-Weisse, which turned out to be one of my all-time favorite beers... although this brew lacks the flavor of the hefe, it is an excellent rendition of the style, with an amber goldness and smooth, exceptional taste that goes down clean and easily... was a pleasure to drink... not bitter at all, with citrusy aftertones and a bread and butter flavor that wasn't too powerful or overbearing... a great sample and definitely recommended..."
"Overall, a very nice experience"
"Very sessionable beer."
"tastes like a poor man's celebrator, similar flavors present just not as rich complex and glorious. toned down. malty, slight caramely, taste, not too heavy about medium bodied, alcohol concealed well, better than the spaten oktoberfest. good drinkable beer, nothing amazing but a solid example of the style."
"Great malty-toasted aroma, with hints of honey and subtle background of hops. Beautiful amber-orange color, with a big, very dense, pure white head. Flavor is great malty and toasted with a very balancing hops background. This is a true Oktoberfest beer, not the lightrer Wiessenbrau they serve at the fest these days."
"Overall a pretty tasty and well brewed Oktoberfest beer. I will drink this beer again, and purchase again as well."
"The only thing bad about this beer is that it is super foamy"
"drinkability - Good tasting Octoberfest, decided to get one from the source, and it was a good pick."
"Drinkability: A great beer for having a few rounds with the boys."
"Touted as a authentic Bavarian Festival lager. It's a striking amber colored lager with a light carbonation. A very pleasant soft, velvety head with a smooth crisp finish. Satisfying yet keeps you wanting more. With such a great body and taste/finish I could drink this in abundance. Great beer."
"Re-visit October 2009: There is a definite caramelized malty sweetness to the beer, a touch of some spice, and almost a toffee candied flavor in the taste. There is a touch of the syrupy mouthfeel and consistency, but just a touch. A nice Marzen, but I'm getting less enamored with the style these days."
"Immanently drinkable. So light, crisp and it glides down making it easily quaffable for celebrating. I really like the level of spices and hops, although the malts could be amped up as it seems a bit thin in the middle. The depth just isn't there for me. But, the flavor is great and full for such a light body. Very good and certainly recommended. One of the best Oktoberfests IMO."
"I had this fest-marzen from the bottle. It's color was a dark amber with a nice large white head that settled quickly. It had a sweet malty smell, but not overpowering. It's taste followed the smell of sweet malt, and behind that was a touch of spice. It was easy to drink with a nice mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I will be pouring another."
"D_a fine oktoberfest. Well balanced and one of the better ones"
"Overall, much different than the standard American Oktoberfest. It definately has an authentic character, and is better for it. It won't blow your doors off with big flavors or complexity, but it is a good drinking beer."
"On tap it had a dark orange-like color. Hoping for another great seasonal drink, I was surprised by its almost sour taste. It still had the ""Oktoberish"" spice, and it was actually a pretty light beverage. But the sour after-taste was really off-putting. One could even smell the slight sour scent coming from this beer. However, its crisp, October-spice rescued it from a complete disaster. The sour taste/smell made the drink just a bit off."
"500ml bottle, great Ayinger bottle cap! Clear amber lager, with a large eggshell white head, that its thick and luxuriant. Nice carbonation strings. Great creamy toffee malt aromas, slightly toasty. Malty semi-sweet caramel start, longer semi-bitter finish and a slight hint of hops in the after taste Very nice palate, just rolls over the tongue , but is not in the least boring. But makes for a drinkable brew indeed."
"Drinkability: enjoyable and sessionable, but fairly middle-of-the-road. Will definitely try again, just no big hurry."
"Overall the beer is very well balanced and highly drinkable. I really enjoy the finish on this beer, the tartness and crispness of it make this beer a real treat to drink."
"Very good beer, was very surprised by the taste. Would buy this beer again in a heartbeat. I am very curious about the other beers that Ayinger offers and how they compare to the Oktober Fest Marzen. Received this beer from Capitol Distributing, from a friend who works there."
"D- Nicely balanced marzen that seems to capture the essence of the traditional 'octoberfest' style, very easy-to-drink with a robust taste profile, this is an understated seasonal style and I would definitely pick up Ayinger's version again whenever the mood (or month) hits me"
"I have come to the last of my Oktoberfest selections that I purchased, tis a sad day and will have to go pick up some more if I can ever seem to get myself out to the store. So this one I saved for last. Poured a nice orange tinted light amber with a good two inches or more of head strewn across the top. A nice slow fade left behind more then an adequate layer of lace across the top and some very nice side glass lace when it was done. Smell was very nice, quite light and refreshing with a good amount of grain backing and a nice light earthy sort of hop tone. Definitely some spices mixed in as there was just that little extra kick to it. The flavor was pretty much on point with the aroma. A tight mix of grain and earthy flavors mixed in with a good amount of spice, maybe cinnamon or nutmeg, something fairly nice and had a good overall fall feel to it. Very nice light body with a huge amount of carbonation made it go down super smooth and kept it from feeling too filling. Overall this was definitely a quality selection and I am glad I picked it up. Superb drinkability and just a great overall profile. I really enjoyed this and will have to pick up some more if I can. One of my favorites of the season."
"Overall, it's a pretty nice Oktoberfest. A little too thin at times I looked for more complexity, but the fruitiness is a pleasant surprise. I wish I had one of those trees pictured on the cap that has Ayinger bottles growing all over it, that's for true."
"Not a bad beer, on sale at bevmo."
"D: I was really hoping for a true Bavarian marzen, but I have to say I was a little let down by this. Maybe bottle form is not the way to go with this beer. Ayinger will be at the Brewer's Jam in Knoxville tomorrow, so hopefully I will be able to review a tap version of this beer there."
"pours a very pretty copper color with a head that dissipates quickly and barely laces at all. before i can even get my nose to the glass i smell delicious biscuity malt, when i get a better whiff i can't smell anything besides malt, no hop or yeast scent at all. tastes much like it smells, very malty, but with a slight hop bitterness in its aftertaste. mouthfeel is good and rich, and drinkability is good, easy drinking tasty brew."
"Nice equal levels of flavors and auroma. This is definatly a well rounded beer."
"Light and refreshing with subtle malt complexity. Flavor could be a little more pronounced for my taste but certainly a great session brew. A well crafted seasonal."
"D: This is a marzen with plenty of flavor, but also one that rests on balance. Seeing as how I tried it the first weekend of Oktoberfest, this is great beer to kick off the festival. And with fall rolling in, this seems like a beer I'd return as the nights get colder."
"A nice, easy to drink Marzen. It was more about mouthfeel than taste, especially the dry quality. I do enjoy beers like that but wish it had some more oomph & depth. It would be nice to enjoy this with simple fare, especially German food and/or either a nice dry cheddar as a compliment or a creamy, smooth Bleu as a contradiction. I'd drink it again (especially with the aforementioned) but would also try other new ones if given the option. Certainly worthy of trying."
"My second in a ""Night of the Ayinger's"". I really love a good Marzen. Let's see how this one stacks up. Pours a light copperish color. Seems lighter than other Oktoberfests I've had before. I get butterscotch when I take a whiff. Malty sweet, kinda syrupy with a touch of alcohol. A bit of smokiness? Good but I prefer Paulaner when it comes to this style, yet still worth a try."
"D: Very drinkable. I will have no problem finishing this one."
"Drinkability: Easily quaffable and sweet enough to enjoy quaffing, but not so interesting as to warrant having more than one in a sitting."
"drinkability:this beer goes down smooth and if it wasn't for the price and the 6% alc one could drink these all night or all day ."
"D- A very good beer and a perfect example of the style. Well worth a try."
"Drinkability- Great example of a Marzen. This was a damn good beer. Made me want some German food to go with it."
"Poured a light but rich golden with a light shade of orange. The smell has a sugary sweet quality to it that I can't describe, but I also thought I got some sort of corn or off smell from it. The taste has the sweet maltiness you expect and mayyybe a little toastiness but you mostly get a sweetness from this beer. The mouthfeel was not bad. I thought it was a tad on the thin side, even though it is a lager. Overall it was a good beer and I would have it again though not ahead of some others such as Spaten or Sam Adams."
"This is a very polished beer, and by far the best of the style that I have ever had."
"Oddly enough a lot of people reviewed the beer as being sweet in taste and I'm getting more of the bready Maltyness and no real sweetness. Take it for it's worth I guess"
"Light malts dominate the nose; a crisp and clean essence is left behind. The flavor is slightly sweet, without any of the spiciness American versions are known for. There is a slight caramel hue, and the finish has a bit of bitter hops. To be blunt, it is simple yet refined. A great marzen without much fanfare."
"Wow. Definitely the best Märzen I've had yet. I'll be seeking this out for the rest of this autumn and autumns to come."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a very nice amber color and it had a very nice bubbly head with great lacing qualities. The beer had a weird smell that I could not put my finger on, not really pleasant either. It did have a slighly nutty flavour and a nice malty finish. I will buy again."
"are pretty much a sure thing and this one is no exception."
"Overall a very tasty and robust beer. The finish was a bit uncomfortable and only hope that it was a slightly old sample."
"Pours a golden amber. Thin white head,with lots of retention,and really good lacing. Aroma is of malts,and bread. This is a medium bodied beer with a decent amount of carbionation. Taste is of malt,and bread,and fruit. There is a bit of hops in the finish. Very nice!"
"Solid effort and a very tasty brew. Might not be my favorite Märzen, but it's right up there."
"a classic german fest lager. my first one of the season and it turned out to be a good choice."
"Prost!"
"My first stop on this year's tour of Octoberfests; this brew pours a clear orange with a nice white fizzy head that stays around. Smell is very dry and mostly bready malts and a slight hint of sweetness. Taste is smooth and semi-sweet, very malty with a bit of a taste of candied fruit, a little bit of hop bitterness there to balance it. Finishes very smooth and refreshing. All in all a solid Octoberfest, but there are better out there."
"The beer pours a rich, darkish gold color, with very good head retention and lacing. The beer looks very impressive. I don't get too much on the nose, just some sweet grain and malt. However, it does smell very enticing. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose and the beer has a very nice mouthfeel. Plenty of sweet, malty flavor in this medium bodied beer, with a nice long, persistent finish. This beer is so well balanced, so drinkable, it's a pleasure to find it on tap. One of the better Oktoberfest beers I've come across on tap so far this year."
"D- This beer has light flavor with some depth but not much. The flavor was ok but I just got tired of drinking it about half way through the glass."
"Very drinkable - it is not watered down so flavor abounds but remains very smooth and doesn't weigh you down. Get a couple of these to fill your oktoberfest mug on an autumn afternoon and kick back and watch the Badgers dominate another big ten opponent."
"This is a classic beer for the style and it is easy to see why. Huge recommendation from me. Get your drinking in now since it ain't available year round."
"just a little lighter than amber - like amber gold with a nice fluffy white head that sticks around pretty well and leaves some lace. smells malty and slightly hoppy like an oktoberfest should. caramel, toffee, a hint of cocoa, and some citrus flower apple hop. i would have liked the aroma to come through a little more, but still nice and above average. well blended taste with a sweet choco toffee hoppy character. the hops come through and the taste isn't nearly as roasty or sweet as some others i've tried this year, and i like that. very refreshing. body could be a little fuller, but i think it's a nice halfway between light and medium. i'll have another."
"D: A good Oktoberfest beer, Ayinger makes really good stuff, I find all of their beers to be at least above average in the style, one of my favourite German breweries, another good job."
"D- It is a pretty tasty Oktoberfest. Pretty much what you would expect from one and nothing to surprising."
"I'm always a fan of the festbiers when they come out, and the Ayinger is another good one to add to the list. It's a little spicier than some of ther others (although not as spicy as Harpoon), and perhaps a little fruitier than most, but the richness of the malts and the dry light hop finish make this an enjoyable and easily drinkable beer."
"Drinks too easy, finally a bottle that matches up with what I had in Germany! Recommended right here/right now"
"Pours a copper/ orange-ish color with an off white head. Aromas of citrus and spice. In the taste, earthy and a spice that is in the end. Not bitter, very smooth and somewhat refreshing. A dry sweet end. This was the beer that made me understand Oktoberfests/ pils/ lagers. A great fall beer."
"A descent offering. Like any in style, this works good with a plate of German sausage. Solid offering I would drink if it was available. Try it in a side by side to see subtle differences."
"It is a rich dark honey color with a light-burnt taste and aroma. It is better warmer (more malt aroma/flavor), which gives it a great hop aroma, very nice Brussels lace, I loved it with the chocolate chip cookies, light to no head, on style with a Marzen. Ayinger is a pretty reliable brewer for me."
"Poured into a Ayinger glass a nice clean/clear dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, tons of sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, slight hops, slight citrus, and caramel. The taste is malty, hoppy, slightly citrus, slightly yeasty, and a nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from Ayinger."
"D: I would most definetly be back to drink this one again."
"It's an alright Oktoberfest beer, but I probably won't get it again. There's certainly better ones out there."
"Poured from a 1 Pt. bottle into a mug, a nice hazy orange color with a nice 2 finger head. Bread, nuts, and spices are on the nose, with a malty taste on the tongue. A nice warmth is present in the aftertaste. A medium body with light carbonation, overall a good choice."
"Clean and somewhat crisp on the palate, and very easy to drink. The sweetness was low, but it seemed to be a detriment here. I'll admit, I bought it for the cap."
"since this is not a huge monster beer my score will seem high to most, but here goes: this poured a beautiful rocky head with durable, thick lacing to match, and was a nice clear amber in color. nothing overpowering in the nose-very subtle but great malt aromas, fresh bread, dough, caramel, nuts in the bouquet. taste matched the aroma. this is a great example of how to use and play up malts without needing to be a huge bodied beer. ayinger really knows how to showcase great clean malt flavor, hop aromas are almost undetectable, however there is just enough amount of background bitterness in this to counter the moderate malt sweetness. it finished slightly sweet with a bit of crispness for balance. this is a wonderful example of the style and very sessionable due to it's abv, mouthfeel, and finish. i only wish it were available in 6ers or mini-kegs."
"Good, solid texture with just the right amount of carbonation and a smooth body. Easily drinkable if you're into the style although one is plenty for me."
"Got a good deal on all their last 2006 bottles so I guess it will be a pretensious session beer for me in a few weekends."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as moving or stirring as some other Oktoberfests available."
"Classic German Taste from a brewery that doesn't always command respect. Pass the gouda..."
"Overall, very drinkable. Goes down easy and would be a decent session beer. Better than I was expecting."
"Wound up drinking half a glass and sadly poured out the rest. Purchased two bottles, though, and will update this review if the other turns out better."
"D: Quite tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, excellent representation of style, I polished off the bottle I had extremely quickly and can see myself drinking several of these over the course of an evening."
"The beer had a two-finger light tan head that hardly moved. The body was was a hazy golden-amber, with huge bubbles of carbonation. The nose was filled with a strong fruity, honey, bread aroma, which was a little sharp. The taste had a very roasted (for an O-Fest), thick flavor, like heavy bread, with light dosing of citrus. The mouth was fairly thick, too much so, with soft carbonation, despite the appearance. This beer made me grimace - I may have had a bad bottle, so I'll try to check again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight chewiness, tangy and refreshing to drink."
"¡Salud!"
"I want to like the various beer from Ayinger, but time and again they tend to underwhelm. Everything is done right I just don't get excited about it. The exception to the rule is their mighty ""Celebrator"" which I find to be one of the finest beers ever made, but that is a different entry. which leads me to their Oktober Fest-Marzen. There is nothing special here. It is a less than interesting octoberfest. Yet, it is fairly refreshing and only slightly sweet with mild bitterness. Carbonation is low with virtually no head and has an almost oily finish to the mouth. For that reason alone it is very drinkable, but also lacks any zing. However, it does have a decent fruity malty aroma and appropriate deep golden color for the style. Once again they did what was expected to make this beer properly and that is about it. Would I drink it again? Of course. I just wouldn't be excited about it."
"Mouthfeel is creamy yet light enough to not fatigue the palate. Should be very drinkable except for the touch of astingence which slows me down. Overall a very fine oktoberfest, wish I had a case of this."
"Drinkability: Highly sessionable"
"I do sense a bit of hop bitterness near the finish but the finish itself is quite malty. This is a pretty good Oktoberfest but there are others that I prefer."
"Drinkability: This isn't the best O-fest I've ever tasted, but it is definitely as quaffable as beers of this style are meant to be."
"A medium amber color to light orange color at the bottom of the glass, with a one inch, creamy colored, head forming at the top. The strong scent of malt is very dominant in the flavor, with touch of bitterness at the rnd of each taste. Very smooth going across the palate, finishes nice and dry. Drinkability, if there is a undrinkable Marzen, I have not found it yet. A good solid Octoberfest beer, I think I will drink the other two I have, right now."
"A very drinkable Marzen that I highley recommend."
"Drinkability: The Oktoberfest I would order in Germany, well, maybe not when in Munich."
"I have really gotten to enjoy some previously unavailable marzens(this one included) locally this fall and I'm pumped about it. Alas, autumn is but once a year. A: Medium copper amber with moderate carbonation S: malted slightly sugary sweetness with a fair presence of fruityyeastiness. T: Malts that are sweetened with sourwood honey and maybe a touch of brown sugar M: medium bodied with enough heft to bring the flavors of the beer through D: Very quaffable and smooth. Light enough to repeat but flavorful enough to satisfy. Prost Herbst!"
"Pint at Pizza Plant. No head just microscopic white ring, orange body. Fruity and satisfying malt mix with caramel, and not too sweet,toasted nutty understated in background.higher than desired carbonation.Medium bodied. Good represetation for style."
"Assuming from the good reviews, I may have gotten a bad beer. I was excited about it, but let down immensely. I will try to give it another chance."
"Ayinger poured just a tad more golden (less brown) and a little cloudy compared to the other two. Smell was bready with a hint of toffee or sweetness. The taste was buttery, malty, sweet, with a little spice or yeast and lots of apple. Fruitiest of the fests. Also the lightest in flavor and body which made it quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: One of the better examples of the style, but just a tad too sweet for my palate"
"Overall a very graceful and perfectly balanced O'fest. The key here is freshness. I believe this was the freshest, best-stored German import I've ever tasted - I'm so glad it was from this brewery. Simply the finest representation of the style I've ever put to my lips. I cannot find one thing wrong with this lager. Superb in every facet!"
"Pours to an orange-amber with a nice head and some lacing. It smells of a caramel malt banana with a slight whiff of alcohol. Taste starts caramel with fruitiness in the middle with a bit of a hop taste on the end. It has just enough hops at the end to offset the sweetness. Mouth feel is light to medium with lots of creamy suds to explore those taste buds. I could see my self drinking a large quantity of this while scarfing down some brats and kraut, mmm."
" I have to admit that I have never been a huge fan of Octoberfest/Marzen. Of the ones I have tried this is easily my favorite so far. Based on this version from Ayinger I may have to dig a little deeper into the style."
"-Oelergud"
"I wasn't too impressed with thing one, especially since I usually find quality from Ayinger. It just seemed too watery and flavorless, although it did have the sweet taste of a typical Oktoberfest beer."
"This is my favorite oktoberfest beer. Drink it."
"D- a very drinkable beer, my personal favorite oktoberfest, would be happy to buy/drink again"
"Well now, this was quite a treat. Best Oktoberfest I've had this year, and maybe ever. This will certainly become my go-to when I thirst for marzen."
"Impeccable mouthfeel, just so gentle. Drinkability is beyond a five, as glasses, even big ones, just disappear. Magic beer."
"D- Ayinger is becoming my German brewer of choice with brews like this. Very nice brew. The bottle version of this seems more raw but just as good."
"Drinkability - A simply good beer, and rather sessionable."
"It's supposed to be a celebration, bitches!"
"This beer pours a rusty amber with a foamy off white head that holds nicely until there is a little film left without much lacing. The beer smells sweetly with lightly toasted malts. The taste is also very sweet and again hits with toasted malts. There is the faintest taste of hops that balances the sweetness with some bitterness. The mouthfeel has a nice body wiht a good carbonation. Overall a nicely drinkable Oktoberfest."
"D: This is my first Oktoberfest that I've drunk with a critical mind. It's quite good, but that should be expected from a great brewery such as Ayinger."
"Crisp and refreshing with a hugely sweet malt presence. Caramel, ripe fruit and toffee dominate the landscape on this one. Slightly syrupy finish, this is very clean and easygoing."
"Aroma jumps out at you. Very strong carmel, reminds me of molasses somewhat. Translucent orange body with several fingers worth of head. Very full body. Malt and carmel dominate the flavor. Some roasty presence. Some hops there, but this is definitely a malt-forward beer. Unfortunately, theres just a hint of that roasted vegetable taste in it, I think. Goes away as you drink it. Not the best octoberfest Ive had (as a result of the slight off-flavor, as well as the flavor not being as full as it could), but definitely one of the best. I wish I could find it on tap, since Ive heard its exquisite that way."
"Fantastic. In a word. It must have been a particularly fresh bottle, as I've read many of the reviews here and I was far better than I had expected. I was pleasantly surprised. Nice amber color with a 1 inch head that lasted well into the first third of consumption. Rich, carmel malt with a hint of floral hops in the nose, and taste to match. Others with me who tasted it all used the word ""smooth."" Extremely drinkable. Well balanced and, surprisingly in this sample anyway, not too sweet and no distinct alcohol taste. The hops left just enough fruity bitterness in the aftertaste to encourage me to lift the glass again and again. I was glad it came in a .5L bottle. It disappeared very quickly. An absolutely wonderful taste of Oktoberfest--straight from Germany. And brewed (as you would expect) in strict accordance with the Reinheitsgebot. A real winner."
"Pours out a nice honey gold, crowned with a thin white hed. The nose gives off some soy and orange. Very straightforward taste, a pleasing light malt flavor, slightly bready. A light crisp mouthfeel, and a pleasent clean finish. Nothing great about this beer, but it's a good session beer that can go all night long."
"D: I could drink a few of these, and might very well do so tonight. This is a pretty good Oktoberfest in my mind. Its what I think is like a cross between a bock and a nut brown."
"The drinkability is pretty good. I could drink a couple of these at a time. It's a good offering from Ayinger."
"The mouth is light and not very complex, quite creamy and smooth with a dry, malty finish. Very drinkable, yet not all that exciting. Seems to lack personality and depth of flavor."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. A good flavorful brew that is not overwhelming. What is better than a Marzen once the air starts to turn cold? I think today is the first day of fall, too!"
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours a pretty clear dark yellow color with a red tint. The smell is exceedingly malty, so much so that you can almost feel the thick consistancy. The taste is good, but the best part is the small amount of carbonation that seems to let the beer dance on your tongue before taking it all down. There is also a tart taste to it, much like other octoberfest beers that i've had. A good beer overall."
"The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well. A good beer that should be tried each Fall. Cheers."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle with no date. Poured a orangish, copperish color with a ton of head and great lacing. Smell was toasted malt with some sweetness. Taste was pretty good for an O-Fest and had good mouthfeel. This is not one of my favorite styles yet but is growing on me. Gets a 3.5 on drinkability for now but could go up in future. Definitely worth a shot and a bottle or two each fall. (3.5,RB,Tie,O)"
"Body is on the light side, making it highly quaffable and enjoyable. Simple and tastey, nothing wrong with that."
"It's malty for an O-fest, but not at all overly so. It still finishes nice and dry, and the hops contribute some spice. After it warms a bit, I get some alcohol warmth and a little more mouthfeel. This is a tasty malty märzen that's great to drink."
"Pours a golden-orange color topped by a small, stark-white head that lingers for a while. Aroma of toasted caramel malt, lightly fruity hops, and more than a little sourness and diacetyl. Palate seems a bit off - lightly sweet malt is overshadowed by more sourness before the swallow, but finishes with a nice and mellow maltiness that somewhat redeems it. Body is nicely smooth, great for a marzen. If not for the sourness (perhaps I got a bad batch), this would be an excellent marzen."
"This is a well balanced, quite drinkable beer. It has the typical German malt characteristics and is one of the better oktoberfest imports I've had."
"A great representation of the Oktoberfest/Marzen style, worth seeking out. Prost!"
"When this is fresh it is so flavorful and power- packed.This is not only worth a try, it is a must try-just as much as sweet corn at hearvest or a purple red tomato from the garden."
"overall, a lovely octoberfest, very highly recommended."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel and quite drinkable."
"Overall an exceptional beer. One of the best Marzen's I've had. If you see it, don't pass it by!"
"17oz brown bottle with no frshness date. pours a cloudy amber with a creamy 2 finger head, good longevity and equally good lace. A lovely caramel malt aroma mixed with a hint of smoke and a cider like apple smell. Nice and malty flavors mixed with a decent amout of hop flavor and bitterness, although the malt is predominate as it should be. Detectable is also a caramel apple like flavor as well as some dried fruit flavors. A fair amount of carbonation and a bit prickly on the tounge. A nice Marzen and perfent for the season."
"Overall: A nicely done Oktoberfest, a perfect match for the cooling temperatures."
"Poured a golden amber hue covered with a healthy off-white head which is fading quickly, but is leaving small amounts of lacing on the glass. Smells mainly of cracked grains. The taste is a crisp, slightly fruity/sweet malt flavor rounded out with mild nutty caramel notes. It's very light mouthfeel and relatively low ABV make this an extremely drinkable beer. Very easy to put down a few of these in a night. Great seasonal, perfect beer for the fall, recommended."
"This beer is simply outstanding!! Nothing to complain about, nice pillowy head. Has a slight caramel flavor to it and a slight fruity twinge. Nice lacing down the glass. Fairly priced and dozens can be consumed in one sitting. Paulaner, being my favorite Festbier, has found it's match!"
"If this was flowing freely, I could drink this in-session if I were in the mood for a slightly darker-than-ale beer. It would be great with fests, with foods, especially with beef or wild-game meals."
"Overall- A decent tasting Marzen but very uneventful. Needs to boost the flavor up a notch."
"D: Not bad, but I probably won't buy this one again."
"Gorgeous pour, with bright, peach-tinted amber body and a fluffy, tenacious ivory head. Zesty, bready malts come through on the nose, along with some spices and vanilla. On the palate, a touch sweet at first, with some metallic hops then presenting. Round, juicy malts fill the mid-palate before a wonderful, bready finish comes through. Mouthfeel is big and well-rounded, with perfect carbonation. Very drinkable -- rich and smooth at the same time, but not so filling that you couldn't polish off many glasses of this stuff. Great oktoberfest beer."
"A solid Oktober, and very exemplary of the style."
"M&D - well balanced, sweet and hoppy at the same time, with a spicy carbonated kick and a great aftertaste, a well crafted brew"
"In fairness, I will have to try this one agiain this fall. I drank this Oktoberfest beer in May, and it possibly just outlived its life. As for this one, it had a nice copper color, but a thin, white head and no lacing and little aroma. Taste was slightly hoppy, but mostly watery. At mid glass, hints of malt were trying to enter, but were mostly overcome by stale taste. Metallic finish left me not impressed at all with this. Again, given the high ratings by others, Ill try a fresh one this fall...as fresh as I can get in Atlanta, GA."
"The drinkability is Prima! Remember this is a beer brewed for the fest, It is a pure drinking beer. Prost und Zum Wohl! MK"
"Comments: I likes this & would drink it again, but don't know if I'd go out of my way to find. Again, maybe the bottle I had wasn't the freshest. I'm sure it would be much better when freshly brewed..."
"Notes: I could see this brew keeping my interest at Oktoberfest. Not the most complex beer for the style but it sticks to its guns and produces an enjoyable true blue gobbler."
"This brew has a very smooth medium body. Drink starts creamy and morphs into a prickly, bitter carbonation bath. Taste is of bread or grain with a predominant rind-like hop presence. Alcohol presence is not as evident as is the hop bitterness. Finishes quite clean. While not well versed on this style this was enjoyable."
"big maltiness up front, and the moderate bitterness prevents the flavor from crawling away, since the malt character dies off. tasty, especially the aftertaste. very smooth, with few esters, and a clean malt profile"
" Definitely worth a shot if you see this oner lurking in your neck of the woods. I sometimes find German beers a little dull due to the rigidity of the purity law but this is quality beer engineering."
"I actually had this with some Rouladen, and it matched up quite well."
"D: An interesting Märzen, a quality and subtle variation on the type while also staying true to others. Enjoyable and well worth drinking again, either in these early spring days or during the fall."
"Drinkability: This is a good drinkable beer. It reminds me of drinking in a beer garden in Germany. It lacks a little something but whatever it is, its minor. Good beer."
"I've had a lot better Marzens than this. It smells and tastes weird to me."
"Hazy amberish bronze color with a huge thick creamy white head. Lots of lacing. Really highly carbonated in appearance. Smells quite bready with those German yeasty phenolics kicking in strong. A slightly cooked hop element is there as well. Taste also gets dominated by the bready flavors. Not really sweet bready but more doughy bread characteristics. Kind of toasty. A bit of banana there as well. Some trace caramel. A much creamier body than I was expecting. Thicker than I was expecting as well. The flavors are long and drawn out. A floral, estery hop flavor rides with the malts. Malty but not sweet and the finish is drying and lingering. Smooth, not as carbonated in mouthfeel as I was expecting. This is certainly a nice easy drinking Oktoberfest."
"This beer poured a nice amber color, slightly hazy. Nice size head with good lacing on the glass. Smell was about what I would expect for a Marzen. Taste was good, some malt flavor detected. Mouthfeel was about right. Not too thin. This would be a good session beer, no unpleasant aftertaste and goes down well. Nothing spectacular, I wouldn't seek it out if the Hacker Pschorr, Warsteiner or Sam Adams Marzen was available."
"Still quite crisp and refreshing. Very, very slight buttery diacetyl in the finish, but otherwise the perfect refreshing lager that I was looking for tonight. If only my friend had brought back more Prima Pils on his recent beer travels to Illinois/Michigan."
"Another Ayinger gem."
"Pours a bright and clear copper orange with a big fluffy off white head that fell quickly. Smelled of pumpkins and oranges, pineapple and all spice. The sweetness in the smell has a nice grainy and citrus base. The flavor consists of a thin molasses malt and some subtle citrus thats more flavor than sour. Finishes dry with a slight bit of metal. Mouth feel is thick with a lot of little bubbles."
"500 ml bottle with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a clear toasted amber color with a 2 finger tan head that recedes slowly and leaves some initial lace. Smells of dark/toasted malts and some hops. The taste is the same with spicy/green hops and some metal with a bit of a vinous quality that makes me wonder if it's a fresh bottle. It has a medium body with medium carbonation and, if it is fresh, there's not enough toasted malts or hop presence in my opinion."
"Opinion: This is a superb example of an Oktoberfest. This one is a bit hoppier than most, but it still manages to retain the characteristic flavor for the style. There is plenty of Vienna malt in this one to give it a really well-rounded and flavorful profile. I would highly recommend this beeror anything else from Ayinger Brau for that matter."
"Now this is what I'm talking about! The Germans call their beer Fluessiges Brot (liquid bread) and this beer has that quality in spades. When you drink it, the mouthfeel is truly beyond description: malts, rich, grainy malts in your mouth. This is one of the best Oktoberfests I've had, and that's saying something. Wow-weeee. Best beer I've had in a while, and I drink a fair amount of beer."
"Pours a brillant copperish amber hue with a thick and frothy beige head that retains extremely well...a beautiful beer. The aroma is just as good with a big caramel malt and toasted bread character followed by an earthy, grassy and floral noble hops character, very authentic and it almost jumps out of the glass. The flavor is more subdued than the nose would let on, with notes of caramel, toasted bread, minerals, grassy and floral hops and a slightly musty hay character. Mouthfeel is rich and full but not overwhelming and drinkability is pretty good. An excellent marzen; authentic, balanced and delicious this is a great example of the style."
"cheers..."
"Unimpressed. Probably won't drink again."
"Poured out copper with a frothy head that didn't quit on me. Smells of mostly sweet malts. The malts tasted very bready; reminded me of biscuits with honey. Pleasant hop bitterness rounds it out, but still lets the sweet malts shine through. Mouthfeel was sharp and bubbly and helped to wake up my tongue with each sip. I could see myself making this a session beer if it were a little less pricey. I wish I would've bought more than one pint tonight."
"Drinkability: An easy to drink Octoberfest. Very enjoyable, I'd drink it again, and would recommend it to others."
"Copper colored with a thick, dense head. Aromas of sweet, nut-bread malt on a faint lemony hop frame. Nose is malty, with cookie-dough at first, then a dry bittersweet cocoa note mid palate. Some spicy hop flavors are present just before the medium-clean finish. Mouthfeel is lively with plenty of carbonation, but not over board. Almost ale-like in the finish. Sort of an odd mix of flavors, and not very tight, almost muddled, but interesting enough to have another one. Slightly outside the typical German Marzen style, but I liked it alot and would buy this again."
"D- Excellent. Great finish. Great for an O-fest session."
" So nicely balanced, yet very flavorful. A bready quality of the malt was quite fresh and yummy, yet the finish was clean and even with a mild hoppy note. Very engaging beer that was at its peak. Extremely drinkable. By far, the best Octoberfest bier I've ever sampled."
"EDIT: As time has passed I find that I like this beer more and more. It's probably my favorite imported traditional Oktoberfest and I haven't noticed the thick mouthfeel as much as I used to."
"This is very pleasant drinking, though the flavor isn't really that much of a standout to me; the texture of the thing is very autumnal, and it begs to be sessioned. Pity I could only enjoy half a liter."
"poured a clear medium copper color with slightly off-white magnificient puffy head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is of sweet malt and caramel. Taste is caramelly, toasty, dry and hoppy. Finishes with a nice combination of sweet maltiness and dry hoppiness in just the right proportions. A very easy to drink beer that is supremely refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is mildly crisp at the start. Finish is smooth. Soft caramel tones linger on the tongue briefly after swallowing. Decent drinkability, not a bad brew to enjoy during a cool October afternoon."
"John"
"Drinkability: I could enjoy several of these without complaint. Smooth and with a nice malty finish. It reminds me of crisp, fall days sitting around a fire. Enjoyable, but not spectacular."
"Creamy on the palate and malty in flavor. Doesn't seem that complex. Not a bad beer, but somewhat weak."
"Smooth and very drinkable with a bit of alcohol warmth.."
"Overall: Eh, kind of bland for an O-fest, but it's not terrible. Off the top of my head I'd recommend a half-dozen others in the style ahead of it, though."
"Taste is caramel, lightly burnt toast, vanilla. lightly sweet with a balanced bitter finish."
"m - a light bodied brew very characteristic of the marzen style."
"Taste has some of those fruity esters I experienced in my last Ayinger beer. A little thin. Esters are a nice change of pace but not quite what I'm looking for. Good malty beer though."
"Probably the best Oktoberfest that I've had. No beer can be true-er to style. Smells solidly malty, bready, yeasty, with a hint of caramel and nuttiness. Appears light coper, crystal clear with moderate carbonation. Lays a perfect 1"" head and stays firm. Tastes moderately of sweet malt--giving a caramel and nut flavor. Noble hop additions offer nice bitter balance and a good citrus spiciness. Toasty and bready into the body and finish. Body is smooth and nicely creamy. Extremely clean and refreshing in the finish and aftertaste. Citrus notes gives an almost-mint character in the refreshing aftertaste. Dangerously easy to drink. Ideal for almost any occation."
"Tasty, has a burnt toast, nutty, malt flavor that is very drinkable, and not too sweet. I could easily throw back a few of these. mouthfeel is creamy, and finishes crisp. recommended."
"The mouthfeel is fluffy, clean; middling carbonation. A little sticky on the finish, nothing to complain about. A solid brew."
"Obtained from Liquor Mart (Boulder) and consumed that same evening. Pours a, whoa, four finger tan-yellow head over a crystal clear light gold rust liquid. The head eventually fell like a crmbling sink-hole. Smells of toasted grains and fresh hops. Tettnanger. Really floral hoppy and enticing. Hints of caramel beneath. Tastes watery malty sweet with noticable tettnanger hop flavor and mild hop bitter. Carb is gentle and mixes well with the sugar sweet. This is a really nice tasting beer. Honey, then burnt (from the tett hops) hang around. Munich malt flavor is very minimal. As the beer warms the toasty and a phenolic come out...not quite cherry sour. The taste hangs like dried twigs. The hop floral gives it a dried forest floor flavor."
"Lean in body, but unfailing in flavor. Classic. Quite a delicious lager here. Tas-tee, let me say, tas-teee..."
"Poured a cloudy, amber orange, with a big white head, good lacing and retention. Aroma had some caramel, sweet fruit and some breadiness. Very clean, crisp and refreshing. Some floral hops, not too bitter. Finishes dry and clean. Pretty decent lager."
"Amidst all the American interpretations of the style, though many are quite good, I went in search of a true Marzen and came across this. Pours into my German lager mug a toasted amber color with a white frothy head. Looks quite appealing. Toasted grainy cracker aroma, sweet and malty. Begins initially sweet, toasted malt dusting the palate followed by dry wheat notes and a touch of hops in the finish. Carbonation very lightly tingles the back of the tongue and lends to a damn smooth beer. What it lacks in flavor it almost makes up for in smooth character and drinkability. Good with pretzels and probably better with some brats and kraut."
"A little light in color, but at least its not as light as the Hofbrauhaus Oktoberfest. Tastes sweet. Mouthfeel on the lips is kind of sticky. A nice hint of smokiness here, and a toasty malt character. Poured a big frothy head, which is nice. This is one I'm finishing off the whole bottle after having just a taster."
"This beer pours a golden yellow. It is slightly cloudy. The head is fluffy white. It fades slowly leaving only a few laces. It smells fruity. Almost raisin lke. It is also slightly buscity. There is a faint lemon aroma also. It also has a slight hop escence. It has a slightly malty taste. The taste is sort of hard to describe. It has a toasted malt taste. The hop flavor is only very slightly noticable. Ultimately, the taste leaves something to be desired. Either a little more hoppy, or more roasted malts maybe. It is medium bodied, and goes down smooth. It is carbonated well. It might make a good session beer because it is not aggressive. It is also not to high in alcohol. This beer is worth a try."
"Apricot, golden copper body with a big, thick, light cream/khaki head. Good lacing too. Nose is full of bready malts, spicy yeast, light sweetness, and faint hop bitterness. Taste starts with slightly sweet, toasted bread malt flavors. Some caramel too. Peppery, yeasty bitterness early on as well. Finish stays bready with a yeasty edge. Me gusta. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. One of my favorite Marzens. Very drinkable!"
"Overall impression:"
"This is a standard German Marzen. This is a fine example of the style, except for the color."
"Pours a light coppery color with a medium-sized head like meringue. Appears very effervescent as bubbles stream up all throughout the brew. Smells of bread, raisins, molasses and brown sugar...maybe some banana in there too? Tastes predominantly of bread, like sourdough. Flavors of caramel and sweet malt are present as well. Slight astringency and a bit of a hop bite at the finish, which is very crisp and clean. Leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth. Carbonation is high, body is a little on the thin side. Not too bad, though. Very drinkable."
"Very disappointing overall and not fit for the style."
"Got this on a recommendation upon asking for a ""nice malty lager"". This delivers nicely. Appearance is kind of a chill haze golden color with a snow white head. There is a mild dose of biscuity type maltiness and some fresh, somewhat skunky hops in the aroma. Taste is also mild, with the perfect combination of hops & malt to stay clean & refreshing, yet still full & flavorful.Nice full mouthfeel with a good slickness to it, and as for the drinkability -I could drink alot of this but pine for something a bit more complex. A good brew."
"Drinkability: nothing special. For the style, seems to have missed the target. Not a bad beer, just a mis-labeled one. I've enjoyed several other beers from this brewer, sadly, this wasn't one of them."
"Clear copper color with a small off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Sweet bready, grainy aromas, light grainy, nutty and caramel flavors, finishes clean and dry. Light to medium bodied with a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, a well done Oktoberfest, I look forward to this every year."
"Pours an orange-gold, bright and clear! Large head of medium sized bubbles with a fair amount of carbonation supplying the head. Aroma is slightly sweet, with honey, a slight hop bite, celan and malty. Flavor is clean and crisp, slightly hop & alcohol bite at the end (near my jaw!). Bready with a bit of orange marmalade on top makes this one tasty brew! I will be happy to try this one again next Oktober."
"Sampled from a 17 Oz. bottle. The color of this beer is golden-orange with nice, creamy head. Mildly hazy. Aroma is malty as expected, bready and caramel aromas stand out. Smell isn't very powerful. The beginning of a sip is somewhat grainy and has some bite. The middle is primarily big malt tastes with some grainy balance. Finish is pronounced lingering sweetness. Like all the German beers I've tried this is easy-to-drink and well-made. However, I think I like the Paulaner and Spaten O-Fests better."
"Drank very easy, with a small finish."
"This is a delicious beer! Nice and rich, it pours into my glass an amber color with a big, foamy head. The smell is a bit like caramel candied apples. Mouthfeel is generally full and smooth. A great malty sweetness, perfectly offset by hops and carbonation. Very, very drinkable to say the least."
"Woo-hoo shared a bottle with David this evening. Pour was the best part, all coppery and topped with a craggy thick cream colored head full of peaks and valleys. Then we took some whiffs, and unfortunately there were some metallic notes that lead to: pennies from heaven, and then of course pfennige vom himmel hoch. We got past the silliness and dove in. Somewhat sweet, tries to finish with some bitterness, but the pennies came back at the end. Sweeter than I would have liked actually that was broken up by the carbonation. Not bad, just not great."
"Its a light amber color, fairly clear, with a moderately-sized white head. Very slight toasted malt and caramel aroma, with a background of hops. Light sweetness, with a mix of malt and graininess. Notable hop presence in the finish. Its not a bad beer at all, and certainly quite drinkable. Still, I prefer my marzens to have a bit more toasted malt character. This ones a little weak."
"I checked my reviews before popping the cap and was amazed to see that I hadn't rated any beer of this style higher than 4.0. Brauerei Aying's version doesn't quite get there either, but in the only score that really counts (taste), it's the equal of any I've had. These guys are becoming one of my favorite German breweries."
"nice amber color with a big creamy off white head that lasted a long time and had good lacing.aroma got honey,dark bread, caramel, with a little fruity flavor and hints of coriander. flavor the caramel took over than the malts, and honey and a hint of hops. a very drinkable beer"
"Pretty golden amber with a nice white headthat leaves decent lacing. Malt, caramel malt, dominates the aroma some light hops and some light spice also picked up in the background, coriander . Taste is good malty and zesty, carbonation tingles the taste buds. Finishes with a peppery hoppy combination reminds me of a witbier. Strange for a marzen but not bad. Mouthfeel right around medium a refreshing brew. Drinkability is good strange addition of spice, know against that German law to add stuff to beer but it sure tasted like coriander but guess it could have been the yeast adding some spiciness. Anyway it was a decent beer should be tried if you can."
"This big bottle(550ml) of German marzen went down like it was a 12oz bottle, why because its drinkability was off the charts. The hops and malt combine to create a smooth oktoberfest beer that has the body of one and the color of one. I will regret when I finish my case of these beauties. Ein prosit baby!!!"
"This is quite drinkable. While not what I would call exceptional, I'd be happy to quaff several of these at my local if the situation provided for it."
"An excelent Oktoberfest. THis one poured a light copper color with a nice head that left fluffy white lace down the glass. The smell was of hops and spice. The taste was great and not overly malty like some Oktoberfests. This one had a nice subtle hop presence that kept everything in check. That, along with a nice smoothe mouthfeel made this one veryt drinkable and dare I say, my new favorite O-Fest beer next to the Lowenbrau."
"This is a great oktoberfest brew. Poured very orange with a beautiful fluffy white head. Nice, sticky lacing. Smelled lightly of hops. Just a touch. Very malty and left a light roasted malty like taste in my mouth. Very smooth. Not too heavy, but not light either. A nice balance. Great example of an Oktoberfest."
"3. Spaten"
"Had the majority of a pitcher of this at the local pub. Pours an amber color with a thick, fluffy head. The aroma is caramel-filled and has just a tad of what I like to call ""lager stank."" The flavor had the caramel maltiness that I expected, but there is a hop and/or spice presence that just doesn't blend. This is one of the few brews I've had where I have drank enough to actually be totally full of beer and unable to drink anymore, without being drunk. Not a favorite beer here."
"I drank a pitcher of this beer tonight. It poured a deep golden amber color with about 3 fingers of head. The nose was full of nice caramel sweetness, enticing me to drink it. The flavor hit me upfront with caramel sweetness, but then came a spiceyness that was a bit too strong for my liking. As far as other O-fest beers goes, this was not my favorite. I liked the Spaten this year a bit more. The mouthfeel was nicely thick and a little creamy. Drinkability was pretty good, hell I drank the whole pitcher didn't I? I had this out of a bottle earlier this year and didn't like it, so I was pleasantly surprised with it."
"The beer arrived in a 500 ml. bottle, with packaging styled similarly for most of this brewerys offerings. The body was golden pale in color with a creamy off-white head that faded into decent lacing. The smell was very faint for the style, with only a hint of the underlying Munich caramel malts. The taste was a malty as anticipated but had a bit more hop bitterness and lemony tang than other festbiers Ive had. There was also a faint metallic twang in there. The aftertaste was grainy and mouthfeel medium-thin. Sessionable seasonal offering, but not an exceptional drink."
"Enjoyable soft malty aroma. Big, active, yellowish cream colored head. Streams of sizable bubbles rise from the bottom of the transparent pale orange colored beer. Mild malt flavor with a slight grainy bite towards the end, there's a bit of hops in there that cut the malt and smooth out the taste. Moderately light body and plenty of carbonation lead to a beer that keeps me drinking."
"The flavor is great on a crisp night when you are feeling reflective."
"Lovely, quite fruity, mainly apple and dark fruits, with malt notes of bread and light caramel. Quite sweet as well. The hops seem perfect in this. Impressive."
"Larger bottle, with no freshness dating. Pours a dull light almond shade, white allmost tiny bubble head, and leaves well developed and stringy lacing. cabadgy malt nose. This O' fest brew is slightly hoppier and spicier then others I've tried recently. Slightly dry and peppery finish. Complex for the style, decent quaffer/sessioner"
"Gorgeous coppery amber color with a great fluffy head. Somewhat subdued malt aroma. Slight breadiness to it. Upfront theres a malty flavor-slight hop bitterness and a touch of residual sweetness. Good body-a very drinkable beer. I find this a bit more interesting then the Munich breweries offering."
"Mouthfeel is medium and smooth, light but creamy texture. Drinkability is improved by not being overwhelming or too spicy up front. I would place this at the top of the O-fests that I've sampled, but I find that such is typical of this brewer."
"Brilliant clear amber with a butter-colored crumpet-top which stands inches tall. Herbed honey aromas tease the line between savory and sweet. Dense aromas of milled, raw grains are there too. Candy-like malt flavors are given thrust with steely, caked hop extracts. Mouthfilling yet light and melting. Dormant August grasses, fritters and honey sensations linger on the finish. This is a foursquare, progressive-styled Maerzen : tightly integrated, clean and clear. I'd like to see it age about 6 months to a year however. It is a waste of lager art to drink these too young, as they taste like malty, hoppy extremes of their cognate, light lagers. The material is there for development; patience will be rewarded."
"Drinkability and overall: I am suitably underwhelmed by this beer. Seems no different than a craft pale ale to me. Maybe that's what it should taste like but if I'm in a celebratory, O-fest kind of mode, then why not just break out a nice pale ale. This beer loses me. If you are looking for a unique Oktoberfest beer, I don't think this one is it. A nice beer but nothing out of the ordinary to me."
"Pours a pale amber clear liquid with a nice thick fluffy white head. Lots of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Good head retention, and some fair lace on the sides of the glass. Fairly big malt nose, slightly flowery and carmel-like. Nice malt sweetness, again with a carmel flavor. Some slight hop bitterness, but mostly malt. Medium body, maybe a bit too much carbonation. Overall, pretty drinkable, but not as ""clean"" as I would expect. Good beer nonetheless."
"(Original review: 8-13-03)"
"Pours out a dark golden/amber color with a nice head that stays with you for a while. Goes to lacing around the glass after a while. Smell consisted of malts, caramel, and some toasted aromas also showing up. Smell was also on the sweet side. Taste was average. Malts in abundence with some hops staying way in the background, but not forgotten. Some caramel then mixes in and lasts into the aftertaste. But turned a little watery and some alochol also shows up at the tail end. Not bad, worth a try, but I wouldn't go crazy over this."
"This brew is a somewhat dark orange, light amber color, with a nice foamy white head. Smell is sweet malts, light scent. The taste is mainly malt, with bread, grain and some caramel tones coming through. Nice clean hop bitterness also present. Light to med. bodied. Overall a nice bavarian feel malty brew."
"A very drinkable oktoberfest, possibly the best of the typical German brands commonly available around Dallas (Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr are the most common)."
"I, ironically, responded to a thread on the BA forum yesterday from Jason inquiring about this brew's availability in the Boston area, and I go to work after a day off and (queue heavenly music) behold! It pours a clear lighter bronze color or deep orangy golden color with a light beige colored head. Very husky and Vienna malty, biscuity aroma with a small, but not unnoticable floral background. This year's release from the folks at Ayinger has some hops. I'm venturing to guess there's some Hallertauer Hersbrucker in there. The hops meld quite nicely with the astringent huskiness of the malt to produce an Oktoberfest that is thirst-quenching and delicious. Very malty, however, not overly malty sweet, there's a residual flowery esteriness. Proof positive that there's hops. It's exquisitely balanced and wickedly drinkable. Each sip warrants another. Objectively, this year's batch has to be one of the finer Oktoberfests I've ever tried. A straight-up grain masterpiece with ample carbonation that keeps it fresh on the palate and enjoyable."
"If you're a stickler for balance (or hops, for that matter), I wouldn't recommend this. I enjoy big malts so this was quite pleasing to my palette. It is very sweet (not desert beer sweet) and sticky, but it is a quality brew from Ayinger when all is said and done."
"Medium-full body and smooth. Another winner from a great brewery."
"I can't wait to try this again next year and maybe some more marzens as i've only had a couple."
"Tasty brew from Germany. I like this but from the flavor I have to wonder if there isn't some Rye used in the malting."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It has a malty lager scent. It has the dry scent of a typical lager, but with a malty edge that smells great. The taste is decent. It boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good Fest beer; one I'd buy again."
"Big, off-white, crusty head on top of a slightly hazy, tea/orange-colored beer. Nose is malt-o-licious: malty, sweetish, buttery. Turns a little sourish with some cream and some veggies. A touch of metal in the finish. I like this beer. Nice and malty."
"The malt sweetness comes through constantly accompanied by spice. This is a ""juicy"" beer; it stimulates my entire tongue. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is high. This can be a great food beer with the carbonation cleansing the palette and the sweetness adding to the food. It would work well with all the food associated with the Oktoberfest. It still remains my standard for the style. I worry about the vegetal smell and hope that it doesn't recurr in future samples."
"Overall: A reasonably good quality Oktober Fest-Märzen lager that is highly focused on its clean malt profile, but lacks complexity and mouthfeel, yet is nevertheless very drinkable. Not bad really, and well worth trying, but not quite my cup of tea."
"Orange amber in appearence with a well retained white head. Light caramel aroma with a very subtle hop character. Very thin mouthfeel with just a hint of caramel in the taste. Not anything to get excited about. Not on the top of my list as far as oktoberfests go. This one seems to be missing the clean sweetness that I have come to expect."
"Drinkability  This went down nicely and would be well at home at a Bayern Oktoberfest celebration."
"Not bad as an Oktoberfest, even though it's not a Munich brewery, but not amongst the best of the season either. Once Ive gotten to my favorites next year, I just might give it a try."
"An amber Octoberfest that pours with a creamy white head. It has a slightly vegetal nose mixed with a malt aroma. Poured in an Ayinger half liter glass, this beer has a huge pillowy head. The mouthfeel is soft. Light caramel (Munich malt?) flavors that Marzens are known for flourish in the beer. A very quaffable, fresh example of an amber Marzen. The finish is clean and dry. Very drinkable, yet flavorful beer. I feel lucky to have found a very fresh bottle of this beer."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy golden color with three fat fingers of foam. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly hoppy, with some malt in the background. The taste is pretty malty, but lacks some of the hops from the smell. The body and drinkability are just above average. Not a bad choice for Oktoberfest."
"Mouthfeel seemed slightly thin (minor quibble) and drinakbility was high. I would like to try this one on tap close to the source, I bet it would be awesome. As it is, its a very fine O-fest!"
" Smooth with a bit of crisp carbonation. Nice rich maltiness at the start. Grains come in next while the hops balance to near perfection. So far this year, the Oktoberfests have been a bit of a let down, but this one is solid. The body is medium, and there is plenty of flavor. Drinkable, this is an all dayer. Good for the season or any time of year."
"A nice fall choice. Would go nice with some sausage and lentils."
"One of the best things about it is the fact that it comes in the big, big, bottle - I love Germany!"
"This beer has the best head out of all the Fests I've tried. Beautiful, fine-beaded head. No yeast sediment in bottle and very clear beer as opposed to previous reviewer (this was out of a 500ml bottle though). I found the nose quite interesting, subtle for sure, but there was something interesting in there that reminded me of honey. Definately malty, but some honey in there too, more complex sugars in there might produce that kind of scent. Definately a drier, lighter Fest than the others I've had, this one still has some of the malty goodness that makes fest good."
"Overall I'd drink this again if someone bought it for me, but if given the chance I would drink many other O-fests before this...I'm kind of disapointed because I had high expectations for this..."
"An interesting take on an Okt-Fest beer. Whatever the yeast choice is I think contributes to what seem to be ""off"" flavors for this style. Drinkable and the ABV is sneaky, maybe more than I thought. I would have more, but I'm not going to seek this one out either. Enjoy!"
"Medium bodied with a noticeable tang of carbonation and good drinkability."
"Golden amber color with a sturdy, off-white head. Nice rings of lace remain on the glass. Malty nose is complemented by some sweetness, mild hops and bread dough. Taste is superbly balanced. Sweet, caramel maltiness and a fine, earthy hop finish pleases the palate. This brew is medium-bodied and fills the mouth quite appropriately. Extremely drinkable. Great Festbier."
"A great O-Fest!"
"The flavor is malty and sweet with a clean, crisp finish. This is a very enjoyable Oktoberfest."
"pours a cloudy orange with a nice white head. smells of caramels and sweetness. big malt against a hop bitterness that does not quite equal out. the malt reigns supreme making this beer a little too sweet and finishes with a little hit of spice. nice smooth texture though make up for some of the unbalanced flavors, but not enough. this is my first year with ayinger, so i dont know if it has been better in the past, but this is nothing to write home about. it is decent."
"Very smooth and easy drinking. Nothing holding this beer back. A slight tang feeling but it does not hurt its drinkability. A nice beer but I wish the hops were a bit stronger."
"Average body and mouthfeel, about right for the style. A fine selection on a cool evening, although the sourness could lessen the appeal for some, makes the beer more niche-like. It's good, though."
"This poured out a golden orange amber. Bright and clear. Dense and creamy off white head topped this brew. Nice aroma of spices and pepper along with some sour fruitiness. In tasting, I notice the beer has some thick syrupy qualities to it. Theres also some fermented fruits in there. Its full bodied, well rounded and seems to finish clean. A very nice authentic Munich Oktoberfest beer."
"A hazy orangish amber body is capped by a foamy off-white head that holds well before dropping to a thin collar but leaves only minimal lace. The aroma displays a straightforward, lightly sweet maltiness. It's medium bodied with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives it a light caress on the tognue before warming to become more creamy and smooth. The flavor offers a somewhat caramelized, bready maltiness and a mild fruitiness. Hop flavors take a backseat, and it's well-balanced to emphasis its maltiness with a restrained bitterness that's just enough to keep the beer from becoming sweet. It finishes semi-dry with a short flash of alcohol and some delicate, spicy hops that leave it crisp and refreshing. Quite enjoyable. I much prefer it to the bottled version as it seems smoother and a touch more malty; a slight bit less fruity; less tart; and less hazy with a better head."
"Broad malt, a touch of fruit, and a hint a noble hops. Finishes fairly sweet (too sweet for me). Medium bodied, crisp, with robust carbonation."
"Color is a lighter then most amber with some chill haze, thin whitish loose head fades out quick and leaves no lace. Airy aroma of lightly sweet malts and light toasted grains, lightly crisp wheat thin cracker-like with some fainted fresh herbal hops in the back. Taste comes across with an even amount of light bready dough sweetness and cracker-like toastedness mostly upfront, midway tends to loosen up a bit with some caramel and light ripe melon husk sweetness mixed gently with smooth lightly herbal hops. Finish has some subtle malty mixes of sweet and toast things meshing over some light earthyness and crisp wood. Feel is a close to medium body with some lightness coming in through the midway point and into the finish which ends lightly creamy and crispened. Not what I would quite call a good O'fest, however I do like its subtlities, there's just not enough push in flavor and body for me to really take notice. I still wouldn't turn it down if offered, its smooth and refreshing and a delight to drink."
"Pours a brilliant clear orange, with a large white head that lasts, lacing nicely. Aroma is all malt - some toast, lots of raw smelling grain, and a tiny bit of sweetness. Flavor is of sweet and raw graininess, maybe a bit of hoppiness in the finish. On the medium side of thin for the body, medium amount of carbonation. Overall it is ok, but seems to be missing something to me."
"Lots and lots of malt in this one and that is a good thing. Pours out to a bright amber with a decent head. Nice smell of malts, yeast and fresh baked bread. Taste is quite good with the malt shining through. A very good Fest-Marzen beer for the fall season."
"Bright, very bright orange in color, with a very nice offwhite head. Medium in the body, loads of malt flavoring, some bitter notes and just a tinge on the sweet side. Itching for the hops detection, but I can't seem to scratch. Some carbonation, which seems to off-set the taste, something does not feel right here, but a great session marzen for the fall; combined with the cost and availability - GTG!"
"Amber colored beer. Good sized ivory white head. It has good retention and lacing ability. Great toasted grain aroma. Bavarian maltiness and subtle herbal hop notes detected on the nose as well. Great toasty quality on the palate. Biscuity and bready as well. Hops only seem to be around to offer a semblence of balance. Maltiness is somewhat grainy as well. Nicely carbonated and about medium-full in body. Nice marzen. I'm glad I revisited it and rerated it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but I'll stick to domestic/local out of budgetary concerns."
"Flavor is ultra clean and malty, with some toasty caramel malts. A vague smokiness in the middle. A touch of corn. Robust maltiness carries all the way into the finish. Very little hops, mainly a light herbal flavor at the very end. A bit of breadiness towards the finish, with a quikly disappearing aftertaste. Some alcohol is apparent. Full bodied, with slow, smooth carbonation. Top notch."
"This is probably a very traditional Oktoberfest beer, but I really was not blown away. Light honey color with a thin, bubbly, off-white head. Sweet smelling, almost yeasty, with some toffee aromas. Flavor was chewy sweet, with some caramel and yeasty notes, and a small bit of citrus coming through. Mouthfeel was a bit slick. Couldn't finish the glass."
"Very nice head, somewhat cloudy, coppery appearance. Smell was almost wheat-like. Taste also had a wheat-like quality with a slight lemony quality....not that impressive. Mouthfeel was just ok....just didn't grab me. Drinkability was just average...didn't go down that smoothly."
"Overall, a good oktoberfest that's nicely balanced."
"On draught at the Winking Lizard Tavern in Columbus, OH. This beer is a hazy bright amber color with a medium off-white head and nice lacing. The aroma is a fair amount of malt along with a bit of hops. Medium-bodied with a lot of malt from the get-go. The beer does seem to get a little spicier and hoppier toward the end of the glass. The finish is light and a little hoppy. This is a good seasonal from Ayinger."
"Ayinger pours a zesty copper orange tone with amber highlights and a huge fluffy cream colored head oh so nice appearance. Aroma is wonderfully bready with spices peaking through and not so much all toasted malt but more of a clean freshness to it. It's amazing I love this beer's aroma Hallertau hops tie it together favorite part about it is the fact that the flavor isn't overly sweet. Rush of well nothing it's so balanced it's not too forceful with anything rather this beer decides to harmonize to my taste buds with a rolling mix of spice and herb tones with a bread slightly toasted malt character and a very clean finish wow this is awesome. Not cloying so creamy and textured almost chewy and good, great brew that is authentic as the name Ayinger the clean finish is just great. Drinkability oh by the liter what it was designed for I'm about to get a keg of this stuff it's that great, can't wait to try Paulaner and Hacker Schorr and the rest of the German Oktoberfest."
"This beer starts out rather impressive with a nice orange/caramel color and sporting a rich creamy head the color of milk solids when butter is clarified. Loads of stick throughout. But, in the mouth the beer fights to be refreshing while at the same time trying to be a more serious brew. Perhaps this is intended as it is a fall brew and Fall itself is fighting in the same way? The flavors are very much caramel malt with just a wee bit of hopping that adds some twang to the finish. This is a decent brew yet maybe a tad out of balance. I also find a slightly annoying hairspray and beeswax flavor that keeps chiming in as I sample. I think this beer needs food, music and dancing German girls to make it more enjoyable. A warm pretzel with brown mustard would do."
"Pours a copper color with a little orange tint to it with a pretty nice head,the aroma is very doughy and and toasted.The taste is pretty sweet at first with some definent bread-like undertones,there is a dryeness in the finish.I like a good marzen to have more sweetness to it this is a little dry but It is pretty well made and drinkable."
"Medium gold color, large head. Aroma is malty and a touch sweet. A lighter bodied Marzen. Smooth malts, slightly hopped, somewhat fruity, banana and clove. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly malty, with a slight bitterness."
"This brew is quite a disappointment considering the source. I might guess that age has something to do with the off flavors, but it's not a cardboardy, oxidation flavor that's the problem."
"A very good beer, this is extremely drinkable. The pour from the 500 ml bottle created a huge ivory head over a hazy amber body. The packaging is great; the graceful longneck body is beautifully labeled and capped with the distinctive Ayinger cap. The head lingers long and laces very well. The nose is malty and also gives distinctive grassy notes. Mouthfeel is nicely balanced between creamy smoothness and sharp body notes. The sips are accompanied by very nice aromas of maltiness making the taste/smell combo very memorable. Nice balance of sweetness and a small bitter finish. There is a brief lingering aftertaste before the final farewell. This is like the last kiss of summer before the bleakness of winter. Superb Octoberfest."
"Nice hop bite in the middle of a lot of sweetness. Citrus flavors. This is a bright, cheery beer, one of my favorite marzens. In my notes I wrote, ""This is a damned lovely beer"" after my first sip, and nothing I tasted all the way down to the very last bit of foam made me wish to change my opinion. Makes you want to go out and harvest something."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden straw color. Wonderfully thick and creamy head that lasts. Bready aromas, sweet malts, little hop character. Tastes are in line with the aromas, sweet and malty with a mild hop bite. Refreshing and drinkable with a fairly light body."
"This is one of the very best, if not THE very best Oktoberfest I've ever had. Stellar in every way. A tome for the style. Highly recommended."
"The beer pours somewhat nebulous golden amber to copper color, the head frothy in texture, voluminous in size with nice sheets of lace to seal off the glass. Lightly sweet, lots of malt, fresh and pleasant enough, the sweetness from the nose is sensed in the start, with the top lean in feel, finish pesky in its acidity, hops quite pleasing in their bite, very dry lingering aftertaste. A decent drinking beer, not great, but good nonetheless."

"Presentation: Packaged in a half-liter brown glass long neck with a pop-off crown, served in a twenty ounce Pilsener glass."
"Poured slightly hazy and a golden yellow color, with a nice foam head. The aroma was of a malty and yeast bread smell. The taste was of malts and yeast that was some what creamy smooth, not sweet as I thought. Very little bitterness on the after taste. Overall, was not impressed!"
"A first time encounter with a tart note and vegies with any Oktoberfest leads me to believe that this bottle is past its prime. This bottle is undrinkable, and has been dumped."
"2002 release. Pours a very hazy orange with a big frothy soap bubble head. Aroma of yeast, bread-like and grainy malt, along with a bit of alcohol presence. Bread-like malt dominates the palate, along with a malty sweetness. Hops are along for the ride, but struggle to hang on, showing themselves occasionally. Spicy alcohol and a seperate spicy character are present in the background. Grainy and sweet dry finish. This is a bit aggressive for a märzen. That's part of what makes it good, although I did find the alcohol presence to be a bit too much for the style. Still great to sit down with a half-liter (or better yet, a liter) of."
"Dry, woody hops carry through.  Finshes with an apple grape...(dare I say it)...bouquet."
"It is a mellow Oktoberfest, a good choice to introduce a novice but unique enough for a BA."
"Orange and fall like in color, a really nice appearance, inviting to the eye. A mild tone of caramel eclipses everything else that could make strong appearances in the overall aroma if given the chance. An excellent body that is both smooth and lively. Pours with a nice head. A very rich and ingrained malt presence dominates every aspect of this beer. A malt flavor followed by a spicy touch and metallic tinge. Finishes crisp. Quaffable is not the best word to describe it, but it is definitely friendly to drink."
"A very light orangish amber, perhaps the lightest Oktoberfest I have sampled from Germany, the head is full and rocky, lingering appropriately.  The aroma is a bit muted for the style, I think a more upfront malt aroma is needed.  The taste is very well-formed, malty with caramel and a slight hops afterfinish.  The body seems a tad light.  This is a very good beer, but I still prefer Paulaner Oktoberfest."
"Hazy apricot color with a big, foamy head that sticks around for a while and then gives way to a light ring at the top.  Scents are rather sweet but unremarkable, a descriptor I would use for the taste as well.  The flavors here (including tinges of alcohol and citrus) lack integration in this medium-bodied brew.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are fine but not particularly noteworthy."
"Pours with big rocky head sitting on top of this hazy orange brew. Sweet, malty taste full of bread a little fruit. Beer has perfect carbonation and the warming of the alcohol and caramel on finish. I noticed a bit of a metallic aftertaste on my breath. Hops are there, but not too much, maybe not enough. Very drinkable."
"This is round two of Oktoberfest 2002.  Beautiful bright golden orange color with an initial thick frothy head that doesn't stick around for long.  The aroma is light and somewhat a bit malty with bready undertones.  The sweetness of the malts comes out nicely with a touch of bread and light metallic twinges.  The spiciness of the hops is there but doesn't jump out at you to create the clean crisp German character I am used to with this style. I could still swig my share this season."
"Pours a cloudy orange / amber with a decent frothy, rocky white headwith good retention.  On the nose the aromas are hard to pick out, perhaps a touch of orange peels, hints of spices, and biscuits. On the palate more of the odd same, touch of orange peels, traces of spice, biscuity, bready, hints of caramel, fruity/apple?weird. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. Overall a weird but drinkable Ofest that almost tastes like a ½ & ½ a Ofest & a hefe mixed together. I still enjoyed this brew though."
"Hazy orange body, topped with a great rocky slighty-off-white head. Aroma is extremely sweet, with an almost orange tang to it. In taste, some hop bite to offer a slight balance to the malt sweetness, but it is far too cloying. There seems to be a lack of depth to the malt, too one-dimensional. Some yeast sediment, but no indication whether it is bottle conditioned or just loosely filtered. Disappointing, considering the brewery."
"Hazy orange/amber, big rocky head of almost an inch.  Fresh aroma, some mandarin orange and some bright hay-like smells.  Stellar nutty malts, roasty with some toffee tones and just a touch of bittering that breaks in to attenuate the flavor close.  Maybe a touch more hops are in order but this stuff was tasty to me.  Decent body, full but not at all sticky.  Good drinkability."
"This seems to be Aying's lowest rated beer, which is only testament to the overall quality of their brews. If you ask me this beer is fantastic. Hazy deep golden lager with puffy, perfect head. Mild aroma with malt hints and mild spices. This is a mellow example of a Fest brew, quietly malty with just a trace of the typical spices. Crisp hop dryness comes at the end, forcing you to take another sip, and another, and another. Mouthfeel is just about perfect: soft, puffy and gently bubbly. Tasty cold, but even better at a more traditional warmer temperature (read: as it warms in your liter stein). This beer is perfect with herb roasted chicken, with a nice crispy skin... actually this beer would be perfect with just about anything. Shouldn't be just for Oktoberfest, but Easterfest, 4th-of-Julyfest, and breakfast. Ok I'm done raving about this beer, I seem to be the only one who really loved it anyway."

"The huge, frothy, persistent head is typical for style.  Orange to amber in hue w/ an unexpected slight haze.  Lots of toasty Munich malt in the aroma, w/ mellow melanoidin caramelized fruit notes.  There's a hint of spicy Hersbrucker hop nose as well.  A bit milder in aroma versus Paulaner or Spatens Octoberfests overall.  Very smooth mouthfeel w/ an ample body.  Malt sweetness and a light toastiness dominate, but a clean hop bitterness and Hallertauer flavor nudge their way into the flavor profile.  Finishes w/ a caramel malt sweetness and a very mild hop bitterness.  Although an enjoyable Marzen, it's not quite as rich or complex as other widely available imports.  That being said, I'll take it over most microbrewed versions."
"Nice body but I think the hops are too up front for the style. Not my idea of oktoberfest. Not real smooth, I'll pass."
"Notes: Oktoberfest in the raw, seems a little rushed from years before. Flavours are not well blended and out of whack with a need to mellow out some more. Perhaps the yeast strain is getting a little stir crazy also? Enough of the babble, this is a decent brew and might beer hard to get used to. Some may like it some may not."
