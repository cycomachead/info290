"Look is pleasantly...well...Octoberish. Fairly clear. Enjoyed in a stein with octagonal bottom. Head retention wasn't great, but it laced well. On the nose, it's little different than a Miller High Life, for example. As beer-smelling as beer can get. Sweet tasting, but as it lingers, more bread-like. Slightly bitter and bready aftertaste. Gently warms mouth long after swallowed. Moderately carbonated, not too thin, quite refreshing. I'm not generally a huge fan of Märzens or Bocks, but I can make exceptions."
"Poured from a bottle with a clear orange appearance. Strong caramel aroma with hints of grain. Like an amplified version of the German originals. More maltiness up front, more hops on the finish. Very smooth finish, crisp and full-bodied."
""
"Good example of Oktoberfest Marzen style"
"Not a bad Octoberfest at all. 1/4 barrels on sale at its held up fine."
"Taste is biscuit, light caramel, and a touch of hops.  Hits all of the expected marzen notes and is a bit sweeter than I am used to in the style.  An above average and affordable representation of the style, that I would consider getting again, even though I prefer other marzens."
""
"A decent domestic Fest bier"

"A really good, smooth Octoberfest.  Tastes a lot like their Shiner Bock but Oktoberfest is a better taste and a better finish.  I'll buy again."
"This beer was probably the best Oktoberfest that I had this year. The flavor and texture were just something I looked forward to every time I picked up the glass. To me the only real shortcoming was that the foam kind of gave up quickly instead of standing off as I drank it."
"Very good. Just about my favorite beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Kinda harsh, off balance. Drinkable though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As the Bros say, clean, crisp, and very drinkable; on par with Sam Adams Octoberfest, better than average, but less than a Thomas Hooker or Otter Creek Octoberfest."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, but overall lacking in depth. Almost no hoppiness is also a letdown."

"The color is copper with burnt orange reflections.  It pours a larger than normal frothy head for a Marzen-style brew, about 2 fingers in a 16 oz pint glass.  Shiner's label states it is best enjoyed in a stein, so I think I'll try it in that next time.  Nothing notable in the aroma, which is pleasing, fresh, and has a nice essence of malt. The taste is  fresh and crisp to start, but does finish a bit steely and mildly bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Spoetzl's own marzen is a more than solid reference to this style of beer. October is almost gone, but it's not too late to get into the O-fest spirit!"

"Overall- A surprisingly nice oktoberfest marzen that will be in my October lineup from now on, especially at a 7 dollar price tag."
""
"Overall- not much complexity in terms of taste. A pleasant refreshing beer. Not a bad session beer but certainly not the best example of an Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
"Very light malt, hint of breadiness, some cereal grain, a tiny amount of ""bitterness"". It's a lighter style in a category mostly dominated by robust offerings."
""
""
"Oktoberfest pours a bronze color with no head.  There is a caramel and yeasty like aroma.  The taste is very crisp, full caramel flavors.  Decent body and fell.  Overall it has some nice caramel flavors' not bad."
"Overall at least it's not a big sweet caramel bomb, but it's still a macro like tasting lager unfortunately."
""
"O: A borderline ok o-fest. Not very complex but still a step up from most macros. Definitely take it or leave it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"9/17...clearly I enjoyed more than the consensus. Light to medium amber, thick white foam. Very clingy. Lighter buttery malt nose. Malty taste bright and citrussy. Buttery taste as well. Quite bready. Solid."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Somewhat lighter in body and flavor than I would expect for the Märzen style. Seems a touch watered down and is nothing special though the alcohol is well hidden. I would not grab this one again though it was not horrible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.41) : A bit disappointed in this offering from Shiner. It's just too much like a stale bitter amber beer and doesn't have enough festivities in its profile to make it a competitive mar-zen. The finish leaves you with a pleasant true-to-style flavor, but the body itself is pretty poor. I'd skip this one and try a different Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
"An agreeable enough version of the style, and a folksy ode to the brewery's historical roots.  Not sure how this works in the relative heat of the central Texas 'autumn', but here in nippy Denver, it simply hits the spot."
""
"Simple, not too carbonated, interesting flavor. A lot more relaxed than many Oktoberfest beers. Pretty chill though. I like it. It's a pretty good beer."
""
""
"Enjoyable.  Good amount of malt but not overly malty/sweet. Whether it not it's a prototypical Octoberfest I can't say but the 6 pack I bought for a gathering disappeared quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Surprisingly tasty, super easy to drink. the best Shiner beer I have had. Nicely unpretensious, the sum is greater than its' parts."
""
"O: too sweet for my taste;"
""
"Clear golden color decent white head. Rich sweet bready pilsner with a light metallic sharpness. Earthy hop bite not rich and malty enough for the style. I could drink these, but there are much better examples of the style out there."

"I was pleasantly surprised"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"what a big disappiontment  somebody told they like this so i had to try it wow  big time bad and ok color with a taste like an old sock nothing more to say but stay away from this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- easy drinking Oktoberfest, but I'd put it slightly below average for the style.  The metallic finish was off-outing as well"
""
"Poured out a medium amber, clear and effervescent. A mildly creamy white head leaves a little lacing. The aroma is grainy and slightly astringent. The aroma is a little less abrasive, with some nice, if nondescript, malt notes. There is a decent amount of carbonation. It is truly OK."
""
""
"It was a screw-cap, so no Pop!, but plenty of Glug as I nearly upturned the bottle just to see what would happen. The pseudo-cascade settled into two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was Amber (SRM = > 7, "

"My recommendation; pick it up if you come across it but don't expect to be knocked off your socks with this one. As stated earlier, it's just a nice beer for drinking with the fellas not one to be enjoyed as a session beer."

"Overall I wasn't a big fan of this beer and I thought it was a slightly below average example of the style, it seemed like it was going the right direction, but when I got to the taste it started to go downhill and it had some off flavors that prevented it from being as good and clean as it could be.  This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth, a little clean, crisp, not filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and one is enough for me, any more than that and I think the off aspects would really start to wear on me.  What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance to me that was the aspect that was the truest to style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it just had some off aspects that hurt it and made it not too enjoyable.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find better American made Oktoberfest and I can't say I would recommend it for the same reason.  All in all this beer just wasn't for me, that metallic flavor was a pretty big deal breaker for me.  It's now one of my least favorite American made Marzens and it's also now my least favorite beer from Shiner.  Better luck next time guys, this one needs some work."
""
""
"Overall:  A solid Oktoberfest that is still one of my go-to Märzens.  There is a great balance between the toasted malt flavor and bitter, floral hop notes.  A nice clean finish to top it all off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a copper-amber in color with a good 2-finger head that stays around for a while. Some decent lacing is seen when sipped. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, and malts but not real strong. Pretty much the same with taste also. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Not as 'hoppy' as other Oktoberfest brews I have had at all. Lighter to medium-bodied. Overall a good brew."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange color from the bottle with a  2 "" head.  Foam lasts throughout the beer at one finger.  Carbonation is good.  Not a lot on the nose other than wheat.  The taste was disappointing. Some spice (cinnamon, all spice not sure) then a not so great"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still toasted bread in the flavor with a bit more bitterness.  Nothing extraordinary."

"The Shiner Oktoberfest beer was a good beer. I really enjoyed tge aroma of the beer, I also enjoyed the taste of this beer. I liked that it had a strong smell to it. I also really enjoyed the taste of the beer, it had some what of a heavy taste. At least to me it did but I liked and enjoyed this beer. I have always liked shiner beers."

"Overall: This is a very solid, very delicious American version of an Oktoberfest beer! Actually, it’s one of my favorites and one that I always get every October. Great balance between malt and hops and I really like the citrus flavors too!"
""
""
"O-average Oktoberfest beer, lacks depth of flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very typical Marzen style beer. Good typically rich color, decent yellowish colored head. It is what it is - it's another Octoberfest beer - not great, but not bad. (in truth, I may be getting enough of the Octoberfest beers, they are all starting to be so similar)."

"Poured to a nice full head with medium retention and not much lacing. Had a nice amber color, clear with a mild aroma. Some hins of malt and caramel in the smell. Had a nice flavor with notes of caramel and toasted nuts. Nice medium to full mouthfeel with a cool lasting aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seems to be a beefed up macro lager. I'd be happy if the macro lagers did taste like this though as the grainy, DMS doesn't come through. It is still a rather weak showing for the style."
"I found this to be a very ample and tasty Octoberfest. Malty, aromatic, flavorful, with a very nice marzen type body. Hops are low but crispness is high, and overall drinkability is nice. I could certainly drink plenty of these at a nice fall festival, or on a saturday afternoon. Good job Spoetzl."
""
"This is the best Oktoberfest beer that I've tried recently. You can't get this beer where I live, but you can get it here, in Sheridan, Wyoming. This town has an excellent local brewery and an awesome selection, particularly at Star Liquor. Quite a welcome change from most Wyoming towns, where you can get all THREE brands of beer- Bud, Coors and Miller."

"I like Shiner Bock quite a bit, but I don't consider it a good beer. The same can be said here, as it reminds me a bit of that. It's mostly easy to drink. Mostly. There are a lot of better examples of the style out there, however, a little bit of work could do wonders here."
"o: Not bad, middle of the pack o-fest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty poor example of the style. Not a good beer from Shiner either. Really one to just avoid."
""
""
""
"O) I've consumed my fair share of Oktoberfest beers, and I enjoyed this one. By no means is this a shitty beer. Seems slightly underrated."
""
""
""
"I really hate to give a Shiner product such a low score but this beer is just awful, I was very disappointed since Shiner tend to brew quality brews. The beer pours a nice caramel color with a hint of sugary malts, and it goes downhill from there. The beer tastes very strange, like it is stale or overly sugared. It is sweet and pungent at the same time. It leaves a horrible dirty aftertaste in your mouth and I literally could get only one person to drink one in its entirety. The first time Shiner has let me down, but I am still a fan nonetheless, just steer clear of this bad brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: Is this an Oktoberfest or a regular domestic american brew?"
""
""
""
"O - I think this beer is way underrated here. It's got the right amount of caramel, roasted malt, and sweetness. It could be a little thicker, but it's easy drinking and probably my favorite beer from Shiner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This thing went downhill from the appearance, to the smell, to the taste. I was disappointed since I like Shiner's bock, and farmer's ale, and since Oktoberfests is a genre I really enjoy each fall!"
""
""
"O: This beer has some characteristics of German märzens but seems a little lighter in body."

"Honestly, this Oktoberfest was better than I thought it would be. If you are like me, and not at all impressed by Shiner, this still may be worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
""
"If you are in Houston I like the Karbach Karbachtoberfest better and Saint Arnold about the same."
""
"Eh, not awful, but not something I'll be likely to revisit. A couple weird off-flavors keep this one from being a solid Oktoberfest. Definitely many better options out there."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 10/23/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden copper color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pear, apple, caramel, apricot, toast, bread, light pepper, and light herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with solid strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, toffee, light nuttiness, and light earthy herbal spiciness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, and earthy herbal on the finish for a bit. Some pretty nice flavor balance and robustness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good Oktoberfest style. Very solid flavor balance and robustness; and very smooth to drink. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"Shiner's Oktoberfest pours out orange, with a head that leaves thick lacing. The aroma is richly malty. The taste follows the nose, with a nice, approachable, yet full malty flavor. It's pretty mellow compared to most American interpretations of the style, but it's really nice. The mouthfeel is light and velvety, and the drinkability is good. Overall, a solid Oktoberfest that seems a bit underrated here."
""
"Overall, more complex malt character than anticipated from shiner. Not on par with the top examples, but a decent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Picked up a sixer of this seasonal from Spoetzel, says it is a Marzen style Oktoberfest. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top, I get a dry hoppy smell with a hint of metallic clove. Pours to a light bronze color with a pillowy, clingy and robust tan colored head. The taste is consistent with the smell, sweet up front with a slightly bitter metallic bitterness that lingers to a fading bitter finish. Mouthfeel has a moment where it is watery in the middle but overall it is a non-factor. Head has excellent staying power. I usually steer away from Oktoberfests due to being overly sweet, but Spoetzel has put enough bitter hopping in this beer to make it tasty. I would drink again."
""
""
"One of my favorite seasonal beers, overall. Love love love the unique color. I like that it has a similar flavor profile to darker beer, but I can drink several without feeling like I ate a full turkey dinner with all the trimmings."
""
""
"Pours amber in color with a respectable khaki head. Aroma smells of clean, floral hops and mild caramel sweetness. A trace amount of skunkiness may be present as well, but not obnoxiously so. Flavor is noticeably milder than the aroma, and the aroma wasn't especially bold to begin with. I would assume I'm tasting some caramel malt and mild hops, but it's so vague that it would be hard to surmise without having seen and smelled it before drinking. A decent amount of lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes, which is respectable. Carbonation lends a creamy mouthfeel and would be just right if only there were a bit more substance to offset it. As is, it feels slightly too thin and watery. This beer might really have something going for it if only it had more flavor and body. Without, it remains a safe, sessionable beer with naught to write home about."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I can't say that Shiner has ever disappointed me. I will look for some more beers from them."
""
""
"Not a bad stab at the style from Shiner."
""
""
""

"RJT"
"A pretty good Oktoberfest. Not something worth raving about, but respectable."
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that is very easy drinking and flows around the palate nicely. Spoetzl Brewing did a good job on this beer."
"A good take on a classic German style but I've had better. Glad it wasn't the hot mess that shiner bock was."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a semi-transparent light red with a small white head that dissipates quickly but leaves some lacing. Smells of some light aroma of dark roasted malt, but nothing too strong. Tastes of very slight fruity taste with the dark roasted malt, quite inviting. Light bodied beer with perfect carbonation, definitely a nice session beer. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
"O- This is a pretty plain and overall average beer. Its good for the money but Id rather spend an extra buck and get SA Oktoberfest."
""
"While I wish they would not 'purify' their beers like the big boys, Shiner definitely puts out some stuff better and more adventurous than the big boys, though they aren't one of the small boys."
"Shiner needs to quit being so wimpy and start putting out some beer with some flavor. They ought to rename themselves the ""let down brewery"". This beer tastes cheap and crappy. It's better than malt liquor, but so is mud. With bugs in it."
"Holy cow. I've always had a soft spot for Shiner beers. Ive been to the brewery and to Shiner (pop 2000) and have family there. But I have to be honest - I did not expect much from this beer, considering some of the other seasonals they've produced and considering the general quality of American Oktoberfests.. But wow! This is a tribute to the brewmaster. He or she nailed it. This is, at heart, a restrained beer. But at heart, this is a restrained style. It is meant to be rich and flavorful, but light, fairly dry and supremely drinkable. This beer....Lots of rich malt, no caramel or cloying sweetness, no hops. Just a clean malty lager, the way the good lord, and King Ludwig of Bavaria, intended."
"If I were you, dear reader, I'd pick up a bottle of Shiner Oktoberfest. Appreciate Shiner's above-average interpretation of the Märzen style. Appreciate the drinkability of a beer produced by a brewery that produces undrinkable beers (e.g., Shiner Light Blonde). Thank your lucky stars for the cheap price (if you live in Texas), but do not confuse this beer with superior offerings in the style."
"D - Excellent appearance but average in all other facets... The end results is a respectable Marzen which I would gladly drink again, but not necessarily seek out..."
"o: not a huge fan of oktoberfest beers but i would drink this one again."
"O: An inexpensive good Oktoberfest beer. Nowhere near as good as the better German examples, but if you're on a budget this could work."
""
"Shiner products are not known for their amazing, memorable flavor and Shiner Oktoberfest is no different. However, it is better tasting and fuller bodied than other Shiner beer and its crisp, highly drinkable personality make it a good choice when you want the taste of marzen but want something a little easier on the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer, though. Good session beer. Good for a drunken Oktoberfest session anyway. which is what it's for!"
""
""
""
"Shiner's rendition is flat on flavor and bruising with husky astringencies. Too dry, too bitter, and too hunky. Subpar finish kills the desire to take another sip. A blunder of a lager. 2.5"
""
""
""
""
"I think this has to be my favorate US made Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
"Not shabby, but not great. This is highly drinkable and sessionable, but it mises the mark as a traditional Oktoberfest. It's overly bready and a bit sweet. It was good once, but I won't pick it up again."
""
""
""
"The taste follows the nose. The malt profile is typical Märzen, bringing some nice breadiness and mild sweetness to the tongue. The hops are present there in there with some spiciness, floral, and earthy qualities. There's that nice back end bitterness. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer finishes dry with a lingering aftertaste that clings to the mouth. The drinkability is high with this one. This is a very good beer that is very easy to knock back. This is one of Shiner's better offerings and could easily fit as one of their year round offerings rather than just a seasonal."
"O:  A solid Oktoberfest for sure. This brings the mouthfeel and roasted, bready elements know in marzens. Subtle bitterness rounds out the sweet malts. One I will try again. "
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all a surprisingly drinkable Marzen and actually the first beer I've tried Spoetzl Brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a caramelish sweetness, a touch of toast and mild hops, and fits the style well enough. Doesn't rank with the major Bavarians but is easily drinkable and inoffensive. Worth trying."
""
""
"O: Not really a fan of this beer. Not enough malt flavor and too watery."
""
""
""
"Extremely clean and very drinkable. Just as smooth as it is crisp. Well balanced from malt sweetness to toasted flavors to bittering hops. A happy brew to knock back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's an adequate beer. I used to love this style and this time of year when they were released. Then I found better styles."
""
""
""
"from Shiner. I find most Shiner offerings to be drinkable and lighter on the palate, and this one is no exception."
""
""
"12 oz. Bottle. Pours light amber with a thick, long lasting, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of caramel malt, cookie dough, and some noble hops. Body is medium and tangy. Caramel malt is trying to balance herbal, leafy hops on the palate. Finish is long and hoppy. The brew is a little bit too hoppy for Marzen. Although I'm not a fan of Sheiner I liked this beer."
"Overall, a good representation of the style. This will be the only six pack i enjoy of this, as there are far too many others to enjoy, but I like this."
""
"A fair little beer. Too bad the taste doesn't quite match the potential hinted at with the appearance and smell, but still a decent Fall thirst quencher."
"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a copper color with a 3 finger head. Carbonation bubbles rising to the head constantly. The smell was of adjunct and spice, An odd mixture, But definitely there. The taste was of slight adjunct, With some spices, Perhaps some cinnamon and lightly toasted malt. Very, Very drinkable without being overpowered. The mouthfeel is virtually the same, A stronger adjunct coming through but it's still very manageable and good. Overall, Would I buy it again? well, I got it for free, And I would like to explore new Oktoberfests, But this was very good and spicy. So yes, I would buy it again"

"Pours an copper rusty color with about a fingers worth of head without much retention. Subtle aroma of a little caramel maltyness. A malty taste with very subtle caramel notes. The alcohol is unnoticeable and finishes easily. It is a very drinkable beer. It is nothing spectacular but not too bad either. Decent representation of the style. Will most likely have it again next fall when it's available."

"Dr: A very drinkable beer. I'd try it on draught, but otherwise it's just not interesting enough to pursue. I'd recommend it to fans of the style, but elsewise it's not worth picking up. This brewery has better offerings."

""
""
""

"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear amber with a thick, fine-bubbled off-white head. Malty aroma has a nice fruity note. Mouth-filling flavor is fruity, almost entirely apple, and malty with just a hint of caramel. Crisp, smooth texture is quite fizzy and leaves a fruity, tingly finish. Overall, OK if not outstanding."
""
"O-easy to drink with the alcohol virtually undetectable not a lot of flavor to think about just put in the glass and enjoy"
"This is a very clear beer that has a light copper tone to it, almost a burnt orange color and it’s topped off with a nice thick tan head. It smells crisp and has hunts a wheat, malts and some mild citrus. Its light on the tongue and feels crisp with some mild carbonation. There is some mild bitterness to it over all, some mild hops and some bread flavors do come through. Its aftertaste is bitter but not overwhelming and the alcohol is well hidden."
"It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. The finish was pretty much spot on with what I expected in this style, very crisp and enjoyable. The alcohol for the most part was well hidden until the brew got warmer. Once warm it almost had a bit of a cheesy aspect to it which got interested but overall not bad."
"Overall this is a pretty run of the mill marzen, but not one that I would turn up my nose at. It almost comes off as a bit of a “marzen lite,” but it is quite drinkable."
"I suppose that had I bought a 6-pack, I could have downed it all in one sitting. The alcohol can't be felt here and I was surprised how high it was when I looked on here. This wouldn't blow anyone away but for a night out with the guys, this would be a good choice to celebrate the season. Whether this is a worthy beer to watch during an epic collapse by the bullpen is another matter."
"Overall Impression - Very drinkable enjoyable interpretation of the style. Somewhat lacking in malt depth."
"O: Enjoyable brew that is worth repeating."
"O: Great fall session beer."
"I really enjoyed it. A bit watery for the style, and hoppy but still a solid beer."
"O: This beer wasnt bad at all. Above average and one of the few I have enjoyed from Spoetzl."
"O- Decent for the Octoberfest style, but nothing stands out in this one"
"Overall: I really wasn't impressed with this one from a bottle. Then I tried it on tap and the taste was much more promising. Interesting how much of a difference ""fresh"" makes. This is a good ""stepping stone"" beer for those unfamiliar with O-fest brews."
"12 oz bottle pours a crystal clear reddish amber with a short lived small off-white head. Aroma of toasted barley, malt some light grassy fruitiness. Taste is sweet toasted caramel malt, yeasty light breadiness, wit some fruity notes and light bitterness. Palate is medium crisp body, with nice carbonation. Finish is lightly toasted sweet caramel malt, yeasty, bready some light grassy and fruity notes with some light hops and light nutty ending. Overall a decent drinkable Oktoberfest from Shiner."
"The taste is... medicore. Maybe worse. Some slight graininess that reminds me of other Octoberfests. However, it ends in a dirty and vegetal manner. Not appetizing. This beer is a boring take on the style that manages to finish in an offputting way. I might drink another bottle of the free 6 pack... but I kind of doubt it."
"Overall a good, easy drinking beer from Shiner."
"Cheers"
"With a fairly aggressive pour a small to medium, foamy, off-white to cream colored head that quickly settles down to a few clumpy islands and no lace. Color is a clear, medium amber with some small bubble trails. Aroma is beery with a little malt and a bare hint of skunk (grocery store cooler near fluorescent bulbs). Flavor is similar but much stronger - pick up the malt, a little fruit, and some marshmallow. Body is a tad on the thin side and carbonation is likewise a tad fizzy. Finish is like flavor. Overall, maybe it would've been better warmed a bit out of my cold fridge; but, I'd only drink this again if I didn't have any better options."
"Drinkability- It's ok. I would drink it again. It's one of those beers where you can drink a whole bunch of them. Pretty good."
"Overall: An okay beer. Drinkable, but not one that I would purchase again."
"Final beer of the night out, one that I had my misgivings about ordering, but it was the only one there I had yet to try. It pours a clear amber-straw topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises red apple skin, light grapefruit, light mandarin orange, greens, and toffee. The taste holds notes of mixed greens, light caramel, very light mandarin orange syrup, grass, and flowers. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly slick feel. Overall, a kinda sad O-Fest, one that shuns malt in favor of fruitiness and whatnot. Not my cup of Oktober tea."
"Overall-It just angers me that they keep putting out shitty beers and that idiots like me keep buying them(But at least they're singles). Don't purchase this crap."
"poured from the bottle into a pint glass, appearance light amber color with a light head that provides some lace . slight aroma and some maltyness.nice mouthfeel and flavor from this beer . found this beer to be quite enjoyable ."
"Enjoy! Cheers!"
"Nice light amber in appearance. Smell is good to average. The taste is nice, goes in good and leaves much better. Wow this is nice. Shiner Boys you did this right. Mouth feel is good, every thing you want in a beer. We here at barley road call this fridge worthy must have. Thanks Shiner."
"Poured on draught into a shaker pint. Comes out a golden amber color, light, with some foam that quickly dissipates. Not much aroma to speak of, even as it warms. Nor am I picking up any malty festbier flavors in the body. Drinks like a light version of Shiner. Unremarkable."
"That being said, I'm not tremendously excited about this beer either. It has a nice malty flavor, but there is nothing that really wows me. Overall solidly good, but not great."
"Pours a clear dark gold that this of a much lighter hue than most of the high end oktoberfests, with a white head with decent retention. The aromas a super grainy but not in the least bit toasty, which is highly disappointing. Flavorwise, it more in common with a a loaf of white bread than any sort of toast. It's very bready with a hint of caramel maltiness, but doesn't begin to explore the darker notes that are the reasons I seek out Oktoberfests in the first place. If I were to make a 10 item list of the characteristics I've come to expect from a Marzen, this beer would have only two of them, and they're the proper weight and texture. No need to try another."
"overall: very basic Märzen style, very light and basic, drinkable, but nothing to highlight."
"O - This is an okay oktoberfest. A little sweeter than I like but it's not bad."
"O- Not impressed with this one at all. A lot better ones out there I'll stick with them."
"D: It is quite drinkable despite it's flaws, but because of it's flaws I wouldn't drink this one again.. ever."
"O: A thick malty beer. It wasn't bad but I won't buy it again."
"This is a decent, but not outstanding Oktoberfest. Its a bit dilute relative to the standard and lacks much trailing sweetness. Worth a try, but not a ""go to"" Oktoberfest unfortunately."
"Overall a very unexpected treat from shiner. I haven't really had anything from them since the ""holiday cheer"" apricot beer and this one is equally as awesome. True to authentic!"
"Dr. Easy going here."
"Pours amber in color with thick, cream-colored head, leaving good lacing on the glass. Tons of carbonation. Has a grainy, slightly acidic aroma; a hint of caramel malt and floral hops, with some yeast aromas as well. The beer tastes malty, nutty, with some caramel sweetness. Floral hops come through, leaving some bitterness in the aftertaste. Thin and nicely crisp mouthfeel."
"Disappointing."
"O -- Overall? Eh. Shiner's Dortmunder and Doppelbock were so good that this, my favorite style of all, is just a little underwhelming."
"O - Its fair to say this is a pretty solid beer. I would say I could session this one easy enough."
"O: Overall, I am not very impressed. I look forward to fall offerings all year, and I am a huge fan of many German and micro-brewed Marzen or Oktoberfest beers. This one is less expensive than most, and it tastes like that as well. The color is a bit light, the flavor is a bit bland, and the aroma is no very strong. It does have a nice head, but other than that, I would not recommend buying this beer when there are much better examples out there."
"Pours to a foamy white head that falls to a thin ring of suds and minimal lacing. Color is a gold-amber tint and is light for the style. Smells faintly of Munich malt and caramel malts but with a distinct Shiner twang all over it. Flavor is nice but not as malty and sweet as I would expect for the style. Finishes dry with little lingering maltiness or hoppiness. Overall, I think the beer misses the mark but is not terrible, in fact I enjoy it very much. It is a great value and a clean brew."
"This pours a clear light amberish color with a decent white head with decent retention (for a shiner product that is). The smell is light and a little malty. Feel is medium to light. The taste is of sweet malts, a touch of hops, with a nice caramel aftertaste. Overall this isn't a bad beer, I'm not sure if I like it more though because I had so low of expectations since it was a shiner product."
"Summary: This is a very good beer. I gave it an 8.0/10, or B-. When I first drank this, I wasn't aware that this beer was the Shiner 96 anniversary beer. I can see why they turned it into a regular seasonal brew. It's simple, it looks great, and tastes great. It reminds me of a slightly darker version of Dos Equis. This seasonal beer is a great choice for Octoberfest, and I look forward to drinking it again next year."
"A nice job for Shiner and priced fair and reasonable."
"Sample from Dave. Thanks buddy."
"D - The carbonation drops its drinkability a little. Other than that it is a nice drink, but nothing to search out for."
"Picked this one up as part of an Oktoberfest mixed six a week or so back. Pours a medium amber color, with a decent amount of white foam on top. Aromas of caramel, lightly roasted malt and biscuits. On the palate, this one is light bodied, well carbonated and pretty drinkable. Light caramel mostly, but some apple and sweet malt show up as well."
"Taste is simialr, lightly caramelly barley and lightly toasty bread, hint of apple, light sweetness just dominates before light bitterness joins to make it dryish and toasty with some leafy, vaguely herbal character that takes over at the finish and lingers with toasty barley. It is very nice, an enjoyable, solid Vienna-type marzen."
"there are many o-fests much better than this one."
"Very, very sweet. Too sweet for me."
"D: Low ABV and pretty good flavors here make this a pretty good drink.... Little lighter than some of the ""Oktoberfest"" beers I've had this year, but not back. Another pretty good brew from Shiner."
"Overall- Not bad, middle of the road drinkability. A decent take on the style but seems to be a bit heavy on the hops and slightly oxidized from the trip up to Toledo, Ohio. Might help if they used pry-off caps? Could also use a bit more of that toasty malt richness that gives Oktoberfests a touch more of a fortifying feel and balance, without tipping the drinkability scale."
"This is a fair example of the style and, while you could find better, it's not one to avoid."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, yeast, and pale malt. Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight hop, slight yeast, and hint of pale malt. Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, blend, and feel."
"Drinkability - Decently complex, which makes for enough enjoyment, but could be more so...maybe this one is too well-balanced. Good brew, still, and easy to drink."
"D: If nothing else, Shiner beers are drinkable. Malt sweetness is at just the right level to make it appealing, and low bitterness makes it go down easily."
"D: This is an easy, sessionable beer, but it's rather boring. In Oktoberfest's defense, the style defines a beer that is more bland than vibrant, but with other beers like Woodcut #4 falling in the same category, it's difficult to dole out high scores here."
"An o.k. Oktoberfest."
"D- The beer is light and pretty low on the flavor. The ABV is not very high so this beer is easy drinking. Not the best Oktoberfest style beer but also not the worse I've had. If this had a little more flavor this would be better."
"D-It is pretty drinkable. It goes down well. But I won't be buying this beer in the future. Pretty mediocre."
"The body seemed kind of watery and the taste wasn't all that impressive. Perhaps it's my overly malted tongue at this time of year, but this one seemed thin and unable to compete with the others. Sorry."
"I typically pour my Oktoberfest beers into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. This brew has a light copper toned hue and a thin head. The smell is off-putting to me, similar to the curious odor of their famous bock only with a bigger sweeter malt aroma. The taste is less than complex. At first it seems as if it's much too light bodied and watery to be considered an Oktoberest, but then the toasted malts come into play and the beer ends up actually having a pretty nice finish. It may be a bit of a boring brew, but it's so unoffensive and goes down so easy that it's hard to down right loathe it. It's not my favorite Oktoberfest (by any means) and it's not my favorite Shiner brew, but if one happens to find its way into my pint glass I don't hesitate to finish it off."
"Overall, I believe Shiner has a done a great job creating another great U.S.-made Oktoberfest bier. I look forward to enjoying this some more this fall."
"Awesome beer, I could drink these all day. When I heard Shiner was coming back with their Marzen I had to pick up a 6 pack."
"D: Good drinkability. Not normally a fan of the style and the light taste and feel are probably helping it out in regards to me."
"i dig the shiner salty lick the barrell aftertaste and it carried over to this offering so probst!"
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Slightly creamy. Overall this is a bit subdued. Not terribly rich in terms of flavor and aroma. Little depth. Drinkable, but not a memorable example of the style."
"Opinion: Overall, this is a decent beer. I have tried it after a Spaten and a Paulaner and it didn't really compare at the time. Since this is my first beer, it is finishing pretty decent and will help the review."
"Notes - It's a pretty well-balanced oktoberfest, the but the metallic taste is unfortunate. I don't think I'd get this again, since there are so many better oktos around this time of year."
"The beer pours an amber/copper color with a white head. The aroma is toffee, earthy hops and surprisingly, some flowery notes. The flavor is toffee, caramel and light earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not one of the best beers of this style that I have tried, but one of the better offerings from Shiner."
"Drinkability: If consumed while cold, this would be acceptable in servings of three. Any more than three, and you're probably gonna be bored out of your mind. In fact, keeping it to two might make you consider drinking it again, sometime. The midrange ABV will keep you sensible for the first few. In terms of fitting the Oktoberfest style, I would probably group this in the ""Oktoberfest Light"" category. It has all the characteristics, but they're just not prevalent enough for me. [3 out of 5]."
"Not too bad. A little dull but a nice malt profile. I would enjoy this again. Very easy drinking."
"D - Not a bad entry into the Oktoberfests this season, I'm really enjoying this with my window open and the cool breeze coming on. Bring on fall!"
"Poured into a stein a clear copper/bronze with a well formed one finger crown atop.Caramel,light toast,and bread dough aromas,the caramel malt is the most assertive of the three,maybe a bit one sided but not bad.Caramel sweetness also dominates the flavors at the onset,slightly doughy with a bit os anise-likeflavors in the finish.Its a decent stab at a fest/marzen beer,maybe a little sweeter than I would like but its not bad."
"Drinkability: A tad muted, though perfectly drinkable, acceptable Oktoberfest."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice appearance, with a really substantial head and great lacing. Nose has a nice woody tone with a slight sweetness. Tastes like it smells. Not heavy, but full malty flavor. Seems a little diluted for this style, but okay. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
"Not a bad beer here. Again, I've had better examples of the style, but this is a totally acceptable 2nd tier Oktoberfest beer. I'm glad I tried it."
"Really nothing else to write home about.Given the opportunity, I'd try any other Oktoberfest over this one."
"I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but this is one of the poorer ofests I have had....makes Leinie's OFest look like an all-time great (which it isn't)"
"The brewery survived The Great Purge, and get points for that. Now it's time to tweak the recipes away from the adjunct lager formula and broaden their horizons."
"The mouthfeel isn't that bad, but it isn't that great, this beer jsut confuses me with its mediocrity."
"D: Easily drinkable. Pretty good malt character."
"Conclusion: what is with Shiner and its metallic twang aftertaste? I want to like their beer, but they make it so difficult. I have concluded that Shiner should be drank straight from the bottle. To me it cuts down on the metallic aftertaste. The beer actually performs better if it stays in the bottle. Overall not the best example of an Oktoberfest beer."
"D: This beer is decent, it has some of the expected flavor and I cant really complain too much. I wish they had upped the ante overall though. Pretty average brew."
"Poured a nice clear amber with a creamy light tan head with a descent amount of lacing. Aromas of sweet caramel malts predominated throughout. On the palatte I found it to be a little lighter bodied than most Marzens. But what it lacked in body it made up in taste, with a nice sweet malt on the tongue in true German fashion. One of the better offerings from the folks at Spoetzl. Two thumbs up!"
"it's easy to drink, especially for Shiner loyals. if you love Shiner's other beers, you'll probably love this."
"Overall - Not being too impressed w/the bock, this beer exceeded my expectations (especially for the price!). If you're looking for a cheap octoberfest/marzen beer from an American brewery that's pretty true to style, this one fits the bill."
"It's pretty decent."
"Pours out very clear in a lighter shade of amber with a foamy, modest white head. Smells of sweet malt that's been slightly toasted. The taste is very true to German tradition with a sturdy malt backbone contributing notes of caramel and nuts and just a hint of clean hops. I would say it is fairly medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a clean finish. Certainly not a bad beer, but nothing outstanding."
"From a cold bottle into a frosted pint glass at a saloon in Fort Worth, TX, this poured a clear pale gold color with orange amber highlights under a thick off-white head. The signature ""Shiner"" aroma of sweet candied malt dominates the nose. The familiar brisk, sweet, and robust malt feel of Oktoberfest takes front and center here and finishes with a crisp palate-sticking dry resonance. Very smooth and refreshing drinkability."
"Nice amber with fluffy white head. Classy looking Marzen. Smells of toasty malts, a touch of honey, and a bit of hay. Taste is a semi-sweet malt, the hay notes carry over into it, with some hops at the finish. Nice fall beer, an very good for the style. They could beef up the alcohol content a bit, and this would be on par with Spaten in my opinion."
"D: A pretty good Marzen. I would buy it again."
"a decent brew with a hint of stale apple and malt in the initial splash. then a lingering cereal. seems to be a hard thing to get rid of for the brewery but a lot of there lagers have a disappointing malt finish. one dimensional malt that doe not last at all. bitter then plain sugar finish."
"Drinkability, I give this a 2 mug rating, meaning I could drink 2 glasses before I got tired of it. Its a good, easy drinking beer, but it seems to be more of a Marzen Light..."
"A really good beer, but not sure I could drink a whole 6pk."
"Verdict: A solid little Oktoberfest, this is one of the best beers I've seen come out of Shiner in quite a while. I just wish I'd tried it back when it came out the first time so I could comment on whether it has changed at all."
"Not bad. I get some soapy hops for some reason, which makes for a strange tasting Oktoberfest. Overall, not the worst that I have had from Shiner, but nothing I would recommend."
"This is an really good example of the style, one of the best that Spoetzl has produced, far better than their usual session brews."
"For the price it isn't a bad value and I may pick up a six pack of this to throw back during a football game or two. Less dumbed down than most of Shiner's beers."
"Buttery, caramel malts are both a little toasty and a little sweet, but neither actually seems to want to take the reigns and give the beer an identity. Really not much else going on here, pretty dull effort for an Oktoberfest. There is a sip or two in each bottle where I think this beer has some promise, but unfortunately the next drink washes those optimistic thoughts away. I have been digging on most of Shiner's new seasonal brews, but this one pretty much falls flat on it's face. Thin, bubbly and lifeless, reminds me of a Leinienkugel's."
"Pours a deep orange. Smell is great with nice head and lacing. I love fall beers and this is a fantastic beer. Drinks very easy and doesn't feel too heavy. I happy to hear Shiner will bring this brew out every fall."
"D: Good effort for the style, but lacking excitement. This is not your best Marzen, but very far from the worst."
"It poured a copper color with a nice white head. It has a very strong malt smell and flavor. It was a lot sweeter than I was expecting. There was a little bit of the alcohol coming through at the end. It had a nice creamy mouthfeel. One I would drink again if they were to make it again."
"Overall, it's a pretty decent take on the style - especially given that many of the imports to the US now seem to be watered down versions of what they once were. No flaws. Pretty damned drinkable as far as acessibility goes, but perhaps somewhat lacking for the style in depth."
"Brought back a case of this from a trip to Shiner on a sausage and beer pilgrimage. Dark copper color. Nice head at first but, it dissipates quickly. Malty aroma and flavor with a hint of sweetness. Another fine old world-style beer from the folks in Shiner."
"Copper color with nice head. A sweet finish. Pretty decent beer. Another solid beer from the folks in Shiner, TX. Head was alright, but dissipated kind of quickly. Flavor was malty and sweet, pretty good mouthfeel. Lacing on glass was minimal. Pretty good effort."
"This beer is very nice for an Octoberfest, which I ususally enjoy anyway. It has a hint of fruit and smell of fruit , but the fruit does not overwhelm your senses."
"Drinkability: This isn't so bad. I must admit I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this is pretty drinkable. It's not nearly as sweet as some Oktoberfests are, and there is some depth to the malt profile, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it well-balanced."
"Mouth: Enters mouth with sharp carbonation on the tip of the tongue but fades quickly to an almost flat, watery mouthfeel. Excellent bitterness in the back of the mouth and warmth from the alcohol (but no alcoholic flavor). The taste is light, full bodied, grassy, slightly acidic like unripe peaches. It was well balances, the acidity wasn't overpowering and the bitterness lasted well in the mouth. I found this to be surprisingly drinkable and enjoyable!"
"The beers drinkability rating is good. It goes down quite well and has a nice mix of flavors in the finish. Since I have not had more of the Spoetzl offerings, it is definitely making me want to go out there and hunt some down. Can't say that about other breweries out of Texas. No offense though...in college, I used to be a Lone Star...but that was quite a long time ago."
"Drinkability - This beer despite it's short-comings, drinks down incredibly easy. Not the top of the style, but a decent offering from the Spoetzl Brewery."
"Better than some oktoberfests I've had lately, and not as good as others. Does Shiner make this one year-round? If so, that would be the advantage to buying this beer: getting an oktoberfest in the spring/summer."
"Very drinkable. A good session beer"
"D: I could drink a lot of these, because of price being so good, but I'd prefer a pale ale. Starting the night with this one would be okay, then I'd need to move."
"Notes: I've had minimal success with this brewery but this has revived my interest."
"A heady amber topped by a white head and some lacing in the glass. A little nutty at first but it is then dominated by seet vienna and munich malt smells. The taste is the only area of the beer I really have any grip, it is over sweet and not enough balance to all the big malt flavor. It is a nice beer that I am glad I have 2 left of as it wil go well with some pork chops later this week, just not something to blow the German beer lover away."
"Pours a pretty enough amber color with a good head, but that's about where it stops. It's an okay aroma, nothing offensive, a slight note of malt. The taste is oxidized, and just funky. Mouthfeel is thin, and dissapointing. Drinkability? Very so-so at best."
"Damn easy to drink. Give me a liter and some pretzels Id be happy! I sure enjoyed this beer. Too bad Shiner will not release this beer every year! I hope Shiner 97 will be as good. If so, I might have too rethink my opinions on this brewery. I purchased a bottle in Omaha. I might have to grab a six-pack before it is past its prime and/or no more. Not a shabby beer, I say, try one."
"Overall a good session beer. I wish i had some other shiner beers to try next to this, because it really seems like it tastes like others they make, namely the blonde. i want to know what hops and malts go into this one, and compare it with bock and blonde. Or maybe its just the water."
"Spoetzl (Shiner) beer, at least the three that I've had prior to this one, runs the gamut from 'terrible' (Blonde), through 'not good' (Bock) to 'decent' (Hefe). 96 falls into the latter category, even if it isn't a classic example of the style or a beer that will turn many heads."
"The smell is of toasted malt and a hint of caramel. The taste starts with light amount of malt and is taken over by a substantial hop presence. That would have been nice if this thing had the malt to back it up. The mouthfeel is just too light."
"Somewhat golden amber in color. Ok carbonation level. Sweet malt aroma. Medicinal and metallic flavors dominate. Some malty sweetness in the finish. Ok mouthfeel. Overall very average. The medicinal/metallic flavors really detract from the whole experience. Id skip this one."
"Really liked the special packaging with historical notations, etc."
"The taste is a light, mellow, malt sweetness with some nut characteristics that are quickly washed away by very citrusy hop bitterness. The aftertaste is bready and pleasing. Though this is not the most complex beer, I feel it is probably the most balanced example of the Marzen style I've had. The color is right-on and it avoids the sickly-sweetness that can often plague a Marzen."
"This is a pretty decent beer. I think I like Shiner Bock better, but both of them are ""easy drinkers"""
"Beer is good. Happy märzen beering."
"Draft at B&J Pizza in Corpus Christi."
"Good thing- 96 has some hops and flavor to it! Bad thing- the hops are quite harsh at times and don't blend well. And then there was a chemical-like, alkaline taste that seemed to hover in and out of my taste buds. Don't know what that's from. But overall, great effort from the little brewery in Shiner."
"Pours a yellowish-almost amber, pretty dang clear, and with a small head that subsides quickly, but leaves a thin white veil of bubbles around the glass. Aroma is all malt, with a hint of toasted malt. No hop aroma. Complex malt flavors, again with a toasty character. No hop flavor. Medium bodied. Finishes dry. Has more hop bite than I would expect for this style. I'm impressed that this beer came from Shiner. It's not as good as the German beers of the same style, but is definately worthy of drinking."
"Pours a clear bright amber color with a foamy white head that settles into a creamy lace. Nose is lightly toasted fresh grains with a bit of fruity malt in the background. Taste begins with sweet toasty malts and a bit of buttery caramel followed by some dry bready notes and then a bit of a woodiness along with a touch of a metallic twang. Its nice to see Shiner branching out into some new beers, but this one is far from great."
"Not a drinkable beer here. From the moment you taste this it is like something biting your tongue. This beer is seriously unbalanced it needs to be reformulated completely."
"Overall, a pretty good Märzen but could benefit from some additional malt to balance the bitterness. There are certainly better Oktoberfests out there, but this one is serviceable. And if it introduces a few Shiner drinkers to this wonderful beer style, the world will be a slightly better place."
"12 ounce bottle. Shiner 96 pours out an amber color with a inch of heads that fades quickly. There appears to be very little carbonation in this beer. The aroma is fruit and caramel. Definitely an ale aroma. The flavor is better than I expected, though my expectations were pretty low: fruit, toasted malt, caramel. The flavor is much too sweet however. I actually prefer this beer cold. There is also a distracting metallic flavor. This beer is not competely bad; it is just bad in most respects."
"Easily the best-crafted beer Shiner has ever produced. Generally right on the money for the style, and a pretty tasty beer to boot."
"Nothing too special here, but generally pleasant enough for a quick quaff."
"Drinkability: Showed a litlle promise, but didn't deliver, might be okay Ice cold."
" -Cheers2Beers"
"Transparent auburn body. Smells of nutty toasted malts. Flavors are really winning me over. Sweet upfront into a nutty character and then just enough bittering hops in the finish. The mouthfeel, I was not so impressed with. Could be a bit too ""seltzery."" Very drinkable."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a twist-off crown, served in a pint tap glass."
"Overall: Nice work. I'm glad to see Texas getting getting back to their roots. I could drink quite a few of these, which means it probably needs a little more booze. Again, I am suspecting high mash temps, so maybe some carapils or just more malt period. Either way, a very nice (and surprising) beer from the Shiner/Spoetzel. Now, bring on the Vienna!!!"
"Pours a very clear golden color with a respectable white frothy head. Aroma is a funky caramel with sweet malt notes. Taste is malty but there are some diacetyl off-flavors as well. Way too thin. The mouthfeel is very weak. Fairly quaffable, if you enjoy the flavor that is...which might be a stretch. I wanted to like this one, but it fell short. Very skippable."
"Pours a clear light amber. Very little carbonation formed a thick head but settles down after a couple sips. Matly sweetness in aroma. Tastes sweet from malt with a decent amount of hops to give it a quick, dry finish. Decent body with alright mouthfeel. Maybe too much carbonation? Overall, just decent. Not overly impressed. I haven't anything from this brewery that I have been particularly impressed with. Above average, but nothing great."
"What is significant is not this individual (admittedly mediocre) beer but who it comes from. Spoetzl is the Sam Adams of the Southwest, a reliable ubiquitous alternative in a Bud Light culture. This is their first new beer in a dozen years and their first limited edition, to my knowledge. Hiring a new brewer just last year, I'm hoping this is the start of Spoetzl trying to reclaim their craft beer roots."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a cooperish color with very little head and little carbonation. Had a very hoppish smell. The taste was rather disappointing. Tasted too hoppy and bitter to be a good marzen. I had tried at the GABF and it tasted better there - but I was buzzing pretty hard at that point. Nice try but not gonna find a home in my beer fridge."
"-UF"
"Still, glad to see Shiner breaking out with an annual celebration beer, looking forward to the next 4."
"In a nutshell this beer is FANtastic. This has to be the BEST 96th year anniversary beer from a South Texas brewery that I've ever had."
"Overall impression:"
"Picked up a six at Green's in Columbia, SC on the way to Charleston for $4.95. I had read about it on the Shiner web site as a special brew to celebrate their 96th anniversary so thought I would try it. Pours a clear copper color with a thin head that quickly faded. Not much in the aroma department, just a faint whiff of sweet malt. Taste was not anything to get excited about either, more of the same faint maltiness with a touch of mild hop bitterness. A drinkable beer for sure, but their are much better Oktoberfests out there. The label describes it as a Marzen style ale. Mmmm, I thought Marzens were lagers. Go figure."
"Thanks to Chaz for saving me six bucks!"
"Shiner 96 is bright copper in color with a rather large, off-white head. Carbonation is moderate and aides in some pretty good retention. The aroma is of rich caramel malts with an element of dark fruit smell. The taste is bready with distinct caramel taste and a touch of dark fruit. The sweetness factor is a little high for the style, but doesn't cloy. Noble hop flavor is present, but mainly serves as a balance. The finish is a little weak. After my first couple of sips, I didn't really find this to be a very good beer, but by the time my mug warmed up, the flavors had really opened up. This isn't as good as the German greats, but still a nice surprise from Shiner. I doubt it'll happen, but I hope they make this a fall seasonal."
"Drinkability is good. This is an O.K. Oktoberfest. Closest comparison is Paulaner Oktoberfest."
"Reddish-gold color typical of the Oktoberfest style, smallish head and lacing. Smell is very malty, too malty. Taste is more balanced, with some breadiness and just a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is relatively thick but features some harsh carbonation. Blah."
