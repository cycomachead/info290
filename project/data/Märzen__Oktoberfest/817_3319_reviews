"Boring and stale taste. Not a fan"

"Great marzen brew...One of the best from Austria"
""
""
"Stiegl Goldbräu is a basic Euro lager. It's clean and well-made, combining a basic, gently bready malt with a very firm bitterness and some floral and grassy hops."
""
""
"This beer is what it is, a Pilsener style beer. Its not the best I have ever had but its not the worst. I think it costs more than its worth, but its solid. I was interested in trying it. But it was nothing special. Average beer. There are adjunct lagers out there from the US that are as good as this one for a quarter of the price."
" The taste is very good with good malt body and light yeast in the front wtih slight hop giving a mild citrus and light spiced with subtle sweetness and light dry malt/ yeast essence in the finish. Overall this is a very good beer, enjoyable and went well with my bacon and egg breakfast taco-nice balance of malt and hops"
"There was nothing here resembling a festbier. This was fairly bland overall. Sweet bready malts that come across as kind of adjunct-y. Maybe a little grassy hop at the end. Heavy feeling overall."

"At the time of this writing, this beer is classified as an O-Fest. ...The hell did I miss!? Whatever. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises fresh flowers, grass, mild biscuit, and a very slight twinge of pine needle. The taste brings in more of the same, the flowers and grass really shining brightly, showing off what simplicity can achieve. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, this was a damn fine beer (awful for an O-Fest...), one whose popularity here I can easily understand. Good times."

"but went down pretty well."
"for the price (about $9/4-pack of 16.9 oz. cans), it's neither cheap nor expensive ... but cheap enough and good enough that I can see myself grabbing a 4-pack of this a couple times a year. a great break from the American hop scene."

"1/2 liter bottle of Austrian lager, Stiegl. I'm accustomed to seeing the pils around my area. The local college in Steubenville has an exchange program with a college in Austria all of the Catholic college kids come back state side with a craving for this industrial style lager from Salzburg. A deep golden akin to apple juice with a large white head forming thick with flowing stream of carbonation bubbles in the glass, speckled lacing sporadic but there. The nose has nice floral/herbal hops in the back end with an upfront, bread dough sweetness with hints of cooked vegetable pretty straight forward Euro lager truth be told, but pretty clean so far. An enjoyable rolling malt sweetness, think biscuit malt with some mineral water, just enough herbal hops to give it a zing, completely clean dry crisp lagered finish. This beer is meant to be drank in number, not complex at all but doesn't really set out to be that type of beer. This is industrial style mass produced lager with a decent flavor, I can't complain it is what it is. Not leaps and bounds above an American style light lager, but there's more tradition in this glass than your average BMC. Goldbrau is right it says it all it's Gold beer, highly force carbonated yet finishes clean with just enough hop snap to keep you coming back for another sip. If those college kids want to relive their semester abroad more power to them, I can see the sentimental value in a lot of bad beers this is just extremely middle of the road to be a go to beer for me."

"Had a glass at 1600 Bier Haus in Calgary. A bit of a rarity on tap, one is more likely to run into its German Pils stablemate. The darker Goldbrau is in fact pretty light, maybe just on the orange side of lemon yellow, with a little white foam. Aroma is an interesting blend of sweet corn (I'd be surprised if there is actual corn in here but perhaps), biscuit, and a bit of a funky ""off"" note that actually sort of works since it is subtle and far from overpowering. Old wet malt? Anyhow, taste is quite tart and acidic with a decent amount of carbonation, brown sugar and sweet dough with a little noble hop spice and a mellow sweet cherry note (a bit like cherry gum) that shows up early and persists through the crisp finish. A subdued but classy and well-executed Oktoberfest, just this side of a Pils or Euro lager really in terms of appearance and flavor, but with some rich malt character and no obvious flaws."

"Stiegl Goldbräu Premium Lager ---3/5."
""
""
""
"This is NOT what I could consider premium. If you want a thin beer that tastes almost infected, then grab a bottle of this. Other than that, avoid."
""
"O: I like it. Very different than anything my young pallet has ever tasted before. Good balance. I can hear the hops but they're not blowing out my eardrums. Might not be an all-time-great beer but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"O- Overall, I'm very impressed by this Austrian beer. Very tasty. This was a fantastic surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a very nice beer. This is one I'll buy again and one I'll offer to friends. An excellent way to pull people up out of the miry clay of Miller/Bud/Coors."
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer good for a couple."

"on tap at falling rock. I got this with a sandwich while I was waiting for the pliny the younger tapping. was looking for the least offensive, most neutral brew I could find, as I needed to clear the palate for what I knew would be one of the best beers of all time. it came in a pint glass, perfectly clear and golden with a finger or so of thick white fluff. the nose was super fresh, very very german in origin from the malt. fits all the stereotypes, but seems to have more body than some of the standard offerings in this style. unfortunately though, the nose is this beer's best feature. it tastes a little old, mildly metallic, and lazily handled. the malt freshness didn't come through the thicker body, and there was a starchy flavor to this that just dragged the whole thing down. I didn't even get spicy food and it couldn't clear my palate for me. it got even more heavy as it warmed, and left me pretty unsatisfied, although I will say again that the nose of this beer is very promising, and I will have to give the bottled version a fair shake at some point. overall a very plain beer, something for the BMC drinker in your life, since its a tad more hoppy than the generic stuff, but its not worth the import price."

"Not really a Marzen or Helles by any stretch, more like an all-malt American. Malty, perfumed, pleasant, easy, watery, hopless and forgettable. The best Austrian lager I've tasted, which is not necessarily a compliment."
""
""
"This may be a little better than Serbian or Romanian lagers. You could pour this down your gullet for a thirst quencher, but even Heineken has more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Despite the atrocious look, this is a passable brew."
""
"Nice beer, nothing to write at home about, but pleasanty drinkable. I don't have any other austrian beer examples to compare, but I find it quite good."
""
""
""
""
"I'm reviewing this as a Helles Lager. Not sure why this is under the Oktoberfest style on here. Very bright and traditional flavors with incredible balance. I could have easily had 2 liters of this stuff."
""
"Overall - I don't mean this as a slam but this beer taste a bit like Corona. The beer is nice but lacks character."
"O: very nice if unremarkable beer. Good with food. I like that it is a bit more hoppy and bitter than expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely clean and crisp tasting. If this is a Marzen though, what is Stiegl Marzen? This beer has Marzen like qualities but I'm a little confused by it all. There's rich vienna like malt in their with a toffee cara-pils like taste which is cleaned up by an extremely mild hop presence. A very malty beer and does taste like a very rich Oktoberfest just without a deeper hue. Simple but pretty well brewed. Nothing to complain about and has a bit of an edge on some other brews. It's year round though so you Oktoberfest lovers should get all over this one. Clean, smooth, and balanced. Pretty good."
""
"O: Not a bad Marzen. There are better out there....this one is just above average."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, malt, grass, and slight skunk. Taste is of grain, malt, and some herbal and grassy hop flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer and nothing all that special in my opinion."
""
"O -- Very easy to slug down, but hardly any form of Märzen. Sort of a cross between a German Pils and Bavarian Helles. The good breadiness is delicious up front with the mild hop bitterness in the finish that makes you think Pils, but either way -- this is a pretty satisfying beer for an after-worker."
""
""
"Sadly the overall impression is that this really isn't all that good. I've had this on tap in Salzburg and it was excellent, but I guess being so far from the source has left this beer underwhelming."
"Pours transparent gold in color with a moderate white head. Aroma is strongly of golden delicious apple peel, and the flavor is a combination of golden delicious apple and honey, yet somehow without the merits that either would have on its own. A drinkable brew, but not something I would gravitate toward if given better options. The bar menu touted that Goldbrau was regarded as ""the best beer in the world"" by many beer connoisseurs, but I can't fathom how that is even remotely true to any extent. Not offensive, but certainly not something that I would ask for again."
""
"Overall: a very good Munich Helles. I would definitely have this again and again."
""
""
"Light-medium bodied. Reminds me of a kolsch. Worth a shot."
""
"Prost!"
""
"O - The lighter carbonation and lack of maltiness would make this a good beer to have when you're planning on having a few. Overall, I'd normally rather have one heavier ale than a few lagers, but..."
""
""
"Received in my Beer of the Month six-pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, VA. Poured from a half liter bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a straw color with a larger head, which dissipates quickly and leaves nice lacing. Smell of malt lightly, but not much. Nice balance of hops and malt that have a great taste, better than most import lagers. Carbonation is correct and beer goes down well, definitely one you could drink down all night. A nice lager overall."
""

"The lasting qualities on the palate are quite short, and there really isn’t any complexity, but I don’t think there is supposed to be for the style, really. The effervescence just doesn’t quit. I like it a lot for what it is. I think everything is balanced pretty well and nothing sticks out as offensive."
"Pours a darker golden color with hardly any head, and no lacing. It is much darker than most macro-lagers. The smell is really nice, has a malty sweetness to it unlike most lagers, it is very inviting from the look and smell of it. Taste is average at best, the look and smell had me really looking forward to something special but the taste is just OK. For a Munich Helles it definitely doesn't have as much of a defined maltiness in the taste department like one would expect. Mouthfeel is watery and empty. Overall the beer is average, i believe this is my first Austrian beer and it leads me to think that the Austrians should leave the beer to the neighbors, the Germans."
"Overall: The aroma was nice. Most of these helles lagers are just less bitter light lagers for me. Nothing too special about this one."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a medium bodied feel. Overall, I enjoy my Helles Lagers more than most I'd say and Stiegl is another fine example from the Old World."
"Had this on tap at the Bavarian Lodge - had to have something from a German-speaking country to go with my Schweins Hax'n. Described as a golden, the beer had an earthier quality than most Helles-styles beers I've tried. Definitely malty, it also had a sweet quality - not as clear a taste as other beers of this style. Not exactly what I was expecting but good for the moment."
"O - Pretty good brew. Maybe not worth the 3.99 I payed for it, but certainly much better than many other ""macro"" brewed lagers from Europe."
"Overall: This is a no frills euro lager with no bite, light and smooth feel and fundamental beer flavors. A nice little find here, an obvious choice brew for the warmer months."
"Overall: Given time for the skunkiness to blow into the next room, we were left with a general, at best generic European lager."
"Aftertaste is like a mouthful of dimes."
"Great beer all around. Everything expected for the style and the ABV. Poured a nice 2 finger huge white head straw golden with lots of carbonation. Smell very grassy little sweetness to it. Definitely drinkable and perfect for a summer day laying by the pool. Have recommended this beer to many of my customers who are looking for something simple not crazy and have yet to hear a complaint!!"
"Curious looking red and white can caught me eye at Bert's today and made the trip home with me. Pours a crystal clear pale straw color with a smallish fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. Smells of grainy pilsner malt with hints of honey and a distant but present lightly toasted malt aroma. Floral hops are there but restrained. Simple clean aroma. Taste is bready grainy with hints of melanoid, could this brew be decocted? Sweet honey like grain with bits of green apple and a hint of astringency near the finish. Medium body, sweet bready mouthfeel, Medium to high level of carbonation. I hardly ever go for a lager, but today I'm kinda glad I did. This is a great flavorful easy drinking beer, I can see some of these in my future."
"Pours a one finger white head that vanishes, leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber/yellow color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Grassy nose. Flavor is sweet grass and very smooth. Typical Euro lager. $1.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall, although not as crisp or clean-tasting as some similarly-styled lagers, this beer is earthy and satisfying and was a reminder of why I so thoroughly enjoyed my time in Austria."
"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a light lemony color more that golden but with a nice large fluffy white crown that never really completely left.Aromas of lightly toasted bread,and a strange hint of vanilla tinged green apple,not a bad thing just a bit odd to me.Light to medium feel wich makes the beer more refreshing and easier drinking.Crushed pilsner malt flavors with a drying palate,somewhat grainy,even a soft smack of lefay hop to round out the finish.Will this beer blow ya away?No,but it shouldnt,its refreshing and food friendly,just great for a day out grilling like today."
"In the can I find metallic hints that may indicate this particular can is past its prime. However, if you can find this on tap you will be mighty pleased. Glad it's held up for me after several intervening years of more and varied styles."
"overall a very enjoyable light and refreshing beer. very nice on a hot day."
"This is a drinkable beer, and does not fill you up. Goes down easy, perhaps too easy! Great summertime beer for hot days."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is good, crisp, malts, a touch of sweetness, finish a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall a good quality beer."
"D-The mineral note on the finish hurt the drinkability for me; it was pretty distracting."
"D - super easy to drink -- appealing flavor has made me get this repeatedly; for a lighter beer than I typically drink, this is crazy good"
"D: Chuggable, but good and balanced enough to be savored. I know nothing about this brew or its brewery, but it gives the impression of being a good macro. Not phenomenal, but solid, enjoyable, and lacks anything offensive."
"D: No trouble finishing things up, nice german grain base meets a Czech style saaz hoppings makes things move along easily enough with little complaint."
"A good Helles, but I've had better. Still, I would have another. A smooth easy drinking lager."
"This is listed as a Marzen/Octoberfest. I'm no expert, but I'm about 90% sure this is not the correct style designation for this beer. This is a golden lager? OK, whatever they say here, but I'm not going to review this as a fest beer, since it is clearly not. The color is spot on: golden. Thick head that dies quickly. Nice foamy lacing. Basic, good, clean beer smells: barley, grain, light hops, some sweetness and caramel. The flavor is bright, clean and rich. Mellow grass, rich grain, sweet mild hops with a slightly dry finish. Very sturdy, yet refreshing. This is a high quality beer."
"D - Very very drinkable. I like it much better than most (if not all) brews coined ""Märzen/Oktoberfest."""
"D: Can't get more drinkable than a beer like Stiegl"
"Drinkability: Very good beer, but I think this was an old sample."
"Overall an enjoyable lager. More of a pils than anything else however."
"A bit more body and sweetness than their standard Pils, I see this brew as just another example of that style, more or less. A touch of corn syrup perhaps yet no caramel, and with a slightly creamy texture though a bit less refined overall. More Euro Pale in style than anything else."
"I have had this beer both on tap and in a 16oz bottle. It is a remarkable beer in either form. I seek it out. I don't think I have a single negative comment about this beer - to my palate it is perfect in every way. It pours a pure, bright golden color with a white head. The smell is primarily of yeast - it reminds me of making bread, the subtle burn you feel if you bring your nose close to the bowl of yeast and sugar and water. There is some of that in the flavor as well. There is some hop, but its bitterness is negated by the malt and yeast. The malt flavor is not detectable per se - it is felt in the soft texture of the beer and it counters the bitterness of hops. Yeast is the dominant flavor. Breadiness. Mouthfeel is superior. It feels smooth and wet - there is not a hint of chalkiness or dryness to be found here. Like a loaf of bread, this beer can become heavy if one overindulges. That said, it is highly drinkable if your intent is to savor its impeccable flavor. If you, like me, love lagers, this is a beer you should seek out - there is nothing revolutionary about it...German purity law etc...but it is so perfectly executed that I simply cannot imagine a better, more satisfying beer."
"Incidentally my bottle says quote ""A wonderful refreshing Salzburg lager beer speciality"" which would support my claim that is definitely not an Marzen/Oktoberfest style beer and is much closer to a lager. For me this is somewhere between a pilsner and a lager - the sweetness of a pilsner without the bite."
"Pours a deep golden color with a minimum of head that fades to a thin layer, but never really disappears. Smells of yeast, water and citrusy hops. Tastes sweet and malty, and of noble hops. Finishes a little sour. Mouthfeel is light, but not fizzy. Overall, a very drinkable beer, wouldn't hesitate to get it again."
"I like this. The timing is odd but make no qualms, this is a decent beer."
"I didn't know anything about this beer when I picked it up. Not a bad drinker, though definitely nothing special. It's quite a bit lighter than any Oktoberfest I've tried, but I'm not familiar enough with the style to say if it's off-style or not. If someone offered me a Stiegl, I would happily accept but don't think I'll be picking it up again. Very sessionable if you're into it."
"Drinkability- Picked this up for $1.99 for a .5L bottle. A good sessionable beer."
"The beer almost captures a caramel bready note that reminds me of Oktoberfests but not enough to overly state itself. But the hop character and dry finish favor the German Lagers. A nice beer that is both highly drinkable and characterful."
"Draft at Haus Staudt. Clear and golden with a lively head that's fed by a steady stream of champagne-like bubbles. Clean and malty aroma with notes of hay and leafy hops. A touch soapy at colder temperatures, cleaner and sweeter as it warms. Flavors of lime zest and hay are prevalent on the palate, supported by herbal and slightly earthy hops and pale malt. Clean, light-bodied and balanced almost to a fault, this is a well-crafted easy drinker that's lacking a bit in character. Finishes dry and mildly bitter. I'm impressed by how clean this is; very solid stuff."
"Feels a bit lighter than I would like for a Marzen, but it's exceptionally drinkable. Would gladly have again at the right price point."
"A couple of sips and it is time to move on. This may be the style, but it does not hold interest."
"Mouth/Drink: Light feel, watery taste gives this superior drinkability!"
"D: Overall, a forgetable beer to be reached for as a last resort. I wrote this beer off a long time ago, but came back to it based on the positive reviews here. I'm sorry to say that it still disappoints on most levels and it's best to steer clear of it when there are so many better Märzens available in Austria."
"All in all a solid beer, if I could get them at this price regularly I'd probably have some in the fridge on most occasions."
"I would drink this beer again, however, I would not buy it again. It's not really my thing. It is quite similar to the prevalent lowest common denominator beers here, especially in appearance and smell, but it's a much more enjoyable drinking experience."
"Overall, outstanding beer, I'd highly suggest it to any of my friends."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again. I have had better but it was still good."
"Edit - After having a fresher bottle I'm sure, I'm getting a lot more good direct hop flavours, clean and very tasty, upping the taste and overall score appropriately."
"D: quite, it's not bitter and the taste and feel leaves me wanting another can in the future."
"Had this beer multiple times on tap on a visit to Salzburg. It was a wonderful accompaniment to my typical meals of sausage & kraut. It balanced those flavors perfectly with a light sweetness that came out against the sour and salty flavors of the food. It has been brewed in Salzburg for hundreds of years (Mozart drank it). Wish I could get it stateside!"
"Served in the special Stiegl glass by Marcus at Brussels in Halifax. Short white head, some lace, steady stream of upward moving bubbles. Brilliant gold colour, grassy and earthy smell, malty aroma. Pleasing mouthfeel, smooth and balanced, good refreshment value. Medium bitter, low acidity, malty finish - tastes pretty good. Drinks like a lager with a bit more finesse. Slow steady carbonation had staying power, head regenerated quite well with a swirl even to the last inch of beer. Recommended."
"A simple, lighter, and tasty Marzen, I guess it's year-round? Why not!"
" ~ I think I could really get used to a beer like this. This is a nice tasting and easily consumed brew."
"A decent enough warm-weather drinker, especially coming from a can, and a bit light for the 'winter is coming' style it's been assigned here, so I say, drink it now! And Prost! Now where did I put my second serving of spicy sausage...?"
"Drinkability: Nothing special, but not a bad beer. Worth a try."
"If anyone here is a bottle cap collector, these bottles, at least by the time I tried this beer for the first time, and maybe it wasn't the only one, had all different caps, European flags to be more precise, I found em to be a good addition."
"Stiegl Goldbräu pours a big stiff head over a clear dark yellow brew. Carbonation is extremely active, and the nose is clean light malts and lager yeast. The flavor is light, slightly sweet malt and a mild herbal hop off the back. Mouthfeel is likewise light and crisp. A very basic lager, but pretty refreshing and a good choice for sessions. If the big American macro brewers could transition their lame-ass lagers to even something as simple as this, they could all hold their heads a little higher."
"Taste: Maltiness and skunkiness make up the majority of the taste. Light bitterness rounds out the finish. Overall it's not that bad. Better than Heineken, anyways."
"Doesn't really strike me as a Maerzen style beer. Seems more like a helles lager to me."
"Full and not too slick. Carbonation is not too aggressive. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: a refreshingly quaffable lager, but I would say definitely not a marzen. More like a pils."
"Overall - quite average lager, nothing special."
"My pour resulted in a nice, thick, two fingers' worth of bone-white head with excellent retention. The nose had a classic lager sweetness, kind of grainy, but definitely a lager. The color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild lager sweetness on the tongue. Finish had a somewhat bitter sharpness. .5 Liters was plenty."
"Sour, corn mash taste with some hop bitterness. Bland malts. Decent mouthfeel, but a very foul aftertaste. Not worth repeating. Just another generic Euro lager, no different than any of the other dozen on the shelf."
"D - Overall, I suppose this is a decent Austrian golden lager (not really a Märzen). The strong malt character is quite typical of an Austrian beer from my experience. That said, it's a pretty ordinary example of those beers and nothing quite special."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, but it isn't really as Oktoberfest-y as I've had, even though its classified as a Marzen/Oktoberfest."
"Not the best beer you will ever find, but you could do a whole lot worse."
"This beer is like a mix of simple Euro lager and malty German lager. Refreshing with some flavor to be had."
"Tried this beer for the first time. This is a very good beer. I poured it into a glass and it had a small white head that disappered quick. It poured a very light golden color. While the beer was sitting on the table I looked down at it, the bottom of the glass was almost clear as water. Took the first sip and it was very mild, almost creamy. I could also feel the carbonation on my tounge. It wasn't intense. It was actually quite a nice feel. This is definatly a beer worth trying."
"The taste is full-bodied and aromatic in the mouth with a strong notes of grain, herbs, honey, and flowers. It has a light bitterness and a wonderful finish of sweet, fruity grain and grassy bitterness. It also has a slightly unusual quality that is hard to describe and is rather oily. It's refreshing and smooth but wonderfully tasty."
"D- A drinkable beer, but not nearly as good as others in the area."
"This lighter Austrian brew comes with a decent level of complex flavor. It's a style you could drink a lot of in one sitting, although it does have a slight heavier edge that might turn some people off to it. But for me it works. I've never appreciated anything that slightly resembles the mass produced American junk, so this keeps itself away from that category as far as I am concerned"
"Pale golden color, white one finger head that sustains for a little bit. Mild fruity malt aroma mixed with dry grains and a slight honey sweetness. Drying bitter hops is more assertive in the taste and faint notes of lightly toasted grains, citrus and mild fruity malt. On the down side is a stale breadiness and a blanketed rice like blandness. The finish isnt something I care to revisit with cereal grains, some floral hops, and a cheap white wine flavor. Mouthfeel is thin but descent and carbonation is moderate, a little too fizzy with micro foam."
"All in all, this just passes. Not going to go out of my way to drink it again, but I wouldn't refuse."
"Drinkability- It has a pucker factor that I do not like but as it sit and gets flat oddly it gets better. ( I hate admitting that.)"
""
"Drinkability was poor. I just couldn't finish it, it was so unrefreshing and uninteresting. Even a flavor defect like skunkiness would have made it more interesting and maybe more palatable."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that leaves sporadic lacing around the edges of the pint glass. A good dose of malt in the nose with just a touch of hops. The taste much like the aroma is mostly malt with just a touch of spicy hops. The mouthfeel could use some more carbonation as it is rather flat and watery. Overall, this is a decent brew for what it is. However, I don't believe I will purchase again because there are so many better brews within the style."
"Mouthfeel is a downer as watery and fizzy are the descriptors that continue to pop into my head. There is an oiliness to the finish that, while usually a detractor, is actually welcome for its thickening quality here. Not a bad beer and it is all I've got tonight on this evening when my fellow Chicago BAs are enjoying the 2007 German Beerhall Crawl (yes, I know this is Austrian) with out me. I could have a few but I wouldn't seek this out."
"Would love to try this on tap in Austria as I could see myself drinking more than a few."
"Light and effervescent without being watery or fizzy. This is a warm weather quaffer, not complicated but subtle. I rated this as a Helles Lager, because I'm sure it is not a Marzen."
"Tastes good, like some european macro, but not in a bad way. A nice froth on the palate sweetens up the brew nicely. Sessionable and would be very refreshing on a hot day. I have been fortunate to get many Austrian beers over the years and this one is middle of the road decent."
"Would drink again, easy to drink a good session beer."
"Notes: This is simply bad. No good way to sugar coat this offering."
"The flavour continued where the aroma left off, but with a bit more complexity. Joining the grassy hop taste were some spicy, bitter hop notes and a bit more of a roasted flavour from the malt. Pleasant medium body and carbonation on the high side. It finished crisp, clean and refreshing."
"Drinkability: maybe because I've been away from hops for a few weeks, but I really liked this. It was nothing special, but it did the job it was designed for: my thirst was quenched."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable and therefore a good session beer. There beer also tasted better as I drank more [also a good session beer quality]. By the end of the beer I wished I had another."
"A Premium commercial all-malt German golden lager certainly NOT a Marzen as this page suggests, and a great session lager...better than most Canadian national lagers and superior to many weak micro pils in a pinch. Some of us here have been blending this beer 50-50 with Kostritzer Schwarzbier for a great black and tan session lager."
"Drinkability - a fine session beer, more of a warm weather pick for me, but on the pricey side ($2.59 per 17 ounce bottle)."
"Taste is mostly malt, more roasted taste than I was expecting. Good aroma hop presence, slight lemony sourness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, certainly not over-carbonated, even though the beer itself looks like it might be. Goes down very easily with a malty aftertaste. This is a quality lager, and one I could stock in my fridge easily for all those World Cup matches coming up!"
"12oz. bottle pours out a golden yellow with next to nothing for a head. It was highly carbonated, tons of bubbles. The smell was a little bitter, the taste however was not. It was crisp and smooth. It was very drinkable. It is very typical of many European lagers."
"D - Not bad by any stretch. I recall having one of these while backpacking through Austria. Had it warm out of the can and wasn't particularly bothered by it. Not a great brew, but not bad either. (extra .5 pt for nostalgia:P)"
"This is a decent beer."
"This is a very sessionable offering from our Austrian friends."
"Drinkable."
"This beer pours a very pale yellow with a white head that fades quickly. Smells slightly fruity and very pleasant. Taste is malty with some fruit overtones and some hop bitterness as well. Feels a little thin, but is well carbonated and is easy to drink. A fairly good beer."
"Overall this is a very pleasant, and very flavorful Helles. I recommend it."
"While not a great beer, quite good for running me fifty cents."
"Pale gold, moderate short-lived head with some soapy lace. Somewhat sweet up front, grainy, minimal hops. Not particularly memorable for better or worse."
"A huge improvement over this brewery's recently sampled hefeweizen. Poured a rather pale gold. Very little head. Aroma was sweet and a bit grassy. Bright malt, a touch on the acidic side. Hops were typically Bavarian. Finished clean, without astringency. Overall, a pleasant German lager."
" Fairly average for style. Not a bad beer at all, but nothing here to rise above the pack."
"Pours a clear orangish-gold and a 2.5 finger white head with good contour and solid retention, leaving quite respectable lacing. The nose is mild, but features a good blend of sweet malt and slightly metallic hops. The mouth is very prickly and fairly heavy. While malt is present in the taste, hops determine the flavor profile from the start. A bit metallic and a touch harsh, the bitterness doesn't last long, but is pronounced. The finish is sweeter, as the malt makes a comeback, leaving a bready aftertaste."
"Clear golden beer with appropriate carbonation and a nice, fluffy white head. Aroma is typical euro-lagermalty, slightly grainy, muted musty hop undertone. Little bit of sulfur-smelling mustiness mixed in as well. Nothing offensive or extraodinary in the taste. Malt followed through. Hoppy finish. Crisp and soft. This one doesnt have any strikes against it, but it sure didnt excite me."
"Metallic tasting lager, although some creaminess though like a nitrotap..Medium mouthfeel. Passable, above Molson and even some watery micros, but not really a good beer. Not bad for The Beer Store and its thin selection. Pale gold. On the refreshing side."
"Thx"
"The flavour is more akin to a weak Marzen style, or a malty Pils, I'm not sure where this beer is trying to go. Sweet malt up front, but the metallic grains take centre stage closer to the middle, very crisp mouthfeel there, and they linger on and blend in with the hops upon the finish, a dry crisp finish. It makes for a fairly decent pils, but nothing overwhelmingly special aside from a very impressive appearance, especially the head, which left thick webs of lacing, and a pinky finger cap of white foam all the way down the glass, amazing retention. Worth checking out, if only for the Scooby-Doo mystery of which style it really is."
"An OK beer but I have had better."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, malty aroma with a breadlike quality. The taste is good. It goes down easy with a nice malty flavor and that breadlike finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation; very smooth. This is a fine lager. It has good flavor and a nice smooth finish; a good drinker."
"This could make a good summer session brew. Not overly complex, but a nice blending. Some may find it lacks, but I find it good."
"Beer is easy to drink and the mouthfeel is fine thanks to the carbonation. This brewery makes outstanding products, unfortunately this isnt one of them."
"Very good taste, not too bitter (not much hop), easy to drink (cool it well!), not too expensive (no dosser-beer though!)"
