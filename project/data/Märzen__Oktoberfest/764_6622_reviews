"Better than average domestic Oktoberfest"

"Arguably, no country takes more pride in the quality of its beers than Germany - it's hard to live up to standards set by centuries of proud brewing tradition. Nonetheless, Blue Point has made an honorable effort that, while it doesn't quite rank on par, is a nice ode to the more traditional, original versions of Oktoberfest beers. But it's certainly nothing to celebrate about."

"Good flavor but sweet for an Oktoberfest beer"
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink but definitely not one of the better examples of the style or even more interesting. Don't think that I will grab this one again as it is just fairly mundane. Alcohol is pretty well hidden."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is not very threatening.  Toasted malts, sweetness, and a bitter finish.  This is a fairly ordinary beer although it is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: drinkable, but not all that interesting;"
""

"Everything about this was OK - taste, OK, slight after taste.  Body kept some less than OK components at the 3 line overall."
""
""
"Not bad, but not really that good, either."

"Another surprising screw-top! I used a heavy-handed pour, which resulted in a pseudo-cascade. This settled fairly quickly into two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with good retention. Color was solid-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity and of course Mammon, Croesus and Midas showed up, clamoring for a taste. I watched, bemused, as the head fell, leaving behind sticky lacing in its wake and I was thinking about some gelt for me. Nose was very biscuit-like, quite malty, but not overly sweet. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant amount of carbonation on the tongue. The flavor was both biscuity and grassy, a nice combination of malts and hops that proved to be eminently drinkable. The finish evinced a slight honey-like sweetness, something often found in the quality lagers, but overall, I would still classify it as semi-dry."

"This is a pretty classic medium body with modest amount of carbonation. Somewhat crisp but that candy-like sweetness could be tamed down a bit to make it overall more enjoyable."

"Where the beer's caramel flavor pushes it slightly outside of its style parameters, it begins to resemble an Amber Ale as much as it does Oktoberfest. But even with its American liberties, the beer is pleasant and humble."
""
""
"Overall: This is another very solid American example of an Oktoberfest beer. Nicely balanced, extremely quaffable. I liked it a lot, and I’ll certainly add it to my Oktoberfest rotation."

"Aroma is strong and malty with fruity and earthy underpinnings. Pours a clear, orangy amber with a fairly thick pale wheat head that leaves generous lacing. Lip-smacking flavor has a malty core and firm tones of cloves, fruit and honey. Smooth texture has average body and fizz. Happy Autumnal Equinox - in the northern hemisphere, anyway."
""
""

"Overall: A very flavorful Oktoberfest. Grab some while there's still some left."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. White, fluffy head on a clear coppery body. Lacing lines the glass, clear and soapy. Aroma is crisp, light caramel sweetness, fresh hop bitterness, classic pilsner notes. Taste has mild sweetness, mild bitterness, pilsner yeastiness. Not too complex, very smooth and easy to drink. Not one complaint whatsoever."
"Just a really average beer. I love Marzen/Octoberfest, but this one is just blah. I bought a variety pack and this one was disappointing. The flavor hits early and fades late, which seems like a trend from this brewery. I would drink it if it was free, but I doubt I'll pay for it again."
""
"Overall this is a very drinkable lager though given how nice their Vienna lager is I expected a bit better beer. Still, this is a smooth and very drinkable offering."
"The flavors border on fruity, to a bit of a fault. Pale apple, sweet crackers, juice-like residual sweetness. The main players I expect in the flavor - caramel, malt, bread - are absent, or at least masked quite well under a covering of sweet fruity character. This one missed the mark for me. It wasn't a bad ""beer," it just wasn't a great Okto."
""

"This brew (to me) was a total miss. It's off style and not a strong representation of a Marzen. It's refreshing, but I can't recommended it as a Marzen..."
"I purchased this lager while visiting my niece in Michigan. I now wish I had purchased some other offerings from this brewery."
"o - overall...hmmm...seem to feel the same way about this beer today as i did from the brewery, but yesterday was LOVING it. what was the difference...well yesterday i drank it from the bottle and today and at the brewery from a glass. i think that this is a beer to drink from the bottle. drinking this one from the bottle seems to tame back some of the lager and focus more on the crystalized malts and pot pouri-ness of the beer. if i don't take a sniff from the glass as i sip it, i find that i dig the flavor more as the lager seems to be dialed back a bit. very interesting. i'm going to give this a 4 on the overall based on this discovery...moving forward this is one to drink directly from the bottle for me."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 7/30/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, caramel, biscuit, toast, grass, herbal, and light earth. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, grass, herbal, and light spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, biscuit, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of all flavors with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest! Spot on style flavor profile with great balance; extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyable and true to style all the way."
""
" O : It's not one the best this season for sure. The beer is lacking the malt and hops in my opinion . Blue Point needs to step it a notch ...."
"O: This is a well made and drinkable Oktoberfest. However getting this beer in FL I am not sure if it was handled properly from NY to FL. Overall I prefer just a little less more attenuated Oktoberfest. However I would drink this again."
""
""
""
"I don’t know what happened here. Unbalanced sweetness, off-notes, a soft, limp body and lemon? Ugh! I expected much, much more from this beer and didn’t get it. This is unfortunately one of the lesser American O-Fests that I’ve had."
"O - Pleasantly surprised by the local folks. This is a darned good fall seasonal from Blue Point that I'd gladly have again."
""
""
""
"Lightly toasted malts up front. Faint soapy-ness follows, briefly, before sweetish, caramel-y malts take over. Cookie dough and caramel play together nicely. Cooked carrots and vegetbales into the finish. Lingering sweetish malts and spicy noble hop bitterness. Moderate body, with a gently carbonated, smooth feel. A very solid Ofest!"
""
""
"There is just a little too much carbonation. Otherwise it is on the lighter side and drinks pretty easy. Maybe just a tad thin. Plenty good at the price point."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall an above average marzen, though nothing crazy. Nice sweet fruits in the taste and easy to drink. Worth checking out if you see it and are looking for a marzen, but nothing to seek out."
""
""
"This is a nice, drinkable version of an Oktoberfest. It has nice flavor and a solid body. It's worth a try if you're looking for a good Oktoberfest beer."
"O - Good beach beer! Thats about all I can say for it, drinks fast and easy, just disappoints me. I was in Germany for 2 months this summer, and in Munich for the end of it, and I just compare all Oktoberfest beers and the like to the Dunkels there, and it just is too light and too sweet in comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid Oktoberfest. Nothing Earth-shattering here, but a clean tasting flavorful beer. Would get again."
"I bought two six packs at Publix and I am really savoring them!"
""
""
""
"D - Quite nice, it has a pleasant malt character and just enough hop presence to balance things out. Very drinkable and well made, if a little bit too sweet."
"Mouthfeel is also not what I'm used to- light body, moderately sparkly carbonation. This is not one I'd get again."
"O- pretty good brew overall, great aroma"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's not nice to point fingers. It's also not nice to Blue Point Oktoberfest."

"I forgot i had this one pushed back in the fridge. The body is a nice amber color body with no head but a little bit of lace. The smell is of malt with some carmel sweetness coming through. The taste is sweet with some malt taste, nothing special. The mouth feel is good and overall this is a average marzen to my taste."

"D - This is an all around on-par beer. They didn't get anything wrong but they didn't set themselves out from the crowd that much either. I don't think this level of bitterness is that common in German marzens, I'm not sure. That may be the American influence, just a guess."
"I personally think that alot of American craft brewers should put more into Oktoberfest beers,to many make ""standard"" versions of the style and throw it out there.Poured one and a half bottles into a .5 liter stein with a lighter copper color prevailing,a decent fluffy white head atop.Caramel malt dominates the nose,quite grainy with a bit of toastiness.Lightly sweet flavors with that toasted grain element coming into play,no frills but decent flavors.This isnt a bad beer, but lacks very much complexity to it."
"Overall-an approachable fest, a little disappointing given this can be a compelling style and I know Blue Point can pull it off. Still, not bad and give it a try during the season."
"O: Not bad. Pretty average. I liked the Point Oktoberfest slightly more."
"O – Pretty solid fest beer here. Not overly complex and that’s good. Straight forward nice tasting and an easy drinker. Pretty good one."
"This is actually one of the best domestic Octoberfest offerings I've ever had! This beer is super tasty for an Octoberfest! Not heavy on alcohol or hops aftertaste. Great blend of malt and fall spices. Medium head and lighter lacing! You can easliy get through a 6 pack of this. Awesome session beer! I want more!"
"MO- Definitely on the thin side. Not as good as many of the Maerzens but not a bad beer."
"O: decent brew, wasn't bad from the screw top. Relatively cheap and available, as I bought it in a grocery store."
"Overall a very tasty Oktoberfest and definitely one of the better ones I have had."
"O: I like this beer, damn good oktoberfest."
"Very drinkable Oktoberfest. Somewhat lighter on the flavor as most American Octoberfests beers. A new favorite of mine."
"Notes: Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, it is extremely easy to drink, but not in a watery sense. On the other, however, i feel that this Oktoberfest is simply too light to call an actual Marzan style of lager. Not too shabby though overall"
"Overall its not a bad brew - nothing Blue Point does is bad by any means. Its a solid Oktoberfest and well worth trying at the bar. A six pack may be a bit presumpious but that being said it may depend on your choices."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy and somewhat barnyard like. In the taste, more earth than expecting and a nice dryness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry earth in the aftertaste. Dry and smooth, a nice earthy presence."
"O: Pretty good, this one seems creamier than many oktoberfests, definitely better than the blue point pumpkin."
"This has a nice orange-amber color, clear, not much of a head certainly dissapates quickly, no lacing glass. Taste is sweet and malty, light hint of hops.Pleasant,dances on the tounge, lingering aftertaste."
"Blue Point has never dissapointed with their seasonal offerings and their Oktoberfest is no exception. Easily the best I've had this fall. Not overbearingly malty while still delivering a very full flavor and medium finish. The aftertaste lingers just long enough for the next sip!"
"Big thanks goes out to a brewery rep for giving me this one quite awhile back. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured golden yellow with a two finger bone white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, nutmeg, and slight spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, spices, and nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. It was however not a favorite of mine from the style. The flavor was pretty good, but the aroma was lacking big time. This one could have used a little more spice to bump it up a notch. Still worth trying around the season, but I would leave it at that."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Pours pale copper-colored, mostly golden, with a medium beige head. Aroma is mostly caramel malt, with toffee, brown sugar, and some cocoa. Flavor is weak sweet malt and a slight bitter grass finish; this is like Budweiser brewed with caramel malt. Thin, with medium carbonation. Not very good."
" The flavor is good, nice malt which has a slightly honey-like fruitiness and mellow spice from the hop in the background. I enjoy the mellow caramel presence from the malt, but toastiness is mild and hops could be more forward. I like the yeast's role in this which is mild, yet it could use a little more character. I think it is pretty easy to drink and still represents the style ok -a refreshing lager without a whole lot of German yeast character or hops, but still very drinkable and no major flaws to speak of."
"Pours a clear light amber color with a finger of head. Aroma is clove, nail polish, grass, and wheat. The flavor is pretty basic, mostly herbal hoppiness and bready malts with a slightly sweet kick. The body is light and carbonation is far too high. Overall this was a beer that would be drinkable in a session environment but doesn't really have much going for it otherwise."
"Medium drinkability, it was OK; I could pound these at a party or a football game to get wasted and would even have one or two at a bar, but it's not something I would seek out as far as a six pack purchase to savor the taste. It's a good to better than average beer for mass consumption."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly. I could definitely drink a few of these in one sitting."
"Cheers!!"
"I deem this beer good tasting and would enjoy a few more but, alas, I have not."
"Copper sort of color. Not much carbonation. One dimensioanl aroma-not unpleasant just there. Mildly sulfurish and blood like. malty flavor with an ok hop presence. Again it is just ""there"". Touch of toasted malt. Mildly bready. Ok mouthfeel-pretty standard. Average in a bottle. Would not avoid but not something I would not buy myself. If offered at a party go for it."
"Pours a copper orange with hints of yellow and perfect clarity. Briefly sports a frosty white head that leaves a wispy cap and a few wet lacings. Sweet bready malt aromas. Toasted malt and bread flavors, nut flavors in the middle and a sweet malt ending with a crisp clean finish. Medium bodied with refreshing carbonation. A very good Oktoberfest, unfortunately I only had one."
"This is the type of beer that makes me wish it were October more often."
"Put down 12oz with easy, and could drink more. A decent rendition of the style. Not my favorite, and not going to blow anyone away, but nonetheless a respectable local."
"Overall drinkability is good. Would make a decent session beer, but not very strong in the qualities that make up a good O'fest."
"I'd drink it out of a boot without complaint. I don't know if that's saying much 'cause in rugby we used to have to drink Steele Reserve out of old rugby cleats. C'est la vie."
"If you like weak beers, or if you don't like an Oktoberfest, but want to like it, this one is for you. Nothing about this beer stands out as bold in any way (again not a bad thing, it just is)."
"Could be more drinkable without the butter."
"D: Nice session beer...great effort for an American Oktoberfest."
"Impression: I support local brewers, but I won't be getting this again, as the many German offerings avail. here are far superior."
"I love both and will suggest to Friends"
"Overall it just really needed a little bit more for me to really get a grip of this one. I thought it was ok, but to be honest just needed more to finish it off."
"The beer poured to reveal a light bronze color. There was a small head and little lace. The aroma was nice with a scent of honey. The mouthfeel was very light. The taste was mild and refreshing with a taste of honey. The beer could use a little more body and spice, but was quite quaffable."
"Love this offering from Blue Point Brewery on Long Island. Pours a nice caramel color with a foamy tan head. Fair amount of lacing on the glass. Sweet, sweet malty caramel smell to it. The taste is also sweet, yet crisp and hoppy. This is a very easy beer to drink -- smooth, crisp, and very tasty."
"I have had many more marzens with more taste and sweetness then this beer. I usually find those beers tasty but kinda hard to drink. This beer does not have that problem as the sweetness isnot as assertive as many others in this style."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a orangy golden color. The beer had a off white looking head that started off great but did not last long.The smell of this beer was slightly sweet. The taste was nice with a hint of caramel and a slightly bitter finish. Good beer that I will buy again."
"Notes: The head retention was a bit of a let down for me but it was still a tasty Oktoberfest style beer. It was a little bit lighter in color and body than most but it was very drinkable."
"D: I wouldn't say this is a bad beer, but it definitely isn't one of the better brews you can drink this Oktoberfest season. I was expecting a malty, medium to full bodied beer and this one was just too light and watery."
"This was an okay oktoberfest, but there are so many great local seasonals out, I won't be picking up another six. If they went with a darker color, and a touch more body, this would be excellent."
"Drinkability: I like that Blue Point went a bit outside the box and didn't create a American Marzen that was overfilled with malt, yet they went to the German roots and created one that more likely compares to the German bred beers like Spaten, HS, and Paulaner. Very drinkable and easy to top of a six of these in a short period of time. One of the lighter fall selections you'll come across and a good one in that sense."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Nice amber orange color you'd expect from an Oktoberfest beer. Good head formation but dissipates quickly. Tastes like a fairly typical Oktoberfest but a bit more drinkable than most others that I have had and that's what makes this a great one... as Oktoberfest beers are meant to be drank in large amounts!"
"As my first taste of Blue Point Brewing Co., I'm rather impressed. They took a common style and put just enough twist on it to keep it simple, yet give it some character. Great stuff, and looking forward to the other offerings from them I have! Thanks a bunch Joe for the sweet extra!"
"Very drinkable, a solid October beer."
"D- This is a really nice easy drinking Oktoberfest brew. Full flavored with a decently light feel."
"Alcohol on the nose. Some buttery notes but there is this underlying astringency to this beer. Not sure what that is. Not sure if it is hops I'm not noticing as hops, but I'm not digging it."
"I could drink a few of these, but not too many. MaddHopper said it right--these sit heavy."
"A very drinkable Oktoberfest and is spot on for the style. I would reccommend trying this, as I found it to be quite good."
"A decent shot at a true marzen lager and more in line with German standards than a lot of over-malted American ""autumn ales."" Nice job, Blue Point."
"Blue Point had me thinking they were tailored for mass market tastes, after I had one of their summer ales. Now I'm starting to turn the corner a bit, and thinking this is one of the more underrated breweries from NY. This and the toasted lager have been solid, and now I'm eager to try some of their more rare stuff, like the sour cherry stout or the ESB. We shall see..."
"D: This beer is flavorfull and goes down very easy. I could easily drink a 6pk of this with little effort. This isn't the best Oktoberfest I've had, but still a solid offering from Blue Point."
"3.0 D: Decent but with many flaws."
"It was the perfect day for an octoberfest and this was a pretty good one to have during day. Rich copper color, good malty aroma, very easy drinking and, in general, a good session beer for the fall. Carbonation is a little light and the mouthfeel could be better but in general this is a good beer."
"Pours more of a golden color than the typical amber color of the style. Slight floral aroma to it. I like the mouthfeel for this one, more towards the lighter bodied side. Some decent taste here.. nice and sweet/malty taste, very smooth.. highly drinkable. Could use a little bit more body for my liking but definitely an above average octoberfest. Pretty good beer, throw it in your mix a six and give it a whirl."
"This is becoming one of my favorite styles to session and the Blue Point version will be a repeat purchase for me."
"Pours a very pale copper hue when compared to most of this season's oktoberfest styles, this one has a very nice bright white head with distinct chunky lacing forming with each sip. Seems to be contracted in Rochester at High Falls, seems like a trend for alot of crafts out there. Very nice spicy hop nose present, a touch of caramel drizzled on a biscuit cracker with nice lively citrus and grassy hops kickin'. A stong mineral water characteristic creeps throughout the entire drinking experience. Flavors is a bit dull in malt presence, a quick touch of caramel and biscuit that disappear quick and are replaced by a carbonated watery graininess. Not as much hop action as the nose was entailing, maybe a bit of lingering spicy hop edge in a burp or two but that's about it. Mouthfeel is pretty lackluster light to medium bodied with odd carbonation much a metallic mineral water edge with sweetness with a touch of rust and spicy herbal hop finish. Drinkability overall is decent not a beer I'd pick to win the race but one that I know will finish effortlessly, not the best craft fal seasonal out there worth a shot for sure."
"Pours golden with a very thick white head. Excellent retention and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready malts and sweet fruits. Nice,but weak. Body is on the light side with some carbonation. Taste is buttery up front with a malty cereal finish. A lighter version of this style,but worth a try."
"D- a fairly drinkable brew but a poor attempt ata 'fest IMO"
"D: Very drinkable, and the smooth finish leaves the beer enjoyable."
"M/D - Medium boided with a very lively amount of carbonation, almost tickles the tongue. Very easy drinking."
"Thanks For Reading"
"Drinkability: Not good. Nothing is very redeemable about this brew. Not worth revisiting."
"as this one warms up. overall nothing really to get excited about and i doubt i'd be trying this one again."
"D: Drinkability is perhaps its strong point here making this a highly sessionable oktoberfest and six pack worthy by all means. Worthy of prosting to and one that easily goes down."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful pale and Munich malt scent along with a fruity lager yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a solid pale and Munich malt flavor that goes down smooth and sweet with a nice dry finish. It's crisp with some prickly carbonation. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's brewed perfectly to style."
"Bottom line: A tasty example of the style that's pretty easy drinking and looks great in the glass. I like."
"Pours a clear amber with 2+ fingers of foamy off-white head. OK retention and some lacing. Smells of butter, toasty grains, bread, and caramel. Tastes of honey, bread dough, caramel, butter, lightly toasted grain, and a nice floral hop finish. Medium to medium light in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and sweet with a good balance and a crisp finish. A pretty good Oktoberfest, easy to drink, assumingly sessionable. Worth picking up again."
"pours a verry light orange yellow color with a 2 finger white head on top that was afraide to stay to long. the smell was musty malt and corn and the taste is just that starting a bit sour and the finsh is one of big malt with practly no hop present at all, this one is a big disapointment to me as their hoptacal illushion is one of my favriot beers in my state. i think that thay should go back to the drawing bord on this one"
"this is a good local oktoberfest. The color is a dark golden color. The aroma is malty, with not much else. It is a little on the sweeter side with little to no hop presence. It has a nice light mouthfeel for an oktoberfest with good,lively carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer for an oktoberfest."
"Right off the bat, this reminds of Hacker-Pschorr's O'fest for with smooth, yet lightly roasted caramel and hint of hops in the finish. Unfortunately, there are two flaws that really detract from an otherwise tasty marzen. At first I'm getting a metallic tang in the flavor and then diacetyl in the aroma. What a shame."
"Pours a vibrant, clear orange brown color with a small white head and slow rising carbonation. Sugary sweet malts on the nose, very floral and spicy, cinnamon, roasted nuts, woody and grainy. Caramel malt is dominant with a subtle hop scratch and a slight alcohol note. Not uber complex, sticky medium bodied but definitely drinkable. Good beer."
"Maybe not a classic, but a tasty interpretation of the style. Will revisit. Worth a try."
"There's a slight touch of odd astingency, though that may have been from carbonation, making it not quite as smooth as I would have liked it, and there is a slight thinness, but, overall, it's a fine O-fest with a nice sweet/bitterish balance."
"Not an offensive beer by any means but not something I'll probably be reaching for again"
"Not bad..."
"D_A decent stab at the style. However the mineral note is a bit too much and hurts the beer overall."
"This beer pours a light amber (lighter than other Oktoberfests) with a 2 fingered head and nice lacing. The smell is nice of sweet malts and spices. The taste is very nicely balanced with the sweet malts and the hops aftertaste. The main flavor I get is oktoberfest, sorry nothing else really comes to mind. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a nice carbonation level. I could see myself utting 3-4 of these back with no problem. All around a nice brew!"
"Drinkability is excellent. Not an overly complicated brew, just delicious and easy drinking. I can easily see this as a fall session staple. Will pair beautifully with traditional German food as well a just about anything from popcorn to football food like hot dogs and such. Good stuff to have on hand."
"Notes:Not much to say on this one because it was dominated by the ""butter"". I can not say it was bad,but a tad bit below average."
"Pours a clear copper color with an average white head that dissipates into a slight ring. The aroma is of buttery caramel malt, little rust, and a small hop spice. The taste is of sweet caramel malt, quite buttery, some honey, not much in the way of hops. Reminds me of a more malty version of their toasted lager. The buttery taste seems out of place for an Oktoberfest. The feel is moderate, slightly chewy, well carbonated, finishes with a malty sweetness. Not a bad beer but I have had better Oktoberfests. This one seems to miss the mark with the buttery flavor."
"Flavor is a little more tart than the smell. More yeasty tartness, malts, a citric-lemonlike bite, more on the carbonationed side. I like the bite of this beer, as many American brewers seem to lean on the sweet side for thier oktoberfest biers, this one stays biting, lighter an highly drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable, could kill a six pack in no time. Very well balanced and delicious beer."
"D - easy drinking brew, prost!"
"I'd have to say it's one of the better domestic Oktoberfests I've had and would put it up against Sam Adams version."
"Overall- A good decent sessionable season beer. Worthy enough to start off your night."
"A pre-release sample at Bellport Beer from one of the Blue Point brewmaster assistants. We poured the bottle into tasting glasses and noted the orange/gold tone to it as it came up with a sudsy head resembling milk froth. The subtle aroma of wheat and mild spices came to mind, but the first taste to follow was flowing with blond malts. I had to stop for a moment as the aftertaste was revealing most of the ornate elements. I couldn't reflect off of a beer judge to describe what I was tasting, but the base reminded me a delicious hefeweizen. I was sorry we only had two bottles, but I made mental note to buy a case of this upon its release this weekend. It was very easy to drink with nuances of the traditional Oktoberfest flavor to it."
"Don't get me wrong, its a good beer, but it wasn't what I want out of an Octoberfest. I will give it another chance, though, if I see it somewhere else."
"Nice deep amber color with nice rich head. Very smooth although a little on the light side for a marzen. While other reviewers noted that this was on the simple side I think that it is an advantage for this beer. Very drinkable with a sweet taste while finishing with a slight spicy taste."
"Overall a good drinkable marzen. Simplistic as far as the style goes, but a nice effort nonetheless"
"Not my favorite offering from Blue Point, but still quite drinkable."
"This is a good beer although I'm not sure if the understatedness is them not trying hard enough or purposeful and sophisticated. I like Blue Point, so I'll guess the latter. Fresh local growlers..get some.."
"On draft, pour a clear dark honey amber, with a moderate tan head. Leaving minor lacing. Nosa is sweet malt. Decent octobetfest, moderate sweetness, smooth and tasty. Lingering maltyness on the palate. Not the most exciting of styles in my book, but this one is pleasant and drinkable. Always good to support NY state. More respectable brew from BP."
"eh. that's pretty much the best word i can think of to describe blue point's oktoberfest. actually, if i didn't watch the bartender pour this one from the tap, i could have easily mistaken this for their toasted lager. it pours an amber colour with hardly any head to speak of and has a malty, bready smell to it, with hints of citrus. there was also a bit of staleness present in the smell, which is strange considering the bartender shared with me that it was just received and tapped that day. this one tastes average at best, and seemed a bit watery at times. not horrible, but maybe my least favourite o'fest this season. i'd try any other fest brews on hand before sampling this one, but at the same time can't say that i'd never sample it again. overall, average but uninspired."
"Dark copper color with a biege foamy head that sits low, but leaves spotty lacing around the glass as I drink. Nose is sweet and fruity. Flavor is sweet malt, with hints of apricot and honey. Mouthfeel is tingly. A lingering mild hop bitter creeps in as the aftertaste."
