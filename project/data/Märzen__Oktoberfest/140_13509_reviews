"Here's what the label tells us: ""Our take on the classic festival beer has a silky malt flavor with an initial sweetness that sets up the interplay of mild toffee-like notes and floral hops."" Also, this: ""Everyone loves a great party, and there are few quite as famous as Germany's Oktoberfest. Inspired by that rollicking celebration, we bring you our variation on that classic festival beer. Oktoberfest is medium-bodied and rich with malt flavor, but maintains a crisp finish marked by floral hops."""

"Overall: One of the better Sierra Oaks beers, very good."

"A solid Oktoberfest. Not my favorite style."
""
""
"D:  Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest is an enjoyable quaff.  Rich and malty while still crushable.  Seems to have much more depth of flavor than most other Fest beers.  Slightly authentic and yet unique at the same time."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is ok and overall is a good marzan"
""

"Overall, for a first crack at an Oktoberfest by Sierra Nevada this one does not disappoint. Would love to see this in sixers."
""
"Pours out a deep orange-amber with a thin head.  Smells malty, grainy, and with a hint of noble hop.  Taste is huge on caramel, bread, honey, brown sugar, piloncillo, raisin, and Grape Nuts.  Grassy and herbal noble hop comes out strong in the finish.  A bit sweet for me.  Mouthfeel leans towards thick and is sticky.  The flavor profile on this is solid, but it's a tad too sweet overall."
"What Oktoberfests can and should be."
"O - this is like the brown ale of oktoberfest marzens. Stunning, bold and simply delicious. It's malt forward aroma pops and it's luscious flavor delivers a wonderful experience. Unique and one of my new favorite Oktoberfests. But it's not only about it suiting me as the quality is there as well. Let's hope this is a new bottled tradition from the great Sierra Nevada Brewing Co."
""
""
"O: Not my favorite Oktoberfest brew, but not bad by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a very drinkable beer, I'm not a huge fan of the Marzen style but enjoy it during the season, I would buy this again no problem.  Sierra Nevada is one of the best brewers around, I've enjoyed every beer I've tried from them."
""
"Somewhat bitter and hoppy, clear with a beige head."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is more lager-esque as a nice malt backbone strikes with burnt caramel and toasted grains. Fruitiness disappears and is replaced by a mild floral hop bite on the back end. This is a damn good Oktoberfest and SN would do the US a favor by releasing this in 6 and/or 12 packs. It reminds me a bit of Paulaner's marzen with a bit more toast and rough edges. Quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest:  Another solid offering from SN.  A Clean, classic representative of the style."
"This pours with a bubbly character and a lighter barley brown color. Airy barley malt aroma with a tinge of nutty biscuit. Taste has a bit of chocolate, barley grain, nutty pecan, toasted biscuit malt and a touch of caramel. Nothing about this is assertive but it does the job of relaying good complex flavor in a relatively inexpensive package."

"O. It’s ok. To be blunt, it taste like a mixture of Old English (which I like) and SN’s Flipside (which is amazing by the way). Good buzz for 6.2%. 3.5"
""
"From bottles dated 07/18/14, part of 'Fall Pack Seasonal Sampler' 12-pack: A toffee presence as described on label, on top of a fairly sweet and toasty malt base; slight hop presence.  I perceive a considerably salty finish that is mildly drying, with perhaps a note of black currants or nearly burnt sugar, some spiciness with a hint of rye, and mild alcohol warmth.  —Reviewed 26 October 2014"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is rich, heavy, and malty, with an almost sweet character. I get plenty of toffee, caramel, some fruit underneath, and even some nuttiness in there. Complex and faithful, this is a totally solid brew."
""
""
""
"O- Not bad. Sweetness is really up there. Wish there was a bit more hop flavor."
""
""
""
"Probably the best part is the mouthfeel.  It's full flavored but feels like a lighter body on the tongue.  Great carbonation level that's adequate, nowhere near fizzy but I wouldn't call it modest either.  A nice sweet start then it moves to a spicy, earthy (yet clean), dry finish.  Crazy drinkable, this is the perfect Octoberfest for when the weather hasn't gotten to cold yet.  Perfect beer for the type of weather when you're in the back yard in jeans and a tshirt and think to yourself, ""I might need to put on a sweatshirt pretty soon"" type weather.  Great beer from a great brewery, solid representation of the style.  I'd expect nothing less."
""
""
""
"Dark amber color, very clear, with nice carbonation bubbles continually floating upward. One finger thick beige head.  Smell is sweet maltiness, with just a hint of caramel. Taste is bready malt, with some caramel sweetness, and slight peppery notes. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, not all that great feeling on the palate, kind of meh. Overall not a bad beer, but there's a lot of better Oktoberfest Marzens out there."

"Overall: outstanding and well done to the style."
""
"Overall 3.75: Right on the line of being a ""4.0," this beer is nonetheless the best American stab at a maerzen that I've tried so far.  True to the style but still its own brew, this is definitely one worth trying among all the pumpkins and Oktoberfests out there littering the shelves of your local bottle shop."
""
"Overall: A decent beer, but one of SN's weakest offerings. They should have brewed this one more traditional, without the non-standard malts and weird hops. This was easily the worst beer in the Fall 2014 sampler."

"O: A solid American o-fest. The maltiness really plays nicely with the light hoppiness. I'd probably buy it in 6-pack form if available"
"DATE TASTED: October 9, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ayinger willibecker...OCCASION: Thursday night feeling like Friday already... APPEARANCE: clear, reasonably dark, actively carbonated amber body; an ample one-finger off-white head is creamy and remains tangible throughout; lacing is appropriate. AROMA: toasted malts are sweet like toffee; some perfumed yeasts tinge the experience... PALATE: substantial and remarkably creamy for a fest; active on the tongue (and some on the teeth) but moreso at the throat...TASTE: impressively sweet toffee and caramel linger long after the sip ends; hops are blanketed by the mega-malts, as the genre predicates; late doughy hints...OVERALL: as part of its Autumn sampler, this beer could be the cornerstone, as it sets the tone with its malty confidence--who says these West Coast brewers only ales?..."

"O -  A highly drinkable Octoberfest"
"12 oz bottle as part of the Fall Pack. Clear, copper colored pour with a large white head. Head fizzles down to a thin lace. Bready malts with a noble hop aroma to balance it out. A bit more body than its German counterparts. Very dry somewhat metallic finish. Overall, a really good Oktoberfest that is better than most American versions I have had this year."
"O- This is a really nice Marzen with good balance and rich malt profile.  The hops came through more as the beer warmed up.  Pretty traditional take on the style."
"O - This beer has me wanting to try some more Oktoberfest beers.  Wish they sold this in a six pack,  I would definitely pick one up but it only comes in a mix pack which the only two beers I care for are this one and Tumbler.  A mix twelve pack of this and tumbler would be really cool.  Anyways another great beer by Sierra Nevada and one to try if you like this style of beer, Cheers!  P.S Bring back Tumbler!"

"Clear rusty amber color beneath a small head of lumpy off-white foam.  Aroma is mainly clean, toasty maltiness, sweet bread crust, apple, and very mild spicy hops.  Flavor continues with the malty sweetness but substitutes nutty cookies and caramel for whatever light fruitiness came through in the nose.  Bitterness is moderate, as is any hop flavor.Medium bodied and smooth finishing a touch dry.  Quite enjoyable!"
"Garnett orange in color with yellow hues on the sides of the glass and excellent clarity. Poured with a short off-white foam that reduced to thin wisps. Bready, toasted and sweet caramel malt aromas with light toffee notes at the end. Medium bodied with a smooth delicate feel down the middle and subtle, tangy, crisp carbonation on the edges. Bready and caramel malt flavors followed by toasted malt into the middle. Crisp, earthy, herbal hop bite through the middle. Crisp hop bitterness slowly fades to the end as this finished smooth and cleanly with a light herbal hop and toasted malt aftertaste."

"O:  a bland, bitter with no juice or good taste beer that reminds me of an adjunct lager ... it's got far too much medicinal/alcohol taste and little to no discernible malt flavor ... maybe a pinch of toasted malt sweetness, but it's not much.  kind of a dead beer and my least favorite of the four beers in Sierra Nevada's fall box of beer"

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 7/1/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest style! All around great complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall:  I wasn't sure what I was getting into with an Oktoberfest from Sierra Nevada.  This is very enjoyable and better than some American Oktoberfests that have been made for many years.  The malt flavor is very complex and develops interestingly.  Theres a hop bitterness but it balances very well and is most evident in the balanced finish.  Theres a good toasted flavor that doesn't get too strong and turn into flavors of a brown ale or porter.  Good job SNBC."
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid Oktoberfest with a heavy malt profile that is balanced well with some sourdough bread notes and characteristic Oktoberfest spiciness. The hops are not overbearing, giving the beer the sweetness that it needs to pull off the classic malt flavor."
""
""
""
"Clear reddish copper pour with a white one-finger head. Big aroma of malt and honey with a hint of piney hops. Taste is malty and grainy with a slightly sweet edge. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Also has a touch of brown sugar, caramel, spice and (minimal) floral hop flavors. Dry finish."
"Overall - A commendable but not outstanding Oktoberfest. Comes in this year's SN Fall Variety Pack, along with the much missed Tumbler Brown. I'd have no qualms about picking this up again in the 12er, even if my end game is the Tumbler!"
""
"12 oz bottle from variety pack.  Pours copper with long lasting, foamy, white head.  Body is full and crisp.  Grassy, herbal hops, toffee and bready malt fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry.  One of the better Oktoberfests IMO."

"One and a half bottles into a stein produce a dark deep bronze color with a fluffy light beige head atop,a decent crown.Sweet caramel in the nose over top of some lightly spicy hops,a little sweet smelling.Buttery caramel flavors along with some sweet pizza dough notes before a smattering of herbal hops come into play.An above average O-fest beer but maybe just a little sweet."

"Bright clear red amber in color with an inch or so of light khaki head that settles relatively quickly and laces a bit.  A bit thin in the nose with only a touch of fresh caramel malts coming through perhaps followed by some aromatic hops.  After a sip the malt comes out and is highlighted by some of the darker caramels and roasted barley.  Floral hoppiness is there, perhaps more than is normal for the style and there is a little less sweetness than you would find in many of the other popular O-fest beers.  The body is medium and the finish is just a touch dry with the hops leaving some bitterness behind.  Overall I'm quite pleased by this, while I find that it is a little less sweet and smooth than some other Octoberfest beers it is an interesting variation and typical of Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"O - I don't think this is a particularly traditional version of a Marzen, but it is a delicious one.  I enjoyed this, and would seek out again in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this one much better than the Vienna lager from the fall mixed 12 pack. I have not tasted the brown yet. Although I have had it the past, just not given it a good assessment for purpose of review. Perhaps tomorrow."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, pretty damn good. It's in my tip 3 favorite marzens."
""
"Pretty amber with a beige head. Scent of sweet malt and floral hops. Bread, toffee and burnt sugar notes. A note toward the end reminds me of Steen's syrup. Finish is crisp and dry. Very well-made and a great seasonal."
""
"O 3.75 - I like the richness of this one, but it makes it less sessionable. Still, it's a nice take on the style."

"not typically a fan of Oktoberfests, but I do love Sierra Nevada. This is pretty tasty, malty sweetness and richness with a nice hop bite to it. WOuldn't prefer this over a Tumbler or Flipside, but I'd drink a few on as things turn Autumn"
""
""
""
""

"Malty, biscuity, caramel and a light roasted malt. It also has a spicy hop variety present. Very drinkable and to the style."
""

"8/23...finally the Fall Pack! This one pours amber reddish orange, with light white foam. Modest malty nose. Little sweet. All malt forward taste, caramel/bready/chewy. An ever so slight bite at the back. Crisp, clean, and loads of flavor. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty, well done Marzen. I could easily go through a 6 pack of it."
"Copper color.  The nose is pretty mild. The toasty malt is very pleasing as is the mildly dry and bitter finish.  Definitely above average in the style but not among the very best out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice take on the style. I really like the chocolate notes. This is a great fall beer that is worthy of its own release, in my opinion."
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
"Solid marzen, nice aroma and decent flavor, and pours pretty.  Easy enough to drink.  There are other better offerings in this style though, some that are cheaper and/or easier to find depending on where you live.  It's not bad but it' isn't memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thats why I like it so much. It has the borderline roasted taste and it's not sickening sweet."
""
""
"A nice rich malt creamy mouth feel with caramel and almond rounded out by toasted bread. Ends with a slightly bitter hop bunch - cardamom. A very nice octoberfest rich and full of flavor.  This one is deeper and darker than other marzens - very complex and very good."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a pretty good example of the style.  Nothing special, but worthy of a drink. 3.75"
"Solid attempt at the classic German style, but it cannot compare to the originals."

"Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest -----4/5."
"O:  A very nice American take on the style, not as caramel heavy which is nice.  Too many American Oktoberfests tend to be overly sweet, and I didn't find that to be the case here."

""
"O: Very solid though nothing extraordinary"
""
"I really enjoyed Sierra Nevada's rendition of the Oktoberfest, and I look forward to having more as these last warm summer days turn into cool autumn nights."
""
"This one deviates very widely from the style, but still tastes good and is one of the better jams on the style I've had."
""
"Overall: Really like this, but it seems pretty boozy and the spiciness overpowers any caramel notes that I look for."
""
""
""
"-Bottle- Yeah, it's still 90 out but it's Oktoberfest time in my gullet. Pours pretty like all other Sierra Nevada brews. Clean, clear, dark amber. Thick tan head that subsides to a thin ring. Lots of lace. Aroma is mild. Smells very festy. Caramel, yeast, toast. A light hiccup of hops. Flavor is of toffee and caramel and toast. More bitter than many of the style. Medium bodied with peppy carbonation. A pretty good Oktoberfest. I should probably wait until it gets a bit cooler to drink the rest of these."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a tasty Oktoberfest and manages to hit the style dead on."
"The Oktoberfest style is one that everybody does, but it seems like many of those beers just don't end up standing out. Sierra Nevada, though, has made one worth remembering. This is an easy-drinking interpretation with a surprisingly nuanced palate, and to me, that's what this style is all about: high quality beer that you can put down in high quantities."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-  Pretty good oktoberfest. I'm not huge on the spice hop and brown sugar combo towards the end, but the malt presence at the beginning is great.  Probably the weakest from the fall pack and that's not saying much at all. (85/100)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting take on the style, not quite on par with the Fatherland but a tasty brew nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Too ""spicy"" for my liking. My husband says it tastes more like a brown ale."
""
""
"Taste / Palate: The flavor is packed with sweet caramel and whole grain bready maltiness up front. The middle adds a bready nutty character and then this is all backed up with a firm earthy/spicy/leafy hop presence. The hops add a good balance of hop bitterness as well. The palate feels firm and well rounded. It’s carbonation is right on and keeps things lively and very drinkable even at 6.2% abv."
""
""
"This beer is hands down the best Okty that I've tried thus far this season.  It's easy to quaff despite the maltiness, and is quite delicious.  Purchased as part of a Fall variety 12 pack for $13.50.  I'm going for the Tumbler next..."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. Good quality but a bit too bitter and a bit too sweet for my tastes. There are better fall beers out there, including SN’s own Tumbler and Flipside IPA."
""
""
""
""
"This is an extremely drinkable and tasty Oktoberfest. I feel it's just a hair too sweet, and a hair too syrupy."
"Conspiracy?!?  Maybe, but either way, I am just not feeling this one as an Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very complex and balanced Marzen.  Extremely good.  While I know there are a ton of Oktoberfests out there, I wish this was their standard seasonal, as I like it more than everything else they have released for the ""fall"": Anniversary IPA, Tumbler, Red IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Drinks easy, a pretty good take on the style, not quite world class, but I would buy again if sold in sixers ( 4.0)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent Beer. It is what I would expect from a big brewery octoberfest. Drinkable and I would drink again. It has quite a bit going for it"
""
"This is a very enjoyable Oktoberfest. I'll have to drink a few more to compare since this is my first of this genre for the year. 4"
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of an American version of an Oktoberfest, the flavors seem to be a little bolder than they are traditionally, but that's what I've come to expect from most American examples of the style, but they didn't seem to loose any drinkability and it made for a tasty and drinkable beer.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, a little crisp, slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a very nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially around the Bonfire on a cool fall evening.  What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, I thought they were both very nice and they were the highlights of this beer to me.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would change and there's nothing that I disliked about this beer.  I would buy this beer again and I would for sure get a six pack of this during the fall if Sierra Nevada ever decided to release this on it's own and while it works good in this fall variety pack I think it could hold up to being released on it own.  I would recommend this to just about anyone especially if your a Oktoberfest fan.  All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I was expecting this beer to be nice, but I didn't think it would be as flavorful as it was and that toffee aspect was really a nice touch.  It isn't my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, but I have to say I think it's one of the better American example of an Oktoberfest that I have had so far.  Great job guys, this was really nice beer and I enjoyed drinking it, keep up the hard work."
""
""
""
""
""
"A deep marzen, very earthy and autumn like.  The beer is smoother than I originally thought.  I prefer the lighter Oktoberfest beers but this drinks well."
""
"Overall:  A little too nutty for my Oktoberfest tastes, but overall a well executed, flavorful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty goodness not the best Oktoberfest beer but the slight toffee notes are a nice touch"
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
"Overall: It unapologetically pushes (even shoves) at the Oktoberfest boundaries, but, does so in a rather tasty, smooth, malty way, so, it's rather hard to hold it against it."
"Overall:  Not a bad beer.  However, I really like Oktoberfest beers, and this was not in the same vein.  I'd say this was closer to the American version of an ESB.  While I appreciate Sierra Nevada's attempt to create ""our own take"" on an Oktoberfest, a brewer cannot change the malt and change the hops and still expect it to resemble a German Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
"O -- Well, this *is* a SN beer, so I guess the hoppiness shouldn't *really* surprise me, but I guess I had higher hopes.  However, SN's use of German-style hops is very nice.  Maybe this is where they show expertise, because I've had German-style beers brewed by U.S. micros that over-do the hops to a point of palate-wrecking, but this beer doesn't go that far.  But no, not my favorite Märzen by any means."
""
"O - A decent offering, but bores the palate after a while. Not something I would necessarily seek out."
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
"I'd heard this was coming out on one of the BA forums, love SN, and love marzens, so this review will definitely be slanted in their favor. Got this in the fall pack, which is a great variety pack overall, but this is probably the standout (though the Vienna lager was a nice surprise...and the Tumbler's in there too). Pours a deep reddish amber, leaves a collar after a fleeting head, and appears fairly inactive until you drink it. Super malt, caramel and toast aromas, with some cherry and spice. This has some big malt to it and a molasses flavor, barely any bitterness, just earthy and malty. I really like this beer, and I think SN really made it their own. Will get again. Very soon. Hope they do it in sixers in years to come."

"D- I really, really enjoyed this beer. I was so surprised about the bitter finish in an Oktoberfest. One of my favorite styles of beer, I liked the roasted flavors, darker than most color, and the hint of bitterness at the end. This lager seems hard to find, but I will enjoy one every time."
"Overall a tasty and clean Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability: Another high-quality beer from Sierra Nevada. I'll probably order this again next time."
"Body is about right, a little thinner than usual, but as I said I liked the flavor much better. A little dry, good per style, and generally an enjoyable sipper all the way around."
"Easy drinkin'"
"D: a decent session beer, more typical of a summer picnic type of drink then a fall era."
"Drinkability is good. A nice example of the style. It strikes me as being a bit different than your ""normal"" Oktoberfest"". But this is still a tasty beer, and certainly worth a try."
"I liked this one overall. It's simple and well made, like most other Sierra Nevada brews. I enjoy some of their regulars a bit more, but as far as Oktoberfests go, this one, while safe, still has a bit more flavour and body to it that many others."
"Came in a pint glass a clear brown with a moderate sized head that had decent retention. Smell was nutty and caramel. Not very Octoberfest like but still good. Flavor had a big caramel malt background with some mild spiciness. Also this is the hoppiest Octoberfest I've had. Reminded me somewhat of a brown ale. Medium bodied. Overall it's a good beer but is nothing like a traditional Octoberfest."
"Cheers!"
"Draft at Ruby's BBQ in Asheville."
"It's got all the malt basics, but not enough to fill out thwt it's trying to be. The hops are missing any nobility, and while I like to see something different come around, the current profile falls short here as well. I will say that it goes down smoothly, more because it's a bit sparse than because the palate desires more. So I've tried it, but in a world of very good Oktoberfest beers, merely above average isn't going to cut it."
"A new brew to me, not really sure how his made it to Syracuse, but good for us. Basically a classic oktoberfest beer with a bit more hops. Nice creamy body with malty, caramel flavor and a slightly earthy hops flavor and bitterness at the end. Not amazing, but I wouldn' t turn down a litre."
"This oktoberfest poured a clear, deep copper-red color with light tan foam that setted. The smell was lightly fruity and malty with a characteristic Sierra Nevada aroma. The taste was lightly fruity with a good dose of hops and some Munich malt flavor. The mouthfeel was dry overall with medium body and moderate carbonation. The aftertaste was lightly fruity. This was a pretty good oktoberfest beer."
"On tap at Mad Mex in State College. Pours a dark slightly-amber copper with a medium-sized, off-white, frothy head that slowly diminishes to a thin film. The smell is malt-dominant as expected from the style, but this one is far from being one-sided. Caramel and light bread are accompanied by a pleasant citrus and herbal hops presence. The taste is a nice balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness, with the hops dominating the palate only late on the finish. Some nice flavors in there, caramel, nuts, orange and some kind of herbal flavors. It has a medium boy, dry texture, and lively carbonation. This beer was much more hoppy than I expected, but once I got used to it I really enjoyed it. However, I dont feel its a very good representation of the style, so I have to knock its score down a bit. But its worth trying if you ever come across it."
"Had this brew on tap over at Mahars. It was poured to a dark amber/copper color with a fair sized white head to it. It left a nice amount of lacing at first and then as the head broke down the lacing lessened. Noticeable Malt taste with a bit more hop than October brews I have had in the past also a noticeable spices. Not what I would expect in a true Octoberfest but a excellent brew regardless. One I would and will get again!"
"Served a dark brownish amber with an off-white head. Tastes kinda big and hoppy with an oktoberfest backing. Certainly not to style, but that's not such a bad thing here. In fact, I'd give it a higher score otherwise because I wasn't expecting the dark and hoppy in an ""oktoberfest"" but I like it."
"On tap at the Fair Oaks brew fest in September. Pours a copper/amber body, with a fluffy white head, good retention. Some hoppy bitterness, but mostly sweet malt flavours. Sweet, caramel, and some spice. Medium bodied, easy to drink. Has a distinct flavour that takes getting used to."
"The smell is has solid malt content with a nice touch of spices. The taste turns that around with a serious yet well blended addition of hops. Caramel makes an appearance as well. The mouthfeel is hefty and very pleasing, while the drinkability is certainly good."
"Kinda like their brown ale, it's not really great for the style, but it's a nice beer unto itself. Fits the bill for either a malty or a hoppy brew. Even handed in it's boldness. A nice little change of pace for the season, as I tire quickly of oktoberfest-style beers these days."
"Like I said, this is an average beer."
"The beer came off the tap a ruby amber color, with a finger of head that had a little staying power. The nose was dominated by caramel sweetness, maybe a little brown sugar in there as well. The taste was not really what I expect in the style. It was very sweet and caramel, not much of the spicey flavor I expect in an O-fest. The mouthfeel was moderately thick, with a carbonation that balanced well. Drinkability was good as well. I enjoyed my pint, but would go for many other O-fest beers over this one. Try it if you find it."
"On tap poured into a sample glass. It pours a deep cola color with one finger of slightly tan head. There is good lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty, with some caramel sweetness coming through. The taste is also sweet and malty. Lots of caramel and toffee. A little bit of hops on the finish. Great balance. The mouthfeel is good, and the drinkability is fantastic. Another nice Sierra Nevada draft treat."
"Appearance: Dark ruby body with a caramel toned creamy tan head leaves specks of lacing behind. Aroma: Mild caramel and nut tones from the toasted malts slight hop profile a bit edgier than the usual O-fest. Taste: A sugary caramelly tone with a nutty edge and herbal hops, not horrible but left much to be desired. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied pretty smooth drinking easy going carbonation. Drinkability: Decent Oktoberfest style that I was excited to see considering not many Sierra Nevada seasonals make it out to the Burgh."
"Overall this is a very unappealing and unimpressive beer. I recommend you avoid this brew."
"Color aside, this is very much an easy drinking oktoberfest. Nice sweet malty flavor with some bitterness at the backend."
"I'm not a big fan of the O'fest style but had to give Sierra Nevada's offering a try, given the time of year. It's a decent attempt at the style but I'll stick with their pale ale, porter, and stout."
