"Dundee Oktoberfest -brewed by Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 5.50% When Dundee Oktoberfest pours out, it is a nice light brown color ,with a nice white head.  The smell is rich sweetness and spices. You also pick up on some grains and malts in the smell. There is a lot going on in the taste of this brew.  You pick up on the spices and malts. Dundee Oktoberfest has a smooth taste, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. I though there would be more to this brew but it is ok. I was hoping for more flavor in this brew.  More spices and flavors.  For what it worth this is mild Oktoberfest, but it is good tasting. The mouthfeel is nice and clean, with no bad aftertaste. The mouthfeel is is and clean and refreshing. This is a good drinking brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5.  I would get this brew again."

"Not bad at all, well, nothing special either, I had low expectations but found the beer reasonably tasty.  Certainly much better than the regular quantity beer.  The cost of $4 a six certainly helps the score."

"Decent small town US take on the Oktoberfest/MÃ¤rzen style beer."

"O- My own mini-Oktoberfest consisted of a blind side-by-side-by-side tasting of Oktoberfests by Sam Adams, Saranac, and Dundee. Surprisingly, Dundee fared the best of the three. I'm not very well versed in Oktoberfests, but Dundee was more complex and simply stood out as something special."
""
" The flavor has some subtle caramel elements of malt with a nice clean yeast flavor with slight woody hop accent, however the flavor seems muted and not as malt forward as it could be. The taste has a gentle toasted grain flavor which is pretty standard for the style. overall the fest is pretty standard, by the numbers...good but not exceptional. I would drink this again, but it isn't worth seeking out."

"O- You cold do worse, but you cant do worse for the money."
""
""
"O: not great for the style, but not undrinkable, lacks depth of flavors though"
"As far as I can tell, this is the last O-Fest I've got. Not sure if I'm pleased with this fact or not... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear auburn-bronze topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises sourdough, toffee, and a kiss of greens. The taste holds notes of very sweet caramel, light candied orange peel, dry bran, and brown grass. It's a strange dichotomy on my tongue between the sweet and the dry/grainy that luckily moves in shifts, rather than just sitting poorly on the tongue. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel. Overall, a decent O-Fest, but nothing to get anywhere near excited about."

"First brew from Dundee and I like it. A better take on the style than some of the better craft breweries out there. A great price point for a good Oktoberfest. I will seek out again."
""
""
""
"O: I like this Oktoberfest it's more rich and malty than some with a great mouthfeel. Nice take on the style."
""
""
""
"I find this to be a nice example of the style; I've had others from brewers with a bigger rep than this and they weren't as good. A good effort from Dundee, me thinks."

"I sampled this beer along with two other similar choices (Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat and Sierra Nevada Tumbler) and it seemed thin and devoid of taste or flavor. I really expected to like it more but was left disappointed. The color and appearance was good, the taste was not."
""
""
"i love this beer cant wait for this comes out , everything about this beer means fall , one taste and i fell like im in the woods walking on leaves crunching them with every step , the beer is cool and crisp and makes me feel good all a perfect beer in a glasss so enjoy a beer this beer i know i do"
""
""
"The feel is light and leans more toward crispness than smoothness with a bit more than moderate carbonation."
"Overall- Not bad, I've had better oktoberfest beers but this was worth a try."
""
""
""
" O: This one is on the same level as the Sam Adams version for sure . Will be fun to drink throughout the season. Can you say grilled brats ."

""
"O. I'd have to have a taste test, but right there as the best Oktoberfest I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a lot different than most of the other Oktoberfests I've had.. almost like a different style. It's not bad, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: October is well in the rearview mirror ,but I had been saving a few O-fest beers waiting for the right time to review them. This is a good, easy drinking beer. A very approachable Oktoberfest beer, one to introduce a person to the style. I will likely look for this again next year."
""
""
""

""
""
"O - Looks good, tastes alright, but overall subpar. A fairly one-dimensional profile. Lacks a little in complexity and balance. Not bad for the price, but wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad Oktoberfest beer, I liked this and at $5.99/6er the price is great."
"Pretty one dimensional with the sweet malt dominating pretty much everything. But the sweetness works and I find myself wanting another one."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. Perhaps not the traditional German Marzen, but certainly worth a try."
"O: This beer looks amazing and smells so good. The feel is really great too. Too bad the taste is a bit lacking. Other than that, pretty solid Oktoberfest. I preferred this over the Spaten."
"Overall not a half bad beer, I enjoyed it quite well."
"Pours a nice ruby chestnut color with a 1 finger head that creates alot of sticky slime. Smells of nutty malts, spice and caramel, with a faint grainy lager type smell. Strong robust malty backbone with an almost fruity center, followed up with a sour grain finish. Light on the mouthfeel, very easy to drink. Overall this beer is worth buying IMO esp for the price. It is a nice easy to drink and enjoy lager."
"O- Not a great beer nor a good representation of the style, but not unpleasant either."
"'Sallright. Poured with a nice sized, foamy, frothy, cream colored head that settled down to a few islands quickly and no lace. Color is a lovely, clear cherry, copper amber. Aroma is malt, toffee, caramel, a bit of fruit and roast. Flavor is less interesting than nose, the same stuff, just less intense or interesting. Body is ok and carbonation is a touch fizzy. Finish is like flavor and on the short side."
"I wouldn't suggest this unless you're tight on money. Not a bad beer, but not a good marzen."
"Overall- I was alot more impressed than I thought. Really good beer will buy again. Cheers!"
"Overall, not bad at all. Great session brew. I thought it was phenomenal a few years ago, but it seems like a lot of good Oktoberfests are getting mundane (I'm looking at you Sam Adams and Leinenkugel!). Oh well. Worth a sixer for sure."
"Pours dark reddish amber with large white head. Aroma of cinnamon, bread crust, slight medicinal notes and hazelnut. Tastes of hazelnut, bread, some spice, malty sweetness, and clean hop presence. Light bodied with light carbonation. A beer worth skipping over."
"overall: a by the numbers Marzen that adds up and is a decent drinkable beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Best I've had in the style."
"Overall: To be honest, the only reason I picked this up was because I was craving an Oktoberfest and it was $5.99 a six-pack. I was expecting mediocrity at best. I was actually a bit surprised; this is light on intensity, both in terms of aroma and flavor, but the flavors/aromas that are there are enjoyable and style-appropriate. I would not buy this regularly, but at 6 or 7 bucks, I'd pick this up from time to time for sure."
"O - Not worth the purchase. If it wasn't for the lightness, probably wouldn't have finished."
"This is probably the worst Oktoberfest I've ever had. It's a damn shame too. I look very forward to the fall season because I find the beers to be among some of the best at that time of the year. This was just a major upset here. There was an ok looking color to it but very thin on taste and mouthfeel. Where did all the seasonings go?"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I can barely get this down without gagging. The mouthfeel is just unbearably unpleasant. I think that after drinking five of these, I'm finally going to give up on this brew and chuck the last one into the trashcan. Perhaps I will try a different Dundee brew in the future. But this is just ridiculously gross."
"Red-copper in color with a medium off-white head that is partially diminishing. Aroma is primarily toffee with some raw wood sawdust and something I can only liken to American cheese singles. Lightly sour, moderately sweet flavor - rather high in hay/straw graininess. Sour grain and sourdough bread finish that is quite long lasting. I've had better Oktoberfests."
"Very well-done and enjoyable, and definitely a good bargain for a craft-style beer!"
"Verdict: A decent choice thus far for Oktoberfests. Flavor is pretty bold and peppery, not bad. It's worth a shot when Fall comes back around, so get it next year! C+ (3.15)"
"D-I wouldn't search it out again, but in a pinch, it'll do"
"D: A good Marzen."
"D-Really a pretty easy drinking Oktoberfest, not great, but a solid example."
"Overall-Average Octoberfest, does the job but there are much better ones out there. No major issues though."
"This beer poured with a thick 2 finger head (good retention). Finish was clean with a copper/amber color. The nose is of malt and caramel. The taste confirmed to be a sweet malt-like flavor, with a slight finish of hop. Carbonation is moderate, but the beer feels a bit heavy. Definitely couldn't drink more than 1 or 2 of these. Not my favorite Oktoberfest. Seems a bit too sweet. There are so many better, Oktoberfest beers out there that it is hard for me to recommend this one. It is cheap though."
"Dundee's Oktoberfest 12oz into 0.4l ALSACE Fischers tulip. Pours a clear amber color with copper hues, a nice 1 1/2"" bone white head that stays around for a bit then recedes into a thin film which remains throughout the drink. Smells of sweet pale and caramel malts, lightly roasted malts, biscuit, and a touch of grain. Drink is medium carbonated. Tastes of caramel malt, a little biscuit, and a slight hint of red grape. Somewhat sweet aftertaste lingers for a few minutes after, not cloying but pleasant. Overall a good rendition of the Oktoberfest style, but all in all not one to write home about. I picked up a 6pk for $5.99 on sale, so @ that price not a bad buy. I recommend pairing this brew with pan seared pork chops seasoned only with a dash of salt and pepper. Cheers!"
"This brew is not on par with better examples of the style."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is a moderate copper-amber with a light tan head. Not too much retention or lacing on this one. The aroma is a bit faint with a little bit of earthy hops as well as some light caramel and toffee. The taste brings a bit of caramel as well as some slightly-toasted bread. Feel is a bit light but overall pretty good. A nice and easy sipper; middle-of-the-road, but it'll do the job in a pinch."
"This was the first time I ever heard or seen of Dundee's Oktoberfest so I had to give it a try. It pours a dark copper color with a thick head of foam. The scent is not very strong but it has a very full flavor that drinks very smooth. This is perhaps the best Oktoberfest I've had thus far. A must try!"
"This beer has a very nice amber color, and was only docked points because of the near complete lack of head/retention. That being said the beer tasted very malty and wasn't lacking in carbonation; it has an almost sour taste along with the crystal malt flavor. It is very typical for the style, but is well done, and as such for the price is as good of a marzen as you could find. Very drinkable, and nice mouthfeel, certainly is smooth enough. Solid example of the octoberfest style."
"Aroma is crisp and malty with a subtle tone of spice, not strong but still inviting. It pours a nice clear coppery amber with a decent pale tan head. Flavor is malty with hints of spice and - could that be pumpkin? Texture is smooth, a little tingly, a bit on the thin side but still acceptable."
"Not the best beer I've had, not the worst. It's average, that's the best description. I'd get it again if there was no other offering."
"D- It's pretty decent. However, in a style know for high drinkability, this one isn't quite there. While I like my Oktoberfests on the bold and malty side, this one's almost too sweet. All said, it's pretty cost friendly. Something I'd probably pick up when I'm a little lighter in the pocketbook."
"Surprisingly solid. No complaints except for the out of whack carbonation. I'd buy a 6-pack of this, especially at the price (about $7 I think.)"
"Clean and crisp drinkabilty, a definite session beer."
"DB- Not bad at all. Right down the middle for the style. Does its job with the Fall feeling and has a refreshing flavor."
"Drinkability - Good-tasting, but not a whole lot of complexity."
"Drank easy enough, I would pick a sixer of this up before I would most of the O'fests I've had this fall to include Sam Adams & Left Hand. Not a bad effort at all!"
"D- Definitely a fall beer! Enjoyable but not something I'd go out of my way to get"
"Definitely drinkable with a meal or by itself."
"D: Very desent beer that I do look forward to having a few every year, maybe not the best of this variety but definitly a keeper"
"Overall a great smelling Oktoberfest that actually looked good until the head quickly eroded to nothing. A weird acrid spiciness worked-over my palate pretty quickly, and that did not please me. I'd rather drink this with some sausages and strong mustard & kraut than drink alone."
"D- This is beer screams fall and it very enjoyable, while it isn't anything special. It is a solid Octoberfest."
"Drinkability: Eh, it's a one and done-r."
"D- For a beginner this might not be the easiest beer to drink. Its a fine beer to drink after a long hard days work in the fall."
"d- overall this is a pretty good season beer i would recommend it to anyone who has the chance to try this beer"
"A crappy O-fest."
"Overall the beer was a pleasant surprise, but not what I would expect for an Ocktoberfest. Definately would drink again but would like to see it with a bit more hop taste."
"D: Not the best but certainly not the worst Oktoberfest. I would certainly have another but would not seek it out exclusively."
"D- The flavors of this beer are very enjoyable. It really hits the spot and makes an excellent first oktoberfest of the season."
"Overall I was very underimpressed with this beer."
"On-tap at Clark's Ale House for $3.50 a pint. Appeared a clear orange with a short white head. Like the other Dundee beers, this is a simple but tasty drink. There's a dry but sweet caramel taste that dominates with light candied bread undertones. Clean and drinkable, I'm sure it's a fine beer to drink a stein of."
"Cheers!"
"D- Not a bad Maerzen; leans a little too far to the sweet side for me though."
"Deep amber in color. Off white head quickly falls leaving lacing in its place. Smell is malty sweet with toasted grain. Sweet spiciness as well. I smell cinnamon and brown sugar...crazy I know. Taste is caramel sweetness up front. Gives way to grainy/bready sweetness. Some bittering in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Easy drinking Octoberfest. Not the greatest but certainly not bad and at $5.99 a six pack you can't go wrong."
"Not a bad Oktoberfest, but it's a bit sweet. Worth a try."
"Good flavor what what it's worth and easy to drink. Worth a try."
"(D)- A fine oktoberfest. Not the first one I would choose, but would never turn it down if offered to me."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are many others in the style that I would pick first."
"Overall, this beer is not my type of octoberfest. Dundee doesn't seem to be able to make a beer to the style. It is malty, but nothing seems to match up here."
"I cannot believe what I am about to state..this is the best Oktoberfest beer I have had this fall, without a doubt. Now, I will not buy Ayinger any longer, because it is waaaay overpriced, so that being said. Pours a more reddish colour than amber, nice looking beer..No tracing down the glass, but a head that is not soapy. Great, spicey scents on the nose. Twinge of hops as well. Goes down crisply and smoothly, nothing offensive. Good nutty, caramel flavors shine through and no lingering aftertaste. Beer can be drank constantly and the price is great, too. Now, Genessee, you tweak any of this recipe and you will lose a customer. I am going to purchase ANOTHER case this fall!"
"Drinkability - Very smooth. Another please!"
"Pours a deep copper color with a moderate off-white head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of caramel malt, a touch buttery and doughy, and some grassy hops. The taste is similar to the aroma. Caramel malt with some metallic notes, and a spot of lemon; the buttery taste is not really present. An earthy tea-like bitter hop rounds out the brew. The feel is of a moderate body with tingly carbonation, good balance between sweet and the earthy hops, finishes a tad sticky. A standard american marzen brew; caramel malt profile with earthy/grassy hops."
"Tastes like is smells...very malt forward, bready. Hops are there, kind of earthy, but not very prominent. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with some stickiness in the end. Fairly drinkable although, as others have said, the sweetness does catch up after awhile. A basic and reasonable example of an amber version of Oktoberfest beer. I might revisit, although there are many other versions that are better examples in my opinion."
"24 NRs for 20.99=a good value"
"Pours beautiful red with a generous tan head with a creamy look and feel. Aromas of sweet malts and citrusy hops. The taste is very toasty and earthy, not nearly as sweet as the nose but that is not a criticism. A very tasty marzen and [at least where I live] an excellent value for a six pack."
"Brownish-amber colored beer with a quickly fading head.Aroma is mainly caramel malts.Taste is bread,caramel and toasted malts.Overall refreshing and enjoyable.A great beer for those mild autumn days and chilly fall nights.I would buy again and recommend."
"Fairly drinkable, though the maltiness is perhaps a bit too forward for continuous quaffing. After two bottles, it begins to become a bit cloying. Still, a rather well-crafted example of the style that, for the price, can almost not be beat."
"this beer pours a nice clear copper color with a tan head that sticks around pretty well. the aroma present the lager yeast in the front with a bit of caramel roasted malt and some nutiness. the taste brings a lot of malt character to the party, with the nasty little bottom feeders doing their thing well. the medium mouthfeel and good co2 make this an easy drink."
"Pours a clear, copper color with a healthy head that faded quickly to a ring with minimal, chunky lacing. Has a nice malty, slightly toasty smell to it. The first hit is the malt, and then a crisp rush of carbonation followed by some pleasing bitterness. The finish is fast and the body is a bit on the thin side. A fairly straightforward beer with good drinkability, held back somewhat by a lack of character."
"D: For a Dundee offering, it's pretty good. Compared to many other oktoberfests, it's somewhat pedestrian, but I enjoyed it well enough."
"Pours a dark amber with a tanish-white head. Smells like pumpkins. I hate hot weather, and it's still August, so the pumpkin smell might get a better rating out of me since I am longing for the fall season. Anyways, this has much more of a malt-caramel taste than the more traditional Oktoberfest hoppy flavor, with a pumpkinish finish. Mouthfeel is average. This is a solid Octoberfest brew, but I'd probably mix it up with another fall brew."
"A clear amber color pour with a thin white head that quickly fades , some lacing left behind. Aroma is sweet caramel , toasty ,with some faint wood notes. Flavor is malty ,sweet caramel and bread dough , some lite spice . Medium body with a crisp mouthfeel , medium carbonation with a malty sweet finish . Quite sessionable and better that expected."
"Dundee Oktoberfest is a crystal clear, sparkling amber beer with an off white film of a head that dissipates and leaves great lacing on the glass. There's not much aroma to it. It smells a little sweet and pretzely. It has a medium body and a chewy finish that's a little chalky. It tastes pretzely and mellow. There's a tiny touch of sweetness that's well balanced with a green, leafy bitterness. Yup, Oktoberfest."
"D- a very drinkable brew, tastes more like a traditional fest, one of genny's best offerings IMO"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some malts. Taste is big on malts, somewhat sweet, notmuch else going on. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
"This beer has a medium body, substantial in the mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation."
"D: I think I'd stay at one. Too light for the style. Non-offensive. OK but not great."
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with eggshell colored head and unexpectedly nice lacing. Smell: toasted and caramel malts and noble hops... smells kind of like their pale ale and their discontinued amber. Taste: straightforward with caramel and a touch of Munich malt alongside toasted malt and faint noble hops. Mouthfeel: light bodied, smooth carbonation but with a hard water feel. Not bad, worth the $5/6pack."
"Overall a decent Oktoberfest."
"Pretty good beer. Its nice to be pleasantly surprised."
"Not a bad beer, easy to drink."
"i was pleasantly surprised at this version of an o-fest/marzen. worth a try, and one i would revisit in the future if the opportunity arose."
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Caramel nose. Flavor is caramel with the hops in the background - almost but not too sweet. $1.20 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Easy to drink, very far from special, but then again that is my general impression of the marzen style."
"drinkability: i could drink alot of this beer its kind of light for an Ofest but a good solid beer..only $23 for a case you cant beat it..def worth a try"
"Dundee (now Genesee) Oktoberfest is a paint-by-the-numbers version of a style that is not among my favorites. That said it got (most of the way) onto my good side early and stayed there throughout all 12 ounces. Along with Dundee Porter, this is probably my favorite HFBC beer."
"Appears a clear caramel amber orange hue in the body with a large off white head forms thick with ample lacing cling evenly across my dimpled mug. Aromatics are clean with toasted malt sweet caramel noted and mild herbal hops blended with mineral water. Flavor has again a very clean and subtle moderate sweetness with a touch of toasted nuts and caramel malts weight in but no heavy it's more like Oktoberfest light but in a good way. Definitely a well crafted brew from High Falls, excellent drinkability light to medium bodied even sturdy carbonation, nothing here is too heavy just maybe at times a bit too muted if I want something really flavorful. If I'm grabbing a sixer though, this is a contender for sure especially in the fall around Thanksgiving football time of year."
"Drinkability: I am a fan of Oktoberfests, and this one didn't dissapoint, but it was somewhat average (I don't want to say bland) in comparison to other Oktoberfests. That being said, this beer was rather drinkable and I would recommend it."
"Not bad. I think it's a good example of a marzen and likely cheaper than my current favorite marzen, Sam Adams Octoberfest. I think you should try a bottle of Dundee Octoberfest and decide for yourself."
"Drinkability: Eh, it's tolerable, even okay at times. Like a proper Oktoberfest that got the volume turned down on it."
"This is a pretty good beer. It's right in the mainstream of Marzen's, with an amber transparency and a full-finger whitish head that dissipates quickly along with the lace. A sweet caramel aroma leads into a smooth full mouth with sparkly carbonation. It's sweet on the palate, and finishes off with very slight bitterness without a lot of satisfying oopmph. Pretty drinkable, but not particularly memorable."
"D- It is a lil heavy to be pounding this back. It filled me up pretty quick but a nice beer for a dinner."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful malty scent that boasts of pale, Munich, and crystal malts. It's quite good actually. The taste is good also. It has a very smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with some breadlike character. It has a nice crystal malt sweetness as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good Oktoberfest. Most of the ones I've tried lately have been lighter in color and not as complex. This is a very good Marzen."
"Feels dry but also milky. Full-bodied, like the label says. It's a big, milky autumnal beer. Terrific."
"Because of the carbonation i would probably only be able to drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"The body is slighly light for the style, but it only slightly cloys, making this a very drinkble beer. A decent out of the gate fest for the boys from New York."
"D - This is a pretty good tasting and easy drinking Oktoberfest. Nice offering in the Dundee line of brews."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable. Altogether a decent brew, maybe more of an amber lager than an Oktoberfest, but still well worth trying."
"Served 43 degrees. Dark amber color with a smell of sweet malts. A good sweet carmel malty taste with a bit of hops. Light tasting and very drinkable for $6.99 a sixer. Drank most of the 6 from the bottle (what heresy!). Not bad overall. I expect to see more of these weak ""Octoberfest"" since seasonal's are so popular."
"Simple take on the style here that could have maybe have done with a little less sweetness and packed a touch more body. Decent stuff though that went down easily."
"This is a solid example of the unexciting side of the american amber style. I wouldn't mind having a few of these."
"Don't overlook Dundee. They're doing a lot of things right these days."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer with a nice clean finish."
"This beer makes a decent supermarket choice; certainly not a bad deal at $6.99/sixer. Could've used a better balance between the malts & yeast, and definitely better carbonation, but otherwise an acceptable take on the Oktoberfest."
"D - Good stuff. I just wish it had some sort of scent. I'm a big fan of sniffing...I often nose a beer for five minutes before I even drink the damn thing, and this one ruins that part of the beer-xperience for me. All around, this is a good beer despite it's one major flaw. This is one I wouldn't mind sessioning on a cold late autumn day...I'm thinking huddled around a bonfire with friends sort of sessioning here."
"Notes: Overall it's a good offering for good price."
"d. This is a good offering from Dundee. I will say any self respecting brewer that can't make a good O-fest is pretty unexcusable. This is a good O-fest. Solid and affordable. Cheers."
"D: Pretty much a typical Oktoberfest, in my opinion. I have yet to encounter a great one."
"Overall impression: This is a relatively simple Oktoberfest, but for the price it is a pretty good offering."
"Pours a clear, straight copper underneath a three finger head after avery hard pour. The head recedes to nothing and no bubbling.... I don't get it. Good color and thats it. The aroma is just straight forward sweet malt anda soft grassy hop. The taste is nice toasted mlats ixed with a shetrock dry grass and adjunct. The taste leaves pretty quick, but it is has undeniable octoberfest beer flavors, just cheapened a bit. Still pretty drinkable though."
"Eric"
"Overall a decent choice for the price. Nothing offensive or off-putting, just don't expect to be wowed."
"Drinkability is moderate. Not the best Oktoberfest I've had, which limits it a bit. Poor quality isn't the most fun to drink, but it is sessionable and inoffensive."
"Drinkability- pretty much the same as above"
"Pours a light toasted amber with a thin head. Some faint corn-like aromas. Tastes exactly like Coors Light with a little vienna malt in it in my opinion. Light and drinkable, definitely does not live up to the slogan ""Be full bodied"" though. Disappointing because I had enjoyed all of Dundee's new line of beers a lot."
"As with ALL the high falls brews (in exception to the very very tasty porter), if they used more higher quality ingredients to create their beers they would be much more impressive. High falls continues to release OKAY but mostly lackluster beers. I know they are capable of so much more! I also understand they are in a weird position of a kinda macro brewer that has been trying to look like a microbrewer."
