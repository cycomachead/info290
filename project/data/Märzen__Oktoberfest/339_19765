I like Flying fish, local, lots of options, but this was not the cats meow, it came from the other end. Brooklyn, Long Trail and Yards are my go to after this. Now I have a week of this. If it improves, and I grow to like it, I will revise review. The man cave needs top notch brew, and this does not not make the grade. PS- I have had more than 30 brews pass thru my tap. Update: after almost a week of this fish, I have gotten a little more used to the taste. Still would give a D grade. Ordered a 1/2 Yards PPA at $165 9.26.13.

The taste was unusual, dank, earthy and not typical marzen. Mouthfeel is this beers best feature, rich, soft and pleasing. This is not representative of the style but a nice drinkable brew nonetheless.

The aroma was plain and simple with toasted malts with a splash of juicy fruits backing it up. The taste was lightly crispy with toasted malts, a tiny touch of juicy fruits, and a subtle hint of crispy floral hops at the finish line.

I'm hoping the beer's skunked, and if it is, I will rewrite the review--if not, this is not an enjoyable brew for its style, with its caramelized sugary bluntness dragging down the more mellow characteristics of the beer... and Flying Fish is usually on point...","dacrza1","0"

Had some subtle hop notes mixed in with the malt scent. Some roasted malt flavors mixed deep in the nose. Taste was smooth and crisp very easy to drink. Nice malted profile with a decent caramel tone. Mild hop taste in the finish. Just a hint though not very distinct. The malt certainly takes the majority of the flavor. Rather light bodied. Decent beer but not my idea of a true to style Marzen Oktoberfest. Great drinkability and a good flavor lend to the quality of this crafted brew.

Smell was mostly malt, but the hops present are certainly either centennial or cascade. Grapefruit / pine resin in an O'fest? No thanks. Taste was even worse. Not that it tasted *bad*, it was just simply not an Oktoberfest and *definately* not what I was expecting; Malt dominating at first, followed by a pronounced ""West-Coast"" style hoppiness.

While nothing here will leap out and grab you, it will pat you gently and allow you to enjoy one after the other, though responsibly of course. For being brewed in my backyard, I think it's one of the more faithful Oktoberfest beers whose label isn't printed at least partially in German. Smooth and easy to like, it makes more than one a pleasant task to undertake.","Foxman","Oct 03, 2005"
4.27,21.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"It pours a medium brown-amber with a medium-sized, foamy, off-white head that doesnÂ’t stick around too long. Malts are dominant in the nose, of course, with aromas of caramel, butterscotch, nuts and hints of fruit. It has a very nice malty flavor with a light lemony bitterness to back it up. Pear and white wine notes in there as well. The finish is dry with a lingering light sweetness late. It has a medium body and moderate carbonation. I really enjoyed this one, one of the more impressive Oktoberfest seasonals IÂ’ve had this year. Enough character and body to keep me interested, but still highly sessionable. IÂ’d buy it again if I could get it in this area.","ski271","Sep 24, 2005"
3.28,-6.8,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured clear copper with a very generous white head. A very nice pouring beer if I may say so. The head was relatively long lasting and left a nice bit of lacing on the glass as it withdrew. Aroma was malty and sweet though not heavily so, a touch of smoke. Taste was balanced over all - starting with sweet caramel malts and fading into a short dry finish. Pleasant brew that paired nicely with sausage, spaetzel, cabbage and crusty bread.","Citadel82","Sep 18, 2005"

3.48,-1.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium bodied tawny chestnut brown. Toasted grain and malt nose, hops are only lightly detectable. Not as full bodied or complex as some German examples, though has a solid malt character with wheat, grain and dried fruit characteristics. Hops barely bite in the finish and could use more bitterness for balance the sweetness. Still a nice local session beer as the seasons change, for that in-between period of Philadelphia weather, not quite cool yet but thankfully the blistering humidity is gone. The mates and I bought a case and it didn't last but a day or two. Not too shabby.","IrishRedRock","Feb 01, 2005"

3.18,-9.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Poured clear, bright with an orange-copper color. A thin head of off white foam topped off this one. The aroma is interesting and a bit strange. Light toffee and caramel malt but also has some perfume like notes, that I guess are coming from the hops. Taste has a grainy sour quality that just doesnÂ’t some to meld properly with the rest of the beer. I guess this can be called an eclectic oktoberfest, rather than an authentic one. Lightly sweet and malty in the finish. Not bad, with points for originality.","pezoids","Nov 03, 2004"
3.83,8.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a crystal clear well-carbonated liquid that was orange/brown/amber in color. The head that was created off white to light toupe in color, fairly thick and creamy to the taste ant touch, some stickiness was noticed. There was some spotty lace throughout the glass, not like a true lace but more left over spots that drug to the bottom. The aromas that came from the glass were on the light side, but roasted malts and nuts were noticeable, some dry leafs, earthy ash, light fruit in the later aromas and finished off with a yeasty appeal to it. The flavors from this beer seemed to be bolder and more pronounced then the aromas. Tastes of cocoa, nuts, dark roasted malts, some leafs and ash were present all through each sip. Some sweet fruits were noticeable as it warmed in the middle of the sip, as well as some light herbal hops and dirt. But one thing was consistent was the all end sips were of yeast and yeasty nut bread. The aftertaste that was left was of bread yeast and a dry feeling on the tongue. The body was on the light to medium side. Interesting beer seemed to have lots of malt and earthy flavors that were pronounced and consistent all through each sip. An enjoyable beer and real easy to drink.","Jarod","Nov 01, 2004"

3.72,5.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Anyways, this fall ale isn't bad. It looks nice; lighter than a true marzen. It has a surprising amount of fall spice in the smell and taste; nutmeg and ginger mostly. I was pleasantly surprised at the hop character and bitterness of this. That's what really made me think, hmmm...not a real marzen. The malts are there to lend a little sweetness, a little of that nutty sweetly esteric flavor, but only just a little. This stays easily drinkable and nicely even in its elements. Just don't call it an Octoberfest, call it a seasonal ale.","99bottles","Sep 29, 2004"

3.56,1.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Malt dominant aroma, smelled a bit musty but after a few sniffs it seems more like cocoa. Medium sized cream colored head is fairly dense and leaves a solid coat of lace as it fades to a dense film. Clear golden amber colored beer. Malt from the aroma hits first in the flavor, cocoa joins in after a second while a crisp hoppyness keeps the malt from going overboard. Body is on the light side while the mouthfeel is slightly slick. Cocoa flavor/aroma made the beer seem stale, just didn't dig it.","HappyHourHero","Beers"
3.67,4.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Deep coppery color-slight head and some nice lacing on the glass .Nice aroma-slightly nutty,toasted malt and a touch of caramel. Malty flavor upfront-subdued hop bitterness. Has a touch of caramel sweetness in the finish. Very nice body-not as thin as some ""fests"" though Im likening that to its being an ale versus a lager. A good beer-decent fall seasonal.","lackenhauser","0"
4.03,14.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I was pleasantly surprised at sampling this one, as the 2003 version reviews were mediocre. While I'm not sure this meets the usual ""requirements"" of an Oktoberfest; it is damn good. The mouthfeel is especially intriguing--I wasn't sure I liked it all that much, until I had sampled a couple. In taste, I think it rivals the O'fests from Germany, which are available in the USA? Unfortunately, I can't get this one in CT; but got a six in NJ visiting the in-laws this past weekend. Will ask them to get some more for me. This is definitely one to try, if you can find it. Good job to the folks in Cherry Hill, NJ.","sraimondi","Sep 29, 2003"

3.53,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark pinkish amber color. Nice fluffy white head. Sweet malt (caramel) nose with sharp hop notes. Initial stinging taste of hops is followed by a sweet malt coated tongue and throat. Medium slightly thickish mouth. Very hoppy and bitter for a marzen. Not a traditional tasting brew, the errors however lean to my taste preferences.","frank4sail","Oct 29, 2002"
3.65,3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5," Silky smooth as you would imagine out of the cask. The body was medium, and not lacking a bit at all. I would definitely not call this your typical Oktoberfest bier, but it was enjoyable. Much more floral than its Deutsche counterparts, Flying Fish gave this brew an interesting little twist. Sweet malts balance the hops well to make for a simple, but good brew. It is definitely more along the lines of a cask ale than an Oktober.","ElGuapo","Sep 13, 2002"

3.97,12.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"2002 version. ""Not the ordinary Fest beer! Savory malt profile, generous hop finish."" This beer is intended for draft only, although I tried it in both cask version and bottle today. It's very deep copper - almost brown in color - with a foamy light tan head that holds very well and leaves some very good lace. The aroma is mainly of a toasty Munich malt - very clean and nice. There is a light fruitiness, but it doesn't seem out of character for a dark lager beer. The body is medium-light and the carbonation is standard, but it definitely has a presence in the mouth! The flavor starts with a Munich maltiness, followed by a nice, light hop flavor - almost unoticeable at first - but then reveals a moderate bitterness and finishes fairly dry. The hop flavor and bitterness are present but don't really go any further than that. A nice beer with an interesting toasted malt profile; but not overly exciting compared to standard Oktoberfests. Still, an enjoyable quaff for the fall season.","NeroFiddled","0"
