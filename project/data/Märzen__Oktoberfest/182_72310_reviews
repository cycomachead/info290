"Another poor attempt at an ""Oktoberfest"" beer by a mainstream company. Glad it was free."
"Admittedly, this isn't my favorite style, and this one certainly isn't going to change my perspective, but it is similar to many other Yuengling products: solid and inoffensive, but a bit boring and unexciting."
""
""
"One of the better Oktofest beers I've had"
""

"One of the better Oktoberfest brews on the market! Best served in kegs!"

"Overall- I was surprised since this is a very good O-fest and is from a macro brewer. Definitely these would go by fast as they are thin, inviting, and agreeable to all."
""
"Oh, this is very nice.  The initial flavor is an interesting blend of hop and malt, but it grew on me VERY quickly as the great malt profile swells.  I really like this one."
""
""
"The Oktoberfest, however, falls short; but at least they've opted to go for more of a Vienna-style than just a malty-sweet golden ""Festbier"". The appearance is good, and the aroma is OK, but the flavor is lacking. There's some caramel to it, but overall the malt fails to display any depth of character. Some lively spicy hops bring it around a bit, and there is a touch of toasty sweet bread to it as well as a light fruitiness, but it still seems a bit threadbare overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright copper. Light for the style but still malty. Not the best example of the style but not bad either."
""
"Overall: Yuengling Oktoberfest sadly underwhelmed me.  I hoped it would be at least somewhat satisfying.  It wasn't.  I drank Warsteiner Oktoberfest when I got home.  It made the Yuengling taste like stale bread mashed into dirty water.  That is all."

"O: I am not a Yuengling fan in the least, but this brew really is not bad. It does not make me want to rethink my opinion of most of this brewery's products, it does not really challenge my indifferent attitude toward this style, and it does not make me want to rush out and buy a case, but I would not turn this beer down if it were offered to me again."
"Pours a dark orange with a slight foamy head that dissipates rather quickly leaving just a thin layer of bubbles throughout.  The smell is malty, sweet, a subtle hint of caramel.  The taste is malty, with a slight hint of sweet fruit.  Pretty standard stuff.  Not much kick to this, but enjoyable nonetheless and can be purchased as a six pack for just about $7.  Fair alternative to some more pricier oktoberfests, but you get what you pay for."
""
""
""
""
""
"And despite how many say this is a bad brew or just ok.....rather opposite....its very well into the good range, yes it is rather light and very sweet/less malty vs others/big names of this style but still its very drinkable."
""
"Overall- Ok brew, I prefer their lager but this isn't terrible"

"Not a bad beer. Very drinkable and smooth taste. It could use more hops, but still solid."
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours amber with tall, long-lasting, fluffy white head. Aroma is of some hops, caramel and fruit soda.  Body is medium and astringent.  Astringent hops, caramel malt and some grain fill the mouth.  Finish is long and unpleasant.  The brew to avoid."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's solid but not the best of the style.  Definitely a Yuengling product."
""
""
"Yuengling makes great beer and Oktoberfest (Märzen) style beer is my favorite. If you live in the northeastern US it is very inexpensive, making it one of the best beers per dollar and my go to drink when it is in season."

"3.46/5.00"

"O: at the price point, not awful... got my hopes up with this, considering how well their Summer Wheat came out... this just falls well short... heaven forbid you have this with pancakes (I couldn't help myself), any subtle toasty malt character will be nullified"
""
""
"Average Oktoberfest.  Slight toasted malt and caramel/toffee sweetness in the nose.  Flavors follow suite, grain-like and grassy.  Overall, very light bodied, crisp and clean."
""
"This beer really surprised me, I thought it was delicious and smooth, something you can sip on or even drink fast if that's what your going for, just the right amount of flavor not over the top at all like some seasonal beers can be. Over all I recommend this beer! and its a couple $ cheaper than most 6 packs as well so that's a plus!"
"O: For the great price (7 dollars a six pack!), this give you a beer with a bit more flavor than their flagship Traditional Lager. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. This would be a good go-to beer if it wasn't a seasonal."

"Pretty shitty"

"clear amber color, foamy white head that fades.  fairly sweet aroma, all malt.   taste has some biscuit flavors, a touch nutty.  a little too sweet.  thinner body and medium carbonation."
"Yuengling Oktoberfest Brewed by Yuengling Brewery with an ABV of 5.45% This brew pours out a nice brown color with a nice white head.  This is a filtered brew you can see right thought it. I like the color of this brew. So far this brew is ok. The smell is rich with grains  and some sweetness. The taste is rich with flavor and some sweetness at the end.  Oktoberfest has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Yuengling did a real nice job with this one.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is no bad aftertaste to this brew. Oktoberfest has a clean finish to it. Overall I'm giving this brew a  4.25 out 5. This brew was better than what I was expecting. I would buy this brew again."

"Okay taste, a little light in flavor. A drinkable everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My palette must be completely out of whack compared to most other reviewers, but this was horrible. It was bad enough that I didn't even want to finish it. I so wanted to like it as Yuengling is my usual default when out and about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite variations of Oktoberfest beers. I had it at a friend's house a couple years back and now I can't find it anywhere. Do they still make this brew or not?"

"Yuengling' festbier is a pleasant surprise, kind of like a toastier version of their flagship lager. I've had worse Marzens from true craft brewers."
""
""
"Overall a decent beer. I was eager to taste this one since the summer wheat from yuengling was so good.  This one was a little bit of a disappointment as I think I would prefer the traditional lager to this one."

"This is a good Oktoberfest beer. I picked this up while traveling through Pennsylvania. I stopped to pick up regular Yuengling and saw this next to it in the cooler. It's pretty close to Shiner Oktoberfest. I was pleasantly surprised. It's like most Oktoberfest beers. It's malty and sweet. Give it try whenever it comes around in the fall."

"If the metallic notes and fruity esters aren't there, this would be a decent beer. It's a touch sweet but not bad. Good malt character."
""

"great oktoberfest. Not the best i tried but very much addictive for an oktoberfest. Honestly I like this Oktoberfest better than Sam Adams. Kudos to Yuengling for another wonderful beer. I know their beer list is small but I have liked all their brews so far except 1. but i guess that goes with any brewery."
""
"The feel is easy enough and despite the load of bubbling in appearance the carbonation level is really low."
"O: this is a solid choice for a readily available (at least in my area) Oktoberfest that can be enjoyed as a session beer and is much more affordable than its many counterparts. A sweet and crisp selection that I won't say ""no"" to."
"An amber beer, with a slight whitish head and a clear complexion. The smell is malty, and clean, but also a little subtle. I like this beer much better than the traditional yuengling lager. Medium-light in body. Medium in flavor, but not at all bad.some bread and a faint hop flavor in the finish. Smooth."
"while I would have no problem drinking this Beer if someone hands me one,I personally would not buy it,or seek it out again,as I said,not a Bad Beer,but not worth looking for either,because there are so many Gr8 ""Octoberfest"" Beers out there.Cheers & Peace2All."
""
""
""
""
"O: While I prefer a more robust Oktoberfest beer personally, this beer was really popular with my relatives whom are not beer connoisseurs and was probably the best option where we stopped to grab some beers. A little sweeter than I prefer my beers in the style and a little too watery."
""
""
""
"Thankfully, the alcohol was not detectable in this and if I had another one, I'd probably kick back with it too. This is almost as mindless as a beer gets and only worth a go once if you're in the mood for near-session Octoberfest offering. Even the bottle wasn't green and not that it mattered, but I almost wanted to find something to take away from this. It's decent for enjoying the season with, but not for much else unfortunately."
""
""
"Yuengling Oktoberfest is a very good beer for the price. It pours a nice rust color with a slightly off white head and good lacing. Smell and taste are good with a slight bitter after taste of hops, but overall high quality Oktoberfest for small price. Defiantly a great beer for a Sunday of football."
""
""
""
""
"O - Ever since I had a Yuengling Light I have been turned off by this brewery. I was given this beer. Otherwise I would have never bought it, and I probably won't buy it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Typical Oktoberfest style of beer. Both the hops and the malts flavors are mild and balance each other well. A good Oktoberfest beer."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but the taste seems too sweet and watered down for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not really worth picking up a case for but on par with the amber lager. I think I will still pick up the amber lager over this considering it easier to drink as less expensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuengling Lager with just a bit more mouthfeel and chewiness in the malt palate. More like an Amber vs a good craft Oktoberfest. Paid about $28 for the case, so not a bad price, but there is not enough substance to make me purchase another case. I would love to see Yuengling experiment just a little bit with their hops. No variety."
""
"Was excited to try this beer. Was even more excited to spit it out. Not the worst beer ever, but certainly one of the least of its kind. It makes me sad. Its tastes slightly of sweatsocks and despair. Its fine if you are into self abuse, otherwise skip it."
""
"If you want to pay 15 bucks for a six pack, you could find a better Oktoberfest. But for $6.99, this is an awesome beer. Deep color, creamy head, spicy aroma, and multi dimensional flavor profile. Good stuff! Pour it into a glass so you can truly appreciate it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not half bad, drinkability is pretty high and with this beer being clean and all I'd certainly go back for more."
""
""
""
"As we all know, Yuengling is America's oldest brewer. Now they have crafted this seasonal, something that they have not done before as I can remember. In any case, this can be best described as an average expression of this style that hits all the buttons: it has a dark copper color, minimal head; there is an initial apple nose along with a sweetish caramel subtlety. Not bad, not great - a Goldilocks beer: just right."

"DATE TASTED: September 7, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Sam Adams lager glass... OCCASION: a beautiful Autumn football night...APPEARANCE: handsome dark amber body; steady, full effervescence; thick and creamy off-white head; slick, sporadic lacing--solid if not attractive... AROMA: bright, punchy (almost medicinal? band aid?) malts that do not distinguish themselves positively...PALATE: thinning, mouth-quenching consistency; surprisingly active at the teeth, denoting some hop presence...TASTE: doughy bread malts mesh with bittering hops to produce an ESB of sorts; a flattened profile as the glass drains--toasted cereal lacks the malt punch or sweetness that elevates better marzens... OVERALL: the sum of its parts? a reasonably drinkable, affordable fall alternative to higher-priced fests...the flipside? not festive enough, considering the proliferation of marzen possibilities at most distributors now..."
"The texture is not clean, and pretty grainy overall, though the medium body is good and it's somewhat smooth. Crispness adds some bite."
"O: This could have been far worse. Honestly, I like it more than Sam Adams Octoberfest, and would never refuse this. But is it a good marzen? Not quite. Go into this expecting a slightly sweeter version of the Traditional Lager and you'll probably be happier with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Was this just a mislabeled bottle of lager?"
""
""
""
""
"I was very disappointed with this brew. It seems to me Yuengling bottled yuengling lager and stuck an Oktoberfest label on it. A lot of breweries are coming out with there version of an Oktoberfest. One of the best that has the authentic taste is by Sam Adams. When I drink that makes me feel like it the middle of fall watching football."
""
"It may be cliche, but I friggin love Sam Adams version. Should have got that instead."
""
""
""
""
""
"I give it a 3.25"
""
""
"I'm surprised at the low scores for this beer.  Must be the snob factor since the regular Yuengling is very boring.  For a Marzen, this beer is very well crafted.  Beutuful in the glass with excellent head and body.  Smells wonderful.  Taste is flavorful with sweetness and malt but suble and creates the sessionable drinkability you want for an Oktoberfest brew.  Overall this is an under the radar brew that deserves a lot more accolades than it is getting for this style.  I personally have it rated as one of my favorites out there."
"D - Meh... Pedestrian and passable at best... I really was hoping for a bit of a surprise, but didn't find one... Honestly, wasn't too much difference between this and Yuengling Traditional Lager..."
""
""
""
"Caramel and toasty bread. Mild sweetness on the tongue and throat but not the least bit syrupy. No overwhelming hop character. Finish is almost too dry. Uber sessionable. Lacks the depth, body and character of true craft, but damn nice for $6 a six, from a sudo-macro brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, this was a good Octoberfest. It's one of the better low cost beer beverages I've had in a while and I'll get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuengling's Oktoberfest is a fine beer, but its not exactly a traditional Oktoberfest- its a Oktoberfest-inspired lager that's made with common American technique, recipe, and ingredients. A nice reinvention, albeit simplified and rugged."
""
"A very watered down / bland mass-appeal kind of O-Fest ..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice drinkable Oktoberfest Brew. Tried many different Marzen Brews from Ayinger, Paulaner, Sam Adams, Spartan, Munsterfest this will keep up with the top 25 out there easily. If, you live in Pennsylvania, nice with an open fire for a fall evening as the mercury dips. Enjoy!"

"Pours a clear medium coppery amber hue with a slowly fading beige head. Aroma and Taste of toasted barley, grains, caramel malt, some yeast and light fruity notes. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a toasted barley and grains, yeast some caramel flavor and some light fruity notes ending has a bit of nutty flavor. Overall a descent drinking brew."

"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Poured a nice deep amber with a creamy white head that lasts a while and leaves lacing. There is very little to the aroma aside from a slight sweetness. Taste is pretty much the same, with nothing distinguishing to it and a little bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is better, with a little bit of carbonation and a nice smoothness. But pretty bland overall, unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is exactly what I expected in an Oktoberfest from yuengling. Decent beer, not to threatening to light lager drinkers."

""
""
"O- Overall, I like this better than a lot of other Oktoberfests I've had. Would I buy more than a 6 or 12-pack of this? No. I think it was a good beer considered it was simply a seasonal offering from Yuengling."
""
""
""
""
""
"i poured this one into a pint glass, It has a brown color body with no head just a very thin lace around the top. The smell is faint of malt. The taste is very sweet malt almost honey sweet. Mouthfeel is watery and light and overall i don't like this one too much .I wasn't impressed at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was just fair. Woudn't buy this again."
""
"O-nothing special but really no flaws"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuengling Oktoperfest pours a burnt orange color with a finger of head. The aroma is sweetly malty. The taste is kinda like an amped up Yuengling lager actually, especially on the finish where it has a bit of that watery taste. The malts are more full, nuttier, a bit sweeter than the OG Yuengling. The nuttiness is most apparent on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is great. Overall, it's a tasty beer that really is quite reminiscent of the original Yuengling lager."
"Medium bodied, easy to drink beer. Nothing special, but also not a bad beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is malty, roasted, toasted, a bit nutty, a light tang, and a moderate bitterness on the finish. A very drinkable Oktoberfest offering."
""
"Smooth clean mouthfeel, that begs to be gulped. Spot-on carbonation gives the beer enough girth to satisfy me. Sweet caramel and toffee flavors, light fruity back end. Bready finish. Alcohol adds just enough zip to bolster this beer. A total malt-heads dream. Really a good beer. I expected to find some major flaws in this, but I couldn't really find any. A well-made beer, perfect for the cooler months ahead."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel of this beer is right on where I expect it to be not too thin that the beer just washes away too quick but not so thick that it makes it difficult to drink."
""
""
"O - A good, easy drinking Oktoberfest beer. The flavor definitely has a distinct Yuengling taste and is eerily similar to their Traditional Lager. The big difference is the prominent roasted nutty malt flavors. Very enjoyable."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, pilsner, Munich, and crystal malt scent; sweet and malty with a touch of bread-like character. The taste is average. It has a faint malt character with a thin, dry finish. It goes down quick and easy with little complexity. The mouthfeel is average as well. It's a light and easy drinking beer with good carbonation. It has little mouthfeel and seems too thin and lacking for the style. This is a non-offensive seasonal that's easy drinking, but nothing to boast about."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark red with a small white head that dissipates quickly and does not leave much lacing. Very malty aroma is present, dark roast dominating, nothing really stands out. Tastes of caramel and dark roasted malt, but not really strong, and more mass produced. Beer is carbonated correctly and goes down pretty smooth. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
"Mineral with a touch of sulfur lager yeast throughout with some grainy sweetness and a bit of caramel bread. Slight hints of citric hop bitterness. hHowever a little too light and lack luster for the style, carbonated like a light lager, a little overdone , but drinkable and a nice new offering from yeunling."
"Overall, I'm glad to see Yuengling have a new offering. This is quite the change of pace from their regular offerings. I would gladly try this every year around the fall season."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good drinking ofest. As for the price, ya I'd buy again."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is also very malty, some sweetness, a touch of hops, refreshing and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"Another simple, uncomplicated, easy to appreciate beer from Yuengling. Can't imagine choosing this over a German version of this beer, but I thought it enjoyable and eminently drinkable. Not sure I'd ever order it again, but I enjoyed the glass I ordered at keglers."
""
"Drinkability - all in all, an easy beer to knock back if you don't set your sights too high. A decent beer to get some crossover action from the BMC crowd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This is not a particularly enjoyable Marzen. In terms of flavor, it's solid, but I wasn't a fan of the mouthfeel or lack of complexity. This also shows some unusually prominent yeast character that seems out of place."
"This is one weird Marzen, where is the malt and bakery like presence?? really not interesed in having this again at all."
""
""
""
""
"O - while I do appreciate yuengling beers, I can't say they are my go to or even something I even think about other than that rare occasion of not having time to go to my craft honey hole. This just isn't a marzen. You could make the excuse it's a good cheap brew, but the fact is I can buy a GLBC Oktoberfest 6 pack for .75 cents more. Or 2 bombers of brauerei aying marzen for exactly the same. I respect folks buying their weekend sixer of yuengling rather than buying any AB/ Bud/ Bud light, but the truth is.. There are too many damn good beer makers personally known myself for me to call this my favorite brewer. While my appreciation is there, my Wallot will not always be. This experience actually made me appreciate what Great Lakes sends down my way and trust me, Ive bought enough GLBC o-fest to take care of my marzen fix for fall 2012. Craft guys who try this will know what I mean and understand my standards of ales and lagers. Others who switched from bud to yuengling probably won't but hey those people won't be reading and writing reviews on brews anyway. This is worth a try for most though."
""
"It's not bad, but when I'm in the mood for a festbier, this one isn't going to do it. No sign of an ABV or bottling date to be found."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a below average octoberfest."
"o: Not bad and a good value."
""
""
"O – This misses the mark as an Oktoberfest and simply tastes like Yuengling Traditional Lager with a little bit more caramel malt. Instead of the rich, full-bodied malt aroma and taste that comes with good Oktoberfest beer, this is rather thin all the way through with a mostly grainy aroma and taste. Honestly, I’d rather go for regular Yuengling, but this isn't a bad beer."
""
""
""
"This isn't a great example of the style, but it is cheap and highly drinkable. There aren't really any off flavors, but it just doesn't live up to the style traditionally."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer flat misses the mark. This is a brief review from me, but there isn't much that I can say here. It doesn't come across like a Marzen. This is difficult to drink."
""
""
""
"Poured a good dark orange with a wonderful head. Aroma was a little plain if almost non-existent but the look was impressively beautiful. A fan of spicier Oktoberfests, I wasn't entirely thrilled with the taste, although it did absolutely nothing wrong. It was better than the average Oktoberfest, but not by a whole lot. The mouthfeel was terrific though as it flowed smoothly down, no weird aftertaste and just the right amount of carbonation. A good representation of the Marzen style and hopefully they continue next year as this was a decent entry. Plus, who doesn't love a family operated brewery like Yuengling?"
""
"Overall, served cold this beer is great, you can pick out the adjuncts as it warms some but I think this is better than lager."
""
""
""
""
"Single finger head with little retention and some lacing on a clear amber with golden hues body. Aroma is very simple and mostly malty with little spice or hop character to make you think of a good marzen. Flavor is a touch sour. The caramel malts do not add much sweetness. The hops are mild and there are no spices add here to make this a good one for the genre. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Tastes like old amber Yuengling."
"While their new Bock entry was for me a disappointment, this Oktoberfest is one that is remarkably simple and straightforward in what is sets out to be, and not too shabby tasting, either."
"This beer is a complete turd. It's a Yuengling lager with a bit more malt. Period. If they used Nobel hops you would never know. This beer is a serious let down. A cheap way to market different beer. A loser to stay clear of. No, on second thought, try it and have a laugh. Terrible effort."
"O - a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not too bad actually. Definitely a bit more flavorful than the original lager. More malts and hops. Not top-notch within the style, but drinkable for sure."
"Overall - Pretty decent beer here. It's not outstanding, but it's a simple, solid brew."
"Not the best Maerzen style i have had but its a nice and tasty brew and at a price of around $7 a six pack one cannot go wrong with it. For me it exceeded my expectations and i think is well worth a good drink."
"The old standby beer produces another affordable, easy drinking but not spectacular beer. I would definitely pick this up again."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber/orange color with about an inch off-white head that stays around a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like caramel and toasted malt, along with a little bit of toffee. It tastes like toasted and caramel malt, and also some earthy/grassy hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink! I think it's a solid Oktoberfest brew, and it's priced right at $6.99 a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is surprisingly good. Not the best marzen but better than I assumed from a brewery that hasn't branched out into seasonals before. It goes down really easily and has an interesting taste. I think I would have this again and I hop Yuengling considers other seasonals moving forward."
""
"Very well done for a Pennsylvania, larger brewery. $7 for a six-pack? Sold."
""
"Poured from bottle clear amber color small off white head. Smell has some toasted malt, caramel. Taste toasted, roasted malts at first feels a bit thin, and has a sweet cereal like finish. Overall an easy to drink Oktoberfest I could have a few big steins of this season."
""
""
"My first O-fest beer of the year.Poured one and a half bottles into a half liter stein,a clear lighter bronze shade with a large fluffy slightly off white crown atop.Aromas are light and clean with a hint of caramel and toasted grain.A little watery feel to it,flavors mainly of caramel and a touch of grain.It's very average and not complex but I didn't expect it to be mind blowing.Hopefully the worst Oktoberfest beer of the year for me."
""
"Overall – Living in Pennsylvania now and having greater access to Yuengling’s many brews, I really have come to appreciate what they offer. It is a good product at a great price. Like their year round beers their Octoberfest is no different. While not the best per say, for its price to quality ratio, it is one of the best. It has good flavor as well as a nice color and smell. I say it’s a job well done by Yuengling."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable Oktoberfest style beer from America's oldest brewery. This tastes like a fuller, maltier, cleaner version of Yuengling's standard trademark lager beer. I look forward to drinking this around the late summer and fall months for years to come. Certainly one of, if not the finest Yuengling brew."

"This poured out as a copperish looking brown color. The head was Kind of soapy looking and cream colored. The lacing and retention was minimal. The smell of the beer has some malty aromas with a touch of spice and a lager yeast in there as well. The taste of the beer is average to, seems like just a slightly different flavor than their Traditional Lager. The mouthfeel was smooth with a good carbonation and a solid dry finish to it. Overall I wasn't too impressed, it was fun to try and I was happy I did but I wouldn't have to go after this one like I do with Samuel Adams each year."
"Decent stab by Yuengling. I'll be fine and dandy finishing out the six-pack."
"This is another winner for America's Oldest Brewery! No brewery is more American than Yeungling!!"

"Autumn amber in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, frothy, off-white foam that slowly reduced to a foam ring at the top of the glass. Sweet toasted malt, nutty, and earthy grass aromas. Smooth, delicate feel with rich, pleasant carbonation. Sweet toasted malt flavors up front into the middle. A sharp, bitter hop character from middle to end. Bitter flavor tapers quickly allowing the sweet maltiness to shine through again at the finish. Finishes with a sour biscuit flavor on the tip of the tongue and a lingering bitterness in the back of the mouth. This was a better than expected offering from Yuengling."

"Good Oktoberfest. What I love about Yuengling is that they really put there own spin on their beers. You can tell it is a Yuengling beer."

"The aftertaste - burnt and slightly metallic - is not so bad to kill this, but it's just a maltier Yuengling lager to me. It's just about average. Better (and worse) O-fests out there. Not bad, not great. Yuengling fans might not have as much of a problem with it than me."
"This is a very drinkable brew, but it just seems to be lacking any real punch. An easy drinking brew though. It is good to see Yuengling trying some other styles, but it could use a bit more."

"Ruddy copper beer with a thick, foamy head that leaves lots of lacing. Has a leafy, bready aroma with notes of caramel. Flavors of tea leaves and light butterscotch with a yeasty aftertaste. Body seems a little thin but this is a great example of Oktoberfest beer."
""

"O- this is a very drinkable brew, not quite as good as other American Octoberfests but not bad at all. Would go great with a good hearty meal."

"always like to try new things from one of the nations oldest brewery. couldn't find it last year on tap , glad its in bottles this year. nice copper color and aroma that has a good hop presents. glad to see the fine people at yuenling trying something different would love to see if they did a cream ale in the near future."

"Poured a very nice deep burnished orange, although with very little head and no lacing. Decent sweet malt aroma with a slight leafy-caramel tone. Decent flavor, very sweet lagerish malt; very clean and crisp; decent fall flavor but nothing deep. Goes down very very smoothly. On tap at McClafferty's Irish Pub."

"Beer had a great copper color and sweet smell. The taste and quality was not only comparable to a lot of more expensive Oktoberfests I've had (I got this for $1.50 a pint, not on special!), but I think it was even better. I had a Sam Adam's Oktoberfest on tap that same night, and I think the Yuengling Oktoberfest put the S.A. to shame. Maybe I was just biased because it was a Yuengling beer, but either way, its an excellent Oktoberfest!"
"O- Not a horrible beer overall, as it is very drinkable and cheap at a bar; but not a great representation of style."
"O- Easily approachable and easy drinking. Not the most exciting beer out there but I could enjoy drinking this all night."
"I drank a lot of this stuff, and I think it is quite a good beer for how cheap it is. I wish it would replace the traditional lager, but something tells me that is a pipe dream. Yuengling Oktoberfest is a decent beer, with all of the right flavors, but it still kind of tastes like watered down Fest bier."
"Overall: The caramel taste here, it's... it's just odd, and, maybe it's just me, but it seemed to have a falseness to it, like the added flavoring to that Saranac Caramel Porter. It's not an abhorrent beer, but it sure doesn't stack up against the better examples of the style (or even the not-so-better ones)."
"Taste similar to the lager but better. Has some caramel and bread notes of the style, with a nice bitter hop flavor - bitter herb. This is a very good beer for yuengling, but closer to average in the style."
"Pours a clear dark amber with minimal head. Slightly sweet and toasted malt aromas carry over to the palate in a restrained and well balanced way, with a little of the metallic bitterness that resembles some of the flavors in regular Yuengling Lager. Moderate carbonation and medium body make this go down easy. Very solid."
"O: Easy drinker, nice seasonal beer."
"I had this on tap while visiting family in Pottsville. The pour is light orange, decent head. The aroma is faint, sweet. I quite honestly thought this was their lager for my first pint. The flavor is sweet, not real complex, grainy. The body is medium/light, good carbonation. An easy drinking beer, it went well with my appetizer, but it drinks like a sweeter and heavier version of their lager."
"O-this is more drinkable than water, basically one of the purposes of the style. i actually love this. i really want to find a case of this. it doesn't fit the style guidelines to a T, but its a loose interpretation, and a good one. flavors are pretty decent."
"M: Easily drinkable, the complexity is a little lacking though. The Yuengling house flavor runs through the beer, a welcome addition but keep your expectations in check."
"Aside from opening with an unplease toasty corn note, this was a fine, smooth amber lager. It reminded me a bit of Beck's Oktoberfest in that it only kind of resembles the style. It's not a bad beer, but I'd never stack it up against a Paulaner O-fest. I'd say it's worth a try, especially if you find yourself in a VFW."
"Overall an average beer. Not unpleasant, but nothing to single it out either. Doubt I would order it again. Roma's does have Guinness on tap, and the food is very good, some of the best in town"
"O - I mentioned this before and maybe I shouldn't be comparing, BUT this (to me) was just a sweeter version of their Lager...now don't get me wrong, when I don't have anything else to drink I go for a Lager and I think this was a good attempt...especially for Yuengling to try something different"
"this was the ""secret beer"" at Cooper's in Scranton, PA. excitedly ordered it after finding it on their Facebook page. I find Marzens to be average beers. Nothing ever blows me away. This was the first I've ever had that actually had some distintive taste to it. It was a beautiful orange/brown color, drank smooth and tasted fantastic. A bit heavy on the tongue, but all in all probably the best Marzen I've ever had. Who knew Yuengling could wow me with a new beer?"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Very crisp and easy drinking, the alcohol is very well hidden. This was an interesting take on the style and worth a try but not something I would go out of my way for to have again."
"It's probably one of the most sessionable Oktoberfest beers I've tasted, albeit not the most flavorful. Everything is here though that you'd expect for the style but it's not overdone, if anything understated. Easy drinking, crisp, clean and quite refreshing. A solid first attempt at the style. Then again, I think they do lagers quite well."
"Got this beer on tap at the draught horse on temple campus. I had no idea yuengling had come out with an octoberfest so I decided to try it. Definitely a good choice. It pours a golden orange color with almost no head. Aroma is mildly caramel with a bit of a biscuit quality. This is probably the more enjoyable octoberfest I have had (although I haven't had a ton if different ones). Light refreshing mouthfeel might be a little bit light for the style, but is perfect right now. After a morning commute that was 2 hours instead of 20 minutes and a slow tedious work day this is one great beer. Couldn't ask for anything else right now."
"Taste is a coarse husky, bisquity graininess. Not much of a hop presence. Overall medium bodied and pretty drinkable for an Oktoberfest. Not one of the best Oktoberfest Biers, but one that you can get pretty much anywhere."
"overall, very good session Oktoberfest"
"This a real smooth drinkable beer im going to be drinking this every chance i get while its available and would buy it in cases if they made it."
