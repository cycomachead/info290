"A refreshing and very solid beer in the style. Very lacking in carbonation though."
""
"Smells truly wonderful! Toasty. Buttery. Caramel. Taste is quite different from most Oktoberfest styles I've tried as it's rich with warm, roasty, caramel flavor yet very light and bubbly on the palate. Extremely welcoming and drinkable."
"I'm a little underwhelmed considering I really like the other beers I've had from this brewery. It's not bad, but nothing about really makes me want to have another one."

""
"Copper Legend is a beer made to high standards - I've come to expect as much from Jack's Abby. But does it live up to the highest standards of them all: German standards!? Absolutely. If your Märzen can be mentioned in the same breath as any of the original, iconic producers' then you've clearly done a good job. And it's not easy to emulate centuries of craftsmanship and tradition!"

"O: [2.50] This would be a nice beer to have at a German festival.  It would make me feel like I fit in.  Other than that I am not sure when I would seek this out.  The flavors are decent but it is not really my thing.  It is too bad because I have had mostly solid hits from Jack's Abby."
""
"Most Jack's Abbey brews jump out at you. This is a mild Octoberfest with an amber to good tone. The head disappears quickly but the carbonation sticks until the bottom."

"Pours into a pokal a..well a copper color with a minimal head,I like a big white crown on my O-fest lager and this didn't have much of one at all.Some caramel and bread dough in the nose with a lighted note.a somewhat mellow flat feel to the beer wich again is off for the style.Flavors of caramel,bread dough,and a light smattering of herbal hops in the finish,not bad but the feel doesn't help the flavors.Maybe an off bottle as far as carbonation goes,would like to try fresh from the tap."
"I could see myself buying this again."

"Overall:  Pretty nice Octoberfest.   Would have preferred more sweetness,  but I'm content with it."

"Price point - $2/12 oz single"

"Overall not my favorite marzen nor my favorite JA beer. Try if you lie the style but don't od too much to seek it out."

"Reminiscent of Firestone Walker's Oaktoberfest. It has the bones of a marzen, but aspires to a better form resulting from nuance. Very bright gold, not sure I'd qualify it as copper. Nice head though. Importantly, the basics have been attended to. Malted Munich dominates a sweet aroma; no nuttiness, no pine, just malt.  Crisp and soft body. Emphasis on the aged and thrashed flavor of wheat. Smells much much sweeter than actual taste, which is given balance by some Noble hops, herbal, and medicinal flavors."

"O: I love this brew! An instant classic. Maybe the best Oktoberfest offering I've yet had! One to try if you're a fan of the style or if you're a skeptic of the style."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is bright, vivid and reminds me of how the fall leaves give off their last bit of light as color before they turn brown and fall.  Delicate swift on the palate and has a measure of sunshine in the drink imparted by the wheat."

"O: mellow; easy drinking; a little sweet for my taste;"
""
""
""
"I first started drinking the super-hopped Jack's Abbey Mass Rising and Hoponius Union and figured they were another brewer catering to the public demand for super hopped ipa's and ipl's. I have certainly been corrected...JA puts out a wide variety of lager style brews including this fine offering, Cooper Legend....A road trip to Framingham is on the to-do list..."
""
"A really, really good American Marzen. It tastes more in debt to Millstream's O-fest than to any traditional Munich ones.  And while it's not as good as its Iowa counterpart, it's still probably the second best American marzen I've ever had."

"M - Medium carb.  Light body and easy drinking"

"O - A great Oktoberfest, certainly amount my favorites of the style, if not my top one. Great looking beer, all the mild flavor of an Oktoberfest, with incredible drinkability. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall; another good product from Jack's Abby that sticks true to the Oktoberfest style. Would definitely drink again."
"Jack's Abby has got it going on. Fresh and flavorful octoberfest here."
""
""
"o: Really liking what I've tried from these guys, good Festbier for sure."
""
""

"O: A decent American Octoberfest with a definite focus on malts. Not really all that complex, but it's very drinkable. Would be a good option at a festival"
""
""
"Taste is surprisingly smooth and slick, the body is excellent with a nice creamy feel it to, carbonation is near perfect, taste is mostly malt but does has a decent hop balance in the aftertaste which helps to smooth it out, neither flavor is overwhelming but just the right amount, very easy drinking with a semi-dry finish that keeps you refreshed and coming back for more."
""
""
"Ha on tap at the Corner Bar in Back Bay. Typical seasonal beer - Oktoberfest is everywhere it seems. Pours a great copper color with a decent head. Very malty and breast type of smell and the taste carrys over. Not hoppy at all. Pretty carbonated beer and tasted artificial to me- I wasn't overwhelmed with this one. I like this brewery a lot, but this one was just ok for me."
""

""

""

""

"Very drinkable, tasty to-style beer."
"Overall - I am not a huge fan of this style in general, but I appreciated what they did here, particularly with the hoppy finish. I am willing to admit that I am a huge fan of this brewery and will try anything they put out at least once. Would recommend this for fans of hops that want a seasonal treat, would also recommend for those into the style, though they might be put off by the interpretation of it."
""

"Overall easy drinker, true to style and won't disappoint"
"Not surprised that Jack's Abby nailed this style. One of the best American made versions."

"Good malt character with a nice complimentary Noble hop finish as well as lager yeast. Good buttery, toasted caramel malt feel."
""
""
"O - The first American Marzen I've had this year that gives me hope. Still not as good as the Germans make them, but not far off, and it tastes quite authentic."
""
"Overall pretty good. Not my favorite style but a standout marzen. Would get again if in the mood"
""
""
"Pours a deep copper color with a huge white head that quickly dissipates to a cap. Smells of rich caramelized malts with lots of bready pilsner and subtle spicy floral hops for hints of balance. The flavor is rich sweet and malty with lots of melanoidin and hint of prunes and plum with a light earthy spicy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice Marzen! Not overly hoppy like some American versions, but rich and malty like better German versions. I enjoyed the hell out of this beer."

"The beer pours a fiery caramel color, moving between amber and red tones. It pours with a lovely head of medium sized, lightly yellowed, slightly rocky bubbles that sit at a half finger’s width and slowly fizzle away. The head leaves a negligible lacing on the sides of the glass. In body the beer is lager-clean but darker, with a lazy stream of bubbles working to the top of the beer, and no particles present (just as there shouldn’t be in this style). On the nose, the beer smells spicy with a beautiful caramel malt blanket on the back of the smell. The caramel is layered and sweet, gracing the nose with just a touch of maple syrup and biscuit notes, and the hops are properly noble with a strong spice character, alongside fresh cut grass notes. The malt is the bigger player in the nose, however. On the tongue, the beer tastes mellow, with light bitters and sweetness which give way to a nice dry finish and only the slightest hint of acidity. In flavor, the beer tastes remarkably similar to several ESB’s I’ve had. The flavor begins as sweet caramel malt with a touch of apple juice, this moves into sweet bread, and then quickly to stale bread, and then bitter, herbal hops with just a touch of residual sweetness from the malt. Toffee notes also dance across the middle of the palate. The finish is dry, but is a nice blend of the malt and hops. In the mouth the beer feels medium in body, with a light, syrupy mouthfeel and softer carbonation that gives a quick bite and then caresses the tongue with velvet. The mouth is left dry except for a very faint trail of saliva, though it is by no means bone-dry. Overall this is a great beer to drink a lot of, it’s not too sweet, it’s not too bitter, and sits on the palate nicely with enough flavor to make you want another sip, but not enough to fill you up, etc… This is a good drinking beer, and would work very well in an Oktoberfest environment."

"Nicely rounded, pleasant representative of the style, but a bit short on malt and spice, compared to the original. Tastes clean, fresh and dry--and, given the blend of ingredients, likely to hold up under moderate aging. Stunning color, even for beers that are normally copper/orange/dark amber, immediately evoking the season (despite the fact that's it's still virtually middle of summer). Pleasant, sessionable beer that may win over more than a few cross-over drinkers, although the price is clearly a deterrent (the 4-pack costs nearly as much as a Samuel Adams 12-pack). Would drink more of it, budget permitting--and share with as many people as I can. Not as heavy or as flavorful as some other Marzen, but will do nicely for any Oktoberfest gathering."
"o: Though perhaps lighter than some Octoberfests, a good one to have while the weather is still warm. Refreshing and quite tasty, really hard to tell this is close to a year old."
"Pouring it into the mug, it appears as an earthy orange with a humongous frothy head, light cream in color. Huge maltiness on the nose – pie crust and barley soup. Taste is reminiscent of burnt crackers, bread crust and porridge. This is a terrific showcase of the malts used. It’s rich, earthy and tastes of iron. The mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp. Jack’s Abby knows lagers. The depth is not huge, but the flavors that are there are wonderfully tied together and makes for a great Oktoberfest beer."

"A good , drinkable beer. I could have more than one. Very enjoyable but not best in class, but worthy of repeating."
""

"Overall: This is a quite unremarkable beer. Nothing particularly interesting going on here. I don't need anymore."
""
""
"This was an OK beer in my book. Easy drinker, nothing super special. Poured a deep gold/coppery color, nice head that lingered. Somewhat thick mouthfeel, maybe a touch of honey sweetness. A little hoppy and a little malty. Nothing extraordinary, but a very solid lager."
""
"Thanks to cbeer88 for sending this one to me. Appearance is a deep clear orange with a razor thin layer white head. The aroma is malt forward with some significant sweetness present, notes of grapes, grains, and that festive autumn earthiness that is common for the style. The taste delivers every bit of the sweetness that the nose promised with notes of fruit and maple. This is countered by earthy grains and dry lager yeast. The mouthfeel is smooth with mellow carbonation. Overall, this leans a bit far on the sweet side of things, still enjoyable though."
""
"Overall, this is a good beer, and certainly far better than standard Anheuser-Busch fare. But it does lack a certain amount of punch, and the sugars are low enough that they become easily lost under the grains – especially in subsequent sips. A better sampling of orange, berry, and apricot notes would have served this brew better, and helped to balance the affair."
""
"O: Straightforward and easy to drink. Another solid beer from a solid brewery. Thanks again SneezyAchew."
""
"O - awesome local marzen. Super stoked to have access to this for years tocome. Cheers!"
"D - Not totally what I was expecting from an Oktoberfest, but a pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed the sweeter flavors in this one, although I could have stood for a little bit crisper feel. No problem drinking a half-liter on my own though."
""
""
"Pretty decent, but a little simple and sweet for my tastes, reminds me of alot of other American oktoberfests, great malty mouthfeel is a highlight."
""
"Despite the words above I did enjoy drinking this beer. There were just little things in almost every aspect that made it average instead of good."
""
""
"Overall:A solid mineraly tasting lager. Good for the style, and if I want a marzen I would look for it. However, I will probably not rush to pick this one up again."
"Taste starts worty and moderately sweet, fruity in the middle, and light bitterness through the close. Body seems lacking. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is way easy. Not bad, but doesn't quite come together for me as well as some of my Okt faves."
""
""
""
"While I certainly appreciate the balance of this beer over it's often overly sweet or semi-metallic brethren, the body leaves something to be desired."
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Very well put together, if this was a bit cleaner it would give its German counterparts a run for their O-fest. I'll be visiting this lager more often than other O-fests this year."
"Notes: Begining to end it's so very drinkable. Cheers."
"O: I'm very picky when it comes to Octoberfest lagers, especially American-made ones. Many brewers just use them as a token seasonal offering and don't even bother to stay true to style. They just brew some crappy, half-baked amber beer, often using an ale yeast to keep things more economical. The result is a market flooded with a whole lot of half-assed ""Octoberfest"" beers lacking character and substance. I'm happy to report that this is not one of those beers. Jack's Abby brews lagers exclusively, and boy did they nail this one. Copper Legend has to be the most authentic tasting American-made Octoberfest lager I've ever had. Ridiculously good, and highly quaffable. Give me some radishes and bratwurst and I'm in heaven. Jack's Abby. So hot right now."
""
""
"O: I don't understand the less than favorable reviews this beer is receiving. Maybe there was a bad batch, maybe these people don't understand the style, or maybe there aren't enough hops? This style is meant to be malt-heavy. I was hesitant to buy this because of the reviews but this again proves that you must take reviews with a grain of salt. I expected Jack's Abby to get this style right, of all styles, because after all, German beers are their focus. And they did get it right. This is a great beer. And for the style (remember, that's how beers are supposed to be reviewed on this site), this gets high marks."

"500ml bottle served in a nonic. Fall 2012 indicated on the back label. Pours a bright, orangish-copper with a slightly hazy clarity and a dense, one inch, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim; some spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued - light malts and perhaps a trace of diacetyl. Taste follows nose - definitely has festbier qualities in the flavor profile, but nothing really dominates. Some toasted notes, a hint of caramel sweetness a little skunk and a fairly clean finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant and consistent carbonation Overall, quite drinkable. The style in general tends to become a little too cloying for me; however, this beer has a very pleasant character to it."
""

"i disagree with my peers on this one. jack's abby nailed a classic german lager style AGAIN. incredibly easy to drink, not too filling and tons of malty flavor. isnt that what oktoberfest beers are all about?"
"Mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied to light. It's crisp and has a nice dry finish. Good carbonation level and insanely drinkable. The bottle goes before you realize it. Probably one of the better American takes on this style. Jack's Abby did a good job again here."
"O: Like most/all Oktoberfests, it's a pretty simple brew. Don't let the scores dissuade you, this is probably the best of the style I've ever had. Super smooth and drinkable. Nice balance but at the end of the day it's pretty simple. Doesn't make it a bad beer by any means, I enjoyed it. Great sessionable beer for the season. Jack's Abby doesn't know how to disappoint."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a while."
"O - Overall, this was a disappointment for me. Really had assumed Jack's Abby would make a flawless Oktoberfest, far from it."
""
""
""
"I like Jack's abby beers and thought this would be better than other octoberfests I've had but was a little disappointed. Don't take this as a downer. This beer is good, just not what I was hoping for. A little more taste would have rated this higher."
""
"O/D-A top-tier, up and coming brewery that happens to be one of my favs does a Marzen (one of my least favorite styles). This was perhaps the best Marzen I have had but it's still a Marzen to me. JA's worst brew so far, but still a great depiction of a mediocre style."
"O- This was a pretty decent oktoberfest, nothing special- which is what I've come to expect from Jack's Abby. I enjoyed drinking it, but it wasn't something that I would drink all the time. Not too much complexity or a ton of flavor. Definitely easy to drink and far from terrible, but far from the best of Jack's Abby lagers."
"Update: It's definitely better a little closer to room temperature."
"Overall, nice beer, but not what its supposed to be. Very easy to drink, good balance, but lacks the richness of the German (and most domestic) octoberfest brews."
"Overall eh, a bit too much cracker bready malts and toastiness, no decoction layered softness I would have wanted, a bit too bitter and earthy, but nothing really wrong, just not what I like in my German Oktoberfest beers, and not what I've come to expect of the top notch lagers from Jack's Abby."
""
"O: not a bad brew, but not exactly anything that knocked my socks off here, maybe it's just my personal tastes, as this beer is nicley rounded and very drinkable. Guess its just not my thing."
""
"My least favorite offering from this new brewery so far, unfortunately. As a long time fan of Marzens & ofests, I cant help but feel this beer was rushed. Will try another time."
""
""
"D-Okay style wise. A bit run of the mill. Not bad, but just not anything to scream about."
