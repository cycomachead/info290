"Overall (3.29) : This is a nice beer for a one-off or to share with friends to tell them you care. A great storytelling around the fire pit beer and a nice crisp refresher on a crisp night (I imagine - nights are still hot here). Not a whole lot wrong to say about this beer, other than it finishes a little more piney-bitter than I'd like. It's definitely captured the essence of harvest and brings in that seasonal flavor! Would I buy it again? For a special event. I'm convinced there are some smoother pumpkin beers out there, so I'm still looking for ""that one"". Don't think I'd personally grab a sixer unless I was having company."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours orange red with a small white head. Smells of nice darker roasted malts, typical for oktoberfest beers, a little weak, but nice. Tastes of caramel, little molasses, dark roasted grain, very slight fruit. Beer is sessionable, light bodied, nicely carbonated. Overall, a pretty good beer."

"Overall there was a lot to love, and some things that could have been better about this beer, all tastebuds are different, so I suggest giving this one a try."

"This is a very malt- forward, easy going Oktoberfest that most anyone will like. It is exceptionally clean, sweeter than most beers, and very likeable. The sweeter taste might be a little much for some, but it makes a good choice for those who don’t prefer an emphasis of hops. It isn’t over the top in any way, but is still more than pleasing and most party guests will find it to their liking."

"If you like a good MALTY Oktoberfest, you can't beat this one. There's enough hop bitterness, but malt definitely is doing the driving. I love this."
"Oktoberfest pours a goldenish color with a small lacing head. There is a sweet and malty aroma. The taste has a mellow crisp malty undertone, with strong sweet flavors. The body was very watery, overly sweet, and harder to drink. Overall a light and overly sweet oktoberfest, might make a good ""My First Oktoberfest," other then that not much to get out of this one."

"Overall not something I would have again their is better tasting examples out there with a higher ABV even."

"O) Bumping up the overall, because I felt the drinkability on this one was pretty darn good. Not a top notch O-Fest here, but better than average in my humble opinion. Glad to recommend."

"O- It's a decent octoberfest. If the fixed the body, it would be great."

"O: A decent Oktoberfest beer but pretty one-dimensional and needs a little bit less sweetness and more maltiness and breadiness."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are several others in the style that I would choose first."

"Reddish amber with good clarity, but poor head retention and lacing, light bodied and lightly carbonated, smells mostly of hay and grass with a side of corn malts as though it were trying to be an adjunct lager, but when it warms up some the bready toffee malt aroma appears out of nowhere...so don't serve this one too cold or you'll regret it I suppose. Taste follows the nose at whatever temp profile it happens to be at... tempered with a faint earthen hop finish. Mostly a good even malt profile marred by an out of control corn adjunct element. 20% less corn and this brew would have been in good balance for my tastes."
"O - A decent Oktoberfest, but not one of my favorites."
"O- a good o-fest at a great price,just a tad thin overall for me"
"O: The corn character really wasn't very pleasant."
"O=Hopefully, I'll grow to like these more, or be able to pawn them off on my brothers. A tad more enjoyable than the Leinenkugel's offering, but I recall the Point offering to have more flavor."
"O: A nice oktoberfest--so bready with just a touch of sweetness; cool and crisp, just like this September evening"
"Overall: A pretty good lager. Could of been a little bolder with the overall flavor and spice for a Marzen. Pretty well balanced."
"This was a bit of a disappointment, as Schell's usually produces an above-average product. Out of all the local Oktoberfests that I've tried this year, I'd say this is my least favorite. I don't think I'd sample this again."
"My first thought is this beer is not in balance. The hops and malts are out of sync. the sweetness is a little off. Maybe the way they interpret the marzen style is just not my thing but I think this octoberfest is a step below my favorite domestic octoberfest which is Summit. My main gripe was an aftertaste that was not pleasant."
"Drinkability: Good and smooth with a lower ABV, very easy to drink and session with (as the Oktoberfest/Marzen style should be). A good example of the style."
"O:this is a great oktoberfest to start the year off with the best beer season of all. this beer is a fun beer to make beer bread with it gives it that must have more taste"
"Overall: Not a great oktoberfest. Drinkable, but there are better examples."
"Poured a nice and very clear ruby tinted brown with a good two finger hight head of off white, tannish colored lace. Smell was good, lots of bready ,malts with a kicker of bittering hops. Nothing spetacular but still a quality brew. Nice light feel and good carbonation stayed until the end. Overall this was not a bad beer at all. I have had better, but this was still very sessionable and something that I am sure wood not dissapoint. Defintly a tick above the average Oktoberfest, but nothing that was fall down awesome. Though the finish had a nice touh of sweetnes to it, some caramel and even a tocuh of roasted nuts that seemed to linger and push the flavor forward."
"As I said before, a little too sweet for an o-fest for me, but not a bad beer."
"D: Not one of my favorite Oktoberfests or on of my favorites from Schell's. I would drink again but wouldn't seek out."
"Medium body, sticky dryness, and slightly chewy. Easy drinking, although the flavor profile is essentially mediocre. Not bad at all, especially since I'm not really into the style."
"It is probably one worth skipping."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a crystal clear dark amber/orange. An inch and half beige head sits atop. No lace left behind. Basic tones of toasted malts, caramel, bread in the nose. The body was crisp, quasi-dry finish. Nice candied malts in the flavor. Full mouth of toffee goodness. Bitterness was low. I was getting just wisps of banana in the flavor as well. Different. Decent flavor, decent body, quite refreshing for the season. Good beer."
"Drinkability: Schell must have taken all their good batches to the Great American Beer Festival, because I have no clue how they pulled down a silver medal with this. Either that or my sixer is not the best. Thumbs down."
"It's a pity that I have to rate this one lower than I would like to. A very good beer, that's full of flavor without being over-the-top. However, the malty smoothness & balance of the style is missing. As an Oktoberfest, this is just average; as a beer, it's well above average. I will seek it out more."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, goes down smooth. Could have a few of these for sure. Not super interesting but pleasant to drink. Price isn't bad either."
"As I write this, Schell's Oktoberfest won a Silver medal at the GABF 2010 in the American amber lager category. Good for them!"
"oktoberfest is my favorite style and this one may happen to be my favorite american brewed oktoberfest that i've tried so far."
"D: a 6er in a night would be no problem..."
"August Schell beers never made me form a tear in my beer, they are usually well constructed go to everyday drinking beers perfect for New Ulm, MN. Celebrating their 150th Annivesary let's try this year's Oktoberfest style lager, pretty amazing 1860 to 2010. Pours a bright caramel amber hue with a large bright white head forms fine speckled lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma brings out some nice caramel and bready biscuit malt tones a bit of spicy hops but not much. Flavor brings on sweet caramel notes very bright sugary tones without enough hop balance, but it's a drinkable tasty offering just lacks the deliver or finesse of the great German style brewers out there. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied but sugars can become a bit cloying in number with this version of an Oktoberfest, something that should never become an issue with this style. Drinkability was still alright but not a by the case type of beer it was worth a try and I can appreciate it but give me a Paulaner, Hacker Pschorr or Penn version by the case."
"D: There is nothing overly complex with this beer, nothing outstanding, nothing terrible."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light copper-orange color with a thin, cream colored head. Not much to say about the nose other than sweet caramel malt, perhaps a bit of toasted breadiness. The flavor is about the same, with an initial sweetness that transitions to the bready-toasty notes and finishes with just a touch of bitterness for balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy carbonation - probably one of the better features of the beer. Overall a decently drinkable beer but nothing that stands out as memorable. Not a bad Oktoberfest but there are much better out there."
"Easy to quaff, yet I'm unsure if I would like to meet this beer again."
"M/D - One of my favorites from Schell, this Octoberfest isn't over powering. Noticeable sweetness, possibly Caramel notes. A very drinkable beer. Sits smooth for light/medium bodied brew, well balanced. I great brew to have in the cool weather."
"D - A great oktoberfest all around with very well put together components like the balancing hops to the rich, smooth maltiness. A fantastic way to bid farewell to the oktoberfests this season!"
"#3 of 6 from the sampler pack. Again, August Schell is proving to be a pretty decent brewery with some real beers."
"Awesome fall session beer right here. Just an easy drinking, satisfying beer for those cooler temps. Really enjoy this. I will have this one again in the future."
"There's a moderate to slightly heavy carbonation adding to a really crisp feel in a light to perhaps medium body."
"And while there's nothing bad about the beer, there's little that will make you want to come back for another."
"D- Very drinkable, nice ABV allows you to have a few, probably my one and only favorite offering from Schell's...very nice Marzen style beer, makes me feel like it's fall, getting cold out...find myself wanting that bolder balanced malty beer this time of year. This one delivers pretty well."
"Drinkability: Pretty nice overall, but not dry or ""biscuity"" enough to be a great Marzen. Still, highly drinkable as an everyday, lighter Marzen."
"Nicely drinkable, these go well with a cool autumn night."
"Drinkability is strong. August Schell puts out some tasty, malty beers and this one is of no exception."
"D - This is a really good Octoberfest. Yet another very good beer from a brewery that doesn't get enough credit for the quality brews it cranks out."
"D-Highly drinkable. Tastes fresh and delicious. This brew holds a sentimental place in my heart, as it's been a seasonal favorite of mine for years."
"D= A good but not great example of the style. Would pair well with food but on its own I didn't like it nearly as much as the Bell's and Brooklyn oktoberfest beers."
"D: This brew is very sessionable. It has the right amount of flavor intensity, and the body as well. It's very well balanced, and a great beer to have on an early fall evening."
"Pours a nice orange copper with a bit of head and bit of decent lacing. Great thick scent, hints of fall and pumpking with a nice malt hit. Very nice taste, a hearty fall beer; nice malt attributes, slight burnt pumpkin flavor with a little hint of spice. Goes down great. A wonderful Oktoberfest with hints of pumpkin ale."
"Light orange or copper color. Moderate prickle and light head. Classic malt octoberfest nose. . . by that I mean it smells like many others. Creamy attack with some sour notes to the flavor that linger through the finish and the aftertaste. There are some nut hints in the aftertaste as well. Slightly above average drinkability, but other than pretty standard. Completed from notes."
"Finishes very clean."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very thick and creamy. Had high carbonation and a medium body."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. It's a decent beer. It's pretty sessionable. My problem is it's a bit boring. Octoberfest isn't exactly the most interesting style, but I do enjoy it and I've had some that are quite good. To me, this one doesn't quite stack up."
"The taste is similar, being fairly full but light, interesting and constantly intriguing, with definite malty toasty grain and caramel, with a flowery, grainy finish and grainy, leafy aftertaste. It is smooth and tasty, if a little on the mild, sweetish side, but with some hoppy bitterness to balance."
"D: I wish, along with many bocks, that they would be more of a seasonal beer. Very drinkable, very sessionable. Happy to see this in a 6 sampler, as Schell is tought to find in these parts."
"D= Very high. Give me a good fall day and I'll take many of these down. Great basic beer."
"Overall- a very drinkable and refreshing beer. There may not be a lot going on but it has some good subtle flavors. I would buy this again."
"This brew is very drinkable. Yet another good beer from Schell's that I've had the pleasure of trying."
"Overall, this is a pretty easy to drink beer. I think the taste would have been better during the fall."
"An okay offering - not my favorite beer of not my favorite style."
"The body is light. A bit dry for style. Overall really disappointed. IMHO this is more of an Amber Lager and lacks the malt structure for an Ofest."
"Copper orange color with a good sized beige head, small tight bubbles. Minimal lace and retention. The smell is of toasted malt, slightly sweet, some earthy hops. The flavor has more toasted malt and a balance of hops. It does have a good dose of sweet maltiness, as expected. Simple and straightforward, a decent marzen. Medium body with an acceptable mouthfeel. Good all around beer, no flaws or complaints."
"Pours a coppery amber with a three finger tall almond cap that slowly recedes leaving loads of sticky swiss cheese lacing. The nose is mostly lightly toasted malt and just a hint of caramel. Very metallic tasting right off the bat. This tastes a bit off,there is a date on the bottle that reads 020909,so I'm going to assume that it is fresh even though it does not taste like it is. Some caramel malt mid way could use more assertiveness as well as the lack of hops. This tastes like stale pretzels and sourness. I am just not impressed by this offering. The look was impressive,I would trade the appearance for solid flavor every time."
"Quaff is a barebone mixure of the above, a decent cut at the Okeys. A spicey finish adds to an overall fine drinking brew - fine for any fall weather. I was pleasantly surprised by this nice brew"
"The mouth is smooth with excellent mid-level carbonation. I had three with my dinner, it went great with my Cuban sandwich and fries."
"D - Heck Yes. Drink away man...or woman. You pick."
"A pretty good Oktoberfest, easy to drink a six."
"An ok Oktoberfest that has some nice caramel notes, but thin on the maltiness and light in the body. Aromas beging with a nice blend of bready-caramel character with firm hopping rates that I preferred. Flavors are quite nice with the same hops-malt balance. Some grain flavors show up late and cause a harshness in the mouthfeel and finish. Hop bitterness accentuates the grain character. More maltiness textures would also help."
"I could drink these all night, great beer."
"A nice light amber color. Aroma is fairly sweet. Honeyed, and floral for the most part. Body is the light side of medium, smooth and rounded. Minimal hops present. Predominantly the sweet malty taste of oktoberfest/amber beers. Honey, some almond, and nice malt flavors. Nothing exceptional but fairly solid. As far as Oktoberfests go the bar gets a lot lower than this. Really a tricky style to brew in my opinion and schell's has proved to me again that they are a competent brewery and don't get the respect the deserve given the popularity of some other region breweries (summit, leinenkugel)"
"Appearance is a clear, deep amber-orange with a lacy off-white head. Aroma has a wonderful flowery yet a bit spicy noble hop nose, some bread dough, and a nose-wrinkling whiff of sulfur. No matter, though, because the taste is absolutely delicious. Perfect bready-toasty malt balancing wonderfully with noble hop flavor and bitterness. What I love about this O-fest is that it's medium mouthfeel finishes very crisp and a bit dry which makes it extremely thirst quenching. It's so good I find myself pounding back a few wtih ease. This is my favorite O-fest of all time even over the German examples because of it's freshness. I would like to assume that this is how good the Germans drink their O-fest in Munich instead of the imported, stale versions we get sometimes."
"This beer pours a clear bronze color with amber hues. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into a large cap of foam. The aroma is of bready and toffee malt with mildly spicy nobles hops. The taste is full of malt with enough hops to make for a zesty finish. Overall, it is quite balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful Octoberfest. I will certainly drink this again."
"Fantastic, one of the best American Oktoberfests out there."
"An excellent Octoberfest beer. I was expecting a little more from the nation's second oldest brewery, with German roots to boot. While it is not the best fest beer I've had, it is definitely drinkable. I'd pick this up in a stein anytime."
"Overall not bad, good local fest beer. I dont know that I'd seek it out. But I would choose it over many others."
"Pours a dark orange/amber color with a two finger head that recedes slowly leaving behind slight lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel, a hint of honey, and slightly floral. Taste is the same. Big hits of caramel-like malt, some biscuit flavors, very light hops presence. Toasty, sweet, and full of that autumn brew flavor. Very nice OFest."
"D- Drinkability on this schells beauty is high. the mouthfeel and taste are excellent and could easily be drank all day at any fest."
"Delicious taste, just the right sweetness, goes down very smooth. When the weather starts to cool in the fall, you can't go wrong with this beer."
"Cask lager? You got it. The only other cask lager I have ever had was Schells keller bier. It was outstanding. Gravity fed out of a German cask called a Fass. Poured a dark amber colour with a dense white head. Aroma was mild and biscuity. The flavour leens toward the malt. This beer had a biscuit malt character with a touch of caramel flavour and a smooth balancing bitterness. Aroma and flavour hops were very subdued. Probably due to the fact that it was served from a cask. Although it is not a very hoppy beer otherwise. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Overall a great beer on cask, and as a matter of fact not on cask."
"It's a little late to be having a fest beer, but this still seemed to be a pretty good brew. A little on the sweet side, but that's fine with me."
"This is a good smokey bar beer. Nothing to smell so the cigarettes can't ruin that. Plenty of taste to make up for it."
"Not one of the better oktoberfest beers. Poured a light brown/amber color into a pint glass. Had a spongy head to it. smell didn't pop out and eiter did the taste...just a very average beer. Not terrible but just nothing I'd spend my money on again."
"Cheers."
"Carbonation? Nope, this thing is flat. Medium-bodied and a bit oily. Not too impressed here. Next year I think I'll pass on this one."
"August Schell Octoberfest pours out of the bottle with a beautiful orange color and a thick foamy head. There is the aroma of Caramel malt and Cascade hops. The taste is slightly sweet and smooth and is extremely drinkable. This is the kind of beer I could drink again and again."
"Large, creamy white head that quickly fades over a brilliant orange glow. Somewhat faint, tangy, maple sugar nose. Taste is sweet, burnt, candied apple with a dry, clovish note. Pendulum is swung pretty far towards the ""sweet"" end of balance. Mouthfeel somewhat thin, but not overly so. Quite drinkable, but with a sticky finish."
"Light to medium body,sightly grainy gives it a bit of roughness. Decent o-fest. On the plain side,nothing to get excited about."
"This beer is pretty drinkable. It is not a world-beater, but nothing to turn away. It also works well in beef soups and stews. This beer is 12-pack beer for me - good enough to buy a 12-pack each year, but not one that I hoard or stockpile. Give it a try."
"Nice smooth mouth feel to it makes it pretty drinkable, but overall i find this one about middle of the road. Not super but nothing to frown at."
"Overall I found this to be a very drinkable beer. I've never been much of a fan of this style, but this is one of the few that I will look forward to again next year."
"Schell Octoberfest was amber in color with an off-white head. The head was medium in size with good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was toasty malt with noble hops. The taste was also toasty malt and hops, with a little sweetness upfront and a dry finish. It was medium in body with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall it was a pretty good Oktoberfest."
"this brew is true to style. This is just the time of year to get some, so go for it!"
"A couple of years have passed and many Oktoberfests drunken and I have come back to this beer and discovered it is much better than my original scores. Still probably middle of the road example. Increased taste and mouthfeel by 1.0."
"D: Drinkability is ok, not the best in class, but probably not the worst."
"Drinkability: My first beer from a sampler pack of Schell. So far, so good. This is a nice beer and I an looking forward to the other five."
"Overall a very good and highly drinkable Oktoberfest. Very sessionable."
"overall this is a very enjoyable beer that i do believe that i will buy again"
"Average drinkability."
"Big thanks to Chad for bringing some Schell beers back from Minnesota for us!"
"Aroma was very mild, a light toasty malt smell, with a hint of citrus, perhaps more along the line of a weak honey. Tastes of a nice sweet malt, with a little caramel, very silky. A light dry aftertaste, but not bitter at all. Has a light finishing taste of metal it was hard to distinguish it after every sip though."
"the flavor is very malty, drier then my nose detected, good bitterness and hop flavor, hops are noble, some spiciness and drops off with a lingering herbal aftertaste."
"This really wasnt much of an Octoberfest beer. Nothing wrong, just that nothing stood out. Appearance was a bright amber color with thin off-white head that lingered shortly, and left okay lacing. Aroma and flavor were both muted, and the finish was okay, yet slightly stale. Okay beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Medium pour into an oversize nonic. Rocky pale tan head of medium-length duration with moderate lacing. Bright, tangy-malt on the nose with notes of caramel and pineapple. Slightly metallic, but this has always been a hallmark of August Schell  some of us like to put it down to the old copper brew kettle : ) Bright copper in color, and rather clear, but not fully brilliant. Biscuity malt from the outset, with small, round notes of pale malt and a slight metallic tang taking up the rear. Low bitterness. Moderately carbonated . . .this may speak to the somewhat thin feeling I get (see below). Malt profile lingers here, with some of the fruity-pineapple notes becoming apparent. Not a strong or big offering at all, but theres a pleasant hint of alcohol here. Definitely malt-driven, but in no way sweet let alone cloying, this is caramel malt with a fine gloss on a bright sunny day . . . very much a highlight to this beer. There are a couple of other regional brewers that brew an Oktoberfest that I really love, and each of these brews tends to have a fuller mouthfeel: here its crisp, light and refreshing but never feels heavy. A very good beer, with great drinkability and sessionable as well."
"This is a really good example of a traditional Oktoberfest or Marzen. The malt is king and is very tasty."
"This Octoberfest pours a very clear, deep copper into my glass with a thin white head that quickly diminished. I must say the color of this Oktoberfest is truly beautiful; something about it really strikes the eye. The aroma of the beer is high malty sweetness aroma with some toastiness also evident and even a little hop aroma. The beer has an initial rush of malty sweetness with a solid backbone of moderate bitterness; even a moderate-low hop flavor is evident. The beer has moderate carbonation and a medium body, leading to a rather smooth swallow and good drinkability. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. The color struck me first and I really appreciate the hop bitterness providing a solid balance to all the malt going on. In fact the hop bitterness is on the high end of the style (at least as perceived be me), something I see becoming a trend with me and how much I like any given Oktoberfest. I would recommend this beer, the only thing I could see is possibly a boost to the body."
"A little thin in the mouth, an average Octoberfest, maybe I'm spoiled from having Penn readily available. I'm happy to finish my sixpack but I won't really seek it out next year."
"Copper body with an off-white head that held for a few minutes and then transformed into a thin ring. Smell of malty sweetness and taste was the same with a bit of caramel and touch of apple (or is this my imagination?). Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable. A solid offering from August Schell that I will look forward to buying again next fall."
" The body was medium-light with a moderate carbonation. I found this offering from Schell to be both flavorful and drinkable. I will gladly drink the rest of the six pack and keep an eye out for this one again next year."
"This is one of the better oktoberfest beers I've had! But not enough to make me a fan of the type."
"Originally reviewed September 17, 2005. On tap at the Big Lake Brewfest. Light almond lemon fruity aroma. Caramel brown pour, ruby tinged. Caramely, with tangy fruit typical of a solid Oktoberfest. Finish was sweet. A little floral in there somewhere. Of all the Oktoberfests I had at the Brewfest, this was actually my favorite."
"D- Right between taste and mouthfeel"
"Some sweet caramel malts with a little bit of hops. Needed to warm up a bit before the flavor really came through. Fairly unremarkable beer though. I wish I could give it a higher taste score, but it really doesnt do anything beyond the minimum requirements to be an Oktoberfest. Not a bad beer, just very average for the style."
"Not the best Oktoberfest, but still drinkable."
"Pours a lovely copper orange, with a good finger of head, and spotty lacing falling down the glass. Aroma isn't very strong, but I pick up caramel malts, and the faintest trace of hops. Nice caramel malt front, sweet and medium bodied, with a bit of springy carbonation in the middle and slightly bittering near the end. After a while it mellowed out and sweetened to a kind of cider aftertaste. Quite a drinkable beer, something to drink often when the weather turns cold."
"Doverall, a good Octoberfest by one of our great local breweries. Could have several more and shall next Fall."
"I am sure I have made this beer sound very nasty, its actually not that bad. I could have a few."
"drinkability: quite drinkable"
"For the first time in my life I think I've found a place serving fresh Schells O-fest on tap...what a difference....this is a hell of a nice o-fest...more drinkable than Summit for sure..huge caramel flavor and a subtle caramel nose....Perfect weightiness...much better than bottles too...leans much sweeter than the bottles...I've been back to this place about 5 times now to make sure I am reading this right and I am...what a find this is...would be a great o-fest for buying a keg for a party...not so big it knocks most people on their ass but tasty and well done."
"Beautiful copper color, cream-colored head. Slightly tangy aroma. Toffee and malt flavors predominate. Slightly creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The hop flavor seems to wait till the toffee/malt recedes before it makes its appearance. A slight little fruity flavor surfaces at the last swallow. Quite good. A splendid session beer."
"Nice and carbonated, not a bad beer for this time of year, pretty drinkable, but unexciting."
"I got this one on tap and found is to be enjoyable a little mediocre but good non the less. It poured a tan hazy color with some small lacing. It was very malts and sweet in fact almost to malty however there were hints of some nice hoppy flavor. I would defiantly give this one another shot since I usually enjoy most beers from schells."
"Drinkability: Nothing wowed me here. Not bad though, definitely drinkable, highly sessionable. I just think there are far better octoberfests out there."
"Medium-copper with bronze edges. Thick, creamy, light-sand head. Smells of sweet, sugary fruits and toasted toffee malt, amidst a spicy, vegetal hop backing. Starts off with mildly sweet candied vegetables and a caramelly biscuit backbone. Spicy, bitter hops come in and take over into the finish. Finish stays bitter with a pronounced vegetal flavor. Medium-bodied, slightly over-carbonated, bubbly feel. Sticky finish. Not bad."
"Schell Octoberfest is passable, but not much more than that. It seems to be missing something, but I can't quite figure out what. This is one case where my local (Millstream Oktoberfest) is clearly the superior beer."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that dies off fast. The aroma is pretty skunky. Lager stank. Also some caramel malts in there, but there was way too much funk. Might have a spoiled bottle. The flavor was a bit thin and uninteresting. Some caramel malts and a grainy/straw flavor. Didn't like it much. Reminds me of dirt, not that I know what dirt tastes like, but still. I didn't care much for this one."
"This one pours a nice golden amber color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is caramel, deep caramel with a lager funk. The flavor is kind of dirty tasting, probably from a hop that I don't like. Ther caramel is subdued and the lager funk is huge. The feel is thinish. Drinkability is not really good. I don't really like this beer. The nasties stay with me after tasting the beer. Not a good one."
"A rather good Oktoberfest brew. Much better than Sam Adams or other brewers attempts at a seasonal brew for the fall months. Medium colour of copper and gold, a mix of the two. Flavors of straw, hops, barley, and a touch a sweetness. This is a recommended beer for those who are looking for something a bit heavier than most beers, but not to the extent of a Guinness or Dark Beer."
"Overall, quite a good O-fest. They aren't my favorite style, but this is the best I've tried so far. A ver"
"This brew has a clear copper colored body, big bubbly tan head as a result of my aggresive pour. The scent is a sweet, clean malt scent. Touch of flower hops. The taste is very sweet, very grainy, crisp and clean. Hints of flower hops give this beer the finishing touches. The way this brew is blended is very appealing to me, and this may be one of my favorite american style oktobers."
"Hazy deep orange-copper color, nice tan foamy head. Has a light bready, malty caramel aromas, sweet, nutty, caramel and butterscotch flavors, medium body, nice rounded and soft mouthfeel, finishes sweet. This one surprised me, a pretty good oktoberfest here."
"This was an impulse buy. Something new in the liquor store. It is a great session beer (sitting and drinking all day) hence my 4.5 on drinkability. The mouthfeel is light crisp and would be a great beer to drink on those hot Indian Summer days. The taste is only little above average, you can get this taste from many other lagers."
"Medium body, good caramel malt taste, very smooth, good carbonation...medium dry hop finish but not real bitter. Works great, perfect balance."
"It's a very light color for an Octoberfest. Sort of a light copper color. Nice thick head on top. Smells of a good amount of hops. Tastes a little muted. A little malt and sweetness, with a nice hops finish. Tastes slick and full on the way down. Another solid offering from Schell's."
"Its clear, deep copper body is capped by a short head of creamy off-white foam that dissipates into a wide collar and cottony surface covering but leaves only spotty lace. The nose exhibits rich, clean, grainy, toasty, and lightly sweet malt. The body is medium and it's crisp in the mouth before warming to become slightly creamy. All that the nose suggests is carried through in the flavor along with a subtle fruitiness and a firm bitterness that leads into a dry finish. Perfectly balanced with just the right amount of malt to give it a nice sweetness that never becomes cloying. Very well done. Quite enjoyable!"
"Sorry, guys, I'll be sticking to Summit's Oktoberfest."
"Thanks ZAP!"
"Aroma is great once it warms up some with a nice little toastyness playing over a subdued malty sweetness, some dried wood and ripened dull fruity notes. Taste is very subdued, lightly sweet and partially toasty malts with some very light factions of herbal hops, finishing crisp and clean with a small bite and lingering creamy sweetness that lightfully sticks around awhile. Feel is a bit on the lighter side, quite close to medium, smooth and moderately creamy, and very drinkable; a decent O'fest but could use more toastyness in the flavor dept in my book."
"Cheers to budgood for the sample!"
"Poured a cloudy orange/amber with a thick, foamy head. The taste of slight hops and sweet malts are present throughout, with somewhat of a cinammon feel left on the palate. This is a very drinkable beer, a great O-fest brew, drinkable on nearly any setting."
"pours out a clear, dark copper colour; a fine light and tight tan head appears and leaves bits of lace. the first aroma to hit the nose is the flowery, earthy hops...followed by a hints of toasted maltiness. a medium mouthfeel brings some more biscuity and toasted malts to the palate, followed by an above average hop prescence for an o-fest. the finish is pretty dry, and some light hoppiness lingers on the tongue in the aftertaste. this is a fine, tasty and easy drinking o-fest. a very solid beer for the fall season in the northland. worth seeking out."
"Oktoberfest or not, this is a good beer."
"Nice clear copper color.  Carbonation is evident from the  appearance of gas bubbles surfacing rapidly.  This beer has a very nice caramel malt presence on the nose. And some flowery hop tones.  The main player on the buds is grainy and toasty malt.  Some slight biscuit tones enter the picture fairly quickly also.  What really appeals to me in this O-fest is the hop character.  There's a nice little flowery, bitter, dry contribution from the hops that makes you want to get another sip quickly.  This is really a solid Oktoberfest.  One of Schell's better beers."
"Attractive -- clear reddish amber, nice darker yellow head of 1/2 inch.  Aroma of yeast and slight spice.  Malt is a little off, it warbles in first impression, first, full but flavorless, then, a little candy but quick to assume a watery and slightly vinegary quality.  Some hops at the finish.  This brew is hurt by the up front profile and could use a little more body."
"Due to circumstances which may have influenced last year's review, I've decided to review a fresh bottle from the 2002 batch.  Pleasant fresh malt aroma with slight roast quality.  Very clear, with nice amber color.  Medium but firm head.  Nice malt flavor right from the start through to the finish.  Good mild roast taste, with just a hint of caramel.  Middle and finish has some dryness with some astringent quality.  Medium mouthfeel and, of course, the Schell richness.  Closer to a sense of robustness that I like in a Marzen, yet can go down quickly and smoothly, if need be."
