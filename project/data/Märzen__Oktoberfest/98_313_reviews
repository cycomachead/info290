"really nice octoberfest. very smooth and not bitter"
""
"One of the better Octoberfest's I've ever tasted.  Great."
""
""
""
"Big fan of Harpoon Brewery. This Oktofest doesn't disappoint."
""
"Overall I though this was a fairly good beer. I thought that maybe they could tone down the metallic tastes a bit, and turn up the malty taste a bit. But still, I was happy with this beer."
"Comes out of the tap a dark clear mahogany with a thick pale wheat head. Aroma has strong tones of cloves and horehound. Malty flavor has notes of horehound, cloves and malt with an earthy undertone and a hint of caramel. Smooth texture has good body and fizz, if not amazing of either. A decent and enjoyable Oktoberfest. Prozit!"

"Awesome beer company and this is one of their best"

" Nothing too special and I can think of other Octoberfests that I like better. I generally like Harpoon but this one did not do it for me."

"Tries too hard to be 'balanced' for those who want hoppiness in their beer, but fails at being a legit Oktoberfest beer, IMO.  It is a fine beer, as in, the hoppy aftertaste well balances the malty forefront of the beer, but it's not what I would call a proper oktoberfest beer."

"Pretty good Octoberfest. Had this poured into a pint glass.  Beautiful color, probably the best feature of the beer, a very nice reddish-orange.  The flavor wasn't quite a strong as I'd like for an October, the molasses and malt that you'd like to see are there, but are just mild. Good head, nice lacing. Very good, better than most, but nothing special."

"Clear golden color decent white head. Rich sweet bready pilsner with a hint of hop flavor. Nice enough marzen, better than some other versions I've had but still not quite as good as the German versions."
""
""
"Recommended bay an old friend. Pours amber gold with a thin white head. Decent retention and some lacing. Aroma is of bready sweet malts, and caramel. Body is medium with light carbonation. Taste is malty up front. Hints of toast and fruit, with a touch of hops in the finish. Excellent!"

"DATE TASTED: September 13, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ayinger willibecker...OCCASION: soccer weekend #1--a success... APPEARANCE: nice, dark amber body that supports a healthy, two-finger off-white head--creamy and frothy, and settles well; lacing is scarce .. AROMA: toasted malts compliment the cold rain outside; some bread, but the flowery hops round the malts to a more balanced fest than expected... PALATE: reasonably smooth and pleasant to drink; a bit chewy for a fest--an attribute of differentiation ...TASTE: malts are more sugary than what the aroma suggests; a bit of caramel and oats late; hops are balancing and lightly floral...OVERALL: stands out from other fests by performing a pleasant balancing act..."

"Pours a nice deep ruddy amber with a light creamy white head. Small amounts of lacing hang on. The aroma is mild and malty, with some nice caramel notes and a little hops earthy character. The taste is a little anemic, lacking even the character of the aroma. The body is a little thin and a little too carbonated. Not bad, but not the best of a sizeable bunch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker than the quintessential Oktoberfest brew, this offering has some uniqueness to go along with its stylistic tradition. Maltier and toastier than I prefer, it is nevertheless tasty and eminently drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good Oktoberfest, but nothing close to the good German examples, as it lacks complexity in the maltiness and is too sweet and single noted to be truly great. Nonetheless, this would make for a great, easy drinking fall beer."
"Might just be my favorite Oktoberfest. No need for a highfalutin review; just try it! Prost!"

"A good take on the Marzen style. The pour was a dark red/amber color with a thin head that trailed the glass. The smell was full of bread and toasted malt. The taste was smooth with flavors popping up from the malt giving a full bodied flavor. The mouthfeel was also nice, not too thick or thin for the style. I liked it a lot."

"Overall/Comments: One of the better all around American brewed Octoberfest beers that I have had. This has a really great flavor profile, nice body, and an ABV perfect for sessioning. Try it!!. Classified as a Marzen/Octoberfest @ 5.3% ABV. Consumed 10/26/2013."

"The Crack revealed a brimful CAN and the inverted Glug almost overflowed my special CAN-shaped glass until I backed off and let it settle. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 22, < 27) with button-bright clarity. The head settled into two fingers of dense, rocky, tawny foam with good retention. Nose had a caramel maltiness which struck me as being a bit sweeter than I like. Some nice, sticky lacing began to appear as I patiently waited. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching a creaminess on the tongue. The taste seemed kind of odd for the style - slightly minty with an underlying nuttiness. It was not bad, per se, but kind of unexpected. Finish was semi-sweet and nothing like I remember most oktoberfests/marzens, but not bad."
"Overall: This is a great Oktoberfest! I would have this one again for sure!"
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed it and would drink it again, but I don't expect a true Oktoberfest to have this degree of hop content. Quality brew, no doubt, but borderline-not-an-Oktoberfest. Compare with Thomas Hooker, Sam Adams, or Otter Creek Oktoberfests."

"O: One of the better fall beers or ""Oktoberfests"" I've had. Full bodied, but not over the top. Simplicity can be a good thing sometimes."
""
"o: Decent Marzen, but that somewhat sharp tinge detracts. Apparently my palate and Tettnang and Willamette hops do not get along as well as they should."
""
"Pours a striking autumnal copper with a finger of off-white head. The nose is malty and bready. The flavor profile is highlighted by a touch of sweetness from the caramel malt. There is a slight bitterness on the finish. This is a touch lighter in body than the very best of the style, but this is still a superior effort."
""
""
""
""
"Harpoon should require its Octoberfest be served with a soft pretzel and mustard - I mean it, even when purchased at the grocery store. This longneck is well balanced and malty. I particularly enjoyed the blended spice and nut flavors. Overall exactly as one would expect, although it was thin bodied for what I would expect from an Octoberfest brew."
""
""
"Overall: This is another solid American version of an Oktoberfest beer. Great balance between the hops and the malt. Very good. This is another Oktoberfest beer that I’ll have to add to my rotation."
""
""
""
"We'll it's October, month of the Octoberfest, when every brewery has their special October brew out. Harpoon has never disappointed so let's give this one a whirl. Popping the top I get a very sweet waft of malts and grape-like olfactory inputs. The brew pours to a bright orange color with a nice large bubble head that has a creamy top. On the taste this brew is as sweet as it smells but not overly so. Typical of its style, there is not much if any bitterness present. The taste is consistent throughout with a solid syrupy mouthfeel and a very slight dry chalkiness in the the finish, that cleanses the palate of the bold sweetness. A very good beer, great for the style and quite sessionable."
""

""
""
""
""
"O - I picked up a 12-pack because I needed something to last a while. Due to the quality of this beer it did not last a while. I expected to have one every night or so, and almost always had two. Very enjoyable. I'm not typically a huge fan of Harpoon, but I think they did a great job here."

"Notes: This is my first full review and not my favorite of the Oktoberfest beers it is a very solid beer and a good drinkable beer fits with other harpoon styled beers."
"Overall, this is definitely an ""Americanized"" verison of the style but I quite like it. A little more bitterness and roast and it works very nicely."

""
""
""
""
""
"O - What a dissapointment!  Has an attractive appearance and an interesting aroma.  Taste is just not my cup of tea and really nothing like the other beers in this style.  Would never knowingly have this beer again."

""
"Overall – A rather enjoyable Oktoberfest overall. It was a little on the maltier side, but was balanced nicely with a good base of sweet flavors and some lighter flavors of spice, nut and grass. A good one to try."

"Notes: Better than the sum of its parts, which are still very good. Definitely one of the better common American Oktoberfest beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid brew, I'm not usually into the style but this was definitely enjoyable. Fans of the more traditional style may not be 100% sold on this one since it is definitely an adaptation of sorts on Harpoon's end."

"Overall: i'm a bit surprised by this beer, and my ratings show it. Best beer to date. Appearance brings it down, but it smells as its supposed to, and well in the end it gets an OK in my book."
""
"This is an enjoyable Oktoberfest. Malt is clearly noticeable on the nose and tongue. The most interesting thing for me was a dry bitter aftertaste that never quite left my mouth. I would probably get this again."
""
""
"o - I used to like this beer a lot but as I grow fonder of the IPAs I do believe I have moved beyond the Octoberfest beers. Part of the season like the foliage though!"
"12oz bottle served in a beer mug. Clear amber color with a white head that eventually just went away. Lots of sweet malty aromas. The taste is sweet caramel upfront finishing with a bitter bite. It goes down smooth and easy. Good seasonal beer, prost."
""
""
"O: Very smooth drinkable beer. A favorites."
"notes: good, decent O-fest, comparable to Brooklyn IMO."

"O: Overall a decent beer with good balance of hops and malts, would definitly drink this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink a few and pair with some sausages or pork and sauerkraut. Better then other US versions of this style it can hold it's own but not the benchmark for the style. Will please most craft beer fans. I would get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this one has great drinkability, which is probably why the label states that they brew this beer for festivals. It did however seem to be a bit subdued in the malt profile. Overall enjoyable though."
""
"O: Lands toward the bigger, darker end of the O-fest spectrum. Not as technically sound as some out there, but a pleasant drink nonetheless."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/19/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, and herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity; fits the style very well. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, pear, apple, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and herbal hops. Minimal bitterness on the finish as expected; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, biscuit, toffee, light nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty nice flavor balance and complexity, but it was not as robust feeling as I was hoping from the aromas; zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Oktoberfest style. Nice flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to drink as expected. Could have used a bit fuller flavor, but this was still a very good style representation. Definitely enjoyed this one."

"O. This is a phenomenal rendition of the octoberfest. A must try."
"this beer has way too much head just taste too boozey smells boozey just nothing else say about this beer too dark in color not a winner skip it bring nothing to octoberfeat so nothing else to say keep moving i have taste better beer and this isnt one them"
"Taste is fairly straight forward, caramel upfront and dominate, high carbonation keeps things crisp and refreshing, mild hops too keep things somewhat balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this. It's really a nice interpretation of the style. I'll look forward to it for on now."
"Great flavors of caramel sweetness, mild toffee, crackers, bready flavors on the back end. All of these meld well make this one easy to drink. Tasty beer here that is a good representation by an American brewery. I wouldn't mind having a sixer of this in the fridge each and every fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it has all the strong points of a Harpoon beer, but the maltiness is overpowering. Probably the best Octoberfest I've ever had, but it's not enough to make me a fan of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. I had one straight from the bottle and another poured into a glass. Better to pour: there's a slight metallic taste that goes away as the beers fizzes a little. Looks lovely in the glass - a golden amber, less deep in color than other examples of the style. It also has more hop character than is typical... pleasant though, backed well by the malt and just a little caramel. Nice feel. I recommend it."
""
"O: This one started well but then seemed to slide. It tasted like the malts were over-cooked, or maybe that was the hop character - either way this wasn't a very good Oktoberfest to me."
""
"Overall I thought this beer wasn't that good and it was a below average example of the style, it just lacked all the things that make for a good Marzen. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, and the thin flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I feel no need to have another one, What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it didn't look that bad and it was pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the flavor it was pretty flat with some unneeded flavors and bitterness. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it really didn't have any redeeming quailitys and I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone. All in all this was another beer I didn't like from Harpoon Brewery, so far they might be my least favorite Microbrewery and I don't know if I will give them another chance, this Marzen fell pretty short and it just wasn't a good example of the style."
""
"This is one of the better American O-Fests that I’ve had lately. Just solid balance to the flavors and feel here that kept this interesting to drink. This is one of the few new to me ones that I’m actually glad I checked out this season."
"O: A great Fall beer that does the style well (even if it's really an ale). Very rich and flavorful with plenty of body. Definitely worth a try if you're an oktoberfest fan or like to try seasonal-worthy beers"
""
"This is a solid beer. It has great drinkability. It has good flavor as well. This would have gotten a higher rating if the hops didn't overpower the malty flavors. It's worth a try."
"Unfortunately, a fairly flawed example of the style. Fruity esters and phenols are the majority of the character of the brew. Unfortunate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a fan of this one. I am not really a fan of this style anyway, but I have has plenty other Ofests that were much better than this one. This came in a mix 12 pack, so three will be more than enough for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its like that guy at the Toga party ACTUALLY wearing a laurel that majored in philosophy. Right idea, just no."
""
""
"5.3% ABV for the record; no indication of bottling date."
""
""
""
"Harpoon's Octoberfest is among the best American Märzens I've tried. I'll be sure to drink it again next year."
""
""
""
"O: Little bit of a different take on the style but overall a very nice fall welcomer. I especially enjoyed the extra kick of spice in this one, it makes for a relaxing beer on a fall day and one of the better O-fests I've had this season so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While it lacks some of the flavor punch i desire, it makes up for it with it's smooth quality."
"Overall: I like this. Harpoon was able to put their own twist on the style without overdoing it like many other American breweries."
"O: I'm surprised how much I liked this one. It wouldn't be considered a true marzen to the style Nazis, but as a spiced fall lager, it really hits the spot."
"Pass."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very much enjoying this: inoffensive, tasty, and exceptionally crushable."
"O: Very drinkable, love the flavor of this version of the style. This is the first Octoberfest I have had this year, so I dont have anything to compare it to. Overall, very solid!"

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, I actually forgot I had this, best by 12/15/11 (I might come back next year and edit this review). This pours a copper color with a massive tan head. The smell is mostly of malts, caramel and toffee. The feel is medium. The taste is good enough, a little bitterness, mostly malts caramel, bread and toffee."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is on the malty side. Taste is malts up front, caramel, a bit of sweetness to it, some breadiness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best Octoberfest's out IMO."
"Overall im disappointed with this beer I hope I just got a bad batch maybe ill give it another go and change my opinion next year."
""
"Another tardy O-Fest review...sue me... It pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises light buttery biscuit, light orange zest, and a few drops of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, this is the epitome of an average O-Fest. I don't mean that as a negative, necessarily, but this stuff doesn't endear itself to me enough for me to think purely positively of it. It's just...average..."

"O: A pretty good Octoberfest in a market that gets bombarded with good and bad marzan's during the fall."
""
""
""
"A reddish brown / amber on the pour with a nice lasting tan head. Aroma and Taste of moderately toasted malt, barley, some nice yeast and breadiness with some slight fruity notes and light hops. A nice medium body with good carbonation. Finish is malty, yeast some breadiness, a slight note of dark fruit with a nice moderate hops and lightly lingering nutty ending. Overall a nice drinkable Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I'm not sure if this style will actually ever just blow me away, but I've had some good ones this fall, w/ Harpoon's falling in that group."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice head and some fair lacing. Nose is a nice balance of toasted malts and some fall spices. Toasted grains, with some slight bitter and sweet components for balance. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"overall this is a nice octoberfest."
"O-I was a bit surprised by this beer, I did not think I would turn out as good as it did. The malt works well and it lacks the flat finish I sometimes get in an Oktoberfest"
"O - Very good, a solid seasonal pick and repeat purchase. Harpoon turned in an above average American Oktoberfest here."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a vibrant, clear, amber coloring with a thin, frothy, densely foamed off-white head that has a very decent staying power to it. Aromas are rich and malty, with nut and toffee highlights, and very light roast and cinnamon hints. Flavor is rich, with a roast and slightly bitter hops undertone. The rich malt characteristics of toffee and nut are creamy and smooth, with the sharp bitter and roast character helping to balance and cut the feel in the mouth. The afteratste is a bit of a tangy sweet, with a green spice flavor that cleans off the palate. The finish has a slight linger, but only the spicing really lasts for any time. Good flavors and decent balance throughout."
"O: Looks nice. Smells wonderful. I liked this better than the Heavy Seas."
"o - goes down easy and fits the style well. a solid beer, but won't blow your socks off."
"Year in year out, this east coast brewery brings it."
"O - Solid example of an Oktoberfest, certainly hits the spot on a cool evening!"
"O- So far my favorite marzen of the year, though I've only had three or four others so ... I'd recommend it to anyone as an example of type, and could drink it as a one-off or as a session-er. More good stuff from Harpoon."
"O - Light smell, but good flavor. It gives you sweet and bitter taste, while not being too harsh on either end. This a great beer to enjoy with some friends on a cool fall day. I can almost feel the falling leaves blow past me."
"Overall its not a bad beer. Taste pretty good and isnt too filling. Cant go wrong pickin this one up."
"This pours a brown-orange color with a finger of head. Aroma is of sweet, slightly nutty malts. The taste is pretty spot-on with the toasty, malty nuttiness, with just a bit of a hop kick. However, there's a lingering sweetness that I don't really welcome at all. The mouthfeel is about average, and the drinkability is impacted by the over-sweetened finish. Overall, not really worth buying over the slew of better Oktoberfests, both domestic and imported."
"Opinion: I am a big fan of the Oktoberfest style when it is done right. I personally like Hacker Pschorr the best, and I have a case sitting on the floor in my office right now. All this said, the Harpoon version is obviously intended to be an Oktoberfest, but it is falling short on the mouthfeel especially. It seems like their technique is close, but the water may need to be filtered and the grain bill tweaked to get them in. They would need to back off on the crystal and use more Munich malt for toasty notes and the color. Adding about 25% distilled water may be all they need too, to put this beer right in there. Regardless, this is a pretty decent attempt at an O-Fest."
"O- A pretty tasty brew, definitely hits the spot for chilly fall days and makes for very easy drinking. It's interesting to see a slightly more hop-heavy rendition of the old German style."
"A nice Bostonian twist on an Oktoberfest. Definitely pick up if you like beers with hints of fruit or slight sweet tastes. It is not overpowering as to detriment the beer."
"Not terrible by any means, but I've had other Oktoberfests that I've preferred by far."
"O: Harpoon has produced an Octoberfest beer which keeps in mind German tradition but also includes American tastes. It is a beauty to look at in the glass, and it certainly has a nice bit of malt. Though the beer is not over-hopped, it does have a bit more hop kick than might be necessary for a marzen style beer. While a slight hop edge does help balance, the star of a marzen style is supposed to be the malt. This is a nice beer, but if you are in search of the more malt dominated marzen style, you may be disappointed by the hop level in this one."
"I had this on tap a few nights ago at a local restaurant. I'd had this in the bottle a couple of years back so it's hard to compare. I found it to be quite nice. It had a nice copper color, not much head, and a moderate carbonation. Very nice toasty flavor to it. Similar to a lot of other marzens."
"I like this one. It has a great drinkable balance."
"The best oktoberfest I have had this year. A very smooth and full-bodied seasonal offering, Harpoon has nailed it again. One sip of this ale ushers in a feeling of fall and cooler weather...not a bad thing at all. A very good representation of jeans-wearing football season."
"O: The beer goes down quite easy and is rather sessionable. It sort of tastes like a hybrid between a Vienna Lager and a Märzen."
"Medium bodied here but the body is somewhat oily. Good carbonation here. Not bad here, I tend to enjoy harpoon. A decent take on a classic style"
"O -- Very nice American take on the style, reminds me a little of Hacker-Pschorr's Amber Märzen. Glad I took the chance."
"Overall I am glad I enjoyed this more than the pumpkin beer since it's closer to what I expect for the style. For some reason though I doubt I will be finding cases of the stuff since the market is flooded at the moment with other brands. Just singles..."
"Pretty good 'fest beer. Bready, but with a refreshing lightness in the flavor."
"O: Decent octoberfest, rather crisp. One of my favorites of the year."
"O - A nice example of a oktoberfest ale. Has a nice combination of caramel and fruity flavors."
"Most of the German-brewed Oktoberfest beers are far lighter in malt character than this. Better American-made versions as well."
"This is a solid offering, but I do wish the flavor profile was stronger."
"M/O: Not as drinkable as Sam Adam's, actually a bit 'hot' despite the low abv. Worthy of a single bottle purchase though."
"Overall not bad, sweet malts, reddish caramel malts, not really toasty enough or straw for me, creamy malt taste is different, and not really any crisp clean lager taste. Hops are also a different and interesting mix."
"O: An ""American"" Octberfest, I cant tell the difference but this is a solid brew I have had before finally reviewed it."
"Pours a dark amber with reddish orange highlights. A nice dense foam head that fades away. The smell is grainy and malty, with subtle sweet notes tied in. The taste is big, with the malt up front, and moves to a substantial bitter hop, and finishes with a subtle malt undertone. The mouthfeel is smooth, medium, and rich. A nice complex beer that hits many flavors. Overall a good beer for the style, a different take, one that has a good deal of flavor."
"an octoberfest- tinged american ale. The real thing that competes with the Germans. Harpoon really nailed it."
"Poured out the darker side of amber with a thin layer of head that vanishes quickly.I love the color of this beer. Nose has a metallic roasted grain character with some zesty hop aromas floating around. Extremely smooth medium body. Upfront there is a lot of German malts and honey finishes with a subtle hop zest and dry. A roasted malt honey sweetness lingers over the dryness evening it out. It leaves me wanting more and with a 12pk being around $10 I consider it a deal."
"EDIT: Think it came out of my fridge a little too cold... as it warmed, the mouthfeel thickened up just a little and the flavors and aromas became more pronounced, but still not overbearing. Great beer!"
"Overall, this is a solid Octoberfest, being nicely balanced and featuring tasty malty flavors. I did find the aftertaste slightly watery, but that wasn't enough to make me want to skip the next sip."
"This beer started off nicely for me. The pour was a very nice copper color just like a good Octoberfest beer should have. The head was strong and last a little while. The aromas of spices and autumn leaves were present on the nose. The taste was good in the beginning but as the beer warmed up it started getting a little funky on me. Not sure why but it was kind of gross after mid bottle. Not sure how this can happen, perhaps a bad bottle... Either way it was a bit of a disappointment to me. I would give this another try if I'm ever at a beer fest or something and they have it there."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled glass. Pours a deep copper color, slightly fluffy white head that coated the sides of the glass. lots of sweetness and spices in the aroma,which is mirrored in the flavor. cinnamon, nutmeg and honey are the main components complementing a solid caramel malt backbone. very sweet aftertaste with a bit of the spices added in. a nice marzen, but nothing really sets it into the best of category, but it is definitely in the better than most group."
"I would probably have enjoyed this more during the fall. It is a well thought out beer for the warm days and chilly nights of the New England fall days. Nice brownish copper color to accentuate the dying colors of fall. Liquid is pretty opaque and doesn't produce much head or leave much of a trail. Taste is a bitter sweet. Mostly seems like pine hops and some roasted malts to give it a smoked maple syrup flavor. Easy to enjoy as the sun sets to remind you that it'll be cold in a few minutes and the bitterness of fall descends on you."
"D: Smooth enough for the lighter sided folk yet robust enough to satisfy its fall beer category."
"D: Robust with lots going on. A party beer that seems even bigger than it actually is. Plenty of flavor in a very fall seasonal way, but it seems a bit rugged for a marzen. The nose is robustly to style, but the palate is less than lager clean. Still very drinkable."
"The flavor brings some nice toasted malt with a bit of caramel and a bit of light leafy hopping. Nice light body with good carbonation and a really nice hop character. A really nice rendition of an American Octoberfest and one I quite enjoyed."
"D: A disappointing effort from Harpoon on this one. A definite skip that could be a maybe with more love in the malt department."
"When it comes to a decent Octoberfest, this beer is kind of in the middle of the bunch. It pours a medium amber color with a nice scent of spices that scream Octoberfest. It has a slight bitter taste that full of spice and yet smooth to drink. My only complaints are I think it's a little too smooth needing more texture to it and the slight after taste it leaves."
"Nice beer, poured into a tulip with a nice head that was well retained. Smell of hops is noticed which is different, nice. The tastes is very bready and malty with a nice balance of hops. Medium bodied and medium carbonation in this beer that stands apart from other Oktoberfests. Nicely done."
"D: Session beer, great with the octoberfest foods we all enjoy."
"Taste shows a nice balance of various flavors of malt; toast, nuts, sweet grains and toffee. Leafy hops clean up the finish decently enough. Very smooth drinker with a nice smooth feeling on the palate, I am impressed with this harpoon offering. Plenty of flavor, I cant tell if this is an ale or lager, with the full body and moderate fruitiness. Seems to work pretty well though, I wouldn't mind having a full sixer of this in the fridge."
"D: A bit heavy for this style, not as drinkable as, say, Spaten's Octoberfest, but doable. Certainly American."
"Like I alluded to above, the body is too full for my liking in a Oktoberfest. That affects the mouthfeel in the finish greatly. Through all of these, this is still a good beer and very easy to drink, just not a great example."
"D - Pretty drinkable malt-forward brew."
"This is so much better in a bottle than on tap it's almost like a different beer. Whereas I usually think of Harpoon as a better than average beer, and a good hometown tap option I rarely think of them as great. Between the 100 Barrel Series Fankenfest and this, Harpoon seems to have a knack for the Octoberfest style."
"Overall/Drinkability: Not too shabby of a beer! As far as American Oktoberfest beers go, I would be more inclined to reach for the Sam Adams Oktoberfest in my local liquor store, but this one is certainly very good. For 5.5% ABV, I sure do taste the alcohol quite a bit on this one. The nose and mouthfeel are quite nice though, and the taste still enjoyable. Not my favorite within this style category, but also not my least favorite."
"D - Drinkable, however not my favorite Octoberfest. Definitely better options out there but I wouldn't decline one if offered."
"Dark mahogany color, clear, but with little head, and that fading quickly. Lightly toasty malts make up most of the nose, slightly bready. Flavor is solid on the style, with plenty of appropriate malt flavor. Hops are given a light touch, but sufficient to dry out the sweetness, especially at the finish which is none too sweet. Excellent body, not heavy, but full."
"Smell was nuts, some roasted malts, hint of hops, but nothing too strong. The taste was the same. It almost tasted like water in the middle, with some nuts up front and what tasted like a berry or two in the initial landing on the tongue. Drinkability is solid, mouthfeel is light to medium. Overall not impressed - just a tad too watery for my taste."
"Pours a copper flor that is very clear and has some reddish hues to it. Very dark for the style. Pretty 1 finger off white head with no lacing. Aroma has that sweet peanut aroma as well as lager yeasty aromas. A touch of sweetness also on the aroma. The taste is really below average. Has a vomit taste to it on the finish. Metallic and off balanced. Really tastes like crappy amber lager from a crappy"
"D: Excellent. I had this one after two Sam Adams Octoberfests (an Octoberfest that I like a lot) and liked it better. Went down real easily and I was regretting that I hadn't seen this one earlier in the night."
"It starts off with a nice smooth nutty and hoppy flavor. It isn't strong flavored, but also not watery."
"This beer has a very good flavor. It's great on a fall night. I would like to see a little less carbonation, however."
"T: this beer has a malty back bone, but good. "
""
"Very good octoberfest I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up again."
"An ok brew, but I have had better of this type. So far, the weakest Harpoon offering I have had. Thoroughly enjoyed the others."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, light at that, fairly aggressive carbonation for the style leading to a semidry finish. Certainly a drinkable lager and a good beer for the season."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is grain with some toffee notes. It smells about like an Oktoberfest should smell. The flavor is more of the same with notes of toffee and grain, but I also get some chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing exciting, but a decent beer."
"D-Maybe a little sweeter than I would like."
"All malt, this is what October is all about. Quite drinkable!"
"I could drink this beer all day long and every drop would be as good as the first."
"There are much better October themed beers out there. Long Trail, even Sam Adams..."
"Easy drinker and tastes so refreshing. perfect for watching the autumn swiftly turn the colors of life to death, one of the most beautiful acts of mother nature one could witness."
"A dark orange/amber/red body topped by off-white creamy head. Smells of sweet grain, caramel, toffee, slight veggies. Tastes of veggies, grains, a sweet note of sugar, corn, some residual sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Light in body and in carbonation. The lingering sweet notes offends the palate a bit but otherwise a nice beer."
"Nothing wrong with this beer but just not something you need to go back to. I prefer Sam's Octoberfest a little. making my way though this season's Octoberfest offerings and then will be able to rate this better."
"D: A wildly uneven beer. Not undrinkable, just average."
"D-not too bad, the taste stays, i could drink a lot of this."
"Taste is malty, sweet, and slightly spicy, with a hint of fruitiness/banana. This is a great example of the Oktoberfest style. Will definitely try this again if I see it this season."
"Pours a dark amber with an off-white one finger head. Quickly dissipates with little lacing to be found. Smell is less than impressive. A bit metallic, but also has minor bready, caramel and dark fruit aroma. Taste is nice. Nice caramel malt to start. Breadyness, hints of toffee and dark fruits also present. Finishes up with a little hit of crisp, tongue-tingling hops. Nice mouthfeel. Medium bodied and creamy which turns crisp at the very end."
"Pours a clear mahogany body, with two fingers of frumpy tan head up top with good retention. Aromas are more subdued than those of most Oktoberfests, and are one dimensionally toasty. Flavors are a bit deeper, with an earthy, almost tea-like bitterness being added to the predominately toasty profile. Medium body is less full than that of my favorite members of this style, but its lingering flavors of toast and tea make it an overall pleasurable beer."
"Yay! Oktoberfest is upon us. The American renditions of this malty brew is hitting the shelves in full force. Harpoon surprised me with this one, as I have not seen this style by them in past years. Poured a autumn leaf colored amber with champange like fizzy bubbles. Smell was sweet and malty with a healthy aroma of caramel malts and mango like fruitiness. The tsate was silky and seductive with the caramel malts jumping out front then fading but not completely away into a spicey hop finish with some mild fruitiness in the background. Make me want to get my stein toast to the best beer party around!"
"Either way, a great marzen."
"D- not to bad of a beer i can defently enjoy a few of these."
"D - This Marzen really doesn't do it for me... The appearance and aroma are spot on, but the other components miss the mark for the style... At a time then there are a multitude of seasonal options, this one is one that I'll avoid in the future..."
"D: Very drinkable, this has a great mix of flavor and feel with a low-medium abv making it perfect drinkability for the fall days."
"-Prost!"
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle, the beer is a reddish copper color, crystal clear and has a big off-white head. This is a beautiful beer. The first whiff smells of toasted malt. Sweet malt and more layers of toasted barley are what this aroma is packing. The first sip reveals a ""heavy"" medium body. All that toasted malt from the aroma still comes through in the flavor. There is a toasted whole grain rustic bread in the middle and an almost astringent finish that isn't harsh or off putting but caught me off guard. No complaints in any of the categories. Overall this is a good beer."
"Beer is mildly malty, pretty bright on the palate. Its mildly fruity, almost banana, pretty good. Mouthfeel is good and its highly drinkable. Its a simple beer, not much to write about, the fruitiness in the midpalate was a good surprise. Fun."
"D: A smooth and refreshing beer, but not what the style should be. Missing key flavors and falls short."
"Clear orange/amber with a thin, light beige cap. Fair head retention, spotty lacing. Malty nose with a fair bit of fruitiness. Bready and caramel, some toast, nice aroma. Solid bitterness, slightly fruity with caramel sweetness. Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly dry, nice texture. Overall, pretty decent but not exceptional."
"D- One of the best American Maerzens I've had thus far. Malt profile isn't quite as good as some of the German versions, but this is a solid example."
"Overall a pleasant beer, a bit more hoppy than your average Oktoberfest which will be a plus for many. Refreshing and easy to drink. I like it's overall dry and crisp character!"
"Drinkability - It's a solid beer all together. Goes down well but is quite filling. A six pack of these will probably last me a week. It's not a beer I can really tackle in one night."
"Orange/amber in color. Smells a little malty and hints of caramel. Taste is somewhat thin and a little on the bitter side. Leaves a touch of caramel on the aftertaste, but that fades quickly. A little thin on the body with some fizziness. Not a lot of complex flavors. Easy to drink, but other than bitterness, weak in flavor."
"D: Very easy to drink this Oktoberfest."
"D - Very drinkable. Settle down with a 6 pack and enjoy."
"goes somewhat harsh and smoked. there is some apple quality to a rather solid looking beer but something is lob sided in the palate. its a tad acidic and hard on the stomach. smoke and carbonation hurt the stomach. the feel is smooth then coarse... a bitter finish that isn't back with enough malt stale apple quality that i get in a good german. a beer that does it initially but turns in the finish."
"Overall, very very drinkable. Worth having this in this cask form, and now I'm spoiled and won't drink it any other way."
"D- Drinking by a bonfire a 6 pack would be in dangerous territory of losing it's life quickly. Very tasty."
"Harpoon is not one of those breweries that I think of when the topic turns to good-great craft beer. That said, they've done a wonderful job with Octoberfest. What a pleasant surprise on this snowy February morning."
"Drinkability - Very good"
"Pours out of the bottle with a nice crisp looking clean amber, with a generous, barely off white, soapy head. It has a nice retention and a good solid lacing throughout. The smell is mainly of sweet malt and a nice clean grain, with a bit of fleeting floral hops and citrus rind. The taste is of grain, some rye bread and a touch of herb and spice. The flavor is a bit hard to pinpoint, with mostly grain and bread flavors with some light caramel malt coming through and being followed up by some light pleasant hop flavor. It has a nice full mouthfeel as a result of the malt presence. One thing I noticed as the beer warmed was a bit of an off flavor, a bit of soap and some unpleasant pepper. The former could have been a result of a bad bottle. Overall it is a nice beer, excluding the off taste. It was a successful attempt at the traditional German style in terms of color and aroma, but the taste was a little lacking in my opinion. It is a sessionable beer, has some good fall taste like a very subtle pumpkin ale, but it needs to make up its mind about what style it is and stick to it."
"Had the first taste this year at the Harpoon Oktoberfest in Vermont. Then had it a Willimantic Brewery, both times it was consistently a good beer. Good amber color, not overly spicy or pumpkin flavored. Finishes well without any overbearing aftertaste."
"Smooth mouthfeel, and very satisfying beer."
"Drinkability- Overall a very drinkable seasonal beer. Very different from a true oktoberfest bier but a unique and creative fall drink."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I expected a Maerzen but ended up with a Red Ale, not too shabby."
"A clear but radiant copper color with a decent off-white head and similar lacing to go with it. The aroma brings malty raisin and fruity banana bubblegum in quite a snootful of flowery goodness! The flavor follows with a much more earthy, peppery grain malt that bites the tongue with quite a bit of grassy hop and a hint of dry alcohol. Quite refreshing and drinkable leaving behind a little more of that raisin/prune kiss over caramel wheat and it's hard to lose that interesting banana touch. It's on the thin crisp side but appropriately for the style I think. This is pretty neat. Not sure everyone will embrace it but it has basic Octoberfest qualities while delivering some subtle complexities with nice bitterness. I enjoyed it and would drink again gladly."
"12 oz. Descently solid amber pour, some white head. Some sweet malt and autumn leaf aromas. Pleasant light/mid body, good malt flavor with a little herbal tea and pine/citrus hops, more piney than citrus. A good balance of flavor and drinkability. Probably won't seek out, but definetely would not turn away one either. Descent session beer from Harpoon."
"Drinkability: Easy to quaff down, but would I really want more than one of these in a night? It really comes down to a preference issue for me; I'm not the biggest Red Ale fan so I suppose it might get knocked a little for that. However, very good for its style."
"D: This is a very drinkable amber ale. Really good for the season."
"a bit darker than even most american o-fests, this was a deep copper/amber or reddish brown. decent off-white head. caramelly, bready, nutty malts in the nose. taste follows with the lightly sweet malts well-balanced by the underlying smooth hop bitterness. light/med bodied, crisp finish, frothy mouthfeel. sessionable and overall quite nice."
"Medium mouthfeel with decent carbonation."
"Overall, an easy drinking beer with some tasty flavors. Not my favorite Harpoon offering or Octoberfest for that matter but still solid."
"Very easy to drink. The sweetness can work on you over time, but otherwise very nice."
"D - My favorite take on the style so far. Well done!"
"I have been sampling a lot of octoberfests lately. Unforutnaley i havent been reviewing all of them. This particular octoberfest had a very rich amber reddish hue. Minimal lace and head. The beer did not have a prevalent smell, sort of weak. Thankfully the beer taste was pretty good. I had a nice carmel malt with overtones of cinnomon and spices. Tasted like a crips autum morining. The mouthfeel was average, some enjoyable tingles on the tounge. Overall a decent beer. I have had much better octoberfests this year but this beer dosent stand out. I would consider it the median."
"A wonderfully thick head sits on top of an incredibly amber colored beer. My favorite look easily. The head fades away very, very slowly. Some cinnamon and nutmeg flavoring accentuates the taste, but I'm a bit disappointed on the smell.Nothing really stands out. Taste wise its pretty good, nothing overbearing, typical octoberfest beer taste, in the style of American amber ales. The mouthfeel is about what you want out of a octoberfest, heavy, but drinkable."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper with a sticky, white head. The aroma is grainy, a bit sweet, the taste follows. The finish lingers a bit and is drying. The beer is a medium bodied and quite sessionable. I prefer other fest beers, but it is not bad."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of December 15, 2009. Sampled on October 11, 2009. It pours a mahogany-amber with a thin beige head. The clarity is pretty nice on it. The mouthfeel feels fairly bold. Tastewise, it has many of the elements of a decent ESB with a malty, raisin-like flavor as well. There's a dryer finish that leaves a little aftertaste. I would say taht overall this is a mild and comfortable beer."
"Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A solid Oktoberfest. Worth a try, if you can get it. One I'll probably come back to again."
"Drinkability: Not a traditional Octoberfest style, but still a damn good beer. Perfectly balanced and very sessionable, it is very satisfying. Definitely worth a try!"
"Great representation of a traditional oct-fest. Not anything I'd seek out, but a textbook example of the style."
"Taste is where it is at for me with this brew. This brew is hoppy and malty the balance is very nice. Very drinkable - although this is not a true octoberfest, it is very good for this time of year."
"However, the beer lacks adequate carbonation, and has no head. In fact, it reminded me of a homebrew that was only primed for a few days = FLAT. Not sure if I got a bad batch, but it really lacks proper carbonation. Could have been a great beer."
"This beer was ok but I have a problem with Octoberfests. If you like them, i'm not the best person to read a review from. They're stronger and heavier than an amber lager or pilsner but not wintery intense like a bock, maibock, etc. It's not so spicy that it's like a winter ale but not clean enough to drink without noticing. This beer was typical for an octoberfest but nothing really stood out for me. That said, I like a lot of beers from this brewery so if you like octoberfest try this one."
"This beer is quite drinkable. It has a nice flavor that doesn't get tiresome. Not too heavy. Decent session beer."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is good, even though this is not a true Octoberfest beer, it is still really good and something to look forward to in the fall"
"I like this beer, pretty good across the board. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, it pours a nice amber red color with perfect clarity to it. It has a nice orangy cream colored head with many different size bubbles to it. It goes away pretty quickly and there really isn't much lacing to it. Pretty nice aroma, very malty, a bit of roast to it, almost kind of a hop after-smell if that makes sense. The taste is very good, well balanced. Mostly roasted malts has a nice finish, slightly bitter. Good mouthfeel, I'd consider it full bodied. The drinkability is good. I gotta say it wasnt what I was expecting for an oktoberfest, but still a nice heavy ale. A very nice fall beverage."
"This is a tough review for me. I wish this beer tasted more like the aroma indicated it might... The aftertaste from this beer is not something that I care for. I'm not a big fan of an alcohol taste to my beer, either, and this beer has more than I'd like - especially for the style."
"Buy Again? Possibly. I don’t usually drink lager like beers and there are better beers in this style. But it is a good drinking beer."
"Prosit!!!"
"Harpoon Octoberfest has a clean malty taste, a clear copper color, and a slightly hoppy aroma. Very smooth on the tongue. Overall a very drinkable Octoberfest that is not too overpowering with a sulfur smelling lager yeast. One of the better Octoberfests on the market this year."
"A nice brew overall - readily available at most decent package stores, this will surely be a fall standby for me."
"D: Definitely a robust Oktoberfest from Harpoon. Malty, but a bit overshadowed by hop bitterness rather than the hop spiciness the style is known for. An interesting interpretation. Drinkability suffers slightly because it's a bit rough around the edges, but overall a pretty nice fall seasonal."
"Taste: Hops and toasty malt are in balance. Supremely drinkable. I wish I had more than a single bottle of the stuff."
"Taste is a bit bitter/hoppy, slightly carbonated. Not sweet but still malty. Body is very light and smooth, it's pleasant but I wouldn't want to drink this all night."
"Drinkability: Pretty close for an ale. But as an amber ale theres nothing really unique about this other then its level of malt. A fitting seasonal ale but pretty average overall"
" A very drinkable American red ale."
"Drinkability: Overall, I love the effort Harpoon did with this beer, it's got very good balance and isn't too overmalted like some other offerings I've had. The lighter mouthfeel makes it easier to drink then some other Octobers on the shelf and the hop flavors kept me interested throughout. I'll definetley pick this up again when."
"Probably the driest amber ale i've ever had. Usually not a bad thing, i like dry beers, but this was too much, there needs to be a little sweetness there to bring it to life. Shouldn't be called an octoberfest and wouldn't try again."
"Must try."
"Hey! A pretty good Oktoberfest! Thank you, Harpoon, for helping me to enjoy this style."
"The body of this beer is very comparable to most Oktoberfests. It comes across as a maltier lager. However, I find this beer more drinkable than most Oktoberfests due to the nice addition of the roasted/chocolate malts. The roastiness cuts down on the sweetness a bit and makes this a very session-able Oktoberfest. Nice work Harpoon."
"This is perhaps the best Octoberfest I have tried, next to Paulaner. I highly recommend it, as I've found many American offerings of this style to be a letdown. Now I understand why someone before me nearly bought the store out of this beer. Well done Harpoon!"
"overall i would have to say it's a pretty good oktoberfest brew. still curious on the great lakes. beats the bells!!"
"I love the mix of different hop flavors in one beer. Had Samuel Adams octoberfest so decided to try harpoon, another local brewer. Have to say I am a bigger fan of this octoberfest than Sams. This beer is full of flavor that mixes well with food and just fine to sit back watching a game. Main reason for love of this beer is that the after taste is none. Most octorberfest's leave behind numerous traces of flavor that many people don't appreciate. This is an excellant beer and definitly would recommend to others. Too bad it's only out for 2 months."
"12 oz brown bottle obtained at Shaw's Supermarket in Derry, NH. pours a clear dark copper color with about a half inch of off white head that is slowly dissipating and leaving some nice lacing. scents of malt and spices hit the nose. hops immediately play on the taste buds, with some spice and malt undertones. light carbonation and a relatively easy drinker."
"Definitely a staple in the Autumn/Oktoberfest game here in New England. Time tested for sure, this is a good one for sure. Totally solid."
"Drinkability - I could easily have a few over the coarse of a fall evening."
"T- Very smooth, the malts tame the bitterness. There was even a slight fruitiness to it. As far as American Octoberfests go, this is a solid entry...better than most US Octoberfest."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my dimpled mug. The beer appears a hazed golden copper color with about an inch of off white foam. Aroma and flavor consist of medium toasted grain, bready malt, grassy hops, caramel and toffee. Slightly thin bodied with adequate carbonation."
"Orange amber with a light tan head that leaves pretty lace on the glass. Smells of toffee and biscuit malt with faint peppery hop notes. Tastes rich and well balanced for the style with caramel malt and tobacco flavors leading the way into a leafy, almost minty hop finish. Smooth and medium bodied with crisp carbonation. A highly drinkable beer and one of the better American fest beers IMO."
"Drinkability- I can't say this is near as drinkable as my Erdinger Oktoberfest-Weizen, or even my Balto Marz-hon. Same goes for my Paulaner Oktoberfest. As much as I wanted to love this, it totally missed the mark in the end. Sorry Harpoon, perhaps next time Ohio can get some fresher product."
"D - Easy to drink but quite lacking in the flavor department. As stated earlier I don't know Harpoon's intentions, but either way this is a pretty run of the mill American marzen or a dime a dozen amber. End bitterness doesn't help much either."
"Drinkability: A perfectly acceptable Octoberfest that will appeal to most palates...I could have a six, but will most likely search for something else."
"I would prefer this over Sam Adams Octoberfest (also like to suppose local brewery's)."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination that did a good job of complimenting each other and making the beer nice to drink. The smooth and roasted malt taste made for a fairly representable Oktoberfest."
"(rated Sep 17, 2008)"
"This beer I sampled is infact best drank by 2/2008, but the taste has still held up. It has a sweet aftertaste that makes me want to drink right after the initial sip. I am more of an avid Sam Adams Octoberfest drinker, but after sampling this post best drink by date, I will only hope a fresh brew taste just as good"
"A pretty decent Octoberfest overall...just a bit too sweet for me."
"D - this is a very good beer and easy to put down"
"M/D - slightly overcarbonated for me, a little too earthy and sweet for me to enjoy alot of. Not bad, just not for me."
"12 oz bottle. Pours an amber/reddish color with a 1/2"" white head. Has a sweet sugar/caramel aroma to it. Mouthfeel has a moderate feel to it. Not thin and watery, but not heavy either. Moderate carbonation. Taste was malts and mild caramel with a slight hop background. Nice beer for the fall."
"Overall: This beer is nothing like a Maerzen at all. It's not even a good ale maerzen. One of the few times that I'll choose a Sam Adams version first."
"D: It goes down pretty easily--nothing too crazy going on here. I could definitely see myself sitting out on the porch (if, you know, I had one) and drinking this while watching the leaves fall. Probably won't get another sixer of it this year, but I'll definitely have to come back to it next year."
"Harpoon Octoberfest Beer pours a reddish copper color with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is quite nice, bready/biscuity malt and hops combine pleasantly. The flavor is good and hoppy with a biscuit malt backbone that asserts itself toward the end. Very enjoyable."
"D: A dry drinking October that is not overly sweet making for a nice light session that wont fill you up."
"Pours a clear dark copper color with 3 fingers of frothy off-white head. Good retention leaves some nice lacing behind. Smells of floral hops, caramel, and toasted malt. Tastes of caramel, toasted grain, bread, and citrus fruits with a slightly dry grassy finish mixed with some floral hops. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Sweet and balanced with a nice crisp dry finish. Easy to drink, but I was a little thrown off at first since it's not an Oktoberfest/Marzen as the name would suggest. Once you get past that fact, it's a good brew worth picking up again."
"I will buy this again."
"The taste is a bit nutty, some florals mixed in, a rather sweetish malty beer, with an old English ale feel to it. There isn't much of the roasted or peaty quality typical of Red ales, but this is an amber ale with some hoppy bite in the finish, some course graininess, and a nice mid bodied firmness to it. This is a very nice beer, even though it isn't really a Marzan."
"worth a try"
"Pours a clear medium amber color with orange hues and a one finger off white head of little bubbles, dissipates quickly with little lacing. Carmelized malt and fruity yeast dominate the aroma. Carmelized and toasted malt flavors up front with tea and lemon hop flavors in the middle mix with the fruity yeast ending with a dry chocolate finish. Medium high carbonation, medium body, this is a mouth cleansing beer that demands another sip."
"Overall it's not bad, but not the best for the style. The hops seem out of place."
"Served at 45 degrees. Poured into glass and drank from bottle. Good red/brown color fairly clear. Mild sweet malty taste. Very little depth in the malt flavor with strong hoppy finish midly bitter. Fairly drinkable. Woulda enjoy more if not as hoppy in the finish but seems to be the Harpoon m/o."
"Enjoy! Life is too short for bad beer!"
"Notes: Well done! This is a great Oktoberfest/Amber Ale brewed with Ale yeast instead of traditional Lager yeast."
"Not crazy about this particular Octoberfest, but I can see how some would like it."
"This is a good autumn beer. That said, it's really not a good Octoberfest, as it's more of a red ale, but still a good beer to enjoy in the cooler months."
"The feel is thick and milky. Remains for a bit after the swallow. It's a good bittersweet brew. Strong and flavorful. An earthy, autumnal beer."
"Overall it's an OKAY beer, and certainly sessionable as it's quite light. Doesn't wow me, and probably won't get again unless it's the best option on the table."
"This poured a dark, clear auburn with light tan head. It smelled like earthy barley and caramel malt, with light lemon hops. It tasted like earthy barley malt with rusty copper hops. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall, this was clean and drinkable, but it wasn't the most rewarding flavor. It was still a nice, simple, refreshing beer."
"Pours a copper body with auburn/amber hues mixed in and one-finger head that sticks around for a bit and leaves minor lacing. Decent sweet malt smell of caramel and a little bit of spice. Really smooth medium body, and while a sweet, caramel malt taste is overly present there is not much else than that as the hops and spices are light. A tad letdown from having had other Harpoon brews blow me away. Maybe I shouldn't be so hard. Still a good October brew and definitely sessionable."
"D- I would say this is highly drinkable, especially with the autumnal weather here in New England. But for me personally. I'm more likely to seek out a Pumpkin or a Harvest."
"A notch below average for this Octoberfest, from a brewery which hasn't really let me down yet. This one is too undercarbonated and suffers from this flatness along with being a tad too thin and watery. Tastewise it is missing out on some things also I must say. I've had some worse Octoberfests but I've had much better ones too.. try out Hooker's or Brooklyn's instead if you're in the New England area."
"D: Overall, I'm very pleased. Again, my latest Octoberfests have only been so-so, but this is a hit. Way to go, Harpoon."
"Pretty drinkable, a good beer overall."
"Watching football at McKee's it was time to review another brew. Off their tap this beer was a dark copper color with some reddish/rust hues. The head was off white, fluffy and laced in spurts. The aroma was mostly malt and grains, roasted corn as per at a State Fair and some caramel with hints of spice. The taste was very malt-centered, earthy grain, dry malt, caramel malt and a roasted/toasted character. Towards the end some herbaceous, woody hops kicked in which helped to balance it. The mouthfeel was average, though I think it was a little over-carbonated and under-bodied for the style. Still, it was quite drinkable and a nice offering."
"D- Not a bad Oktoberfest and one that I could definitely drink again."
"D- Nice interpretation of the Octoberfest season. Always a winner here in Boston"
"Drinkability - A very good american octoberfest beer. this one hits the spot"
"This beer is, strange as it seems to say, too smooth. I wish it had a little more life and edge to bring out the spice. The woodiness on the finish alone, however, makes this an interesting beer to try."
"D- All around, a good beer. A fantastic seasonal brew."
"overall, not one of my favorite Octoberfests but still not a bad beer at all, easy to drink, but unremarkable."
"An ok octoberfest, but not exceptional. A sour and somewhat bitter smell to start off, contrary to what others have said. The usual appearance for this style, and the taste improved as it warmed. A little too carbonated, but not a bad beer, although underwhelming from a brewery that uniformly produces a great product."
"This beer pours a coppery color with a small head. There is a slight lacing throughout the beer. There are faint hints of hops with a nice malty backbone. The flavor is full roasted malts with a nice balance. Medium bodied yet flavorful and easy drinking. This is one of the better Octoberfest's that I have tasted so far."
"The aroma is wonderful, spicy, malty, crisp and inviting. Fizzy mouthfeel conveys an extremely crisp and dry brew with a long tartly bitter finish. Complexity of taste lags behind hat lovely aroma, but the overall effect is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Well done."
"Easily drinkable however..."
"Pours a very nice copper-red color, with glints of garnet when the light hits, as well as having some very nice head and good lacing. Nice scent, very malty and almost deep, but not as strong as it could be. It has a very nice deep, earthy, malt flavor, a nice red-type lager with a very nice pilsner-like peppery finish. It goes down fine, but isn't the smoothest of beers. An excellent marzen."
"Overall, I'd say this is a good beer with some nice departures from the typical Octoberfest."
"D: I was really in the mood for a German style Oktoberfest, so this was OK but not great. Solid beer though."
"D: 'Tis the start of the season for Octoberfests and Pumpkins. This is a good standard Octoberfest that is very sessionable. Harpoon did well with the brewing of this beer."
"mouthfeel is of good carbonation and creamy consistancy, extremely sessionable, drinks very nice!!"
"Just finished off a 12 oz bottle and found this beer to be very refreshing. It poured a nice copper color with a perfect head. The lacing lasted throughout the entire glass. Nice aroma with an intial subdued bitterness. Mouthfeel was excellent . All in all, this is a nice beer and makes me want another."
"Drinkability is excellent and this will be in my fridge this winter."
"Poured a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was some toasted caramel malt. Taste was also nice caramel malt with very subdued hops. The beer is quite light crisp and easy-drinking. This is a decent beer but there are better versions of the style out there."
"Easy to drink and makes you want more. As I mentioned, a good Oktoberfest session beer. Worth a try if you have not had this before."
"12 oz. sampled 2 days before the best-by date of 12/13/07. It pours an almost lifeless, crystal-clear dark amber hue, with low carbonation and three fingers of khaki head that leaves nice lacing. Toasted and sweetish malts in the nose, with a dash of hops and bubblegum. On the palate, it's caramel and toasted malts, leafy hops that impart a medium bitterness, and a touch of bubblegum. The body is medium and quite dry, with moderate carbonation and finish. Overall, the beer is too dry, with the hops too prevalent and the malts not sweet enough to make it balanced and, hence, heavily drinkable, the way Octoberfests are supposed to be. Average at best."
"I'm a huge fan of Octoberfests. This is a great example of the sweet, malty, marzens that I look forward to every fall."
"Harpoon Octoberfest pours a clear red/amber with a foamy head that fades to a thin layer. The aroma is malty, with tons of caramel and some fruitiness. The flavor is crisp and malty, with hints of chocolate and a nice toasted character. There is a little bitterness but no real hop flavor or aroma. I'm not always a big fan of Octoberfest beers but I like this one."
"A nice nutty nose that leads into a bitterness that doesn't disappoint, with a sharp finish. Octoberfest has never been my preferred style, but this offering is quite quaffable and fun to try. Good work, overall."
"drinkability - A real good Octoberfest brew, would buy again. If I could find some. Will wait til next year."
"I was surprised to see an Octoberfest beer still on the market close to mid-November. Sam Adams is almost always completely sold out by mid-October. I realized why this beer was still around for so long. The appearance was nice and it had a good smell. However, this beer has very little taste and none of the great malt taste that Octoberfest usually have. The mouthfeel was a little thin for me, and I couldn't finish the beer. The taste was a little like dirt and I think it made me sick."
"Not difficult to drink, just nothing noteworthy about it. Boring. Bland City."
"D: I figured this would be a good nod to the end of October, as I enjoyed this offering from Harpoon a lot around this time last year. While it excels in mouthfeel, its taste is above average, but the balance in the taste works well. I'd say this is a great way to say farewell to the month."
"Pours a dark ruby red color with thick creamy, off white 2 finger head. Smell is of grains, corn, sweet malt, and a little bit of a dried fruit aroma. Taste is sweet malty flavor with some more dried fruits coming through. Strong carbonation on this one makes it a crisp drink. Very nice octoberfest beer."
"Surprising more woody and resinous than expected for an Octoberfest, but still a tasty rich brew. A nice beer to sip on while watching Sunday football."
"I enjoyed this beer. In fact, I like it better than most ""traditional"" oktoberfests. Why do they even bother calling it oktoberfest? Must be so people will buy it during the fall. Who knows? Anyway, nicely done."
"All around, a good beer. A fantastic seasonal brew."
"D - Quite drinkable I'd say, I wish I had purchased more than a single, for I am unsure if I can do this justice by only consuming one."
"Very nice and drinkable. But I don't really know if it fits the style as well as others."
"A beautiful, red/amber color medium, slightly tan head that fades to moderate sized bubbles. Lots of visible carbonation. Good lager-like smell (although I see this is an ale), slightly nutty, subtle all in all. The very first taste was surprisingly of chocolate, caramel and slight roast, but that was quickly replaced by the more typical, but very full and malty deliciousness that was to be expected. A nice balance of malt (that does still predominate) and tasteful hopping that provides a bit of crisp spice. Very clean and drinkable. Occasional candy-sugar-like and green grape and plum notes. Some sulfur in the back of the mouth. The aftertaste is sometimes just on the unpleasant side of bitter with some salt as well. Overall, an artful brew by harpoon."
"This beer is definatly not a traditional oktoberfest which is probably why it's listed at an American Amber/Red ale. Not too bad but nothing really stands out about it. Just kind of an average beer."
"Like a lot of Harpoon beers, this is very drinkable but not outstanding. A solid beer and a decent example of an Americanized Oktoberfest. Worth your time."
" Overall I was very much impressed and thought this one was really fantastic. One of the easiest drinkers I have seen and something that just really grabbed a hold, and would not expect it to. Very refreshing and light, but with enough flavor and spice to keep your interest. Really one of my more favorite of the season and something I will definitely have to turn to again next year. Really nice and very much recommended."
"Overall a very nice Oktoberfest that fits the style well while adding a couple of American tweaks."
"Beautiful appearance....deep red, and perfect for fall. Nice ""creamy"" head....but that's where the ""beauty"" ends. Not a true ""Oktoberfest"" brew...more of a PALE ALE...since it's a tad too hoppy and not malty enough. At first...you get the caramel malts...then ALL HOPS. Not my favorite O-Fest at all...but if you can try one for free as I did....do it. Not recommended for the season though....unless you're a hophead, and love pale ales...then you'll like Harpoon's take on an Oktoberfest. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!! Happy Oktoberfest!!!! (Prost, too!)"
"Drinkability: Not really what I expect from the style, but still a tasty lil' beer none the less."
"D- Impressive. I was not expecting it to be this good. Well worth a try."
"I like the way it looks. Dark carmel color and so on. It smells pretty hoppy. And the taste reflects the same thing. It's pretty hoppy and bitter. This tastes more like an ale or even an IPA than an oktoberfest brew. I expected roasted malt and little hops and got the complete opposite. I like other Oktoberfest beers, such as Sam Adams, much better."
"Nothing spectactular here, but that could be the beauty of Harpoon. Every year, they consistently come out with good seasonals, and the occasional specialty. The Octoberfest pours the usual amber color, and the aroma is very slight. The taste is slightly bitter, but very smooth for an Octoberfest. Still every year when I try my first Octoberfest, I am really only counting down until my first Winter."
"Pours with a slight head that dissipated quickly. Lacing on the sides of the glass remained throughout the serving. Nice reddish-brown translucent color. Strong malty smell with a hint of coffee. Sweet malty taste, tingle on the front of the tongue with a slight alcohol taste at the finish. Very pleasant and enjoyable seasonal brew. Looking forward to Octoberfest at the brewery Columbus Day weekend."
"Overall: An excellent brew, even if it's not a true Oktoberfest (it's an ale, not a lager). The malt and hop characters compliment each other very nicely. I know Harpoon likes to put their own twist on everythign they do, but the traditionalist in me wishes they made this one a lager. Still, I found this one very drinkable and highly recommend it."
"Overall- Much better second time around! Another good Octoberfest beer. Boy its good living on the East Coast when Autumn rolls around."
"This is one drinkable brew and a great fall beer. I can easily see myself kicking back and drinking several of these. I definitely recommend this one as a nice ""Oktoberfest"" or fall beer."
"Got a six-pack of these at Shorline Beverage in Huntington, NY for $7.99 -- a great price for such a tasty beer. The apperance is a dark brown with a slight white, foamy head that stays pretty consistent throughout, leaving slight traces of lacing. The smell is sweet & malty. The taste is also predominantly of malts with a nice little kick to it. You can also sense a touch of barley and cinammon. This is a very easy to drink beer. I think it would be a good choice for those who don't love darker beers, but want to try something different for the fall/winter season. Would definitely purchase these again."
"A really good seasonal even though its not true to the style."
"Lately I have been going a little lager crazy, so this being a pretty new release, figured I should pick some up. Poured in to a Samuel Smith pint glass a copper color, with a large rocky white head. Smells Included chocolate malt, honey, cinnamon, toasted bread, and caramel. Taste had lots of chocolate and caramel, and also maintained that lager flavor in the background. Mouthfeel was on the heavy side, although for this style, was lighter than some of the others I have tasted. With that being said, that might be the reason that this is a pretty drinkable octoberfest. I am a little surprised that the site calls it a red ale, in that it tastes very much like a lager to me. Anyway, this is one of the best seasonal releases from Harpoon in my opinion. I will make a point of getting more of this brew once the weather gets a tad bit colder. Cheers"
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Malty nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor has some sweetness with hoppiness and a lingering hoppy aftertaste. 12oz bottle $1.50 from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH. Best by Dec 6, 2007."
"D - I enjoyed this beer and I intend on enjoying it again real soon."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with a one-finger head. Aroma is mainly thick and malty with a decent sweetness upfront. Taste is really nice, malty and even with some bitterness. Goes down smooth and has a nice smokiness to it. A second sip confirms the same except that the malt is nicely in the background. Definitely a step up from the Sam Adams version in my opinion."
"Not the best Octoberfest Ive had, but decent nonetheless."
"Clear reddened copper with a modest off-white head. Herbal, earthy malt and leafy spiced hop aromas. Peanut shells. Bready, toasted grain flavors and a slight residual sweetness. Leafy hops continue to add a spiciness to the beer. Clean with a very slight hint of licorice in the aftertaste. Medium body, smoothish. Not bad, not great."
"Tastes decent and is highly drinkable."
"D- High. Definite session"
"Pours a clear red amber color with an average white head that dissipated into a small cap. The smell is rather faint, I am picking up some light caramel malt. The taste is of light caramel and toasted malt, bready, followed by a metallic hop bite. This beer is leaning more on the bitter side. The feel has moderate carbonation and body, finishes bitter. The first ""Oktoberfest"" of the season, though not a true Oktoberfest. Not as good as the German counterparts."
"From a bottle. Dark amber almost cherry color. Not a whole lot of aroma but a nice tip to middle to back of tongue taste with very little on the sides. Alluring cardomon and cinnamon taste. Nice session beer. Pretty good for an Octoberfest in August."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, I’ve tried this beer at tastings a couple of times and definitely was not impressed. Having a full bottle certainly makes a difference, but this still isn’t a very good beer."
"12 oz bottle, Nice big head developed with this one and hung on for dear life as it very slowly eased down into its own rocky self. Stark aroma for a fest ... with an almost cherry-laced edge. Flavor is caramel-malty, a bit of a nutty bite and a mellow finish. Good.(#2640 - 1/7/07)"
"Not bad. I actually tried this one on Dec 31st, so I'm wondering what this beer would be like fresher. Recommended."
"Pours a pale orange-amber with very good clarity. Two and a half finger head drops to a dense cap and holds well leaving abundant spotty lacing. Toasty aromas and Munich malt in the nose with a hint of german hops. Toasted pale malt and background nutty flavor like Victory malt followed by a faint Munich sweetness. Semi-dry aftertaste, timid fruitiness and benign german hop flavor. The balance is dead-on, but the total flavor seems alltogether mild. Light body and medium carbonation allow the dextrins to form a pleasent, creamy mouthfeel. Finishes clean with terrific drinkability. Certainly a well-made beer, but a little underwhelming for my tastes."
"This tastes like year-old Samuel Adams Octoberfest and I mean that in a good way. The fresher SA Oct tends to have a slight hop zing which bites into the candy-craver's sweet tooth share of golden electric sugar more evident in the past date bottles. Yeah, I'm recommending that you let your SA Oct expire and sit a year before drinking! Harpoon's Okt is so similar to that aged afforementioned beer that I could probably blind-test and think them the same or at least interchangeable. I think that is a complimentary way of saying A+ Harpooners, A+ to you."
"Deep russet copper body. Clear. Finger of fine grained, lacey, dirty khaki head. Maple syrup sweetness, cookie dough, vegetable stock, and herbal bitterness. Toasted malt up front. Gives way to sweeter, caramel cookie dough and slight vegetal/alcohol notes. Spicy bitterness throughout. Nice balance. Moderate body with a slightly overcarbonated feel. Still, tasty and a nice fall lager."
"Notes: Uneventful, but nonetheless mildly satisfying."
"Pours a nice copper/amber color with a 1"" white head that dissipates to just a coating with some lacing. Smells of malts and a hint of grains. Taste is of toasted malts followed by some spiceness. Finishes with just a hint of hop bitterness. Overall the taste is fairly well balanced. Nice mouthfeel. Light in body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Good drinkability. This is a rather crisp beer that seems more of a late summer beer than an octoberfest (which I know it really isnt). That said Id certainly have another."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable brew. Staple New England seasonal session brew in my mind. Better on tap than in the bottle."
"This is an easy drinking autumn ale. It isn't quite the same as a traditional Oktoberfest, but as an American Autumn Ale it hits the mark and then some. Easy drinking and flavorful."
"The mouthfeel was good, this is a fairly uncomplicated beer with decent drinkability."
"A very nice offering. I wouldlove to enjoy this with some warm pretzels and spicy beer mustard at a fair of festival. Not a marzen, but a very good imitation of the style. Pick some up for a nice fall day."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Sep 22nd, 2006: Clear reddish-brown with a thin off-white head and spotty lacing. Sweet malty aroma. Medium-bodied with a malty character and a touch of hops. The maltiness doesnt hold up very long, and ends up being a little bland. The finish is somewhat dry with a sweet caramel finish. Just OK."
"Drinkability- A very good casual drinking beer. Not too sophisticated, but easily quaffable and enjoyable."
"Not an impressive beer,a little lackluster,not a bad beer,a little flat in the taste department. Wouldn't get exicited about drinking another one."
"Pours a dark copper with a modest head that diminishes quickly to a thin film. Moderately hoppy taste, and well balanced. Finishes with an alcohol presence that seems inappropriate for the low alcohol content. Caramel malt to the nose. Drinkability suffers due to the finish."
"Overall a nice Oktoberfest. Very drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark copper with ample head that drops to half a finger and remains for some time. Lots of lace on the glass. This beer is much more fruity than other oktoberfests with citrus, and apricot flavors. To me this beer tastes almost like it's from Belgium with the fruit flavors. This beer has a lot of body and a faint tingle of carbonation. I really like this one..my favorite oktoberfest I've rated."
"Overall, this beer impressed me."
"Overall, an Oktoberfest beer that is unusual in its darkness, and shows in it bolder than usual flavor. Very much strays far from the German inspiration in its bold flavoring and dark color."
"M&D - a great balance between the hops and roasted maltiness, keeping its smoothness throughout, a great beer, Oktoberfest/Marzen or not"
"This is a pretty nice representation of the style with a nice malted smoothness. A: Deep copperish amber with medium head and carbonation. S: Primarily malts but very mild across the board T: Nice carmelized malts with a touch of honeylike sweetness M: Style appropriate no more, no less D: Very smooth and easy drinking as it should be. Harpoon has offered a nice seasonal to celebrate the harvest. Not my favorite octoberfest, but not bad at all."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium brown with lots of ruby highlites. Creamy 2 finger head with OK longevity and good lace. Lots of malty smells mixed with brown sugar and hints of apple. Malty but not overly. Much fuiter than a Ofest should be. Finishes with a decent amount of hop bitterness that quickly fades. Dry. Not a true Ofest as it is an ale - and it shows. This is not what an Ofest should be. Don't get me wrong as an amber ale it is a very nice beer, but as an Ofest its just too off. They just named it wrong thats all."
"D. Something seems off about the aftertaste, but it comes and goes from sip to sip. It's not my favorite take on the octoberfest, but I'll have a second."
"About a finger of offwhite head with a surprisingly dark red translucent body. Smells very malty. Complex malty taste with some hop presence but not overwelmingly so. Medium body. Very drinkable beer. Better than Boston Beer's version. Excellent beer. Best Octoberfest Ive tried yet!"
"Cheers!"
"This one pours a beautiful translucent mahoghany brown with a inch plus of slight brown head, take a picture and put this on a poster for octoberfest. Very little smell to this one some toastedness to the nose but little else is detectable. Taste is malty with some of the toasted taste coming up in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth at first with a bitterness that finishes the sip. A very easy drinking beer and a great offering of the octoberfest style."
"Poured a dark, rust color with an off-white colored head. Soap like head developed and persisted for a few moments leaving behind plenty of lacing. Aromas of malt, hops, sugar, and apricot seemed to come out nicely. The various flavors worked very well together. In fact, it's as if this beer has taken on characteristics of different styles one after another. Crisp and airy with a light body like a kolsch with a fruity center and a clear taste of alcohol like a maibock with the roasted/sweet flavors and slightly chewy texture of an amber or brown ale. Overall, this was a very good beer and one that I could easily have with a variety of dishes."
"Pours crystal clear amber/orange with a thick yellowish head. Smells distinctly American-hoppy, with a crisp, toasty caramel malt scent beneath. The taste really veers off track; the attack is malty and yeasty, a touch bitter, but also kind of cheesy and metallic. The finish is clean and bitter, but doesn't leave me wanting another sip. Is this a bad batch? If my next 6 pack is better, I'll revise the review."
"12 pack picked up at Shaws market. pours a clear dark brown. Smells a little on the cheap side like a macro lager. Taste is a little bit better, malt, some slight bitter fruit flavor with some mettalic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good. Overall it's allright, expected a bit better, but maybe my taste buds are a bit off. Worth trying at least once."
"Pours dark brown with garnet highlights showing through. Quickly dissipating head that devolves to a ring. Wonderful, malty aroma redolent of dusty, silo-dwelling grains, caramels, metals, and hidden berry fruits. Initial up front sweetness on the palate, with juicy, nearly chewy caramel malts at the mid palate and a big metallic rush at the end. Good carbonation and full mouthfeel. Perfect drinkability for the style and for the season -- robust, but not sludgy. This beer strikes me as a big improvement from Harpoon's past Octoberfest beers. Whether that's true or not, who knows... but this is certainly a worthy American Octoberfest style brew."
"This is a classic easy drinking Octoberfest release."
"Cheers!"
"d - not a lot going on here but it is easily drinkable. i had three of these in a sitting and they seem to get worse the more i had. i'm very disappointed in harpoon's efforts though this is probably the best that i've had by them. the smell is much better than the taste."
"Easily drinkable any time of year. Not ultra-mindblowing, but a nice malty beer with adequate balancing bitterness...no matter what style you want to call it."
"I'm disappointed with the lack of flavor in Harpoon lately and this is no exception. Perhaps they are trying to lighten the taste to broaden their mass appeal. This is a decent Oktoberfest that does nothing extraordinary."
"D: Yeah, I'd have another. It's not as spicy an Oktoberfest as I might ordinarily crave, but it's well put-together."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not what I was expecting. Not sure why the brewers would call this an Oktoberfest Beer."
"A picked up a sixpack from our beer store down the street to celebrate the upcoming festivities. We decided to drink it from our Steins so I am only guessing the appearance was good. From the top of the Stein it appeared a nice dark amber characteristic of a Märzen. Aroma was mostly malt, not much hop, quite bready. The taste is much the same. I am not sure what I was expecting from this brew, but I was pleased with the overall character and drinkability, A solid brew."
"Is it just me, or do Harpoon's standard offerings seem just marginal. An opportunity to shine with an Oktoberfest even falls short. Initially shows promise with a bright golden / orange hue and a standard eggshell white. Though it laces well, the head retention flattens quickly. Nice bready, caramelly aromas with a touch of hop spiciness. Intial flavors start off reaffirming what the nose held, but quickly disolves into a water brew, allowing a serious grainy bite to control. From the midpoint on, grain husk and bite is all I taste and feel. What should be moderately rich, bready, and sweet winds up tasting like wet grain."
"A malt forward oktoberfest. A very dry finish that lasts a good while. Slightly to much carbonation in the mouthfeel. I prefer a Oktoberfest with more RS than this one. This is bone dry and it really hurts the mouthfeel and drinkability for me."
"It's hard to seperate this oktoberfest from others, a nice amber color and full of flavor, by far one of the easiest drinking beers you'll ever have. It wasn't special though, feeling almost like a macro at times. Sitting outside on a nice fall day this beer is an excellent compliment to the chilly but comfortable weather even served ultra-cold."
"Harpoon Oktoberfest is not bad. It is not great either. I feel it comes up a little short in taste, although the taste has the slight, classic, caramel, slight hops in it. Not nearly the worst beer I've ever had, but not the greatest. I definitely will give it another ""wing"" but for now, just an average Marzen."
"Last swigs: Coper penny metalic and flour. Not impressive. Picked this up in a mixed case. Oh well."
"Overall a very smooth and very drinkable session beer. Simple big clean malts with a hop taste and bitterness just big enough to support it. Just a good drinkable beer."
"Fairly typical Octoberfest smell and taste to it - Marzen hops are prevelant with hints of caramel, oatmeal, malt, and a windy fall day all bundled up in the bouquet. Never saw a fall beer like this...categorzied as a red ale but a bit spicier than a typical red and darker and more pronounced than an amber. Mouthfeel could be a bit deeper and less watery, but this is not a bad Octoberfest by any stretch of the imagination. It's fairly typical, solid, and worth a shot. The Flying Fish Octoberfish has more of an identity to it, but this is a textbook example of what an Octoberfest should be. A very smooth aftertaste makes this a slow sipper and a good introduction to this style of beer."
"D: With time, the carbonation decreases but the beer remains crisp-tasting and moderately bodied with a sweet maltiness and moderately bitter hop finish. I find this to be very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not sure I'd buy this again really, especially since it's not really an Oktoberfest (but be sure if it was a red and DID taste a lot like one, that wouldn't be a factor and I'd buy it for the taste, though then again that'd be weird if a red was matching an Oktoberfest, but I digress...). There are many better examples of both a red and an Oktoberfest out there. Don't get me wrong, this could be pretty solid, but for right now the ingredients seem to be there, just not the balance, which certainly needs to be present to make this better."
"It looks nice and red. Much better than average lacing. Aroma is lacking, taste is slightly malty but kind of bland. Mouthfeel is slightly thick, which is nice. I question as to why this is called an Octoberfest, but styled a ""red ale"". It's a decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Medium red with a nice sturdy froth. Sweet bready nose, nearly artificial in its flavor implications. Taste is somewhat redemptive, keeping everything smooth. Malts assert themselves, the sweetness not so pronounced, but still has a lactate aspect to it. Mouthfeel is thin to medium. Drinkable, but not very noticeable in the big scheme."
"All in all, not a bad brew."
"A nice easy drinking Oktoberfest here without any defects. A solid drinking beer that would be welcome here as an everyday beer."
"Pours dark red-brown with a rather short head, quick dissipation, good carbonation, and some lacing. Smell is OK, light malts with light hops. Taste is fuller, consisting of light-medium bready malts, some bitter hops, a bit of fruitness, and hints of spice. Pretty light for an Oktoberfest, but a good drinker nonetheless."
"Actually, one of the better American Amber/Red Ales I've had recently. It stays away from the sickly sweet element that too many in this style succumb to."
"Pours a clear reddish/amber color. Thick off-white foamy head. Good retention, and nice patches of lace left clinging to the sides of the glass. Slightly toasty aroma. Toasty and caramel-like, clean, not much bitterness. Carbonation seemed pretty low. Pretty drinkable. A good ""Octoberfest", even if it is an ale."
"D - Heavy enough for a cool autumn day, yet refreshing enough for a warm September afternoon. Easy drinker all day long."
"Why even call this an Octoberfest? Has none of the characteristics of an Octoberfest. Oh, wait. It is actually an ale. Poured a dirty brown in color and was really thin looking. Flat without any head. Clean malty smell, but not much else going on. Flavor was slightly toasted malts but the flavor was really thin and watery. More of a lackluster ale than an O'fest. Heavy ale feeling and not crisp or the slight dry feeling of most O'fests. Even for its actual style the malts were kind of dull and spread thin. Still it is a very drinkable beer and would probably make a decent session beer, but nothing stands out in this beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lively carbonation that borders on aggressive, but then tames as we go. Very fresh and enjoyable this go-around, I would have no problem putting several of these down. One of the better Octoberfest beers so far this year, try it if you see it on tap."
"Overall = Good drinkability but nothing special or unique here. Feel free to move along."
"Overall pretty good. I could definitely see this as a good ""pitcher"" beer."
"This is an easy-drinking beer - it is hard to have just one. It is tasty and clean, not overpowering. I like the strong malt presence, though I would have preferred a stronger, slightly more interesting aroma."
"Nothing stunning going on here... but pretty approachable all around."
"Taste is fruity, malty, and lightly hoppy- herbally hoppy. A hint of fruity/sweetness in there brings it all to a very tasty balance. Clean in the end- nothing lingers for too long. Mouthfeel is just enough- not too chewy, not to bubbley, perhaps slightly, slightly watery, but otherwise juuust right. Highly drinkable- I would most certainly get this again. A lovely brew."
"Pours a coppery color with a small head. Slight hoppy aroma with a nice malty backbone. The flavor is full of slightly roasted malts with a nice balance. Medium bodied yet flavorful and easy drinking. Slightly bitter finish, but nothing unbearable. A nice O'fest beer that I wouldn't mind drinking anytime."
"Pours a dark orange brown, moderately clear, with not so much head and some lace. Smells earthy, little bit of alcohol in the nose. Taste is bitter, smoky, with some licorice. Good carbonation, nice and balanced, pretty good Oktoberfest, would try again. Thanks sammy."
"Looks dark like an old ale. Small head, some lace. Tongue tingle. Malty aroma. Bitterness balanced by malts. Bittersweet cocoa. Medium body. Spot of roast. Some nuttiness and decent carbonation. Interesting and some thought a marzen. Good transition beer."
"Recomended."
"I kind of liked this!"
"Medium-full bodied, drinkability suffers from the sweetness."
"The mouthfeel was mildly crisp at the start and finish. Medium in body, this is not a bad drinking oktoberfest on a cool fall evening."
"This poured a deep caramel, sudsy type head that didn't retain well, smell was of toasted malt, the taste was very nice, some hop bitterness up front that smoothened into a nice malt aftertaste, has a toasted malt flavor, mouthfeel was crisp, and a bit dry, the drinkability on this I would rate as high, would make a nice session brew, I really liked the fact that it had a bit more hop flavor than most of the other O'fests, that I've tried, not bad at all! and much better than the Sam Adams O'fest, IMHO, cheers!"
"i remember this one being basiclly a bland amber in the past, but after a couple of years away from it, i can say that i was pleasantly surprised by this year's o'fest. it pours a nice crisp amber colour with a moderate head that leaves some residue on the glass. the smell is of malt and a touch of hop, but mostly a plethora of new spices and perhaps some pumpkin that i've never noticed in this brew before. the flavour is much like the smell, with a nice hoppiness starting this one off, then moving into a bit of malt flavour finishing with caramel, spice (cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe?) and that touch of pumpkin. while this is not a true o'fest, it's a nice american version of a fall spiced brew and should at least be given a try."
"It has a light to medium mouthfeel and finishes clean. The Harpoon Oktoberfest is very drinkable and worth a few."
"Drinkability  This is a solid Harpoon beer, as Ive come to expect from them. Its a good beer for a nice fall day."
"Decent for the fall time, worth a try."
"12 ounce bottle sent by yankeeheel. The beer is listed here as an Amber, but the brewery lists it as an O'fest so it is rated as an O'fest. Pkg on 08/04/04. I've had this beer before and it was a much better beer. This one has plenty not going for it...perhaps amber is a better categorization."
"Pours a deep orange/copper hue with a sturdy white head that has some staying power. Initial aroma upon popping the cap is lots and lots of caramel malt, mellowing into a blend of caramel and slightly spicy aromatic hops. Palate reaches out and grabs with its up-front hoppiness. Hops overpower the malt a little bit, but it's still a decent balance, especially on the finish. Nice body - not too thin, not foamy. Could be a decent session beer."
"This is a surprisingly good beer with nice appearance, decent aroma and a great balanced taste. The body is a clear copper with a modest head of off-white foam topping it. The lacing is also modest but consistent down the glass. The aroma gives hints of the caramel malt base and light hops. The flavor is delightfully balaced with the sweetness being perfectly moderated by the hops to finish dry. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable in a session."
"I rather enjoy this beer every time autumn comes around. It has a very rich copper color with a nice off color head when poured into a glass. It has very hoppy notes and a slighlty bitter finish. I find it to be rather drinkable and easy to handle four or five without feeling ten pounds heavier. It goes great with hearty falltime meals."
"Nice straight up amber color with a bit of head on there, not much though and it vanishes quickly. Not a very strong scent to this beer; a little toastyness, a little mat aroma, nothing special. Taste is pretty bland actually for an Octoberfest. I can taste the roasted malt flavor, which is good, but nothing else is really jumping out at me. There is also a weird watery-tin aftertaste that is not very agreeable. Hmmm. This isn't a great beer, but it's not bad. Lots of better Octoberfests out there."
"Amber color with quickly disappating head. Fresh malty aroma, full bodied, rich malty taste with sufficient hops to balance the sweetness. Malty aftertaste, very quaffable Overall a very good Octoberfest but wished it had a little more head retention."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that quickly disappears. Lots of caramel in the aroma, but some sweetness as well. Smooth flavor, with the caramel in there as well as some nice malts. Has a medium mouthfeel and a good finish - plenty of caramel there. Pretty decent representation of the style."
"this beer pours a nice amber color with a finger of head that falls to nothing. The nose is fruity caramel. It almost smells like strawberry to me. The flavor is nice caramel and roasty malts. Its nice and full and well balanced. The mouthfeel is nicely thick. Drinkability is fairly good, with nothing to detract like others I have tried."
"Pours a copper amber with a small off-white head. Malty chew out a sweetness balanced by a crips hop profile. While certain'y quite drinkable and not without its charm, Harpoon is not producing a great amber ale with this brew. It just doesn't scream drink drink drink me which is a quality I think any beer using the term octoberfest should hold."
"clear light brown / amber color and a small frothy head. Bit of freshness to the smell, roasted malt, little hops. roasted malt flavors at the start, slight alcohol bit in the middle, and a mild bitter hop finish. overall: a solid choice for a local october fest beer."
"My only knock on this is that it's not a true Marzen. Other than that it's a pleasant and drinkable ale. A solid Fall seasonal; worth picking up a 12 pack."
"This was my first Octoberfest beer of the season and I was not disappointed, however I predict I will try better this autumn. Nice copper appearance with little carbonation to speak. Rather impressed how smooth this went down (could drink throughout an evening). Not too bitter and nice for a cool evening."
"Sweet caramel malt taste followed by a touch of yeast then followed by a mildy bitter finish that drys futher over a few moments. Nice balance. I like this beer. It goes down easy and is worth seeking out. Not as malty as some I have tried and often prefer but still very good."
"Pours a clear amber with a tanish head that falls to ring of foam. Aroma sweet malt bready with light hops eminating. Taste is sugary sweet some caramel hints along with hops flavor and bitterness that linger along with a sugary coating in my mouth. Mouthfeel is right around medium. Drinkability for me declines while drinking can't get past the too sweet after taste that seems to be building up in my mouth. Doesn't taste clean and refreshing as a Oktoberfest should try it if you like but if you want a real Oktoberfest look elsewhere."
"Why does a homemade pepperoni pizza sound so good right now?"
"Really nice looking brew, deep copper colored body with a creamy cap of head that lasts forever.Very little aroma with only the slightest hint of spicy hop. Flavor is weak. Malt provides a slight toast, bready flavor. Hops give a very light bitterness. Body is solid, almost creamy. Drinkability is high, easy to drink and a good session beer if a bit boring."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent with a fruity yeast finish. It has a nice caramel aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth malty flavor with a slightly dry, yet fruity finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine Octoberfest beer. It has great aroma and flavor. It surpassed my expectations; a good drinker."
"Pours with a moderate head and a ruby/dark amber color. The beer has a slight bitter and sour aroma. The taste is a little on the hoppy side, with hints of chocolate and lots of malt - not too overwhelming, nicely subtle overall. It has almost just the right amount of carbonation, and goes down quite smoothly. Great beer from Harpoon."
"copper to light amber with a good head that settles to a white skim with some lacing. gentle malty aroma with some spicy hops and asubtle hint of some alcohol esters. decent mouthfeel but the level of co2 distracts for it a little, seems to coarse of a carbonation were as the german styles tend to be more finer in the carbonation. still a decent balanced beer and definetly quaffable."
"Pours a sparkly copper with a moderate off-white head. Good retention with a little bit of lacing. Smells slightly caramel. I have to say I really like the taste of this. Malt, malt, and more malt. Lots of brown sugar, nut, and just a hint of daicetyl. The caramel malt really comes through. Mouthfeel is moderate with an easy drinking body. I could make this a ritual all fall long."
"Secondly, this one pours out to a copperish-amber in the glass with a slight head. The aroma is malt and is quite pleasant. The taste is interesting, with more a hop presence than I expected to find in an O'fest. This is a well-crafted beer and one to be enjoyed on a cool afternoon/evening."
"This is really tasty...great balance of malt sweetness and a small hop bitter presence. Very drinkable at 5.5 % ABV and a nice seasonal brew. This is enjoyable right now for a Fall beer at the end of August."
"The taste... well, the maltiness definitely made good on its promise, and the bitterness of the hops was exceptional. It was a little thin, but not too much, still very drinkable."
"It is a nice amber color with a good sized head. The aroma is has some roasted nuts and hops. The body is smooth and has a touch of caramel along with some toasted malts. It finishes clean and pretty crisp for an ale with a balanced bitterness. A good fall session beer."
"an all a well made season darker ale."
"This beer poured an orange/brown color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head was fairly thick and creamy after the pour, it was tan colored by sight. It was not long lasting; it fell to nothing but a ring on the edges. Some lace was present, spotty in areas. The aroma was not all that spectacular, aromas of dark fruits, dark malt, some light hops were noticeable, an earthy presence, roasted malts seemed to dominate, but for some reason at the end of the nose it had a sweet perfumey feel to it. The tastes that flowed over my tongue were of light dark fruits, dark-rich malts, sharp hops, autumn leafs, bready yeast, and a touch of cocoa powder. It finished with an ashy-leafy feel on the pallet. The aftertaste that stayed in my mouth was rather light, it was split with roasted malts and some hops. It was light to medium in body. Not as thick as I would have thought. It was creamy and decent when it came to its blend of flavors. From the first bottle out of the case (3 months ago) (remember I live in PA) to the last one which this review was based on it mellowed and blended in flavors. Enjoyable beer."
"So far, the best of the Oktoberfests I've had tonight, and about all they need at Harpoon are German lessons. Not bad, and I'd probably look for this one next year!"
"Definately not going for anything German. One of my favorite O-fest beers for that very reason."
"This red-tinged deep amber O'Fest with a substantial, if fast fading off-white releases a pleasantly sweet malty aroma. A hint of citrusy hop aroma appears briefly. The full sweet caramel malt is slightly doughy and a bit oily - but not in a bad way. A lime-like bitterness is backed by a light spiciness. Almost buttery in texture, this brew is a fairly accurate representation of the style."
"Deep dark copper pour with a heavy foamy head. The aroma is a bit bready with hings of floral spice and malt. The first sip is very smooth and malty with hints of roasted malt and chocolate. A mellow bitterness flows throughout the brew. Overall tasty and mellow, perfectly balanced for a cool October evening."
"Clear, crisp hops appear in the aromas of this bronze-colored beer. Beind this there is a simple, glucose sweetness reminiscent of cane. On the palate it is even, dry and light to medium-bodied. Bread crust decorated with cool, minty herbs and apple slices define the straightforward, medium-length finish."
"Very neat packaging. A 12oz brown bottle with cream colored label adorned with autumn leaves. Just looked like October. This one poured a deep, deep bronze with a reddish glow. The off-white head settled about 1/4 through the drink but left a nice lace around the glass all the way down. The smell was of light hops with a tinge of fruit (raison?) and the presence of alcohol was detected. The taste was of burnt malt with just enough hops to add a bright touch with an oily flavor. The mouthfeel was strong and powerful and very crisp. This was lighter than I imagined and extremely drinkable. This is a must have seasonal which will stay on the list of keepers. Wish I could taste this on tap!"
"The beer as it sets in my glass unblurred amber to copper color; the head is modest in size, somewhat bubbly in texture and the color a light tan with a sealing sheet of lace. Nose is crisp and clean, slightly sweet with a caramel aroma; start is nicely malted, sweet and the top a bit thin. Finish is prickly in its acidity, nicely hopped and dry, a decent drinking beer and one I enjoy when I can get it."
"Thick nice rich white lasting head.. this settles and lasts as a consistant 1/4 inch white sheen. Burnt orange color with lots of tiny bubble action. Sweetmalt in the nose with hints of toasted roast malt. Medium smoothish mouth feel. It feels rich. Sweet initial taste of rich malt followed by a little burnt popcorn and light metalic hop bitterness taste. Overall quite good and drinkable for the style. I like that there is alot going on on the tongue and it is not just flat sweet and malty."
"Low aroma of malt and caramel. Flavor is mild, but complex. It develops and changes as it rolls through the mouth. Sweet malt at first, with other flavors initially hidden by a tingly mouthfeel. As the beer settles in around the taste buds, hints of pear emerge. Nuances of butterscotch soon develop, and a slight hop bitterness sits in the aftertaste in the back of the mouth. Smooth and delicate flavor, very enjoyable to sip."
"All told, an easy beer to consume, not too complex, certainly will not knock you over with flavor."
"Clear red/brown color with a white sticky head. On-tap at the Harppon Brewery Octoberfest party. Taste is unlike any other Octoberfest beer I've had. Some sweet flavors in the middle are reminiscent of a Marzen, (this is an Ale) but hops are the feature of this one. Toasty malts and a subtle sweetness in the beginning and middle. Leafy hops show up in the late middle and last through the finish. Well balanced, drinkable and tasty and so fresh right from the brewery."
"Tasty and enjoyable, this is always an old standby for the autumn months. Perhaps a little better this year, with cleaner, more pronounced flavors."
"Pors out a dark copper with a reddish tint, medium off white head that thins to a lace. Some floral hop aroma and malt. Tastes of chocolate malt and some floral hops. I enjoyed this brew very much taste good. Easily drinkable and a smooth medium bodied mouth feel. All good here."
"Nah."
"Pours red, with a smallish white head that mosty lasts, leaving good lace. Aroma is toasty malts, with some toffee playing second fiddle in the back. Flavor shows more of the toffee, pretty much balanced with a toasty maltiness, and a slight bit of hops showing up in the end. Medium body, medium carbonation. Slightly better than average, but nothing outstanding."
"pretty deep copper with a meduim white head. dissapates half way down the glass leaving lace most of the way down. bready nutty smell that's very inviting. hints of something fruity or flowery. hops right up front for the taste, giving way to malts. bread, and slightest hint of coffee is present. a little bit of smoke in the aftertaste, a little alcohol is their too. it has a meduim body, with maybe slightly too much carbonation. i don't have much experience with oktoberfest beers, but this is really hitting the spot today, last day of september. it's got some balls to it, i'll be getting more."
"Pours a deep copper color with not much of a head to speak of,a very light aroma of some toasted malt but not much there in my mind.Taste is slightly doughy and roasty but seemed a little dry for my liking would have liked some more caramel malt flavor.Not awe-inspiring by any means but a drinkable beer but wont ever seek this one out for sure."
"Poured a nice redish amber, slight head. Good malt taste, although a little faint. Good ""session"" beer, went down easy enough while watching the game. Over all, nothing very impressive, and really nothing to complain about. A good beer, that could be improved on."
"This was a bit of a disappointing beer. Poured a bright copper color with a large tan head that dissolved away quickly. Looked nice. Pretty bland aroma  really nothing there, like water. The body was very thin and the beer lacked substance. There was a lingering dry bitterness. Not that much for an octoberfest and one dimensional, but in its defense, it was easy to drink."
"This a very dark for a marzen, almost brown. Very thick and hearty. This beer is very drinkable, very tasty with a noticably pleasant mouthfeel. Except for the wonderful (and great) color, it is very true to the style. The hops are noticable but very well balanced, though I personally prefer marzens with a dry hopped aftertaste. Last week I had numous Grey Lodge patrons tell me how much they loved this beer."
"Pours a beautiful copper ruby tone with a nice brown ruby tan head wih nice even lacing. Slight brown sugar tint with a caramel edge and full malty tone, a bit light. Great nutty edge with malty backbone of toasted syrupy tones. Easily a session brew with a medium sized body and smooth drinkability not overly complex in any way but then again neither should be the style. This has been on of the better Oktoberfest styles I've had."
"The bitterness lingers after the swallow and is appealing. A very competent Oktoberfest."
"Notes: A good beer, although no O'fest. Very enjoyable, and worth a shot. Just keep an open mind about things."
"Notes: A great ""American"" Octoberfest brew, and that seems to be what they intended to create. In all aspects for me it is one hell of a fall seasonal extremely drinkable, quite tasty and a clean beer all around. A top pick for me amongst the other American Octoberfest brews."
"Drinkabilty: Very easy on the palate. Just a bit of lingering bitterness is nice. Do I hear session beer?"
"Not a bad brew, but different. Smell was vague, but appearance was a nice caramel color with a nice head and lace. Taste was semi-sweet with some distinct alcohol overtones (odd for a brew witha 5.5ABV). Mouthfeel was medium, with a light astringent quality at the end. Not bad on the drinkability scale. Not my top brew, but not bad either."
"Appearance: Pours a garnet-red color with a decent, firm, creamy, sticky, off-white head that has fairly good retention, after that it dies down and leaves a nice foamy collar throughout the glass. On the nose the aroma of sweet toasted malts, grains, caramel, and a mild hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied; with decent carbonation and the mouth feel is mostly smooth. In the flavor the taste of caramel & toasted malts, grains, hints of some fruitiness, and a nice mild hop bitterness; well balanced. Overall a tasty brew, and enjoyable"
"Clear, deep copper/russet in color with a firm bone-white head that drops shortly but maintains a decent collar and light surface covering throughout the glass. The aroma is fairly rich with gently sweet and lightly toasted malts (Vienna & Munich) and a mild hoppiness. Very nice. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation that's gently zesty and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is malty upfront (bready and toasty), reveals some fruitiness, and then some hop flavor (grassy, resiny) and a brisk hop bitterness that lingers in a long dry finish. Well-balanced with the rich maltiness giving way to an increasing perception of hop bitterness (and flavor) throughout the glass, giving it an exceptional drinkability. Two to three of these could easily be enjoyed in one evening. Very well done with a strong nod to the Vienna-style; but also very American in it's hoppiness."
"A good session beer (but not really to style as an Octoberfest)."
"Nice amber color- looks very malty, and it is.  I could definetely smell the sweetness upfront.  A well- balanced brew- obviously on the sweeter side, but with some bitterenss to keep it refreshing on the palate.  A little bit of a chewy mouthfeel, nice body.  Not a distinguishing Octoberfest, but very nice indeed.  (Also, the discription of the beer up on BA, says the style is a red ale- I believe this beer is really a lager?)"
"Pours a clear dark amber with decent tan head tha subsides quickly and leaves some minimal lace down the glass.  Biscuity maltiness in the nose with some slight caramel tones as well as a light hoppiness that is barely detectable.  Smooth maltiness opens the brew up but is then followed by a rough transition into a tangy, grapefruity hoppiness that doesn't seem to fit in well in the other flavors flavors of the brew.  Smooth and slightly cloying which brings down the mouthfeel.  The medium body of the brew and decent biscuity malt flavors make it fairly drinkable but I would rather go with some of the german ofests or the Brooklyn."
"Pours with a beautiful rocky off-white head over rich deep amber liquid with some red highlights. There's lots of inviting sweet maltiness in the nose, along with toasted grain notes also. Taste is a nice bittersweet balance on the palate. Finishes up malty-sweet, drying slightly. A nice aftertaste lingers in the mouth. Hats off to Harpoon for this very easy to drink take on the O-Fest style."
"A copper/red body is topped by a big beige head of micro-bubbles. Strong fruity nose with a straight malt chaser. Malty taste well balanced by a nice but not overpowering hop presence. Not too sweet, not too bitter.  Not a traditional marzen, but as a Oktoberfest inspired ale, quite pleasing."
"Happy Halloween!"
"Very smooth & malty, with just a bit of hop bitterness and a very good finishing hop spiciness. A tasty interpretation. The finish is a good malt/hop balance with a slight, pleasing lingering bitterness. A nice Fall seasonal, would be great to kick back on a Sunday with a twelve pack of these and toss a football around at halftime."
"Although not a Marzen, this is a very good fall beer, somewhere in the realm of red/pale ale. Well-retained head, red color, strong hop presence in aroma. Sweet malts veer towards Oktoberfest style but this is a bit different. Good hop presence (mildly spicy, floral attack) gives indication towards a pale ale style. Watery, smooth mouthfeel indicative of Irish red. A nice beer, refreshing and autumnal, almost smoky finish. No fest, but a fine fall seasonal. Harpoon's best beer even if it ain't what it says it is."
"Beautiful deep copper color.  Malty, hops present but not overpowering.  Thin mouthfeel.  Not a bad beer, but nothing special. After finishing a 12 pack, it's unlikely I'd buy it again since I was already getting bored with it.  Just nothing special about it."
"315"
"odd beer being an oktoberfest style ale. it has an awful lot of hops for and oktober, but it is not too much. i would just have to say that this is a very unique beer. the flavor and carbonation are intense following after the harpoon ipa i have sampled. strange and not something i would get again, but an alright beer"
"Brewed in the ale style with a lot of malty goodness to make it passable as an Oktoberfest. Harpoon typical hops are noticeable but not overpowering - a good thing. Not the easiest to drink since the sweetness kind of takes over, but still better than Sammy."
"Having this in a proper Harpoon dimpled litre stein glass at the brewery is a real treat ... One of my favourite local Octoberfest beers on draught. Although, this is not a lager, thus not a true Marzen/Oktoberfest. It's a nice Amber Ale for a festive occassion."
"Usually one of my favorites, I thought this years was a tad thin, although still delicious."
"Looks great with its chunky head and deep orange color.  Nice clarity of its slightly sweet, grainy malt flavors, with a pretty clean mouthfeel.  It has some alcohol towards the finish, but the aftertaste is nice and toasty.  Hops give a slight herbal quality that blends in well with the grainy flavors."
"i can't wait for next fall."
