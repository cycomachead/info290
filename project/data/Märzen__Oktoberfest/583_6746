The smell has orange hop notes and yeasty, bready malt notes that mix well with the hops. The beer taste is a bit hoppier than I'm used to for oktoberfests. The beer has a bready and malt taste that is topped off by a very orange and tangy hop taste at the end. The mouthfeel is very smooth with carbonation but not usually as thick as the better oktoberfests. Overall, an okay but there are better ones.","HattedClassic","Sep 22, 2014"

3.25,-9.2,,,,,,"Poured a decent 1/2"" head which went away fast and left minimal lacing. First aroma is of sweet malt and honey. Color is a cloudy orange-tan. First taste is crisp with a well balanced blend of hops, yeast, malt and a touch of caramel. Flavor overall seems well balanced and maintains its crispness throughout. About half way through, there is a touch of bitterness aftertatste but it is desirable and makes you want to drink more. Overall, a good beer with lots of flavor that still seems to remain light and crisp and most definitely is a beer to drink anytime, any season, anywhere !!!!!","hophugger","Sep 08, 2014"

The slant toward a bit fuller toasting than is typical for the style really keeps the sugars at bay without turning the beer into a hop-forward brew. While there really isn't anything particularly distinctive, it's the balance and toasting that make this the kind of beer that's a comfortable go-to within the style.","BuckeyeSlim","0"

As the head slowly subsides, there's a tremendous amount of lacing that left down the entirety of the glass. The smell of this bier - well it reminds me of fall crammed into a glass. But since that's a rather subjective statement, the actual aroma is slightly sweet with notes of tasted and grainy malts. Both the taste and the drink of the bier is a wonderful balance between the malted caramel grains and bitterness from the German hop varieties. Overall, this may be one of the most quintessential autumnal biers for Saint Louis locals. Thanks to the relatively moderate ABV (5.5%), you can feel comfortable having a few of these during dinner or while watching a game.","jmvecchio1","Oct 06, 2011"

Somewhat of a murky, cloudy appearance that could be chill haze, with very little in the way of head or head retention. Caramel sweet aroma with hints of sourdough bread underneath. Light carbonation and a relatively thin mouthfeel. Caramel sweet aroma also translates over to the finish. Some might complain that the body's a little thin on this but I think it works fine in the parameters of the beer and the style in which it is working. There's also a surprising amount of bitterness to be found in the middle of this beer, though the huge caramel finish overpowers that relatively quickly. Lemony citrus hops also help to cut the sweetness of the finish. This beer is all about the malt profile - which is good because it's very decent and enjoyable.

It smells like bready and sweet malt, and also a little bit of caramel. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of a bit of an earthy taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it wouldn't be a bad choice for a session beer.

Active carbonation bubbles rush to the surface, making this beer appear quite lively. The nose is of roasted malt, fresh bread and sweet caramel corn. The palate is, thankfully, not over sweet. A nice roasty malt flavor is dominent, but the somewhat yeasty, bready character is assertive. Very mild hop balance, but enough to temper the sweetness sufficiently. Mouthfeel is medium witha nice carbonation ""bite."" Finish is smooth enough, and only somewhat dry. Maybe not my very favorite Oktoberfest for the year, but it is among the better examples I've had for 2007. I'd say maybe only Millstream is better, over all, of the 4-5 O-Fests I've tried so far.

Under the sweetness is a light toastyness. It just doesn't seem to be coming together as well as it could to me. The sweetness doesn't work for me in this one. Tasting it, there is a definite bready quality that dominates with a little caramel sweetness, moving to a more mild toastyness and a little grainyness to boot. It finishes with a little grassyness from noble hoping. Mouthfeel is moderate with a nice moderate carbonation of small bubbles. It is a bit drying on the finish, which I find detracting to the experience. This one is okay. The sweetness just isn't working for me, and the drying quality is not pleasing.

Taste is also light, more malt and caramelly sweetness, bready flavors, fades quickly into a slightly dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with medium carbonation, goes down easy. Drinkability is good, would make a decent session beer, lacking in complexity and overall characteristics.
