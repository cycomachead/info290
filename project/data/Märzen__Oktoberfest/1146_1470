Very little smell, but I have a bit of a cold, so it may be better than I can tell at the moment:  Cherries, sweet, malt.  Disappointed in the taste.  Some caramel and spices on the front, and what tastes like cherry with a hint of soap on the finish.  That finish lingers in the back of front of the throat.  Not pleasant.

3.9,6.6,,,,,,"All in all I thought this was a good beer and good example of an American version of a Marzen, it took pretty much all the aspects that you would find in a traditional example of the style and they amplified them which ended up working well and I think the bolder flavors suit the American palate a little more.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, fairly clean, not filling at all and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these especially on a nice fall night sitting by the bonfire.  What I liked the most about this beer was that had it pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, they were just bolder than normal.  What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, it was just a little too high for the style.  I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a bolder Oktoberfest.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the style or mild malty beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, I came into this beers expecting a bolder version of a traditional Marzen and that's exactly what I got.  It's not my favorite beer from Goose Island, but it's up there was on the better American Marzens I've had.  Good job guys, this beer embodies the spirit of a German Oktoberfest with a bold American twist, I enjoyed it, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Sep 17, 2014"

Nose is subtle and not too breaddy but has plenty of caramel and sweetness on it.  Smells a bit floral and sugary.  Taste is smooth and sweet caramel, not really deeply breaddy. Body is medium and a bit slick on the palate.  A little grass brings this one home pretty sweet and with a substantial bitterness form hops.  Breaddiness starts to emerge as the beer warms with a little bread crust that ups my opinion of it considerably.","utopiajane","Sep 15, 2014"

Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt notes with moderate yeast ester balance; and great strength.

Big khaki tan head, with fine speckled lacing dispersed as the head dwindles. Aroma has biscuit malts, clean caramel, light and rather airy compared to some of the more robust Oktoberfests out there. Crushing waves of interplay bread grains, caramel, hints of bright ripened fruit with a nutty signature Americanized O fest tone. Not much in the way of hops here a bit of minimal earthiness with some herbal characters come through with a very calm bitterness, barely detectable on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated, very easy to drink yet equally unimpressive and standout in this style. I would say if I had ten of this seasons Oktoberfests that this version is ranking 6th or 7th in my minds ideal version of the style.","WVbeergeek","Sep 14, 2013"

Oh well, anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset bronze-amber topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises toffee, light toast, a hint of honey, and mild grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the toasted toffee and grass combining very well, an HR manager's teamwork-exercise wet dream. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. Overall, a pretty nice American O-Fest, one of the better such examples I've had in a while.","TMoney2591","Aug 27, 2013"

Rich flavor here, lots of bread, hints of fruit and a nice touch of caramel to lighten it up. Different and more complex then I would have thought.

The aroma of the beer is moderate-high malty sweet, with hints of spicy, toasted grains. Very little hop aroma is detected. The taste of the beer is wonderful. The sweet malt is moderate-high in perception with a little spicyness and a moderate hop bitterness, the initially sweet brew leaves my mouth fairly dry and wanting more. The carbonation is moderate with a medium body. Overall I was quite impressed with this Oktoberfest. I was very impressed with the consistency of every category. The appearance and taste were truly great. The sweetness is balanced enough by the hop bitterness and the finish of the beer is perhaps its best quality.

These go right into the flavor. Initial flavorful amber malt, caramel, light toffee, nuttiness, bready, yeasty flavors. Later flavors of over-sparged grain begin to rear under the lightening body. Though clean textured and flavored, the graininess becomes a bid distracting, but expected for the style. Alcohols and earthy hops decorate the finish.

If the base flavor, the same as the smell, wasn't so dull, this would be a great beer. Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty dry.

3.8,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Clear, ruby-bronze in hue with a coppery influence as well. Steady animation found its way to the off-white head. At the apex the foam was one finger in height but it quickly faded to a soapy cap. Subsequent lacing was nonexistent but a tight cap formed (from nowhere it seemed) and lasted the entire consumption. It is a handsome beer. The nose is clean; the malt offers a toasty caramel aroma. Whiffs of tobacco leaf as well. I could detect some grain and even some grassy hops at the back. The nose is typical for the style; aside form the tobacco, which adds an interesting dimension. Potency is modest. Mildly inviting, which means it smells good but it doesnÂt pump my nag. This might be the driest O-fest IÂve ever tasted. There isnÂt much sweetness; the caramel taste is secondary and not very rich. Lordy! The tobacco leaf taste is strong and mighty dry. After the tobacco is a very lovely taste of biscuits. Hops add minimal bitterness but some grassy flavors find my tongue. The finish is much better than the start and the most complex moments are when the middle turns to the end, very good. Dried tobacco leafs and biscuits go good together, who knew? I think some sweetness would have improved this beer, I canÂt complain Âas isÂ but this O-fest might be truly amazing if the sweetness was kicked-in. Medium in body but too thin, more malt please. Dry, leafy aftertaste, hell there is even some cocoa mixed in. It is easy to drink and just as enjoyable. I purchased a six-pack in Omaha. IÂll enjoy every bottle, maybe at once with such a low abv.

Nice, dark color, decent head retention and lacing. I knocked it down a notch in drinkability simply because it's so malty that I don't know that I'd want this as a session beer, and it may overpower milder food pairings (bring on the brats and stinky sauerkraut though!), but I don't necessarily view this as a bad thing...the drinkability of Bud Light is off the charts because it's basically water, right?

Mildly toasty, cracker like Vienna malt with stately hints of medium lovibond caramel comprise the aroma, and are accompanied by an understated herbal, tracely spicy hop nose. Clean, functional continental malt character in aroma. Dilatory wash of sugary caramel upfront in flavor lingers a bit too long. After a deliberation, caramel malt is contrasted by a lightly drying combination of simple, buttery cracker and mild, floral tinged hop bitterness. Malt character deepens agreeably late, and approaches that of burnt toffee cut with carob. Lightly bodied, with a mouthfeel that's lean, yet with a diluted syrup like viscosity. Finishes sweetly herbal and with a balmy nuttiness, with fleeting hints toasted, oily pecan. Almost a good Marzen. It lacks sufficient malt heft, and showcases a simple, caramel malt driven profile overall. Regardless, it's a clean, drinkable brew, without outright flaw.

Fairly distinct bitterness is flavor but has a short finish.  Now I know why others are writing a tastey beer but not necessarily a good marzen.  I agree.
