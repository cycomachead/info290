3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"For bells this isn't all that impressive. It has a proper copper orange color, clear, and holding an inch of white suds for a few minutes before settling. Aroma is sweet and rich, autumnal, bigger in grain character than most of these, sweeter too, but seems alright. Minimally hoppy in nose and taste, these could be increased a little for balance and depth. Toffee and lager yeast in the flavor, long flavor too, but lacking nuance. Because it's a little bolder than others, it's hard to drink a whole lot of it, but maybe that's part of its charm. More filling and hearty for later fall, makes sense, but this is nowhere near as compelling as other bells brews.","StonedTrippin","Oct 27, 2014"

This beer was repeatable, easy to drink and priced right -- three important characteristics for a beer calling itself ""Oktoberfest."" It's definitely not in the upper ranks of Märzens -- more around the middle, I'd say, but for spending a nice fall afternoon watching baseball, football or whatever your fall sports weakness is, you could do a lot worse.","paulginva","Mar 05, 2012"

3.89,8.4,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Average looking for the style, a red-orange with a tiny head. Aroma is sweet, nutty caramel malts and grains. Solid. The taste is also good - props go out to Bells for a domestic Oktoberfest that's not too sweet. Instead, it goes down not tasting too much like anything at first, a bit of graininess but not too much else. Some toastiness comes in for the finish too. Drinkability and mouthfeel are both about what you'd expect for the style, a bit more carbonation wouldn't hurt though. Overall, it could be better, but kicks the pants off of most of the domestic O-Fests I've had this year. I probably like the Heavy Seas Marzen a bit more, but this is still good.","shand","Nov 01, 2011"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, floral, subtle spice, and nutmeg. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, spice, wheat, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this one really 'popped' for me in the nose nor the flavor. The flavors I did get were blended quite nicely, but this would have been much better with some added complexity going on.

The smell was big on sweet/caramel malt and some grain. Taste was better than the scent would lead. The malt and grain is prsent, but there are hints of fruit.

The carbonation is thin but not lacking sharpness. The flavor is rich, malty, with hints of vanilla and honey. This is good stuff. It goes down very smoothly and with the relatively low ABV for the style you can enjoy a few of these. Excellent effort from Bell's.

While the GL was a fairly faithful, if boring, representation of the style, I'm not sure what the aim was with this. Appearance was a golden copper color with a quickly fading foamy off white head and little lacing. Aroma had the typical toasted malt notes, but very little caramel or hops, or basically any depth at all. Flavor was also lacking malt depth and was oddly tangy and sweet and overly carbonated for the style. Bread and toasted malts dominate with some occasional strong grain presence as well, and the finish has some earthy hops and grains. Mouthfeel is medium thick with strong, fine carbonation. Not a bad beer, but missing a lot for the style, and particularly woeful when compared to the Great Lakes version.","yourefragile","Sep 08, 2010"

I think I was able to pick out the scent of a bit of citrus from the hops as well as honey. The taste is quite malty as an Oktoberfest should be. There is a definite undercurrent of noble hops which give it quite a traditional German Oktoberfest flavor. I might be biased but I tend to go for the sweeter American style (personal preference, say what you will). The slight taste of citrus from the hops eventually builds upon the tongue to almost be acidic to the point where it might be mistaken for bitterness in the beer. This creates a rather earthy Oktoberfest. As it should be this beer is extraordinarily smooth and appropriately lightly carbonated. Overall a definite recommendation of a German style Oktoberfest.

Cracked grain and bread strikes the nose at first scent, with a touch of grass and peppery fragrances come out at the end. The bread comes out in the flavor by attaching itself to the palate. That flavor stays there and lingers long after each taste. There is a feint bit of bitterness hits the back of the palate with grassy and grapefruit flavors. The feel is light to medium bodied with a thinning to a more watery consistency. An ever present feel carbonation is there from front to back.

Super smooth zesty maltiness that is a lot like a buttered bisciut with drizzled honey. A nutty metalic feel sticks to the top of the mouth.

The toasted character isn't quite as prominent as it was on the nose, but it's there with the usual suspects (biscuit, caramel and yeasty doughiness). Carbonation lends a bit of a fizzy attribute to this medium bodied lager. Not a particularily bold Ofest, but enjoyable nonetheless.","Bighuge","Beers"

3.43,-4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Not my favorite example of the style out there, but this is not a bad beer by any means. A bit too bready at times, but on the whole an entirely drinkable beer. I love Bell's, and they do some excellent beers, so it's nice to see them trying out new seasonal stuff.","Atlas1","Aug 30, 2007"
3.06,-14.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Its a nice light amber copper color with a two finger head that dissipated quickly. Crystal clear. The beer's aroma is exceedingly bready and slightly yeasty. The slight fruit aromas I get are of the German hops, but the aroma of them isn't strong. The taste starts off with the bready yeast flavor but turns into sweet malts, toasty and slightly solvently. The mouth feel is light and crisp up front. It smooths out as it moves along, and has a slight residual bitterness right all the way through to the finish. All in all, an Oktoberfest, a nice plate of light cheddar maybe, or some bavarian pretzels would be a nice compliment.","quasimoto","Aug 30, 2007"

3.92,9.2,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Amber/caramel clear with sheet of white on top. Easy, steamy pale malt aromas scented with moist vegetation and cereal. Workable, watery texture punctuated with fizz and oily bitterness that provide definition for apple, straw and green plum tartness. Overall, a drinker. I want just a little more texture and viscosity.","putnam","Aug 27, 2007"
3.63,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear as day copper with a fluffy head that dies quick. Smells of bread and grain. Tastes as it smells, bread, grain, some very mild sweetness and tiny bite at the finish. Feels medium to light in the mouth with good carbonation. Goes down very easy. A tasty Octoberfest brew but nothing that stands out.","franksnbeans","Aug 27, 2007"
3.61,0.6,4,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a golden color with a bubbly white head that lingers and slowly fades away. Smell is grains, rice, and a maltiness. Taste is Sweet and smooth with some spices. Limited carbonation on this one makes for a crisp smooth drink. Nice offering, and look forward to drinking the rest.","genog","Aug 27, 2007"
3.79,5.6,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Bell's Oktoberfest was a pretty good representation of the style. Didn't have that high, craggy head that the great German Ofests do, but had some nice malts, could've used a few more, very smooth with a slight hoppy kickback. Highly drinkable on a fall night. Some slight caramel flavoring and a nice orangish/brown color. An overall decent interpretation of an Oktoberfest.","bigdeuce","Aug 26, 2007"

3.8,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this was a very respectable octoberfest. It seemed a bit disappointing at first but it opened up towards the end. It definitely strays a bit from the authentic German style though.","xav33","Dec 20, 2006"

3.62,0.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Originally reviewed on December 9, 2006. On tap at the Downtowner Lounge - Houghton, MI. This keg has probably been on for a good while, as this isnt the type of bar where people would drink this beer. I was quite glad to still find this on tap, it seems to be a rather rare Bells draft, despite having been released throughout the state. Lemon fringed with an orange core, creamy froth of off-white. Light wispy aroma of creamy malts and light oatiness. A touch of graininess. Sweet sugary, lightly estered malt, with some barnyard oat qualities and a touch of hay. Not as much of the heavy Munich malt character as I expected from the style. Backend presents a slightly sourish, lemon tang and a nip of aged yeast. I can tell this keg has been on for a while, but it doesnt seem to detract. The smack is one of the more profound of any beer Ive had for a good while. A long lingering, clean mint and lemon bite, that hangs out along with a jumble of barnyard, sweet malt esters and clear mid-roasted unfermented crystal character. An interesting rendition, in my opinion. Im sure why everyone else has this beer so down. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Nicely refreshing and light.","CharlesDarwin","Nov 25, 2006"

4.02,12,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"12 oz pour. From notes. The beer was a mild golden color with a small head that fell to a small island over top of the brew. Clarity was fantastic and a mild carbonation was present cascading towards the surface. Good looking, but maybe a touch light in color. Aroma was grainy, fairly light with a mild bready sweetness in the background. Flavor was very bready with mild sweetness and toastyness. The grainyness was pretty full in there, and a mild bitterness hit on the finish. I thought it was tasty. Mouthfeel was a solid moderate with a light carbonation that gives the brew the feel of more thickness than it truly had. Overall, I liked the brew. It was a little more grainy than I would have liked and the nose was lighter than expected, but it was an enjoyable beer.","kmpitz2","Oct 08, 2006"

3.51,-2.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Appearance is slightly clouded copper with a large off white head leaves a collar of lace dwindles down and leaves behind specks of lacing. Aroma has fruity caramel sweet bready mix from the malt profile with a slight spicy character with bitey, grassy noble hop presence, seems a bit muted even after warming the brew for a little in my hands. Taste has a light noticeable alcohol note with creamy light fruty subtle caramel malt flow light bitterness with a quality overal mix of flavors finishes like a light herbal tea. My excitement exceeded the actual experience of trying this brew, I'm a pretty much overall Bell's fan but this one left me wanting a bit more flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation somewhat creamy textured with mild prickly bubbles hitting the palate. Drinkability is pretty good overall but due to the somewhat lack of flavor I'd much rather go with a Penn or Great Lakes Octoberfest brew. Nice to see a cloudy fest and I will drink it again, but I was under wowed by it.","WVbeergeek","Oct 05, 2006"

3.03,-15.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"I had this beer today over dinner with the family. I have been drinking a lot of Oktoberfest of late and looked forward to this offering from Bells. I had a pint on tap, it was a pleasing amber with a thin head with slight lacing. The flavor of the beer was a bit mild and lacking for my taste. I have been drinking German Oktoberfests and am unsure if i am spoiled or what. It is a good enough beer but there are better choices out there.","adammills","Beers"
3.77,5,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This was the only thing on tap I had not had at the exchequer pub in down town, so I tried it. I have to admit I wasnt able to spend as much time on this one as I do with most. Simply because I was with company, however I did make some quick mental notes during the course of my meal. It had a decent head not too wild. Looked like a lager with a slightly more caramely tarnished color. Smell was subtle hints of spice, hay maybe and some sweet malt. Taste was decent, some caramel, a little hops, kind malt and spice. Again I didnt get to spend too much time with this, but over all I thought it was a decent seasonal beer. Mostly likely I would not buy a bottle until I've had a couple more Oktoberfests for referance, but if it was at a fest and cheep I might go for it right away.","mmcave","0"
3.58,-0.3,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Moderate mouth with just enough carbonation. Its drinkable and could make for a good dinner beer, but it is a rather standard Okto fest and I wouldn't go to any great lengths to seek this one.","ypsifly","Sep 26, 2006"
3.76,4.7,4,3,4,4,4,"This pours a hazy amber color, with a substantial yellowish white head and leaves substantial lacing on the glass. The smell is the least pleasant thing about this beer-there is a distinct sulfery odor. Thankfully, there is no trace of that in the taste. There is a distinctly grassy flavor, along with a creamy caramel blast at the finish. The mouthfeel is nicely rich and the only thing hampering the drinkability is the aforementioned smell. A very nice Octoberfest.","edbeered","Sep 20, 2006"

4.1,14.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. Solid gold orange clear body with a small, but persistent, off-white head. Nice fall weather for drinking this baby outside I might add. Cookie dough malt nose mixes with grassy vegetables and spicy hops. Bursting with juicy cookie malt sweetishness. Peppery spicy hop bitterness fills in the finish. Creamy, moderate body that goes down too easily.","alexgash","Beers"
4.03,12.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice burnt orange and light coppery color with a small off white head. Aroma is a lightly sweet maltiness mixed with cooked grains, there is also a little earthy-grassiness. Taste follows the aroma with a gentle malty sweetness that is smooth on the palette and is followed by a nice and light peppery-spicey hoppiness. The beer is very creamy and soft and I found the sweetness to be light and not overpowering and well balanced by the subtle spice and dryness from the hops. I could easily see myself sessioning this and was wishing Bell's had to go containers available as I left.","hoppymeal","0"
