"A truly exceptional beer here"
""

"Overall, this was a really good beer. It wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. But this is my first authentically German Oktoberfest, so perhaps us Americans are just doing it wrong :)"
"Overall: Definitely not the best by Weihenstephaner, but not a bad beer either. A good switch from the darker Märzen beers and a refreshing beer that is easy to go down in quantity."
"O: seems a little light, both in color and flavor;"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: easy to drink and a nice full flavor oktoberfest that will satisfy anyone."

"Overall a very tasty beer that might not be a Marzen but I could drink this all day. I bought a single but I should have sprung for a six pack. Hard to believe this is 5.8%abv."

"Clear gold color with a frothy white head. Low retention with some lacing. Toasted malt aroma. Very light bodied for an Oktoberfest and soft on the palate but with all the other characteristics I love about the style including a dry finish. A very enjoyable, unique take on the style that almost seems like a cross between a Helles and an Oktoberfest. I would definitely buy this again."
""
"Clear light amber (golden) pour. Very nice head, lacing and retention. Light, slightly sweet nose, with notes of pear over biscuit. Almost light medium body with a touch of smoothness. Above average carbonation that provides a nice effervescence throughout. The flavor profile is laid back, but has a very nice balance and a bit of complexity. It begins with pear and a touch of lemon, then flows into a rather toasty biscuit light sweetness. The middle effervesces into a slight bitterness over a receding biscuit. The finish approaches crisp and has a noble hop flavor note over a slightly dry character. A solid Oktoberfest, but not world class such as Great Lakes, Hacker-Pschorr or Ayinger."
""
""
"Lightish body and effervescence. I would call this more of a thirst quencher beer than a ""sit back and relax with it"" brew.  Too bad, I really like the brewery and all the other beers I've of theirs I've had but this one is weak."

"Overall drink this if you like pale lagers, German or Czech Pilsners. It's just spicier and lightly more malty than a standard lager."
""
""
""
""
"I know that it’s authentic but his does not taste special.  Rather, it tastes like just another lager to me."

"O:  I’m sure its one of the standards for the style, but not as highly rated as others in the style.  I’m enjoying it, and will more so with some Oktoberfest fare in a couple minutes.    Bought and drank in Thailand, Sept 29th, 2014."
""
"O: this is lighter than i expected, but a nice change of pace from my usual selections. Not my favorite, but an easy sipper and, hey, it's fall. Prost."
"The taste is mildly sweet, a tad fruity and bready with just the lightest touch of hops. This is one of the better Marzen-style beers that I've had--it isn't too cloying, and the flavors are well-balanced. I could certainly drink this all day."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good German lager. Different than the typical Marzen with more of a spicy hop presence like a Pilsener."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served on tap at a Chester NJ Octoberfest. A lighter bodied Marzen from the get go. Pale yellow color, some amber, white foam. Nose and malty are all malt. Lightly sweet, small hap back. Smooth easy drinker, solid."
""
""
""
"Not baaaad"
""
"O:  Color isn't as dark as some but it doesn't seem to be outside the color scope if you do a google image search for marzen.  clean flavors with some complexity going on and no faults"
""
""
"Everything you want in an oktoberfest, but not more. Nice malt character, with some lemon and toasted grains. It wasn't too sweet, that was nice. Not a whole lot to talk about here."
""
""
""
""
"A bit more of a floral/hoppy aroma and taste than I was expecting from an Oktoberfest.  A bit surprising.  Clean and crisp, not too heavy, but I would have a hard time distinguishing from a pilsner or helles."
"The…best…beer…i…have …ever…had"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light medium in body. Medium in carbonation. Between the wheats and the lagers this is a very clean clean flavor with no strong lingering presence. Very nice and palate quenching."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer, but I didn't think it was a good example of a Marzen and when it comes down to it I find this to be more Helles Lager like than anything, I didn't mind the taste and aroma, but it just wasn't what I look for in the style.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little clean, crisp, not filling at all and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, but it isn't something I would drink if I wanted a good Marzen.  What I like the most about this beer was how unique it was, the perfume and herbal aspect was unique and while it was a little weird at first I found myself liking it the more I drank it.  What I liked the least about this beer was that it wasn't true to style, it's just not what I expect from the style and I'm pretty sure there would be no way i would guess this is a Marzen if I tried it blind.  I might buy this beer again, but not if I wanted a straight up Marzen.  I wouldn't turn it down though.  I think this is worth giving a try, but I wouldn't recommend it as a good and true to style Marzen.  All in all I was a little confused by this beer, I didn't mind it, it's just not really what I was expecting, but I think this might be a nice change of pace if I was drinking traditional Marzens all day.  This isn't my favorite beer from this brewery or my favorite Marzen, but I think it's decent in it's own way.  I like the uniqueness of this beer, but it's just not what I think of as a Marzen, I appreciate the effort and I didn't expect a brewery that is this so old and traditional to make such a different take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is just excellent. I may have to compare all other Oktoberfest beers to this one. Then again, this may be a bit too pilsner-like for most."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"brassy gold with a one finger white head. Decent lacing.  and like most German made Maerzens a spicy noble hoppiness is front and center but here it is broad and deep and harmoniously integrated into the aroma. The taste is restrained, balanced and delicious. The mouthfeel is good. Overall, this may be the best of the German Oktoberfest beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's not the best thing Weihenstephaner has brewed but it's very drinkable.  To me it's more of a Munich Hell than Oktoberfest, but that's OK - it's a very good Hell, about on par with  a Spaten Lager.  It goes very good with food, particularly Bratwurst, which puts it up a notch in my book."
""
"Nothing outstanding, but a nice refreshing beer that finishes on a more bitter note than a bunch of lagers."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, straw color.  5/4 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of slight citrus, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and euro yeast.  Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of citrus, hint of hop, and euro yeast.  Overall, great appearance, good aroma, decent feel, decent body, and decent blend."

"O: 4 This is very good and refreshing beer. I was thinking it would be a bit darker with more body and roasted malt flavors (like a transition from typical summer beers to dark, winter beers). This reminds me more of a really good pilsner with more interesting flavors and aromas. Still a good beer, just different than I was expecting and hoping for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a straw-yellow in color that is much lighter in color than other Oktoberfest brews I have had with a good 4-finger foamy white head that had lots of lacing when sipped! Very surprised at both actually. Lots going on with the aroma and is of grains, yeast with a hint of citrus. Even more so going on with the taste that has a hint of honey, herbal and bread (yeast). Very tasty and goes down very easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all! Medium bodied as well as medium carbonation. Fantastic brew and the BEST Oktoberfest style beer to date!"
""
""
"Pours a clear light gold with a very short-lived fizzy white head. A little bit a head lasts on the surface, aided by a steady carbonation stream. The aroma is light but distinct: grassy, biscuits, earthy, with the hops dominating. The aroma is in lock-step but a bit more malt-forward, with the hops coming in towards the finish. The body is lighter, but not watery and there's a slight bit of carbonation, but barely noticeable. A really good lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-  Its a good beer, but I expect/prefer oktoberfests to be maltier.  While, this has some malt presence, its simply too light and unassertive.  Seems like they were going for a balanced approach, which they succeeded in, but some styles are better a little unbalanced (eg. ipas).  I would drink this again, but I would not purchase this again. However, I am glad I tried it as it shows the the apparently broad range in which oktoberfests can be made. (80/100)"
""
""
"Looks, smells and tastes like a pilsner. Still a pretty good beer, but not what I expect in an Oktoberfest."

"330 ml bottle into dimpled mug, bottled on 4/16/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale Oktoberfest style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"overall the beer is very clean and quite good, a little lighter than most Marzen style beers I've had, but very good. A lot better than many of the overly sweet American versions that I've had."

"Pours out a lightly chill hazed gold with a bone white head.  Aroma is all bready malt.  Such a clean nose.  Flavor is fresh baguette with honey with a finish of floral, grassy hops.  A little sweet, but drying in the finish.  Mouthfeel is right on: smooth and moderate to full.  Awesome Ofest."
""
"O: Pretty tasty, but not a lot of the typical characteristics that I expect in the style.  I enjoyed it quite a bit though.  3.75"
""
""
"A very light colored Octoberfest beer.  Delicious sweet malt forward profile in the nose and flavor, medium body and very drinkable."
"It's not a stellar oktoberfest. Look for a local brew you will be happier."

""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not what I was expecting from an O-Fest after only drinking Sam Adams O-Fest prior. Anyway, it looks, tastes, and feels much more like a traditional pilsner, which isn't bad, just lacking the heavier caramel malt qualities I'm used to. Expectations aside, this is a very tasty, excellent beer."

"Weihenstephaner Oktoberfestbier is a solid marzen, however to me it does not measure up to their Hefeweissbier or Korbinian."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this brewer and expected much, much more from this beer. It's light, not a lot of flavor. Quaffable for sitting at a beer table during Oktoberfest but this would not be my first choice of brew."

"Overall: This beer is a bit off for being a Marzen style beer. The beer has some funk to it. Also the beer is supposed to be absent of hop like flavors and it beer has some present."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Easily the lightest example of a Marzen I have encountered, almost a borderline Helles. I just barely see it in the grain profile, but just missing that slight tip towards a nuttier/richer malt region which I love so much about this style."
"Overall: Damn good Oktoberfest beer, but can you expect anything else from a German brewery, if not possibly THE German brewery? Good strong flavors of hops and malt, nicely balanced into an extremely good beer."
""
"Overall: A great beer, but not very oktoberfest like. Much paler and closer to a helles than marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Middling beer and certainly not even close to the best Weihestephan has to offer... but not bad."
""
""
""
"An unpleasant experience overall."
""
"o: not my favorite from Weihenstephaner. its good, but the flavors initially fight for room in your mouth before they all blend together. its good, but not my favorite representation of the style. still an enjoyable drinker though, and easy to put back"
""
"overall a superb oktoberfest. loved it."
"O: Enjoyable beer for the style. It looks a bit like a typical Oktoberfest, but it is still quite flavorful"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is a mild nose of wet straw with bits of honey whiffs about; the taste is subtly sweet and a bit grassy with some shy candy corn motes. No hoppiness, no maltiness; a quenching and crisp mouthfeel that leaves the palate refreshed with a pleasant aftertaste. Es ist gut, nicht wahr?"

"O: clean flavored lager, nice malty grain flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent Oktoberfest: well balanced, fruit, zesty, and perfect for the Autumn."
""
""
"RJT"
""
"Overall different than what I'm used to for the style. More along the lines of a Euro pale lager than a marzen. Even so this doesn't do anything new or exciting...except that they were probably doing this decades, if not centuries, before anyone else. Not my cup of tea but good overall"
""
""
"O: Probably the lightest O-Fest I've had (in terms of color, at least) but it's definitely still solid and easy to quaff. Great price as always. Definitely worth trying"
""
""
""
"O- I'm adjusting to the popularity of the lighter o'fests. They actually seem more in tune with what was served in the Munich tents some years ago when I attended. Great compliment to an early fall day. Refreshing in the warm sun. Robust enough to stand up to the cool of the evening. Would buy again in quantity."
""
"Overall: Super bummed by the skunkyness. Seriously, why does this still happen? I understand using a certain bottle locally... (I guess) but if you are importing it, use a dark bottle. Come on! I bet fresh, this is a great beer, however, after a couple of months in a light bottle, being imported overseas, just slightly above average. Meh."
""
"Overall, this beer drinks more like a very good pilsner, and offers a nice reprieve from the more conventional Oktoberfest style beers this time of year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I expected a little more from my favorite German brewery but this is in no way a bad Oktoberfest. I'd still prefer hacker pschorr's, Great Lakes, and victory's offerings"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer, but not what I think of when I look for a marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - decent Märzen, and unique enough to stand apart from the crowd.  Not my favorite, but I'll usually get a bottle for Oktoberfest if I see it."
""
""
""
"Overall Kind of like a different take on the Helles lager but not even close to what I expected. Pity since I love this brewery."
""
" O: Not my favorite Marzen, but certainly not a bad one either. B-"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a thin marzen style brew, maybe a slightly stronger lager with a touch of vienna; i prefer the maltier or hoppier types."
"Grain with a solid quilt of whites, a little light colored for a marzen. Smells like a good pilsner: grain, corn, sweet pils malt, just a hint of hop. I like the nose very much, but not under this style. Flavor is bitter, some bits of corn and grain, a little bit of anise almost in the back. Light bodied with higher carb and a dry finish with a rubbing tongue feel. This is the least impressive of Weihenstephan's beers. The beer is misrepresentative of marzen IMO, but maybe in Munchen they play by different rules...?..."
""
""
"All around tasty, refreshing and easy-drinking lager."
"Overall: Not a huge fan of the style, so based on style, I'd say this is slightly above average. Honestly I'd probably rather have something like a Sam Adams Oktoberfest which is tough to say about a beer made by Weihenstephaner."
"O- This is a very refreshing and surprising Oktoberfest beer from Germany- lighter in color, bigger hop character, and more pilsner malt character than I usually associate with the style. I really enjoyed and it it quite complex."
"Overall: A very decent brew, but very different from the Americanized caramel bombs."
"O: Crisp clean and on point. A great beer for early autumn that gives a nice mild bitterness. The spice profile is various and elegant while the yeast doesn't overpower but nestles nicely in the background."
""
""
"This is a hefty Marzen. Various spices mixed in with light spicy hops to balance the honey sweetness. Not quite what you typically look for style wise but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
"This is not a Marzen. This is a Munich Helles Lager in the Fest Bier style. Oktoberfest beer comes in variety styles including Marzen and Helles. This beer is one of the best I've had in Munich and consistently delivers in the bottle at home. There is Weihenstephaner and there is everything else. Prost!"
""
"Atmosphere is excellent. Great head, a constant foam blanket, and a light yet persistent beer ring. Nose is bready with bitter and sweet fruit notes and some honey. Nicely balanced yeasty pungent and sweet characteristics, accentuated with some sweet and fruit. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
""
"It may not be the most diverse offering from Weihenstephan, but it's nevertheless highly drinkable and extremely easy to sit with for hours on end. After an intense week with sours and bitter ales, this is refreshing and highly welcoming. I want more American brewers to deliver beers like this in their Oktoberfest offerings - hoppy, yes, but also fruity, well carbonated, and juicy. Definitely might pick this up again at the crazily low price."
""
"Summary - This stuff is terrific. Definitely one of the better Oktoberfest beers I've ever had. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"A little disappointing in the aroma and flavor levels, but ultimately a really nice beer and six packs are super cheap."

"O -- Excellent for a warmer fall day. Love a German 'Fest in the fall. Prost!"
"B"
""
""
""
""
"Pretty damn hoppy for a style that emphasizes a lack of hops. Good malt character and tasty overall but not what you expect in a Marzen."
"O - This beer is light enough to drink all day yet complex enough to keep you interested. The appearance and taste of the beer is very appealing yet the aroma leaves a bit to be desired."
""
""
"OI - A classic example of the modern ""Wiesn"" style oktoberfestbier. A great beer for exploring continental malts, German melanoidins, and Noble hop characters."
""
""
"Overall: As stated above, probably one of my favorite Oktoberfest beers - only because I tend to favor pale lagers over amber/Vienna-style lagers. Crisp, refreshing, and with a slightly higher alcohol content. Reminds me more of a Dortmunder-style of strong pale lager."
"If they called this a pilsner, it would be a pretty good one."
""

"On the whole, a great beer. I would drink this year round."

"Overall, this was a very refreshing beer. So sublime, I'm going to get it in my fridge soon."

"Overall –Apple is the main thing I relate this beer to. I respect Weihenstephaner very much, and if I had only one of their brews to choose from, I’d reach for their classic hefeweizen, but this is a respectable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a nice wheat beer, but not very heavy for a fest beer. It had a clean and crisp scent and taste and body. It had a mellow finish, so it was easy to drink. Great for the first day of Oktoberfest, but not very unique from Weihenstephan's Hefeweissbier."
"Wonder if this is getting a little past its prime, but still a nice Oktoberfest."
"Overall: a nice lager / pilsener with a few different malts and hops than one would normally see. A nice one for every now and then, I think - say, once a year in October :)"

""
"O/D-Works well enough. Not my favorite style by any means but it works well enough."
""
"An average beer, about what I've come to expect from the majority of märzen or Oktoberfest beers I try. This one is easily the worst of the five Weihenstephaner beers I have tried to date, it doesn't bring much to the table and is pretty standard for the style."
""
""
""
"Not what I expected in am oktoberfest. Lacks malt complexity, and there's an off flavor. The more I taste and smell it, the more I think it's a yeast issue."
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Fairly sessionable"
"O/D - A nice, really easy drinking and flavourful Weihenstephaner beer. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in drinkability and smoothness."
""
""
"This hits the spot for a Thanksgiving afternoon sort of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hmmmm i had to check the bottle label to make sure i was drinking a maerzen... great lager but off style, but thats ok not all maerzens have to taste the same. Poured a dark golden. Like a pilsner. Not typical pils or maerzens aomas and flavors maybe a combo of the two... never the less its a well done lager... crisp flavorful and refreshing... i would drink again and i cant beleive this is the first time ive had this..."
""
"This beer is really similar to a good pilsner. Not what I was expecting in an Oktoberfest, but a good beer nonetheless."
""
"Overall I was only mildly impressed with this beer. I guess I had super high expectations considering their hefeweisbeir is one of my favorites."
""
"Overall --- from the Weihenstephaner offerings, I am usually impressed… but not with this one. It seems merely average. This beer is indeed unique, it looks, smells and tastes as if it was a baby/offspring of Paulaner’s Oktoberfest and their Wiesn. It is worth a taste, but not sure if I would recommend."
""
"Overall: I was expecting more maltiness, nutty notes and color to the beer. This beet is more along the lines of a pilsner or later. A bit dissapointkng and think that things may have been bottles incorrectly at the brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it would make for a world class pilsner, but it's fairly lacking for an Oktoberfest. Not sure how they call it a festbier because it just isn't. But nonetheless, it's not a bad tasting beer, just nothing like I was expecting. I'm glad I bought a six pack because it'll make for good drinking, but I wouldn't call it a marzen."
"Overall too easy to drink at 6 percent"
""
""
""
""
"O:I really shouldn't complain about how it isn't very marzen-y, because I'd have NO trouble drinking a pitcher of this in a biergarten. Actually, my only complaint is that I'm not sure I'd pay $12/6 pack for it again, given its nature."
""
"O: Different than what I was expecting, which put me off at first, but this is actually a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm going to have to buy more of this stuff. It's a nice, easy-drinking fest beer that has no objectionable qualities whatsoever. I would like a darker, amber color and stronger malt flavor, but this is still very nice."
""
"Poured from bottle to glass."
""
""
""
"Not a great Marzen/Oktoberfest, I have definitely had much better, and this one is overpriced as well. But nonetheless enjoyable, and good to have a lot of, overall."
""
""
"Hard to rate this one, as it is not what I usually find in a Marzen, but still a well brewed, enjoyable lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"But, what ever. It won't stop me from drinking more thats for sure."
""
"O: Not too bad, maybe not your more traditional German style Oktoberfest but it stays relatively clean and doesn't go overboard with the sugary malt sweetness."
"O: Doesn't really go down well. It starts off fine but is dissapointing overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Again ""Deutsches bier geht mit Deutsche küche", but aside from the norm I can see this brew complementing dainty desserts, such as; praline pear Danish, Dutch Moorkoppen, petit four, and pain au chocolat would all go well (although it could appear odd having a masskrug of Marzen along with a tiny dessert)."
"O - Not my favorite of the style, which was a slight bummer because this is a brewery I tend to like. Oh well."
""
""
"It's medium to light in body and extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"5.8% ABV printed on the bottle and ""4202"" is stamped on the bottom of the label - probably some way to cross reference to a bottling date, but nothing obvious."
""
"Straw yellow in color with good clarity. Poured with a billowy white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Toasted and biscuit malty aromas with hints of earthy grass and hay. Medium bodied with crisp tangy carbonation and a dry finish. Sweet biscuit flavors up front followed by earthy grain and a spicy, tangy, bitter hop bite. Finishes dryly with an herbal, lemony bitter aftertaste. This tastes more like a pilsner than a marzen to me. It was good. But wasn’t the toasted, sweet malty oktoberfest that I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This Oktoberfest really tastes like an overly sweet pilsner. The toffee and caramel normally present in this style isn't really here and the sweetness limits drinkability; at least in my case. Not a beer I will seek out again."
""
"O - While nothing near the paramount status of the Vitus, Hefe, Dunkel Hefe ad Korbinian, this is a solid brew. For a light lager this is damn good."

"Overall a tasty Märzen. A little lighter in both color and body than other Märzens I've tried, but enjoyable nonetheless."

""
""
"O - Above average Oktoberfest, it's nice to get a Bavarian take since it is a German style. I feel this is how Oktoberfests should be done, too many festbiers are way too malt heavy."
""
"O: no flaws is this session beer; the finish is the strong point."
""
""
"Overall - A solid, drinkable lager. A beer I might never buy again, but I certainly wouldn't turn my nose up at it."
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator Pokal. Pours a nice golden color with a thick white head that lasts well, leaving behind lacing. Sweet malty wheat aroma. Pleasant wheat and light malt flavor. A slight off-flavor bitterness in the middle, wheat malt finish. Some banana and clove hints. Very refreshing to drink. Carbonation lively throughout. More hefeweizen character than other marzens. It could use a bit more sweetness for perfection. I still like this a lot, like all the Weihenstephan beers."

"O: This is delicious and goes down easily and quickly."
""
"Mouthfeel is very light, crisp and refreshing, with a light body, mild carbonation and a light feel overall that leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. Not a Märzen or Oktoberfest beer to me, but still damn easy to drink and a great session beer."

""
""
"O - Overall, an OK beer. It may be that I've drinking beers with bigger flavors lately, but this didn't real do it for me. I'll give it another shot next year."
""
"Poured a nicely straw/yellow with a thin white head, head does not last. There is no lacing to this at all. Sweet bready malt aroma. Tastes more like a Pils than a Marzen, very crisp and clean with mild hops. I can easily drink several of these at a sitting!"

"O: A very solid Oktoberfest. Great session beer, flavorful and easy to drink. Makes ""light"" beer cool."
"It's a pretty nice Maibock - solid, clean, but perhaps a little too weak in flavor."
"O: Drinkable but sweet to the point that I couldn't imagine having more than 1-2 in a sitting. Not what I think of when I think of a marzen, but that's probably because everything else I've had under the title has been American made. If there's lots of different Weihenstephaner beers on your local liquor store's shelves, go for their hefeweissbier instead."
"Wheat beers are this brewery's specialty. Being from Germany, I'm sure they had to create an Oktoberfest style beer for Oktoberfest in Munich. However, this is outside their comfort zone, and it shows in this beer. While it is a fine brew and one I've had a few times this year and would definitely buy again, it is not quite in the top tier of Oktoberfests ot there."
"O- overall a disappointing take on the style. More of a mediocre wheat beer than a true marzen. At least the bottle wasn't green..."
"Overall I like this but it is quite malty strong jarring, if I could describe it that way. I do really like it though and I could have this anytime. I think this might be a malt lovers dream!"
"Overall- I found Weihenstephaner's Fest to be disappointing. For such a well known brand that I usually enjoy, this was a let down. Maybe I got an old bottle, I hope that is the case."
"A very delightful festbier. Typical flavors of this style, lighter than I expected but completely drinkable. Got some nice orange peel notes with a solid sweet maltiness. Nose is slightly bready. Perfect bitterness. A very good festbier from the oldest brewery in the world. You should snag a 6er if you find it."
"This is awful yellow and ""light"" loooking for a Marzen. Aroma is a full, ""wet"" maltiness that reminds me of their Helles. The taste is very smooth at first, with bready malts guiding the brew down my throat. Then, some sharp carbonation hits along with a bit of sweetness to round things off. The mouthfeel is good, that carbonation hit really sneaks up on you! The drinkability is very good. Overall, a solid brew, but not really up to what I was expecting from a Marzen from this great brewery."
"Overall, this is nowhere near as fun to drink as most Oktoberfest beers. Perhaps I have a stale bottle, but I bought it just a week after the real Oktoberfest ended from a reputable dealer. This is labeled ""festbier," but it isn't much of a celebration to drink."
"Not much going on at first. Golden color with little action when its poured. But then you smell it and its subtle yet super inviting. Noble hops up front, and then a lot of sweet mild malts. Then you drink, and say ""ahhh"" because it's refreshing as hell. Crisp, clean beer with a great bitterness resembling a czech pilsner, with a little more sweetness from the malt. Not as malty as most fest beers, but who cares, its delicious, and they're the oldest brewery in the world. They tell you what a fest beer is!"
"Honey gold color with slight amber hue, frothy , hungy fresh looking head. The aroma and taste are exactly in line with each other. Very straightforward bready and biscuity with a mild hop presence that makes it so drinkable. All the big corporate brewers would be really well served to follow these guys as they still seem to make beers the way they're supposed to be made. This is the German way."
"O: Very drinkable, traditional, German Festbier. Could easily drink a few."
"Overall: Uniquely light for the style."
"Bready malts, noble, flowery hops and a scent that screams ""German lager"". In the taste, a mix of pale and munich malts lending toffee and buttered biscuit like flavor. Herbal, leafy hops and lager yeast giving a very clean impression. Bitterness is mild, for a more or less even balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied, thin and carbonation is slight. Makes for an easy drinking beer, this whole review and drinking Festbier in it's entirety took 6 minutes. Overall, a nice Oktoberfest, of the lighter variety which I prefer, the overdone caramel sweet bombs of the U.S. need a gut check once in a while."
"Very unnoticeable carbonation but the malt creates a full and comfortable mouth feel."
"Clear straw color with a frothy little head that sticks to the side of the glass very nicely. Light malt and fruity scents. A pleasant light flowery hop ending."
"O - ...I'll assume that it's a pioneer of the style just because Weihenstephaner brews it and German breweries know all concerning lagers, especially Marzens. In my opinion however... I'm kind of surprised. It's good, but it doesn't blow my hair back. It might be because I've had too many other Marzens that were all pretty similar whereas this is the only one that has really strayed away from what an Octoberfest ""is"" to me."
"Not an Oktoberfest, but of the lighter ""festbier"" type. Still, this remains delicious and highly drinkable, one that I hadn't had before, but will definitely add to my list to pick up next season. Note that I've had this on tap and in bottles, and thus far prefer the on-tap."
"Not sure if I have ever had a beer as straightforward as this! No frills, grainy lager with a moderate hop presence. As a festbier it works well, it is easily drinkable and utterly poundable with a fair amount of alcohol to it. I'd be happy to order a liter or two with a plate of brats...sounds like heaven to me, although I think I like the Hofbrau, Paulaner or even Hiener Brau offerings better, surprisingly."
"O - I really really really enjoy this beer. I have been trying to get my hand on as many of this style as I can this year and this one has been by far my favorite. This beer is incredibly addicting. I would suggest picking up a couple of six packs and enjoying throughout gameday for a perfect combination of the season."
"O: A good beer, though a bit atypical for the style. It seems more pilsner-like than a Marzen. Still, it's a tasty, clean beer."
"Reviewed on: 10-17-2009 20:11:24"
"Crisp, lightly toasted grains up front. Becomes sweeter with notes of cookie dough malts, honey buns, and a little caramel. Cooked veggies come in near the finish, along with a sprinkling of spicy, peppery noble hop bitterness. Lingering honey, wheat grains, and vegetables. Moderate body with a slightly oily feel. A nice marzen, though not my favorite (of the style nor of this brewery's beers). A good choice for those that like a lighter ofest."
"A decent off-dry Oktoberfest, but the German-ness is slightly in question - it's more on the American side of hop indulgence."
"Ofest style, not marzen. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a fluffy white head, settles to a half inch leaving streaks of lace on the glass. Smell: mild sweetness, floral and a little soapy, spicy, dried corn husk. Taste: grassy, quite spicy, salty twangy wheat bite, sweet graininess, with white grape juice in the finish. Crisp and well carbonated. 6231!"
"O: Not the traditional oktoberfest that I'm used to, but it's a tasty beer that can be had in large quantities."
"O: another good product from Bayerische Weihenstephan, this is an excellent beer to enjoy at Oktoberfest. Prost!"
"It’s not bad, and it’s got some character to it, but there isn’t much going on here for me."
"O-I was excited when I found the Weihenstephan Oktoberfest. This might be my favorite brewery out of Germany, and its always exciting to try something new from them. For this reason, I had very high expectations. Those expectations were met. This is the best example of the style that I have ever had. It has got to be one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. the tastes on this one are great but subtle. I only bought one bottle, I might have to go out and find a lot more."
"I'm a big fan of this beer. The best German beer I've had in a while."
"O - more of the wiesn style festbier than what most think of as the traditional Oktoberfest maltier beers made here in the states."
"Yet another O-Fest finally getting sampled this year. Took me long enough... It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light white bread, light lemon zest, flowers, wheat, very light green apple, and grass. It's light and airy, but still pretty pleasant. The taste holds notes of spicy rye, light caramel, greens, flowers, grass, orange zest, wheat, and light black pepper. I'm actually surprised the malts came through as well and as strongly as they did here, given the lightness of the look and smell... The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Overall, a bit of a contradictory O-Fest here, but one that generally succeeds in pleasing."
"O - A decent mild, summer beer."
"Pale malts, apple like cider taste, sweetness, and a tea like bitterness out back. Its interesting for sure. To consider this a Marzen is bold. It is clean, light & crisp - so that works with the flavors, but not a marzen in my book."
"O- I have to say I'm not terribly familiar with ""Festbiers"" but this didn't quite seem like an Oktoberfest beer to me. Still a very drinkable beer and one I wouldn't shy away from trying again."
"Overall / Drinkability: Not bad. I could have another one with the right meal, and indeed, I think that's the strength of this beer - meant to have a lot of it with food at an Oktoberfest event. By itself it's just okay - nothing terribly special. Nice hop character but I miss the deeper malt profile I get with some US Marzens. But with the right food I think this beer would shine. In this case, the right food was not Italian. Not sure I'll go out of my way to buy it again, but if I see it with German Food on tap I might try it again."
"oktoberfest session during sunday football. pours a golden hue into my mug, small foamy head with little retention. sweet malty nose. Sweet on the palate with noble hops trying their best to balance. very drinkable on a rainy september day. paired well with my wife's chili."
"Overall- I really enjoyed it, did just what I wanted it to do. Cheers!"
"O - A very traditional beer for the style and quite obvious this brewery hasn't change it in forever. Reminds me of the changing of the seasons with the lighter color but slight dark flavors/aromas."
"D/O Drinkability is high (as per the style) but overall this is a thin example of the style. I believe that I would much rather have a Victory Festbier. 3.0"
"O: Nice light refreshing beer."
"O: An easy to drink beer with a lot of balance. Almost a Festbier-lite if you ask me. Nice...but I'll stick with more malt forward versions like GL or SA."
"O: Easy drinking, good Marzen. Not a big flavor profile, but very well balanced."
"Taste-Cracker and pilsner malt, subtle Saaz hop presence leading to a dry finish. Crisp and very drinkable, but more like a pilsner than an Oktoberfest. Not bad just the same."
"O: I'm not crazy about this beer. Maybe my expectations are skewed/Americanized, but I always took Oktoberfest beers to be richer than this. Just feel like I'm drinking a well-balanced, easy-drinking pilsner, which is fine, but not what I signed on for."
"O: a very poundable beer, could probably drink several liters of this."
"It pours a very light and watery bright, very clean gold in color with a slight white head. It smells of pale German malts, biscuit malts, grains, and has a very subtle bitter hop finish. The flavors are very bland for the style. It is light malts, light honey sweetness, with a slight bitter hop finish. It features the usual flavors but it's really, really light and subtle. For being fresh, this drinks in a really dull manner. It's also very, very watery. I can see this being popular during a festival but alone this beer is pretty weak. It's definitely not on par with Weihenstephaner's other offerings."
"Pours a very clear, light, golden-yellow. A white head soon rings. Lots of slow carbonation. Smell is mineral, cracker, and biscuit. Some crisp noble hop asserts itself more on the taste. A good peppery aftertaste, this brew is balanced moreso on the hop side, imo. Good, clean mouthfeel. All in all, a decent drinker, but nothing spectacular from the okoberfest style."
"This is a pale gold beer with not much head at all. There is a lot of carbonation to the body. The aroma is very nice with a lot of earthy grain malt like smells. The flavor to me was more like a pilsner than a marzen. It was grainy like with a lot of earth after tones. The body was like a marzen just because felt more full than a pils."
"a pretty good rendering in the more golden fruit colored fest beers. this is a bottle from last year but it has maintained. golden on the the very light orange yellow. nose is pollen mineral a bit of freshness from hopping. palate is chalk dry. to the point that it feels like sodium. salty hints. sweet overtone that somehow blend into the works. nice carbonation. munich and honey."
"O - Not the best example of the style."
"Cheers"
"I'm not a big fan of most Pilsners, and even though this brew is classified as a Marzen I still felt like this was more like a Pils. Big time grassy notes on the palette which is not my favorite thing in beer. The more I drank of this brew, the worse it got. Normally when a good beer gets warmer the flavors get better. This one wasn't like that. I was very happy once I finished this because I was afraid that I wasn't going to."
"This drinks like a nice summery beer, but if I want a marzen I'll reach for Ayinger or something else."
"Pour yields a golden-hued brew that is mostly transparent. The head is white and sticks around for just a bit before falling down to a thin cap. Slight amount of lacing. The nose is mostly comprised of bready malts with a touch of caramel and some very, very light hopping. The flavor is again white-bread crust with a bit of sweetness and caramel flavoring. Medium body with good carbonation. Drinks pretty well and goes down smoothly even though nothing about it is all that remarkable, especially considering its source."
"On tap from a restaurant in Arlington, VA and from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is golden yellow with medium small white head. Nicely carbonated. Aroma gives off sweet malts. Taste is incredible malt, honey, grain. A slight bit of roast. Mild spicy hops and roast keep this balanced but this is a malt forward beer. Palate is malty sweet and crisp as can be. Hops bitterness balanced perfectly with the hints of roast malt to keep this from being cloying. Overall an excellent beer. This isnt what everyone considers an Oktoberfest/Marzen, but more a slightly stronger, malty'er version of a helles with the slightest hint of roast... a Festbier or Wiesen."
"Carbonation is solid. Feel is light bodied, with a slightly grainy character. Needs a bit more residual sweetness for the style, but I like it for what it is."
"This is not up to the usual very high standards of this brewery, and couldn't hold up against a mediocre Czech lager."
"This is up there with the easiest of beers to drink. Not my favorite from Weihenstephaner, but I can see why they made this their 'fest beer'. These will knock back easily, should lead to a good night. Prost!"
"Mouthfeel is light with a clean and smooth presence. Overall, this is another top notch beer from one of the world's best."
"Overall, a B-."
"My pour resulted in a thick, foamy cap of two fingers' worth of bone-white head with excellent retention. Nose had a pleasant maltiness, not too sweet, more subtle than I expected, frankly. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant lager sweetness accompanied by a grassy hoppiness. Finish was likewise pleasantly sweet, very clean in its aftertaste."
"D: This is not an O-fest. The blue & white Bavarian chevrons, product placement with other o-fests, time of year, etc - all had me thinking that this would be malty & rich. This is a bigger than everyday beer, but not a Marzen. Weihenstephaner's original is a helles, and this seems to be a bigger, ""fest"" version. A sort of extra special helles, or Helles Bock, or Maibock. A very nice beer. And you have got to like the partying nuns on the six pack - not your run of the mill marketing."
"D: Highly drinkable. It would be very easy to throw back a few pints. Whether or not it's true to style, it's still a tasty offering from one of the best breweries in Germany."
"A very easy to drink beer and a fine example of the style, the 5.8% being just about perfect for the body and depth this beer has."
"overall, would i buy this again? no, id buy their original because it was very similar"
"Weihenstephaner festbier is a pretty good beer, and you'll have no problem handling the pint-sized bottles it comes in."
"D: Not bad, not great, but slightly below what i'd expect coming out of the Weihenstephaner brand."
"D: The beer is highly drinkable. I could easily have a few of these in a single sitting."
"D: Meh."
"My journey through Weihenstephaner seems to be the reverse of most people. I scored their Original lower than most, and now I'm scoring their Festbier higher than their Original. Seems a step up in every category - brighter color, better head, crisper and more complex taste and with a little hint of citrus."
"Now that you have read that I hi-jacked that from a review for Steel reserve by prototypic, this beer for the $12 a six that I payed really is no more impressive nor does is it really any different than steel reserve (it tastes almost identical to a malt drink I had once at a friends called clear creek ice) or for that matter anything that comes in a 40 and is drank from a paper bag."
"Drinkability: A super clean and drinkable marzen that I could down a six of easily. A classic with similar tastes to their other brews. A great fall beer."
"D: this is an Oktoberfest I could easily see myself drinking in the summertime. Alas, it is autumn. A bit of a disappointment, but interesting nonetheless to see a classic German brewers unique interpretation of a classic style."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is sweet, malty, a bit of grain, good flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
"A punchy lager with some decent flavours but it doesn't quite do it for me."
"D- easy drinking. Pretty boring marzen though...so many better options"
"D - Not a bad marzen. Pretty average for the style. I was hoping for something more from Weihenstephaner, but it was enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Oktoberfest."
"D: This is my favorite Oktoberfest Marzen style lager. i could drink this all night and not bat an eye at other beers. The ABV is masked well but hits you good."
"taste was to me akin to a ""Heineken"" bit of hops some maltiness...not really what I was expecting...this just doesn't feel like an ""O'fest", maybe that's why it just say's ""fest bier""? anyway...mouthfeel is fairly full and creamy, and drinkability is fine, just seems a bit light for a Marzen....but still very nice....cheers!"
"Overall - IMO, not the most complex/tasty Marzen out there (that's Ayinger for me), but a solid offering from an otherwise outstanding brewery."
"Drinkability: This is not my favorite märzen, but it is drinkable. It's more of a traditional lager than festbier in my opinion."
"M: light body, very refreshing sensation at first but then a strong bitterness fills all your mouth and also in the back."
"D: Doesn't go down all that easily, minor kick, not a very good representation of the style. I would definitely opt for others of the style."
"You really should buy at least two of these beauties because it goes down so easy and delightful."
"I could easily drink these all night. I chose to just rate this as is neglecting to take style into consideration. Marzen/okto?"
"D-reminds me more of a summer beer than a fall one, still a good beer, but not what I was expecting. All in all a decent beer, but nothing special"
"D_Super drinkable. Great low ABV session."
"D: This beer is not too filling and is very drinkable, and there is not much of an aftertaste. It is a good representative of the Oktoberfest genre which I am not a huge fan of, so take my review with a grain of salt if you are big on Oktoberfest beers"
"I can see that this is a very drinkable beer and if it was in the style of a German Pilsner I might rate this higher but for the style it was a big fat disappointment and I love Weihenstephaner."
"A good example of the style, but a bit on the light side."
"drinkability; very drinkable and smooth. The alcohol will sneak up on you though."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Very light golden color with a frothy white head that went quickly leaving a slight lacing. Smell is much more floral than I expected. Caught a hint of lavender even. I was surprised that the taste followed suit. Much lighter in taste than I expected, and very crisp dry finish. As some other reviewers stated it was almost pilsner like. I liked the beer and it drinks very easy, but it just wasn't what I was expecting for the style. I wish it came out as a late spring/early summer beer. It's not what I was looking for in early autumn."
"drinkability: for its category, it is lacking in some of the fundamental components, but is still a very drinkable beer in-general, fresh and more pleasant than a pilsner or typical lager."
"To me it is an average beer."
"Slightly darker in color than the Weihenstephaner lager, with a head that is every bit as frothy and happy. Fizzy bubbles everywhere in the glass, swirling from the bottom rather than rising in a straight line. How do they do that? Somewhat light in the aroma department; ditto for the taste-- both were rather thin for my liking in this style. I detected some fruityness and a flabby layer of malt; if the latter were pulled forward it would really improve this beer. The dryness at the end is nice but it tastes a little corny overall. Have one so you can say you did, then go find a six of Hacker-Pschorr."
"D - Totally made to drink in large quantities, i.e. oktoberfest."
"Taste is malty and crisp with some sharp bitterness. It like more of a biscuit maltiness though. Mouthfeel is a bit light bit cramy an easy drinking. Overall decent."
"Notes: Not really like a Märzen, but a tasty beer. Definitely German tasting with German hops and bready/doughy malt taste. Overall another tasty beer from the brewery, but like the weizenbock (Vitus) it doesn't really seem to fit the style too well."
"Chrystal clear, yellow and a thick white head. The aroma is sweet pear, pilsner malt, and the slightest hint of noble hops. The beer has a light body with pils malt and a doughy, bread like flavor that is more like a helles than a Marzen. A very drinkable beer. It would be easy to drink quite a few of these, but it's not a Marzen. As a helles I would give this more points, but as a Marzen not so much."
"I rate this pretty high. It feels like a lite beer. like your standard American macro beers. A good flavor...as said before, I wish your standard party keg beers like Miller Lite or Keystone tasted like this."
"Beer is mildly sweet and completely clean. Finishes without an aftertaste. It has a slight dryness and hoppy bitterness to it on the backend. Its interesting and like most lagers underrated. Its about the most drinkable beer imaginable."
"Weihenstephan is about 25-30 minutes north of Munich in the town of Freising. I had my Festbier and Kasespaeztle in their neat vaulted brick beer cellar."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable beer that I'm not sure is spot-on for the style, but it's not bad. Light, easy to drink, and fairly tasty.... but definitely not the greatest from the Weihenstephaner brewery."
"The marzen is an excellent style for late summer-early fall crowd. It hints at colder weather to come without losing sight of what makes summer fun (the beer, of course!). This example is tasty and simple and just like it should be. I'd recommend it."
"Drinkability is great, thanks to the crisp, clean flavor and finish and lightweight ABV. Would definitely have another one of these, given the chance. But I wouldn't call it a marzen, because it most certainly isn't one. Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Having enjoyed everything else I've tried by Weihenstephan in the past, this was a little disappointing for me from the light color through the taste. I'm shocked to say that I much prefer this year's Sam Adams Oktoberfest! I did take a sniff and sip of this beer from a friend's glass a day later and it didn't seem to be as disappointing as this bottle. Maybe I just got a bad one? I think this is too far off the traditional Oktoberfest/Marzen style. Will try again and update later..."
"D - The definition of drinkable."
"Poured into a Frankfurt stein, this showed brilliant, clear yellow-golden color and a thick, foamy white head. Aromas were of clean hops, grains and dough, with some very faint herbal aspects. The mild hop and grain aromas carried through to the flavor, which was perfectly balanced by plentiful carbonation. A delicious, fresh, refined and very drinkable beer that I can't wait to have again."
"Fresh, mild, tasty, only a dedicated and fervent hophead could have any complaints with this beer. I've often wondered why they switched to a lighter colored lager at the modern Oktoberfest but if they are all as drinkable as this bier I can understand why, this glass is dissappearing rapidly. I may not forsake my beloved amber Marzens but I sure won't turn my nose up at these lightre colored Festbiers anymore!"
"Pours a nice, clear gold with an impressive snow white head. There are a few specks of lace that stick to the glass as the head dissipates to the slightest layer of foam. Smell is pretty up front and clean: light bready malts and floral / spicy hops. Taste is clean, too: grains, a touch doughy and a light touch of pepper from the hops. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. A very drinkable brew... kind of lighter than I was expecting, but good stuff. I'd bust it out during an Oktoberfest party."
"Overall a very good beer that I usually drink once or twice a year."
"Notes: This is an outstanding, highly drinkable Fest bier. It's not very complex but what's there is very good!!!"
"A fairly drinkable, fairly mundane beer, capable of doing its job, getting drunk all day without wrecking someone."
"D: Easy to go through a ton."
"D: throw them toward"
"Nice low carbonation and moderately-light body."
"Weihenstephaner Festbier was a golden color with a one inch, white head that showed pretty good retention. The aroma was malty sweet and grainy. The taste was sweet and grainy, like the aroma. A buttery flavor was also prominent. Other than the butter it was similar to a common lager, I liked it though. The mouth feel was medium bodied, oily and moderately carbonated. Drinkability was good, reasonable price, taste and ABV."
"D - So this may be a bad bottle of this beer, but who knows? There was only 1 bottle left on the shelf at a small liquor store where I live and I haven't seen this one anywhere else. If this is the normal quality the drinkability isn't too good and I wouldn't get it again. However, if I see another bottle someday I might pick it up out of curiousity to rereview."
"D: I don't think Weihenstephaner makes a bad beer, and this one follows that trend. A nice light beer with some pleasant flavor."
"D -"
"Non-traditional for a Marzen style brew. Don't know if this is what we in America have come to expect out of one, or if its a true European Marzen. Neverless, a decent brew."
"Bought a six pack last weekend, just cracked opened one of the beers. I gotta agree with Geeman on this. To me, from the different types of Octoberfest biers I've had, this is totally in left field and seemingly not representative of the style. None of the colors, aromas or tastes of a traditional octoberfest (deep malt, carmel flavors that make me think ""octoberfest flavor) This tastes almost like a Euro lager. I love Weihenstephaner, in the past I'v eenjoyed all of their offerings, but this is the only style from them that I would not buy from them again. Considering all of the tasty treats I have sampled from them recently, they get a pass from me for this particular style that just seems to have missed the mark."
"D- a different type of marzen than I usually go for, it's light like hofbrau, heavier and well hopped, still rather sweet, and easily drinkable. Not my favorite, but respectable nonetheless."
"A light, straw colored beer with good clarity and a small white head. The aroma is spicy and fruity with a firm presence of noble hops. The flavor is crisp, clean and spicy with a touch of sweetness. I expected a thinner consistency but it's more in the moderate range and the carbonation was low. This is a very easy drinking yet flavorful beer."
"This was interesting. I've seen quite a bit of variation within this style, from the pilsner-like marzens consumed at the festival, to the fat, bock-ish versions that seem to be the favorite among American craft drinkers. This is somewhat of an oddity, walking the line between the two with a spicy/citrus hop punch to boot. I dig it, even if it's a bit off-kilter for the style."
"Flavor follows the nose. Light and smooth for the style, yet offering just enough malt base to justify its position thereof. But then it could be dubbed a Munich Helles as well. Oddly aside of its cohorts, this beer drinks easily for the style that I feel, like others, that it doesn't really belong in. A very worthy beer nonetheless, though more of a fall seasonal Pils/Helles than an Oktoberfest."
"I got this in my beer club's octoberfest case, was expecting a dark marzen until I took a gander at the bottle, wow it's clear! The smell is basically non-existant to me. Light golden tones give it more of a spring (feel free to ? me) feel. The taste I can agree to an early fall feel. It still has a slight springy/freshly cut grass taste. All in all not a bad beer by any means. Exceptionally drinkable. Just not sure why it's a ""fall"" oriented beer."
"I find it funny that the oldest brewery in the world has trouble classifying their beers, however this is still thoroughly enjoyable and very drinkable...call it a pilsner and I'll give it an A+, call it a marzen and I'm confused."
"The mouthfeel is light as you would expect by the color, but you can feel some depth in the body. Nothing noteworthy or bad about the mouthfeel. The beer scores an average for drinkability. It's light and easy to drink, but I don't want another one and it wasn't very memorable."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/21/09."
"If this was listed as a pils, I'd be all up in it. But this is not my style of marzen where I prefer a much more malted, roasted, toffee base."
"Overall, a decent brew, but far from what one would expect for an Oktobrfest. Very Pils-like (not just the appearance). I'd actually enjoy this in warmer weather, or no frills with pizza. Just ok."
"The Festbier pours a golden straw color with lots of carbonation that leaves a fizzy head about 1 finger thick. No lacing is noted along the pint glass. Color is much paler than I like to see in a Marzen. Nose is nothing special with very subtle hints of malts and bready aromas. Taste is also very mild with very little alcohol being noticed but also not too many other flavors popping up. Taste of sweet citrus along with the traditional marzen malts. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and drinkability is mediocre. Many other marzen's that I much prefer but a solid beer nonetheless."
"D - Drinkability is high, but water is really drinkable too. Overall this is around average for the style."
"When I saw this beer was next on my to-drink list, I figured that it would be a classic oktoberfest and fit the style guidelines perfect since it's coming from Weihenstephan. It's anything but your typical festbier, but it's still quite good, which I've come to expect from the world's oldest brewery."
"Displays a wonderful deep golden color with a thick white head that persists. Aroma is deep and malty with little to no hints of caramel. Melanoidins are present and mild. Little to no noble hop aroma. Flavor is crisp and smooth, with complexity presented via the mash rather than grist. Very malty without cloying flavors. Drinkable!"
"D: Easy to consume in large quantities. Exactly what it was brewed for. The nice taste doesn't hurt either."
"D - A very drinkable brew that hides it's alcohol well. Solid German beer character that could be put down by the case which makes it a fantastic oktoberfest. Besides that it doesn't really resemble one so much."
" I was only disappointed because I thiught I was going to drink an Oktoberfest but I wasn't disappointed with the beer. Easy to drink but I don't think I would have on a hot summer day. The cool sunny days in Sept are just fine."
"Pours a light gold [this is a marzen?] with a nice white head. Smells of grainy and golden malts, faint hops. A livelier, less austere, malt aroma than most malt-smelling beer. Tastes like a more flavorful version of a euro-pale lager; nothing at all like a marzen. Not bad but not advisable."
"From the name festbier, I was expecting and hoping for a Marzen styled beer. This is a decent enough helles."
"Edit: my review of this is in the Helles category."
"Drinkability: Not a bad oktoberfest beer, though not one of my favorites. I certainly wouldn't turn it down, however there are better ones out there that I would prefer to drink."
"Overall - This really surprised me. I guess it has been such a long time since I have had a quality lager (excluding pilseners) that this seemed quite outstanding compared to the crap I have had recently. Still, regardless of the contrast, I am quite confident that this is the best pale lager I have ever tasted."
"Picked up a six pack at Wine Gallery, Brookline. Poured my first one into a 1l German stein. I was surprised at how yellow, fizzy and watery this beer looks. Almost like a lager. Smell was a tad on the musty side. Flavor was pretty boring, bordering on being skunked. Mouthfeel was fizzy and thin. Overall drinkability was just average because I could slosh it down. Major let down from a brewery that I thought could put out a good Oktoberfest product but apparently is only good at making hefes."
"As I soon as I spied this on the shelves in a local stop, I thought I had to have it immediately as I had been very impressed with the same brewery's other selections. The golden ale poured seemingly well, but the comparisons to the other ales ended shortly after that. The nose on the ale reminded me of a bitter- sweet mass produced lager from Holland, which many people mistake for German. The first taste confirmed it was a mix of ale and lager tastes that made me want to retreat to the IPA's and Stouts in my fridge. I thought that maybe I got either a bad bottle or that it was another attempt to cash in on the Oktoberfest theme in the American market."
"You know, these new fangled blonde fest/marzens just don't cut it with me. As a pale lager it's not bad, not great, but not bad. As a fest, it's the requisite malty, easy drinking beer. But the key red/Vienna malt thing is ignored. Oh well. Served with a nice, white, foamy, frothy head and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow gold. Aroma is a very mild malt. Flavor show's a lot more hop (fest?) bitterness and good balance with the malt, so I have some decent bittersweet flav. Body is quite good and so is carbonation. Finish is quintessential pale lager. Session beer for a pale lager but NOT for a fest/marzen."
"D: easy to drink, but not too interesting."
"This beer pours a pale golden colour with beautiful carbonation that leaves a nice frothy two finger head and a nice thick ring of lacing,the aroma is spicy herbal hops and pilsner malts,it has a nice mouthfeel to it which isnt full nor thin just right and the on first sip it starts off like a really nice pilsner but on aftertaste u can taste the difference between this style and a pilsner with a nice full malty finish,not a bad beer thats not overly complex but could easliy drink more than one."
"Light yellow color (which is strange for the Marzens out now), with a think white head. Good lacing. The nose is very yeasty...smells like a brewery. On the palate it is more yeast, a great light texture with a tiny tiny tiny bit of creaminess from the head. Really refreshing and quaffable."
"D - Light and easy going with little to no aftertaste."
"Overall I didn't think I'd be a big fan of this beer after my first whiff, but it combines the qualities of a crisp pilsner and an Oktoberfest to create a very nice beer. While it may not be traditional, this may be my new go-to Oktoberfest beer. Definitely worth a shot."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a steady stream of small rising bubbles that tries to support an ivory head that dissipates to a film with streaky lacing. Aroma is sweet and grassy hops, with some grain but not particularly strong. Light, creamy body, with sharp carbonation and mild hop bitterness in the finish. Flavor is pale malts, slightly sweet and grainy, with floral, grassy hops in the finish. The finish and aftertaste start to come around to more a typical marzen, even if the body seems more pils-ish. Overall, a nice easy drinking fall beer, even if its not the best marzen or Weihenstephaner offering."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. This is a very nice looking beer. Golden yellow with decent carbonation, left a decent head. I was expecting this to be a little darker. Tastes very much like a normal pilsner. Not a lot of hops or maltiness, just pretty straightfoward. Clean finish, easy drinking. Not bad, but probably not worth the $9 for the sixer. Don't think I'll go out of my way to have it again."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. Not exactly what I expected for the style overall, but the high drinkability is right on, and it is even increased by the light and refreshing feel and flavors."
"Drinkability: Huh. Well, it really takes the ""ease of copious amount of drinking"" route, leaving you wanting a bit more flavor, a bit more character, but, if downed in copious amounts alongside roasted chickens and sausage, you probably wouldn't care at that point anyhow."
"Bright yellow color.. fizzy and well carbonated. Smell combines white grapes and hops. Taste is very clean and refreshing: mild malt balanced with crisp hops. Not as heavy as I expected from an oktoberfest and to me seems very similar to a pilsner.. but style aside this is a light and drinkable beer."
"It is a killer Festbier, just get it fresh, I made the mistake of having older bottles in years' past."
"A little bit of a disappointment. If you're looking for an oktoberfest style beer, this isn't it. But if you want a cross between a hefe and a munich helles lager, this is your choice. Personally, I was expecting better from this brewery. I'll stick with their regular hefe."
"Not a bad example of an ""Oktoberfest"" style beer. I like a more amber color than what this brew gives you, but it doesn't fall short on flavor. Full flavors but with an excellent drinkability that is commonly found amongst the Marzen style beers. Overall a good choice when the weather starts to cool down."
"Probably the best thing to say is buyer beware. If you expect a Helles, good news. If you expect a ""fest beer", don't expect a Marzen."
"I can't say I'm enjoying this beer. Generally I like a bit of flavor with my beer. This one is bitter with a bland finish. It had some carbanation which sort of helped and it had a pleasant sour wine smell. The drink-ability wasn't high in my opinion."
"Drinkability: this beer is eminently sessionable. I'm just sad I'm not drinking a Maß of this in Munich."
"D: A 5 here. Being withing style doen't really count on this one. Having said that, this beer is wonderful. With a 5.8% ABV, this is a highly sessionable, easy drinking, refreshing beer."
"Still recommended, I could drink a bunch of these little guys in short order."
"D: This is kind of an oddball...definitely doesn't fit into the standard O-fest definition, although it doesn't actually say it's an Oktoberfest anywhere on the bottle. Interesting. All that aside, a pretty decent, hoppy German lager."
"D..Easy to drink, that is certain. However, some might not like the sweet flavor in this beer. Not what I was hoping for in a traditional Oktoberfest but worth a try once."
"D: I had high expectations for this beer, and it's just OK. They go down easy, but they're very light for the style. There are much better Oktoberfests out there."
"a great marzen! very easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Poured golden from a bottle. Much lighter than any other beer I've seen labeled Festbier. Had a sharp hop flavor and a slightly tart taste to it. The extra ABV is detectable and basically what sets it apart from a Pils or Helles. Nothing wrong with this beer except that it is so much lighter and sharper any of the other Marzens I've been drinking this fall."
"Poured into my pint glass this does not look like a marzen at all. It's clear golden yellow. The head is thick and pillowy white. I had to finish pouring twice. After it settles plenty of white lace covers the glass then dissapears rather quickly. The smell is sweet grains. Hops and wet grass. It sort has an adjunct air about it. The flavor is much of the same. Sweet grain, sweet hops, bready, grassy. This is more like a adjunct then a marzen. Medium to light body with just a hint of carbonation. This is maybe the most dissapointing Oktoberfest experiance to date. It was more pilsner then any other style."
"Very pale yellow pour with a tall, short lived, loose white head. The aroma is grassy with slight light citrus, a little biscuit malt, and some noble hop spice. Lightly sweet and bready malt backbone with some lemon zest and a mildly spicy and peppery noble hop finish. Light body with moderate carbonation. I suppose I might not be fully versed in proper German styles, but this does not seem like an Oktoberfest at all. It's a nice, light drinking beer, more like a Kolsh to me, but doesn't have the hearty malty flavor that I look forward to drinking in Fall."
"Slightly watered down medium body with a lot of clove spice, ripe banana, citrus fruit and bready yeast. Slightly dry finish."
"The beer pours bright and yellow with a healthy amount of white lacing. The aroma is grassy and sweet with simple but fresh malt. It's hoppier than I was expecting. There are strong, grassy hop notes. The malt is a tad sweet but it's a crisp, refreshing beer. I'm not usually a fan of Marzen (and this beer isn't really brewed to style, as far as I can tell), but I find this beer quite good. It's simple, fresh and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth; it lacks the sharp refreshing bit of carbonation that I look for in a beer like this."
"Not what I thought it was going to be. Not even close. Pours brilliant gold with a white head that quickly falls into the glass. Does not look like the amber O-fests that I have become accustomed to. Looks great just not like an O-fest. The smell is sweet, bready, and clean spicy hops. Good smell just not as malty as one would expect from the style. Taste is crisp sweet lager. Not the fruitiness and malt I thought it would be. Good just not the style (see the trend yet?). Mouthfeel is light. The beer is extremely drinkable. Tastes like a good German Pils to me. I like it alot. It just isn't true to style."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a tight pure white head that quickly settles into a very light ring. The aroma reminds me of a Euro lager, a bit skunky, sulfer, grainy, and grassy nobel hops. The taste seems to be a watered down version of the aroma. Less skunky and grainy taste but very bland. Doesn't seem to have any Munich malt flavors or the slightly bolder Oktoberfest flavor. No hints of caramel or toasted munich malt. The feel is light to moderate with plenty of fizzy carbonation. Nice crisp lager. This is a very disappointing Oktoberfest from a great German brewery. Totally missed the mark and came off as a Euro lager."
"Overall quite nice. Really glad I re-reviewed it, as this brewery really deserves it. I visited them a couple years ago and really loved the place. I really want to go back again, but in the mean time I can enjoy a lot more of these beers."
"1158"
"Partially dry, but with sweet undertone; is that possible? Round mouthfeel with a neutral amount of carbonation. The flavor has some sour elements that peak at the swallow. The aftertaste has some definitive peppery hop. This is a superior Marzen in many ways."
"I'm ready for another."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that's good enough for me to finish the 6-pack I bought, but not good enough for me to buy again."
"MF&D - a well carbonated brew, with a light medium body. the carbonation makes the beer quite filling, but the mouthfeel is very smooth and lends itself to more and more drinking. very palatable, and easily enjoyed on the hottest of summer days, or in Maßkrüge at the fest."
"D: Yes, please, I'd like some more. That's all that I can say to Weihenstephaner, a top notch brewery."
"This does NOT taste like an Oktoberfest beer to me. It's more like a Helles."
"Had this on tap at The Stable in St Louis. Pours a golden yellow with a nice thick head. It smelled very bready and the taste was yeasty with a slight lemon taste as well. It sort of reminds me of a helles. It was not very remarkable but not bad either. It was fairly easy drinking but seemed to be filling so I don't think it would make for a good session beer."
"An alright beer, but not the stellar ones I usually expect from the brewery."
"Unfortunately a bit sweet for me, but it's cleaned up by the end, there's a minimum of yeast and it has a soft, velvety mouthfeel to boot. Not my ideal quaffer because it's a smidgeon heavy on malt, but at 5.8% it's a decent party beer. Bring on the bratwürst!"
"It's a reasonably drinkable beer - goes down easily, although the flavours jangle a little in the mouth, leaving me unsure as to whether they really fit together that well. Still, it's smooth enough, and presumably easy to quaff from litre steins. That's what we're really after, right?"
"A 500ml bottle poured into my dimpled mug. Appears a slightly cloudy medium apricot color with a full inch of fluffy off white lingering foam. Nose and flavor consist of floral hops, caramel, medium toasted grain, a touch of spiciness, a bit fruity and malty. About a notch better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Certainly worth a try for any marzen fan."
"D: An interesting brew, for sure. Not my favorite, but it does indeed have refreshing qualities."
"Notes: Not a complex beer,but session worthy with an overall agreeable taste."
"Not bad. While this drank nicely and offered some decent enough flavors, this could have dialed the citrus back a bit and offered a bit more presence in the body. Decent but not one of the best Märzens that I've had."
"NOTE: a more positive re-review is forthcoming"
"I'm impressed with Festbier. It's good stuff. Nicely done all around. I really disagree with the style classification here on the site. This isn't really close to being an Oktoberfest. I don't see any information on the label that claims such a title, so I'm not penalizing the beer for being a poor representation. Recommended."
"D - This is a little disappointing for Weihenstephaner. It was also a little disappointing for a Marzen/Oktoberfest."
"Felt like any other average beer. Nothing overly significant, but by no means a bad beer."
"D- Like mentioned above, a hair less body than your typical marzen and the color is definitely lighter. I'll definitely have this again as it's more sessionable than the heavier fest biers."
"Drinkability - a little out of place here in February but I could see this as a suitable barbecue session beer."
"Conclusion: Not what you might expect for the style, but oh so very tasty...this is one I discovered by accident (buying a sixer for a friend's 22nd birthday) but I will definitely revisit it"
"D: Very nice and drinkable beer."
"Many others are foul compared to this smooth drinking brew. It's just right and it makes me want to speak German (I do speak German). Do yourself a favor, get some of this and give it the respect you give your elders."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Leaves you wanting more."
"Drinkability: This was a bit of a find for me, as my local has a sixer for $7.99. At that price it's a steal. The Weihenstephaner bottles claim that they are ""the world's oldest brewery"" and with this level of quality it's totally understandable why they'd still be around. Pretty much a perfect beer with which to relax inside when there's a foot of snow outside."
"drinkability - Meh."
"D- Very drinkable and smooth. This would make a great session beer, even though the ABV is just a bit on the higher side. An enjoyable lager."
"Drinkability: A very nice light lager, not exactly what I was expecting from a ""festbier"" but from what I understand this is the direction German oktoberfest ""biers"" are heading in. Could definitely imbibe a few of these."
"This is a great brew."
"D - Are you joking? This style is intended to be quaffed from large heavy drinking vessels hoisted while singing along to a German oompah band! I wasn't as impressed with this one as I have been with other Weihenstephaner brews, but it's still outstandingly drinkable brew!"
"D: Pretty drinkable beer, would have liked it to be a but sweeter, but it was still a good beer. I was hoping for a darker and maltier beer, but it was still an interesting take on this style."
"Drinkability: Very good. This beer is an all around great beer. Too bad I don't really consider it to be a festbier. Will definitely revisit."
"In the end a classic little brew. Nothing to do back flips over but more then decent on every account. I would have no issue with trying this one again any day."
"Drinkability: While much lighter in color than I would expect from a Marzen/Oktoberfest, I suppose these guys are the ones that really know how to do it. The rich flavor is more in keeping with what I am used to; caramel malt and a sweet finish. Like it."
"Not much to this one. Celar gold pour, white head. Faint aroma of grass and malt. Light spice and yeast with the hops to make it even lighter tasting. I expected so much more from a seasonal, especailly and Oktoberfest. Still better than a Budweiser, though not by much."
"M/D - not a very drinkable/enjoyable beer in my opinion. Its a little too thin and overcarbonated. It just wasn't an appealing drink for me."
"Somewhat hazy in the body, a deep blonde color, the head is small but holds up solidly. Musty wood-like aroma with some maltiness. The taste...spicy, hops faint medicinal flavor, mild matiness, honey. Hmmm...a little lighter and coarse than I was expecting overall. Still, this is worth a try."
"I really like this beer. I could drink it all day long (except for the fairly high alcohol content). However, for the style, it totally misses. While the aroma seems right, the taste barely has the Marzen kick I expected, hence the taste ding. The color is way too pale but the mouth feel and overall drinkability were very pleasant. While not representing the style well, still a good beer."
"D - It's average. Slightly opaque in color for an oktoberfest and a little thin on the mouthfeel. Definitely like the toasted malts though."
"D/O: The taste is relatively tame and one-dimensional, which leads to a pretty high score on the drinkability scale. Classifying this as a Märzen/Oktoberfest leads me to review it against the style, which I think this beer completely misses. I understand this is a newer-breed of lighter ""Oktoberfest"" beers, but it's certainly not a Märzen lager (if it is, it's a pretty poor attempt by such a good brewery). If this was brewed to be consumed in mass quantities over the course of the day, then it's a successful, easy-drinking lager that does what it was intended to do. I enjoyed it for what it was, but think a different style classification is in order here."
"Straw yellow color with a slight haze. Rich and creamy aromas mingle with some citrusy overtones, this is very unique and attractive. Rarely do you mix citrus and dairy without a curdling mess, but it really works for this beer because it is so subtle and refined. Body is light yet has a rich and satisfying character that could get dangerous, I could easily pour this down the hatch while riding my German lawnmower down the Autobahn."
"pours a white head on top of a straw colored body. the smell is classic german helles / pilsner ""corn"" smell i always associate this particular malt with. tase is pretty standard to a festbier, a slightly different malt is used then normal to give the festbier a distinct flavor, i think it taste a little more corm like and a little more bitter that the usual helles. mouthfeel is carbonated and slick at the end. drinkability is good, hard to find something to complain about a good beer like this."
"Flavor tas spicy and a bit spicy and tangy with some biscuit underneath. Mouthfeel was good to make this an extremely drinkable fest beer. I liked it a lot"
"Get back to me if you know what's up with the nuns."
"D= I hate to pan a beer from a brewery as great as Weihenstephaner but I have to do it. I am no purist, so its not that I didn't like this beer because it broke some silly rules. Its just that this beer was not terribly enjoyable."
"5.0 D: This is probably the best oktoberfest I've had. Can't get much more drinkable that that."
"Poured rather pale lemon tending orange colour with a reasonable snow white head that dissapates rather quickly. Aromas are dominated by sweet fruit (mainly citrus) with some grainy malt coming into play also. Palate shows more of the same, with the grainy malt adding an almost flinty character (IMO) Rather light palate is served well by the dry finish, that perhaps lacks penetration due to the extremely low bitterness, which i suppose the style requires. I can see why this is their Oktoberfest brew, its really drinkable!"
"Not much in the mouthfeel but very drinkable. I'd buy it again."
"drinkability is decent. this is not much of a marzen, without the caramel malt quality, nor a warming sensation that the style usually showcases. the staleness in the grain does not help either. hopefully this brew is much better on-tap in germany, because this does not stand up to any other offering from Weihenstephaner."
"This is typical of a Munich Marzen style beer, light in color with a modest to slight head, subtle aroma of malts, and a clean crisp dry taste. Unlike the American Marzens that have risen in popularity, this one lacks any sign of sweetness, but sports a clean carbonated finish with a slight hop a the end. A very drinkable beer for the earlier days of Oktoberfest season, but perhaps a bit light for the days of waning daylight."
"Pretty good. Tasty and very drinkable."
"I've had better Oktoberfests, and I usually expect much better from this brewery. Its still a solid beer, but I'm slightly disappointed."
"Weihenstephan's Oktoberfest pours a much paler color that most other Oktoberfests. It is a hazy pale yellow with a white cap. The aroma consists of fresh baked bread, there's almost a pretzel-like quality to it. The hops are lemony. The mouthfeel is soft and full-bodied. There's a bready maltiness to it upfront. Hops appear grassy and add some balance to the malt sweetness. They linger into the finish and add a small bit of lemony tartness to the flavor. It's a little different than your average Oktobefests in color and flavor, but it's still a smooth and enjoyable drinker."
"It's drinkable, but not very. I am not impressed. I had heard good things about this beer but it did not live up to the hype. I question the ability of this being sold as a Marzen. Not to be crude, but this is almost what I urinate after a night of drinking real Marzens."
"Clear light gold color with a frothy white head. Good retention and lacing. Toasted straw and grain aroma with Saaz hop spiciness. Munich maltiness, some nice moderate sweetness with a citrus/lemongrass hoppiness that provides balance. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation is soft but adequate, body is medium-thin but full-flavored, drinkability is excellent."
"D - Very, very drinkable. Has just enough flavor to make you want more without any overpowering characteristics. The pale Oktoberfests are new to me, but I'm not disappointed so far!"
"D- Yeah, especially if you don't want to be bogged down with the heaviness some O-fest beers present."
"smooth, not overly sweet, just too light for my preference"
"Picked up a single in a mixed 6'er from Liberty St. Tavern. Pours a clear gold, like an export lager. In fact, there are a lot of ways this beer is more like a Dortmunder/export lager. The aroma and flavor are dominated by a sweet bready malt taste with a hint of smooth caramel. There's also a mild, spicy hop note at the end of the beer. It's drinkable like a typical O-fest and similarly hoppe, but the malt profile is lighter."
"pours a clear surprisingly pale YELLOW color w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate lacing in my pilsn glass ; huh, smells like a pilsner w/ more emphasis on malts, some grassy hop aroma as well ; tastes like a pilsner too, thought is was mislabled 'till i got on & checked, steely grain and some noble hop flavors, more hop bite than other Ger. fests ; dry & light bodied with plenty of carbonation ; pretty drinkable, if it was a pils or helles it would be excellent, but IMO this is not a 'fest at all..."
"D: Drinkable - to a fault. This is one of those beers that paired so perfectly with the food and generally disappeared in gulps rather than sips, eliciting a 'where did it go?' response when I looked down at a half sausage and an empty glass. I'm puzzled by the style and intrigued: this didn't 'seem' like a Märzen/Oktoberfest like I'm used to...could have been a doughy Kellerbier or Helles instead, though I'm still 'learning' these styles and their subtleties... No matter, I enjoyed this and would definitely have one again."
"Nice body, clean finish. Like chucky."
"Weihenstephaner Festbier poured a light, and slightly cloudy amber color. Smell was good, flowers, and mildly spicy hops. Taste was mild all around. Some sweetness in the front, followed by hit of hop spice. Mouthfell was good. Drinkability is very good. This is a good example of a festbier, easy to drink, and offers some nice flavors. I would drink this again."
"I was expecting more of a copper color with a richer, sweeter malt character, but such was not the case here. This reminded me very much of Hofbrau's Oktoberfest, which can be hit or miss itself."
"Drinkability is pretty high. None of the Munich malt I look for in the style, but the sucker is made to drink by the liter. And I'd probably be able to do so, and for the modern style, it's one of the better examples. Still, I'm just not a modern guy...and would prefer a maltier brew rather then then the fraternity party deluxe."
"The smell was somewhat fruity and slightly malty. The taste was malty that hung on the tongue and seemed pretty sticky in the mouth. As the festbier gets warmer it gets sweeter. Overall it was a very enjoyable Marzen."
"pours a yellow gold in color with a one finger white head and a light sheeting of lace on the glass. herbal aroma with a touch of mint. taste is is same very clean with no after taste. mouthfeel medium and good carbonation. nice taste to this beer very drinkable and has a nice body to it."
"This is the first Weihenstephaner I have not enjoyed much."
"Drinkability: Incredilbly clean, smooth, easy-going, and drinkable. This one would be a very early-Oktoberfest festbier ... it seems more suited for summer than anything. Not necessarily one I'd get again though ... while it is light and fresh and whatnot, it's just not terribly interesting. Guess I've been officially spoiled by American beer."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very light with a nice clean taste and finish. The beer was very refreshing also. It was a very light blond color. The head did not last at all and the beer only had fair lacing qualities. I would buy again"
"Mouth feel is clean, slightly tingly. A very good beer for session drinking. Hard to find another. Does anyone have a large tent and a band available?"
"Nice drinkability, which is what one expects out of a festbier. A good balance makes it drinkable, and a sweet finish lends the pallet to want another sip. This beer is a unique and good example of an oktoberfest that is worth a try."
"Very different from the other Oktoberfest beers sampled thus far. Lighter in malt character as well as color, making it much more akin to a Helles, but this is simply a ""Festbier," after all, and not an ""Oktoberfestbier."" Year-round availability and easy drinkability make this one good for any Fest."
"light clear gold with a nice rocky white head. nose is fresh doughy bread and grassy noble hops. lightly sweet pale malts up front with light, smooth hop bitterness leading to a crisp finish. nicely carbonated, light to medium in body, definitely sessionable and approachable."
"The taste is bread, herbs, pine, faint hints of honey, apple and lemon, with a tingly pine-herb flavour and bitterness, along with a faintly rough, thin mineral-water quality. It has a somewhat bitter pine-juniper-herb finish. It goes pretty well with food and is fairly easily drinkable, but not great."
"D: This one goes down easy but, man is it a disappointment given that it's from Weihenstephaner :-("
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Buckeye Beer Engine. Apple juice colour with some white wheat. The aroma and tase of sour wheat. Below average mouthfeel. Not up to expectations for this brewery. Some astringency offset by sweetness from wheat. Drinkable in a pinch."
"Yeah this is a pretty good beer, but like others I ask is this a truly a Märzen / Oktoberfest? This site isn't the only place to call it that, where I got it (Max's) did, and the guy sitting next to me did as well when I asked him his recommendation for the style, so I dunno...anyway not bad."
"D- need more..."
"Interesting forum, doesn't change my marks"
"D: Very good session beer for a festival. The demerits are only because this beer does not really meet the ""Octoberfest/Marzen"" Style. I am almost certain no Munich malt is in the grist. If it were listed as a Helles or Dortmunder my ratings would rise by 0.5 across the board."
"Poured a perfectly translucent golden yellow color, bright white foamy head of two fingers fell slowly back to reveal a moderate ring of lacing. Aroma is characterized by what I would typically expect from a German Pilsener or a Helles, slightly skunked grassy hoppiness broken up by a sweet maltiness. Taste is very much the same, maltier than the nose lets on, but not by much. Finishes by leaving the faintest lightly dry and bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, a little rough because of this brew's watery-thin viscosity. Drinkability is great, easy to drink with an appreciable (if a little light and lacking in the malt department for an O'fest) flavor. A solid beer, there are better representations of this style available."
"500ml bottled served in a becker. Batch# 3248 indicated on the bottle. Poured a pale, translucent golden yellow with a one inch, creamy/frothy bright white head. Head eventually settles into a soapy, broken cap. Some strands of watery lacing present during the tasting, but weak legs. Nose is mild, musty wheat with a hint of sweetness detectable in the profile. Taste consistent with nose, as well as the addition of some light fruit (pear); wheat/biscuity character lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with consistent, but subdued carbonation. I found this brew very refreshing, but all the qualities of the Festbier do not add up to your typical marzen. A decent brew, but way off style in my opinion."
"Drinkability- This stuff is highly sessionable and very good. Hence the name I guess, Festbier."
"Pours a lightly hazy, extremely pale, straw colored brew with a small, white head that sticks around a little while. Smells of german malts, yeast, pretty mild. Strange off smell too. Tastes of doughy, bready malts, yeast, distinct ""german taste", very light hop spiciness. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. Pretty drinkable but pretty watery. Not the best example of an authentic German Marzen, or a Marzen period for that matter, but well worth a try."
"Drinkability, sure. Its an ok german beer. A true octoberfest Marzen? Well, Its a good season to be in, there's more to try."
"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Body is a slightly opaque golden color, topped by a small, light white head. Aroma of lightly fruity pale malt, along with a touch of adjunct flavor. Palate is mildly sweet up front before yielding to a husky bitterness before the swallow. The sweetness returns on the finish, with just a touch of fruity hops. Body is a little thin, but also slightly creamy and holds the flavor well enough. Not my favorite Oktoberfest by any means, but an interesting interpretation of the style."
"The taste is quite smooth, not particularly creamy, definitely not crisp. There is a champagne type apple flavor, some vinous notes, sweet malts, a bit of hop presence with a touch of pepper spice on the back end. There is a tad bit of a bready quality, but the breezy champagne lightness, the strong apple notes, and the simple smoothness to the beer predominate over everything else. This isn't a bad beer, I just don't know how this is a marzan by an stretch."
"D: Very drinkable. My complaint is the color. This would be much higher ranked if the color was different. That being said this makes an amazing session beer."
"This is a great Helles but a rather poor Oktoberfest. Still worth a try as its still an enjoyable brew."
"D = A good early Autumn beer, easy to drink and worth having a couple of on a sunny afternoon."
"It is an easily drinkable beer though not the best oktoberfest beer that I've ever had. Would be happy to drink with bratwurst in the fall."
"Great beer in the sun with a lot of meat on the bone. Sneaky fast."
"The appearance struck me by surprise, since I was expecting a winter warmer, I should have known it was way to early in the season, after study more on this beer it was no surprise that it is an octoberfest style, what trick me was the christmas looking wreaths and bulbs on the label. it appears in a light golden haze, i'm drinking it in the ultimate beer glass by samuel adams. the head was holding its own, very stable and then withers away after around four sips. The smell had some spicy notes, with hops dangling around the nose after the initial pour. the tast resembles a marzen the most, because i don't taste the malty notes that are more apparent in an octoberfest. The alcohol is present here, dissapating very quickly and smooth over the tongue leaving very quick, nice you might say. The drinkability doesn't have my belly full that quick like fuller bodied beers, I could drink a six pack easily, considering the alcohol content as well."
"D: A very nice marzen - if you get past the fact that it's not dark, it is an excellent beer."
"Very light colored for an Oktoberfest beer in my opinion. There are some very light and subtle aromas of a mild citric character and light hop bitterness. Some mild spices up front on the tongue that lead off to a solid malt sweetness across the palate. Mild hop burn and a crisp dry finish here. This is a great, easy drinking session beer with a light body, mild flavors and decent carbonation. Perfect beer for a muggy Autumn day, I just wish it was a little more full and rich considering the style."
"As with many other BA's, I was surprised at the unusually straw colored beer. Where most Oktoberfest beers begin with a bright copper/orange hue mixed in with ligher highlights, this beer reminds me a lot of German Lagers. Even the nose is more hop-forward with a spicy saaz note and haullertau herbal, grassy character. Malts stay clean, crisp, sweet, and bold, with no hints of caramel, toast, or melanoidin taste. Instead, a bold lager-like flavor comes through, though pushing the threshold on sweetness and body. Confectionate sugars with fresh fruity notes (pez-like), give a very pleasant sweet tastes to accompany the pilsner malts. A bit heavy in the body for a pils, begins to bring out a marzen-type weight. Nicely carbonated and bitter. Finishes quite clean with a hop note late and some malty sweet breadiness / yeastiness. It's a very good beer, but not what I consider a Festbier. So, the rating may not reflect the quality of the beer, but style accuracy."
"When I first tried this I didn't really like it very much but I tried it again and it's actually quite tasty. Definitely not as good as other O-fests, but good."
"T + M + D: Toasty malts rounded with a full hop flavour - a bit herbal, a bit grassy, and with a dash of bitterness. Medium body, a lighter carbonation zing, and a touch of oiliness going down. Insanely drinkable - it presents and drinks like a lighter lager. Perhaps not quite what I'd go for in the style, but a tasty brew nonetheless."
"Poured from a large Weihenstephaner bottle (not the 12oz six pack bottles). The beer is very clear, light yellow colored, with good sized white foam leaving lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and bready with some floral hops. The flavor is likewise malty sweet with some complementary floral hops notes. It smells and tastes more like a Munich Helles than a marzen, but Weihenstephaner knows what they're doing (oldest brewery in the world after all). The body is medium and drinkability could hardly be improved. Weihenstephaner is a solid choice no matter which style they make."
"D - Not really my kind of beer but it is easy drinking. You could definitely have a few of these. Would be a good summer beer in my opinion."
"A good Fest brew, but there are better examples out there with more body and character, though this one is really drinkable."
"D: This beer didn't do much for me. It might just be the style, but the taste didn't have enough complexity or interest to it."
"D: Drinkability is decent while the ABV is pretty well hidden for 6.0. overall not a bad beer just don't understand how its considered a marzen. Was expecting more from this I guess considering their other styles are pretty much tops in class."
"Exquisitely brewed, quite possible the perfect summer beer. It may not be Xtreme enough to get the kind of mad props it deserves from beer snobs, but if you're looking for art in a glass you could hardly do better than to pick up some Festbier."
"Mouthfeel is very light and fairly refreshing. Drinkable, just totally not what I was expecting."
" Drinkability is definitely by the liter forget the caramel sticky sweet toasted malt with a nutty edge Octoberfest beer that we drink. This is the type of beer meant to be drank in number during times of celebration, so enjoy and swing your elbow back and forth, Prost!"
"A cloudy yellow with an orange hue relatively no head. Virtually no smell except for a slight light fruit/sweet smell. This is a bit different than most oktoberfests that I've had, sweet malt, but not enough bready vienna toffee maltiness that I love, but matched with a bitter hop profile. This isn't the best of its style."
"16.9 typical German brown bottle, pours surprisingly light, cloudy apricot, medium retention on the off white head that leaves splotchy lace behind on the glass. Soft malt and a hint of flowers in the nose. Light and refreshing. Tastes more like a light summer ale/wheat beer then a marzen/octoberfest beer. Light, easy drinking and pleasant enough. Notes of moderate fruit, lighter malts with soft drying hops late. Not what I expected in a German Ofest style beer, but this one is highly quaff able and quite enjoyable, whatever style it actually fits into. Gave it a shot as part of a chicken marinade to boot."
"Superbly rounded and balanced! Remarkably drinkable! A definite ""must taste"" for anyone interested in the Maerzen style."
"Lighter and less malty than most Marzens, but its unique take is definitely welcome to the style. Light, smooth and goes down well...which an Oktoberfest beer should."
"Not bad at all though not quite what I think of when I think of a festbier."
"Palate is saaz-like hops up front followed by subdued maltiness. Overall dry and crips, refreshing, but certainly not a malty ""festbier"" that I was expecting."
"Weihenstephaner sets a very high standard for itself, and this, in my opinion, falls somewhat short of their usual excellence. Still, a clearly good and enjoyable beer that I will certainly drink again, although I would usually choose their Helles over this. Come September I can see myself buying at least a 4-pack of this beer."
"Beer pours a golden color with a nice head initially that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is grassy, malty, and perfumed with euro hops. Taste is balanced, hints of lemon in the malt and nicely hopped upon the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no special characteristics across the palate. Overall drinkability is quite refreshing. It is bordering on the edge of sessionability but one could consume several of these without being overwhelmed. Style wise this strikes me more as a pils. This is worthy of a try."
"Just a tiny bit thin to be a really strong lager, the hops take away from the chewiness. Definitely drinkable. A tasty beer, not one I'll go back to, but I had to round out the Weihenstephaner lineup."
"Hugely drinkable. For a lighter style with plenty of flavor and sensible alcohol content, this is a great pick. Would be just as good a summer beer as an Oktoberfest thing. I'd definitely pick it up again."
"Drinkability - didn't want to finish this beer. Just wanted to find something else that I wanted to drink. I might give it a try again if I can find something that I can ensure is 100% fresh and not take a risk on a bottle without a date again."
"I would have another if available, but not as a session."
"12 oz. bottle with some code on the back label. The beer is gold with low carbonation, two inches of creamy white head that clings to the glass, along with some coagulation/floaties. Fairly sweet and lightly grainy in the nose. Similar in flavor, with a dose of mildly bitter, spicy/grassy hops on top of an almost tingly, light, dry body, that has medium carbonation and finish. Pretty tasty and quite clean, but it almost tastes more like a German pils than a märzen."
"I had not seen this beer before in NY, so being in the sunny state of Florida I figured I would try this offering. Nice pour from the bottle, typical yeasty haze with a nice foamy heard. Had that banna clove taste and smell, but with definetely more sweetness upfront. Also, this beer did not seem to go down as quickly- a little heavier, spicey and clove like. I did enjoy it, but I prefer their old standard brew."
"A 1 Pint, .09 fl oz bottle copped in Short Hills... Pours a clear, lucid, pale color with a decent frothy head that soon receded... smell was typical of the style, with a nice combination of malts and hops... taste wasn't bad, but was somewhat bland, with a slight mixture of caramel, vanilla, and fresh florals... mouthfeel was about average, and the points took a hit here due to the somewhat watered-down mouthfeel that was thin and wasn't too rich or creamy... drinkability was decent due to the modest ABV and the light, refreshing, crisp taste that would go well on a hot, Summer day... definitely not a winter-time brew... Weihenstephaner's Hefeweizen is a much better selection... Overall, not a horrible brew, but certainly nothing to write home about..."
"Tasty, easy drinking - this would make a good hot weather beer."
"Light carbonated head. Pretty good fruity and hoppy smell. Hoppy bitter flavor that gets worse on the second sip. Actually starts to taste a little like cough syrup. Definitely overwhelming. The taste of this beer is excessively complicated and way to bitter. This one still needs a lot of work."
"This was not an outstanding beer in any category but was well crafted when all aspects are combined. I was surprised by the bitterness at the end but it married well with the slight spiciness, malt and yeast throughout."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: This beer is a clear straw color with a thin white head that burns off quickly. Spotty lacing. Sweet malt and fruit in the nose, and a touch skunky. Light-bodied with a fruity character along with light grain and hops flavors. The finish is short and leaves a bready malt aftertaste. So-so overall."
"Drinkability- Easy drinker. Thought this was a winter beer from the ""fest"" part of the label, but I guess it was a holdover from the fall. Not really my favorite style, but I did enjoy it and it's perfectly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not the best beer I've had for Weihenstephaner so far, but at least it's a decent light offer from them. I wouldn't mind having this beer again, but if I saw this next to their other offerings, I would go for the other ones instead."
"Notes - Quite good but not as noteworthy as some of the other beers from this excellent brewery. An enjoyable lager nonetheless, though one that I feel would be more suited as a summer beer."
"Overall a very well balanced beer which is full of suprises. Extremely drinkable and a nice change of pace from those overly sweet Oktoberfest offerings."
"Quite drinkable, but only for those who like a strong hoppy Pilsner. Despite what the style says this is really a strong and balls to the wall Pilsner. A beer I can recommend for the Lager Hophead."
"Drinkability  This doesnt knock your socks off like the weizen offerings from Weihenstephaner but it is a solid Festbier."
"Overall-This beer is excellent but I had to downgrade considerably as it does not meet style. Outside of the style I would have given this beer 4.0 across the board."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, this is a good beer in and of itself, but Im very disappointed by the lack of adherence to the style. I respect this brewer a great deal but I dont understand how you can call this an Oktoberfest with the characteristics that this beer has. Again, this is a very good beer, its just not even close to being an O-Fest."
"It's November 8th today and there was a sale on this Oktoberfest beer so I'm not so sure how fair this review will be. But the color of the beer was what is expected of a Marzen... Maybe a little lighter. Nice foamy white head accompanied by lasting lacing as I drink it down. I smell the same smell that I've smelled for many of the German Oktoberfest beers. Sweet malt, touch of hops, some yeasty bread-like qualities, and so on. Chewy and sweet and tasty. The right carbonation and the right flavor. Good beer."
"The drinkability is good as is normal in the style, yet it is not one of my favorites. All in all a solid brew. Prosit MK"
"D. Very drinkable and crisp. Wish it were easier to get here in Charleston!!!"
"Ok, I don't get this beer. I was told this is one of the original oktoberfests, but in this case original doesn't mean good. This seems like maybe a pilsener or a euro lager. I don't know. But those aren't styles I enjoy, and oktoberfests usually are. I won't be coming back for more."
"for a festbier it sure does seem light in color. Not that its inherently bad, just different, and to be honest, for these octoberfest-themed fest beers I really like that burnt orange color a lot more. The aroma is very close to a light lager, very pale malt-ish, alcohol, and a corn type smell. The taste is also very similar to a light lager but there is something extra in there. Something trying to give it just a hint of sweetness between the alcohol/pale malt sharpness. Finishes with a little bit of metallic aftertaste. As a light lager and nothing else, this isn't bad. As a seasonal beer somewhat aligned with the oktoberfest tradition, it is not all that great, and there are many other seasonals out there I would rather drink over this (spaten, hacker-pschorr etc)."
"D: Definitely a session beer, in that Festbier is extremely drinkable. One or two (or three?) are simply not enough. So drinkable this would be an excellent beer to have at a party of mass-marketed-beer drinkers. This beer could turn any beer drinker into someone appreciative of über high quality...."
"This poured to a pale yellow with thin white head and a little lacing. Aroma is a mix of grassy hops and slight skunky grain. Mouthfeel from this somewhat carbonated beer is slightly tingly, but this moves right into a flavor of grass and grain. Finish is short, stale and a littel skunky. Not one of Weihenstephaners best by any means."
"(other): i was disappointed in this beer, i expected more, this beer seems almost too weak and lacking. i could certainly see why chugging mugs of this beer at an oktoberfest celebration would be easy, but thats not what i was looking for..."
"This beer is not what I had expected. I would consider this an excellent Czech style pilsner. Overall the flavor is light and balanced but leans toward the mild citrus hop. Definitely drinkable, however it lacks the toasted malt character I had expected for a Marzen."
"Great drinkability. This may be my new go to Oktoberfest. Definitely the best of what I have had this season."
"Aside from not being a Festbier this is one tasty Helles. Augustiner Bräu Edelstoff might be my favorite Helles Ettaler is very good too. This beer is nearly on that level. This beer should please every beer drinker aside from the it must be an imperial (IPA/Stout/Wit/Bock/etc) for it to be good crowd. Dont you just hate those folks? I do. If youre not one of them, try Weihenstephaner Festbier just remember, it is a Helles. I purchased a six-pack in Council Bluffs, IA."
"I found this one a little bit boring. I probably would have preferred a regular All-Malt Lager or Vienna Lager or something. It may be a Festbier, but it's not one I would seek. Not recommended."
"D: An extremely drinkable beer for its slightly higher ABV."
"Blend of hops and malts and honey in the taste, pretty smooth and drinkable. But not enough to keep me coming back for more. It's a very mellow beer. Not bad, but not great."
"D - This is a very nice Festbier along the lines of a German pilsner. It's very tasty - another great beer from Weihenstephan. I disagree with the Marzen classification."
"As far as the color goes, I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the 967-year-old Bavarian brewery. So it isn't copper like all the other 'Fests... I could still see myself partying with a few of these."
"Drinkability - This is certainly not a Marzen, and it is not very good, not even as a Euro Lager."
"Overall = I like it. This is a nice departure from the US craft Oktoberfest beers and a bit different then your 1516 purity law offerings. Very good."
"Pale yellow with average nose.Pleasant sweet taste with what appears to be honey.Aftertaste also of honey.Good stuff I enjoyed this and would recommend to anybody.A bit pricey so I will be buying six packs of this not cases.Good job by the ""world's oldest brewery"""
"Ok so I picked up a bunch of sixers of different oktoberfest beers last week at my local BevMo, this being one of them. Weihenstephaner being a respected brewer, I thought I'd give this one a shot. Pours a... pale gold?! This is supposed to be a marzen right? Smells clean and malty. Tastes honey sweet. I am a bit dissapointed with the lack of caramel/toffee sweetness that usually comes with this style. Not much hop bitterness. This is a smooth and clean malty beer, just not what I was expecting in an oktoberfest/marzen."
"Pours a beautiful crystal-clear golden hue with a rush of carbonation bubbles racing to the service. The head was quite short, but had nice staying power. A very inviting looking brew. Looks more like a pilsner than my image of a marzen, but still appealing visually. The smell, however, was quite skunky up front with some faint malt and spice sweetness lingering in the background. The taste was very sweet up front -- lots of sugary, honeylike malts with the slightest bite at the finish. Not a lot of balance here. A good, crisp, carbonated mouthfeel would make this a heck of a refresher if the beer wasn't so sweet. Average drinkability -- easy to handle, but a little too off balance to crave this in multiples."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. For being such a light beer, it has a whole lot of flavor. I am a little surprised that the hops were such a big part of the aroma, but ended up taking such a passive role in the overall presentation. I would definitely drink this beer again...but it is hard to go wrong with anything from Weihenstephan."
"I could see myself drinking this one again. It's very tasty and refreshing."
"Drinkability: This is a very good tasting beer but doesn't come across as an Oktoberfest style beer. I think that Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest-Märzen is a much better German import example of this style."
"This is a Helles Lager with a touch more alcohol - a fair one at that. Oddly, I enjoyed other offerings of this brewery much more, including the great lager that they make. This one seems like a mediocre-ish lager with a touch more alcohol. As an O-fest, it's passable, but pretty lame."
"Drinkability: This is certainly not what I was expecting, and I'm sure with others it's probably been the same. Paid around $13 for the 6-pack, and though I'm glad I tried it, I'd probably stick to the Weihenstephaner Hefe varieties in the future."
"Drinkability is very good, in the way a good pils is. No offending traits overall make it easily quaffable! And maybe that's where the fest label comes from... it'd be easy to drink a ton of these."
"It was an easy to drink beer, just not something that I'd go back to. I prefer the other offerings from this brewer."
"Recommended"
"Obviously, the helles-like appearance will freak out those that have never seen a paler version stateside, and many of them are more accustomed to o'fests that could pass for bocks (or doppelbocks) with their maltiness. This is all about finesse. And, actually, tradition...and not just because a person could drink a bathtub of this."
"So I recommend it."
"This is truly a very unique beer to enjoy anytime of the year."
"Poured 1 1/2 bottles into a Hofbrau 500 ml dimpled mug. White head, yellow body could pass for any of those pictures from Oktoberfest except the head dissipates quickly. Unbelievably drinkable and malty though it's so yellow. A quarter inch head follows the brew down the glass. Lightly hopped and a great gateway beer for your BMC buddies."
"MarienPlatz here we come again!"
"Steve"
"Not bad but not a Marzen either. This is a Helles Lager or a Pils. Pours a clear yellow gold pils color with a medium size head that fades to a covering. There is some light lacing. Actually has a mild hops / grassy smell which is an improvement over BMC type beers.Taste is not a whole lot better than BMC lagers..definitely a bit of corn here. The mouthfeel puts it in front of BMC products. Light and crisp but not at all watery or thin. Just right for a light style. Drinkability is good as a lawnmower beer or session beer. I doubt I would choose it over Yeungling, but the mouthfeel makes it better than BMC lagers. All in all, fairly average."
"Nice summer drinker. But not what I expect for a Marzen."
"Overall: Not the best offering by Weihenstephaner. It's an okay brew but I expected so much more."
"Pours a light golden with a medium head that fades to a thin cap but leaves some good lacing. Pale for the style. This one is on the lighter side for a fest beer all around, and less malty than most, but at this point in the late summer, its a nice bridge beer from the Weiss beers to the maltier fest beers. Smell is slightly grainy and clean with a hint of clean malt. Banana and apple as well. Taste is also clean,light, and slightly grainy. Apple flavors are followed by a slight bitterness, a bit of sweet malt, and a trace of banana in the aftertaste. Interesting and refreshing, but I'll want more as the Autumn comes."
"Subtlety is the key here. It's not an extreme US craft oktoberfest, so lets not get our hopes up too much folks..."
"D: I've had better marzens in the past, this one was all right, but probably won't buy again, even though I had no problems drinking it."
"Danka, Weihenstephaners. I love a good festbier, and this is a quality example of the style done right. Enjoy these while you can."
"A good beer, if nothing special. I think Weihenstephan should probably stick to wheat beers (where they truly excel)."
"Iam reviewing this beer for what it is because it is not a marzen/oktoberfest style of beer if I reviewed to that style well it wouldnt work.Poured into a .5 liter stein a clear medium golden with a tight formed creamy-like white head that left a broken ring of lace behind.Pretty clean aromas a bit of toastiness and iron a decent spicey hop smack that lingers.To me this is a full flavord and bodied pilsner toasty malt with a bit of residual honey sweetness almost to the doughy point but not quite a leafy,herbal hop profile in the finish.This is a pretty good beer why such a renowned brewery would label it a Fest well I have no idea it is what it is and its decent."
"Good beer, could certainly be enjoyed at a fest in October, February, or July, but the style is wrong."
"Crisp and light bodied, but seems too soft, like a Czech pils. Needs to be a little more sharp and aggressively malty. Decent hops bitterness, on the other hand. Not too bad, but it was worth a try. Enough to get me excited for the upcoming Oktoberfest season."
"Pours ultra clear, light golden color. Head of bone white bubbles. Crisp, grassy hop aroma, with a touch of malt. Taste is well balanced, but light on both malt and hops. Little bitter bite at the finish. Very ordinary. Line this up with some American macro lagers and it would fit right in. Pass."
"D - Quite a refreshing, simple beer. Would serve it's purpose at Oktoberfest well & on any summer session occasion but for regular drinking theres much tastier beers I'd rather spend my money on."
"Overall- A lackluster beer for sure. This is a good primer (pre-beer) beer. Pound a pint of this then move on up to something a little better."
"Poured into a Weizen and noticed a rapidly dissipating head but long lacing. Colour is translucent (hazy) straw/amber. I got a mild grainy aroma but not very strong or persistent. Tast was big and malty with some grassiness to give it an edge and some late bitterness in the finish. It's well balanced and very drinkable. Other reviewers rated this down but I really love it and if it were more available it would be my session beer even above my beloved Little Critters."
"I expect better from this brewery. Maybe it has been sitting on the shelf for a while."
"Overall: A good but largely unremarkable brew. Certainly worth a try, but hardly at the pinnacle of style."
"Pleasant and refreshing, not as crisp as pilseners - more like northern lager."
"A medium yellow color, with a small white head forming, that retains very well. By the color I am wondering if this is a fest beer or a helles, or even a pilsner. Light floral fragrance, mostly bread and biscuit aroma is most prevelent. The taste is mild, bringing those bread and biscuit scents in flavor, with a slight tinge of bitterness at the end. It has a thin consistancy, there fore the lingering on the palate is surprising. I am still trying to figure out what this is, a marzen, which it is listed as, or another type of german lager. It is very typical of most german lagers, smooth and easy to drink."
"A final note: This beer is essentially a robust Pils. It being listed as Marzen/Octoberfest is a bit odd to me."
"Weihenstephaner Festbier is a good little noble-hopped lager from a world-class outfit. Even though it's one of my least favorite offerings from 'The World's Oldest Brewery', it's going up against some pretty stiff competition with the likes of Hefeweissbier and Korbinian. Bottom line: you really can't go wrong with any beer that has Weihenstephaner on the label."
"Far more helles than marzen, a good example of the lighter approach to festbier that we hear about Octoberfest these days. A fine social beer, whether eating or having a few with friends."
"Mouthfeel is refreshing and light. Could drink many if you were at an outside type of event."
"Not what I expected at all. Most of the Oktoberfest beer's I have tasted have been American interpretations, so dare I say this German Oktoberfest is out of style? Yeah...I guess...Maybe the Fest in the Festbier is so enjoyable those participating lack the capacity to differentiate between styles. Or more likely, perhaps this Festbier is from a warmer region in Germany which believes a lighter Munich Helles or pilsner type brew greater facilitates the Oktoberfest."
"Purchased at: 58 Degrees, Tucson AZ"
"Weihenstephaner Festbier pours a light golden yellow with a white head that did stick around very long from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is very mild, I'm only getting the slightest amounts of malt. Taste is lighter than I expected for an Oktoberfest, spicy hops dominate. It's a little sweet, and there is a flash of metallic flavor at some points and some citric flavors are also present. This is very drinkable even if not to style."
"D: I could have several of these and find myself not being able to stand!"
"D = Pretty good session beer. It aint too sweet that would make it unbearable after a few over time. But yet not lack luster in the way of only wanting one. Weihenstephaner do better beers than this. A little dissapointing actually."
"What I'm thinking about now, as I drink this, is Oktoberfest. How perfect is this beer for such an event, easy to drink, rather tasty and smells good, good mouth, good drink in general... really, just a very good beer to have over and over and over again, whether you're paying attention to it or not."
"Pale yellow gold color. No head, light to moderate carbonation level. Smell of traditional German hops, and a little bit of a wet hay smell. Taste is very clean, but somehow is also big. Very malty with the hops coming through strong. Slight metallic finish. This goes down fairly light and easy but has enough flavor to give it some interest. At first it hints at being a typical light Euro beer but it finishes with a little bit of kick. Not bad, but not really what i was expecting either. A good thirst quencher."
"Notes: Not at all what I expected an Oktoberfest to be like. This is way more like a Helles. The color was too light, the malt flavor and aroma wasn't what it should have been. This was a great beer, and I think a great crossover beer as well, but not what I'd seek out if I'm in the mood for an Oktoberfest."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- In the mouth, it stumbles and awkwardly takes its first steps... there isn't much coordination or grace here. The beer flattens prematurely and, although not terrible, isn't interesting in the least. It feels like a beer brewed to be guzzled by the barrel, and maybe that's the intent since it is a festbier. I could see myself enjoying this in the right context, with the right food, with the right weather... damn I'm reaching here. All in all, a clean, honest beer for the Fall... but it doesn't even rank in my top 10 for this year's Marzen beers."
"overall, this is a very delicious beer, tastes like a great Helles, does not taste anything like any Marzen i've ever had but it is still pretty darn good whatever it is."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Slàinte!"
"Zum wohl!"
"I was really surprised with this one. Pours an awesome head with good lacing down the glass. Looks more like a pilsner, very clean looking and clear, unlike most Festbiers. Very nutty on the palate with some nice corny and bready features. Goes down smooth, seems like an all barley malt beer. Highly recommended, wish I'd have picked up more than one."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a small white head that quickly turns into sporadic lace. Aroma is biscuity malt and a bit of spicey hops. Taste is bready malts followed by some more of the spicey hop notes that were present in the aroma. Mouthfeel is light bodied that is a bit prickly from the carbonation. Overall, this really is not your typical Marzen but a good brew nonetheless."
"Unusual appearance for an Oktoberfest, a pale golden yellow body with a small and trim vanilla head. Some sparse patchy lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has a mixture of biscuity, lightly toasted pale malt and earthy and spicy hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a healthy, medium carbonation. Taste lacks the expected, Munich maltiness. Assertive, earthy, hops bitterness rules the taste. Some spicy and floral hops make their presence known, as well. Maltiness is grainy and toasty, lacking expected sweetness for the style. Still, pretty tasty stuff with excellent drinkability. More sessionable than most of its counterparts."
"Light in the mouth as it should be but I would like more crisp from the carbonation. A middle of the road octo."
"Pours a clear straw golden color. A few bubbles stream from the bottom of my mug as I glance at it. Nice thick white foamy head holds together very well. Bready, pale lager aroma, along with some floral notes. Good amount of bready malt flavor, which is still pale, not like other Marzens. Seems almost more like a Helles. Earthy floral hops balance the malt very well. Light to medium body, with a good amount of carbonation, but not too much. This was way too easy to drink. I could picture this at Oktoberfest in a gian liter mug. Very nice, although not very much like other Marzens."
"The beer pours a limpid golden amber color, the head is statuesque, and a brilliant white, creamy in texture and as it evaporates, the lace forms a tight and sealing sheet upon the glass. The aroma of sweet malt and a citrus like crispness dominate the nose, fresh, clean and inviting with a lightly sweet and malt laden start, the top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is pleasing in its hop spiciness, the acidity mellow, the aftertaste desert dry, and a fine drinking beer as is all of this breweries beer."
"cloudy, dark lemon yellow color...there are white flecks floating around everywhere in my glass. a head that has staying power and a bit of lace.  aroma of nutty, toasty malts and a bit of almost fruity hops...very inviting.   a sort of sourdough bread flavor, like a bakery in a bottle. a rich, creamy and VERY smooth mouthfeel.  no hop bite...just a floral reminder to add to the tremendous balance.  wow is this a good beer.  it's not necessarily a true oktoberfest, since the bottle has a x-mas wreath adourning it's label.  a brew to celebrate any season!  search it out if you can.  weihenstephaner is two for two in my book with the korbinian up next."
"Slightly sour, nutty aroma.  Very fruity in taste -- almost wine like.  Honey like sweetness on the main palate, with a sourdough like flavor undergirding.   Slightly dry finish with noticeable hop bitterness.  Fairly full-bodied.  Sour aftertaste."
