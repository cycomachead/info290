"This is my favorite Oktoberfest beer!"

"Overall this was a good beer. I really appreciated the fullness of the body, though I would have tweaked the taste a bit I think."

"12 oz. bottle purchased somewhere in NW D.C., dated 10/15/14, poured into my Snallygaster 2014 mug, drank over 30 minutes"

"I am not digging the caramel aspect of this one, it really ruins it for me.  Great spicy hops, though."

"Full of flavor!  Goes great with authentic German cuisine. Great balance of ingredients with no bitterness."

"M- light bodied and goes down with ease.  The munich malts are perfect in this one.  A great beer and would love it again"

"Best on draft. best oktoberfest made in US."

"Overall a great oktoberfest interpretation; maltier and stronger than many but still very clean and crisp flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of clean cereal notes is exactly what I would expect from the style. Taste is also dominated by cereal notes with light residual sugar with a clean finish. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Perfect example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: That's a good, tasty marzen, relying on malt and yeast to provide the bulk of the flavor profile, while spice and hops remain comfortably in the background."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Super drinkable. Good thing it's über available in ne ohio this time of year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent beer.  If you are looking for a typical Oktoberfest, this is not the right beer.  If you want something in the Oktoberfest style that is slightly more sophisticated, then this is a great choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- have to say this is my favorite Oktoberfest I've had yet. So for the style I rate this beer very highly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a clear, lighter amber color. There was a small off white head that left little lacing. Decent aroma. A bit of toasted malts. Possible some earthy hops also. No noticeable sweetness. The taste is decent. Toasted malts and slight biscuit notes. It has just a hint of bitterness and is very smooth. Nice!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was again, a great suggestion from the bartender at this establishment.  We are typically always on top of what we want to order from our beer spots, almost always before we even get there, but we were being so indecisive, so decided to go with this proposed offering, however widely available it is.  Again, we were not disappointed.  This is your quintessential southern German Oktoberfestbier.  The flavoring was beautifully balanced to a crisp malty push, although we did find a lacking of even the mildest hops, making for a highly sippable and enjoyable beverage to relax with.  This beer fits well with the change in the season to colder weather, and should satisfy the palate of any novice or expert alike."
""
""
"Overall: Best O'fest I've tried. Get you some!"
""
""
""
"Very good Oktoberfest.  Quite delicious."

"Pours a crystal clear copper amber with an lasting off white head. very light lacing. Aroma and taste of toasted grains, barley, malt with mild bitterness. A full flavored brew with a smooth medium body, good carbonation on the palate. Finishes with toasted grains and some moderate caramel malt comes thru as it warms up balanced with some light hops bitterness, ending has a lingering nutty flavor. Overall a very good and flavorful brew."
"my favorite in the style. Has more depth than most Octoberfests."

"O 3.5 - a little better than I remember. But I still find it to be overly sweet, which takes away from being able to drink more than one at a time - a quality I feel is necessary for the style. It's ABV of 6.5% also keeps it from being sessionable. I'll pass on this and go with others for Oktoberfests in the future."
"Very rich malty/slightly sweet /smell/taste/characteristic's yet the very light hoppy smooth tangy/zingy clean finish, just a great session-able beer imo.  People that are giving this low ratings/saying its bad are ignorant...."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a great example of a Marzen, instead of taking the bolder approach that most American brewery's do Great Lakes went very traditional with this one and they did a good job at showing what this style is all about, it might be hard to pick this one out among a few German examples of the style.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, fairly clean, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially if I was at a local Oktoberfest.  What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and just how true to style it was, it embodied what a good Marzen is all about.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't not a single thing that I disliked or that I thought was out of place.  I would buy this beer again, so far it's the only American made Marzen that I've had this season that I would go back and get a six pack of and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or just sessionable malty beers in general.  All in all I was impressed with this brew, Great Lakes took the path that not a lot of American brewery's take and in the end I think it really payed off from them and it resulted in one tasty brew.  So far it's up there as one of the better beers I've had from this brewery and so far it's my favorite American made Marzen.  Great job guys this, this was a very nice beer, keep up the hard work."
""
""
""
"I don't write reviews often but this one deserves the rare moment. I look forward to Marzen style beers and this is hands down the best one in America (of those I tried). It represents the style so perfectly I had to give it a five. Great Lakes never seems to disappoint and I very much appreciate their attention to detail when brewing a certain style especially old world ones. Don't pass this one up. I'll be purchasing this annually."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a rock-solid Märzen. I don't like it as much as the German Märzens that I've had, but I can't think of an American example that I prefer to this one. A great beer for autumn weather and probably my top pick for Oktoberfest celebrations when the store doesn't have any German Märzens in stock."
""
"9/6....pours low foam but pure copper. Clean and fresh looking. All malt nose. Taste is a malt bomb, toffee, caramel, bread, with a nice hop in between. A touch sweet on my palate, have had stronger Marzens. But certainly good,."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As lagers go, this is a very ""big"" beer.  When I started getting into craft beer, this was my hands-down favorite.  The last two times I have had it, it was too sweet for me.  Not cloying as I found Sam Adams (which has subsequently been less cloying) but very, very sweet."
""
""
""
"A lovely beer throughout. Easy to drink and the 6.5% is easy to overlook as this is just so good. I would have no problem putting back a few of these."
"Not sure if this year's release is particularly bad or what, my experience of this beer is a shadow of what everybody else seems to be tasting. Not many redeeming qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
"simple and straight to the point.  Not overdone, and well balanced.  If you are looking to try a seasonal Oktoberfest offering, you can't go wrong picking this one!"

"BBD 10/30/14.  Pours a clear amber with a nice dark ruby hue.  Good head and retention, rich excellent lacing.  Nice nose of malt - caramel, biscuit and a light spicy note.  Medium body with a creamy texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  Excellent flavor profile that is balanced and complex.  It begins with a toasted biscuit character which flows into caramel over a subtle note of sweetness. The middle is slightly bitter with a very nice touch of spice. The finish is clean, slightly sweet,  and a noble hop flavor lingers while the spice tickles the tongue.  Great Lakes has nailed it, again."

"Overall: Not a fan of most Oktoberfests and only have a couple when in season. With that said, this is definitely one of the better ones iv had. Good quality at a good price. What Great Lakes does best!"

"Had this on tap at the Village Anchor, my second review of a Great Lakes brew.  Outstanding Oktoberfest, one of my favorites.  Great molasses/maple/biscuit flavor, exactly how you'd want it.  I feel like sometimes these kinds of beers get a little syrupy to hit this kind of flavor, but there's none of that here.  The color here is a mix between orange and amber, darker than most, which is nice.  Soft mouthfeel, good amount of head.  Really good stuff."

"Yes balanced, but balanced nothingness.  Too sweet. I have never differed so much with BA and bros opinions.  The first Great Lakes beer I didn't particularly enjoy."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A delicious example of the Märzen style from Great Lakes. Balanced, earthy, lightly sweet with mild bitterness, but more importantly, extremely refreshing."
""
""
""
"Overall: As far as American-made Oktoberfests go, this is one of the best out there."
""
"It's hopped just right keeping the caramel in check, but certainly you wouldn't say this is hoppy.  Great Lakes does their approachable beers so well, and this is another winner."

"One of the best examples of the style I have had.  Bready, fresh, and malty.  I could definitely do a six of these."

"Pours copper orange with perfect clarity and some lager bubbles wafting up to the top.  Brilliant beer. Shines with fiery and  golden hues.  Creamy head of foam that lasts.  Sweet malty nose. A bit of depth a drizzle of honey. Noble hops give the faint scent of fresh hay.    Sweet biscuit.  Taste is simply lovely. Smooth, crisp , sweet malt.  Tantalizing with a faint bi t of honey. Small hop bit ion the back end.  Perfect dryness and a light graham cracker.  Faint grass in the last moments and this one is fantastic!"

"This was a ver nice, deep amber pour with a 1/2 finger of white head. I sensed a bit of cariander and lemon? on the nose. It was somewhat malt forward, but very pleasing to the taste. Nice balance. Medium on the mothfeel and a good carbonation throughout.., loving me some Great Lakes. Always consistently strong. Oktoberfest is not an exception."

"Marzen beers are maltier beers, my palate has become adapted to resinous hops this summer and it will be an adjustment of the palate. I have not been a fan of Great Lakes in the past because I felt like they put too much malt in their supposedly hoppier beers. On the contrary this beer is designed to be a maltier beer. Classical Marzen in that respect. This is a very nice representation of the style. I am not sure it is worth the 100 rating that BA gives it but it is a tasty brew. I look forward to trying more of this style this fall and comparing them to this one, which apparently is seen as one of, if not the best Oktoberfest beer produced in the US."

"O: [3.00] This is a nice summer evening beer.  The malty sweetness is the main draw here.  It is not something to go out of your way to get - but I would not turn one down."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep and clear amber. A great creamy off-white cap of head lasts well into the beer, aided by a steady stream of effervescence. The aroma is pretty weak, with some mild malt notes. The taste has some nice biscuit notes, a little caramel sweetness and a hint of earthiness. The body has a nice weight to it and there's a little bit of carbonation on the finish. This is a very good lager, but when compared to it's German cousins, it just comes up a little short for me."

"I know it's almost to early to think about the leaves changing colors, but this beer does just that. The amber color was clean and head great with nice lacing on the glass. Smell was nice and malty. On the front end the taste was smooth for a 6.5% beer and finished just as smooth. Overall a very nice for anyone looking to drink a good beer. I will get another six pack of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall, a fist pumping 4.25 is given to Great Lakes Oktoberfest from Great Lakes Brewing Co. I implore you to give this brew a chance. It blew me away, obviously. This brew will be a staple in my fridge during its circulation period."

"I'm mostly an IPA and Stout enjoyer (I know that's not a word}. It was one of the best last year and I actually think this year's brew may be better. Customer feedback was great, ordered one case last year sold all of it in one day. This year made it my beer of the week, sold 2 cases in 3 days...I should have order more than 5 cases. This is a must try!!"
"Overall this is definitely one of the better versions of the style I've seen on the market. I'll definitely be looking for this next fall and run to the store before it's all gone just like I do for their Christmas Ale."

"O: See first line."
""
"Back up the truck and stock up the fridge. Great tasting American Oktoberfest. Keep on hand and drink frequently. Repeat at will. Different than German Marzens but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall: Damn excellent American version of an Oktoberfest beer! Great balance between the malt, the sweet and the hops. Definitely getting a six-pack of this beer every fall"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Price point - $8.99/6 pk"
"Possibly the most enjoyable example of the style I've had to date! Refreshing and easy to drink. Plenty of complexity and character. Grab it if you see it - I know I will be travelling to bordering states to get my hands on this one next year!"
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable"
"Deep amber in color with a solid white head and a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Clear body. Bread and toasted malt aroma. Light floral noble hops. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A great and slightly unique example of the style. One of the best American-made Oktoberfest beers I have had to date. This was my first Great Lakes beer and I will certainly be trying others. Glad they are now being distributed in NJ."

"O: An excellent Oktoberfest. Great with a grilled cheese sandwich."

"I like what they did with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The alcohol was good too and although I only had one, it would be quite easy to have more than a few in a sitting. It's not easy to find an Octoberfest that isn't watered-down, generic, spicy, or chewy but this straddled all of those while having just enough to it to stand out. Even if there isn't any food around to pair it with, this is worth seeking out and enjoying on its own."

"Overall - great interpretation of the style, nothing like enjoying one on a nice fall evening"

"DATE TASTED: September 13, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Ayinger willibecker... OCCASION: first full week of school is done--and the power's back in our house...APPEARANCE: upward cascading bubbles uphold a thick, foam-laden off-white head; orange amber body conveys an Oktoberfest with nice tracings... AROMA: beautiful caramel malts; some flowery hops add balance; grassy undertones add to its earthy aroma...PALATE: mellow, medium-bodied and pleasantly drinkable; balanced between tongue and tooth...TASTE: sweet, buttery caramel and sugary/salty enough to force of a lick of the lips; a winning sweetness that makes this style rewarding... OVERALL: clean, crisp and fulfilling--an Oktoberfest can do little more to impress; outstanding may be a stretch, but the sum of its parts suggests this appellation..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorite Oktoberfest beers. Its not super complex but it's still very tasty."
""
"2013: Sampling this again against a dozen other Oktoberfests, this one came out in my personal top 3. Very fresh and true to style with it's own unique nutty malt character, and lingering flavors. Highly recommended for an American Oktoberfest that upholds tradition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm a fan. This is probably my favorite Oktoberfest beer I've had so far. I've had a bunch, like Staghorn as well as the typical Munich brewers' takes- Hofbräu, Hacker, etc. and this holds up pretty well to the German examples. I'm guessing that this is as good as it gets in the USA."
""
""
""
""
""
"They did the right balance on this. Although an experiment of a bigger version would be cool, it just wouldn't be so drinkable. I think during the Indians playoff game tomorrow I will drink several of these and see it they are as drinkable as it seems."
""
""
""
""
"Try it for sure!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A charm to drink, there are so many Oktoberfests out there and this one stacks up in my opinion. A full-bodied flavor profile makes tasting this a pleasure."
""
""
""
"The beer pours an off white and slightly tan foam head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a beautiful clear copper with a slight orange note to it. The beer smell is sweet and caramel. The strong malt smell also gives off a slight honey scent. The beer taste is similar to the smell. Strong caramel notes with a side of honey, but also has a slight hoppy twist at the end of it, which is pretty good. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and with very little carbonation. The beer finishes a bit smooth and viscous like honey. Overall, a very good Oktoberfest and one worth getting when available."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great autumn beer, the flavor profile and artwork will get you in the mood for October and the beers that come along with it. Recommended if you're looking for an Octoberfest brew."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good stuff, meng. Served too cold, with a smallish, cream-colored head and good lacing. Aroma was almost nonexistent probably due to my low ability to smell, so all I can do is give benefit of the doubt. Color is a clear copper amber. Flavor's very nice and to me, so important for an Oktoberfest, not too sweet. It is malty, bread, cracker, some tang, hint of bitter, roast, and dry. Body/carbonation excellent esp. considering temperature. Finish is like flavor, average length, very easy drinking. Solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"I have adjusted the rating up, maybe slightly higher than I feel overall, but that is due to style considerations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this beer is outstanding. The flavors are robust, it doesn't disappoint. If you like beers with heavy malt, this is the one to try. This is the best Oktoberfest I have tried so far."

"After reading the reviews, I was on the lookout. Nice version of the classic German Marzen. The colder the better I found for this bottle. I was anxious and opened the first one a tad early. Once it cooled down it was super. Was really crisp at the right temperature. Eager to try it on tap."
""
"O: Perfectly blanced. an easy drinking marzen; a true standout. /92"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'd out this one near the top of the style, up there with Ayinger, and probably the best American version I've tried. Lots of fruity notes with the toasted, sweet malty flavors expected of the style"
""
""
"My favorite Oktoberfest of them all. Yes, I am quite biased in favor of Great Lakes Brewing Company because one of my best friends worked there for nine years and I've spent many a fine afternoon/evening at the place. But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: This is unusual. Why? Because it's not a marzen I want to chug - it's a marzen I want to savor. How Great Lakes crams so much fruity flavor into their lagers, I'll never know. I'd put this up near the top of all the oktoberfest beers I've ever sampled. If my last review said I wouldn't have minded getting a six pack of the beer in question (ST's 2XRYE), then I'll state in this I kind of wish I got a six pack instead of a single."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not much of a fan of oktoberfests to begin with, but even by oktoberfest standards, this is unremarkable. The peculiar juiciness is distracting, and there's just not much else there to gravitate toward. Perhaps my least favorite offering from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-definitely a great example of the style, definitely something I could quaff liters of if at a festival. Has a good raw beer flavor more so than some oktoberfests and is also a bit more bitter than most."
""
""
"O- I think this may be my favorite American brewed Marzen. and very reasonably priced"
""
""
"O: Great oktoberfest here. A definite must try."
""
"If I could only have one Oktoberfest beer during the autumn months, this would be it. I think it smelled even better in recent years, but otherwise everything comes together just about perfectly here. It smells of toasted malt and toffee. The malt provides flavors of bread, caramel, toffee, and grass, and the hops add just enough bitterness to balance the sweetness from the malt. This is medium bodied with active carbonation that makes it crisp. Overall, this isn't an overly powerful beer, but it is nicely balanced and is complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A rich, full flavor brew with wonderful toasted malt character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear amber with long lasting, foamy white head. Aroma is of noble hops and caramel malt. Body is full and smooth. Caramel malt and some cherry are balanced on the palate by herbal hops. Finish is long, semi-dry. Nice Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was completely blown away with this one. Some nice sweetness to it and great toasted bread notes. Such a pleasant surprise even from the first taste."
"I just had a Flying Fish Oktober Fish last week, I'd say this Great Lakes version is much better. If I could choose an Oktoberfest to rest upon this Fall, this would be the one."
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: I wouldn't call this outstanding, but I'd consider it very good. First, the feel -- medium mouthfeel, with a nice carbonation to it that is nearly perfect and my favorite part of this Oktoberfest. The beer itself is perfectly true to the style, except for the fact that I get a mild alcohol flavor on the end that puts me off just a little bit. A touch sweeter than it is bitter, which I like in my Oktoberfests. A super solid example of the style, and my first Oktoberfest of the year. Tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A bit disappointed in this beer as I prefer my Marzens with more carmelized roasted malt character with a bit more body."

"Though a bit one-dimensional, Great Lakes makes a great 'fest that's rich and full of flavor. This is going on my short list of top Oktoberfest beers."
"Taste is almost like the smell sweet malt caramel and light toasted bread. Light spiciness of noble hops also gives so earthiness to this beer. Finishes dry making you want another drink."

"Not my favorite style, and perhaps the fact this is a different take makes it as good of fall seasonal as I've had. Very drinkable, very enjoyable"
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable, a nice example of the style."
"D - Not a bad Marzen / Oktoberfest by any means, however, I'm not sure this one leaves up to the high expectations I had for it based on my fellow BAs ratings... I'll have no issue getting through the sixer that I have in the fridge, but there are more than a handful of other style brethren (both German and domestic) that I would opt for over this one when given the choice..."

"I love this beer, and want to buy it every year."

"O=Enjoyable, but too sweet and light...I still have the other 5 bottles of the 6-pack and will try 1-2 by themselves, and use the rest to make snakebites. A tamer version of the märzen style, and better than many, but not really comparable to German offerings."

"Loverly orange creature, thick oily lacing and ample head. The nose is nice, the taste is fantastic; malt, hops, grains, dried hay (yes, I taste dried hay!), pepper - very nice brew. Slightly oily moutfeel on this wonderful beverage. This is a beautiful beer, grab one if you get a chance."
"Very appropriate fall tastes and smells come alive in this Oktoberfest beer and it's certainly worth a crisp cool night to try it."

"Tasty Oktoberfest, but I can't figure out why the community would rate this higher than most Germans. A very good stab at it for craft beer."

"O: Great Lakes hasn’t disappointed me yet. Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is my favorite, but this Oktoberfest comes in a close second. If you enjoy the Marzen - Oktoberfest style then this one is a “must try”. Too bad my local beverage outlet couldn’t get this in a 1/6th keg for me, so I had to settle with buying a case."

"This is so good. I'm not sure if there's a better Oktoberfest on the market today; at least not one that I've tried. The smell is very, very light, and I can only make out something bready. However, it works so well with the sweet and spicy taste. It really is excellent. I will definitely get this again."

"Beautiful dark orange, copper color with small off-white head and little lacing. Aroma has nice mixture of caramel malts, sweet fruitiness, and light hops. Flavor is great- smooth and malty, with sweet caramel, light spices, and a light fruitiness. Medium body with light carbonation. Great all around- one of the freshest bottles I've had, drinking this the first week it's out! Way too early for Fall, but it's delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Again, simply the benchmark for this style of beer. If your into Marzens try this one it will not disappoint. Cheers!!"
""
"Pours a deep amber with a thick 2 finger off white head. Lacing all over the glass as I drink it. This thing smells like the fall, lots of brown sugar and spices. Sweet roasted caramel. The taste is quite good as well. The malt is sweet but has a nice round edge of earthyness. This is one of the best Oktoberfest beers you can find. It's as drinkable with maximum flavor as you can get. Add to that the great price at 8.99 a sixer and you got a winning fall release. My only complaint is its far to early to have this out sitting on the shelves. Mid August would do just fine. Hopefully they will keep releasing this until the end so fresh batches are still circulating."
""
""
"O- This is one of my personal favorites from Great Lakes. I drink a lot of these and you should too."
""
"Autumn seasonal with an est. 195 calories per bottle and 6.5% ABV. An amber lager with the flavor of a slight herbal/ grassy taste. I am rating this low because it isn't one of my favorite styles. I would recommend if your a fan of amber lager, but I would not go out of my way to buy again. The aftertaste is almost as bitter as an IPA."

"Overall - Not a bad Oktoberfest beer."

"I'm not too well versed in O-fests or Marzens, but this beer is great. In fact, it's quite a bit different than many of the other Oktoberfests I have had, very ambiguous yet very familiar all at the same time. A nice collection of flavors from the abundance of malts, this beer also makes a nice winter warmer, if you can hold onto it for that long."
"Overall, a very good example of the style. Malt complexity is spot on, and the warmth is a welcome accompaniment. The citrus flavor is a touch overdone."

"Among the cacophony of Johann Schrammel blaring in the background and the merry yells of the festival crowds, she crosses your sight. She’s a voluptuous beauty who’s had her share of brezen, weisswurts, and obatzda, but she perfectly fills out her dirndl in full. Among all these Marzens, what is it about this one that has you hiding the bulge in your lederhosen? Her dark copper color helps her stand out from the rest as she pours into your glass with the thickness you expected. As soon as you bring her to your lips, she surrounds you with a warm comfort, both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time; her aroma matches evenly with her sweet taste. She is ready for fun and her hearty laugh makes you smile with each sip. After unraveling the strings on her dirndl blouse and voraciously dropping to her knees, you are overwhelmed with her lascivious mouthfeel but also a looming sorrow: this tryst will last but a few days. Alas, Octoberfest wasn’t meant to last all year, so grab her by her thick curves and dive in head first. You might as well: she’s been patiently waiting for you all year with a tankard in one hand and a motel key in the other. As the bacchanalia comes to a close, she quietly slips away into the Munich night; the memories of the copious merriment she leaves behind can only find their match in grandeur in the moist spot she left behind on the bed you shared."
""
"Overall, I want to like this beer but it is just too sweet approaching cloying. It drinks stronger than its 6.5% and is more of a sipper. My idea of an oktoberfest is a flavorful beer than can be drunk in liters and this isn't it."
"Flavor starts with a slight herbal/ grassy flavor that gives way to a sweeter caramel malt and slightly metallic finish. The feel is extremely creamy and enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours a clear amber color topped by a tight, creamy looking head that leaves sticky rings behind before the first sip. Clean aromas of mild sweet bread and subtle earthiness. Sweet malty flavor - again, clean and lagery. Dough, some toast, nuttiness, and a flicker of leafy hops. Medium bodied and nicely smooth with fine, tingly carbonation. A bit on the strong side for the style, but I think I could suck down a liter or two without much trouble."
"The beer is orange with a small white head. The aroma offers sweet malts, lager scents - smells appropriate for the style, albeit a bit sweet. The flavor is ok. A bit grainy and sweet, but also flavorful and enjoyable. Notes of gourds, squash. A tad syrupy on the palate with moderately low carbonation. Overall, a pretty good example of the style, although one was plenty."
""
""
""
"O - Great Lakes has struck gold with their spot-on rendition of this German lager which expertly marries different malts which blend to perfection with superb drinkability but are also allowed to develop and contribute different nuances. It's rich without being over-the-top; a hearty, malty Oktoberfest which demands you drink it by the liter!"
"Mouthfeel: True medium body with complexity. A refreshing lightness flanks the palate."
"Pours a medium amber with a foamy, 1/2 inch off-white head. Lasts for a while and there is a fair amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is really extraordinary. A strong hint of sweet fruit, chocolate, malt -- really nice. The taste is also sweet -- hints of raisin or dark chocolate. Hoppy. Very clean, crisp taste. Perfect for a Marzen. I find with Oktoberfests, carbonation is the X factor in making a brew a hit or a miss. The carbonation in this one is really pretty perfect -- just a really pleasant, solid beer. Very easy to drink."

"Flavor is full of wonderful toasted biscuits, nuts, and subtle spice. I have no words to describe how good this beer is.. Medium body with a lighter touch of carbonation, and incredibly smooth. There is a lingering toasted caramel flavor in the finish that sits in the corners of your mouth and under your tongue. I want more.. I need more. The best Märzen that I have ever had, by far."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 10/6/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention; that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, biscuit, toast, herbal, floral, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of biscuit, toast, caramel, pear, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, pear, herbal, and grass on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; fairly clean finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is a highly excellent Oktoberfest. Great flavor balance and very smooth to drink. An easy winner."

"I poured this one into a perfect pint, it has a nice golden brown body with not a lot of head that quicky lays down to a thin lace. The smell is inviting of carmel and malt and some hops with a hint of clove. The taste is well balanced, taste of sweet malt up front then the spicy bitter hops comes through in the finish. The mouth feel is great, smooth and creamy and well carbonated. Overall this is a great beer, defintly the best marzen i have had so far."

"D/O Overall this is a fine example of the style. The drinkability is very good as are most beers of this style. I believe that part of the idea of this style is to be very drinkable. 4.5"
"Smells of rich malts,strong for a lager, bits of spice and clove. The taste is a malt explosion with tons of hop and spice. Smooth and medium bodied, lots of flavor, and taste. This is a fantastic Marzen, wow, what flavor and complexity this beer has. this is a damn good lager,gotta try it if Marzen's are your taste."
"O: GL brew exceptional beers and they do lagers just about better than anyone. GL okto is no exception its down right tasty. I'm upset that I didn't spring for another sixer. One of the best Oktoberfest beers I've ever had."
"Really good. So much going on, but all the pieces fit together so well. Awesome example of the style."
"Overall, this is true to style but also unique. Toastier than most Oktoberfests, and also more bitter, but just as easy to drink with plenty of the Autumn malt character you would want."
"O - Definitely my favorite Marzen of the 7 or 8 I have tried this season. Previously it was Brooklyn Octoberfest, but this one does the job well. It has unique flavor that I've come to expect from Great Lakes. Another great beer from them."
"O- overall an incredible oktoberfest, and the best I've had in the style in a long time. Don't expect this to blow your mind in the way a crazy imperial kitchen-sink beer will - this is more subtle but incredibly satisfying...an excellent brew all around and one I'll certainly be revisiting annually. Perhaps the sum is greater than the parts on this one, as the overall score is higher than all of the other categories except appearance."
"O: I've had the opportunity to try a lot of quality Marzens this season and this is certainly in the top tier. It has a lot of character and depth, especially for the style."
"Slightly disappointing. Perhaps this one was brewed too early in the season and it's showing signs of shelf abuse. A casualty of the creeping-earlier-each-year seasonal beer release epidemic? I would consider trying this again on draft, or at least closer to the bottling date."
"Pours out a copper hue with a nice foamy white head that has really wonderful lacing and retention in a medium bodied beer that has fairly good amount of carbonation it it. The smell is the usual Oktoberfest of caramel, grains, and fruits. The taste starts out with a nice mix of caramel, fruits (apples and pears), grass, and sweet breads with hints of hops that stay from the first sip til the end of the drink. A very well balanced and very smooth, crisp, clean easy to drink beer with a dry finish to it. Overall this is the best Oktoberfest beer I have tasted and highly recommended for anyone that wants a great Oktoberfest beer from one of the best breweries around."
"overall this is a nice o-fest type of lager. it's nice to have great lakes available in my area...and even though it's a bit more spendy than the usual suspects i usually quaff, it's nice to be able to try new twists on a style that can get rather boring to me after awhile. recommended."
"O: I call bullshit on the B+ overall average. This is my new fall go - to, non-pumpkin beer for sure!"
"I give two Schlitz for this well-done lager. Prosit!"
"Great Lakes Oktoberfest is a super clear, sparkling, amber lager with a thin, soft, dense, yellowish head that has excellent retention and lacing. It smells like bread and pretzels. There's a medicinal or minty note to it. There's a fruity whiff to it, kind of like apples. It's medium bodied and quite smooth with a sharp, lively finish. It leaves the palate pretty clean. The flavor hovers between sweet and dry, with malt taking the center stage. It's a little resiny, melanoidal, fruity and medicinal. The flavors come together pretty well and nothing seems out of balance. This is one of the most sessionable Oktoberfests I can recall drinking."
"Its October and I am trying Great Lakes Oktoberfest and it is...OK. No question it is a Marzen style beer. The appearance is a rich clear amber with thick white head that is lacing nicely. There is not much smell other than typical...sweet malt, grain. The taste is ok...not sure if I like the sweetness or not. There is a nice malt base that helps to keep the beer grounded. The ABV initially is a bit much, but after a few swigs one begins to settle in. 6.5% is a bit much for a Marzen so the mouthfeel is downgraded slightly. Overall its decent....better than most."
"O - Great easy drinking oktoberfest. Although this isn't my favorite style I can really see why so many love this brew."
"A very good example of the American Oktoberfest style."
"O: Easy drinker. Great one to curl up with on a cold evening. This is what an Oktoberfest should be like. Well worth the effort to seek this one out."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and goes down easily. Medium bodied, good carbonation levels. Overall, a good brew. Reviewed the bottled version earlier, and really don't think there's many differences. The draft smells better, but doesn't look as good. Either way, a great Oktoberfest that is readily available in my area, and I'm definitely appreciative of that."
"O: The appearance of this beer was outstanding. Beautiful! The nose was mild but interesting. The flavor was full of character. The beer was very drinkable too. The Victory Festbier wasn't bad, but this was better. One of my new favorites."
"All in all, I have tried many Oktoberfests and have only really cared for a handful of them. This is one of that handful."
"O: This is great stuff. I've really come to appreciate this style during this season, largely due to this beer. This is my go-to fall beer for sure. I wouldn't change a thing."
"An easy beer to drink, not to heavy and not overly strong. Luckily I have five more to drink."
"O - It has the malty and rich flavor, yet it packs a punch at the back of your tongue that keeps you coming back for more. This version says, ""step yo' game up"" to other versions of the fall classic. This is one of the best I've tried and I'd give it a big hell ya."
"O-Very good beer. has great balance and flavor. Provides alot of different flavors without allowing one to overwhelm the other and remains extremely drinkable. Highly recommend"
"O: One of the better oktoberfest's out this year. Balanced and delicious. Would like some more sweet malty flavors, but a very good beer."
"Overall: A very full flavored and well balanced Marzen. One of the best American versions out there."
"Overall: A good solid beer fall beer in a classic style."
"Brilliantly clear orange amber color with limited head retention. Toasty and sweet malt aromas carry over very accurately to the palate, with sweet and toasty malt flavors that are balanced very well by slight bitterness. The sweet aftertaste lingers a bit but tapers off before becoming cloying. Moderate carbonation makes this very pleasant, easy drinking beer with a very rewarding flavor profile."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is a good representation of the style."
"This is the best Marzen I have sampled this autumn or any other."
"O: An easy quaffer, but one with some flavor. Probably what every Octoberfest should be."
"O- Glad I picked up a six pack . Only way it could get better would be if i was in a beer garden on a fall day."
"o - goes down easy, could probably drink a few in a sitting. might not be the best of the great lakes offerings, but it's still a solid beer. definitely one of the better fall seasonals i have had this year. would certainly buy it again."
"O - A delicious example of the style, it pairs well with grilled sausages and kraut. It's next to impossible to only drink one at a sitting. As good as it is from the bottle, it's even better on draft. While I enjoy the summer wheats, I'm always chomping at the bit to get to the Autumn beers, and this one dominates as a fridge favorite because it's fuller and more complex than many of its brethren. It's outstanding."
"More aggressive and complex than most others of the style, I think it's delightful."
"O- A really enjoy this beer. That said, it comes through a lot better in my opinion on tap. Still worthy out of the bottle."
"Overall, this is one of the best Oktoberfest beers I have ever had. I've always thought that Great Lakes was slightly overrated, as they have never really impressed me other than their Edmond Fitzgerald Porter, but this beer makes me understand how great they are. I will respect them more from now on and be more open to try their beers."
"Drinkability – This is easily the best Oktoberfest beer manufactured in the US that I have ever had the pleasure to consume. It’s simple, straight to the point, on style, and literally transported me back to Munich."
" This is one of the strongest Oktoberfest style beers I've had at 6.5% ALC/VOL. Although you don't notice it right away because its has been masked behind some big bold flavors."
" If you haven't ever been to the Great Lakes Brewing Co. in Cleveland it's a must as you walk in it gives an immediate feel of comfort that the german gausthaus does. Next time we go I plan on getting a room for the night to do a little more drinking."
"Great Lakes Oktoberfest pours a crystal clear burnt orange, lightening in spots to straight orange when held up to light. There's about two fingers of ivory foam topping the beer, but it fades quickly and without a trace. The nose has prominent notes of toasted bread and nuts, with some caramel and a lightly herbal/spicy hop presence in the mix as well. Those four fill out the flavor profile as well. The hops are a bit more subdued, the caramel a bit elevated, and bitterness is barely there, but the general idea from the aroma is the same. The mouthfeel is just a little bit too crisp, which I'm chalking up to a body that's a touch on the light side. I'd like the beer to be a bit more rounded and full. A solid beer from Great Lakes, I'd drink this one again."
"Sits atop my list of beers of this style. Perfect for a mid-September's night in the midwest."
"Very tasty, alcohol is well hidden. This reminds me of Ginger Snaps or Boston Brown Bread. The sweetness is perfect-any more and it would be cloying. Noble style Hops stay in the background and present balance. Thick bready malt provides a solid foundation for this excellent beer."
"Just doesn't seem well constructed to me. Flavors aren't that well integrated and the malt profile is not terribly complex. Doesn't strike me as an exceptional example of the style. This one really doesn't do it for me."
"I'm sure a lot of people can fix in their minds this as their perfect beer, but for a brewer to actually pull it off is something different. Bravo, gentleman!"
"D: this is a delicious beer and very drinkable, perfect for fall, it is sweeter than many of the oktoberfests I have had and it is one of if not the best of them"
"Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and easy to drink. 6.5% ABV is masked, turning this into a dangerous session seasonal lager. Great brew to have from the bottle or on draft!"
"Overall, this was a solid oktoberfest offering. Good, but nothing overly special about it. Would have loved more some more body on this beer."
"one good marzen."
"O: a decent Marzen, though a bit on the bland and watery side for my tastes. Still, not a bad beer."
"I really should probably complete an entirely new review, but in the interest of time, and the fact that while I hope some have found a review or two of mine useful, they're mainly to help me keep track of beers I've had. Having said all of that, my previous score for GL Oktoberfest was a 3.63. After having enjoyed this fine beer again a year later, the experience was quite a bit different. This was one of best Oktoberfests I've had the pleasure of drinking. I do not believe my palate has changed that much in a year. Perhaps the beer last year was past it's prime. Whatever the case, this beer had wonderful balance, feel, and top notch drinkability. Excellent beer...."
"D/O: With the exception of a touch of fruitiness, a very clean and drinkable Oktoberfest; hard to believe it 6.5%... Probably my favorite Oktoberfest to date -"
"Easy drinking, and tasty."
"Overall: Absolutely perfect for this time of year. Its starting to get a little colder and you need a little more weight than all those easy-drinking summer beers. Don't jump into the dark stuff just yet, Great Lakes Oktoberfest is filling the slot in the end of lager season."
"not bad, more toasty sweet than malty. Not sure why everyone loves this so much, i mean, its good, but not great. Which is surprising since i really liked their vienna lager."
"O- Very easy drinking beer. Great beer for the fall and one of the best if not the best Oktoberfest I have ever had."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is a style that has grown on me some over the years, and this is one of the best that I've had. I can't resist throwing a couple in my mixed sixers everytime I'm at the store."
"For fans of the style, seek this out."
"This beer pours a bright golden color. The head is one inch of rocky bright white foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of bready malt, minerals, and mild noble hops. The taste is malty, but not overpowering. There is a nice lingering breadiness with some toffee, and a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really good Oktoberfest that I will surely drink again."
"M: The beer is bold, a rich lager perfect for the on-coming crispness in the air. As for tonight, it held up well during a rain storm too."
"Overall, a very, very good Octoberfest. Perhaps the best I've had to date. Excellent effort by Great Lakes."
"O: Great Lakes Oktoberfest is a damn near perfect example of the style. The roasty bitterness I associate with the style is balanced by a mild toffee and honey sweetness that makes this beer a very enjoyable experience and, dare I say it, quite sessionable. Great job, Great Lakes."
"Overall: Best Oktoberfest-style beer I've had so far, and a fantastic fall seasonal. Supremely drinkable, flavorful, sessionable.... just good all around. Get it!"
"Flavor is very good and represents the style nicely."
"Sampled from a bottle, best before October 21, 2011. Light copper orange in color with a reddish hue and excellent clarity. Pored with a frothy white foam that lasted from beginning to end that leaves wet lacings on the glass. Earthy, bready malt aroma, along with hints of ripe fruit, light floral and citrus hops. Smooth, delicate and mellow feel with assertive carbonation d and a light, biting tanginess at the finish. Earthy, munich malt flavors, light floral hop character and a delicate fruitiness combine nicely from beginning to end. Finishes semi-dry with a light biscuity and sweet bready aftertaste. Mellow and delicate with nice aromas, texture and flavors."
"Overall one of the better American interpritations of the style. A great Oktoberfest with that full body that most lack."
"The beer is a beautiful copper color and reminded me of the first beer I had in Germany 30 years ago. Not the same style of beer, but the same experience. Wonderful, smooth and easy to drink. I am not a hop head, so this is a great beer for me. The great mouthfeel and refreshing finish brought memories of Munich. My first bucket list entry is to be there for Oktoberfest. Trink, trink..Bruderlein trink!"
"This one gets better as it gets warmer. The flavors are really malty and complex. A very solid fall beer. One that I look forward to drinking again in the future."
"O: Overall, a disappointment. I actually prefer Eliot Ness to this, as it has a bit more of a sharper flavor profile. Quite honestly, this just tastes like an average lager to me. I'll give it a B, but no more."
"This is a fine Oktoberfest, tons of great and traditional flavor and aroma characteristics and a very nice introduction to the fall."
"I won't waste anyones time with my awful ASTMO notes. What I will say is that this was the third Marzen I enjoyed that evening and it was by far the best. In terms of quality, I liken the GLBC Oktoberfest to Spaten. Compared to many other Oktoberfest beers, this one has a depth that can accompany you into the chilly nights of fall."
"O: A classic. Best American version of this I have seen. GL continues to amaze me. They have tied Founders in my book as having the most solid lineup of amazing beers in their stable. Great!"
"Great Lakes has really been a favorite brewery of mine, so I was so exited to try their Oktoberfest, it did not disappoint"
"This is always the first Oktoberfest I grab when the season hits."
"O - Such a simple beer, but everything is done so well and it drinks so easy. I'll definitely buy this again."
"The label describes this beer as ""the noble brother of the Vienna lager"" and that's a great way to describe it. This will be a nice complement to the other malty/sweet marzens that you'll be enjoying in the fall."
"Mouth feel and overall - The Growler pour tastes a little more alcoholic than the bottled version I remember from last year. I anticipate finding this years bottle release. Crisp and refreshing. Light bodied mostly except for randomntastes of stronger alcohol."
"I'm going to pick this up again soon."
"This year's version of Great Lakes Oktoberfest is absolutely GLORIOUS! It actually is a bit less aggressive than year's past, but in a great way, as Oktoberfests needn't be overly aggressive. Pours a copper, oft reddish colour, with some thin lacing down the glass. Head sticks for about 30 seconds, then creeps down. Smells of burnt caramel and some slight bread-like, toffee. Tastes outstanding. Very malty with some bitterness to balance, though mainly malty. Smooth, creamy mouth feel, very clean and crisp. You wonder where it went! Drinkability is great and I need to be careful. This beer is lethal! CHEERS and glad it's almost fall!"
"AMAZING, MUST TRY!"
"I had this yesterday on tap in Louisville at Maggy Malone's. It arrived a light bodied rich pumpkin orange in color with a one finger soft and creamy off white head. It gave aromas of light caramel malts, light bready malts, a light hop bitterness, and a nice touch of honey. It had a great nose for an Oktoberfest. The flavors mimicked the aromas and it was very appealing for the style. It was a little bolder than the every day Marzen. It was really apparent how fresh the keg was, having just arrived a few days earlier. The flavors were sharp and on point. It drank very light and was ultimately smooth. This was definitely aided by being on draft. Overall, this is a damn fine Marzen. Grab it while it's fresh!"
"One of the best Oktoberfest brews I've ever had."
"Overall one of the best fall seasonal I've had. Very drinkable. I'll definitely put this in my rotation."
"O: Overall it is my fave beer style and was a bit put out as Great Lakes usually do things very good and well received but this one while good on the average is still a bit light for me."
"Great Lakes Oktoberfest is an amber colored lager, with a frothy white head as its crown. The aroma is a spot on marzen nose, rich malts, kind of yeasty, maybe a touch of hops in the background. Wow, the flavor explodes onto the scene the minute it hits the tongue. Very nice and rich malts, fairly spicy hops, somewhat bready, a bit earthy. Very full mouthfeel."
"Notes - For the style this is the best, hands down, I have ever had. It is just the odd grassy note I get that is keeping me from saying it is world class, but otherwise I really do enjoy it. I buy a sixer every fall and am happy to do so. Great falltime party beer as well."
"Notes: This beer is moderate in body, full of flavor, and incredibly balanced. At 6.5% ABV, it's hardly noticeable. Drinkability is awesome! This might be my favorite American interpretation of the style to date. An amazing brew."
"Despite my gripes, this beer is still a first-rate example of the style. Delicious. I will buy this again. It is my favorite domestic Oktoberfest."
"O - I have had a few Oktoberfest brews in my life, and I must say I can't name one off the top of my head that tastes better. It's a world class marzen/oktoberfest brew. A slight resemblance to their Vienna Lager, but a lot different when it comes down to the experience. GLBC does it again! and then again with this one. This is my Oktoberfest of choice. When I buy this style it will be GLBC."
"Overall - A very good Marzen, perfect for fall."
"D: glad im already kicking off the ofest season! good drinking beer, but there are some other oktoberfests im a bigger fan of."
"Overall a great tasting beer. Great Lakes pulls it off again. Kudos to you!"
"Notes - What is amazing absent is the alcohol. I do not taste anything resembling alcohol, and I am actually very happy about that!"
"O- Very good. Great Lakes does a great job, and I think I'll certainly come back to this one. This brew has great taste."
"D - Very drinkable Oktoberfest. Another great brew from Great Lakes. I recommend this brew and will for sure get it again."
"T. This has a unique, very strong almost grape sweet taste to it. Rye aftertaste. Very nice blend of fruitiness and bitter hops."
"D - Highly drinkable; this and Ayinger are my favorite Oktoberfests this year."
"One of my favorite oktoberfest beers. Wish they made it year round"
"Beer has a medium body, nice American style of a German Märzen, good session beer. Bought at Total Wine in Greensboro, North Carolina, (High Point) approximately late Fall 2010. Drank mid January 2011 and still fairly nice. Give it up to Great Lakes."
"12oz bottle usually poured into dimple glass. Pours a nice solid golden color, not quite copper, but note quite straight ""gold."" The nose gives the first indication that this example is going to be stylistically excellent. Hints of rich malt and a touch of German noble hops come through. Flavors coming through on the palate are equally splendid. Munich malty goodness is prevalent, rendering one with the feeling of walking through a beer garden in Munich. The finish is medium-dry, allowing for a high level of drinkability. An extremely well-crafted German seasonal. My favorite overall domestic Oktoberfest."
"D: Extremely drinkable; it's surprising that this one is even 6.5% alcohol. Sweet tastes are never overwhelming and couple perfectly with Ohio's autumn weather (and probably Germany's too)."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear, orange color with two fingers of khaki-colored head with some rusty highlights. The retention was so-so, the lacing quite thin, to my surprise. The aroma was of sweet malt, caramel malt and some lights spices including hints of vanilla. The flavors were a combination of toasted malt, dry grains, some chewy, bread-like malts and a bit of biscuits. The hops did follow through in the end but had trouble keeping up with the array of malts. Still, given that this is a malt-heavy style of beer I had to admire the emphasis and depth of the malts on display. The mouthfeel was slick, the body medium and the carbonation medium/low."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability was good, it was a flavorful but easy drinking beer. It was a good version of the style as well. Pretty solid beer all around."
"D: Robust, but not overly so, this has great heft and depth while being amazingly rounded and balanced. A bit hop forward for the style, but richly malty too. Maybe done a bit for a US palate, but this is close enough to style, goes down easy, and is sure to get the party started."
"A quite attractive entry into the O-Fest category from Great Lakes. Light orange / amber in color, fairly clear look, with a moderately dense, well-composed head. Laces with authority. Bit of a light cheesy quality to the extensively toasted grain aroma. Not overly malty and certainly no significant hop notes to smell, either, though some fruitiness shows through in the scent as well. The Munich malt does shape the profile of the flavor, which, as I mentioned before, isn't heavily malty, but does display some biscuit / spice wafer qualities, that mysterious grassy cheesiness, and finishes with an apple sweetness and tiny medicinal burst in the very end. Carbonation is above-average, thinning its medium body a bit. A thin-syrupy, malty ""tang"" lingers in the back and sides of the mouth. Pretty good all-around."
"Awesome color. Very clear orangish copper color. Head fades, light speckled face cover lingers. Maltiness in aroma. Oddly enough pick up a heavy vegetably peppery smell. Some breadiness from malt and some very sight orange. On inhale of beer in throat, pick up a big hint of jello (maybe cherry). Same thing on actual flavor. Some breadiness, some lagery sweetness, but still predominantly jello, coud be something in the growler perhaps. Not much to say about this one, but not my favorite octoberfest."
"One of the best US Oktoberfests. Next year a sixer instead of just a single."
"A very clear, quiet looking beer with a light copper color and a minor white cover. The lacing is pretty mediocre. The aroma is a sort of swampy-skunk bread with earthy peanut malt. A bit odd to say the least, perhaps a little scary. Fortunately it translates into a perfectly fine Oktoberfest burst of malty flavor. Over the malt I get leafy hop and a hint of bready toffee that provides a classic German idea that is medium bodied, crisp and easy drinking. I find this to be a very enjoyable brew and a great session choice for the autumnal months."
"D: Very good."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not the best Fall brew I have ever had, but decent. Good session beer if you have access. Otherwise, don't bother."
"D-very high, sorry I only have a six of this, have to get more next fall"
"I like sweet Marzens. While this beer isn't strongly sweet the heavy body and low bitterness allow the malt and touch of hops to follow through nicely."
"I know the Bros gave this an A+ but I know what my palate likes and I've for sure had better Oktoberfests, this one was just a little weak to me."
"D: Easy drinking. Its malty, but the balance is so good that it goes down fast and easy."
"Good, except for the high ABV."
"D= What is this honey? I dunno how much I like this as an Oktoberfest but as a honey beer it's great."
"This is one of those beers that would get me in trouble. If I had more of them, I'd drink the everloving shit out of 'em."
"Pours a brilliant orange with tan one-finger head. Clear as day. Nose is perfection, as usual with Great Lakes. A balanced essence of dark fruity hops, malt, and yeast. Taste begins with carbonation slightly hiding malt sweetness, hops bitterness is perfectly balanced. Dryish finish with bready aftertaste. Crisp mouthfeel. Highly quaffable."
"Spot-on for the style. Malt-forward with moderate sweetness, some bready notes within a caramel malt maincurrent. Judicious use of hops provides balance toward the end. I can see an oompah band and liters of this going together quite nicely. Bring on the bratwurst!"
"This is a very good Oktoberfest - would love to pick up a case of this if I see it."
"Taste, delicate spice, maybe even pumpkin in the most minute degree you start to think, even though you're fairly certain it really isn't there. Sweetness seemed to be more than desireable. This one was not exactly pie, but made me think of pie. Seems almost like an imperial version of an Octoberfest, or all the others I've had were just weak versions. I dunno, don't drink enough of the style to really give a super informed opinion. I like most of the Great Lakes beers, this one was no different."
"A terrific example of the style, I am a huge fan of the beers of fall, and Great Lakes definately delivers the goods..."
"Very nice interpretation."
"The drinkability is excellent. I put 5 away during a party a few weeks back before saving this one to review properly. A very easy drinking but tasty marzen."
"D: A solid Oktoberfest from a solid brewery. I really enjoyed this lager."
"Brew is thick flavorful, unlike any octoberfest I have had. Very sessionable and has a nice alcohol kick. Very good stuff, the best stand out octoberfest I have tried."
"I hope that I can find this one on tap somewhere this fall."
"Drinkability: I've never been to one as far as the real thing goes, but this is probably my favorite domestic version. I need to stock up on this. Try it if you can."
"drinkability: ok"
"Very nice example of Octoberfest beer."
"Pours clear amber with a terrific head. The aroma is crisp and malty. The flavor is outstanding, light caramel, apple, earthy leaves - a perfect cool weather beer. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little prickly. What a great marzen."
"Smooth drinking Oktoberfest that pours a copper hugh with little head or retention. Hint of toffee on the nose. Beer has a taste of caramel malts that sit on the back of the tongue, a hint of hops that, and definitely bready aftertaste that lingers. Body of the beer is not as heavy as expected. All in all a drinkable Oktoberfest, but not my favorite of the season."
"D - Well I loved it. It came off big, bold, yet sweet and medium bodied. Liked it. Great brew Great Lakes."
"One of the better O-fests that I've had thus far this year... Delicious and recommended..."
"Overall, I think this is a well-done Octoberfest. I prefer a little sweeter interpretation, but can appreciate the authenticity and refinement of this effort."
"D/O- Drinkability is high with this one, per the beer style. Overall I'm a tad disappointed with this Great Lakes brew. One of my favorite breweries for sure (Midwest represent)...am going to blame the style as it is a fairly narrow one with how it can stand out above the others, it seems anyways."
"Most importantly for me, this beer has no ""metallic"" taste traits that some other Marzens seem to have for me."
"D- very easy to drink, this is one of my favorite for the fall, i could drink this all the time"
"Big, dense beer - quite pleasant. Beautiful on a fall evening."
"Drinkable? ....Duh?....Oktoberfest? It's built to binge. This can be consumed in bulk. Not a ""sipper",but damn good beer for a style where it's rare to find anything above average."
"Like all Great Lakes beers, the Oktoberfest is nicely carbonated. In particular, the crisp edge pairs nicely with the medium body. I like this beer and will enjoy it many times this year, as it's a wonderful companion on the first chilly days of Autumn."
"Taste: Biscuit and caramel. Herbal hop spice. Damn fine American O-fest."
"Overall- Extremely drinkable. I am half way through this beer and already want another one! Just enough toasty malt flavor and herbal hop bitterness to balance, not heavy, filling, or overly sweet at all and perfectly suited for a 1 Liter mug! Outstanding Oktoberfest brew. Kudos GLBC!"
"Taste was first bread backed by some sweet caramel notes, then a very mild bitterness in the back as it finnished with a full grain toasted oat flavor. Excellent taste and very nice mouth feel. A very drinkable beer."
"O: Another solid beer from Great Lakes, but nothing that knocks my socks off."
"D: Decent, but not my favorite. About half way through my second pint, I just wasn't enjoying it anymore. I bit of a disappointment from a great brewer like GL."
"Pretty good example of the style, although I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of Oktoberfests. I find this to be right there with the Ayinger and certainly better than the disappointing Sam Adams..."
"A highly drinkable beer, I advise that you not drink this too cold. Let the bottle sit out a good 10 minutes before drinking, it will really open this one up nicely."
"Overall: A decent beer overall. See drinkability for more."
"very smooth and easy drinking, if I want a Marzen I will buy GLBC."
"Drinkability: I was surprised by this beer as I wasn't expecting quite so much toffee/butterscotch caramel in either the nose or the flavors. On the whole I had no problem finishing the beer but thought it could have used a bit more hop to balance it out and give it a dryer, more bitter finish. While I'll try this one again to see if I need to improve the scores on this one, it didn't seem to me to be all that pleasant compared to some of the other o-fest beers I've tried."
"The palate opens with all the malt glory of the nose replicated and then some. While staying medium-light in body, this beer carries flavors of caramel, toffee, fruitcake and figs. The hops appear on the finish, lending a light earthy bitterness that *perfectly* balances the sweetness. The sweetness does linger into the finish, with the fruity character present. Very very clean. Medium light in body with moderate carbonation, the finish is excellent. Very drinkable, I'll make sure to grab more of this before its gone."
"D- This is a refreshing Oktoberfest beer that I wasn't sure I was going to like. I was wrong and I have no problem saying that. Great Lakes has this problem where when I think I'll like one of their beers I hate it and vice versa. Good job Great Lakes on this one!"
"The body is firm. Good carbonation, backed by a smooth finish. A little filling, but not too so. Sweet caramel goodness all over the palate. Bitterness is moderate. There's a bit of an alcohol burn on the backend, but it's not too wearing. Nice bready finish. Great beer for the style. One of my new favorites. Glad this is still around. I'm going to pick some more up."
"Overall I am impressed with this beer, although it is a touch on the sweet side."
"Drinkability: this beer was extremely quaffable and enjoyable. This hits the spot when looking for a nice fall season beer."
"Medium bodied, mild carbonation, with a sweet aftertaste. A very solid Oktoberfest which I would buy again. The aroma is the weakness of the beer, but the taste makes up for it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, and just ok."
"This is has always been my favorite Oktoberfest. No one can brew a lager like Great Lakes! Recommended to anyone."
"I could drink a few, but still a little heavy on the alcohol taste."
"pours a mostly clear nice copper color with a fresh ring good lacing very little head but a nice fresh looking color..smell was malts and caramel roasted bread and smell of earth and autumn..taste was crisp with sweet caramel malts and roasted grains some citrus hops and spices it was creamy smooth and real tasty,,,mouth feel was medium lots of flavor it was autumn in a bottle delicious easy to drink i wanted another one ,,this is one solid OF big recommendation"
"I've had GLBC bears before and liked them. Just not this style from them. It might taste OK, but not as an Ofest. Definately would not recommend and will not buy again. I'll stick to Spaten or Paulaner."
"D - Very high. Could (and will) enjoy several of these. Such a pleasant sipper, it encapsulates all the joy of autumn after the hard work of spring and summer."
"Refreshing and sessionable- exactly what I want on a crisp night watching football."
"I love everything about this beer, but my only qualm is that it is a little heavy for the style. Not too heavy, mind you, since it does still fit into the style guidelines. At 6.5% this one would destroy me if I had two liters and for me an octoberfest lager should be light enough to have a couple liters during a football game without getting sleepy. In other words, the only thing keeping this brew from getting three '5's is personal preference. Not bad."
"good one."
"Overall a top notch Ofest that I put up there with the best of them. It seems Great Lakes keeps makes solid beers no matter what style. Very nice, I will seek more out next year."
"Pours a very clear, light golden amber. Nice tannish head. Smell is all malt and mineral, and fresh. Taste is clean and bitter upfront. That great dash of toasty marzen malt comes after. This one finishes with a little bit of heat on the end, also with more bitters. Dry, but satisfying. OK, but the feel seems a little off - the ABV may be just a bit too high."
"Seriously great beer here. One of the top picks for O-fests."
"Pours a clear bright copper with a foamy, retentive off white/cream colored head with slowly receding lacing. Mild, clean aroma of toasted malt, restrained sweetness; average for the style, neither good nor bad. Flavor is more of the same, with a little more sweetness. Toasted and caramel malts dominate with feint earthy hops in the dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium thick, creamy and smooth with soft carbonation and smooth clean finish. Overall a nice beer with absolutely nothing wrong with it, but lacking a little depth expected from the flavor knocking that score down a notch."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and clean with great drinkability."
"Drinkability - this beers calls out for having one more"
"Clear amber color with one finger of white head that settled to a thin film of bubbles. Moderate amount of spotty lacing. Sweet malt aroma with just a hint of fresh cut grass. Not a whole lot going on in this department. The flavor is likewise sweet, slightly toasted, and nutty. Hops are very low keyed if detectable at all. Low hops even compared to most of the German standards. The body is a little larger than what is typical. Looking at the ABV I am not surprised. The carbonation is a little prickly which hurts the consumption a little. A well crafted beer but is a bit boring. The ABV may prevent some from enjoying the quantities that these beers are meant to be drank."
"Pours a fairly light amber, bordering on copper. Starts with a two-finger head in my pilsner glass, lading into just a rim as the beer goes down. Hints of lacing. Smells slightly sweet with some caramel. Not too much depth. Taste is similar with a faint hoppiness. Light caramel touch. Mouthfeel is nice. Medium body and good carbonation. Slightly creamy. Drinkability is average. Nothing spectacular here. Not quite malty enough to fit into the German-type Oktoberfest, and doesn't have the hop feel of some of the better American Octoberfests."
"D- I think I really like this beer, Im not a huge oktoberfest guy, HOSS is my favorite from the states but this might just be my second. A six pack might be in order."
"D - Really good considering the ABV. One of the best Oktoberfest beers I've had this year. The overall rating might not come out great, but GL Oktoberfest has it where it counts."
"A bonified exceptional drinker of an O-fest by the craft crazy awesome folks at Great Lakes. Many a mugs of this can be easily handled."
"This is a different twist on the style, but it's still a nice brew."
"Poured from bottle into a 3 floyds imperial pint. Vigorous pour gives a small, white head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass. Color is a light amber with hues of orange. Smell is typical marzen, mostly malts, some light brown sugar, a touch of spicy hops. Tastes like fall - Good, solid malt flavor, slightly sweet with just enough bitterness to provide some contrast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly sticky but still crisp. Light to medium carbonation. I love oktoberfest beers, so drinkability is pretty high for me despite having a slightly higher alcohol percentage then i like in a session beer. If you enjoy marzens, definitley check this one out."
"Drinkability: Strong, semi-sweet Marzen. Great with food, but a nice full flavored lager on its own."
"D_Great drinkability. Just like a good oktoberfest should be."
"D-Overall a really solid Okto. and one of my go-to's this time of year. I just wish it wasn't so hot out, I'm really ready for fall and the beers it brings with it."
"D: A really nice Oktoberfest. Nothing over the top, but that's ok. Very solid flavors and a clean finish make this beer amazingly drinkable. It was hard to drink just one in a sitting. I really enjoyed this beer. Give it a try."
"Drinkabilty - Nice octoberfest, very drinkable and full of flavors. Enough alcohol in it that you will feel once you drink a couple. I wish i would have got a 6-pack."
"It may still be August but this Oktoberfest is a good reminder of the cooler months to come. This would be a great session beer for someone looking for a sweeter brown or red ale for the fall."
"Good solid amber color with a scent of caramelized sugar. Medium body with a little astringency for cleanliness. Leaves you with a good flavor and a touch of weight on the aftertaste. This is a complex and beguiling brew that every time I think I have it figured out, I am thrown a change-up. Good and drinkable, especially for kickoff..."
"Fairly drinkable for the style. Great Lakes makes some great beers, rarely misses (ahem, Grassroots), and makes solid efforts like this one. Not a great Oktoberfest, but one I will pick up again."
"D: this is a very good Oktoberfest, and is very close to great!"
"Pours a rather dull looking copper color with a small white head that falls quickly to no cap. Not much carbonation. Aroma is sweet and bready, very little in the way of hops, with a touch of toast. Taste is a bit too sweet for my likings. It's definitely malty, bready, with generous amounts of Munich malts, but the sweetness becomes a bit cloying for me. OFests are good when they're sweet, but normally they dry out on the finish, which this doesn't. Bitterness is light and somewhat floral. Mouthfeel is medium, but there's a huge lack of carbonation. It's not flat, but needs more. This is a decent OFest, but nothing spectacular, and I still find it a little sweet for the style."
"Overall, a fairly average octoberfest beer. Nothing crazy, but it is what it is supposed to be. I do like the hops that shine through in this beer. Fairly drinkable."
"Great Lakes did a fine job with their Oktoberfest. The ease of drinkability is impressive. I only bough a single, not knowing if I wanted to commit to a 6 pack. I think it's fair to say affirmative on that. I'll be keeping an eye out for it on tap, as well."
"This is to me a much darker take on the style, not only in color but flavor as well. By flavor I mean not a stout, but dark as in gloomy? More bold flavors, reminiscent of bold cheese. Not one of my favorite takes on the style, but a great contender. Probably a beer you either like or do not like, for me it s a do not."
"Overall- I'm going to need to try some more of this, this whole apple business is not what I was expecting. But I am digging this a ton!"
"A well crafted Oktoberfest. No complaints here, but also nothing that makes it really stand out, but that's fine with me. A couple of these would go really well on those cool fall evenings."
"The mouth is semi-thick and the beer is extremely drinkable. Bring on the sausages and the chicken dance!"
"I have been to this brewery and would like to say that there best beers aren't in stores.There at the brewery on tap.If you can't get there beer where you live message me for a trade."
"Clear burnt orange with a small off-white head, fading to a thick ring before long. Aroma of Caramel toasty malts with a bit of earthy hop bitterness, even a bit of biscuity malts after the initial smell. Medium, creamy, light hop body with decent finish / Light flavors of caramel malt, with undertones of pine hop. Very drinkable....as most Marzens are."
"This is a good oktoberfest beer."
"Definately the worst oktoberfest ive tried and the worst ive tried from greatlakes. Not really a bad beer over all. I would drink it but theres better for the price. I have access to many kinds of hard to find brews so its very unlikely i will ever buy this one again."
"D- I like this one a lot. This has got to be my favorite oktoberfest to date."
"Not a first choice, but this is a good beer, and a decent one in the style. Marzens seem to be pretty easy to get into because most don't stray far from the norm. If you like sweeter, malt forward beers, this is a great one to have. For the price (8.99 for 6) this is a good value."
"D - nice, attractive and delicious. I could enjoy multiple in one setting"
"It poured a copper color with a nice white head. It has a very strong malt smell and flavor. It was a lot sweeter than I was expecting. There was a little bit of the alcohol coming through at the end. It had a nice creamy mouthfeel. One I would drink again if they were to make it again."
"I missed the Nosferatu, but at least I got to try this one. It pours a clear amber copper topped by a veruy short, ecru, bubbly head. The smell is sweeter than expected, comprising brown sugar, maple syrup, caramel, and a semi-tropical fruitness that's hard to pin down (my best guess is pineapple). The maple comes through in the taste, along with toffee, walnut, green apple, and a sort of woody bitterness. Not what I've come to expect from an Oktoberfest necessarily, but not all that bad either. The body is a light medium, with a smoothness that improves over time and a carbonation that's small and short, but pretty active while there."
"Beer is pretty thick, full bodied. Very malty, mild roast perhaps. Drinkability of this beer is good but I feel its a little too thick for an oktoberfest."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer is light brown in color, but shows off some orange tones when held up to the light. The head is small, made of small bubbles and tan colored. It disappeared to a slight skim. There's lots of carbonation rising within the glass. The aroma is woodsy and leafy, but with a good toasted malt character, kind of like toasted artisanal bread. It starts out with a good toffee malt flavor that is slightly sweet. The finish has a bit of a kick; it almost feels like there is a slight alcohol burn, but since this is only a 6.5% ABV beverage, I'm guessing it's some finishing hops that cause this sensation. The beer has a full body; each sip feels like a real mouth full of beer. It leaves behind a good amount of coating on both my lips and in my mouth. The carbonation is felt, but it isn't too prominent. It's a very drinkable beer. It's too bad it isn't available in my area...I could see it becoming my go to autumnal seasonal brew."
"And as with J.R. I couldn't get enough of this. I'll be grabbing a case of two next time I'm in the distribution area."
"Taste and drinkability are here hands down. ABV is a little high for a true German O-fest, but Great Lakes did a good job of hiding where that went. Malt & hop profile are definitely robust, but still what I would consider within the guidelines for this type of beer. Very smooth and well rounded. A solid offering from a brewery that obviously knows its way around traditional German recipes (i.e. Elliot Ness)."
"F: Finishes a little drier, but still slightly sweet, and has a little more bitterness. Actually, the sweetness just sits on the tongue and doesn't want to go, it's a little annoying. A little syrupy as well. A nice beer, decent Oktoberfest, but a little too sweet."
"D: Good marzen for the season."
"Fluffy head, crests at a bit over a finger, the larger sized bubbles cause it to evaporate into surface islands swiftly, minimal lacing with no stickiness. Burnt red to orange color, like a summer sunset, light filminess but not quite translucent. Strong burst of cocoa, milk chocolate powder and caramel to the nose, honeyed graham crackers, malty to the exclusion of most hoppiness, no citrus or grass notes, touch of pepperiness. Medium-bodied, somewhat sluggish mouth presence, the carbonation is round and not that refreshing. That said, good depth to the honey, caramel, cocoa flavors without pushing the sweetness too far. Here you get more orange citrus bite as well as a grainy edge, even some poor minerally earth. Smattering of peach, pear, apple fruit, not a player. What's most nice about it is that it absolutely coheres best as a whole rather than parsed out as parts. Hence, drinkability."
"Nicely carbonated, maybe a bit too high? Drinkability was solid, but note my bias against this style. Having said that, Great Lakes is yet to disappoint."
"Great Lakes always does a great job on making German styles of beer and this another one of their easy drinking German style of beer. It was above average for the Oktoberfest style and really not all that much above that point. Since it's a good beer and it does have a ton of flavor to it, I could easily see myself drinking a liter of this beer during anybody's Oktoberfest celebration."
"another solid beer from great lakes. clear amber, creamy off-white head. caramelly, bready malts in the nose follow through on the taste, with the light sweetness well balanced by the spicy hops in the background. roundish mouthfeel, almost medium-bodied. could have a few of these."
"From Premiere Gourmet. Pours peachy colour, and the aroma is fruity peachy. Easy drinking, mild bitterness, and the bitterness is more pronounced than the slight sweetness, a tad smoked. Not outstanding beer that I would seek it, very pleasant though. Bang on the style plus."
"D- Fantastic session brew. I love Oktoberfests and this might just be my new favorite! I wish this brewery was available localy."
"Poured a clear, deep amber with a moderate head that quickly faded to a thin collar. The aroma was lightly malt sweet. The taste was caramel sweet malt with the barest of hop bitter in the background. The feel was medium bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Clean, clear and crisp. I'm not normally a fan of marzen beers, but this was a very good one, best I've had."
"Yet again, Great Lakes have hit one out of the park. For a long time I've been edging towards calling them my favourite brewery because of their huge range of styles, all of which seem to excel in their category. Their oktoberfest cements this reputation and is the perfect fall drink. Perhaps the best reason to live in Cleveland?"
"Another very solid offering from a really solid brewery."
"ooh is this tasty. rich, aromatic, flavorful: delightful"
"Future outlook: Decent, if slightly disappointing GL offering. No need for me to seek out again when there are preferred options readily available."
"When I got the hankering today for a nice chewy, malty Fall-time lager this is exactly what I had in mind. I don't know that I've had one Great Lakes beer that wasn't a flawless, exemplary rendition of the style it set out to be. This German-inspired seasonal is just more proof that the architects at this brewery are among the industry's most skilled."
"This is from notes of a review a couple weeks ago...must have forgot to post. Pretty clear golden orange color. Very slightly off-white head showed itself at little over a finger high and left rather quickly. Sweet roasted grains show in the smell, but I also get a really musty odor accompanying this. Malty caramels provide the sweet, but I really get no hop presence. This reminded me of Grassroots, which I was also not a fan of. Great Lakes is probably my favorite all-around brewery, but this just didn't cut it for me."
"Overall a bit better than your average oktoberfest. Was a nice match for some spicy landjagers. Certainly worth a try"
"Overall it is a solid addition to the Oktoberfest category, not the best one but worthy if you see it and want to try it."
"Another very solid offering from a really solid brewery. Wish I could get it more often."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a medium amber body with a rocky off-white head. Aroma is a deliciously inviting sweet taffy. Medium bodied with robust malt flavors from start to finish with just a hint of bitterness. This is one of the best octoberfest beers I've tried this year."
"Great Lakes Oktoberfest poured a nice amber color, however lost some points because it lacked head and lacing. Smell was nice of bready malts and hops. Taste showed nice balance between the bready and slightly sweet malt, with a nice hop finish, enough there to notice, but did not over take the malt. The malt stood out. Mouthfeel was good for the style. Drinkability was good, almost to good for a beer with this ABV. Overall I thought this was a nice version of the style. I feel to often American made Ofests or often overly sweet. This one had that nice sweet malt, but not overly sweet, and all in balance."
"D- I was a bit surprised that this wasn't better than I expected. Great Lakes puts out some very good beers but this one missed the mark."
"Very drinkable, goes quickly."
"All in all I was quite impressed with this one. There's a good balance and even a light complexity, more than expected given that its only ingredients are hops, barley, yeast and water. NO sugars, nothing added. Discredit those who say otherwise."
"This beer poured a light amber with a fluffy single-finger head that left some nice lacing. The smell is mostly sweet malt with some unobtrusive grassy and floral malt. The taste starts off with a mix of the floral hops and some sweet slightly tart malt that gives way to a bit of a dry finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. No problem with drinkability, this is a nice little beer."
"D- Not a bad Maerzen, but note the best one either."
"D - This is a nice easy drinking octoberfest. It's not my favorite but its still worth a try from a quality brewery."
"Starts out making you think there's not going to be much to it, but leaves you with an impressive amount of malty complexity to ponder as you make your way through this easy drinker. For such a sessionable beer, it has some real nuance."
"Pours a radiantly clear dark reddish amber, honey coloured, thick slightly off white head forms, slowly settles down to a pretty decent layer and ring around the glass, good retention, some lace chunks stick. Smell is nice, very fruity, almost tropical like mango and pineapple, bready and biscuit malt, sulphur, caramel, strawberries, very rich and malty, some alcohol comes through, quite nice. Taste is similar, very rich maltiness, biscuit and caramel, bready, some fruit, strawberry sweetness, iron, some alcohol, sugary feel, it really coats the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, feels a bit heavy, but is really well done. Maybe a touch sweet but a nice marzen."
"One of the better American Oktoberfest's, however I've noted a few other reviews regarding the grassy hops, which is kinda off-kilter for the style."
"Sigh."
"D - A fantastic marzen. Tart and crisp. A great fall beer, and one of my favorite Great Lakes offerings."
"this beer pours a nice copper color off white head that recedes quickly to a layer of lace. the aroma brings a nice sweet malty bready aroma that follows in the taste. the lager yeast doing their thing making the sweet malt flavor up front dry and crisp at the end. the full body and good co2 make this a tasty beverage."
"Pours a dark redish dark copper with an off white head that fades fast and leaves lacing. The smell is malty, but a different sort of malt, with some sweet notes. The taste is much different than most malty beers, the malt drives the flavor, and the sweetness comes on at first, but there is a nice bitter finish to balance the beer. The mouthfeel is medium, nice carbonation, a beer with some depth. This one is an easy drinker, somewhat strong on the tongue, but nothing that will turn you away. Definitely one worth checking out."
"This is a nicely crafted beer that is a good example of a domestic Marzen. A very enjoyable beer to drink, and a nice compliment to a decent variety of foods."
"For an oktoberfest this is pretty tasty and full of flavor, however I find it overall a touch too sweet for my liking to enjoy multiple of these in a sitting. I like the bite of the malt and a little bitter hops in the finish as well. If nothing else, the abv from this one has warmed me up a little bit. I'd love to have this on tap to compare with the bottle."
"D- I certainly could finish this beer, but after 24 oz, I did not care much to have another."
"Oddly, this really reminds me of the Christmas Ale, but without the spices. I don't think it's better. Surprisingly slow to drink. I think it's a bit too big, and that's a complaint I don't make too often. Not really what I was looking for. Really rather dull to me, but this is probably a symptom of being an Oktoberfest. I wanted something a bit more quaffable."
"Drinkability - this went fast with dinner and I think if I was in an actual Oktoberfest event, this stuff would be gone fast and I'd easily be ordering another. Very nice beer with a meal in that it doesn't overpower the meal (which was a simple beef, onion and noodle dish) and satisfies at the end."
"Love great lakes beers, this one does a good job on the Oktoberfest style. I think I'm usually a little too excited for Oktoberfest season, because a lot of them fall flat to me... this one is similar to the great lakes lager, in the fact that there is a little more hoppiness to these than most. Pours rich copper, with a little head, but lacing is nice. Aroma is basic malt. Flavor is malty, but there is a different layer to the flavor that I'm detecting as hops, but it might just be the roasting of the malts. Not my favorite Great Lakes by many many miles, but still a good beer in a style that I usually give average marks to."
"D. Wow, the flavors linger about the palate. A nice feel of malts left clinging to the tounge. Very drinkable Oktoberfest at a 6.5 abv. with plenty to enjoy. The best American Oktoberfest in my opinion."
"Have to say I was let down by this one. Maybe a bad sixer?"
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. A light caramel/amber color. Smell is very grassy, slight sweetness, and very faint hops. There's a slight caramelized sweetness in the flavor but the malt is not as heavy and prevalent as I would have liked. This is pretty light for the style and not really one of my favorites from Great Lakes."
"I enjoyed this beer, and am interesting in trying other versions from other breweries. I can't say I'd go out and buy more, as there are other beers with more character."
"Poured into my pint glass the beer is a orange brown hue. A half inch of off white head sits atop my glass. After it recedes no lacing is left whatsoever. Once again as I'm starting to notice with this style the nose is weak. What I can pick up is malty breadiness and hnits of hops. Not much else. The flavor is fairly mild as well. Malt and roast nuts are the main characters I taste up front with a slight hop bitterness that comes in at the end. Smooth medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall another underwheliming marzen. Here's to the next one knocking my socks off."
"I poured into a pint glass to a small light tan head. It is dark orange in color. It smells of sweet malt. It tastes of caramel malts and has some hints of hops. I think it is quite drinkable, but it is not a standout. I would belly up to a bar and session this beer. It just lacks the ""wow"" factor."
"Overall- on the label great lakes call is a amber lager. i woulda expected more of a medium to heavy bodied mouthfeel then. i guess the best term i could say is that this brew is alright."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The o-fest appears a clear rich copper color with about two fingers of pillowy off white foam. Nose and flavor consist of toasted bready grain, fruity, apples, toast, buttery, grassy hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. A decent stab at the marzen style."
"D: A nice beer for the fall seasons... you can taste the leaves cahnging in every sip."
"An easy drinker but not quite up to par with many of GL's other outstanding beers."
"Drinkability: Really high. This is a solid marzen that pairs well with all the food of the season."
"(D)- A good oktoberfest, yet is almost a bit too sweet though. Overall, a beer that is easily enjoyed."
"A very nice fall time beer."
"Aroma is nothing but overpowering sweet candy malts. Its a malt monster alright. Flavor is full of chewy thick malts. Lots of caramel going on too. No balance what so ever and too sweet to consume in copious amounts. Its just too one sided and filling. Knock back the malt content some and through in some more Tettering or Hallertaus to strike some sort of balance and this beer would improve drastically."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice bite of carbonation."
"Pours a nice red-brown-copper color, but no head or lacing. Nice malty scent, but not the deep fall aroma I like. Good taste, some nice malt attributes, but with an odd sweetness (almost Irish red like, but lighter due to it being a lager). Goes down fine, but with a slightly astringent aftertaste. Not the best from Great Lakes."
"On a recent road trip to Ohio, I picked up a few Buckeye State brews including this season-appropriate offering from Great Lakes. The pour produced a respectable lager head and a good quality lager smell. The crystal-clear orange color was lighter than I would have expected for the style, and similarly the taste, while pleasant, was also more like an amber lager than an oktoberfest beer. Somewhat malty, flavor with suggestions of toasted bread and a slight sour note. For the style I would have expected more malt, more body, and maybe a little less hops at the end. That said, this is a pleasant beer with substantial character, and I look forward to savoring my remaining bottles."
"Overall, a very enjoyable fall beer!"
"Another great entry by Great Lakes. The elusive fruitiness defines this as a head and shoulders above its other American competition in the oktoberfest style."
"D: Put it this way - I had a sixer in the fridge before the Browns preseason game yesterday. By the end of the game it was gone."
"I pounded a six pack of this without even knowing. Great Oktoberfest that is crisp, clean, and refreshing; highly drinkable. I will be drinking more of this one for sure."
"D: Oktoberfest is really refreshing and drinkable, without compromising on flavor. I recommend this beer for those who are into Marzens and amber lagers!"
"Reviewed on: 10-29-2008 23:30:55"
"I took this beer golfing with me and first off have to say its a great golfing beer. The body has a deep orange amber color with great clarity. Impressive head even from the bottle. The aroma has nice spicy and earthy hops with a wonderful sweet malty character. Its flavor has a deep malty base with light toasty bready notes and nice caramel sweetness. Balance comes from spicy, herbal and earthy hops. The texture is smooth and easy drinking with modest carbonation and a good solid medium to full body. I'm going to be buying this one again for sure."
"Drinkability: High. This is a great tasting beer and a strong representative of the style as a whole. Nice flavors and a moderate ABV would make this a great go-to beer for a session."
"honestly,i really hate most marzen lagers,but i seek this beer out when it's released.solid with great drinkability."
"D- a very drinkable beer, i've tried to get my hands on this beer for 3 years now and am certainly impressed"
"D: This is a fantastic beer. Its almost completely accurate to style except I feel it finishes too sweet (almost cloying) to be given all fives. Nonetheless this is a great beer, one that I would drink all year round"
"Poured from a pitcher at the GLBC brewpub into a pint glass. Pours a rusty-bronze color with about 2 fingers of head. A biscuit-bready sweet roasted malt aroma is heavy in the nose. This beer is medium bodied and well balanced with a malty sweetness. Very drinkable and on the high end of a session beer at 6.5% ABV."
"Overall it's better than macro beer but I won't try again. No worries though I still love you Great Lakes!!"
"D: I could drink a gallon, but at 6.5%, a little strong for a session beer. A beer that is propped up by its great malt flavor and relatively good balance. A solid brew of the style."
"this was an acceptable beer however lacked alot of the vienna malt flavor that i look for in oktoberfests. not to say it was out of style or bad. it was relatively tasty however it contained a tang of a maltiness that was not what i was looking for. smooth light carbonation, medium body. little to no white head on top that faded quickly"
"Pours a reddish gold with no head to speak of. Plenty of spice and malt in the nose. Pleasant. Taste is no where as good as the nose. The spices that were in the nose are hidden in the taste. Just a simple lager is left in the taste. Nothing to get excited about. Expected more from Great Lakes. I've loved everything from them to date."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white head, with minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some slight spice. The taste is sweet, malty, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew, recommended."
"M/D - Overall not a bad brew that I could drink several in a setting, but its not my favorite in this style"
"An amber to golen color, with visible carbonation. A half inch head forms on top, cream in color, that dissolves away to afilm on top. A combination of fragrances starts it out with bread and biscuity aromas, then blending to a sweet yeasty scent. It ends with a spicy peppery scent. The bread comes out strong at the beginning of each taste. Then midway a yeasty tanginess, then finishing with mild bitterness of eath and grass, but nothing overwhelming. A watery feel at the start, but it gradually becomes fuller in body as it rolls across the palate. A bit of crispness from the carbonation at the end. Is there such a thing as an undrinkable oktoberfest, probably, but I have never foung one. This is an excellent starter and session beer."
"Perhaps I got a poor batch. This beer poured a cloudy orange with plenty of chill haze. The smell was neutral to a bit floral. The taste was very astrningent, bitter, and chalky. I won't even begin complaining that there was no ""Bavairan"" character to this lager - no Bohemian Pilsner malt, Munich malts, or German noble hops. I've had Great Lakes ales before and have given them good reviews. I can only say that I just got a spoiled batch."
"Poured a nice clear light copper color. Very little head that was gone in an instant. Not much aroma noticeable. Maybe just a hint of malt? Taste was typical oktoberfest - malty with just a hint of hops. I thought this one may have had a hint of smokiness as well. Medium/heavy body with medium/light carbonation. Fairly drinkable, but nothing special."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable on a brisk autumn evening."
"D-Superoir....without question one of the best domestic Marzens I have ever had. A total caramel malt delight! Hard to resist having seconds, thirds..."
"You want to gulp this stuff down all night, drink this like water."
"This one is definitely up there in my O-fest rankings. It's hard to say whether this or FFF Munsterfest is better."
"D: Very easy to drink. ABV is technically too high to be a session but that doesn't stop me during this time of the year :)"
"D - great tasting, smooth drinking brew, delicious!"
"Pours a clear copper in color with a creamy, light khaki colored head. Malty aroma has a caramel and light nuttiness to it. Mouthfeel is medium in body. Toasted malt with a caramel sweetness to it. A moderate amount of hops adds some bitterness and balance to this. Finish has a lingering nuttiness and rich sweet maltiness to it. Overall, a solid Oktoberfest."
"Cheers!!!"
"Medium bodied - fuller than expected. Smooth, creamy, and a touch of chewiness. Very nice mouthfeel. Easy to drink with enough flavor to keep you interested."
"mouthfeel is creamy, nice carbonation, good heavy flavors to style - nice!"
"D: Highly drinkable, would be a great session beer if the alcohol was dialed down a bit. Recommended."
"This beer is smooth and easy to drink. Nothing overly bountiful in terms of taste but provides a mild hop balance that is mixed in with the lighter malts nicely."
"D- possibly my favorite Oktober fest beer. this is something i could easily kill a couple of bottles of. pretty refreshing and enjoyable."
"Notes: Absolutely wonderful balance of flavor, body and drinkability."
"Drinkability- Smooth and drinkable, but the off hops and over caramelization seems to detract from the beer overall. I may end up buying a 4 pack, but I'll have to try some others for this season to be sure."
"D - Good beer but it's not one of the best Oktoberfest's."
"D: Drinkability is good. 	4"
"d. This is a very good o-fest. Would reccomend to any lager enthusiast."
"The beer pours a brilliant copper color with moderate white head that quickly diminishes into a skim. The aroma is moderately malty, spicy, biscuity, grainy, and a bit sweet. The flavor is highly malty; biscuit and bread-like, spicy malt and a spicy, earthy low but noticeable hop flavor. The finish is exceptionally smooth and pleasantly dry. Carbonation moderate-low and body is full. Overall an exceptionally smooth, flavorful beer. A great example of the style."
"D - You could easily drink yourself into the Oktoberfest gutter on this one."
"This is a very good oktoberfest in my book - not quite my favorite but a really good one."
"d - a very fine Oktoberfest, perhaps my preferred version from a relatively convenient source (for NE Ohio anyway)"
"D - This is a superior beer. Very tasty, and well balanced, leaning towards the malt."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and incredibly smooth. Excellent feel and a very drinkable O-Fest."
"D: A sweet and mildly hopped taste profile makes Great Lakes Oktoberfest exceptionally sessionable."
"Overall, this is a real good beer. It's close enough to the style but different enough to make it its own thing."
"Pours a nice deep golden with a thin white head. Decent retention,and a nice lacing. Aroma is of bread abd butter. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is sweet and bready,with some fruit notes. Dry finish with just enough hops to make this a great Oktoberfest!"
"Prost to Zapata"
"I found it to be very drinkable. If it were not for the fact that I wanted to try a couple different beers I would have drank this one the whole session."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer I'll be drinking more of."
"Pours a pretty copper color with a dense off-white head that dissipated into a light cap. The aroma is of caramel malt, bready, and hard mineral water. The taste is of light caramel malt, rusty hard water, lemon, and a spicy tea like hop. Could use a touch more caramel and doughy malt presence. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation, slightly chewy. A good not great Oktoberfest, doesn't quite ring German in my opinion. It does have some nice flavors though I think the Cleveland area has hard water as these Great Lakes brews have a mineral flavor to them."
"Overall a very nice Oktoberfest brew and worth a try"
"D- This is a great, drinkable Oktoberfest...and that's what the style was designed for...drinkability. I really like this beer and will go back to it more this fall season. One of my favorite (American) O-fests so far (I only tried a few last year)."
"I have a great priviledge to visit Great Lakes Brewery on a regular, I'm from Cleveland. the appearance is like an bronze, three-fourths bodied tone not full like stout, but you know that the malt used are present and the head stuck to my glass all the way down. I have a growler, I'm a fan of tap beer, the freshness and potency is magnificent if you can get it without the bottle. I digress, the smell is upfront doesn't hide, I can sniff the sweetness and alcohol and the taste sticks to the tongue, there is no running away. the beer lingers in the mouth, this beer is a good sipper and the drinkability will hold you down until tomorrow, if you fill the 72oz growler up."
"D: Very high. This is a delicious and easy-drinking beer. Highly recommended."
"D: An excellent Oktoberfest beer. Went along slendid with the bratwursts and pierogies."
"Excellent marzen. Aggressive in its characteristics, which all tend to balance themselves out. One of the best you'll find outside Bavaria."
"D= A very drinkable beer. If I had a complaint it is that it tastes too much like their Dortmunder Gold. But it is a good beer, and certainly a great one to have with food."
"Well done, and very drinkable. No qualms about recommending this one to others."
"The dryness and breadiness cut back for me a bit on the drinkability. Of course, this was having it solo. I could really see this one with sausage and kraut, which would ratchet the numbers up a bit. If they had mustard and sausage beer, this one would pair quite nicely."
"D- This has to be one of my favorite Oktoberfest brews. Incredibly easy to drink and highly recommended."
"Just got some more of this great beer and it tastes exceptionally chocolatey this time around. It's still very good, just different from the first time."
"It goes down like water; specifically water that tastes really really good and that I want to drink all the time."
"Notes: For the style it's probably one of the best you can find at the moment. The malt's characterisitcs really shine through and make this a very delicious brew I'd strongly suggest to anyone."
"Pours a clear amber orange with little white head, little retention and lacing. Smells are really sweet; caramel and toffee but with some floral hops and a hint of fruits. Tastes are also sweet, lots of caramel with a touch of nuts. A hint of earthy hops fit nicely into the finish giving it a good crispness. Medium in body and smooth, hides its ABV nicely. A good American attempt at the Marzen, very drinkable and hides the alcohol quite well, meaning that after several of these in a session you're feeling quite like you're at a Festhaus."
"Edit. After thinking this over, grading this heavily to style is wrong. Reducing scores to reflect the beer by beer standards and not a substandard style of beer."
"Another winner from GLBC."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with one finger fluffy white head that dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is decent, leaves a pretty nice coating behind. Smell is a peppery like caramel malt with a tiny bit of citrus hops. Overall it's pretty weak in the nose, was really hoping for more in terms of scent. Taste is very much like the scent. Creamy caramel malt up front with a underlying hint of citrus hops. Buttery biscuit flavors end up in the aftertaste. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a minimal carbonation. Pretty easy to put this one down, but I probably wouldn't have another, just not my style."
"D-Top notch beer from probably this country's best brewery. A slightly amped up Elliot Ness...I love the toasted malt and the flavor of this. Reminds me a lot of New Glarus Staghorn....one of the better Ofests made along with NGlarus, Summit, and the Hacker-Pschorr/Paulaner clones."
"Drinkability - this is good and sessionable. A somewhat hearty, and very solid O-fest beer."
"I'll admit, Oktoberfest is not my favorite style. In fact, it isn't among my top-20 favorite styles. Leave it to Great Lakes, a world-class brewery, to show me just what a world-class O-fest should taste like. Highly recommended... but only if you're a fan of outstanding craft beer."
"Fairly sweet, Malty and somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Higher alcohol profile than your average Oktoberfest fest/Marzen. I tried several (probably one too many) other Marzens that day and this was a wonderful represintaion to the German style beer"
"Drinkability - shoulda bought more, sooner. A very palatable seasonal from Great Lakes."
"Crystal clear amber. Nice cap of snow white head. Leaves ample amounts of lace. Nice whiff of toasted malt goodness and some bready yeastiness. The toasted malts carry over to the palate along with some caramel candy sweetness and a little toffee malt as well. Bready yeastiness accents everything to a tee. The mouthfeel is very agreeable. Carbonated pefectly. And it gives a medium to medium-full body feel. This is one of the better Oktoberfests I had. If I were to create a Mount Rushmore of Oktoberfests, this would be in it (along with Summit, New Glarus and Central Waters)."
"Drinkability: This is quite drinkable, although you do notice the alcohol in the end. I have not been a huge lager fan, but this is a solid brew. Definitely plays more for the malt lover. This beer does make me want to try other beers in this style."
"Medium bodied with sufficient carbonation, this beer is just OK. The aroma is pretty fantastic, but I'm not sold on the flavor. It's a bit alcoholic and there are all sorts of phunky phenols."
"Great Lakes a brewed a nice take on the Marzen here that seems to have a little more going on in the taste department than others I've had. Drinkability is very good and is prefectly geared towards Fall imbibing. Enjoy!"
"Great Lakes Oktoberfest hits the spot on a crisp fall evening like tonight. One of the great American breweries comes along with another great American German Style beer. If that makes sense to anyone."
"Overall, a pretty solid Oktoberfest. Really reminds me of autumn, fits the season well."
"I could easily have had a few more of these, but this came from an Oktoberfest sampler. Might have to pick up some more of these for the season. Another great offering from Great Lakes."
"It tastes great! Predominately malty, of course, but with a little more character than the majority of Oktoberfests Ive had in the paste couple of falls. It seems like there is a touch of hop bitterness lingering here and there in this brew, which is really a nice addition (if thats actually what they did), to an oktoberfest in my mind. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with adequate carbonation. I'm quite pleased with this one, very refreshing, and something I'd buy again."
"overall another winner from Great Lakes, very good example of the style in my opinion, will definitely buy this every year."
"Overall- There was something about the flavor that was different from the other festbeers I've tried, but it was a good ""different."""
"Without truly standing out in any particular way, this is simply a rock solid U.S. version that vanishes from the glass with a gusto."
"drinkability - A good representative of the style. It is a bit malty for an every day beer but it tastes pretty good on a cool fall day."
"All in all a solid American Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability, yes. A good autumn brew thats very fitting to the marzen style. For a Great Lakes, I wish it had alittle more of something."
"The bottom line: Great Lakes has put together a damn fine take on the style. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who is in the mood for an Oktoberfest beer. Best consumed from a large mug."
"Prob my 2nd or third fave in the style(see Ayinger Marzen or Mektoberfest) out of about 50 or so that I've tried."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is good. 6.5% abv is perfect for this beer. It's pretty smooth and drinkable. I can think of a few Great Lakes offerings I'd rather have, especially to session. Overall, it's a pretty solid effort though. Nice for this time of year."
"It's alright, so far it's the only o-fest I've had this year but I don't recall the style being so crisp and I think the sulfur notes could have been rounded out a little better. A decent brew but GLBC has better."
"Toasted bread malt up front followed by cookie dough and carrot cake sweetness. Cooked vegetable taste near the finish. Spicy, noble hop finish lasts a while. Medium-bodied, gently carbonated feel. Another nice lager from GLBC."
"D - Adecent Oktoberfest but I would probably look elsewhere for another."
"Found on-on tap at (of all places) Cheapside's. The bottle proved to be a world-class brew, so I had high hopes for the tap. The golden-copper-orange brew came out with a very froathy, withstanding head retention thats tough to fight through. The aromas are somewhat light, but are very yeasty, bready, malty, with just a touch of refreshing hops. Tastes very malty without the caramel or toffee sweetness. Malts are so rich that the hops, esters, and alcohol take a really far back seat. This is undoubtedly the most malty-textured Oktoberfest that I have had. Very rich textued, creamy, and soft. Finishes malty and firm. Could this beer be too malty?"
"Poured into a mug a nice amber that shows orange when held to light. The beer is topped by a nice frothy off-white head that slowly diminishes to a ring but still leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma shows some sweet malts and citrus hops, but is not that strong. The taste is a nice blend of sweet caramel and sweet fruits against a decent citrus hop backbone that stays where it belongs for the style; in the background. The beer is rather light bodied with low carbonation. This is without question one of the best I've had of the style."
"One of my new favorite Fest style beers,poured a clear bronze with a delicate looking 1/2 finger slight off white head.Grainy aromas a bit toasted with some caramel doughy sweetness a bit of iron is detected as well as well as some leafy hop,truly American in its larger dose of peppery hop but staying true with its lightly sweet doughy maltiness it has something for everyone and purists I really liked this one glad I have alot more."
"I live in Cleveland and always shake my head at all the raves about Great Lakes. Eg. their ""dortmunder gold"" is NOT a dortmunder/ export beer at all. Try a DAB or a DUB instead. Is there a site for malt-heads ?"
"Overall- Wonderful beer. Even my girlfriend who is not much of a beer drinker loved it. I recommend it to everyone. Overall- 4.7 out of 5."
"This review is from notes taken from my recent visit to the Great Lakes brewpub this past Saturday (9/1/07). Served in a big mug (around 3 beers worth, I guess), the beer poured a nice amber color with about an inch off-white head. It smelled sweet, like caramel and toasted malt, along with some toffee and some spicyness as well. Taste was pretty similar to the aroma. Mouthfeel was light/medium, and very smooth. Drinkability was very good as well, it's very, very easy to drink on tap. I reviewed this beer from the bottle a couple weeks ago, and I think it's better on tap. It's much smoother and it tastes better as well in my opinion. If you get a chance to go up to GLBC and try this on tap, you should."
"D- a little too sweet for my taste, this is my first experience with any type of oktoberfest so with more experimentation i hope to try a few more examples of the style. as in love with hops as i am, i would like to find something closer to a vienna lager, a close relative, with a greater balance between the bitterness and the sweet malt , which is dominant in this lager as with most others."
"drinkability-would definitely have another one."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle a rich golden, borderline amber color into my pint glass with a bubbly white head that builds up, then dies down to leave a small amount of white head. Smell is malt, hops, caramel and some light spices like clove, maybe a little cinnamon. Taste is very crisp and refreshing as all the ingredients found in the nose come together in a balance of flavors. Mouth is a crisp feeling making this a refreshing drink!"
"Medium body, good carbonation. Very clean. Only a slight suggestion of warming from alcohol. Probably the best O-fest I have had to date, very enjoyable."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry lager yeast scent along with a smooth malty aroma. Caramel, Munich, and pale malts are present with a slight yeast fruitiness. The taste is good. It has a very smooth, malt flavor that is light with just the right amount of sweetness. It goes down easy and finishes a bit dry with some earthy character. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I love the flavor of this one. It's incredibly smooth and malty; highly drinkable."
"D: I'm torn on this one. I love this beer, and could probably drink several if I tried. But the roastyness and higher alcohol might get overpowering after 2 or 3 bottles."
"Drinkability - I generally really enjoy Oktoberfests but this was not my favorite. While it did go down smooth, the aftertaste left something to be desired."
"Initial taste of sweet malt with a very slight syrup taste, but not cloying; you can really taste the toasty malt. Hops are evident in background. The beer actually becomes more balanced as it warms. While this is not my favorite lager style, this is one of the most drinkable available. No overwhelming sweet malt often found with this style. Another quality brew from Great Lakes."
"This beer poured a clear medium amber color and formed a nice foamy white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, hops and caramel. The flavor was of malt, caramel and hint of pepper. The body was medium light and slightly creamy. The finish was touch bitter, yet sweet. This would make a nice session beer."
"Drinkability: Perfect for a fall night. beers like this beg to be drunk during a cold evening when preparing for fall. Kudoas for all the companies that are releasing their Oktoberfests much earlier this year, giving more time to enjoy the taste."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Carbonation and body are medium in this brew. There is just a bit of warmth as it goes down, suggestion of alcohol. Overall pretty sweet on the palate. The beer is easy to drink, this is one I could see myself drinking all night, especially if I had a large liter glass stein. This is a brew I'll definitely buy again, though probably not this season as I may be out to try other oktoberfest style brews."
"Eric"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is crystal clear and the color of copper, with a thinnish white head (perhaps I poured too slowly). The aroma is nice, malty nice but about as neutral as you'd expect for the style. The flavor is sweet malts with a not-too-bitter dry aftertaste. Just a little bitter. Nicely chuggable as an oktoberfest should be."
"Pours a pale amber/ earthy color with a white head. Aromas that ore earthy and a European malt sweetness. In the taste, a lighter malt, and a nice sweetness. It is even a bit fruity. There is a small hop aftertaste and also leaving the mouth dry, but refreshed. A nice Oktoberfest from Great Lakes, nice flavor and not over bearring."
"Zum wohl!"
""
"All in all, a nice offering. It easy to drink, and if I were a marzen fan, I would probably enjoy more of these. I see this pairing well with sausages and the like."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking with an aftertaste that keeps you coming back."
"On draught at the brewpub. Clear dark copper color with a medium thick white head with fair retention. Speckled lacing throughout the glass. Sweet malty aroma along with a touch of caramel and nuts. Medium-bodied and smooth with a strong malt presence, as well as caramel and a bit of hops to liven it up. The finish is mostly sweet malt with a light hop finish. Above average."
"Dark amber color with very little head to speak of. Spicey, toasted grains, nutty aromas in the nose. Same notes in the taste as the nose and some citrus, orange flavors trail. As it warmed alcohol strength yeilds to sweeter malt characters of toffee and caramel, and peppery, coriander notes. Rock candy sweetness in the finish as well as fuller hop notes. Thin body and a pleasent mouth that is watery but leaves carbonated creaminess behind. Overall a nice crisp autumn like beer spices indicative for the style and a good benchmark."
"A good Octoberfest."
"Aroma is very malty, has subtle hops, slight spice, and a touch of citrus. The flavor is domianted by malt, subtle spice--not overwrought like some beers of this ilk, and a little pumpkin. The mouth is good, bright on the front, malty and dry on the back. Very drinkable, as it is extremely well balanced. Another winner from GLBC."
"Overall: A nice interpretation with an interesting fruitiness to it. Pick some up as it's drinkability is perfect for an autumn afternoon!"
"Pours a pale orange, with crystal clarity and a creamy, off-white one 1/2 finger head. Decent retention and lots of spotty, sticky lacing. Toasted pale and munich malt in the nose, with faint hallertau notes. Rich munich flavor upfront, follwed by toasted amber malt and a well-placed hallertau flavor. Dextrins and noble hop bitterness make-up the slightly drying aftertaste, and I like that there is more hop flavor than bitterness, and more biscuity malt taste than sweetness. The lighter carbonation and moderate body allow a creamy mouthfeel that is a good medium of crisp to slick. The finish is a touch residual, with plenty of german hop character to match. This has a superb drinkability, and is balanced through and through."
"Poured a nice caramel color with a small frothy head with good sustain. A gentle malty smell set the tone for a big malt flavor, yet without the sometimes cloying sweetness that can result in brews like this. A subtle nutty flavor added some depth to the taste. The body was medium-light and creamy with moderate carbonation. A great offering from a consistently outstanding brewery. Go find some for yourself."
"On tap and poured into my new and now beloved liter stein at the 2006 Great Lakes Oktoberfest. The place was packed (two and a half hour wait when we walked in at 9pm!), but we did manage grab a table in the pub for a few hours before heading across town for a late bite. Back to the beer, I was immediately struck by the color, clarity, and impressive head. Indeed this brew is quite the looker. Pours a crystal clear coppered, orange leaning, amber with minimal carbonation, and a thick, voluminous light brown head. Retention is top notch. Aroma is stylistically correct but a touch light to my preferences. Notes of caramel syrup, Vienna/German malts, and that very autumn, almost pumpkin like smell associated with Marzens were all present but on the faint side. Flavor was caramel and toast, very German and autumnal but again a bit light. Subtle amounts of raisins, a very light fruitiness, and a brushing of hops finishes off the job. Body is medium, lightly carbonated, and rich with out any muddling or lack of cleanliness. Drinability is through the roof. Very nice example of an Oktoberfest. Would drink again if given the opportunity."
"When this one is released in bottles definitely buy some. If you're into this style a must try."
"Had this on draught at the brewpub. Poured a nice dark amber color. Took a whiff and could smell some sweetness but nothing to strong. Upon first sipp I was initially underwhelmed. I was expecting more. But wait. The after taste brought the hop taste about and this beer rounded out. I found myself enjoying this beer more and more with every sip. Give this beer a chance and you'll be happy you did."
"2L German Growler."
"This was on tap at Gibbies Irish Pub. The first thing I notice was that the smell was sharp and unlike typical Oktoberfest contenders. It was served to me with a nice lacey head. First taste was sweet and malty with five times the flavor of Sam Adams version of this seasonal. This had a fruity finish and I didnt regret ordering another. Even my girl said this was the best Oktoberfest she had ever tried and she has half the experience I do. Thank you Great Lakes for releasing such a satisfying seasonal."
"Mmmm ... down to the bar ..."
"Appearance: Perfect, caramel orange tint nice foamy cream hued head, with rings evenly spread for the lace. Aroma: Rich toasted malts with a sryupy malt backbone bringing out the sweetness with the hops tip toeing onto the scene. Taste: Full malty and hoppier than most awesome Ofest the best spicy finish I have yet to taste from any of the Oktoberfests I've sampled, mildly hopped at 35 IBUs. Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly sticky in texture with smooth carbonation. Drinkabiltiy: All I can say is by the liter."
