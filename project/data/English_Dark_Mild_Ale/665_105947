3.57,8.2,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Overall: I expected this to be identical to the Generous Ale that came in the same Guinness Christmas pack. Thankfully it wasn't; more flavor and generally sturdier overall. I might not rush back to it, but it's a nice offering.","illpass78","Jan 09, 2015"

The taste is mostly malt, with an underlying sweetness.  Slim body...thinner than it could be.  This is an average, uninteresting brew.","Suds","Dec 29, 2014"

3,-9.1,,,,,,"poured from a 16 oz. can it looks like a glass of coke smells of slightly sweet cherries and roasted malt. taste of roasted malt is weak and watery with no complexity to it. mouthfeel is light and watery the can says its a full bodied winter ale i found that to be very disappointing. not something i would buy again.","billybob","Dec 10, 2014"

2.75,-16.7,,,,,,"If your looking for something with an interesting style and complex flavor, look elsewhere. It didn't really stick out to me as anything special and I could name a number of beers in the same category that I've enjoyed more. Its a totally different beast than alot of other Smithwick's which is sad to say. HOWEVER, I can see it being enjoyable none the less.  It isn't as boring as a drugstore beer and there is a somewhat different taste and if you like Guinness, there is a very distant flavor similar to that in it. For the price, I guess not awful, but you deserve better, my friends.","Cayce","Jul 05, 2014"

3.05,-7.6,4,3.25,2.75,2.75,3.25,"O: Not particularly impressive. Would definitely benefit from some more flavors, especially spices like cloves in a winter seasonal ale. Reminds me of a mix beween Guinness draught and Smithwick's red ale. The price and easy-drinking makes this a nice winter session beer, and the value isn't bad.","bareju","0"
