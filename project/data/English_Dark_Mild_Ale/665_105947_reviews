"Typically English beer taste, just not my mainstay"

"O -- A dryer, rather than sweeter, version of the style, but well worth trying to understand -- and enjoy -- the style and how complex a low ABV beer can be."

"14.9 oz can poured into an English pint, it's okay, tastes pretty similar to regular Smithwick's"

"It is easy enough to put down and I certainly wouldn't refuse one if offered, but I am not going to go out of my way to grab more."

"Overall: I expected this to be identical to the Generous Ale that came in the same Guinness Christmas pack. Thankfully it wasn't; more flavor and generally sturdier overall. I might not rush back to it, but it's a nice offering."
"O- English dark milds are session beers, and that's what this is.  It's not complex, but is very drinkable"
"Its ok, tastes like an off the shelf at the grocery store kinda beer, bud-wiser or some other college frat party yellow piss beer. large hit of nearly flavorless but stinging carbonation and hopes in the beginning mild hint of beer taste in the middle and slightly a mild random grocery store beer taste at the end."
"Yet another Smithwick's affair. I swear they're all identical, much like Newcastle."

"Dark brown in color.  The beer has a nice head and a clarity when held to the light.  The smell is faint...distant malt.  The taste is mostly malt, with an underlying sweetness.  Slim body...thinner than it could be.  This is an average, uninteresting brew."
""
"Overall - Not the worst thing I have ever tasted this beer is actually well balanced and has some pretty good hop character and a nice enough mouth feel it is even one of the better and more balanced beers to be produced by Smithwick's"

"Im new to reviewing but i really enjoyed this beer"
""
"poured from a 16 oz. can it looks like a glass of coke smells of slightly sweet cherries and roasted malt. taste of roasted malt is weak and watery with no complexity to it. mouthfeel is light and watery the can says its a full bodied winter ale i found that to be very disappointing. not something i would buy again."

"If your looking for something with an interesting style and complex flavor, look elsewhere. It didn't really stick out to me as anything special and I could name a number of beers in the same category that I've enjoyed more. Its a totally different beast than alot of other Smithwick's which is sad to say. HOWEVER, I can see it being enjoyable none the less.  It isn't as boring as a drugstore beer and there is a somewhat different taste and if you like Guinness, there is a very distant flavor similar to that in it. For the price, I guess not awful, but you deserve better, my friends."

"A really poor beer I'm afraid and one that was both too bland and too simple with not enough going on to distract from what was basically bitterness and some roasted flavours. Avoid this one if you like beer with some flavour."
"O: Not particularly impressive. Would definitely benefit from some more flavors, especially spices like cloves in a winter seasonal ale. Reminds me of a mix beween Guinness draught and Smithwick's red ale. The price and easy-drinking makes this a nice winter session beer, and the value isn't bad."
