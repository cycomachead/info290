"O - A very nice English dark mild. Great as a beer to match with a meal (it's not overpowering) or a multiple pint beer at the pub. Easy to drink without sacrificing on flavour and bitterness."
"D - Not bad. Fairly easy drinking, sessionable dark ale."
"Poured dark red/mahogany with some deep orange hues. Filtered, with a cream coloured, foamy head. Dense lace, good retention. Quite a nice nose (if this really is an English Mild), some chocolate, toasty dark breads, some grains and a bit of sweetness. Maybe a bit of diacetyl. Taste has a bit more of the diacetyl butter, nuts, toasty grains, less chocolate, and a bit of roast in the finish. Light fruitiness. More graininess in the finish, slight bitterness too. Medium mouthfeel, and a sorta low carbonation. A pleasant beer, nothing I'd seek out regularly, but solid in its own right."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"Overall, a decent dark ale that is sessionable and worth another go"
"A tasty dark ale, sessionable and well-balanced for sure although 'mild' might not be the most appropriate descriptor because the flavour is fairly full for a 5%er. Any fan of brown ales would have little difficulty appreciating this stuff. Definitely worth a try, and a solid start to this season's OCB sampler. I'll definitely keep an eye out for more stuff from this brewery in the future - really wish I knew about these guys back in uni, because they would have been a nice change from Sleeman and Wellington."
"Overall â€“ There are some interesting flavours going on here. It's not really how I like my beers to taste but I can appreciate the fact that it is at least interesting. Give it a try if you happen to see it."

"D: A delicious, easy-drinking ale that's well worth a try and perfect for sessioning (5% ABV, yes, but tolerance and patience take care of that)."
"If it is impossible to transplant the charm, character and conviviality of the traditional English countryside pub to North America, at least we can enjoy the flavour of a good dark mild ale that brings back images of such a place. I feel most fortunate to have a brewery offer such a thing so close to home. I'll be sure to thank them with many repeat purchases."
"Overall, really a really great beer. Worth seeking out."
"341ml bottle from the brewery. Deep copper in colour with dark brown edges and a ring of eggshell white head. Some stringy lace on the pint glass. Smell and taste are nutty malts, bread dough, toasted biscuit, floral hops, toffee sweetness, cream, roasted barley, and very light chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is thinnish medium, average carbonation, crisp bite mid-body, mildly bitter and dry, chestnut finish. Drinks like a session brown ale, though not as tasty as Grand River Mill Race (despite the higher gravity). Regardless, it's one of the best dark ales in the province. Give this a try if you haven't already."
"Good stuff, well worth a try!"
"Very smooth on the palate and very clean fermentation with little in the way of esters, besides a very slight buttery taste that complements the malt nicely."
"Darught at Woolwich Arms in Guelph, ON- Deep amber pour with a decent sized frothy beige head. Chocolate and malts in the nose, with a mild dose of hops and molasses. Fairly sweet and nutty, with a touch of bitterness from the hopping. Lingering mild bitter finish, with malts also left behind. Good."
"Draught at C'est What? Deep amber colouration to the body with a small off-white head that left some decent lacing. Gives off a sweet, bready aroma, with lots of chocolate and a bit of spice and nut. Creamy, smooth taste with fruity malts and caramel overtones. Medium bodied, but perhaps a touch over-carbonated (I'd love to try this on cask). Pretty decent beer from F&M and a nice easy quaffer."
"Overall, I think that this is a great and sessionable brew. Try it!!"
"D: Hell yeah!"
"This was the cask version, dry hopped. Pours a slightly hazed brown/red, small off white head forms, nice lacing. Smell is spicy floral, caramel, chocolate, slightly nutty and grainy, some roast in the finish. Taste is chocolate and nuts, citrus and floral in the finish, some roast. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, nice and smooth. Not bad, little bit different from the normal version, nice to try."
"A decent beer, worth a try."
"This is a very tasty and unique ale...a Hybrid, I think. Some Nut brown character with dark ale profile...nice blend....possibly the best ale from this brewer."
"The overall character of the cask version is very similar to on-tap. Quite clear with a nice chestnut brown colour. Good head retention. Malt is much more prominent with even less contribution from the hops. Toffee and caramel with a bit of chocolate. The low carbonation seemed to emphasize lightness in the body. Quite drinkable and good for a session brew."
"I could drink this and look at its dark colour, and it is somewhat rich in chocolate malts and caramel. Bit of roast.. But sourdough mid sip?Medium mouthfeel. On tap at Bow and Arrow BarTowel night, suitable understated carbonation. Unique and worth points."
