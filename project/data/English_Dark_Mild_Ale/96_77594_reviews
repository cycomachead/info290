"Overall: A nicely malty brew with a sensibly slackened alcohol presence. I thought it was a pleasant and it was gone in a flash."
""
""
"This beers pours a dark copper color body with a small head that doesnt' hang around long. The smell has a nice inviting malt characters to it. The taste upfront has nice maltness then on the back of the tonuge after it has warmed up a little bit then comes some chocolate and roasted malt flavors with a nice hop presence but not over powering. The mouthfeel is good and overall a pretty good beer."
"Poured dark brown, two shades shy of being black. Little foam, very fizzy, settles out. Funky nutty smell. Taste is sweet, nutty, and cola flavored. Earthy? (from notes, but in hindsight not really). A little like flat soda. Or a funkier nut brown. Mild understates it. Hard to fully describe."

"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - I honestly cannot tell the difference between drinking this and drinking a soft drink. If I didn't have any previous knowledge that this was a beer, I'd think I was drinking flat fountain Dr. pepper mixed with cola, A & W root beer, and Sprite. This is really just a watery mess. I picked the right beer to have before leaving for work. I was worried about finishing one in time, but I've drank 3/4 of it in the time it took to write this short review. Insanely drinkable, but that's not a good thing in this case. Sorry Magic Hat, but you continue to underwhelm my taste buds. At least I can finish it and it's not a drain pour."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid sessionable beer to drink for a while."

"Overall: not anything super special but has some nice flavors and is fairy drinkable."
"Magic Hat +/- is a clear, very lively copper beer with a thick, elastic, off white foam. There's a little sweet, dark malt in the nose with a touch of herbal, medicinal hops. It has a smooth, medium body. The finish is a little gritty. There's not a ton of flavor up front. Upon the finish, a resiny, botanical bitterness rolls in with the sweetness of cake or bread. It lingers for a while. This is kind of like a lightened-up brown ale. It's mild enough to be inoffensive and it's pretty unique."
""
"I wish there were more beers like this available on the market, of course no one else would buy them."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite disappointing. I've had better beers with half the ABV, so it can't be just that. It's drinkable, but only just."
""
""
""
"Watery thin palate with some added mineral and dry qualities. Dry roasted and heavily toasted malts. Has some flavor, a little on the darker side, and is easy to drink. Good session ale for sure."
""
"O: Nothing about this really stood out. From the lack of lace and head, to the mild notes on the nose and the very mild taste, I wasn't really impressed by any part of this brew."
""
"O: This is, to my knowledge, my first exposure to an English Mild, so its hard to compare to style.  However, my overall impression is a sessionable brew with an aroma that is kind of blah, but a taste which is actually rather nice.  I won't seek it out again (or the style in general for that matter), but I'll have no issue finishing the last bottle that's in my fridge.  "
"This isn't bad, but not great either. Again, the creamy, butterscotch-like notes put me off of another Magic Hat offering."
""
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped: B142-61-01480113. Sampled on April 6, 2012. The pour is a handsome dark amber with a short-lived off-white head that becomes a ring. On the nose is a subtle profile of sweet malts and light hops and a little nutty. The body is in the medium range but smooth. The taste is sweet up front and then mildly bitter. It is a drinkable session beer."
""
"Hey, this'll be my first Dark Mild review. I've partaken in several pints of Cigar City's El Lector, but never in an environment conductive to reviewing. It pours out a deep red with some brown tinges to it. A centimeter of head steadily crowns the brew. The aroma is primarily nutty, with chocolate, roastiness, and just a touch of hops. The taste is good, it's got a nice complexity to it, with the nuttiness, roastiness, chocolate, and a touch of dark fruits all intertwining. The finish is earthy and hoppy before leaving a nice clean, dry feeling on the palate. The drinkability is, as to be expected, very good. Overall, it's a good Mild. I'd really like to find a honest Dark Mild from England to compare this to."
"This beer isn't bad, but it does lacks substance. Nothing exciting here."
""
""
"Pours a dark chestnut color under a slim, frothy ring of a head that dissolves to nothing. Nutty malt, cereal grain, and some dark - slightly tart - fruitiness. A little too clean, which seems to be an issue with Magic Hat beers over the last several years. Dark, dry malt and cocoa flavor, but somewhat watery. Faint toast and fruit, finishing dry. Medium-light body with too much carbonation at first. Too sterile and bland to be all that enjoyable. Not terrible, just not good."
""
""
"Slight citrus bite of hops up front followed by a roasted nut flavor with a bready mouthfeel that quickly gives way to a flat fruit flavor- plum. There is a touch of chocolate in the back of the mouth. A solid beer, very interesting with lots of subtlety."
""
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the Spring mix-pack at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a brick-red body with nearly an inch of khaki-colored head. Smells sweet and maybe even a touch sour. Nut, chocolate, and roast dominate the flavor. Light to medium in body with ample carbonation. While the aroma is a bit off-putting, the flavor is great. Spot-on for the style, and that's not easy to come by."
"O: A dumbed-down version of a classic style. Can't say that too many times about American brewers when they brew classic English styles, but it certainly applies here. Still worth a try, though"
""
"O/D-Like most Magic Hat brews, this one has its bright spots but is mostly lackluster. I had no true complaints about this beer but it was pretty bland. I will easily finish the glass and will also give kudos to Magic Hat for trying to brew some of the lesser utilized styles such as this."
"Not my favorite by Magic Hat but it's certainly worth a try!"

"Grassy sort of smell. Poured a deep coppery brown with a decent dark beige head. Head reduces to a light film in a minute, no apreciable lacing. Taste is very nice, but unexciting. Almost minty sweet with the barest hint of bittering. Definately mild, worth a try."
"It is what it is and it hits all of the marks sufficient enough to be a Mild Ale but just does not seem to have the soul of that style. Perhaps due to it being not ""real ale"" and most of the milds I have run into have been on cask or bottle conditioned."
""
"Overall - Average, too easy on flavors, and nothing special. Its not bad at all but, its too weak for any seasoned craft drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall it is drinkable, though unremarkable. It characteristics appear to be representative of the style, so its worth a try."
"Overall one of the better Magic Hat beers I have had with smooth sweet flavors and a nice smooth body. Would have another."
""
""
"It has kind of a Belgian feel to it, though otherwise it's pretty straightforward English brown ale. (I've never heard of a ""dark mild ale"" as BA calls it, but it is dark, and mild.)"
""
"Overall an average brew. A little light on flavor for me. I prefer El Lector by Cigar City."
""
"Not sure if +/- means = 0 is the math they were shooting for. I really can't say it is bad. You could drink them fine but it just isn't worth buying craft beer for this little flavor. Almost tastes like an unhopped homebrew kit made exclusively from liquid malt extract."
"Pours a pale dark copper color with a light beige head forming thick and dwindling slow, visually I'm all about this beer the smell leaves a bit to be desired with light dark roasts. That's about it light fruity accents generic tart cherry with cereal toasted grains. Flavor is light but has a creamy, dark roasted malts with fruit notes. Pretty mild ale, that shows me one thing Magic Hat has been going toward the mainstream. This beer tastes like a pseudo craft from a mislabeled ABI brew. Mouthfeel is light moderate carbonation slightly soft textures going on, easy to drink. A no brainer ale with enough flavor to help you get through it however it doesn't really push the envelope or do anything for beer."
""
"Lacking some complexity. Has a nice sweet flavor up front but quickly drops off and not much else takes its place. I guess it pretty much fits the bill for a Mild Ale, but it is not something I'd go out of my way to get."

"First off, what's up with this label? Intriguing I guess. Maybe that's why I grabbed it from my friend's fridge to try it. Poured into a standard pint glass. No head at all. Moderate fizz of carbonation. The body was the color of cola. Smell was non-existent. Taste was just a bit of malt and some caramel. Mouthfeel was thin and watery. This beer just had no redeeming qualities to it at all. Just plain boring. Mostly minus for me."

"It lives up to its name. Its neither here nor there. I could do with or without it. Plus or minus. Whatever. Cool label and way to nail the name....another plus."

"O - very good session beer, probably my favourite magic hat beer"
