3.33,-0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a flute glass. Pours a dark brown amber, light off-white head, some lacing. Light aroma of sweet caramel malt, nuts. A mild tasting dark ale with light toasted malt and chocolate. Finish has some nice coffee and roasted malt. Everything just a little light tasting. Pleasant, but not exceptional.","LiquidAmber","0"

3.55,5.7,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall: an interesting English Dark Mild Ale - has some grain and fruit flavours, with a touch of bitterness. Much better than most milds I have had, however it is 5% ABV, so maybe it isn't a true-to-style mild...","SmashPants","Feb 29, 2012"

2.41,-28.3,3.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Pours a clear dark brown with a 2 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty much only of toasty malt/grains. There is a slight onion aroma as the beer warms. Taste is of toasty/burnt malt and a slight onion/garlic flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer. As it stands, Whistler is 0 for 2 in my book with their beers.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 30, 2011"

3.62,7.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I don't know if this is classified right as an ""English Dark Mild Ale"". I can't really say, but it is a simple beer with a decent amount of flavor. Seems more like a smoked beer to me, but I have no clue. I have had other beers from this brewery and this is easily the best one they make.","yuriruley","Dec 21, 2010"
2.99,-11,3.5,2,3.5,3,3,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark amber brown with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is nutty, slightly smokey, with caramel and a nice vomity note. Ugh. Fortunately that doesn't come through in the taste. Flavor is toasted caramel and bread with a whisper of smoke and a mineral water finish. Pretty thin with prickly carbonation.","illidurit","Jul 17, 2010"
3.55,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"My first offering from this brewery, and I'm moderately impressed. More of a nut brown ale than the given classification, but whatever, it's an easy drinking, keep 'em comin', kind of beer. That poor mammoth could use a keg of this, or so, I would imagine!","biboergosum","Jul 13, 2010"

3.63,8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Final Notes: A tasty no-frills session beer that would pair well against a meal or for a night at the bar with friends. Nothing really special, but I can see myself buying it again.","bagpiper2005","May 06, 2010"

2.63,-21.7,3.5,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Had a bottle of this back in Sept. '09. The colour was a very dark brown with no head. The aroma was quite roasty with hints of day old coffee and bits of hops. On the palate, it was thin and had some lightly roasted malt and a smidge of hops but all in all it was rather blah.","slaintemhor","Mar 05, 2010"

4.02,19.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4," Strong aroma of sweet, nutty malt, with a hint of chocolate syrup and mild English hops. Palate is mild dark malt, with a pleasantly sweet, nutty character. A bit of chocolate syrup and Some mild notes of dark fruit and just a very slight bitterness from the hops. Finish is smooth and moderately sweet. The body is creamy and smooth, but just a touch foamy. This is a nicely drinkable session ale, and of a style that I don't get to try very often. Interesting stuff.","ElGordo","Feb 17, 2009"
