"Very light taste of brown sugar and chocolate"
""
"Overall: not a bad beer - it certainly has a nice flavour profile - but too flat in feel and too limited in flavour for my liking. I will admit that I feel the same way about most English mild ales. Reasonable price at around AU$48 a case or so, but I really would rather pay an extra $10 and just get Coopers' Best Extra Stout."

"This beer poured out as a clear brown color, it had a good amount of darkness to it which seemed to hold up against the light. The head was thin and cream colored, it didn't really lace or have much retention to it. The smell of the beer had some brown sugar notes along with some raosted malts and hints of coffee. The taste of the beer had a pretty good bitterness to it mostly from the dark malts I think. Could have been from the hops as well. The mouthfeel of this beer is on the thinner side,but remains pretty drinkable. Overall this beer isn't too bad, I wouldn't have a problem with drinking it again."

"It pours a dark murky copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is chocolate,caramel and fruity spicy hops,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel and has tastes of light coffee,chocolate malts,dark cherries and finished with a touch of spicy hops and overall yeah its alright and better than the macro offerings out there but thats it."
"A beer that I believe perfect for a cold winters night watching the football. It is a tasty dark ale that still allows for drinking during a prolonged session. The biggest disappointment is the carbonation that is a little too much."
"Food match: Meat pie with mushy peas (classic Australian fare!)."
"An easy drinking beer with a nice touch of malt complexity."
"This is a good sessionable dark beer."
"The beer pours a medium brown color with a white head. The aroma is dark malt with some caramel and toffee. The flavor is dark malt with some light coffee. The mouthfeel is watery with medium carbonation."
"Nothing to this. Should a brown ale act like a summer drinker? Even to style this could have a lot more character."
"Slightly watery, high carbonation."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, there are definitely a lot of dark & mild beers out there that I would choose before this one."
"The taste is also mild, mostly just toasty with light hints of chocolate, coffee, and singed leaves. It is neither sweet nor bitter, just dry and watery. It is thin and very light. The finish is little like old coffee grounds and burnt toast in water. Although it grows on me a bit, with the wateriness decreasing, it doesn't do much. I haven't had many dark milds, but Moorehouse's Black Cat is far superior."
"Dirty, dark brown almost black. Huge, fluffy off-white head. I'm waiting for it to warm up (it's not icy cold though, out of the fridge for about 20min) because it just isn't giving much on the nose. A bit of chicory and a touch of nuts but I'm almost snorting the beer to get it. Creamy mouthfeel with a bit of coffee and mild bitterness. Med-body, pleasant enough beer but not the best from the Coopers stable."
"Nice and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Most of the Coopers have been poopers, but this Dark Ale, well, it's downright acceptable."
"Fairly light mouthfeel and a lack of body make this one not a personal favorite. It is one however that is light in ABV and fairly drinkable for that reason alone."
"Poured a 12.7oz bottle into my Brother Thelonious goblet. When poured, this beer really reminded me the way that root beer pours. Pretty much the same color, and same effervescent head that quickly disappears. The aroma is of chocolate malts, brown sugar, and just a bit of plum. The flavor is much the same with the chocolate malts dominating the flavor profile but just a hint of plum skins, and apple comes through. The mouthfeel is light and very dry, almost a little to dry actually. This would be a great lunch beer. Something you could sit down to a meal with and enjoy 2 or 3 and still be able to fully function afterwards."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color. You can see the tiny bits of grain floating in this beer (almost motionless). 1/4 inch head with low retention and no lacing. Smells of some sweet malt, but mostly chocolate/brown sugar aromas. Fits the style. Very smooth, low carbonation, and fairly crisp mouth feel. Tastes of roasted malts all throughout the beer, especially in the aftertaste. There is a coffee flavor, but an additional more memorable bitterness. Overall, I was expecting more body than there was, too watery for my taste. Not as good as I thought it would be - not really worth a try."
"Not a bad drop. I will pick up some more given its quite cheap."
"D - In the end, its just a little to sweet for my tastes. Despite being a nice sessionable change of pace in terms of color and roasted flavors, this beer comes a little too close to tasting like a cola."
"D: Nevertheless, I did enjoy it!!! Although Carlton Black (dark ale in my books) had more bite. I would definately have again"
"M%D-Light body and a bit overcarbonated i could drink this beer again but im not sure why I ever would"
"I although have cooked with it and have found decent results with marinades and bastes"
"D - If you have the opition, pass."
"Worth a try..."
"A very deep copper colour with a short-lived creamy head. I got very little aroma and the taste was pretty bland as well. There's a moderate bready, dark chocolate taste, a bit roasty but nothing lip-smacking. It's a bit like a macro and Coopers are on the verge of being a macro. There's a slight metallic note kinda like Tooheys Old but not as bad. Mouthfeel is Ok, a bit thin. All in all this is rather underwhelming. Not bad by any stretch but just unexciting. I'd drink it again but never buy it again."
"Poured a dark chocolatey colour with very little head that disappears after a little while. Is rather cloudy and has a very sweet chocolate/caramel aroma. Taste is quite sweet, caramelly and light (lighter flavour than expected) with a mild fizz. Not as heavy a mouthfeel as expected from this type of beer but still has some body. Something I could drink a few more of."
"I tried a six pack of six different Coopers brews that I picked up from Total Wine and More in Fort Myers. This was a nice one. Poured a rich brown color with a nice tan head. Smelled of roasted malts, hint of caramel, some brewed coffee. Tasted of roasted coffee with a good hop balance and a semi dry finish. Very nice for an organic beer."
"It's a very drinkable beer, but ultimately a little disappointing. It's frustrating just how short this falls of something great."
"D = This would be a good session beer, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a mild ale with a little more mellow, sweet flavors than a paler mild."
"Pours a cloudy and hazed brown with a head that doesn't stick around at all. Nose is malty and caramel sweet. Flavor is a fair bit of coffee, but a lot of bitter on there too which I think detracts. As you go on the bitter leaves and the smoother coffee tones dominate more so. As time goes on, even those tones get washed out by a watery flavor profile. Potential, but doesn't come through when it needs to. Feel is a bit lower on carbonation. On the liquid level it is fairly average. Overall a fairly low performance on this one. It's the first I have tried of this style, so I get another tally mark on the stats list. But I can't say this is really worth cracking open."
"Pretty drinkable but I keep wanting more flavor from this. I really don't think I would buy this again."
"This was the first time I've tried swirling the yeast before pouring it in a Coopers, and it is the most I've ever enjoyed a Coopers. Not sure whether this is more due to the better mixing of the yeast, or that this is just a better beer than the others? Either way, this is a very good beer, with heaps of flavour for just 4.5% ABV. Being a Coopers, it is priced competitively and I will definitely be buying it again."
"D: A good beer, easily drinkable, definitely mild on the hops, didn't taste any in here. Would be a good session beer, just got to be careful on that next pour, these Coopers beers seem to have a lot of sediment to them. Probably the only English Mild I have ever had, they are a hard style to find, but I think a good introduction to the style, though I don't have much to go on."
"This beer pours a brown color with tawny hues when held up to light. The head is small, and recedes within seconds into almost no lacing. The aroma is of very faint chocolate, and nutty caramel notes. It is a nice aroma, but is so faint that it is grueling to find. The taste is of a lot more noticable than the aroma. It is of nutty caramel with hints of dark chocolate and coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with appropriately low carbonatnion. Overall, this is a decent beer. I would drink it again, but it is certainly not a priority."
"It's not something I'll buy again, and I'm not even particularly happy I've now tried it. It's one to avoid if you were looking for a thick texture and some complexity."
"Got this bottle in an auction package, hope it comes at a good price in the down under. I wouldnÂ’t mind sucking a sixer of these boys down."
"I'd much rather drink a porter or stout that has a similar ABV% but much more flavour."
"12.7 oz. bottle, conditioned, with no freshness date. It pours into my nonic a deep, coppery-brown, with medium to high carbonation leading up to a loose, half-inch tan head that reduces to a small collar, depositing little lace. The aroma is simple yet pleasant, with notes of caramel and nutty malts. The flavor adds to this toasted malts, molasses, apple/dark fruits, smoke?, and some grassy hops behind it all contributing a mild bitterness. On the palate, it feels light to medium, smooth, with medium carbonation and finish. Overall, an easy-to-drink real ale that would make a nice session brew."
"Pours dark with very little head that disappears right away. Little to no aromas but there is a hint of coffe and malt. When you take your first sip, don't blink, you might miss the flavor. A quick hint of coffee hits the palate and then nothing. The thinness disapates quickly in your mouth with a dry finish and nothing. Almost like you didn't drink anything. Definately not a fan."
"I definitely liked this better than the Sparkling Ale. While still cold I got some nice cocoa flavors that likened this beer to a light porter. Still sweet yeast flavors overcome the grains and make for a somewhat bland drink. Not a bad option if I were in Australia, but not worth picking up as an import."
"A- Brown in color no head to speak of. S - Lots of nuts and some faint spice with a little sweetness. T - More nuts some toffee and sugar. M - Kind of light with little going on. D - It is still easy to drink, mainly as it's a low ABV. It isn't offensive and probably pairs well with some meals. Just an average beer overall."
"Overall, not the best offereing from Coopers, but if you're looking for a six-pack to bring to a party, this would be a great non-lager snag that would go down well with macro drinkers"
"This beer pours a dark black color with little to no head. The smell is pleasant, much like a black lager with a plentitude of dark malts and no hops. The taste is much like a black lager: with the same taste and body as a stout but the effervescence of a light lager. There is also a bit of a nut taste to it, much like the nut brown offered by the same brand. The aftertaste is perhaps whatÂ’s most special: there is the same lingering of dark malts and also the hint of candy and molasses. A good beer... I donÂ’t know if I'd seek it out, but still well worth a try."
"Dark brown color, with a frothy tan head that didn't last long. A small amount of sediment is present. Taste and mouthfeel are very mild, as the style suggests. It feels almost like perrier, with a little less carbonation. I can feel the roasted malt flavors trying to get through, but it's just not strong enough. Maybe this style just isn't for me, but it seems sort of like a watered down porter or stout."
"Pours a deep clear mahogany with minimal head that is soon gone. Also noted, bits of yeast in bottom of the glass. Nose is of caramelly dark malt. Has a rich mellow well-balanced taste that's easy to swallow. Finish is smooth and easy drinking. I find this is a pretty good brew, could easily throw a few down."
"Drinks okay, should've known a beer this low in ABV wouldn't fare well with it's trans-pacific journey"
"Overall, it is drinkable. Goes down rather easy. Certainly lacking in some respects, but worth trying if you haven't had it."
"Easy to drink, but not one of my favorite Coopers offerings. Go for the stout instead."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but easy to forget"
"A flat start for a first look. The head races away like it has to be somewhere. Theres some sediment at the bottom that sort of replaces the bubbling you might expect since there is none. A decent syrupy scotch brown/garnet hue. The aroma is a like hazelnut with some toasty malts and folgers coffee grounds. The taste has some slight dry malts that gice a roasted chestnut flavor at first. Then some light whole-grain wheat toast. The palate is nice and medium bodied, yet full. Very drinkable and could become sessionable very easy."
"Drinkability: Won't buy it again, but I wouldn't turn down a pint, either."
"I'd drink this for morning tea (if I was allowed to)."
"Average, middle of the road beer that did nothing for me. Aroma weak, appearance average, and the flavor was okay, but nothing stood out in the taste. Really enjoyed the CooperÂ’s Sparkling Ale and Pale Ale, and was looking forward to another fine beer from Cooper's, but think IÂ’ll pass on this one."
"Cooper's Dark Ale pours a dark brown with lots of yeast floating throughout the glass (I didn't realize I should have decanted it), from a brown 12.7 ounce bottle. Aroma is tough to pick up on this one. Not much there. Taste is fairly light too, especially for something this color. Mild malty and nutty flavors I guess. Not bad, but not particularly flavorful. Worth a try."
"Poured a very deep mahogony color with initail large puffy off-white head. Head quickly fell to a thin coating with no lacing present. Smell is a rich combination of roasted malt caramel. Taste is even better than the smell with a nice coffee taste present in addition to the roasted malt and caramel. Fiinished with a slight dryness which is the perfect ending to this beer. Very drinkable. Perfect session beer."
"Plenty of baker / dry chocolate, there is a charred woody presencet that gives it a nice balancer with its bitterness but also some depth. Fruitiness is present but more or less an afterthought and never really makes a name for itself other than suggestions at best. From my short experience this seems more like a subdued porter or a brown than a true english mild. All said its still not that great, but decent."
"I'm unable to compare Coppers Dark Ale to other English Dark Meeks because it's the first one that I've had. If you're looking for an easy drinking, sessionable dark ale that looks the part, give this one a go. If you're looking for even a modest amount of flavor, keep looking."
"Dark Mild Ale? Too mild... Pours out to a dark brown color with no head or lace. Appears to have low carbonation. Aromas of, well, near nothing. Is that malt I smell? I can't tell. Flavors were flat and mild; roasted malt, some grains and cocoa. Bland. Mouthfeel was good, as the carbonation made it's way to the tongue and was well received. Drinkability isn't great. I'm suprised that Coopers can't do better than this. Look to the Sparkling Ale instead."
"Drinkability: I admit I don't know as much about the style as I probably should, but I like this beer and I'd drink it again."
"Ahh, another Coopers beer...poured a dark brown, just short of black color, and a small white head. Sediment still ingered towards the bottom of the glass as well. Nose had some coffee tones, a bit of raisin, small amounts of chocolate were present also. Taste had some of the chocolate notes as well as a nutty character, starting off sweet and ending a bit sour and bitter. The beer did come full circle as far as meshing the flavors together. It was medium bodied, with a low alcohol content making it a very easy beer to drink. It would make a great session beer if you ask me. Another good job from Coopers, I'm never reluctant to pick up one of their beers from off the shelf"
"This beer is different and interesting, but I'm just not into it. I've had Cooper's Sparkling Ale which is awesome, and this was a bit of a let down."
"Drinkable by not my choice for a session. Suggest trying some better examples of this English Dark Ale style."
"The taste is pretty dry up front, and in fact throughout. There is a touch of caramel-like sweetness, but this beer remains light on the palate throughout. The finish is sharp with a bit of hop-bitterness and a lingering note of roasted coffee beans. The roasted coffee notes lightly dust the entire flavor of this brew. All in all each of the flavors in this brew are fairly light. This is not a brew that demands your attention, instead it is an easily quaffed brew. Nice and easy drinking, with just enough flavor to keep it interesting."
"Roasted malt is dominant here, with just a slight bitterness/astringency at the end that tells of hops. Decent mouthfeel makes this for an enjoyable experience. Overall, a good beer that doesn't wow me."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a mild malt scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It's dry and toastey. The taste is decent also. It has a thin crystal and roasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and earthy with some yeast aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a pretty good brew, but nothing I'd buy again. Coopers beers are run of the mill and nothing special, but they drink well."
"Overall - Not a very good beer. The initial smell may well put you off completely..."
"The taste is pretty yummy, I thought. Nutty, clean and crisp with nearly no aftertaste. Nearly no hops, either, which I was a bit sad about. Mouthfeel was thinner than my expectations given the dark color of the beer, but nevertheless had a nice, smooth mouthfeel. It was possible a little overcarbonated and a wee bit soda-like in my memory, but still not bad. Not one of Cooper's best beers, but you'd be streching it to say that it's a bad beer."
"D = Wouldn't try this again."
"Dark root beer colored. Paltry, even foam. Scented of coffee and chocolate, but only mildly. The bouquet is almost imperceptable, and this is at about 55 deg. F from a Riedel Chianti glass. Bone dry. Gassy. Savory cocoa flavors provide some bitterness. Low acid. Exceedingly neutral flavored. Actually this is kind of impressive. It would seem there was plenty of room for alcohol or off flavors to dominate, yet they can't be detected. Still, not a beer I will ever crave. Easy to finish; hard to remember. Hard to believe the same brewery makes Coopers Sparkling Ale, a beer so miraculaously alive with flavor."
"Because I couldnt taste any flavours early in the palate I wouldnt like to drink a large amount of this brew in a session."
"A very dark brown beer with deep mahogony highlights. A samll light brown head dissapears quickly. There is a rich malty aroma with a strong coffee character. There is a sparkling sweetness the tha start of the taste. Followed by a robust coffee character witha hint of bittersweet chocolate on the finish. A very tasty treat. Remindes me of a light Batic Porter"
"A good ale; one of my long-term favourites."
"Drinkability: Yeah, I could drink a few of these. Not too strong, not weak, just about right."
"Decent beer, but nothing very good either. Still, makes for good, easy sipping."
"Drinkability & Notes: A tasty brew, nothing earth shattering. IÂ’ll chalk this one as a great lunch time brew Â… I paired it with a press Boursin cheese and roasted beef on pumpernickel sandwich."
"i guess its tough to stand out when your objective is to make a standard dark ale, though i think that has been well accomplished. easily drinkable, and wouldnt be a bad choice for a session on a cool night."
"Taste is very light and fleeting. Dry, toasted malts, with some more malts, a little fruity--but not really. Almost no taste, really. Fizzy, sharpish carbonation is strangely refreshing and a little shocking."
"Overall: It seems that English style Milds are so misunderstood, or is that under appreciated? I donÂ’t know, but they are easy to sleight it seems. What I do know is that I found this very fresh sample to be extremely quaffable and quite tasty given its 4.5% ABV. I make no bones about the fact that I am a big fan of English Dark Milds, and I will admit that I actually quite enjoyed this Aussie example from Down Under. Not the best, but nowhere near as bad as others make out, though it needs to be fresh though me thinks."
"Well, it was a decent substitute for a Dunkel lager in my reduction sauce, but didn't quite have the same amount of sweet, caramelly flavors and you could taste the yeast even after some rough, extended boiling. On the drinking side, this was terrible. I guess Cooper's is proud of their yeast, but like the bottles of Sparkling and Vintage ales they make this Dark ale was dominated by its face-twisting carbonation and sharp cutting yeast."
"The beer escapes the bottle a beclouded deep mahogany to almost brown color, the head substantial, and the texture frothy, the color a toothsome light tan with the lace a solid sheet to encircle the glass. Nose is dominated by the sweet malt, hints of caramel, crisp and fresh with the start lightly sweet, the top light in its feel upon the palate. Finish is meek in acidity, the hops mild and pleasant, with the aftertaste dry, a drinkable but barely average beer."
"they could do this beer a whole lot better. still goes down quite nicely and certainly isnt offensive in any way. i just expect a lot more from these guys with a beer like this."
"A fairly simple brew, but very drinkable."
"OK, some guy beer-mailed me and abused me about my rating, look i don't really like the stuff that much and you can't force me too. This was deep brown in colour, quite oily, dry, but lacks a lot of character, also perhaps a bit sticky, i'm sorry, but i really can't see anyhting in this brew which appeals to me, but its not horrific at all, its quite drinkable."
