"O: I like it. Not a style I'm very familiar with, but it's nice to have a simple, unoffensive, sessionable beer every now and then, isn't it?"

"O- We need more of these beers Stateside. Lower alcohol, rich and malty...if it weren't for a drive home, I'd drink this all night. Time to find out if this is currently on the shelves...."

"This is an easy drinking mild ale, as it should be. Low in alcohol, clean and tasty. I would buy it again if I wanted something low in ABV but with plenty of flavor. Certainly better than most low ABV beers out there."

"Overall - Not bad. Being considered a mild ale I see why it is thin and some what watered down feeling. Flavor profile and taste are much along the lines of a stout which I like. Rather drink a more full beer but glad that I tried it."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 1/6/2014. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, biscuit, toast, brown bread, roast, light coffee, raisin, pear, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, toast, dark bread, roast, light coffee, biscuit, raisin, pear, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, dark bread, toast, biscuit, roast, light coffee, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with good robustness for the ABV and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth, bready, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present as expected of 3.9%. Overall this is a damn nice dark mild ale! All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; nicely robust and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, a pretty much phenomenal beer given the ABV. Another great one from Short's. If this were available all the time, this'd be my go-to session ale."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of a English Dark Mild Ale, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style with all that great drinkability that I always look for in the style. I like Motor City's Ghettoblaster a little more, but I still thought this was a nice beer. This beer had very good drinkability, it was really smooth, clean, slightly crisp, not filling at all and it had just enough flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a six pack of this stuff, it's very drinkable and I think it would be a pretty nice beer to pair with a meal. What I liked the most about beer was the drinkability, they fit a good amount of flavor in a small 3.9% beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that it was slightly watery, but I think that's to be expected from a 3.9% beer. I would buy this beer again, and I also would buy a six pack of it if they ever decided to release it on it's own. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or easy drinking sessionable beers in general. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid beer, there's was nothing crazy or unusual about this beer, It's just a solid English Dark Mild Ale and I'm glad Short's decided to include this in their new variety pack. Nice job guys, thinks for mixing it up with a style that just don't seem to be that popular in the age of hoppy and barrel aged beers, these milder beers still have a place in my hear and I'm glad Short's doesn't forget about them, keep up the great work."
