"Otherwise this is a fairly typical sweet malty and nutty brown ale."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a light, clear, brown coloring with only a thin, filmy, clingy white surface coating. Aromas of very sweet nut and toffee, with a slight roasting. Flavors are a bit watery, with a roasty, nutty sweet backbone and a touch of chocolate on the tail end. Sweet, light aftertaste with a slightly cloying finish."

"Overall not bad, decent malts, nice hop kick, a bit of the syrupy side and maybe some extract but drinkable and tasty."
"Cask conditioned, served at the Bangor location. Served at room temperature. The dense cloudines slowly rises into the head until it was clear. Light brown/heavy copper in color. Full lacing was left through the whole glass. A small aroma if toffee malts. The toasted malts appear again in the taste as well as some grains. Finished with a small hop character. Very creamy beer, has no carbonation. This reminded me of Kilkenny as I was consuming. A decent beer that may have been made slightly better from the cask."
"Overall an ok beer. It's not terrible but not great. Could've done a lot better with it especially in the recipe and in the mash. Fermentation was ok but it doesn't really need to show up in this style. Another miss by Sea Dog."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry roasted scent that boasts of pale and special roast malts. The taste is decent. It has a quaffable, dry roasted flavor. It's light and simplistic, but highly drinkable. There is a bit of esters in the finish, but not much in the way of caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average brown ale. There really isn't much else to say."
"This is a malty but slightly nutty brown. This beer has a malty and buttery aroma. The beer is amber with a thick head and good lacing. The taste starts sweet and becomes nutty with no bitterness. This is a smooth and good all around brown (sorry for the rhyming)."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this one on tap. It was very smooth. I could easily drink three or four. Good for a brown ale."
"D - A nice light beer with enough going on to keep me interested in another."
"Off the tap this beer was maple syrup color with good rising carbonation. The head was khaki-colored, one-finger and left good lacing. The aroma was subtle, toasted malt and general grains. The flavors were good, starting toasted and dry, then became semi-sweet and roasted. It was darker than it smells. Nicely balanced with a grainy finish. The body was medium/light, the carbonation medium, the mouthfeel average."
"A solid brown, not too sweet and and easy session brew. Check it out if you enjoy browns."
"This ale has a light brown/amber color with a light foamy head. The smell is a nice sweet nutty aroma. The first sip starts with a malty sweetness. Followed by a quick nutty flavor. All ending in a nice mild hoppy finish . All and all an easy drinking ( light ) brown ale."
"A nice brown with good drinkability, nice example of the style, just not one of my favorite styles."
"Dark reddish-brown, light tan head. It was really smooth and had a bizarre hint of coffe that stuck to the roof of the mouth. Like it was spiked with a porter. A bit dry on finish. A tad too thin IMO."
