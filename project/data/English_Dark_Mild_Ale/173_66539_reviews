"O: A good effort for a second runnings. Had surprisingly a good bit going on. Not sure how many I would want though."
"Dark brown with a dense, beige head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is grainy, toasty, mildly smoky and has a touch of licorice. Not much hop character is present. Complex but not particularly compelling. The palate has the complexity of the nose, but the lightness and wateriness thanks to this being a second runnings beer is a little distracting. The English yeast adds some nice fruitiness and a little bit of a body, but not quite enough. Light in body, medium-high in carbonation, drying, smoky on the finish, this is solid stuff."

"This wasn’t bad for a 2nd runnings beer but it could have ultimately used a little more flavors beside burnt roast and crisp bitter hops. I mean it drank OK but got fairly boring after a bit. It wasn’t bad though at cleansing the palate between tulips full of Fred from the Wood and Matt."
"D - Easy to pound, which is a great characteristic of this beer...haha. Nice to drink a couple of glasses and not feel guilty about drinking a 10% monster. Great for a session ale, give it a try!"
"This is a great and flavorful session beer."
