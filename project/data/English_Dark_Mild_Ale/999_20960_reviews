"like liquid and slightly watered down bread pudding this one is, caramel and toffee and butter and all of it come from the malts here, no attempts to be dry, with an english ale yeast character and a high degree of residual sugar. bittering hops balance it well though, so the beer is robustly flavored. its darker in color, pushing deep copper, with a tall white lasting head in a big mug at the pub next door to the brewery. it goes down pretty easy for how sweet it is, largely attributable i think to the light body, almost too light for the flavors in this beer, it needs a little more texture. carbonation is fine though, and the beer still comes across pretty rich. a nice hearty take on the style, one of the better and more complete beers i have had from these guys."

"A very nice dark amber ale with a smooth finish after the bread, caramel and slightly roasted dark malt flavors. Medium body and easy drinking. Good mouth feel, nice color and smell with the appropriate head for a 4 oz. sampler glass. Would be a nice session beer at 4.6% abv and 20 IBU."

"good drinkability, as it would make a good session beer, at a decent price."
"The beer list at the brewpub labels this as a Scottish Ale. It is decent, but not what I would expect for the style. Still, it is worth a try."
"Wow, what an amber. Fuller than most, it's got a lot of really great malt flavor to it. It's not overly sweet, there are some slight hops in there balancing it all out. My favorite part is the appearance, it's a bit dark than I would stereotype. Carbonation is good, and I like the drinkability. Not too shabby."
"D: alright, a little too subdued for the style"
"D: Excellent session beer, goes down easily, tasty and although I'm not sure what the ABV is, doesn't seem to be too high. Excellent amber."
"Into a pint glass, poured a really nice amber with golden hues, littel head from service and just a little lacing. Sweet malty aroma, nice but actually a bit faint. Tastes rich and malty as advertised, with a medium body, too lively at first, but carbonation leveled out later, smooth , and a nice complement to my pasta dish, but I wouldn't get too excited about it."
"Drinkability- Right in there with you average amber ale. Worth a try for sure."
"A clear, dark amber ale; no head or lacing. The smell is a light balance of malt & hops. Strong malty flavor blended quite nicely with the hops. A smooth, malty mouthfeel, slightly bitter. Overall, this reminded me strongly of what a lighter version of Fat Tire would taste like. A good session beer...I wish that a) I had tried more than 4 oz. of it and b) I lived closer to Billings, MT..."
"The menus logo for this beer displays a bear sitting in a hammock with growler on his belly. Fantastic! The beer is cola colored with a 1 mm head of foam. The beer seems both tart and sweet. I suspect ringwood yeast has been used. An apple favor is present as well as hints of tabacco. An interesting beer and overall quite drinkable."
