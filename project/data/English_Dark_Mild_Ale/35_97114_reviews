"Straight from the bottle at a friend’s party. Couldn’t assess appearance. Minimal insight into aroma. Toasted bread, caramel, late earthy flavor. Also, some fruit undertones. Active carbonation, medium-light body, creamy texture. I enjoyed this more than I expected to. Not overly interesting, but a fair sessionable brew."

"I really liked this one from Sam Adams. Smooth malty taste is well balanced, & I could definitely put back a few of these!"

"Overall - Pretty nice flavors for a mild ale, more like a red amber actually, I enjoy this beer. A pretty good reason to check out the sampler it comes in."

"I poured this beer and it has a reddish color body with a small tan head to it. The smell is a little sweet and has a malt aroma also. The taste has a little sweetness and malty notes and just a bit of hops on the end of the tongue. Mouthful is smooth and overall a good beer. I could see my self drinking this with some fish and chips in a pub."

"If they sold 12 packs of this beer, I would have it regularly in stock!"

"The mouth is slightly thick and clingy."

"I was very impressed with the color of beer, as advertised a red tinge mixed with a dark caramel color that has nice highlights. The smell is not overpowering of malt or hops, with a mouthfeel that is well...mild. I thought it would blow me away, but it was just good, plain good, which isn't bad. Anyway, I thought the mild taste of ale would be something appealing to me but it wasn't as much as I thought. It wasn't bad, mind you, it just didn't tingle my toes. Overall, it is an outstanding beer and one I have tried again and again."
""
""
"Overall - Per category, this is a pretty unobjectionable beer. Flavor is pleasant and light enough to enjoy all day."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, light brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of yeast. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, hops, slight pale malt, and a hint of yeast. Overall, a decent mild, with good blend, and appearance."
"O: This one doesn't get high marks on here, but then again, very few examples in this style class seemed to have made an impression on anyone. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I gave away the other one of these that came in the pack but had I kept it, I could have easily downed it in my sitting. The alcohol was only detectable at the end and of course, that faded quickly as well. There wasn't much to take from this but on its own, it was a good beer to have an a Fall day such as this. Between the darker fruit up front and the lighter finish to this, there's just enough to hold anyone's attention in this beer. Just don't expect anything more than ""mild"" from this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is an everyday beer for me."
""
"This is a pretty tasty offering. I think there are better Sams out there, but it's good. I think I'd have this again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it again."
""
""
"Nothing offensive, or to complain about but just mild in so many ways."

"DATE TASTED: September 21, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint glass... OCCASION: first a strong PSU win...APPEARANCE: beautiful chestnut-red body with a creamy white head; laces sporadically and slickly... AROMA: sweet,, slightly toasted oat malts with sot hops--the citrus is secondary to the doughy malts--ESB in its scent...PALATE: medium-bodied, rewardingly smooth and just substantial enough to have a presence...TASTE: malty, mild and unobtrusively sweet... OVERALL: a rather straight-laced, straight-forward, functionally sessionable beer--not one I'd seek out or miss, but one I would enjoy over a variety of mouth-rinsing macros..."
""
"Overall - Very well balanced, between malty sweet and English hops. A bit strong and sweet to be a British session ale. Overall quite good."
""
"Overall: This beverage lures you in with a fruity appeal, and it reveals its dark flavor when its too late. Despite the role reversal, the drink slips past the tongue quite easily without any offense."

"This is a decent beer, with a nice sweet flavor to it. would prefer a little more complexity. A good gateway beer to someone who prefers a macro-style lager. Nothing harsh or off-putting here at all. At the same time, nothing to get excited about either."
""
"Like most English mild ales, this Sam Adams release was highly drinkable but rather forgettable. If you dig the style, perhaps you should give it a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Just an average beer in my opinion. Nothing stands out, but no obvious flaws. I would drink again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one."
""
"Not bad, kinda bland and on the sweeter side, decent malty flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Overall - a nice mass produced beer? A nice English red ale, but not it's for me. I can pass. Let it warm is my advice."
""
"Summary - Not bad. I haven't tried much of this style, so I can't speak to accuracy. Would try again."
""
""
"Overall not a horrible beer but much better beers for less money out there. But if amber beers are your thing then give this one a try."
"This pours a clear, medium amber color with a slight beige head. The aroma is mild with malts and oak. The texture is a little thinner than I expected and the taste isn’t very bold either. This is very light in taste and texture that leaves you wanting more from the flavor. Not in any way bad, it just could use some more work before you see this as a year round 6pack as right now it is only available in a sampler 12pk."
""

""
""
"While it seemed originally out-of-place in this year's fall sampler pack, I can see how this beer can be easily enjoyed by many during this months of hearth and change. After second thought, I can now hope to see this included in their seasonal cases in years to come. All in all, not a bad beer."
"Overall this beer reminds me of the good old standby of Boston Lager. Well balanced, easy to drink and would be good all year. I will certainly buy again, and would recommend to some friends."
""
"Pretty average but inoffensive ale, mild and sessionable, nothing special but nothing really to complain about. Pretty much right down the middle, some bonus points for a nice appearance and body."
"Overall impression: A refreshing and flavorful malt-highlighted strong mild. Not sure why this hasn't garnered more BA love but I wish there were more examples of this style out there."
""
"The Ruby Mild seems like a more maltier version of the Boston Ale. The beer pours a clear nice amber with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is mostly English style hops balanced with malt....maybe a slight rye smell. The taste is very well balance between sweet malt and bitter hops. The mouthfeel is light to medium on body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good session beer!"
""
""
""
"Pours soft amber, light foam. Just dark enough to not be see through. Pale ale, nose. Quite english. Slight cherry fruit. Quite mild taste, fruity. Even keeled. Just a hint of an edge at the finish. Some funk but never out of check. New offering, but feels like ye olde beer. Fits in the mix pack for sure."
"Cheers!!"

"The Verdict: Very good. This new seasonal is like a richer and smoother version of SA’s signature lager. This may be my favorite from Boston Brewing."
""
"Overall – A rather malty and sweet brew that still maintains an easy drinking style. A rather enjoyable brew overall."

"Overall: A decent malt forward mild ale. Nice caramel malt taste."
"Typical Sam: True to style, not bad, and not very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-dark copper and a finger of off white head. Smells sweet and nutty. Taste follows with good caramel malt sweetness, toasted bread, and a light nuttiness. Light body and moderate carbonation. It's very easy drinking, but nothing really stands out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not a good version of a mild, IMHO."
"Overall, not a great brew and one of my least favorites out of the variety pack. Much better Sam Adams beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruby hued as advertised. Starts with a cherry pit aroma. Tastes a bit bittersweet with some caramel flavors mingling ith just a touch of coffee roastiness. Hard candy sweetness up front, then a touch of roasted malt bitterness and then it finishes sweet. Very drinkable despite the fact that is almost six percent alcohol."
"For a mild, this is quite pleasant but those expecting something else probably will be underwhelmed."
"O- This beer isn't bad, but it's just middle of the pack. Nothing really crazy going on here. Meh."
""
""
"Samuel Adams Ruby Mild ---3/5."
""
""
""
"The caramel tastes darker than the smell, almost treacle-like. Surprising hop bitterness. Decent body, low carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an unassuming beer, and it's one that I probably could drink for a while. Nothing that jumps out, but that's quite okay."
""
"Amber / copper color with decent head and mild carbonation. Slight malty and caramel aroma. Crisp malty taste and you can really taste the alcohol. Sort of lack luster. No real depth or an element that makes it memorable. The flavors it has aren't bad, they're just not enough."
""
"O) A decent brew."
""
"O: Even though this is a bit heavy for the style, it's still enjoyable and (as expected) easy to drink. Definitely for the malt-lovers out there, as there is almost no hop presence. If I wanted a real mild with 3-4% abv, this would be a bit of a reach. Otherwise, it's a solid beer"
""
"O: Retains a lot of character despite being light and refreshing. Perfect for rewarding yourself after raking leaves or some other fall yardwork."
""
"Overall: I have liked a lot of Sam Adams seasonal specialty beers, but I find this one to be ok, or just short of it. It hits a bunch of what the style should be like. Not bad enough to turn away, but not overly memorable either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- While I'm am not familiar with this style this beer was somewhat enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of caramelized malt, brown sugar, and tea like hops. Some bread and toasted edges as well. In the taste, toasted malt, brown sugar, toffee, with a small earthy, nicely bitter hop. A bit grainy, caramelized malt becoming more predominant as it warms. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation that retains decently. Overall, this is a mellow beer that is easy to drink. Not the best mild."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not too familiar with the English Dark Mild style, but I rather enjoyed this one. Easy drinker. Just enough complexity to keep my tongue interested. It wouldn't pain me to see this one in their future Autumn mix releases."
""
" The taste of this beer is good with more yeast flavor and malt than expected with a slight toasted and fruity combination of malt and yeast with very low bittterness as expected and gentle alcohol in the taste which adds to the subtle spice and fruitiness which has a mild currant taste with light herbal hop in the finish. Overall this is decent but there are much better examples of the style, this is just okay compared to the originators'"

"O - It's a decent mild. Nothing too fancy, but would go well with various foods and situations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think Sam Adams somewhat understands this beer style, but they can't finish. Taste wise there is no full bodied flavor, and the mouthfeel just ruins the beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the taste of this one. A weak look and aroma gave way to a surprisingly rich taste and a smooth mouth feel that more than made up for it. Would buy again. A worthy representation of the style."
""
"Overall, not a great job by Sam Adams. So much potential with this beer but they missed it. Oh well."
""
"O: A decent enough brew, light and mild in the aroma and palate, still an easy drinker. Not a style thats right up my alley, but nothing objectionable."
""
""
"O - Always looking to try new Sam Adams brews, so I was happy to see a new beer in the Harvest Sampler. Overall it isn't bad. Has a good flavor, the flavor is just a little watery. Reminds me of a weaker SA Irish Red. Certainly won't mind drinking the other Ruby Mild I have, but I probably won't buy it on it's own."
"O: This is a pretty good beer, well balanced, flavorful, not too expensive, I could drink quite a few of these with out getting sick of them. I'd recommend."
""
""
"Overall: good beer and a nice addition to have. Is it the best thing Sam Adams ever made; probably not but you should grab just to have it. Grab a glass and enjoy...Salud!"
""
"Sam Adams is very consistent with the quality and excellence their crafts people's creation.. Another Fall Delight!!!"
""
""
"Clear, deep copper under a thick, frothy head. Smells bready with some caramel, molasses, nuts, and sweet dried fruits. Toasted malts, dark fruity esters, nuts, and a hint of chocolate in the finish. Fairly sweet and somewhat spiced tasting. Not too bad...a little sticky and fruity. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Just the one bottle is good enough for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer over their Irish red or any other amber ale/lager style that SA has. It is still rather a boring style but a good change of pace beer for a hoppy or sweet/sour session."
""
"Similar is some ways to the Boston Lager, but richer. A nice beer. Balance, drinkable while remaining rather full-bodied."
""
""
"This beer is a great addition to their Fall seasonal 12 pack. I'm enjoying it."
""
"It's interesting in the mixed 12 packs for fall, but I wouldn't buy a sixer of it."
"Still, well worth your time."
"O: It's not that far off from their Irish Red in terms of the flavor profile, except in one facet...it's quite drinkable - unlike the former, which is low on flavor AND hard to drink. This could use a few tweaks, but isn't bad overall."
""
""
"O - just a nice plain session ale. Nothing more, nothing less. I would actually like try this on cask!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First time I tried this beer is in Sam's harvest variety pack. This is an extremely good drinkable beer. It's perfect for someone who is into a lighter body beer, but wants a malt flavor. I'm not to into hoppy IPA's like everyone else, so I look for good solid beers without bitter qualities."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice head, foamy blanket, and some light lacing. Nose is a healthy combination of roasted grains and light sweet components. Roasty, peaty, with some spice and sweet hints. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
"Overall: It's not too exciting. I can see how mild ales can have a place, but at 5.6% ABV this doesn't work too well. It comes as part of the twelve pack of October beers, and I don't think most people are going to be as eager to try this one. There are better session beers out there, and Sam Adams I know can do better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice change of pace from Sam Adams with this Mild. Pours a gorgeous dark amber/red with off-white head - very enticing to look at this ale. Nose is on the lighter side with some toasty/biscuit notes and a caramel quality. On the palate I'm getting a nice malty to biscuit sweetness with some balancing hops, very easy drinking & thirst quenching, and very subdued alcohol for such a high % for a mild. Looking forward to cheese pairings with this one."
"Gotta love it when you see an American brewery come out with a mild and it weighs in at over 5%... Regardless, this stuff pours a clear rusty bronze topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet flowers, light walnut, and a twinge of lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more biscuit (now buttery for your Southern pleasure) and a twang of vague sweetness for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish that epitomizes how the flavors completely fall off of a cliff near the end. Overall, this was a pretty disappointing brew. It's weak, it's overcarbed, it's slightly muddled, and it's in no way ""mild"". Let's just say: I'm not impressed."
""
"Appearance has that ruby color to it supporting a thin head leaving nill lace. Smell is mild with the caramel malt and light hop. Taste is slightly harsh, not real balanced leaving a salinic bitter in the end. Mouthfeel is medium light with good carbonation. Probably one I won't try again."
"I am rating this highly, because it is a smoother, well balanced, very drinkable version of their red. I like their Irish red, and I would pay 25-50% per six more to have this available year round in place of that. Every facet is slightly better tasting and smoother than that already good beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, not great. Sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Reminiscent of their Irish Red Ale, at least for me."
"There seems to be a fight in this beer between the crisp easiness and the taste as the carbonation makes it feel silky but washes away some of the flavor. I'm very impressed otherwise as its quite diverse and quite flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is a good beer to have when you want something refreshing. The fact that it's not heavy and is incredibly smooth make it a great session beer. I would probably rate this as an above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown, with red hues and a small white cap, this brew is very drinkable. The aoma is earthy and malty. Great, full malt flavor, but balanced and very drinkable. It is the kind of beer that you could enjoy in quantity on tap. The mouthfeel is relatively full...satisfying. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"Ok my fave time of year is when fall seasonals start coming. Looks like Sam adams is kick starting it this year with their fall mixer which was purchased July 24 in my neck of woods. First up is ruby mild. Never had a mild so can't judge off of style. Good solid beer. No head retention. Solid malt backbone with little to no hops. Reminds me of bells amber without the subtle hops. Maybe that us how the style is intended. Good overall beer."
"A smooth ""reddish"" ale that poored crisp. Not too much head (if any?), was supringly tasty. The beer tasted like a dummed down traditional red ale which I expected with the name ""mild"". Came in an autmn sampler pack which was suprisingly worth it. Would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of traditional ale or Red."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer. Stronger in alcohol and malt that the traditional English version but still tasty."
