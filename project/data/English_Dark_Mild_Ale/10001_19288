Roasted malts and coffee dominate, blending with some sweetened chocolate, caramel, plums, figs and raw earth. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth and crisp, with a medium body. Definitely a good beer.

Taste is medium bodied and very enjoyable; roasted malts, mild chocolate, a touch of sweet grain, caramel and the hops are even noted, playing a well founded evening role.

4.13,14.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes British or Irish style beers. Somewhat like Guiness, but since Guiness isn't for everyone, this goes down easily without a strong taste.","CrazyMike","0"
4.03,11.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is very dry and pleasant -- my favourite aspect of this beer. Hockley Valley Dark is pleasantly bitter, and goes great with salty food (I had mine with fried ham and home fries -- yum!)","crwills","Sep 25, 2005"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a clear dark color ale with nice foamy dark brown head with good retention. Aroma of English malt with floral undertone is easily distinguishable. Taste is very refreshing wit a good roasted malt presence and a bitter finish with a good balance of what seems like English hops. Body is a bit thin but overall this is a very enjoyable drink.","Phyl21ca","Aug 15, 2005"
3.92,8.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall this is a good Brown Ale worth trying. Its got lots of flavor but could use a little more body.","CAMRAhardliner","Aug 15, 2005"
3.57,-1.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a super dark brown. Medium tan head. No carbonation. The nose was decent, some nice roasted malts, a pinch of coffee and cocoa. Taste was mild up front. The roasted malts seemed to peak through nicely mid-sip and lingered quite well, although subtle. Again, i found some traces of cocoa towards the finish. Mouthfeel light and smooth. A pleasant warmth to the beer. I found that the flavours of this beer seemed more pronounced long after a sip had been swallowed. It grew on me as i progressed through the glass. Nice drinkability. Smooth, light bodied but warm with a decent malt backbone.","Popsinc","Oct 31, 2004"

3.26,-9.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Just picked this one up at the LCBO, quite an attractive bottle. Poured out of 1L growler, beer was a rich dark reddish brown, with lots of whitish head. I have a cold so it didn't really smell like much, as little hoppy and metallic though. The taste was a little too light as well, but a bitter nutty flavour and a little chocolate were present. However the taste did get better with every sip. The mouthfeel was too light for me, seemed watered down. Altogether an average beer, I thought it has high drinkability but is pretty pricey to buy on a regular basis. Worth a try though, I thought it was pretty decent.","Viggo","Aug 17, 2004"
3.38,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"A decent microbrew, somewhat of an experiment to juice up an ordinary dark beer that works. Carbonation was cheap and on less pleasant and less drinkable side, bit novice beer drinkers I shared this large minimum magnum with went with the cocoa and carmel sweetness. Long aftertaste.","Sammy","Aug 15, 2004"
