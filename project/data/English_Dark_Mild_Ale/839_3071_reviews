"Very watery nutty smoke and earth"
"Overall: this is definitely one of my favourite 'every day' dark beers, along with Carlton Black. They are both an Australian take on the traditional English styles - similar characteristics, but with a lighter body and higher carbonation to make them easier to drink in a session, and more refreshing in the Australian heat. I really would consider them more an excellent version of a dark lager than an English Dark Mild. Decent price too at AU$45 a case of 24 x 375mL. One of my favourite pub beers is a Tooheys Old / Tooheys New black-and-tan. I will say I do prefer Old on tap rather than in the bottle, but good nonetheless."

"Not a bad brew, but kind of thin, and somewhat underwhelming, even for this generally anemic style. There's enough flavour to make a go of it, if moderation and sessionability are your goals for the night, but for a singular experience, this just doesn't have the legs."

"O: Surprisingly good beer that goes down easy. This is a quality beer from a brewery I did not expect much from. Worth checking out."

"O - Very light and mild so easy to drink. The character it has sets it above most Australian macros but still a very average beer."

"for the mass produced beers of the land down under, this one gets it done. roasty and drinkable, this is the pick of the lot in most sydney pubs. for me, this one is more nostalgic than high quality. this was my go to drink for some of the best years of my life, so i'll always have a special place for it, despite how average it is on the grand scale. a slab of these will cost ya about 40 australian bones, and carrying it home 6 blocks from the bottle-o is great for the biceps. its got a faint alcohol taste, with plenty of dark malts and a little bit of gentleman's class to it. mediocre brew in the land of lousy brews."
"Food match: Something heavy to counter the dreaded stomach bloat mentioned above. I think a roast dinner would match well with this, preferably roast beef with a heavy gravy and a side of roast potatoes and carrots."
"Dark brown but does lighten noticably at the rim. Good nose for a megalarger; sweet toasty malt, good lift. Doesnâ€™t quite translate into the palate, traces of the malt evident early but falls into a more mainstream palate with some fizz and some weak malts to finish."
"I am now used to a wonderful roast sweet malt aroma, and easy drinkability."
"Quite impressed with this to be honest."
"Drinkability: I found this one reasonably drinkable and I'd be willing to have a second one but I'd not seek it out if there were alternatives. But on the other hand I'd certainly could have a second and would if I'd bought two of them."
"the best on offer for mass produced dark beers in Australia, but seriously ther's a lot better. 3.0"
" M- This beer has a light watery texture and no alcohol heat. D- This beer has some nice schwartzbier qualities but the flavors are really muted and not much depth"
"I like this beer better than some of the modern boutique beers becaiuse they try too hard with assertive flavours-this one is effortless, real, traditional and also won't stonker you with too much alcohol.A bit of a genuine find."
"It's sad to know that one of the best macro brewed beers in Australia barely achieves a score of 3. Toohey's Old is not a great beer, but it is something I have turned to at pubs that give only macro offerings. Inoffensive and drinkable, but there are so many, much better micro brewed alternatives."
" second tooheys product that I try, and the taste is good. easy to drink as well. Another decent brew from Tooheys. I like the big size bottle as well. Mouth feel is creamy a bit, not too much, smells good. overall good beer."
"I'm really taken back at how good this is for the style, it follows it well and is a solid brew. The other Australia beers my buddy brought back for me were pretty terrible. This however is a solid english dark. Exceptionally sessionable at its current abv. Somthing I would definatly order at a pub."
"Not real interesting, but very drinkable. If you live in NSW, someone's bound to leave some at your house eventually. Go for it."
"This was the first ever dark beer I ever tasted 20 odd years ago and I hated it but thankfully my tastes have improved since. A good old stand-by."
"Drinkability is not a problem, I have tasted dark ales that tasted a little heavy with artificial syrupy mouthfeel...I reckon the watery feel works in this ale's favour..."
"Overall - A good alternative to Tooheys usual low quality lagers."
"A solid, very flavourful beer. I got introduced to this brew at Bondi Icebergs in Sydney NSW. I was quite impressed. It poured into the glass with a lovely mahogany dark color and the head was thick for a beer on CO2. The nose had hints of coffee and dark chocolate which translated nicely to the taste where I found more dark chocolate notes. The flavour is very nicely balanced. Sweet enough for me while still a bit bitter on the finish to balance it off. A great session brew. Actually, my BA avatar is a photo of this beer at Bondi Icebergs. I highly recomend the pub and the beer. As you can see the view is quite nice. Cheers mates."
"Inoffensive, of course, and quite drinkable, but certainly nothing to streak naked around a bar over. Unless that's your thing."
"Overall, enjoyable and one of the cheaper beers by Aussie standards."
"Drinkability: I prefer most ales to American lagers. To me this is a great session beer. If it weren't for my schedule, I'd still be sitting in a pub in OZ drinking Tooheys OLD."
"but without a sharp taste instead of being a bit bland, I lost interest in the beer pretty quick and downed it fast."
"D - Tasty sessionable beer. There are others I'd go to first but I wouldn't knock this one back. One of the best macro brews I've had."
"Drinkability: ok-average"
"d: relatively smooth beer to drink, but doesn't have much flavor to it"
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink, good session beer and beats alot of the macro crap you can get on tap. This stuff is almost everywhere."
"Overall, I rate this beer highly. I have fond memories while partaking of this beer."
"Not much bitterness or hop flavour."
"It would probably be better left out of the fridge for a little while and would be a great winter beer, Perhaps a pint or 2 before a game of football ?"
"D = Ok. Wouldn't be one I go for again."
"Drinkability: 2.5"
"Nice black but still see- through color with slightly off white head. Slight smell of roated malts and tiny spiciness. Tastes nice; mild roast flavors and slight sweet carmel touch, without being the slightest bit ""in your face."" Is a bit on the thin side, and personally, I like my roast malts a little more standoffish. However, the light touch with the roast malts and smooth mouthfeel make it easy to drop a few back."
"Pours very black with a stringy off white head which doesn't last. Tastes strangely similar to New but with a much more satisfying maltiness and a slight chocolatey nuttiness to it. Quite sweet and smooth. Like most ales in Australia probably not actually an ale, feels quite lagery and often very carbonated."
"This beer poured a nice dark brown with very little head, and had very little in the way of aroma. Very faint smell of roast malt. It tastes slightly malty, slightly chocolatey and slightly hoppy, but not too strong of anything. It does have flavor, it's just fairly well balanced. Has a pretty clean finish for a dark beer. Very drinkable."
"Since the alcohol % taxing debacle in Australia, Tooheys have reduced the percentages of most of their beers. This includes changing the recipe. For Old, it was a big mistake. It used to be a refreshing porter at 4.5% and is now a strange soapy dishwater ale at 4.3% or something like that. I don't know if it was ever 4.8% but I don't have one of the old ones here to compare with - I think it was always 4.5%. Anyway, they changed the label, as Carlton did with VB, and as other beers have too. My advice - if you can buy any of the old ones with the black label, get them while they're still good (they keep for a long time in the fridge) but really avoid the red label, newer ones (practically everywhere now). They are very soapy. This review is in fact for the on-tap kind - I had one on tap at the NSW Leagues club near Hyde Park Barracks a few weeks ago, and since a nice cold Old is what I really felt like, I was so disappointed when I got the nasty-smelling and -tasting crap that they have produced for some months now. I will never have another Old until they change the recipe, or unless I'm really stinging for one and I'm out in the bush somewhere where someone has bought a case and there's nothing else to drink for miles. Other than that, NEVER. I'm disappointed - it used to be my favourite session beer (and indeed one of the only regularly available session porters in NSW). Too bad."
"makes a nice cold weather session beer. great tasting and not too high on the abv."
"Really the best Australian beer around. Pours jet black with a nice fluffy head. Great aroma of chocolate and some spices. This however, is not a stout. Its more of a black ale, similar to a belgian black ale or a german schwarzbier. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but nothing bad. Flavor is rich and inviting, with a nice hop bite after the chocolate. Australia had a lot of crappy brews and most of Toohey's offerings were in that group. This one, however is not."
"as with monteiths black, its a dark beer you can have a session on. and for a brewer that is known for brewing particularly dismal beers (even compared to carlton) its a real standout. at least tooheys have shown with this beer, and by subsidising the james squire brewery, that they have some slight interest in brewing a quality beer. they get points for that alone. but hey, this is one of the beer hunters favorite aussie beers. its hard to argue with that assessment. i certainly dont."
"As far as drinkability, it was pretty tasty and was my favorite brew while I was down there. I know what I'll be looking for the next time I'm around Brisbane."
"I liked this one!"
"It kinda tastes like a bad Black and Tan, but it's not all that bad."
"Very drinakble, especially on tap, don't know that its a stout though, more like porter or English style Old ale, nice light smokiness, hints of leather, coffee, chocolate and smooth mouthfeel, good session beer."
