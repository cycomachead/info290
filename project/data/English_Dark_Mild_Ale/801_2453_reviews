"Thanks to Billy for this one!"

"Overall a decent quaffable ale."

"Hmmmm, not bad. A pleasing blend of flavours makes this quite drinkable, although it doesn't stand out. Body could be a bit thicker/creamier. A decent dark ale for winter drinking."
"Easy to drink and on the sweetish side of British beer scene, this isn't a dry, bitter beer at all, just a very pleasant ale."

"It was a prefect brew after a long winter day trip in the Welsh countryside."
"Dr: Drinkable enough, average ABV, great price, and decent quality. Try it, but don't expect much. It would be better if it were on-draught."
"O: Very drinkable session ale that my father brought back for me on his trip to the UK. Reminds me of a schwarzbier."
"Note: Label shows 4.1% ABV"
"Body is too thin."
"D: I'd like to try this on cask if it's available. The burnt taste makes it much less drinkable."
"Not much aroma apart from some malt which was nice. Flavour was a bit flat. Not as complex as others but toasty to the point of burnt with little malt to push through this. No sweetness at all and a bit steely as well. I guess this really needs to be off the cask rather than bottled."
"A lovely ale to look at, with a smooth, structured, seemingly everlasting ivory-hazelnut head atop a nearly opaque black body. Soft and mild in the nose, with timid notes of nougat, caramel, and peanuts, plus a faint berry-like fruitiness. The flavor is more upfront, deliciously nutty, full of peanuts and almonds, buckwheat tea, and seedy bread. There is a steely mineral quality in the finish that amplifies the dryness of the beer. Grassy, hay-like hops appear in the beginning, then disappear beneath the malts to resurface as a slight leafy bitterness in the finish. The beer is rollingly soft yet light on the palate, befitting the flavor. In the end it is not that complex or robust, but still an easy quaffer."
"This is exactly what I hoped a Mild would be!"
"I would so love to try this on cask, but for now, mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is also okay. I would love to have this as a session ale, given the ABV, but it's a bit sour, and that might undercut its viability as a session beer."
"Drinkability: this beer's body is thin to medium to my taste, and the aftertaste is not long enough, either. But in a way the dryish body is a strong point to make it a different mild from other sweeter and more watery versions. I truly enjoy this beer as the first pint after a day's hard work, and I suppose that's exactly the kind of joy and sense of relief this classic beer brought the Welsh miners of old as well~~"
"Other comments: Another nice ""real ale in a bottle"". After drinking a lot of pasteurized bottled English ales (I was a Morrison's shopper), it's been a real treat to try these CAMRA-sanctioned bottled ales available at Sainsbury's."
"An awesome Welsh cask beer, on cask in where else but Cardiff? Dark black with crimson edges. The aromas are all chocolate and roasted malts, with some floral hops in the background. The taste is all chocolate, roasty notes, and coffee. The hops are almost MIA, but they are there in the back, cowering. Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth and the drinkability is very good as well. An awesome dark mild, by a very underated Welsh brewery churning out some fine (and affordable) premium cask ales for all the citizens of Wales."
"A really nice mild, with such a low abv it has alot of flavour"
