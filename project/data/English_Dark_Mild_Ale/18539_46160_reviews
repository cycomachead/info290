"O: Overall a decent session dark beer.  The finish is a touch on the watery side, but the overall flavor is certainly interesting."

"This beer was not bad but it was far from outstanding.  Devils Backbone Brewing has better offerings."

"Overall its classic Devils Backbone flavorful, but the carbonation on this is just way too much. If this was dialed down to let that the light toasty malt backbone to come through it would be really fantastic."

"Good? Bloody hell it was marvelous! I am sure I could wax lyrical about toffee and cocoa notes and the merest hint of spicy hops, but why, when it was the sheer pleasure the beer bought me which is the abiding memory?"
"D - Cream of Fergus is an easy-to-quaff, English-style session ale... 'nuff said!"
"D: A very good brown ale that is approachable with moderate hoppiness and with a tocuh of peaty smokiness that lends a great deal of uniqueness. Also notable for a great deal for a growler fill."
"Drinkability: Kudos to an American brewer trying to a style that's far too often overlooked in favor of bigger, bolder offerings. This one's simply a solid, malty, low abv% Scottish ale, pleasant and easygoing. Recommended."
