3.83,6.4,4.25,4.25,4,3,3.25,"Overall its classic Devils Backbone flavorful, but the carbonation on this is just way too much. If this was dialed down to let that the light toasty malt backbone to come through it would be really fantastic.","smakawhat","0"

3.72,3.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A very good brown ale that is approachable with moderate hoppiness and with a tocuh of peaty smokiness that lends a great deal of uniqueness. Also notable for a great deal for a growler fill.","argock","Beers"
3.7,2.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Kudos to an American brewer trying to a style that's far too often overlooked in favor of bigger, bolder offerings. This one's simply a solid, malty, low abv% Scottish ale, pleasant and easygoing. Recommended.","CrellMoset","0"
