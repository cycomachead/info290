2.58,-30.5,2,4,2,2,2.5,"Overall: I will admit this was my first beer from the brewery and my first English Dark Mild as well. I wasn't sure what to expect so I can't knock the beer for that. The aroma was the highlight for me, if it was replicated in the taste I would love this beer. I look forward to trying more from Eagle Rock, gotta support the LA area breweries!","MaltAndHopsFC","Nov 26, 2012"

3.13,-15.6,3.5,3,3,4,3,"I'm trying all of these low alcohol beers, which seem to be a nice experimental trend-- the search for great flavorful beers when you don't have time to sleep it off. Eagle Rock is doing a good job with the less powerful beers, but this is not one of my favorites. On tap at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach.","mactrail","Oct 12, 2012"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours an inky black with trace tan head swirling around the glass circumference. The nose has subtle notes of roasted coffee beans, grains, and bitter cocoa. Hops don't enter the picture until I take my first sip, which resembles a mild porter with a grainy, roasty, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is definitely a malt forward, mild-medium bodied beer that opens up more as the beer trends towards room temperature. Tasty, drinkable, fairly priced, but unfortunately has difficult availability... I'd drink this beer again, but would let it warm up more before pouring.","ThePorterSorter","Sep 08, 2012"

4.48,20.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I really like this beer. I haven't tried any other English Dark Mild Ales, so there aren't any comparisons to make, but this beer has really grown on me. It pours a dark brown and has a small amount of head retention, with decent lacing as the beer is consumed. You are greeted with a nice roasted smell with notes of coffee, and a bit of chocolate. The taste is roasted malts with a coffee background. It tends to go away quickly, not a lot of aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pleasantly light, with soft carbonation. Some have described it as having a watered-down taste/feel, which is what I thought the first couple times I had it. However, since then, I really have noticed and begun to appreciate the malt flavors. If you weren't impressed with it the first time, I say give it another chance.","beerblanket","Nov 16, 2011"

3.75,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy dark brown with a solid 1/2 inch creamy tan head that lasts. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and some nutty aromas. Taste is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, and some minor coffee flavors. A mild roasty bitterness after each sip along with a slightly sour quality on the tongue. This beer has a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel from the nitro tap. Overall, this is a pretty good mild but the sour aspect got to bit too much towards the end of the pint.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 24, 2011"
3.93,5.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"O: Really we need to see this style on cask, and we need to see more of it. A solid example of this rare (at least in the US) style.","Halcyondays","Sep 22, 2011"

3.99,7.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"D/O: This beer offers some attractive features in a truly sessionable package. The smell is quite assertive and appetizing, like something that should accompany breakfast. The nitro propulsion smooths out the front end taste and feel, successfully re-tooling the acidity issues this beer has on draft. While underwhelming, the flavors remain just interesting enough to keep coming back for--and they never threaten to tax the palate, which is amenable to the sub-4% abv. In some respects it would be difficult to pick this out of a line-up of dry Irish stouts, although anyone with a decent sense of smell could probably figure it out.","beagle75","Jan 08, 2011"
3.85,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Because this is such a low ABV beer this could be drunk for hour and hours, it's a great session beer. I'd go back for more of this.","MrTopher","Dec 04, 2010"

4.3,15.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I really enjoy this beer. It was served to me at Tony's Darts Away in Burbank and was poured perfectly. Very dark in appearance with a thick, tan, creamy head. Chocolate and coffee smell but not a strong taste of it. Sweet and very mild going down. No bitterness at all. I could easily drink a few of these.","bellafromsocal","Apr 21, 2010"

4.07,9.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Had this on tap at the brewery. Poured a dark black color into pint glass. Light roasty smell. The taste of a roasted porter. Light in taste. Nice mouthfeel, not strong. Good drinkability, light enough to drink all night. This was the third beer I had after drinking Red Velvet and Revolution. This was very good as I wasn't expecting the roastiness of the flavor. Light enough to drink but with a very good taste.","Westsidebuddha","Dec 17, 2009"
