3.85,14.9,4.25,3,4,4.25,4.25,"Is it not well known that the Guinness family (of English origin) fought against the repeal of the Act of Union, and thus against Irish independence from England? That Arthur's eldest son was a member of the orange order! That they were not exactly kind to the Irish Catholics that made up the majority of their work force? In fact, during the 1930's Guinness employed over 12,000 men at St. James Gate (close to 10 percent of the entire male population of Dublin), and it wasn't until the 1960's that a Catholic worker was allowed to enter management. Things may have changed, but to note Arthur's ""commitment to the welfare of his employees & the community"" certainly raises some questions in my mind. On the other hand, being an open-minded person who looks at all aspects of a situation I do have to acknowledge that at least until the 1960's, political and religious hierarchies existed throughout Ireland, England, and the rest of Europe (lest we not forget Nazi Germany).","NeroFiddled","Jan 15, 2013"

This stuff pours a clear smoky topaz topped by over a finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises dark greens, light old maple syrup, sweet barley, and biscuit. Things are even more bland than English milds' reputations occasionally demand. The taste is a mess of soapy, grassy, lightly-caramel-y biscuit. Harumph. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a limp offering, one that certainly doesn't deserve a 12-pack feature debut (though imagining this stuff in its own sixer is even more offensive, so, yeah...).

It pours a bright, vibrant, amber-copper coloring with a thin, clingy, filmy white ring around the surface. Aromas of old world fruit, both subtle and darkly sweet, with a touch of spicing. Flavors are roasted initially, with a significant drop off of body and flavors after the forward profiles. Touches of toffee and caramel blend in the backbone, with a touch of tang throughout. The roasty qualities survive throughout, and well into the aftertaste, which intertwines with a tangy sweetness for a decent balance that is missing on the main part of the palate. The beer is light and smooth, made for a day of quaffing. Sweet linger on the finish, with a slight cloying feel as the last of the flavor leaves your tastebuds. Interesting brew, and not a bad addition to the stateside lineup for Guinness.","GarthDanielson","Nov 21, 2012"
