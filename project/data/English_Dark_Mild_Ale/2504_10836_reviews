"I'll definitely return for another."
"My expectations were met with a good drinkable brew."
"This beer lives up to its name quite nicely. Lovely dark appearance under a small light tan head. Smell is mild malt and mild hops, and the taste follows the smell precisely: fine, light chocolate maltiness and a decent bread-dough flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and round, and is the best feature of this made-for-a-session beer. Very drinkable."
"D - This should be more available as a style. Session worthy, flavorful and intense in the way that rest notes accentuate the solos in jazz. I have loved this style for a while and NABC has this one nailed. It makes me want to brew a mild even more when I taste one as well mades as this. It has custard smoothness and truffle like depth that lingers - just top notch."
"great on draft if you're planning on having a few, pretty low alcohol, great body with good flavor"
"Another pleasure to drink. Reminescent of a German Schwatzbier. The bready and yeasty flavors and aromas that I expected, along with moderate barley malt sweetness. Throw in a mild black malt flavor without any graininess. Light molassas and walnut flavors and perhaps a hint of chocolate. The texture is light and airy to the mouth and leaves a light black malt bitterness. Never chalky or charcoal-like. But, with other Albanian brews, the carbonation is very low and has a disapointing foamstand and lacing. Otherwise, a joy."
"Taste: smooooth, light on the palate, very easy, yet full of character, if not too full of body...loads of malt, lots of taste, much more full of taste than I'd expect from an English mild...I like it, it's good... a much ballsier mild than I'd been anticipating...very worthy. Very good...nice...Hooray, New Albany, and all the New Albanians!"
"Special thanks to Mike to buying a keg for Rich O's patrons and then giving it away for free!!!"
"Muddy brown color with a thin, but creamy head. Chocolate, espresso, almonds and a subtle hop presence in the nose. Taste is more of the same, with a consitent undercurrent of chocolate and coffee flavors. This beer goes one step further, however, opening up with some nutty malt, toffee, and moderate hop flavor. Delicious, really. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and only moderately carbonated. Drinkability is outstanding as this ale abounds with delicious flavor and low alcohol. It's hard to drink just a pint of this stuff."
"Another.... please!"
