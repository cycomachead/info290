"A nice malty, sweet, low ABV ale."

"Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. Ghettoblaster is a passable English-style dark ale, but I'll add an asterisk to that because I have a feeling this bottle is getting a little old. This is the sort of beer that both craft beer fans and those who have never tried anything fancier than Guinness Draught should be able to enjoy, or at least tolerate. I will need to try this on tap some time to see if that adjusts my perspective at all, but for now I'd say this one is worth a look."

"Overall: Don't bother with this until it's almost room temperature.  nice, but I have had other English Ales I would buy first."

"Overall not bad, I received it for free and have seen it on shelves recently and have been wanting to try it for some time. After tasting it now I would recommend trying it once, I would not buy this though after this review. Something about that flavor on the end of the taste just is not to my liking, It reminds me of drinking Malt Licky sort of ?"

"O - Overall, I was floored by this beer. I was expecting a drain pour due to the rAvg but yeah, this is a VERY good representation of what this style SHOULD be. Well done."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottles on 9/11/2013. Gusher upon opening, very high carbonation. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of toast, brown bread, light caramel, golden raisin, pear, apple, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of toast, brown bread, light caramel, golden raisin, pear, apple, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, plum, pear, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. I let the carbonation dissipate in the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice mild ale. Well balanced bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"o: this beer is a fantastic example of what an english mild should be. i think most of the low marks come from people expecting an american amber style. this beer nails the mild style, if anything might be a little too big. if you are expecting an american amber or an esb style beer then you will be highly disappointed. this historic style is what helped keep man alive when you couldn't drink the water. it brings a huge smile to my face when i see breweries give homage to such styles instead of trying to pack another 100 ibu's into the next hop bomb. well done!"

"Overall, the best thing about this beverage is its ease of drinkability, in line with its stylistic guidelines. It is certainly not the most exciting beer when it comes to flavor or aroma, as it has that dirty, dog food type of bite. Regardless, there is enough flavor and presentation to present the drinker with at least a unique style of beer. It goes down without complaint, and is nice for someone looking for an “in between” sipper that isn’t too dark, but isn’t too light. As always we’re excited to try a local brewery for the first time, and again, are super happy that this is a bizarre, underrepresented style. This won’t become a fridge favorite for us, but we will certainly look for other beers of this producer to see what they’ve got to round out their arsenal."

"The feel is also flat. There's a barely-medium body, but both smoothness and crispness are fairly weak. It's not that there isn't crispness, but it's barely holding on the whole way through. This is where either something's wrong or the brewer determined that lighter body meant thin and watery. It's not dead, but it's dying."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example and a pretty true to style example of an English Dark Mild Ale, I don't have a ton of experience with this style, but this beer tastes pretty much just how I remember a good English Dark Mild Ale tasting and I think Motor City Brewing did a good job at representing the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, not filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I could see myself drinking more than a few of these, I think it's pretty sessionable and I think this would make for a good beer to pair a meal with. What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it is, it's just a good example of the style and it's just what I look for in an English Dark Mild Ale and I don't see many of those. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there nothing that I dislike or would change, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy this beer again and I'll try and I remember to pick up a six pack next time I go on a beer run. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, I think it's really accessible. All in all I was little impressed with this beer, I was a little let down with their Lager but this beer turned out to be pretty good and I'm starting to think that the English Ales are what this brewery specializes in. I think this beer is on the same level as their Nut Brown Ale. Good job guys, I enjoyed this one, keep up the good work."
"Overall: to me this style is supposed to be a light beer that is relatively packed with taste. this one isn't nearly as flavorful as the style allows, the flavor isn't too bad just way to weak. In a blind tasting of 4 dark mild (ghettoblaster, new castle cabbie, short's earl or brixom and a homebrew, it placed last.)"

"Overall: This beer doesn't seem to be a great example of this style, but it's OK. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this beer, but I'd have another under the right circumstances."
""
"Ghettoblaster turns up the volume on a style that is typically anything but loud. Not surprising given it's made in Detroit Rock City. While I suspect some of this added personality comes accidentally by way of an overactive yeast, I found it an enjoyable lower-strength offering nonetheless. I'll look to try more from Motor City Brewing Works."

"A nice product from Motor City Brewing, Ghettoblaster makes for a very nice session beer when you plan on drinking a bit."
""
"This is so-so. The head was absolutely ridiculous at first. I ended up spooning it out as it would have been like waiting for cupcake frosting to dissipate. Mild tone on the flavor with citrus and a lot of malts are clearly there. Mild? Certainly. Also, a mild example of the style."

"On draft at the Michigan Brewers' Guild in Ypsi. This pours amber into my little plastic cup. Does not smell like much, maybe a slight malt in the nose--this is certainly mild. Where is the flavor?? I know this is a ""mild ale", but there's just nothing here. Tastes like watered down pilsner malts, really no hop influence, and little to no sweetness. The finish is rather dry and boring, and I'm not really sure what I'm drinking here. Not offensive in any way, mainly because there's nothing here."
"Not the best beer I've had, but it's a safe, enjoyable one. Would buy again."

"Motor city brew works goes all the way in the perfection of this beer. All of the flavor of a good English ale but not too heavy. By far one of the best beers I've ever had. If you like new castle, you will love this beer. A must try when visiting midtown Detroit."

"Overall, this is a great brew to mindfully knock back at a bowling alley or somewhere else where you only want to minimally think about what you are drinking."
"D: This was actually my first review for this style, and it ended up being about what I expected. Not a bad beer, but not a really great scent or taste or body either. Easy enough to drink, and a step up from macro lagers, but not on par with the majority of other craft beers."

"A light overall feel, this beer is easy to pound, just not very tasty. It was just too blah to me, so I would skip it in a bar, but I will pound the rest of the 6 pack in one sitting."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable, but very mild. As I have never tasted a mild before, I am going to assume that's part of the style."
"O - Pretty enjoyable. Great for summertime or winter, and with a nice twist to the standard grain type."
"Overall this beer is alright, and with some tweaking I think it would be really good. As it stands, the nose is good but unbalanced and the whole affair is just a little too light, even considering the style."
"D: Overall nothing offensive which I'm sure is what they are shooting for. I could sown a few of these on a hot day."
"Sorry guys, next time I enjoy a ""ghettoblaster", it better be blasting Too $hort's - Life is too short."
"Comes out of the tap a barely translucent honey-mahogany. Malty, woody, slightly sweet aroma is not strong but still appealing. Malty flavor has honey-sweet and woody undertones along with hints of hops and spice. Fairly smooth, tingly texture gives it a decent finish."
"D- Not the best representative for this style of beer as it just doesn't have enough going for it in all categories. It is what it is, an average beer."
"d - a session brew for sure. kegs of ghettoblaster seem to be the default choice for gallery openings and other art related activities in and around detroit."
"Drinkability: This is pretty good. I admit that I tried this beer just because I thought the name was ridiculous. I was pleasantly surprised, though, when I got a beer that is good and is something I could drink again."
"D-Good and a perfect session beer. I used to drink this about 9 years ago, and was looking forward to finally rating it, but this bottle my bro saved me is nowhere near as good as the on-tap version I had the other day, or as in my memory."
"Drinkable brew."
"The pour was very nice, rich looking medium brown with a mild cloudiness about it. Rich color here with a nice head of off white which hung around for a few moments before settling down into a thin film. The aroma was light, medium fruit notes, apricot maybe with a hint of some light spice and tons of grain. More of the same on the taste as I run through on this one. The flavor was a bit lacking for me. Nice malt profile with a light ouch of fruit and spice, but not nearly strong enough of a profile to really get me to enjoy it. Smooth, mellow carbonation and a low abv made it nice and and drinkable, though a bit dull. Overall with a name like this I expect alot more, but a decent beer none the less."
"Drinkability: Very high - if I liked the feel more, I'd probably give it a 5. Very easy to drink, especially with food."
"A quick inspection of the bottle reveals a location for a best before date stamp, but no date stamped anywhere. The beer is a clear copper and poured with a thin wisp of fine, off-white bubbles that formed a bit of a collar. Fairly sticky lacing, just not a lot of it. The meager head did linger though. The aroma was mild, some earthy malt, hint of fruit, light hopping, perhaps some chocolate far in the background. As it warmed, there were light notes of toast and nuts. Light bitterness, malt seemed a bit thin right from the start. Some sweetness, caramel mostly, and mild hop flavour, but still quite mild overall. A little buttery. Lingering dark malt bite without the fullness of flavour expected from these grains. Carbonation was on the low side, fine for the style, but the body felt watery rather than just light. A bit dry. Inoffensive, but not a great example of the style and not a beer that I'd look for again. I'd still try it if found on tap though, just to see how it is under different serving conditions."
"D- It's definitely an easy drinker. I had it while helping to prep the Thanksgiving dinner. It'd be great for a backyard BBQ, tailgate, or holiday gathering."
"This beer is also overly mild even for ""mild ale"" At best I find it to be kind of lame."
"Dark, shoe leather copper with bronzed edges. Small, bubbly, ring of off-beige head. Light plum and blackberry fruit notes mix with roasted/toasted malts and a yeasty twang. Toasted biscuit and cardboard malt notes up front. Mild wine-y fruit notes mid-palate. Some lightly roasted malt comes through. Light herbal hop and grainy bitterness in the clean, dryish finish. Moderate body with a vastly overcarbonated feel. If this were creamier and fuller and less carbonated I think it would be much better. Still, this has promise (and maybe it would be much better on-cask)."
"Final Thoughts: With a name like Ghettoblaster I expected more. Once I got over the initial disappointment and took the beer for what it was, it was a decent beer."
"Pretty good, but not as aggressive as the name promised."
"Dark brown with slight head, faint aroma, very watery as their lineup tended to be this night. Understated carbonation. Drinkable and a session ale. Taste is mostly in the malt profile, with chocolate malt and caramel. Could have been a cask ale in a blind tasting. Nothing exceptional."
"D: Not what I'm looking for in a session brew."
"from the bottle. was a little surprised by the color of this I thought it was going to be a golden color.poured a light mahogany with a light tan head.aroma browm sugar, malts, dark fruits, sweet. flavor,the flavors did not come close to the aroma, everything was on the weak side, got malts, some hops, sugar. to bad the flavor did not live up to the aroma. it was a easy drinking beer."
"Downable, a good session brew. I would drink it again, especially now that I have a better idea of what a mild is."
"Light-medium mouth, this is the apotheosis of a session brew."
"This beer is very light brown in color. The nose is dominated by a fruity, malty profile. This medium-bodied beer starts out with a light, spicy, clean, hops bitterness, then continues on to a husky/grainy malt flavor and then ends with a slight burnt aftertaste. I'm hoping that I just got a bad bottle, because most Motor City beers are much better than this."
"Wow...thanks to Proc for reccomending this brew. Pours out to a brown sugar color with the very slightest hint of cloudiness. Medium carbonation and a head that stood the test of time and was very well formed. Odors of nuts, barley and honey were detected, but the sweetness was not overpowering. Very refreshing mouthfeel, with overtones of malt and dough. Finishes well, with a smooth and creamy aftertaste. My buddy Proc summed it up well; this is a session beer. And a damned fine one, when a sixer is only about 7 dollars.Strongly Recommended when in the Detroit area."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, well-carbonated and lively, very sessionable. Great beer, just don't understand the name or the style, though. I would almost call this a brown ale instead of the English mild it declares itself. Many thanks to trbeer for sharing."
"Thanks to trbeer for the beer. My brother and I figured that the Great Lakes Invitational championship game (U of M vs. MSU) was the perfect chance to crack this one open, and we were right. Ironically, I have this one in the Levitation glass, and though it's not quite up to the Levitation standards, it's definitely a very solid session drinker, with a nice malt character (I love caramel malt!) and just the right touch of hops, and this is one I'd be glad to have again!!"
"Original Review 4-26-02: A mild pale ale. Refreshing. You could put down quite a few of these during a session. A rather light Pale, but still heavier than a Bass Ale. I'd drink this again."
"A great beer regardless of its misnomer."
"This beer was my beer of choice for the three years that I lived in the Cass corrider of Detroit. The Microbrew only being two blocks away made it easy to acquire and with a name like ghettoblaster it is hard to pass it up. The beer pours a dark with little head. The smells are subtle with a clean taste. While this is not an award winning beer it goes down very easy and does not take long to polish of a couple of pitchers with your freinds."
"This beer was very drinkable. I would definately have another. In fact, I did."
"I wasn't expecting much of this beer, but I was really surprised. Its quite a tasty brew. Slightly hoppy and toasty aroma and tawny brown in color. Taste has a toasty malt backbone with just a bit flavor hops peeking through. Mouthfeel is appropriate to the style. Solid beer that won't overpower or bore."
"This beer pours a hazy copper color out of the bottle with a thin head and a vaguely toasty, mostly dusty nose. The flavor is all malt with only faint hints of any hop bitterness in the finish. I get the overwhelming sense of raw grain. Very simple beer, awesome name, better effort than most macros..."
