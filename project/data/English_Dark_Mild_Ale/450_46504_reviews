"Great beer. Yards makes some of the best."

"A dark beer that tastes good and not too heavy.  It's surprisingly smooth."
""
"O:  relatively tame overall with everything in its place, Brawler might be the ultimate session beer ... it's full of good grain and malt flavor without getting too sweet, and it's crisp and so very easy to drink.  the malt presence does, in fact, have a good English ale feel.  several American-made amber ales come close to hitting these notes, but they don't hit as well as this one -- we need more beers like this!  4.2% ABV, loads of flavor, beautiful clarity, crisp and clean ... a brew Philadelphia and PA is lucky to have."

""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Nice toasty taste, great beer!"
""
"F: Sweet, never really bracing, not much of a food beer."
"The best of the Yards lot. I live a stones throw away so I taste all their beers, a great product but Yards variety is lacking, as everything is good but nothing is great."
""
""
"Good beer, solid, not great."
""
"Lacks flavor. Disappointing for a Yards brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly drinkable, but no sacrifice on the flavor. If you enjoy malt forward flavors this is the  light beer for you..4.2 ABV means you can go a few rounds with the Pugilist!"
""
"Definitely a beer to sip and not to drink in gulps. I love Yards."

"My go-to dark ale."
""

"nice drinkable and approachable ale."

"Wonderful coffee notes on first swallow. Smooth finish. Lovely beer. Will be adding to my rotation."
"The closest American craft to a true English ale I've tasted."
""
""
""
""
"Calling a beer a mild is no excuse for the beer not having any flavor. This was highly unsatisfying and watery to drink. Not recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fine tasting mild, and perfect for mild days because it doesn't sacrifice a full flavor. Caramel malts and significant roasted almond quality. Nice floral bitterness, strawberry on a biscuit toast. No buttery flavor, and on the dry side. It's a tight feeling beer, lingering astringency. Robust and gassy crispness cover the sweetness making the beer very approachable."

"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, amber color. There was a small off-white head that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. Lighter but good aroma. Some malts, perhaps a touch of biscuit. The taste is a bit lighter, but pretty good. Caramel malts, but almost no sweetness. A touch of biscuit. A faint bitterness in the finish. A nice session beer!"

"I am definitely no expert in the tasting of beer. But, this is a fine tasting ale. Good taste, no bitterness. Pretty smooth for an ale. No head to speak of, but I think that's overrated in the beer world. After all, you don't drink foam. Good color, not too dark, not too light. Very drinkable. I like it."

"Poured a deep, clear mahogany. It has a creamy tan head that mostly dissipates but lingers around the circumference. Nice lacing. The aroma is light and malty despite the dark color with mild malt notes. The taste is rich and malty and the body is just light enough to hold up the flavor. A great session ale."

"O: Not recommendable. If someone buys you one, thank them and drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent beer and I know it's unfair to compare it to other beers but in my opinion this is yard's worst beer, which may be more of a compliment to their other brews. I wish the backend of this beer had more bitterness, I feel as if it is unbalanced in that aspect."

"O- A well balance sessionable beer. Very easy to drink. The flavor is not over the top, but it tasty."
""
"Overall this beer has a good flavor and is VERY drinkable. I will be purchasing this again."
"O- Going by the current trends of the craft beer world, this won't get many beer sippers all hot and bothered, but personally this beer really works for me. It's not going to beat you over the head with the flavor/aroma whomp stick, but it's a great example of a Dark Mild. Just another great ale from one of the most underrated breweries around. Recommended. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark reddish maroon with a dallop of foam on the top. Deep malty smell, caramel. Taste is a sweet chewy malt. Light flavored. Bready. Very mild ale, quite sessionable. Has that historic British feel to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is the beer if you're looking for an English style drinkable malt bomb. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful, brown in color, with a faint amber hue. The head is tan, and lasting. It's a clean-smelling, malty brew. Light malt, alight toast. The hop smell is herbal, but distant. Mild. Solid flavor...malt and a little bitterness. Earthy and satisfying. It would go well with a burger. Medium body. Good, and drinkable beer."
""
"Overall: This is a very good beer. Very malty, which is perfect for a malt fiend like me, and very quaffable. So far, I’m impressed with the Yards Brewing Company"
"O: Seeing how Yards is about as local as local gets for me, I've been making my rounds sampling their brews whenever I can. Yards hit the nail on the head with this one, making a very solid, sessionable pub brew. If you're ever looking for something flavorful while remaining light enough to knock a few pints back, give this one a second look—it's, if nothing else, worth the try."

"O= A unique beer. Haven't had one exactly like it, though it reminds me some of a Belgian quad. Very nice beer from a local (for me, anyway) brewery."
""
""
""
""
"If you drink butweezer, put that urine down and try one of these. I would be a great beer to help ease yourself off of your addiction to garbage!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good flavor and low alcohol makes this a great beer to drink multiples of. Nice toasty malt and a nutty flavor lingers well into the hefty body. Pretty good with danish blue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Pours a crystal clear ruby color with no real head. Smells oaty. Tastes malty, not too much else. Feels flat and just a touch bitter at the end. Really not too impressed with this one, kinda reminds me of Sam Adams or maybe some type of Yuengling or something, not a whole lot going on here. Can't recommend it, especially at 4.2 abv."
""
""
""
""
"Quite a nice dark mild offering peasant malt and a clean, and somewhat creamy body."
""
"Decent, a little bland but not offensive. Sessionable."
""
"O - Great drinkability and flavor. A pretty good English mild. Nicely balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking and flavorful. It's been a long time since I've had this and it's a lot better than I remember. It's nice to see an American brewery tackle an English Mild and do a nice job of it."
""
""
""
"Overall - nothing wrong with this beer, and I expect great things from Yards. But for my preferences, this beer is a bit too mild in flavor."
""
"I ended up buying a mixed-case of Yards beers just before Christmas. They were really fresh and seemed like a good choice to bring home and share some Philly beer. I am really happy with my choice and would not hesitate to buy the same case at the price I got it for in the future. A good mix of different styles and most importantly interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
"Brown colored with ruby along the edges. One-finger off white head that dissipates fairly quickly but leaves a small amount of head on top of the beer. Bready malts in the aroma with a bit of roasted malt and a touch of sweetness. Very smooth tasting, just the right amount of carbonation, and light-to-medium bodied. An enjoyable ale that is easily quaffable. I'd have no problem drinking several of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This lives or dies by one fact: would I want multiple servings of this in a single sitting? At first, I didn't think so, but this grows on me the more I drink it. It does drink like a bigger beer at times, but at the same token, doesn't have a strong enough flavor profile that would allow it to fully get away with it. So I'll hesitantly say yes, I would drink multiple pints of this at a bar. I probably wouldn't buy a 6 pack of it, but I'd love to see what cask conditioning transforms it into."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was mostly disappointed by the look and feel of this beer. It felt like it had potential."
""
""
""
""
"O - Other than the carbonation, it's a pretty solid brew with a nice flavor profile for the low alcohol percent. A sessionable dark beer!"
""
"Not much experience with this style, but that off flavor is not pleasant."
""
""
""
"O-nice crisp beer. I'd put it in the Yuengling/Flat Tire category. It's an easy drinking beer. Unfortunately, this is usually found near other craft beer which puts it at a disadvantage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Great beer! good mouthfeel and flavor. No aftertase to speak of and it has a nice crisp finish. Malt is king with this one. Very subtle hops, no bitterness. Just a nice crisp almost sweet session ale Yards ESA is also a good product if you are looking for a bit more hops in your brew."
""
""
"I'd love to try this on cask."
"There is not a session beer as diverse as this. The connoisseur will be happy with the color and drinkability for sure. The is a great gateway beer if you want to transition your friends over to ales from lagers, or from macros in to micros. Clearly not the best beer ever, but a reliable pour no doubt."

"O: A good brew. I love the variation from the standard styles and am pleased to say that the result is tasty and very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly sessionable. Would much rather play beer pong with this than any of the BMC alternatives. That said, I can't see myself ever buying this beer for myself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's not too bad. Malt flavors are almost there, but the hops are a little confusing. Still a recognizable dark mild. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I could drink these all day, but it is nothing too crazy. Just a solid, well-rounded ale."
""
""
"Overall – This beer, while suffering from a little to much sweetness, is not terrible and could go over well as a session beer for those times you want to have a few and not loose your head. Those with a sweet tooth will like it more than others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty decent session beer and an alright mild brown ale. Nothing spectacular but nothing amazing either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable and a change up from the normal offering of a PA brewer. Very good."
""
""
"Overall – A light abv beer with a roasty flavor. Not the greatest darker brew, but lighter and good for a session beer. One to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very easy to drink and very sessionable (though I suppose that is the goal for the style). This is definitely a light flavored but enjoyable beer that could be drank all night long."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and very sessionable; I would have no problem drinking this all night long."
"well im so happy i found yards in willimasport heard alot about their beers and this style of beer works i drank this beer too cold tonight the other night i drank it warmer and i like it sitting in a english pub this would hit the spot great color so i will drank more dark mild ale nice dark red in color and i taste so fruit so enjoy this beer and other dark mild ales"
""
""
""
"Pours a brilliantly clear bright tawny brown color with a 1 finger bright white head. Big malty nose of caramel and toffee with touches of chocolate. On the heavier side of a light body with incredible briskness. Body holds together all the way through with good carbonation a punch of caramel malt character. Some toffee on the sides of the mouth, generally sweet but a bit of charcoal on the back along with the right amount of hop character gives this beer impeccable balance. This beer holds true to its name, definitely one you can go a few rounds with and one I wouldn't mind doing it with either. The perfect balance of flavor and drinkability."
""
"O: Not very good. Other reviews speak highly of it, but I found it to be dull and unsatisfying."
""
"Overall for a mild, pretty pleasant. Lacking a little bit in flavor and feel, but drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is a pretty awesome beer from a very awesome brewery. really hoping to get to do the bbq cook off there again this summer! hopefully i'll go in with more knowledge of their brews and get to taste this stuff on tap!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So gorgeous in my glass, and only 1/4 left. Sigh."
""
""
""
""
"If you are looking for a low-alcohol craft beer, this ain't it. Try Stone Levitation, as it is far superior."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Goes down ok, somewhat tasty, not filling, not much of a kick, ok representation of style. Not a beer that I would seek out, however a decent beer to sit with for a while."
""
"I would say that this is a good example of a sessionable beer."
"This is a very well brewed example of a style I never much cared for, which makes it sort of hard to review. On the one hand, it's bland. On the other hand, that blandess is not only intentional but expertly crafted."
""
""
""
""
"All in all a good beer for a late spring or summer night. A little too fruity for winter."
""
"If its on tap or in a bottle, do yourself a favor, get some!"
""
"This one will find a regular spot in my fridge."
""
""
""
"O- not a bad brew. The smell was a lil hard to figure out at first. The flavor was light but the mouthfeel was decent."
"I highly recommend trying this on tap if you can find it"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, some nuts. Taste is malts up front, some breadiness, very lightly hopped, a bit on the mild side. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
"Overall: Probably one of my favorite's from Yards, roasty and delicious."
""
""
"Very easy to drink but not particularly crisp or refreshing. Still, enjoyable if unspectacular. Clearly fashioned after the old-school British pub style ales. Worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"

"aroma is as earthy as it can get. deep malty nose, hints of leather, oak, nice touches of roasty malts and earthy grains. really just wonderfully balanced and smooth, nothing heavy here at all and this carries over perfectly into the flavor which was nothing short of stellar. smooth, creamy and tea like flavors dominate with hints of oak, earthy and muted hops and a deep resonated earthy grain"
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this is one sessionable beer at only 4.2%. The body is just full enough to allow the flavors to come out without losing drinkability or becoming syrupy. The carbonation is not overly noticeable, which is good as too much carbonation would certainly detract from the subtle flavors."
"O: I don't know this style too well, as I generally gravitate to beers that kick you in the face with flavor, but I enjoyed this brew. Had plenty of flavor, nothing offensive, and I could definitely have three or four in a night. Well done."
"O - I'd try this again. Quite enjoyable."
"Never had this beer before I bought a Varity Pack while in the Philadelphia Area. I have had the IPA and the Philadelphia Pale Ale, which I really like. The Brawler has a dark color with a great smell. The taste is smooth and very flavorful. Good after taste. When I am back in the Philadelphia Area, I will get more of this Ale."
"Overall: A wonderful, sessionable beer that is very English in character. Nice and malty but the hops do just enough to balance this one out. I will look for this one again when I am in the Philly area."
"sits well in your mouth.. tasty enough to go few rounds.... thus the name."
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice deep amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet grass nose and flavor is same plus some sweet malt. $7.00 for a 12oz bottle at Sheraton Society Hill Hotel Philadelphia, PA."
"Not sure where or when I first had the Brawler, but I've had it multiple times on tap and in bottles. Pours a medium brown with ruby tints, and a decent white head that generally retains well. Aroma is light and mild, sweet malts and hints of earthy hops. Taste of sweet malts, nice and light, caramel, and maybe a suggestion of orange blossom, gently hopped, and slightly bitter. Clean, medium mouthfeel, and quite sessionable."
"Overall: Not a very memorable brew from Yard's. I got this in a variety case and it was a struggle to finish 6 of these."
"Overall a very easy to drink beer with a lot going on."
"O- It’s definitely a session beer at 4% abv, not a lot going on, pretty bland taste, for a mild it does have a decent amount of flavor though, it does what it’s meant to do."
"O: This is a very good session beer."
"Had a pint at Raven Hill Bluegrass in Manyunk, PA. From notes written up in June on Philadelphia Beer Week trip."
"O: An enjoyable experience and a pretty solid session beer from Yards Brewing."
"O: I enjoy this. It is a great session ale. I would have no problem seasoning this."
"Overall not bad, but I don't know how many I could have before the flavor got old."
"I only have the one bottle, but I’m not overly excited about it."
"This is a great beer. Session indeed. I'd like to go all night with the homies and a case of this."
"Overall it's a nice light, easy to drink beer creation. I'd like this one along with dinner or as a session beer."
"Solid, light with good flavors. Definitely need to let this warm. Even for 4.2%, it was a little thin in the body."
"Yeah, I could drink quite a few of these."
"Brown in color with a thinness showing at the edges. It boasts a well-structured, cream-colored head. The smell is of nutty malts and spicy British hops...probably Goldings. Accurate smell for the style and the taste is spot on as well. It has a little bit of sweetness with some nutty characteristics (walnuts) that carry on into the aftertaste along with a moderate hop presence ...again the spice of British hops. At the tail end of the aftertaste, after the beer has warmed a bit, there's a fruity note. Below medium in body and very easy to drink. Not a bad beer at all...not a great one, but not bad...and I rarely give credit to anything from Philadelphia."
"Dark brown colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is toasted malts.Taste is bread,butter and various malts.Overall a decent beer that is thin and relatively smooth.Seems like a beer best for the warmer months.I would recommend to try at least once.I'd probably buy again."
"Concluison: I had high hopes for this beer as I have never tried a sample of this style, however I have brewed ales that I consider to be English Mild ales (or as close as I can guess) and I love the overall idea of a session ale. My hopes were not met, and I will continue to search for more examples of this style."
"Alcohol? If you're looking for it, move along. You won't taste it and you'd probably have to down a six-pack of this to feel it. This is about as easygoing as a style gets without feeling watered-down or mass-marketed. On a cool summer night like the ones we've had lately, it would be tough to find a better beer to enjoy with the windows open. Since this isn't complex by any means, just about any lover of suds owes it to him or herself to give this a shot. This can appeal to quite a large audience!"
"O: A decent low ABV beer that I can see myself drinking again for the right occasion."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I love a English dark that is put together right. This is a nice session beer @ 4.20%"
"O- An enjoyable easy drinking beer. Would love to see more breweries brew a simple, drinkable, flavorful ale at abvs this low. But alas, that is not the custom of the times."
"Medium body and carbonation, bubbly and sticky on the tongue. Drinks okay, alright in a bar where there isn't many options, but not really my favorite offering from Yards."
"D - the drinkability factor on this one is through the roof! This is a session beer all day long. If it was carried in this area I would always have a sixer of this in my fridge for daily quaffing. A good session brew."
"Pours a deep brownish red with a very light tan head. dissipates with no lacing quite quickly. Sweet malty smell, not much else going on in the nose. Nice sweet malty flavor, perhaps some hickory smoke in there and some brown sugar. Almost has a hickory smoked bacon quality to it. A pinch of bitter rounds it off nicely with the sweet flavors. This is my first beer from Yard's and its not too shabby at all."
"There's a terrific amount of body considering the low ABV. And the carbonation does it's job well to keep the beer moving quickly and refreshing at all times. Overall this is a very easy drinking beer - the kind of beer that is easy to enjoy without much thought or effort, but is still rewarding with a variety of simple flavors."
"the CPJ"
"O: Very drinkable, pretty low ABV, nothing very special about it but there is nothing bad about it. I could see myself getting another six pack sometime and enjoying them as a session beer."
"There's not much special about this beer but that's what makes it so damn great. There are not enough solid session beers here in the U.S. so a brew like this is a true gem!"
"O: Very good, a nice low ABV beer that I could drink in pretty much any season. Glad that I can now pick it up at my local stores."
"Overall: I could see this as a sessionable thirst quencher for people who prefer dark beers, but overall, I'm not very impressed."
"A good, easy drinking beer in my opinion."
"O: Overall a very easy to drink beer with a light body, almost carbonation free,decent taste with a dry aftertaste."
"O: The beer has potential, just needs some more flavor. I like what is there already, just give it more malt and this would be really tasty."
"After I finished my notes, I took another Brawler out to the hammock, and then looked at how filthy the hammock was and decided to sit on the back porch instead. Highly sessionable, great for a cookout, a poker game, or watching the Flyers or Eagles dash your hopes against the pavement once again. Overall, a refreshing and insanely drinkable beer, accessible to newbies, but with enough flavor to keep veterans interested. I have no idea how typical this beer is of its style, but it's fast becoming a favorite of mine on its own merits."
"Probably would benefit from some more hops to balance it all out and maybe a bit more alcohol to give it more character."
"From a food pairing stand point, I recommend this beer with any kinds of foods. I've had it with with sandwiches and it didn't downgrade the taste at all."
"This bridges the gap of brown ale to mild. Tasty but nothing really stands out. Nice to see an American example."
"Pours a hazy amber to brown in color, with an off white head. In the aroma, a small roast and hint of coffee. In the taste, a hint of coffee and roast, a caramel sweetness, and a bit watery. A small bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry caramle in the aftertaste. Good flavors, just a mild though, hence it being thin."
"The bar keep at Tulunes in Johnstown recommended that I try Yards Brawler Ale....which to me was a clone of Bass Pale Ale. There is nothing exciting about this beer. The color was amber with zero head. There was no scent. The taste was as mentioned above...alot like Bass Pale Ale. This beer is certainly better than budlite!!! The mouthfeel is fine could certainly Session. COmpared to other beers it just doesnt have enough going on to keep me coming back."
"Overall: I'd say this is an interesting ale that's something a stout lover like myself would reach for on a summer day. The malts are pleasant, and I could see this being a session beer. I'm not disappointed with my purchase (and I'm not just saying that because I'm from Philly). Again, could take the carbonation down a notch, but a nice drink."
"Overall it is a drinkable dark ale, properly titled a mild dark ale."
"This is a really nice English pub-style ale. Very enjoyable. Where are my fish and chips? Nice job, yards. Now behave yourself at the sporting events!"
"Overall: This beer would be above average if it wasn't so over carbonated. Otherwise, it's a nice mild ale."
"O - Certainly a mild ale. And its dark too. Hence the name. I wasnt too impressed here but this one is an easy drinker for sure."
"Overall, not recommended. Grab the yellow Pale Ale instead."
"Pours a clear amber, with a quickly dissipating offwhite head. Nose is malty some light grassy notes, light hops. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is medium body, light carbonation, has a watery mouth feel. Finish is sweet malt and bready, light grassiness with some light hops ending. Overall not to remarkable. an average brew"
"The brawler was interesting. I found this to be something different than the normal stuff that most breweries are putting out these days. This beer poured out as a really nice dark brown color, looked like burnt caramel. blended with a stout. The aromas were mostly roasted malts, some hops too in the mix and some sweetness. The flavors were kind of on the light side. I don't know why but I felt like this should have had a much stronger flavor it. I'll give this one a try again one day."
"All in all, Brawler is a very tasty and extremely drinkable session beer. A nice effort from Yards. Look forward to drinking it again in the future."
"HV"
"This is my first english mild so I cannot really judge this brew against it's peers. I can, however, say that this is a very tasty and enjoyable beer. It's quite malty and flavorful, yet only 4.2%. An ideal session beer. There is a good amount of visual appeal, too. Dark brown body that is highlighted with crimson hues. Full fluffy head with mild lacing. And the mouthfeel is probably it's best aspect. Full bodied and silky feel on the tongue with just enough carbonation to give it a little life. This is a great effort from Yards and one I look forward to having again."
"Dr. Not my favorite flavor, but good and very easy to drink."
"D: Very drinkable, maybe just two rounds though."
"The first glass contaminated the entire beer by adding a disgustingly buttery smell and taste. The beer was poured into a separate tumbler for review."
"D/M: VERY light and drinkable. Fits as a very good session beer that you can drink all day. It has enough weight to it to pair with food."
"Maybe I'm still new to the ""mild"" style, but I just wish it had a tad more character. This beer has grown on me over the past couple of years, and I could see myself liking it even more with the next one."
"Pours clear reddish brown with a small slightly rocky tan head. Head slowly fades, but leaves a small amount of lace. On the nose, aromas of dark fruit, apple, wood, and burnt notes. The flavour is malt-forward, moderately sweet throughout with a slight sour component. There is a hint of hops, but they're definitely secondary. Burnt coffee notes enter towards the finish, along with sour apple. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and slight carbonation. Overall, this is a decent, sweetish mild. It is quite flavourful with a nice complement of fruity and roasty notes."
"12 oz bottle. Pours redish-brown with a foamy off-white head, no carbonation. Aroma is of bready malt with some hints of grassy hops. Light, smooth body. Flavors are light of toasted malt and some brown sugar. A lot of astringency. Finish is short. I could not finish the bottle."
"Drinkability was average. I could put a few of these away no problem, but overall wan't too impressed with this one. Have had much better beers from Dock Street, such as Philly Amber and Bohemian."
"A good sessionable ale with a nice feel and easy drinking characteristics. It is just interesting enough to keep me drinking it, but it is still a long ways away from something that I would seek out or go out of my way to order."
"Off tap at the Philly airport this beer was a hazy garnet color with one finger of khaki-colored head. The foam was little more than a very thin layer after five minutes and it left no lacing. The aroma was of toasted nuts, toasted malt, and caramel malt. The flavors were similar with a strong nutty/malty character though with an added element of tartness that seemed to me to be a little yeasty. What is that? Otherwise, the Munich and caramel malts came through cleanly. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation medium/light."
"Yard's Brawler is a beer that I really enjoy in bottle form (no review posted yet), but always seems to disappoint when I have it on draft. It tastes very mild, there doesn't seem to be enough hop flavor or bitterness, the malt flavor is not expressed well with just a bit of sweetness and the mouthfeel often seems off, harsher than in the bottle. I don't know what's the magic that goes into the bottle, but I find it hard to believe that they can't get it right for kegged beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid milder beer worth drinking for a while."
"D: Super drinkable seeing that I am flying through this six-pack. Great Sunday beer."
"Overall an excellent example of an English session beer. Give me this over a bottle of macro swill any day."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, clean, and gently carbonated."
"D - Well I actually wanted more sweetness in this beer which was a type of a mild, but overall enjoyed this succession able beer. Will not seeks out again though."
"Cheers!"
"Overall I think they accomplished what they set out to do. This style is intended to be on the plain side with a high drinkabilty and thats exactly what it is."
"A fresh herby bitterness and marginally acidic bite on the sides of the mouth initiate the flavor which burst with a musty fruitiness, finishing with tiny caramel and medium-light malt punch. The feel starts off and follows through round and smooth, however, the flavor and feel seems to get sucked away dry suddenly by a cardboard/chalky wash. A little less of that, and you have a fine session ale."
"Overall I always enjoy having traditional versions of English styles on cask and this was no exception. A good example of the style and well worth a shot."
"Pours a moderately dark brown color with a light tan head. A bit of sticky lacing, though not much. Nose brings faint caramel, a bit of bread, and some mild chocolate. Taste is semi sweet with caramel, light toffee, and lighter milk chocolate. Light feel. An easy drinking beer and a good pub option."
"Poured into a 16oz draft glass. The coloring is red amber with a nice head at pour. The head fades away with little lacing on the glass. The smell is very nice. It has little to no hop presence and the maltiness is well done. This beer has a really nice taste and feel to it. I would really like to have another. I would recommend this beer to a friend. How about that a Pittsburgh guy recommending a Philly beer : )"
"D: as advertised, a session ale; but it's not distinctive enough to draw me for repeated visits"
"Apologies..."
"Overall, a great take on the style from Yards. I always have some of this in the house for when I'm craving a lunch beer without an afternoon nap afterwards."
"It looks like something knocked out the Brawler Pugilist. Whether it was the right jab of pasteurization, the left hook of larger scale production or some other factor, I can't say. But what I do know is that it's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog... and this dog has neither size nor fight. Next contender please."
" D- This beer is very light and has no real flavor. The tart note and fizz are all that really stand out."
"Malty, coffee, caramel, chocolate, toasted goodness. I was handed one of these, and was superimpressed, wasn't particularly beer like as far as my palate was concerned. Much more of some sort of other drink, but still wonderful. It's a nice after dinner beer just as a suggestion."
"Color is dark brown to nearly black with a reddish hue and good clarity. Nice foamy head that reduces to a thin white cap and lots of wet lacings on the glass. Sweet toasted malt aroma after the pour and nutty aromas when taking a sip. Dark fruit aromas kick up with a swirl of the glass. Light bodied with lazy carbonation. Toasted malt flavor in the front that tapers into a lightly bitter apple, dry finish with some nutty undertoneds as well. Very drinkable."
"Not my favorite beer, but I'd definitely drink it again. And it's another good one from Yards."
"D- This Ale has good flavor not to bold like other Ales but good. Would drink this again for sure."
"D- definitely agree with the label that this would be an excellent session beer"
"Pours a clear mahogany with a small head that betrays little in the way of aromas except for a distant whiff of toasted malts and tea. On the palate, there are big flavors of overcooked biscuits, lots of earthy and tea-like bitterness with a lightly fruity sweetness; altogether these flavors call to mind a burnt apple fritter. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Altogether very interesting and very enjoyable."
"D: A 4.2% with plenty of flavor means high drinkability. Yards Brewing Company definitely has a niche."
"I have NO idea what a Pugilist Style Ale is....but this is a pretty good session beer. It pours a clear dark amber/brown with little to no head. the flavors are of roasty malt and a light hint of coffee. Very drinkable and light on the mouth feel. Not my kind of beer."
"Pours a coppper brown color with almost no head and no lacing present. However, the color is very nice. The smell is of caramel malts along with some breadiness. The taste is of caremel and sweet malt backbones with some dark fruits in the middle, raisins and plums. The end has a slight hop kick. The mouthfeel is creamy with low carbonation. Overall its is a very solid beer, nice sweet flavor that has nothing to dislike, it is also an easy drink. I would say for sure this could be a session beer."
"I poured this into my Sam Smith's pint glass. The appearance is ruby/dark brown with white head that dissipates fast w/o lacing, the smell is that of dark chocolate, but it leads to a roasty, bready taste. The mouthfeel is light and somewhat dry. Drinkability is fairly good."
"pours a brown ruby color mostly transparent but a bit cloudy. Spare off white head, spare lacing and lively carb. strong bread malty flavor with burnt toasted nutty hints. light body and slick oily texture. goes down very smooth with a slight chalky finish."
"I really liked this beer. It's sweet, but seems to magically pull balance from somewhere."
"breadcrusty flavors with esters that grow as the beer warms; appropriate bitterness. not much depth of flavor but that might be acceptable in this style. softer nutty elements creep in with the warmth"
"D-Not a classic English dark mild but tasty, smooth and very poundable. Contains enough character to keep things interesting for a multi pint session. I like this from the bottle---and even more so on cask!"
"I have had only Harpoon's Brown for this style before, or from what I remember. This is a good, solid sessionable brown brew. A brown brew you could session at a BBQ in the dead of summer and it would hit the spot, there is something to be said about that."
"D- This is freakin' slammable- a wonderful alternative to the normal session beer!"
"Drinkability: I love this style of beer. I could easily drink quite a few with no poor consequence."
"D: Well this beer is designed for a few rounds. Low ABV makes it an exceptional session beer with a great amount of flavor."
"D: Easy drinking this one down and decent enough to have a few. Nothing over the top or harsh. Worth a go."
"Poured from a standard 12 oz brown bottle with no indication of freshness. Appears a clear amber color with a finger of tanned head that retains fairly well supported by constantly rising bubbles. Aroma is malty sweet smelling of caramel with a slight touch of hops and a bit of a mineral character to it as well. Taste is malty with a light touch of hops and some buttery notes through the finish. Light feel with a modest amount of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. Overall impression is that it is a bit light and seemingly watered down but everything about it is to style with the exception of a higher than expected carbonation level."
"Drinkability: You know, this is kind of an all-day sessionable beer -- nice flavors that are solid but aren't going to wreck your palate; body isn't too heavy and the ABV is pretty manageable too... Cheers to Yards for this offering."
"Low ABV and fairly favorable, this made for a pleasant and easy drinking experience. I don't see why you couldn't session a couple of these rather easily."
"D - Very drinkable. I could see myself getting into quite a few of these without tiring of it."
"This beer went down quick. Which is great with the low abv. This makes a great session beer. Hope to see it on a shelf near me soon."
"D: A surprisingly full-flavored, nice drinking ale which is pretty well-built for sessioning. However, this is a good beer for those who don't really like beer because it is relatively light-bodied and drinkable. A really great effort from Yards on this one."
"A: Healthy head from a hard pour, light brown to ice tea in color, no lacing - 3.25, S: Slight doughy sweetness to the nose, mostly malts with a hint of citrus and earthiness - 3.50, T: Toasted grains, thin caramel, ever so slight hop presence, alcohol is almost undetectable - 4.00, M: Medium bodied - 3.00, D: A very nice session ale, very drinkable - 4.00"
"Drinkability: Clean flavors and aromas and a pleasant mouthfeel coupled with its lower ABV make it a perfect session brew."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal malt scent with a faint roasted aroma and English yeast esters. There is a nice bot of fruitiness that compliments the sweet malt aroma. The taste is decent. It has a caramel sweetness up front with a dry fruity finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking session ale, but it's not the most interesting beer around."
"This brew is ok, but really lacks any punch (pun intended) at all. As the bottle states, you could definitey go a few rounds with this, but with so many others to choose from why bother."
"Pours a clear but dark amber-brown with a half-finger of ecru head that leaves a few traces of transitory lacing behind. The smell is mostly of dark wheat and coffee, with some roasted malts hanging around the back door as well. The taste combines a subtle bit of roasted coffee and dark wheat built upon a foundation of malty sweetness. Everything balances nicely for a rich mild flavor. The body is a healthy heavy-moderate, with a light kiss of carbonation, and slides lithely over the tongue, making for an exceptionally drinkable sessionable brew."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Drinkability is high (no surprise here)."
"A solid and rewarding effort in the true session ale spirit. Obviously best drank fresh as can be, most likely better on draft, and probably pretty killer on cask."
"D = This goes down smoothly and the more I drink of it the better I am getting with it. I can see making this a beer to drink several of in an evening. Not a perfect drinker by any stretch, but decent enough that I have no great reason to mark it down."
"This is a highly drinkable beer, in terms of easy to swig with good flavor. Need to push this into more local dives in philly."
"I have been trying to give some local beers a go as of late so I bought a six-pack of this beer. The bottle's label does a decent job describing the color (amber). The aroma was malty with a bread-like aroma. As far as the rest of this beer, not impressed at all. It was very ordinary on the flavor front (malts, some hops, but a dry finish that was a bit stale). As far as the 4.2 abv goes, yes it is easy to drink these all night but why?? Without any real flavor or warming feeling in the palate, you might as well not waste the calories on this and get some other domestic beer that actually has a memorable flavor and is easy to drink (such as Long Trail, Flying Fish, Dogfish Head, etc.) Skip this one...not worth the money."
"Beer was a deep amber. Not much head retention, but understandable for such a low-malt beer. Very light and easy-drinking. Slightly toasty. Had a distinct maple or brown sugar like flavor to it. Malt forward and not much hops to speak of. Good session beer. Hop flavor not really there, but there was a prominent but fairly balanced bitterness."
"Overall this was a nice mild change of pace and another sessionable offering from Yards. Thanks again Matt for the opportunity to try this. Worth a look."
"D - While nothing will blow you away with this beer its a good sessionable beer with a good taste thats easy to drink worth trying sometime"
"Drinkability: excellent; I could drink this all night"
"D - eh. relatively bland for my tastes and not really what I like in a beer."
"This is a very drinkable, easily sessionable brew. A mild isn't something I'd reach for with regularity, mainly because I suppose I've become corrupted by extreme beers and I love being smacked around by huge blasts of flavor, but this is a great beer for just kicking back and enjoying without thinking much about it. A nice addition to their variety case."
"Another BOTMC, the first selection from this brewery was quite tasty, let's give this one a whirl. This brew also has a wonderful aroma of roasted malts, brown sugar and some butterscotch. Pours to a dark brown root beer color with a thick creamy head. Taste is a delicious roasted malt with hints of coffee. Mouthfeel is a hair thin but the flavor carries it through. Again as like the previous selection, Yards does alot with a little, as this brew is only 4.2% yet has great aromas and flavors. As it is described as a mild ale, it is spot on and with the flavor and AC, a sessioner without a doubt. I will enjoy the remaining Yards from this months BOTMC."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable but not really feeling it personally. Wouldn't really seek this out again."
"Dark ruby in body with fleeting off white head. Malt, hops, spice, and biscuits in the scent. Flavors of malt, burnt sugar, english pub style ale. Clean finish. I dig it. Light in body but works surprisingly well in the autumn. Hello autumn and winter afternoons."
"D - This is a highly drinkable beer. It goes down fast. But it's not extremely enjoyable though. The carbonation hits you up front with the slight malt character with some grain astringency and it finished thin and dry with a slight tang in the hop finish. While I have enjoyed Yard's beer in the past, I won't be seeking this one out again."
"D-A nice lower ABV beer with some very nice qualities. Would be a great beer for a business lunch."
"I poured from a 12 ounce glass into a standard pint. The brew is slightlyl dark with a decent 2 finger head. The aroma is faint, a bit bready. The flavor is very clean. There are biscuity notes, slightly sweet, the finish is crisp. The beer is light and very sessionable. Even though I would not make this a regular purchase it was a nice, sessionable change of pace beer."
"Drinkability: As the bottle says, it is good for a ""few rounds"". Always nice to have an English Mild in the US, even if it isn't that exciting."
"D-I could drink these all night long, probably because the low ABV and mild tastes. Again, nothing mind-blowing, but also nothing bad to say about it."
"Poured dark amber with a finger of white head, into a pint glass. The smell was dominated by caramel, oakiness, and wet leaves, and the taste confirmed this...especially the earthiness of oak and leaves. While this was a rare find, I was a little disappointed that the earthiness overpowered the caramel and any hop presence (which was subtle to begin with). The mouthfeel was nice and silky; a nice testament to the style. However, the earthiness was too much for me to handle past one pint."
"D - A very noteworthy session brew, great beer to kick back and relax and drink quite a few without busting your wallet, good rendition of a style seemingly forgotten by American craft breweries."
"Thanks to edbeer for the opportunity to try this one. Served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent chestnut with ruby red highlights when backlit. Quarter inch tan-colored skim dissipates into a thin skim; no lacing on this one. Pleasant nose - dark malts and some caramel notes; fairly subdued. Taste consistent with nose, but also reveals and earthy, coffee ground character. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a carbonation level that approaches prickly. Simple and easy drinking session beer; however, carbonation is a little too aggressive."
"D: Low ABV but I'm not really digging this one enough for me to say it's drinkable."
"D - I feel this was great beer...I'm not too familiar with the style...but the flavors that this beer presented were very tasty and it's worth a try"
"The very definition of a session beer in a dark style. Not especially flavorful but more than easy to throw back multiple bottles or glasses."
"I've also had this on tap, and the carbonation gives it a little more action, but the smoothness of the cask can not be beat."
"This is a perfect beer for early fall/late summer. The nutty flavor came out a little more as it warmed up. At 4.2% you could drink all day. It would definitely be a regular at the pub."
"Pours a perfectly clear brown with a thin head. Nose is very mild. Slight smoked roasted thing on top of malts. Not really a whole lot. Excellent flavor delivery. Nice hearty body on a malt base. Slight tang to it, but just barely a wee bit. Feel is smooth. This is extremely drinkable. A bottled English mild? Hallelujah. Bring more please."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern for $3.50. I'd been looking forward to this beer as I'm a big fan of milds and other session beers, but I found this one fell prey to most common problem of lower-alcohol beers - it's boring. Even when I really let my glass warm up, the caramel flavor was flat and not all that interesting, like a watered-down brown ale. Not bad beer, but reminds me more of the ""specialty beer"" big brewers put out, like Yuengling Black and Tan, that looks good, but doesn't taste like much of anything."
"Personally: A really great bitter (or British mild if you are so inclined to get technical). Brawler is an notable beer for socializing, chilling out and a great beer with tapas or hummus."
"Don't drink and review."
"This was presented with a soapy, foamy finger of light-tan head with low retention. Color was a reddish-amber with ruby highlights and a slight haze. Nose had a caramel/toffee quality. Mouthfeel was smooth with a mild bitterness on the tongue. Finish was likewise mild with only a hint of bitterness. This would be a truly eminently drinkable session beer. If you disagree, put up your dukes and we'll settle this with Queensbury Rules!"
"Nothing mind blowing but very good overall."
"Had this beer on draft at Kite and Key. Pours a turbulent orange with a miniscule head. No lacing. Half-decent biscuity aroma, punctuated with citrus and marzipan. Disturbing flowery taste, with pepper and biscuit malt. Very light mouthfeel and thin finish."
"D - Excellent session beer, glad to see a beer with body and charachter in a session category dominated by much lighter beers."
"Yards has a nice one here. There's definitely a gap in the market for a style like this, and there's gotta be some room in my fridge for a beer like this. Perhaps I'll be upgrading this single bottle to a six pack in the near future."
"Cloudy, dark amber in appearance. Grainy and caramelly nose. Taste is malty, with good sweetness from caramel and biscuit malts. Fruity yeast presence as well and slight hop bitterness felt at the end. This is a damn fine malty and flavorful beer that's ""only"" 4.2 % ABV. I may have to pick up a case after all. Drinkability is very good, its light bodied, goes down smooth and creamy with a sweet finish."
"D- 4.2% is low for a session but I think I could only do three bottles at the most. This is pretty drinkable although it's not my style."
"Almost a cola color on pour with just a bit of lacing sticking around. Aroma is almost of a light coffee, strong of malt and some toffee. Taste is pretty mild like the aroma with brown sugar, malts, a hint of fruit and toffee. Very drinkable and with the lower alc% could put a few back for sure. Not my favorite style and least fav from Yards so far."
"Medium body with low-medium carbonation. Definitely a session brew if I liked the taste more"
"i was pleasantly surprised by this one. if only 'pubs' would carry this one on draft."
"D: A nice downer that was easy and enjoyable to consume. All the rich nuttiness and maltiness of an Alt with the smooth drinkability of a mild ale. Fairly big on flavor without being a burden to consume. Worthy of a six pack and definitely one of their better brews that Ive had by them."
"D - A definite session."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Craft Ale House for around $2 (to-go). Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass and appears a hazy medium crimson/brown color with about two fingers of dense light tan foam. The nose is dominated by rich toasted grains, bread, and almost burnt toast. Tastes just as the label states - ""malt forward"". Sweet caramel malts, a touch of lemony hops, but yeah this beer is all about the malt. A soft, bitter finish that quickly fades, this ale is about medium in body but a bit over carbonated. Overall, Brawler is a nice flavorful session beer. Worth a try."
"excellent session beer from a great local brewery...like the label says ""for when you want to go a few rounds""....unlike Ricky Hatton vs Pac-Man you'll still be on your feet at the end of the night after a few of these"
"D - A truly terrific session brew... Tons of flavor and character all for a quaint 4.2% ABV.... I'm not much of a fighter, but I'll gladly go a few rounds with the Brawler any day of the week..."
"I love the name especially that it belongs to a Philadelphia company. Fits in perfectly Brawler Pugilist style ale. Awesome."
"Appears a deep ruby mahogany hue with a large fluffy light khaki head that rises well above the rim of my imperial pint glass. Scattered light lacing forms around my pint and sticks well with each sip. Aroma has a slight nutty roasted malt edge with a mildly sour twang to it, almost sourdough bread related, clean carbonation gives way as well, not much hop action going on. Low alcohol session brew malty semi sweet and roasted caramel with a nutty edge going on, lacks complexity straight forward. The tart edge confuses me, almost a brown ale quality with a mineral water edge. Mouthfeel is light bodied almost carbonated water at times, nothing cloying roasted malt leaves behind even bitterness. Drinkability overall is decent a brew that's only 4.2 that gives way to more than one brew, definitely the type of beer to drink in number."
"Poured down the center into the tulip. A deep, dark, cherry color with frothy, off-white head that dwindles to a white ring. There is some lacing, but not much. There is a strong aroma of burnt caramel and coffee beans. A faint undertone of malt. Te burnt caramel continues into the flavor. There is a malt forwardness that isn't sweet as much as it is balancing to the bitter finish. A well balanced beer that clears the palate with good carbonation. Quite drinkable warmer, but not quite as nice right out of the fridge."
"This is a good session beer that I could go for more than one round of."
"This is an odd one. I know - the word ""odd"" again. But, the mustiness really doesn't work for me here. Not ""bad", but not more than mediocre."
"D - Very drinkable! A perfect balance of flavor in a session beer. One of my favorites from Yards."
"Coming from a hophead, this beer is almost devoid of any hops, and I would still drink this all night long. Highly sessionable. I am glad that Yards is back up and brewing again."
"good for a fishing trip."
"I hope more breweries follow suit and I can't wait to get back to Yards and try another glass of Brawler."
"Drinkability: This is explicitly brewed to be a session beer, which means you should be happy to have 5 or 6 of an evening and not be falling off your seat. I think it succeeds admirably. Another characteristic of a good session beer is you find it just as or even more interesting in the 3rd of 4th pint. I haven't tested this beer that way but I suspect it would pass."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Crisp carbonation with not much of an aftertaste. Could probably drink quite a few of these."
"Pours dark cherry amber with thin head. Aroma of roasted malt. Flavor is smokey and roasted like a light porter. Little hop influence but a nice smokey, woody character, like a brown ale or porter. A little sourness on the finish. Mouthfeel is light but with a surprising cling. Mellow and drinlable."
"Just kinda dull, and the barny smell a bit of a put off."
"I must say this is not the Brawler I remember from years ago. Additionally, the flavor did not vary from the one I had on cask to the one I had from the bottle. I found it malty and sweet, too sweet. It had a biscutty aroma with no presence of hop whatsoever. I would rate this beer a ""C" at best."
"Yards Brawler has a excellent brown, almost amber, looking color, most certainly from the malted barley that was used. You can also taste the hops that were use and smell the aroma of the hops. It has a unique taste to it. It does also have a nice aftertaste to it as well."
"D - Brawler isn't bad per se, but it's also not too terribly exciting. This could benefit from a cleaner hop profile to balance its malt-forward flavor. If you like grainy, malty brews, give it a shot."
"Drinkability: superb session beer with low alcohol content. Simple beer with a nice flavor profile does not bore you."
"Overall- Sweet and malty, not bad for a mild."
"Drinkability? As the label states, yes, you could drink a few rounds of this. It's a unique ""Brown Ale Light", and worth a shot."
"I don't have a ton to add to the previous posts but I did want to agree that this is not the Brawler I remember. Additionally, the flavor varied considerable from the one I had on cask to the one I had from teh regular draft system. I found it a malty, caramel accented smooth ale when drinking from the cask but the regular draft was entirely too sweet for my taste. I would rate the cask version a B+ and the carbonated version C+."
"great session ale. the nose has a nice biscuity aroma, which matches the chewy caramel flavor you get from the body. i also got a slight butterscotch (diacetyl) flavor, which goes well with the malt forwardness of this beer. no noticeable hop aroma or bitterness, at least that i could tell. i could easily drink a few of these in one sitting. nothing that will floor you, but a good drinking ale for the long haul."
"Smooth and most importantly, drinkable, which is what I imagine Yards is going for here. I could easily go more than ""a few rounds"" with this."
"Perhaps not surprisingly, this is a rather drinkable ale with just enough character to keep it interesting into a second or third pint. And more than enough drinkability to get you there. Charming!"
"D: Super drinkable in both alcohol content and flavor, I could go through these all night (it's early yet...) In all this was a really enjoyable beer, and I'm happy to see Yards bring out a great session beer. With all of the strong beers out there this is a great change of pace!"
"A new brew from Yards which part of their mixed case. Pours with a thick head that laces nicely. Dark amber in color. Not much smell but a little malt. Tastes of smooth malt. Extremely drinkable. I would love to see this on cask. A worthy brew which would make a great session beer. Cheers."
"Welcome back Tom, its been far too long. I can stop hoarding the old stuff!! Met you back in '99 at a charity event at Reading Market through Adrian and George of the Foodery. What a beer night, you, the Troeger's and Jim from Old Lehigh (defunct). Enough soppy stuff, get back to the kettles, I'm running out of Saison!"
