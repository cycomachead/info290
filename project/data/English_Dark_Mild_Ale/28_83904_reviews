"It is highly drinkable, a very good session beer."

"O: Anchor does it again. Tough style for people to get behind but this drinks extremely well. I wish more local breweries made beers like this."
"Overall: Now drink up and enjoy. (By that I mean, I will drink up and enjoy.) Sorta seemed like a Brekle's lite."

"This pours a light amber tan with nice foaming. There’s a light malt aroma atop. Lots of caramel malt. Tastes sweet and malty. Nicely smooth and it can stand up to warming. Mild, easy-going, but not terribly exciting. I hate to say it but I don’t get what all the praise for this one (in the region, not on BA) is about."

"I wound up exteremly underwhelmed with the Zymaster Mild. I've had several milds up to now, and this is easily the worst that I've had. That's something that I thought I would never write about an Anchor product, but this was not for me."

"I would happily drink another at this moment."
"A good way to start the night. This beer was nice and smooth. I would have it again. My slight cold may have hurt or helped this rating as well."

"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is of toasted malt and grain and some slight caramel flavors. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and very easy to drink."

"Drinkability is fine. I'm not a big fan of this style, but this is well executed, smooth and clean, with a lot of flavor."

"Beer is almost holiday spicy in a way, light in body, sweet, burned sugar, nice caramel, sweetness. Overall a nice beer but it falls a little flat. The finish is mildly unpleasant with a roasty grainness that makes me not want to drink a lot of it. Low in alcohol at least but not a repeat."
