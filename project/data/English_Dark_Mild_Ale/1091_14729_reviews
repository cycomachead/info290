"The Floppin Crappie is a nice sessionable beer. The beer poured a nice amber with thin white head that is lacing nicely. There is not much scent to this beer....subtle hints of sweet malt...that is about it. The taste is a very even balanced beer....the malt provides a sweet back drop and there is enough bittering hops to balance the sweetness to make it very pleasant. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer."
"A wonderfully delicious treat that may make you flop like a crappie after your first 6pack. A delightful change to your regular beer or a viable option if you are looking for a new daily drinker. Don't be surprised if you are throwing POWs after just a couple. Definitely a thumbs up."

"Amber colored with active bubbles. Fluffy thick white foam, like snow banks. Light sweet malt nose. Nutty and bready. Light toffee malt taste, evolving hop that never takes hold. Touch sweet. Caramel close. Light carbonation, considering the bubbles. Not bad."

"M. Still seems somewhat thin but that's actually appropriate for the style this time. And for once the carbonation is actually adequate on the palate, despite the disappointing head."
"A very malt-forward brew—a whole lot going on here, with a very complex layered character that reveals something new sip after sip as it warms up. sometimes subtle beers can bring more to the table, even at a lower abv. That said, it is, is, without a doubt, sessionable."

"I like the idea of their beer-all of them are northwoodsy (like Central Waters)- but I understand the brewery is actually a brewpub with not a lot of outside distribution. Maybe if I went to the restaurant there or maybe if I tried others I could get a better appraisal."

"Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Nothing to get excited about here. Time to move on to something better."
"hahahaha wow, this is a first: a beer whose flavor and aroma are so subtle, that I can't taste them. Now, I will admit I do have some allergy/sinus problems, but until this beer this evening, I've been able to taste and smell the others. It's extra weird because I have the feeling that the tastes and smells are almost there, but not. I did let the beer warm a bit and still.... wait- just now, I tasted some malt! Hurrah! The scores I gave for taste and smell are where they are since I tasted nothing bad or out of character. And now I did pick up a little malt. Pouring aggressively gave me some off white head that quickly died down and no lace. Body is good and so is carbonation. Color is an almost clear, nice medium dark honey amber with some tiny bubble trails. Finish is, ah, very faint and so, short."
"Fleeting flavors of toasted malt, seemingly the dominant taste characteristic, which doesn't stick around too long. Again, a hint of molasses sweetness. Bare hint of maltiness in the mellow aftertaste. Feel is a bit flaccid and bland, which puts a damper on the overall impression, despite it's decent flavor, smell, and appearance. Better than the other Northwoods beers so far... a simple, clean, utilitarian amber ale with no flaws other than it's dull mouthfeel. Tailor-made for taking cans out on the lake fishing..."
"Ah, the Crack & Glug! I miss the auditory nature of my beer CANsumption when it is any other serving style. Bottles = boring! My pour created a finger of rapidly falling deep-tan head. Color was a cppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light malty sweetness underlain with a slight metallic tang. No, not from the CAN, but more likely the water they used interacting with the hops. Better living through chemistry, kids! Mouthfeel was medium with a muted caramel sweetness in the mouth. Finish was equally ho-hum, like they were afraid to let the reins out when they brewed this beer. It needed more Ooomph! I would not seek it out, but if I were in the North Woods of Wisco, I would not pass it up, either."
"O- Pretty mediocre brew but it was nice to have it again after having my fair share in college. It was a nice gift with some thought behind it from a world class BA."
"Toasted malt and mildly astringent grain up front. Mineral water bitterness comes on, before bready, vaguely caramelly malt show up. There's a husky, grainy character throughout. Not even a hint of sweetness. Grainy, bready finish, with residual mineral water bitterness. Moderate body, with a slightly fizzy feel. Better than a lot of canned macro beer, but nothing to get too excited about. Needs more complexity and ""freshness."" Oh, and some more hop presence would help too."
"This is a non-frills, basic rendition of an Amber Ale. There's nothing particularly interesting, but it has no glaring flaws, is generally tasty, and easy enough to drink."
"Cheers!"
"D- decent, the bland bitterness doesn't leave you begging for more ounces, but definitely not hard to drink by any means."
"The beer drinks well enough. It's nothing outstanding, nor is it terrible which leaves it around the average mark."
"pours out a hazy, slightly muddled dark amber colour. thin wispy head and lace. sweet sugary aroma, ghostly mint and herb like notes. rather uninspired flavours of sugary maltiness with a strange hop flavour with a hint of bitterness. if there is any wheat in here it's hard to detect. this really doesn't taste all that good. flat and syrupy mouthfeel. drinkability isn't all that good. not impressed."
"Good drinkability. Decent beer overall."
"This wasn't unpleasant to drink, but it fell flat. Lacking in the taste and mouthfeel departments."
"The mouth is crisp and but could use a bit more heft. Could be a session beer, but I would reach for something with a little bolder taste profile. I see it won a silver medal at the Sturgis Beer fest."
"D. This is an average ale a little sweet for me but it has some character."
"This is a strange one, but is somewhat drinkable for this fan of golden toasted marshmallows. Recommended for the crappie fisherman for the novelty if nothing else. There are many more interesting and beerlike options available in wisconsin's northwoods..."
"Drinkability: One of the most aptly names beers I've ever come across. Bonus points for honesty!"
"Originally reviewed April 9, 2005. On tap at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. This is like a watered down, burnt toast version of their Bumblin Bubba, yet it has even less complexity and pleasentness. Vague sweetness, hints of cheap caramel and a fleeting ghost of honey. Light off notes mark the finish. Not a real drinker."
"Makes me wonder if they had crappies in the tanks, prior to filtraton. Almost tastes like it...no, no, ...that's mean to the fish, I take it back."
"Lighter medium body, super quick and easy, not quite watery, thin overall but has a nice crispness to it; but lacks. An OK drinker to. A bit boring."
"A little darker in color than I expected, and there was a very light maltiness to it but overall it was devoid of taste and aroma...a beer for the bud light drinkers apparently....actually most of their 10-beer menu seemed to be dumbed down for cross-over drinkers...."
"Served on draft at Northwoods. Described by Northwoods as a wheat, looks more like a light amber. Malt shows a hint a caramel roast, and we start getting into more noticeable hops. A clean finish, more like a red ale. Not much in the way of wheat taste, but pretty nice. If you to try this beer, though, go to Northwoods and drink it there, don't take any bottles home, as they seem to be having trouble with their bottling."
