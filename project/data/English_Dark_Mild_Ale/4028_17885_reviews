"Malty is the word used by Neustadt that highlights this offering. And its low carbonation is a distinguishing trait. Mild, not risky, is how its taste strikes me. As a brown ale, it's worth a try."

"Decided to try one more time. Raised everything up a quarter point. It is a good beer and I will buy again."

"Overall - Not sure what the problem on why I didn't enjoy this last time, whether my tastes have changed, or whether pouring this into a glass made that much of a difference. Pretty damn good beer, but restricted to no more than a couple."

"O: This is a very malt forward beer with great flavours of caramel, molasses and dark fruits. The lack of any noticeable hops leaves this somewhat unbalanced."

"Taste starts with ample grain character, a light fruitiness in the middle, closes soft and clean. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Could be a nice regular drinker."
"Definitely a good example of a British brown."
""
"Overall, a really nice Ale. Much more complex than I thought it would be. Worth a try for sure."
""
"O - Good flavours but cloyingly sweet. Couldn't finish the pint."
"Medium body and carbonation. Not bad overall. Some unusual flavours. A little strong to be a session beer."
""

"Very easy to drink and smooth, actually almost a tad watery. Very good brown ale from Neustadt Brewery in Ontario and I'm glad we get to have this on shelves year round."
"D- Easy to drink. Nothing off-putting. But a little bland and unbalanced towards the sweet side."
"The taste is malty and coco. Smooth light tasting brown ale that is very enjoyable to drink."

"Tasty stuff, tons of great malt flavour without going overboard and winding up in 'cloying' territory. Definitely worth a shot, and something I will likely pick up again as this is one of the better brown ales I've had in the last year or so."
"Fans of Newcastle Brown, Old Speckled hen and the like will enjoy. It's not excellent, but true to the style and tasty."
"Don't think I'll ever buy it again."
"Poured a 1/2 finger with a creamy beige head - colour of motor oil - s - sweet dark malt - T - sweet dark malt, caramel, a little cloying but not unpleasant, dark fruit and peppery spice - M - decent carbonation and medium bodied, slightly bitter - O - very decent brew that was much better than I expected"
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. Good Brown Ale."
"D: Although it won its accolades in competitions back in 2004, 10W30 is still a strong, to-style English brown ale well worth trying. It isn't very sessionable, but great for a cold day. Other reviewers have already noted this, but I'll say it again: you must let it warm a bit, even just 15 minutes, to get the full flavour."
"Overall - A nice well balanced flavour and it is highly drinkable. I enjoyed it on draft more than I did from the can."
"O/D - Nice and malty. Rich and tasty. Very drinkable in the colder months, aka most of the year. A solid Ontario beer."
"Very drinkable, but low on flavour."
"Overall: I liked it but i get the feeling that in a few months i won't remember it. Not a memorable wrong but a decent shot."
"This particular can, ill-stored in an LCBO store despite a Keep Refrigerated label on the can and two days before its date turned out to be one of the best I've had because I forgot about it for half an hour."
"Dark brown with some burgundy highlights, a couple fingers of beige head with a collar of retention and a light head. Nose is mostly cocoa/milk chocolate, very creamy and 'milky'; some nuttiness as well. Taste has more nuttiness and a light roast character. Medium carbonation with a bit of a metallic taste at points. Medium length finish. Good drinkability, but not overly exciting."
"Dark brown pour with a thin wispy head. Sweet grainy aroma. Flavor is a mix of caramel, mild chocolate and maybe a faint bit of coffee. Some mild bitterness in the finish. Taste kind of lager like. Thin body. Not a bad beer, I liked it but it's just average."
"D: For all the low grades, I would have this again..."
"Light to medium-bodied with a pretty creamy mouthfeel without feeling heavy. While this lacked much aroma at the outset, this is an enjoyable quaff with provides some nice rich malty flavours while finishing on the dry side, which I prefer."
"The first time I had this I didn't like it, and strangely I'm enjoying it this time, and it's 4 months past it's best before date. I'm thinking maybe age helps it out, but it's hard to know. May pick it up again to find out."
"D - Decent brown Ale. Easy to drink."
"This all makes it a very versatile beer. It is not aggressive or potent, it just has big round and lush flavors that sooth the palate in a mellow sweet, and slightly warming manner. I would start with cheese, aiming for melty brie, smoked cheeses, old white cheddar or gouda. This beer will also fit anything roasted or anything with char marks. It may have been designed for the pub, and as such try anything fried or smoked as well. It would even do well with cheesecake or rich chocolate deserts."
"Tasty enough but kind of pedestrian."
"D - Pretty good. Not as good as a lighter variety, but the pint went down quick and I could have ordered another, but alas, I only had 1."
"D - Very easy to drink. No alcohol burn, finish not too dry, just a charmer in every way."
"Not bad, I'll probably drink it again. Went down fairly smooth, nothing offensive, but needs work to be considered one of the better Ontario brown ales."
"On tap at c'est what. Pours a mahogany brown opaque in the middle and clear maroon edges. Minimal head and lacing. Looks somewhat watery and this impression carries throughout. Faint sweet smell but not much here. Taste is watery, mild sweetness with hints of caramel but pretty basic. Slightly better as it warms. Thin feel with moderate carbonation. Goes down easily but definitely sticking to one of these."
"This may be the beer that got me into craft beer because I had it my first time at C'est What and it made me keep going back. It was a perfect stepping stone from the more flavourful macros, such as Rickard's Red, that I used to drink. This made me realize that there was something other than amber ales or Guiness if I wanted a beer with flavour. I still always have a can or two in my fridge."
"Served from an attractive 473ml Tallboy, with a freshness date stamped on it. Poured into a trusty Guinness tulip pint glass stolen from the Winters in Newtownards, NI. Moderate head which dissapates into a ring of bubbles pretty quickly. Dark mahogeny brown with a hint of red, and a good carbonation. The aroma is heavily grainy, with a little hit of yeast; it reminds me of a baker's shop. Maybe a touch of an earthy hop, but the malt is forefront in the aroma. The taste is full and grainy, barley and maybe even a bit of rye? Some dark malts to be sure. Bready and wonderful, not too sweet, still like being in a baker's shop. The hop is still a bit earthy, but acts much more as a balance to the malts, and to provide a nice clean dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a nice carbonation, but it's not over the top. I could drink this beer all night (or day, which is a more fitting description of the current time). I had forgotten just how much I like this beer."
"It's drinkable but not something I'll be buying again. I've had this on tap a few times and remembering it being quite a bit better than this. Maybe cans are not the right way to buy this one. I'd be interested in reviewing the tap version sometime, I'm positive that it's better than what I'm drinking right now."
"From a can. Pours a deep dark mahogany brown with a rich red hue. ""Clear. Thick, thin bubble cream head. Quickly dissipates, but laces down the sides to the bottom. Loads of sweet malt on the nose, roasted, chocolate, a little lactose, caramel, slight diacetyl, stewed prunes, and a little herbal licorice. Malt forward a little floral nobel hop presences. Balanced for what it should be. The flavour is of a vanilla spiked chocolate, some caramel sugars, a little astringent in it's mildly dry finish. Currents and prunes, with licorice, roast, malt sweetness and herbs. Very rich coffee spiked with honey and rich cream. A little bready from the yeast. The mouthfeel is full, grainy, creamy, full and indeed rich. The carbonation is moderate- medium, and just beautifully attenuated. Subtle dryness with a touch of residual sugars. This is a fantastic beer that does not get enough credit for what it is. A regular tap selection at my regular pub and to see it fends just as well as fresh in cans is a great thing. Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is somewhat weak, could be a bit thicker or fuller, but it is a very drinkable beer. This is a highly underrated beer IMO."
"Gotta agree with a previous reviewer - this beer could be tweeked a little to be a world class brown ale."
"Not usually a style I'm very much into, this is a pretty solid, and drinkable, representation."
"Sample on Draught at C'est What? in Toronto. Like others have stated, the name implies this will be a thick and dark beer. This is not so. Body is amber in colour, with some rouge hints in it. Head rests on the side of the glass. Aroma is malty and fruity. Taste is caramel, fruit, and a slight roasted malt. Suprisingly it is fairly mild, so it would make a good summer beer despite its name."
"M - watery but smooth and creamy to start. Dry in that lingering bitter finish."
"Medium body and fairly low carbonation makes this a pretty smooth beer. Delicious and very drinkable. This beer keeps me coming back."
"I find this to be a solid representation of the brown ale style and actually find myself, for the first time so far, thinking an Ontario brewer bottled/canned a style on par and made an enjoyable, drinkable brew that I would buy again. Nothing outlandish here but a solid English brown."
"Overall, a decent beer from Neustadt. Didn't like it as much as their scottish ale but would prefer it over their lager. Highlights were its sweetness and balance but its downfalls were its lacking, thin watery head as well as its light watery body. It's not one of those beers I'd go out and buy again but would be happy to accept another."
"Drinkability - definitely a good beer to enjoy in moderation. I don't typically assign myself to more than 2 of this style in a row because I'm cognisent of the fact that they tend to be richer."
"Final Thoughts: Another solid offering from Neustadt Springs, which I will hope to frequent again. There is of course room for improvement, (specifically in the head/carbonation department) but I would definitely have this beer again. This would be a great beer for a BBQ, for drinking at the pub or even as a session ale. Good stuff."
"This is one of those funny instances where you think you really love a beer, but then you drink it critically for a review and suddenly you realize it's not without its flaws and might not be all that you thought it was. And doesn't that just suck?"
"Mouthfeel is decent.. smooth and lightly carbonated. Drinkability is good. Having another is definitely in the cards."
"Flat cola appearance, although I can see my finger on the other side of the glass under a bright light. Tan head was fleeting. Low, steady carbonation looked good. I smelled a lot of burnt toast here, almost smoky. The taste seemed a bit uneven with a sweet molasses backdrop that didn't seem to blend well with burnt malt and mild bitterness. Mouthfeel was dry, adding to what seemed to me to be a lack of balance. The more I tasted it, the more I got a sense that there were layers of grainy malt here, most of it toasty, some of it burnt ... but all of it a bit out of synch. I'd like to try this again but on tap next time, as it was out of the can, I wasn't overly impressed."
"Drinkability: this is exactly what a brown ale should smell and taste like. Gorgeous nut aromas and flavours with plenty of sweetness. The appearance is slightly underwhelming, but with a name like 10w30, you can't say you weren't warned. A session brown ale."
"Overall a solid brown ale, but they've left room for improvement."
"Can: Poured a light dark ale with a small foamy head with minimum retention and lacing. Aroma consists of lightly roasted malt with little else noticeable. Taste is also dominated by some light roasted malt with some even lighter caramel note. I thought this was way too watery and thin to be truly interesting."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Overall a good session brown ale, good points for drinkability"
"A good beer, not your archetypical brown ale though."
"Tastes of toffee, biscuits, some bitterness but this beer is about malt (IMO)."
"I tried this beer on May 10, 2008 after purchasing from the Queen's Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto. The beer poured a slightly translucent dark brown (when held to the light) with a thin tan head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was heavily roasted malt, some sweet malt, and some grass. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy, and a little bit of carbonation. The flavour has some roasted malt flavours, some sourness, and some sweet tones."
"This beer seems to be made from malt and hop extracts rather than the genuine article. However even with that being the case the beer isn't bad at all. The brewer does a good job of making this work. Not bad, worth a try."
"Beats Newcastle easily. A decent brown."
"Pours a clear brown colour, tinged with red, and topped by a medium sized creamy white head, which leaves good lacing on the glass. The aroma is very muted, but shows signs of malt and caramel. The flavour, which is pleasant, but not outstanding, contains a mix of sweet malts, fresh berries and roasted nuts. This is ruined somewhat by the finish, which shows a harsh alcohol taste despite the standard abv. Fortunately, this became muted as the drink warmed up. The mouthfeel is fairly light, and neither boosts nor drags down the beer. I could drink another, but I probably would reach for something else first."
"D-no"
"Flavor is fairly roasty with some baker's chocolate as well. Very malt dominant no hops or abv detectable. A nice brew if you expect a mild."
"D - Overall, quite good. A nice sessionable beer if you like something with a solid flavour."
"Overall I like it, I will drink it again, and I reccommend it to any malt head."
"Notes: Special thanks to biegaman for the 12 oz. sample."
"I often enjoy English-style brown ales but rarely for reasons of distinctiveness and eccentricity; normally this is a style that is serviceable and modest and enjoyable in a simple, familiar kind of way. Neustadt, however, seems to have turned that all on its head and taken things down a road less traveled - I sure enjoyed the ride!"
"Not quite motor oil but does pours a very dark not cloudy amber brown. The head fades to lacing fairly quickly. You can pick up on some interesting malt characteristics in the smell. The bottle wasn't joking when it said ""malty grain premium dark ale"". Taste is similar to the smell. The malt is a bit sweet. There is a bit of a coffee like finish to it although its derived from the malt as the ingredients would tell you no such ingredient exists. The carbonation is fairly mild which I tend to like and I could have a few. Pretty good beer."
"Taste is very, very well-balanced. Nice, heavy mouthfeel and malty upfront, with a good bitter kick and a pleasant, not-too-strong aftertaste. No specific flavours stand out, but overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I'd definitely order it again, although I still thing Hockley Dark might have an edge on it for locally brewed English Browns."
"This beer isnt as thick as the name would have you believe, but its still a very full flavored, full bodied brown ale. Im surprised it has such low reviews, its definitely worth trying."
"I don't know why the reviews on this are so low, I think this is a good pint of beer. Pours a dark red/brown with a small head but lacing. Smells like sweet malts, some bitterness from the hops. Tastes like sweet malts with a bitter finish, but theres some chocolate malt presence in this one, a little roasty. Smooth, medium carbonated ale, I don't know why people don't like this one."
"Very creamy, not my cup of brown. Creamy head. Sharp hop bitterness in finish also good. Some sweet malt,caramel, some nuttiness. Easy drink but not special taste. Found it lager-like, my friend believes it may be the yeast. Believe C'est What nitrotapped without telling us."
"Pours a deep brown colour, with a smallish head. Faint malt aroma, slightly fruity, a little toffee/caramel. Taste was a bit disappointing. Not too strong on any flavours. Mild caramel, malt, some fruitiness. Otherwise, quite average. Moderate body, easy drinking. Not something I'd have again though."
"Overall, very disappointing. Not very many attractive characteristics and some real rough edges."
"Had this on tap at the Pacific hotel in Wiarton after a great week playing with the salmon in the bay. Tapped a dark red-brown smallish off white head reduces to a full lace. Not much in the nose departement....very subtle..light wiffs of caramel, grains light fuggles hopping. Had a medium body with nice chewy sweet malt texture fairly rich right to the finish where the citrus from the hops are evident...a very nice well balanced draft brown ale"
"Good name. Poured an very clear and flat looking amber. The nose was mild and subtle for the most part, light malts. The taste was somewhat interesting but yet bland. Only small hints of roasted malt. Some lighty woody notes and a definite fruitiness of dark plum and semi sweet pears. Overall the body was extremely light if not watery. Flavours fade quickly and leave for a below average experience."
"This beer has a great name and excellent marketing -- the tap handle looks like an oil can. With an obvious oil theme, I was expecting something with a lot more body and flavour, and was somewhat disappointed. The beer is a deep reddish brown and had a thin cream head. The aroma was quite mild, with delicate floral hops and a faint nuttiness. Nuttiness carried through into the flavour and was replaced by strong bitterness at the finish. It was surprisingly light bodied, with nothing lingering on the palate."
