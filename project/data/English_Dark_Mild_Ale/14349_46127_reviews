"Overall - An agreeable English dark mild. I found the aromas to be a promising start but fell through in the taste. Nonetheless, this has the definite ""sessionable"" quality to it but the flavours just need to be amped a tad."

"O: Very sessionable. This isn't outstanding, but there's nothing to complain about. Definitely an enjoyable beer, if not a show stopper."

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a flute glass. Pours a dark brown amber, light off-white head, some lacing. Light aroma of sweet caramel malt, nuts. A mild tasting dark ale with light toasted malt and chocolate. Finish has some nice coffee and roasted malt. Everything just a little light tasting. Pleasant, but not exceptional."

"O - Not a bad drop. A fairly smooth and well balanced beer but a little bland overall."
"Overall: an interesting English Dark Mild Ale - has some grain and fruit flavours, with a touch of bitterness. Much better than most milds I have had, however it is 5% ABV, so maybe it isn't a true-to-style mild..."

"Overall a decent brew that I'm happy to drink."

"O - Some interesting flavors but they dont really go together, and OK smell, but overall an unimpressive brown ale"

"Pours a clear dark brown with a 2 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty much only of toasty malt/grains. There is a slight onion aroma as the beer warms. Taste is of toasty/burnt malt and a slight onion/garlic flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer. As it stands, Whistler is 0 for 2 in my book with their beers."

"I don't know if this is classified right as an ""English Dark Mild Ale"". I can't really say, but it is a simple beer with a decent amount of flavor. Seems more like a smoked beer to me, but I have no clue. I have had other beers from this brewery and this is easily the best one they make."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark amber brown with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is nutty, slightly smokey, with caramel and a nice vomity note. Ugh. Fortunately that doesn't come through in the taste. Flavor is toasted caramel and bread with a whisper of smoke and a mineral water finish. Pretty thin with prickly carbonation."
"My first offering from this brewery, and I'm moderately impressed. More of a nut brown ale than the given classification, but whatever, it's an easy drinking, keep 'em comin', kind of beer. That poor mammoth could use a keg of this, or so, I would imagine!"
"Drinkability: I found this highly drinkable and was quite impressed with this beer. I'd gladly have it again."
"Final Notes: A tasty no-frills session beer that would pair well against a meal or for a night at the bar with friends. Nothing really special, but I can see myself buying it again."
"Whistler Brewing Company--Original Black Tusk Ale--2010 11.2 oz. 5.00% ABV. 10 IBU's? (2.0 / 5.0) Black Ale. Foamy thin tan thin lace head. Clear black ruby edge dark red color. Delicate roasted mild hop cocoa hint front. Fizzy thin CO2 zest dry sweet soapy thin toast roast coffee hint mild English no fruit body. Mild hop spice bitter black malt hint weak end. Dull. Sampled 6/3/2010. 6-Pack $7.49."
"Had a bottle of this back in Sept. '09. The colour was a very dark brown with no head. The aroma was quite roasty with hints of day old coffee and bits of hops. On the palate, it was thin and had some lightly roasted malt and a smidge of hops but all in all it was rather blah."
"Drinkability - the best beer I've had from this brewery, a good signature brew, worthy of several."
"Drinkability is pretty good, really slid down easily, if not the most exciting beers in the world. One of the best beers I've had from Western CA."
"Wayyy better than their export lager...regardless I'm sure they're selling truckloads right now."
"My son says a case is like $40 US bucks. Nuts!"
"Edit: Noticing my rather high deviation I went back and reviewed the BJCP guidelines for this style. As an English Brown Ale (11A), I still feel this beer hits the mark in many ways."
"one of the better beers from this brewer but that's not saying too much. worth trying but I wouldn't go looking for"
"a good dark ale, a little too watery for my liking."
"Drinkability is a bit questionable. Everything about this beer seems to be just a bit off. It might not be a bad meat tenderizer, but beyond that I doubt I'll buy this again. The bottle is probably the best part of this brew."
" Strong aroma of sweet, nutty malt, with a hint of chocolate syrup and mild English hops. Palate is mild dark malt, with a pleasantly sweet, nutty character. A bit of chocolate syrup and Some mild notes of dark fruit and just a very slight bitterness from the hops. Finish is smooth and moderately sweet. The body is creamy and smooth, but just a touch foamy. This is a nicely drinkable session ale, and of a style that I don't get to try very often. Interesting stuff."
"Perhaps this appeals to a cross-over crowd but this did nothing for me. I normally rate decent beers with a low ABV with a touch more drinkability but I simply did not want another after this one."
"Thanks Bryan!"
"Altogether I like this one, it is to me the definition of a session beer. I didn't expect to like it this much when I picked up the sixer."
