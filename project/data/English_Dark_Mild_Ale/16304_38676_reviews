"A very well crafted beer. Well done, Grand River!"
"O- Well past it's prime imo. That's my fault, not the brewery. It's been sitting in the fridge far too long."
"Deep brown, near black, light ring of off white head, good retention. Smell is malty and nutty, lightly roasted, fruity and lightly lactic. taste is roasty, light butter notes that are quite pleasant and work well, nutty, molasses, fig and some darker fruits, lightly smokey with a bitter finish and aftertaste. Light to med carbonation, light to medium feel, medium body. Quite nice sessionable and enjoyable, another solid effort from Grand River."
"Taste - light roasted malt flavour, some nuttyness, plum. Finishes moderately bitter and dry."
"Pours a dark brown with some dark red and mahogany highlights. A few fingers of tan head are formed, that's slightly creamy and moderately thick. Some lacing and moderate retention. Nose has light chocolate notes, some roast qualities, nuts, hints of caramel and dark fruits. Taste has roasty and mild coffee qualities, nuts are still mildly present themselves as well. Touch of caramel as well. Mouthfeel is a light medium, slightly watery in texture. Carbonation is medium low, and gets there only with some swirling down. Very easy to drink, I can only imagine this being more fantastic with cask treatment."
"O: A very nice, low ABV, session beer. Much more flavor than anything I have had lower than 4% so far."
"The CPJ"
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a tan head. The aroma is very malty with a lot of toffee and some caramel mixed in. The flavor is similar. I get a ton of toffee, caramel, cocoa and some nuttyness. For such a low alcohol beer, there is a lot of flavor. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
"O - I really enjoyed this one, especially considering the low ABV."
"D: For 3.5% ABV, this is an amazing accomplishment. Real flavour and truly ""sessionable""."
"Cask at The King Edward Pub in Ilderton, ON. Russet brown in colour with auburn hues and two fingers of tan head. A few spots of lacing speckle the pint glass. Smell and taste are roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, toast, chestnut, almond, table cream, pecan-like sweetness, very subtle chocolate/cocoa flavour, and a balancing hop bite on the back end with almost no bitterness. Aromas of baking yeast, mild floral hopping, and molasses develop after a while. Mouthfeel is soft, lighter than medium, low carbonation, slight spiciness toward the finish, dryly malted and lingering aftertaste. This benchmark session ale displays much more complexity than you'd expect for the weight. A winner in all formats and Grand River's best beer if you ask me. Thanks for putting this on Rich!"
"On tap at Volo. My first English dark mild ale, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this. Came out a light brown colour with off-white head. Smell is of toffee, deep roasted malt, nuts and some floral hops. Taste brings all of this together nicely with a mild bitterness. I didn't realize this was only 3.5% alcohol when I was drinking it, but it was quite flavourful. I really should have drank more than one pint and I'll order it if I see it again."
"Another great beer from one of the best breweries in Ontario with some of the worst labels on Earth."
"Overall: Definitely enjoyed this one even if it was a bit one-dimensional. Proof that you don't need a high ABV to have flavor."
"Pretty well done example of the style - carefully crafted compared to most I've tried thus far..."
"Lots of flavour, and it's great fresh."
"This brew is terrific as a flavourful session. Works well on those nights when you want the taste of a dark ale but without the weight. Still can't get over the ABV!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a quite large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of fruity ester with some light toffee malt. Taste is also dominated by light fruity ester with notes of toffee and caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation. I thought this one really packed lots of character while maintaining good balance."
"D - 500ml is a good serving size for this one. It's nice to see a low-ABV roasty brew, although this isn't in the league of other session delights like Death & Taxes. Still it's the best Grand River brew I've had so far!"
"Cheers."
"I don't usually like ""light"" beers but this was a pleasant surprize. Dark colour, light tan head, one to two fingers with minor lace and a wispy surface and ring. Smell is slightly sweet, reminds me of molasses. Fresh taste - did I mention it was bottled July 14th and purchased from the brewery? Mildly hoppy, mildly bitter, slightly sweet toasty oats, honey, molasses, brown sugar. Although tending to the sweet side, there's nothing cloying about this, it's a very nice beer overall. Body a bit thin but overall mouthfeel is sufficient to satisfy. Light carbonation but regenerates just fine with a swirl, even to the lower quarter of the glass. Low alcohol and good taste make this a terrific sessional, I'm impressed."
"Sampled fresh from a growler purchased at the Brewery on 15/01/08. Deep mahogany body sits under a billowing froth of beige foam. Excellent head retention and minute lacing throughout the drinking experience. The aroma is initially roasted barley and burnt malts. It is also quite toasty and nutty. Just a touch of vanilla extract and mineral. The flavour profile is surprisingly well rounded and full, but that just goes to show you that full flavoured beers don't have to be high in alcohol. This beer is quite full of sweet burnt malts, toasty barley, quite nutty, with a just enough of a hop presence to create a perfect balance. The finish is dry and lingering. Well done Grand River Brewing!"
"D - A very good ale w/ high quaffability. That is hard to get close to - a lot of flavor for such a small beer. A sessioner you won't hesitate to order more than one of if possible. I wish I had more Milds like this available locally. Thanks Grub!"
"Mill Race Mild is not only an incredibly well made ale belonging to an under-appreciated and near-extinct style, but it's quite simply a fantastic beer. This is one I plan to revisit again and again, and why not in sessions? To brew low-alcohol beers like this isn't easy; there is really no room for error. In my eyes, Grand River makes none."
"This is the definition of a session ale. Very drinkable, with a solid amount of flavour. Much like a light porter, and as far as im concerned that is a very good thing. Would love to knock back pint after pint of this on draft, and am jealous of those who have the opportunity to do so. Thanks to Derek i have a few more offerings from this brewery that i am really looking forward to trying after this one, its damn good stuff!"
"I'm a fan of English Ales, but I generally like them lighter...browns and reds mostly. This beer really surprised me, all in pleasant ways. I'd quite happily drink more of these, and may well find myself doing so in the future. It's good beer."
"Thinner medium body, good carbonation. It's a bit drying, as well. The low abv and good taste of this one make it almost dangerously drinkable. Thanks, Derek."
"D - Quite tasty, especially considering how ""small"" this beer is. Good session beer if you like darker ales I think, but not quite my cup of tea."
"Glad I don't live in the GTA, I'd be in trouble if this was on tap at a bar near my place. Good."
"On tap at Volo. Not as good as other milds I've had, but a fine example nonetheless, and considering their rarity in these parts its a real treat. Dark amber body with a sweet aroma. Malty flavors at the fore, with caramel, coffee and a hint of smoke. I also found a suprising fruitiness with hints of apple and figs in both the nose and flavour. Low level of bitterness. Like other people have said, this makes a great session beer."
"This is a good a reason to advocate for milds on cask as I have ever seen."
"drinkability is great. a light ale that isn't light on flavour. good balance. solid and interesting malt base. absolutely sessionable. grand river is quickly becoming a powerhouse in ontario - even brewing under 5% ABV."
"Some pleasant malty and floral aroma. Dark colour with a soapy mocha head, as expected in a cask. Easy drinking mild bitterness.A bit of coffee for balance and taste. Sessionable and worth trying, but about what you can get out of a low ABV beer. OK, but nothing outstanding. Had this again six months later at Volo on cask and was mediocre again. I had this on tap 2.5 years later at the Golden Kiwi and it was a bit more mouthfeel and appearance noticed. A milder version of a shwartzbier."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Drinkable and clean...but just too much like the so-so dark milds from F&M which I have never been partial to Sorry to break up the love-in but I was not overly impressed with this effort....even as well crafted as it was"
"An excellent offering from this brewery."
"Pours a clear reddish brown, thick off white head, not much lacing, thin collar is retained throughout the glass. Smell is grainy, cherry, mild roast and chocolate, bit of floral. Taste is caramel, grains, chocolate, light fruits, bit of caramel, touch of roast in the finish, bready, nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth, good flavour for such a low ABV beer. Nicely done!"
