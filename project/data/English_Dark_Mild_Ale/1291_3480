This is the sort of beer that both craft beer fans and those who have never tried anything fancier than Guinness Draught should be able to enjoy, or at least tolerate. I will need to try this on tap some time to see if that adjusts my perspective at all, but for now I'd say this one is worth a look.","thehyperduck","Oct 20, 2014"

3.68,9.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottles on 9/11/2013. Gusher upon opening, very high carbonation. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of toast, brown bread, light caramel, golden raisin, pear, apple, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of toast, brown bread, light caramel, golden raisin, pear, apple, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, plum, pear, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. I let the carbonation dissipate in the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice mild ale. Well balanced bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 12, 2014"

3.53,4.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,"Overall, the best thing about this beverage is its ease of drinkability, in line with its stylistic guidelines. It is certainly not the most exciting beer when it comes to flavor or aroma, as it has that dirty, dog food type of bite. Regardless, there is enough flavor and presentation to present the drinker with at least a unique style of beer. It goes down without complaint, and is nice for someone looking for an “in between” sipper that isn’t too dark, but isn’t too light. As always we’re excited to try a local brewery for the first time, and again, are super happy that this is a bizarre, underrepresented style. This won’t become a fridge favorite for us, but we will certainly look for other beers of this producer to see what they’ve got to round out their arsenal.","TheBrewo","Jan 22, 2014"

It's not that there isn't crispness, but it's barely holding on the whole way through. This is where either something's wrong or the brewer determined that lighter body meant thin and watery.

3.77,11.9,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example and a pretty true to style example of an English Dark Mild Ale, I don't have a ton of experience with this style, but this beer tastes pretty much just how I remember a good English Dark Mild Ale tasting and I think Motor City Brewing did a good job at representing the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, not filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I could see myself drinking more than a few of these, I think it's pretty sessionable and I think this would make for a good beer to pair a meal with. What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it is, it's just a good example of the style and it's just what I look for in an English Dark Mild Ale and I don't see many of those. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there nothing that I dislike or would change, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy this beer again and I'll try and I remember to pick up a six pack next time I go on a beer run. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, I think it's really accessible. All in all I was little impressed with this beer, I was a little let down with their Lager but this beer turned out to be pretty good and I'm starting to think that the English Ales are what this brewery specializes in. I think this beer is on the same level as their Nut Brown Ale. Good job guys, I enjoyed this one, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Jan 15, 2014"

The aroma was mild, some earthy malt, hint of fruit, light hopping, perhaps some chocolate far in the background. As it warmed, there were light notes of toast and nuts. Light bitterness, malt seemed a bit thin right from the start. Some sweetness, caramel mostly, and mild hop flavour, but still quite mild overall. A little buttery. Lingering dark malt bite without the fullness of flavour expected from these grains. Carbonation was on the low side, fine for the style, but the body felt watery rather than just light. A bit dry.

2.53,-24.9,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Dark brown with slight head, faint aroma, very watery as their lineup tended to be this night. Understated carbonation. Drinkable and a session ale. Taste is mostly in the malt profile, with chocolate malt and caramel. Could have been a cask ale in a blind tasting. Nothing exceptional.","Sammy","Apr 26, 2006"

2.96,-12.2,4,3,3,3,2.5,"This beer is very light brown in color. The nose is dominated by a fruity, malty profile. This medium-bodied beer starts out with a light, spicy, clean, hops bitterness, then continues on to a husky/grainy malt flavor and then ends with a slight burnt aftertaste. I'm hoping that I just got a bad bottle, because most Motor City beers are much better than this.","blackthistle","Jan 16, 2005"
4,18.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Wow...thanks to Proc for reccomending this brew. Pours out to a brown sugar color with the very slightest hint of cloudiness. Medium carbonation and a head that stood the test of time and was very well formed. Odors of nuts, barley and honey were detected, but the sweetness was not overpowering. Very refreshing mouthfeel, with overtones of malt and dough. Finishes well, with a smooth and creamy aftertaste. My buddy Proc summed it up well; this is a session beer. And a damned fine one, when a sixer is only about 7 dollars.Strongly Recommended when in the Detroit area.","Frozensoul327","Beers"

I would almost call this a brown ale instead of the English mild it declares itself. Many thanks to trbeer for sharing.","assurbanipaul","0"

My brother and I figured that the Great Lakes Invitational championship game (U of M vs. MSU) was the perfect chance to crack this one open, and we were right. Ironically, I have this one in the Levitation glass, and though it's not quite up to the Levitation standards, it's definitely a very solid session drinker, with a nice malt character (I love caramel malt!) and just the right touch of hops, and this is one I'd be glad to have again!!","beergeek279","Sep 16, 2004"

The Microbrew only being two blocks away made it easy to acquire and with a name like ghettoblaster it is hard to pass it up. The beer pours a dark with little head. The smells are subtle with a clean taste. While this is not an award winning beer it goes down very easy and does not take long to polish of a couple of pitchers with your freinds.","zodiacv1","Apr 30, 2004"

Taste has a toasty malt backbone with just a bit flavor hops peeking through. Mouthfeel is appropriate to the style. Solid beer that won't overpower or bore.","Sixpack595","Beers"
3.75,11.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer pours a hazy copper color out of the bottle with a thin head and a vaguely toasty, mostly dusty nose. The flavor is all malt with only faint hints of any hop bitterness in the finish. I get the overwhelming sense of raw grain. Very simple beer, awesome name, better effort than most macros...","stoutman","0"
