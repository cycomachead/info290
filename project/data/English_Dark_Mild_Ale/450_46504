4.19,13.9,3.75,4,4.25,5,4,"O:  relatively tame overall with everything in its place, Brawler might be the ultimate session beer ... it's full of good grain and malt flavor without getting too sweet, and it's crisp and so very easy to drink.  the malt presence does, in fact, have a good English ale feel.  several American-made amber ales come close to hitting these notes, but they don't hit as well as this one -- we need more beers like this!  4.2% ABV, loads of flavor, beautiful clarity, crisp and clean ... a brew Philadelphia and PA is lucky to have.","Premo88","Feb 15, 2015"

The aroma is light and malty despite the dark color with mild malt notes. The taste is rich and malty and the body is just light enough to hold up the flavor. A great session ale.","delta490","May 01, 2014"

It does drink like a bigger beer at times, but at the same token, doesn't have a strong enough flavor profile that would allow it to fully get away with it. So I'll hesitantly say yes, I would drink multiple pints of this at a bar. I probably wouldn't buy a 6 pack of it, but I'd love to see what cask conditioning transforms it into.","ThisWangsChung","Jan 14, 2013"

Some toffee on the sides of the mouth, generally sweet but a bit of charcoal on the back along with the right amount of hop character gives this beer impeccable balance.

Accurate smell for the style and the taste is spot on as well. It has a little bit of sweetness with some nutty characteristics (walnuts) that carry on into the aftertaste along with a moderate hop presence ...again the spice of British hops. At the tail end of the aftertaste, after the beer has warmed a bit, there's a fruity note. Below medium in body and very easy to drink.

3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Alcohol? If you're looking for it, move along. You won't taste it and you'd probably have to down a six-pack of this to feel it. This is about as easygoing as a style gets without feeling watered-down or mass-marketed. On a cool summer night like the ones we've had lately, it would be tough to find a better beer to enjoy with the windows open. Since this isn't complex by any means, just about any lover of suds owes it to him or herself to give this a shot. This can appeal to quite a large audience!","JerzDevl2000","Jul 05, 2011"

Taste is malty with a light touch of hops and some buttery notes through the finish. Light feel with a modest amount of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue.

As far as the 4.2 abv goes, yes it is easy to drink these all night but why??

3.35,-9,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Poured dark amber with a finger of white head, into a pint glass. The smell was dominated by caramel, oakiness, and wet leaves, and the taste confirmed this...especially the earthiness of oak and leaves. While this was a rare find, I was a little disappointed that the earthiness overpowered the caramel and any hop presence (which was subtle to begin with). The mouthfeel was nice and silky; a nice testament to the style. However, the earthiness was too much for me to handle past one pint.","donniecuffs","Nov 13, 2009"
4.13,12.2,3.5,3,4.5,4,5,"D - A very noteworthy session brew, great beer to kick back and relax and drink quite a few without busting your wallet, good rendition of a style seemingly forgotten by American craft breweries.","strictly4DK","Nov 04, 2009"
3.6,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Thanks to edbeer for the opportunity to try this one. Served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent chestnut with ruby red highlights when backlit. Quarter inch tan-colored skim dissipates into a thin skim; no lacing on this one. Pleasant nose - dark malts and some caramel notes; fairly subdued. Taste consistent with nose, but also reveals and earthy, coffee ground character. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a carbonation level that approaches prickly. Simple and easy drinking session beer; however, carbonation is a little too aggressive.","Jwale73","Nov 03, 2009"

I'd been looking forward to this beer as I'm a big fan of milds and other session beers, but I found this one fell prey to most common problem of lower-alcohol beers - it's boring. Even when I really let my glass warm up, the caramel flavor was flat and not all that interesting, like a watered-down brown ale. Not bad beer, but reminds me more of the ""specialty beer"" big brewers put out, like Yuengling Black and Tan, that looks good, but doesn't taste like much of anything.","tempest","Aug 17, 2009"
3.75,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Personally: A really great bitter (or British mild if you are so inclined to get technical). Brawler is an notable beer for socializing, chilling out and a great beer with tapas or hummus.","WCBCFrank","Aug 07, 2009"

Nose had a caramel/toffee quality. Mouthfeel was smooth with a mild bitterness on the tongue. Finish was likewise mild with only a hint of bitterness.

3.7,0.5,3,3,4,4,4,"Cloudy, dark amber in appearance. Grainy and caramelly nose. Taste is malty, with good sweetness from caramel and biscuit malts. Fruity yeast presence as well and slight hop bitterness felt at the end. This is a damn fine malty and flavorful beer that's ""only"" 4.2 % ABV. I may have to pick up a case after all.

Not my favorite style and least fav from Yards so far.","lonestar4lunch","Jun 26, 2009"

Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass and appears a hazy medium crimson/brown color with about two fingers of dense light tan foam. The nose is dominated by rich toasted grains, bread, and almost burnt toast. Tastes just as the label states - ""malt forward"". Sweet caramel malts, a touch of lemony hops, but yeah this beer is all about the malt. A soft, bitter finish that quickly fades, this ale is about medium in body but a bit over carbonated. Overall, Brawler is a nice flavorful session beer. Worth a try.","ClockworkOrange","May 05, 2009"

Scattered light lacing forms around my pint and sticks well with each sip. Aroma has a slight nutty roasted malt edge with a mildly sour twang to it, almost sourdough bread related, clean carbonation gives way as well, not much hop action going on. Low alcohol session brew malty semi sweet and roasted caramel with a nutty edge going on, lacks complexity straight forward. The tart edge confuses me, almost a brown ale quality with a mineral water edge. Mouthfeel is light bodied almost carbonated water at times, nothing cloying roasted malt leaves behind even bitterness. Drinkability overall is decent a brew that's only 4.2 that gives way to more than one brew, definitely the type of beer to drink in number.","WVbeergeek","Apr 05, 2009"
3.71,0.8,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Poured down the center into the tulip. A deep, dark, cherry color with frothy, off-white head that dwindles to a white ring. There is some lacing, but not much. There is a strong aroma of burnt caramel and coffee beans. A faint undertone of malt. Te burnt caramel continues into the flavor. There is a malt forwardness that isn't sweet as much as it is balancing to the bitter finish. A well balanced beer that clears the palate with good carbonation. Quite drinkable warmer, but not quite as nice right out of the fridge.","Gilgemesh","Apr 05, 2009"
