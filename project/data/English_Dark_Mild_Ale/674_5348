3.71,0.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"This one grew on me as I made my way through a can. Pleasant chocolate maltiness and dark fruit coupled with some earthy spice flavors to provide added interest. However, things might get dull if one actually tried a full session and the sweetness would probably get overbearing. Seems bulkier than your average mild.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 04, 2014"

3.87,4.9,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall- An easy drinking English Dark Mild by Nelson. The roasted characteristic to the nuttiness makes this stand out. I would of liked to see a little more to the appearance (in particular the head) otherwise, this brew is session worthy.","leaddog","Jul 15, 2012"

2.86,-22.5,4,3,2.5,3,3,"It was recommended to me by a co-worker whose daughter works at the brewery. I've tried several 6-packs of bottles over the last year but, overall, I don't particularly care for it. It seems to leave me with an oily feeling after I finish a bottle. It isn't a bad beer, but there is better out there.","maclean25","Dec 20, 2010"
3.65,-1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"An enjoyable English-style dark ale. Goes down with no problem whatsoever, but I do wonder about the 'mild' designation here - this just seems to fit right into the realm of normal, regular, plain, and what have you.","biboergosum","May 06, 2006"

3.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I had myself fairly hyped for this beer, as I think Nelson Brewing has a lot of potential, and the reviews were favourable. I don't think it quite lived up to my hopes, but it is a solid, complex beer that I don't regret picking up.","elricorico","Beers"
4.07,10.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"My ever-roving-beer-searching father brought a six-pack of these back from Revelstoke BC for me. Thanks dad. 341ml bottles, with a purple/blue label showing the brewery and the Nelson Brewing logo. The cap reads ""The Natural Choice of the Kootenays."" The beer is a lovely dark ruby colour, the borders showing some butterscotch brown. An extremely rich and appetising hue of purple mollasses, or deep chestnut ebony. The head was good at first, but then goes down to a thin bubbly layer. The sheets of lacing are still quite healthy though. The aroma is big on the sweet chocolate and even tobbaco. I love the sugary smell: unlike the salty roasted notes of a porter, this gives more raisins and french vanilla coffee. Very little detectable hopping, just as the style should be. The aroma is quite sweet but still nicely balanced with the dark malts to create a very mouth-watering nose. A lot of raisins, cream, licorice, candy sugar and even suble blueberry. There is also a little dustiness from the dark malts. Nothing overly extraordinary, just extremely well-balanced. The taste at first is the grainy malts and raisins and chocolate, along with some black coffee. The middle is a lot of near-sour chocolate malts and some charcoal dryness. By the end the malts really dominate and leave quite a bitter feeling in the mouth. The hops add a little herbaceous kick in the finish, but the malts leave most of the dryness. A sweet candy flavour, but put together very well to give a balanced and delicious flavour that makes you want to take another sip. As the website says, this is a great session beer. The carbonation is medium, and the body medium-full. I could drink these all day or night--plenty of flavour at 5% and they go down like a cold lager. This is everything it should be. Wonderful lesser-brewed style here in Canada, and a real delight to try. Wish Alberta would import it.","Cwrw","0"
3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a real nice mild edging towards a brown ale in attack. The beer pours all brown and rich with a slightly tan head. The nose is caramel and malt . The taste is all smoothness with malt to the front and a good finish. This tastes a little like a softer version of their Faceplant Winter Ale. A Great Fall beer with meats and soup.","canucklehead","Sep 23, 2003"
4.27,15.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This tastes like a powerful nut brown ale, heavier on the malts with less hops. Hints of malted chocolate, nuts and a slight sourness to it. It seems a little bit thick in the mouth, and this reminds me more of a porter our stout than something lighter. However, the excellent taste and mild ABV make this a session ale.","BDTyre","Sep 27, 2002"
2.86,-22.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"The brew poured a dark mahogany with a small brownish head that laced out quite early, smell of CO2 and sour yeast. Started crisp with lots of hop tartness, then sits lightly on the palate with an adequate malt body....then that sour yeasts taste comes in and destroys the drink. Overall a tad watery and yeasty to be an English brown.","pootz","Aug 08, 2002"
4.69,27.1,4,5,5,3.5,4.5,"It is deep brown and has a rich chocolate malt flavor- you can really taste the grains in this one. It also uses roasted barley. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light considering the flavors that come through. The hops merely balance everything nicely, they don't add much bitterness or aroma. Enjoy one at their home in Nelson B.C.; one of the prettiest towns I've ever visited, or anywhere else in British Columbia, since the government run liquor stores all have it.","MAB","Beers"
4.13,11.9,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I had to enjoy this one on a vacation to British Columbia, and enjoy it I did.  English-style mild ales are completely unavailable in my hometown, and I don't think I've ever had one on any of my other travels.  Attractive dark brown color, light carbonation, light head and little lace.  Well-balanced flavor that strongly reminded me of Theakston's Old Peculier.  Very, very drinkable.  A real find in one of those goofy government-run liquor stores.","BKotch","0"
