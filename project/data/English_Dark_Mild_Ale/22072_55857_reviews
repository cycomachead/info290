"Very pleasant and an excellent lunch beer, it's worth a pint to accompany a noonday sandwich."

"O - The mild ale revolution is seemingly always right around the corner, and if there were more like this and Two Bros. Long Haul readily available, it just might happen. It's tempting just to session this, but there are so many other interesting handles here to try..."

"this is a session nice beer. Some good tones but they are lacking some depth"
"Pours dark brown with a one-finger head. Smell is coffee, caramel, clover, tea biscuits. Taste is slightly tannic, some toffee notes, random herbage, crisp bitter finish. It's moderately carbonated (not bad for a growler over a week old), quite thin - goes down easy. This is a fine beer - wish some local brewer would make an equivalent."
"O - A nice session beer that is pretty fulfilling given the depth of flavor at 3.5%. Easy to drink, and worth trying."
"Been lookin' for a nice [true] session ale lately. This one pours a lovely clear smokey topaz/garnet topped by a finger of sandy oatmeal foam. The nose comprises light toffee, grass, flowers, and a pinch of brown sugar. The taste happily brings in more of the same, along with a bit of calcium, but in a good way (put it this way: normally, a taste of hard water does not help the beer any (generally it's a detriment), but it seems to augment things here). The body is a sorta hefty-seeming light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather fluid feel. Overall, a very nice, easy-drinkin' brew, something I can easily see myself downing over a nice, long afternoon at the brewpub."
"This beer pours a gorgeous red mahogany color clear body with a decent finger of ecru foam. The aromatics are faint in nature. There are hints of some mild fruit but with a biscuit backer. The flavors of this beer have some caramel notes with a touch of brown sugar and faint red apple. This is a solid beer. The mouthfeel is a touch bitter but only enough for you to know that there were hops put in the beer. Other than that it drinks fantastic. At 3.5% how can you lose with something this tasty. It definitely makes me wanna head on over there myself."
"Growler courtesy of Dunt on BA. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a dark clear brownish color with the slightest tinge of red. Starts with a 1-2 finger head of tan that quickly settles out to form a collar around the glass. The nose has notes of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate all pretty subtle. Some slight lace left on the glass. Medium/light mouthfeel. A very easy drinking beer with light notes of coffee, caramel, and roast. Not as flavorful as I was holing for but a nice drinker nonetheless."
"D: Very drinkable. I could throw back several pints of this pretty easily."
"Pours a fairly-dark brown color with a nice off-white to tan head with moderate retention and a nice cap as it falls. The nose brings forward a good dose of roasted malt. Also there is a bit of coffee and mild chocolate. The flavor is a bit more robust than the nose with all components being a bit more pronounced. Some mild bitterness along with the roast in the finish. Light body and really nice drinkability. Certainly a powerful session beer."
"Beer is thin in body (expected) but not dry in the finish. It has a roasty bitterness at the end that is nice because it does not approach something that is really bitter like coffee or too much hops. There is a mild lead off of sweetness at the beginning and finishes nicely as well. I seriously could drink this all day long."
" D- This beer has a lot of nice schwarztbier qualities with good roasted characters and pretty clean with no real yeast characters, but still delicious and drinks very quickly."
"D-I could probably go on drinking this one all night. Insanely drinkable and interesting enough that I want to keep drinking it."
"D - This is pretty easy drinkin'. If I were in a particularly English mood I could probably go with this one all through a good football (or even cricket) match."
"It was however one of if not the most drinkable craft beers I've ever had. Lots of flavor to be enjoyed, but easy going down, and at only 3.5% abv, not much to be afraid of upon leaving. This is what I want to see more of from American Brewers."
"simple is the name of the game"
"Very drinkable. A really solid mild ale overall. Great session beer, in any sense of the term."
"Drinkability is ok, a little too sweet for me."
"D: this beer is the definition of perfect drinkability. Bold malt profile with great balance, smooth and delicate mouthfeel, and low alcohol. This beer challenged my thought that low alcohol beers can't have robust flavors- this one most certainly has them!"
"D- drinkable as they come. that's the whole point of the style - sessionable brew. mild but delicious. not my all-time favorite of their brews, but still a damn fine one that I enjoy regularly when I want delicious beer but not tons of alcohol."
"If I have to summarize this brew in one word, I suppose it would be ""complex."" It's a very ""smoky"" beer with an excellent mix of malts. I found the scent a bit underwhelming relative to the intensity of the flavors, but this didn't negatively influence my review. I noticed that another reviewer mentioned some fruitness; I didn't notice this myself, but perhaps I'll detect it next time (you'll also recall that my pour didn't seem to have as much head as was mentioned by the previous reviewers). This is an excellent beer which you must try at least once."
"Excellent Mild Ale. Toffee and caramel flavors. Very thin body but hits the mark for the style. Huge foamy head from the cask that settles and sticks to the glass. Has a deep brown color that you'd expect from a decent brown ale/mild ale. I will drink this again and again and again."
"edit: Make sure you get a full pint, the 2nd time I had this, it was short poured with 3"" of foam."
