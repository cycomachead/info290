"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a super large dirty white head with excellent retention and some good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with some oak notes and funky ester is a weird mix that I wasn’t expecting. Taste is a mix between some tart notes with lightly sweet caramel malt with dry funky yeast notes. Body is light with perfect carbonation. Glad I’ve had the chance to try this beer but not sure it is something I would seek on a regular basis."

"O - Perhaps I miss the point, and maybe I just landed a bad bottle, but the beer I got offers very little of interest. The flavors hit none of the points I recognize and value in my beer drinking. The sour elements were perhaps the only real interest, and they were quite muted. Out front was wood, but a little oak goes a long way. It wasn't a drain pour, but it was a disappointment."
""

"Jester King's commitment to the farmhouse yeast is commendable, even if some of their attempts at mixing styles don't quite work. This one is an interesting mix with some cool flavor, but it isn't the best I've had from JK."

"Very sessionable, but why? There is nothing to recommend the flavor except, perhaps, to an oak leaf roller. What JK is doing is commendable, but this offering does not make it for my taste."

""

"O - Interesting and tasty beer. Flavors were subtle but enjoyable and beer is endlessly drinkable. I ended up knocking a few points off on it due to the flavors starting to wear on me as the bear warmed but other than that enjoyable and very different."
""
""
"Overall, a very interesting beer. I don't know if this has been infected or if it's supposed to taste like this, but I don't like the slight cherry flavor in it. It'd be good otherwise."
""
""

"O - Very light and smokey. Not much oak shows."

"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, pear, apple, raisin, chocolate, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, toffee, oak, light vanilla, herbal, floral, pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and oak notes; and great strength. Taste of big caramel, pear, apple, raisin, chocolate, toast, brown bread, toffee, nuttiness, pepper, clove, oak, light vanilla, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, chocolate, toast, brown bread, toffee, oak, light vanilla, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding robustness, complexity, and balance of malt, oak, and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is an incredible farmhouse mild ale! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of malt, yeast, and oak flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Not my cup of tea, speaking it's kinda what it tastes like. Needs some retweeking or just start a whole new beer to show everyone how farmhouse is supposed to taste. Salud!"

"D - Loaded with flavor and character, especially given the modest 3.5% ABV... The oak isn't subtle by any means and dominates the beer... It's not a bad thing, but it seems to make this offering a bit one dimensional... A tasty and interesting interruption of the session beer genre, though I'm not sure it's something I would revisit with regularity..."

"B-"
"It doesn't work for me. Tastes and feels lager-like, with the exception of the carbonation, nothing jumps at me."

"Overall: An interesting brew for sure. Extremely light body, and while the flavors are all fairly light, it has a pretty complex flavor profile. Plenty of woodiness and nuttiness along with some mild funk. Interesting, but not quite to my tastes - the tobacco/woody elements were not altogether pleasant for me. Not bad though."
""
""
"3.0 D: It's okay, but it's boring, even for a session beer."
""
""
"Overall - Jester King has a knack for it and while this one isn't perfect, it is still a good brew. Milds are best enjoyed fresh off the tap, if I'm ever in the area I'll have to stop by and try it again."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip-like glass, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with an inch and a half light tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready and caramel malt, chocolate, oak, dark fruit (cherries), and some spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some nuts, vanilla and dark bread. Also, the chocolate is stronger in the taste than it is compared to the aroma. I thought the taste of this brew got better the longer it warmed up. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's easy to drink and is well carbonated. This is the 2nd Jester King brew I've tried, and I've liked them both so far. I'd like to try this one again in the future. $7.99 a bottle."

"This is a weird beer. But I like it. The oak is very interesting. And there is a lot of flavor in this beer, especially considering how mild it is. Definitely worth a try."
"Not the most interesting beer out there, but it's novel and tasty for what it is. Light and easy drinking but carries enough flavor to keep me sipping. A good, if not great bottle."

"o - lots going on here for a 3.5% beer. really nice one."
"Taste is woody and winey and a bit of smoke and some strange phenols from the yeast but its not off putting in any way. A little thin but that was to be expected. Nice session beer that I'm glad I bought. Leaves you thinking but gives you room to move around and drink the whole bottle. Valient effort. Don't understand the low scores("

"Poured out as a murky brown color with a light tan head on top. The retention is and lacing on this beer were impressive and long lasting. The smell gives off earthy toasted malt aromas as well as some subtle oak in there as well. The taste is malty and dry, slightly bitter but a bit one dimensional. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, good level of carbonation but very dry. Overall it's a decent beer but nothing I'd seek out again."
""
"Overall meh, nothing really special, I like that they tried something new but this doesn't go far, malts are meh, hops are even more meh, yeast could be nice if it brought more flavor other than the yeasty flavor, and oak just overpowers everything to the point where all you really get is oak and light sour candy malts."
""

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some roasted nut aromas. Taste is much the same with nutty flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is flavorful and easy to drink for the ABV."
"Served from bottle into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Poured a massively dark brown with a two finger light tan head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, fruit, wood, and subtle spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, fruit, spice, dark chocolate, and subtle wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was apretty decent brew. I went into this one truthfully expecting to find something awesome in this one. What I found however didn't really jump out at me like I would have hoped. There was a nice bit of things going on in this one which was nice to find. Really wish there would have been a bit of dark fruit going on in this one to balance it out some. But hey, you can't win them all. Definitely worth your time if you get the chance."

"D - Nice oaked mild. Great overall balance with a different mix of flavors."
"O - A great cross between an English ale & a farmhouse ale."
"O: An OK beer, but nothing particularly special. Not undrinkable, but not awful either."

"O – This is a nice English mild. All of the right aromas and flavors are there, and the mouthfeel is spot on for a sessionable mild. I don’t really get the low score here. Does it have as much flavor as a DIPA or sour or pack as much of a punch as a barleywine or RIS? Of course not. Is it supposed to? Absolutely not. This beer is meant to be mild (it’s in the name after all) and to be drunk in large quantities without putting you on your ass. This beer fulfills both of those requirements and is tasty at that. Nice beer from Jester King."
""
"O: Overall I am glad that I picked this up. It is not one that I would seek out again, but glad I had the chance to try another beer from Jester King. I never know what to expect when I pop open one of their beers, and that always has me excited."

"After a very surprising beer in RU-55, I follow it up with this. I remember loving this beer when it was not ""farmhouse."" The original version was great, especially on cask. This is a thin, unappealing beer that has no business in the English mild or farmhouse styles. A complete mess."

"deep amber in color, finger of head with nice retention. smells of funky yeast, chocolate, raisins, oak. the flavor is nutty with hints of oak, vanilla.. a very mild tasting ale. high carbonation, light in body, slightly tart. excellent sessionable ale with a creamy mouthfeel.. very flavorful."
""
""
"O - Its a replacement for water. Not suggesting this is anything close to BMC. Most likely won't ever purchase again. $8 smoked water? na...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - The base beer seems like a great mild but the oak becomes overpowering as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oddly compelling in taste and texture, the beer leaves much left to be wanted in a single drinking session, but paired with herb-infused sausages and a slight marmalade glaze would set the ale off nicely! It just begs for the dinner table."
""
""
"O - This is a delishious session... It really grew on me the more I drank it. I'm glad we occasionally get jester king brews brought to us."
""
""
""
"I’m going to vote for this to be in 6 packs in the future."
""
"O: This is one of the best of JK's regular line up so far. It packs in a lot of complexity for a low-abv beer. Given its price, it makes for an excellent semi-regular treat throughout the year. Highly sessionable, but with so much complexity, makes this beer drinkable year-round and any day of the week."
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint/tulip glass, Oaked farmhouse version, no bottle date. This pours a dark brown, mahoganyish color with a three finger tan head which quickly loses half its size then remains as a a thin film. The smells are of a very strong malty type, a little nuttiness, caramel, a little oak but not as prominent as the others. The feel is surprising thicker than I was expecting, mid to thick. The taste is pretty good, full flavored for a 3.5% abv beer, the taste is like the smell a little nutty flavor, loads of malts, caramel and a hint of vanilla."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, the first sour I ever had was a sour version of this beer, I loved it and I like this version almost as much. Great beer, I typically dont love non sour jester king beers but this one is great! I would certainly buy more, especially at this price point. Very drinkable..."
""
""
"M: It's light leading to medium. Heavily carbonated. Very easy drinking."
""
""

"I love seeing beers that show how flavor can be imparted w/out increasing the ABV tenfold. Thanks brad."
""

"O - The skill that reveals itself in pretty much every aspect of enjoying this beer proves that Jeff Stuffings' is a master of the craft; an artist delving into new grounds. Although Milds are not my favorite, I can honestly say that this recipe would rank at the top of those seeking such a sessionable beer. Bravo."
""
""
"O: This reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada Tumbler. It is pretty tasty and is easy to drink. This makes for a perfect low alcohol beer for the winter."
""
"Light bodied, completely to style in this case, with plenty of lasting oak flavors. Subtlety is the name of the game. Dry and woody, flavorful with some flashes of green hop traces but minimal bitterness. Very smooth and refined. A very unique rendition of a Mild Ale, and something I wish was on cask locally. Hope someone out there can pull strings to make it happen!"

"This pours a dark ruby-brown with thin bubbles and an apparent low carbonation. Great aroma, very tart and bold, with an obvious comparison to balsamic vinegar that doesn’t do it justice. Tastes mouthpuckeringly tart, like sour cherries or blackberries, and just incredibly so. More tartness than a hoppy bitterness, which is in its own way refreshing. The souring process brought something to this beer which made it distinctive and in a class all its own. This is wonderful! I loved every sip and wish I could have had more."
