Flavor is up front pale malts with a smack of the dark malts thrown in the mix (toast and chocolate). Hop presence is very subdued. Finishes with an interesting tartness, but way too much jelly in the finish. Jelly kills it. Is this made by Saint Arnold??? Mouthfeel could be fuller and with more subdued carb. Overall, this can be pounded at this abv, but it's lacking finesse all around. Too much jelly flavor. Weird.","goochpunch","0"
