3.76,-0.8,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Dark woody brown color, deep to the point of being nearly opaque, capped off with a small tan head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. Light aroma, nutty, sweet bready malts, mild earthy hops. Taste was about spot-on for the style, slightly roasty malts, nutty, pumpernickel, grassy and earthy hoppiness, for a gentle, woody bitterness. Medium body, simple, quite drinkable, and very sessionable [to use a cliche expression for a lower ABV beer]. Perhaps not the most popular style of beer, but I do get in the mood for a good dark mild every once in a while, so this was nice.","Rifugium","Dec 10, 2012"

3.58,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This brew poured a deep mahogany brown with red hues where the light passed through, very little head on this mostly due to the pour, what did remain was on the yellow side of off-white. The nose on this one was pretty roasty, notes of caramel, chocolate, and a bit of earthiness. Up front I get those sweet malty flavors, chocolate and a little fruit I canâ€™t put my finger on. There are some earthy notes followed up by a bit of grassy hop. The body is fairly light and the carbonation sits on the high side making this brew very drinkable. Overall a nice drinkable beer, but nothing to wright home about.","hdelavega","Jan 02, 2012"

3.98,5,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"O: For what it is, I am extremely impressed. Can not say I have a lot of experience with English Dark Mild Ales, but I can say El Lector has welcomed me to the style:)","One2Remeber","Aug 19, 2011"

3.68,-2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"rich looking medium brown with a mild cloudiness about it. Rich color here with a nice head of off white which hung around for a few moments before settling down into a thin film. The aroma was light, medium fruit notes, apricot maybe with a hint of some light spice and tons of grain. More of the same on the taste as I run through on this one. The flavor was a bit lacking for me. Nice malt profile with a light ouch of fruit and spice, but not nearly strong enough of a profile to really get me to enjoy it. Smooth, mellow carbonation and a low abv made it nice and and drinkabl","mikesgroove","Jun 11, 2011"

3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. Served in a pint glass, the beer poured a dark brown that is slightly translucent, with a thin layer of off-white head. Aromas of light nut sweetness that avoid being overpowering. The beer has flavors that are sweet nut/hazelnut and smokey/tobacco to balance. The beer is crisp and smooth in mouth, with some slight creamy textures. The aftertaste is creamy and light hazelnut, surprisingly like a Nutella spread. Creamy finish, too!","GarthDanielson","Apr 11, 2011"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at the CCB tasting room. Clear red brown with two finger cream colored head. Web of lace down the glass. Smell: mild roast, caramelized sugar, a little black plum, mild earthy + green hopping, powdery chocolate note. Taste: mild roast, grape skin, dry plum. A bit grainy, tannins (? but it fits). Medium body, creamy feel. Dry finish. Good punch of flavor at the abv level. Tasty enough to take home a growler.","babaracas","Beers"
4.36,15,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D-well its a mild, if it wasn't drinkable, it wouldn't be a good mild. this is beyond drinkable. this is great. i really want the craft movement to catch on to this style, and i really want CCB to start mass producing and bottling this one. there are so many possibilities. i could have many of these in a sitting. So much complexity in such a little ABV!","AdamBear","0"
4.13,9,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"drinkability: what a great session ale. I don;t have a in this style to compare to but I enjoyed it. Looking for more in the full flavor session category.","CampusCrew","Mar 04, 2011"

3.67,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Cigar City smokes NYC at Rattle N Hum. Hops in aroma, I was expecting more roast to be bang on the style. Carbonation comes through more aggressively. A good drinker, sessionable as I can have this and head back to whatever I was doing. An average beer overall however. Dark colour without noticeable head.","Sammy","Feb 24, 2011"
3.95,4.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D and overall impression: Drinkability is dangerously high. Only 4% ABV, with tons of flavor packed in. Overall, this is pretty good for the style, full flavor and low alcohol. Very nice. Skal.","Gtreid","Jan 02, 2011"
