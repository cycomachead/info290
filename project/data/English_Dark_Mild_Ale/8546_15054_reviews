"Drinkable but rather average. It looks superb with a towering head, however it's all downhill from there. The aroma and flavour are dull and lacklustre, with weak malt character and little else going on. Body is OK but not amazing. If a mild is judged by it's maltiness then this one is below par. Goes down easily enough but nothing special - no need to seek it out."

"A solid effort from Thwaites, the flavours were enjoyable but a little subdued and didn't really grab your attention. The mouthfeel was good however and the alcohol content was just right making it an easy beer to drink."
"All in all, not bad."

"O. A Dark beer that is probably for people who are looking to get into this type of stout/dark beer style, defiantly not for the connoisseur. Very underwhelming"
"Thin and light even by mild standards. It does hold a few surprises, though, especially the dose of roast, which snuffs any fruit. Not sure I get the Fuggles-EKG combo at full strength. On the whole, I'd prefer Very Nutty."

"Nice dark ruby (edging into black) body with a thin but dense tan head. The scent is of mellow roasted malts, pleasant fruity hops, and light sugar. Sweet, brown sugar-y malts in the taste. Low hops in the taste, and a creamy, light chocolate taste. Smooth, but light body. Low, but still noticeable carbonation. Pleasant taste, and a low ABV makes this a nice session beer."
"Pours deep brown with tan smooth head, weak smell of roasted malt, taste is like a kvass, watery and unexpressive, tones of roasted malt and tints of chocolate, almost no mouthfeel, very light & drinkable. My first mild and I'm in doubt of this."
"M&D: very soft on the carbonation with a good input of microscopic fizz, this mild drinks better than on the nose, refreshing but not thin by any means. Well worth a try when the cask is still fresh enough."
"High drinkability. Would definitely drink again. Nice ABV and price as well."
"My first beer from Thwaites and i have to say i'm not that impressed. It started quite well the apperence is a very dark brown but all the rest of the isn't impressive, not a lot of flavour going on and the beer is quite watery and i wouldn' buy this when there's better Milds out there."
"D - If you want a malty beer with a low ABV% then this is pretty good. Some chocolate malt flavours would make it a bit more interesting. Good session beer none the less."
