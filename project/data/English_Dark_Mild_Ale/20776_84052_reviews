"Taste is very bitter, similar to black IPA, nuts and coffee, mild and dry finish. Light body, good carbonation. Excellent and unexpectedly interesting representative of mild ales."

"This is a highly sessionable beer with enough character to enjoy on its own, yet reserved enough to allow long conversations and light food to take center stage."
"(O)- A rather nice beer. Not a huge mainstream style (in fact, my first venture into it), but quite appreciated to have versus the tried and true styles produced today."

"O: This beer very easy to drink given its light body and low alcohol content while also being quite flavorful that it reminds me of a ""light"" version of a good porter."
""
"Overall: this is a definitely drinkable and tasty mild. I love dark milds for their quaffability, and this one has a good complexity for such good drinkability."
"Poured into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Pours a dark reddish brown amber with a half finger off-white head that dissipates to a thin film with light lacing. Aroma of dark malt syrup, lightly nutty with a faint dimethyl sulfide component. Flavor is mild toasted and biscuit malt, grains, hints of coffee and chocolate. Finishes with toasted and charred malt, mild hop bitterness. Light bodied. Although the flavors are mild, they are reminiscent of a low key porter. Fairly complex balance of malt flavors with hints of smoke or peat. Although light in flavor, suprprisingly flavorful for such a mild ale. This is my second Celt Experience ale and I'm impressed. An interesting take on the dark mild ale style."

"The taste starts out on the sweet side but then the coffee grinds kick in with a low bitterness tying it all together at the end. This has the bold character of something bigger than a 4% ABV beer."

"Sometimes you've just gotta dive in and try something completely new to you. Enter: Celt Experience's Dark Age. Get some. It pours a clear sienna-ruby topped by nearly two fingers of light tan foam. The nose comprises walnut, oak, light earthy hops, greens, and a touch of brown sugar-cinnamon in the air. The taste holds notes of brown sugar-infused toffee, light tea, walnut, light oak, a very light tinge of mild vanilla bean, and a light scattering of earthy greens. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smoothly slick feel. Overall, a nice dark mild, one that goes down easily and pleasantly. Good times."
