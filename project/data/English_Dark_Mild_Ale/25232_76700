3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap at the Bearden Beer Garden in Knoxville, TN. Pours very murky and almost a purplish brown color. I am not sure what style this is supposed to be but it seems like a mix of several. There was a definite Belgian character to this whether it was the yeast or maybe some candi sugar or something. Tasted pretty good overall. Aroma were slightly sweet and Belgian like with some cloviness. Flavors were pretty tight as well. A definite change of pace and a decent beer.","SaCkErZ9","Dec 26, 2011"

4.02,10.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, one of my favorite CalfKillers so far- easy-going and very sessionable. Without a doubt, these guys are the best up-and-coming brewery in mid-TN. Their best brews seem to have that chewy, creamy nougaty malt up front, while closing dry and crisp with a very bran/flaky-dry maltiness. Bars serving CalfKiller now define where I drink in Nashville.","TheWhiskerReview","0"
