Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, pear, apple, raisin, chocolate, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, toffee, oak, light vanilla, herbal, floral, pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and oak notes; and great strength. Taste of big caramel, pear, apple, raisin, chocolate, toast, brown bread, toffee, nuttiness, pepper, clove, oak, light vanilla, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, chocolate, toast, brown bread, toffee, oak, light vanilla, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding robustness, complexity, and balance of malt, oak, and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is an incredible farmhouse mild ale! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of malt, yeast, and oak flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 13, 2013"

3.99,13.4,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip-like glass, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with an inch and a half light tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready and caramel malt, chocolate, oak, dark fruit (cherries), and some spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some nuts, vanilla and dark bread. Also, the chocolate is stronger in the taste than it is compared to the aroma. I thought the taste of this brew got better the longer it warmed up. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's easy to drink and is well carbonated. This is the 2nd Jester King brew I've tried, and I've liked them both so far. I'd like to try this one again in the future. $7.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jun 12, 2013"

The smell gives off earthy toasted malt aromas as well as some subtle oak in there as well. The taste is malty and dry, slightly bitter but a bit one dimensional. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, good level of carbonation but very dry. Overall it's a decent beer but nothing I'd seek out again.","Knapp85","Apr 28, 2013"

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some roasted nut aromas. Taste is much the same with nutty flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is flavorful and easy to drink for the ABV.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 24, 2013"
3.67,4.3,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Served from bottle into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Poured a massively dark brown with a two finger light tan head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, fruit, wood, and subtle spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, fruit, spice, dark chocolate, and subtle wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was apretty decent brew. I went into this one truthfully expecting to find something awesome in this one. What I found however didn't really jump out at me like I would have hoped. There was a nice bit of things going on in this one which was nice to find. Really wish there would have been a bit of dark fruit going on in this one to balance it out some. But hey, you can't win them all. Definitely worth your time if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Mar 23, 2013"

I don’t really get the low score here. Does it have as much flavor as a DIPA or sour or pack as much of a punch as a barleywine or RIS? Of course not. Is it supposed to? Absolutely not. This beer is meant to be mild (it’s in the name after all) and to be drunk in large quantities without putting you on your ass. This beer fulfills both of those requirements and is tasty at that.

This pours a dark brown, mahoganyish color with a three finger tan head which quickly loses half its size then remains as a a thin film. The smells are of a very strong malty type, a little nuttiness, caramel, a little oak but not as prominent as the others. The feel is surprising thicker than I was expecting, mid to thick.
