"12/05/12 On tap at   Rattle n Hum, NYC. Lacks body & depth of flavor. Not bad, but not good either."

"This is the third beer I've tried from these guys. Aptly named, a nice flavorful beer that isn't too heavy for the holidays (read: afternoon football drinking). Not a ton of booze, which helps. Can definitely taste the toffee and rye notes. Tastes are reflected in the nose, but again, not too strong. Decent stuff."

"Overall an enjoyable beer. The notes of caramel and toffee and very well suited to the style."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Mild Winter is a deep amber-brown color with a thin, cream colored head. The nose is sweet with amber malt, burnt chocolate and caramel. The flavor reflects the nose nicely with the roasty characters coming to the forefront, coffee and burnt chocolate but in a mild, non-acrid way. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with a light yet creamy carbonation. Overall, a solid beer by GI, I could definitely drink this one curled up next to a fire on a cold winter's night."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid poundable beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for a style."

"Overall: An American attempt at an English bitter and I think Goose Island has done quite well. Hard to classify this one, but it is a tasty beer for those who favor the English-style ales. One I'll certainly look for again. And for the record, it still holds up well when consumed after six months!"
"O: I really enjoy this beer; one of my favorites in the later winter months"
""
"Mild Ale, 168 Calories, 5.6% ABV. I have come to realize that I do not like the Ale Style. In my opinion the aftertaste is way too bitter. I've had IPA before that I did not mind but only if it has a unique flavor, i.e. coffee...etc. This is advertised as mild which was very strong despite the label in my opinion. Would not try again or recommend unless that is your preference. I didn't really sense the taste of the caramel advertised in the description."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy, beige head. The aroma is very malty with some spices. The taste is pretty good as it’s not too strong or too weak. It’s slightly sweet with malts and caramel as well brown sugar. It has a little bit of a robust taste as well. This makes for a pretty good winter brew!"
""
""
"Very well balanced beer. Good malt character, and the rye counters the caramel malt sweetness nicely. Fruitiness adds a nice complexity."
"this is a lot better than I thought it would be! it pours a darker copper color, pushing brown but just barley maintaining its red tint. its got a luscious off white head several inches tall and holding on pretty well. the nose is the English malt and caramel sweetness I expected, not really convincing me this is anything special. some dryness rather than sweetness though, and my palate always leans that way, so I take a sip. the first thing I notice is how mellow the sweetness factor is. I am allowed to taste the rich English malt, but I don't have to deal with its usual residual sugars. there is also a mild bittering hop finish that gives some nice balance. im not sure what the yeast is, but it almost comes across like a lager, finishing crisp and super clean for a beer of this malt persuasion. good carbonation, soft like a cask, and not filling at all. I could session this big time. overall an impressive regular beer from goose island, usually their sixpack stuff comes up short for me, but I thought this was an excellent cold weather brew, and one I will stock the fridge with come fall."

"Body is not thin at all....just real approachable....carbonation is good...a real treat from an underrepresented style."
""
"Price Point - $4.99/6 pk 12 oz bottles"
"D - A solid winter seasonal that I will likely invest in next year... Enjoyable and sessionable without being overpowering and too boozy like a lot of winter brews... An outstanding American interpretation of an under produced English style... A nice job by Goose Island..."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark red with a nice fluffy off white head. Smells of dark roasted malt with slight syrupy notes, nice combination. Tastes of dark malt and wheat body, very malty, but quite balanced with spiciness and slight chocolate or coffee notes, and a tiny bit of hop bite. Beer is carbonated correctly, and although it is of medium body, this is definitely sessionable. Overall, a very good beer."

"O- Great beer. Stylistically in check, and for my taste, it's a winter-time session beer for sure. I would buy a case of this to keep on hand any winter. I'm giving it a 4.5 overall only because I haven't tried any other breweries examples of this style."
""
"This is certainly better in mar. then oct. a little time to let winter settle in I guess. Pours a solid amber with crisp white head. A hint of carmel apples on the nose. Green apples, black tea and a smooth finish. I could drink a couple of these. Prost!"
""
""
"O: Overall moderate, mild complexity, mildly amusing and mild drinkability. Decent alcohol warmth but nothing that holds and keeps your interest."
""
""
""
""
"Whiff off toffee and toasted barley. Copper with a decent head. The taste reminds me of the buckwheat tea (mugicha) that I used to drink in Japan. Nice toasted malt flavor, balanced out by toffee giving it a slightly sweet finish. Medium light bodied. This was my standard beer this winter when watching football games at the local bar. Good winter time beer of which you can have more than one."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a fairly middle-of-the-road effort. Perhaps my bottle was a touch over the hill, but I could have used a little more intensity from the malts and some more spices from a beer touted as a winter seasonal. On the positive side, this might be a good brew if you have palate fatigue or are trying to introduce somebody to craft."
""
""
""
""
"damn! this is tasty, tasty beer! ABV seems a bit high for the style but wow this goes down easy and then some! Another fantastic beer from Goose Island!"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 10/24/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, raisin, fig, apple, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, light rye spiciness, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, fig, apple, toffee, dark bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light rye spiciness, and floral earthiness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, light fruits, toffee, dark bread, light rye spiciness, and floral on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; with hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice dark mild ale. Good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"Definitely an interesting beer, but the breadiness up front dampened my enthusiasm a fair amount; I had a very bad experience with Fat Tire many years ago in Seattle, & it's scarred me for life. Close, but no trip up the red carpet: this one's good."
""
""
"Conclusion: I have only had two American bottled versions of this style (most of the examples of this style have been on cask in England) and this one is the winner hands down. Not up to par the real stuff on cask, but a great bottled offering. Now if they could make it bottle conditioned and tone down the carbonation, this would be even better!"
""
"Overall, I am presently surprised by this beer. I've been passing this up quite often and find myself regretting it now. A pretty darn tasty malty beer that's easy drinking and affordable. Go out and try it."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a strong seasonal to revisit"
""

"Looked great! Poured a brilliant, mahogany brown and produced a creamy, 1.5 inch tan head, that slowly subsided. Some decent malt in the nose and suggestions of hops. Faint hints of cocoa and spice? Medium-light body. Surprisingly short! Some lingering bitter notes. Not much malt on the palate. Light, fresh, and mild. Not as dark as expected. Some lace develops. When looking for a Mild Ale, I will look elsewhere next time."

"O - Great! I really liked this one and would recommend this to anyone when the weather is cold."
"This is a rather simplistic beer. It has decent flavor with a very malty presence. This is a beer brewed to style with caramel and toffee notes and lower, sessionable ABV. This beer has enough flavor to keep one interested throughout a session, but there isn't much here to set it apart from the rest of the crowd. I'm glad I tried this one once, but I won't be seeking it out again."

"12 oz bottle. Pours brown with medium lasting, off-white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of bready, toasted malt and spicy, grassy hops. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is toasted malt, spicy rye, herbal, grassy hops and hints of coffee. Finish is long and dry. Tangy, spicy, not bad brew."
""
""
""
"I really like rye beers and this one is great for the very reason I enjoy them, you can taste the rye malt in this, it has a mild toasted flavor with subtle sweet and mild nutty earthiness there is a light herbal hoppiness which is just enough to keep it all balanced, a very flavoral, yet not overdone beer. I really can't imagine many ways to improve upon this except maybe more of the same I really thought this is a great winter beer and would certainly order this any time it is available."

"Overall not a bad take on a mild English winter warmer but not something I would run out and get again. Try it if you love ESB's."
""
"Clear dark brown with a small off white head with fair retention and lacing. Smells and tastes like caramel, bread, and toasted malt. Has some spice and light bitterness. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Not much aftertaste. A decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall ok but not great. Malts are quite nice, but the hops are not as much so. Too much overall on hops especially the herbal flavors for a mild, even an English mild. But still fairly tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Brown on color with reddish hues and perfect clarity. Poured with a thick, dense off white foam that reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy, grainy aromas with dark malt, toasted malt and dark ripe fruit. Medium and bodied and buttery smooth below the assertive, tangy carbonation. Dark roasted and toasted malt up front, tangy through the middle followed by floral hop flavors. Earthy toasted grain and bready flavors at the end with a dark roasted malt and lightly bitter finish. Finished crisp and semi-dry."
""
"O/D-Not as drinkable as I thought it would be but it was far more flavorful than I expected as well. Well worth a try. I'd actually try it again in a different setting with a bit more time to dissect this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess Chicago hopes for a Mild Winter but in Muncie I love a snowy winter, so mild seems less then optimal for me.,of course it now says brewed in Baldwinsville NY. Pours a really thick head that takes a long time to dissipate. A very rich dark caramel color is what you see. Looks great in my Beatles Rubber Soul glass too. Actually probably darker then caramel but not a chocolate color. Smells great, malty and something like nutmeg, or at least nutty, in a good way. Malty taste, maybe a hint of chocolate, caramel, etc. I can't really discern a whole lot, but it taste good. Very hearty feel, and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: A nice easy winter drinker, void of any spice rack or dark roasted malts. Certainly mild in both smell and taste, but that's how it's supposed to be. A little higher in abv than the style calls for, but it is brewed in America after all"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the first English Dark Mild Ale I've had, so I had no expectations going in. This beer was a pleasant surprise. It's easy to drink and understated, but definitely drinkable."
""
"It isn't too bad if there is nothing else on tap."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing remarkable, but a good option if you're looking for something mild."
"C"

"O: A supremely easy drinking brew with good flavors. Not one I'll run back to get but if there were a bunch a a party I wouldn't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brown ale with some red accents. Occassional foam as I agitate is light tan. Nose is spicy and malty. There are hints of cinnamon and some earthy hops, but mostly a simple bready nose. Taste carries a nice brown ale character accented with a rye ambience. Nicely spicy with a tone of brown ale - not mild ale. Medium bodied with a lighter carb and a nice forgettable finish. This beer is nothing out of the ordinary - which is exactly as it should be. Well executed."
""
"This brew was a waste of time and a waste of $1.70, good thing I only bought a single... Not recommended."
""
"O: A straightforward winter beer from GI that you can drink multiple of in an evening."
""
""
""
"Overall this was quite a dissapointment for me. I love solid brown ales, winter ales, rye ales, as long as they have a quality flavor profile. This one however does not and really misses the mark because of the hollow malt backbone and weak mouthfeel. The finish just lingers in an unpleasant way for me."
""
""
""
"Just a hint of alcohol in the midst of everything and even though this wasn't a session beer, it would be easy to have a few of these in a sitting. Nothing stood out with this but nothing was offensive either and once in a while, it's good to have a beer like this for the transition from fall to winter. It tasted just slightly burnt without leaving any type of burning sensation, putting the ""mild"" into this Mild Ale."
"O - You can pass on this one."
""
"I tend to like beers like this. Good flavor, but not too heavy or to high of an ABV."
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty good dark mild ale. As expected, super malty, and a little spice in the taste. Would have it again, especially at a bar with not a ton of craft options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Overall this brew delivers on the description: it is a nice winter brew and truly mild. I just wish it was more robust as it just falls a little flat for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A sessionable winter offering that provides a good amount of flavor at a reasonable abv. Somewhere between a brown ale and winter warmer."
""
""
""
"Overall this is too bitter and way too strong to be anything but an ""English inspired"" Mild. Among my least favorite alleged Milds. From the 12 oz bottle."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-good easy to drink beer while not spectacular very solid"
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Grey head, moderate retention on a ruby/mahogany body. Aroma includes caramel malt with some light roast, some raisins, a hint of coffee and some candi sugar. Taste includes light coffee, some fig and some candy sugar sweetness. Very easy to drink, no objectionable flavors and should be appealing to most people."
""
"Overall - A decent beer here. Nothing incredibly special, but it does the trick."
""
""
""
"Mild malt sweetness and a tad too much bitterness throughout. Good though slightly underwhelming."
""
"Would I buy it again? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is too carbonated for an English beer style, but it doesn't detract from the beer. It makes this beer even more of a versatile pair with burgers or a rich risotto. Overall I like this beer, I'd be happy to down a pint or three at my neighborhood bar."
""
""
""
""
"A good winter drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Good English ale with a cold weather twist. An ambitious seasonal worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink a few of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I don't think this is the best beer I've ever had -- but it's familiar, it's comforting, and it ...I mean, can I say this? It makes me happy. It's like an old friend. So for me it's a great beer -- even if it's not necessarily anything special."
""
""
""
"I like it. This is NOT a mild by any stretch of the imagination; I have no idea who would label it as such. The carbonation is far too high and the flavor is more of a well-hopped brown ale with rye. It's not a bad beer by any means. Actually, I'm disappointed I only picked up one in a mixed six-pack; it would be an excellent session beer for a cold Minnesota fall night like this."
"This is not an everyday beer for me but several pours would be a tasty treat on a winter afternoon or evening."
"Overall- A fairly decent winter ale as it’s not too heavy and yet maintains a nice flavor profile."
""
""
"a great tasteing beer smells boozy but its not its a great tasteing beer for english dark mild ale if you like these beers s then you will like this low in acl so enjoy drinking it great taste low hop so enjoy this beer great color may be not great taste at frist sip but the rest of the beer it taste great and go down fine"
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with a light tan head on top. The retention leaves a bit of film on top of the beer and the lacing is scattered. The smell of the beer is of earthy toasted malt. The taste is also a bit toasted with a very light chocolate flavor and a touch of hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy, it's smooth and very drinkable. Overall it's a malty brew, it's gives off some nice English elements. It's a good brew."

"A dark golden brown color with a substantial oatmeal colored head and strong lacing. Very nice. The aroma brings chocolatey cardboard and mild nutty citrus. Sort of swampy in a decent way. The taste brings out more swampy malt and herbal hops. There’s a vague touch of chocolate and even some citrusy highlights. It’s medium-light bodied with even carbonation. Light caramel-coffee qualities with a midland feel of tingly refreshment that makes a somewhat dry finish. Decent, sessionable, nothing memorable but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Definitely not a winter warmer--this late-season ale follows the road less-traveled down the path of obscure English ales. It seems to be as much an English brown ale as it is a mild, but either way it is a mannered success. The flavor profile is well established, but its the small details that seem to shine brightest. It promises to serve well as a cooking ingredient, but it really deserves to be enjoyed by the glass."
"M. Smooth texture results from that dash of rye malt on a medium body with OK carbonation."
""
"This beer doesn't fit the ABV for a dark mild, but the character seems to. It a sense, it was sort of a like a roasty brown. There was a mix of bitter grain with subtle, herbal citrus hops. The malts were creamy up front and then quickly lighten and dry out. There are hint of cola and cocoa with the darker bread and toffee. Overall, a very cool beer. I might have to go back for more."
""
""
"O: Interesting flavors and quite easy to drink - definitely a session beer that I would have no trouble enjoying again and again. It is rather unfortunate that this is not such an easy style to get since I find these beers to be right up my alley."
"O: This beer is quite flavorful and is also very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer goes down quickly! It’s a treat and makes me think I’ll be buying more very soon. One of my favorite Goose Island Beers."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a true great example of winter brews hope to get more of this one before to long."
"Rather nice - a satisfying winter beer. Many winter brews I've tried have been notably lacklustre, so this is a pleasant change. Subtle, well-balanced flavours and a fantastic body for the style. The ABV is a tad high for an English mild, but this is very drinkable. Recommended."
""
"So what complements this bitter ideal? I would ask you one little thing. What goes with a bitterish beer for these little bitter beer lovers. I might suggest go with some dark folk music like Townes Van Zandt or Greg Browns Songs of Innocence and of Experience or Covenant. If you're more into jazz then go with Ran Blake all the way."
"O- A tasty winter beer and one that could make it into my regular winter rotation."
""
"O: Very likable, easy drinking session ale from Goose Island"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very much a winter beer from look to taste, the rye adds a uniqueness and some depth. I know they are calling it a Mild of sorts but this one would do better with a bit more strength which would amp up the maltiness and fruitiness. We all know Milds can be bigger."
""
"Overall: Pretty impressive for a ""Mild"" beer. The rye adds some great flavor. Good balance of bready sweetness, spice, and bitterness."
"Overall: Not a bad rye beer. This one actually has a rye note to it and transitions nicely between the malt and sweet finish."
"Overall - Smooth and rich but not overly filling. Strong malt flavor and mildly bitter profile. A little bit boring after the first few sips. That being said, I am cracking open my second, so it must not have been too boring :)"
"A very enjoyable beer. Lots of complexity, especially for such a low avb beer. I wish I could have done the taste more justice in my explanation, but this one is really hard to nail down."
""
""
""
""
"O=Not unenjoyable, but not enjoyable either. Not one I'll order again."
"I'm not too familiar with rye beers, but if this is a typical example, I'd be happy to try more. It pouts a beautiful coppery color with a nice two-finger+ head. The rye is noticeable, especially in the finish (which seems to linger for an impossibly long time). This is a well-balanced beer, and I'll add it to my good late-season football brews list."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a rich copper color with a large head of slightly tan head that retained well and left nice lacing. The aroma was of rye bread, sweet bread and a caramel malt. The flavors were pleasant and balanced. I tasted the rye distinctly but also notes of toasted malt, caramel malt and a slightly spicy, dry finish. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. I’m not much of a fan of rye beers but this one was quite nice."
"A satisfying brew. The rye is light and this one is not nearly as hoppy as most in the style. Definitely more malty that most rye beers."
""
""

"A very good and drinkable beer. Tasty, but seems to lack a slight bit for me"
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good mild ale and a nice beer to have on a cold winter night."
"Overall- Very enjoyable beer. I am looking forward to having this one again."
""
""
""
""
"O - A good beer with the right amount rye to make it worth a try."
""
""
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped 11/23/11-2022. Sampled on January 2, 2012. It pours a dark amber with a decent enough head that settles after a few minutes but never quite goes away. Not a lot in the aroma other than barkey and grains. The body is in the medium range with some relatively nice body. The taste is very much like the aroma with a whole lot of grains upfront and a clean crisp hopped ending."
""
"Poured in a pint glass. Poured amber in color with a one finger light beige one finger head, almost white in color. Slight reddish copper color when held up to light. nice mild smell, plum and light nuttines, winter smell. A lot of retention as glass empties. Very little carbonation. Slight plum and nutty flavor. Great balance of spices and flavor. A perfect winter session beer. One of my favorites that I always have on hand during the winter."

""

""

""
""
"This was simple, but good. It's a straightforward ale, clean, smooth, and some nuance. Would have again."
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Well balanced. Brings out a little spicy heat as it warms (presumably the rye as noted on the bottle)."
"O: Nice seasonal offering. Has a subtle warming effect. Good for a few."
""
"O: This is a good beer. I'm looking forward to trying other beers from this brewery."
"O - Overall, an enjoyable beer, and a nice detour from the ""winter warmer"" style that most of the holiday seasonals fall into. I could definitely put down a few of these guys in a session."
""
""
"O- It's a nice winter/holiday seasonal. Hearty and significant enough without overwhelming one's palate with spice, or bourbon barrels, or huge ABV. It drank quite nicely on a mild winter evening of my own (highs in the 50s during the second week of December). I guess it's not technically winter yet..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is just another average holiday beer for me. Nothing really stands out. It's not bad, just not memorable."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good holiday beer. Suitable in cold climates. This is not a beer that will satisfy a thirst. I could not imagine reaching for this on a hot day, which is clearly why it is seasonal. Fairly filing. A great contender to other winter season brews."
""
"Pours a deep amber with an off white 1 finger head. The smell is good. It has a light roasted smell. The taste is also good. The roasted malts come through quite well. I would like to have some more spices in it though. Overall a good beer. When goose said mild they ment it with this one. The flavor is not overwhelming, but just enough to give it some uniqueness. Good overall brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a nice dark brown color. There is a finger of light tan head on top of it. The head has some good retention, and it leaves some nice scattered lace behind on the glass. The nose starts of with some nice toasted malt aromas. There is some spicy rye, caramel, chocolate, coffee, mild hops, nuts, and some chocolate and coffee. The nose is quite pleasant. The taste follows the nose pretty well. The toasted malt flavors come out first. There is some caramel sweetness, and a nice bit of chocolate and coffee. The rye makes itself known, and there is a little bit of nuttiness. The flavors are their but they seem a little muted at times. The finish leaves some lingering toasted malt, caramel, and chocolate on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a real smooth feel to it. There is a nice sweetness but there is some roasted bitterness and some mild hops that balance it out. There is some spiciness from the rye here as well. This has good drinkability. It is a nice easy going beer that has good flavor. I could easily drink a few pints of this in an evening. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and an interesting rye beer. I definitely think this beer is worth trying, and I would buy it again. Cheers."
""
""
""
"O: Nice winter beer. As the name says its great for a mild winter night."
""
""
"O-A little too heavy on the Rye and not enough spices and nuttiness that I like from my winter beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is just OK. Flavor is interesting but not enough body to back it up."

"Overall a very nice winter ale that was a pleasant surprise at the small town local liquor store. Haven't always been a huge fan of Goose Island but they seem to have gotten something right with this one. Don't remember trying a beer with rye before but it is definately something I'll look forward to trying again."

"Overall a decent winter beer. Easily drinkable and decent taste."
"O- A solid winter beer, it's cool to see one that's done without the usual load of spices."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It is not necessarily your traditional spiced winter beer but it is definitely unique and is a good beer for the season."
"Great value for a great brewer's beer creation. Must try."
"O: nice easy drinky, great feautre of malts, rye is integrated nicely"
"Notes: Medium in body, and quite flavorful on the palate. It's a tasty brew, and the rye stands out nicely. Well-balanced, and quite sessionable. A very solid winter release."
"o - pretty enjoyable and seems to represent the style well. will certainly be buying this again."
"The beer pours out clear and deep brown – walnut – with a nice rich head. The aroma is very light, but is yeasty and reminds us of rising bread and nuts. The taste is of sweet malts and – true to the style – nicely spiced rye. It’s an extremely enjoyable and slightly spiced beer that isn’t overpowering, but is just complex enough. Because it’s not overpowering like some winter seasonals, this really is a great session beer."
"O-Its really an interesting brew. Great for the winter. hence the name"
"Poured into a pint glass it revealed a nice copper hued amber color with a head that was maybe an inch or so high and balanced out well along the walls of the glass. Aroma was heavy hops at first, citrus and pine, but as it warmed some balance is brought forward by bready malts and hints of caramel. Nice and smooth, clean finish had a nice bite to it but mellowed tremendously as it went down leaving a semi dry, semi sweet finish in its wake."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is sticky and coating. The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. This rye beer is just okay there is nothing in the beer that stands out as anything different."
"Another let down from Goose Island IMO. Malt flavors are present, but not robust as they should be. Their is a slight hint of smoke but needs more. Leaves an aftertaste of metal almost. The only good thing about the beer was it was smooth, wet, and light, kinda like how I like my women."
"Pours a clear, lightly red tinted brown color, moderate cap of khaki head, decent retention and lacing. Smell begins nutty but with a distinctive earthyness and spiceyness. Taste is nutty, touches of roast, chocolate, dark bread, nice spiceyness throughout with an earthyness to it, faint kisses of carmel and earthy hops. Medium bodied, very smooth. A nice find, expected a mild and got something more akin to a nut brown ale or ESB, the rye (which i wasnt even aware was a main component in the beer) gives it a lot of charachter."
"O: Quite a pleasant beer. Uncomplicated, easy drinking. Got the last two bottles from the shelf for this year, but will be glad to see it return a couple of seasons from now."
"Goose Island Mild Winter was one of the beers I was recommended by kegworks Facebook blog. To start off it looks and smells wonderful. It is also, to date, is the first rye beer I have ever tasted. The flavor is excellent and remains solid during the first pull with little to no aftertaste, but what is really impressive about this beer was the mouthfeel. Goose Island Mild Winter is like drinking liquid silk. I could draw some parallels to a mouthfeel equivalence with some of the cold coffee beverages on the market such as the Starbucks frappuccino, but the feel of this beverage in your mouth is truly sublime. The only criticism i would wage against this beer is that, and this may be personal, is that it makes me feel thirsty afterward, as if there was a small amount of MSG in the bottle, this though may be just an aspect of the style."
"Finish: Little hop note sneaks in after the other notes dissolve on the end"
"O: I'm a fan of goose island but this one is a bit unremarkable. Nothing bad just not one that I'm going to buy in the future."
"This brewery is consistent. Irked that they aren't brewing the hexnut brown any longer, more irked that they have sold their soul to the devil. Drinking as much as I can now in case big brother starts messing with the recipes!"
"Poured into a pint glass this beer is a clear ruby with an inch of pillowy white head, and moderate lacing. It smells of toasted grains and fresh rye bread. Malty up front with a crisp rye finish, delicious. Mouthfeel is slightly thin and very carbonated. Overall a great winter session beer."
"Another winner from Goose Island. The look is like a nut brown ale, but with a fantastic pillowy cloud head and terrific lacing. The smell was somewhat doughy and a bit toasted. The taste was mild toasted rye bread with an illusion of sweetness. Slight hops. In the catagory of $12-13 bucks for a twelve pack this one gets an A+. One of the best beers for the money along with Honkers Ale."
"D: Sessionable. Got to the end of the glass before I was even done writing this review!"
"Reviewed on-tap. From the dim bar light, I see that it pours a darkish brown. An off-white head laces around the glass pretty well. Smell is good, rich malts, with a bit of caramel and toffee. Taste is also gloriously malty, the rye acts as a rich, almost syrup-like note to the beer. Very mild on the palette as well. Drinks easy and well. A fine beer for this time of year."
"Slick, almost creamy mouthfeel. This is an easy drinker but overall fairly lackluster for me."
"Overall: I'm not sure if this is a great winter beer, but it is a very tasty beer that I wouldn't hesitate drinking any time of the year. Refreshing and tasty."
"This one poured a nice gingerbread hued color with a good thick head of off white foam. The smell of this one is roasted gingerbread with definite signs of other roasted malts, brown suga, and possibly nutmeg. This one tastes warm and inviting giving off it's malty notes with the added brown sugar flavor coming in at the end to balance the roasted taste with a nice sweetness. The mouthfeel of this one is slightly watery with some bubbles at the same time. I think this goose island brew is pretty drinkable, but definitely prefer the regular Christmas ale."
"Drinkability: I love rye beers and I found Goose Island Mild Winter to be a very drinkable beer. Nicely balanced. It would go well with many things - chips, pizza, steak, salad, etc."
"D- Very drinkable, perfect for those end of winter days."
"An ok rye beer/winter seasonal at best. Really nothing special. Definitely could use more complex flavors and a thicker, richer body."
"Very solid regular beer, will buy again."
"This beer pours a murky amber color. The head is one inch of solid eggshell colored foam that recedes quickly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, a hint of cocoa, and a faint hint of spice. The taste is similar to the aroma with a lot of complex toffee and caramel malt flavors and just a little spice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light, soft carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will surely drink again."
"O: Not bad, not great. Goose Island's Mild Winter is just kinda there. It's beer, take it or leave it. I found it to be a bit blah and one I wouldn't pass up if offered, but one I won't be asking for by name."
"Drinkability: In some terms the beer can be seen as simple but in other's it could be seen full of complexity. Nice and quaint but full of flavor."
"Drinkability - This beer is alright. Easiliy drinkable. I like the burnt toast flavor ok. I could have a few of these at one time. This could be good in the Fall as well as the Winter."
"The style is something newer to me, so once I have a few more, I'll see how they all stack up. The head on this beer was creamy and tan, and lingered for quite a bit. I thought the beer showcased the rye very well as it was present in the smell and the taste. The roasted malts were also very smooth and mellow which allowed the rye to shine through. Other spices are present in the smell and taste, the carbonation is low and it allows for a very easy drink."
"Biggest Blizzard to hit Chicago since 1967...better get inside and drink some Goose Island Mild Winter to stay warm!!!! Poured it from the bottle into a big Willi glass as suggested. The beer formed a beautiful head which led to decent lacing! The clear copper/amber color was a sight to see. Not much to smell...maybe a hint of the rye used. The taste is good, comes off the pallate dry like most ryes will. Is this a SESSION beer...you bet your bottom $!!!! Drink up my friends!"
"Drinkability: One of the best Goose Island beers I have had. I can really taste the rye, yet it is not overwhelming. I like how it combines with the pale malts. I could easily six this one."
"I would pass on this one in the future."
"EDIT: (2-5-11) The more I drink this one....the more I am impressed and the more complex the flavors seem to get. The rye stands out more and more as you experience this and know what to look for. This tastes like a loaf of fresh rye bread. Each swirl of the glass reignites the foam and the creamy/chewiness is amazing. I like this more each time I try it and had to give it props.This beer is definitely in my ""top 10 to have in the fridge all the time"" list. If Founders Red's is my ""go-to"" Rye/IPA...this is my ""go-to"" Rye/Brown Ale. These two will keep any rye lover happy!"
"This is a good beer, but the rye bread taste doesn't do it for me."
"Goose Island Mild Winter was a deep amber color with some very fine particles floating about. It had a beige head that didn't last with very little lacing. The smell was malt and rye bread with a touch of spice. The taste was malty sweet, a little earthy, with some pepper; quite interesting. It was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. This was an interesting ale and worth a try."
"On tap at Goose Island as well as from a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. A pleasant and refreshing drink (think ""peppermint""). Clear medium red amber color with a average, frothy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, light roasted - oat, light to moderate hoppy, licorice - anis seed notes. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft."
"Great drink what can I say."
"D - Lower of the alcohol scale and mild taste, good combination for drinkability."
"D- This beer was a nice crisp tasting beer. The low IBU count makes it a easy to drink beer for anyone really. The ABV lends to the drinkability as well. Mild ale? Not really which bugged me. Rye beer? More so than mild ale."
"Mouthfeel was very nice. A lot lighter than I was expecting, which made it very easy to drink. I really liked that it was a winter style beer with a ton of flavor but was still very easy to drink."
"If the body were as delightful as the aromas, this would be a better beer although there isn't too much to complain about."
"D- Overall this beer drinks nicely. It is well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable. I could drink this many more times. I still haven't had anything from Goose Island that I haven't liked."
"Taste: Crunchy grain malts, probably from the rye, along with toffee and a butter-like end. Very well balanced. I had this before and I wasn't fond of it at all, in fact I remember giving the rest of the six pack away. This is a nice surprise."
"Hits the front of the mouth with a sting of bitter grape then creamy malt coats the mouth with a chewy full flavor. Finishes with yeast/rye bread notes - very nice."
"D: a very nice rye beer with good spice notes and wonderfully drinkable."
"d 3 the tangy roast tends to accumulate over time, not because there's a ton of it in the beer but since there isn't enough of a counterpoint. a good beer, but one is generally enough for me."
"Served on tap into 16oz pint glass. Reddish beer capped by half finger white head which reduces to broken lacing. Almost no visible carbontaion. Faint aroma of mild toasty malt and hints of spice. Flavor is quite enjoyable, lots of good malty flavors, biscuity, spicy, echos of cinnamon toast, complete with raisins. For a beer that identifies itself as a winter beer, this one is quite mild with high drinkability. Mouthfeel is under carbonated making it all the easier to swallow, but perhaps to the detriment of flavor distribution. Good beer."
"Got this brew in a craft your own sample pack from my locals wegmans (best idea ever). Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass. Now before i review any further this was my first time trying a rye beer, wasn't really sure what to expect. The color was a light reddish brown, with a fluffy white head. This had a light caramel scent with strong malty flavors. The taste... i couldn't get the taste out of my mouth fast enough, it wasn't the worst taste, just kinda strange, it didn't make sense to me what was going on in my mouth. There was a dry malty resin left in my mouth. It took more than a couple mouth full's to get used to, then the beer began to flow a little easier. Not sure if it was the style or just the beer, but definitely not for me."
"Overall, this beer is drinkable but nothing stands out in particular. The taste seems just a bit off for the feel."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid here. Great rich appearance with a nice foamy head and plenty of lacing. Nose is not complex, but a fine malty woody thing. Flavor, again, is not complex, but ruled by the rye. It's well down though...not overpowering. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall a unique tasting winter, its good. I rarely feel like I've been let down when I drink Goose Island."
"D - Overall this beer drank very well; another fine beer by Goose Island; I thought they did a good job combining the classic ingredients of malt and rye into a easy but complex tasting drink; not something you can drink a lot of and kind of heavy on the stomach, but good to have one every once in a while"
"D - as I said, a good one to put on some music and chill with in the warmth while watching the rest of the world deal with the bitter cold outside your window"
"Drinkability - Nothing of great note here, just slightly malty, good tasting, quaffable beer. I wouldn't hunt for this one, but a person could do a lot worse."
" D- This is a nice crisp beer that is malt forward with some good depth from the rye and nice support from the hops."
"D - very easy to consume; would prefer a little more complexity to draw me back"
"Overall: A very solid winter seasonal from the folks at Goose Island."
"Very drinkable, great beer."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and very drinkable. A well balanced mild and overall a good beer to enjoy in the winter."
"D- I'm going to pass on this one."
"D: Drinkable but forgettable. Lineup filler for GI at best."
"Overall- Great value on this one with a nice nonoffensive flavor. This is one everyone can enjoy."
"D - perfect beer for the cold weather. another fine brew from goose island."
"D: A nice winter warmer type beer, but it seems that they could increase the alcohol on this one to be more of the style, but perhaps that's why it's called ""Mild Winter."""
"While it does have a hearty graininess, Goose Island Mild Winter is medium-bodied, casually drinkable and has a tangy refreshing quality that actually suits, not those cold, dark, snowy 'Nor Easter-type storms, but rather, as its name proclaims, more temperate and balmy weather. Whatever the forecast, I see a high probability of repeat purchase."
"Pours a cloudy medium brown with orange on the edges. Finger thick white head which fades quickly into moderate lacing. Not much aroma at all. Taste is a nice nutty, sweet, mild rye aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel and easy drinking. Not a big fan of rye beers but this one is pretty good."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is exactly what you hope for in a winter beer. There is a rich and smooth mouthfeel to this beer and as aforementioned the beer would serve well as a blizzard session beer. There is just the right amount of a somewhat muted carbonation level to the beer which really allows the beer to have to be forced onto and across the palate with each and every sip."
"D: Good appearance on goose islands part, but the flavour and smell was not up to their regular standards. Overall a pretty average beer from GI."
"D: Good drinkability, I may come back to this again this winter and would recommend it to someone looking for a lighter winter offering."
"Totally the wrong style tag, but totally the right name."
"So I brought this beer along to drink after a hike on a mild late-autumn day. It was the first time I had this beer. I have enjoyed other Goose Island products, and I thought I'd give this one a try. I did not realize it was a rye beer, an I had never had a rye beer before. This was certainly the most refreshing winter beer I'd ever had and it was spot-on for after a strenuous hike. I would describe the beer as light. I did get the vanilla and hazelnut taste. It also was creamy. I would recommend drinking this in the afternoon. You could certainly enjoy a couple. I think you would like this beer and I would suggest picking some up. I"
"The name on this one says it all. It is mild and mellow, easy going and tranquil, serene and sedate. Dark amber. Sweet and a touch fruity. Very easy to drink and quite tasty. It is what it claims to be - a mild winter warmer. Glad I bought a 6 pack. Ready to open my 2nd."
"Drinkability: I like this better than any of the other GI seasonals, and right now I would say that it holds up to the year round offerings as well."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, similar to a cream soda. carbonation makes the beverage seem almost fluffy."
"There are mild Winters in Chicago? This one pours a clear garnet-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, black pepper, rye spice, very light roasted malts, dark chocolate, wheat, and nutmeg. The taste loads up on the rye and pepper, with some light maple syrup, very light molasses, and cocoa powder backing them up. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice rye beer, something I hope to have more of in the coming Winter months."
"This one pours a rich hazelnut in color with a light white head. It smells of bread, bread, and more bread. I know it's a rye beer but it smelled like nothing but oat bread. Unfortunately it also tasted like nothing but oat bread. I like oat bread, but not as a beer. It lacked complexity and didn't offer anything appealing. It drank fine, well carbonated and smooth but I wouldn't drink this one again. It's too bad because I love Goose Island."
"Drinkability -- I liked this one much better than I had anticipated. Essentially an English Nut Brown with the addition of some spicy rye in the grist. Quite effective, and a great fireside beer when a more modest abv is preferred. Good stuff."
"D - While I think this is an extraordinarily crafted rye beer, it's not a sessionable one. The flavor does become a little bit cloying to me towards the end of the pint. Fantastic brew and very well-designed label. Not a winter staple for me but it's definitely good here and there."
"A solid winter ale, the rye was very muted, mostly acting to dry the beer out. Defintiely better as it warms."
"High drinkability, for me this is a good beer that could be a session beer."
"Overall: A good low maintenance drink that's pretty unique."
"I have had a few mild ales, and this one is similar with its malty, earthy profile. The rye makes a step above most in this category. This is a nice alternative to the heavily hopped winter offerings."
"Very hoppy with a mild bitterness. Enjoyable, worthy of your time and a good session. Goes well with cigars!"
"Drinkability: Really good stuff. Straightforward and very drinkable. I wonder how many calories is it in, though."
"D/M: drinks very smooth. Goes down very nice and doesn't drink heavy and also doesn't sit heavy. Very enjoyable overall"
"Pretty good little session brew... A few things I might change if I could but its hard to complain about them. Glad I got to try this brew..."
"I'm not sure how accurate this classification is, as Goose Island's website refers to the beer as an ""American Mild Ale."" That is not a category available here on BA, but I wonder if perhaps there is a better class for this listing. Poured a chestnut brown. Moderate roasted malt flavors, and I really did not get much of a sense of the rye element of the beer. A pleasant-enough session ale, but I'm a bit surprised that Goose Island would pick this for a winter offering."
"Goose Island seems to have stepped up their brewing in the last couple of years, and this is another triumph. This rye ale is an attractive deep amber with a rich foam and a fruity, biscuity nose. So far seems enticing! Taste is a surprisingly smooth and spicy, with a hint of clove. Subtle and tasty, this one's definitely enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is light with light carbonation. It is a good beer; but I hope you know what you are getting when you buy it. It is no winter warmer... essentially a dark ESB."
"Drinkability: This is a smooth drinking beer that could easily suffice as a session beer."
"Poured into my tulip. Color is garnet-copper with a white head that sticks around for a pretty decent amount of time. The nose is pretty tame with just a bit of rye and light caramel. The taste amps it up with caramel, rye, some floral hops, some orange, and a little spice. Nice feel and drinks quite well in the end, althogh it is somewhat choppy at certain points."
"Pours a dark amber with a nice head. Not a strong nose-- smells mainly like malty goodness. Very drinkable-- kinda like a dark ESB, with the rye lending some nice heft to it. A winter session beer... I like this idea a lot. Goose Island has really been brewing strong lately."
"Received as an extra in a recent trade. Poured a light to medium brown color, with a little tan head. Aromas of cereal, light hops and malt. OnLightly carbonated, medium bodied, somewhat creamy. On the palate, somewhat sweet, lightly hopped, with hints of caramel and rye. A solid, easy to drink beer."
"D - goes down easy."
"Bottle dated 10/14, VERY fresh sample. I love that I can get this beer fresh and know it is so from the bottle. Pours out a deep copper brown, with a very white head. Reminds me of an English Red Ale with that bright, white head. Smells slightly toasty, but not much hop presence. Beer looks more interesting than it smells. That is one area that I find the bulk of Goose Beers kinda fall flat, aroma and mouthfeel, which is often watery but more on that later. The taste is nice, a roasted flavor hits the senses first, followed by a clean bitter finish. Also seems somewhat crisp and refreshing with a light prickly carbonation on the tongue. This beer would pair well with a lot of winter foods, in such a way as to quench the thirst after eating some heavier comfort foods. This mouthfeel is a little richer than the average Goose fair and could be benefitted from the rye. Some vague dark breadiness too comes forth after a few more sips. I will be looking forward to this as a good, fresh fallback beer this winter, albeit not extremely complex, but refreshing nonetheless!"
"I had to wait for this brew to warm up. It was served in a frozen mug (not by request). It was very tasty and left me wanting more."
"D - Actually, this is quite drinkable. It's a low alcohol, lighter bodied winter ale that is nice when you don't feel like something heavy."
"This was decent but I would have liked to have seen the hops and spice toned down a bit in the taste. I really enjoyed that mix of breadiness from the malts and rye in the aroma and could have standed to have some more of that coming through."
"Thanks, ghostee, for the opportunity"
"Overall, a good beer. There isn't a ton going on, but it is pleasant and easy drinking."
"D: This beer is exactly what it says it is: A mild, mass market craft beer. It brewed exactly how it is supposed to be brewed, but, that doesn't mean I have to like it and I don't. Personally I find it too light and rather one dimensional. Not my style of beer and not one I will be searching out for again."
"I guess I have always preferred a mild winter after all."
"Pours a dark amber color with the top appearing a little darker than the botton and a nice one finger pillow head. The aroma is of a little breadiness and some rye along with a faint earthy hop smell. The taste is a roasted malt backbone with a rye hint and a small earhty hop bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is mildy carbonated. Overall its an average drinkable beer, it has some good flavors but nothing overly complex."
"D: Low carbonation and creaminess make this one rather easy to polish off."
"Notes: Pretty good beer that is very bread like and definitely is a rye beer. Spices worked quite well and really compliment the wintery feel of this beer."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is smooth, drinkability is ok but the rye actually chases me away from this one. Usually I down rye beers like water, but this one just isn't doing it for me."
"D: for me this was a great beer that just finishes a little to sweet to be highly drinkable. good complexity of flavor though, and I really enjoyed it. I suppose a winter beer isn't designed to allow you to quaff a six pack. I am enjoying this pint while watching the snow pile up to around a foot and a half which seems to help make this beer better."
"D- Easy drinking beer. I could session this for sure. Good stuff."
"Drinkability - The medium body/low carbonation profile of this beer makes it excel as a drinker. Could find myself drinking a number of these on tap at a bar."
"Goose Island Mild Winter is a dense looking, clear, reddish, light brown ale with a huge, fluffy, off white foam that has outstanding retention and lacing. It smells quite English. The aroma is dank and doughy and funky... grassy and fruity too. It's medium light bodied and quite smooth. It leaves the mouth a little gritty. It's a pretty mature flavor. It's really well balanced and quite mellow. It starts almost sweet, with a chocolaty flavor; then the rye is detected as both bread and whiskey. A grassy bitterness zips it up. It's subtle. You could either pound this or brood on it. I find it interesting and unique."
"There aren't too many commercial examples of this style anymore, so I had to try it when I saw it. The diacetyl is a bit distracting for me, but besides that, this is a great example of the style and even more important, a tasty flavorful but not overwhelming beer."
"Drinks really well, I could order more. The 5.6% is nice, not to heavy, not to lite. I wouldn't of put this as a rye if I didn't learn it here."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"What a surprisingly good beer. I poured this into a pint glass, it left a good 1-1/2"" of puffy head which extended a good 1/4"" above the rim of the glass. This retained all the way down. Left good lacing. Dark amber color. Not much smell unfortunately. Great mildly spicy taste though. Nothing overwhelming, just a very tasteful winter beer. This is probably the best winter ale I've had this year. Nice balance of mild malt with a smooth hoppy finish. Medium body and great drinkability."
"D: I'll have this one again for sure. A great seasonal session beer from a great brewery."
"Pours amber brown with a fluffy tan head. Some retention and nice lacing. Aroma is of bread and nuts,with hints of spice. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is of spicy bread up front with a smooth sugary finish. Little bit of hops throught. Very nice"
"Orangish-brown with a thick solid tan head. Nice little stream of bubbles flow from top to bottom. Earthy-sweet chocolate malty smell with rye and hops detectable. Nice flavors in this beer. A good mix of sweet malty caramel dark chocoalte, and tangy sour rye notes. Not a huge hop presance, but there is a nice herbal bitterness in the finish. Good tasting beer. The rye is detectable without becoming overpowering. Very subtle complex flavors come out. Good beer with a foot of snow outside."
"Overall a good session winter beer. The rye is not in your face at all, and actually has a nice subtle rye bread sort of quality, what I would imagine a kvass beer might be like."
"D - Nicely drinkable and a good winter ale."
"Taste: Kind of like a winter warmer with the rye in place of the common spices used in winter warmers."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a semi-sweet caramel malt and rye scent. It's dry with a touch of spiciness. The taste is decent. It has a mild rye spiciness as well as a dry roasted character. It's easy drinking, but could use some caramel malts for some sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. The rye is well represented. It's a bit one sided, but not bad."
"This is a balanced, fine-tasting, and drinkable winter offering."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer. Solid malt flavors with some detectable hops. Its an easy drinker that has good flavors to accompany the cold season without leaving you bloated."
"D - For a rye beer it's pretty good nothing really special but a good easy drinking beer that's worth trying"
"D - A tasty beer, and one I could drink a few of, though not as sessionable as Honker's Ale."
"Pretty tasty, and definitely enjoyable. A good example of using rye in a beer, but not exemplary for a winter beer."
"Overall- I love this brew which I was kind of surprised. I have tried only a few Goose Island products and I wasn't too impressed so far. Maybe I owe it to this brewery to go back and try some of the ones I tried again. This makes me proud to be a citizen of Chicago!!! I am just bummed this was the only one left. It is head and shoulders better than the 2 Below I tried yesterday."
"Works well as a mild winter ale. I really like this, although there's nothing about it that I find truly exceptional. Surprisingly warming for 5.6%."
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... nothing ground breaking but worth a try..."
"D- a very drinkable brew, prob. one of the best ryes i've had yet, maybe a bit light for a ""winter"" beer but i could def. make this one of my top 10 session beers"
"Pours a darker dull brown amber with a thin bubbly white sudsy head. Smells like an ESB, wet grains, spicy toasted malts, caramel, light floral hop bite. This stuff is very mellow, a rye ESB, softly spicy, softly malty, softly bitter, slightly chewy and bready, light floral hops. Medium/light bodied with sharp carbonation.A really nice balance for very drinkable beer. I really need to find more of this...can't seem to find this in this area very easy."
"Overall, outstanding beer, almost wish it was around all season. I've always thought that Goose Island brewed some mighty fine beers, and after Matilda, this would be my second favorite. Cheers."
"A rye not a mild, recent bottle. Refreshin with that rye edge. Moderately pleasant aroma, arising from a medium yellow body topped by good amount of bubbled head. Lace follows through. Very drinkable, refreshing. Warms the body on a cold night.Average mouthfeel, a little edgy but smooth.Drying aftertaste."
"Unlike many ryes, it doesn't hit you in the palate and take over everything. It is a bit mild (as in the name) for a rye, and that's why I like it. It's still good even though they are almost gone."
"Conclusion: This is, in my opinion, kind of the American equivalent (in spirit, if not in style) of Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale. It's a quaffable, simple, unspiced, lightly-hopped Winter Warmer style beer that, in not trying to over-awe or over-power, ends up being great."
"If Great Divide can make a rye Oktoberfest, who's to say Goose Island can't make a rye winter ale?"
"I would say it's pretty drinkable, due to the clean finish and light body, but 5.6% is not a real sessioner. Still not a bad brew to have a few of. Nothing here to really scare away casual drinkers, other than maybe too much flavor. It probably would be an easy transition for those who liked the brown ale. Best served only slightly chilled."
"Overall a nice change of pace. The rye gave it a flavor new to me, one I enjoyed. This is an easy to drink beer, I'd happily have more of this."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Wow this stuff is drinkable. I could put back many bottles of this one."
"This is a good, light feeling beer that could be used for mass consumption."
"Tastes not quite as balanced, falls too far towards the toffee sweet end. Bready candy with nothing bitter to balance it. Candy is nice--there's a reason kids like it so much--but I usually like a bit more in my beer."
"D - Very drinkable. ABV is manageable. Flavors aren't overwhelming, although somewhat boring. Its ""winter warming"" affects aren't as strong as I was hoping for. Not filling."
"drinkability is good - reminds me of a spicy honkers"
"This is a good, sessionable fall to winter style beer which is exactly how and when I intended it."
"D: I wouldn't have a problem drinking this one off and on throughout the winter season. High."
"D- Very easy drinking and super session-able. Can't beat the price either. A really nice winter seasonal from Goose Island."
"I had this in the taster flight but over the course of an evening I could have had it all night long. Much easier drinking than those BCS type brews...Matilda included."
"Poured a dark brown that you could almost see through, with a respectable head that faded to a collar. The aroma was pretty quiet, but I got a bare whiff of chocolate when I first poured it. The taste was mild, as the name would suggest, sweet with a gentle hop presence. This is another in a long line of beers that really improves as it warms. The caramel then came out strong and the mouth feel also thickened. The feel was medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was very good, both flavor and ABV supported sitting down with a sixer one of the cold, winter nights."
"I tend to enjoy hop-heavy beer, so this is certainly not a brew I thought I'd enjoy, but I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't call this brew delicious, but it's quite savory and pleasant. I do not taste the variety of spices that others here mentioned, but I'm not sure any spices would improve this ale. I'll be having a few more of these and looking forward to it each time winter rolls in."
"Many thanks to my dear friend for the sample. Pours into my totally sweet New Glarus Uff-da Bock nonic a copper red with a thick and everlasting beige head. Lovely aroma of fresh malt. Very spicy. Pepper. Taste has loads of banana and black pepper. Green like fresh mustard greens. Lots of pepper. Wow! Dark and lasting malt flavors. Aggressive carbonation and stinging rye oils attack the tongue. Very drinkable. Very good."
"The mouthfeel is light and watery, the beer is decently drinakable. Nice seasonal, nothing special that I would go out and search for."
"D- very easy to drink and sessionable. an interesting take on the typical winter seasonal. i would like it more if there was a larger hop presence."
"Drinkability: Nice for cool weather; moderate ABV and it's not heavy at all, nice mild flavors make for a great sessionable beer. I could drink this all day long during the holidays."
"D - Very easy to drink. I really wanted something sweeter with this, but it is a solid rye, would drink a ton if I am in the mood, but would really have to be in the mood for it to seesion these."
"Drinkability: Ridiculously drinkable for a Winter seasonal. I don't have much experience with Milds, but I prefer this one over the few others I have tried."
"D -- Goose is calling this an ""American Mild," which seems contradictory because Milds were always light in hops -- and what American beer is light in hops? Nonetheless, this is a very drinkable brew and much better than my try last year -- freshness as the key? Maybe, or maybe the hops were toned down so as not to clash with the rye -- dunno, but very good."
"Bottled on 12/4/08 this beer is holding up great, I thought it would be a mess after that much time. Appears a deep ruby caramel muddled hue with a light off white head forming thick with my vigorous pour. Lacing is even and fine and forms nicely with each sip from my tall 1/2 liter Willi glass used per direction. Aroma has a nice warming cereal grain sweetness about it, like walking through a specialty grain room when you tour a brewery with an edge of spicy rye in the finish. Barely a hint of herbal hops in the background, I'm sure when this brew was fresher there was a bit more hop aroma going on. Flavor has nice roasted malt layers with bread and subtle hazelnut and creamy milk chocolate tones, think nutella. That layer of spicy rye really adds to the complexity, along with the bite of herbal hop additions bitterness is at a minimal but overall flavor is good. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied carbonation is mellow and naturally smooth. Drinkability is great one that I will look for this coming December hopefully fresh, our local Goose Island wholesaler has been sending old product to all of the retail stores. This came in last week, and earlier this summer we got one year old Summer Kolsch and 312 Wheat along with continuously dated IPA and Honkers this is bad for craft beer."
"T- It has an excellent chilled hop taste to it with rye overtones. One of the better ales I've had in a while."
"This blew me away. May be the best thing besides deep dish pizza to come out of Chicago ever. I can't imagine how a fresh mug on tap would be. Excuse me while I wipe this drool off of my chin."
"Goose Island Mild Winter is a wonderful addition to the GI seasonal lineup. It's different enough to be interesting and is delicious besides. My crystal ball says that several sixers (at least) will be in my future every winter. May they all be mild."
"This has to be the single best brown ale I've ever had. There are layers upon layers of complexity, and it's exceptionally smooth, flavorful and drinkable. Not a single fault. Subtle and balanced. This, to me, defines a mild brown ale and what it should be. I am definitely gonna have to stock up on this while it's still around. Very highly recommended. I would give it all 5's if I couldn't imagine it was even better on tap."
"D: It's fine and good, but not really all that inspiring. The bottle will go nicely with my collection, but I won't snatch up more when I see it again."
"D- you know, when i was a young boy, my grandfather would... wait a minute. nevermind. i like how this beer lets the rye flavor stand out most of all. very satisfying. goose island is one of my favorite breweries despite their AB ties and they continue to supply this side of the country at least, with excellent beer. great for a session, even in springtime."
"Medium bodied.Long,sweetish finish. Very tasty. I could drink a lot of these, and still stay happy. How about that."
"D= A very drinkable ale that I will drink again gladly. Paired very well with pizza."
"A drinkable brew that tastes like it should have a higher ABV. Flavor is robust and enjoyable, with some interesting complexity. Worth a try."
"Very drinkable and solid session winter."
"Poured into a pint glass it poured a really dark copper light brown color with a nice head. The head stays for a while and leaves a some pretty nice lacing down the glass. I didn't get much of an aroma out of it but from what I did it was a little sweet and maybe a hint of caramel comes though. Was kind of surprised by the lack of smell but it could just be me. As for the the taste I think it's actually pretty good since I didn't get a whole lot out of the smell. Sweet, not bitter really and almost a hint of coffee in the aftertaste but not much. This beer is drinkable for sure. I will be picking this one up every winter."
"D: I am a big fan of some of the beers made by Goose Island. This however, is not one of them. It is o.k. but there are certainly better options available. I thought the smell was the best aspect. I probably wouldn't seek this one out."
"Drinkability overall was good. I could definitely drink a few of these in a session."
"This is not a heavily-flavored beer, but it has enough depth of flavor to keep it interesting right to the bottom of the glass. Not as roasty as a British mild ale, yet the mild sweetness and distinctive berry flavors pick up the slack. And the mouthfeel is quite appealing. I'd be happy to drink this one through a mild winter and right into a mild spring. File this one under ""Unusual, yet charming."""
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very smooth and drinkable. Carbonation is just right."
"Yeah, I liked this and I would buy it again. Mild attempt at the style, but good."
"A very drinkable ale and one that im glad to have stumbled upon today while looking for something else. While certainly nowhere near the most rye forward beer with rye, this is a tasty and sessionable brew that i really enjoyed. Well worth trying for fans of beers made with rye."
"extremely easy to drink given the color, went down real quick and i'd definitely drink again. lotta good attributes, nice choice."
"mid body. okay carbonation. i could drink many of these. i will try another six pack just to make sure i like it. and then i may try another."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 12/18/2008. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a dark copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like caramel malt, toffee and a bit of rye. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery spice and hops noticable. The hops show up more in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit dry and has average carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. Overall I think it's a decent beer, I'd buy it again in the future."
"Very nice, and so sessionable. A must try."
"Clear auburn. Thin beige head. Lacing is marginal. Nice aroma of powdered cocoa, chalk, dusty malt bins, and rye. Solid flavor overall. The rye is quite perceptible and enjoyable. Chalky mouthfeel with spatterings of cocoa here as well. Kind of a dry finish with a little spiciness lingering from the rye. Quite enjoyable and very sessionable."
"D: Smooth and tasty. Interestingly more complex than I may have imagined."
"Restrained carbonation, medium body."
"Poured from bottle into my Sam Adams Sensory Glass and WOW, what a great looking brew. I've had this beer in the past month but this is the first time in my SA glass and it's definitely a 5.0 in appearance. I'm surprised at how few reviews this beer has. All I can say is a lot of people are missing out on a great offering from Goose Island. Smells like fresh baked bread. Tastes very bready, too. You can taste the rye. Mouthful and drinkability are very good, too. Too bad this is only a seasonal offering and I have only two more in the fridge. I purchased this at Santori's Liquors in Lansing, IL and glad I did."
"D - this is pretty good beer from Goose Island. It seems like an interesting, spicier version of their Honkers Ale. Pretty good seasonal, I prefer this over their Christmas Ale."
"Meh -- too much sugar, not enough rye, below average for the style. If you are in Chicago and want a sweet beer from GI, go to the Clybourn pub and drink a Lake Effect instead."
"D - Very easy drinking, I think I'll have another. Interesting tastes keep me coming back."
"This drinks very well, but the thinness of the body is a bit distracting. Good flavors."
"surprised that the abv is this high for mild name on bottle. tatse profile sets up for session brew but abv a bit high to quaff many."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. A lot fuller in body that I expected considering the name and ABV. Overall, a tasty session beer that I can drink quite a few of."
"This is a decent beer that doesn't really offer anything too original and the rye is really subdued."
"At the Clybourn brewpub in December, Somewhat light brown look with decent head, not much on the nose other than decent malt and a bit of hops, no rye notes, taste is the same, not complex, very light, finishes easy, overall better than average but not one to seek out."
"Definitely drinkable - I just had 2 myself."
"D - This is yet another good beer from Goose Island. This is a nice ale for a winter night."
"Drinkability: Very good. This is a very flavorful beer that isn't overpowering. It's just drinkable."
"""Mild"" turned out to be an accurate descriptor. The color and appearance were great, but the smell and taste ended up being more subdued than I expected. The rye could have made this complex and deep, but ends up making this brew a one-trick pony of sorts. Still, it could make a decent session brew, and I certainly wouldn't turn one down, if offered."
"Admittedly, I'm a bit of a sucker for all things rye, as such, this will be a go to winter sessional henceforth."
"Overall a pretty nice beer for sitting by the fireplace or something of that nature, just not Goose Islands finest output."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The beer has a medium body moderate carbonation. There is a slight oily feel to the mouth. The beer is an easy to drink and definately a worthy session beer."
"pretty good via bottle as well."
"12 ouncer, bottled on dating on the label. Pours clear darker amber, light tan head that leaves real nice, fine well developed lace. A touch of chocolate, light winter spice and toasty bread in the nose. Smooth, eminently easy drinking, session able offering. Light spice, toast, mild rye and lightly roasted malts. Nice stuff. Pleasant winter sessioner."
"A very drinkable beer. I hosted my family Thanksgiving this year and when I do that I always get a lot of Miller Light and something decent for myself. I ended up having to go back to the liquor store to get more Mild Winter because that's all anyone was drinking."
"Crystal clear coppery red with a short beige cap. Very sticky with good head retention and sheets of lace. Earthy hop aroma, faint chocolate and roast, toasted malt, biscuit, mild spice and caramel. Subdued bitterness with mild hopping, earthy with a bit of floral character. Caramel and oily rye flavour, some dark malts, plus mild spice in the finish and lingering malts. Just under medium bodied, moderate carbonation, light dryness, a bit of an oily texture. Very good. Lots going on, but everything stayed balanced."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: When I saw this beer at the store I had high hopes. I would say it did not blow me away but did not make me unhappy. I would easily go out to buy a six pack to drink at home or share with my friends for fun. I think the predominant dried fruit flavors are appropriate for a ""winter"" beer while not being overly sweet and unapproachable by someone who prefers dry, hoppy beers. If you are an English Ale fan or enjoy a good Brown Ale, definitely give this brew a try for something different and unique."
"Called an American Mild on the label, this is another nice beer that doesn't bludgeon you over the head with alcohol or strong flavors, just a nicely balanced drinkable beer. Goose Island seems to be moving up my list of breweries."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (Bottled on 11/11/08) and served in a pint glass. This beer poured a lightly hazy copper brown hue with a quickly fading head of tan foam that settled into a lasting ring. Decent lacing. The aroma was made up of sharp rye, caramel, a bit of chocolate, a hint of dark fruit skins, and very mild noble hops. The flavor consisted of spicy rye, rich caramel, toasted nuts and grain, and a very mild, earthy hop note. Rich and malty. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had crisp, moderate carbonation. A nicely made winter session ale. I've already gone through a couple sixes this winter."
"D-It's enjoyable with it's smooth flavor and wintery taste and feel. I'd go for this one again."
"D: Alright, but nothing amazing. Think I prefer Bear Republic's Hop Rod for a rye beer."
"what makes this even better is that it has a quenching aspect to that would make it a perfect quaffer after an outdoor winter activity where a thirst may have been worked up. certainly sessionable...crazy quaffable...fantastically flavourful. another great beer from GI."
"Pours a clear, dark copper with two fingers of white head that had excellant retention. There is a lot of lacing left on the glass. Has a nice aroma. The rye definately is detected in the aroma along with some additional spice from the hops. Interesting flavor as well. Malty base with a little spice from the rye and hops. Hints of ginger. Bitterness is low. Mild flavor but overall interesting. Lighter body with moderate carbonation. It has a nice semi-creamy texture. A little more flavor than a typical mild ale. The addition of rye malt was a good choice. Very sessionable. I might want something a little more robust for a winter ale but this is still a good one."
"Clear medium brown with thinly lacing head. Aroma immediately brought to mind cereal from my childhood...cocoa puffs or cocoa pebbles, but strangely the beer itself didn't smell like cocoa. Something triggered that in my memory, however. The sip was bracing with its incredible rye bitterness. After a few more sips, the rye smoothed out into a very drinkable winter. In the beginning of the taste, there is something similar to very sweet tangerine, but it quickly disappears into malty richness. Nice dryish finish."
"This one is a definite winner from GI. Highly sessionable beer that I enjoy even more than Honker's or IPA. I will be putting down a few of these tonight they are just too good."
"Dry finish with a hint of spicing; medium in the body. Not a bad little sipper at all - Mild Winter is very well balanced, if not terribly exciting."
"Mild Winter is a nice addition to the winter arsenal of great brews. It's unique and I like that aspect of it a lot. It could use a little work across the board, but not much. This is a nice beer as it is. Certainly one I'll pick up again during this time of year. Recommended."
"The mouth is pleasantly thickish and creamy. Very easy beer to session. Great taste and low ABV add up to a winning brew. I'm glad to see this one added to the seasonal rotation!"
"Excellent and refreshing, Goose Island fails to disappoint."
"Doesn't sit that well after a few, because the sweetness will get to you eventually."
"Drinks alright, could do a few with a Reuben sandwich to be sure, other wise, I could take or leave this"
"D--Unlike the winter we are having here in Chicagoland (home of Goose Island), this is indeed a ""mild"" winter ale. Not a lot of the bitterness, full-bodiedness or spices you've come to expect in a winter ale. Mild as advertised. Almost like a fall special. Surprisingly good, and goin' down easy!"
"It poured a clear, very deep amber-almost-chestnut body with a ruby cast and orange highlights. The creamy white head held remarkably well, and it left rings of lace throughout the glass. The nose was restrained, but clearly malty, and oddly gently spicy. In the mouth it was medium, or perhaps medium-light, but with a dextrinous edge. The carbonation was fine-bubbled and at a moderate level, and it was gently fizzy but then creamy across the palate once warmed. The flavor followed the nose, and it was mainly malty with a soft caramel edge and a bit of spice. I searched for something to reveal what it was, not exactly finding any cinnamon, or ginger, or any other flavor, but got nothing. It was simply peppery spice. I thought that it was a very mild blend of spices that held steady in the background and didn't really reveal itself. Obviously, that was the rye, but I couldn't see that at the time. And not unlike a rye beer, it finished dry, and mildly spicy-peppery, but also with a bit of hop flavor. Quite nice. Superbly rounded and remarkably well balanced."
"It is certainly easy enough to drink, the watery, lighter bodied mouthfeel makes it easy going down, but the after a while you sort of forget what you are drinking. I would give this beer a second shot though, I think it has something to offer than maybe I am just not getting right now, I mean Goose Island does make some fantastic beers so this one deserves some extra attention."
"D: Lovely brew. It's so easy to get carried away with big beers and forget to appreciate the lovely subtleties of milder brews. This is a wonderfully refreshing beer. Perfectly balanced and just right for a session."
"This beer is really intriguing. A mix between and English Mild and a Rye Beer. This brings out the best of both. Bring this to your next holiday party instead of generic macro lagers. I would recommend this, and definitely purchase again."
"Pretty pour -- dark amber with a tall but light head. Smells like it tastes (spicy and malty). Feels yeasty or bready in the mouth, and I'm looking forward to having a pretty long session of these on Christmas Eve to help me cope with the in-laws-to-be..."
"This beer is very easy to drink. Not my type of beer, but I was shocked by how much I actually liked it. This would make a nice session beer."
"Pours a clear, brown with 1/4 inch head. Good lacing and slight retention. Smells of roasted malts and I'm guessing rye. Fits the style. Very sweet, smooth, crisp. Aftertaste is very mild but still a little rye and malt, but mostly sweetness. Low carbonation. Overall, an easy to drink beer and another good Goose Island brew."
"D - A great session beer. I have gone through several 12 packs already. An easy drinker with a nice rye twist."
"Pours deep ruby copper thin head some lacing. At first can smell some malt - caramel. Deep sniff reveals hints of fresh rye - other wise smells of dregs. Tastes carmel malty up front with hoppy bitter finish earthy smokey wet aftertaste. Very drinkable lighter mouthfeel for the flavor. The further down the glass the better I like this beer."
"It is a straightforward beer but very well-balanced and a low ABV means there is good chance I will be seeking this out again."
"Pours a very rusty amber color and an even two finger head that recedes to a thin filmy foam. Not much bubbling and no lacing, but a good color. Very mild toasted malts give a faint hint of Polish rye bread. The hops add a few sprigs of mint to this beer's aroma. Toasted caramel and crystal malts make up more than 50% of this beers favor. There is a good hops presence though. Adds some herbal, even earthy hints and a little astringency to this session beer."
"Good drinkable beer."
"12oz brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a pale brown/amber with a finger of off white head. Aroma of cocoa and a bit of hops. Fairly malty with some chocolate malt. Spritzy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. A fresh hop flavor. I didn't realize the rye aspect of the beer as I was drinking, maybe I should read the bottle. Definitely drinkable."
"Overall a very good session beer with a nice spicy 'tink' with a hint of toastiness. The dry and spicy element is well balanced, making this a delight to drink."
"An average beer from Goose Island. Personally, I'm not impressed."
"I picked up a 6-pack for about $7 at Palmers Beverage in Columbus. The beer is very clear copper color with a thick ""yeast-cake"" head. The smell is sort of neutral, I guess about what I'd expect for a mild beer with some rye, with some roasted malt in the background. The taste is very nice, zest spicy bite from the rye, not too excessive, good counterbalance with some sweetness from the malts. The body is a little more carbonated than a cask ale while retaining the smooth mouthfeel I associate with casks. This is a great beer from Goose Island, hopefully to become a regular seasonal release."
"D- I was not really expecting much from this one. But this is a really nice winter beer."
"Excellent beer, and I'm glad I bought extras."
"Pours a ruby orange color with plenty of carbonation. Nutty roasted aroma. Tastes of malt, nuttiness, slight roast character. Slight dryness on the palate due to the rye in this beer. A good beer overall and with such a low alcohol creates a nice session beer. A good mild offered by Goose."
"This brew is as advertised; a mild flavored. It pours a slightly hazed orange copper. A scant head dissipates quickly leaving only nominal lacing. Smell is faint sweet malt base with a slight twang of sharp rye and a touch of floral hop note. Taste has more of the rye twang and hop aspect while the bready malt takes a back seat. Mouthfeel is a bit full and chewy. With a low ABV and subdued flavors this brew can definitely be sessioned."
"Drinkability is this beers middle name. I am very impressed with the malt profile of this offering. Tastes somewhere between an English Mild and an American Brown. I could definitely drink this one regularly."
"Drinkability is high. It's a tasty beer, approachable, and enjoyable. A mild rye, can't really complain about that."
"The beer tells the same story from the appearance and aroma to the taste and texture. Very consistant throughout and a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: Give me another!"
"Incredibly smooth and sessionable. I can't think of a goose island six pack I would rather drink."
"Overall, a surprisingly good beer for being so simple. A little on the sweet side, but extremely easy to drink."
"D- This is a definite session. Kind of wierd that they made this a winter seasonal. Its a GOOD beer. I will have several watching the Bears, but nothing really complex here."
"D - A really nice winter beer. The flavors complement the dishes of the season, and the woody-nutty flavors put fireside evenings in mind. Pretty good stuff!"
"Plenty of carbonation from this beer forms a white head that falls somewhat quickly leaving little bits of lace down the sides of the glass. There certainly is rye in this beer, as it shows up in the nose. The rye flavor is dominant, too. There are some background notes of caramel and spice; perhaps a touch of anise, but maybe that's just more of the rye. Feels much lighter bodied than it's alcohol content suggests. The rye shows up in the finish, too, which is laced with a potent enough somewhat minty bitterness that builds and is stretched out longer with each sip. Very drinkable and refreshing on a winter's day."
"Mouthfeel is light with a slight bite."
"Overall a tasty ale."
"Pours a slightly clouded amber brown. Creme head. Nose is exactly what I would think a mild to be. Full enough rye/grain character. Flavor brings a hearty rye flavor profile. It doesn't obliterate my mouth, but it's pleasant enough. Feel is smooth on liquid and the carbonation is middle of the road with a slight nip at the tongue. Mmmmm. This is a nice rye. I could go for several of these on a cold, snowy, miserable night. Or any other time for that matter."
"D - This is impressive. I hope it tastes this good with a little bit of time in the bottle. In a season full of spiced beers, it was very refreshing to try a beer going in a different direction. Everything a wonderfully balanced, with a nice, rich traditional malt complexity. Look forward to seeing this everywhere as the new winter seasonal."
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and creamy brew with excellent drinkability. the rye imparts a subtle spiced quality, along with great balance from start to finish. a great brew from Goose Island Clybourn. cheers!"
"D: A very nice rye beer. It's certainly no Red's Rye or Cane & Ebel but it does what it needs to do in a pretty unfussy manner."
