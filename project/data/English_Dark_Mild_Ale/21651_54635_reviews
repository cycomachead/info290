"Overall: I will admit this was my first beer from the brewery and my first English Dark Mild as well. I wasn't sure what to expect so I can't knock the beer for that. The aroma was the highlight for me, if it was replicated in the taste I would love this beer. I look forward to trying more from Eagle Rock, gotta support the LA area breweries!"

"I'm trying all of these low alcohol beers, which seem to be a nice experimental trend-- the search for great flavorful beers when you don't have time to sleep it off. Eagle Rock is doing a good job with the less powerful beers, but this is not one of my favorites. On tap at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach."

"The beer pours an inky black with trace tan head swirling around the glass circumference. The nose has subtle notes of roasted coffee beans, grains, and bitter cocoa. Hops don't enter the picture until I take my first sip, which resembles a mild porter with a grainy, roasty, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is definitely a malt forward, mild-medium bodied beer that opens up more as the beer trends towards room temperature. Tasty, drinkable, fairly priced, but unfortunately has difficult availability... I'd drink this beer again, but would let it warm up more before pouring."

"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced and very sessionable. Nice example of the style."

"Man, if the taste was half as good as the smell I would be trading for more. That said, I feel like this could be a world class mild with a small tweak. Would have again."

"I'm not nearly as into the co2 version, so I won't review it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Well carbonated. Pretty hefty for such a light beer."
"I really like this beer. I haven't tried any other English Dark Mild Ales, so there aren't any comparisons to make, but this beer has really grown on me. It pours a dark brown and has a small amount of head retention, with decent lacing as the beer is consumed. You are greeted with a nice roasted smell with notes of coffee, and a bit of chocolate. The taste is roasted malts with a coffee background. It tends to go away quickly, not a lot of aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pleasantly light, with soft carbonation. Some have described it as having a watered-down taste/feel, which is what I thought the first couple times I had it. However, since then, I really have noticed and begun to appreciate the malt flavors. If you weren't impressed with it the first time, I say give it another chance."

"Drink- This was strictly a style tick. Not a fan of the style. Its far too watery and light. I guess the profile just isnt for me."
"Pours a hazy dark brown with a solid 1/2 inch creamy tan head that lasts. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and some nutty aromas. Taste is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, and some minor coffee flavors. A mild roasty bitterness after each sip along with a slightly sour quality on the tongue. This beer has a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel from the nitro tap. Overall, this is a pretty good mild but the sour aspect got to bit too much towards the end of the pint."
"O: Really we need to see this style on cask, and we need to see more of it. A solid example of this rare (at least in the US) style."
"Overall: This beer is incredibly drinkable but that is about all it has going for it. Flavor is ok but nothing to write home about"
"Very nice session drinker."
"T: Day old coffee grounds, roasted malt and a touch of toffee with a slightly watery finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thin and a bit watery."
"O- this is a good session stout. Low alcohol. Very drinkable. But nothing remarkable here."
"O: I would have preferred this not be on nitrogen, but not much I can do about that."
"D/O: This beer offers some attractive features in a truly sessionable package. The smell is quite assertive and appetizing, like something that should accompany breakfast. The nitro propulsion smooths out the front end taste and feel, successfully re-tooling the acidity issues this beer has on draft. While underwhelming, the flavors remain just interesting enough to keep coming back for--and they never threaten to tax the palate, which is amenable to the sub-4% abv. In some respects it would be difficult to pick this out of a line-up of dry Irish stouts, although anyone with a decent sense of smell could probably figure it out."
"D: Because this is such a low ABV beer this could be drunk for hour and hours, it's a great session beer. I'd go back for more of this."
"This is a solid beer, and I like seeing a dark mild being brewed. I really would like to try this one on cask though."
"Mild chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Light body with a little bit of a bitter finish. I thought this was a real easy drinking beer, could drink all night."
"I really enjoy this beer. It was served to me at Tony's Darts Away in Burbank and was poured perfectly. Very dark in appearance with a thick, tan, creamy head. Chocolate and coffee smell but not a strong taste of it. Sweet and very mild going down. No bitterness at all. I could easily drink a few of these."
"Yum. Solidarity takes a different path from another local mild (Prohibition Mild), but end up with a similar amount of goodness."
"Didn't have any trouble finishing this beer, but I can't say I'm a fan."
"Had this on tap at the brewery. Poured a dark black color into pint glass. Light roasty smell. The taste of a roasted porter. Light in taste. Nice mouthfeel, not strong. Good drinkability, light enough to drink all night. This was the third beer I had after drinking Red Velvet and Revolution. This was very good as I wasn't expecting the roastiness of the flavor. Light enough to drink but with a very good taste."
"Overall, I found this to be a solid first effort from a new brewery, and a good representation of the style."
"While tasty, this comes across as more of a home-brew as it is a touch rough around the edges. Looking forward to seeing what Eagle Rock comes up with given more time..."
"This is a suprememly drinkable mild, hell my glass emptied itself a few times, cant wait to get a few growlers."
