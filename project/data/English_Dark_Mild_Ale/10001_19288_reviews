"It's not a beer that will be a showstopper, and I would say even the stylistic execution could be fine-tuned for some improvement, this is a bit minerally and a bit overly earthy, but overall it is well balanced and perfectly sessionable while delivering a a really nice malty flavour with hints of the hops and english yeast. Mild and unassuming, this makes a pretty solid session offering."

"According to the brewery's web site, HVD won gold medals at both the 2008 Canadian, and 2008 Ontario Brewing Awards."

"Overall - A fine brew that is well balanced and well-representative of the style. An obvious fairly local comparison is the Neustadt 10w30 and both stand up after further scrutiny as being really solid beers. I think I prefer this one a bit more mainly due to its pungent aromatics, but both are and enjoyable and affordable interpretation of the style."

"Extremely impressed by this for its large flavor and creamy body. Some cross off crazy porter brown ale with light mild character. Fantastic stuff."
""
""
"Oustanding smooth dark mild, a quaffable and well-balanced interpretation of the style."
""
"O - Drinkable but in part because it's a on the light side."
""
""
"Not a beer I buy often, but one I always enjoy and would recommend to any fan of North American takes on British ales."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"Light body, good carbonation."
""
"Final Thoughts: When I think of English Brown Ales, New Castle comes to mind. While Hockley Dark is in that same grain, it offers slightly less sweetness and a little more roughness on the palate. Overall, an interesting beer but not one that I would seek out again."
"Overall, another good beer from Hockley. I find it shares similar characteristics to their Black & Tan (this dark ale may have been used in that). This beer isn't spectacular but definitely above average."
""
"Overall impression was something of a Dark English Mild, mellow but with full bodied roast/coffee flavors. Aroma was soft and mild but carried some notes of dark roast and mild coffee. Dark in the glass but a light brown when poured from the can. Flavors were full and lightly roasty with some coffee and cocoa impressions. A light bitterness in the aftertaste from the roast, overall smooth and malty. A good beer i'd seek out while in Ontario, hopefully on cask or draft."

"Final Grade: 3.62, a B."
"Overall: Alright is the only word that comes to mind."

"A bit lighter than I expected, easily drinkable, and a solid dark ale."
"Overall, I always suspected this to be a stout, though its actually a well crafted mild brown, certainly more English as is found in plenty of Ontario breweries beers. I found it drinkable but not really something I will pick up often which is unfortunate seeing as its the local brewery in a small town."
"O/D - Hockley seems to make some quality classic styles. Easy drinking, flavourful, and interesting. The rich malt character is appropriate for the cooler weather these days. I like it."
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation."
"O - another decent easy drinking brew by Hockley - not overly complex however it does not claim to be"
"Not bad, but not enough body to back up the pungent smell. Pretty easy drinking and would make a good steak and potatoes accent."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights, minimal white head around the edges. Smell is dark fruit and raisin with roasted malt, though the roasted character is quite minimal and IMO not as upfront as it should be, faint notes of alcohol come and go. Roasted malt, light astringent notes, chocolate and coffee take shape and battle it out and is really apparent in the finish and aftertaste along with a roasty smoke. Carbonation is a touch high here, light feel but medium body. Not bad overall finishes stronger than how it starts."
"Solid English style dark ale."
"definitely my favourite of their offerings so far."
"D: Very sessionable, though that's in part because it's rather light for a brown ale. Hockley describes it as a cross between the Northern brown ale and the Midlands mild; I'd say it's quite an enjoyable twist on the style."
"D: I enjoyed this beer. The one complaint I have is that it's a bit light. On Hockley's website they say they ""tweaked the body slightly to give it a lighter, more North American appeal."" I wish it had a fuller body and taste. The light body keeps making you come back for more to make up for the lightness and you end up finishing the can rather quickly. Overall still a good beer."
"Drink - The beer really does have a nice appearance, and it is a really easy drinking beer. I could definitely session this one and I'm happy I tried it."
"Quite light really. Moderate carbonation. Very sessionable."
"Also from the CAN: ""mild, light body, full flavour"" and ""Proudly Craft Brewed in Ontario, CANada"". CANadian CANned beer, CAN you dig it?"
"d-pretty drinkable...not much to it IMO."
"Pours an amber-brown colour that starts off with thick white head. Head dissipates and leaves a small ring, with a tiny bit of lacing. Smells of grain and bready malts, with some sweet fruit. Taste is very sweet and malty. Carbonation level is good, with smooth mouthfeel, though maybe a little bit thin body. An ok beer for the style."
"D - Not overly drinkable. Pretty much every English beer should be a session beer, so a little disappointing here. Would have liked to see a bit lower alcohol on this which would be true to style, although it fits in the Northern English Brown category."
"Edit: Crap, I got it in a can, not a bottle."
"D - a little thinner than I expected but not in a bad way, the flavours are balanced well, could probably enjoy a few of these but not a full session"
"D- I would have no problem having a few pints of this over the course of an evening. A perfect session beer but would also be nice with food. I recommend this brew for any beer drinker, and think it would be a good way to get into a darker beer."
"A pretty decent brown ale, well balanced between the sweet, savoury and crisp British bitter notes. A prime candidate for sessioning, no matter where you are in this broadly spanning country of ours."
"A very pleasant beer to drink."
"All together just a well made English Brown. Doesn't stray from the style, and doesn't come up short either."
"ETA: I'm just noticing that the lowest grade for this beer is a B- and the highest is a B+. I guess the next step is to work out if being consistently above average and just below excellence right across the board is necessarily something to be proud of? Whatever the case, it seems at least somewhat remarkable to have this much of a consensus with not a single champion or detractor in the midst."
"A very drinkable Ontario dark, one of the better ones available on the market. The taste could have been a bit fuller, and I'm confused about the lack of head, but still, I'll get this one again."
"maybe Hockely ships the 'whoops the brewmaster slept in' brew in cans to Alberta ( the land of Bud light, etc)"
"This was too meek in every aspect. The brewery does not apologize this, believing that their original recipe had to be ""tweaked"" to give it a ""lighter"" appeal. No. Bad idea Hockley Valley. I think you might have gotten things backwards - this needs to be heavier. If it were just that little bit more malty and just that little bit less plain, it might just be an outstanding beer. As it is, I'm tweaking my scores to reflect a lighter amusement."
"I will drink this again for the price its a pretty good value"
"D - Quite good, as long as it does not warm up too much or becomes flat. Obviously, this is more of a session beer than a beer to be savoured for too long."
"M - This is what hurts this good tasting beer. It's thin like a watery syrup once it goes flat. I hope future batches are better."
" Coffee flavours with a slight caramel, followed by a very light flavouring and a very strong carbonation reminding me of 7up with a slightly bitter aftertaste! Doubt I would buy this one again, but can't say it was bad enough that I didn't finish it!"
"A pretty good brown/dark ale, I'd consider buying it again if I wanted something in the style."
"A very sessionable brown ale."
"Good balance of flavor, another nice suprise from a can."
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty decent brew. Very well balanced and not too sweet. Mild, yes; light bodied; yes, full flavoured; not so much. The only downside to this beer was that it seemed too watered down. There is plenty of room to pack some more malt and chocolate into the taste. Nicer head retention would have been nice too. Nonetheless, I wouldn't refuse another if offered."
"This was a decent beer... by no means my favourite, but I can see why it was the overall winner. I vastly preferred the corporal's bitter brown, but the high hopping of that brew made for a love/hate experience. The Hockley, on the other hand, had a pleasant balance of flavours that made for excellent sessionability. It surprised me, and I guess that's a good thing!"
"D: Overall this is a good beer. Nothing that I'd actively seek out but much better than many offerings at the LCBO."
"Hockley Valley Dark is an opportunity lost for HVB & MC. Well, maybe not quite lost, but unsure how to get home and too proud to ask for directions. There's definitely some potential here."
"This beer has a smooth but thin mouthfeel, overall this it lacks carbonation, more complex flavour and body."
"Will buy again."
"I tried this beer on June 7, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a very dark translucent brown, with some reddish hints. The head was tan coloured, and lasted. The aroma was roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, creamy, with a sour hint. The flavour was roasted malt, dry cocoa, and a little bit of sourness and bitterness covering the tongue."
"Definitely drinkable and a nice brew."
"Overall I really liked this beer. I haven't had enough English dark ales to compare it with (although I quite like Newcastle) but I've been inspired to try and find more."
"More remeniscent of a dark ale than a brown, yet either way the malts still rule the roost on this one."
"Good dark ale with plenty of drinkability for the style and alcohol."
"At first glance, this is a frightening beer. It's the colour of prune juice, but with foam on top!!!! I don't know why that's the image I got, other than talking to my grandmother before trying this. She loves prunes. Fortunately, it improves from there. Smells of burnt whole grain toast, milk chocolate(not dark), coffee, toffee, grass and a bit of I believe brown sugar. Tastes great. Roasted malts and coffee dominate, blending with some sweetened chocolate, caramel, plums, figs and raw earth. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth and crisp, with a medium body. Definitely a good beer. I shall buy it again and give it a proper review. Hopefully, the second time, I can find a better appearance description than prune juice."

"Great flavor on the tongue. Dark fruits, molasses, the hops are just noticeable but play there part, leaving behind some earthy grass essences. A definite go to session beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to sit down with as long as you’re all right with the sweetness of it. I’ve had better in the style but it’s still a very good beer."
"Santé"
"Pours a dark brown body with a thin beige head. Lots of carbonation going on here in the body though. Looks like cola. Aromas are faint malt, coffee, smokey, and caramel. Tastes like coffee, balanced with some sweet malt and some mild nut flavours. FInish is smooth, leaving a nice malt aftertaste. Well done! A lot more enjoyable than the organic lager!"
"Swing-top liter bottle as pictured, taped seal hand-dated ""10/05/06"""
"I brought this back from Toronto. Nice puffy cola-colored head but it dissipates quickly. Aroma contained a nice light mild hop aroma, slightly malty with a faint hint of coffee. Very nice ale and the first taste on the palate was hops but was well-combined with the malt flavors. Malt was light in body but present. Good mild bitterness blends with the malt to the finish. A vigorous froth gives a nice bittersaweet mouthfeel. I liked this ale, actually quaffable in my book."
"I enjoy this one quite a bit. It goes the extra distance without trying to be too explosive or too showy. Good to have on a warm summer night on the patio."
"A very well rounded offering from Hockley. Pours out to a deep ruby color that appears coffee black. Medium low carbonation. Small head of brownish white foam dissipated rather quickly. Aromas of roasted malts and cocoa, with some dark unsweetened chocolate notes. A touch of mild bourbon. Nice. Taste is medium bodied and very enjoyable; roasted malts, mild chocolate, a touch of sweet grain, caramel and the hops are even noted, playing a well founded evening role. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a touch creamy. Drinkability is rather good. One of the better Brown Ales i've had. Recommended."
"Pours a deep brown with plenty of ruby highlights and a well formed two finger head that lasts well and leaves some good lacing. Smells of nuts and cocoa, with a pleasant sweet maltiness and just a touch of bittering hops in the background. Taste is quite full, with more roasted chocolate and a touch of coffee accompanied by a very nice nuttiness and a kiss of hops in the finish, which is nice and long. Mouthfeel is thick and substantial, and well carbonated as well, and drinkability is quite good. A very good session ale, which would, I'm sure, become a staple if it were available here. As it is I have to thank pootz for this very appreciated part of the CANBIF2 package."
"I rather quite enjoyed this beer even if it does have more hop presence than I've come to expect from a brown ale. With the 5% alcohol, lighter body and fairly balanced flavour, this could be a good session beer."
"D -"
"A very nice product."
"Mouthfeel is good - a slight overcarbonation to the brew, but a substantial body that I rather enjoy drinking. It lacks the smoothness of an oatmeal stout (though I only say that because it's my only comparison as a young beer advocate), but still very good. I don't know about drinkability; I doubt I could have more than one or two of these without feeling a little... icky (for lack of a better word), but as an occasional thing, I must say that Hockley Valley Dark is a pleasant surprise and a winner."
"Surprisingly delicious. Looks like A fine pint of stout. Smells absolutely amazing. Hints of berries and mocha, and something that somewhat resembles chicory. Taste has hints of mocha, a slight astringent, and an aftertaste that is of lightly roasted grains. Mouthfeel is bold, slightly carbonsated. Quite nice. Pretty drinkable, pretty heavy, not a session beer, but makes for an excellent after-dinner apertif."
"Love those Ontario craft breweries!"
"I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes British or Irish style beers. Somewhat like Guiness, but since Guiness isn't for everyone, this goes down easily without a strong taste."
"Mouthfeel is very dry and pleasant -- my favourite aspect of this beer. Hockley Valley Dark is pleasantly bitter, and goes great with salty food (I had mine with fried ham and home fries -- yum!)"
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark color ale with nice foamy dark brown head with good retention. Aroma of English malt with floral undertone is easily distinguishable. Taste is very refreshing wit a good roasted malt presence and a bitter finish with a good balance of what seems like English hops. Body is a bit thin but overall this is a very enjoyable drink."
"Overall this is a good Brown Ale worth trying. Its got lots of flavor but could use a little more body."
"Pours a super dark brown. Medium tan head. No carbonation. The nose was decent, some nice roasted malts, a pinch of coffee and cocoa. Taste was mild up front. The roasted malts seemed to peak through nicely mid-sip and lingered quite well, although subtle. Again, i found some traces of cocoa towards the finish. Mouthfeel light and smooth. A pleasant warmth to the beer. I found that the flavours of this beer seemed more pronounced long after a sip had been swallowed. It grew on me as i progressed through the glass. Nice drinkability. Smooth, light bodied but warm with a decent malt backbone."
"Very drinkable."
"Comfortable to drink, but not especially exciting. Nothing really to make me want to go out and buy this one again, I'm afraid."
"Just picked this one up at the LCBO, quite an attractive bottle. Poured out of 1L growler, beer was a rich dark reddish brown, with lots of whitish head. I have a cold so it didn't really smell like much, as little hoppy and metallic though. The taste was a little too light as well, but a bitter nutty flavour and a little chocolate were present. However the taste did get better with every sip. The mouthfeel was too light for me, seemed watered down. Altogether an average beer, I thought it has high drinkability but is pretty pricey to buy on a regular basis. Worth a try though, I thought it was pretty decent."
"A decent microbrew, somewhat of an experiment to juice up an ordinary dark beer that works. Carbonation was cheap and on less pleasant and less drinkable side, bit novice beer drinkers I shared this large minimum magnum with went with the cocoa and carmel sweetness. Long aftertaste."
"1 L brown swing top bottle, no freshness date."
"If you bike, mail me Ill send you a map to scoot in to the Hockley brewery with some lovely winding roads."
