3.4,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"An awful lot of cases of canned dark mild, straight from Merry Ol'. Right on. This stuff pours a clear russet topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises mild walnuts, light rye bread, toffee, and a hint of tea. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a slight bit of blunt fruit in the background, possibly the byproduct of some tea or coffee acridness. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little mild, if nothing all that outstanding for the style.

Taste of caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, chocolate, biscuit, nuttiness, earth, light raisin, and herbal spiciness. Very light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, earth and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Some decent flavor balance with a fair amount of flavor overall. No cloying flavors at all. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is good. No alcohol noticed other than a minimal warming after the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink as expected. Overall this is a nice mild. Nice fairly robust flavors; and very smooth to drink.

And since I'm reviewing a British beer, my spelling of flavour is finally appropriate. Har har. There's lots of chocolate flavour and dark malty flavour. And the bitterness adds to it nicely. Not overpowering at all. The thinness makes it both flavourful and refreshing at the same time. It's a very interesting approach to a dark beer. I see why it's called mild. Really good stuff. It's much less boring than I expected. From the looks of the can, I imagine this stuff is pretty cheap in England. Which is a shame. I wish I could buy it more regularly here, but it's a bit pricey for such a mild ale. Still, well worth a try. Don't be put off by it being mild or the thinness. It'll surprise you. I've had other regional 3.2% beers in England and a lot of them are low in carbonation and taste watery or just too lacking in flavour to make up for that low alcohol content.

Very thin body with lots of carbonation and a very (very) dry finish that almost made your mouth feel dry... perhaps that was deliberate (makes you drink more).

3.1,-14.4,4,4,2.5,3,3,"O: Too bad about the metal bit, that really drags it down. Had a lot going for it up until that point. Well, give it a try, maybe I got a bad batch. Can't go higher than three here. Cheers!","AmericanGothic","Mar 22, 2011"
1.96,-45.9,3.5,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,"Thin bodied and watered down with a very weak malt presence countered by faint earthy hops and zesty spice. Overcarbonated with more spicy pepper than anything else. As n the aroma, this is still pretty bland even as it warms with only faint hints of chocolate, hazelnut and caramel countered by earthy/grassy hops. Not interesting at all and hard to choke down. I bought an Imperial pint but it would have been tough to even finish a half.","corby112","Feb 03, 2011"
3.92,8.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A half-imperial pint serving from Dandelion in Philly. Totally black in color with a brief beige head. Foam dissipated quickly. No lacings or cap. Burnt malt and caramel aromas with a slight hint of coffee. On the lighter side of medium bodied with very lght carbonation. Smooth and refreshing feel. Dark roasted malt and burnt malt flavors in the beginning with a brief caramel malt middle and finish. Finished dry with no bitter hop character. Very easy to drink. A nice low ABV option with lots of character for a mild ale.","IronLover","Jan 05, 2011"
3.76,3.9,4,3,4,4,4,"O - One of the best EDM's I've had yet. It's a fairly complex and interesting mild brew. Pleasure to drink. I love the fact that I can literally have ten of these due to drinkability and a 3.2% ABV. I would love to try this on cask.","PreacherBrewer","Dec 30, 2010"

3.82,5.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Beer is thin and has a nice roastiness to the back of it. Unfortunately for it, I've had better milds recently. Beer is all around good, but I have a hard time picking up the flavors at the front of the beer, there is only a mild sweetness, nothing else really. I'd have it again, the low ABV makes it possible to drink 10 of them in one sitting, but I've definitely had better milds.","drabmuh","Aug 02, 2006"
3.78,4.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer from Cains is what Milds should taste like, witha lovely subtile sweetness and a hint of coffee and the apperance is a darkish brown and a coffee like smell. I have to say this is one of the best Milds i've tried and would be happy to drink a few again.","blamoe","Feb 17, 2005"
4.18,15.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Other comments: THIS is a Mild! Text-book definition. OK, well, a Mild doesn't have to be dark anymore, but that's what it was traditionally and that's the way it damn well should be (in my book). Really hits the spot! Roger Protz rates this as one of his ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die"". Some of his picks are a bit questionable, but this one I can definitely agree with.","GreenCard","Sep 27, 2003"
4.8,32.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Cask @ Dr. Duncans, Liverpool. Dark nearly opaque black with crimson edges. No real foam to see here as this is a cask conditioned brew. The aromas are so intense and insane for a 3.2 brew. OMG, how do they get so much into a 3.2 brew. Sugar, molasses, some spirt-like flavors, dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, plums, caramel, and mroe. The taste is excellent with a lovely maltiness, and some chocolate, coffee, and fruit flavors all over the place. The moufheel is smooth and lovely and the drinkability is awesome. This is just incredible when it is fresh and on cask. Surely, one of the finest, if not the finest example of this sadly underbrewed style of beer.","francisweizen","Beers"
3.44,-5,5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Stout like appearance, deep black, with a fluffy/foamy head, looks great. Soft and light, yet, with quite a full mouthfeel, slightly acidic bitterness, some grapeyness/raisins, some nice soft roastyness, generally pretty nice, soft, round (cask-GBBF 03')","rastaman","0"
