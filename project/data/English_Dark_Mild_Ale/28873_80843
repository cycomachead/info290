4.17,-0.2,4.5,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured from tap into pint at 1702 Tucson. Pours a deep brown amber with nice creamy bead. Not much aroma here...some slight sweet malt and bitter hop with a bit of roastedness. Taste is really nice. Almost coffee roasted malts and sweet malts nicely balanced with some hop bitterness. Really smooth and definitely a session brew. Nice job and a good representation of the style...especially for being this far from England and in the desert.","DrinkSlurm","Dec 01, 2012"

4.13,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I've been waiting a long time for someone to brew a Dark Mild around here, and while it's not quite the ideal strength (around 3% ABV), I think it'll do just fine. Looking forward to drinking more of this as well as anything else this fine new brewery has to offer.","bennetj17","Beers"
4.19,0.2,5,4,4,4.25,4.5,"The chewy texture, ample malt flavor, balance between dark malt and sweetness, and quaffability make this a great beer for pairing with food. I could wish for something closer to 4% in strength (in fact I always prefer my own milds to be under 4%), but I could see the low alcohol perhaps being a harder sell for your typical craft beer drinker. In truth though, I am really quite enjoying this beer & I wonâ€™t mind in the least that I have a couple pints of this. I really wish this style of beer was a lot easier to get; I really hope this does well here in Tucson, it would be nice to have this as an easy option when going out to dinner around town. I will always have soft spot for milds as they were one of those styles that I had to brew myself in order to actually try the style for the first time.","Gueuzedude","0"
