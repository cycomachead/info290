"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, sweet, some chocolate. Taste is bready, malts, nutty, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Dark Mild Ale great tasting"

"Flavors are light and almost lacking. I get a slight nuttiness and roasty element on the palate, but the light body is deceiving. There’s enough taste here to remain drinkable and sessionable. This one is faithful to the classic English brown ale style, and pretty decent."

"Overall: A quite enjoyable session-brown ale from NOLA. A good beer to have around and something I will keep in my fridge for sure."
""

"O- A pretty flavorful malty session beer. In some circles, it's referred to as the ""slow down brown"" due to the low amount of alcohol."

"O - Overall, pretty average english ale here. Not much going for it truthfully."

"Pours a ruby-tinged brown with a very thin head. Smells like caramel, toast and chocolate. Smell a bit of gummy bears in there too. Flavor is up front pale malts with a smack of the dark malts thrown in the mix (toast and chocolate). Hop presence is very subdued. Finishes with an interesting tartness, but way too much jelly in the finish. Jelly kills it. Is this made by Saint Arnold??? Mouthfeel could be fuller and with more subdued carb. Overall, this can be pounded at this abv, but it's lacking finesse all around. Too much jelly flavor. Weird."

"O: Overall not bad, but nothing amazing. Love gravity, some nice dark malt character, although I wish there was a little more flavor."

"Poured from tap intp pint at The Pickle in shreveport, LA. Pours a deep brown with just a bit of foamy head. Nice sweet nutty malty aroma, with slight hop presence. Taste is very nutty, malty, sweet, but mild. Really well balanced and nice sweet malty flavors. I really enjoy the nutty malts in this. Its a super smooth brew with great body...very well balanced. Nice."

"O: NOLA Brown is clearly NOLA's answer to Abita Amber, another local session dark. It has a nice initial punch of flavor for a session beer, but the feel and back-end taste are clearly off."

"O:  Not a huge fan on brown ales but it was good.  The sweet dairy taste was almost upsetting.  The beer has great flavor for a session beer and has good drink ability. "
"Overall a great beer. Probably my favorite beer in this category out of our great state. Will definitely pick it up often and really gives me a good opinion of NOLA. Cheers!"

"This is my first English Dark Mild Ale, but I think a label like ""American Mild Brown"" would be more fitting. It's like a brown ale, just lighter. There are some weird things in the flavor, but ultimately this is good. This is designed to be a session beer, and it definitely serves that purpose. For that, it gets a bump in its overall score."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown with a fluffy tan head that retains well, but there isn't much lacing. There appears to be plenty of carbonation. There's an aroma of dark roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is fairly mild. There are flavors of dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and slightly nutty. It has a pleasant sweet flavor. The aftertaste is not strong. The mouthfeel is light, clean, and slightly creamy. It's very easy to gulp. Overall, this is a good beer. It's easily sessionable and I could see myself knocking back a few pints of this."
"A very well rounded beer. Gives a nice aftertaste of toasted bread and hints of cocoa. Goes down easy with plenty of flavor. You could put a few of these away."

"O: Pretty damn good out of the can. Really different from the tap."
"Very interesting and dark version of a brown."
"This beer tasted like the crust from a pie my grandmother used to make. I enjoyed this quite a bit. I didn't think the sweetness was a negative aspect at all. The mouthfeel was good to go along with the sweetness. It was sweet, but not cloyingly sweet. It finished dry and quickly enough to not cause aversion."
"I have had two excellent beers from NOLA, but this is a major let down. Not something I would recommend."
"Overall: This is not a bad beer, but it really did not stick out much either. I could session, but after being blown away by Flambeau Red, this was a let down. I will pass on this in the future and get the red."
"D - come on...3.9% alcohol. Its amazingly drinkable. Tasty and light."
"D. Supremely drinkable. I'd finish a growler of this."
"D-very drinkable. Went back for more soon after. Very nice session beer!"
"Pours a reddish brown with very little head. not much head but a bit. Kinda looks like coke almost. Smells very good. A very nice smelling beer. Lots of roasted malts on the nose. Tastes great. Lots of roasted malts. A bit smokey. Great mouthfeel and highly drinkable. A solid Brown Ale for sure. First time this dark of a beer has been such a sessionable beer!"
"Not a bad brown, but nothing special. Served with a nice creamy, fine, light tan head and some lace. Color was a clear dark, garnet brown. Traditonal nut brown flavor witha bit of dark, ripe fruit and a bit of acid. Body was a tad thin and carbonation was a little fizzy. Roasty, slightly sweet finish of medium length."
"Note on 11/9/10: I received an e-mail from the brewery concerning this review. They stated that it sounded like a an issue with the carbonation level of the beer and invited me to try some directly from the brewery next time I am in the area. Props to them for pro-active customer service. I will definitely try some more of their beer next time I am down south."
"O I'ts an OK beer. To be honest I don't really don't see the appeal of this particular beer. I don't think I'll be having another."
"I would definitely have this beer again - it was served up with a spicy plate of Red Beans and Rice. This beer would be great for any spicy dish."
"D: Good but could have been a bit more bitter, it tasted rather average."
"Fairly nutty, mild tobacco leaf dryness, husky malts. Somewhat crisp with a slight bite. Ample carbonation, almost a touch too much for a Mild Ale. Still, it's a simple yet refreshing beverage that I enjoyed drinking."
"D - Very drinkable at 3.9%, but not super-interesting. If I were in Louisiana I'd stick to the Blonde I think. This was actually the growler that kicked last at a party I held recently."
"On tap at The Avenue Pub in New Orleans Feb 10, 2010. Pours a dark brown with slight beige head. good dark malts of caramel, chocolates and some nuts. Medium body and carbonation - good finish. Very drinkable and satisfying. Nice offering in my humble opinion - cheers!"
"The mouthfeel was very light, but lends itself to a top-notch session brew."
"D: If I lived in the area, I could drink this ALL THE TIME. Excellent flavor and über-sessionable strength. Honestly thought this was a 'bigger' dark lager (schwarzbier or similar); what a surprise! The type of beer I thoroughly enjoyed, my sometimes-finicky beer-loving wife approved of, and my beer-novice brother proclaimed as 'REALLY good' (a night after he'd completely rejected my similar choice from Abita). I'd say NOLA has a winner with this one."

"Overall a lot lighter than it looks, very easy to drink, and a good value as well."
"Light to medium body with light carbonation. Light, enjoyable and easy to drink. Overall, this isn't very complex, it actually seems like a pretty basic brown. But it is done right, very solid and satisfying all around and quite sessionable. A great go to beer if in the mood for this style."
"D - Very good American Brown Ale, this would be my go-to beer when i'm in the mood for this style. It is on the lighter side but that is quite all right when you are drinking in this hot Louisiana weather."
"You could session this beer. It comes across that light."
"D: I could've had several of these beers if I had time to be their longer. Great effort, as I couldn't ask for more from a local brewer."
"As a side note, I had this at Lager's in Metairie & it was closer to what other reviewers describe. When I had it at the Barley Oak it wasn't even like the same beer, so something's wrong over there."
"This is a brand new brewery, not sold by bottle yet, and is only sold in New Orleans. and its the only brewery currently located in the city limits of New Orleans. Its a brewery that represents the rebuilding of the city, and the movement to make the Big Easy the beer capital of the South once again!"
"D 4.0 - An all around good brew, even better that it is brewed locally. Support local beer, try a NOLA Brown!"
"Drinkability/Overall: An excellent brown ale that's slightly atypical for the style. It's lighter in body and alcohol compared to most brown ales, yet has richer, more roasted malt flavors that linger and remain more pronounced than the roasted nut flavors. It's very sessionable because of the body and alcohol, yet doesn't taste like a ""session beer."" Overall, it's an excellent brown ale for rich, buttery New Orleans food and the hot, humid, sticky climate of the region. I could drink this all day and not get bogged down, despite the excellent, rich flavor."
"Overall- Finally a wonderful beer to replace the boring Abita. This beer along with their Blonde has become my everyday beer when I go to bars."
"D - Call me a homer, but look at my Abita reviews before you do, this beer was fantastic. The taste was great, a well crafted and flavorable Brown Ale that will become a staple in my draft diet, until they release the bottles."
