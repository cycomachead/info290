Light to moderate bodied. I was facing this ale with some trepidation because of the ABV, but I am quite pleased at the eveness and flavor combination of this ale.

3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"500 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear (when held up to the light) dark brown/ruby red color with about a half inch light tan head that stays around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is charred/burnt malt, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also an earthy flavor noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin but also a bit slick. Moderate carbonation. It's pretty easy to drink, I think it's a great choice for a session beer.

Smells of dark malt, slight chocolate, and some roasty notes. Taste is of roasted malt, cold coffee, and slight chocolate on the finish. There is a very slight bitterness on the palate after each sip that fades quickly. This beer has very light carbonation with a very watery mouthfeel. I am not too impressed with this aspect of the beer. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and the first of the style I have had.

3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a Coca-Cola brown in color with red highlights. Once fully poured it resembles a dark, dark brown on the verge of black with a one finger, frothy cream colored head. It smells of lightly roasted malts, light coffee with cream, and possibly even espresso. It kind of smells like a frapuccino and it tastes like an iced coffee. It is overly drinkable and is a great session beer, fit for a pub. It drinks light to medium in body, more reminiscent of an iced coffee, which is fine. The aftertaste does the light mouthfeel some justice. All in all this beer was pretty impressive. It's hard to find a quality session beer but this one seems to pull it off and even has good flavor. It's worth a try.","aasher","Jun 01, 2011"

Light amount of lacing is left on the glass. Wonderful aroma of chocolate malt and Fuggle hops. Classic English Ale aroma that I absolutely love. The malt and hops work perfectly together in the flavor as well. Notes of chocolate with some herbs and earth. A nice body for such a light beer. Feels much stronger than what it is. A beer cannot get much more drinkable than this. A relatively harmless ABV but still wonderfully flavorful. American brewers could learn much from this beer.","morimech","Jun 27, 2010"
3.9,1.8,3,3,4,4,5,"Deep chestnut color. Some head and lacing. Not much aroma wise-mildly metallic and tinge of sweet, caramel like aromas. Very solid malty flavor. Again a trace of caramel like sweetness. Just enough hop bite to be noticed. Toasted and nutty goodness to be found in here. Very solid mouthfeel for the style. Wow-what a boat load of flavor for such a low abv beer. The Brits really know how to do it well. Just great in general.","lackenhauser","Jun 26, 2010"

Richly malty with caramel and a hint of cocoa, perhaps a touch of English hops as well. As far as taste goes, this is probably as much flavor as you can pack into a very low abv beer. Rich and smooth with a hint of chocolate but ample bread and a touch of bittering in the finish, this drinks extremely easily but will probably never cause your palate fatigue.

3.6,-6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a deep brown color with a smallish soapy tan head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is sweet with toffee and a coffee candy. Almost smells like kaluha. The taste is of coffee with mineral water added to water it down. The coffee flavor is nice but light. There is some grain flavors, with toffee sweetness. Pretty good flavors for a low abv brew. The feel is very light and water with fizzy carbonation, almost seems like I am drinking carbonated water with coffee flavoring. Drinks very easy as there is not much body to this brew. I can see why these are session brews.","Gmann","Mar 06, 2010"

4.25,11,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Not exactly black, but almost. More of a cola, red, actually, with a beige, unremarkable head. Smoke billows out from this ale, with a lovely charred wood aroma mingled with a bit of buckwheat honey and raisins, as well as mocha, nuts, and resinous hops. It tastes how it smells: smoky yet fruity and light. It is an odd, but delicious, duck. (Speaking of, it would probably be excellent with duck.) Burnt marshmallow plus hickory and raisins on in the center ring, with other dark notes of cola and cocoa in the periphery. Mysteriously complex. As for mouthfeel, I can't decide if it's pleasantly dry, or a touch too light on the palate... but I'm afraid it may be the latter. Overall it is a very interesting ale, and what an achievement for 3.4%! Must try with all manner of cheese and meat.","soulgrowl","May 03, 2009"

There are some watery toasted nut flavors, coffee, chocolate, molasses, sweetish malts, and maybe a bit of hop presence in the finish. This is a bit of a disappointment, but with a 3.4% ABV, I guess this is what you get. The beer is moderately carbonated and the mouthfeel is very light.","albern","Aug 10, 2008"

Nothing too big, but still very flavorful. Feel is on the light end of moderate, with a moderate carbonation. It works well with the lighter flavors and low alcohol. Overall, I think this one is very well built. Being a subtle beer, there is nowhere for flaws to hide, but I don't find any in it.

The beer pours a bit thin, with little head, but has a wonderful black color with ruby highlights if you hold it up to a light. The beer has a subtle aroma, with a hint of malt and roastiness. The flavor is dominated by roasty bitterness, but it is not as intense as a Murphy's Stout (for example). There is also a soft maltiness and slight sweetness to provide balance. Overall the lightness of the beer is evident but it is certainly not a light beer! The back label says they use English malt, roasted malt, sugar and hops to make it. The sugar probably lightens it up a little but this is definitely a flavorful beer, and it would be a great thirst-quencher. This is the only non-homebrewed ""mild"" I've had and this particular one strikes me as a light-bodied porter.","KroMagnon","Jan 08, 2004"
3.92,2.3,4,4.5,3.5,3,4.5,"This is an interesting beer. At first glance and swallow, it seems to be a porter but ends up being closer to a mild. I don't know much about milds but I am guessing this is a particularly dark and roasty one. Poured perfectly into a 20oz glass with creamy, rising head that eventually dwindled to a small ring. Not much lacing. Very appealing aroma with mixture of burnt roastiness, a light yeasty fruitiness, and a malty graham cracker flavor that is unmistakeably British. Flavor is a little difficult to grasp, at first it seems watery and thin with a metallic undertaste. As the beer warms and the palate gets accustomed to it, some more appealing flavors jump out. You REALLY need to let this one warm up to cellar or even room temperature. Remarkably fruity, with some coffee/burnt flavors at the edges. Mouthfeel watery but somehow it works. This would be a great breakfast beer to go along with crispy toast and fruit jams. ABV is thankfully low, a refreshing change of pace from US beers which are 5% or higher.","Thrasher","Jan 07, 2004"
4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Best enjoyed at just below cellar temperature, this brilliant dark ale pours a clear, deep mahogany with ruby-crimson highlights beneath a short head of creamy tan foam. The retention is fair, and it receeds to a decent collar and thin surface covering while still leaving specks and spots of lace throughout most of the glass. An initial whiff of roastiness fades to reveal bittersweet chocolate and a touch of creamy caramel alongside dark dried fruits (prunes, raisins) in the nose. The body is medium-light and it's gently crisp on the tongue with a fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that softens as it warms. The flavor delivers everything that the nose promises; and although it's fairly basic, it's also quite charming. There's a delicate touch of leafy/earthy hops that becomes apparent, and the way that the chocolate, caramel, and subtle roasty flavors come and go as the beer warms is interesting. It's exceptionally well-balanced by a sublime bitterness that never really reveals itself, even in the short and dry finish. Quaffable! An excellent session ale that offers a great amount of flavor with some variety and complexity to it, but only 3.4% alcohol! Brilliant!","NeroFiddled","Dec 23, 2003"

3.13,-18.3,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"16oz bottle. Dark brown with caramel edges. Thick tan head with decent lacing. Has a malty nutty aroma with a hint of cocoa. Thin palate with a metallic flavor. Has a light roasted malt flavor but really weak and watered down. Not anything outstanding.","BierReise","Nov 14, 2003"
2.58,-32.6,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours a dark brown with a nice head that doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. I was disappointed to learn that this brew only had 3.4% abv, so this may skew my rating. The aroma was a bland dark malt, but nothing much more. The mouthfeel is thin as the beer seems a little watered down. Pretty bland overall. The flavor didn't show me much - hints of chocolate and roasted malts, but nothing to write home about.","clvand0","Nov 12, 2003"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"On cask in Twickenham. This is a dark amber beer with a nice white head. The aromas are of dark fruits, and bitter-roasted malts. The taste is fruity, malty, and bit hoppy. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is excellent! A classic UK real ale!","francisweizen","Nov 05, 2003"
3.38,-11.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a rich deep black with a light creamy head. Aroma of roasted malt and sweet treacle. Licorice/anise flavor blends with the roasted malt, and a bit more sugary treacle. A bit thin, which actually doesn't make it more drinkable. Kind of odd mouthfeel, but it still has a very nice flavor and looks beautiful.","ElGordo","Nov 04, 2003"
2.84,-25.8,4.5,3,3,2.5,2,"A beauty to behold in the glass - black with a slight, creamy head. Malty, yet a bit thin at the same time. Roasted malt with a bit of scorched brown sugar. Perhaps a bit of oxidation in the mix. A bit watery for the style. I'm not terribly impressed.","Brent","Oct 27, 2003"
3.6,-6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The aroma is the best thing about the bottle I sampled. It has a chocolate/winey aroma. The flavor is chocolate/treacle and the finish is dry and bitter. The body is fairly thin, probably due to the low alcohol content. I expected more flavor in the beer.","GCBrewingCo","Oct 24, 2003"
4.08,6.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Touted as a ""black ale"" as per the bottle, this beer pours a nice dark, opaque brown with a thin head that dissapates relatively quickly with little lacing. Aroma is sweet with light roasted notes. Flavors are all very subtle, and do not really become pronounced until the beer warms up a bit. Sweet malts give way to a nice mellow roasted barley with some coffee and other roasted flavors. Lots of character for such a low alcohol brew. AB could learn a thing or two from our friends ""across the pond"".","TripelJ","Oct 11, 2003"
2.96,-22.7,4,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Eclipse black color, medium creamy white head. Aroma is mildly of roasted malts. The dark black color belies the mild taste of the beer. Mild malts, mild hops, mild flavor and mild alcohol. Flavors are chocolate and mildly roasted malts. Mild tasting beer, that adheres to its style well. Lots of flavor for a 3.4% alcohol beer, but the 3.4 % does cause it to be a little watery. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Sep 02, 2003"
3.32,-13.3,5,3,3,4,3.5,"A medium sized tan, creamy head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles.The body was dark brown and the lacing was fair.The nose was chocolate and the flavor was mild coffee and sweet chocolate.The mouthfeel of this beer was smooth, tingly, thin, watery and light bodied.There was a slight aftertaste observed with this beer.","hotstuff","Aug 07, 2003"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a cool beer, no question. Oddly, it suffers as people tend to think of it as a gag beer for halloween. This is one of the few dark beers that I would describe as refreshing. It pours an almost coca cola color with sweet molasses notes showing up on the palate and in the nose. The head is minimal, and the mouthfeel simple and kind of bubbly, yet this thing, though ineffable, is a real refresher. An interesting interplay between light brown sugar, molasses, sweet malt and guiness like hoppiness make for an interesting experience. Don't pass up the chance to try this if you can find it.","moulefrite","Jul 21, 2003"
3.93,2.6,4.5,4,4,3,4,"The smell was chocolate and roasted barley malt, hints of licorice and spices arose also from the head. Taste was rather odd, since the licorice or whatever that was seemed to come to the forefront. Not enough hop flavor for my liking, but overall, rather good. The mouthfeel was quite watery and my only real complaint with this one. Imagine a black and tan consistency without the tan.. :) I guess if you like a low alcohol brew without a lot of heaviness or body, this one would be perfect. Unfortunately, I like them much heavier...","steelreign","Jun 18, 2003"
3.16,-17.5,4,3,3,4,3,"Lightly sweet, and lightly roasty finish, pretty easy to drink, uncompliacted, but pleasant enough. Dry-ish finish. A little un-intersting, but i suppose being a ""mild"" ale, thats true to style, although, i am sure theres better examples of the style out there, this is still quite alright though.","rastaman","May 07, 2003"
4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a welcome departure from all the strong beers I've consumed this past winter. Blackened amber in color, with a trace of plum when held up to bright light. The beige/tan head contained bubbles of varying size and fades rather quickly leaving a rim of lace. Nice coffee, smoke, malt and chocolate aroma. The medium citrus and slightly astringent taste blends well with the full lightly sweet malt body. Looks can be deceiving and this brew is a pussycat.","BeerResearcher","Apr 29, 2003"
3.9,1.8,4,4,4,3,4,"A quite deep blackberry color on the pour, the head mastodonic in size, frothy in texture, the color a light chocolate, but erodes quickly, leaving a patchy lace to cover the glass. Nose is Plummish, sweetly malt, fresh and soothing to the senses, hints of peat or musty a better term. Start is lightly sweet, the top skeletal in feel, the finish lightly carbonated, hops shy in their spiciness, a bit medicinal, dry aftertaste, quite drinkable but a touch different than my normal American over the top beers, and Frankly Scarlet I dont Give A Damn, Im ready for a change.","Gusler","Apr 14, 2003"
3.75,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Brilliantly clear deep crimson hue. Frothy head recedes into a spotty, loosely bubbled layer. Mild dark chocolate and caramel malt along with stately prune like fruitiness comprise the aroma. Subtle burnt black patent undertone. Chocolate malt becomes sweeter and milky as the beer breathes. Snap of sharp, lightly tart, metallic tinged black malt bitterness upfront in flavor yields to understated notes of chocolate, dark caramel and burnt raisny fruitiness. The mild hop bitterness appropriately offsets the minimal residual and caramel malt derived sweetness. Faint earthy hop flavor melds well with the roasted malt profile. Lightly bodied and crisp, yet smooth, and not thin in mouthfeel. Finishes with a well attenuated dryness lending a fading powered bittersweet cocoa aftertaste. Although Black Cat initially seems like a watered down porter in flavor profile, it becomes progressively more complex down the glass, yet retains a constant lightness and quaffability. A nearly ideal session brew. Similar, but slightly inferior to Young's Dirty Dick.","marc77","Jan 27, 2003"
3.94,2.9,3,4,4,4,4,"I enjoyed the aroma...caramel, coffee, roasted grains. Foretaste is tart, and then becomes a textured and grainy, with an almost smoky, burnt grain aftertaste. Smooth, and very drinkable.","Suds","Jan 24, 2003"
3.68,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This looked like a good brew for Halloween season.  The body is extremely dark, almost black.  It pours to a thick, tan head with good retention.  Leaves plenty of thick rings clinging to the glass.  Sweet roasted malt smell, with hints of chocolate and a bit of smoke.  Flavor is mild, with the sweet taste of malt dominating.  Has a lightly smoky taste, but is very subdued.  Hints of chocolate present.  Slight taste of hops comes through in the finish.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  Easy drinking brew, low abv helps make it very drinkable.","Viking","Oct 19, 2002"
3.63,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I'm a big mild fan (its probably my second favorite style), and was excited to try this beer that won Champion Beer of Britain at the 2001 GBBF.  Very nice almost black color - just a hint of brownnish-red when held up to the light.  The head dissipated quickly to a thin cap of foam.  The nose is all about licorice, with some hint of malt.  On the palate, the licorice was there, as was a bit of length due to a muted hop note, but there was not enough malt to make me think ""mild"" and not enough complexity for me to think ""great mild.""  While it was definitely high enough on the drinkablility scale to be a session beer, it was unable to pull off that key trick of a great mild - tons of flavor in a low alcohol beer.  I'd love to give this one a shot from cask though!","Realale","Aug 12, 2002"
3.78,-1.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I am unfamilar with this style, so here it goes.  The color of this was very good, being a very dark amber color with a nice head, which didn't hold though.  It might have been due to the beer temperature however.  The aroma smell of coffee and malt.  The taste was almost a combination of sweet and bitter.  The body of it seemed a little light for a dark ale, but then again that might be indicative of a mild ale.","Wildman","Jun 05, 2002"

3.72,-2.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This is considered a mile ale because they are not heavy with the hops, which is fine.  Very dark, low carbonation, good taste but slighly thin.","jdhilt","Mar 26, 2002"
