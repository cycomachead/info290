"3.5/3.5/3.75/3.5/3.75"
"Bought a variety pack of Guinness beers.  All four varieties were awesome!"
"I could be crazy, but drinking this side by side with Smithwick's Winter Spirit, I think they are literally the same beer.  Same colour.  Same flavor.  etc."
""
""
"Not a bad beer...but sooooo many US craft-beers are better..."
""
"Poured out of can into an English pub glass. I got a nice, thick, two-finger head. The color was a nice dark red. The smell was sweet, malty, and slight pumpkin spice. Overall this was a nice beer. I loved the malty taste with the sweet finish. Tastes like a more flavorful version of Guinness draught (though it's not a nitro beer)."
"Overall, I really like this beer. I will buy it again if I get the chance."
""
"Has malt bready spice aroma. Dark almost black and ruby colored body. Has a thick two fingered foamy head that lingers for a while. Much like the Guinness Draught in taste but has a maltier presence and thinner feel. Mild spiciness. Leaves a smooth creamy feeling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is not a ton of stuff going on here.  The good looks and mouth can't really offset the blah aroma and not overly interesting flavors."
""
""
""

"Overall: Generous what? This beer isn't generous anything. The can is a little bigger than average, I guess. Inoffensive, pretty boring beer. I'm almost positive the Smithwick's Winter beer that came in the same Christmas pack is going to be identical. I'll give it a legit shot, though. As for this ale, it'd be generous of me to describe it as average."
"Really sharp way to carbonated pleasant after taste."
""

"A reddish brown ale...the head is off white and medium in size, producing a delicate lace. Mother smell is malt forward.  Some fleshy fruit and bread in the aroma.   Clean flavor.  Unassuming, and straightforward."
""
"The Generous Ale is an easy drink beer.....medium in body with subtle carbonation.  Beer poured a clear brownish amber with offwhite head that is leaving only a spotty lace.  The scent is bland and the taste carries a tinge of spice.  Overall its ok."
"Quality product, as always from Guinness."

"Update: I'm having my second one and I'm enjoying it much more that=n the first - the flavor seems to be more present this time. BTW this is from a can, a plus in my opinion, and non-nitro (I think nitro would have made this even more enjoyable)."
""
""
""
""
"I am a huge Guinness fan, so I must disclose that fact. The Generous Ale is like a Red Ale version of the original. It is delicious. It has a sweet, but not too sweet start and a malty smooth finish. It has a nice amber to caramel color, with a surprising amount of clarity. The only issue I have with this beer is that it isn't more readily available."

"thinner body than expected. A little messy and not as clean as expected. A little tiny. Too many dark fruit flavors, not enough toasty and biscuit notes. Sweet yet balanced. Kind of like an underbaked biscuit with fig jam on it and maybe a touch of butter. Really thins out on the finish. Semi-dry but would benefit from being dried. Definitely needs more body."
""
""
"O: Maybe I got a bad bottle but not being too huge in this style it seems my bottle was more skunky than it should be. It came from a friend who got it in this years Guinness variety pack. Overall I'll probably pass on this one next time."
""
""
""
"Drinks fine out of a pint glass."
""
""
"I liked that my pour created a dense, thick two-plus fingers of tan head that sat defiantly atop the beer, refusing to subside and allow me access. Color was a deep mahogany with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light spiciness to accompany a malty, bready sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was like anise biscotti, if that makes sense. Finish was semi-dry. It was tasty, but one was enough. It just seemed to lack oomph."

"Reddish brown with ample head. Mild caramel in the nose with bready undertones and a faintness hop hop ... very clean. Some smoothness, mildy crisp with a moderate sized body. Toasted grain, hint of roastiness, grape skin, slightly metallic, slightly sharp bitterness, kiss of caramel, wet body, bone dry finish. Not sure what to think here, not much of a winter ale ... of body nor strength. I guess I expected a bit more, just seems a bit overly processed."
"Poured into a 12 oz. Sam Adams glass. Clear, deep copper with a very short-lived creamy white head. No lacing. Aroma is limited, with a malt sweetness that didn't have any identifiable notes. Taste is about the same. There's a nondescript malt sweetness, but nothing distinctive about it. Almost no carbonation. It's a beer that has the form of an English Mild but not the depth you would expect."
"Overall a tasty Irish Red Ae."
""
"O: a boring beer, little flavor, easy to drink but not really satisfying"
"Perhaps by taste buds are rough and lacking in subtlety, but I taste NO different between this and the Draught, so if you like very dry beers that leave more of an impression of flavor than flavor itself, this is right up your alley. Since this tastes just like the Draught, however, I'm not sure of the point of this brew. Cheers!"
""
"The aftertaste is nice and overall its a good experience. Like most Guinness products, it is an underrated session beer."
"Overall: Good beer picked up from a variety pack I saw at the store. Easily money well spent considering the other gems that came along with this one. If you see it definitely worth your attention drink and enjoy."
""
""
"O: pleasantly surprised by the quality of this macro-brewery offering."
""
"O: Not a great beer, but neither is it bad. I wouldn't buy a mix pack just for this, but if you end up with some, it is a pleasant session ale."

"Overall - OK. Didn't expect too much so not overly disappointed. Could do 2 or 3 of these."

"Overall nothing to run out and get seconds but not a bad winter ale."

"Is it not well known that the Guinness family (of English origin) fought against the repeal of the Act of Union, and thus against Irish independence from England? That Arthur's eldest son was a member of the orange order! That they were not exactly kind to the Irish Catholics that made up the majority of their work force? In fact, during the 1930's Guinness employed over 12,000 men at St. James Gate (close to 10 percent of the entire male population of Dublin), and it wasn't until the 1960's that a Catholic worker was allowed to enter management. Things may have changed, but to note Arthur's ""commitment to the welfare of his employees & the community"" certainly raises some questions in my mind. On the other hand, being an open-minded person who looks at all aspects of a situation I do have to acknowledge that at least until the 1960's, political and religious hierarchies existed throughout Ireland, England, and the rest of Europe (lest we not forget Nazi Germany)."
"O: Much better than the black lager, this is a decent seasonal English Ale."
"Wish the malt character were less roasted/charred. Finish is pretty harsh. Sourness is also a bit odd."
""
"A pleasant afternoon ale. Low/no hop character. The mineral/astringency is interesting."
""
"Overall: a red in the vein of Newcastle's Werewolf, but a bit more substantial and more agreeable"
""
"Reviews don't seem too enthusiastic. To be fair, it's still quite drinkable. Just don't come into it expecting something radically different from the Guinness mantra."
""
""
"O - I was excited to try something different from Guinness, but this is a bit disappointing. That being said, I'll still take it before lots of things and don't regret at least trying it."
""
"Overall Drinkability: Easily my least favorite Guinness."
"O: Not a fan. It doesn't flat out suck per se, but I'd much rather use the remaining bottle from the pack in a recipe than drink it. I can see this being fantastic in a beef stew or chili, at least."
"14.9 oz can poured into an English pint.  Drinkable winter ale, but for me a little too similar to Smithwick's and their winter ale."
""
""

"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a pint glass, coded bottle date. This pours a clear amber color with a large tan head which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of bread malts, nutty smells, and a little hops. The feel is medium. The taste is good enough, a little bitterness some nice bread malts and a little toffee."
"O=While the flavor that is there is appealing, the light body tapers the flavor. I'd try again, but likely won't buy this if better beers are available."
"Smooth with a hint of nutty, earthy malts, light raisin bread aftertaste. Vague fruity esters. Very light and easy drinking with lower carbonation, true to style. Overall it's not a bad dark mild, as long as you know what you're drinking."
""
"I am kind of surprised to see this listed as a mild ale at 5.6%. Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a deep hazelnut color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, bready. Taste is malty, toasty, light hops, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"Notes: I was drawn in by the label and hopeful for something better from this brewer. Unfortunately for me, at least, this will fade into the distance as a forgotten beer."
"You know you're a ticker when you'll buy a Guinness 12-pack simply because it has a new offering in it. Guilty. This stuff pours a clear smoky topaz topped by over a finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises dark greens, light old maple syrup, sweet barley, and biscuit. Things are even more bland than English milds' reputations occasionally demand. The taste is a mess of soapy, grassy, lightly-caramel-y biscuit. Harumph. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a limp offering, one that certainly doesn't deserve a 12-pack feature debut (though imagining this stuff in its own sixer is even more offensive, so, yeah...). Guinness can do better."
""
"O- this one wasn't complex by any means, but it is very drinkable and would make a solid session choice. It's like a lighter tasting ale version of Guinness draught."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A simple but respectable beer, with a little signature Guinness type flavor. Generous Ale actually was a bit like Smithwicks but lighter bodied, more roasted and hoppier. This makes a solid choice for a session beer. Would pair well with smoked or grilled cheddarwurst."
""
""
"The beer pours a reddish brown color with an off white filmy head. Smell has a lot of roasted malt with chocolate and coffee and a sweet candy like background. The taste is a little metallic and has dark bitter coffee flavor with an earthy hop flavor. It's light with moderate carbonation and a nice dry finish. This is a nice beer from Guinness I kind of expected something gimicky like their black lager but this is way better."
""
""
""

"Pours a nice ruby reddish brown topped with a frothy ivory head that holds good retention & leaves some sticky lacing on its way down. Aromas are yeast, grain, metallic, earthy, woodsy. Tastes are spicy, earthy, some roast, more bitter than expected, metallic, burnt caramel, some mild earthy pine on the finish. Thinner body with a dry finish from the roasted barley. Overall, somewhat different & not what i expected, but actually quite pleasant."
"O - My first exposure to this style, and I enjoyed it enough to have no problem finishing the bottle. Not a ""holiday"" brew, but interesting in it's own right. Would make a nice session brew. Dont know that I'd rush to buy it again, but glad I had it."
"Overall: I actually like this beer very much. It is definitely a winter-style beer, but isn't overwhelmingly dark, heavy, or spicy. It seems to be easily sessionable with just enough hoppiness and spiciness to give it a little kick. Definitely wouldn't mind having it again."
"Overall- Thought it had real possibility of being a good Guinness beer. But...it was alright was hoping for better."
""

"O: Very nice brew here. Lighter in body then Guinness Draught but without the creamyness makes for a light and flavorful brew that i def enjoyed."
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not."
"Pours a dark but translucent brown with short beige head.Aroma is sweet and bready. Taste is a bit fruity and a touch of bitters.Not what I was expecting for a ""Holiday"" brew. It is nevertheless very enjoyable and reminiscent of their Smithwicks labeled ale."
"overall...i was hoping for something more along the lines of a rich and tasty british mild but what i'm tasting is an uninspired english style amber/red ale. this just might be approachable to the newbie crowd, but to me it just seems ho-hum. not to mention that this is supposed to be a winter ale with holiday characteristics."
"The taste starts a little sweet but it immediately finishes with an acidic bitterness that lingers for a slight moment at the end. For a holiday brew there really isn't anything that jumps out as unique but it is entirely drinkable."
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt and barley, faint hop note throughout. Easy drinkability with a little higher ABV than traditional stout. A mild ale to be sure, but with ""Generous"" in the name I was expecting a little bit more in the flavor department. Worth a try."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a pretty brunette with a very nice amber colored head. The beer had good lacing. The head was big bubbles which is okay, I like fine. The taste was goodness as expected from a Guinness. Not as heavy as regular Guinness but more taste than the new black lager. I will buy again."
"I only wish it wasn't so easy drinking, because I have so few of them!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is similar -- roasty and flavorful, yet light in body. There's a definite tinge of bittering hops within the mix, but the roasty malts are most prevalent. This is a rich and easy-drinking ale, not great but certainly a nice change from the usual Guinness."
"Fine to be part of a bath/marinade for some chicken or pork"
""
"Sold as a component of a Guinness sampler pack. It seemed to be a filler for the very good Guinness Foreign Extra Stout. Bland taste, aroma and no body. The color was a very muted brown; it looked like it was trying to be a dark beer but just couldn't make it."
""
""
"I'm not really impressed by this one. While it has the flavor characteristics of a dark mild the abv is too high for the style. It is almost like a highly hopped amber lager with a handful of roasted barley thrown in. Really not something I would drink again."
""
"Real good beer, More of a traditional ale... not a ""hop bomb"". Think bass ale with a shot of guinness poured in. This was a very drinkable, smooth beer with a very mild flavor and the aftertaste of guinness. I only wish they sold it separately if only to be able to enjoy a few of these rather than only getting three per twelve pack. I look to see it next year in its own package."
" I wish they would offer this in a four pack, or a 6 pack. I don't mind getting the variety pack, but often want to get other beers, too."
"Overall- As a fan of Guinness, I'm a little disappointed with this one. It's not a bad beer but I don't think I will be having it again."
"The roast and hop bitterness leaves a metallic touch that does eventually fade. It stops just short of clashing with the malty sweetness. I don't quite understand the ""holiday"" aspect, other than by suggestion - and perhaps the slightly high abv for the brewery? Anyway, it's decent enough. It comes in the winter variety pack, which is worth buying for the foreign extra stout and to try this one out."
""
""
"Seasonal mix-pack from Guinness with a new beer to my eyes, so I had to give it a shot. The beer was poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint. It pours a bright, vibrant, amber-copper coloring with a thin, clingy, filmy white ring around the surface. Aromas of old world fruit, both subtle and darkly sweet, with a touch of spicing. Flavors are roasted initially, with a significant drop off of body and flavors after the forward profiles. Touches of toffee and caramel blend in the backbone, with a touch of tang throughout. The roasty qualities survive throughout, and well into the aftertaste, which intertwines with a tangy sweetness for a decent balance that is missing on the main part of the palate. The beer is light and smooth, made for a day of quaffing. Sweet linger on the finish, with a slight cloying feel as the last of the flavor leaves your tastebuds. Interesting brew, and not a bad addition to the stateside lineup for Guinness."

"O: picked up the winter 12 pack to give this a shot, not bad but not worth the cost. However the pack also containes 3 bottle of Forein Extra which is really really good."
"Overall it's a fairly plain but easy drinking beer. I probably wouldn't buy it again for myself but it's a good pick to bring to something like a family party."
"Overall this isnt a bad beer but I wouldnt recommend buying the whole 12 pack just to try it. Its good, Im glad I got to try it (to satisfy my curiosity if nothing more) but next time I'll probably just buy the classic guinness draught."
