The flavor reflects the nose nicely with the roasty characters coming to the forefront, coffee and burnt chocolate but in a mild, non-acrid way. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with a light yet creamy carbonation. Overall, a solid beer by GI, I could definitely drink this one curled up next to a fire on a cold winter's night.","gmfessen","Aug 25, 2013"

3.82,3.5,3.75,3.5,4,4,3.75,"this is a lot better than I thought it would be! it pours a darker copper color, pushing brown but just barley maintaining its red tint. its got a luscious off white head several inches tall and holding on pretty well. the nose is the English malt and caramel sweetness I expected, not really convincing me this is anything special. some dryness rather than sweetness though, and my palate always leans that way, so I take a sip. the first thing I notice is how mellow the sweetness factor is. I am allowed to taste the rich English malt, but I don't have to deal with its usual residual sugars. there is also a mild bittering hop finish that gives some nice balance. im not sure what the yeast is, but it almost comes across like a lager, finishing crisp and super clean for a beer of this malt persuasion. good carbonation, soft like a cask, and not filling at all. I could session this big time. overall an impressive regular beer from goose island, usually their sixpack stuff comes up short for me, but I thought this was an excellent cold weather brew, and one I will stock the fridge with come fall.","StonedTrippin","May 23, 2013"

Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, raisin, fig, apple, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, light rye spiciness, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, fig, apple, toffee, dark bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light rye spiciness, and floral earthiness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, light fruits, toffee, dark bread, light rye spiciness, and floral on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; with hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice dark mild ale. Good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

Not up to par the real stuff on cask, but a great bottled offering.

Actually probably darker then caramel but not a chocolate color. Smells great, malty and something like nutmeg, or at least nutty, in a good way.

The head has some good retention, and it leaves some nice scattered lace behind on the glass. The nose starts of with some nice toasted malt aromas. There is some spicy rye, caramel, chocolate, coffee, mild hops, nuts, and some chocolate and coffee. The nose is quite pleasant. The taste follows the nose pretty well. The toasted malt flavors come out first. There is some caramel sweetness, and a nice bit of chocolate and coffee. The rye makes itself known, and there is a little bit of nuttiness. The flavors are their but they seem a little muted at times. The finish leaves some lingering toasted malt, caramel, and chocolate on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a real smooth feel to it. There is a nice sweetness but there is some roasted bitterness and some mild hops that balance it out. There is some spiciness from the rye here as well. This has good drinkability. It is a nice easy going beer that has good flavor. I could easily drink a few pints of this in an evening. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and an interesting rye beer. I definitely think this beer is worth trying, and I would buy it again. Cheers.","JizackFH","Dec 05, 2011"

It is also, to date, is the first rye beer I have ever tasted. The flavor is excellent and remains solid during the first pull with little to no aftertaste, but what is really impressive about this beer was the mouthfeel. Goose Island Mild Winter is like drinking liquid silk. I could draw some parallels to a mouthfeel equivalence with some of the cold coffee beverages on the market such as the Starbucks frappuccino, but the feel of this beverage in your mouth is truly sublime. The only criticism i would wage against this beer is that, and this may be personal, is that it makes me feel thirsty afterward, as if there was a small amount of MSG in the bottle, this though may be just an aspect of the style.","Darker","Apr 12, 2011"

This had a light caramel scent with strong malty flavors. The taste... i couldn't get the taste out of my mouth fast enough, it wasn't the worst taste, just kinda strange, it didn't make sense to me what was going on in my mouth.

The taste loads up on the rye and pepper, with some light maple syrup, very light molasses, and cocoa powder backing them up.

Reminds me of an English Red Ale with that bright, white head. Smells slightly toasty, but not much hop presence. Beer looks more interesting than it smells. That is one area that I find the bulk of Goose Beers kinda fall flat, aroma and mouthfeel, which is often watery but more on that later. The taste is nice, a roasted flavor hits the senses first, followed by a clean bitter finish. Also seems somewhat crisp and refreshing with a light prickly carbonation on the tongue. This beer would pair well with a lot of winter foods, in such a way as to quench the thirst after eating some heavier comfort foods. This mouthfeel is a little richer than the average Goose fair and could be benefitted from the rye. Some vague dark breadiness too comes forth after a few more sips. I will be looking forward to this as a good, fresh fallback beer this winter, albeit not extremely complex, but refreshing nonetheless!","Star80","Oct 24, 2010"

The aroma was pretty quiet, but I got a bare whiff of chocolate when I first poured it. The taste was mild, as the name would suggest, sweet with a gentle hop presence. This is another in a long line of beers that really improves as it warms. The caramel then came out strong and the mouth feel also thickened. The feel was medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was very good, both flavor and ABV supported sitting down with a sixer one of the cold, winter nights.","kegger22","Nov 21, 2009"

4.3,16.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bottled on 12/4/08 this beer is holding up great, I thought it would be a mess after that much time. Appears a deep ruby caramel muddled hue with a light off white head forming thick with my vigorous pour. Lacing is even and fine and forms nicely with each sip from my tall 1/2 liter Willi glass used per direction. Aroma has a nice warming cereal grain sweetness about it, like walking through a specialty grain room when you tour a brewery with an edge of spicy rye in the finish. Barely a hint of herbal hops in the background, I'm sure when this brew was fresher there was a bit more hop aroma going on. Flavor has nice roasted malt layers with bread and subtle hazelnut and creamy milk chocolate tones, think nutella. That layer of spicy rye really adds to the complexity, along with the bite of herbal hop additions bitterness is at a minimal but overall flavor is good. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied carbonation is mellow and naturally smooth. Drinkability is great one that I will look for this coming December hopefully fresh, our local Goose Island wholesaler has been sending old product to all of the retail stores. This came in last week, and earlier this summer we got one year old Summer Kolsch and 312 Wheat along with continuously dated IPA and Honkers this is bad for craft beer.","WVbeergeek","Sep 28, 2009"

The flavor consisted of spicy rye, rich caramel, toasted nuts and grain, and a very mild, earthy hop note. Rich and malty. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had crisp, moderate carbonation.

Bitterness is low. Mild flavor but overall interesting. Lighter body with moderate carbonation. It has a nice semi-creamy texture. A little more flavor than a typical mild ale.

The creamy white head held remarkably well, and it left rings of lace throughout the glass. The nose was restrained, but clearly malty, and oddly gently spicy. In the mouth it was medium, or perhaps medium-light, but with a dextrinous edge. The carbonation was fine-bubbled and at a moderate level, and it was gently fizzy but then creamy across the palate once warmed. The flavor followed the nose, and it was mainly malty with a soft caramel edge and a bit of spice. I searched for something to reveal what it was, not exactly finding any cinnamon, or ginger, or any other flavor, but got nothing. It was simply peppery spice. I thought that it was a very mild blend of spices that held steady in the background and didn't really reveal itself. Obviously, that was the rye, but I couldn't see that at the time. And not unlike a rye beer, it finished dry, and mildly spicy-peppery, but also with a bit of hop flavor. Quite nice. Superbly rounded and remarkably well balanced.","NeroFiddled","Dec 24, 2008"

4.35,17.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Lovely brew. It's so easy to get carried away with big beers and forget to appreciate the lovely subtleties of milder brews. This is a wonderfully refreshing beer. Perfectly balanced and just right for a session.","sgoodship","Dec 23, 2008"
4.32,17.1,3,3.5,4.5,5,5,"This beer is really intriguing. A mix between and English Mild and a Rye Beer. This brings out the best of both. Bring this to your next holiday party instead of generic macro lagers. I would recommend this, and definitely purchase again.","champ103","Dec 23, 2008"
3.95,7,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Pretty pour -- dark amber with a tall but light head. Smells like it tastes (spicy and malty). Feels yeasty or bready in the mouth, and I'm looking forward to having a pretty long session of these on Christmas Eve to help me cope with the in-laws-to-be...","snaotheus","Dec 23, 2008"
3.68,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer is very easy to drink. Not my type of beer, but I was shocked by how much I actually liked it. This would make a nice session beer.","mothman","Dec 23, 2008"
4.03,9.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear, brown with 1/4 inch head. Good lacing and slight retention. Smells of roasted malts and I'm guessing rye. Fits the style. Very sweet, smooth, crisp. Aftertaste is very mild but still a little rye and malt, but mostly sweetness. Low carbonation. Overall, an easy to drink beer and another good Goose Island brew.","Tone","Dec 22, 2008"
4.18,13.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - A great session beer. I have gone through several 12 packs already. An easy drinker with a nice rye twist.","brewcrew76","Dec 20, 2008"
3.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours deep ruby copper thin head some lacing. At first can smell some malt - caramel. Deep sniff reveals hints of fresh rye - other wise smells of dregs. Tastes carmel malty up front with hoppy bitter finish earthy smokey wet aftertaste. Very drinkable lighter mouthfeel for the flavor. The further down the glass the better I like this beer.","tjkurz","Dec 20, 2008"
4.11,11.4,2.5,4,4,4,5,"It is a straightforward beer but very well-balanced and a low ABV means there is good chance I will be seeking this out again.","b3barron","Dec 20, 2008"
3.75,1.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a very rusty amber color and an even two finger head that recedes to a thin filmy foam. Not much bubbling and no lacing, but a good color. Very mild toasted malts give a faint hint of Polish rye bread. The hops add a few sprigs of mint to this beer's aroma. Toasted caramel and crystal malts make up more than 50% of this beers favor. There is a good hops presence though. Adds some herbal, even earthy hints and a little astringency to this session beer.","scruffwhor","Dec 19, 2008"

3.68,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12oz brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a pale brown/amber with a finger of off white head. Aroma of cocoa and a bit of hops. Fairly malty with some chocolate malt. Spritzy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. A fresh hop flavor. I didn't realize the rye aspect of the beer as I was drinking, maybe I should read the bottle. Definitely drinkable.","homebrewhawk","Dec 17, 2008"
4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall a very good session beer with a nice spicy 'tink' with a hint of toastiness. The dry and spicy element is well balanced, making this a delight to drink.","malty","Dec 17, 2008"

4.23,14.6,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I picked up a 6-pack for about $7 at Palmers Beverage in Columbus. The beer is very clear copper color with a thick ""yeast-cake"" head. The smell is sort of neutral, I guess about what I'd expect for a mild beer with some rye, with some roasted malt in the background. The taste is very nice, zest spicy bite from the rye, not too excessive, good counterbalance with some sweetness from the malts. The body is a little more carbonated than a cask ale while retaining the smooth mouthfeel I associate with casks. This is a great beer from Goose Island, hopefully to become a regular seasonal release.","TurdFurgison","Dec 14, 2008"

3.58,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a ruby orange color with plenty of carbonation. Nutty roasted aroma. Tastes of malt, nuttiness, slight roast character. Slight dryness on the palate due to the rye in this beer. A good beer overall and with such a low alcohol creates a nice session beer. A good mild offered by Goose.","SiphonKing","Dec 12, 2008"
3.52,-4.6,3,3.5,3,4,4.5,"This brew is as advertised; a mild flavored. It pours a slightly hazed orange copper. A scant head dissipates quickly leaving only nominal lacing. Smell is faint sweet malt base with a slight twang of sharp rye and a touch of floral hop note. Taste has more of the rye twang and hop aspect while the bready malt takes a back seat. Mouthfeel is a bit full and chewy. With a low ABV and subdued flavors this brew can definitely be sessioned.","crayphish","Dec 11, 2008"
4.27,15.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is this beers middle name. I am very impressed with the malt profile of this offering. Tastes somewhere between an English Mild and an American Brown. I could definitely drink this one regularly.","iasanlee","Dec 10, 2008"
4.23,14.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability is high. It's a tasty beer, approachable, and enjoyable. A mild rye, can't really complain about that.","Goliath","Dec 09, 2008"

4.1,11.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D- This is a definite session. Kind of wierd that they made this a winter seasonal. Its a GOOD beer. I will have several watching the Bears, but nothing really complex here.","inhoc00","Nov 30, 2008"
3.55,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - A really nice winter beer. The flavors complement the dishes of the season, and the woody-nutty flavors put fireside evenings in mind. Pretty good stuff!","pmcadamis","Nov 30, 2008"
3.98,7.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Plenty of carbonation from this beer forms a white head that falls somewhat quickly leaving little bits of lace down the sides of the glass. There certainly is rye in this beer, as it shows up in the nose. The rye flavor is dominant, too. There are some background notes of caramel and spice; perhaps a touch of anise, but maybe that's just more of the rye. Feels much lighter bodied than it's alcohol content suggests. The rye shows up in the finish, too, which is laced with a potent enough somewhat minty bitterness that builds and is stretched out longer with each sip. Very drinkable and refreshing on a winter's day.","marcobrau","Nov 21, 2008"

4.42,19.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly clouded amber brown. Creme head. Nose is exactly what I would think a mild to be. Full enough rye/grain character. Flavor brings a hearty rye flavor profile. It doesn't obliterate my mouth, but it's pleasant enough. Feel is smooth on liquid and the carbonation is middle of the road with a slight nip at the tongue. Mmmmm. This is a nice rye. I could go for several of these on a cold, snowy, miserable night. Or any other time for that matter.","RblWthACoz","Nov 12, 2008"
4.38,18.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - This is impressive. I hope it tastes this good with a little bit of time in the bottle. In a season full of spiced beers, it was very refreshing to try a beer going in a different direction. Everything a wonderfully balanced, with a nice, rich traditional malt complexity. Look forward to seeing this everywhere as the new winter seasonal.","SammyDavisJrJrJr","Nov 04, 2008"

4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D: A very nice rye beer. It's certainly no Red's Rye or Cane & Ebel but it does what it needs to do in a pretty unfussy manner.","GbVDave","Jul 12, 2008"
