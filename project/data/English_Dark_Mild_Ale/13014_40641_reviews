"Overall:  Considering the abv, this has a lot of flavor and body.  It isn't over the top or big and bold, but it is fantastic."
""
"This mild greets you with a deep rich color that lets you know exactly what you are getting in for. Dry flavor with hearty caramel and toffee overtones. The perfect complement to a salty or smoky dish. Great example of a little explored style."
"Replicates a true British session ale style. Pure malt based brown/caramel hued ale. Some english toffee notes, with minimally noticed aroma. Medium-light mouthfeel, absolutely a beer to take down midweek."

"Gotta start the night off mildly, amiright? This stuff pours a slightly murky sienna topped by a half-finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises biscuits, light nuts, mild grass, and a kiss of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of nuts and an addition of dark greens. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thickly fluid feel. Overall, a nice little mild. I'd probably like it better on cask or something, but here it's still pretty tasty and enjoyable."

"Nice drink that went well with the food. Refreshing and tasteful. Acceptable bold for style."

"The beer is a dark, mahogany brown color with hints of auburn when held to the light. The nose brings caramel malt and roast. Bready and light. This is terrific beer. A fine example of the style, and what a session beer can be. Light bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth on the palate. I would definitely have this again."
""
"So good, so smooth, so much flavor for such a low abv!"
""
"O- crisp and yet watered down but a brew that you just wanted to drink more of"
"Beer is thin in body and a little ashy at the end, mildly bitter from the grains, overall an easy drinking decent beer but it is not my favorite mild."
"Good."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown/nearly black with a pretty big fluffy tan head. The smell is nice and roasty with some caramel malts also factoring in. The flavor really nails it: it really toes the line between roasty and flavorful and being sessionable and refreshing - just how a dark mild should taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin-bodied, but that suits the style just fine. I'm a big fan of dark milds and this really is one of the best out there."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black. There was a good tan head and some nice lacing on the way down. The nose brought some roasted malt and a bit of coffee. Good integration that gets even better in the flavor. Packed with beautiful malt notes, especially considering the low abv. Light-medium body with a slight bit of chewiness and nice carbonation. Overall, a really excellent beer."
"Overall: not particularly impressive, although nice it is 4.20%. Would potentially be better on cask."
"So light and refreshing, so blackened dark and evil, I want to make gravy. Really dam good and fun, I feel like I could just pound this beer all day!"
"o - Overall I thought this was a realy good beer. Lots of malts and super easy to drink; would love it if they canned this one. Would love to have it again."
""
""
"Overall: Love low ABV beers that are packed with flavor and this is no exception"
""
""
"Very easy to have a few... I can't recall the last time I had five pints of the same beer in the same sitting!"
""
"Overall: A very good take on the English Dark Mild. Pretty full flavored and hearty for a lower abv beer. Fairly easy to drink but not exactly a session ale to me. A very good beer overall."
""
"On tap at The Bulldog in Minneapolis. This beer arrives a dark brown color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is of milk chocolate, and burnt malt. The taste is a nice balance of chocolate, burnt malt, and roasted malt with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a nice example of the mild style. I would really like to try this on cask as I think its true colors would come through more from that serving type."
""
"Overall: Good flavors with a low ABV makes this a great session beer. A good interpretation of the style. The extra hops flavors balance the big malts and make it a great easy-drinking brew."

"One of my favorite (non-sour) session beers. Smooth, subtle, flavorful, and well-crafted."

"Not bad, but like I said, a little thin on the palate. Milds were meant to be served from a cask, and this beer would certainly benefit from that treatment. Nonetheless, quite drinkable and at 4% alcohol, this is a pint you could stick with all night."
"Overall: Extremely drinkable and a decent amount of flavor and complexity. Brewers should make more beers like this. Damn you Omar and Todd, can this now!"
"The palate and finish of this ale are poor. Extremely thin, watery and flat. Flavor does not match the nose (which isn't too bad - chocolate, coffee, roasts) and wrecks the experience. Not a great product from a respected brewer. Pales in comparison quality wise to the rest of the Surly offerings. I realize it's intended as a different beast but let's be blunt and honest - if you tasted this blind you would not reach for it again. Meek would be a better name."
"Up for review is Surly Brewing Company's example of an English Mild. Poured cold into a pint glass. Nice Mild, just lacks the intricacies found in the finer Milds found over the pond. But a very nice session beer. Go get some, try it out for yourself."
"Drinkability: Good, but I don't know if it should be considered a session beer. I could see myself drinking way more Furious, though Mild would probably be a better decision as far as the ABV goes. A great high-taste, low alcohol sipper for a designated driver."
"Draft. Served at Cafe 28 on 1/31/11 for the celebration of 5 years of business. Poured into a snifter a darker caramel brown color with a nice 2 finger tan head, at first I thought I had been given Bender but the aroma/look soon made me realize I was given the correct beer. Not sure why I thought this was going to have a lighter look to it. The aroma is more pungent than I would have expected with a light roast coffee and chocolate nose. Medium/Light mouthfeel. Very robust flavor with the roast and coffee notes, some mild bitterness as well. Very flavorful and enjoyable. I really wish this was one that they did all year round."
"Drinkability:Fantastic tasting beer, refreshing and flavorful. As a homebrewer, I find this beer reminiscent of prefermented wort."
"D: this is the definition of a sessionable beer. Tons of flavor with out the huge abv or caloric intake. I wish there were more of this style around."
"Drinkability:Extremely drinkable. I could definitely enjoy a few of these on cask. Plenty of subtle character to this. Sweeter and thinner than I expected. Happy to have it on cask, not sure I'd enjoy this as much at much cooler of a temp."
"Beer is fairly drinkable and does have a dark, coffee-like malt base. It does seem slightly watery but that helps it be drinkable past the first beer. Despite the flavor however, it is NOT brewed with coffee at all says Surly's own Omar. It makes for a good chance of pace beer if you're looking to switch from most of Surly's other stronger beers."
"If they canned this stuff, I would always have a supply in my fridge."
"To bad they don't bottle or can this great beer. I see why they call it a session beer."
"Absolute session beer. This is an all around awesome beer. When I hear ""mild", this is not what comes to mind. This looks, tastes and feels like a big beer, but drinks so easy."
"OK, so this is an interesting story, at least to me. I stop in at Stub and Herb's, specifically for this beer, and was told before it was even poured that Mild is now being brewed with coffee. I hadn't heard this, but took the bartender's word for it. Pours a dark amber color, nearly brown in the middle, with a small off-white head. Aroma is, well, mild with a touch of coffee, some toffee, and caramel sweetness. Taste follows suit. I was surprised with the coffee flavor in the background. Light caramel, some breadiness, and no bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, light carbonation. Again, I was really surprised by the coffee presence in this beer. It was almost like a watered down coffee bender without any of the dark/roasted maltiness in there. Good, easy drinker."
"Overall, this beer is simple but incredible drinkable. This beer is so easy to drink. I am glad I got to try this. My pint won't last long."
"The pint glass came with little head - although lacing was evident. Smelt of toasted barley and had a nice subtle barley taste to it with a firm malty body and no bitterness. Seeing as it is 4.2% nobody should be offended if I call this a great session beer."
"D= very high. Delicious brew for a mild. Smooth flavor and clean finish"
"Drinkability- Must confess. I glanced at the other reviews of this beer as I am reviewing it and was shocked at the scores. I guess I'm a Surly fanboy for the most part (minus shitty Darkness) but this is the best beer I've had from them. I'm far from the style police but this brew is on point. Flavorful, drinkable, and just plain tasty!"
"This one is hard to judge. I'm a huge Surly fanboy, and maybe they are trying to make a more approachable crossover brew. If thats the angle, they have succeeded ten-fold. This is a great tasting, easy drinking, sessionable dark mild. For my intro to the style, I was impressed and enjoyed it."
"I wonder what will come of this cask scotch ale sample I had?"
"Hmm, good appearance, no real head but a nice color and very clean looking. Smell and taste are very similar. Light on the malt but some decent flavor from it. Nutty and bitter chocolate with just a hint of dried fruit. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, as I mentioned the malt was a bit light. Drinkability is very nice."
"Overall: Great tasting beer with moderate carbonation that made almost perfect feeling and amazingly drinkable, something I could sip on all day long. Very impressive for the style, another great one from Surly."
"Overall: This is not my favorite offering from Surly, in fact it may be my least favorite, but it' still great so that's gotta say something. This is as true to style as I've ever seen from Surly but a style that's not done much anymore. Good job Surly."
"Cheers"
"Overall: similar to many winter warmers. Light and not all that complex, but great for a malty session beer. It's not just a clever name, if you will."
"Very easily drinkable, I had 3 in a row, I would love to have this one around year round."
"D-Absolutley...wow, a session brew from Surly...wait, did I just see a pig fly past me?!"
"Thank you Surly."
"I've never had this style before. I've read about it in my homebrewing books and craved it. Now I know why. This will be my basis for comparison. And what a great beer to compare others to. Thank you Surly for yet another great beer."
"Mouthfeel is quite light and highly carbonated; fitting for the style, but not my personal preference. Drinkability is excellent, this is a true session beer in the original English sense of the word."
"Poured a clear mahogany brown with a nice little off-white head, stays foamy with some decent lacing. After warming a bit, the aroma comes out more, malts are prominent in caramel, bready and biscuity tones, some faint herbal hop hints, still fairly faint, but nice. The taste is a little more broad, but still fairly modest, biscuit and caramel malts, Earl Gray tea, a sense of hops but nothing finite, just flirting impressions. The mouth is very smooth, a very subtle carbonation, a slightly dry finish, a session beer if there ever was one. I downed two of these in rather short time (encouraged by the release of Two), and could imagine doing so often. Also, I would love, LOVE, to see this on cask. That would truly be fantastic. As it stands, i fine brew, out of the blue, for the Surly crew."
"Tasted this new beer from Surly at the release party at the Happy Gnome. Amber/Red in color with a little foam and touch of lacing. Very light on the tongue. Nice gentle balance of malt and hops with neither taking presidence. Not too carbonated. Great flavor and, as a session, perfect for enjoying more then two."
"Overall, this is a little over carbonated. Not much aroma but a good beer. Very drinkable, but let it rest it gets better with time in the glass."
"Went over to the Gnome to try Surly's latest. I've never had a mild before (since FFF's Pride and Joy isn't really a mild), so this was a new experience. It was pretty good, and I definitely could have had several if I didn't have other things to do. I've heard milds are even better on cask, that would be interesting to have with this beer."
"Mild does serve a nice niche, though, and I hope to see it again in the future, ...but not at the expense of Furious or bender!"
