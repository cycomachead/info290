"One of the best cask beers I've had. This style obviously really works."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink, is enjoyable, and as a result of the low ABV definitely a session beer. I really enjoy this style and there are just not too many options in it, especially made in the US - glad I found this one since I started doing full reviews (I previously ""Had"" it at a cask festival in late 2011)."

"Overall: A very interesting panoply of flavor; nice to see more breweries experimenting with the style"

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style with the added smokiness, this is a very solid beer to session with if youâ€™re in the mood for a milder smoky beer."
