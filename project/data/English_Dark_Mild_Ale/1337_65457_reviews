"Beer is light in body and watery on the palate, it is mildly sweet and has a nice finish. This is a craft light beer. Probably not a repeat."

"Overall I was very pleased with this selection. A true session beer, and an excellent Brown Ale considering it's not a real favorite style of mine. Recommended."
"Gold Medal at 2011 GABF? I would love to have tried the competitors in this category."
"O: Was expecting more of an English brown ale, but was pleasantly surprised to get a mild. Nice smooth flavors that are pleasant and easy to enjoy."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and smooth, with a bit of stickiness at the ends from the malts. Roasty bitterness is advantageous here and the aftertaste was almost non-existent in a good way. Drinkability was great, and I had trouble pacing myself with this - each sip goes down without any fuss while being satisfying each time."
"Overall: A nice mild with just a little sweetness. This is quite good. This probably blows away most milds you would find in England."
