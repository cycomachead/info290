"Tastes much better than it looks. Slightly heavy with a honey sweetness, but not overwhelming. Very tasty beer for a cold day. Too bad, it's a one timer for ACB."

"Such a strange and tasty IPA / mead hybrid! No idea where the other guy got ""barleywine"" from, but the brewery listed it as an India Pale Braggot. 420lbs of orange blossom honey and ""a shit ton of hops"". Great collab with B Nektar."

"Finishes thick with a sweet edge and is a good beer to try."
