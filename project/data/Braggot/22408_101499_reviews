"Pours out to a thick beige head and minimal lacing but good retention. Color is a hazy, deep copper. Aroma is esters, honey sweet, vanilla and floral. Flavor is strong on honey and vanilla and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is full and thick. Overall a great braggot."

"Quite a good braggot. A nice strong honey flavor combined with a nice bitter hoppiness. It's not a light, sweet honey either, but a good dark, flavorful honey. The whole thing is deepened and rounded by aging in ""spirit barrels"". Quite flavorful, not too sweet, and a lovely almost vinous aroma. Very satisfying, doubly so to share a bottle with my wife for Mardi Gras!"

"O - It's probably one of the best beers I've had from Bayou Teche so far. It's unique, refreshing and gives me the whiskey flavor I like."

"This is my first braggot. Not much carbonation on the pour, but it is a beautiful dark ruby red color. It is translucent and leaves almost no lacing, just a ring of foam around the edge. The smell is sweet, but not like those artificially sweetened beers. A strong honey scent dominates this beer, the whiskey barrel is not so prominent but still present and balances the honey very well. Slick but not sticky on the palate. And again, not too much carbonation but it works well. I usually don't like lightly carbonated beers but this one is the exception... The taste is almost the same as the smell but with a little more of the whiskey barrel shining through. This beer was one of my favorites if not my favorite from Bayou Teche so far. I will definitely get another bottle to save and one to send as an extra on a future trade. Highly recommended..."
"Sweet smelling, noticeable honey but not too sweet, which is a plus. The whiskey barrel is mild, but strong at the same time. Hard to explain, but its less whiskey barrel, but more whiskey...and I can't shake the idea that the whiskey smells cheap. Same thing translates into the taste really. Not syrupy, a solid medium body and good feel. Aside from the sometimes strong spirit notes, the fermented alcohol is fair,y well hidden, mostly in the taste. It's unique, refreshingly not cloying. I think I'll get another bottle to age, this might be a much better beer a year or more down the line."
