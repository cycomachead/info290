"NOTE: The label says 5,5 % ABV-level."
"I... don't really get this beer: It feels like an experiment from a homebrewer ""Lets brew something from all thing I got at home"". A little too unclean and hoppy with notes of crisp bread (from the rye malt) and sour dough (wheat malt) with some odd yeasty-spicy hints."
"If this didn't cost $8 for 0.5L bottle, i'd drink it more often. Still, a very nice brew that i think is a bit unappreciated. Recommended!"
