"Poured into stout glass. Pours a dark purple almost like the color of the bottle but much darker. No head but some lacing. The smell is alcohol, dark fruit like raisins and plums and toasty. Taste is alcohol heat up front then roasty malt and dark fruits. Fig, plum, dark berries. Mouth feel was slick and medium. With decent to little carbonation. I ending up drinking the whole thing in one night but it was a slow process. It was better a little warmer than completely cold. It was my first and maybe only braggot for a long while I haven't seen many. Just this and Sam Adams honey queen. But I would also not buy it again, but I did enjoy the experience"

"Poured from a purple  bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, muddled, amber-brown coloring with a thin, low profile, tan head. Aromas of rich honey, sweet berry, floral and herbal highlights, and rich caramel notes. Flavors are tangy and richly sweet forward, with a blast of berry sweet and tart on the forward tongue, a solid caramel and honey backbone, and a vegetal and herbal highlight. Full bodied and smooth, with a tangy sweet blend of marionberry and honey in the aftertaste. The beer has a slight edge from subtle carbonation which helps clean the finish a bit, but there is still a considerable linger on the smooth feel. Good beer."

"This has a pleasant appearance and a decent but unremarkable aroma.  Unfortunately, the flavors are nothing like nose and the mouth feel was gag worthy.  This was a drain pour."

"O: Easier to drink than I expected due to a lighter amount of sweetness than I expected for the style. Alcohol could be a little better hidden but the strength of this one makes it a slow sipper."
""
"Brown ale flavors, nut, chocolate and berry.  Not the worst thing I've had from Rogue."

"When first poured it was a hazy purple tone.  Nice smell of berries lingered, but upon taste, the flavors were muddled for me.  I on't know if I let my bottle sit too long, but the nose did not match up to the taste for me."

"Delightful surprise with this one, on the nose and flavor and most importantly - drinkability.  Dark brown color, hazy, some floaties too.  Nose is sweet 'n fruity.  Palate offers big fruit, some pleasant sourness, and fruity sour finish that is quite nice.  No way in hell this one is actually 11%.  So easy to drink."
"It's an uncommon style and this is an enjoyable drink."
"Overall, a complex, heavy beer that would go well with a stinky cheese and strong bread."
"750 ML.  26 plato.  17 IBU.  84 AA.  32 L."

"Well balanced beer that is probably not for everyone but I liked it and would recommend it to anyone who likes sweet drinks."
"Overall â€“ While at first I was a little put off, it really grew on me sip after sip.  It has a complex flavor profile with a good balancing feel and a rather intriguing smell.  While fairly pricey, this is certainly one to try if you get a chance."

"O:  Definitely an adventure and worth trying to appreciate the range of tastes beer can provide.  I admire the audacity and craftsmanship that went into this beer.  My hats off to Rogue.  Still, I would not seek out again.  Pretty bottle."
"Recent reviewers have made good comments. If you're going to try a Braggot this will give you a good introduction. But it's definitely a fat, brawling, remarkable beverage. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Olive Tree Market in OB, San Diego."

"O:  I think this beer is pretty good.  the flavors and complexity are there but it does have a lot of sweetness."
"Fairly complex, but drinkable enough, probably the best example if this style I can remember having"
""
"In addition to the cool purple bottle, this Rogue beer provides plenty to like.  I could get used to this."
"Overall an OK try once experience."
""
"A pleasant mixture of berries, honey and malt. Minimal hop presence with an 11.4% ABV kick."

"750 ml bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big blackberry, cherry, red grape, raisin, plum, honey, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, honey, and fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of tart blackberry, red grape, raisin, plum, cherry, honey, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart blackberry, red grape, raisin, plum, cherry, honey, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, honey, and fruit flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly dry/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited braggot style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, honey, and fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"To be fair, this was strong and having someone to finish this off with was probably for the better. When asked what a Braggot was, I had to reply to him that I had no idea but after reading more about the style and finishing this off, I'd have to say that anyone giving a go would be wise to start off here. There was a hint of floral notes to this too, ensuring that this was not too heavy, boozy, or spicy. This was really enjoyable and worth seeking out again, if for no other reason than because I haven't had anything quite like this before. A nice addition to Rogues eccentric lineup!"

"O: Very unique and interesting. Creative. Like the mild sweetness from the honey, the hidden ABV makes for a dangerous long lasting bottle."

"A dangerously easy drinking beer, and quite possibly the strongest beer I have yet sampled (although technically not a straight beer, but rather a mix of fermented malt (beer), honey (mead)- and possibly also fermented marionberry? (wine). A great attempt at an old and scarcely known style for which this brewery deserves applause. Bravo!"

"why they have been around so long. They take chances and some times they create some crazy weird off beat thing that rocks."

"22oz bottle poured into a glass, it has a Maghony color body with a small thin head. The smell has a honey and fruit aroma. The taste has a tart berry flavor up front with a little honey. It also has a little hop flavor on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is good and overall a flavorful beer. This was my first braggot."

"my girlfriend picked this one up because she liked the bottle (i admittedly like it too), and she loves fruit beers. havent had much braggot either, so i opened this up with much anticipation. it ours a dark purple to mahogany color, dense and hard to tell if its cloudy or just too think to let any light shine through. the head is pinky cream colored, and fizzles out rather quickly. an aroma of fresh pulped berries and sticky sweet meadow honey arises, with very little real alcohol heat or harshness, which surprises me at this strength. i taste the berries first in the flavor, and while i havnt had much experience with the marionberry, it reminds me of a cross between blueberry and blackberry and elderberry here. its deeply purple, skins tart like wine grapes and elderberries, but the fruit appears to be very sweet, and in combination with the honey, its gorgeous, almost medicinal in that i feel like its almost good for me, despite the alcohol. honey is fresh and floral and different from other honey beers because i can actually taste it. its sweet but never offensively so, and its actually pretty well carbonated despite looking flat. it drinks heavy though, especially as it warms, turning into almost english barleywine, bu the fruity character remains dominant. i liked this beer far more than i ever though i would, i have a new appreciation for both the fruit here and the braggot style, which i need to find more of and continue this trip. id like to see more rogue around shelves in colorado, everytime i have a new beer from them it surpasses my expectations. this is awesome stuff."
"My first time trying this style. It seems close to a barleywine. Good for the summer months. This was not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be. I would try others of this style, but I probably wouldn't come back to this one."

"O - Not necessarily my favorite style, but definitely not my least favorite either. It's a strong, fruit-forward beer with it's sweetness balance by warm alcohol."

"Great mix of sweet, tangy and dry. The alcohol is almost undetectable. This was a nice surprise."
""
"O: I have few complaints with this ale, though I still tend to be of the opinion that braggot just isn't my thing. Still, this is definitely worth trying and fans of the style should be pleased."

"Overall: I'd refused to try another Rogue after the Pumpkin Ale incident last October out in Virginia Beach until I saw this. It's pretty nice overall and makes me more willing to try more Rogue varieties again."
