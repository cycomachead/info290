3.8,6.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pretty nice stuff. Poured with a huge off white, foamy, fluffy, thick, head that lasts a very long time and very little lace. color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is spicey, wine, honey. Flavor is somewhat crisp, sweet/tart with great tang.Great body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and so pleasing.","drpimento","Nov 24, 2010"
3.7,3.9,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Nice to find another braggot, there aren't that many of them out there. This one pours golden with little head, which is ok given the style. This is styled after a traditional Kolsch, but with honey- their version of a medieval braggot. Smells of citrusy honey and some spice, prevalantly ginger. A bit herbal as well. The taste is somewhat subtle, but pretty nice. A little watery, and seltzery, but with nice notes of orange flower water, some honeyed notes, and a spritz of lemon. Not overly sweet, and quite light. A different take on the style, and enjoyable enough.","Georgiabeer","Oct 30, 2010"

3.56,0,2,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Maybe not the traditional Braggot I think made today, but a nice hybrid here. $4.99 for the bottle is a bit too much though, but it was nice to try.","Halcyondays","Feb 01, 2009"
