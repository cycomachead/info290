"I'd put it closer to a 3.5 overall with the taste and feel improving to 3.5 for both."

"well, as so many trinity beers are, this is an awfully strange one, modeled after the hot drink, ive heard they even serve this one warm from time to time down at the brewery. its got tea and ginger and citrus and honey all coming alive in it, something like half the fermentables here in fact come from the honey. yeasty amber liquid with a short off white head gives way to aromas of raw honey, wax and all, and spice, lead by clove and ginger, but even with some black pepper it seems. i taste the honey and the tea first, a healthy thing, with orange peel and black tea earthiness. so much alcohol in the beer, and indeed the cocktail, but its really not all that evident in the beer, which i like, theres enough going on without a huge booze thing too. spices linger with the heat of the ginger in a long finish, and it does in fact have a slight hop bitterness as it winds down. clever and unique, to say the least. maybe a bit light in carbonation, but this is a well made and high headed beer all the way around. will it age well i wonder..."
"A little bit of cheese and honey."
