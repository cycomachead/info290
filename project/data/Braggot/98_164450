I found myself wincing from time to time because the flavors were too opposite of each other rather than complimenting each other.  Not a drain pour I promise. But it was slow to finish.","puboflyons","Mar 29, 2015"

3.79,5.6,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Fullish in body, the taste of hops and alcohol offer strong reprieve from the malt and honey with dryness, spiciness and heat all its own. Acetone-rich to close, the roughness of alcohol hides behind the bitter hop resins nicely as their linger of fruit and pine needle extend indefinitely.","BEERchitect","Mar 28, 2015"
