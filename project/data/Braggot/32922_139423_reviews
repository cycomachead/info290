"my favorite of the woodfour beers i had the pleasure of trying. sour braggot, we have not seen this before that i am aware of. a nice honey malt base thats floral and bright and sweet and strong, super clean, and unique. wheat and honey are dominant flavors up front, with the sourness coming later. its more sour than their other beers, but still to me tastes like more of a mature brett wild ale than it does a lacto sour. some fruity pucker to the finish, but its largely balanced out by that honey aspect that is so forward and fresh. its almost herbal, not hoppy in the least, but has a sort of green tea element in there mid palate. i like the fusion of styles here, its almost like a tart baby barleywine or something, hard to describe, but definitely a success. never really had anything else like it. like most of the woodfour beer, it could stand a bit more carbonation, but i like its smoothness as is. these guys are doing something pretty unique to say the least."
