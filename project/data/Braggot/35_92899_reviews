"The honey in this tastes chemical, forced, added in at the end."
""

"Nice carbonated light feeling with the full taste makes this quite enjoyable if you're looking for a honey beer."
"Feel : very smooth witht a very heavy sweet taste lingering but still clean."

"Notes: No bottling date"
"O: A very impressive offering from SA & one I will be picking up again, perhaps to lay down for a year or so... Also, if this is what the Braggot style generally is like, then I think I need to add it to my list of favorites!"

"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear pale straw color. Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Clover honey nose and flavor is clover honey, hops in the background. Clean finish.  $7.25 for a 22oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."

"     Overall a 4.5 for Samuel Adams Honey Queen - Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams). I, like many BA's, had been curious and anxious to try this style of brew(braggot). This is certainly one of the most unique beers I've consumed in my experiences. I'll probably grab this brew again."
"Samuel Adams Honey Queen brewed by Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams).  This brew has a ABV of 7.50%  Before we get to the review this is my first Braggot brew.  The brew pours out a cloudy amber color with nice white head. I'm going to say this brew is unfiltered. The smell is rich with sweetness and grains. There is a hit of spices in the smell of this brew. The taste is sweet like honey. There is also some grains and malts at the end. Honey Queen goes down smooth with no bad after taste.  This brew has a nice balance to it ,there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Samuel Adams did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again, it was better than what I was expecting. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5."

"3.5 D:  It's not bad, but it doesn't hold a candle to the best that I've had.  Admittedly, the vast majority of the better braggots I've had have been homebrew.  In any case, I'm glad that breweries are at least trying."
"Has a nice sweet aroma with a floral backdrop.  The beer is a pale yellow color with a pretty big white head.  It has a nice honey flavor that stays throughout the whole beer.  this is a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. A real good  Braggot style beer."

"braggots need to make a comeback, so i like that this is out and widely available. the color is just like honey, clear and radiant golden. a real green tea and honey sort of nose, very nice without any appreciable hops at all. yeast is cool too, farmy and bright. the honey is the dominant flavor, and grain seems to be quite light in it, which is cool for a strong ale. its a little too sweet for me though to drink much of, and the alcohol shows though. the other flaw it has for me is that its still. i dont know if all braggot is supposed to be this way or not, but this has no bubbles at all, and as such seems watery and thin. i wish it had more to it there, but the flavors are really nice. cool of sam to make bigger beers in styles we dont see much of."

"overall: Nice enough, a little bit of a lightweight."
"Weird beer. A bit too sweet with some fascinating flavors. It seemed like an okay concept, but I needed a bit more on the finish to really hammer it home."

"Inquiring into the new, as-yet-unmarked tap at the bar, I was told it was a mead beer.  I ordered it forthwith, knowing too well how rare braggots are at bars.  This one pours a clear golden brass topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises flowers, chamomile, light nutmeg, sweet cereal grains, light dried honey, and sweet white wine grapes.  The taste brings in more of the same, the flowers, honey, chamomile, and grapes shining through and combining fairly well.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly syrupy feel.  Overall, a rather enjoyable braggot, one of the better ""experimental"" beers Sam Adams has put out in recent memory."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours fairly crystal clear bright gold color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, tangerine, pineapple, pear, orange peel, honey, bread, chamomile, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of honey, pale malt, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, tangerine, pineapple, pear, orange peel, honey, bread, chamomile, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, tangerine, pineapple, pear, citrus peel, honey, bread, chamomile, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of honey, pale malt, and spice flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice braggot style. All around good complexity and balance of honey, pale malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is the first of the style so I have nothing to compare it to. I liked honey a lot so I was really looking forward to this one. The story on how the beer style created also intrigued me. The first thing that stood out to me was the aftertaste, which reminded me of tart tasting mixture. This beer had some caramel i believe, but the citric and honey overpower the smell of it. I enjoyed the beer, but it was not one i would try again. I do want to try more of the style."
"Overall: Much milder flavor than I expected; sweet, but not overly so; pairs well with spicy foods like BBQ, TexMex, or Indian food"
""
""
"Overall: An above average beer that has nice and deep layers of honey. However, if you do not like honey, this beer offers little else. I would pick this up again, but there are others in the small batch series that I prefer."

"Pours a nice deep gold with a frosty and yogurty white head that lasts a long time. Smell is clean and fresh. Nice clean floral and sweet beer with a nice honey sweetness at the finish. I did not think I was going to enjoy this but was very pleasantly surprised. A very good beer."

"O: A honey of a summer brew. Ladies will love this light, sweet, tasty treat. Would pair well with lemon cake."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a medium golden (honey?) amber with a one finger white head with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of mead, floral and herbal spicing; mildly tea-like and vinous. Flavor starts with quite sweet floral and apple juice but dries out a bit to exhibit mead-like character, finishing estery and sweet with floral notes and at last, a lingering light honey taste that is mild enough to be quite pleasant. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A style with few European examples to compare and possibly few historically accurate ones in any case. I've had only one Danish braggot and a domestic one made with prickly pear, so I can only guess to compare this in style. It is certainly what I would expect from a honey beer, sweet and floral. It is much sweeter than most mead, but I did enjoy the pure honey flavor in the finish, which is usually lost in mead. Good floral notes, but it seemed to skate on the edge of cloying sweetness. Also slightly tame, like many Boston Beer offerings. An enjoyable honey, fruit and floral ale that left me wishing I could go back a few centuries to taste the real thing. Not a bad interpretation of a rare style."
"This is the first braggot I’ve knowingly tried and I was moderately impressed. While being sweet, it wasn’t so sweet that I needed an insulin chaser. The honey flavor was rather unique, better than most of the meads I’ve tried. I would recommend trying this, but only buy one bottle."
"Honey, cirrus, mild spiciness, more honey. Flavors of honey, honey, honey, mild hay, initially some citrus... maybe some tangerine, a little bitterness on the finish. Did I mention the honey?? Fairly smooth mellow finish. Overall worth the $, but not a beer you will want regularly"

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a decent example of a Braggot, it had some nice aspects and I liked the different flavors that honey imparted especially the honey dew and white grape flavors, but I thought the honey pretty much took over and along with the chamomile it made it hard to pick up any flavors that the base beer imparted. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not too cloying, a little creamy, not too crisp, not too filling, but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think the chamomile would start to wear on me after one glass, so I think that would be my limit, but I think it makes for a decent summertime beer. What I like the most about this beer was the fruity and floral flavors and aromas that the honey imparted, they were nice and little unique. What I liked the least about this beer was the chamomile, I don't think it really added anything thing to this beer and I think it held this beer back from being as good as it could be and I also I wish it just had better balance and that the beer base was more noticeable. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but it isn't something that I could see myself getting again and I might recommend it if you really like braggots, but I don't think the average Craft beer drinker would really dig it. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it wasn't bad, but I think it was a little rough around the edges and it could use a little work and some balancing out. This isn't my favorite Braggot or my favorite beer from Samuel Adams. It's nice to see Sam Adams tackle a style like this and I'm glad they tried it, but I think with a little work it could be a much better beer. I appreciate the effort but i think this one needs a little work, better luck next time guys."

"This one is a real honey bomb"
"O - Honey Queen provides a deep honeycomb labyrinth of flavor, transfixed on the characteristics of the honey added, more so than any other beer brewed with honey I've ever encountered. Almost mead-like, this higher alcohol brew (though its strength isn't even hinted at) is incredibly smooth with floral, spice, and orange citrus complexities tying the whole brew together in one exceptional drinking experience!"

"Rich golden in color with excellent clarity. A half inch thick rocky white head rests on top. Aroma of chamomile and sweet honey. The flavor is of floral chamomile and dry,yet gently sweet honey. The mouthfeel is dry and there's a warming sensation in the mouth. There's more honey in the fade,but the sweetness is strained."

"Drinkable enough, but was looking for more depth of flavor; worth a try, but not one I would buy again. Props to Sammy for trying this venerable old style on a large scale, maybe only the second or 3rd of this style I remember trying"

"O- I love honey, so I love this beer. It is a little strange though."
"O: A solid honey ale that definitely treads into mead territory, which is what a braggot is supposed to be. It is pretty one dimensional in terms of being honey forward with the nice floral aspect, but that's all it really needs. A great summertime/warm weather brew"

"An enjoyable braggot, as far as braggots go. I'd recommend this one to a ticker trying to tick away this particular style. It's not a bad go-around."

"Overall: Good brew and I respect it, but this one is just not for me."
""
"My first braggot, so I can't really compare to others in the style. As a mead fan, though, I can see the appeal. Light and refreshing, not overwhelmingly sweet considering the amount of honey, worth trying. It's enough to make me pursue other braggots."

"Taste is sweet, bready, absolutely has the honey! Very slight bite on the finish. A definite thirst quencher. (Makes me want to try mead next!)"
"Overall this is an interesting beer, I was not sure what to expect from the style, but it was pleasant. Not the greatest, but good, especially during a warm summer day."
""

"The braggot exits the bomber a nice yellow color--almost reminiscent of honey--with a cap of cotton white foam. Lot's of bubbles rising up. Pale malt, wheat, bread, honey, grassy hops form the aroma. On the palate, the honey stands through the center. It's dry and a little sweet as it sticks around after the swallow. The sweetness is strong (this is a honey beer), but it isn't over the top. Bitterness at the end does much to provide balance."
""
""
"Overall a good beer if you like your beer sweet."
""

"I believe this os my first braggot. Was thinking about trying this once as a home brew, but this is easier. Thanks Boston Beer for brewing this one."
"Overall: This beer should be part of their summer series, it is perfect for warm weather and would be a my go to over most summer ales and hefeweizens. I am not sure if that's their marketing scheme but they should go for it. Drink up and enjoy....Salud!"
