"O- really nice braggot, easily the best one I've had."
"Well made and nicely done."
"Really enjoying this, well blended and really leaves pleasant flavors in the mouth, will have to get another."
"D: I love Braggot so I immediately ordered this beer when I saw it on-tap. It's nice that so many local brewers are experimenting with honey beers. More on the beer side than most of the braggots I've had, I love both genres. Springtime puts it perfectly, hard to imagine drinking this at any other time, a great beer for late spring."
