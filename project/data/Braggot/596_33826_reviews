"Decent head which crests over a finger, mostly larger bubbles so doesn’t persist that long, pleasingly orangish tan color, the lacing forms thick streaks, however, these too aren’t long for this world. Rich amber red color, bright shine to it, lots of large and swiftly moving bubbles. Big, brash nose of honey, candied orange peel, cocoa and caramel, sweet is what it does best, lighter dough to processed grains presence, apple, pear, peach to fig fruit scents, textural thickness has it glued to your nostrils for some time. Full-bodied, the carbonation is working overtime but not going to match the layered power and heaviness it presents. More mineral to metallic notes as well as grass and bread crust, still it remains all about the honey. The orange citrus expands into white grapefruit. The caramel verges onto butterscotch syrup and vanilla pudding. There is a burnt touch, like caramelized brown sugar. The fruit lacks clarity, lump of peach, apricot and fig. At the very end you get a fizzy tickle. Does come off as boozy, you feel the alcohol. A very sweet in style beer that likely is best utilized as a dessert beverage or to counter a very spicy and heavy main course dish."
"Pours a hazy dark amber body with a white head. Smells malty, honey, sweet cane sugar, molasses, dark fruits. Taste is honey, spice, sweet toffee, molasses, roasty on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium heavy, rich body. Overall a very enjoyable beer, a great representation of the style."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, golden-amber coloring with only a ring of white film on the surface. Aromas of honey sweetness, dark and rich, with some fruity highlights like cider. Subtle nutmeg sweetness on the nose, too. Flavors are rich and toasty, with a honey and toffee sweet backbone. Nutmeg spicing and subtle apple sweetness brings a hot cider feel to the palate, and there are some peppery hops characteristics towards the end of the palate that help clean up. Smooth, mid-bodied with a roasty and sweet aftertaste. The finish is light, slightly frothy, with a hops bitterness at the end."

"Taste starts out with a honey-like sweetness, malt backbone is solid, slight hop presence to balance things enough but is very muted and knows to stay out of the way, carbonation is low but more than present, it is soft and lends a decent body to the beer as well."

"Hazy, burnt orange pour, with a white collar of bubbles. Sweet, malty aroma, light stone fruits, and herbal notes. Taste was pretty similar, caramel malts, sweet corn, honeysuckle, indistinct stone fruit, vegetal, stiff with dry booze. Yep, this was essentially a glorified malt liquor. Mouthfeel was pretty thinned out, about light-medium in body. Not much distinctiveness or flavor. Not something I'd go for again."

"Nice drinkability. This one has to be drank slow due to its thickness, but it really has a nice flavor overall and superb mouthfeel. Alcohol warming effects are noticable after only a short while."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this unique offering. It was a delightful and intriguing adventure every step of the way."
"Wow, this was good. Perfect beer for cold weather, so subtle and warming, yet deceptively strong and intense. You don't recognize its strength until about ten minutes after you finish. One of the best from PB."
"Another big beer winner from Tod and the folks at PB...the perfect beer for the winter season IMO."

"Wasn't going to have this, because I really didn't like the only other braggot I had tried. My wife had one, gave me a taste, and I had to have one of my own. Served in a snifter, it was a dark brown, with a small head and some nice lacing. It had a sweet, dark fruity aroma. A sweet honey taste, with some hops, that just kept coming at you. Very assertive, but not in your face. A definite hit. Try it, by all means."
"It's a sin that this was released on the unwitting masses. Brother Adam had better be careful when travelling down this slippery slope."
