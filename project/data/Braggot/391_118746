3.5,0,,,,,,"Overall - For my first braggot, there is a good balance of honey and beer characteristics. An unusual style that is difficult to pinpoint which qualities are true to the style.","leaddog","Beers"
3.6,0,,,,,,"A decent enough shotgun marriage of beer and mead, the honey's complexity (rock on, southern Alberta apiaries!), outshining the base malt (no big loss) throughout. I'm just a little hard-pressed to avoid comparisons to that bottom shelf denizen, malt liquor - the florals and elevated alcohol making it oh so hard not to - at least that part's mostly in my head, I think.","biboergosum","0"
