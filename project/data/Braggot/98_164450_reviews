"The taste just did not do anything for me. The honey sweetness was rejected by the floral bitterness.  In other words, they did not mix together well.  I found myself wincing from time to time because the flavors were too opposite of each other rather than complimenting each other.  Not a drain pour I promise. But it was slow to finish."
"Honey and hops is an interesting idea, but the honey is the forefront on this one. Strange balance, backwards by my judgement. Sink dump, whump whump"

"Fullish in body, the taste of hops and alcohol offer strong reprieve from the malt and honey with dryness, spiciness and heat all its own. Acetone-rich to close, the roughness of alcohol hides behind the bitter hop resins nicely as their linger of fruit and pine needle extend indefinitely."
"The flavor starts bitter and finishes sweet. Neither are extreme. Full bodied, almost chewy. Just enough carbonation to give it a spritz. I like this combination of flavors. This is not as cloy as most braggots. Definitely worth trying."

"This is definitely interesting, but doesn't feel all that much like a braggot, because the mead aspect is not that prominent, beyond the simple honey presence."
