"Worth the wait for the next offering in the Exit Series. Some blueberry tones, but not too much. 15% abv seems high, but who am I to judge. Had this one on Good Friday."
"Excellent taste, feel, but be careful it packs a punch. 15% abv is strong"

"O: This is a very powerful beer; an adventurous offering. As an unabashed NJ supporter I love these guys,  but share this with friends because it's strong."

"Not great..heavy taste..You can't taste the strong abv but it's ok"
"What stuck out in the aftertaste was the mint-line briskness of the aftertaste and the booze. Boy, was this strong for a beer and even for a Braggot, this was about as heavy as one could get when it came to the alcohol. While not a knockout, this was no brew to be messed with and by the time I polished off this 25.4 oz. bottle, I could feel the warming and subtly overpowering effect of the alcohol. While not quite as good the other offerings in the Exit series, this was a worthy addition to the line and a solid beer to complement a winter that doesn't quite want to go away yet. Flying Fish is still one the best and creative breweries in my home state and this is another example of what that's so. Grab a bottle and let the warm up to the style has to offer!"

"Sweet taste, the blueberry comes out.  Could use a little more carbonation, but very pleasant overall."

"so so harsh.  buttery.  medicinal"

"Honey and Belgian yeast. Just the slightest touch of blueberry. For 15%, the abv is hidden extremely well. Why do I feel that Flying Fish is lying on the abv?"

"Overall I enjoyed it but it didn't leave a big impression."
"Overall the blueberries don't add a classic flavor, but have really taken the braggot to a different level.  Real enjoyable brew and delicious."
""
"A solid beer. Not the best. But good."
""
"Where the hell are the blueberries in this!?"
"Real nice look which is a light copper color.  Blueberry smell of course with a bit of orange and sage.  Flavor is mainly blueberry with some orange, sage, honey and a bit of a bubble gum flavor. Definitely taste alcohol as well but not dominant. Reminds me oft a mild blueberry brandy but not near as thick and other flavors do come out. Mouthfeel is a little slick with light carbonation.  Overall an interesting treat as rarely get opportunity to have a braggot.  A sipper that would go great at a bonfire.  Hammonton should be proud as blueberries really come through.  Another unique exit series offering."

"Alcohol is hidden well, but it is extremely too sweet"
"I haven't had a braggot in a really long time, so this was a nice change of pace. A beautiful blend of ingredients between the honey, malt, blueberry, orange peel, lemon peel, and Belgian and Champagne yeasts. I even noticed a couple pieces of blueberry skin at the bottom of my glass. I will most likely snatch up a bottle of this if I see it somewhere. A real treat to try on tap."

"Flying Fish's regular lineup is mostly forgettable, but that's not the case for the Exit Series. It's been a long time coming, but this latest Exit Series beer is quite different from the others but still excellent."
""
"The taste has a sweet malt flavor with gentle fruity quality with more honey and thick chewy malt with light medicinal edge and slight spice with dry alcohol flavor in the finish with very low berry in comparison to honey. Overall not a bad braggot, ok as far as drinkability goes -pretty smooth considering it is 15% alcohol"

"Alcohol is very present. Almost like a liqueor. Sticky sweet. Very interesting. Not necessarily blueberry, but a strong fruit presence."
"Surprisingly good, not overpowered by alcohol, in fact very drinkable for such a high abv, not at all overly sweet, well balanced, with nice blueberry backbone coming through.  I really enjoyed it, and I can't say I have ever been a big FF fan."
