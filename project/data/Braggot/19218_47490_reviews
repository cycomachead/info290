"Overall- I liked it much more than I thought I would. The honey wine (or mead) used seems to be high quality. The ginger is essential for balance. If you can drink a Moscato, this will be no problem. This is sweet, this is a honey bomb, but it is manageable."

"Not the best braggot I've had, but certainly interesting. If sweet is your thing, tally-ho, if not, don't even look at the bottle. Good beer...or whatever."

"This is a very tasty sweet brew. Definitely different and should be enjoyed with dessert."

"O: A new style that I had not ever had (nor reviewed) before today. Very interesting with the mixture of the honey/mead-like flavor and the spices. Glad that I tried it but not sure that I would describe it as easy to drink. I would like to try this beer again along with some others in the style in the future. Not something that I be able to have multiple of these in a single session."
"O: The alcohol is well hidden from the taste of this beer, which makes it relatively easy to drink, but it is probably better sipped. Iâ€™m not sure if I could drink an entire bottle of this so it is probably better shared with friends."

"Overall- The beer aspect of this Braggot takes a back seat to the honey and spice character. This would be a really nice offering around the holidays with the cinnamon and bready quality."
"D - I'm not a big fan of the aroma, but otherwise this is a solid braggot. Would probably pair nicely with Christmas cake, but I'm just not a huge fan of these flavors. I'll still to my Kuhnhenn braggots in the future."
"M-not sure how much of this one I can drink but good."

"This brew poured out as a nice brown color with a fizzy tan colored head. The head has a light retention to it leaving a touch of lacing. The smell of the beer is a little boozy but has a sweet malt and honey aroma. The taste of the beer has a very nice sweet flavor, very smooth and had just a hint of spice to it. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied and has a nice smooth texture to it. Overall I found this brew to be quite nice. Highly enjoyable as the brew warmed up."
"Having a difficult time deciding how to rate this since I've so little experience with these beers. Poured with a small, fine, light tan head and a bit of lace. Color is a cloudy, cherry amber. Aroma is malt, honey, ginger. Flavor is similar to nose, quite sweet with slight carbonic tang to cut and balance the imposing sweetness. Body is I'm thinking what it should be and carbonation is ok. Finish is like flavor, tapering to faintly ginger tinted honey of good length. Not bad; good dessert beer."
"overall a unique beer. my first braggot so i lack a sample base, but in terms of general enjoyment i feel it's firmly in the '4' realm. and while i'm glad to have tried it, it probably won't be a repurchase, especially at this price point (nearly $20.00)."
"Poured a dark orange-amber with a creamy white head. Huge aromas of honey-sweet malt, spicy ginger and a touch of oxidation. Really phenomenal nose, the ginger is amazing. Too bad the good vibrations from the nose don't carry into the taste, just a cloyingly sweet mess of honey, malt, and ginger. Like a poorly-made ginger mead at this point, I'm sad to say. Mouthfeel is big and sticky, with a full body and low carbonation. Overall I think this may have been good at one point, but it's a sweet mess now."
"Other comments: Yikes. This was not really worth the space it took up in my suitcase. Too sweet and heavy."
"My first braggot so I don't really know how to compare it. I'll assume it's good."
"4/4/3.5/4/4"
"Considering the style and what this is, exactly, I'd say this is rather drinkable. However, with the formidable alcohol, and nearly obscene sweetness, this is certainly something to be enjoyed slowly and in moderation."
"MF/D: Thinner body than I expected. Doesn't have the mouth coating richness I for some reason assumed it would have, but still very nice."
"Overall, this a really good and interesting beer. It's my first braggot so can't say how it compares to style but if it's a good representation than I'm going to have to find some more mead styles. Only wish is that the ginger was less dominant. I love it in foods but not in drinks for some reason. High recommendation on this one. Rotation: web order. It's pricey and hard to get so this may be my only one of it. Would definitely try on tap. Also would be more likely to buy if it was in 12oz format. At this ABV and price, the 750ml is too much."
"Drinkability - reminds me of hard Christmas candy. Oh yeah, I like this and would pick it up again in a heartbeat despite the hefty price. One for the cold temps, but this is a fine pick to celebrate the 15th anniversary for me and my bride. Cheers honey!"
"D: This is a delicious beverage and one I've greatly enjoyed. Quite easy to drink for its weight. I probably drank the 750 in about an hour at most. Expensive, but a must for any fan of mead or the Middle Ages."
"M + D: If it were any bigger in body, it would take an already intense drink well over the top and make it both incredibly cloying and a real struggle to finish. I'd still describe it as being 'medium-bodied,' though it is riding a very fine line to being 'full-bodied.' It would help to have some better descriptive phrases for mouthfeel, I suppose. There's a slight viscosity to it, which makes sense, but it doesn't come across as being as heavy in body as some of the more sizable Russian Imperial Stouts or barleywines. It's more 'slippery,' while otherwise having some fairly competitive fullness to it. Most certainly a sipping brew, and one that can certainly be appreciated over the course of an hour or a couple, even. It performs well both straight out of the fridge, and after a little time to breathe - in which time it really just opens itself up and lets loose like that friend that has a tendency to over-share. It works out alright in the end (strangely, kinda like that friend!) and can make for a very rewarding bottle to enjoy."
"D - Upon my first whiff after popping the cork, I thought this was going to be a sickly sweet mess, much like some meads I've had. Thankfully the carbonation alleviates this issue and the sweetness is kept in check very nicely. I've gone through almost the entire 500ml over the course of this review and hardly noticed. I don't know that this is anything I'd ever purchase again aside from occassional novelty or curiosity, but it's definitely a well-deserved experience. Two bad a half liter of this stuff costs ~$15!"
"The first Braggot I've ever had! 750mL corked and caged bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a hazy bubbly dark orange with a decent khaki head. Aroma is an intriguing blend of brown malts, honey and slight spice with just a slight trace of hops. The taste is an absolutely breathtaking blend of sweet fruits, honey, slight brown malts, spices and traces of ginger, brown sugar and caramel, incredibly complex. The beer is certainly on the heavy side with a decent amount of boozy alcohol, but nothing too overbearing. This one is certainly a sipper, especially on a hot late Spring night, but it is enjoyable"
"D: Drinkability was good in limited proportions (a bomber will surfice here). Very boozy at 10.0%abv and sweet from the honeywine of course limits multiples. A rare style, but a very good showing at that. Has that old world feel to it and will definitely warm you on that cold winter day."
"A spot-on example of a Braggot. Malty with honey and spicing. Beer/meade mix. Sweet, but balanced. Very easy to drink for abv."
"A strong beer with out all the work, a nice one to along with a spicy meal."
