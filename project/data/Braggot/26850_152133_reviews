"Weirdest beer I've ever had as it started with burnt rubber and a medicinal band aid flavor. As it warmed it became more acceptable as the honey made an appearance. It became kind of smoky and jerky like as it yielded a caramel apple flavor. Like I said... weirdest beer ever!"

"Would've been nice if they'd left the smoke out of it."
