"I don't know if carbonation would help this beer. While the uniqueness that characterizes OEC's offerings is definitely there, this just doesn't carry through desirable flavors."

"Don't love this...tart and slightly metallic."

"Foil capped, 500ml bottle served in a snifter.  Batch 1 - 11.4.2014 decanted for 30 minutes and served at cellar temp per the recommendations on the label.  Pours a deep brown with some ruby highlights when backlit.  No head; just a thin sudsy band around the shoulders.  Nose is quite vinous and somewhat reminiscent of a Bourdeaux.  There are also notes of oak and balsamic vinegar.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a hint of honey sweetness.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a virtually still carbonation.  This is a very acidic beer and it almost leaves the back of the throat feeling a bit parched between quaffs.  Overall, very interesting with a great deal of complexity.  Very different than any braggot I've ever had.  Well worth seeking out."

"Extremely complex.  Has an umami feel to it that touches a lot of different tastes."

"O-  I haven't had many braggots to compare this to, but this beer was extremely unique, full of flavor, and quite tasty.  OEC has been pumping out some very unique and interesting blends and this is no exception.  I wouldn't recommend this for everyone but it's definitely worth the try."

"Bottle. Had this next to their Grandis. I am guessing that was the base beer. Well this one had coffee mead in it? It pours like a liqueur or brandy. Looks oily and actually leaves legs on the glass. No bubbles. The aroma is tart and has some diacetyl and acetone characteristics. An airy sweetness ripe with dried dark fruits. Not picking up much roast or coffee character. The flavor is also not very roasty or coffee-like. It's sweet but also sour and tannic. Vinous. Very, very rich. Woody and oaky. Slick feel with almost zero carbonation. Dense. Not sure I have had a beer quite like this. It will definitely make a place in my memory banks."
