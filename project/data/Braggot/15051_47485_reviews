"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a nice red-orange amber with a slight off-white head and little lacing. Sweet honey and malt aroma. Medium bodied with sweet malt and honey, light spicing. A bit on the sweet side, but flavorful and a nice change from the usual hopped beers. I will definitely buy again."
"D: It's a sipper. Not too bad."
"Corked and caged - pours a two finger cream head that leaves a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Malty/alcohol nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is honey, caramel and some alcohol. Can't detect the ginger. Decent braggot. Warming. Pricey at $15.50 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"The aroma has honey, ginger, spice, brown sugar, malt grains, grass, and earth. The appearance is amber with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma with a paper like taste in the finish. The palate is nice. Overall its only ok. I love the style but this just doesn't wow me."
