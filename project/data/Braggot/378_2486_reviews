"O- Overall this is a very good brew both aged and fresh.  Braggots are pretty unique and something that I would like to see done more often.  I love the honey accent to it."

"O: my first sip of this overpowered me with sweetness. On my second sip, with perhaps my buds adjusted, it was obviously not something I was going to drain-pour as syrup. That said, it was still an interesting beer that reminds me a lot of a hopped-up hard cider in its opening sweetness and an overly sweet barley wine in its dark sugar ending."

"An amazing dessert beer"

"O - this is my first Braggot (not that they're popular). Can't say I've ever tried mead before either. I really enjoyed this. A nice drink to sip on, as it is sweet and high in abv (though neither are overpowering. Worth picking up a bottle - aged, if you can find it."

"The beer pours a dark, murky, amber brown, like honey muddled with mud and water. The beer pours with a thin ring of bubbles that fizzle away and appear almost soda-like in quality. The beer’s body is murky, like fresh honey. The other side of the glass is indiscernible through the haze, but some light does travel through the beer. It leaves a thin set of legs on the glass when it washes up against the sides. On the nose, the beer smells richly of fresh, wildflower honey. Sticky and rich on the nose, the honey muddles with thick caramel malts, similar to Long Trail’s Triple Bag. Maple syrup, honey, toffee, and even some chocolate fudge touch upon the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sticky sweet but a little too bitter, with a bit of a bite on the middle of the palate. Hot booze tingles as the beer travels down the throat, and the finish is a little dry for what I want with just a touch of boozy sweet. On the tongue, the beer is on the heavy side of medium, practically heavy, with a chewy, slightly rough mouthfeel and faint carbonation. The beer bites at the tongue, oddly enough, which takes away from the rich, honeyed flavors that the beer should possess. It does, however, gel on the back of the tongue with some syrupy goodness. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet caramel barley, which turns into fiery alcohol with some interesting spice character and a touch of woodiness on the middle of the palate. The finish is hot and cloying with fusel notes. Touches of stone fruit and raisins can briefly be felt on the tongue, but really this beer is all about the hot booze on the finish. The aftertaste finally brings hints of sticky sweet honey to the tongue, where it creates a pool of saliva. As the beer warms it mellows some of its rougher edges, but still hits the palate with too much booze and not enough honey character. Overall, this beer is lacking in sweet, soft honey flavors that I want from it. I want a sticky thick beer but this just doesn’t quite deliver for me. The smell is rich with honey character but I get none in the taste. I suspect that with time in a cellar, this beer will open up into a rich and unique dessert beer, but it’s a bit of a hot mess fresh. Complexity in this beer opens up the warmer it is, but it still is a muddled mess on the palate. If you have a bottle, sit on it."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, almost opaque, brown coloring with a thin, whispy coat of white film on the surface. Nose of rich honey, apple sweet, roast caramel, and booze highlights. Smells very rich, with some earthy tones, also. Flavors are rich and sweet on the forward tongue, with a blending of roast caramel and honey balancing well. Rich and sweet, with a subtle warmth building as you drink, and a shift of the palate towards a more honey focused characteristic. Tangy sweet and rich into the aftertaste, with a cleanliness in the finish thanks to the body and the booze. The body is smooth and robust, which works perfectly with the flavor profiles. Solid brew."

"Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper, its a big beer. As for would I search this one out...not me. I actually brewed a braggot, and I have to say that it was much more drinkable than this one, just a better flavor overall. This one is too one dimensional with its only flavor being that huge caramel deal. I'm glad to have tried this beer but it's not one that I'd come back to."

"This is a barley wine/bragget ale that definitely tastes like an ale. I had this at room temperature, in the English fashion. As such, it gave a nice, full head, mildly carbonated, thinnish mouthfeel. Nice amber color, otherwise tasted like an average ale. Not too bitter, definitely not sweet. Did not pick up on any honey or other allegedly complex notes, but as the ale is meant to mature with age, could have just been too young. Overall, not exciting, but not terrible. I'd probably try it again in a different format to see if there was any difference."
"Overall - It's pretty good. Nothing terribly exciting, but nice flavors."
"Overall I really enjoyed this braggot. It reminded me of an English old ale or barleywine. I think they pulled off an excellent marriage in the flavors of honey and malt. Well done!"

"Wifey and I picked this up during our honeymoon at MDI and saved it for a snowy day. Made some fine Blizzard Nemo drinking in the dark."

"O: Fantastic! One of the best brews of the tasting which included some killer beers. My first bragget was indeed a treat and I wish i could get more of these."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into crooked stave glass. Pours a brown/orange with much more carbonation than I expected. Slight ring of head. Lots of dried fruit and figgy raison aroma, with a huge dose of booze. Very similar flavor, figgy dried fruit, slightly sweet, and lots of peppery heat. Not overly done, but a great great brew. Very similar to an aged barley wine, and just awesome. Worth the wait."
"O - Overall, this was a decent enough beer from a somewhat readily available brewery. Still though, far too much booze/heat for being roughly 2 years old."

"This beer poured out as a slightly murky looking gold color with a really nice white head on top. The head was foamy and soft looking, it also had a good retention but not much lacing. The smell of the beer is of course an assault of honey aromas with a touch of malt in there too. No hop aroma at all. The taste of the beer betters as it warms up but at no point in time does this beer disappoint in this category. The beer is more malty when it's cold, as the beer warms the honey profile really shines through. The mouthfeel is very smooth, it's soft and very easy to drink, low carbonation but just enough to keep it alive and the booze comes out a little more as the beer warms. Overall I thought this was a very nice example of a Braggot, I would personally enjoy aging this beer and seeing how it evolves over time."
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. The honey is there and makes the beer smooth, but some alcohol is pretty prevelant in the taste. Think some more time would have done this one well, but still a pretty nice beer."
""
"O: The thin body and booziness detract, although the beer is interesting."
""
""
""
"*Just adding that I had my 2007 vintage, not much a difference in the beer excpet a much more noticable alcohol flavor, still remains one of my top favorites."
"B"
""
"O: though I can feel the alcohol burn going down, this is almost hard to believe this is a beer. This is definitely a dessert beer for two reasons: 1) the sweetness 2) the abv will help you sleep. I would definitely get this again."
"O: A good and drinkable brew, whether it's a Honey Ale, Braggot or Barley Wine."

"I easily give two Schlitz for this great bragget. I'm glad that I waited until the winter months to consume this bottle, though it is light enough in feel for year-round consumption."
""

"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stronger beer to sip on for a while but there are other high-ABV beers that I would pick first."
""
""
""
"I really liked this one, and the best of the style (from my limited experience)."
"Pretty enjoyable beer. High alcohol, very sweet lote of honey but overall a ll balanced beer. This one will get you drunk. Overall this is a really enjoyable beer and one i would have again for sure. Thanks!"
"A really well aged beer. Not at all like when it's fresh. Very intense and complex, but ultimately similar to a red wine in flavor and drinkability. A really really good bragget. Need more now"
"Aroma is of sweet malt and light honey. Appearance is of a dark honey color, almost reddish. The taste is of sweet honey, almost sugary bread, light butterscotch, spicy mix. As it sits on your palate after a sip, it warms, probably from the higher alcohol content. Overall, this was very good. I had this with a good cigar, and it was the perfect compliment. It was pricey at $11 for a little over a pint, but it was delicious. I would buy a few of these if I come across them again, and put them away for a good drink with a stogie. I bought this after a tour of the Atlantic Brewing Company in Bar Harbor last weekend."
"This is an interesting and fairly rare style of beer, so it is hard to judge. It is similar to barleywine, which I prefer more. And if I wanted something strong that tastes like honey, I'd pour myself some mead. Despite this, I would recommend this beer to anyone visiting the area, as you can often find it on the shelves around here."
"O- Tasty brew. It was my first Braggot so I was expecting something very different it didnt satisfy in terms of that."
"Pours a slightly cloudy reddish orange amber color with a decent fluffy white head that has moderate retention. Smells of honey, sweet bready malt, caramel, butterscotch, slightly spicy with a hint of oxidation. It really screams English ale to me if that makes any kind of sense. Taste is malty and sweet. Lots of ripe fruit mixed with a honey bready thing. Slightly spicy most of the way through, but finishes with a twinge of alcohol and a lingering earthy bitterness. Medium to thick body, light carbonation, sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. I found this quite complex, but I feel the flavors are still competing, maybe this needs some time. Its good now, but I suspect it might be great with some age."
"Thanks to my father for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a hazy brownish-orange color with a small white head. The aroma is full of honey, but I also get some light floral notes. The flavor is more complex than the aroma. The honey and floral notes are present once again, but I also get a ton of sugary sweetness and some dark fruit notes. The alcohol is very noticeable. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D: Pleasant overall, but quite strong. It would probably take me a couple hours to down a bottle of this by myself."
" This is interesting overall. I was expecting this to be a bit heavy but it was anything but. I think the nose is better then the taste but it's a neat drink I must say. I would have to be in the right mood though to have this on occasion."
"I let the bottle warm up a bit out of the fridge before opening. Very interesting brew. Poured with decent foamy, thick, slightly creamy, light tan head and lots of lace. Color is a clear, dark orange copper amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is honey, malt, and a bit of funk. Flavor is the most interesting part - truly a cross between ale and mead. Malt, a hint of bitter hop and honey - minus the heavy honey flavors retaining only the smooth, mellow qualities. Body is full and lush with perfect carbonation to cut through the sweetness. Finish is like flavor and is quite long. Excellent after dinner beer; maybe one of the best I’ve ever had."
"Overall - an interesting beer and an interesting style. Not one of my favorite styles even though I am an avid fan of barleywines. I would have liked a little more spice. However, I'm happy to now be acquainted with a truly ancient style of brewing. Big thanks to the folks at Atlantic Brewing for taking a few risks."
"O: A potent and highly warming mouthful - this makes no bones about being a nearly 12% braggot (unlike a couple others I've really enjoyed). No real problems with this fact, especially when imbibed slowly and cautiously. Glad I got a chance to try this (thanks to Alan) and a braggot I'd have again, sharing next time."
"D - Not a horrible beer, considering how much this style can turn into a honey-bomb. Fairly easy to drink with some nice balancing fruit tastes."
"D: Goes down easily, pretty tasty, somewhat filliing, pretty strong kick though not overpowering. This is a sipper, albeit one that goes down very easy."
"D - Cloying towards the end, it's most definitely better split. A very good beer though. I love mead and I love barleywine. The combo here is well-done."
"I wasn't a fan of the mouthfeel it's medium light not much carbonation. The drinkability depends on your sweetness tolerance, etc. For me, I do like sweeter stuff but my 6oz pour was plenty."
"D: Of course the drinkability was not high, nor do I believe it was designed to be pounded in large quantities. On that note, this was pretty drinkable stuff!"
"D: I thought this was very enjoyable. I wouldn't want a huge quantity of this, or probably any braggot for that matter, but I could certainly see myself sipping on a mug of this ancient beverage while strolling around Renn Fest."
"I think this is an American quad with something added. In keeping with the Massachusetts Pretty Things theme I want to guess its Baby Tree perhaps."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a warm, honey and pale malt scent. It's a little sweet in the nose, but definately bold with lots of alcohol warmth. The taste is much the same. It's sweet up front with a good honey character; lots of alcohol warmth and a solid pale malt base. This is a young beer that needs some aging to mellow out. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty beer. I wish I had a few to stash away to try in a few years."
"Pours a hazy body with a color similar to medium or dark honey, which is fitting since its brewed with honey. Less than a finger of khaki head that quickly fades to leave little lacing on the glass. Smells of honey, plums, figs, rock candy and lots of toasted malts, faint hint of booze. Tastes of, you guessed it, honey mostly, sweet bready grains, dark fruits and currants, caramel, slightly vinous, and a little bitter citrus. No hint of the nearly 12% ABV contained within, and not overly bitter or sweet, very well balanced. Velvety smooth, low carbonation, viscous and coating but not syrupy or filmy. Dangerously easy to drink! Not at all hot, very tasty and aromatic, great body and feel. An all around superb beer!"
"This seems to be more along the lines of an English Barlywine. A nice slow sipper."
"D: Actually pretty good. I had minimal expectations of this beer since I've never had a braggot before and just a handful of meads. Pretty easy to drink, although the alcohol does begin to ""wear"" on you."
"D - A snifter of this is just about the perfect amount. Alcohol is a bit on the intense side limiting its drinkability. Nice sweet flavors - most likely this would be even more enjoyable in front of a fire on a winter night rather than outside on a warm summer day. Might also benefit from a bit of age to temper the alcohol heat just a bit."
"Nothin' like sippin' a braggot while watching an international law-based film (""Pirate Radio"" for the interested). It pours a partly cloudy garnet topped by a minor bit of ecru foam. The nose comprises honey (wow, no way!), white grapes, cane sugar, riesling, wheat, maple syrup, light citrus hops, and well-baked biscuits. The taste is very similar, with the honey and white wine-ish notes taking center stage, and then some. A nice bit of orange peel bitterness rides on up near the end to provide an added layer of complexity. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, a solid braggot, but not necessarily something to constantly return to."
"A: Good head retention for a high alcohol beer, the color reminds me of a slightly opaque iced tea, little visible activity in the beer, the beer moves with a slight sluggishness indicating some viscosity - 4.00, S: Noticeable orange and spice, honey is apparent though not overpowering, alcohol makes a showing, some fig and mild raisin aromas - 4.25, T: Palate is slanted towards that of an distilled liquor rather than a beer/mead, alcohol has a large role on the flavor profile and reminds me a little of rum, some golden raisin and dark molasses like sweetness - 3.50, M: Dry and with a very fine sandpaper like grit - 3.50, D: My first braggot so I'm not sure what to really expect, at the same time this seemed even less like a beer than what I was expecting, the high alcohol puts enough of a dry burn to take away a little from the drinkability - 2.50"
"A most interesting twist on a Barleywine and resurrection of an ancient style. Pour into a snifter, allow it to warm, and enjoy like a fine spirit."
"D - There is enough honey here to keep this from being a strait barleywine and certainly enough malt to distinguish it from a mead, so I guess it lives up to what is promised on the label. However, it doesn't have the depth of character that I would expect from such a strong beer, while it also is lacking in intensity of honey character. It is a somewhat muddy mixture of dull, flabby honey and nondescript brown malt which is just shy of cloyingly sweet in the finish. I would have hoped for some brighter honey character and perhaps a greater complexity to the caramel malt, but both of these areas end up lacking. I don't know the age of this bottle (it seems to lack any sort of dating) and it might improve with time but as it stands, it is a bit of a disappointment."
"M/D - Light to medium body and very sticky feel."
"This beer reminds me of why I'm not a mead drinker. Quite a beautiful beer, but that's about all it has going for me. Very honey sweet and a strange hop bitterness that doesn't quite work for me. Yes, honey and hops is good in HopSlam, but this is completely different. Thinnish body and low carbonation."
"D- Reasonably drinkable... but the alcohol isn't really hidden at all. That boozy heat somewhat detracts from the drinkability... but I would certainly have this beer again."
"Brother Adam's Bragget is pretty good stuff. I'm not a huge fan of the style, and it doesn't change that. But, it's pretty tasty given its limited range. It's really not deep or complex at all, but still tastes good. The nose needs work, but it performs pretty well otherwise. If you're looking to knock off the style, this is a fine place to do it. If that's not the case, it's still well worth a try."
"D - Especially for the ABV, very unassuming and drinkable."
"The alcohol is just too hot for me. Perhaps it would be better with a little age on it. Unfortunately there's no date on the bottle."
"Drinkability: Love the sweet honey malt taste. A sipper but I could have a couple. Very unique as a beer and for the style. While the alcohol is not hidden, it is not as noticable for a beer with abv."
"D - A supremely good drink for such a big honey fermented beer the 4 years seems to have added a dry texture to the overall mouthfeel and reduced some of the level of sweetness as I had this fresh on my birthday last June and it seemed less dry. It is so smooth -I am so glad I got to try this on tap + w/ 4 years of age on it!"
"Overall, things verge on cloying, but never quite get to that point. A sweet mead can be far more cloying, and despite the obvious rich malt flavor, the mellow hop bitterness, along with the noticeable alcohol, is just enough to keep the sweetness from going too far. A very nice experience, indeed, this would undoubtedly do well with a little age."
"I expected it to be dry, but its not. Medium body, lots of odd sweetness, its not like sugar though...very odd. Second taste, there is some plum fruitiness in there and a lingering sweetness. I don't know what to say. Its much bigeer than a beer I would normally drink, lots of flowery flavors, interesting but not a repeat. Its also completely making me drunk."
"Lots of sweet honey in the aroma, a faint general fruitiness and plenty of booze. I strained to find some caramel. Not really doing much for me, it's very alcoholic. The taste follows with initial honey/fruit sweetness. Medium bodied with a somewhat overly assertive carbonation for the style. Finishes with plenty of booze and a slight tangy spice note. Overall, very robust and alcoholic. I bet it would age well, But I am glad that I shared this one."
"Despite being a sipper, it's surprisingly easy to drink. The flavors are very good. I wish there was just a hint more bitterness to balance it out, but I won't count that against it since it's supposed to be sweet (or a dessert beer as it says on the bottle)."
"Drinkability is good. One of the best barleywines I've had, very smooth and easy to drink. Sweetness isn't overpowering, and alcohol is nothing but a faint note."
"D: Slowly enjoyed this one myself. Nice beer, first I have had of this style. I like it."
"I was looking forward to trying this style, which I am not familiar with, and trying to give this the benefit of a doubt. It certainly is interesting, and I'm glad I tried it, but I can't really say that I enjoyed it very much. I'm a fan a barleywines, and I'm a fan of sweet ales (and in fact, had a bit of a desire for one tonight, which is why I broke this one out) but this just is not doing it for me."
"my first full serving of braggot... meh..."
"Moderate carbonation in the mouthfeel. No complaints there. Drinkability may hamper some people's outlook as the beer is very sweet and very boozy. I submit that I will likely be done after drinking this one (4 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon)."
"Really a very enjoyable beer - delicious, and perhaps its simplicity is an asset rather than a hindrance."
"This beer is surprisingly good. It does indeed have qualities of both a barleywine and a braggot and I heartily recommend it."
"D: Although there are some negatives going on here, this beer has its good points. The look and aroma are quite nice. The more I drink, the more I get used to the sweetness in the flavor. I enjoyed this but this wasn't exactly what I was looking for when I pour a braggot. Maybe my buddies have it all wrong when they brew it, but they tend to get their sweetness from a robust honey flavor rather than what is going on here. Still, no problem clearing this bomber, and I wouldn't mind sharing a bottle of this with someone else in the future. Not bad, Brother Adam."
"i held onto this good looking maine beer for a couple of months since i was so excited for it and waiting for a special occassion to drink it. unfortunately, it fell a little short. ruby, translucent in appearance... aroma of sweet honey, grape juice, caramel malts... taste of alcohol, sour liquorice, and a lingering burntness... mouthfeel is quite dry and acidic... overall, a lackluster taste and quite strong. a lot of wine-qualities here."
"This 2005 bottle aged at and purchased at the brewery in Bar Harbor was opened and sampled by me and a friend on 11/12/08. The liquid was a clear amber color in our glasses with minimal white head. The retention was weak and the lacing spotty, but it was also so old I suppose that was to be expected. The aroma was semi-sweet and complex, various malts and spices along with ripened fruit, sweet esters and honey. The flavors were full of honey, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, apples and a general spiciness along with hints of citrus. The carbonation was soft, the mouthfeel very smooth and slightly oily, the body medium. For nearly 12% (!) the alcohol was well hidden and the experience complex and festive. One of the best of the style I have ever tried and worth aging."
"Pleasing sweet barleywine flavor."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. Brother Adams pours a deep, hazy chestnut with a rocky white head that leaves just a little bit of lacing. The aroma is sweet honey with just a bit of vanilla, and some definite notes of fusels as it warms. The flavor is big and boozy. There is a nice base sweetness that I'm guessing comes from all the honey that's used in its production. There are also notes of vanilla, dark fruits, and a bit of green apple. The one negative in the beer is that the 11.8% ABV really shows through. It's really boozy. The mouthfeel is a bit different then anything else I've had the pleasure of trying. It has an understated creaminess about it. Full bodied and creamy. This is a really good beer. I wish I had bought another bottle to let it sit for a couple more years and see what would happen to it."
"Somewhat of a tough beer to drink. Both sweet and sour at the same time, with a lot of alcohol in each sip. The bottle recommends sipping the beer, and so do I. Best served in a glass for sipping like a snifter. I'd say try it for yourself."
"Drinkability: a good representation of the style. One bomber bottle is enough for one session though. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are decent and unique, but can easily be overwhelming."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced and enjoyable. this is nicely mellowed out and meshed together and i'm enjoying it more than i do other braggots that i've tried. good stuff."
"This is my first braggot, and I just don't see it being a style I could get into. I'm not a huge barleywine fan either, but at least they are more interesting and typically hoppier than this. Still, I did find this starting to wear on me a bit - maybe because of the nearly 12% alcohol. It's still a slow sipper, but it's not too bad."
"M + D: Medium, but solid body... Minimal carbonation. Almost going so far as to say none. The alcohol is fairly well hidden... As it warms, the spiciness picks up. Nice stuff."
"Notes from 10/20/05"
"The aroma has honey with malt and yeast. The appearance is amber/red/brown with a thin head. The flavor is funky up front with a nice aftertaste. The palate is thin. Overall it's interesting but not great. This is a must try because the style is interesting but there are better things to drink out there."
"What this has taught me is that people back in olden times were pretty messed up. Maybe its perplexing, muted intensity would be better served by letting it age a bit. But whatever. I'm glad I tried it and I'd be willing to try it again."
"Drinkability: A good beer, and my first braggot - nice one to break in to the style with. Alcohol is prohibitively high enough that one of these is definitely enough, but it was a very enjoyable experience. Great balance of spices, malty tastes, and other fruity notes ... a very complex and interesting brew."
"I am not impressed, at all, but will keep my second bottle for a couple of years to see if I can get a little more. Right now, a forgettable experience, but I am glad I finally had a chance to taste a braggot."
"Drinkability is good. This is an interesting style. It seems to lack some of the traditional beer flavors that come from malts and hops. This seems more related to a mead than a beer. But it's a tasty beverage, that I am glad I got to try."
"The taste is quite flat, not overly syrupy, which is a good thing, and a combination of a very strong mead, a barley wine, and a spiced beer. This isn't the most enjoyable or drinkable beer on the rack. The high ABV is quite pronounced from the nose and throughout. The BA descriptor labels this as a medieval concoction, and I guess I can envision it on a cold damp night bedded down in a castle in the northern climes, this stuff would warm the cockles. It would also kill any residual bacteria in the water used to brew it, which was an important consideration then. To modern sensibilities, this is just a really strong, potent, honey barley wine that has a big palate and a throaty burn on the way down. The good news is that it is less cloyingly sweet, and less syrupy than most other barley wines. It is plenty sweet though."
"An interesting one to have as a sweet dessert. Pretty ""sippable"" for the high abv."
"I'm beginning to feel a bit better about Brother Adam's Bragget Honey Ale as the ounces slip by. Actually, that's probably the 11.8% ABV talking. Another few ounces and I'll be feeling charitably toward everyone and everything. Since this is the highest rated braggot on the site, I guess I'm just not a fan. Thanks Sudsdog."
"D: Drinkability was ok, a very thin palate and spicy alcohol fusels may hinder things a bit but it does get better deeper into the drink."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" of tan head, which practically vanished before my eyes. Dark amber shade to this brew. Aroma is sweet like most barleywines, but this one seems to be tempered a bit, probably due to the honey, with alcohol pervasive, as expected. Flavor is follows the nose, with a sweet taste upfront, followed by the alcohol, which seems to have the ride smoothed by the honey character. Nice effect. As a result, I think the mouthfeel is excellent, and the drinkability is enhanced by the interesting traits of this brew, making you come back again to make sure you enjoyed it from all angles."
"Brother Adam's Bragget Ale pours a dark, murky brown with a thin, tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. There is a sweet aroma, some fruit is noticeable. The flavor is kind of fruity and defininitely on the sweet side, there is kind of a slick mouthfeel in the finish. Alcohol is a bit noticeable. Hops aren't noticeable at all. Interesting, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
"Drinkability: Unique and fairly interesting. For some, a good night cap, for others it's a good with-pizza beverage."
"I really like this beer. I was hesitant to pick this up for a long time because I didn't know much about it. I'm glad I looked into it and grabbed a bottle since it was a worthy investment and a real treat. This is a sipping beer. If I had a fireplace and a comfortable chair I would be all set!"
"Drinkability: A very unusual brew that is an enjoyable sipper; kudos to the brewery for attempting the style"
"d: Thanks to barleywinebrewer for the chance to try this unique to me beverage. I'll look for more of this style in the future."
"Quite a tasty mix of ale/mead and one that leverages the strength of each without the negatives. Tasty and super smooth, send me some more!"
"Body is near medium, with a slick mouthfeel and very light carbonation. A decent brew but probably not worth the price."
"This beer is certainly a sipper as you can easily feel the alcohol taste in your mouth. It's a style that isn't done very often, but I'm glad that Atlantic does it right."
"I am a fan of braggot in particular (and mead). This cellared version, I do not have a year bottled, poured a medium yellow honey mixture with lots of foam and lacing. Malty and also barleywine aroma(when the head settles) aroma, creamy to the tongue though tingling it. Smooth drinking though nothing exceptional in taste, tastes akin a lager. Honey on palate in aftertaste."
"Poured into a chalice a clean/clear golden mahongy color, not much carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, which left some oil slicks behind. The nose is malty, spicy, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, some spicyness, and caramel. The alcohol is present in this one. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad BW at that, a little different take on one though, but pretty tasty, recommended."
"A creamy, slow sipping Bragget too mild in flavor to go back to, but by no means unpleasant."
"Having just recovered from a nice summer flu, I felt it was appropriate to cut through the residual haze with this. Tried this for the first time on a memorable ski trip many years ago while also drinking bombers of hand-labeled DFH 90 Minute."
" Overall this had to be one of the most interesting brews I have ever tried. Came off to me more of a spiced wine then a beer, but it was unique for sure. A bit hot and full of alcohol, but ot had a presence and a flavor that I had not expierence before, and I always appreciate that. Overall I would put this down as one you should definatly give a try to. It was original and worth a look."
"D: This beer is WAY HOT. They say it can age for years and I believe it. I would recommend all potential drinkers to store this one away for years to let it mellow. The alcohol flavors were way to rambunctious and need to chill the hell out. I hate to give this beer a bad review since I know with some years under its belt it could be something specialbut in its current state its not."
"Not a bad brew. I paid $8.99 for a 22oz and might be tempted to buy another. It doesn't make the taste buds scream, ""Wow", but it really is very nice."
"Brilliant flavor hits home with the obvious honey and a surprise of cinamon. Good carbonation. I'd like more of this in the future."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: I am not really sure what I expected with this beer. I thought it would be much sweeter and much more viscous. The beer has a medium body. The carbonation is slightly greater than low. This beer is a long term sipper. I enjoyed the beer over several hours. The beer was originally served cold but allowed to reach room temperature. I reccommend allowing the beer to approach room temperature for maximum sensory stimuli."
"That being said, its a great looking, sweet and unique tasting beer. I would certainly buy it again if the price came down quite significantly, but at this price there are a lot of other beers I would suggest in advance."
"While the initial mouthfeel is nothing extraordinary, its that soft entrance that makes the finish so luscious. I would definitely recommend this to anyone lucky enough to sample it, and this will not be the last one I have. It has a place in my cool/cold weather collection from now on. If you enjoy the wonderful aftertaste of a good barreled spirit as well as the tingle on the teeth I would definitely try to get some of this to sip and enjoy."
"Solid."
"I would like to let this sit for a few more years before I open the second bottle."
"Interesting, and drinkable- just not all the time. My first braggot, and this one is more complex and less sweet than I expected. I'm definitely ready to try another."
"This is my first ever taste of a Braggot, and considering the rarity of the style, who knows when Ill come across another. The label also calls it barley wine style ale, so at least it has some peers in that category. The look was clear, reddish amber, and lightly carbonated, which was pretty similar to most barleywines. The aroma was deeply fruity and very intoxicating. The presence of the honey was clearly apparent with each deep breath. The taste was quite sweet and winey and the first sip had me worried if I was going to like this. As I got used to the sweetness, the caramelized, spicy, and slightly sour underlying flavors revealed themselves. The hops were not always apparent as their wispy citric dryness was easy to miss. What surprised me was the rather modest level of alcohol burn. I was anticipating a big bruiser with the 11.5% posted ABV, but this was more of a gentle giant. The sweet flavor did however make this only suitable for sipping. A little thin on the palette, but that is understandable, since honey used was likely all eaten up, and proportional to volume the grain bill was rather small. Quite a satisfying drink, and Im going to have to cellar some to see how time can add maturity."
"Pours clear burnished oak with minimal carbonation and head, as you'd expect. The beer smells slightly smoky, full of sweet honey, raisins, and spiced cookie dough. Initial honey and raisin flavors give way to an almond-spiced dough center. The finish is big and rounded, full of stingingly strong spicy alcohol. Syrupy body with gentle carbonation. Becomes more viscous as it warms. Very nice accompanied with panettone (Italian Christmas bread) on a long cold winter night."
"Poured out a semi-clear reddish brown with a thin tight head that dissapeared after a minute or so. The nose was at first reminiscent of a garbage heap, there's alcohol and malt and some honey astringency, but it's hard getting past the fecal notes of rotting refuge. The taste is worlds more pleasent than the nose. There's malt and honey sweetness, some slightly rotting apple type bitterness, oh lordy, why do I sort of actually like this? I need to stop now."
"At $11.99 for a single bottle, I am glad that I have tried it to have sampled the style, but I do not think I will take them up on their suggestion to allow one to age and build in complexity. It would have to develop a LOT to make that worthwhile for me."
"Mouth is thin and weak, not sure I can finish the bomber."
"Bomber bought at Florian's in Auburn (the penultimate one!) Dark orange-red translucent body with just a film of offwhite head. Smells sweet and malty more than anything else. Tastes sweet and alcoholic. Not really noticing any hops here. Fairly pleasant. Surprisingly drinkable considering the abv. Rather thin bodied though."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades to a ring leaving traces of lace, honey nose, good carbonation and medium bodied, starts sweet and mellow, not cloying, the high ABV is not noticable, clean finish. Rerated October 2006 from a bottle I have had for more than a year. This is how beer should be - its perfect. $6.99 for this 22oz bottle from the brewery in Bar Harbor, Me. Worth going out of your way for."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, smooth, with an abv presence."
"This is my first bragget, but I already like the style. The beer pours a nice solid amber, perfect color for a barleywine. I smell sweet honey, as wells as some very slightly citusy hops and a lot of alcohol. The taste is sweet, as much malt flavor as there is honey. The bitterness is firm but subdued, the beer is nicely aged. The alcohol is definatly there, but not overpowering for a 12% beer. It's sweet, but not too sweet, definitely a sipping beer."
"Ugh... too easy to drink. I was really fearing this would be too sweet from the honey because I really do not like mead. But not everwhelmingly sweet with a a nice bitterness and alcohol heat bite to it all. Lots of spices too-particularly cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. The honey is very mellow and sweet but does not destroy the other flavors goin on in this beer. Some other candy flavors too. Medium mouthfeel that favors a bit toward light."
"This can be a hard to find beer. If you see it buy it and enjoy!"
"The label makes note of the amount of honey in the beer, and how it might be enjoyed with dessert. I couldn't agree more. It was an amber color with no head to speak of. It had a sweet, grassy odor. The taste was sweet honey with a little hops in there. Felt OK in the mouth, but definitely too sweet for me."
"This beer is very interesting but two-dimensional. I enjoy the flavor profile, but the depth of the complexity is shallow. Very much worth tasting, but not necessarily for quaffing."
"2004: This poured a clear, dark amber colour with some fine particles in suspension. It had a thin, off-white head with moderate retention and a smattering of lace. Fruity aroma with a hint of banana and an earthy honey smell. Mellow alcohol mixed well with aromas of green grapes and a bit of vanilla. Sweet honey with some vinous alcohol and grape flavour. Rich caramel with vanilla just creeping in towards the end. Plenty of warmth in the finish, but this is very controlled. The body was on the light side and it left the palate quite dry. I quite liked the mixture of characters and was pleasantly surprised by the fruitiness. It's time to try more braggots. Thanks Viggo!"
"Pours a nice rich clear orange/red, small white head forms, some spotty lacing. Smell is alcohol, bananas, rum, vanilla oak, and floral hops. Taste is alcohol up front, then honey, banana, caramel, rum, floral hops, and grape/vinous finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, the carbonation is very low, a nice alcohol burn/warmth all the way down. Nice sipper, pretty tasty."
"Drinkability and Notes  For a huge beer/mead this was very drinkable, the alcohol is the only real obstacle. The price is reasonable as well, $6.99 for this much honey and malt is not a bad deal at all. I wish there was some spice/herb/fruit added to this for another layer of complexity, but as it is this is a fine Braggot, but nothing that will make your head explode with delight. Glad I bought this a few months ago and saved this for a cool fall night."
"I drank this one from an oversized snifter. The color was a light copper-orange with almost no head to speak of at all. Slightly fizzy. The aroma had lots of spice, mixed in with some honey and vanilla. The taste really brought out the spiciness of it. It was slightly hot in my mouth, partially due to the high ABV. Reminded me of DFH's Immort Ale in a way, but not as intensely sweet and easier on the palate. This braggot coated the inside of my mouth and definitely has some spice. It really became more complex as it warmed up. Drinkability wasn't bad for the ABV, but this braggot is definitely a sipper. Something to share with a friend."
"What a wonderful delight this bragget. The deep copper color a few shade shy of brown, little head, nothing lasting with no lacing going down. Smells of orange honey, clover too, a mixture to be sure. The bees work and the yeast leave a high amount of alcohol, slowly fading lurking is the barley malt. Deep deep taste a full rush of complexity, you will need the whole bottle to understand it all fully. The alcohol right up front burns fast through to the honey melting on the tongue, finishes sweet of malt still some honey too. Slightly below room temp is best this bragget has a lot to offer. Pay the man what he wants, even dig deep into your coffer."
"Tastes of rich caramel malt. Vanilla and oak. Honey. Light alcohol flavor. Sweet. Earthy and bready. Spiced apple way back. Very barleywine-ish but with a bit of mead flavor mixed in. Mouth is velvet smooth. Elegantly masks the alcohol. A sipper but a real smooth one. Must get more to age..."
"Overall: Good brew, unique to me anyway. I do not have any experience with braggot or mead, but I certainly will be on the look out for more since I enjoyed this one."
"22 ounce bottle. Aged since 2004 on gold label. $5.99 price tag...thanks charlesw! (Note: charlesw said to age this one, I did not listen, next time I will heed his advice and allow the beer to age a bit more. I'll bet a 5 year old would be a force indeed!)"
"Stored away in my 52 degree basement for over a year now - this one pours a dark amber/burgundy with just a faint head. The aroma is of sweet alcohol and, if you knew, then you could smell the honey. The taste is wonderful. A perfect balance of honey and bitterness - a much better version of bragget than those that i've tried from other breweries. A 'right on' honey beer with a full body and nice aftertaste. I could sit and drink this one all evening...until i fall over in my chair from the high alcohol content."
"drinkable with alcohol, clove.. fig. heavily spiced with a light body and hot hot hot ABV. finishes cleaner than one would be used to with a barleywinish style beer. something i would go out of my way to seek out again."
"This is one unique and interesting brew. Vanilla and honey sweetness with an earthy, musty presence. Its easy to sense the alcohol warmth this beer has inside you. You can feel it...this beer was brewed to be sipped like a fine wine. This is perfect on a snowy February night like tonight. I like the complexity this beer has to offer. It's not for everyone, but I dig it. Considering this is an 11.8% ABV monster, the drinkability level is pretty darn good."
"Comments  This was a 2001 vintage (according to the cap) that I tasted in early 2005 over at skyhands house. What a treat."
"Brother Adam's Bragget Ale offers a slightly hazy robe of ruby-tinged chestnut beneath a short lid of creamy off-white foam that drops rather quickly to a thin collar and leaves only minimal lace (obviously due in great part to its high alcohol content). The nose, however, more than makes up for its shortcomings in appearance! It's rich and lively; loaded with honey, malt, fruit, and alcohol! And as it crosses the palate it's just as creamy as one might imagine - except for the mild sting of the alcohol involved. It's warming, and you can feel it passing through the throat and into the stomach. More honey is present in the flavor, and it's nicely entwined within doughy, vanilla and almond-laced cookie-dough-ish malt. Spicy alcohol accents, some fruitiness (sweet white raisins), and a very limited bitterness round things out. It's quite rich and enticing, yet its alcohol can be limiting."
"II served this in the tiny snifter sold at the Atlantic Brewing Company store. The brew didn't for much head, but had a lovely copper color. The aroma offered an interesting blend of wine notes, honey, and tea. The flavors were well balanced between honey sweetness, roasted malt, and tea-like hop bitterness. It was complex, but not exactly, what I was looking for. I did enjoy the full body, and found the brew to be quite drinkable - despite disagreeing with the hop selection."
"Drinkability - yes...but. This one is great for desert, not so much a dinner beer."
"Enjoyed in the company of friends, most impressive..big thanks to bennybrew, heck of a good one, here!"
"Thanks to UncleJimbo for this one, it was well worth the Yulesmith!!"
"The flavor is again very sweet, I get brown sugar and honey mixing with caramel and toffee. No hop presence that I can detect. As the beer warms the alcohol presence fades a little and the finish is much less warming. A very smooth brew that I would recommend drinking at cellar temp or room temp and not chilled as the experience improved as the temp went up."
"I'll second the label's suggestion as a dessert beverage, and add it makes a fine nightcap. Unusual, interesting, and enjoyable."
"Many thanks to the esteemed bennybrew for this fine elixir."
"Mouthfeel is thick, sticky and full with a just a hint of an alcoholic bite. Clean aftertaste and damn smooth. Is this really a barleywine? Really, 12% ABV? Dangerously drinkable, downed the whole bottle before I knew it. My thanks to kfoss99 for this sample."
"Thanks to purplehops for the bomber!"
"Served from a well presented 22oz bomber, crown wrapped in gold foil, this beer was a gift courtesy of Unionmade from his recent trip to Maine. Bottle also has a sticker stating ""aged since 2001"". The Bragget Ale pors out a hazy reddish amber with no visible head, just traces of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Carbonation is low but very tight, think ""tiny bubbles"" here. Chill haze disappears completely as the Bragget warms a bit. Aroma is very fruity and sweet, with a distinct whif of alcohol. Body is on the medium side for a barleywine, not too heavy at all. Taste is bold and spicy with alcohol at first taste, then blends to bright fruit and malty sweetness. Also has a nice vintage barleywine ""mustiness", tastes well aged. Finish is very sweet with a delicious hint of wild honey lingering behind. Goes down relatively easy for a big big beer. Excellently crafted..."
"Aged Since November 2000 (posted 3/20/04). The nose doesnt give notice to the BIG mouth feel and nicely alcoholic finnish. The color is that of cider but the honey that is added gives this barley wine a body that I havent experienced before. This is thick stuff. Not a bad thick either. The alcohol is a very nice note to have to balance the sweet. If I can find this again Ill buy it. Not a session beer but its tempting."
"Very different than the only other Braggot I have had, Magic Hat. MH was very champagne like and this is very Barley Wine like. Both good, but different."
"Too drinkable for such a big un. Be careful out there."
"Start of the flavor is strongly acidic followed by a brief intermission of the strain of the unknown before drinking in a large sense of caramel that follows through to a long earthy finish with a final closing sense of honey."
"As this most unusual of Ales sets in my glass, it presents a bemused copper color with a smallish head and the lace a nice fine sheet around the glass also the color a light tan. Nose is a bit sweet from the honey, hints of fusel alcohol, malt a plenty, a tad vinous, a gallimaufry of aromas to fascinate the olfactory senses, start is sweet, rich in malt and the top middling in its feel. Finish is idoneous in its acidity with a modicum of hops, the alcohol moliminous. A true belly warmer this hybrid whether it be Mead or Strong Old Ale or, ""Barley Wine"" I care not, I care that my good friend Bennybrew doth send it to me to be enjoyed with Gusto, and this task has been accomplished."
"F"
"Brought this back from my summer vacation to Bar Harbor, ME in June, where I also got a very nice tour of the Atlantic brewery. I decided to share it with some homebrewing friends last night. My particular serving came in a 22 oz. bottle that had been aged since November 2000. It poured smoothly and seemed slightly thicker than normal. There was no head and in fact the beer itself was very lightly carbonated. It had a delicious, sweet honey aroma - no hops aroma noticeable at all. The flavor was also sweet, with a very noticeable alchohol presence. The mouthfeel was thick and full, but no effervesence. A very drinkable beer, but I'm glad I had some friends to share it with. If I drank one of these 22 oz. bottles all by myself, you could stick a fork in me - I'd be done."
"I made two mistakes with this beer. First, seeing the bottle said to ""sip it", I saved it for the last beer of the evening. Second, since no ABV was listed, just November 2000, I drank the whole thing. Brother Adam must have been pie eyed a lot. It had a nice amber brownish color. The first sip should have warned me about the ABV, but I paid it no heed. I really enjoyed the honey taste. Not too sweet, just right. Before I knew it, ""Voila!", the bottle was gone. And so was I. That's right Venom, I finally got the Bragget."
"556"
"This brew has been aged since November of 2000, so I'm expecting something good. The label has a black and white photo of some knavish character, it actually gave me a chuckle. The beer itself has the look of cider, only slightly more reddish. This is accompanied by a syrupy honey smell. The unique honey aspect serves well. Enjoyably, the high alcohol content comes across smooth and not too overwhelming. What I love is the honey coating you can feel on your mouth minutes after the swallow. I certainly enjoyed this heartwarming mixture."
"This heavyweight ale pours with a deep amber-brown color and almost no head. The aroma is light and cidery with hints of alcohol. The initial sweetness and sugary malt flavor is paired with an apparent bitterness and a mellow smoothness to the body. The alcohol warmth gives the brew quite a kick. Nice brew for winter."
"Sampled from a 22 oz. bomber, small gold sticker says ""aged since November 2000"". Fairly dark brown brew with very little off white foam, the foam vanishes almost instantly. Very rich, sweet malt and honey stick out big in the aroma along with an alcohol smell. Smooth mouthfeel with rather low carbonation. The flavor mirrors the aroma with lots of sweetness from both malt and honey. A good bit of dark dried fruit flavor (prune and raisin) in this one also. The flavor character overall reminds me of a nice Tawny Port, I think this would go great with a chocolatey dessert or a good cigar. Nicely warming alcohol feeling as it goes down.This stuff is really good for slow sipping on a cold and rainy fall day like today."
"THe alcohol is very subtle for a barley wine.  This brew is smooth and has extra fermentables via the honey.  Cheers!"
