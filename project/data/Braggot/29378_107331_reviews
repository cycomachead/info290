"O: This was my first brag got which reminded me of a sweeter dessert barleywine. The notes of honey come through and work well with the dark dried fruits. The alcohol presence along with just a touch of hops keep this from becoming too sweet. Definitely worth trying."

"O: This drinks like a sweet barleywine but without the hops presence. Great depth and feel, though the balance leans towards malty sweetness."
