The smell is alcohol, dark fruit like raisins and plums and toasty. Taste is alcohol heat up front then roasty malt and dark fruits. Fig, plum, dark berries. Mouth feel was slick and medium. With decent to little carbonation. I ending up drinking the whole thing in one night but it was a slow process. It was better a little warmer than completely cold. It was my first and maybe only braggot for a long while I haven't seen many. Just this and Sam Adams honey queen.

3.85,1.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a purple  bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, muddled, amber-brown coloring with a thin, low profile, tan head. Aromas of rich honey, sweet berry, floral and herbal highlights, and rich caramel notes. Flavors are tangy and richly sweet forward, with a blast of berry sweet and tart on the forward tongue, a solid caramel and honey backbone, and a vegetal and herbal highlight. Full bodied and smooth, with a tangy sweet blend of marionberry and honey in the aftertaste. The beer has a slight edge from subtle carbonation which helps clean the finish a bit, but there is still a considerable linger on the smooth feel. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Mar 07, 2015"

4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big blackberry, cherry, red grape, raisin, plum, honey, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, honey, and fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of tart blackberry, red grape, raisin, plum, cherry, honey, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart blackberry, red grape, raisin, plum, cherry, honey, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, honey, and fruit flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly dry/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited braggot style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, honey, and fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 30, 2014"
4.19,10.3,,,,,,"To be fair, this was strong and having someone to finish this off with was probably for the better. When asked what a Braggot was, I had to reply to him that I had no idea but after reading more about the style and finishing this off, I'd have to say that anyone giving a go would be wise to start off here. There was a hint of floral notes to this too, ensuring that this was not too heavy, boozy, or spicy. This was really enjoyable and worth seeking out again, if for no other reason than because I haven't had anything quite like this before. A nice addition to Rogues eccentric lineup!","JerzDevl2000","Aug 28, 2014"

4.21,10.8,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"my girlfriend picked this one up because she liked the bottle (i admittedly like it too), and she loves fruit beers. havent had much braggot either, so i opened this up with much anticipation. it ours a dark purple to mahogany color, dense and hard to tell if its cloudy or just too think to let any light shine through. the head is pinky cream colored, and fizzles out rather quickly. an aroma of fresh pulped berries and sticky sweet meadow honey arises, with very little real alcohol heat or harshness, which surprises me at this strength. i taste the berries first in the flavor, and while i havnt had much experience with the marionberry, it reminds me of a cross between blueberry and blackberry and elderberry here. its deeply purple, skins tart like wine grapes and elderberries, but the fruit appears to be very sweet, and in combination with the honey, its gorgeous, almost medicinal in that i feel like its almost good for me, despite the alcohol. honey is fresh and floral and different from other honey beers because i can actually taste it. its sweet but never offensively so, and its actually pretty well carbonated despite looking flat. it drinks heavy though, especially as it warms, turning into almost english barleywine, bu the fruity character remains dominant. i liked this beer far more than i ever though i would, i have a new appreciation for both the fruit here and the braggot style, which i need to find more of and continue this trip. id like to see more rogue around shelves in colorado, everytime i have a new beer from them it surpasses my expectations. this is awesome stuff.","StonedTrippin","Jul 26, 2014"
