"Overall a good different tasting beer."
"[this beer is 2.25 parts mead to one part brown ale]"
"All-in-all, I get a lot of spice and fruit off of this beer. Not at all what I'm used to but not necessarily bad. I enjoyed this beer and can definitely envision drinking it on a hot summer day for a bit of refreshment."
"Drinkability is pretty good, an enjoyable, complex brew that definitely stands out from the crowd. As much as I enjoy the more robust characteristics, they can be deal-breakers I'm sure for some. Recommended to fans of Belgian style beers (ambers, Flanders Red save the pucker), which is what this is most reminiscent of to someone who's only had 2 or 3 other braggots. Bob was a big evangelist of mead's on the local homebrew scene, and this brew is a fitting tribute. Cheers Bob!"
"i drank immediately from the bottle. just because it was a vacation does not mean i'm not all business."
"D: Honestly, I quit halfway through the bottle and struggled to make it that far. As intriguing as this is, it's best served in small doses. I wouldn't rule it out, but it's not a beer that I must return to either. Certainly worth a try, just be sure to have some equally interested sipping partners to share with."
