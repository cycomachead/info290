"Very unique. Lots of ginger. Lots of honey. Unlike anything you'll try. This libation has a cult following, if you can get some, you shouldn't pass it up."

"Real flavors save it from a very bare bottom rate, but just way too much of everything. This is Cave Creek Chili, Dixie White Moose level dare stuff."
"(Insert kicking rad pipe organ solo here.)"
"Flavor is much more beer like. Honey lends a thinner body. The roll of flavors at the end is really impressive. Starts mild and finishes spicey/sweet/boozy/Piney/Citrusy. Leave a very wine like after-sip mouthfeel. Everyone else loves it, I think its kinda weird but interesting. To call this a braggot? Its a drink, enjoy."

"Looked like no head at all would appear then it gurgled up about 1/16"" of foam for about 15 seconds and disappeared. Looks like iced tea. There's a few bubbles but otherwise it tastes flat. Smell is remotely beer-like, more like cider actually. Taste I'd call a tainted apple cider, kind of an unsweetened apple with a hint of ginger. Frankly I question whether this even should count as beer. If you gave a non-beer-advocate an unlabelled glass of this I think they'd take a few sips and ask where'd you get the lame juice?"
"D: The spice here reminds me of a Ginger Pale tried a while back from WA's Trade/ Route/Laughing Buddha... but the exotic spice plays in a more interesting way here, muddled with apples and honey. Certainly a malty brew, and one to be reckoned with for its conniving booziness, but ultimately one I'm happy to have tried and would seek for a second taste."
"I really enjoyed Slippery Slope from The Peoples Pint, I've enjoyed all of their offerings i've tried now. Wouldnt drink more than one bottle a month though it's more of a special occasion thing."
"F: Dries off quite a bit, with the help of the fermented honey. Lingering spices and ginger just dominate the finish for a long time. Some spiciness and the booze makes my tongue feel like I just used mouthwash... for 5 minutes. A bitterness that comes from the ginger I think. Might be nice to have with sushi, but otherwise not my cup of tea."
"The 9+% ABV is quite well hidden. I split a bomber with a friend and so wasn't too wobbly afterwards. If you're attacking this beer solo, drink slowly even though you'll want to suck it back like soda. Otherwise you might be a little Weebly afterwards. I enjoyed it once but I probably won't seek it out again."
"The beer is a hybrid of sorts, according to the brewer who was pouring at the Menotomy Beer tasting in Arlington, MA this past Sunday. The beer has a definite honeyed sweetness, a slight vinous quality, lots of ginger, but it isn't over the top. The beer has a bit of apple cider and maybe a touch of barley wine. Combine these elements and you have the Slippery Slope Braggot. There is a slight spritzy flavor, maybe a touch of lemon in the body, but I'm convinced that the slight acerbicness of lemon is more the interplay of the honey and the ginger. The beer is fairly light on the tongue and has a very modest aftertaste. This is a change up type of beer and not one I would visit with any regularity."
"Consumed on 11/6/2009 with largadeer and dyan. Largadeer grew tired of small talk so he popped the cap and downed numerous gulps of this Braggot. When he removed the bottle from his mouth, foam shot out of his mouth, his nose, and the bottle. It's safe to say the beer was very carbonated. Masterful opening! It appears dark orange with a 2 finger head. The nose is ginger...ginger...ginger? It reminds me a bit of a ginger cider with nose of Granny Smith apples and a bit of honey. The flavor is sweet honey segueing into an aggressive blast of spicy ginger palate abuse. Eh...too much ginger...and way too much carbonation."
"Pours a clear golden-amber with a huge white head that dissipates pretty quickly. This was explosively carbonated, making it less than ideal to chug from the bottle. The aroma is a horrendously sweet blend of ginger, honey and pale malt. The taste, unsurprisingly, is also disgustingly sweet and cloying, spicy ginger backed by honey, apples and sweet malt. Did I mention that this is sweet? If not, yeah, this beer is unbelievably sweet. After a night of drinking dry, tannic gueuze, the sweetness of this was intolerable. I don't think I'll be rushing out to try more braggots after this."
"Decent body, low carbonation and a decent finish, this isn't particularly memorable. Drinkability? Forget about it, I could drink maybe a couple of oz, the rest went down the drain."
"The drinkability is fine considering I didn't much for the beer as a whole. It's a different braggot, but one that just didn't sit too well with me."
"A very interesting beer. I liked it for the most part, however, i feel like the ginger overwhelms the more subtle honey flavor. Not sure if i would buy again, but interesting nonetheless."
"22 oz. bottle with no freshness date; brewed with barley malt, honey, local cider and fresh ginger. The beer pours a clearish, dark honeyed hue, with medium carboation and a half-inch of whitish head that reduces to a thin collar and deposits a few wisps of lacing. Ginger is the first thing I smell, followed by hints of oranges, with malts and ethanol in the finish; the honey and cider don't particularly stand out, but the flavors have melded very nicely. Ginger also leads off on the palate, but there is also a cider and yeast presence, a light tanginess, and a big dose of warming alcohol atop a lightly tingly, medium body that feels a bit powdery and imparts a medium finish. The flavor is a little thinner than I'd like, and it would be better with some sugary sweetness, but it did become tastier and more drinkable as it warmed. Never had a braggot before, and I feel the cider overpowers the honey, but this is a very unique beverage that I am happy to have tried."
"Had on tap at the Pint on 1/30/09. Served in a pint glass. Appearance was a translucent honey color with no head. Nose was apples and herbal. Flavors consisted of cinnamon, nutmeg, chamomile and a light tart apple quality. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and subtly carbonated. Easy drinking, with a well-hidden abv. This is only my second braggot and I was blown away (the first was less than appealing). Despite the abv, this would make a great summer offering in my opinion."
"Other reviews say this is well carbonated, but I see NONE. Meduim mouthfeel and alcohol/hard cider lelemnts make this moderately easy to drink. Overall, a unique style and worth a try. As a former local, I know the Greenfiled water can be less than clean, and still these guys can put together really decent brews. Cheers."
"D- This one kicked my ass. Kept taking sip after sip without even thinking. What a treat. I should have picked up some more."
"Overall, a very interesting brew. It is absolutely worth trying, but it definitely won't appeal to everyone."
"Poured out with no head, a bit foggy apple cider-ish color in appearance. The smell is pretty fruity: apples and grapes mostly. Definitely some spice and malt too. Thin flavors allow it to be wicked sweet. Extra tastes include a touch of honey, citrus and definitely cider. The mouthfeel is weak but this is toward its benefit; definitely very smooth. I feel many might not be sure about this drink, but I must say, this was pretty darn good."
"Although I rated this beer with the Braggot style in mind I did not like it at all. Of course I don't like a hot toddy either. But my girlfriend who loves them also hated this brew. With that in mind I wanted to convey this to everyone, this is a good beer based on the style but obviously I won't be buying this again."
"The sourness is prevalent in the mouthfeel, but it leaves a sort of dry coat in the back of the mouth. It has a smooth follow through, making it one of the easier 9.8% ABVs to take down."
"Pours a murky rustic brown with a half finger off-white head that quickly dies down to a ring of fluffy bubbles around the entire glass. Some thin lacing left behind from swirling the glass, but not much. Smell, now this is where it gets interesting. Sweet sweet honey, toasted cinnamon, apple cider, white grapes, ginger, and spice. Although I have nothing to compare this to, I still really enjoy the nose on this one. Taste is more honey and spice up front with a warm apple crisp sweetness. A faint yeast flavor on the tongue with more ginger and some clove. Aftertaste is a bit grassy with cinnamon bark as well. Mouthfeel is pretty wet at first but dries out towards the end. Medium body with a full carbonation. I really wouldn't expect the 9.8% abv if I didn't know beforehand, it's hidden quite well. What an interesting style. I could definitely see myself having a beer like this on a special occasions or during the fall/winter holidays. Thanks Tom for the opportunity to try this unique brew. I hope you and your wife enjoy the Flower Power :)"
"M&D - the addition of the cider lends a certain smoothness to a sharp beer, that is easy to drink and with a highish ABV is definitely a Slippery Slope, the only detractor is there is a bit too much ginger, but still very impressive. a great first impression for this style for me"
"Dangerously drinkable, especially if you like ginger. Peoples Pint knows what winter is all about. This one gets a ""Hell Yeah!"""
"Poured cloudy honey-orange colored with some light foamy head. Nose is spicy and you can tell it's tangy as well. Taste is like apple cider without the appliness, but the slight sweetness, definitive tang, and some ginger dominate. But, I would have expected some stronger flavors. If you're expecting a different style you will be sorely disappointed (but, I suppose, that is true about any beer). Interesting braggot, just not my style."
"Almost pours a one finger white head that goes quickly to a ring leaving a little lace. Low carbonation and medium bodied. Almost clear amber color. Nose is apple cider. Flavor is honey and cider, very smooth, high ABV is hidden, hops in the background. Nice beer but not the usual braggot - not enough body and not as sweet. $6.30 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA. Label has ABV at 9.8%."
"D/Notes: Unique. Not something I would want to drink regularly but a nice change of pace. No doubt good on a crisp fall day. Alcohol masked very well."
"995"
"If you enjoy cysers or other mead-like beverages, this is a great entry. For something truly different in the beer world, this is an awesome treat. I could not drink this regularly, but its wonderful as a change of pace."
"from bjohnson for my bombing"
"Very refreshing flavors right from the start. Apple cider notes give the beer a subtle but excellent sweetness. Apple peel adds to the body of the cider notes. Leafy mint flavors on the tongue give create a fresh flavor that cleanses the palate. Cider notes are revived in the aftertaste leaving a starchiness on the palate with an apple peel dryness. Honey flavors are present but are definitely undertones and play a nice supporting role to the rest of the notes. Toasted grain notes also play a secondary role and are apparent in the aftertaste. A pretty light bodied braggot that doesn't sport a huge mouthfeel thickness. Very nice and extremely drinkable braggot with a higher abv that goes completely unnoticed. Get this if you can--it's almost too drinkable."
"Wow. We have had a bottle of Slippery Slope in the fridge for a while now, just waiting for a good time to appreciate it, and it was worth the wait! It pours a very interesting color--it is almost rose-colored, and it smells amazing. It actually smells like a ginger-apple crisp that I made last Thanksgiving--sweet, but with a little kick of gingery-spice. The taste is really interesting--it's sweet, but it has enough of a kick to offer some balance. It also has a bit of an alcohol-y aftertaste. It has a really unique taste--it's not like the other braggots I have tried. I would say that it's drinkable--I look forward to having more!"
"Drinkability: this was a bit too sweet for my liking. Interesting flavor components keeps it intreaging for a while. Definitely worth giving this a try since it is a unique style."
"cloudy reddish hazy pour with orange highlights. no head, no lace. pure murk. boozy port nose infused with ginger, body odor and rummy fruitcake. strangely reminiscent of margaritas in the nose. taste surpasses these obstacles and presents a buttery, vanilla bomb. sweet cream ice cream with bourbon sauce topped with the best honey available to man. great dessert flavor finishing tart in a supremely lactic fashion. crazy and wonderful. a good sipper, but very drinkable due to the lack of alcohol sting or thick body. a bizarre concoction for sure, and one with way too many directions, but enjoyable nonetheless. the best thing i've had from the people's pint for sure."
"Mouthfeel is very full and broad. Kind of sticky actually--almost as if the honey is trying to coalesce into its usual form. Really sticks around the inside of the mouth. A nice slow drinking beer. Not sure I could go through this one fast if I really, really tried it is so rich."
"Taste develops and blossoms at it warms towards room temp, tart at first and building to a spicy malt mélange. Sweet honey is present in the finish, as well as a full, tantalizing brandy character. Lots of fruity complexity flows throughout, along with alcoholic warmth to bring you to a land of plum, raisin, bruised apple, and late harvest grapes. Very well constructed and creative braggot from the Peoples Pint."
"Truly an interesting offering, and one that I wish I had picked up more of when I was out in Greenfield with fellow BAs Warriorsoul, PaulB, fdrich29, bocktech, and eveninghawk."
"This brew pours a nice coppery amber color with a faint white head leaving no lace. Smells were intially very sweet with a nice honey aroma, followed by some tart apples, a little spice, and an almost medicinal clove like aroma. Initial flavors were almost mead like with a sweet and spicy tone which was mainly from the honey. Following a bit of malt flavor sneaks its way into the picture but is quickly overrun by yet more spice, and a fruity zest like flavor. The finish to this brew is a little herbal with just a sweet honey finish. The mouthfeel was rich and full of flavor, while the brew had a nice medium body. Carbonation was light and faint. Overall this was a decent Braggot, but a bit undrinkable IMHO just because it was a bit sweet and overwhelming at points. Definetly worth a try though."
"<edit> I have upgraded my inital rating a bit, as the brew warms toward room temp, the honey flavor and smoothness becomes more and more apparent. Since this why I dinged it a bit in a couple of categories, I felt the need for an adjustment."
