3.25,0,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color mead with a fizzy white head. Aroma of sweet honey notes with loads of peach notes is not as bad I was expecting. Taste is actually quite enjoyable with some good notes of peach with some honey notes and residual sugars. There is some unrefined notes but subtle enough to not mess with this mead.","Phyl21ca","Oct 28, 2014"
