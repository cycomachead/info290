"Taste is the same as the nose, honey and malt and jamminess work wonderfully here. There's a touch of hops, but I'm not picking up on much spice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to thin, which works with this beer. Carbonation is moderate. Overall, a winter delight. A good change of pace from barleywines and stouts as for winter brews, almost a session beer, but a touch too alcoholic, bottle says 7%. That said if I didn't know or care I'd knock back a couple two-three in a row on a winter night."
"Overall, very interesting and deep. Tasty, with the mouthfeel being the highlight. This has improved so much over time. I canÂ’t wait to try another bottle next year!"
"Too sweet for me to be easily drinkable. Got better as the glass emptied. I'm not well versed in Mead, but if that's what they were going for, I don't think they failed. Just not my style."
"A bottle at a party, this is my first reviewed Mead -- though Dogfish Midas Touch seemed close at the time. Clove color, decent head of 1/2 of an inch and lots of dotty laces over sheets of clinging liquid. Sweet potato pie aroma, prickly cinnamon, mace, and requisite honey. Plenty of body, I'll expand after more experience with Braggots. Lots of a unidimensional sweetness, good spice, but more like a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios than the more changing profile of a beer. Not bad, not an easy drinker for me. I've been schooled on Mead making, but the same guy could only tell me to say whether or not I liked it when evaluating it..."
"The beer pours a limpid brown color; the head impressive in size, the texture frothy and the lace produce is sticky sheets that cling tightly to the glass. Honey sweet nose, malt and a bit spicy, quite a change of pace. Thickly sweet at the front, the top middling in feel with a finish that is minimally carbonated, just a touch of tartness in the aftertaste also dry. Different to be sure as I said a change of pace, but not something I would want everyday, good in its own right nonetheless."
