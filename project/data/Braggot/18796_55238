3,0,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a dark yellow color liquid with no carbonation. Aroma of sweet grain with alcohol notes very discernible. Taste is heavier on alcohol then I would have expected with some grain notes and loads of honey notes. Body is full with no carbonation. Different and an interesting experience though too much alcohol is discernible. Not something I would have regularly though interesting to taste.","Phyl21ca","Dec 18, 2010"

3.29,0,,,,,,"Bottle from the brewery,served in a small Acero glass. Honeyish colour, no head,no carbonation. Attractive honey aromas, it smells like a braggot. Both honey and licorice are very sweet, and expected it to be more sweet than it was. There was the element of licorice spice. Not very drinkable, but I agree it goes with food, crackers helped. Odd bitterness, not tremendous for the style.","Sammy","Beers"
4.32,0,,,,,,"Overall: I have no personal reference for this style as i've never had it before but i thoroughly enjoyed this beer. A bit like Utopias in the sense that this is not your traditional beer. The cost though (22$) will prevent me from buying this on a regular basis but for special occasions, it fits the bill.","papat444","0"
