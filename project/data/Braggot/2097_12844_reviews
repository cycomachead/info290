"Maybe it's what this style is supposed to be, I don't know, but this was too heavy and syrupy for me."

"Kuhnhenn's Braggot is a nice blend of malty ale and mead. A sweet, enjoyable departure from my typical routine and well worth a try for anyone that may be curious."
"O-  I haven't had many other braggots to compare this to, but while I wasn't blown away I thought this was pretty solid.  Has a nice malty sweetness to it and you can detect the booze but it drinks a lot easier then you would expect it to."

"   This Braggot is exceptional IMHO, as brewmaster Todd Schwem found the perfect balance with this beer / mead .   I am NOT a fan of honey flavored meads or honey in general, so this Braggot  surprised me.   I call it lightly sweet with a nice effervescence, and an earthy undertone(must be the beer portion) and a fresh baked shortbread- like character....  Gosh, just a nice quaff ! Very impressed with this."

"The history of Braggot dates back centuries in northern Europe. Braggots are meads made with malted barley in addition to the honey. Our Braggot won a Bronze medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival. Brewed with wildflower honey and rich, dark specialty malts, the final product is akin to a Scottish Ale, with an added earthy depth and sweetness. Vinous notes combine with earthy flavors and a touch of toffee and biscuit character with just a hint of alcohol warmth. This is a complex sipper sure to warm even the coldest nights."

"Had higher expectations for this... I'd say better than OK, but not great."

"Overall, this beer is wildly rich and decadent. The nose alone could cause diabetes. With warmth, the booze does come out in droves to meet the horrible sweetness, giving a semblance of a balance to the tasting. As far as a braggot goes, this tastes more mead than beer, with a strong showing of the raisins, figs, and fruity undertones held within, rather than with much depth of grain or bitterness of hops. This beer is one quick step away from being an amazing barrel aged beer, as it has enough intrinsic diacetyls and buttery warmth to carry it. That might make it more approachable and acceptable by many professional whale hunters, but alternatively could push it even further into uncharted, extreme territories."

"O - It's a sipper. It is better at room temperature. It just reminds me a lot of an English barleywine. It has warming effects. I like it."

"Flopjack out, tight lines"
"overall: Haven't had much of this style, but this was very drinkable and refreshing. I wonder what the 2 years of age did to this, as the alcohol was very subdued and overall this was a lot more balanced and sweet than I expected. Will buy again if I see it."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, but I would not buy it again for the price tag. If you like Braggots, you should really pick this up just to try it once."

"The mouth feel is pretty dense and heavy, though the braggot is carbonated pretty well. Slightly sticky, wet, and oily with a warm and sharp finish. The aftertaste is full of booze, light citrus, yeast, and malty sweetness. Overall, I enjoyed the brew quite a bit. Though it may be too heavy to drink regularly, the drastically high alcohol content was fairly tame. It was interesting to pick out the traditional flavors of Kuhnhenn's Citrus mead here. I wonder what beer was mixed in with this batch?"

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass; Winter Solstice 2011 bottling. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a small foamy light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing as expected. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, molasses, toffee, chocolate, raisin, prune, honey, biscuit, tobacco, light nuttiness, floral, and dark earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and honey notes; with hardly any alcohol presence. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, honey, raisin, prune, biscuit, tobacco, leather, light nuttiness, floral, herbal, and dark earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, dark fruit, molasses, honey, biscuit, tobacco, leather, and dark earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt flavors with honey; with hardly any cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 16%, with only a slight warming noticed after the finish; definitely a slow sipper though. Overall this is a fantastic Braggot style! Incredible complexity and balance of malt/honey flavors; and insanely smooth to sip on for being 16%. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O – This is my first braggot, but it seems to fit the description of the style very well. It was definitely a tasty and unique experience and was very drinkable given the high ABV. It seems like they’re pretty tough to come by, but I’d like to try some more examples of this style."
""
""
"Overall - The style doesn't lend itself to much complexity in my experience. The honey flavors mask most of the dimensions of the beer. Amazingly smooth though."
"Well this is my first Braggot and it won't be my last (assuming I can actually find someone else who makes on, that I can get in my neck of the woods)"
""
"O: Definitely one of the better American braggots I've had. The honey aroma and flavor is deep and satisfying and the alcohol is incredibly well-hidden."
""
"O: Color me impressed. I will be seeking out more Braggot's in the future."
""
"Overall interesting, unique, a big beer with lots of dark fruits, malts, syrupy candy flavors, and plenty of additions from the booze itself. However, the mead portion seems to be drowned out a bit too much, but still tasty and good."

"Though I'm very new to the style, I enjoyed this very much."

"O: another one of those (for me at least, never having had mead or a braggot before) really unique beers. I thoroughly enjoyed the drinking of it - it was so innocuous and easy-drinking, but at the same time, I probably would go with a barleywine just as easily. Don't get me wrong, though, if you are a true beer advocate, it is worth the buy."
"Cheers!"
"It is sweet but not cloyingly so. Overall a very tasty beer but maybe not exactly what I was expecting. Kuhnenns always pleases in some fashion."

"From the 2011 Winter Solstice. Bottle poured into a snifter. According to the bottle, this checks in at a whopping 16% ABV. It is a deep dark brownish color, slightly translucent with little to no carbonation. Smell is extremely sweet and alcoholic, with a lot of brown sugar and molasses-type aromas. Taste is very sweet with an interesting mix of woody off-flavors. While alcohol is definitely present, it is hidden pretty well for 16% ABV. There is very little carbonation here. This is probably my first braggot, but despite not having anything to compare to this is an enjoyable heavy beer."
"O: a nice sipping beer and at 16% thats all id recommend you do with it, very unique and complex on the palate, extremely deep and really lingers on the palate for a long time"
"kuhnhenn continues to impress with their huge beers that carry a nice flavor and are beyond drinkable with hidden booze."
""
"Careful though: you can barely taste the 16% ABV, even at room temperature. Literally *zero* bite and only very mild alcoholic warmth as it descends. I enjoyed this one, but at $12 for a 12oz it's only for special occasions."

"Shared by Floydster at The Bruery Reserve Society party. I believe this is the March 2008 vintage. It's dark amber with a diminutive head of bubbles. The nose is earthy, with notes of sour fruit candy, raisins, heather, and honey. The flavor is earthy and slightly sour, with notes of heather, honey, and a dash of chocolate. This was cloying and I didn't finish my small sample."
"Wow - a Winter Solstice '08 beer that isn't infected - I should go buy a lottery ticket."
"I was definitely expecting a bit more body with this one and the sourness was slightly offputting, though it wasn't enough to ruin the beer for me."
"D: It's unseasonably cool right now but this is definitely a winter brew. ABV is big time but would make a nice warming sipper during the cold winter."
"Bottle courtesy of kkulacki. Pours a dark brown mud color with hints of red and with good clarity. Thin layer / ring of light brown bubbles. Laces wetly and slowly. Aroma is very sweet and figgy, with lots of strong honey reduction and a bit of alcohol. Flavor is intense, as i have come to expect from Kuhnhenn. Big, tangy bitterness, with lots of oaky tannins. Honey is sweet, almost overwhelming, but the high alcohol and malty base manage to reign it in. Full bodied, definitely approaching syrupy. This is definitely a sipper. Hooh-ah, Kuhnhenn makes some big ass beers!"
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost brown away from the light, thin tan head forms, settles to a nice collar around the glass, some lacing sticks, looks pretty nice. Smell is neat, very floral, caramel, fruit, raisins, alcohol, light ammonia which I noticed with the braggot I made, biscuits, lots of malt, neat honey character. Taste is neat, although the flavour it a bit thin and hot, some floral honey character, fruity, alcohol is in your face, some caramel, apples, some spice, ammonia again, pretty interesting although can't say its very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light bodied, pretty thin, with low to medium carbonation, some big heat going down. Way too thin, light sourness, lots of heat, not as rich and full bodied as I think a braggot should be."
"style I have ever had. Top notch and I would go for it again."
"Got this one at the Kuhnhenn Solstice Party 08. Clear, deep chestnut with ruby highlights and a thin layer of fine, beige bubbles. There was a thin collar too, which provided some spotty lacing. Caramel and floral honey in the aroma, along with unrefined sugar, mild dark and toasted grains, and a hint of higher alcohols. Low bitterness, plenty of sugary sweetness. Some caramel and quite a lot of honey flavour, a bit of fruit character as well, plum and cherry. Mild alcohol flavour with moderate warmth. Very fine carbonation, a bit on the low side, with medium body, quite smooth. Quite tasty and very drinkable, a nice change of pace when you're looking for something out of the ordinary."
"Braggot's a good beer. Kuhnhenn did a nice job with this interesting style. This is my first go with a Braggot and I'm pretty impressed. As I alluded to earlier, it's very artful and classy. I feel important as I'm drinking. Dammit, a beer that makes you feel important is a good beer. Thanks, Derek. Very thoughtful selection."
"D- The alcohol will definitely sneak up on you with this one. A easy to drink sipper. Interesting and unique."
"Poured a medium amber color with a small sized head. Aromas of, well guess what, honey with some caramel. Tastes of honey, caramel, and some breadiness. Light alcohol in the finish. Braggots are another style I don't really seek out, but this one was drinkable and not bad."
"Very nice refreshing semi-dry mead. The malt does very well at helping any cloying sweetness that may have been there. Alcohol burns slightly in the chest. Floral, earthy finish again full of alcohol. Once past the initial alcohol burn the spritzy carbonation really helps drinkability. Nice sipper after a long weekend of liver infection."
"braggot is very drinkable and went well cars water cracker and brie."
"A sparkling mead with geuzelike sourness. My first braggot, it was crisp, carbonated (wohlfs who brought it to Doug Shoemaker explained the carbonation is from the malt) and different. Dry aftertaste. Refreshing and will have again. Surprising the alcohol was so high, ya don't notice."
"Golden brown, something of the copperish color of a lightly toasted marshmellow. Nothing too significant in the way of carbonation. A very strong, sweet honey aroma drifted from the bottle right away. Very potent. Big, big flavor dominated by alcohol and honey sweetness in the truest sense. A beefier middle that ressembles beer a little more, probably where the barley in the product shows itself a bit. Alcohol in the finish, especially as it warms a bit. It gets a bit harsh when it's really warm. But otherwise, it was pretty good. I'm not sure of the abv, but if it's below 7-8abv, I'd be outright shocked."
