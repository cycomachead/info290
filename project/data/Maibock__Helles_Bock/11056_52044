3.69,-0.3,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a cork and cage into a weisse vase, the beer is a bright, vibrant maize gold coloring with a ton of carbonation throughout the body. A ton of carbonation, in a furious flow up the glass, constantly feeding a bubbly, white head that doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of toasted grains, subtle hints of honey and caramel, floral highlights, and a subtle hops bitterness. Flavors are tangy sweet forward, almost sugary to start, with a rich honey and extremely bitter vegetal/grassy blend, which lays on top of a bready and heavy backbone. You get layers more along the Belgian line, with heavy banana and a blend of clove and nutmeg spicing. This is a big beer, despite the lower ABV and abundance of carbonation. The aftertaste is more of the richly sweet and heavy fruit and bread notes, leading into a smooth, crisp, clean finish. This is a tasty beer. Give the carbonation time to settle out and you will see the drinkability increase greatly, as well as the layers of flavor develop for you.","GarthDanielson","Jan 30, 2015"

A great example of how good a lager beer can be. It kinda reconciled me with the style. I wish i would see more local craft brewers do good lagers like this. This is a perfect intro beer for people new to craft beer and will please beer connoisseur aswell. I will buy again.

One word: gorgeous! From the head to the aroma, from the color to the taste, a beautiful beer; three fingers of vibrant white mousse; grainy aroma with hop highlights; medium-plus mouthfeel reveals full-bodied flavor;terrific finish leaves me wanting more; even the bottle is a beauty; this one's worth the 300-mile drive alone.","matthiasbrau","Jun 05, 2013"

3.96,7,4,3.5,4,4.25,4.25,"As is typical for the style, Les Trois Mousquetaires Maibock is a beer that leaves out all details save for the most practical. While it offers only the bare essentials, these are not only among the finest quality but also apportioned very generously. It's a good thing this brewer has a penchant for German styles because his beers epitomize those traditions masterfully.","biegaman","May 08, 2013"

3.94,6.5,3,4,4,4,4,"Hazy pale yellow body. Large eggshell head, moderate retention, patchy lace. Looks like a weissbier with less foam. Floral and yeasty bread dough aroma, like an amped up pilsner or helles, with a hint of honey. Mildly sweet with doughy and cereal flavours up front, and lemon zest, then a spicy/herbal finish. Moderate bitterness. It drinks like a stronger, more flavourful helles, or even pilsner on the lower side of bitterness. Medium bodied with relatively low carbonation. Rich, substantial mouthfeel, but not heavy or thick. No alcohol heat. Full-flavoured but approachable and very familiar.","mintjellie","Mar 24, 2013"

The taste is overly sweet with some honey and earthiness, and very alcoholic. Some light bitterness and lots of alcohol in the aftertaste. I wasn't a fan of this, and was barely able to finish one glass. The harsh alcohol in this ruins it.
