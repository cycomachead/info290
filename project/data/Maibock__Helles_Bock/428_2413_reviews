"500ml bottle courtesy of Thirtybird, served in a willibecker. 21.04.14 indicated on the back label. Pours a bright, orange-gold with a loose, three-finger, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a frothy,quarter inch cap. Textured, concentric half-circles of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Clarity is translucent and copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing from the base of glass to the underside of the cap. Nose is comprised of a grassy character, pilsener malts and a touch of skunk. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light fruity character followed by a touch of noble hops. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation. Overall, an easy drinking Helles Bock made the better consumed fresh!"
"Better than average and worth finding: dirt cheap in Germany too."
"500 ml bottle, my bottle says 6.0% ABV. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy golden orange color with about a half inch off-white head. The brew smells like bready malt, apples, bananas and some light hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some clove and a bit of citrus and grassy hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate carbonation and is easy enough to drink. I think it's an OK beer, but nothing stands out about it. Worth a try once, but I don't see myself buying it again anytime soon. $4.99 a bottle."

"O - Glad to have tried this and it is a solid example of the style."

"Beer is medium-bodied on the palate, with fairly minimal carbonation, just enough to make this foam up slightly on the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is very smooth. Slight spiciness from ethanol on the back of the throat, providing subtle warming. Could be a bit more carbonated, but it's also fine the way it is. Finish is dry, with a slight stickiness from residual sugars."
"Slainte."

"This is a crisp, drinkable German beer with a bit of a cheesy smell and mouthfeel. In general, its more interesting than the Augustiner-Bräu Heller Bock."
"D-excellent drinkability for a Bock"
"Pours a cloudy, maize color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. There is also suspended sediment evident. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of tart malt, acid, slight citrus (banana), slight sweet malt, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight pale hop, slight citrus, slight sweet malt, and yeast. Overall, the mouth feel is too sharp and the acidity in the aroma is off-putting. Otherwise it is an average Maibock at best."
"Overall, very drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"A decent beer, didn't blow me away. Was expecting a little more bready malt and thicker mouthfeel for a Maibock."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Above average in both areas."
"I got this bottle in November, but the ""Maibock"" label is more apt without a doubt -- and maybe this beer could pass for an Oktoberfest as well."
"D: This isn't what I expected from a maibock, but it was definitely a drinkable, easy to like beer."
"Assuming that the number printed on the label is either the bottled date or the freshness date, it becomes rather obvious why this beer was so flat and full of nasty sediment in the bottle. Bocks aren't made to last three years, and it shows. I have a feeling that, had this beer been enjoyed fresher, it would have fared rather well."
"A slightly cloudy yellow/gold body. The aroma is light malt, not much else to it. The flavor is complex and surprising for a bock. Sweet upront with some clove spice notes, but the bitter, hoppy finish is what impressed me most. An enjoyable bock that is easy drinking, not too sweet and has some solid bitterness to it. I love that a German craft brewer has made it to Colorado, but I would drink more only if the price was cut in half."
"Zum wohl!"
"Followed up the Weisse Bock with this one-- it's got a lot to live up to. Pour makes me think more of Blonde Dopplebocks or Maibocks. A deeply straw color with light legging, but also light on head formation and retention. Quite sweet and heavy looking. Aromas of straight Pilsner malt, with some fresh bread / yeast notes, light pears, apples, and mild alcoholic spice. Flavors deliver the same making for a very simple beer, but void on any decoction caramelization or melanoidins. Simple and pleasant on the surface, but ultimately lacking depth. Mouthfeel is heavy and sweet, with a hint of herbal hops in the background. Finishes with sweet pilsner malt and a hint of alcohol warming. Nice, pleasant, but doesn't provoke conversation."
"Went down easily and was pretty refreshing, albeit kind of sweet..."
"Drinkability- Not my favorite Mahrs beer."
"I generally agree with most of the previous reviews. This brew is very understated, which may turn some people off. I wasn't aware it was a maibock when I bought it, and was expecting a much thicker, darker beer. All in all though, it's a pleasant drink if you give it a chance. A good and easy introduction to this style if you're used to drinking American crap lagers."
"My bottle has a slightly different label with a goat head on it. Label is stamped 1205. Pours a hazy straw gold color with a negligible head. Slightly grassy, sweet, almost but not quite pungent aroma. Taste is rather one dimensional with a rather sweet, bready aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very flat, with an aftertaste that is borderline unacceptable. Overall a quite average beer."
"Golden color with a finger of white head that leaves fairly weak lacing. A good amount of yeast floating around the glass. Nose of lots of caramel malt, and some lemon and orange citrus. Taste is likewise. Lots of spices, tons of caramel malt. Lots of tasty fruit, citrus, dried fruit (raisins specifically). Full, creamy body with good carbonation. I liked this one - nice flavor with a great body. Good beer at a good price."
"D/Notes: My sense is that this is a pretty well constructed bock. I'm not a big fan of the style - and I generally do not find them particularly drinkable."
"Pours out chill hazed marmalade. Has a good sized head that clings to the sides well. There are some chunks in this, which is a put-off. Nice lacing rings. Smells typical of a maibock in the area of the almost worty malts. I get a lot of grape nuts from this. Honey and challah as well. There's a lot of that maltiness up front that's pushed out by a strong medicinal character and somewhat rough hop bitterness. Herbal and grassy hop flavors accompany the finish. Mouthfeel is fulsome with some carbonation that goes over the line in its force. This is all-around decent, but I don't see myself buying it again. There were some really great things about this beer that got balanced by some really awful ones, making this so-so."
"M&D - rather smooth, the sweetness and complex maltiness lends a nice smoothness, warming and full bodied, an all around stellar bock"
"Gold in color. Quite hazy. Bubbly off white head. Sparse lace. Aroma is grainy and sweet. Similar to all others of theirs. The palate brings me sensations of dusty malts, cereal grains and sweet malts. Not too bad. But not that great either. It's pretty sweet, but not quite in the annoying cloying realm. Body is medium-full and the carbonation is on the low side. Gives it a bit of a syrupy feel to it in the mouth. Very average maibock overall here."
"this is completely unlike what i thought i was getting into with this beer. completely unique."
"Drinkability: the fruity sweetness grew a bit boring after a while. Not a maibock that will want you to buy a bunch of these."
"Taste is little sweet and bitter, which is a bit sharp. The beer is very malty and must have a big amount of light caramalts in there, which make the body medium, lower the drinkability and give the beer it's vanilla and some honey taste. The hops are almost overpowered by the fullness of the body."
"The beer initially came across farely weak but would grow as it went on. Quite sharp and with a full citruisy flavour on every swig. A cloudy bright orange colour, not much nose. The beer is a decent offering and easily agreeable, but far from anything great. I found it too meek for a bock, it was simply a little sloppy in the features where a good bock should stick out, and as result, came out as nothing more than a strong German style lager."
"Pretty nice example of the style, a refreshing but strong lighter beer. Not overly challenging to the palate but better than an average lager. I would recommend it for fans of malty-style beers."
"Mouthfeel is medium, not quite a ""rich"" taste, but full in the mouth. A little flat after the initial pass over the palate. On a hot day, a couple of these would hit the spot."
"Overall: The Fourth of Six Mahrs Brau beers that each cost me $3.99 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. This one had too many faults to impress, and resulted in a brew that felt very average overall. Perhaps a fresher sample may have helped but even so I found this one just had too many holes in it and was wanting in too many areas."
"Initial head. A nice bitterness, easy drinking. Drying and bit sour aftertaste. Clove spice detracted. Complex malting and malty and bit of toast and nuts aroma. A rare one picked up at Cloverleaf. present carbonation. Best accompanied by food.Six months' old."
"1 pint .9 oz bottle. Mahr's Bock Beer pours out a slightly hazy, dark yellow color. It's quite pale for a bock. The aroma is herb tea and caramel. Big malty flavor. Tastes like bread and caramel. A lemony, tangy, herbal flavor comes in at the finish. The mouthfeel is medium. Great drinkability. Most beers this malty aren't so easy to drink. Yet another quality offering from Mahr's."
"Drinkability: With the exception of the metallic finish, this is a superb Maibock"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: This beer had a syrupy body, and I was quite surprised by this. The color was significantly darker than macro lagers, but it was slightly similar in color I was not expecting that much. I was wrong. Even with the thicker body it was fairly light on the stomach. This is definitely a great spring beer and one that I will be recommending to friends."
"I don't know how else to describe it, I'll just point to other pale beers that similarly paint the holy in a glass with a simple trinity of pale malts, light hops, and incredible yeast - La Choulette Blond, Duvel, Weihenstephan Weisse, Saison DuPont. A beer I've worshipped before many times but held back from assigning petty numbers and weak descriptors. Who readily dissects such joyful experience? I'd rather have another, start it cold and watch it turn over and over, widen, deepen, and capture as it warms to room temperature. Helles Bock indeed."
"Pours a light orangy color, hazed, with a nice white head to it. Smells of raw sweet malts, honey, and a peppery spice. Much the same in the taste. Malty up front, sweet and doughy, with a little bit of a grain or oat taste in there, and a milk and honey character, almost mead-like, topped off with a nice spicy hop profile. I love the way these Mahr's beers all come together so nicely and subtly with a really nice medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. Always so drinkable. Another great one in a line of incredible beers from Mahr's."
"Traded a BA buddy of mine for this bottle when I stopped in for a visit on holiday. Thanks for the opportunity! Pours a two finger off-white fluffy head over a very cloudy dull lemon colored liquid. Smells rich sweet malt,c aramel and some bock. Some hops...rough and mild...so they come across to me a tettnanger. A dab of honey aroma as I drink the beer. Tatses dry with a hint of funk. That's munich malts speaking to me. A little bit of dirty tettnanger hops ties into the malt. What I find disturbing is an intrusive clove flavor that doesn't belong. I wonder if this one is starting to skunk. I once had a bottle of Hofbrau that was like this...it was a shadow of the fresh stuff I drank in Munich. Light in the mouth, but ahs a thick sugary feel. Too bad about the clove, this beer was going to rate quite well."
"Edit, 10/12/05: I've been drinking this beer for a solid two weeks now. Outrageously unique. But my question is: how would this go with spicy, authentic roux-based gumbo? I think it would go pretty well with it. In fact, I think it would be deliriously good with any southern barbecue plate."
"Not just for sipping. Complex, balanced and bracing."
"Mahr's Bock has a light haziness and is golden in color. Head is good-sized and creamy. The aroma has a light malt sweetness with a touch of honey-like smell. Aroma is very helles-like, but stronger. The taste has a great sweet malt flavor. Very flavorful and layered. A sharp sweetness is provided by a honey flavor. Hops provide balance and some bite. This is very drinkable and represents the quality I expect from Mahrs Brau."
"Pours with a one-finger light brown head that leaves a good lace. Cloudy amber color, with a few chunky bits. Medium bodied and light-medium carbonation. Malty nose. Starts sweet finishes with some soapy overtones, not a great bock. $3.25 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Pours a golden orange color with a suple offwhite head that thins rather quickly. Very sweet smell with a bit of a malty aroma. No hops in the nose. The flavor is very clean and distinct with sweet malty flavors and a bit of citrus. This is not a beer that will stand up and dance with all kinds of insane and odd flavors. This beer is straight forward and good with a strong malt character that pleases the palate."
"Sampled 12/13/03"
"Taste: light, sweetish, nothing from hops, and malt is only middling, body is very light, finish, on the forgettable side, though the sweetness is coming through...ah, I get it,now, it's a mai-bock, why didn't I realize that sooner? Crown me for the king of fools, for I was judging this against the wrong criteria, but there's half the bottle left with which to contemplate this...rich, buttery, tasty, sweet, and full of character, a terrific maibock, never going overboard in the sweetness department, yet still delciciousness personified, yum, not such a bad thing out of Bamberg, is it, now?"
"Pours out a honey yellow to settle a light pale chill hazed golden yellow; tall puffy white head that has a larger bubbly structure within that sits awhile before floating away to a very thin haze and thin collar and lace sticks in minimal strings. Aroma ain't much, but whats there is quite pleasant of a soft pretzeled bread thats slightly sweet and malty. Taste has more of the same with a good length of mild sweetish tones mixed with a dry breadiness thats a bit like a pretzel with just a touch of sea salt in there. Finish fades into some more dryness with some lighter biting hops and a small herbal quality. Feel is quite smooth with a soild medium body and bits of dryness all throughout with a very nice mild creamyness. This stuff is quite nice, a nice surprise compared to the Christmas Bock Mahr's makes. An overall, very drinkable nice little Maibock. Session material all the way."
"This bock bier poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was malty with some vegetable aroma. The taste was good and malty with a hint of vegetable. Not sweet. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body. It was slightly sweet up front but dry overall and hoppy in the finish. This was a very nice bock bier."
