"A rare forgettable brew from Victory, I thought they would've knocked this one right out of the park."

"Actually a very well done beer. Quite tasty and even better than certainly doppelbock options out there."

"This was pretty average for the style, not really something I would look for again."
""
"[O] If this is what a good sturdy Maibock is supposed to taste like, man, I have been missing out."
""
"Medium to slightly light bodied with crisp carbonation. A simple style and a simple execution in line with traditional examples. Easy drinking with well hidden alchohol. Ultimately a bit unexciting."

"Pours yellowish gold with lots of bubbles and bollowing white bubbly head. Smell of booze, vegetal hops and some sweet malt characters. Feel is crispy and creamy, lots of spice on the palate and some raw grassiness, and straw-like dryness, with some sugary malt characters. Booze is there more than expected. overall an earthy complex lager."
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a straw gold color body with just a real thin fizzy white head. The smell is a little bit citrus with a hint of mint. The taste is malty and sweet up front then i get a faint hop taste on the back of the tongue. This has a nice mouth feel and overall is well carbonated and good tasting."
"O-not really impressed with this one. it has a weird creaminess to it. doesn't remind me of anything german. not very drinkable and not something i'll be wanting again."

"This beer may be a bit too bitter for the style and I personally think it should be more grainy and sweet, but I still really enjoyed this brew."

"Pours a clear gold color, bubbly white head, gone quickly with little lacing. Scent is muted and mild, light herbal notes, faint faint caramel sweetness, touch of wet paper. Taste a little more focuses with lightly sweet malt, little in the way of fresh grain, which i like in the style, some herbal splashes on the back end. Moderate body, smooth, decently carbonated. A nice clean take on the style, just would have liked a bit more grain to the taste."

"O-aside from the alcohol being present in the taste a little too much for my liking, this is a decent brew, certainly not the best from Victory however"
""
""
"O this is a very enjoyable beer, and also my first review, so hopefully I get better at them, One thing to note is I just bought it yesterday, and it is a spring release, so it isn't 100 percent fresh"
""
"O: Its ok. Not my favorite victory beer at all."
""
""
""
""
"O - Victory did it again with slightly above average maibock that can be enjoyed during holidays. I would recommend it."
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the light aroma, with the nice and spicy malts. Despite this, the grains become overly light and floury at times. It seems highly generic and unlike a true maibock, with less body, sweetness, or strength to the malts. The sweetness that was there is erased and overpowered with bitterness, and ultimately this is a letdown for the style and for the brewery."
"As for the alcohol, that was a different story. It could have been a bit less noticeable and not only could I taste it during my session, but I could feel it by the time I got down to the bottom of the glass. While this isn't Victory's best beer, I'll probably give it another go when spring arrives, just to see if it's any better the second time around. If anything, this was more enjoyable than many of the Marzens that are currently on the shelf."
"O: Very good Helles Bock. A little on the sweet side for me, but very enjoyable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've only had a handful of beers within this style, but this one is probably my favorite so far. Another nice beer from Victory."
"I would buy this again and again."
"This poured out as a clear golden color with a decent sized head on top. The lacing on the glass was pretty good. The smell of the beer has some lemony aromas on it and some grainy malts also on the nose. The taste of the beer is pretty refreshing actually, really nice soft and smooth feel to the beer. Overall I found this to be one of the better beers from Victory brewing."
"O: Extremely smooth and drinkable. Slightly bitter and crisp. Beautiful nose and interesting flavors. Makes a nice session ale."
"Me thinks me likes."
"Poured into a snifter, a clear golden yellow with nearly two fingers of foamy white head that receded quite a bit, leaving some nice lacing. Smell of grains, bready yeast, and light floral hops. Crisp on the taste buds, biscuity, light honey, grains, lightly hopped for a floral quality, with a touch of fruit in the finish. Not overflowing with flavor, but what's there is good. Light-medium body, and quite drinkable."
"A really tasty helles, with a pleasant hop ooomph."
" One of the best American brewed German style beefy lagers."
"Overall - I think this is a good beer but not a great one from Victory. It seems more like an Imperial Pils than a Maibock/Helles Bock however."
"Medium to light bodied with good carbonation, this beer is very easily swallowed. The carbonation is a little fizzy but does not detract from the flavors or experience. The body is a good consistency but it does have a slightly sticky quality."
"Taste is sharp and crisp with a light sulfur note that is reminiscent of Prima Pils, there is a bit of alcohol present but it isn't over the top. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy but still crisp and refreshing. A good way to start a hot summer evening."
"O- It smells nice, but that is the high point. This is not a bad beer, but I have had better in the style. I don't see myself picking this up again."
"O: A decent Maibock, but I still have yet to taste an American interpretation that really rivals those made in Germany. I think this brew would benefit from a lower abv and slightly more carbonation."
"The head crests over a finger of some of the loosest foam possible, big bubbles pop and evaporate swiftly, the foam barely coats the surface, zero lacing. No beads, just random huge bubbles, has a clean light golden color of a slight metallic cast. The nose is based in pretzel dough, black pepper, orange marmalade, peach, apricot, green apple fruit scents and caramel, noticeably sweet overall with a moderate hoppiness at most, produces cereal and granola notes as it opens, quite full nostril presence. Full-bodied, its plushness and generally weak carbonation undermines the pepper, grass and straw but it is not wimpy, simply sweeter than may be desired. Displays orange, tangerine to almost pink grapefruit pulp citrus. Layers on the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, sugary and close to dried fruit in nature. Still, feels obligated to add a bitter twist to the end, this in spite of a syrupy mouth texture. Overall, feels and tastes like a “normal” everyday lager sent to finishing school and made from higher quality ingredients."
"This is a nice seasonal, and I'm glad to have had this one. Malty and mildly sweet, St. Boisterous is a good example of the style."
"Victory St. Boisterous is a very clear yellow beer with a dense, white head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is fruity and a little wooden. It smells a little like Pinesol and spilled beer. There is an almost minty character to it. It's medium bodied and very smooth with a clean, dry finish. There's a little bit of chewiness or grit left on the teeth. It tastes a little boozy and twangy, like a malt liquor or a euro lager. Alcohol, lemon detergent and light grain are there, along with an herbal, wooden bitterness that surfaces at the finish. This just really isn't my thing. It seems like it wants to be refreshing but the alcohol flavor takes away from that."
"I love the beer but when it is 85 degrees it is a bit heavy and a bit boozy. This isn't really what I consider a summer beer, heck even the St. on the bottle has a beard."
"Wow - I just found a new go to summer/spring brew. At over 7% alcohol I cant believe how well done this brew is. A good BBQ brew or beach beer, this is some sessionable stuff here. Maybe the best drinking and tasting lager type brew I have had. Caseworty - well done Victory."
"I swear Bill and Ron (Victory's brewmasters) majored in being German; they've emulated seemingly all German styles to perfection. Bocks are a style really easy to get wrong: they're easy to brew too sweet, too strong, not clean enough, not flavourful enough. You need really high-quality ingredients and a really thorough understanding of what you're doing - neither of which are ever a problem for this brewery. Watch Germany now try to annex Pennsylvania."
"Decent aromas and texture, but there are definitely some flaws in flavor. This is one to pass on."
"Full-bodied and hoppy for the style. Alcohol in the front and back, just a tad too much for the style as it takes away from the lightness you would expect in a spring or summer beer. Other than the booze, nice hop bitterness that makes the mouthfeel crisp and clean, with a dry finish. Better on the colder side, as the booziness starts to take over as it warms. A little fruitiness in the flavor too, but it's in the background. Good beer though, love Victory and their use of hops."
"This is an extremely robust lager! Not bad.. try it if you're into lagers, or want to try something different. This is pretty much what I expected from Victory."
"I liked it at first but as the pint went along, I tasted things I didn't like. If they clean up the overall flavor, it might be more enjoyable. Still worth a try."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of March 11, 2012. Sampled on April 27, 2011. It pours pale yellow with a fuzzy white head that diminishes quickly. The aroma is more grainy than anything else with a malty note thrown in on the side. The body is thin to medium but tolerable. The taste also comes across as grainy with a light but dry hop kick at the end."
"While I'm not usually a fan of the darker Bock beers, this take on the Maibock or Helles bock is an exceptional substitute for the traditional American Lager. Rather than tailgating with a Budweiser (a name I use simply for reference to lager) I suggest going with a St. Boisterous. But be warned: The name is the truth, drink too many of these in the sun and you will, in fact, become quite Boisterous."
"Pours from the 12oz. bottle a crystal clear light golden hue with a 1/2 finger head that settles into a collar of medium thickness. Carbonation is on the light side, not many bubbles visible. Aroma has a malty sweetness to it with a hint of citrus (lemon) with a hay/grass/straw note. 1st sip brings a dry hints of lemon, grass, a slightly metallic hop note, and some bready, biscuity yeast. Mouthfeel is light & refreshing, and there is little hint of the 7.4% alcohol. These would make a pretty good session beer. Overall, another very good beer from one of my favorite brewers."
"O: Drinks like a champ. The key with the style is to get it fresh and this was bottles less than two weeks ago. It was almost 80 today so this really hit the spot."
"Notes: This is my first beer experience form Victory, based in Pa, and I must say that it was a good first impression. I also enjoy the idea of a good Helles Bock, as it represents the coming of spring, and all the beer festivals that take place in Germany around that time. Compared to other Helles Bocks that I've tried such as Rogue Dead Guy and Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary, this stacks up pretty well."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very nice beer. It was crisp, clean, balanced, but also had a lot of flavor to it. Everything came together very nicely and made for a very easy drinking and tasty beer. A nice refreshing choice after working on the house all day. Definitely one of the better ones of the style I've had."
"O: I'll give it a ""good"" in overall impression."
"A slightly bubbling clear golden body with white foam head that fades to the edges of the glass. Pleasant notes of grains, cereal, slight wheat, floral, and some hops in the nose. Tastes of cereal, grains, slight dirty wheat, a flash of the booze towards the finish and then a sweet honey note mixes with hop dryness that fades out. Light bodied with light carbonation. Crisp in mouthfeel with a good malt base and a passable hop presence but the booze comes across as stale and pestering."
"This beer is a mostly clear golden color with a very slim head. Nice, malt-heavy aroma. The beer has a slightly toasted scent, with a bread and alcohol scent. Clean flavor, with a prominent malt character. A little sulfur-like note, but otherwise clean. Sweet. Firm body, and very drinkable. Overall, a good bock."
"Drinkability is alright. The hops-honey combination didn't work that well for me but the beer was not terrible."
"On tap at the Hulmeville. Poured light orange with decent head that did disappear to nothing. Caramel malts, a quick spicey hop flash and a bready yeasty finish that lingers for a while on the palate. Smooth malty beer which finished dry but nothing really standing out. Easily drinkable"
"Okay drinkability. Not very close to style. Needs more malt, more bitterness, less astringency, and a clearer appearence."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass. Pours clear orange gold, thin white head. A quite fragrant beer - interesting mixture of flowers, honey, and spices. Not to heavy but definitely distinct. Taste adds a moderate bitter hop over a lightly sweet malt (has elements that remind me of honey). Not very good carbonation with lingering sediments which I found odd coming from Victory. Very flat, lacks head and lace. Am going against the grain here and say I wasn't impressed with this one overall."
"D: Like most Helles, this one boasts good drinkability -- even given this particular high gravity recipe. I'd happily order this beer at a bar on a random night, and that's something I can rarely say about any lager."
"D - well done. Not gonna drink a sixer like you might with a more typical bock, but this one is worth it, especially in a snowy winter like now. And yet, it's not like they gone and brewed a barleywine or a porter or something wacky: it's still very recognizable. And I like it anyway. Not the first time Victory has made me a believer in styles I'd otherwise discard. Props."
"Fortunately, this is a winter beer because it's perfect to keep you warm. It's got a warm smell and warm flavors, and just enough alcohol to warm you up as well."
"This one pours a a muddied orange brown, kind of like apple cider. The bottle is a little old so the aromas don't come out as they should. It smells of subtle pale sweet malts with light citrusy sweetness. It tastes very good for a Helles Bock. The citrusy hops complement the pale malts quite well. It drinks smooth with mild carbonation. I'm a fan of this one. I normally don't like this style but it has good flavor and is very drinkable for 7.4%."
"D: Very drinkable beer, goes down smooth."
"Another second-chancer, which I'm happy to see out here in the middest of the Midwest. It pours a pretty clear pale amber topped by a finger of wan ecru foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuits, orange zest, caramel, and a light smattering of flowers. The taste strikes a very nice balance between orange-laden citrus on the one hand and buttery bread and caramel on t'other. Good times. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a decidedly nice brew, something to kick back on a lazy autumn day."
"The tastes are nice and pleasant. Somewhat sweet with pale malts, honey, grain, some pepperiness from the yeast and some mild grassy hops on the finish. Body is medium to light and the mouthfeel is crisp with fairly lively carbonation. Drinkability is high. A very solid beer through and through."
"A medium amber color with some visible carbonation. A light beige to white colored head, that starts at a half inch and dissolving away to a thin layer on top. A malty fragrance, with touches of bread and cracked grain, finishing with a mild feint scent of grass. Malt, malt and more malt is the dominant flavor, with bread and biscuit flavors. Those flavors last till the back end, when it finishes with a hop bitterness of grass and citrus, did I mention the malt. The consistent medium body lasts all the way through, it leaves a medium dryness at the end. This is really drinkable, the color and aroma are classic for the style. The taste is malty, more malty than I would prefer, but it takes nothing away from the flavor. Overall this is a great beer for spring and the summer heat."
"Pours a slightly opaque off-gold color with a white head. The nose brings a lot of bread with a bit of grain and some light fruit notes. While the nose is certainly quite mild, I get a lot of different fruit notes sneaking out from underneath the doughy exterior. The taste dials back on this a bit, and ends up being more of a sweet bread-type brew. However, for the style it style has quite a bit of nice flavor. The feel is nice, with a light to medium body that's slightly creamy. Overall, this is a very good American rendition of the style."
"D: So drinkable that the 7.4% ABV makes for dangerous combination."
"D - goes down easy enough."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly and leaves some lace. Slight hazy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Almost a caramel nose. Flavor is malty and hoppy, nice maibock. The higher ABV is totally hidden. $2.65 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"a great maibock with a european quality. a german lager done rather well by an american brewery. this doesn't sell short. it has a lot of helles qualities with a nice noes of pollen honey/apple blossom sweet. that palate is in the middle with a mild hoppy brightness and a honey soaked hay. the bitter is there and just right. it tastes like a helles with a bit of a abv punch. the caramel notes are there. the sticks bitter is there and a gritty feeling on the gums. definitely having again."
"MD-This is a very easy drinker, as most are other maibocks I have had. The high alcohol content is alway a shocker for Maibocks."
"D: This was a pretty nice lager that was fairly basic, but light and easy to drink. The aftertaste was a bit harsh, especially considering how tame the taste was up front. But the alcohol was well hidden, and it was a generally enjoyable drink."
"D) A well crafted, true to form maibock. I'd have another."
"This is a decent maibock. Not my favorite product from Victory, but very drinkable."
"d- nice drinkability, this is like springtime in a glass. i would definately drink this again, another in the long line of awesome victory brews."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale and Vienna malt scent along with a touch of citrus and malt sweetness. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor that boasts of pale and Munich malts along with a dry yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed Hellesbock. It's malt forward with a damn smooth finish."
"D: One of the better interpretations of a Maibock, along with Rogue's Dead Guy Ale. Not as easy drinking as your typical lager; the abv is higher than average. Though, it was over 14 bucks for a sixer. Tough to justify purchasing this too frequently."
"Pours a clear, dark yellow with 1 finger of head that fades to a ring without much lacing. The aroma is pleasant, with caramel malt and hints of butter and some nuttiness. Big, malty flavor upfront, with a nice, creamy body followed by some bitterness on the back end that helps to cut the sweetness of the malt. The finish is lingering and somewhat woody and drinkability is very good. I discovered this on tap at the Tap & Mallet and ended up buying a few 6er's. This is a tasty beer, all though I must admit I have been on a bit of a Maibock kick lately."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Light and refreshing, especially when it's ice cold. This beer SCREAMS ""SPRING"" from the top of its lungs. Nice. I'll be looking into this style a bit more...It has a lot of potential I think."
"Overall, liked this beer. I would definitely purchase again after trying a few other Victory offerings. It leaves the tongue with a bit of a heavy feeling, but other than that this is a pretty solid choice."
"I'm a big fan of this beer, especially on tap in a growler."
"D: A classic example of a Maibock. The integration of the alcohol allows for a sneak attack if you aren't careful."
"A good beer, and very drinkable for that 7.0% abv tag."
"D: The alcohol is well masked from the smell and taste. The beer is relatively easy to drink and I wouldn't mind trying this again when I'm outside on a spring day."
"drinkable as all git out. this is sort of perfect for what it is. pure balance. is this really a 7+abv concoction?"
"Drinkability: Could have sveral of these if not for the alcohol which hits hard. A nice and clean maibock. Simple yet elegant."
"Pours a deep gold to very light amber color. Excellent frothy head that persists for a long time. Would make an ideal ad for a magazine advertisement just from the looks. Aroma is very clean. Some light bready & toastiness. No noticeable hop aroma. Flavor is sweet caramel like with a honey finish. Very nice display of malt flavor. Again bread-like. Good carbonation with nice medium mouthfeel. Not too light or heavy like. Drinkability is so-so. I enjoy this very much, but maybe not a big fan of the style"
"All in all such a nice spring brew, that we actually went back to that tiny Pizza place in WB (""Antonio's"") and bought more!"
"I have to say that this maybe my new spring goto brew. Very drinkable with a ABV that will sneak up on you. Happy Spring! Thanks Neil & the empire Beer Club."
"d: Plenty here to like, but there are some better examples of the style to be found locally. This did hit the spot after 5 hours of yard work."
"I could drink at least two, maybe three in a sitting and savor every drop."
"On tap at the other side outside on the patio. Clear copper color with thick white creamy head. Tons of nonstop carbonation. Very nice appearance. Fruity , bready smell, kind of faint. Sweet, malty, bready, fruity (grape) taste with slightly oily / resin aftertaste. Chewy thick feel up front with carbonation on backend. Could go for a couple. Gets better as warms up and carbonation dies down a little."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Creamy, carbonated well, goes down well. Very drinkable. Recommended"
"This is fairly drinkable however the abv is sneaky. Fits the style well and is clean and crisp in the finish. Can easily have a few of these in a sitting."
"D-Very drinkable. Cant believe its a 7.5. I would give it another go."
"It was a good beer and very true to the style. Dark coppery color, good carbonation that's much lighter than the beer. ABV is a little strong for the flavor/color etc. but in general it was a great beer."
"D - I would be happy if this was part of a variety pack excuse me while I do some research..."
"D - goes down very nicely. i do lament the 7+% because I would like to have a few more."
"The flavor is dry and similar to dark toasted bread. Relatively thin body for the style but the low carbonation balances the body nicely. Earthy flavor (like the aroma). Not quite harsh in flavor, but it isn't sweet or light like other Maibocks. Still, it is flavorful and worth seeking out."
"D - Very clean, crisp and easy to drink. ABV well within style norms...very drinkable"
"Pours a clear copper color wth a small tight tan head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of a honey malt with some light grassy hops. The aroma was faint, so I didn't pick much up. The taste is of a smooth caramel malt and some light pepper spice. Surprisingly not much of a hop pick up. Doesn't seem to resemble a maibock too much but tastes good. A nice full body, smooth despite some prickly carbonation, finishes with a very light grassy bitterness. This might not be the most flavorful maibock but it drinks very nice, the ABV is well hidden."
"St. Boisterous is an interesting bock, and like everything Victory makes it is good and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable mai-bock. I've had several now before doing this review and find myself enjoying them quite a bit. It is not earthshakingly good but it is definitely a good solid tasty brew that I'll return to again."
"D - My first maibock review. I'm not sure at this point if anything really stands out about it, but it was a pleasure to drink, and I could definitely have a few more."
"Not much more to say than that. Great beer. Victory scores once again with one of their fantastic German interpretations."
"Extremely drinkable, could be drinking this one through summertime."
"pretty light bodied, though thats to be expected. decent carbonation. drinks ok as well. not a bad spring beer. refreshing, yet kinda tasty. alcohol burn in the aftertaste hurts it here though."
"D: I am really impressed by Victory's endeavors into German styles. I can't believe how delicate this beer is, especially at 7.4 abv. This is definitely worth a try."
"Pours a hazy gold color. Small head cap and no lacing. Smells like sweet clover honey with a touch of lemon zest. Taste has a lively spice to it, mixed with a rich malty sweetness. Also a little citrus and a bit of grassiness via the german hops. Can detect a bit of the alcohol but it's not overpowering. Bottle says full bodied and that is not false advertising. More creamy and heavy than I was expecting from this golden bock. Carbonation gives a crisp bite which is unexpected with the creamy mouthfeel. Bitterness is balanced out by the big malts. Drinkable for sure, probabaly not one I would session though. I love Victory's lineup, so I'm not sure why I had low expectations for this brew. I can say I was pleasantly suprised to find a flavorful, enjoyable golden bock."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a small head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is of malts and grains, well balanced but not a lot of flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent brew."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Overall this is a solid example of the style."
"This beer is absolutely outstanding. It reminds me of a ""double"" prima pils, also from Victory. Very creamy and smooth. Nice texture with nice lacing and an apricot scent. Gorgeous, refreshing with a twinge of hoppiness on the backend, finishes fairly dry. Dangerously drinkable and strong. This is a terrific brew and I am glad I have a case of it."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. The bottle has a fresh by date April of 2010. After being poured this brew had very little head and not much carbonation being released. This beer has very little aroma. The taste is a little dry and biscuit like malt flavor. A few sweet fruit tastes, slight white grape. This beer is very smooth drinking and easy to put down a few. The alcohol is moderately noticable and relaxing."
"The mouthfeel is so light, I might as well be water. Despite its lightness not a very drinkable because of the weird aftertaste."
"M/D: Light bodied, a little slick, low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. A very solid beer through and through."
"single bottle picked up at Norm's in Vienna, VA"
"Bright clear gold, mild orange with a foamy off white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing. Very fresh aroma, straw and grass like, minimal malt and hop, not too complex or exciting. Sharp carbonation with a soft fluffy body. Expecting more of a malt presence from this beer than there is, slightly fruity sweet that is nicely balanced by floral hops in the finish. Not an exceptional mai/heller bock and slightly disappointing based on everything else Victory does but still very drinkable and flavorful."
"A nice, light yellow pour with light lacing. Didn't detect a noticeable nose. A light mouthfeel, very summer oriented brew. Thirst quenching, easy to drink. A highly drinkable summer beer, this beer would be my choice for an all summer brew, thanks to the folks at Victory Brewing Co."
"Dirnkability: A yummy lager that drinks like an ale. I could hardly determine the yeast style. I don't think I would reach for it again."
"Thanks For Reading"
"Um, no. Boring, too sweet, and too heavy."
"As a Spring offering, seems to slot between a pleasing Winter ale and a crisp Summer ale, so points go to Victory for that, but, not good enough to look forward to over a cold winter. I would feel pretty bleak about the change of season if this was the beer to greet me."
"Overall 3.8 - Very nicely done here. Nothing crazy and outrageous but very nicely done. I would have no issue at all with going forward with this."
"Fairly drinkable, but a touch too sweet. Would not have guessed this was a 7%+ ABV without knowing."
"Don't drink and review."
"Overall: Very nice indeed and very easy drinking. Had 2 and did not even realize the ABV was this high."
"I have not had many Helles Bocks. but I like this beer."
"Notes: A good beer,but not for the summer. Finish is dry. Overall the beer's ABV can be sensed and it while the balance is good I can not see myself having more than two only because the finish is so dry."
"If this is typical of the style then it ranks a ways down the list for me but it seems to fit to style quite well and I certainly don't dislike it."
"D - Highly drinkable and tasty. A bit dangerous at 7.4% because this drinks quickly. Would be quite sessionable minus the ABV."
"I found the beer to appear a deeper gold, much more so than a pilsner. It was highly carbonated with a bubbly head and thick lacing. It first hit me as crisp, like a cider (in the carboation sense, not sweetness). I agree that there were citrus notes which presented themselves more and more over time, but it wasn't overall sweet. I'd never had the style before and intend to return to it in the near future."
"This is a nice summer beer. It's flavorful, crisp and refreshing."
"D: Overall this is a very well made beer, and it gains complexity as it warms. Does a great job as a spring ale."
"D - A great Maibock w/ plenty of Malt, the flavor is complex yet still smooth enough to be considered very drinkable. The taste ripples across the tongue and begs for repeated tastes. A very fine example of the style -represents well."
"D - Really sessionable for a 7.3% brew. This felt lighter than your typical Maibock, almost like a pilsner but with a more pronounced sweet palate and heftier malt character."
"D. This is a pretty good summer beer. There is a sweetness and hop to balance. The German schooled brewer of Victory scores again. Recommended."
"D - This is a good German-style beer...a nice drinkability on a hot day...another solid beer from Victory"
"The mouthfeel is thick, medium carbonation, no lingering bitterness, just a touch sweet. Very nice, I could drink a few of these without a problem."
"This was my first Maibock/Helles Bock. I was surprised by the translucent golden color until I remembered reading about how this seasonal is not dark like other bocks. It was pleasantly sweet and had a weak floral smell. It was refreshing for what it was but a little high in ABV. Sipping beer."
"Pours a nice clear golden color with some nice initial head and some good lacing. Excellent aroma, very crisp and clean with a nice pineapple aroma. Great taste, sharp and malty with a nice slight banana/clove taste and a good hit of German hops in the finish that last on the tongue for a bit, along with a slight pineapple taste. Goes down great, the over 7% ABV isn't noticable at all."
"D - Personally, I struggle with Maibocks, but this is a wonderful example that I find quite enjoyable... Solid all the way around and makes me want to continue my exploration of the styel..."
"It picks up significantly in the taste department. Sweet (I'm getting pears and honey), strong doughy malts, a touch of herbal hops and a faint wisp of smoke along with the spicy alcohol at the end. I don't usually drink lagers, but this was very tasty, well-balanced, a great American lager."
"This is a very tasty beer. Victory comes through once again!"
"D: A little on the hefty side.. .while the style can be a little higher in alcohol, it seems a little ""big"" I don't see myself going through a lot in on sitting. That said, it's a tasty brew, and certainly enjoyable."
"3.5 D: Not the biggest fan of the style, but this is an alright brew."
"An okay lazy afternoon beer. Missing that second gear though."
"D -- Not bad to style, there are better versions out there, but that's not to say this isn't a good addition to the group."
"A nice brew from Victory brewing. I was a bit ready to not like this beer and it surprised me. This is my first Mailbock so I know I wasn't quite sure waht to expect. I can't wait to have this again."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly fades. Golden crisp fruit aroma with hints of apple, pear banana, hops and spice. Maltier than I expected with a crisp fruit taste which is not very prominent with a delicate hop presence. Slightly bitter dry finish."
"Pours gold and pretty much clear. Head is creme colored. Flavor kicks the mouth with sweetness at first. Seems like a smokey tone lays on the end as well. But mostly it's the sweet that you notice. As you get used to it, you notice the malty more than anything. Feel is smooth on liquid and low on carbonation. Fairly easy to drink, but wouldn't go at it again."
"Drinkability: Refreshing; sweet but not cloying with a crisp finish"
"Overall a crisp and refreshing segue between the stouts and dopplebocks of winter and the bright pilsners and wheat beers of summer. I think the buildup on my palate over an extended session (along with the ABV) would probably limit me to 3 or 4 before it stopped being enjoyable, though drinking it with food would definitely help. Victory once again displays their mastery of the German lagers. This will be in my spring lineup every year."
"Really nice, I would love for this to find it's way out here to the Oregon market."
"D- Good enough to have a few of these, but at 7.4% ABV, I'll only drink one or two."
"not my favorite style of beer but victory always turns out stellar products. a solidly constructed beer worth seeking out."
"Nice beer."
"D: A good spring beer indeed."
"D: Perect winter to summer beer. Winding down from the heavy beers but not quite time for full time drinking of quaffable pils and wheats. Great for one or two at a sitting."
"Copped a single, 12 oz bottle from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... nice golden, copper, apple-juice appearance with minimal head... sweet, candied aroma with florals and cinnamon sugars... taste strongly complements the aroma, with a sugar-laden, vanilla, caramel, and butter flavor that is ultra-thick and truly rich... The best thing about this beer is the uncloying, and non-intrusive flavor that goes down smooth, crisp, and clean without any trace of bitterness or alcohol... one of the better brews from Victory... a nice sample full of character, flavor, and great taste... pears and grapefruit along with floral notes are also noticeable... nice light, refreshing mouthfeel and relatively easy drinkability that goes down like sugared-water without any hint of bitterness or alcohol... a top-notch Victory brew... Definitely recommended..."
"Rich golden color topped by a fairly dense, long lasting head. Aroma is havy on the malt side with a touch of noble hops. Flavor is also very malty, a touch a alcohol heat in there. Nice hop flavor in the finish. Mouthfeel is decent, not too carbonated. Drinkability is very good."
"Drinkability: For a beer that a couple months over due, it still made for a good light beer that would make any spring season special. I would like to try this Victory beer fresh. If it's this good now, it has to better when it's not overdue."
"D: The fairly substantial ABV is hidden very well, leaving this very easy to drink. The only issue is that it's a bit too sweet, as I tired of it quickly."
"Another good beer from Victory!!!"
"It's plenty drinkable. But the malt base is thin and feeble. Thus it doesn't satisfy the meatiness that I want in a bock."
"Mouthfeel is full-bodied yet not heavy by any means. Nicely done, quite a simple beer but well done nonetheless."
"Victory brews some of the best beer to be found in this country. Storm King Stout, Prima Pils, Hop Wallop... all superb. Even though maibock/helles bock isn't among my favorite styles, I can appreciate a good one when I drink it. St. Boisterous is decent beer, but no more than that."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, sticky lacing on the skimpy side. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, pears/apples, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly spicy, some what hoppy, with a big dose of pears/apples, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice Maibock, glad to have had a chance to try it out, recommended."
"Another winner from the guys over at Victory. Not a style I see very often but they nailed it. Keep it up over there."
"Pours a one finger head that disipates to near nothingness, thus, leaving little lacing. It's an amber colored ale with ocassional bubles rising to the top indicating a lighter carbonation. Smells of piney hops, but its scent is well short of an IPA. Tastes of bread and alcohol and finishes with bitterness. Thin mouthfeel and light carbonation. Amazingly drinkable for its abv. Victory is one of my favorite local breweries and I love Hellerbocks, but this one comes up as being just above average."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, excellent representation of style, strong kick that is well-disguised, I could definitely drink several of these in a row. This is a great beer to stick with for a whole evening."
"Pours golden in color, with a short-lived white head. Light aroma; some sweet malt with touch of fruitiness to it. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and crisp. There's a malty sweetness to the flavor upfront which is broken up by a sharp hop bitterness. Sweet graininess is apparent toward the back. 7.4% alcohol is, surprisingly, not that noticeable. Decent maibock overall."
"A very drinkable Maibock; just wish they hadn't run out of it at Victory a couple of weeks ago."
"Taste is really the same as the smell but it is more robust. Nice malt sweetness with some caramel and honey flavor, and a fruitiness, as well, that again I can best describe as apple or pear. The fruitiness in the nose stands out more than it does in the taste. Good lager flavor overall, and very crisp, smooth and refreshing. Not bad."
"The beer is clear and light orange colored, with no head at all, just some skimpy bubbles on top. The smell was mighty nice though, malty and doughy, leading to a sweet malty flavor (a little bitter in the aftertaste). Thick enough to satisfy as a bock should in my opinion, but thin enough to be easily drinkable (except the ABV tempers that a little). Very nice heller bock."
"This one was okay overall. No real flaws but nothing memorable. It does a good but not great job of representing the style and once again drinkability is a bit low for me as I'm just not crazy about the style as a whole. If you like the style you'll be into this one a heck of a lot more than I was, but still, I've got no complaints..."
"An outstanding American interpretation of the style. The fresh grain, balanced sweetness and just enough alcohol make this a wonderful mid-to-late spring drink. Good one to sip in the cool to warm, but not-yet-hot weather."
"This is my first Helles Bock, so here goes. Pours a clear gold with a fluffy one finger head that dies down to a lacing soon after pour that remains. Spotty lacing throughout tasting. Carbonation is rushing to the top of the glass. Such a sweet yeasty up front aroma. A bit of citrusy hops seem to tingle the nose as well. Taste is very clean and crisp on the tounge with a honey like flavor that lingers. Flavor is a bit one-dimensional, not sure if that's common in this style, but I was looking for more complexity. Very light mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good for the 7.4% because of how clean this beer is. Give it a try if you get the chance."
"This beer pours a beautiful dark gold color (like something Rumpelstiltsken would make) with lots of very durable and fluffy white head. Aroma is very cereal-y and pleasant. Flavor is not bad, and is a malt-cereal flavor that is neither malty-sweet nor cereal hearty. Not bad, but hard to put my finger on. Mouthfeel is pretty decent and smooth. Not bad."
"Pours a nice amber-copper color, with a finger of white head and tons of rising bubbles. Head disappears fairly quickly, and there doesn't appear to be any lacing. Nose is sweet and malty, with a little citrus, and some honey. Not bad. Taste is interesting, definitely fits the designation of a light bock. A pretty balanced beer, although that balance might even mean a little bland. First is some spiciness and a touch of alcohol on the tongue, then the sweeter caramel and honey malt. Hops show up at the end and balance it out a little with an almost watery smoothness. Feel is medium, solid carbonation; maybe a little thin for my taste. Overall it's not a bad beer, if nothing particularly interesting. Maybe that's just the genre, as this is my first helles bock."
"The beer pours an interesting orange, copper color. There is very little head or lacing, though on the nose one picks up some honey and sweet malt. Not bad, though scarcely impressive. On the palate this beer is very light and one dimensional, with a pronounced flavor of sweet malt. Frankly, I was amazed at the abv., as this beer is very light and drinkable, if not particularly interesting. The flavor became a bit more pronounced as it sat in the glass and warmed up, but utlimately this came across as a light, one dimensional, summer quaffing beer. It's fine for what it is I suppose, but this is not what I'm looking for when I pay $3.50 for a bottle of beer. I cannot say this is one of the better Maibocks I've had."
"Notes: Not a bad Maibock. One you could sip nice on cool on a spring day. Watch out as you're sipping it nice and cool though. The 7.2 may catch up with you."
"I always look forward to drinking good spring bocks,this poured int a pokal a clear medium gold with a tight formed one finger white head that settled pretty slowly.Alot of things going on in the nose caramel sweetness and bread grain mainly with hints of vegetable and iron the alcohol really doesnt show thru much here,not as sweet as I thought it would be from judging other reviews yeah it has some definent caramel sweetness along with a sweet dough character and green gape with pear note but a decent herbal hop presence is there along with that vegetal note.Some grain alcohol flavors come thru as it warms a bit but it warms you on a cold 40 degree spring day here in the Buffalo area.I have wanted to try this for quite awhile and I am glad I had the chance."
"Poured gleaming gold into the glass, with some nice head retention- seems to glow, very attractive brew. Aromas of bready malts, tangy spiciness and a hint of alcohols and solvent. Taste is unexpectedly harsh- huge rawness in both the alcohol and hops up front. Not so much bitter, but tongue curling all the same. Malts are also huge and overly sweet like green grapes and biscuits. Honey-like sticky sweetness on the finish, the mouthfeel is syrupy and heavy. There is that obvious lager-ish yeast flavor that helps keep it somewhat crisp and balanced but the harsh flavors need to be grounded."
"Glad to try the regular bock then going for the ""double"" as I usually do. Great effort from Victory."
"Poured out a semi cloudy orange brown color with a decent off white head that shrunk into a thin film of blah. The nose is like fruit cake, warm cherry pie, alcohol, more lousy fruit cake, and even more fruit cake. Why would they do this? I hate fruit cake! The taste Is of corrupt malt, singing with alcohol and fruity esters, some prune, and a bit of dark sour cherry. Mouthfeel is mild and tame, finishes cloying and syrupy. Not terribly drinkable, but not unbearable either. Overall an ok beer worth trying, but not a favorite of mine."
"The mouthfeel is light bodied and flavorful. Good beer."
"The first few times I tried this beer I wasn't totally sold on it. However, now that I have sipped a few, I begun much more accustomed to the maltiness. At first blush I would have said way too much malt, but it has grown on my palate and I enjoy it much much more. Though it strays a little from the classic style (IMO), it is still a nice tip of the hat to the German style. Thank goodness all those German expats moved to PA and thank goodness I only live a few hours away!"
"Very well-balanced american german-style lager. I wish I had more background with the style to comment more."
"Drinkability: I could easily session this and would love to have another."
"Started out as just a so-so- kind of beer but it got better as it goes. I bought a case of this beer, and after the first couple bottles I think I had a little bit of buyers remorse. But by the time I finished the case I wise the beer store still had more of this seasonal offering left. Needless to say, its a beer that grows on you."
"Overall it is a drinkable, well crafted brew. Sit back sip and discuss."
"Overall a full bodied bock. A good solid ABV. Tasty and drinkable."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"A golden honey elixir color with sparse bubbles and a meager head. Some atringent yet sweet fruits greeet the nose. But not very pronounced. A light, malty beer with very subtle nuances of honeydew and cantaloupe. A little spice hit at the end from the alcohol. This beer worked rather well with some medium to hot chili."
"D - A very enjoyable, but deceptive, brew. It's sneaky in the sense that the higher abv doesn't really come out as the beer goes down so lightly. The enjoy-by-date was actually two days ago, but I'm glad I waited a few months to try it. Excellent selection!"
"Crystal clear orangey gold. Amazingly pale for such a robust all-malt brew. A loose topping of head dies away to a thin collar immediately. The lack of head is disappointing. The aroma is packed to the gills with toasty, grainy german malt. Very nice. Some pilsy notes in there. Just a whisper of floral german hops. Bold, but very clean. The flavor starts with rich, bready german malt. More white bread toast than caramel, sweet but not overly so. Remarkably clean and well lagered. Zippy carbonation keeps the heavier body from feeling sluggish. Perhaps a hint of grassy esters. Very faint, if any. Softly hopped in the finish, a little dab of spicy, floral hop zest. Ends off with a crackle of carbonation, bread crumbs and vacant dryness on the tongue. Very good and drinkable, save for a bit of excessive burpiness from the carbonation. Begs for another sip. One of the best pale bocks I've had. They did a great job on this one."
"D- This looks like a small light beer but it is really a big beer in disguise. Good flavor but I would like them to be a bit bolder. Very interesting."
"Drinkability - this is good beer, and very sessionable."
"D - It is pretty easy to drink. Mild enough for a variety of food. It seems true to the Maibock style, but I feel that it comes up short from being a really good beer. It seems to be a bit lacking in innovation. Granted, it does seem like it is a style that shouldn't be tampered with greatly, but I did expect a bit more."
"12 oz bottle, best enjoyed by Oct 13, '06. Pours a crystal clear honey with very active carbonation, thin white head that disappears quickly, no lacing. Nose is a strong sweet pilsner malt with a touch of spicy hops, nice. Taste is a sweet bready malt, slight bit of honey, a bit toasty, finishing with a slight grassy hop bitterness and a lingering malt flavor. Pretty nice beer, nice full body, easy to drink. I don't have much experience with the style, but I definitely prefer this to Dead Guy."
"The flavor is quite bready as well. Nice caramel sweetness. The hops are grassy, herbal, and spicy, mixing well with the rest of the brew. The body is surprisingly full, as well as crisp and clean. Overall it's a good Maibock. I look forward to trying it fresher in '07."
"This is another Victory lager worth bragging about."
"12 oz bottle. This one pours a crystal clear medium golden color with a fleeting coat of head. This beer is brilliant, almost glowing. The aroma is solid with pilsner malt sweetness with a mild toasted bread melanoidan quality. There is also a kiss of spicey noble hop that rounds it out really nicely. This smells really nice. Flavor is very focused towards pilsner malt sweetness, with a solid honey sweet maltyness. The toasted notes hit secondarily and this is followed quickly by a very mild bitterness that doesn't hang on very long at all. I think the sweetness is a little much, and the toasted notes could be a little stonger for my flavor. Feel is moderate, with a very mild carbonation. I like this beer. It is solid all around, and a style I would like to see more of on the shelves."
"A vigourous pour into my snifter raises virtually no head, only a few sparse bubbles around the glass. The beer is a slightly transparent golden yellow. The nose is malty sweet, and somewhat lemony. There's also a touch of floral hops. Taste is not nearly as sweet as expected, and in fact is quite mild. It does hide the alcohol very well, though. There's not much to dislike about the taste, but not much there. The mouth is somewhat thin, and is almost non-carbonated. I won't be coming back to this, and I'm surprised that Vic'ry put this out. (Enjoy by 10 13 06)"
"Pours a clear golden color with a touch of orange. Head is almost non existent. Aroma is crisp spicy hops. No malt in the nose surprising. Taste is sweet and malty upfront but quickly slapped back by a generous portion of hops. Sweetness is very lightly toasted toffee, bordering on light plumb. No astringency, just clean spicy hops. Medium to heavy body. Bitterness lingers into the aftertaste. Easy drinking, well balanced yet interesting beer. Not a typically sweet bock. As it warms, the malts starts to come out more in the aroma."
"-Oelergud"
"Slàinte!"
"Pours light orange/amber small white head gone in seconds. Aroma of malty honey, sticky hint to it, even left a little stickyness on the pint glass. Surprising amount of fruit and a nice spicy hop bite. A nice switch from my normal everyday Bells Oberon"
"Very drinkable. One of my favorite Victory beers to date. Reminds me a little of a toned down version of Golden Monkey."
"12 oz. bottle, best before 10/13/06 - served in a pilsner glass. St. Boisterous pours a nice deep gold with light carbonation and half an inch of off white head that reduces to a collar and leaves little lacing. The aroma is sweet with molasses, caramel, and toasty malts. The flavor adds to this hearty grains and a mild hop bitterness from leafy/green hops that are subdued by the large amount of malt. It is medium-bodied with ample carbonation and is actually quite big for a beer this light in color - it's almost like I'm chewing on barley, but not in a bad way. Overall it's a very nice lager that I would certainly drink again."
"Moderate mouth that benefits from the carbonation. Again good balance is shown. Very drinkable for those nights when a break from my usual routine of dark and heavy ales is in order."
"Pour is disappointing for a Victory product. An amber body with practically no head. The smell is a combination of warm, sweet malt and a bit of bittering hops, though. Not spectacular, but definitely nice. Taste is extremely pleasant. Nice lagery smoothness with a bit of bite at the end. It does, indeed taste German. Alcohol taste is nonexistent. Mouthfeel is medium with a higher than average level of carbonation. This things a quaffer in the drinkability category."
"Thanks Muenchenerkindl!"
"Anyway, pours without much of a head, a tawny, deep gold. Nose has a mild earthy twinge of hops but is decidedly sweet and herbal. Smooth and crisp with little carbonation, but with a mellow flavorful malty backbone to balance the grassy, sweet honey flavors. As I said before, the alcohol hides quite well in this one and can sneak up to your brain before you know it. A Spring seasonal indeed, but one that is quite refreshing desite the +7% ABV. An enjoyable sipper all summer long when one tires of the various wheats and lighter lagers."
"Pours a deep gold color with a white head that fades quickly. Smell of sweet grass as well as light nutty sweet malted barley with a little lemoniness. Taste follows the aroma with the sweet matiness dominating especially as it warms, there is again a hint of lemoniness and a little crisp-ness in the finish. Light to medium in body and fairly drinakble. I think I prefer this one on the colder side as it is a little more crisp, probably not refrigerator cold but as it warms to room temp the crispness definitely fades."
"Very drinkable when something heavier and warming will hit the spot. Not a brew for a summer afternoon."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability. St. Boisterous is a little sweet for my taste but I still find it very drinkable considering the 7.4% abv. Plenty of sweet fruity malts that is balanced out in the finish with a dose of hops. My 1st Heller bock so I don't have anything to compare it to. Definitely a beer I would have again, just don't think I could make a session out of it. I fine German Lager from the folks at Victory. Seek it out and give it a try."
"more like saint ordinarius... sorry victory, this one just doesn't do it for me.. now pass me a storm king !"
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a large head that quickly subsides to a film. Smell is very sweet and malty with some nice hops. Taste is also very sweet, crisp and clean. Taste has some slight carmel hints and a little hoppyness. Very good in the mouth with strong flavors and good carbination. A good drinkable helles bock."
"nice brew. good choice by me"
"Nice frosty sent by BeerBeing."
"12 ounce bottle, enjoy by Oct. 31, 06. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"Pours nice golden dark color with almost no head which is slightly disappointing. Smells spicy hop appley with a maltyness that comes as a rogue wave. I was not prepared for the first sip, I thought I was getting a nice light beer, but the hop juice punched my teeth in as I stumbled back. Wow this is loaded with a great hop charater and is followed nicely with german malted grains with just a touch of alcohol. The body is pretty solid and this would be all day drinking material on tap. I think it might suffer a little in the bottle."
"This rich, but restrained heller bock is a tasty one. Nicely dry yet pleasantly fruity as well. The alcohol is well hidden even though you can get a nice whiff of it in the aroma and just a touch of that familiar burn in the flavor. I have only one minor complaint about this one; the head had barely any retention and didnt leave behind even the slightest lace. Nonetheless, I certainly recommend this deceptively drinkable strong lager, especially if, like me, youre a big fan of the style."
"Like I said...I won't finish this six-pack off. No offense Victory....love your beers, but this one is off the mark."
"Brilliant golden orange, clear, clean, with a small, tight, off-white head. Smells of honey, tangy vegetal sweetness, fruity malt sugars, maple syrup, and spicy herbal hops. Nice and very hellesbockish. Spicy hop edge up front on an otherwise malty sweet taste. Honey and vegetal malt sweetness, with flashes of sugar. Cooked vegetable twang/bitterness in the finish. Kind of warming, but not hot. A good lager for this cool 4th of July evening as the fireworks rain down outside. Nothing exceptional, but a solid Victory."
"Very drinkable brew. Victory makes a habit of this...This is an easy 6-pack drinker IMO."
"Drink ability is very high I do like this style and this is a very good example! Prost MK"
"A smooth and subtle mouthfeel to begin, the flavors carry nuances of smoke, peat and toasted malt. Mild hops counter the sweetness leading to a nicely balanced beer. One of Victory's finest offerings."
"Dnot bad, but not great either. Worth a try, but I wouldnt buy a bunch of these."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I can't get this in my area but if you can I recommend picking some up."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a scant 1/4"" off-white head above the clear tarnished gold brew. Head quickly disappears down to a few localized bubbles and a light film, with average lacing. Aroma is juicy fruits and pale grains. Taste is pale malt sweetness, with blushes of fruit in the middle, and a lightly warming close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice. Could be a definite session prospect."
"Golden yellow with a nice white head. Sweet, slightly fruity aroma with malts behind. This beer reminds me of a good helles lager. I dont know where the bock fits in, but this is a strong and tasty lager. After the initial sweetness, it gives way to bready malts. Not much for hops, but a very ncie beer. Great drinkability for the strength. Call it a go to beer for a hot day when you want a buzz."
"I'll finish the rest of the 6-er, but none too quickly, and without any exceptional pleasure."
"Pours clear, straw color with the slightest amount of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, like good champagne. Aromas of spice, flowers and bread with corresponding tastes. Everything about this beer says spring and it is almost like the malts are young? Makes me want another sip, because there is something lingering that I just cant place and want to taste again. Another great lager from Victory!"
"Drinkability: I'll certainly be getting a 6-pack of this soon enough, as I think it's really delicious. Not the most complex brew in the entire world, but the best of the domestic styles I've had yet. Quenching, fairly alcoholic, and highly drinkable. I hope this becomes a staple for Victory as far as bottles go."
"Overall: I managed a draft sample of both the St. Boisterous and St. Victorious during my first ever visit to the Victory Brewery tap, almost two years to the day on 29th May 2004. It was great back then and it still is, nice to see it in bottles. A Victory-V Salute to BigHuge for the permanent loan of this marvelous brew."
"Remarkably well-done! Exceptional! This one's not to be missed, especially for fans of the helles bock style because it rivals the best from Germany!"
"from the bottle that I got in a trade. poured a golden honey with a off white head that left no lacing. aroma, metallic, citrus (lemon/orange), hops, caramel, honey. flavor a malty sweetness, hops, honey, fruity. like the nice smooth mouthfeel on this beer"
"I enjoyed it, a good introduction to Maibock/Helles Bock for me, and I'll be back for more. Kudos to the guys a Norm's in Vienna for recommending it."
"Poured a translucent, medium-orange color with a subtle yellow undertone. A soft white head quickly developed and disparted just as quickly. Only a touch of lacing was left behind on my goblet. Aromas of honey, grains, fresh fruit, and flowers seemed to come out. The taste was crisp with sweet malt flavors dominating the front end of each sip. A bitter finish that was slightly floral rounded out the beer. A grain-like texture, somewhat chewy and very easy to drink. A great blend of sweet flavors like honey and slow roasted sugars with citrus-like hop bitterness. Another great beer from Victory."
"Mmmm...delicious Maibock."
"This beer poured a deep gold with some hints of orange, it is very clear with a small white head. Sweet malts on the nose, not much else. It has a sweet / rich malt flavor and a bit of spiciness not much contribution from the hops. Medium mouthfeel, clean crisp finish, very smooth and drinkable. Overall very good, the last time I had it (three years ago) there was a bit more floral hop smell and flavor."
"This stuff is potent and smooth, so be careful. It finishes very nicely. I can't complain or find too much fault with this one."
"I'm glad that Minnesota has started to get more of the Victory seasonal offerings. St. Boisterous didn't let me down, it is a quality maibock."
"I could drink this all night and well into the morning and probably for breakfast. This is excellent, well-balanced, clean, really nice. This is what I love about beer."
"What an incredible maibock...perhaps the best I have had....highly recommended...better than Capital in my opinion..."
"It smelt of apple trees with a hint of hops. It tasted like a cider but I could relate it too taking dainty nibbles of a freshly picked apple. On the exhale there was a hint of celery salt. As I took a sip it felt fun and bubbly in my mouth all the way down. Over all, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall- not s good one. watery with little flavor other than a metallic taste. Victory usually does so much better than this."
"This ones a little heavy, but freakin delicious!"
"Drinkability: What's not to like, it is a big peppery beer, well hopped, enjoyable and highly drinkable. Worth picking up a 6, for sure."
"Cloudy light orange and some yeast in aroma. Hoppy, citrus oil.Well malted, carmel and vanilla, but balanced. Fine mix, nothing objectionable. Medium plus mouthfeel from malt and a honeyish yeast. Refreshing.I Like the brewery, but this one isn't as exciting."
"Like I said, the drinkability is exceptional. I kept wanting more and it snuck up on me. Oh well, I will just have to go get some more."
"Poured a bright golen color with massive white puffy head that fell to a thin coating with sparse lacing. Smell is sweetish, almost honey-like, with nice nice ripe fruit essences also present. Taste is superb, with a strong malt character and a minimum of hops found. Nice full creamy mouthfeel. Too good a drinkability for a 7.4% beer. Excellent beer."
"drinkability: for a strong beer, it is decently drinkable"
"A solid maibock, and nice to drink. The sweetness could be toned down a bit."
"Drinkability: Maibock is a spring beer and May 1 is Monday, glad I bought a sixer."
"This beer pours a clear shimmering golden color. The head is massive, and receds slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is grassy, grainy, but with a nice fruity background. The taste is a perfect balance between grassy and fruity, and is midly sweet overall. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of the best maibocks I have had to date. I will certainly drink this again whenever I get the chance."
"Golden color. Slight, bubbly ivory white head. Lace is adequate. Very nice aroma. Great blend of rich malts and leafy hops. This maibock has got some character. It's quite clean, but abundant with flavor. Thick malts lay down the backbone. Bready yet rich. Hops add just a touch of floral attributes. Malts are rich. This one is really drinkable. This one is right up there with Capital and Town Hall as one of my favorite maibocks."
"Clear, deep gold colour. My pint was poured with a thin whisp of head that disappeared rather quickly. Rich, toasted malt aroma with fresh apple character. Very nice. Malty sweet with toasted malts and a caramel apple component. It had a lingering, light bitterness with a hint of hop flavour. There was a noticeable acidic bite from the carbonation in the finish, as well as a light, spicy, alcohol warmth. Carbonation was just on the high side, made up of large, fizzy bubbles. Decent body. Quite smooth once the carbonation settled a bit. A good beer and quite quaffable."
"Drinkabililty: this is no means a session brew, but the glass I had went down smooth and rather quickly. Could have easily had another, but there were other interesting things on tap I wanted to try. Great beer for springtime in the mid-atlantic."
"Clear bright gold appearance, head is fairly minimal and is essentially gone after 45 seconds or so. A couple of strings for lacing. A little bit of sweetness in the aroma, much more of a slightly bitter apple core and slushy cinnamon sweetend apple sauce that plays very well. Body is heavier, carbonation is at the low end of the spectrum. Taste is quite malty, viscous with an almost maple syrup sweetness. Hops give a slightly leafy and peppery counterpoint (I kind of like them to pop more in this style), and nicely emphasized in the second half of the flavor profile. Toasted malt impression gets stronger on warming and lingers well into the aftertaste. A slightly too thick brew, nice balance and a pleasant rendition of a strong Helles Bock."
"A pale, bright, orange color with virtually no head. The aroma has some nice floral notes and honey, and something that reminds me of leather?? Honey is first in the flavor, followed by a light hop bitterness. Also seems to be a slight spice to this along with some cereal-like malt sweetness. Medium bodies, slightly dry. It would be pretty easy to knock back a few of these enjoyable beers."
"Had this on tap at the Blind Tiger. Munich Gold when served, it came toped with a low head. I thought the aroma was spot on, really authentic German bier aroma. Medium mouthfeel. There is some initial sweetness, but then some nice thick malts make an appearance. Needless to say, I had more than one."
"Very drinkable."
"This was another beer with a thin white head that just seemed to evaporate upon contact with the air. It was a crystal-clear golden-yellow with just a wisp of a head remaining. It had a huge, malty nose. My notes at this point have the remark, ""Now, we're gettin' somewhere."" There was a good sweet/malty taste in the mouth and the finish was also sweet, but it reminded me of hay or silage (you'd have to be a farmer or spent time around a farm). There was a mild, lingering bitterness in the mouth as the beer warmed. The longer I went, the more I got a strong flavor of honey. It was a decent beer, but the ABV and the sweetness make it one that two would probably be plenty."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is decent, with moderate carbonation. This has a rather viscous body, but doesn't cloy. It's easy to drink, although the sheer bulk might keep you from having too many. Still, it's a really nice beer with which to shake off the winter and embrace the spring."
"Beer is very nice and refreshing. I kinda wish I had let it chill longer as I think it is prob even better colder. Another nice brew from the guys in Downingtown!"
"I'll have to try another soon to see if the carbonation thing was a fluke or not."
"If you, like I do, enjoy different sensations of taste throught a beer, give this a try."
"another winner from v."
"Crystal clear golden yellow with a smallish pillowy white head. Head retention is poor but leaves a light scattering of lace. Light malt sweetness in the aroma with light fruit notes and a few other things going on. Some bready notes as well. Flavor is sweet and bready with some apple notes. Light hoppiness rounds this one out nicely. Crisp and refreshing going down. This stuff is very easy drinking and perfect for the warm weather. Thanks goes to Ben for the bottles of this."
"Crystal, clear and golden. Just a film of white head. Bubbles trickling slowly upward. Smelled purely of German malts and sweet bread. Hints of spiced apples. Spicy up front with a sweet bready, malt backbone. Some juicy apple flavors in there too. Dries the mouth slightly and then finishes bitter and just warms the tongue. Medium-bodied and smooth, tingly on the tongue and a bit airy. No doubt, a tasty and refreshing easy drink."
"The aroma didn't promise much, but the flavor came through in spite of that, in a classic underpromise/overdeliver maneuver. The malt cames through grandly on the palate, but never goes too sweet, and the hops, while more of an eldritch than anything substantial, lend the crisp bittering air that makes it such a pleasure to drink. And for sure, the ABV is very well-camoflaged, so care is to be taken, lest one too many put you on your back. And I'd just as soon be conscious when drinking this."
"Drinkability is fairly hgh allow aggressive interviewng and a late spring cold have made me miserable."
"Mouthfeel is about the same. Would be interested in trying this beer bottle conditioned - would no doubt give a less bubbly mouthfeel and improved head retention. An extremely drinkable beer - one has to exercise caution when approaching this beer. Nothing significantly unique - but relatively true to style, method, and approach. A good spring celebration beer!"
"Finger licking good!"
"Drinkability and Overall: A good beer, but not overly great. It's incredibly pilsener like. I enjoyed the fact that it was crisp and clean (thanks to Victory's new brewing system I assume). A good spring beer."
"Clear golden pour with a thick head that disappeared but a constant stream of bubbles percolating through. Smell is of candied fruit and malt. The taste is fantastic. Malty without being cloyingly sweet, with faint traces of toasted grain in the backgroun. The hop character is just barely there, enough to make its presence felt and reinforce the maltiness. There is an almost peppery little bite that comes through with the alcohol, but the creamy mouthfeel ties everything back together really well. Overall, a fantastic beer (does Victory make any other kind) that I am excited to have easy access to this spring."
"D&N: Oh good heavens, this beer is just about perfect. The smells and the tastes are phenomenal, very easy to drink, a perfect beer to come home to after working the night shift and wanting to relax with. Highly recommended."
"I'm more impressed with Victory all the time. It's probably my favorite brewery and I haven't yet made the trip to Downingtown. I need to definately do that soon."
"I'm 6'3"" tall and weigh close to 300# and two of these do me in. Wow."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Sampled on tap at the brewpub. Pours a bright, clear gold with a refreshing floral nose that includes hints of candy & fresh hops. Full in the mouth as a great mix of spicy hops & pale malts fill your mouth full of sweet melons, toffee, earthy minerals, & appealing floral hints. Slippery, full mouthfeel with a bright & almost herbal hop finish. Damn fine lager."
"A very good maibock. Spot on to style like all of Victory's lagers."
"Light amber in color, the head was on the small side. While unimpressive in the appearance, it was a surprise after that with a crisp orange flower aroma and a refreshing citrus flavor. Theres a light bitter finish that helps make this an excellent maibock."
"Since being back in SE PA, this has been one of my favorites. Really a nicely done bock that isn't overpowering. Very nice looking beer with a nice head even after 2 hours in a growler. Nice munich malt caramel notes in the nose. The taste is very nice following the nose with some just right caramel munich flavors. I figure they're munich flavors, maybe some vienna malts as well. I also get some hops in the finish. I think they're hops. Just a bit bitter at the end. I like it. Pretty decent mouthfeel, nothing super. Very drinkable, even at >7%abv."
"Pours a clear amber copper with a peach colored fluffy head. The lacing is sparse down the side of the glass. The aroma is full of sweets, malt, slighlty floral hops, a breadiness, yeast and a touch of fruit notes. The taste is sweet toasted malts, very light fruit overtones and a short quick finish of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, full and rich; a little sticky and the warming hint of alcohol comes out near the end on the palate. The balance and smooth character make this beer extremely drinkable and a really nice spring seasonal. Overall, I prefer hefe's, wits and pilsner's around this time of year (been averaging 80 degree's plus)but this is a perfect choice to have one tap when spring is heading fast into summer. Delicious."
"Overall another nice brew from the folks at Victory. A nice balance and complexity for a Helles Bock IMHO."
"Nice looking beer. Amber colored, with a pure white head that settles to a thin layer, mostly on the edges and a little puddle in the middle of the glass. Not much of an aroma, but is there is pleasant. Slightly sweet and grainy. Very tasty. Chunky, but balanced. Feels creamy in the mouth. Complex, so it keep you interested and entertained."
"Anytime I see a Victory product on tap I have to try it, they just are always a wonderful balanced representation of their style this maibock definitely delivers for me. Pours amber mild brown with an off white peach colored head. A nice trickled lace forms as the head begins to dwindle. Aroma is full of malt balanced by slighlty floral hops, a breadiness possibly from the yeast, and a touch of plum notes comes through to form one amazing beer aroma. Taste is very nice mellow balanced flavor primarily consists of malt sweet tones with an underlying fruit tone and hop profile tip toeing on my palate followed by a warming rush of aclohol that is not too overbearing just need to give this beer a little kick. Mouthfeel is slightly stickywith a tickling carbonation from this well-consructed medium bodied Victory classic. Drinkability nice spring/summer seasonal that I was pleased to find on tap very nice beer that plan to visit revisit hopefully in Downington."
"I have tried to brew this and related styles, and they are picky. This one definitely deserves a second look-see when I find it again."

"Draught @ Victory. This one pours a absolutely clear golden color. There was very little white head on it. The nose was somewhat malty and also had a slight grassiness to it. The taste is a bit of a malty biscuity taste, and was slightly sweet. The medium body belies its 7.4% alcohol. Very Good!"
"Fruity sweet nose (yeasty). Rose' color with a yellow tint. Sweet taste with some floral notes in the finish (hop). Sweet biscut malt taste in dominant. Medium mouth with lively little bubble action on the tongue. Solid and quite drinkable. Had this at the 4/5 BA event and thanks to the BA's at lunch for the reccomendation... it went well with the pizza!"
"Prost!"
"This beer came to me a crystal clear, nicely carbonated and medium to dark straw colored. The head was white in color and seemed dense and light in nature. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly simple sweet malt, flowers, very light fruit, and some bitter hops. The flavors of the Saint were less simple then the nose. Some hops took the front – bitter, and floral hops – light caramel, great malt, some very light fruit, and a tad alcohol seemed to be present as well. A good balance of malt and hops that seemed to keep each other in balance, with the malt slightly more aggressive which left it with a moderate sweet appeal to it. Medium bodied and good malt balance make this beer pleasant to drink."
"very good maibock that changes form year to year with varying malts and hops. Sometimes dry other times sweeter, 7.4% alcohol is not noticeable at all and is a fairly smooth maibock. The draft version is usually all that is available anymore some years they bottle it and some they will bottle something different. A must try for maltheads as the malt usually dominates if slightly over the hops."
"Be forewarned, it's hard to find the brewery - in an industrial complex and you cannot see at all it if coming in from the west."
