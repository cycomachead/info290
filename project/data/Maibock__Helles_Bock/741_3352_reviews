"Overall as expected for the style it's a big malty beer with an easy drinking helles lager body. I got what I paid for."
""
""
"Overall, not very enjoyable and would not likely purchase again. It's light (easy to drink) for the high octane, if you're into that."
"Other than being a bit boozy, it seems fairly true to style. Decent."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2/10/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of orange zest, plum, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, plum, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, plum, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Maibock style. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: This is a OK beer to drink. The higher alcohol content seems to reduce the drinkabilty of the beer."

"a passable but incomplete maibock for me, i am left wanting for more carbonation and a quicker finishing experience, not as spring feeling as the style usually delivers either. caramel colored beer, rather still after a minute, sits lazily in a white wine glass. the nose is sweet from the grain, but a little stale too, not as fresh as it might be. no hops to speak of, and a lager yeast i have seen before. the flavor is a bit one dimensional for me, coppery caramel toffee flavor from the grain, and thats it. no german interest, no balancing hops, not even a drying bready yeast profile to wrap it up. not bad at all, devoid of off flavors or weirdness, but not as interesting or as tradition as i like these to be. the body is big enough for sure, but more bubbles would really help this out. one bottle is enough, especially given the only sort of disguised alcohol strength. not bad, but i wont miss not having it in my fridge anymore."

"O- About average brew. It's not a super easy drinker though."
""
""
""
""
""

"A rather rich maibock with emphasis on the malt components. Fairly sugary with a decent hop presence to counterbalance things. The alcohol presence is there but fairly subdued. Overall, it looks and smells decent enough, but I think the flavors are a little over-the-top and slightly out of whack as far as balance goes. Would I have another one? Sure. But I would be open to checking out other options if available."
""

""

"Brief review, and probably not a very accurate one (I was already three deep on an empty stomach), but I feel my ratings probably aren't very far off. Not necessarily something I'd seek out again, but definitely something I'd try again."
"Overall- despite how my description sounds it is not a terrible beer. I think I may have just got an older bottle of it. The nose is great, I am used to a darker Maibock though. The hops clean up nice in the finish I think the slight medicine taste probably comes from a higher alcohol content, which isn't a bad thing in the slightest. I would order another but only in the tasting room."
""
"Mild & light, refreshing. I could see myself drinking on a hot summer day on the lake, but I give it an overall average. I would reccomend to anyone who likes a lighter beer, or if you are looking to cool off. 7% abv, its a good way to get the old lady hammered too. Idk hard to come up with enough characters for average brews."
"O: A good, quaffable maibock. The alcohol profile in the taste is a bit high, but it doesn't detract too much from the overall taste. Not a bad way to go for $7.99 for a 6-er. I love maibocks and Lakefront Brewing. When these two come together, the result is quite good."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better maibocks I've had, it's clean character sets it apart. Very much worth a pickup."
""
""
""
"Pours a lightly hazy amber with a good sized but fragile off-white head. Slighty sweet, despite a generous-for-style hop load, and slightly boozy, as expected for style. Medium body with crisp carbonation. Well done but not one of my favorite styles."
""
"I dunno, this beer definitely had its fan in Milwaukee, but usually they weren't the types into good beer, or at least not hoppy beer."
""
"O - Big Easy Imperial Maibock lives up to it's name, piling more malt into an already malty beer. Wonderful nuances of clover honey and floral hops parade around quietly behind the deep malty base. It's sweetness makes it harder to drink more than one of but this spring-time beer offers a nice look ahead to the warmer days while subtly warming you up on the cooler ones."
""
""
"Unique beer here, lots of different things going on. Despite the spices, it doesn't taste like a ""holiday"" beer, and it remains very drinkable. The alcohol warms and adds rather than overpower and distract. Solid choice here, I'd be glad to have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All right, but lacking that little something extra for me."
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a 1/2 inch foamy orange-tan head that settles to thin streaks of lace on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and some citrus aromas. Taste is of sweet malt and some light citrus fruit flavors. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but very simple in its aromas and flavors."
"This one was disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is alright. Rich enough that it would be rare to do more than one in a session - also don't drive if you do. However, don't turn it down if offered."
""
"Had trouble finishing the entire beer. Smells fine and drinks okay if it weren't for the flavor. Will probably have to try it again to assure that age or some other factor wasn't effecting my enjoyment."
""
"A keep em coming type beer."
""
""
"O - Interesting beer. Definitely malty and sweet. Not my usual style of beer, but nice for a change up"
""
"I'm not saying that the weird flavor is all bad, but it certainly is different from anything else I've tried. You'll have to judge for yourself whether you like it or not. Certainly an interesting beer if nothing else."
"Overall: a little too sweet for my tastes. Not at all boozy. Smooth and easy to drink "
""
""
"Overall – extremely interesting beer in terms of taste."
"O - not a bad beer, but not one that is of my liking either. not much there in complexity or taste aside from malts."
"overall: This is a beer I would absolutely have loved a few short years ago. Still a nice brew but with the explosion of truly great beers, gotta grade this on a curve. Liked it, not loved it."
""
"O) Paired this with hot buffalo wings and some dry rub jerk wings. It went quite well. Another solid effort from Lakefront. I would recommend giving it a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: On the whole, this isn't a bad beer, but it certainly doesn't separate itself from the rest of the herd."
"I'm not quite catching the ""imperial"" aspect, other than a high abv which is only slightly noticeable. Otherwise, it's nicely done and one to buy for a Mardis Gras or Carnival party!"
""
""
""
""
"There's too much alcohol in here by just a slight margin. It doesn't detract from the taste, but it gives the impression that this beer is more along the lines of a Dopplebock or a Belgian-style beer. While this won't blow anyone away, there's enough here to satisfy most beer drinkers since this is well-balanced and flavorful enough to casually enjoy."
"This one pours a orange-amber color with a tiny head that doesn't retain well. Not much lacing. Aroma is mostly bready malts, with some grains, and a touch of alcohol. The taste is grainy, sweet malts with some citrus and a huge alcohol kick on the backend. The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied, and the drinkability is decent. Overall, an alright beer, but probably more enjoyable a bit closer to the bottling date."
"O- Overall, not a bad brew but probably not something I would purchase again."
"So, lesson reinforced. Maibocks, best consumed fresh."
"O: A nice beer, quite different from others of this style. Will buy again, the flavor really does it for me. First beer I've had from Lakefront-- looking forward to trying others from them."
"I think Colts got a very old bottle for his review."
"drinkability is ok - i will drink the entire sixer and i hope there is more carbonation in the other bottles - if not i doubt i would buy this again - i would move on to capital's maibock"
"The mouthfeel is medium and not harsh or astringent. But, overall, this beer is too sweet for me to enjoy regularly."
"This was a refreshing beer that went down easy."
"GOOD, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"It's a slightly hazy orange with a 1/2 finger of foam that disappears quickly. The aroma has a hint of citrus but there isn't much there. The taste I really enjoyed, an almost even hop/malt mix with some orange and flowers. It goes down fairly smooth leaving a sweet aftertaste. Even at 7.1 abv you don't notice the alcohol that much. This is definitely one of the better beers from Milwaukee. I'd have it again."
"Creamy in body... Normally dry from my past experiences. A good beer but not what I'd expect from a beer designated to be in this genre of beer."
"Drinkability -- Ehhh, don't care for it. Too thick and syrupy and with too much unrestrained malt sweetness. Your mileage may vary."
"Is it Mardis Gras time already? Alright. This seemingly appropriately-themed brew pours a lightly hazy golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises caramel, maple syrup, and a slight tinge of orange peel. The taste holds notes of grass, caramel, and buttery biscuits. These do not go well together, let me tell you. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. Overall, a decent maibock, but not really something I'm gonna look for again."
"A brew with short life expectancy. If you can get a fresh bottle or on tap at the brewery, you wont be disappointed."
"D) A slow drinker even though it is at 7%. I don't think I'd have a consecutive one."
" A pretty straightforward Maibock. I enjoyed the way they pulled back on the sweetness, a welcome change from the average maibock. Crisp, a little fruity, some caramel malts mid-palate. A delicate, lingering honey finish. I could easily drink a 6-pack of this, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"The body is crisp and popping. Moderate depth. Goes down smooth. This is a pretty sweet Maibock. Candy-like sweetness at the onset with some tart fruitiness. Low-to-moderate amount of bitterness. Light alcohol on the back end. There's a pleasant bready aftertaste, that I find in many Maibocks. I like that. All-in-all, not a bad beer. Not the greatest representation of the style, but I'd have it again."
"(D)- A solid maibock that, even with a touch of aging on it is a good drinker. Sweet, but fitting for the style. Great for the spring time, or anytime! One of lakefront's best in my opinion."
"BTW I am a huge fan of Lakefront's Eastside Dark and Cream City Pale Ale."
"D - This is a nice ""imperial"" maibock."
"Overall a decent drinkable beer. For me all these light german styles tend to just blend together. Nothing all that memorable."
"Not bad to drink, but much better alternatives are out there. I like the other LB's I've tried, but this one missed the mark."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of malts with a bit of sweetness and some hops. Tastes of hops with a degree of sweetness to it. Feels medium bodied in the mouth. Drinkability is decent. Overall not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of tart malt, sweet malt, brown sugar, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, lemon, sweet malt, and tart malt. Overall, too acidic for my taste."
"Dark gold with a a white foam head and very small but very active bubbles of prickle. Classic beer nose. Grainy flavor that has straw and raw wheat-like flavors that cause me to recall Bitburger (which I didn't care for). It is more mild than the aforementioned German brew. It seems to be very mainstream. I was a little disappointed as it was kind of a clunker for Lakefront in my opinion. I had a hard time getting through the six pack. . . I just didn't prefer it to other things."
"Drinkability: Well, to be honest, it was actually better than expected. It's smooth, it's sweet, it's Mardi Gras-approved!"
"Pours orangy golden with a great torrent of carbonation, but no lacing to speak of. The aroma is grainy and crisp, with a light noble hop floral sweetness. The flavor is sweet, with a bit of orange and clover, a slight hint of honey, and a fairly crisp hop bite on the finish and some bitterness on the back end. The mouthfeel is clingy and surprisingly robust."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is beer with some flavor and some substance that is worth drinking for a while."
"Big Easy Imperial Maibock pours a nice copper with a bit of haze. The head is bubbly but fades immediately. The aroma is sweet grainy malt and a hint of herbal hops. The flavor is crisp sweet light malt with a nice mild caramel twinge. Just enough spicy and herbal hops balance and mild but assertive bitterness. I'm not sure where the term ""Imperial"" fits into this beer, but it is good none the less."
"So much carbonation, this is absurd. Pours with almost no head. Nose has lots of malt odor in it. Taste is a little sweet up front and this quickly fades to a much heavier malt profile. Overall not a bad beer, very carbonated and a good purchase. Much better than I was expecting."
"I wish I Could like this more. The brewery makes some fine beers, this one is kinda Blah."
"[Personal Recommendation]: Hey this isn't my fav but give her a try, I think you'll like what you find."
"Buttery heavy mouthfeel, big on the pallet, great session beer other than the abv probably around 7-8%. Nice all around the year type beer, great for summer refreshing, heavy enough for the winter. One of the best I've had from these Lakefront guys. Keep a look out. Well done."
"So we're left with this: if you can find it, find it. Then drink some."
"Drinkability: I don't really get this beer - why not just call it an ordinary maibock? - but it is pretty good. Just don't expect anything exceptional."
"Overall definatly a thirst quencher."
"This just might be Lakefront's best beer to date, and a damn tasty Maibock to boot."
"Appearance: The color golden to a tint of orange. There is no head. The nose is a sweet malt with hints of yeast and hops. The taste blew me a way. Too me it seem like a cross between a Coors and Budweiser. The finish was clean. It is an easy beer to drink ."
"This Lager beer from Wisconsin was a slightly hazy amber color upon pouring with a thin tan head. The retention as a skim was pretty good and the lacing respectable. The aroma was a nice, soft blend of lager-ish malt, and some generic hops. The flavors were also well-balanced, a pleasant sweetness of caramel malt first hit my tongue that was soon met by some piney hops that led to a bitter, crisp finish. The body was medium/light and the carbonation very soft. Totally sessionable, well-balanced and well flavored. For something I picked up on a whim I was quite impressed."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a small head on a light amber body. Smelled very strongly of a typical lager, with hop sharpness very present. Taste was along the same lines, some sweetness mixed in, but that hop sharpness pretty well covers up anything else. There was a couple other tastes in there that screwed up the experience, a bit skunky perhaps, certainly off putting. Nothing worth jumping for."
"Not a bad beer, not brilliant either. The beer pours a pretty golden clear color with some head that dissipates quickly. Lacing, there isn't any. The smell is very sweet, a little husky, a little tart malt, some citrusy sweetness as well. This is a fairly light bodied beer with a very sweet, perhaps cooked corn tastes, with a citrusy backbone. This beer is just too sweet, and gets worse as it settles. There clearly is a citrus like sweetness here - green apple, maybe - with a tad bit of sourishness in the late finish. The carbonation is modest. The aftertaste does linger more than I would like. It's okay, but not great."
"D - This is a weird one, not at all what I would expect from something called big easy lager beer. There is a surprising amount of yeasty fruit character for a lager and it doesn't have enough malt character for a maibock. Nevertheless, I rather like it; it is kind of like a cross between a german pilsner and a saison, pretty drinkable really."
"would drink this one again"
"Mouthfeel is appropriately crisp although I don't love the long aftertaste that feels slightly slick. A fairly average offering from Lakefront."
"Drinkability: My first Lakefront beer. I picked it cause I thought the bottle looked cool. The beer is average. An easy drinking beer that is probably sessionable. Worth trying once."
"I'm reminded of a Kolsch when tasting this. The skunkiness is much less noticeable. Light malt flavor, slightly sour, little hop. Creamy body."
"drinkability is decent. with the style in mind, this is an average maibock. could use a bit more lagering to smooth out the profile. not the best offering from Lakefront."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not a good one either. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you are a tart beer fan."
"Overall, a mediocre and rather boring attempt at a maibock. Not awful nor undrinkable, but unfortunately that's about the best compliment I can give it."
"Pours a pale orange-ish color with a white head. Aromas of a European malt sweetness. In the taste, malty and a bit sweet, clean but not as refreshing as hoped. It leaves an aftertaste of a sweet maltiness, and a small bit of citrus. It feels big in alcohol for a lager, as well as, darker than anticipated, but a nice beer."
"Great beer for a hot summer afternoon."
"Not to my taste. Leans more towards a malt liquor than a lager. Future travel plans will not include the Big Easy."
"This helles bock has a deep gold color with low CO2 and minimal foam stand, likely due to high alcohol. The medium malt aroma belies a huge malt character with notes of apple and pear prior to the malty sweet finish. While the apple/pear detracts this beer is still Lakefront's top dog."
"Assuming that the style is listed correctly, this was not a very good Maibock/Helles. Quite off of the norm for the style."
"Originally reviewed May 10, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Slightly cloudy rose-orange pour, lacking much carbonation. Head, mostly diminished, is off-white. Aroma of bread crusts and egg whites, with a hint of lacquer and acidic red wine. Rich sugary malt, that blossoms into a lightly hopped caramel sugar, finishing with a touch of cardboard. A little bitter aftertaste. Im thinking light struck. Notes of brandy, fresh white wine, and an off tone or two. Palate is smooth, crisp and fairly clean, except for some residual oily wet paper and vanilla sugar coating."
"""Lager"" isn't really a style, but in the craft brewing world it has taken on a meaning when used as a style descriptor. Most breweries that produce a ""lager"" really mean it to be the lightest of their offerings, so I think that's what many of us expected. This, however, is big and bold and delicious. If you had to pick a style for it, it would probably be a bock. In any event, this is a well crafted substantial beer (even if the name is a bit misleading)."
"Has next to no aroma. A vague ""smell"" but I wouldnt even hazard a guess as to what smell that is. Ok I will..its kinda a vague alcohol enrinched caramel candy smell, but it is very faint. You have to get your nose wet to smell it. The color is a lusterous amber/orange with a diminishing thumb thick white head. Quite pretty coloring. Fore yields caramel malts, more alcohol flavor than youd expect from a 6% beer and some mild spice and yeasty notes toward the finish. Not bad really as American Bocks go."
"Overall impression: Not a bad bock - definitely better than I was expecting from the name."
"12 ounce bottle. Lakefront's Big Easy pours out a mostly clear golden brown color with a small head. Toasted malt aroma. The flavor is very sweet and malty. Some banana and apple flavors. Almost tastes like a hefeweizen. The finish is weak, with very little memorable flavor. Alcohol is well hidden. Medium is a little creamy. Carbonation is very low. This beer could have used some hops. As it stands, it is one-dimensional in flavor. Mediocre at best."
"Though this particular example doesn't fit the style of a MaiBock, I didn't want to slam it too hard. It is a clean beer though it seems to have some age on it. I would try it again...especially closer to the brewery."
"A very fine bock beer."
"12 oz. brown bottle with a lobster on it. mmm....lobster beer. Clear carmel color with a very small head that is fading fast as I type. Rich malt with hints of brown sugar and alcohol, slight coffee. Taste is very malty, both roasted and carmel. The taste is very close to a dopple, with so much rich malt. It could be a Maibock too, I guess. Very slick mouthfeel, only slightly carbonated. I served this at cellar temp and it was very enjoyable. I don't know how the lobster comes into play, and frankly, i prefer not to."
"By the way, my 6-pack came with a lace of beads...does that mean that I have to show my tits?"
"Amber color and clear. Bright white suds on top, but the head never really gathers together. Decent lacing, some nice thick ropes across the glass. Tight aroma, slight banana bread with an adequate hop prickle. Body is on the thick side of medium. Malty and toffee-like, sweetness starts and ends things with this beer. By mid mouth, and certainly by the end of the glass, there's a good amount of buttery diacetyl going on, maybe too much for my tastes in that the hops could be spicier, more assertive, and the brew could be a little more dry for me. The esters from the aroma seem a little lost as well. Lakefront certainly explores the world of Lagers in interesting directions, for this style, its a little cloying."
"pours a nice burnt yellow/orange into my glass... head is quick to go leaving no lace either, small rivulets of carbonation, to bad for the head.. the body looks nice. I now know that the burnt yellow is also included in the nose of this one..soft smell, burnt, and almost sweet. smell is weak.. but lets see if taste overcomes, comes with a tart tongue squisher that has hints of dark oranges, but light and the aftertaste keeps the same appeal. mouthfeel was really limited, not a bad beer but could have earthier tones for a lager ."
"An amber colored brew with no head or lacing I could see. The is real good I could taste brown sugar. Giving it a sweet but not to sweet taste. It was also crisp and fruity tasting of what fruit I could not pinpoint but this is a good bock bear. I would defintley buy this again."
"Clear coppery amber brown with a showcasing of unfiltered floaty things suspended within even as a steady stream of carbonation bubbles rises for a good while, medium ivory head appeared but zipped away pretty darn quick and no lace anywhere. Smell is grassy, husky, toasty, whole grainy, bagel dough sweetness resides lightly underneath. Flavors are nice, refined whole grain richness that has a toasty breadishness and buttery notions, not overly sweet or cloying in the malts, very solid malt display with some grassy openness floating around and a delicate dryness. Feel is significantly bold and malty rich, creamy, yet favorably carbonated and full of good zip. One of the better Pale/Blonde Bocks I've had, subtle, rich, and pretty flavorful and drinkable with nearly no alcohol traces except for what effects it has on the noggin after a couple."
"Nice, tasty, great for a pint, but a twelve pack would be over the top."
"563"
"A creamy white head rests lazily atop a hazy (bottle-conditioned) deep-gold body. Hundreds of tiny bubbles stream steadily upwards, helping to maintain a thin surface covering throughout the glass. The lacing is limited, but generous notes of rich, toasty and lightly husky Munich malt waft towards the nose. The body is firm, and the fine carbonation leaves it creamy in the mouth with a light sensation on the tongue. All of the rich maltiness displayed in the aroma is carried over in the flavor. It's rich without being sweet or cloying; and it's quite clean except for the fact that the straight-forward maltiness has a bit of a husky, hay-like character. Still, I enjoyed it and didn't see it as a negative. In fact, it lends some character to the beer and reminds the drinker that beer is an agricultural product (and in this case, from the epicenter of the grain belt... Milwaukee) - not something generically created and pumped into shiny metal cans in a sterile industrial setting (although that is sometimes true as well!). The alcohol is very well hidden, and never makes an appearance. I'm not sure how strong this beer is, but it's definitely within the Bock range. It finishes with a wash of sweetish and grainy malt across the mouth, but it's so deftly balanced that it simply fades away without the bitterness ever making an appearance. Very nice! There's some real finesse going on here! However, I can't figure out the name! Maybe there's some local connection that I don't get, but why is a beer from Milwaukee named ""Big Easy Lager Beer"" with a lobster in a Mardis Gras mask on the label? The only thing that I can think of is that it's a big malty beer that goes down easy... real easy! Quite enjoyable, and worth trying."
"Copper-orange appearance. Very little head. A thin rimming. Adequate lacing. A very delicate pils like malt aroma. Some noble hop scents please the nose as well. The maltiness in this Blonde Dopple is not overwhelming, but rather firm. The flavor is very pleasant and unassuming. Floral hop tones accent the luscious soft maltiness. Very nice. The body is hovering around weak. You know, I think I pick up some very subtle fruity tones. Not necessarily what you look for in a dopple, but they aren't out of place in this one. Especially at the trace levels that they are perceived."
"Dark golden in color..great clarity and clean looking...pours a frothy creamy head that is gone in seconds..sweet creamy aroma with some alcohol present....incredible taste...one of the best tasting beers I've had. Vanilla, butterscotch...heavy malt load...Maybe too unbalanced for some as I get zero hop taste...Very sweet, but to me it's not oversweet so there must be some hopping. Their web-site calls this a blonde doppelbock...Tastes like it but not as hopped up as some of the other blonde doppels I've had. If you're getting picking maybe a tich syruppy but I'm reaching for something here..One of my favorite beers ever (and I'm finishing off my last of three and may not see it again for a long time..)"
"Needs more heft, more malt depth, and more smoothness."
"This is a perfect beer to pair with food. I've had it with homemade andouille sausage chili. I would guess that this would also be good with any other Cajun dishes such as jambalaya, gumbo or any other hot (spicy) foods."
