4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Very clean in flavor as well with very low yeast ester presence. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice maibock style. All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

Full aroma of bready and caramel malt, light grassy hops and  hint of skunk. Flavor follow aroma, rich caramel and bready malt with syrupy toffee and earthy, grassy hops. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess. A full bodied maibock with lots of good, sweet malt flavor and a good touch of hops in the finish. There are hints of skunkiness and a touch of oxidation; this green bottle may have been sitting around a while before sale, but still very tasty and satisfying. Looks and tastes good, I will watch for this again.","LiquidAmber","Oct 24, 2014"

The nose brings some light, grainy malt plus a very faint amount of herbal hops. Some light breadiness in the background.

Taste was malty sweet and the caramel is much more pronounced - very consistent with the nose.

A wet, grassy smell with hints of smoked veggie and some floral notes. Dryness and floral hops settle in with a citric hop taste yet there are also sweet malt notes like caramel and other sugariness that ride right along with it.

I don't find the alcohol taste so overwhelming but it does affect its drinkability in that it already has such a pronounced, sticky sweet malt presence and then you realize just how much alcohol you're ingesting as well.

A flash of balancing hop bitterness hits the tongue first, but it is quickly overtaken by the malts, which somehow maintain the balancing act of tasting sweet and feeling dry at the same time.

Flavor starts off wonderfully bready with dried and fresh fruits abounding along with some almonds. Not overly sweet and actually starts to dry up a tad in the end.

The 6.5% alcohol is unnoticeable at first, but becomes more apparent as the beer warms.

Some hops of the citrus variety came through rather faintly. The taste was sweet at the start, but less so than the aroma would lead you to expect. As you hold the beer, you get alcohol/phenol/medicine taste in the middle. Sprinkled throughout are notes of toast, not quite burnt. The finish brings the hops (gently) and a slight pepper taste. Body was medium, as was the carbonation. The finish was drying, almost to the point of being astringent and there was some alcohol warming going on.

This means that the alcohol dominates, but the malts and hops are evident too. Colour is deep golden / amber, large white head.

This is an odd taste, but I like the idea. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation and a bit of warmth. This is a solid beer. It has real malt character and a style all it's own; a good drinker.","WesWes","Mar 18, 2005"
4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Very clear gold to amber colored beer with a thin white head that settled quickly in the beer. The aroma has a strong crisp hop character (Hallertau?) with a backbone of malt. The malt lends a toffee character to the nose. Very crisp taste caught on the tip of the tongue. Definitely lager style hops lend this to the flavor. A richness and a delicate sweetness follows. This is certainly a crisp Maibock. Nice lace left down the glass as I sip the beer. Very good balance of crisp lager character and bock sweetness. As you would expect, a very taught mouth feel. Good drinkability.","carln26","Jan 12, 2005"

Had this one at 'bones last evening, and it was yummy (heard we weren't supposed to use that adjective, so get ready to see it a lot from now on). The color was Munich amber (go look, see what that could be), topped with a frothy tan head (nice pour!). I even had rings of lace left through-out my glass. The light, brown bready aroma was pleasant. Tingly carbonation was the initial impression, and the malt was slightly sweet, which was nicely kept in check by the crispness of the carbonation. No real bitterness to speak of, but again: no syrupy notes detected either. Spot on, and a bit dangerous for me having three. Very very good.","PatandDavid","Oct 06, 2004"

The head is very rocky as well, a good sign. The aroma is a nice solid malt, almost candy like, with a faint hint of hops. This one has a touch of skunkiness - its in a green bottle, I still don't understand why they do that. Anyway it isn't too bad so I rush in and take a sip. I get a full, strong maltiness that is balanced with a touch of hop flavor and a good bitterness to keep the malty sweetness in check. I get a slight hint of caramel as well but that's pretty much it. The beer alcohol level (6.5% by volume) seems pretty well hidden. Awesome!","KroMagnon","Sep 20, 2004"

Smelled a little bit light struck, but there was a sweet malty aroma as well. Very sweet on the initial taste, but a little bit of spice is present as the brew warms to room temp. A little bit of alcohol is noticable. Mouthfeel is a little sticky. Not a bad beer, just not the best I've ever had.

The flavor began with a noble hop bitterness which was completly covered up with malt flavor soon after. A clean dry light malt flavor is the predominent character of this beer's flavor. The finish is full of lingering hop bitterness that reminds one of a fien German Pils. Body is medium wieh a bit of a carbonic bite. Overall I was not impressed with this brew as it seemed more like an out of balance Pils that a smooth Bock. A bit too much hop for rhe style and too light on the malt flavors as well. It is hard to criticize this beer, as Einbeck is wherer the Bock style originated but I believe that this beer is not a perfect pale bock.","RenoZymurgist","Aug 02, 2004"

Chewy in texture, it is perhaps a tad syrupy, and somewhat cloying, but a very distinct hop bitter is on hand throughout and evens things out to some degree. The beer went very well with homeade pretzels. On its own, without food though, this is a beer that I'll be happy with just one.","moulefrite","May 11, 2004"

Taste is more of the same with a mild subdued presense of pale sweetness, lightly breadish, a bit of an acute bittering with a slight herbalness to its hops. Pleasingly mild taste. Feel is about medium bodied with a light frothy texture and finish that ends a bit dry. A reserved in pale sweetness overall with this Mai-bock makes it a bit bland but its actully quite tasty and becomes better as it warms where some of the breadish tones float in more.","tavernjef","Feb 11, 2004"

I had to keep looking at it and holding it to different lights and upgrading my initial appearance rating. The taste is extremely complex, that too required a raise in points. The ample malt body never achieves a platform of its own. It instead plays a wonderful supporting role to the competing stars. The off white heads performance is marvelous, though brief. Einbecker, by the way, is the inventor of the bock style.

The aroma is solidly malty, balanced by a grassy hoppiness. (Also lightly skunky - green bottle!) The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Obviously a full bodied beer! The flavor starts with a solid maltiness - lightly sweet and caramel tinged - which becomes increasingly bitter as it crosses the palate, ending with dry (and unfortunately metallic flavor from oxidation) finish. Obviously an excellent beer, but a damaged bottle. I've had this beer before and remember it without defect. It's a solid one-two punch of malt and hop that expresses itself in slightly different ways throughout the glass (probably because as the malt sugars build in your mouth they retain the bitterness of the hops). And therefore, although it is not complex per se, it is a very interesting and enjoyable beer that keeps your attention.","NeroFiddled","Aug 14, 2002"
