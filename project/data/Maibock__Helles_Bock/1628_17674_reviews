"strong amber color with a nice head of white that reached a height of around an inch and half before settling back down to earth and leaving just thin lacing in its wake, but for the style nice and a classic look. aroma of sweet bready malts and a classic caramel aroma that was cut with a touch of grain. nice and clean with a semi crisp feel"
"O – A nice beer balanced on the sweet side of the spectrum. The mildly syrupy body slows down the drinkability."
"Reviewed on 05/09/2009. I had this on tap at SPH. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet, corny malt, sweet apple, and sorghum. Flavor of pale lager malts up front with a sweet fruity finish. Decent, but palate is a little thin."
"Notes from 6/08/06."
"Drinkability- This would be great by the six pack with less age. I really don't know why Southampton doesn't bottle it in more quantity for the drinking needs."
"Another great sample from Southampton..."
"Notes: Meh."
"Drinkability is far too good for a beverage of this abv. Easy to drink a couple of bombers and then realize you can't walk. A great session beer with a full stomach."
"More toffee / marshmallow flavor evident in the taste, with a nice malty sweetness in tow. Hops are reserved but serve to balance out the flavor nicely. Not overly interesting though. Mouthfeel is medium and well carbonated. A solid maibock from Southampton overall."
"Drinkability: The spicy character of this brew elevates the Maibock style to a different plateau; I wouldn't want to drink a lot of it but I definitely like Southampton's take on the style"
"Pours a lightly murky burned copper hue with a quick one finger off white head that dies down to a layer of thin bubbles. A bit of lacing is left behind on the sides. Smell is of honey and caramel malt with a slight citrus zest. Some bready aromas with a bit of alcohol finding its way in the nose. A spicey pepper up front on the tongue with a warming caramel sweetness. Dry bready flavor with warm butter taste towards the end. There is a tiny bit of lemon in there too. Creamy medium body with a fluffy carbonatiion. The alcohol is present here and there, but doesn't take away from the overall quality of this fine brew. I love this style, and I love this beer. Southampton makes some damn good beers, and this one is a winner for sure. Get you hands on this one."
"D - A very good Maibock, as it went down easy and quickly. I will definitely be visiting this one again. Recommended."
"Another impressive Southampton."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"There is not a whole lot going on here, but, as a good Maibock should be, I really like the clean, pale malt flavor of this brew. It is accentuated just enough by the noticeable hops in the finish that add just a bit of complexity."
"Cloudy honey colored yellow/amber with a small bubbled off-white head. Nice bright malty sweet aromas of corn sugar, honey, toffee and floral esters and a little orange fruitiness. Hop flavor is a nice mellow citrus and moderate bitterness. Dry lightly roasted grains with a corn syrup sweetness and a slight yeasty twang at the end. Not as sweet as the nose might have indicated. Light body, medium mouthfeel, and moderate carbonation. Finish has some floral hoppy notes, a little grass and some corn syrup sweetness. An easy drinker and one I should drink more of at the beginning of the baseball season instead of the end."
"Flavor is just more of the fruit flavor balancing with a big boatload of biscuit and caramel malts. Very crisp and refreshing. Definitely spring-like. Medium body that is just slightly astringent. Alcohol kind of sneaks up on me though even though it is at 6.5%."
"Pours a clear copper color with an average offwhite head that dissipated fairly quick. The smell is of light caramel malt, sort of floral grain aroma. The brew also has a light caramel malt taste, honey, a bit bready, not much hops detected. The feel is moderate and sort of creamy for a lager, which is a bit odd but not bad. A very drinkable brew a bit on the sweeter and lighter end for a boch but a good transition from the winter brews to the summer brews. I expected a bit more of a bitter bite."
"It poured an amber color with a fair inch amount of head that soon dissipated. It had a bready smell with a hint of sweetness. First sip conjured up the image of a soft pretzel drizzled with honey. A little spicy and a little flowery, with a slightly heavy mouthfeel. I found it a great spring beer that is perfect for enjoying before you break out the hefes."
"Bottle courtesy of Moejuck: Poured a deep amber slightly cloudy color bock with a nice foamy dirty white color head with nice retention. Aroma of sweet malt is overpowering and a bit surprising for a bock. Taste is sweeter then expected and missing some of the nutty malt quality that I was expecting. Body is quite full with some adequate carbonation. Definitely too sweet for the style and not the best from this usually fine brewery."
"Very good drinkability. I will purchase a few more before the end of May."
"Overall a very nice bock. A nice grain bill makes this an easy and enjoyable drinker."
"Highly recommended."
"D: Very tasty, goes down with ease, slightly filling, good kick to it; it’s a beer worth sticking with for a whole evening. I don’t drink beers in this style very often, but each time I do, I’m reminded of how much I like the style and how under-rated I believe the style is as a whole. In particular, I think this beer is one of the best in its style."
"This offering from Southampton pours a dark orange leaving a thick tan head that quickly disappears. The aroma is tart, sour, citrus, with a bready toffee ending. The taste starts bitter from the tartness in the hops, and is balanced by a smooth malty caramel feel on the palate, leaving a fresh grassy finish. This offering from Southampton is delicious even in during this snow storm in March."
"This is one hell of a beer! I enjoyed this thoroughly, wished I had a six pack and not just a bomber. Pours a hazy, orangy to copper color. Smells of honey, slight alcohol, and nice grains. Other fruits going on I cannot detect. Not a lot of lacing down the glass, but who cares. Hits you with some nice munich malts upfront, with a decent hoppy back. A balanced beer for sure, and competes with the best, and one of my favorite styles."
"Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy amber/orange color with a small white head. It smells like pears, bread and a little nutty. It mostly tastes like grain/bread, but I can also taste some pears and hops too. The mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick. The drinkability is good, as the beer is very smooth and goes down easy. This is the first Southampton beer I've tried, and I think it's pretty decent. Not a bad choice at all, IMO."
"This brew pours an amber color with a spongy-looking slightly tan head (3cm) that quickly fizzles to a surface layer. Nothing special, but who says it has to be ""special"" to look at? Aroma is pretty typical of most lagers with maybe a bit more alcohol phenols along with the aroma of Welch's Grape Juice along with a sweet plum (interesting). Sipping reveals a slight grape-juice flavor right up front along with a hint of vanilla that I think lends itself from the alcohol presence. The swallow is taken over by a slight bitter, grainy hops flavor that balances this out a bit, but doesn't suit me as well as hoped due to the grain flavor. A medium body that lets go of some fizzy carbonation right of front much like ginger ale, but not much alcohol present, but a slightly drying finish (just not a finish like most basic lagers). Overall, I found this one a bit too sweet for my liking, but I wouldn't turn another bottle down. Solid showing from S-Hampton."
"Cheers!"
"Good drinkability level and well crafted."
"Beer served at 50 degrees. Poured a light brown interesting color. Smell was slightly nutty. Head went away quick. Beer had a good taste especially for a high % beer, there was no harsh or stinging aftertaste. i liked the beer but it was really nothing outstanding so I will have to say this one is a no repeate purchase."
"For 6.7% though, this was extremely smooth & tasty at the right time & place, despite what I said. Having to finish a bomber might have done it in for me somewhat, but my first impression of this style seems to have gone well. Now with better familiarity, I look foward to next years batch & the positive amendment it will undoubtedly bring."
"'S'okay, though...not bad, actually quite good, but I'd hope for more."
"This is a very tasty, drinkable beer. Like I said previously though, it seems closer to a belgian dubbel to me than a maibock."
"D: It's pretty good, but doesn't have anything close to a ""wow"" factor. Well-made, enjoyable, with a nice alcohol kick (without the bite). I'll admit that I only bought it because it was on sale for $3.27. Doesn't strike me as a beer I'd ever crave, but it did the trick, and I'm certainly glad I tried it."
"A big East Coaster thanks to the big K ""syrbeer"" for all the extras from a happily returned box of goodies from long ago."
"A clean amber/orange beer. Has a small off white head, no lace. The aroma has a light sweetness to ti with hints of fruit (apple) and toffee. Light sweet caramel and toffee notes sweep over your tongue with a hint of coffee as a easy spicey hop finish washes down the back of your throat"
"Decent beer over all, but not one that I would rush back to. Despite the fact that I know it is not there, I still find myself thinking that there is some adjunct in here... just has a hint of corniness or something similar. Either way, it's a good beer for the price, and I would recommend it."
"Drinkability: I definitely didn't have drinking this whole bottle down, in fact the bottle was almost all gone before I knew it, it was that good. One of the best Maibocks I've had and if this is the standard of Southampton, I will have to pick more from this brewery in the future."
"Drinkability: Southampton May Bock is very drinkable. A nice change of pace for me from IPAs, APAs and the such. Nice and fruity with a big malt back bone though the hops make an ever so slight appearance with a bitterness that balances out the malty sweetnes. Very easy on the palate and the alcohol is really well hidden for almost a 7% abv, though a warming of the face is present. Definitetly one I will seek again and a style that I am liking more and more. Seek out and enjoy."
"D: Very drinkable and well made representative of the style."
"Yea, I agree with most other BA's in that this beer is very good, with or without considering it's style. It's even better than many of the German counterparts that I have tried. A very nice golden / orange / copper color with a mildly heavy consistancy, nice head retention, and evident lacing. The aromas are all malt with a slight earthy hop spiciness. Boldy fruity with peaches, apples, and appricots. A mild bread / yeast character follows up, promising creaminess and richness. The flavors distribute a pleasant blend of amber malts and subtle graininess. Sweet and balanced bittering. Heavier than normal body with follow-up bready richness. Lightly alcoholic and cooling refreshment. Very nice."
"22 oz. bomber, 6.7% ABV. Pours a slightly hazy orange/gold color. Nice thick foamy off-white head holds up rather well, and there are some nice patches of laces as the beer is quaffed. Nice bready malt along with some floral hop notes in the aroma. Bready malt flavor, a hint of caramel and nuttiness. Again, floral hop flavor, with a good balance of bitterness. Medium body, with just enough carbonation. Very full of flavor, and easy to drink."
"Given Southampton's well-deserved reputation (and my love for their outstanding Double White Ale), I expected more from May Bock. Dashed dreams aside, it's still one of the best versions that I've ever had. Those with an interest in the style would be well-advised to seek out a bottle or two."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with sturdy carbonation. Goes down easily and ends up being quite a refreshing brew. A tasty maibock that I'm happy to have had the chance to sample. Southampton continues to impress me which each new offering I try."
"22oz. bottle. My first Southampton and it did not disappoint. Poured a clear, light amber-orange color with a large light tan head. Aroma was primarily malt, and some sort of spice. Alcohol peeked through very slightly, and there were no hops around that I could smell. Taste was very well balanced, with sweet malt up front and a nice, mildly hopped finish. The alcohol that I picked up in the scent did not make an appearance in the taste. Medium in body, medium+ carbonation, and mildly drying. A very enjoyable beer, nice balance of malt and hops, and one I would like to have again."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of the style and have been drinking it recently to better acquaint myself. With that said, I found this one better than the others that I've had so far and find it to be an enjoyable beer. Will I buy it again? Beats me."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the clear golden amber brew. Head lasts superbly, with plentiful hunks of lacing. Aroma is moderate maltiness, with enough hops character to cut it nicely. Taste follows along similarly, very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, and drinkability is excellent. I could revisit this one over and over, celebrating Spring all year long if they'd let me."
"My first Southampton beer, they just started distributing to Ohio. I've also got a Southampton Grand Cru I brought back from New York recently, but I'm waiting for a special occasion for that one."
"It migt not rock you're world, but try one, or more, next spring."
"Pleasant easy drinking malt lager. Some head, pleasant malty and toasty odour, very smooth drinkable and summer refresher. Buttery mouthfeel.Although, the hops kicking in at the finish can be harsh on some sips, the significant malt runs out. Grassy bitter aftertaste.My kids thought it was tasty."
"Drinkability was top notch. SHP can do no wrong it seems, they seem to nail every style they try and make tasty, delicious brews."
"Definitely not SPH's finest effort."
"Drinkability is very good. I just love this style and this is one of the best brewed in the USA, Not quite the Hofbrau Haus but very good. Quite amazing, this was just over $4/ bomber from NY State. I got Hofbrau Mai bock this year for about 75% of the cost, What a bargain al the way from Germany. Just a thought. Prost und Zum Wohl! MK"
"22 oz bomber. Pours a solid golden color with a finger of head consisting of mostly large bubbles, that falls quickly to a full coat over top of the beer. A moderate stream of bubbles is working up the sides of my glass and helping to heep the film over top of the beer there for longer than it would otherwise. This beer is crystal clear. The first sniff brings nice light doughy bread along with more bold toasted bread notes. The aroma is very clean, with just a light kiss of underlying malty sweetness. There is very little from the hops coming through in the aroma to me. Sipping this brew, I find this one is all about the melanoidans. Toasted bread dominates. There is an underlying sweetness. It's not caramel, but a doughy sweetness. IT finishes just as it started, with toasted breadyness trailing off, with just the slightest hint of bittering from spicey noble hop on the finish. I think the hop flavor and bitterness, though very subtle, really pulls this one together nicely on the finish. None of the flavors linger strong, but they sit nicely as they fade. Mouthfeel is moderate, with a moderate carbonation. Its not heavy, but still substantial. This beer is really damn good. Of all the lager styles out there, I think that maibock is my top choice, and this particular one is really getting my attention. The flavors are very well put together, and I could probably sit and drink a couple of bombers of this in a sitting. Excellent beer."
"alcohol is noticeable, though minimal"
"Southampton's May Bock pours a mostly clear orange-amber body beneath a full-sized head of frothy ivory foam. The retention is very good, and it leaves some nice lacing about the glass. The nose is richly malty with a sweet, bready character. It's medium-bodied and smooth across the palate. The flavor is rich and malty, and it's remarkably well-balanced. There's a delicate caramel edge to the malt, as well as a very subtle toastiness. Floral hops flutter here and there; and a spritz of peppery spice from the otherwiise completely hidden alcohol helps to keep it from getting doughy. One of the most balanced maibocks I've ever had!"
"Pours a nice peach/orange color. Nice peachy, citrusy aroma, but not much hint of hops. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. Rests nicely at the base of the tongue and finishes well. Malty and tasty, but not very flavorful. I like Maibocks, but still don't know a lot about the style, so I'm not sure how this would rate against some of the German traditionals, but it's a nice summer brew for hot US climates. I could definitely put two or three of these away in a short period of time and not feel the least bit ashamed by doing so. Southampton does some good beers, and this is another quality brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crispness that hits up front before fading into a smooth swallow."
"22 ounce bottle. ABV on bottle is 6.7%."
"906"
"This pours a clear burnt orange with a tan head. This does look pretty good,but the head does disappears quickly and leaves no lacing. The smell is abit malty,but it's very weak. Giving this a 3.0 is generous. The taste is mildly malty and hoppy. The spices are very subdued making this a very drinkable summer beer. The m/f is light and well balanced. A decent beer, not great, but one that will please my summer palate."
"Bomber bottle, label tells us that this contract brewed, somewhere besides southampton, N.Y., no freshness indication given. Pours orangy amber, clear with an off white heat and just leaving a bit of lacing. Nothing much to talk about in the nose here. Malty brew, smooth and very drinkable. Notes of maple, vanilla and perhaps a hint of lime well in the background. Fine sessioner, dull style in MHO, but high quality suds none the less."
"I loved the May Bock for its light body and graceful amber taste that lingered long after the beer was gone. It worked very well with baked chicken lightly covered with tangy Bone Suckin' Sauce."
"Mouthfeel is quite on par for the style and the drinkability is thru the roof for me...the perfect beer for the day."
"A refreshing beer super easy to drink and perfect for a sunny and warm spring early evening."
"Clear orange body with a small off white head that leaves some strings of lace. Nice sweet fruitiness mixed with toasty bread notes come through in the aroma. Sweet fruits with some biscuity malt start of the flavor. Toasted malts and grains with some earthy hops towards the finish. Definitely one of the best tasting Maibocks Ive ever had. Smooth crisp medium body. Easy drinking as it gets, I will have to go pick up a few more of these."
"This brew refracts light brilliantly. It's a beautiful a light amber color with minimal head. Nose is malt-dominant, with apple tarte tatin and a bit of pear coming through. On the palate this one is about malts primarily, with a big, juicy, smooth malt explosion (apples and pears again) melding into a showing of hops only at the very end of the finish. Typically for Southampton beers, this one is pretty thick on the palate. Goes down easy for drinkability, but has some good flavors as well. Another winner from Southampton."
"this is a fine southampton, and up there with double white as the best of the bomber series so far."
"Poured an orange-crimson color that was translucent with an off-white colored head. High level of carbonation with massive bubbles covering the surface. Some lacing was left behind in my goblet. Aromas of candy, burnt sugar, alcohol, and cream. The taste was sweet with a hint of spice underneath and a nice touch of bitterness. Smooth and silky, this beer was a pleasure to sip. Malt flavors dominated the beginning of each sip, but yielded slowly to hop bitterness in the finish. Felt silky in my mouth and would easily drink a few of these."
"Musings: I had this first with a crabcake sandwich at the SPH - and fell in love. The bottled version is very good also. Unique that a brew so dry carries the sweet fruit motherlode this one does."
"A new king of the heap for the maibock style? Very smooth, very drinkable, very tasty."
"Shiny, copper penny with a tightly knit, extravagant, lacy, white mop. Aroma of ripened pears and crisp green apples. Flavors of sweet caramel malt and leafy green hops and a brief drying finish. A spectacular and unpredictable May Bock for an unpredictable month. Tasty."
"This was the first Southampton brew that I was semi-disappointed with, and it still was pretty good. I just had heard a bunch of great things about this one and it didn't live up to my expectations. Again, it's not bad by any means, it just doesn't really stand out from the pack..."
"D - Definitely very drinkable in the easy to quaff sense. Not a whole lot of big flavor to give it that ""Damn I want more"" kind of drinkability."
"There's nothing here not to like. It's on point, malty and hoppy as expected, but the truth is, it's a bit thinner than I'd hoped. At the same time, it's especially drinkable because of its relatively light nature. It's certainly no disappointment, even if it doesn't really jump out. I'll finish this, and would have no issue with another."
"Drinkability: perfect. Nothing else to say. This bottle was quaffed rather quickly for the style. Go out and get some, and I'm getting some more !"
"Beautiful, golden-copper color and very clear. Extremely small head with average retention. The aroma had a little fruit qualities in it, which didnt really seem to fit the beer (apple). Nice malty front, and just a touch of alcohol in the smell. The beer is a little spicy and drier than I expected. Very low hop presence, but theyre certainly there. Nice balance, and a medium-light body. In my opinion, the beer could have stood for a little more malt sweetness, especially given the style. Its quite drinkable, though, and I did thoroughly enjoy it."
"Pours a soft copper and topped with a thick head of small off-tan bubbles with ample divots. The head slowly settles, leaving a few strands of lacing. There are only a handful of carbonation streams present. The smell is lightly malted with some biscuit and crisp, crunchy fruit, and just a touch of alcohol. As it warms the smell undergoes a subtle change to include a distinct apple juice note. The taste is rich and lush with malt, slightly sweet with some fruitiness up front giving way to a nice gentle hop finish that is punctuated with a bit of sugar and a touch of alcohol. The flavors are well meshed. Gets even better as it warms above cellar temp. Medium body with a velvety mouthfeel that is smooth as silk. A wonderful beer and well worth trying."
"Ahh, this fine brew is more than refreshing it is an experience. Niicely malted, this maibock pours a beautiful golden color out of the bottle. The head is nice but not long lasting, with a seemingly somewhat low carbonation. The smell is a malty sledge hammer to the nostrils, a very sweet come hither. The taste is pleasantly malty, with only the slightest hint of hops beneath. A very nice beer worth searching out and enjoying. I regret that I did not buy more. Buy some, before I buy them all up!"
"PS: looking at my overall number is deceiving... look at the taste and drinkability to know where it is at for this beer..."
"I expected a light grainy malt presence from the nose, but instead I get a strong roasted malt presence right off the bat, some sweetness up front too which finishes with a bit of grassy hops mixed with a sweet biscuity malt. After the brew leaves my mouth a rich toasted flavor remains encouraging me to take another sip. This is quite an impressive brew and I recommend grabbing some from the pub or anywhere you may see this well crafted beverage."
"Shared a growler of this seasonal with Greatpondbrewer, and I must say that Southampton has a winner. I'm not a lager drinker for sure, but this could almost convert me. It pours a dark amber, highlighted with reds and golds, and it has a frothy, bubbly cream-colored head; there was very little lacing as the head receded quickly. To the nose, it is sweet and clean, but not terribly distinctive. However, the taste is much better; I noted its sweetness to be sure, but there's some subtle smokiness in the undercarriage and after a while the peanut taste becomes more apparent. Also, I notice cloves, but not in a cloying way. The mouthfeel is thin, and there is virtually no carbonation. Give this a go; frankly, the taste alone is worth it."
"64oz. growler from Half Time. Poured an amber bordering on golden color. Loose, off-white head on top that receded into bubbles and foam. Smell was slightly clovey and banana like with notes of juicy fruit flavors as well. Taste started off with more of those traditional bock characteristics of cloves and sweet autumn spices and banana esters, but half way through the taste it morphs to a more biscuity, toasty flavor and a slight hop bitterness. The taste and mouthfeel with less carbonation, lack the cleaness of a traditional lager beer, but make up for it with an increased complexity. This is the perfect beer to sip on a cooler spring night. Side by side comparison with the smutty Maibock and this one came out the big winner."
