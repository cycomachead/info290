I would get this beer over a Heineken beer if your into lagers. Overall this is a good beer smooth and refreshing. This is my first time buying any kind of  Gordon Biersch beer. So far no disappointment from this company. When I'm not in my hoppy mood or dark style kind of beers I would get another six pack of this beer. My review probably doesn't give outsiders a good evaluation but I have not had too many Blonde Bocks and this one is good until proven otherwise.","B4PTSD","Jan 30, 2015"

3.46,4.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"While I didn't get too much of the Hallertau spiciness in the nose, it immediately presented itself with the first sips of beer. Along with the spiciness, which was only exacerbated by the fine-bubbled carbonation, it had a bitterly sweet presence that intertwined with grainy malts and a zesty alcoholic bite that warmed me after each swallow. It holds a very solid medium mouthfeel that seemed to press the lighter bitterness into the roof of my mouth while the heavier alcohol and malts slid over my tongue. It was a curious sensation to say the least. My only complaint with this brew is that it leaves quite a sticky bitter, almost sour, aftertaste; but with 7% ABV, it proved itself to be remarkably quaffable once I got going.","Lucklys","Oct 22, 2010"

3.51,6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Clean golden color, with small amounts of carbonation floating lazily to the top. Small white head doesn't last long, but makes for an overall beautful beer while it's there. Aroma and taste of green apples and pears, but not enough to hide the formidable 7% abv. Light carmel and lemon finish. Not quite enough hops to balance the sugariness. Medium light bodied. An excellent lager for the price, very drinkable, one of my standards.","droomyster","Nov 28, 2004"
4.33,30.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Marked by a grainy, even ""juicy"" malt, this beautiful helles bock is a perfect example of the style! It's golden body has a light orangeish tint beneath it's short but very creamy bright-white head. The head retention is quite good given its 7% alcohol content, and it leaves walls of spotty lace about the glass. The nose is clean and fresh with lightly candy-sweet and grainy malt that beckons you to imbibe. A zesty, fine-bubbled carbonation cuts through some of its medium body, leaving it to appear a touch thinner than it is; and awakens the tastebuds before the beer slides smoothly away. Balance is what the flavor is all about, and it's sweetish dose of malt is balanced by a low-lying bitterness and snappy alcoholic bite. As it warms, the richness widens, but it never steps beyond it's bounds. It's not intended to be a complex beer - just a rich one, and it succeeds masterfully. It's masterfully brewed, and despite it's alcohol content, it remains highly drinkable!","NeroFiddled","Oct 29, 2004"
2.92,-11.8,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"The taste was very sweet almost too much for my taste. A strong carmel flavor with a hint of bitter in the end. Nothing more really stood out to me.","HochFliegen","Oct 07, 2004"

3.53,6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability  This one is a little much to qualify as a session beer (which I think all Bocks should be able to do) but it was drinkable on a limited scale. I wouldnt want more than one round of it, but it wasnt bad.","RoyalT","Sep 30, 2004"
3.15,-4.8,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear golden liquid with a good thick white head. The head disappeared way too quick for me. Very little lace on the glass. Typical pale malt smell, with a touch of earthyness. Malty up front. The malt had some degree of depth to it. Dry at the end, with very little bitterness. Light body, with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall, pretty easy to drink, but not really outstanding.","Bierguy5","Sep 05, 2004"
3.16,-4.5,4,3,3.5,3,2.5,"And when you do, you may be slightly disappointed -- not because it's bad, but because it's so pretty, you expect it to be better. GBBB is more hoppy than malty, and leaves a very slight metallic aftertaste. And because of its high alcohol content (7.0%) you may not want more than one. Overall, I'd rate it Good, but nowhere close to Great.","DFN","Beers"
3.42,3.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not bad by any means, pours a solid orange/gold color. A semi white head is decent to the eye, lacing is average. The smell is of syrup and sweet sugar malts, slight hints of molasses. The tase is of apple/caramel and molasses, no real hop to balance out the sweetness, still not powerful, wich is good in a golden bock, still a bit rich.","beertaster13","0"

The smell was quite grainy and had a nice sweet maltiness to it. The flavor was pretty good with a good sturdy malt backbone, a medium bodied mouthfeel and a hint of spice in the background.

3.2,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Appearance: Amber blonde with a white fleeting head leaves thin sporadic spots of lace. Aroma: Rich maltiness semi-nutty with alcohol making a strong presence on the nose, a bit one dimensional with a touch of hops. Taste: Grainy offness in each sip high alcohol isn't hidden well at all, semi sweet graininess and off bitter grainy finish not that great. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied strong lager not my cup of tea I've had better German and American brewed versions. Drinkability: Lacks many characteristics to bring a high level of drinkability, getting one down is a job not well constructed a bit harsh with the grainy offness and overbearing alcohol.","WVbeergeek","Mar 28, 2004"

There was a touch of caramel sweetness, a hint of butterscotch and phenols. The alcohol was well hidden. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation.
