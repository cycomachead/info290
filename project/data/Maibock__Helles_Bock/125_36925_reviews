"Overall – A rather tasty Maibock overall.  Thick and bready with a good showing of fruit and just enough hop to keep it more balanced and rather enjoyable.  Quite tasty."

"Solid maibock. Recommended."

"O - A very enjoyable lager and one that I'd be glad to have again."

"Recommended!"

"It is a medium bodied offering flirting with being more heavy than it should be. It displays a modest to lower level of carbonation and has quite a sticky sweet feel to it that while understandable for the style is a bit too exaggerated. Overall it wasn't a terrible offering but I would not be in a hurry to try this again either."

"Strawberry blond pour with a nice head and great retention. Hop aromas and almost an Oktoberfest malt scent on the nose. Clear looking. Clear taste which is really smooth. A little too hoppy for a Maibock. Has more of an APA feel on the back. It's not a bad brew just would like the hops to be calmed a bit and the color a bit darker."

" I had this brew before in a couple bombers and it had a harsh bitterness but the sampler case taste much better this time. Very smooth and drinkable for an 8%."

"Taste: Pretty nicely bodied, with some nice flavor. Not too bitter (I don't like bitter beers) Overall, I was surprised. I thought it was an IPA when I ordered it (I don't like IPAs). But it turned out to be one of my favorite Penn beers."
"Overall - Pretty sweet yea sneaky strong for a summer beer. This one could end up getting you in trouble. The sweet fruits add some serious drinkibilty. Its a fun beer, and tasty but not for the week of heart, i would prefer a wit or summer wheat beer with 4-6% alcohol on a summer day, this would be a good closer or after the sun went down."
"O: Definitely drinkable and did have a few will certainly have to get more before they disappear. Maybe a growler or two think it would be a great beer to cook with."
"O: Not sure if the bottle was 'bad'. Will certainly give it another shot and will re-review as necessary."
"Overall I got to recommend this to someone who likes pilsners and it was OK for him. Just glad I got to try this for 3.00 than 8 bucks a 22oz."
"Drinkability: The sticker on the tap handle remarks ""You Have Been Warned"" and the simple fact is this is a light flavored, easy drinking beer with alot of ABV behind it. I found this well rounded specimen to be deserving of some praise, and plus its fun to drink."
"Overall I would say that PENNdemonium was a bit of a disappointment for me. If given the chance, I would suggest reaching for something else in the stellar lineup that the Penn Brewery produces."
"D: drinkable but alcohol could really catch up with you"
"For the price it's a steal for an interesting and creative beer. I paid US$1.90 for a 22oz bomber locally."
"Not bad, there seems to be a soft diacetyl influence at times that can make this a bit on the buttery side, but it is not overwhelming, even though I can be particularly sensitive to it at times."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. Appears a cloudy apricot color with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. The foam settle to a thin layer within minutes and remains for most of the glass. Nose and flavor are sweet and fruity, with notes of apples, pears, nectarines, sweet malt, alcohol, and slightly spicy. Between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head that dissipated into a light ring. The aroma is of a musty doughy malt, and a touch of spicy hop The taste has a honey/doughy malt sweetness, some light lemon, a bit grainy, and a peppery/bitter hop balance. Nice helles flavors, though a bit hot from the booze. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation, fairly balanced. The high ABV kills the drinkability but the brew has nice flavors."
"Pours a hazy orange with a thick head. Lacing clings to the sides of the glass. Smell is quite faint, but wisps of orange and malt backbone are what I can pick up. Taste is malty with some tartness towards the back. Almost like a sour grain taste. Quite a complex taste that has many different cascading flavors. Some notes of banana, some of the alcohol is present at the back of the throat. It is hard to believe that this beer is 10%. There is enough carbonation to cut the alcohol and enough body to it."
"Pours a cloudy peachy orange, really neat colour, thin white head forms, settles to a thin ring around the glass, few lace spots on the glass, decent retention, looks pretty neat. Smell is sweet, peaches and nectarines, very clean, honey, bread, alcohol, a bit soapy, a bit sugary, apricots, pretty cool. Taste is sugary, honey, peaches/nectarines again, apricot, alcohol, a bit spicy, very clean, pretty damn smooth for 10%. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, insanely smooth, pretty neat flavour and very clean, I like this. Thanks Jay!"
"Opinion: I don't know. I am a HUGE fan of Bock beers and this is about 90% of what I brew...Dunkels to Doppelbocks. This beer really tastes ""macro"" to me and could pass for a better quality malt liquor. If you put this in a brown paper bag, you would make a ""fine"" wino. Nothing really jumped out at me from this beer, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if they were using adjuncts...even though they say that ""this is a Bock beer"" on the label. I would pass on this on in the future...and would barely drink it over iced tea or some such."
"Overall it was average, way too much alcohol in it to be considered really good for the style. I just think this was one extreme beer that could have been well served toned down a few notchs."
"M&D - Thin but sticky"
"Mouthfeel is sadly thin, but bubbles save it from being awful. Overall... I'm not sure it's highly drinkable. But it's different, and the alcohol content is SUPER sneaky. For 5ish bucks? I'd get it again. Hooray for this find! I am pleased."
"Pours a clear bronze with a two finger white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of foam. Not much lacing left behind, but continuous bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell consists of booze, honey, toasted grains, and candy sugar...nothing more, nothing less. Peppery grains up front on the tongue followed by light fruits (grapes, pears, apples), and caramel malt. Lots of sweetness on the tongue, too much in fact. The flavor could use some hops for balance. Aftertaste is slightly warm from the alcohol and malty with a lingering honey flavor to it. Body is light with a strong carbonation and slick feel. Too much candy flavors and the high abv make this one a bit difficult to drink. Maibock's should stick around in the 6% abv range. I understand everyone is jumping onto the Extreme Beer bandwagon, but come on...this is a bit over the top."
"D: Not really my style, but not bad."
"D: The alcohol is a little too high. That coupled with the dinner bottle makes this a one and done. The Brewer's Reserve series is proving to be a nice line-up."
"I really was hoping for a lot more here. It was surprisingly bland and also way too hot. I wouldn't revisit."
"Drinkability: Now I know why they say on the label that this beer created an uproar at the brewery and why they put ""you've been warned"" on the label. That's because it's not good. Like I said before, it was same boring flavors over and over again. Don't be fooled by the cool shiny label because directly behind the label is a below avaerage beer. There's no way I would waste any more money on this beer again. You've be warned!"
"Pretty tasty and easily pegged as a big Maibock. What happened to the carbonation and head? Perhaps its way past prime..No dating on the bottle, so no way too tell."
"Pretty much an extreme Maibock. Double Maibock. Imperial Maibock. Well, maybe not as the hops are kept in check. But it is higher on the %ABV side, and it's a little thick (dextrins?). It's enjoyable and certainly worth a try. Recommended."
"If I lived within the distribution area, I could see myself drinking this a lot this spring . . ."
"Drinkability - this beer would do for any occasion calling for bock!"
"D: Average brew overall per style, wouldn't have seconds."
"D: Definitely not session beer; some beers hide their alcohol, and this is not one of them. Not my favorite, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Overall, this is an above-average beer. It hides its ""extreme"" qualities very well and as such is quite approachable for the non-extreme beer drinker."
"Poured from a bomber and served next to a festive jambalaya burrito. Aside from complimenting the spicy burrito, I'm struck by two things with this beer: First, the flavor is too subtle for an 8% beer. Second, this beer is incredibly drinkable. I feel more like I'm drinking some weird German bock hybrid of the English bitter. All the flavors, the grassy hops, bready malt, and sharp bock fruit ester are all a touch muted. At the same time, this beer feels exceedingly creamy in a great way and my bottle is empty in no time. While it's a shame this beer isn't richer, it will also sneak up on you."
"This one poured a slightly hazed, golden amber and was topped by an off-white head composed of average sized bubbles. The head retention was pretty good and there was some coarse, chunky lacing. The aroma was really malty with some grain and crackery character, plus a bit of fruitiness. The flavour was quite sweet and malty and the bitterness was restrained. There were also fruity notes and a tangy, slight tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, it had just a bit of warmth and good texture. Easy drinking for a fairly big beer. The alcohol was well hidden behind the big malt character."
"I bought this bottle out of curiosity from Minotti's Liquor in North Olmsted, OH."
"Pours a clear golden amber. Nose is like dried wheat. If not wheat, then just dried straw. I just think ""dried"" when I take a whiff. Flavor is smooth with a sweet touch to it. The sweet might be overstated for some. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is good as well. Seems a bit too sticky though. Overall this is good, but a bit too lop-sided with the sweet edge to it."
"Very clear, pale beer with almost no head. What little head there is fades extremely fast. Aroma is alcoholic and malty, with almost no hops. Very clean aroma. No esters. Flavor is alcoholic and malty, with a faint hop presence. Warms all the way down. Again, a very clean flavor. No yeasty, earthy or ester characters. Finishes very well balanced. Strong for style, but real nice."
"D - One of my new favorite styles, this is a fine example. This lager is so drinkable it is big and full w/ a smooth subtle sweetness. A class act from Penn Brewing! Extremely well made Mai Bock - superbly quaffable, I enjoyed every taste from 1st to last. Can't wait to share this again if the chance arises."
"Beer is good. Happy big PA bock beering."
"Overall: A nice beer that tastes great. Penn makes the greatest hefe in the world in my opinion and the skill and care used in that beer is transformed into this one. I really like this beer and it was a true joy to try it. There were plenty of its brothers and sisters left on the shelf and lets just say I will adopt a few more from the family for those not so cold winter months ahead."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is perfect. It has a wonderful pale and Munich malt scent along with a slight bisquity aroma. It's rich with a fruity yeast aroma as well; very nice. The taste is good. It has a fruity pale malt and yeast flavor that goes down easy and finishes sweet and malty with loads of Munich malts. It light and highly drinkable even at 10%. It has a mild bisquit character that really rounds out the palate. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I really don't see much wrong except, I would maybe increase the mouthfeel a bit to make it a bit heavier, but really it's fine the way it is. This is my first Penn beer and it's damn good. I could drink more of these for sure."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, excellent representation of style and then takes the style to the next level which isn’t done very often with Mai Bocks much less this well. A could see myself drinking a couple of these in an evening and enjoying them quite a bit. At that point however, either the ABV may catch-up with me or I might be too full to drink much more. Either way this is an excellent beer that I enjoyed a great deal."
"I would say that this doesn't compeletly stay to the bock beer style. It does ressemble a Mai Bock. Either way this is good brew."
"Bomber bottle, clear medium honey amber, initially lifts a large near white head, it quickly clears out to a skimpy film, leaves nice looking fine and scattered lacing. Candy apple and grass clippings in the nose. Sweet, tasty, clean and strong brew...strong lager lovers rejoice...this one is dangerously easy drinking...alcohol well hidden, notes of vanilla, honey, clean, smooth malts...nice creation by Penn, highly recommended"
"Pours a clear gold with a copper hue. A finger of pearl head that dies quick to little lacing. Smells of fresh bread, minute citrus. Taste is doughey with malt and a crisp carbonation. The mouthfeel is light to medium. Where is the 10% ABV? Seriously, this is probably the most dangerous beer I have had. Drinks like a Spaten which I could easily finish a 6 pack of but is leaving me cross eyed with this bomber. Not my favorite style but if its yours you better give this a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and a little syrupy with a very low/smooth carbonation. The drinkability is pretty high especially with the big alcohol content. Overall this is a decent beer, but not something I would ever seek out again."
"Pours up your standard clear golden pils color with a disappointingly short-lived bone white head that immediately seperated into a thin, soapy collar. Very few streamers of fine carbonation. Color aside, not a pleasant looking brew. Aromas of pale malts, honeydew, light must, and some malt liquor-like vegetal fusel alcohols. I'm feeling that the subtle carbonation is not pulling all the aroma through, but what aromas I'm getting are certainly more pleasant than its appearance. The flavor is mildly fruity with some faint tropical notes, lightly kilned pale malt sweetness shines throughout. Sugar-coated green apple. Alcohol warmth follows each sip. Carbonation is way too low for the thickness if the beer, and is a serious detrement to the overall enjoyment of the beer. I'm not entirely sure that this bottle wasn't shipped and/or stored properly even though it was bought from a very reputable source. I imagine a better bottle would be like Trompe la Morte stepped up a notch. Overall experience wasn't horrible, it could have been piss flat, but pretty close to it. Maybe I'll find a better bottle and give it another whirl. Kind of disappointing because I really enjoy all of Penn's world-class line of beers, this one just either missed its mark completely, not meant to age several months, or was tainted somewhere between brewery and vendor."
"Interesting style..pleasant drink."
"Gotta be honest I preferred this one on tap the bottle with a few months of aging doesn't go down as smooth as those pints at Fathead's, Smokin' Joe's, and Bocktown did in the past. Basically if you have this on hand or plan to try it do so as soon as possible. It's not turning but it's not getting any better."
"PENNdmonium pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is malty. The taste is sweet and malty without noticeable hops. A little bit of alcohol is noticeable at times, but doesn't overwhelm. The mouthfeel seems a bit thin. This went down pretty easy, I enjoyed it, definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability isn't fantastic. This is a sipper beer, and on a hot Florida day likt this, I wouldn't choose this again in the heat of the day. Great for a cool night, though!"
"Dangerous beer would never guess this is a 10% beer. Right up there with St Nicholas Bock. Great Beer !!!"
"Drinkability: I could say it's neither the most exciting beer I have ever faced nor is it really a beer I'd return to, but why interfere with the PBC? Live and let live, I say."
"Very enjoyable."
"D: This beer is OK. The big sweetness in the flavor makes this one a bit difficult to drink for me, but for maibock fans, this may be a decent choice."
"Pours a pale light golden amber color with a frothy white head. Nothing spectacular about the appearance at all, and I was a bit bummed that the head faded relatively fast and left behind no lace. Oh well, so it goes. The aroma is a nice banana nut and clove scent, with some pepper and a faint strawberry/pear smell off in the distance. A slightly boozy, floral aroma, but the alcohol is masked well enough on the whole by the banana clove scent. Not bad. This beer tastes okay. A decent enough blend of slightly sweet and slightly spicey. Again, that peppery banana nut bread flavor is prominent. And the cloves settle in again as well. Light fruit flavors, although nothing really rises up to clarify. Crisp dry finish from a smooth mouthfeel. I'm not sure I would go so far as to call this a highly drinkable beer, but I'm glad I tried it. It's an interesting, potent (10% ABV) maibock, and it would pair nicely, I think, with a fruit salad, or some fruit-related dessert (like a pound cake with fresh strawberries on top). Definitely worth a try."
"I love the idea behind this brew and the brewers at Penn did a nice job. Prosit Mk"
"Just a hint of smoke in here too - but not so much smoked malts - but more of a cigarette smoke...not pleasing. This beer was very disappointing to me. I love Penn beers. This just seems like a malt liquor. Then I read here that it is 10% alcohol - should a true maibock be 10%? I think not. Lacks depth and character."
"D- Very easy-drinking. The mouthfeel is what really made this beer stand out in my mind. Definitely worth a try."
"D - Not bad. Unless I find it on tap, I doubt I will have it again. Worth a try if you like malty bocks."
"Overall: I was anticipating trying this brew for weeks and I am glad I did. Great authentic flavors. Not sure if it fits exactly into the traditional Maibock style, it seems to be a bit of a hybrid. A quality brew nonetheless. Another fabulous offering from Penn Brewery!"
"Cheers."
"Drinkability: Mostly clean and smooth. Some bitterness in the end."
"Note: My ratings on this brew are pretty high and might be higher than some other brews I like better than this one. Like I said before, I'm not normally a huge fan of helles bocks, but this Penn brew is especially good when comparing it to others in the style, so I'm going to rate it fairly high."
"Drinkability: An exceptional Maibock, even though I am not a big fan of the style; hides the alcohol well"
"Perhaps the only drawback is it has very little aroma, which is a shame because the taste is excellent. Will be heading down the hill to score some 22 oz bottles of this."
"Were it not for the abv. (which is very well disguised), this would be the perfect summer beer. It has plenty of flavor, but does not taste the least bit heavy or tiring to drink. The beer list at Max's indicates the abv. is 8%, but whether it's 8 or 10, this is definitely a sizable beer. Excellent effort from Penn brewing."
"D - A big, bold German style lager from a brewery that does them up right. I for one welcome our new high gravity Penn beers. :) The flavor is what makes this beer shine. Oh yeah, this beer can seriously hamstring you as well. Alcohol is invisible. And it really is 10%abv. If you see it listed as 8%, thats from the abw listed on Penn's website."
"This is a great new release by Penn Brewery. It pours a pale transparent straw yellow with a healthy white head. It has a pretty light smell. The taste is light and wonderful. Smooth malt at the beginning with some light fruit and spice flavoring. Light sweet malt (maybe honey) aftertaste. This beer is very smooth. I had no idea the ABV was this high until I checked it out after I got home. A delcious new addition to the Penn lineup. I reccomend trying it."
