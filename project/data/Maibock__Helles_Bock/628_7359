I'm not sure what to think – I love the style but it is inherently a pale, strong lager which means that, if done poorly, it constitutionally becomes a “malt liquor”.

Everything else is so mute that booze really is the dominant flavour in this beer. Booze and sugar. Light bodied with low carbonation, it feels both thin and syrupy. Terrible beer.

The first thing that hits you is a dubbel-like maltiness and sweetness followed by a large and in charge hoppiness made up of noble hops. This seems like something to be imbibed in the biergarten out a 2 liter mug no less. Das ist gut, excepting for the funky twang on the aftertaste, otherwise the early workings of a belgian.

Grassy taste, some more mellow bitter hops notes. Alcohol comes through as the beer warms. No real discernable malt tastes. Fairly strong carbonation bites the tongue, low-medium body.

The taste is very thin with a prominent alcohol feel. Theres a little bit of husky grain and a lager yeast crispness. The hops are overpowered by rubbing alcohol alcohol flavors. Maybe this beer was too thoroughly fermented, its body is thinnish and it lacks depth in its malt profile. The mouthfeel is watery and unevenly carbonated. Theres a sweet slightly vegetal finish.
