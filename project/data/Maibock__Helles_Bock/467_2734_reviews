"Overall : it's not my bag really but it's a good beer. A touch too hoppy for me but it's still true to style. I'm not sorry I tried this, it's worth a shot if you like bocks and blonde pales and want to mix it up a bit."

"The body is a sturdy one, a medium that isn't too heavy for the style and offers a nice, less than overbearing thickness off a fluffy carbonation that seems to lighten it one the tongue without taking from the body.  It has a very nice balance of smoothness and crispness, both of which remain strong."
"Decent.  It seemed better in the past, but it could just be me."

"Overall- Very good beer and very enjoyable. This may become one of my go-to spring beers."

"Overall â€“ This was a very big flavored and rather tasty easy drinking maibock at a decent abv. I rather enjoyed this one and would certainly recommend it to others."
""
""
"D: A very drinkable warm weather bock. Light and crisp with some firm malt presence and nice hop bitterness. Really well done like I am finding most of Summits brews. Without flaw. Would have again."

"Overall I highly enjoyed this beer, it had a lot of what I love in beers, good specialty malts, great hop selection, and a superb overall job."
"Again, the downfall of this beer begins and ends with the mouth feel. It is also disappointing that this beer is entirely too grainy, and not malty enough for a bock."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Taste was a creamy grain and raisiny sweetness, very lightly toasty, light but firm grassy-spicy bitterness, very faintly herbal, with raisiny bready aftertaste. Feel was nice and creamy."

"Overall an easy drinking summer beer. Nothing amazing, but good enough for a layover on my way home."
"O: Good-looking maibock that doesn't quite deliver in other categories. I greatly prefer Boss Tom's from Boulevard here in KC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only reason I mark this down a little is that the bitterness surprised me. I didn't expect so much hops in this style. Nevertheless, I will probably drink this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: very nice Mai Bock, and though I am not a Mai Bock fan I could drink this again and again"
"Not bad at all. A touch hoppier than I like in the style, but very well done, and still quite fantastic."

"Overall: This is a seasonal beer from Summit and come next spring I'll probably go for it again at least once. Definitely a far cry from your typical macro lager, but nothing to write home about. At 6.7 abv it's no session beer, but drinks like one. Would pair nice with a salad or chicken entree."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice maibock. Another solid seasonal offering from Summit."
""
"This beer works well with the German New Age Composer Popol Vuh and his cd 'Aguirre' that is written for the movie 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God' starring the iconic Klaus Kinski and directed by his cohort Herzog. Kindofthe Scorsese Duvall team of Germany."
""
"This is one of the better American Maibocks I've had. For me, the standard is HB Maibock and every one I try is compared to that one. This one is not quite there, as the color is too light, it's not as ``chewey'', and the lemony spice from the hops doesn't compete with the peppery notes you get with HB. Still, this is very good."
""
""
"Look is light orange-amber, clear with a small yellow-white head with good retention and lacing. Smell is light malt, grain, apples, pears. Taste is crisp crackers, white bread, overripe fruit, apples, pears, oranges. A bitter, fruity finish, medium-light body with ok carbonation. Dry, but not overly so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a spring seasonal, I really enjoy Summit's version of the maibock."
""
""
"This seems quite hoppy for a bock, but I'm not all that familiar with the Maibock style. All around, I found it uninspiring. Nice, lacy head, though! Medium body, non-descipt beer-ish smell, some OK citrus notes through the hops, but not thrilling. I'd drink it again, but I probably wouldn't buy it myself!"
""
""
""
""
"My aggro pour created two-plus fingers of eggnog-colored head with good retention. The beer itself was a deep golden-yellow that would make Midas and Croesus envious and cause Greg Koch to call me a wussy. I LIKE beers that look like beer! I also like to bury my nose in my beer and this had a big malty sweetness to it which will make a nice change of pace from my recent spate of big hoppy beers. Next, I like to fill my mouth with beer until my cheeks bulge out like a chipmunk's and let the beer just roll around on my tongue. This method is NOT recommended with Sixpoint's Resin as the beer acted like a hydrofluoric acid burn and wormed its way into my tongue through all of my weak link tastebuds. Here, it warmed with a soothing softness and although it was a Bock, it was not cloying or overly malty. They struck a nice balance between too sweet and too dry. I do not mind dry beers, but style is style, after all. Finish was semi-dry and very pleasant to just sit and sip on a lazy afternoon. The price point was VERY nice and would easily warrant a re-visit."

"lacing. Light fruity esters and a grainy nose with floral notes. The body is more floral with a grainy background and a light spicy bitterness. The beer finishes clean with a malty sweetness. A very enjoyable beer that seems like a great regular drinking beer..."

"Overall, this is a fairly satisfying helles. All the right targets get hit closely, but there are some flavors I could do without (some of the malt profile, the ethanol). Still, this is a decent version of the style."
"D/O: This is an easy-drinking strong lager that represents its style reasonably well. It is sometimes difficult to find an American-brewed maibock that does not cross the line of restraint so integral to the German style--but this beer makes the cut. It is the balance of restraint and memorable qualities that makes this more enjoyable than the sum of its parts."
"O- Not a bad beer at all. Refreshing and light for almost 7% alcohol, very well hidden"
"This is a pretty dark gold brew with a decent head that leaves lots of lacing. The aroma is faint and doesn't really have any distinct elements to it. The taste is quite nice. Hints of orange and floral with a mellow malt back. The hop element is low key and pleasant. It goes down with a bit of a tingle and lets that sweetness linger. It's a nice easy-going beer that would appeal to many."
"O: I really enjoyed this brew and wish I could my hands on it more easily in the maibock season -- a delcious sweet and bready maltiness that represents ths tyle wvery well."
"This beer poured out as a golden color with a pretty decent looking head on top. The lacing was thin and kind of scattered about. The smell of the beer had a good amount of grain on the nose and some hops. The taste brought those two elements along onto the tongue and ended up being pretty refreshing. The mouthfeel was light and had a decent amount of carbonation to it. Overall I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this beer. I would totally give this one another try one day."
"Overall: Easy enough to drink -- it would definitely be a summer beer, preferably outside on the lawnmower; light flavors with a bit of bitterness to keep it refreshing; ABV is just under 7% is virtually undetectable (I'm actually surprised it's listed as that high because it doesn't really seem like it would be)."
"Overall- A decent beer. Hoppier than a normal Maibock, quite tasty."
"O: overall, this beer is solid. Looking forward to having another."
"O - Not bad, makes for a good Springtime adult beverage. Nothing to write home about, but no Maibock has ever really blown my socks off."
"This is a fairly non-descript beer overall with muted flavor, but is a reliable choice if you are looking for a pleasant, decently balanced and easy to drink beverage."
"O: This is another solid beer from Summit. They never let me down. That being said it's somewhere in the middle for me as far us their offerings go. Nothing about this beer makes me want to drink it on regular basis, but it's not a bad choice once or twice in the spring."
"O- drinkable and refreshing. Nothing special and not may favorite helles. Enjoying it on a Fire Sale so I may have another."
"A great lager and Maibock. At first, this was just a standard lager, but lots of subtle nuances come out as this breaths and warms up. Excellent, and highly recommended."
"Overall, a little dissapointing, it looked impressive coming out of the bottle, but the flavors were a bit subdued. still tasty enough for second try."
"O: Not a bad effort, but I could definitely ask for more hop personality and a better nose."
"Drinkability: Crisp and clean, it has a nice zip to it. I am not too familiar with maibock, but this version pales in comparison with its German ancestor."
"Overall decent beer, not one of my favorites but have a special interest since touring the brewery."
"Overall: A nice version of a Maibock. Nothing outstanding but pretty good."
"O- Nice malty spring-time beer with floral notes and citrusy hops. Only real drawback is the strength of the alcohol, which comes through quite strong in both taste and smell."
"Notes: Average beer that didn't really pop. It was decent but there was just too much musty grain flavor. Overall just nothing exciting that would make me want to get it again."
"Pours clear and yellow with a good amount of carbonation. Head of white foam falls slowly leaving some lace. Smells clean to slightly sweet. Clean malt flavor dominates with perhaps a touch of toasted malt character towards the finish. Very balanced finish (not too sweet) for a Maibock. Bit of minerals in the finish and a little hop bite as it warms up. Very smooth mouthfeel, decent body for the style. Not bad, but not necessarily worth seeking out."
"Overall a decent beer, nothing that makes it really memorable, but a pretty easy to drink beer."
"I say this beer is okay not perfect but pretty drinkable alcohol only become notable near the end. not a bad beer"
"D - Not a stunner, but pretty much what I expect from a maibock...crsip, smooth and refreshing; a great beer to welcome the spring, although not too much to differentiate it from a lot of the other maibocks out there."
"A little too sweet for my tastes, but it's still decent drinking."
"Opinion: This was an OK beer, but I guess I am a little too picky or something. I like my beers drier and more lively with a more reserved hop addition. All that said, this beer has hope, as it tastes like it was intended to be a MaiBock, but I would just cut back on the bittering hops and use a more attenuative yeast. It sounds like I am doing a homebrew review, but that is the case with this beer. There are no flaws in this beer. It is pretty good, and I am not minding drinking it one bit, but it is falling short of what I would expect for a MaiBock."
"I was a bit surprised to see this out already, but not enough to turn it down. It pours a clear pale-ish straw topped by a large finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, light corn, and very light honey. The taste holds notes of lemongrass, greens, flowers, light orange peel, and wheat. The first two elements contribute a decently strong bitterness, especially for the style. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a sub-par maibock, one I don't really ever want to revisit."
"Drinkability: this was an overall easy drinking maibock and hits the spot when looking for a malty beer."
"The flavors were close to a traditional maibock but something went wrong and there are flaws in the beer that ruin an otherwise decent effort in flavor combinations. Not one I think I'll ever try again; I mean that for the beer and the brewery."
"D - Not my #1 style in the beer world, tend towards the hoppy/bitter stuff. Overall this is pretty enjoyable, if not memorable. On a crisp late summer (but fall-like) night, this still hits the spot pretty well. I could easily have a couple more of these, but I could just as easily move over to try something else instead."
"M/D: Feels great in the mouth apart from the alcohol being rather strong. Actually, it seems Summit did not try to mask the alcohol at all. The drinkability is poor. I would say Summit dropped the ball on this one."
"I've been trying some maibocks out recently, and this one is really pretty solid. It's not too ""maibocky," its got a lightness and crispness to it. It's a tasty beer that won't change your life or blow your mind, but a tasty beer is hard to argue with."
"Sweet grainy malts collide with a burnt toast and floral hop bitterness. Instead of balancing each other, it's more like they are polarizing the flavors in the beer. Mouthfeel is fine, and the carbonation is adequate. The beer lacks smoothness and the alcohol is not well masked, biting even. Not really a big fan of this one."
"D- easy to throw back. I wouldnt spend money on a sixer or anything but i would have one at a restaurant."
"I thought this was very drinkable. I haven't been overwhelmed with most of Summit's beers, but this style works well with their brewing style. I'd certainly buy another 6."
"Drinkability is decent. This is a hard style for me to get super-excited about. I could get a few down. I wouldn't have guessed it was especially boozy, but it's up there a little bit. The best part of the beer is the look. It's still competently made, but this really isn't a style that makes waves. We'll see if I still feel that way after the Three Floyds/Half Acre collab comes out."
"M/D - A really good tasting brew from Summit, it has the right balance of hops and malts to make it a pretty easy and enjoyable brew, glad I have a six pack of this, will get this again and I recommend people trying it that like the style"
"I personally like this beer, though the flavor could afford to be amped up a bit. This one seemed a little on the weaker side compared to some better Maibocks I've had."
"This was the first maibock I had in my collegiate years and for that reason I am partial to it, but I think it is a very drinkable maibock."
"Finally wrote up a review for this beer, I've had it plenty of times but just never reviewed it. Probably because this and the Octoberfest are my least favorite Summit beers. For some reason, those two beers just seem too boozy, i.e. the alcohol is not hidden very well. Maybe I just need a little more hop presence to hide the alcohol, as there are many other high ABV beers that I enjoy."
"This used to be my go to Spring beer. I haven't had it in a few years. Its definatly not the greatest beer in the world like it used to seem to me. Its a decent contender for a bock, but nothing terrific. The spicy flavors are nagging on the pallet and on the nose."
"D: Not bad, but I don't think I could put back a lot of these in a sitting."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight hop, hint of honey, hint of citrus, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy malt, slight hop, slight honey, yeast, grain, and a hint of metallic. Overall, a good body, blend, and aroma, but the metallic hurts."
"D - A very well balanced and drinkable Maibock with a pleasant emphasis on its striking noble hop character. There is also lots of malt character present in this beer to balance out the hops, and while it doesn't finish sweet it is well balanced and manages to avoid the cloying, burnt toast character that some other dry amber beers can leave on the palate. This is not a beer that stands out on the shelf, but it is a very nice, drinkable example of its style and is well worth a try."
"Overall, a wonderful brew, summits second best in my opinion. A much welcomed harbinger of spring!"
"Drinkability: My favorite Maibock. This beer deserves greater recognition; of course, too many people simply do not understand the style."
"I don't have much experience with Maibocks, so maybe this is why I don't like this too much. Its okay at best, but I wouldn't buy it again. I just bought the Summit Spring Sampler Pack, so I only have two left to drink... or give up. This is my least favorite offering by Summit."
"Poured into a shaker pint. I must say I had never heard of Summit but I do like bocks so I picked it up. looked a little pale even for a maibock and it did not smell too good either. It had no bock taste and an underlying taste of skunky (just faintly). Not sure if I picked up a bad 6-pack but Summit I'll be avoiding."
"Pours like a macro lager with two or three fingers of head that dissapears pretty quickly. The aroma is tons and tons of sweet malt. The taste is incredibly sweet with so much malt sweetness its almost cloying. It's a fairly easy beer to drink, but I fel that a little more of some bittering agent would be better for the beer."
"All in all this is a solid example of the style, just in no way interesting. If you're a huge fan of maibock's you will enjoy this, but you will find a lot better ones."
"pours a nice looking amber orange color with a 1/2 inch head and nice lacing i smell malts and hops present and a murky earthy smell ..the taste was a little thin it was drinkable/enjoyable but just not a memorable helles for me i like dead guy better than this one..i would like to try on tap..."
"Quite drinkable, but I prefer some of Summit's other brews."
"D: Great. I wish there were more at work."
"D: Per style drinkability was pretty decent with an acceptable level of enjoyment. The flavor was good, but the beer overall just lacked in other departments which hurt the overall rating. Fans of this style will most likely enjoy this, while the extreme beer hunter might just find it so so. The abv of 7.0%abv is well hidden behind the fruity and sweet nature though I would still probably not consider more then one at any sitting."
"This is one of my favorite brews from Summit. I love it when it is that time of the year for it to come around and I stock up on it."
"Overall- This 1 drinks pretty good but won't impress. Worth a pint or 2."
"Good beer. I wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger on this one again at a lowbrow place!"
"An all-around average beer."
"Serving suggestion: Standard pint glass."
"Not bad, but didn't impress me much. A bit too carbonated and yeasty/moldy. Alcohol is not incorporated so well, either. Okay to sip on one, but wouldn't seek out or buy again."
"Dark gold or honey colored. Wispy head and large bubbles of abundant prickle when poured into the glass. The ""on tap"" was much more still. Grainy nose. Grain dominates the attack. Heavy grain notes in the flavor. Tiny bits of bitterness as you approach the finish. The aftertaste is mildly sour. While I will order this beer in a bar over most of the selections available it is one of my least favorite offerings from Summit."
"Maibocks are clean, flavorful and distinctive, and Summit's version is all that. Totally delicious."
"Picked this up at $4.99 for a sixer. Awesome deal on a beer of this quality."
"D- Well, I can get drunk off these quicker than most any beer, but that is true of most bocks. This one happens to be exceptionally quaff-able and light-hearted."
"The aroma smells like cooked corn and rotten eggs with citrus and honey. The appearance is deep gold with a nice head. The flavor has none of the rotten eggs but does have some corn and honey to go along with a generous amount of malt and hops. The palate is thin but right for the style. Overall I have to say it's one stinky beer that tastes alright."
"D) This is a well made beer in an under appreciated style. With all the extreme brews out there, it's nice to come back to a somewhat simple taste at full volume. I'd like another."
"D - Fantastic drinkability - good balance, great color. Perfect session beer with a good flavor!"
"This is a decent maibock but nothing that really stands vs. others I've had. Drinkable but fairly forgettable."
"D-Great drinkability. One of my Minnesota seasonal favorites. It displays some enjoyable hops and seems relatively well balanced, displaying some of the enjoyable characters of the style."
"This beer just doesn't do it for me. There are some DMS problems. I think I'm not a fan of summit. I don't like any of the beers from them that I've had, and I think I've had 4 even though I haven't reviewed all of them."
"D= average. Pretty good beer but nothing too great."
"Yet another good (but not great) beer from Summit. I almost feel as if there is a common taste in all Summit beers, one that I can't put my finger on, but it is definitely present here. During a blind taste testing, it wouldn't be hard to pick out a Summit beer. Not necessarily a bad quality, because at least they are consistent."
"By the way, I just realized that this clocks in at 7%. That is a surprise, I was thinking below 5!"
"Golden colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is light fruits.Taste is grapefruit and pine with a buttery finish.I am a person who thinks that pine is a scent not a flavor and should not be included in drinks.Overall though not terrible.I would not buy again nor recommend."
"D-Very drinkable."
"The flavor is much more heavy-handed on the hop front, and to me that's a good thing even if it's not exactly per the style. The hoppiness is resinous, piny, and much more bitter than I'd anticipated, but a sweet pale/caramel malt presence balances it nicely. Mouthfeel is superb, with a crisp, light-medium, bubbly body that finishes clean after a bitter dose of hops and slight booze warmth. I must admit, I wasn't exactly expecting much out of this Maibock, but was pleasantly surprised by Summit's brewing ability and look forward to their other brews."
"A nice addition to the Texas beer selection."
"Pours a light straw amber gold with a lot of bubbles and a decent head that fades to a light film at the top of the glass. Moderate lacing, much more impressive than I expected. Tastes of fresh malts and a little bitterness. Pretty refreshing. Definitely feeling the bitterness in the aftertaste. (Burp) Yep, definitely malty. The mouthfeel is pretty light, you can definitely feel the carbonation, but I guess it's not overbearing. A pretty drinkable beer."
"D This is real beer. I bought a case. Glad my wife drinks only wine."
"Overall, this is one of the only summits I haven't liked. I don't prefer bocks to much, but I really didn't like this at all."
"D- 7% is greatly hidden in this summit Gem. This one is just as good, if not better, in my opinion, than dead guy. I look forward to a few more of these until I run out and have to wait until next year."
"Although a well crafted beer, I really didn't enjoy this that much. The toasted malt flavor dominated too much in my opinion."
"Overall, it's a great beer. Complex flavors that hit various spots on the tongue. The hop flavor stays in the mouth for a while. I wouldn't necessarily pound a few of these back in a row, but it is enjoyable."
"Drinkability is very good given the high hop content."
"Easy to drink and at almost 7% a little dangerous. This beer is solid, but not remarkable."
"M/D - Well carbonated and very smooth. A drinkable beer with a deceptive 7.0%."
""
"It was a drinkable but unremarkable brew."
"* Updated for '08 -- no more toffee characters."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a brilliant, clear gold. Very effervescent with two fingers of fine bubbled white head. Good looking beer, unfortunately it went downhill from here. This beer seems to have some fermentation issues. There is some sulfur in the nose. It dissipates to allow a little caramel malt. Thin bodied. There is some corny, dms type of flavor there. Some maltiness, but not enough for the style. A little hop bitterness in the middle. I wondered if I had a bad bottle, but other reviews seem to reinforce my tasting."
"Overall, this is a clean, yet unremarkable, example of the style. I doubt seriously I'd go out of my way to find another one, yet I also wouldn't urn one down were it offered to me. All in all, a worthwhile beer."
"Drinkability: Okay, but comes across as a bit bland. It's just not what I'm looking for in a maibock."
"Taste wise this is a decent bock. It has a nice malt profile of toated and biscuit malt. It is not overly sweet and no signs of DMS that is detected in the smell. No hops noted in the taste. I say it has a medium body with a well matched carbonation. Finishes clean. The high ABV may well catch up with you since it is not detectable. I would never guess it is that high. One or two of these would satisfy me for an evening."
"D: I have not had many maibocks so I can't say if this is true to style, but this is a nice beer, not overly complex but worth trying. I got this a a $.75 single, at that price it is well worth it, I am not sure I would want to pay full price (what ever that is). This is worth trying but not sure I will buy it again."
"D: Nothing really special about this beer...but nothing stands out as bad either"
"Drinkability - this is a decent but not great beer, but it is sessionable."
"Drinkability: Possible DMS problem with this batch provide some real off flavors and the warmth from the alcohol is a bit too pronounced for the style; this tastes like one of those high octane lagers from Eastern Europe"
"Definitely my favorite of Summit's offerings. Semi-dry finish, not bad mouthfeel at all. I think it's a delightful Helles Bock. Unmasked 7% makes it hard to drink too many at once."
"D - A very nice tasting beer overall with a nice alcohol kick. Will have again."
"Nice smooth pour of a golden blond hue with a thick white, fluffy crown. Crystal clear with a moderate amount of rising bubbles. The aroma starts with hops, citrus - grapefruit, mixed with some sweet malt smells. The taste has a nice blend of sweet malts, with citrus and some bitterness towards the back. Alcohol is not really detectable. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is moderate, and the beer is pretty lively on the tongue. Drinkability is also pretty good, though the alcohol will probably catch up to you pretty quick."
"Very drinkable! I could easily see a one liter German mug of this brew!"
"Taste starts out a bit crisp then slams on the staleness pretty quickly. Not refreshing at all. Perhaps the line was dirty, but it was their newest addition. Drain pour."
"I feel bad giving this brew a sub-par score from all of the other Summit's I tried so far. I sure hope it's last years batch, but seeing it just today from a reputable distributor, I doubt it. The salty/dry component is really turning me off. Better luck next time."
"m: light to medium bodied not overly carbonated"
"I did NOT have any inkling this was a 7% ABV beer til I read the brewers info above. So this one may sneak up on you..."
"Not a bad Maibock!! Leaves crazy lacing down the glass and has a sweet, malty nose. The only drawback to this beer is, it can use a little more hop flavoring. Other than that, it is very chewy and bready on the front, and goes down smoothly, very nice. Is deceptively strong. A nice beer for the end of winter and very nicely priced. I enjoyed this one and will be going back for more."
"Overall impression: Interesting beer - lots of good malt flavor. Pretty drinkable for the ABV."
"Pours a hazy orange-copper. Three finger head is creamy and dense showing good retention and streaks of sticky lacing. Toasted Munich malt aromas with a floral Hallertau scent. Vienna and Munich upfront, followed by a rich Crystal malt sweetness and a soft noble hop flavor that keeps the malt in check. Hop bitterness is light in the aftertaste and provides a balanced profile without totally drying. The medium body and mild, fine carbonation allow a robust and malty mouthfeel without being too heavy and keeping the beer on the drinkable side. Finishes with mild alcohol notes, a touch of apple ester and a fair amount of residual sugar. Nice representation of the style."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Nearly clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Faint apple cider nose. Starts sweet apple/caramel flavor, cidery finish is not bitter like it was on-tap, maybe the aging helped. $1.79 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"Into a pint glass, pours a clear light straw amber, with a white head shrinking to a nice film, with lots o lacing sticking to the glass. Aroma is a buttery caramel, sweet malt with grassy hop. Taste is pretty decent too, crisp and clean, surprisingly not as much hops, but a good earthy, caramel malt profile. A fresh body, carbonation is good and a nice medium body. A good ole' local standard for me, get a couple 6ers each spring and summer."
"Originally reviewed April 9, 2005. Bottle at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. I had high expectations for this somewhat mass produced bock and was let WAY down. I thought it tasted like a run of the mill cold-filtered lager. The flavors were dominated by a boring hop sugar and was way too sweet in the end. Blah."
"Drinkability- One of the few Maibocks I have had...this one is really flavorful and quite refreshing. Recommended for sure."
"Pours a light amber pilsner color. A mix of light rust and golden hay. Very faint and sporadick bubbling. Smell is a light yet somewhat sweet malt offering. The flavor is a lawnmower light sweetness with more of an alcoholic kick. Like a pilsber with more toasty notes and less hop presence. But there is some skunkiness."
"Slightly pungent, almost acrid (not sure if I'm describing it correctly, here) smoky aroma. Nice, golden color. My first beer of this style-definitely lighter in hue and hoppier than I was expecting. Like a mild pilsener, almost. Good taste, nice body. Nothing mind-blowing, however."
"This beer is a clear brownish amber color, small head that dissapates quickly to a ring. The smell is a lot like a standard pilsner, except a bit more of a toasted malt with a bit spicier hops. The taste is initially a lot like the smell, but after a moment much more fruity flavors are revealed. Toasted caramel malt, fruity almost like an apple cider, with tasty, spicy hops. This is a dangerously drinkable beer, you could swear it had average alcohol in it until you have had two or three."
"Very one dimensional, lacking complexity. Overly carbonated mouthfeel, caramel malt, and a little too watery for my liking. Not a beer I would try again yet glad I tried it."
"Nice amber body with a short white head. I thought it smelled and tasted a little strong and the 7% explains it. The aroma is off unfortunately and smells like cheap beer. Taste makes up for the poor aroma, which I think may just be the product of an old bottle. Rich caramel flavors with a mild hop backbone. Very smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable beyond the smell."
"Okay drinkability, but lacks depth & or character to session, had potential"
"drinkabilty: quite"
"D- This beer has a light malty sweetness that is not overly sweet but a faint off-flavor. It is crisp and refreshing but not that interesting."
"Drinkability is good. A couple of these are great at the end of a late winter/early spring day. Unfortunately, this may be my last Summit Maibock of the season. This review was made on my last one and the next seasonal (Summit Hefe Weizen) is already in the stores."
"I like this beer, but I haven't made up my mind just how much I like it. This peanut taste/smell is unique in my experience. I'll need to try it again to find out if maybe I'm the one that is nuts."
" It is drinkable, but not the best example of the style."
"DÂ—a good maibock. Welcome, Spring, and thanks for bringing this beer with you. Easy to drinkÂ…would be a good session brew, but watch out for the 7%...it could sneak up on you after a few."
"It is early February, and 19 degrees as I review this Maibock. So here is to the arrival of spring whenever it may be. This brew pours a clear golden-bronze color. The head is one-finger in height, creamy, solid, and long lasting. The aroma begins with grassy notes and finishes with floral tones. The taste is a lot like the aroma; grassy and floral. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, clean, and smooth. Overall, I like this beer a lot. I might even go as far as saying it is Summit's best widely available beer (if only they would bottle the oatmeal stout). It is interesting and to style. However, I have had other maibocks that let the alcohol peak through the flavor and aroma, and enjoyed them a ton. I think this beer would go from being really good to great if the alcohol peaked through a little bit."
"Pours a golden bronze color with a respectable white head that leaves nice lacings. The nose is of sweet carmel malts. The taste is a little bland and boring, not bad by any means, just not much to rave about. It has a sweet, malty affect, and not much more. The mouthfeel is decent. Medium-bodied, barely. It goes down well, and the 7% is noticable, almost seems to be higher."
"I've struggled a little with this review of Summit Maibock. It isn't an easy beer to pigeonhole or to analyze, at least for me. I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but I do know that I've had better and that this one could be improved with a little effort. Improved how? Don't ask me. I don't brew the stuff, I just drink it."
"Thanks to the 'monk for this bottle as part of Secret Bunny. Being from Pittsburgh, possibly the home of the best maibock in the world, unfortunately this one just isn't in the same league. While it has a slight honey sweetness, it just doesn't have much oomph to it and just too much bitterness for the style. Still, I might have another one if it came across somewhere."
"A typical Spring Bock. Light and airy to the sight. High carbonation brings this beer to life. Smell is dainty sweet. Mild sweetness and fruityness with little bittering aromas. Taste is light and pleasant. Flavors of oranges, mangos, and honey. Carbonation and mild alcohol gives a slight bite toward the body. Tingly and fruity. Aftertaste is subtle and momentary. A good safe beer for spring or summer sippin'. You've got to enjoy the subtleties of this beer."
"Poured a light gold color and was pretty clear. Malty aroma with a hint of toasted malt (Munich malt?). Low hop aroma. The head dissapated quickly and left a fine ring of white bubbles in the glass. Malty flavor with a slight peppery/toasty taste that finishes dry. Alc% in the neighborhood of 7% so it finishes dry and has a little warmth to it. I thought the hop bitterness balance was right on for style. Overall a nice example of the style."
"SlÃ inte!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a finger or head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is slightly caramel, slightly buttery, slightly orange-sweet. The flavor is pretty uninspiring to me. Some caramel, butter, and an orangey sweetness just like the nose. I'm not really digging it. It leaves a little something on the finish, not a hop biter, but an astringent character that I don't like either. The feel is moderate wit ha healthy carbonation. Its pretty easy drinking and smooth, but the flavor is keeping it from being highly drinkable. I will pass on this one in the future."
"It's consistant from last year, and within it's class as a Maibock, but not to my liking."
"This beer had a harsh, raw edge that was a bit off-putting. Poured a nice coppery amber with a rocky head. Well moderated toasted caramel malt up front, but then a grating, raw alcohol flavor rode through and left some fusel notes in its wake. At 7% abv some alcohol notes would be expected, but here they were not integrated into the flavor profile."
"Pours to a crystal clear golden amber color with a micro layer of white head that fades to absolutely nothing within a minute or so. The aroma is quite alluring, like walking through a field of malts and berries. The taste is very sweet and malty with only a slight bite of German noble hops in the finish. The berries in the aroma are hidden by the overwhelming sweetness of the malts, but they are in there. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh and the body a bit light, it seems. Also, with a rather high alcohol percentage this is not one of the most highly drinkable brews I've had, especially when combined with a huge overpowering sweetness in flavor. Still a good beer, though. My favorite offering from Summit so far."
"Overall, this is a pretty good Maibock (I must say, the only other one I've had is Dead Guy...). I didn't like it at first, but as I kept drinking, it started growing on me. This is a nice beer to keep you warm on those rainy spring days to come."
"This wonderful elixir pours a deep golden color and has a thin white head that is very sticky. The aroma is dominated by sweet malts , but a distinct spiciness comes through and with the alcohol that comes through it almost has a mellow bourbon like aroma. The flavor is malty and there is a spiciness there too. It is a pretty damn good maibock, by far the best I have ever had. Not a great session beer due to the abv and calories, but it is definitely a good spring treat from Summit."
"This is an easy drinking maibock. When I first tried this, I didn't get a great impression, but I tried another bottle after a week or so and enjoyed it much more. This won't go to the top of my ratings, but it's worth a go."
"Yet another great Summit to be had. Poured into a Summit pint glass via glassware trade, thanks. A good-looking clear copper/bronze appeared with a nice white head and good covering lace. The aroma was sweet & malty. The taste carried that malt theme with notes of toffee backed by a rich alcohol. The hops were faint but a nice spice lingered towards the back. The mouthfeel was great, soft and smooth, a real springtime treat. The drinkability might br alittle sweet for some, but I found it good and rich. The ABV at 7% is a nice bonus as well. A nice all-around beer after a long day or just to relax with."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, orange-copper color, that is actually quite visually appealing. It is topped by a frothy, light tan head. The aroma is spicy and herbal, with malt notes of biscuits, though the aroma is fairly subtle. The beer is lightly sweet up front, with a nice finish that is haunted by notes of spicy hops and a hint of alcohol. There is almost a note of orange here, though this may just be suggested by the pretty orange color. This beer is actually quite light on the palate, and not overwhelming in the taste and flavors either. It is quite tasty, but it is missing a certain solid maltiness that a Bock should have."
"As my brother says, ""maibocks are great, it's like drinking two beers!"" This one pours a clean goden copper with a minimalist off-white head. Good lacing. Sugary sweet bready, toffee malts with a bright, spicy hop backing. Taste is clean, crisp sweet bready malts with a rich caramel edge and hints of cooked monastic vegetables (caramelized carrots?). Nice, spicy hop bitterness comes in for good balance. Finish is warming and bitter. Medium-large bodied feel, coats the mouth well. Maybe my favorite Summit beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" white head above the light amber brew. Lacing average. Aroma is sweetly of pale/caramel malts. Taste follows the nose, with a nice, smooth mouthfeel and a slight warming during and after the swallow. It's got substance, some abv punch, yet remains imminently drinkable, just like a Maibock should be. Nice one..."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light copper color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is rich and malty, slightly grassy. A speck of alcohol on the nose. The taste is very grassy. Like mowed grass with caramel malt undertones. A slight alcohol and hop finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, and the drinkability isn't bad for 7% brew. Not too shabby."
"Another big Summer Cheers to FeloniousoftheMonk for this very quaffable Maibock."
"Pours a deep golden--the head starts out generous then fades to a minimal almost instantly. The beer strains to show some lace and stick, though fails ultimately. Aromas struggle to find indentity, and fight being hoppy, then malty. The beer is having an identity crisis, and is out of balance somewhat. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and offers decent crispness. in the mouth, malt and hop again do battle, and in the end the bitter wins out. The result is an ok drink that never really says....Maibock-hot finish."
"Off white head tops clear deep golden liquid. Grassy and sweetly malty nose holds hints of spiciness. Delicious mix of malt and superb hoppiness mix well. Some light and toasty bread dough flavor pops in also. The finish is nice and bitter, long lasting. I could drink much bottles of this beer! I'm really liking the Maibock style more and more. My preferred beer from this brewery, thanks to CRJMellor for graciously providing said bottle of golden nectar."
"This is a golden colored brew with lots o' little bubbles in the body. Foamy white head that disappears fairly quickly. Sweet malts are the scent, with a grainy backing. That pretty much goes for the taste as well, sweet grainy flavor. Some hop spice, along with some alcohol spice. This is a mighty fine brew."
"Somewhere between Michigan maize and bright-ass neon orange lies the gorgeous hue given to this beer. It emits a simple, nice little aroma -- crisp malts and honey, mostly. Just the slightest leafy, floral hop. And hey, let me tell you something: This is one of the smoothest beers of all time. A mild flavor to be sure -- but let's not overlook this. Light malty flavor that hints at caramel, hints at honey, and hints at springtime. But really, it just is there -- a light-bodied, easy-drinking treat. There's a slightly leafy hop presence at the end, but the malt is the welterweight champ of this bout. A good, true-to-form maibock, no question."
"Drinkability is fairly high, pretty solid offering. Not super complex but tasty."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but one per sitting is enough for me. This is 7.0, and I'd say it drinks like an 8.5."
"Bright gold color with a sizable white head. Leaves a lot of lacing. Smells fruity and malty, almost like bubblegum. Very sharp malt flavor, which mixes nicely with the alcohol flavor. Not much in the way of hops, but this stuff is so good, you don't really miss them. I would almost compare this to an IPA with the malt and hops levels switched. Very good stuff."
"Musty hourse blanket nose. Very clear yellow/gold look with a decent pale white head. Bready crusty , rusty malt flavor with a little hop sting in the finish. Nice and quite drinkable considering the ABV. Medium coating chewy mouth. Cheers to budgood1 for the sample."
"I found I liked this beer more than I expected. Maibock is a bit on the strong side which limits how many of these IÂ’d like to drink, but on the whole itÂ’s a real tasty brew I wouldnÂ’t mind getting again."
"Pours a hazed golden orange with a dense cream-colored head. The aroma consists of a light lemony twang with an earthy grain scent peeping its head. The first taste reveals a sharp bite of carbonation and hops and tapers into a nice ashy malt and light alcohol on the tail. It is light to medium bodied and finishes just a little on the dry side. A very solid tasty brew IMHO! Thanks to budgood1! Cheers!"
"A clear, golden-orange body rests beneath a full head of frothy off-white foam. It dies down shortly, but maintains a very nice creamy cap and leaves some nice lace. In the nose, a lightly toasted maltiness dances with some grassy, lightly spicy, and earthy hops. A touch of mildly fruity yeasty esters are present as well, along with a slight hint of alcohol. The body is medium, and it's lightly crisp in the mouth due to a fine carbonation. Malt hits the palate first, displaying a bready, gently toasted Munich & pilsner malt character. It's quite straightforward, but fairly rich and satisfying. Some floral hop flavor appears mid-palate; and it finishes dry with a firm hop bitterness and light swirl of peppery alcohol. Its drinkability is only hindered by its strength. Enjoyable."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep amber, with little head, and no lace to speak of. Taste of malt that isn't to heavy, medium carbonation, and a slight sweetness in the finsh, with just the right amount bitterness from the hops. I noticed as it warms, it seems to have a little more sweetness and alot more bitterness. All in all it's still a good beer."
"Just a couple of notes on this, others have described it well. First, not poured by me, and showing little to no head, but maintained a ring on top for a long time. Served too cold which had an impact on the aroma (it was hard to note much but light malt). I really enjoyed the flavor. Malt flavor with out being too rich. Sweet quality in middle without being cloy or excessive in other ways. Others have noted it like toffee, which seems close. Seems to have a perfect temp, because as it warmed I didn't like it as much. Smooth and not biting. The impact from the alcohol was significant, esp. with little warning from the taste. I liked this quite a bit overall."
"Color is clear gold, small white thin head of fluff that faded quick, leaves light and tiny spotty lace. Smells of musty grass and sweet malt, citrusy note in there and smells a tad skunky. Taste is mild and soft of malt and has a clean hop bitterness thats a bit oily, has a breadish quality to its flavor and drying with hints of floral character lingering. Feel is sharp at first with a twinge of hoppyness with strange piney drying qualities, is pretty full-medium bodied and has a long lasting coating of creamy butter somewhat waxy. OK brew but is passable to others of the same style."
"Dark golden hue, with well lagered clarity. Fluffy, vanilla white head leaves rough, frothy lace. Lightly toasty, sweetly grainy Munich with hints of grassy hop in aroma. Odd hint of bubblegum surfaces with a swirl. Tame. Soft, bready sweetness upfront in flavor is superceded by relatively assertive, but clean hop bitterness which lends dryness. Malt character is mostly token Munich malt, and is devoid of melanoidin complexity. A touch over attenuated, with a thinnish, but perhaps dangerously crisp mouthfeel. Understated, but seemlessly integrated floral hop flavor. Finishes, dry, slightly chalky, but otherwise clean. Tinge of alcohol warmth indicates respectable strength. A unique maibock with a surprisingly pronounced hop presence. Lacking in malt backbone, but very drinkable nonetheless. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle."
"As it spills from the bottle, a translucent amber color and the head formed is predictable in size, frothy and a light tan in color, as the head desiccates, the resultant a lace a nice sealing sheet. Nose is sweet malt dominated, fresh and clean with the start sweet and nicely malted with a middling top. Finish purposeful in its acidity with the hops spicy and pleasing to the palate, a nice representative to the style, a nice drinkable beer."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this beer."
"A solid but not super brew from one of Minneasota's finest. A light golden beer with bright white head that doesn't stick around. It has a light aroma of malt and a touch of hops. It has a light to medium body holding a slightly sweet malt flavor and finishing with a little hop bitterness. It has a creamy,likable body that hides the alcohol well. A nice seasonal for the warming weather."
"The highly carbonated body lightens up the 7% ABV body a little bit and allows the hops to come through a little more than they would if this were a malt-dominated beer. In fact, for a bock, this babyÂ’s pretty bitter! The high carbonation level I find a little distracting, but I do kinda like the hops, style guidelines be damnedÂ… Also, IÂ’d prefer a bit more Â“decoction mashedÂ” malt flavor to round out the mouthfeel, though a bit of warming, brought out more rounded maltiness than I noticed off the bat. Additionally, repeated swirling and sniffing reduced the carbonation quite a bit, giving this beer a desirable, if manufactured mouthfeel. Still, I enjoyed this beer regardless."
"Thanks to fellow BA Senior for this sample. Pours a deep, clear orange color with a medium off-white head that sticks around only for a short while, and then leaves a sticky lace on the glass. Aroma is full of floral hops and malt with slightly fruity undertones. Taste was full of malty goodness with a touch of sweetness and spiciness. This is one helluva hoppy and medium-bodied beer. It left a slightly bitter aftertaste, but it wasnÂ’t too overpowering. A very enjoyable, well-balanced beer."
"Cheers"
"Taste: A sweet malt flavor with a bit of spice from the hops in the end. This flavor seems familiar. I cant put my finger on it. Over all a Maibock the is a bit above average."
"I so enjoyed hearing people say ""Haimertingen""."
"512"
"I enjoyed this one. Pours well with a lighter colored head allthough not very fragrant. More of a malty nose than hoppy. Sweet malty flavor. It has a copper color and tastes better served pretty cold. This one got me, there must be a decent amount of alcohol in it. I think it's very drinkable."
"Summit Maibock: A nice beer that got rave reviews from the macro-swillers I shared it with. A great looking beer, amber colored with a thick white head that dissipated down to a solid, and very long lasting quarter inch head. The aroma was pleasant but fairly understated. Very nice malts, with a spicy little habanera lick. This was a well-balanced and very smooth beer that I hereby recommend to you."
"it's march 1, the self imposed date before i would sample any of this beautifully copper hued blonde bock. it pours a thin but sticky head, with bits of sticky lace clinging to the glass, backed up with some active carbonation. big pale malt aromas are followed up with some traditional bohemian grassy hop notes. huge chewy malt body. it has a sweet malt, and somewhat soapy flavor to it, followed by a bit of spicy and grassy flavored hops. alcohol is prevalent and warming as it goes down. quite the easy drinking maibock despite the alcohol punch, making it delectably dangerous. i've wavered back and forth on this beer the past couple years, but i always look forward to drinking it. to me, summit maibock signals the eventual end of our long northern winter, and the rebirth of moderating temperatures and spring!"
"She was gorgeous, a golden-orangish hue, with a decent head and nice lacing. Her smell was so sweet, spicy, and somewhat fruity. I just wanted to bring her closer. I brought her to my lips; she tasted heavenly. There was a sweet fruitiness, then I was hit by the spicy hop bitterness. She had a beautifull body. No too light, not too full, but more of a light-medium. As we shared this moment, a felt a warming throughout. As quickly as she entered my life, she was gone. If by chance our paths ever cross again, I will definitly share another moment with her."
"Notes. Tasted at the Summit brewery, I tried 2 of these, and it's obvious, Summit beers are simply put ""hoppy", but wonderful tasting, this is a great beer."
"Medium to medium-full bodied. Low-mid cabonation. Very easy to drink. One that could potentially get a person in trouble."
"Sadly, the name has changed (the Heimertingen referred to a German brewhouse that Summit imported equipment from) to just Maibock...Nice deep orange color and up-charged carbonation.  Hoppy aroma.  Sweet light maple malt tastes.  Slight bittering and carbonation balances the malt and makes this refreshing.  Spicy sweetness at the swallow.  If the recipe has changed I can't tell from last year's notes.  But then, they're just words.  Nice beer but try Einbecker Mai Ur-Bock for contrast."
"Dense white head that sticks around.  Golden color with great clarity.  Smells of malt and yeast dominate.  This is what I'd call a malt monster.  Not many characteristics coming from hops here.  They're just around to subtley balance the huge malt load.  The caramel maltiness lingers long after the sip. This beer just has an incredible malt taste without being sweet.  I think I'm tasting some belgian malts here too.  This beer checks in around 7.5% a/v."
"New packaging confused me and resulted in me buying a sixer of spring beer way earlier than my self-imposed March deadline due to the excitement of finding something new...turns out it is the same old Heimergaten Maibock...First smell to hit the nose was lightly skunky...now after five I can say it it more of a hoppiness rather than a skunkiness...not a tremendous amount of maltiness, but not bad..hops are unique....overall a nice rendition of a maibock...not one I would seek out again, but when grading it out it is solid across the board....dark gold in color with nice clarity...good creamy head with solid retention...tasty..interesting...just not one of my all-time favorites of theirs.."
