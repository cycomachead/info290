3.08,-14.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"This poured out as a golden color with a white head on top. the smell of the beer was sweet with fresh grains and maybe a little honey on the nose too. The taste of the beer was pretty good, again mostly sweet grains and malts. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty well carbonated, it has a lighter body to it and is pretty refreshing. Overall this beer was decent I thought. Nothing overly special here just a drinkable brew.","Knapp85","Jul 27, 2011"

2.88,-20,3,2.5,3,3,3," The taste is not too bad, it lacks a little complexity and there is a mild buttery aspect that I don't enjoy, it seems out of place, mild hop spice and slight grainy flavor with yeast presence in the taste. The malt is pretty one-note and the sweetness level is high in the taste which is almost caramel tinged with a moderately high alcohol flavor as it finishes. I think this is pretty ho-hum, it fits the style enough to be average, but is pretty much a let down in general. I would not go for this again but I have had worse beers and it hides the 10% somewhat. I think the problem is I prefer a lager that comes off a bit 'cleaner' as flavors that ferment out. It seems like this didn't finish and is underattenuated.","Slatetank","Feb 26, 2011"
3.82,6.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkablity/overall- overall i did enjoy drinking this beer, enjoyable flavor a bit sweet for sessioning and a bit heavy aswell, its actually very unique and not what I expected for the style but actually pretty good and nice value for 8.99 6 pack","Stunner97","Jan 04, 2011"

4.25,18.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall, what was best about this brew was how well the sweetness was balanced and contained within the beer. It could have easily been overpoweringly sweet, but they find a nice medium with the other flavors, making this a great, and interesting, beer for the style. As a side note, this beer has been one of our favorites for a long time, and we originally bought the beer, not because of its prestige or prowess, but because of the goofy, fat goat munching on his ""Ram Chips"" on the label. This beer is actually the culprit that got us hooked on Maibocks in general.","TheBrewo","Sep 16, 2010"
4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, malty, small earth and a small presence of fruitiness. In the taste, small hops and a fruity maltiness. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice blend of fruit and small hop presence, hides the alcohol quite well.","OWSLEY069","Sep 04, 2010"

3.42,-5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"You know what, for a bock, I dig this beer. I prefer some others, but this is a nice solid bock for the spring. . Pours a lighter amber. Almost no head, and slight lacing going down. This screams malt. it is a little sweet, and almost no hop presence. It is not overbearing, it is not heavy, though it has a slightly syrup finish. I dig this, it is nice, drinkable, brew.","PSUDREW","Aug 16, 2009"

2.73,-24.2,4,3.5,2,3.5,2.5,"Had it on-tap at Cole's. Malty aroma, big soapy head on grapefruit body. Creamy mouthfeel but then cheesy beery basic body underneath it all. Some sourish taste. Alcohol. Lace lines. Like a malted up macro. Not making the style, and not my cuppa tea.","Sammy","Jun 14, 2009"
3.62,0.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a clear copper color with a single-finger head. The smell is bready malt with a bit of fruitiness. The taste starts off with some very sweet malt that gives way to a bit of dark fruits and some breadiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little watery with some moderate carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable beer, although it may be a little sweet for some people.","TheTrevor","Jun 02, 2009"
3.65,1.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Outstanding label art. Pours a light colored amber with a huge off white foamy head that fades to spotty patterns of Belgian lacing. The smell is interesting; fresh moist oat bread and banana. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium-full bodied and support the rock candy bready and lightly banana flavors. The 8.5% ABV warms slightly but is not distracting.","jjayjaye","Jun 01, 2009"

The 8.5% really isn't noticeable. Head was minimal, carbonation is about right, if a little light. I could drink a few of these.","dborginis","Apr 19, 2009"

3.5,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Touch of fruity sweetness and toasted grains up front. Cookie dough malt and tropical fruit tidal wave take over. Not overbearingly sweet, thanks to some rummy-alcohol notes and a vegetal, herbal hop bitterness that gets stronger near the finish. Still, the finish is mostly fruity, malty, and warming. Medium body with a slightly syrupy feel. Not bad, but a little rough around the edges.","alexgash","0"
4.02,11.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The feel is thick and milky. Smooth with a honey-like consistency. It's a strong drink at 8.5%! Thick and dark malts, a nice spring-y hop respite. A fine example of style.","williamherbert","Apr 09, 2009"

3.58,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and Munich malts. It's a bit sweet with a dry edge. The taste is decent as well. It has a warm, pale and Munich malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good brew, although it's a bit stronger than most.","WesWes","Mar 26, 2009"
3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A great beer all-around. Lots of flavor + high ABV (8.5%) + deceiving drinkability factor = one heck of a brew. Please sir can I have another???","tim9887","Mar 26, 2009"
3.48,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a light bronze hue with a fluffy one finger white head that falls to a soft foamy layer of head. Some decent webbing on the sides of the glass, but not a whole lot of it. Smell is strong in the sweet malt department. Caramel and biscuits dominate the nose with a touch of floral hops and faint citrus. Some spice and sugars in the aroma as well. Taste starts off extremely sweet, too sweet actually; caramel malt, apple peels, and candy. Midway some lightly toasted grains and buttery biscuits emerge on the tongue. Aftertaste has a warming alcohol presence with some pear flavors and a slight nuttiness. Medium body with a strong sting from the alcohol on the tongue, a bit of a distraction. I like my maibocks creamier for sure. The 8.5% is certainly there, but not too over the top. Not terrible, but there are better maibocks out there to pick up.","BeerTruth","Jan 19, 2009"

1.62,-55,2,2.5,1.5,1,1,"Of the five beers we tasted on this occasion, this was the biggest loser of them by far.

3.78,5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall, a nice maibock and quite drinkable.

3.7,2.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear, medium-light golden-amber with a small, white, creamy, quickly diminishing head. Some light stringy lacing. Smell is of moderate sweet grain and fruit. Taste is of honey and sweet malts accompanied by some fruit and alcohol esters and a hint of apricot and cassis. Some light honeysuckle on the warming finish. It has a medium body, slick texture, and very low carbonation. Overall, I havent been too impressed with the other Erie beers Ive had so far, but this one isnt too shabby. Definitely some endearing qualities, but not smooth or balanced enough for me to give it a glowing review. Worth trying if you stumble across it, but not worth seeking out.","ski271","Apr 13, 2006"
3.36,-6.7,4,3,3.5,4,3,"This is probably the weakest of the Erie seasonals, if only because of its sweetness. I had to clense my palate with an IPA after drinking this one","perfectkaos","Jun 16, 2004"
3.97,10.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a quite drinkable brew. Very pleasant to sip, it's hard to resist temptation to drink it faster. Worth noting is that while the statistic on this page says 7.0% ABV, my bottle was labled at 8.5% ABV. Going on the assumption that this beer is 8.5%, I'd suggest it as more of a sipping beer than one for more rapid drinking.","xtacyturbo","Jun 07, 2004"
3.7,2.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I've always enjoyed Erie's beers, having lived there for over 2 years and in fact turned 21 there, so I was glad to give this one a try. Though a solid maibock, and one I'd have again, this is one that could be improved.","beergeek279","Beers"
4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Seven ounce sampler at the Penn Brewfest, pours a deep honey golden hue with a big white frothy head leaves frivilous amounts of lacing behind, very nice. Aroma contains sugary sweetness blended with layers of honey and alcohol tinged fruit notes clean overall no off graininess here. Flavor is great with a perfect amount of sweetness and touch of some German hops for balance that deep alcohol and fruit rounds out the depth of the flavor to form a good example of a Maibock from this small brewery out of Erie. Mouthfeel has a medium body slight sticky texture wow evenly carbonated no complaints I enjoyed. Drinkability factor very high I wanted to go back for more samples flavorful lager that I wish was more available.","WVbeergeek","0"
