I am still sitting with this flowery flavor in my mouth that makes me feel like I just ate a bunch of flower petals. There is too much caramel sweetness in this beer and it overpowers the malt flavors that could have been enjoyed. I would suggest they lay of the caramel malts a bit and figure out a way to reduce the harshness (e.g. don't use as fine as a grain crush or maybe watching the sparging pH).","tophers","Feb 18, 2012"

Smell is of malt/grain, grassy notes, and a light fruity aroma. Taste is of malt/grain, grassy hops, and some light fruit flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip that quickly fades. This beer has a lower level carbonation with a slightly crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel.

This beer does get bonus points for being a store-label brand for a national chain but, even with that, it's better than expected.","matt20102","Jan 24, 2011"
3.56,6.3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"12 oz. bottle with code on back label. Brewed by Gordon Biersch with three malts, Hallertau hops and lager yeast; 22 IBUs. It has a nice deep golden color, filtered, with lots of carbonation and a half inch of white head that settles to a fine froth. Smells rather a lot like Yuengling at first - clean with a few lagery adjunct notes - but it becomes a bit more hoppy and bready as it warms. Tastes clean and malty, a bit minerally, with toasted and biscuity notes while the hops bring a sturdy bitterness, and green/floral, almost skunky flavors. The body is light and crisp, highly-carbonated, and it fills out quickly. The label describes it as a traditional bock, but its light color and prominent hoppiness makes it more like a hellesbock, and I judged it as such. For the price, this is a great beer that is worth the cost of admission.","mmmbeer","Jan 24, 2011"

Not a bad beer - sweet and tart at the same time; a little bit on the tart side for my taste, but it is not overwhelming. Becasue it finishes so cleanly (very clean after taste), you unwittingly find yourself pulling another bottle out of the fridge while watching the football game :-) Finally, at 7% alcohol by volume and just under a buck per bottle (yes, you can purchase as many individual bottles as you want at Tarder Joe's - 6 = $5.99), this is one I would definitely pick up again.","cfrivera1","Jan 08, 2011"

A little spicy bit of alcohol and a grassy undertone add some color. Light in the mouth, clean in the finish. Not quite dry, but highly carbonated so there's not much afterflavor.

And they're great for taking to parties where you never know what you'll find. And, they make great intro beers for the non-initiated as well. But OK... The Hofbrau Bock pours a deep amber with golden highlights. It'd be nice if it was a little darker, but it certainly fits the style as is. The aroma is restrained and clean, only revealing a hint of honeyish malt and a suggestion of floral and grassy hops in the background. The flavor is fuller, of course, and the maltiness is like honey-drizzled bread. It opens up as it warms, and the toastiness really becomes apparent in the finish. It's balanced by a firm bitterness, and along with the alcohol, it finishes dry and spicy with spicy and gently grassy hops swirling here and there as it slowly fades. Could it be better? Yes. A bit more malt girth at the center would really help to focus it, and then round out the overall flavor. But as it is, it's still a really nice, balanced and flavorful bock. I won't say I could drink 50 of these, because we all know what 50 eggs did to Cool Hand Luke, but I could easily drink 3, and maybe 4 of these in a night.

It's a bit sweet, but then rough, biting, spicey alcohol takes over a little too much, along with cooked vegetables and a rough, thin, bland minerally quality. It's not bad, but not really good.

Mouthfeel is medium, with medium carbonation. This is drinkable, but I just wish it had a stronger taste to it. I could drink this now and again, and for the price it's a good deal.

The aroma is a little musty, with sweet malt and a bit of citrus. Medium-bodied and clean with sweet malt flavoring, as well as some citrus and hops in the background. Lingering spicy hops aftertaste keeps the malty flavor from becoming cloying, yet overall this brew is not quite balanced enough to be an enjoyable session beer.

The taste was about above average, not too complex, but still had plenty of flavor. What I could detect was a moderate hoppy taste up front and with a slight malty aftertaste at the end. Nothing too special with the mouthfeel except for the usual light, carbonated, bitter, and somewhat watery mouthfeel. While this may not be the brew of royalty to me, this did make a nice affordable beer that would come through for me if nothing else was available.","AltBock","Feb 07, 2006"

Very slightly yeasty taste gives way to a rich malty flavour backed with a suitably tangy hop profile. This brew isn't outstanding, but it is certainly well balanced.

Taste was along the same lines as the aroma. Very straightforward flavors of malt, hops, grain and some unsweet-butterscotch. Aftertaste was smooth and satisfying. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite enjoyable. A good level of drinkability, this could be a ""fallback"" beer to keep in the fridge for BMC drinkers who frequent your home to introduce them to good beer, yet keeping the Duvel and such from being wasted on those who wouldn't appreciate it.

A little sweet perhaps, but this is a bock, and I found it to have just the right bitterness. Sure, this is a pretty simple beer (not very complex) but this sample was fresh and hit the spot on cool spring evening and was extra tasty from a ceramic stein, but then again I have a soft spot for (blonde) Maibocks this time of year.

Aroma is grassy, slightly floral, and somewhat spicy and toasted. Not bad, but a little weak. Taste has more toasted sweet malts and less floral hop flavor. The hops that were there in the aroma seem lost in the mouthfeel and flavor. I'm only really getting toasted honeyish flavors and a little breadiness. Not bad but not great. The lack of carbonation hurts this beer, needs more liveliness. Still, its really smooth and the abv is very well hidden. Finish leans towards cloying. Still, not terrible but not too great either.
