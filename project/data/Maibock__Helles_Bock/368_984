The nose comprises caramel, light toffeee, light sweet biscuit, and a hint of sweet corn. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a kiss of buttercream and a light layer of sweetgrass. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine maibock, one that may make one look forward to the late Spring, early Summer months.","TMoney2591","0"

Balance is key, and aroma hops to the degree found in American ale styles seems out of place.

There's a bit of a caramelly, cakey, sticky malt, but not too much sweetness. I can also catch a whiff of some earthy hops, spicy, herbal, but not fruity and floral. Smells nice. The taste is good, too. Crisp and malty. This is what I want, noy as dark and rich as a doppelbock, but quite a bit more malty than any other lager. This is still quite refreshing. There's a nice tone of caramellized sugar, with a distinct barley graininess, with just a finish of some earthy leaves. Nice and sticky as it goes down, with great, big body, and there are no off-fermentation flavors. There's a crisp bite of carbonation. Good. I'm going to give this a good rating for drinkability.

Smells like a roasted barley malt blended with honey, and a dash of lemon and hops to round out an enticing nose. First taste is a mellow, rounded malt with some Belgian-esque yeast and honey. Comes to a fairly quick finish where the late hops and citrus bittering linger to round out the experience. Light and balanced the whole way through, but far from the watery-ness you find in some of the more delicate brews gone wrong.

Very nice loking brew. Nose provides notes of toasted bread and light grainyness. A very faint floral hop is there, but not obtrusive at all. I enjoy the big toastyness in this one. Flavor really echos that toastyness. Grainy notes are light to moderate, breaking up the toastyness a bit. I really enjoy the aftertaste. It really carries the toasted notes and draws me back to this one again. I think this one is a solid maibock. Feel is moderate, with a moderate carbonation of tiny bubbles. It makes the brew feel a little more thick than it really is, and I like that with the toasty/bready malt character. This one is nice. It has just enough hop to carry it through, while letting the toasty and bready malt bill carry the weight of the flavor. This one is very enjoyable.

3.85,1,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a cloudy orangy- yellow. Good frothy head that disapates to lacy coating. Taste is toasty to say the least. Malt and barley. A little hops to balance. Velvetty mouthfeel. Seems to have a pretty good alchohol kick. Overall, a good beer for a warm day.","daledeee","May 21, 2003"
4.38,15,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Its brilliant orange-amber body and frothy white head make for a beautiful appearance. The head retention is excellent, and it delivers some very nice lacing throughout the glass. Rich malt leaps out at you in the aroma, clean and fresh. It's full bodied, creamy and smooth - luscious in the mouth. The flavor delivers rich, soft malt that's very mildly toasty with a touch of vanilla and a mild note of spicy alcohol. An underlying bitterness balances extremely well, keeping the softly sweet malt from building on the palate. Very nice! And although it's alcohol content will keep you from drinking more than just a few, you'll probably want to!","NeroFiddled","May 17, 2003"
4.47,17.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a perfectly clear copper color. Not much of a head though. A slight and bubbly collar is apparant and lacing is adequate. Deep malty tones on the nose. Very nice. This just smells bavarian. The body of this beer is damn near full. Feels great in the mouth. The carbonation is just right. The taste is big and malty. I love it. Bready. Doughy. A meal in a bottle. Thick munich malts lay down a fabulous foundation. Hops don't impart much in the bitterness or flavor. Just there for balancing I'm sure. Love this one.","Bighuge","May 15, 2003"

3.65,-4.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beers I've tried from Capital are each part of the Tasting Tour package of eight 12 ounce bottled beers, produced quarterly. I have found their beers to be consistently above average, very drinkable, and lacking qualities of greatness. There is much to be said for a line of beers that can achieve these attributes and be affordable to most beer drinkers. Well done Capital, well done.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 19, 2003"
4.18,9.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice orangy glow with a huge creamy white head, two fingers high and settled slowly to retain a solid haze of bubbles and some large curtains of lace and some spots. Smell is soft of yeast, breadlike dough with hop notes lingering in the back and sweet malt notes as well. Taste is smooth and mild with a small sweet tang and easy bitterness, quite nice. The malt really comes through as it warms which is a nice feature. Feel is a solid medium/light body with a lightly measurable creamyness, an oily sense as well and has a slight zestyness in the finishing hold. One dynamite beer, drinkable stuff for sure, I'd have another in a pinch.","tavernjef","Apr 17, 2003"
4.01,5.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I found this more enjoyable than most others that have reviewed this, but this is a highly drinkable beer. Aroma is a little light, mostly of malt and rather sweet. Almost a corn like quality, although I'm not accussing the brewer of anything. Brilliant amber color with a medium head that settles rather quickly. Really nice flavor of pleasing malt, alcohol notes and a very clean presence. Slight bitterness twoards the finish leaving a long but not necessarily dry finish. Soft and fluffy, with a medium body and adequate carbonation. Could be a session beer but with that much alcohol it would be a short session. I like this.","garymuchow","Apr 13, 2003"
3.58,-6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A brilliant orange-amber body with a very minimal and soft white head escapes from the bottle. The aroma has a pleasant malty nose without being cloying, maybe a slight bit of hops as well. The flavor is a mellow maltiness characteristic of the style with a fading hop bit way in the background. Overall a very nice beer and a great harbinger of Spring in Wisconsin.","brakspear","Apr 04, 2003"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 oz bottle. Plain green label with the Wisconsin Capital. Medium shiny clear orange color. Off white head that doesn't last long. Alcohol noticable on the nose. Toasted malt flavors start the flavors, alcohol brings some heat and thin the body too. Toasted and sweet carmel malt flavors. Alchohol brings a thin light body to it. Almost syrupy at the finish. Definite warming quality to it. A pretty good beer and one of the few I have in the style.","StevieW","Mar 23, 2003"
3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A nice,smooth Maibock from the great Midwest. Bright orange in color with an ivory head, it smells of a sweet cookie maltiness. It is a smoooooth medium bodied beer that is so drinkable with a backround of alcohol. It is malty sweet with a long,toasty finish. The flavors remind me of cookies and cream for the adult in all of us.","jeffboo","Mar 16, 2003"

It smelled fine. The taste was very malty and smooth, creamy smooth, easy to sip and enjoy. Technically, this beer was not that sweet, more of a cracker malt, but very enjoyable. I did like this beer, and I do like this style.","jackndan","Sep 23, 2002"

A little buttery, though. Not the best maibock on the block, but still a solid citizen.","feloniousmonk","Sep 07, 2002"
3.8,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Crystal clear light copper hue w/ a head that quickly recedes into a thin, but persistant layer that leaves spotty lace.  The aroma is comprised of buttery, toasty Munich and a toffeeish sweetness.  Caramelized fruity melanoidins, although mild, add signature richness for style aromawise.  A floral Mittelfruh hop nose is present at a trace.  Smooth, light caramel malt sweetness is followed by toasty Munich and an odd, dryish black licorice note.  Hop bitterness, although somewhat paltry, adequately balanced superfluous malt sweeetness.  Spot on in body, w/ a dextrinous mouthfeel that helps lend good drinkability.  Capital's maibock, although not particularly complex, is clean, smooth, and well balanced overall .  It's well above the norm for US microbrewed versions.  Tasty!","marc77","Mar 14, 2002"
3.15,-17.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This seasonal brew pours with a golden orange color and a foamy head that wisps away rather quickly.  The aroma is of sweet bready and caramel malt.  The strong sweetness of the flavor from caramel malt is very up-front and joined by a quick moderately bitter hop presence.  A little too sweet for my taste, but not too bad.","beernut7","Feb 28, 2002"
