The beer itself was a deep golden-yellow that would make Midas and Croesus envious and cause Greg Koch to call me a wussy. I LIKE beers that look like beer! I also like to bury my nose in my beer and this had a big malty sweetness to it which will make a nice change of pace from my recent spate of big hoppy beers. Next, I like to fill my mouth with beer until my cheeks bulge out like a chipmunk's and let the beer just roll around on my tongue. This method is NOT recommended with Sixpoint's Resin as the beer acted like a hydrofluoric acid burn and wormed its way into my tongue through all of my weak link tastebuds. Here, it warmed with a soothing softness and although it was a Bock, it was not cloying or overly malty. They struck a nice balance between too sweet and too dry. I do not mind dry beers, but style is style, after all. Finish was semi-dry and very pleasant to just sit and sip on a lazy afternoon. The price point was VERY nice and would easily warrant a re-visit.","woodychandler","Mar 05, 2012"

3.66,1.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D/O: This is an easy-drinking strong lager that represents its style reasonably well. It is sometimes difficult to find an American-brewed maibock that does not cross the line of restraint so integral to the German style--but this beer makes the cut. It is the balance of restraint and memorable qualities that makes this more enjoyable than the sum of its parts.","beagle75","Aug 09, 2011"

The taste is quite nice. Hints of orange and floral with a mellow malt back. The hop element is low key and pleasant. It goes down with a bit of a tingle and lets that sweetness linger. It's a nice easy-going beer that would appeal to many.","DesMoinesMike","Jul 07, 2011"

The smell of the beer had a good amount of grain on the nose and some hops. The taste brought those two elements along onto the tongue and ended up being pretty refreshing. The mouthfeel was light and had a decent amount of carbonation to it. Overall I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this beer. I would totally give this one another try one day.","Knapp85","Jun 21, 2011"

All that said, this beer has hope, as it tastes like it was intended to be a MaiBock, but I would just cut back on the bittering hops and use a more attenuative yeast. It sounds like I am doing a homebrew review, but that is the case with this beer. There are no flaws in this beer. It is pretty good, and I am not minding drinking it one bit, but it is falling short of what I would expect for a MaiBock.","SkeeterHawk","Nov 10, 2010"
3.08,-14.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"I was a bit surprised to see this out already, but not enough to turn it down. It pours a clear pale-ish straw topped by a large finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, light corn, and very light honey. The taste holds notes of lemongrass, greens, flowers, light orange peel, and wheat. The first two elements contribute a decently strong bitterness, especially for the style. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.

There is also lots of malt character present in this beer to balance out the hops, and while it doesn't finish sweet it is well balanced and manages to avoid the cloying, burnt toast character that some other dry amber beers can leave on the palate.

Hop bitterness is light in the aftertaste and provides a balanced profile without totally drying. The medium body and mild, fine carbonation allow a robust and malty mouthfeel without being too heavy and keeping the beer on the drinkable side.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied, clean, and smooth. Overall, I like this beer a lot. I might even go as far as saying it is Summit's best widely available beer (if only they would bottle the oatmeal stout). It is interesting and to style.

It leaves a little something on the finish, not a hop biter, but an astringent character that I don't like either. The feel is moderate wit ha healthy carbonation.

The berries in the aroma are hidden by the overwhelming sweetness of the malts, but they are in there. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh and the body a bit light, it seems.

The beer is lightly sweet up front, with a nice finish that is haunted by notes of spicy hops and a hint of alcohol. There is almost a note of orange here, though this may just be suggested by the pretty orange color.

Light malty flavor that hints at caramel, hints at honey, and hints at springtime. But really, it just is there -- a light-bodied, easy-drinking treat.

The body is medium, and it's lightly crisp in the mouth due to a fine carbonation. Malt hits the palate first, displaying a bready, gently toasted Munich & pilsner malt character. It's quite straightforward, but fairly rich and satisfying. Some floral hop flavor appears mid-palate; and it finishes dry with a firm hop bitterness and light swirl of peppery alcohol.

Served too cold which had an impact on the aroma (it was hard to note much but light malt). I really enjoyed the flavor. Malt flavor with out being too rich. Sweet quality in middle without being cloy or excessive in other ways. Others have noted it like toffee, which seems close. Seems to have a perfect temp, because as it warmed I didn't like it as much. Smooth and not biting. The impact from the alcohol was significant, esp. with little warning from the taste.

3.33,-7.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Color is clear gold, small white thin head of fluff that faded quick, leaves light and tiny spotty lace. Smells of musty grass and sweet malt, citrusy note in there and smells a tad skunky. Taste is mild and soft of malt and has a clean hop bitterness thats a bit oily, has a breadish quality to its flavor and drying with hints of floral character lingering. Feel is sharp at first with a twinge of hoppyness with strange piney drying qualities, is pretty full-medium bodied and has a long lasting coating of creamy butter somewhat waxy. OK brew but is passable to others of the same style.","tavernjef","Apr 14, 2003"
3.31,-7.8,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Dark golden hue, with well lagered clarity. Fluffy, vanilla white head leaves rough, frothy lace. Lightly toasty, sweetly grainy Munich with hints of grassy hop in aroma. Odd hint of bubblegum surfaces with a swirl. Tame. Soft, bready sweetness upfront in flavor is superceded by relatively assertive, but clean hop bitterness which lends dryness. Malt character is mostly token Munich malt, and is devoid of melanoidin complexity. A touch over attenuated, with a thinnish, but perhaps dangerously crisp mouthfeel. Understated, but seemlessly integrated floral hop flavor. Finishes, dry, slightly chalky, but otherwise clean. Tinge of alcohol warmth indicates respectable strength. A unique maibock with a surprisingly pronounced hop presence. Lacking in malt backbone, but very drinkable nonetheless. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle.","marc77","Beers"
3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As it spills from the bottle, a translucent amber color and the head formed is predictable in size, frothy and a light tan in color, as the head desiccates, the resultant a lace a nice sealing sheet. Nose is sweet malt dominated, fresh and clean with the start sweet and nicely malted with a middling top. Finish purposeful in its acidity with the hops spicy and pleasing to the palate, a nice representative to the style, a nice drinkable beer.","Gusler","0"

3.46,-3.6,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"A solid but not super brew from one of Minneasota's finest. A light golden beer with bright white head that doesn't stick around. It has a light aroma of malt and a touch of hops. It has a light to medium body holding a slightly sweet malt flavor and finishing with a little hop bitterness. It has a creamy,likable body that hides the alcohol well. A nice seasonal for the warming weather.","jeffboo","Mar 25, 2003"
3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The highly carbonated body lightens up the 7% ABV body a little bit and allows the hops to come through a little more than they would if this were a malt-dominated beer. In fact, for a bock, this babyÂ’s pretty bitter! The high carbonation level I find a little distracting, but I do kinda like the hops, style guidelines be damnedÂ… Also, IÂ’d prefer a bit more Â“decoction mashedÂ” malt flavor to round out the mouthfeel, though a bit of warming, brought out more rounded maltiness than I noticed off the bat. Additionally, repeated swirling and sniffing reduced the carbonation quite a bit, giving this beer a desirable, if manufactured mouthfeel. Still, I enjoyed this beer regardless.","TXHops","Mar 23, 2003"
3.33,-7.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Thanks to fellow BA Senior for this sample. Pours a deep, clear orange color with a medium off-white head that sticks around only for a short while, and then leaves a sticky lace on the glass. Aroma is full of floral hops and malt with slightly fruity undertones. Taste was full of malty goodness with a touch of sweetness and spiciness. This is one helluva hoppy and medium-bodied beer. It left a slightly bitter aftertaste, but it wasnÂ’t too overpowering. A very enjoyable, well-balanced beer.","Scooter77","Mar 23, 2003"

3.91,8.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I enjoyed this one. Pours well with a lighter colored head allthough not very fragrant. More of a malty nose than hoppy. Sweet malty flavor. It has a copper color and tastes better served pretty cold. This one got me, there must be a decent amount of alcohol in it. I think it's very drinkable.","Brian700","Mar 01, 2003"
3.98,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Summit Maibock: A nice beer that got rave reviews from the macro-swillers I shared it with. A great looking beer, amber colored with a thick white head that dissipated down to a solid, and very long lasting quarter inch head. The aroma was pleasant but fairly understated. Very nice malts, with a spicy little habanera lick. This was a well-balanced and very smooth beer that I hereby recommend to you.","jackndan","Feb 24, 2003"
3.78,5.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"it's march 1, the self imposed date before i would sample any of this beautifully copper hued blonde bock. it pours a thin but sticky head, with bits of sticky lace clinging to the glass, backed up with some active carbonation. big pale malt aromas are followed up with some traditional bohemian grassy hop notes. huge chewy malt body. it has a sweet malt, and somewhat soapy flavor to it, followed by a bit of spicy and grassy flavored hops. alcohol is prevalent and warming as it goes down. quite the easy drinking maibock despite the alcohol punch, making it delectably dangerous. i've wavered back and forth on this beer the past couple years, but i always look forward to drinking it. to me, summit maibock signals the eventual end of our long northern winter, and the rebirth of moderating temperatures and spring!","budgood1","Feb 23, 2003"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"She was gorgeous, a golden-orangish hue, with a decent head and nice lacing. Her smell was so sweet, spicy, and somewhat fruity. I just wanted to bring her closer. I brought her to my lips; she tasted heavenly. There was a sweet fruitiness, then I was hit by the spicy hop bitterness. She had a beautifull body. No too light, not too full, but more of a light-medium. As we shared this moment, a felt a warming throughout. As quickly as she entered my life, she was gone. If by chance our paths ever cross again, I will definitly share another moment with her.","BeerBuilder","Oct 06, 2002"

3.76,4.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Sadly, the name has changed (the Heimertingen referred to a German brewhouse that Summit imported equipment from) to just Maibock...Nice deep orange color and up-charged carbonation.  Hoppy aroma.  Sweet light maple malt tastes.  Slight bittering and carbonation balances the malt and makes this refreshing.  Spicy sweetness at the swallow.  If the recipe has changed I can't tell from last year's notes.  But then, they're just words.  Nice beer but try Einbecker Mai Ur-Bock for contrast.","ADR","Feb 09, 2002"
4.43,23.4,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Dense white head that sticks around.  Golden color with great clarity.  Smells of malt and yeast dominate.  This is what I'd call a malt monster.  Not many characteristics coming from hops here.  They're just around to subtley balance the huge malt load.  The caramel maltiness lingers long after the sip. This beer just has an incredible malt taste without being sweet.  I think I'm tasting some belgian malts here too.  This beer checks in around 7.5% a/v.","Bighuge","Beers"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"New packaging confused me and resulted in me buying a sixer of spring beer way earlier than my self-imposed March deadline due to the excitement of finding something new...turns out it is the same old Heimergaten Maibock...First smell to hit the nose was lightly skunky...now after five I can say it it more of a hoppiness rather than a skunkiness...not a tremendous amount of maltiness, but not bad..hops are unique....overall a nice rendition of a maibock...not one I would seek out again, but when grading it out it is solid across the board....dark gold in color with nice clarity...good creamy head with solid retention...tasty..interesting...just not one of my all-time favorites of theirs..","ZAP","0"
