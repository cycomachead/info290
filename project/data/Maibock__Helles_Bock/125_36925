Nice helles flavors, though a bit hot from the booze. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation, fairly balanced. The high ABV kills the drinkability but the brew has nice flavors.","Gmann","Nov 22, 2008"

Taste is malty with some tartness towards the back. Almost like a sour grain taste. Quite a complex taste that has many different cascading flavors. Some notes of banana, some of the alcohol is present at the back of the throat. It is hard to believe that this beer is 10%. There is enough carbonation to cut the alcohol and enough body to it.","jpaltan","Sep 06, 2008"

This beer really tastes ""macro"" to me and could pass for a better quality malt liquor. If you put this in a brown paper bag, you would make a ""fine"" wino. Nothing really jumped out at me from this beer, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if they were using adjuncts...even though they say that ""this is a Bock beer"" on the label. I would pass on this on in the future...and would barely drink it over iced tea or some such.","SkeeterHawk","Aug 15, 2008"

3.15,-15.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear bronze with a two finger white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of foam. Not much lacing left behind, but continuous bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell consists of booze, honey, toasted grains, and candy sugar...nothing more, nothing less. Peppery grains up front on the tongue followed by light fruits (grapes, pears, apples), and caramel malt. Lots of sweetness on the tongue, too much in fact. The flavor could use some hops for balance. Aftertaste is slightly warm from the alcohol and malty with a lingering honey flavor to it. Body is light with a strong carbonation and slick feel. Too much candy flavors and the high abv make this one a bit difficult to drink. Maibock's should stick around in the 6% abv range. I understand everyone is jumping onto the Extreme Beer bandwagon, but come on...this is a bit over the top.","BeerTruth","Jul 06, 2008"

3.83,2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a bomber and served next to a festive jambalaya burrito. Aside from complimenting the spicy burrito, I'm struck by two things with this beer: First, the flavor is too subtle for an 8% beer. Second, this beer is incredibly drinkable. I feel more like I'm drinking some weird German bock hybrid of the English bitter. All the flavors, the grassy hops, bready malt, and sharp bock fruit ester are all a touch muted. At the same time, this beer feels exceedingly creamy in a great way and my bottle is empty in no time. While it's a shame this beer isn't richer, it will also sneak up on you.","tempest","Jan 06, 2008"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"This one poured a slightly hazed, golden amber and was topped by an off-white head composed of average sized bubbles. The head retention was pretty good and there was some coarse, chunky lacing. The aroma was really malty with some grain and crackery character, plus a bit of fruitiness. The flavour was quite sweet and malty and the bitterness was restrained. There were also fruity notes and a tangy, slight tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, it had just a bit of warmth and good texture. Easy drinking for a fairly big beer. The alcohol was well hidden behind the big malt character.","DrJay","Dec 31, 2007"

4.19,12.3,4,5,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is perfect. It has a wonderful pale and Munich malt scent along with a slight bisquity aroma. It's rich with a fruity yeast aroma as well; very nice. The taste is good. It has a fruity pale malt and yeast flavor that goes down easy and finishes sweet and malty with loads of Munich malts. It light and highly drinkable even at 10%. It has a mild bisquit character that really rounds out the palate. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I really don't see much wrong except, I would maybe increase the mouthfeel a bit to make it a bit heavier, but really it's fine the way it is. This is my first Penn beer and it's damn good.

Taste is doughey with malt and a crisp carbonation. The mouthfeel is light to medium. Where is the 10% ABV? Seriously, this is probably the most dangerous beer I have had.

3.06,-18,2,3.5,3.5,2,2.5,"Pours up your standard clear golden pils color with a disappointingly short-lived bone white head that immediately seperated into a thin, soapy collar. Very few streamers of fine carbonation. Color aside, not a pleasant looking brew. Aromas of pale malts, honeydew, light must, and some malt liquor-like vegetal fusel alcohols. I'm feeling that the subtle carbonation is not pulling all the aroma through, but what aromas I'm getting are certainly more pleasant than its appearance. The flavor is mildly fruity with some faint tropical notes, lightly kilned pale malt sweetness shines throughout. Sugar-coated green apple. Alcohol warmth follows each sip. Carbonation is way too low for the thickness if the beer, and is a serious detrement to the overall enjoyment of the beer. I'm not entirely sure that this bottle wasn't shipped and/or stored properly even though it was bought from a very reputable source. I imagine a better bottle would be like Trompe la Morte stepped up a notch. Overall experience wasn't horrible, it could have been piss flat, but pretty close to it. Maybe I'll find a better bottle and give it another whirl. Kind of disappointing because I really enjoy all of Penn's world-class line of beers, this one just either missed its mark completely, not meant to age several months, or was tainted somewhere between brewery and vendor.","crookedhalo","Beers"

Nothing spectacular about the appearance at all, and I was a bit bummed that the head faded relatively fast and left behind no lace. Oh well, so it goes. The aroma is a nice banana nut and clove scent, with some pepper and a faint strawberry/pear smell off in the distance. A slightly boozy, floral aroma, but the alcohol is masked well enough on the whole by the banana clove scent. Not bad. This beer tastes okay. A decent enough blend of slightly sweet and slightly spicey. Again, that peppery banana nut bread flavor is prominent. And the cloves settle in again as well. Light fruit flavors, although nothing really rises up to clarify. Crisp dry finish from a smooth mouthfeel. I'm not sure I would go so far as to call this a highly drinkable beer, but I'm glad I tried it. It's an interesting, potent (10% ABV) maibock, and it would pair nicely, I think, with a fruit salad, or some fruit-related dessert (like a pound cake with fresh strawberries on top). Definitely worth a try.","Atlas1","Jun 27, 2007"

4.44,19,4.5,3,5,4.5,5,"Perhaps the only drawback is it has very little aroma, which is a shame because the taste is excellent. Will be heading down the hill to score some 22 oz bottles of this.","nitehawk","May 22, 2007"
4.25,13.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Were it not for the abv. (which is very well disguised), this would be the perfect summer beer. It has plenty of flavor, but does not taste the least bit heavy or tiring to drink. The beer list at Max's indicates the abv. is 8%, but whether it's 8 or 10, this is definitely a sizable beer. Excellent effort from Penn brewing.","John_M","May 20, 2007"
4.27,14.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - A big, bold German style lager from a brewery that does them up right. I for one welcome our new high gravity Penn beers. :) The flavor is what makes this beer shine. Oh yeah, this beer can seriously hamstring you as well. Alcohol is invisible. And it really is 10%abv. If you see it listed as 8%, thats from the abw listed on Penn's website.","jasonm","Beers"
4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a great new release by Penn Brewery. It pours a pale transparent straw yellow with a healthy white head. It has a pretty light smell. The taste is light and wonderful. Smooth malt at the beginning with some light fruit and spice flavoring. Light sweet malt (maybe honey) aftertaste. This beer is very smooth. I had no idea the ABV was this high until I checked it out after I got home. A delcious new addition to the Penn lineup. I reccomend trying it.","PittBeerGirl","0"
