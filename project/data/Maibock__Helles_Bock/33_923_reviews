"Although a colder temp is recommended, I enjoyed this beer more close to 50F, when the fruit and malt is more pronounced. I also like the style better in an Oktoberfest glass."

"O - I read some of the other reviews and they all point out the malty sweetness of this beer, so I'm pretty sure I'm drinking the same thing that they are, but these caramel-sweet beers are just not for me."

"Overall, this is an easy drinking beer that caters to a sweet tooth. Although, not overly sweet, it will make a sweet beer lover smile. This is a nice beer."

"O/D-It would take a Herculean effort for me to love this beer and it wasn't."

"O: Another great brew from Berkshire. Fresh, good lager."
""

"I've had this a few times now and it always just feels off and way too boozy...I'm usually a fan of Berkshire, this one doesn't do it for me."
""

"Mouthfeel is nice- not superbly refreshing but enough. Medium light body with moderate prickly carbonation. Love it."

"The beer poured anice old gold with a white head a little lighter than expected. The aroma is of sweet malt with a touch of floral. The taste is sweet with a bit of alcohol to it. The feel starts wet and on the heavy side of medium, then goes light and dry as the alcohol kicks in. This beer is a bit different and that makes it nice. The feel is quite unique, and very nice."

"Overall it's not bad, but is nothing to write home about."
"Overall, a fantastic brew, especially considering the price point. This is a great beer to enjoy while grilling outside during the early months of spring when the slightly higher abv and warming sweetness is enough to take the chill off but not enough to ruin its thirst-quenching capabilities. This one also goes phenomenally in a marinade for chicken, steak or bratwursts."
"O: A nice spring beer. Tastes great, almost 4.5-worthy. Quite lacking in smell, and the mouthfeel makes me think BBC just pumped bubbles into this until they ran out. Not to oversimplify, but this would be one hell of a beer if BBC toned down the carbonation and added some more aroma hops."
""
"O - Not BBC's best effort. It has some decent flavors and I really enjoy the honey sweetness, but I found the alcohol to be a bit overwhelming for a spring seasonal."

" There's a lot going on, maybe too much in too many different directions, but well worth a go!"
"Overall: I like this beer, but was a little put off by it at first. My first drink gave me an impression that there were a lot of conflicting flavors in play. However, with each drink, I picked up new notes, things that were really accenting the other flavors well."
"Expiration date of 08-30-11. Sampled on June 19, 2011. The pour is a cloudy orange color with a quick burst of head that fizzles to a thin ring. Scattered sweet malts, overripe fruits, and grains make up the aroma. The body was creamy and in the medium range. This thing ends with an extraordinary sour-tart grainy bite that most definitely leaves an aftertaste. It was a little difficult to drink after awhile but I think it is because it is not a favorite style of mine."
"This beer seems to be another well put together brew from BBC and a bargain at about $4 per."
"Thanks to Sully. From a bottle, pours a clear orange with a small head. Nose is fresh grains, some biscuit, malt, grassy hops maybe a touch of orange. Pretty well-balanced mouth with that biscuit, light grassy hops, some caramel. A light sweetness on the finish. Overall very nice, very drinkable, not as snappy as their Pilsner which is amazing, but a very well made lager."
"Drinkability – This is a really approachable beer. A bit more malt driven than I expected, but solid. Berkshire is nothing less than consistent at creating dependable and drinkable brew."
"Dirtybeerguy.com"
"O - I really do like this beer and I may need to brush up on my lager beer knowledge, but I think a Helles should be a little cleaner and be a little less on the malty side."
"This is a pretty tasty and solid maibock and another quality beer from Berkshire. They really have a nice lineup of beers and this is a solid seasonal and a nice representation of an underrepresented style."
"Overall this is an agreeable brew. It's a little sweet, and I think a more noticeable hop profile would make this more accurate to style, but I welcome unique interpretations of styles, so no big deal."
"I liked this, with a bit more booze and body than expected. Drinkable and tasty, a good fresh brew."
"Pours a nice golden brass color. Very thin head, nice bubbles good carbonation. Not much aroma, a little sweet malt. Flavor is nice sweet maly yet not over sticky. Still a clean flavor that makes a good transistion between a winter beer and summer beer. A nice spring brew. A really nice balance, its at first heavy malts, but it has just enough hops at the end to give a crisp finish. This makes it one you can several of at the relatively low 6.5 abv."
"22oz bottle with a Best By Date of 08/30/11. Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with a thin layer of head. Aroma is bready, boozey, and earthy. Flavor is very earthy and floral. Tastes pretty boozey which is a bit surprising since the ABV isn't overly high. Bready aftertaste. Slightly bitter with a bit of a tangy taste. Overall its a decent version of a beer style I dont have often. Worth picking up once in a blue moon (no pun intended). Can't beat the price."
"This has become my favorite BBC seasonal. At $3.40 per bomber at my fave packy, a steal."
"Nice little beer"
"Drinkability- I could definitely see myself sessioning this in big old steins while I watch the grass grow with my buddies. Try it out if you get a chance. It's a good BBC seasonal (like most of their seasonals.)"
"Drinkability: Pretty solid, but not really an ""all night"" kind of beer as it sits a tad heavy after a while and 22 oz. is probably a good place to stop; flavors are great and a little surprising and quite robust and balanced, though, and I will gladly look for this again."
"All in all a decent, full flavoured beer but a tad too fruity, sweet and heavy for what I like from the style and not something I could drink a lot of at any one time."
"Served in a pint glass, pours a slightly hazy copper color with a nice thick head that quickly dissipated. Sweet, malty aroma. Taste is overwhelmingly one of malt (much to my enjoyment). Almost no distinguishable hops, mouthfeel is a little thick and sweet. A very pleasant beer overall."
"One of Berkshires better beers, imho, which says a lot considering the quality of beer they make. Lots of those clean, soft lager malt flavors. There is a nice subtle spice component that i think comes from the yeast, adding more complexity."
"Translucent golden orange color. Thin dense head that was pooped by half glass. Smells like Triscuits. Triscuits and orange peel. Taste is unmistakeably a well crafted Mai but aggressive take on the style. Mighty hop spice floats atop a peppery, heavy malt sea. Orange zest again--where is that coming from?"
"One and a half inches of fine white foam capped a clear amber/orange beer after the pour. The cap settled over the course of a few minutes, but continued to leave a bit of clumpy lace on the glass for awhile longer. Very malty aroma, lots of toasty grain, a bit sugary, slight fruitiness. Bitterness is solid and manages to balance the malt sweetness (again with toasty, sugary character). Light hop flavour, a little fruity, with a bit of spice and alcohol warmth in the finish. Medium to full bodied, just short of feeling sticky, average carbonation. I liked this one. The malt was definitely pushed forward, but with just enough bitterness backing it up to keep it nicely balanced."
"F: Still very sweet, with a lingering heavy malty sweetness, but no real syrupy sweetness. Again lingering lager flavors with just a touch of bitterness, and a little toasty malt flavor. The sweetness just doesn't go either, it sticks around for a long time. Overall way to sweet and not as much maltiness as I would have liked, but pretty refreshing."
"Drink is more on the sweet malt side compare to other offerings of the same style. Sort of an American twist to style, similar to what American brewers did to the IPA. I always look forward to this offering from BBC in the Spring. Only hope they would offer a big IBU beer in there lineup."
"D: It gets old fast, with all the malt, but that's a personal view. Worth a try."
"Medium body with a smooth, malty feeling on the palate. The finish continues with the thick maltiness with low to moderate carbonation. I wish this had a little lighter body with a more refreshing character to it. The drinkability is a little lower than I expect for the style. I'm not sure I'll get this again this season, but maybe I'll get it again next year."
"Crisp beer. An extreme amount of bite that made my face pucker at first. Nice sweet caramel aftertaste to it to balance it out. Almost makes a syrupy taste."
"Berkshire is one brewery I always take for granted and pass up, yet every time I try a beer by them I never regret it. Solid maibock, though not spectacular, definitely does the style and the brewery justice."
"D-very drinkable, though the sweetness might become too much after a while"
"Feel/Drink: Medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is as good as it gets."
"Overall a very nice and uber malts maibock. Has held up to aging as well."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle to a pint glass. More amber than brown, with a thin head that collapsed immediately and didn't lace. Really couldn't distinguish much from the nose, other than malty biscuit, brown sugar, and very subtle woodiness. The taste was a little more intense, but the body was surprisingly thin, and I didn't get that alcohol essence as I've gotten accustomed to feeling from the better maibocks. The thin body helps the drinkability, but the flavor didn't exactly wow me."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle. Thanks to brothercannon for muling this back from VT for me. Poured into my shaker glass. The lager appears a slightly clouded honeyed amber color with a good inch of bone white head. Nose and flavor consist of a decent amount of caramel malt sweetness, quite fruity, a mild hint of alcohol, medium toasted bread, honey. Approaching full bodied and creamy/slick with adequate carbonation. A fine example of the style. Worth seeking out if you are a fan."
"D: This is a great lager. Sweet up front, but balanced out with the hops. I could drink these all night long. This is my first taste of BBC, and now I'm definitely looking forward to trying more."
"Firm mouthfeel, rich and round. Decent drinkability, but the roughness detracts."
"Overall - Solid as solid can be. The second best offering of the day only behind another Berkshire brew. I would gladly accept this one again."
"Off the tap at The Scuffer this beer was a hazy, gold color with some tangerine highlights. The head was beige, the retention excellent especially as a collar and it left pretty good lacing in thin bands. The aroma was of caramel malt, sweet malt, crystal malt, a background of floral hops and hints if citrus. The flavors were totally spot-on for the style, toasted malt, caramel malt, hints of butterscotch, mild nuts, dry grains and some light alcohol towards the end. The finish, provided by floral hops, was pleasantly bitter and surprisingly crisp for such a malty beer. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy though it did leave a little oily slick on my tongue, the body was medium/full and the carbonation perfect. A great example of what a Maibock should be!"
"Once again, I marvel at what BBC produces vs. the cost for a bottle. Dirt cheap would not be the operative term, but close. Head was bone-white, big and fluffy with fantastic retention. Nose had a light, lager-like sweetness. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a very characteristic honey sweetness on the tongue. Finish was so smooth that I could barely believe that I had finished."
"This had a nice fluffy white head of foam that lasted for most of the beer. A real sweet caramel like taste. It seems like there is a decent amount of alcohol, so I don't think I would drink this as a session beer. A great sipping brew; It is probably amazing on draft."
"A very good beer at a reasonable price. If it's in your area, definitely try it."
"22oz. bottle served in my BBC pint glass. Poured a translucent copper with a half inch off-white head that quickly dissipated into a fairly consistent skim of foam; only a couple random spots of lacing were revealed. Nose is sweet and malty with some fruity esters, a touch of caramel and a little booze. Taste is consistent with nose with a little bit of hops at the finish, nicely muddled with the sweet malt. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lively with a little prickliness on the tip of the tongue. One of the better maibocks I've had and even better on tap. Another solid offering from the guys at BBC."
"Steve"
"D..Smooth and easy to drink. I could have these all day; this is a very good maibock. I recommend it if you have not yet tried one."
"Drinkability: I really feel like BBC is one of those breweries alot of people overlook due to the fact that their beers are a hell of alot cheaper then some of the others on the shelf. Don't let price fool you. This is by no means a ""cheap"" beer. It's wonderfully balanced, smooth and flavorful. I'm really liking what these guys are doing lately, and this one solidified that notion. An excellent maibock that I will defintley have again this Spring!"
"A nice easy drinking beer that has a nice flavor and body. Is smooth and inviting to drink."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth and quite refreshing. Very drinkable for 6.5%, I had this on tap earlier and grabbed a bottle on the way home for comparison's sake. Both are great and I think the bottled version might taste a bit fresher actually (IMO)."
"the drinkability is quite good. it's a just a simple solid maibock that's a joy to drink. i could drink a crate of this stuff."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, was pretty sweet though. I think i wouldnt be able to have a lot of these."
"D: This is a great beer! I can't believe the ""Best By"" date printed on the bottle. Like I mentioned earlier, this tastes like it could've been bottled yesterday. Either an extremely well made beer or stored properly since the minute it was capped. More likely, a little of both."
"22 oz. bomber, best before 10/08/08 and sampled in May '08; brewed with German hops and yeast. The beer is an amber-tinged gold, relatively clear (some particulates in the second pour), with medium carbonation, and two fingers of head that leaves little lacing. Malty aroma, grassy, with a light dosage of green hops. Very subtle, but nice. Rich and malty flavor, with biscuity, grassy and doughy notes, green, mildly-bitter hops, a few esters and just a touch of ethanol. The body is fairly smooth, dry, chewy but not heavy, and has a light hop linger. A nice tasty lager that is very drinkable but with a surprising kick. Another good Berkshire beer."
"It also would be nice to have a freshness date on the bottle, since looking at other reviews, I'm wondering if maybe i got an old bottle? Ill definitely give it another shot."
"A really great Maibock. Pick it up if you have access to it."
"The taste is loaded up malts. The beer is quite a bit more carbonated than is typical for the style, a lot less syrupy and cloying. There is lots of caramel sweet malts, a touch of alcohol in the finish, some slightly off sweetness, and the florals that are typical of a bock beer. There is a little bit of orange burst and some candied sweet flavors. The sweetness of the beer gets much more pronounced as things settle. I'm not getting much hop in this beer, but that isn't the point really. The beer is a pretty full bodied bock beer, at least for the style. This is a nice beer, and has enough interesting qualities to make it worth seeking out."
"Poured into standard pint glass. Yellow-orange color, with a puffy off-white two-finger head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice bit of lacing. Smell of caramel and toffee dominate- this one is heavy on the caramel malt and I love the aroma- slight hop nose and a bit of spice. Flavor is terrific, sweet and malty with a bit of hop in the back end. This is very drinkable, and should be welcome in anyone's cellar and in their glass."
"Had this on tap at The Publick House. It was a hazy orange color with a fairly good-sized white head that left plenty of lacing. Sweet, malty, breadlike aroma. The taste was very malty, with a bit of sweetness. A little heavy in the mouth, but a good beer to drink."
"Pours a nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, some minimal sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, very slight hop, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, some hoppiness, and lots of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is another very tasty brew from Berkshire, thanks Andrew."
"Pours a medium copper hue with a fluffy two finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a creamy layer of goodness. A solid wall of lacing is left behind with a whole bunch of crazy bubbles racing to the top. Smell begins with a sweet candy sugar, caramel malt, and fresh ground pepper. Honeydew melon and spicy earth like hops in the nose as well. The aroma with this is spot on for the style, I love it. Taste starts off with toasted caramel malt, grains, and lemongrass. Once again, sweet, but not too sweet. Hops are hidden, but noticable towards the end with a slight grapefruit bittering effect. Medium bodied with a full creamy feel. Steady and smooth carbonation that fits in perfectly, bliss. This beer goes down much too easy but I see nothing wrong with that. I can honestly say this is my new favorite maibock. Ooh, and the $3.25 price tag ain't too shabby either ;) Definitely pick this one up if you see it on the shelves."
"Pours a clear copper color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly with little lacing, very effervescenst. Very malty aroma with hints of caramel and vanilla. Again, strong up front malt flavor, lemony leads to balanced hoppy flavor, finishes with a smooth caramel malty taste. Creamy mouthfeel with nice drinkability. An excellent American-made Maibock. Bonus points for having a billy goat on the label!"
"Verdict: Easy drinking bock that you should pick up. Perfect beer for the spring as well and might even make a good lawnmower beer in place of a macro lager."
"Had this one in the 22 ounce bottle. Somewhat murky, dull amber appearance with thick lacing. Aroma-wise, some neat smells such as spices, maple, honey, slight florals and caramel. Has a really woody, dry overtone to it, really living up to those maple smells. However, it lacks the sweetness I thought it could have had. Mouthfeel is pretty medium-low. Overall, had some really great potential but was somewhat average."
"D: Very good beer overall. One bomber is probably enough, for a sitting, since this is a little heavy."
"On tap in shaker pint. Slightly hazy orange color with a thin white head. Decent aroma fo sweet hops. Little surprising as I thought this may be a malt bomb. Crisp clean first sip. Nice caramel, or sweet malt flavor, with a good finishing kick. Some hop flavor as well. A very nicely balanced beer, surprised that i enjoyed it as much as I did. Another solid offering from BBC. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was a bit much, but this is a bock, slick coating around the mouth, decent carbonation. Drinkability was good, but not outstanding."
"Drinkability: I thought it was decent, I love this brewery, but it was not my favorite of theirs. I wouldn't get it again."
"22oz bomber with a label depicting the brewers taking a beer break with a couple of barrels of BBC while hiking with a billy-goat(the universal bock symbol). Hazy orange-gold color with a sudsy head. Great swirls of large bubbles on the pour. Tiny streams of carbonation as the beer sits. Toffee-ish nose; this beer smells very malty. Kind of fruity for a lager. Big malt and alcohol taste upfront. A tang of balancing bittering hops add a minor sourness to the long finish. More complex than a German maibock lager as those tend toward clean, one-dimensional malt flavors and minimal fruitiness to none at all. Gotta love when ale breweries make a couple big lagers. The slight variance on the style is fine with me if the result is a great beer. Big lager mouthfeel that is both mildly crisp and slightly smooth.(Did I just contradict myself?). I guess it's smooth leaning towards crisp. Another winner from BBC."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a beautiful pale and Munich malt scent that is rich with sweet malts. It's solid with a nice dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a nice pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finshes sweet with some Munich. This beer is true to style and full of flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good take on the Maibock style. It's rich and flavorful; a good drinker."
"D: Overall pretty crisp and clean with some interesting taste notes. I thought the sweet corn flavor added to the beer. Pretty drinkable. This is my first maibock review so take it with a grain of salt."
"This was a tasty and refreshing beer that reminded me of a springtime version of a marzen. Overall, nicely done."
"Smooth and quaffable. Toasted grain gives off the impression it was dipped in sweet honey as the honey notes hold the brew together. Ever so slight caramel presence. Floral hop notes play a nice supporting role to the honey flavors. Not sticky on the palate, but leaves a slug like trail behind as it passes across the tongue. Toasted grains with a touch of bitterness in the finish tickle the taste buds. Excellent maibock from BBC. Definitely one to pick up if you can, especially for the price tag."
"yet another great brew from the BBC. This brewery is one of the most underated out there."
"A very handsome beer off the pour -- very clear, light amber with plenty of bubbles floating upwards. Dense white head that sticks to the glass and the liquid. Aroma is overly sweet to my taste, and contains a bit of a cooked vegetable aroma -- perhaps this is a bad bottle? That note does dissipate a bit as the beer warms, leaving more stuff in the vein of overripe fruits, raw grains, and light brown sugar. On the palate, cooked vegetables first off. That lasts through the mid-palate, until the sweet-malt bockish tastes finally come through toward the end. Some sharper, more defined bitter edges enter the proceedings just before the finish, which nonetheless stays pretty sweet. Mouthfeel is exceedingly smooth and of the perfect weight for the style. Brisk but refined carbonation. Overall, this beer has some nice points to it, but the cooked vegetable notes just mar a lot of that. I'm looking forward to trying this again and seeing if this is just a bad bottle. If it's bad, this beer has a lot of nice parts and shows great potential. If it's not, consider me disappointed."
"This brew was poured from the 22 oz. Bomber into an Imperial pint glass and had a clear copper color with a perfect sized light tan head that had good retention. Left some nice lacing down the side of the glass, thought it would be more chunks based on the actual head of the beer. The aroma is mostly about the malt which gives it a slightly toasted scent but does have a slight, just enough, hop presence that reminds me of fruit. The aroma of this brew is very inviting. The taste does not disappoint, with its solid malt flavor up front that gives flavors of toasted malts that actually seem to linger through out. A fruit flavor is also noticeable but does not stick out. I believe that this would be flavoring from the hops but could be mistaken, regardless it complements this beer extremely well. Also a slightly noticeable alcohol taste is present and come out more as the brew warms up only adds to the beer. This is another incredible offering from BBC, again I have not been disappointed by their offerings what so ever."
"A pretty well balanced Maibock that is a little too sweet in taste for my palate. A bit of a disappointment as BBC's Oktoberfest lager was an unbelievable tasting Marzen."
"Cheers!"
"Had this brew again this season 2007 and it still is as good as last years. Seems to be a bit sweeter than I remember but still an easy drinking and great tasting Maibock. I will always go for this brew in the Spring!"
"I saw how well this beer had been rated in the past by other BA's, so i felt compelled to try it. Pours a dark orange color, with good head retention, and a white lacing that remained till the end of the glass. Smell was very malty, with some carmel smells, some honey and the slightest hint of fruit as well. Taste was like a huge punch to the face of maltyness...more then most other beers I have tried. The malt almost gives it a sort of warm senesation towards the beginning, followed by a mild hop presence at the end. Mouthfeel was big and chunky, though not necessarily full bodied...I would say more medium in body. This was an extremely drinkable brew...usually big malt presence turns me off for most beers, but this one had a personality all its own. Apparently this style is ususally high on the hops, but this one seemed to be lacking somewhat. This did not necessarily take away from it however. I really enjoyed this beer...Not only did it have a great taste, but it was also a very affordable treat. Definitely worth a purchase. Cheers to Berkshire Brewing Company once again."
"Man, oh man, is this one malty gem! Quite often the Maibock style is under-done, leaving it a bit thin with not enough malt and too much bitterness, hop flavor, or alcohol. The other side of the coin is that they're more often over-done, leaving them flabby and cloying, but still with a hit of alcohol. Not this baby! It's rich and clean, gently candyish and subtly toasty/grainy malt sweetness is evident in the nose (some Vienna malt is obvious), and more prominent in the flavor. There's a light touch of fruitiness in both the aroma and flavor, and a suggestion of alcohol as well, but overall it's remarkably well-balanced. Some mild, spicy and floral hops are present in the flavor as well, but they definitely play a supporting role. The alcohol is noticeable, but reigned in; and the bitterness is just enough to keep everything in line."
"Drinkability: I found the beer a little too intense and thought consuming to be very quaffable, but it certainly held my attention. A wonderful treat."
"Very nice Maibock. Sort of the traditional German meets American super fresh micro lager. A nice hybrid that I could drink all day."
"Thanks for the bottle Pete."
"22oz bomber: This one pours a cloudy, dark golden color with an orangish hue. There was some off-white head that died off quickly. It leaves almost no lacing on the glass. The aroma is a bit thin, with notes of banana and a bit of caramel. The taste is a mildly caramel sweet brew. The body is medium, and the taste is smooth. There about zero hops in this. Nothing special, but still a very drinkable beer."
"Pretty packed with malt and quite enjoyable. Maybe the alcohol is a little too big a part of the smell and taste, but otherwise a well done lager."
"Bolder than I thought it would be. A sweet, deliciously malty bock style lager."
"Bomber bottle, with area on the label for dating indication notches, but no notches, alas, are present..pours typical light almond amber, tan, thick, tiny bubble head and leaving moderate scattered lacing, bold astrigent hoppy nose, notes of sharp sweet malts, clean, crisp and dry in the finish. Typical well crafted brew from BBC, seems all their many beer are solid and well worth a try."
"I havent tried anything else from this brewer yet, but this beer seems to be a good representation of the style."
"Small carbonation in a medium-full body. Drinkable, despite the sweetness, since it doesn't last. Quite a tasty beer, not the most complex, but certainly good."
"The body is fairly light. Could use a bit more carbonation as well. Not a bad beer. I've been happy with the Berkshire products I've tried so far."
"In my quest to try a new and different beer every week, this is a pleasant entry. Whenever I mentally note to have it again, that's a successful addition to the repetoire."
"Solid Maibock from one the better New England breweries."
"D - too sweet (can you tell) for my taste, was hard to drink, did i mention that it was too sweet. good flavor, but wouldnt buy again"
"This is a drinkable beer, my bomber went down smoothly and I could have opened another."
"Pours a very clear copper color with a very light coat of bubbles over top. Nose is nice and bready with light raisin and moderate toastyness with a bit of sweetness running through it all. Flavor is nice. More toasty than the nose. The toasty bite follows into the finish. Feel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. Good balance between the two. I'm really enjoying this beer. Maibocks are one of my favorite lager style, and this one definately passes the test. Good show."
"Yet another fabulous beer from the boys at Berkshire. I love this brew. It pours a beautiful copper, with a white head that left some scant lace. Aroma is malty with some alcohol. Taste is sweet malt fading to a short dry finish. Exceptionallly deep flavor develops as the beer warms. Doughy malt some ripe fruit ... apples? Very drinkable."
"Pours out a hazy amber with a bright white headskie. Tastes sweet at first, but there is more going on here. Nice and crisp, yet body is full. Muchin' down the lightness yet lappin' up the darkness. Mouthfeel is solid and this one goes down very easy. Yum!"
"This lager poured a clear, deep amber color with off-white foam that slowly settled. The smell was sweet and malty with a touch of tanginess. The taste was tangy malty with a hint of sweetness and touch of sharpness on the tongue. The mild hop bitterness came through in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and sharp and dry overall (despite the hints of sweetness). The body was medium with good carbonation and with a tangy finish that mellowed. This was a very nice maibock and was very enjoyable."
"Drinkability-- Malt driven, but it dries out enough in the aftertaste to make you want more. A great overall beer."
"mouthfeel: this is the beer version of 0 calorie fruit-flavored water. essential flavors burst in the mouth, but it goes down easy and light.. would be the supreme summer session beer for me if it was more available here. summer staple. yeah."
"Drinkability: Well, I'm on my second log this month. I can't stop drinking it, really. Nicely done, like a beefed up version of their O-fest."
"Pours a brownish, dark amber with a short creamy head, moderate lacing. Also, mildly effervescent. Aroma is a little subdued with creamy malts, moderate hops, and grassy wheat notes. Taste follows with a solid foundation of malts, a nice balance of hoppiness, and slight fruitiness. Goes down nice and smooth, especially for a lager. Unique and enjoyable."
"I've always liked this beer. Every spring I can't wait til I head to the package store and see it in the cooler. I always buy a few. Appears a light golden color with bubbles and some nice swirly head on top. Smell is very fragrant. Nice and springy, like a flower. Sweet malty notes with a really nice specific smell that I can't exactly put my finger on but I want to say it smells like apples or cider with some candied sugar. That taste is also very present in the taste. Sweet, but that's what it's supposed to be. Doesn't overwhelm though, and I usually don't like beers on the sweeter side. Smooth and creamy but light mouthfeel and super easy to finish a bomber of this stuff. Glad it's back on the shelf."
"Excellent beer."
"Deep gold color. Reasonably clear with a 1 inch white head that settled quickly into the beer. A host of champagne bubbles rises from the bottom of the glass in an attempt to renew the head. The nose has a nice malty character with just a mild doughy finish. The taste has a sweet malt up front, the doughy character arrives in the middle of the flavor. There is some citrus in the flavor provided by the hops. Mouth feel is good, it has a carbonated character. This is a good Maibock, and reminds me of my most recent brewing experience. It's very drinkable."
"A clean amber beer with a bubbly off white head. A grainy biscuit like aroma not very strong aroma. The malty sweetness has a light fruityness in the background. A quick brush of bitterness and then an alcohol warmth settles in on the back of your tongue and eventually warms your tummy. Very close in flavor characteristics to some Octoberfest beers that I have had."
"orange color with fluffy white head. strong smell of alcohol, cheap adjunct laden lager smell with also hints of cherries/oranges. taste follows through with aundance of alcohol, slightly unblanced but not horrible. for some reason i taste dark cherries, but this kind of surprises me, it must be something else but my head is telling me it is cherries.light bodied and dirnkable on a hot summer day."
"Pours a dark gold with a thin one finger head. The aroma is fairly subtle. It seems to have a soft malt aroma. I pick up some odd apple notes, strangely enough. The taste is a fairly straight forward bock. No hops to speak of. It has a strong malt background with some dark fruit flavors blending in. It's a very nice tasting beer, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of complexity. It goes down very easily, even at 6.5% ABV. The mouthfeel seems fairly full. The carbonation is probably a little below average, but it suits this beer well."
"Drinkability: I'd say medium to medium high, it's the kind of beer you can really take your time and enjoy! I liked this and would buy it again,very unusual, but I like most of BBC's products. Cheers!"
"Notes: Malty, malty and malty. For a brewery that specializes in ales they sure know how to go around and make a down right kick ass lager. Three cheers for Berkshire to have the audacity to brew an awesome Maibock."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 1/2"" slightly off-white head above the copper-hued brew. Aroma is sweet and doughy, the taste is heavy malt upfront, with a sweetness that carries smoothly on through to the very slight warming feeling as it goes down the throat. The same sweetness that makes the mouthfeel a little better knocks the drinkability down just a bit, it might get a bit over the top after a bit. All in all, a bit more hearty than what I would expect from a Maibock, and that's just great!"
"My first sip reveals average body with a very fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is similar to the aroma, malty sweet with caramel coming in up front but a slight earthy hop presence on the finish. THe beer is very easy drinking, smooth, and refreshing. Quite a tasty brew, that I will hopefully enjoy again this spring."
"Flavor is big and powerful. A very full bodied, malty, sweet, and tasty lager beer. Hops are nonexistent, providing a touch of dryness to the finish. Mild caramel and plum, moderate carbonation. Not quite as smooth as I'd prefer, but not half bad. Altogether a well done beer."
"I've enjoyed a number of Berkshire products but this may be my new favorite. I suspect it may be solely a spring seasonal but hope it might be distributed throughout the year as Stoudt's and certain other brewers do with their MaiBock. This one has the right mix between sweetness and bitterness to make it a beer you could drink over the long term despite its relatively high alcohol content. Nice golden amber color with a lasting head. Has a great mouthfeel and no unpleasant aftertaste. Bottled only in 22 oz. bombers which are freshness dated as Berkshire does not use 12 oz. bottles. Next time I'm in western MA I'll definitely try to repurchase it if it's still available depending on whether it's not a seasonal whose time has passed."

"Pours a good off-white head leaving a little lace. Pale amber color. Good malty nose, light to medium bodied. Sweet malt first, finishing very clean. Hops stay in the background and most noticable at the finish. Smooth and very drinkable. The ABV is 6.5%."
"Brown bomber.Freshness date notched best before September.Average appearance nothing too special.Poured a white head that didnt laste too long.Left trace amounts of lace.The color is an clear amber.A very good candy-like sweet aroma.Mouthfeel was kind of flat not crisp at all.A medium bodied lager with a touch of bitterness that lingers in the throat for just a second.Somewhat watery mouthfeel.Taste and Aroma are very good but texture and carbonation needs some work.Sweet fruit or candy-like taste.A hint of wheat on the finish."
"A damn fine brew. Malt is a bit over the top for the style, but for me it's just fine."
"This is a great beer, I only wish I had tried this in February or March instead of July."
"Deep copper with a tight white head, strong fruity aroma reminiscent of sweetbread and strawberries. Huge malty taste, bready, crackery, incredibly sweet. Large kick of alcohol right from the get-go, but it is kept in check (mostly) by the syrupy, delicious malts. Elements of honey and honeydew melon as the flavor deepens. A fresh crackle is common to BBC's beers, and certainly part of the profile here, but any trace of hops is scarcely noticeable. Rich, luscious, and strong; almost like a barleywine without the hops."
