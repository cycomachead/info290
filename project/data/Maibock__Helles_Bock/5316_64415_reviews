"When I hear the word bock, my expectations are very high. There was nothing too exciting about this brew, however it goes down really smooth for 7% ABV."

"Overall: This beer is nothing outstanding but is a worthy one to try, especially in the summer on the hot day. Pairs extremely well with fried fish."

"If nothing else, the LTD's are a series that are always welcomed, if not for their brilliance, then for their timeless consistency."

"Overall: I don't see why they don't call this a Imperial Pale Lager, rather than a Pale Bock. There's no Bock in it IMO; nonetheless, it's a really good beer. It's nearly WOW, but not exactly wow. I like that it's low in bitterness but still has enough bite and growl to keep the pale ale from being too much. It's a goo.d beer, but I'm disappointed only due to the name. I got a 4.3 of 5"

"O- I wish that more lagers were like this one. Thoroughly enjoyable, very drinkable, excellent aroma, not too filling."
""
"Overall its a pretty good helles lager but I would prefer other takes on the style. Not bad though."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of grassy hops and bready malt. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of grassy, spicy hops and bready malt. Finish is long, dry and spicy. Good, balanced brew."
"Overall an OK Helles Bock."
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent malty brew with a fair level of bitter and sour flavors. Not bad, and well worth a try but nothing super exceptional."

"overall, it's okay. nothing special. but if you're using this 7%er as a session beer, you're doing very well.... it's easy to drink, although a bit 'twang-y', and not bad I imagine if you've purchased a 6'er and heading home... just don't get too buzzed and beat the girlfriend.... but it is a very decent brew. not my favorite style, but still a very decent brew... aside from the stout, I think I need to see what else this brewery has to offer..."
"Overall, a very good, tasty brew, taste is a little sweet, but some clean hops to balance, moutfeel is also a bit crisp; still a very tasty brew and solid helles/mai-bock. Quick edit - noted the pale malt used instead of pilsnen, could be why the sweeter flavors."
"Overall: Although there is some diacetyl and a sweetness that may indicate some corn in the grist, this is a readily drinkable brew"

"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall I think it wasnt bad but there were a lot of strange things going on in this that hinted towards bock but with a strange twist. A bit over-hopped, a bit more alcohol driven and lacking in the overall body one might expect. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to try this one Matt, thanks again."

" The flavor is pretty layered considering this is a commercial equivalent of a SMaSH -single malt and single hop maibock -pale malt and willamette hops. The hops are a bit forward in the flavor and the yeast adds some flavor with spiciness accentuated by the moderately high alcohol in the taste. The malt is toasty and slightly thick with low sweetness and generally grainy when combined with the yeast drying alcohol and hops. Overal this is decent but there are better examples of this style from East Coast brewers or Midwest breweries, but for the price it is a better than average pale bock."
""
""
"It has the lighter and better parts of a bock; great if you aren't keen on the heavy sweetness of a traditional bock."
""
"The Verdict: Good stuff. A tasty, well-balanced pale bock that I managed to snag the last couple of bottles of. The LTD series is hit or miss like many seasonals, though it’s usually a hit. This one is definitely a hit."
""
""
"Overall- Nothing spectacular, just a solid brew. I give it a straight up B-"
""
"O - Light and sweet, not very good compared to others in the series."
"What do you get when you nearly invert the bottle when decanting into a shaker glass? A massive three fingers of dense, eggnog-colored head with great retention. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity and suddenly King Midas and Croesus appeared in my kitchen, both licking their chops. The lacing that formed as the head dropped made my jaw drop. My my my. Nose had an unexpected earthiness accompanied by a caramel maltiness. Curiouser and curiouser. ""Drink Me!"" it cried to me. What sort of host would I be not to comply with the wishes of an invited guest? Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness, and I got a bit of heat from it as I swirled it on my tongue. The taste was very earthy with a flavor that I imagine standing in a field of barley in central Canada in the summer would be like. I have been getting smarter about distillation and I would bet that this recipe in a still would create a great single malt whiskey. The inherent heat on the finish made me gasp for breath but overall, it was semi-dry."
"O/D - A beer that doesn't have that much identity between a lager and a ale. Seems to have the malts and hops of an ale and the yeast / carbonation finish of a lager."
"O - very good beer, easy drinking, not too strong. GREAT session beer."
""
"O: Unfortunately, I dont think I'll be purchasing this beer again. It has a great appearance and an easy-drinking mouthfeel, but its taste leaves something to be desired. For one, it's too hoppy for a Pale Bock. Full Sail lists this beer as having 45 IBUs, which is just too high for the Bock style (which should be around 20-30 IBUs). If youre a hop-head, you'll like this rendition of the Bock style, but it's just too hoppy for me. Secondly, I get pronounced hits of butter/diacetyl flavors that just dont belong in this beer. The butter notes mixed with the hops isn't pleasing after the first few sips."
"It's a tasty brew. I would say if you're a helles bock lover, try this one. It's a bit of a shock if you're expecting a pale lager (BMC drinkers probably will be intimidated by the abundant flavor)."
""
""
"Not quite a bock I suppose, but not fully an Am. lager either."
""
"A well done pale lager. Easy drinking with an enjoyable malt and hop character. Proves that this style can be flavorful and something worth drinking."
""
"A tasty, well done lager. Clean, bright, crisp, and balanced. Great spring beer."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine one finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit and bready malt, light grassy hops; slightly sour. Flavor is bready malt, grassy hops and hints of light fruit juice and nuts. An odd flavor combination, but kind of grew on me as I drank this. Medium bodied. An interesting malty ale. I have to say the BA style of American pale lager is much more apt than the bottle's label of ""pale bock"". This is not very close to a bock, but enjoyable."
""
"Overall, I really like this beer for its near perfect simplicity and balance."

"O:  Crisp, complex malts, earthy and clean with a gentle punch of alcohol to keep things interesting. Not your typical low ABV lager this has depth but at the same time is not over done. Full Sail seems to do lagers well. "
"A decent enough beer, semi close to a pilsner taste which really isn't in my wheelhouse, but worth a try."
""
""
""
"Still, considering all factors, this is an above average beer product. I like the snappy hop character and it easily outperforms most all American- style lagers. It is worth a try if you happen to find a bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Ugh. I was wrong. I hate it when beer scents trick me like that. The beer's not bad, it's just not what it smells like and it's not at all astounding. The bite is quite nice. I like the alcohol level. And I like the grain, but as I often do with American crafts, I think it's too covered by hops. Tastes dry-hopped. The apricot flavour imparted by the hops sounds nice. And I'm glad it's not overly resinous, but I do think it would be better with less of it. As it stands, it's an OK beer. I'm not at all impressed with it."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a light amber with a little head, but has lacing down the glass. Smells heavily of a roasted malt, very nice full aroma. Tastes of lightly roasted grain with a slight fruity taste, a nice surprise. This light bodied beer goes down real smooth and has perfect carbonation. Overall a great beer."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a 1/2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some floral hop aromas. Taste is of malt up front with some floral and perfume-like hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but not something I would get again."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, I've had this one in the fridge for a little while so I'm not sure how fresh it is. Anyways this pours a light golden color with a small semi short lived white head. The smells are of crisp grassy hops, a little sweetness and malts. The feel is medium. The taste is more bitter than expected, followed by some strong malts, along with a strong alcohol presence."
""
"Overall - It's an average tasting lager that's held back by an unbalanced flavor and an even more unbalanced palate feel. I wouldn't recommend buying this"
""
"The lager-hating community should give this one a shot. I was pleasantly surprised."
"O - neither horrible nor spectacular"
""

"More character than your standard American lager, but nothing to write home about. Fairly easy drinking."
""
"excellent bang for the buck here. 8 dollars for a 6pack at 7% abv. i like that. smells malty but not to the vienna lager levels, more pale malty and crisp in the nose. flavor is nice, definitely malt driven and complex. i taste something a touch sweet, caramel maybe. feel dragged for me in this beer, the body was a bit heavy and rather filling, even though the flavor was good. i was happy to share my 6er because it would have ruined my appetite for dinner. overall another worthy beer from full sale, and at that price i may buy it again, but it wasnt anything particularly memorable."

"Taste-Grain, sweet toasted malt, warming alchohol finish. A little more character than your average American pale lager, but still nothing exceptional here."
"Pours a yellow lager with little head production and anticipated clarity - excellent. (3) Smells of earthy hops with a hint of skunkiness. Not much going on the nose here, not impressed. (2) Flavor is interestingly grainy - theres a hint of what I can only describe as clam juice aftertaste mixed with a little wood. I’m not necessarily put off by this, alas, I keep taking another sip to see if I can’t dissect. Interesting. (3.5). Thin with moderate carb and a mouthwatering finish. (3). An interesting tasting beer, but not something I would recommend, but something I would certainly pair with a good cioppino or Manhatten clam chowder. (3)"

""
"This is a nice enough beer to sip on. It's certainly well-constructed. I doubt I'd be inclined to drink it often, but I'd glad to have tried it."
""
"D - It's built well and is a pleasure to drink, but lacks any character that makes it memorable. I appreciated the simplicity, but I think there are better offerings from Full Sail."
"o - This was the beer of the month at Zipp's which makes it less than 6 bucks a sixer. At that price, this would have a regular spot in my fridge. Otherwise, it's something that I'd get every so often. A nice lager."
""
"O - A really nice, simple and well made lager. Nutty in the best way, strong while not tasting like it. Gentle bitterness, and a lot of flavor considering it's SMaSH status. A really great, easy drinking lager that I look forward to every year."
"Overall: Great lager against the likes of the big name adjunct lager/pilsners. I dont drink lagers often but when I do pick one up its nice when it has flavor like this."
""
""
"For the style this is a winner. Balanced with a semi-dry hopped finish."
""
"O: Too bad this is a one-timer, in fact, too bad the limiter lager series was a one-off -- I like pretty much every one of them, and No. 4 is no exception. A substantial, bready, malty lager with a crips sulfuring, herbal hoppy finish. Great job, Full Sail and keep the lagers coming!"
"I actually poured one and a half bottles into a half liter stein,a clear light to medium golden with a nice fluffy white crown atop.Toasted grain and a sweetish pizza dough quality in the nose,a tinge of iron and sweet alcohol round out the aromas.Bready/doughy malt is the main player on the palate with the mouthfeel almost to the chewey point for me wich is pretty cool,there is a peppery hop presence felt in the finish.Hey this is a kick ass lager,in some ways it has a pale bock quality to it but it's not a pale bock it's just a well made ""big"" American lager beer.Well done Full Sail on this one."
"Overall: a very good 'single malt' beer that nicely blends its unique single malt base without overpowering one with hop aroma and bitterness nor overbearing alcohol warmth (despite its 7.0% ABV)."
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer has some flaws, but in general I quite like it. Even though the categories have changed from the old days, I'm giving this a 4 for drinkability."
"If you want a solid lager that is going to deliver exactly what is advertised, you should definitely give this one a try."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. Thought it was tasty, easy to drink and good presentation of the style. Would try again"
"I'm not impressed with the no. 4. To me it's like a high alcohol Bud."
"Overall: Not very impressed with this beer. It has a interesting front to it that is a bit off putting. The backend is ok but not good enough to want to drink it again"
"Overall: An interesting beer with a lot of drinkability. It's very much like a helles bock; and certainly well made. The floral/woody/minty hops and rich malt are compelling, but it's also very basic. It's easy to just drink it and be satisfied without focusing on any complexity or nuances. A perfect beer for spring. I could get used to this... except that it's limited!!!"
"D: Good drinkability, a 7.0% that drinks more like a 5%. Very easy to down, enjoyable in multiples with much respect per style. A great summertime lager for that backyard gathering. I could go case here for fans of style. Session downer and a reminder this is a pale lager, not an apa or ipa. Good amount of hops per style and easy drinking nature."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is straw yellow with a medium white head, nice lacing. The aroma is sweet grass. The beer is light and easy drinking, clean finish. The body is light, well carbonated. A very well crafted lager, surprised that it is 7%."
"This beer is more or less Stroh's without corn, upped to 7% and with more finishing hops. I don't mean it as an insult, because Stroh's is my favorite cheap beer. I bought this at a deep discount, but if I'd have payed full price, I'd be pissed."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grassy hops and a lot of grain. Not really very exciting, but nothing offensive. The flavor is the same as the aroma. I get a lot of grain and grassy hops, with a little bit of earthy hops also mixed in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Easy to drink, but nothing very exciting."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This beer reminds me of a lighter version of a malt liquor. It is a good beer, lots of flavor and easy to drink."
"I think this is a terrific lager, though as strong as it is I wonder if there is another category for it. I would compare this with a golden bock, like the one from Karl Strauss."
"Overall this is a solid beer. spot on for the style. this is a little boring for me, but it's very easy to drink. it goes down like 7% ABV is the new 5%."
"Another limited-release lager from the PNW; yellow does not have to mean fizzy and flavorless. Bubbly, sticky lacing with a shiny golden-yellow hue. Clean and dry malty nose that leans more toward fresh-baked bread with a spicy, woody hoppiness to round it out. Not lacking in crispness, it refreshes the palate with each sip. Hops run at the palate in a bold manner, yet leave more than enough wiggle room for the malt to plant a thick grainy flavor. Alcohol does not pass by without notice; warmth meshes with the spiciness of the hops. Bitter, dry finish. A tamed monster of sorts--a fun 12 ounces with a bit of attitude."
"UPDATE 3/27/12: Pretty much the same as last year's batch. Toasty in the aroma, big bready caramel in the flavor. Great lager."
"This is a drinkable pale lager. Interestingly malty with surprising spicy characteristics."
"D: Good drinkability. Very light and very clean."
"M,D- A light bodied and crisp light lager that is not offensive and not showy. It does it's job and for that, it's worthy. Just drink it up quick, these LTD's fall off quick, especially off a warm shelf in Jersey."
"You could quaff this for a long time. Very good beer. I wonder if this isn't like what macrolager would be like without the adjuncts."
"Pretty basic crisp pale lager, with some depth, with straw color, and some pine and lemon notes, leaving a residual bitter mouthfeel. No aroma of any significance, good or bad. Much higher quality than a Bud or Coors, but of the same family. You don't have that corn aftertaste though. I'd like to have a few more of these in the summer."
"D: This is really a craft malt liquor, in that Euro Strong Lager category, all malt. For it's ABV it's cheaper than BMC, it's OK, but there's better in the LTD series."
"Dr: I'd have it again but not at this price. It hides its 7.00& very well, which in fairness is high for an American lager. The alcohol does come through a bit in the finish."
"D - goes down easy but it's up there on the abv so enjoy this beer in moderation."
"Finger and a half frothy white head, medium dissipation with above average lacing. Light gold clear body, multiple trails of carbonation rising up from bottom of glass. Dry bready malts dominate the front of the aroma, some sweetish malt in the middle packed up by floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, a bit sweet but not an adjunct corn taste ala BMCs, a surprising amount of bitterness on the back end which got more aggressive as it warmed. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, decent effervescence. A bit hoppy for the style, which is good. Not something I'd drink a bunch of given relatively high ABV, but worth a try."
"Drinability is good. This is a very nice lager. A little on the heavy side when it comes to flavor and ABV, but it's still a pleasure to drink."
"T: Like the smell, a lot of malts. This beer is nice and simple and I like that. Easy to drink, but not a ton going on here. To me, this one is about the same quality as the rest of this series. Good, but not great."
"Still, for such a basic beer I'd rather not have the hit of 7% ABV. Tone it down to around 5% and I'd go back for several."
"Overall a well balanced lager, I find it difficult to say if it has more of a malty or more of a hoppy taste. And I guess that is a good thing."
"Drinkability: this beer was very easy to drink despite the higher alcohol levels for a lager. Nice refreshing flavor - a few can be had in a session."
"Pours a nice clean/clean pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, with a slight hop note. The taste is very nice, malty, sweet, with some hop notes. Medium Body. Drinkable, a very nice brew, this is what the macro's should achieve for."
"D: The beer packs in a surprisingly good amount of flavor considering it's made with just a single malt and a single hop, yet there's no way that I could have more than one of these in a sitting."
"D- Pretty tasty brew. I was really excited about a commercial SMaSH beer."
"Despite the simple and straightforward take here, this was still flavorful, crisp, and ridiculously easy drinking for the size. I don't think that I've had a 7% beer as ""sessionable"" as this one was in quite some time. Count me in as a fan."
"D: This came across as a nice halfway point between a Pils and in Imperial Pils. It was a nice compliment to a cool winter evening."
"For a single malt single hop beer, this is a really nice one."
"Pour 1/2 bottle LTD #4 into a frosty pub glass, then add 1/2 bottle Full Sail Session Lager. You won't notice the alcohol nearly as much. And the flavors blend perfectly!"
"Knowing the dependability of full sail, I bought a 6 pack of this to share with a few friends, some of whom have some interest in beer. This is different than most American style pale lagers I have had, so it is a fun a d different change from a cool local brewery. All I can say is that I wish I had jumped on the LTD train earlier. This pours an amber color with a 1"" white head that slowly dissipates, leaving some lacing. Smell is of grain and some hops. Taste is primarily a light sweetish malt followed by those wilamette hops. I am especially impressed that this was made using only one kind of malt and one variety of hops. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation. This beer drinks easily enough, but I'd avoid sessioning at 7ish percent ABV."
"D: Drinkable despite the high ABV. I enjoyed the prior LTD versions more than this one. Don't think that I will seek out again."
"Full Sail Brewing Company--Full Sail LTD Series--What Do You Get When You Brew An Elegant Limited Edition Lager With One Select Barley? The Single Malt Of Suds-Recipe Number: 04. 2011 12 oz. Bottle. 7.00% ABV. 45 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) MaiBock? Thin lace thin white head. Clear thin bright yellow gold color. Sweet mellow floral noble hop malt front. Very smooth subtle sweet mellow butterscotch caramel Hoppy rich Maibock body. Rich smooth refreshing mellow hop balanced sweet clean rich Lager end. WOW! Tasted 1/17/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $5.99 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 1/14/2011."
"D: For a lager with fairly light flavors the 7% is well hidden, but the aftertaste starts to wear on me too much to want too much of this without a break. Still quite good though."
"Very drinkable beer, and deceptively strong."
"Overall it is not an amazing beer but it is pleasant to drink. A good drinkable beer."
"D&Notes: I am a big fan of Full Sail, and this brew is certainly a good one. It's not the best they have every done, but pretty damn good nonetheless. Although I see this classified as a Euro Pale Lager, it tastes more like a Bock version of a German Dortmunder Style Lager (not really sure if there is such a thing, but the flavors remind me of the style.) This brew would be a good choice for pale lager fans who want a brew with a nice kick. At 7% ABV, this one can definitely sneak up on you."
"The body was crisp and sharp with a clean finish. Drinkability was pretty good, I could easily have several of these. Overall, a very nice brew, as I've found the LTD series to be overall, certainly worth trying when you see it."
"- Overall drinkability is dangerous and good... tastes great, is smooth... and hides the strength well."
"D: Overall this was a tasty lager. I loved the simplicity of the ingredients as it really made you appreciate the flavors of these components. The higher alcohol content brings down drinkability a little as it leaves a little burn in the back of the throat. Knock the abv down a little and you have an extremely drinkable lager."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy amount of carbonation. I would definitely prefer more pronounced carbonation."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"12 oz part of a six-pack from Roths Vista Market,Salem. $7.49 Clear golden lager, with a rather thick, creamy off white head. Nice enough doughy, grassy aromas here. Typical lager. The taste is very surprising though..there is indeed an ""interplay"" with some really nice slightly toasty malts and a nice grassy hoppiness..works well. Because of this nie interplay it maes the palate very pleasurable. Overall a very nice clean lager from Full Sail."
"D - Although it's on the lighter side, far too alcoholic to drink all night. On the other hand, it's not all that expensive..."
"Oh well."
"Taste again offers lemon notes along with some orange and a bit of grain. Finishes with a lightly coarse bitterness and a return of sweet and peppery lemon oil. Feel is neutral for me, a bit thin when cold and firming up a bit with warming but never really offering much. As a result it drinks rather easily, sweet enough to mask the alcohol yet not so much to be cloying or mask a light bitterness on the finish."
"To me, this one didn't."
