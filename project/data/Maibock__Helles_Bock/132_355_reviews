"This is delicious. You should get it."
""
""
"This is my goto beer.  Every time.  Found it at a local bar that has a beer-of-the-month 2 years ago.  I think they kept it on as a regular beer because I kept them sold out."

"Great flavor, very good drinker"
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer didn't really wow me for the price I paid for it. Bought soley for trying a different brew. Not great, not horrible, on to my next new brew!"
""
"Great color, but I'm having a tough time placing the flavor. The bottle says hearty and balanced and I'll give it that. Also: I have to ask why they're calling it an ale if it's a maibock. (Aren't those lager yeasts?)"
""
""
"Classic malt flavors with a light crisp lager personality. The malt is slightly caramel sweet, with some grainy barley, light nut and even a bit of coffee bean."
""
"An aggressive pour shows two fingers off-white, soapy head with fair retention and good lacing. Amber brown with some red and very light cloudiness. Smell is not very powerful, brown sugar and bready. Taste matches aroma adequately, with addition of pineapple and some spices. Higher carbonation lingers on front and middle of tongue for half a minute or so. Decent body, not as heavy as I had imagined, a little on watery side. Overall, a good brew, not very complex, but easy drinking and enjoyable. Won't be buying regularly due to price, but will buy again, just the same."
"The name says it all. Imagine squeezing the fluid from the rotting corpse of a homeless crackhead whose last shower was recorded in the dead sea scrolls. Not something I would drink again."

"O: [2.50] This is very disappointing.  The bottle includes no useful information.  So this might be a really old bottle - but that is Rogue's fault not mine.  Suffer with a bad rating.  The mouthfeel was WAY off.  It is just like water.  No carbonation feeling at all (even with the 2 finger head).  Then the taste was poor too.  I won't drink this again."
""
""
"Banana bread brown sugar this is good ale"
""
""
""
"exceptional taste in one word outstanding"
"Overall - Pretty solid across the board, well rounded and definitely would come back to this but for the affordability (and accessibility) in Canada."
""
""
"smell and stay totally out off the stile.  so much sugar."
""
"One of my favorite beers"
""
"My favorite beer by a wide margin. Worth the price."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Yeast-heavy beer with a classic flavor and a fair bit of bitterness."
"Strong metallic taste, great for some I suppose. Just not for me."
""
""
"The malt is pretty well foregrounded with spicy hops and bitterness providing punctuation. Very flavorful though a bit buttery. The alcohol is slight but works well with the spiciness."
""
""
"Overall – Pretty dang good and a nice match up with a tasty salad dressed with white wine vinegar dressing this one is a real summer brew and has nice developing flavour that makes it interesting to drink."
""
""
""
"This beer is fairly standard for Rogue. I'm not particularly crazy about it, it comes off somewhat bland, and lacking in any distinguishable characteristics."
""
"Awesome beer really light and refreshing for how heavy it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle of dead guy drank"
"Poured dark cloudy amber.  Small head with mild retention and lacing.   Tropical fruit aroma.  Tropical fruit taste mikd hop at end.  Light bodied.  Decent beer but not very complex."
""
""
"It is just to hoppy for my taste."
"Malty and sweet...in saying that there is a slight hop bite and a dry balanced finish. However, it's gently hopped to cut the sweetness, a great overall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"All around fantastic beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Always a good choice when there are no other good choices. If that makes sense."
""
"Overall: This is an good and complex lager."
""
""
""
"A mix of very malty and slightly bitter. Definetly worth a try if you want to know what 'malty' means"
""
"It's just OK, not great"
"This was hoppier than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very solid beer. Although it tends to have a slightly saltly finish on my pallet. It's not pricey and worth the buy if you havent had it before."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very dinkable albeit malty. creamy with nice head."
""
"Not crazy about this whatsoever"
""
""
""
""
"Good malty & rounded beer that's a very good average, if that makes any sense."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Flute Glass, Burnt Orange color, held just a bit of a film of head, well below a finger.  The aroma was light, and personally one of the most lacking parts of the beer for me.  It had a nice smooth malty taste upfront with a strong hoppy aftertaste with bits of piney notes in between.  It was a nice, decently rounded beer that would be a great refresher.  Not too much going on, but a solid beer.  Aroma was the most lacking part of my personal experience with the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark orange with 2 inch head, slowly dissipates. Smells like straight malt. Taste is average, thick and malty - slightly refreshing. just not my style. Maybe good on a hot summer day?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. I'm a fan of bock brews. This isn't one of my favorites but I'd drink if u bought me one."
""
""
"Good beer, not a huge fan"
""
""
""
""
"Very nice beer with an inviting hoppy aroma, burnt orange colour, leading to a taste profile that is well balanced including some Saaz spiciness as well as a firm bready malt base, some pine and resiny earthy notes, all well put together to make a hoppy session ale that is very refreshing. Body is well balanced and bright. Hope are forward but the whole is a quite complete package and certainly very interesting."
""
"Pours a deep clear copper with a nice thick creamy white head. The head leaves big sticky lacing throughout the beer. The aroma is fruity, caramel, and bready and the taste is even more-so those with a nice earthy hops finish. The body is lighter but not watery, with a little carbonation and nice finish."
""
"tasted like chemicals and syrupy... like old cough syrup"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm underwhelmed.  It's a good, solid, sessionable brew, but not one that I'd go too far out of my way for."
""
""
""
""
"Willing to give it another chance - maybe a bottle instead?"
"Like a comfortable pair of old shoes that you find in the back of your closet and put on for the first time in a long time, I found the taproom in The Dalles was out of my favorite IPA when I went to fill a growler, but seeing they had Dead Guy on tap and I hadn't had it in years, I said fill 'er up. That night after a day of steelhead fishing I opened my growler and was almost blown away at how good that Dead Guy was from draft. It's so damn drinkable, refreshing, and goes perfectly with almost any food you'd want to pair it with. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a great beer.  A balanced amber with present hop and malt flavour.  The kind of brew that you could enjoy all night."
""
""
""
""
""
"Look is very good.  Everything else is OK"
""
"Finally rewarded myself w/this & while not earth shattering, it was definitely worth it.  Great look: swirled red in the middle surrounded by cloudy gold, holding tons of flavor bursts, I'd recommend it anytime!"
"A true legend in the microbrew universe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is great, a real pleasure when you're in the right mood.  I've been drinking this one for years since my little bro used to live a few miles away from the brewery.   It is quite different than both the (very different) German and American maibocks I know best, but I think it it is still a delicious brew...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the tastiest beers I've ever had."
""
""

""
"One of my all time favorites! Thanks Dan Davis."
""
""
"Overall: this is one of the better beers I have had from Rogue Ales - nicely complex without too much of the cloying nut character that tends to overpower a lot of their beers. Not too pricy at AU$14 for a 650mL bottle. Perhaps once every now and then."

"2nd best so far"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, and one I would gladly order again. This is definitely an Americanized Maibock, so don't go into this one expecting the subtleties of a traditional German one. Nonetheless, the beer is exceedingly drinkable and highly flavorful, and one I would definitely recommend trying."

"Just fantastic. The bottle design, the logo, and not to mention the beer. For whatever reason, I only drink these in the winter time, and I always look forward to drinking this more than Christmas itself. I love the Rogue brand, and Dead Guy is the best of the bunch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this is my first experience with Dead Guy even though I have been into beers for a while. I tend to pass on more common/available beers in favor of more obscure (typically foreign brews). I was delighted to find a modern, West Coast brew that was not dominated by hops.  But then this is from Oregon, not CA.  This is a very good beer, well balanced, offering an uncommon flavor profile. It would pair nicely with duck."

"Overall (3.54) : I wasn't all that impressed with this beer. Perhaps I'm not a fan of the Maibock style, but this one was just too intense and never really focused on any single flavor. There was no vantage point for me. It was all jumbled together in a sour bitter mess. It's crafty alright, but I'll skip this one next time."

"DATE TASTED: October 5, 2014... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: O's clinch, while the Browns complete the largest road comeback in history... APPEARANCE: slow, steady bubbles are mired within an opaquely beautiful orange brown body; creamy, substantial off-white head; lacing creates white fencing... AROMA: strong citric cleansing power--peach, tangerine, and orange--weds with soft pine to produce a sweet, rewarding allure... PALATE: smooth, active and bubbling to the tongue; simmering and balanced, if not a little difficult to place--could be the ale/bock moniker coming to fruition; still, highly drinkable for a beer nearly 7% ABV.....TASTE: intense melon, ear-tingling hops, and a solid malt base at the throat creates a full, demanding taste; nothing Dead here!  ... OVERALL:this hybrid beguiled me at first--seeking the ale, malt made me rethink everything--the style, the glass, the night...then, seeking the malt, the crunch of West Coast hops puts me square back in a pint glass... this beer makes me ask too many questions and, frankly, I do not mind--complex and rewarding...."

"Dried fruits and hops with a biscuit malt finish and a slightly bitter aftertaste."

"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light dark fruit, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice maibock style. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Hazy orange copper colored body with tan head. Caramel malt, biscuit, fruity & lightly floral hoppy notes. Nicely balanced and very tasty."
"My favorite beer hands down. Maibock/Helles Bock - It's just phenomenal. I'm just a weekend beer drinker who loves to try new craft beers and I haven't had anything better than Dead Guy Ale. I just wish it was a little cheaper! Cheers!"

"While the head is attractive, the lacing (meh) and the color/clarity of the ale leave a lot to be desired.  The aroma is very tempting and the flavor does not miss expectations.  The palate is pretty good.  Overall, this is a reliable ale – good but not outstanding."
""
""
""

"Overall, extremely drinkable and not overly complex. A beer I could drink everyday and not need to be in the mood for to drink it (i.e. something like a quad)."

"Overall above average to outstanding.  I have not tried any other Maibock or Helles Bock, so I was probably a little conservative.  Noticing the hops in the recipe, I would hazard that Rogue did their research right on this one.  I would like to try it again if I can grab it on tap, which shouldn't be hard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Worth the try at least once. Not a beer you can drink multiple in one sitting. Slightly overpriced."
""
"O: delicious;"
""
""
"great warm weather beer"
"Nice brew here !!, The color I would describe as a cloudy gold color with a decent head. The aroma has maybe a touch of honey sweetness. Bread and malts come out first on the palate and balances out well with the hops. It is very drinkable and almost gets better after a few. Nice job !"

"11/09/11 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Far better on tap than from bottle. Bordering on the crisp side. Hops are well under control and there is a slight apricot in the sweetness. In a word, a classy glass...Oops, that was two words, but you get my drift."

"I was surprised that Rogue Brewing Company's Dead Guy ALE was supposed to be a maibock. It doesn't taste like a Maibock to me. I'm sure it's great for people who enjoy ales, but I'm just not one. I prefer the subtle sweetness of Spaten, Sam Adams or even Gordon Biersch bocks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is another beer that I would gladly drink, but probably not buy again, just absed on the beer alone. Add in the premium Rogue seems to add to all their beers, and it is definitely not a beer I will buy again."

"O: shit, probably only had this once or twice in the past 10 years, but this is pretty damn good - but I love bitter, malty, fullish beers, minus all the tutti-fruity nonsense... if you're familiar enough with Rogue's ales, you may very well peg this as one right away - that Pacman is quite distinct... we'll see what the price point on this is, but I could see drinking this more often"

"Dark straw, lines of lace vertically, taste and smell are grains and malts, Germanic balance, with a really quite sweet palate, nice to only have a sampler as this is not cutting it. Bland beer, if well made."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy medium coppery amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of biscuit and caramel malt, mild citrus hops, pleasantly malty. Flavor is semi-sweet caramel malt with slight biscuit, mellow nondescript stone fruit, developing and finishing with spicy hops with light pine and citrus elements. Great balance. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I'm really overdue to review this Northwest classic, which I started drinking ages ago as Wolfeel Ale. One of the early flavorful beers that pulled me into craft styles. Nothing really stands out in this maibock, but it is almost perfectly balanced with a nice flavor progression from the lightly sweet maltiness into a good, non herbal mild hop finish. Really a fine example of the style (but with a domestic slant) and a great drinking beer. Very nice malt flavors. Glad to revisit it."

" Overall an outstanding 4 given to Dead Guy Ale from Rogue Ales. This was beyond smooth for a brew over 6% ABV ! Too bad I hadn't picked this up earlier in my life. This will be a staple in my fridge."

"Clear amber pour with a slight dark ruby cast. Massive head with normal lacing that retains well. Nose of caramel over sweet floral against a very subtle spiciness. Medium body with a smooth texture that hints at oily resin. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The complex flavor profile is quite nice and well balanced. It begins with a citric tartness, flows into a softer caramel light sweetness that gradually comes to the forefront with a bit of spicy heat. It finishes with a sweet fade into light hop bitterness coupled with a light spicy hop flavor. An outstanding and well crafted maibock."

"Pours almost a reddish yellow with a nice head that leaves trails down the glass. The smell is mostly citrus but with a little bit of vanilla to it. The first taste was nice and crisp with a little bit of vanilla and banana sweetness to it which then yielded to a nice yeast taste. The balance was very nice which transitioned to a piney yet subtle hop finish that made the beer incredibly drinkable regardless of weather. A very good beer worth trying."

"one of the most outstandingly drinkable brews out there. smooth and refreshing without being weak or too summery. not too bitter and not too sweet, a perfect, and i mean perfect, beer for a time when you really dont feel like thinking about your beer. simply enjoy, if all other breweries made beers like this the world would be a drunker place"

"The biggest thing I was surprised by is the lack of flavor. This is a very light tasting beer with a nice carbonation to it...but it drinks like water. Don't get me wrong - it is not a dissatisfying beer - it is just slightly perplexing. My tastes may be biased, however, as I am a fan of IPA's and dark, heavy beers, and this is dead center between the two. Overall I wouldn't NOT recommend it but wouldn't push strongly TO recommend it. Perhaps the word 'bland' fits as a description. But I would buy it again - sometimes bland is all you need."

"This is a cool beer! It had more carbonation than most beers I've had before and was lighter in nature. It was really refreshing which was one of my favorite qualities of it. All around, I gave this one a solid 3.5. If you're sitting at a bar reading this wondering if it's a good call, go for it! Definitely worth at least trying!"

"I'll admit, like so many i'm sure that found this, I bought this brew due to it's fun bottle and name. I was pleasantly surprised upon opening this one up. Pours a beautiful cloudy dark orange/amber color with a very thin white head. It has a pleasant light fruity smell to it. Very drinkable and has some caramel malt flavor to it and well balanced slight bitter hop taste. It's full bodied but refreshing and easy drinking. This is a great beer and it will be on my purchase again list no doubt. Nice job to Rogue, i'll be looking to try some more brews from this company."

"I drank this beer, like it was intended, from a gigantic cask purchased at Bottles & Bins in Monterey, CA. It had an amazing, strong, aroma that enticed me through out my journey. It had a small amount of sediment that also made for a great taste. Really bitter for those first timers."

"An interesting one, almost seems like an American pale ale & definitely an unusual take on the Maibock style with the beer growing on you as you work your way down the glass. A good beer but I imagine this will be a one off for me and I won't be trying to pick it up again."
""
""

"Poured from a 650 ml bottle. I think I picked this one up at Firefly on Cambie near 12th. Clear copper in colour with about a centimetre of off-white head and visible carbonation. The smell is sweet like toasted Maritime brown bread, but with a hint of fruitiness. Very smooth and drinkable, with nicely balanced flavours."

"I was introduced to Dead Guy last year and I can't get enough of it. Its dark color is a great to see in a tall glass and provides a mature rich taste compared to some other ales I've had. Its taste is very powerful at first and then relaxes, which is what an ale should do. If there’s somewhere where this is on tap please let me know. Bottled is great but I’m guessing on tap would provide a better taste and you would be able to taste the ingredients more. I highly recommend this beer."

""

"O - Well crafted, with many fine qualities. Perhaps not exactly the kind of beer that does it for me, but I respect that this is a well-built brew that hits all the bases."

""

""
""
""
""
"O- Very good showing from Rouge. Simple yet extraordinary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"o. An outstanding offering from an excellent brewery. One of my favorite - go to beers."
""
""

"Overall: Pretty solid beer. Easy to drink and nice flavor profile. I haven't had it in a while and trying to figure why I haven't. Might be having more of these in the close future."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For some reason the 64 oz growler seems to have a slightly stronger signature than the 12 oz bottle- and the Double Dead Guy is really a treat!"
""
""
""
"O - I was expecting far more from such a highly rated beer and was terribly disappointed."
"O: This beer was pretty good and it definitely has a ton of flavor. To me, the bitterness that I got from the beer was more of a plain ole bitterness as opposed to a hoppy one. Maybe it was just my bottle. But either way I really enjoyed this one. I would suggest that you taste it cold and notice the hop bite that it has and then let it warm up and get the caramel and molasses notes that come through."

"This is an interesting change of pace beer from the typical IPAs, porters, and saisons that I've been drinking lately. Good gateway beer into craft, IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My ex's favorite beer so I've drunken a lot of this stuff. Nice hazy amber color which is my favorite part. Its very nicely balanced and not too hoppy (not that id mind if it was). I cant say much about the smell other than its also very balanced. It's nicely carbonated with a dry finish that lingers for awhile in your mouth. The taste packs a punch but its also very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I generally hate lagers, let me reiterate, I HATE LAGERS! mainly because they leave me feeling incomplete, and I just go for Ales. But this is damn good. I wouldn't mind drinking this while eating something light like a light fish or salad. This is very drinkable, light, with the perfect balance of everything that should make a lager great. I will be having this again... and again and again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is near perfect in that its deep and complex without bludgeoning your senses. There is a Xmas cookie-like flavor here; biscuit-y and slightly sweet; with hints of orange and lemon to add to the overall dimension of things. The hop bitterness blends well with the malts and completes the package, adding nice overall depth and complexity to this palate pleaser."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, really like it, but don't understand the pricetag. I would love to try this on draught though, and will probably throw down for a sixer at some point."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was satisfying. Very smooth, balanced, and goes down easy. Definitely a drinking beer, I could knock back a few of these in quick succession and still be thirsty for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great drinkability. Very easydrinking like a good Bock beer should be. An American classic (in a German body :))"
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of my favorite beers. One of the easiest drinking bitter beers I know of, with soft hoppy initial taste and a not too strong aftertaste that lingers well. Still trying to find food that it goes well with, but otherwise this beer is a winner!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer. Would buy again if it was accessible. Very good intro beer as well."
""
"O - Definitely recommend, enjoyable beer that is balanced rather well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer that must be tried for people that like maibocks and dont want to spend a whole lot on it, its usually 10-11$ a 6 pack. Reccommended!"

"Dark ruby mostly opaque beer with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Not much in the way of lacing on the glass. Smells bready, sweet like bananas, all about the malts, maybe a hint of spicy hops somewhere in there. Thick & bready in the mouth with good carbonation.Honey up front, then caramel and other malt sweetness, followed by an awesome, bitter finish that lingers on the tongue awhile. More dry & hoppy than other Bocks I've had. Noticeable warming from the alcohol after you swallow."

"O- I tried it to see what the most rated beer in this style tasted ike. It was differant and will try it again."
"Overall, Rogue Dead Guy Ale is one of those beers that I have often overlooked since it's been around forever and I've had it tons of times. That being said, it is a really enjoyable beer and one that I will definitely come back to particularly when I want something drinkable and tasty."
"Beautiful fluffy, creamy white head on an orangish hued ale with a slightly hazy body. Didn't get too much out of the nose but the flavor is rich and extremely malty with a thick, full mouthfeel. There's a very strong hop presence that lingers throughout the sip; hard to place exact flavors. This beer seems to be all over the place but is extremely tasty and satisfying. A cross between a pale ale and an amber. My only complaint would be its muddled, undefined flavor that doesn't quite allow anything to stand out. Definitely worth trying, but not something I'd return to regularly."

"Rogue nailed this beer, and it is as good now as it was 15 years ago. Even with all of the great new beers coming out, this is still a really good beer."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I find that no single characteristic of Dead Guy Ale stands out on its own. If broken down into it's specific categories, I'll probably forget it in a few weeks. But as a whole, I find DGA to be a solid beer. In my opinion it is not worth the $6.70 price tag I payed for a 650ML bottle, but if it dropped into the $5-$6 range, I wouldn't mind picking up a couple to have on hand."
""
""
""
""
"It still has a very interesting taste, and I can't fault it for being stored as it was. I cracked it open and poured into a shaker, and still got plenty of head. I'd just like to add that I can really taste the Munich malts. I might up the score a hair."
""
""
"got this beer in a growler at the liquor store i work at part time. nice in copper tone. smells a little malty taste like your average helles beer. goes down smooth and has a great mouthful feeling and overall isn't bad, recommend this beer to a good bock enthusiast. another great brew from Rogue"
""
""
"PS I find serving temp to be especially important in this brew."
""
""
""
""

"As a Maibock this beer is all Malts with just enough hops to keep it balanced. My first recommendation is to let this one warm up before you begin to drink it. Served Ice cold the Dead Guy Ale can taste like a cheap gas station beer, but once it warms all of the deep malty character come out. It pours a honey color with an off-white head and sweet caramel aroma. The taste is all malts, with big sweet malt and caramel notes and a nice depth that lingers on the palate. This is a definitely a complex beer for a Maibock and a great counterpoint to all the IPAs I have been drinking lately. It has deceptively high alcohol content for the very smooth and easy drinking beer. The Dead Guy Ale was a nicely balanced and outstanding beer."

"Pours a hazy, golden/copper color. Has a decent head, but dissipates rather quick. Pretty good carbonation, and the lacing is alright. Has a bit of a malty, sweet, apple taste to it. Mouthfeel not bad, and not too much aftertaste. Overall a pretty drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper with a 1-finger off white head that left some lacing when sipped. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of malty grains with a hint of caramel with maybe apricot. Pretty much was the taste as well as with a hint of spice. Good balance of flavor and smooth to drink. No harsh or bad aftertaste was noted. Overall a fine brew"

""
""
""
""
""
"It poured an inviting, yet hazy honey brown with a beige colored head. It smelt like sweet crackers and caramel. A good malt aroma. The taste was honey with more caramel. Definitely enjoyable even with the upfront bitterness. It was drinkable and balanced. So far, one of my favorite offerings from Rogue."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall my favorite beer of all time. My German-style bias could partly bee a factor in this recognition however it's just what I expect a world-class beer to be. It's not all fruity and bitter like some IPAs'. It's not watered down by any means like mainstream American beer. It goes down smooth and at 6.5% abv, it's outstandingly palatable. The taste is something of an amber ale cross with German brew tones. This is my favorite beer in the USA!"
""
"O: my first experience with this style. Definitely not something I would have every day. It was perhaps a little sweet for my liking. I normally don't drink a 22 oz beer alone, so I had a bit left over. A decent enough brew...better suited to the fall in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall: I've had this beer several times. At beer dinners, pubs, and even as a beer of the month selection. This is a complex beer and a great example in this style. It continues to grow on me through every tasting."

"O: I've had this sitting in my basement for a few months now. My friends rave about this beer and I've been skeptical to try it because I'm more of an IPA guy. I can see what all the fuss is about. This beer executes on all levels and I'll be looking forward to having more of these in the cooler seasons."

"Tried at a pub in downtown Calgary on a nice sunny Saturday afternoon. Pours up a honey golden graham hue with a moderate amount of beige head. Aroma was sweet, fairly floral, spicy Noble hops. Taste was a really complex mosaic of light caramel, aromatic biscuit, lemon, dry chocolate powder, orange, honey, and tobacco with ample hop spice and subtle bitterness. I was struck by how integrated the flavors were, one had to really focus to pick them out and the overall impression is one of a floral/herb/spice bouquet with a honey sweet backdrop. If Rogue was going for integration rather than staggering things on the palate they hit a home run here."

"Anyway,Last night I made my usual Beer run after work,and Decided to Finally check out some Dead Guy Ale,[15 bucks a 6er] upon getting home,I Popped one right away and poured it in a standard Pint glass,and right away was taken by the beautiful,slightly amber,almost copper color,OK..looks very nice,Next I gave it the ole sniffer test,smelled malty and quite hoppy,which led to my mouth watering like a Lion looking at a Zebra,it had a decent Head,but nothing to write home about..but I have to say, as soon as I Tasted it,the less then stellar head meant nothing at all!quite simply this is one Top Notch Brew,with hints of Carmel & maybe a little toffee also,very malty & hoppy [just like it smelled] So in closing,my Beer Snob Friends were right on the money [this time..hehe] ""Rouge Dead Guy Ale"" is a Wonderful Brew,and will always have a place in my Beer Fridge;)"
""

"Overall a good example of a Maibock, I have had better but this is near the top of the bunch. It is definitely worth trying."

"O-I can't believe it has taken me this many years to try Dead Guy, but I am glad I finally did. The beer may not have much flash or any bret in there, but what it lacks in pizazz, it makes up for in drinkability and balance. From the first sniff to the last drop on the palate, this beer is a well-made example of old-school micro-brewing."

"T- Nice. Good, well balanced maibock. Hoppy, brown sugar. Great carbonation with a touch of bitterness. Not overly hopped for an ale, which is nice. Has just a hint of pine. Just good beer."
""
""
"This actually was a very good beer for the style. Not very lager-y, but it imitates the style very well with its breadiness, yet still with that ale light body. A really enjoyable beer for those not into bitterness or the grassy hops of other German style lagers. This balances that well being an ale."

"Overall - Yikes, I normally don't see DMS in commercially available beers but that's Rogue for you. I used to like this brand and sometime I will give it another review but this one is terrible. I'm not one to dump beer, but I have good stuff in the fridge that I'd rather drink. This beer was infected."
""
""
"I dont usualy drink ales unless its and ipa or something of the sort but this was my brothers so i was willing to try. And glad i did. Nice malty taste with a lingering finish that was a plesant flavor in my mouth. Not too bad.. .now i just need to try the double dead guy ale."

"Overall: I don't have any particularly strong feelings here. The beer is not noticeably malty or hoppy, doesn't have any particularly strong flavor. A good beer but could not find anything to really like or dislike about it so I guess I'm neutral. Might buy this again, might not."

"Pour was from a 22oz bottle into a Pint glass and the cloudy Orange/Brown color was very nice, thick White head reached 2 1/2 fingers and hung around. It was hard to get a definable aroma, malty sweetness is what came through and maybe some mild hops. Taste is where I really fell for this Ale, sweet with a tangy after taste...some bitters on the back of the tongue and a malty finish. The mouthfeel was solid with a medium smooth drinkablity. Overall it's a very fine Maibock, great taste, decent ABV and it looks good in a Pint glass."

"O. I've never been impressed with Dead Guy Ale. It tastes like they took a great Barley Wine and watered it down, which is especially infuriating considering the rest of Rogue's offerings. Definitely decent overall, but probably my least favorite from Rogue. This is really just a standard malty bock, nothing very interesting."

"O: My experiences with Rogue as a brewery have been fairly limited (Maple Bacon Ale and nothing else that has been particularly memorable), but I made a point of hunting this out after friends had recommended it as their favorite of Rogue's offerings. It's not a bad beer, and certainly is something I'd take over most common bar offerings, but I don't know that I'd pick this up over many of the other options I have in the craft aisle. This beer isn't bad, but I can already tell that the sweetness of this one is going to wear on me by the end of the bottle and I don't know that I'd sign up to enjoy this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Well done for the style. The nose had me a little skeptical, but rebounded nicely with the flavor and feel. I'm not in the mood for this style often, but when I am, I will certainly consider this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have no idea what the hell a Maibock is supposed to be, and frankly I still don't know. This beer has all kinds of stuff going on, which is not a bad thing. I would say I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really did not like this beer way too nasty and bitter. It has a poor head and for a bock beer it really lacked any malt taste. I thought that it was over hopped. All in all I just did not like the taste of this beer. It has a cidery taste that is disgusting to me. If all they did was use sugar to built up the alcohol they were wasting the effort."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome."
""
""
""

"This beer is a real go to for me. Always delicious. The malts and hops are mixed just about as perfectly as can be on the palate. Color is a darkish brown that just makes my mouth water looking at it. While the smell may be lacking a little, the taste is a real mouthful"
""
"Overall - This is a great representation of this style and beer in general. Once in a while you can live without the hop zing element and get back to basics, this hearty ale proves that."

""
""
"Had this in my hospitality beverages course. Apparently this beer is brewed like a lager, but uses an ale yeast. We were given this as a Helle Lager, but it was more similar to a Boch style and was to dark and hoppy to be a true Helles Lager. Still tasted great though."
"overall: Just bought a 6-pack, may revise this review once im finished with it. Not much experience with the style, but I enjoyed this beer. I feel like it will grow on me even more as well, its a very warm, tart, malty brew. I'm having a really hard time describing it, but it's very well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"The Dead Guy Ale from Rogues was a very interesting beer. The beer had a great amber appearance. The smell had notes of caramel and pumpkin flavors. The taste was very malty and had pumpkin flavors. The body had a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious but different beer."

"not the richest or the most exotic however it has become my current signature beer. satisfying, drinkable as a single or for a few in a quiet moment. although chilled properly it is also an excellent room-temp ale if you like to get the full measure of texture, scent and flavor . be sure to enjoy from a wide mouth [pref glass] container as the aroma is a substantial part of the experience."

Now get out there and drink some different drinks! Mix it up, but stop drinking f@cking Jaeger Bombs and drink good beer! Life is short enough, don't make it even shorter drinking that complete garbage!"

"O - Well balanced and very flavourful. That ABV is very well hidden."
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer better from the bomber, or at least this time around I do. That's probably psychological, BTW, but for some beers, bombers are just king. If you like this maibock/helles bock, this is a very nice and hoppy example."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Dead Guy was a very tasty well put together brew that was a pleasure to drink. A must try. Classified as a Mailbock/Helles Bock at 6.5% ABV. Consumed 2-16-13."
""
""
""
""
"Not at all what I expect from a helles. Esters are way too high. Hop flavor is lacking, but bitterness is about right"

"Light copper amber colour, 1.5 fingers of off white head, good lace on the glass. Smell is of malty caramel, quite fruity, biscuity, some floral/grassy hops, bit of earth with more fruit. Taste is malty and full of caramel and toffee, moderate sweetness and mildly bitter, aplle and fruit here again, clean biscuity finish. Medium carbonation, lightly creamy, smooth medium body. Solid and pretty easy drinking, a bit one dimensional but still very tasty, certainly simple but effective."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste is also abundantly sweet upfront with an astringent bitterness roaring up behind but then settling in to balance things off. No wonder this is so popular."

"Overall. Not a bad brew, but the fruity yeast isn't really my kind of thing in a beer that doesn't have a whole lot else to offer besides sweet malts and some bitter, but unflavourful hops."

"Very awesome beer, a bold beer with very big flavors. I am a homebrewer, but I still have trouble being able to tell what it is about some beers... this is one of those. Very malty, taste like part of the malt protiens did not convert to simple sugars for fermentation. Thats not a bad thing, the flavor is great ... I'm just not sure if that is even it, whatever it is, it works!"
"Overall: Certainly a hearty brew for sure. Nice balance. I have never had this style before, but I did enjoyed Dead Guy Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this at the Royal Bear Tavern. Light amber in color and a little hazy. Thin white head. Toasty malt aromatics. Tastes of toasted malt too. Lightly sweet followed by a good but not overly punch of hops. This beer has a nice balance to it. Very smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium carbonation. Very good beer and a good example of balance."

""
""
"This Mai-bock style ale intrigues the senses with it's beautiful color and, to me, rich aroma. The taste isn't too strong but neither is it too weak. I recommend this beer to both the mild/entry enthusiast to the extreme enthusiast. In my personal opinion you can't go wrong if your hanging with a Dead Guy."
""
"Awesome."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass at wine country Shreveport. Pours a hazy orange with a finger of white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Really nice mild sweet sugary malt aromas. Taste is bitter hop followed but the sweet malts. The hops are surprising since they were barely detected in the aroma but really well balanced and smooth. This is an awesome brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-An interesting beer. Not what I expected, but very nicely balanced and drinkable. Expected something bigger and maybe even somewhat smoky, but once I reminded myself that this is a lager, I was realized how full of taste and smooth lagers can be! Yum, yum I will go back to this one for sure!"
""

"Did I mention it was only $1.99 for a bomber? I grabbed a few."
"Stop into McCann's Pub and Grill in Astoria NY and try one for yourself!!"

"A clear brown. Small head with traces of lacing. Smell was all biscuity malts, maybe munich/caramel. Taste was biscuitty, molasses a little nutty, some lemon grass hops. I detected some off flavors. Heavy mouthfeel, normal cabonation. A bit uninteresting, not worth price."
""
""
"VERY NICE; MUST TRY!"
"Overall a good beer and decent representation of the style, but it seems rather disjointed."
""
""
"I guess I have a different opinion about this beer than most people. Part of my dislike may simply be the style, I will have to try more maibocks to be sure. But this one hits you over the head with bready malts and then hits you over the head again with intense honey flavor that somehow manages not to blend very well with the bitter hoppy finish. The flavors were disjointed, separate and it just didn't seem to me like a very well crafted beer."

"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber color with an off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, herbal, floral, toffee, earth, pepper, clove, pear, apple, and light citrus. Very nice and well balanced malty aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, herbal, floral, toffee, pine, clove, earth, pepper, pear, and light grapefruit. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pine, herbal, earth, and citrus on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavor; with good malt flavor robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent maibock. Nice toasty flavors with good balance and robustness."

"Rogue Dead Guy Ale--- 4/5."

"This beer pours a nice copper color. The nose is similar to a traditional brown ale with charred grain. Comes across the palate smoothly. It has a light caramel flavors with a sweet malty clean lingering finish. This is one of my favorite bock styles."

"O: Great overall beer, I liked the overall look and taste of the beer it reminded more of a homebrew than a typical craft beer. Good drinking, higher alcohal than most session beers, but much better tasting without hitting the double digit alcohal levels of alot of newer craft beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very drinkable beer, although I would only drink it in moderation as it's pretty sweet. This would go good along with steak or a dessert. The Caramel and Toffee taste is great and this is a unique beer."

""

"Dead Guy Ale grew on me throughout the glass, but I still don't quite believe it's worth the $2.79 I paid for the bottle -- SLIGHTLY overpriced. Regardless of that though, this is a tasty beer. It looks great, it feels great, and it has a very solid taste that's fairly mild, yet keeps you drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one pours up a clear amber with a small white head and leaves a little bit of lacing. The smell is primarily pine, floral, and resin. Taste is sweet and malty upfront, but not overpoweringly so. The finish is a mild bitterness. Well balanced, but mild overall. Mouthfeel is fine, but nothing wonderful. This beer is easy drinking and I would recommend it."

"Medium bodied, a little slick on the palate, but the drink-ability of this beer is dangerous! It does not have the alcohol volume of a session beer but it is so easy to drink! I will tell you that if you session drink the brew you will end up like the guy on the bottle. There are stronger beers but this would be the whiskey of beers in my book. Not by taste, but by effect."

""
""

"O: This beer represents a conundrum for me. It's the kind of middle of the road daily drinker I envisioned it would be - but it's priced just out of said middle of the road daily drinker range at $12/6 pk. For that reason, I wouldn't pick this up over offerings from Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, or the like."

"Poured from bottle into a plastic cup. Enjoyed outdoors on a Fall night. Pours a nice, deep amber with a generous 2 finger off white head. Smell is on the sweet end, but not overpowering. Malty and a bit of carmel. Taste is rather unique. My first Mailbock and I wasn't disappointed. Front end is loaded with carmel malts that give way to a nice hop balance. Very well balanced beer that keeps you coming back for more. Picked up a bready, nutty profile as well that is subtle. Feel is nice and full with good carbonation and silky ending. Overall- A very surprising brew. Balanced and full of flavor. nice carmel, sweet front with hop balance. Very sessionable and complex with it's taste. A definite must try! Well done Rogue-"

"Dark orange clear beer with lasting beige head. Intense US hop nose with hints of chocolate limes. When I say hints I mean completely unsubtle flavors. Really nice in mouth, got good strong mouthfeel with malts and alcohol coming through. Then smooth choc lime finish with drying intense hoppiness. Superb with good lasting flavors"
""
""
"Bought a bottle of this from Harvest Fine Wine & Spirits in Hartford, CT. Poured into a Baird pint glass. A strange orange/wheat hue with a thin white head. Beautifully subtle yet complex smell of exotic fruit like mango/star fruit/apricot with a bit of hops behind it. The flavor is mild and harks back to the smell, easy on the throat yet memorable. A smooth drinking beer with lots of body and flavor to support it. Another quality beer from a quality brewer like Rogue!"
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours hazy copper with an eggshell colored head. There are some visible bubbles in the beer. The head retains very well, dissipating slowly and leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of sweet and bready malts with some earthy and floral hop aromas. The malt profile is strong with the bready and mildly sweet notes. There's some good back end bitterness from the hops, which bring some floral and spicy characteristics. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is sticky and dry. This allows the aftertaste to linger for a little while. This is an excellent beer."
""

"Not my favorite style, but this is a nice version of it. First had this back in college, but most recently had a 12 oz. bottle poured to a tulip glass. Beautiful amber color with small white head on top. This one has a very solid aroma: caramel, biscuits, pine, toffee, citrus. Doesn’t go down particularly easy for only 6.6%, but a nice changeup. Flavor is biscuity malts, some caramel sweetness, and a good bit of hefty bitter and booze for the abv. Overall, I liked this but not over the top on it."

"The smooth-textured brew tastes primarily of caramel-covered pears mixed with a small amount of dried prunes, brown sugar sprinkles, and finishes with an abrupt yet satisfyingly drying herbal and floral hopping finish. Memorable for the profound transformation from bock sweetness to a balanced pale ale kind of bitterness in the finish."

Maybe it's the evolution of my taste buds to bigger and better things but it's not as incredible as I remember. Still, I really enjoy the beer. It's got good flavor, it's pleasant and very drinkable."

"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a Medium amber, with a finger and a half worth of head. The smell is quite hoppy if you ask me, With light toasted malt and bread. The taste virtually follows the smell. Tastes hoppy, Some light malt, Some wet bread and slightly strong skunk. Weird for the type, Eh?, It all piled together nicely thought. The mouthfeel somewhat follows, Though it allows more of the skunk to come through. Overall, A VERY easy to drink beer. Seriously, I would buy this for ANY occasion. Though at $2.50 a bottle, The prices are a bit too high for what you get. Drop your prices, And you'll consistently have my ( and I'm sure thousands of others ) business"

"This beer was wonderful. Using ale yeast for a Lager stye seemed to have worked well for Rogue. Probably the best Maibock I've had so far."

"bottom line, this is one of my go to beers. after a long day, or just hangin' with my fellow beer geeks, dead guy is a wonderful all around beer. with aromas of malty sweet carmel and hints of fruitness that reminds of fall weather. it's the tastes that packs the punch though. wonderful complex notes of malt and hops, spices of nutmeg and clove. a great bitter finish that hop lovers can respect. cheers to rogue for their Dead Guy Ale."

"O: A good beer, but not, in my opinion, a great one. The sweetness is a little overwhelming, and I don't know that I would want more than one or two."
""
""
"O - it has been along time since I've had this but it's still pretty good. Not a hugely impressive style to be honest but Rogue does it really well. Easy to drink. Alcohol is properly masked and it finishes solid. Perhaps not a personal go to beer or style, but worth having once in awhile."

"Overall: You have to be kidding yourself not to grab a bottle. I have enjoyed it beginning to end and loved every bit of it. Salud!"

"O - Overall its a very well put together brew, I think this beer is exactly what they'd hoped it would be. For me personally, I like bold or more robust beers but if you like more of a mild but flavorful brew this one is definitely worthy and easy to drink"

"Poured into a mug in May- seasonable! Aroma was something I'd equate with Springtime- effervescent, flowery, and happy. The taste was very refreshing. I could see myself buying a case of this every May and being quite happy with it. This beer is a great signifier of the change in seasons! The one downside is I'll never be able to drink it in months that aren't May!"

"totally unlike any other bock ive tried, and certainly a departure from traditional bocks, but this is a very unique ale that has become a bit of a legend in the USA. the smell is odd to me, sweet and malty, but also spiced to a degree, and hopped like only a west coast beer can be. the flavor features heavy hops on the back end, which is not common in a spring bock. the malts do the rest of the work, layering in a ton of complexity to this. i also get some woody notes and a touch of dried fruit. mouthfeel works, its heavier in the body but the carbonation is very high, which makes for a pleasant experience not like many others. overall this is an excellent brew, but i dont want to drink a whole 6pack. just gets too heavy and sweet after a bunch of them, but one or two every so often is really nice."
"O:  A good beer to drink regularly except for the expensive price tag. If this was regular price I would like it much better. Flavors mingle well and serves as a well developed helles lager. I want to try the other dead guy line up but this will probably be my last time picking this up. "
""
""
""
"I cant believe i have not reviewed this and it pours a very hazy light amber hue with a creamy two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is toffee malts,buttered popcorn,caramel treacle and bananna cake,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,malty and suits nicely for the style with a big malt backbone with tastes of caramel candy,toffee treacle,fruit cake,honey soaked raisins and finished with a mix of plum jam and an earthy herbal hop bitterness that is nicely balanced due to the big malt backbone and overall i like this brew as its a nice balance of malt and hops with the malts making their presence known as what a good helles should do and overall i like this brew and glad i revisited it as i could drink it all day and the perfect brew for an Octoberfest thats not in Germany cheers."

"O: A lager style brewed with ale yeast... very interesting take on the style for sure. Smells and tastes lake a lager, which is even more interesting. Solid brew, try it out"
""
"This beer remains one of my all time favoriates. I constantly recomend Dead Guy to people. I find it to be a very eary to drink beer with rewarding aftertase. I noties a stightly metalic flavor in this beer that has grown on me. Having had this beer both out of the bottle and on tap, I would say that it is fantastic both ways. The only knock on it is the price; its generally very expensive. I would purchase it much more if it was not quite as expensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but a bit disappointing after hearing so much talk of how great it is. A nice malty character and fantastic mouthfeel, but the hops have gone missing. Some hop aroma and bitterness but not much. The only culprit I can imagine is age; this has probably been sitting around over here for too long. It obviously doesn't help that there is no bottle dating to act as a guide. Still, a decent brew that deserves to be sampled."
""
""
""
""
""
"White head. The color is a beautiful amber brownish. The carbonation is just right. Smell is basic, but that is why it is good. The first sip tickles my tongue, leaving a very happy and relaxed mouth afterward. I have no intention to be in a hurry with this as it is a good secret to keep. No need to tell you what this brew tastes like as it is known that you just need to be here. You know a good bartender when ..."

"Final Grade: 4.27, a very high A-. This beer gets a lot of praise in BA circles, and now having tried it, I see that this praise is entirely justified. This stuff is delicious, perfectly balanced and deceptively drinkable for a 6.6% brew. It is not a traditional maibock, as it definitely possesses some features that seem decidedly 'pale ale-inspired'. But even if you can't stuff Dead Guy Ale into a neat little labelled box, it's a brew that no self-respecting beer geek should hesitate to try."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is really good compared to other maibocks I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, no sign of a bottled date on Rogue beers. Pours a cloudy orange with a one inch white head, with attractive lacing. Smell is clove, brown sugar, lemon pepper, and figs. Taste is very sweet brown sugar, clove, and fig dominate. Body is medium, enough life, not overly dry, and drinkable. Not my favorite style, for malt lovers."

"I got this beer at the Continental Tavern in Yardley, PA not knowing what to expect. I was taken aback immediately by the two highest qualities of this beer: its craftsmanship and its drinkability. This beer is incredibly easy to enjoy and is downright tasty (as opposed to savory). I will definitely look out for this ale next time I see it."

"Noticed this 6-pack tucked away in the corner of the refrig at my local liquor store, sporting a $14.99 price tag. Had to try it just to see what that price buys you these days. I wasn't disappointed, but not exactly knocked over. A solid, balanced beer, that doesn't carry any one defining characteristic. More maltish in taste than anything. Certainly not hop-heavy. It's the mix that does the rick here and makes this an eminently drinkable brew. Hard to have just one. It could be a good staple beer, if it weren't for the cost."
""
"Overall: A great beer with a rich taste"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I haven't had too many Rogue beers up to this point, but this one is probably my favorite thus far. It's smooth and very drinkable, with a pleasant, refreshing taste that makes me wish I had a few more of these to drink. The taste does an excellent job of having the malts, hops, sweetness, and bitterness all fit together beautifully. I can certainly see why this beer is available year-round as it would be easy to enjoy no matter the season."
""
"Pours a clear light amber with a one finger head. Lots of tiny bubbles rising to the top of the glass. It smells of clove and clean malt. This beer has an interesting character. Up front is the spicy, earthy, clove notes. The middle is kind of bread like, and it ends a bit of a bite. It stays on the palate. This beer wants you to drink more of it. And I will."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is dark copper to light brown with an orange hue; the moderate head doesn't last very long. Scents are of fresh baked bread with a bit of citrus and grass. The taste is mainly roasted malt - bready and nutty, and a bit sweet, but with a hint of grassy and floral notes. The flavors all work really well together. Very low bitterness, and very drinkable. Solidly good all-around. This might make a good beer to transition someone into the craft beer world from BMC products."
""
"Overall, a nice maibock. Love the misnomer in the name. Classic Rogue flagship product. 4.0"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have to agree with the majority on this one...this is an exceptional brew! Full flavored without overdoing it, yet clean and crisp, this makes a great beer to enjoy during hot weather, such as I did, or even to compliment a meal! I recommend this one and hope to enjoy many more of these to come!"

"Poured a nice golden red, with a very small amount of lacing and little head other than a small white ring. Smells of honey molasses citrus notes. The taste is great, it leads with a little sweetness then goes into full blown malty goodness with a touch of honey. Overall I won't hesitate to purchase this again. Only problem is I have a hard time taking my time with such a tasty beer."

"Just not my kind of beer. I'm not a fan of Pale Ale's so bare with me here. The taste just was bland for me. Too bitter and spicy. I thought the color was good looking and the smell was awesome. But the taste really made me sad. I wanted to really like this beer(it was really expensive). I have heard good things about Rogue, but maybe I should stick to their stouts and porters."

"D - A bold beer. To make this beer takes balls and kudos to Rogue for crafting it. This is a beer that tastes like it's in love with itself."
""
"O - I'd had this on-tap at the brewery but hadn't reviewed it then so it is nice to revisit this brew. It's like you mixed a Maibock and an IPA 50/50. I dig it but knocked off 1/2 point in taste for the mineral/metallic flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one was a pretty decent offering from Rogue. It wasn't the best Maibock around, but still quite enjoyable. I've got to mark it down a little for the oxidation, but may revisit this at some point and see if what just a batch (or line) issue."

"Pours a nice amber color with a 2 inch white head and good retention. Leaves a spider web lacing on the glass. Aroma is of sweet malt and a touch of citrus. Taste is light sweetness and finishes a bit with of citrus and tart finish. Medium bodied and good drinkability."

""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"A clear reddish brown in color with a rocky light tan colored head. Smells of freshly baked bread. The taste is a super sweet caramel and grain medley up front, followed by some zesty, light balancing hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall this is a great beer. A conundrum to fit in stylistically, yet that matters not when the result is this good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I wish the hops were a little brighter to really counter the toastiness I get. I had trouble picking out flavors...I don't really get any of the fruity notes some people put forth (unless its interfering with the hop...or IS the hop). Its good on the whole, but after having Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Shakespeare Stout, I had much higher expectations for the flavor. Still, a solid beer from Rogue, and I wouldn't mind drinking it again."

"Overall- Good brew. I am really looking forward to having this again. This is a perfect example of why this style of beer is my favorite."

""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful beer, but I should have known that. All my friends who have similar taste to me love it and all the ones with polar opposite taste hate it. Drinks really well, and is the best lager I have had, normally not a fan of lagers. Thick, smooth, a little sweet, a little bitter, and has a long lasting flavor. Wicked good."

"Dead Guy Ale - The bottle says: Nothing. The bottle doesn’t say anything at all."

"Overall I couldn't drink many of these but once in while make a nice change from IPA's."
"Pours a orangy copper with a slight head. Smells a little bready and citric. Generally sweet paired with just a touch of bitterness. Flavor is some caramel malt, some lemon, maybe a little spice of some kind and it can also be a little watered down at times. Moutfeel is thinner. I can be hit or miss with this one, sometimes it hits me just right and I dig it, other times I find it lacking, like its holding back on me and not giving me all the flavor it should."
"O - Fantastic beer overall, I'm definitely going to go back to the MLCC and pick up some more."

"O: This is a great beer, I have not had anything like it before, and that is commendable."

"O- Really enjoyed this brew! Unique taste compared to any beer or ale I have ever drank, will definitely have it again."
""
""
"O: A very solid beer. It's not my favorite. The sweetness really took my by surprise on my first sip, but I was able to really enjoy it once I got past the initial shock. It's just a nice beer to drink on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is nostalgic for me so maybe the score got bumped up a little. But tasty and unique flavor."
""
""
""
"I haven't had this one since the very beginning of my craft beer journey, lets see how it holds up. It is a rather attractive beer, with a hazy red-orange body and a nice head. The aroma is sweet malts. The taste consists of sweet malts and honey primarily, with a touch of graininess behind it. There's a bit of a fruit aspect with just a touch of hops as well. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coating, and the drinkability is alright. Overall, it's a decent beer, but nothing special. A good gateway beer for sure, it was for me."
"Nice syrupy body."
""
""
""
""
"O- decent. Wouldn't seek out again, though. Middle of the road. Try for your self"
""
" Not sure if I could have more than 2 or 3 in an evening, but very solid and a well done maibock. I actually preferred on tap to the 12oz bottle, the bottle had a bit more bite where the tap was a little more balanced which had me finishing and ordering another in no time."

A good 4-5 times a year I find myself saying ""You know what? Tonight's a Dead Guy night", and it's never done me wrong."

"Trying the Dead Guy Ale for the first time in quite a few years. I do remember it being better. The beer poured a cloudy orange with thin head that is not lacing. The smell has malt and balancing hops...slightly sweet. The hops provide an initial punch of bitterness in the taste, but then the sweet malt helps to calm the pallet. ABV is present in the first few swigs and then settles as the pallet adjusts. The mouthfeel is a light to medium body with good carbonaiton. Overall it is a solid ale."

"This beer was just okay. I got it as a Christmas gift and was excited to see it was a Maibock as I like that style and usually don't buy that style until the spring. Although I didn't like it as much as say; Maibock by Capital Brewery, I think this is a perfect session beer. It had a decent, smooth, malty taste so it would be ideal to down 3-4 of them in a row. It had a nice copper color and there was a little bit more of a bitter hoppy taste than most maibocks. So I did like it, the beer just didn't wow me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not experienced at all with maibock-style beers, but I really like this one! A little too malty and filtered for my personal liking, but I'll gladly take one of these any day when offered. Seems to work well for any season of the year!"
""

"I have to say, I have had this beer many times both on tap and from the bottle. It is a very good brew. I have read all of the reviews and have racked my mind, because I couldn't quite agree with the citrus, carmel, Appel and floral reviews. They all are close, but to me the taste is plum or date/fig like. It has other notes, but the plum/date/fig really stands out to me. More so out of the bottle than tap. This is a great beer regardless of what taste you can put your finger on."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*Note: At the end of the bottle, it is no longer see through and you cannot see through it. Its just an orange color and is very cloudy at the end. It tastes a bit more hoppy as well. I just finished it and thought I'd note this, as at the beginning it was a different appearance."

"The foamy cap was small and unimpressive and left no lacing. Had a hazy appearance. Aroma was hops and malts evenly balanced. Taste was desent with nothing special going on. Malts and hops, no real hop flavor. A smooth mouth feel but also a bit watery. Overall a desent ordinary beer that lacks."

"O: It is good, but kind of a straight forward beer. Good enough for a regular basis drink, but not quite distinct enough to be a very interesting drink."

"O- Strong on flavor. Hops are a bit strong. I recommend for pale ale fans. I think this is a well crafted beer. It doesn't exactly hit my personal taste, but it is a great full flavored beer."
""
""
"O- Really enjoyed this one, almost too drinkable for the ABV, the lighter feel would be a bad thing in the cold, but on a hot summers day (as today is in Melbourne) it works very well. overall, very good in general and to my knowledge of the style."

"O - A really drinkable and balanced bock. Not extreme, but immensely flavorful. Goes down really easy. Bocks are not always my ""go-to"" style, but this is really worth a try if you're looking for that taste. As a hop head, I wonder what this would be like if they added a touch more hops - but, who am I to argue against big, bold, balanced flavors that go down this well? Nicely played, Rouge."

"Actually a little better than I expected. I was kind of expecting a malty, unbalanced mess, but it was nicely balanced and quite drinkable. A pleasant surprise. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to buy it (especially given Rogue's outrageous prices) but it's not bad at all. Recommended for a decent everyday beer if the price is right."
""
"Overall: This beer is the epitome of balance and has one of the best flavor profiles i can think of. It's delicious. the only issue I have with it is the excessive carbonation, but that can be made up for with a hard pour. Delicious."

"I'm a little surprised I've never reviewed this one before, I remember having a growler of this stuff last year but I guess never bothered entering it in here. I could drink this again for sure I just wish Rogue didn't cost 8$+ a bomber around here"

"Man, this was good. Made me proud to be from Oregon. It just looked nice, rich and deep honey color with a nice generous head and lace that hung around for a long while. It smelled nice with obvious bread and honey notes. Tasted simply good. Buttery and hoppy to the end. Starting sweeter then turning a great bitter than makes you want to leave it in your mouth all day. Felt good, pretty thick, which is to be expected. If you haven't had this, go pick it up. It's very worth it."

"The color is a cloudy amber. Appearance is improved by a generous head and tenacious lacing. Smells of rich malt, cocoa, hops, caramel, vanilla. Also woodsy, spicy and citrusy. Very complex aromas. Taste is great. All of the scents are realized, with cocoa, spice and roasted malt coming forward. Rinses down with a hops bite and perfect carbonation. Finishes silky smooth. So many complexities in the flavor. This goes beyond any Maibock or Helles bock I've had, which makes me question this designation above. This is simply a rich, rewarding ale with an abundance of positive qualities. One of the best."

"O: After checking some other reviews on here I think I may have gotten a passed due date bottle or maybe even an infected bottle. Even though this may be possible I still enjoyed this brew. I've had other brews by Rogue, but this is my first ever Maibock. This was an experience and I recommend that everyone should at least try this brew at least once. I've seen this in 6 packs all the way to a growler. People love this for some reason and I now slightly grasp why."
"Had 7 months later and noticed light berry fruitiness in nose..more nuttiness in taste."
"Cloyingly sweet, with a slightly bitter hop finish. Notes of caramel, honey, and grapefruit? An almost syrupy mouthfeel, with low carbonation. A tad overpriced, and possibly too subtle for a neanderthal like myself. Not my cup of tea."
"I'm not sure what rogue wanted out of this beer. It is an amazingly complex malt forward beer without the weight and power that so many have. It is also worth pointing out that Rogue only mildly over charges for this one (I guess on Dead Guy they have an excuse to not post the bottled on date?) and it is easily accessible so any craft lover should give it a shot. I think this is a beer that a great many people will really dig in today's 3x imperial hop explosions."
"Overall- A flavourful ale that is well balanced and easy to drink. Can see myself purchasing this again in the future. Rogue has some great offerings, although I wish they weren't as expensive as they are."
"O- this is an ok beer. im sure some will really enjoy it but it is just not my type."
"Dr: Very drinkable, expensive on draught (as an import at least), and of fairly good quality. I wish it wasn't so damned boring."
"O: A really good drinking beer. Light, dry, and refreshing."
"Poured a bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Light foam, dissipates quickly to a ring with a light film. Clear dark yellow. The smell is mostly malt with a little fruit. The taste is more fruity than I expected. Very nice, unusual, malty fruit. Carbonation and mouthfeel is good. Overall a good beer. Interesting flavor, easy to drink."
"O: Very pleasant beer to drink. The slight fruity quality is what makes it unique. The hops balance out the initial sweetness and leave nice citrus flavor. Nevertheless, it's a tad on the bland side, but still worth trying!"
"Overall, the first Rogue ale I ever tried, and certainly a standby classic every year around the first of November."
"Overall an enjoyable and satisfying drink."
"Pretty sharp carbonation adds a bit of a bite to the mouthfeel, would want this to be a bit smoother. Fairly dry too. Overall though, I'd say this is a good effort based on the taste. I can honestly say this one stands out to me as a unique brew, but not one I'd go out of my way to get again."
"O - Not bad."
"Overall- This Helles is delicate and just barely above being too bland. However, it is very refreshing and put balanced very well."
"Some carbonation in this one, medium body a little dry, slight bitterness on the finish but very refreshing and surprisingly drinkable."
"The alcohol is a tad high here but that wouldn't stop anyone from downing a few of these in a session. This doesn't seem like a Maibock or Helles Bock to me because of the hue and bitterness of this beer but regardless of the stylistic semantics, this is quite enjoyable and would be a decent go-to beer if it was more available and cheaper. It's easy to see why this is so popular on this site!"
"A well made, sessionable beer. Easy for the masses to like. Props to Rogues flagship for being able to be on tap in Cornfield, IL."
"I liked this beer a lot. Hands down my favorite beer I've ever had to date. It was great. Good balanced flavor, not too strong. A great surprise from an unexpected candidate. A perfectly sessionable beer. I think beers like this among many others are starting to convince me I'ma big fan of the unique craft beers that don't get enough credit."
"Overall: This is Rogue's bastard ale-lager flagship beer. It is a tasty and easy drinking beer and a solid choice for many occasions. The only thing that's off...is the price."
"Drinkability: Tasty and easy to drink."
"O: This has been one of my favorite beers for a while and probably one of the originals that introduced me to craft brews. I tried not to let my bias take hold, but I still think this is one of the best beers I have had. Highly recommended. Thank you Rogue."
"Overall = Worth it. If you can find it on tap a must get. One of many solid contributions from our friends at Rogue..."
"I had this beer out of the bottle frosted in my favorite mug. It had a golden brown color, with a nice two finger head on it. It had a fruity smell to it, as well as a hint of fruit to the taste. The mouthfeel was light but a bit chewy. Overall this was an excellent beer, I enjoyed every sip! I'll continue to look for this beer on tap wherever I'm at"
"Overall, this is certainly something different than just another pale ale or IPA to serve as the brewery's flagship, but despite that uniqueness, it just doesn't feel all that special."
"Overall - a very sessionable well made brew that I will grab when it is available"
"Great hop cut to a sweet bock. A bit hot but tasty enough to stick with. Not what I'm after, but I get the fuss now."
"GREAT brew."
"I drank it straight from the bottle so I didn't notice the color or head. it did have a nice hoppy smell with a heavy malt smell. overall it's a good beer."
"Overall: A very nice beer with good balance, great taste, and a pleasant finish."
"O: Really enjoyed the balance on this one. Reminded me of an English Ale, as I don't have that much experience with Maibocks that aren't fruity. Will try the John John soon."
"O - I've tries dead Guy many times over the years. He's more of a nostalgia beer that is nice but not noteworthy. Very good with food."
"A rich and tasty beer overall, but not one of the better examples of the style, IMO."
"O-solid beer I could really start to like"
"O: A very fine beer. Something that I could drink on a regular basis (if I had that kind of cash in AL), but also of a high enough quality to actually warrant a review."
"It pours with a quick dissolve foam head and a good lacing. The aroma has a slight citrus and heavy yeast component. The taste is of Pacman yeast and citrusy hops with some malt background. It has a decent carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is a pretty good beer with a heavy yeast component and citrusy hop character. It is a good beer, with a interesting and complex flavor profile."
"O - A very distinct and interesting brew that truly has its own character. Slightly sweet and slightly hoppy, there are flavors here for everyone. Well worth a try but it can get expensive (I see it go anywhere from $12-16 a six pack in the northeast). I did not enjoy the Double Dead Guy in the bottle or on tap however, it was just far too sweet and boozy. The regular version has just the right flavors in the right amount for my taste."
"Rich, warming, full-bodied with a solid, medium effervescence. Better on tap but what isn't, right?"
"Leaves a wet, sour taste on the tongue. A nice, thick body with smooth, wet finish."
"Cheers!"
"Overall i am very very impressed by this beer, this is my first Maibock and im now a fan of this style because i know Rogue does an exelent job on their different styles"
"O: a standard go-to ale, very reliable and it hits the spot. It's not a mind-blower by any means, but, much like Fat Tire, it is an ale you can rely on."
"O: A very solid beer. Decent flavors and is definitely a beer I could drink a couple of in a night."
"O- Great mix of maltiness and hoppiness. Very sweet, but doesn't ""oversweeten"" the palate."
"O – Great balance of bready malts, herbal hops and caramel sweetness."
"Overall: Very drinkable. Very balanced. The rogue yeast and malt taste seems to repeat itself in many rogue ales which makes sense as they seem to have it down."
"This is a highly refreshing, highly drinkable beer. I hope I can try it on tap in the future."
" Not the perfect ale for me, but is a good beer with ligh malty and caramel flavor with a mix of fruity essence."
"O- Easily drinkable, tasty, and refreshing."
"A brew worth savoring, Dead Guy has a lot going on. Not really sure where it sits in the beer spectrum, but I like when brews refuse to be definable. Expensive, but worth a go!"
"Overall I'am impressed by this one quite enjoyable."
"89."
"Pours a hazy dark amber color. The head is off-white and has decent retention. There is a single ring of lacing on the top of the glass and becomes patchy further down. Looks pretty good. Nose is mostly malty up front but has a nice floral hops balance. I get cajeta, a slight hops bitterness and a touch of honey. The taste is very earthy and floral. Still getting some honey. Bitter hops shine through in the middle and the taste ends with a light coffee,caramel flavor. The mouth feel is soft, medium in body and the carbonation is on the high side. All in all not bad. This is one of the beers that kick off my love for craft beer. I don't drink it as often because of the price tag. 12.99 a six pack. I swear i used to be able to get this beer for under 10 dollars."
"O- a really nice drinkable beer. Has enough different flavors going to make it a beer that you can continue to enjoy."
"This pours a nice hazey copper with a thin white head. I has a real good fruity smell and after taste. It's a light to medium feel and very drinkable. Before I knew it the sixer was gone and I was left wanting more. Have to say this may be one of my favorite beers. I'm confused as to why it's listed as a Maibock/Hells Bock and the bottle says it's an Ale."
"Overall: Nice brew, very drinkable although quite sweet."
"I have to admit I'm a bit confused by the style. Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops as much as the next guy (and maybe even more than some), but I didn't think they really fit here."
"Overall: Wasn't sure to expect here, but this is a very satisfying and drinkable brew. Not sure if I would shell out for a six pack, but I enjoyed this for what it was. Worth a try at least once for everyone."
"O: All of the Rogue ales seem to share a similar malt profile and I must admit that it's one of my favorites. This brew is truly a classic and, as others have mentioned, for a Maibock to be a brewery's flagship ale is pretty impressive. This one in particular packs a good malt/hop balance and comes off quite quaffable. This is definitely a ""mood"" beer, and when I'm in the mood for the style, this one always comes through. Cheers!"
"On tap at Mellow Mushroom, PCB. Clear amber with a thin head and decent lace. Smell is malt, caramel and yeasty grapey. taste is dry and malty with a bit of hop bitterness on the back end. Very nice, refreshing and drinkable. Good beer for pizza. Good carbonation and a light, highly drinkable mouth. Clean on the finish. Overall very good."
"A real classic in my opinion. Amber/copper color, brown sugar and hoppy aroma. Nuttiness to the flavor that I don't find in many other beers. Something sweet is tasted as well. It's not quite moleasses but it is close. Easy drinking and fun as well. Plus, you've got to love a flagship beer that's a maibock. I feel like this one of those beers everyone should try once, like SN pale or #9. If you've never tried Dead Guy, give it a shot."
"Arrived a copper brown with a thin lacing of head. Nose is of sweet malts. Taste is apples and caramel with a mild hop bite in the finish with a hint of alcohol. A few sips even seem to taste similar to a candy apple. medium bodied and warm."
"O: A good bitter ale which I thought could be better if the aftertaste was toned down."
"This is a beer I've had several times, thought it would be good to review. The beer poured a mild amber into my pint glass, lots of bubbling throughout with a one-finger head. The smell was slightly sweet, nice and malty. Very easy on the mouth, tasted lighter than I remembered. Had a very clean flavor and there was a sweetness I couldn't place, maybe just the malts pronouncing. Overall a very drinkable, starting point beer."
"always enjoy revisting an Oregon winner."
"O: I can see where people are coming from when they say that Rogue isn’t worth the price they charge. I wouldn’t pay for a bottle of this stuff again, especially considering what I paid for just a small bottle. And, while I’ll keep trying their stouts and darker creations, I don’t think I’ll be working too hard to get any of their lighter stuff. It’s strange to see such a line in a brewer’s abilities, but I guess not everyone can make a mind-blowing light, lager-style ale."
"Dead Guy poured out as a light copper color. The head wasn't very impressive here and neither was the lacing. The smell of the beer has a decent amount of hop aromas that are balanced with some malts. The taste of this beer is decent. Nothing too over the top, some grainy malts and a bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth but it also felt a little watered down. Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer. Yes it's drinkable but just falls short to me."
"Poured a 1"" egg cream colored head. Interesting hazy nectarine colored body. Smells like a BMC lager along with malt. Taste has some sweet malts and a fairly bitter finish. Body is thicker than average, coming off more like a rich tripel. Basically, for the American tastes of clear easy drinking beer this is a step up across the board yet still enjoyable by all, craft drinkers or BMC drinkers alike."
"i love rogue beers in general but this one is one of my favorites"
"Overall Impression- This is my second time having this ale and I have to say, the second time was much better! I'm not sure if I had a bad batch/bottle or it was overdue, but man, this is fantastic! Great balance of grain/malt and very drinkable. With the label alone, this beer is easy to buy but knowing that theres a good beer inside, even better!"
"It has a good mouthfeel, a little buttery and carmely with a very sweet finish. Also a little bit hoppy. Overall a great beer to drink."
"Overall: A very solid bock that packs a good malty punch."
"No off-flavors and the overall drinkability make this a solid beer choice. There's definitely a reason they sell a lot of this one."
"O: Good beer. The smell could use a lot of work. And the scratchiness in my throat? Like something got stuck there. Will have to give others in this style a shot."
"Not my favourite beer style, but I think this is a decent American version of it."
"Pours a light burnt amber color with small amount of creamy tan head. Slow sticky lacing noticed. Aroma is of some hops, caramel, roasted nuts, and a bit of yeast. Taste is of caramel, walnuts, some yeast, light on the hops. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and fair with carbonation. Overall a good, fairly light ale."
"Overall, quite enjoyable, tasty brew. For how much I have to pay for it here in Ontario, don't know if I'd run for it. But tasty nontheless."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas but a bit too sweet for my liking."
"O - Drinkable for sure, interesting enough, but nothing really too complex. This would be flexible with a number of dishes or sessionable as the alcohol isn't too high."
"Lager clarity and finish while sustaining a good amber ale flavor throughout minus the yeasty characteristics, pretty well done and my first dive into Rogue."
"This is a good beer to have when you just want to unwind, relax and appreciate a good beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy bronzed orange with a small whitish head that retains well typically. Nutty aroma, bready, with roasted malts, hints of dark fruit. Caramel malts in the taste, bready, with pine hops coming through, with hints of raisin. Medium body and pretty drinkable. Not something I'd drink casually, but once in a while it's nice."
"Drinkability: 1 bomber was enough for me, Probably won't buy this one again, I thought it was a bit out of Balance, Not enough carbonation or malt to hold a proper head. I though it was just OK, but it's not the style of beer I like. A decent beer if you like the Style."
"Drinkability is there considering that in my mind, someone had stuck their toes in my beer. Overall a pretty decent beer."
"O/D - I remember more hops in this but maybe I wasn't used to hops as much. Balanced but I expected more hops. Not bad though."
"M: Light and refreshing, good amount of carbonation, goes down very easily."
"O – I like this good beer but will not likely seek it out again at my local price point ($12 a sixer), unique unto itself, well balanced, nothing outstanding 3.5"
"This would be a great beer to have with food as it is relatively mild in flavor intensity. The beer poured a nice orange/amber with little head. It had a refreshing smell of fruits like apricot and citrus but with faint smells of malt. This was a good casual beer to have, my only suggestion would be to intensify the flavor a bit as I found it to be a bit too mild."
"O - I haven't had one since last summer. Its as good as I remember. Its hard to describe but I just enjoy the warmth this brew gives me. I love Maibocks anyway and this one is a very good one. Very drinkable any time of year."
"A very sessionable Maibox. A classic, go-to!"
"O- Great meal beer, well rounded. An excersize in malt complexity with hop balance in a light bodied ale."
"D: This is an excellent intro to craft beer (as mentioned above). It's available basically everywhere and has some nice complex flavors without being overpowering. Overall a solid beer."
"O: It was ok, again a great hop presence would have made this a better beer, for me at least. Its fuller body makes it a tough one to drink a bunch of as well."
"O: A very good beer and one that I think has a pretty unusual taste character. I have not experienced this style very much, but I like this one and must try others."
"I absolutely loved this bottle. 650ml bottle with no date on it. Smelled of caramel and malt very in your face. Taste was sweet and definitely memorable (being my first bock). Will definitely try again, and again, and again. The mouthfeel was great, I want to say almost syrupy but hesitate to being that it went down so smooth. It is 6.5% abv after all so if it ain't going down smooth there's a problem. But this beer is so great. I wish it was cheaper here because I could drink this all the time. Definitely a smooth tasty beer worth the extra pennies."
"Really good beer. I'll definitely have more."
"Bottom line is that this is a very drinkable beer that I will certainly be coming back to as summer approaches. With a great and complex blend of flavors Rogue delivers a pleasing brew."
"O- A good ale with nice carbonation. Not exceptional by any standards but fairly easy to drink, refreshing, and tasty. A decent brew for the price, and perfect for a mid-range beer, not to light, not too dark."
"O - A pretty good beer. Nothing absolutely spectacular, but this one is definitely one I'd like to have again sometime."
"Drinkability: Verynice. First beer of this style, so hard to put my finger on what the style should taste like. Very enjoyable beer though. Apologizes for brief review."
"Overall- Wow this is unlike anything I have ever tried before, the smells are hard to put a finger on and the taste is equally hard. Sweet on both the palate and the nose with lots of bready malts in both as well. “Dedicated to the Rogue in each of us” is a very good statement because this beer doesn’t want or try to be like any other beer out there. I’m not sure but after reading some of the other reviews maybe us Canadians get the old crappy batches because my review sounds miles off from the others? I dunno a very interesting beer from the offering I bought and I probably wouldn’t seek it out again, I’m stunned and this is the first time in my short reviewing career."
"Poured on tap at an Ale House, the beer was served in a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy, deep, copper coloring with no trace of head. Aromas are rich caramel, with a good dark-sweet character to it. Flavor is toasted malt and caramel notes again, with a very slight peppery hops spicing peeking through, and some grapefruit/citrus ccharacteristics, as well. The aftertaste almost has a sour tone to it, and the finish is dry and crisp, with a hint of bitter from those late blooming hops. Easy drinker, and it goes with anything foodwise. Can't go wrong here!"
"Overall this is an excellent beer. The flavors are well balanced and delightful. This is a very refreshing beer for the spring, but fortunately available throughout the year."
"O - I thought this was good but not great. Well worth a try."
"O - An excellent beer with great taste, smell, and appearance. If I murdered someone, got caught, was found guilty in a court of law, sentenced to death, and was offered a last meal - I'd think about requesting this."
"D - Very drinkable, overall a great beer!"
"Overall: Overall the beer had a nice aroma and complex flavor to match. I found it very enjoyable, and would definitely recommend this to any beer drinker."
"O: A pretty smooth brew – not overbearing, but a nice kick."
"Springtime is the perfect time to enjoy this hearty, rich maibock that has a dryer, richer, more hoppy experience. Its a great transition from the heavy beers of winter to the lighter ones of summer. Hell I drink this all year round. So sit back and enjoy this wonderful brew."
"Pours a semi-clear copper orange with minimal head and minimal lacing. Aromas of bitter hops, some maltiness and (oddly enough) corn flakes. The bitterness really dominates the flavor all around with bits of caramel occasionally coming through. I found it difficult to drink and personally could not recommend it to anyone looking to step away from the mass produced commercialized stuff. That said, some people love this beer, but for me its pure mediocrity."
"O- a well-crafted brew, but not as interesting, bold or appealing as a number of other Rogue brews."
"Overall - I would drink this beer again. It's a little too expensive ($6/glass at my local pub), but on the whole...I like it and I would pay that price every once in a while."
"In all, this is one complex and delicious beer. Almost fun to drink."
"i really like this one. easily a go-to...not super adventurous, but damned delicious. think i found a new favorite."
"o: very nice flavors although its a little lighter than other beers of the style definitely a good session beer"
"Overall: I think I may have gotten a bad beer here because it doesn't fit the profile I thought it would."
"Flavor is instantly sharp on the palate, with a toasty graininess. I get some warm fruit hints, as well. And, a little alcohol burn in the finish. Enjoyable, with plenty of flavor. Superb!"
"Overall its a solid beer and an old favorite, my total score is based on my overall experience with the beer and not my most recent tasting."
"OVERALL: Again, one word can sum up this beer: meh."
"Poured a a cloudy translucent orange-brown colour with a light tan head that disappeared quickly. The colour was absolutely beautiful. I'm wary of such beers, but the taste did not disappoint. The smell was citrusy. It really didn't have much smell at all. The taste was quite pleasant as well. It had a little more hops than I'd like, but I'd expect that in a maibock. Not nearly as disgusting as Sierra Nevada's take on this style with their Glissade beer. The taste is pleasantly sweet with a strong citrusy hop overtone. For a hoppy beer, it's really very easy to drink. I don't taste any malt undertones, but I can clearly SEE that malts were not skimped on, so maybe I'm congested or maybe the citrusy hops just overpower everything else."
"It's a nice beer for the style. Not my favorite style but still enjoyable."
"Being a huge New Belgium fan, I considered this beer to be a ""Fat Tire"" of Oregon. After tasting and noticing the style and ABV I realized this is no where near a pale ale styled beer. Its a very interesting take on a session beer. There's really not much more to say about it. Its an amazing beer that should not be overlooked. As I said i'm super stoked about trying their Shakespeare. This brewery obviously has a passion for making darker beers, and making darker beers more session worthy if you will. Usually a semi-strong alcohol taste lowers the drinkibility, not in this case, this is a very drinkable, very well balanced beer. Stay thirsty my friends."
"O: well done. Great for a flagship, can see why so many people drink this on a regular basis."
"Overall - ""Sweet Nectar of the Gods"" (I highly recommend trying this beer and it would be an absolute delight with BBQ)"
"O: It seems as though the MLCC has to mark most bottles from the U.S with a sticker stating a different Abv. It's been the case with all Rogue and Lost Coast products. Anyways this one is at 7% Abv. I thought this beer was going to be a lot more comlex but it's more of a simple beer. I don't know if I could drink this all night but I could have a few before I would look for something a bit more bold."
"I have had this beer numerous times, most of which is from the bottle. It has a great dark murky amber look it that gives off a sweet but strong sense of hops smell to it. This beer has a very smooth hop taste to it that finishes easy. I taste caramel, apples, and pears when I drink this beer. The flavor is strong but not over powering. This is a good beer to have after a long day of work. Cheers"
"D: One of the all time best flagship brews out there. Nice and extremely drinkable."
"D: I think the beer is ok. I'm not a huge fan of this style of beer so I don't really want to drink more."
"o: I feel the flavors here are very good though they don't come out as well as I wish they would. A very good brew and I'd love to try it again, though I hope they brew one with more emphasis on the flavor being stronger."
"I love how Rogue blends their malts together to give a really rich thick taste in a lot of their beers. The hops sort of take a backseat to this beer but they start to shine through more with each sip. One of the very few Rogue beers you can get in a 6 pack but I'm glad they put this one in 6 packs because its an outstanding beer."
"This beer pours a darker amber color with small head. The small is a bit light, and malty. The taste is strong very malty, no other flavors are present, this beer is just for those who want beer and nothing else. The powerful taste stays on your palate, which isnt a bad thing. Overall this is an excelent beer, one of a kind."
"Slainte."
"Slight 1/2 inch fizzy white head slowly dissipates to a ring on top. Pale amber body, cloudy. Whiff of fruit in the aroma. Initial light bitter taste with light hops in the finish. Light, lively mouthfeel. Cloudy body makes this look like a wheat beer - didn't taste like it though. Still better than a lot of other ales I've had."
"Very drinkable. Good straight out of the fridge, but more so as it warms. I knocked it up a half point."
"Light milky amber with a thin eggshell head. Caramel slathered toast, barley and sweet fruity hop notes in the nose. Mildly sweet caramel cube flavor with some nice spicy hop flavors to balance. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A good beer although I'm not sure about this being a Bock of any kind or if that is Rogue's designation for this beer but it is a nice brew."
"I've seen this brew many times, but have no idea why I've waited so long to give it a try. I was quite pleased and would definitely have another."
"You better head back to Tennessee, Jed - GD"
"D: Thank you I'll have another! Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - Very drinkable, either on its own or as a session."
"I'm sure this ale would pair well with many foods so I'm not tossing aside for good, will have to try again with some grilled meats or over appetizers."
"D: Good but not great. Okay ABV, though it could do with either more booziness and boost flavour or less booziness and be lighter. It hangs a tad heavy on the palate, and isn't quite complex enough to enjoy all night."
"That alcohol hampers drinkability a bit for me. This is much, much better than the bottle of this beer that I've had. I like fruity and malty flavors."
"D - Thouroughly enjoyable beer and recommended"
"Overall a super refreshing ale that had a nice blending of malts, hops and citrus. And one that is most definitely worth drinking again."
"Hits the mouth a bit creamy and, given the ABV and its unique and palatable flavor, not a bad drinker."
"At $3 a pint night this was a super deal. This amber ale looks great with a nice head and rich reddish brown in color. The smell was nice but no aroma stood out. Very clean. The taste was tone of caramel and hops at the end. Perfect blend of flavors. Easy to drink, this brew made me smile. For $3 a pint I will have another."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is very sweet with a hop attitude. But it's also a disappointing introduction to a brewery I have heard a lot of good things about."
"D- At the height of it's infusion I would drink Rogue ""anything", any day, but it's not bad as a Summer sipper. Warm weather please come to Minnesota-- I am tired of shoveling snow. I promise, I 'd even drink some Dead Guy Ale."
"This beer had a very sweet smell when I popped the bottle.It has a hazy red color.A nice head after the pour.THe taste is a little bitter, fruity,but yet malty.This has the potential to be a all time favourite brew.Plus I dig the label on the bottle.Reminds me of a beer that Deadheads would like.I can't wait to try other brews by Rogue, of this great region of our country.Life is short,live free and always,always, drink great beer if you can."
"D - Very drinkable and tasty. Great warmer weather beer with a nice malt profile and perfect hop balance."
"D: Definitely drinkable. The price makes it a bit out of reach in my market, but as a tall, this is a very refreshing yet strong ale which I have come back to."
"This beer is slightly syrupy, but the long finish helps this beer glide right down your throat. I highly recommend it to anyone who prefers lightly hopped ales."
"This beer is served a hazy red body with a cream colored head. The smell of this beer is extraordinarily bready. There is a bread yeast aroma that is superbly potent. The taste however is surprisingly awkward. While there are minor biscuit and malt flavors the main body is rather fruity to my palate. There is almost a raspberry apple flavor that is strong on the tongue. The body is really quite watery, but for a lighter bock it's not too bad. The drinkability of this beer isn't all that great. The flavor combinations build to a point where the beer is really not too great to drink. I blame the strong fruit flavors. Not that great of a beer."
"Overall a solid and very drinkable beer, though it doesn't really stand out from the pack for me."
"This is truly gold in a glass."
"the CPJ"
"D: I will definitely be purchasing this again, but considering the oily thickness and overall sweetness I don't think I could have too many in a night. Overall a delicious beer that I would recommend."
"Surprisingly enough I really really enjoy the double dead guy, but not so much the regular dead guy.."
"D- I'm a little puzzled by this one, as it seemed a little off. Dead Guy is one of my old favorites, but I wasn't feeling this one. It also had the disadvantage of following a CBC Creeper, but measures were taken to cleanse the palatte."
"Drinkability - This is the first time I have tried this brew and I am very pleased. A nice balance; Not too hoppy, not too malty, and a nice alcohol kick that lets you know it means business. Very well balanced indeed. Would purchase again."
"This is by far my most favorite beer to drink on any occasion. The price can be a little steep but have a growler I can refill that makes it reasonable. It is not available at enough places, I have to go out of my way to find it. This beer on draught has no competition."
"The beer is quite drinkable, for a sturdy beer lover."
"D-Love this beer from rogue. This could be a great spring -summer beer. Even though i enjoyed mine in the winter. ITs a beer you can get 2-3 of in a night and be very satisfied."
"D-If you are a Bock fan, this is a good choice. Very drinkable beer, more than a sipper."
"Cheers, recommended."
"I haven't been this surprised by a beer in a long time. Absolutely delicious. And I just looked up there at the top of this page and see that it's 6.5% ABV. Holy Crap! I would've guessed 4%."
"A deliciously balanced beer with high drinkability. Alcohol is well hidden and sweet notes are not overpowering -- definitely a beer I will come back to. I've added this to my long list of favorites from Rogue!"
"Notes: In my opinion this a very well made and wonderfully balanced Maibock. (Dead on for the style.)"
"Overall: Definitely disappointed with this. Rogue XS Imperial Red is a better bet."
"One of my favorites from Rouge! Slightly darker copper appreance. Nice strong stench that fills your nostrils. It has a very unique strong taste at first but leaves a nice smooth after taste. I have never had it on tap but bottled is just as good I assume. Highly suggested if you have not tried and are a big Bock fan..."
"Drinkability - This, once again, is a solid, well rounded effort from Rogue. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite brewers. This brew is easily drinkable. Would work well at any point during the year. It is considerably sweet, so that may deter some, but it would still be enjoyable for me through several rounds. Worth a try if you haven't tried it yet."
"Had on-tap, in growler, and in bottle. Lived in Oregon for awhile so I frequented the brewery whenever I had the chance. Will always be one of the better Rogue offerings in my opinion. Perfectly well-balanced hops and malt with a smooth coppery finish. Reddish-brown in color and not hazy with a relatively strong abv%. Highly recommended!"
"great balance of hops and malts makes this delicious and drinkable."
"D: This is a pretty good brew that often gets over-looked due to the bashing of Rogue. When it's reasonably priced, it is well worth drinking."
"Drinkability: It's okay. A touch less taste than I remembered/expected, but not a bad beer at all. Personally, however, I'd be reluctant to put up $5 for a deuce-deuce of the sweet juice known as Dead Guy Ale."
"Overall, I was pretty upset with this purchase. I was expecting more."
"Drinkability: The Dead Guy is very tasty, I'd have another if I had one here. Definitely a beer to try more than once."
"First tried this on tap at the Edgewater Tavern in Chicago. It was something of an enigma then and it's something of an enigma now. Not that there's anything fundamentally wrong with that."
"Drinkability is quite good. With a well-balanced flavor profile, a pleasant mouthfeel and a relatively light ABV, Dead Guy Ale is very drinkable. Rogue has let me down before with their line of oddball beers, but I'm liking this brew. Wouldn't mind knocking back a couple of these every once in a while."
"Easy to drink and can be a good sessions beer. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: A great session beer. Nothing terribly innovative or particularly interesting, but it's a great go-to when you are looking for a simple, balanced, well-crafted ale."
"Drink: Very nice session beer. Not my favorite of the style, but still up there."
"Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable, would definitely enjoy another."
"Got in a 64oz. 1 gallon glass jug, poured into glass stein. The appearence is almost an ""apple cider"" look with a fast fading head. Very pleasurable aroma with hits of citrus and hoppiness. Mellow and smooth to taste with a faint aftertaste fading to a dry ending. Very drinkable beer as an American Ale. Would drink again if given the chance. Looking forward to the Double Dead Guy Ale."
"Pours a clear orange with a 1"" pillowy white head that fades pretty fast and leaves a sticky web of lace all the way. Smells bready and sweet, with hints of apple and white grape juice and vanilla. Tastes of real sweet malt but not overly sweet, citrus and tropical fruit, nutty, yeasty, bready, mild bitterness. Had a stucky and syrupy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Highly drinkable in my book."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- This beer is to be sipped for sure. Im gonna drink this very slowly."
"Slight tastes of candied malts, with a raisin bitterness taste on the finish."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass or on tap. Cloudy orange pour with a huge foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly hoppy. It reminds me of an DIPA that has sat around awhile and had its hoppy profile start shifting to a more malty balance. Flavor is malty with some citrus/fruity notes to it. Finish is a clean and slightly hoppy feeling on your tongue. I love the uniqueness of this beer."
"Overall: OK but would not actively seek this out. I'll finish the sixer but unless I detect a huge difference in the flavor, I'll likely not return. Very dry and bitter on the end with no lingering flavor. No delicious hoppiness....just bitter...no real complexity or depth here."
"Pours a nice one finger head, looks like an IPA to me, very orange and hazy, not hazy like a Belgian wheat though. Looks decent, head is fading quickly though. Smells hoppy in the front end, with a slight malt note in the back end. Maybe a slight fruit or citrus note hidden in there somewhere too. Wow, taste is very smooth, probably the smoothest hoppy beer I have ever had, granted it's not as hoppy as some beers, but still. Pretty simple beer all together though, at first you just get that smooth feel and then come the hops and malts, if there is any fruit or citrus, it is almost undetectable in the taste. Pretty good beer all together, nothing outstanding, but pretty good."
" Colby"
"D: I found this drank fairly easily, it's just about standard ABV with a light body and nothing overpowering. I do think a little more carbonation would help make it more crisp and drinkable."
"Cloudy/hazy burnt tangerine with a decent 1.5"" white head. Diminished to a thick ring with spotty lace. Prominent whiff of alcohol and very little else to back it up. Hint of citrus and grass, maybe some cereal grains in there somewhere. The flavor is a little better, with a healthy blend of honey and caramel followed by delicate touch of grapefruit. Herbal and grassy finish. There's a huge turnoff here... why is my bottle of Dead Guy metallic tasting? Metallic finish kind of kills the 4.0 I was gonna give it... Hearty and almost ""meaty"" texture. Nicely carbonated and quite smooth. Almost thick to the point where it coats the palate but actually gives a very balanced body between sweet and dry. Was going to give better drinkability, but this metallic flavor is getting on my nerves.... along with the crazy alcoholic nose. Gah..."
"D - Quite drinkable, I thought. Only deterrent is the aforementioned sweetness that has a tendency to override the palate-cleansing hop flavors."
"D= This is a very drinkable beer with a decent abv and well balanced flavor that i will buy again."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty great. A little think on the mouth feel but a great drinkability. My first from Rogue but not my last. A good choice."
"D: Very pleasant and drinkable beer, enjoyed very much!"
"Overall I liked this beer a lot. As I said in the taste, it reminds me of a mild Fat Tire. It has plenty of spices and flavor without overwhelming the natural malt and hops."
"D-I honestly have never heard of a Mailbock but I'd be certainly willing to try another if this beer is a standard example of one. A fantastic beer that is great for all points in the day."
"Good stuff. Can always have more than a few."
"Overall, an excellent beer, wish I had tried it sooner."
"Overall, a really good maibock. I'd have this years ago when I first got into craft beers and hated it. Glad I tried it again as I liked it much, much better this time around. Recommend especially if you want to try the style. Avail here in TX. Rotation - while it was good, I'm in a long term hop phase so don't see being a 6 pack or bomber but maybe the occasional single or tap. [O;O]"
"D - possibly sessionable at 6.5% ABV. didn't really know what to expect out of this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised."
"M - Very little carination and a medium body make this an enjoyable beer, different in body then many maibock beers I believe this beer to be more flavorful then a typical maibock. I like this beer but would like it to be more biter. I find this to be a highly drinkable and respectable beer i also like that it is easy to find even at bars that are not full blown beer bars."
"Notes - My first Maibock, interestingly called an Ale yet classed under a German lager...."
"I like it a lot, but it does have a rather hefty price tag on this side of the states"
"side note: Cap had some kind of plastic insert that would keep beer from touching metal cap and also better seal beer for carbonation. Was very impressed with this feature."
"This is a classic craft beer.. the definition of a flagship brew, IMO. Everyone who's everyone that's into the craft scene must try this at least once."
"I get this on tap every time I go to my local pub. It is a great beer. The aroma is all malt with a slight amount of hops in the background. It is a very tasty brew whether it is hot or cold out. Very smooth but full feeling. I could drink this all night."
"D: This beer is highly drinkable and is one that I will drink again. Not one of my all time favorites though."
"This drinks very well for the amount of grains you are getting. I usually grab a couple of these on tap at this local English style pub."
"Drinkability-Really good ale, could probably do this one all day."
"The taste starts with the sweet malts and finishes with small hop bite that leaves a nice aftertaste. A very good beer. Definitely a beer that will be looked for again."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not my favorite style, but this is definitely a good representation. I don't ever buy this beer, but this was a gift, and one that I was happy to receive."
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy, copper body with 1 finger of white head (decent retention & some light lacing). The aromas are a nice combination of sweet malts and citrus hops. I get a nice citrus / piney taste coming through initially, but its not overpowering and quickly balances out with some fruity / caramel malt flavors. Also picking up some pepper-like spices throughout consumption, and it has a nice, somewhat bitter finish which i really enjoy. Medium bodied, proper carbonation, and fairly drinkable."
"D- Good drinkability. Rich malts are not quite my thing so I can't put back too many... but it is overall very clean and an enjoyable non-offensive brew."
"D - Nice well rounded beer, would drink again."
"To me, this is an American ale of a high standard. Deep golden copper with a trace of head and lots of thin lacing. Low carbonation. Full of flavour - the sweet notes of candied sugar (not sure if this is just the malt though), pleasing tart hoppiness without too much astringency or excessive bitterness, nice mouthfeel that's not too sticky nor too bland, and very drinkable. Aromas aren't too strong, and this is out of an almost-snifter, because of the low head retention and carbonation, but that's OK. This is a solid beer with an attractive appearance, pleasing taste and cool bottle artwork, that I will gladly drink again any time I get the chance. But I wouldn't call this a bock of any description."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange/amber color. An off-white head recedes, but sticks to the glass. Smell is rich, smoky, slightly sweet malts. Very nice. Taste starts and ends bitter, with the middle part being those pungent malts. Very good balance. Beer drinks smoothly, has enough alcohol to feel it, and is easy to drink. A quaff-able one, this is. Very nice."
"Strong hoppy notes balanced by a smooth malty flavor make this a very drinkable beer. Pours a solid amber color with a soft foamy head. Finishes a little harsh for my liking and lingers with you for a while. This is definitely Rouge Brewery's flagship beer... for something a little more exciting and unique, try one of their other 22oz specialty beers."
"Drinkability: Easy on the taste buds and a little complex. Makes a great fall beer."
"Drinkability- smooth and sweet. But just a bit too sweet for me."
"D: Pretty drinkable, the big presence of bready malt seems to get a little heavy by the end of the glass but overall it is solid. A good beer, but overpriced and way overhyped."
"D: Great. As mentioned above, this brew ability to be many things at once makes this very drinkable year round."
"Drinkability: goes down great. I could pretty easily polish of a 6 pack of these in a night"
"mouthfeel light carbonation"
"Medium body, higher carbonation, and some dry feel. Drinks pretty well, but a fairly forgettable beer to be honest."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy copper color, with a thick white head. The smell is of caramel or a sweet munich malt. The hop aroma and flavor is spicy, with hints of being noble. The mouthfeel of this beer is light, and I would consider this drinkable and well balanced."
"i can say i appreicate not nose of this one gladly not having any excessive corn cereal to it. looks like a flatter pale. feels like one too with the distinct lace of syrup that gives it a bit of warmth and sweetness moreso than just a pale. can feel the higher abv in the slight bitter heat. its above average in taste but still doesn't have a distinct bitter munich rich straw that i would like to feel. very mine pine and sarsaparilla bitter with a tad of protein. not bad. had better americans though."
"I could drink this all night. Smooth, crisp, light in the body. Feels nice going down. I wish I got more than one bottle of this! This is everything I would want an ale to taste and feel like. Very close to being perfect."
"Deschutes if the best local beer available in all the supermarkets."
"D - a nice hop character with a great malt backbone, and the sweetness brings it all together, very tasty and sessionable"
"I had the 650ml, 6.5% bottle. The appearance was good, a nice amber color. The smell wasn't all it should be, but average. The taste above average, in fact, very good, but no top shelf kind of beer taste. The mouthfeel was great, smooth with just the right hint of hops. And drinkability was exceptional. Went down great and no real lasting aftertaste but the hops, which I loved."
"D - Awesome. I could drink many of these and will definitely buy it again."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a nice creamy off white head. Nose is malty caramel, yeast, floral hops. Taste is sweet malts, earthy floral hops, with some bready notes. Palate is full body, good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malts balanced very well with earthy bitter hops. A very nice smooth and flavorful brew."
"Drinks: fairly light and refreshing. Certainly this is Rogue's most popular beer, though I don't feel it's their best."
"On tap at BJ's (don't remember which one) in CA. Hazy, dark amber hue. Aroma is of citrusy hops and caramel malt. Hoppy, citrusy taste with hints of caramel. Full, tangy body. I would not guess it is a Maibock, it tastes more like American IPA to me."
"Pours a Slightly hazy golden amber color. Head is just over an inch tall in my coke glass and has great retention. As is slowly recedes it leaves fun traces of lacing. Smells of sweet malts with slight hop smell. The taste really blew me away, I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did. It is malty with just enough hop to back it up, the balance is perfect to me. The taste is clean and finishes well. You always want another drink. Anyways, the most prominent taste is a sweet malt followed by some earthy hops. Has a nice smooth medium body with average carbonation. Overall this is a wonderful beer, only downside is high ABV and high price which make it not so sessionable, not that I wouldn't like to try. This is becoming one of my favorite beers, it's well balanced, just the right body for spring and fall, awful pretty and delicious to boot."
"This seems quite drinkable, although it may be a touch sweet."
"D- Rich and complex. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: good, but not great. May be a little too rich for its own good. It doesn't leave a yearning to have more."
"Tastes malty, earthy, some pine hops. Reminds me of a lighter Arrogant Bastard. Dry finish. The ABV is noticeable. Overall pretty drinkable with many kinds of food pairings. Good mix of malt and hops. Not sure what a Maibock is supposed to be like but this is a good beer that can be enjoyed year around."
"It reminded me of wine, but not for all of the bad reasons. I narrowed down that nomad thought to--grape taste. It had all of the accompanying beer pleasures: hops, carbonation, general sense of being awesome, etc."
"D: Could have these for a session. Also feel as though this would pair well with just about anything given the mood. Really would pick this up whenever I needed a go to beer."
"Flavor wise, the hops have been masked a little bit, but are still definitely prevalent in the flavor, but are not overpowering in combination with the malted flavors. There is a little bit of citrusy sweetness at the end, and it leaves a pretty dry taste in your mouth. It has a nice thickness, not too much carbonation, easy to down."
"D - above average beer, brewer built this beer with a clean crisp taste in mind; fruit flavors are overwhelming and welcomed with every sip; overall good beer and something I would drink a few of every once in a while"
"D - Very good maibock but might be a little too bitter for large consumption. I would still recommend it."
"D- good drinkability, I would definately have more of this."
"Overall, not a bad beer."
"I was more than a little surprised that I liked this ale so much, but I guess I shouldn't be. Rogue brews good stuff."
"Overall, a good beer. It kind of reminds me of Granite Brewery's ""Peculiar"". Not necessarily in taste, but in that it's hard to exactly peg or pigeon-hole it."
"D- It's a decent drinker. Maybe a bit more malt-centric and sweeter than some of my Maibock favorites. Something that would pair well with pizza. The growler is a bit gimmicky and a touch over-priced. Even the bomber and sixer prices are a touch high, in my opinion. This was really tough to rate. I don't think it's a traditional Maibock, yet still a pretty solid beer. I keep finding myself wanted to ""up"" or ""down"" each category by about 1/2 point."
"Drinkability is not so good. The one pint was all I could handle at the Old Chicago. If it's going to have a bitter dominance, I'd prefer citrus/pine/grass over aspirin any day.."
"This beer is very nice to look at. There's about 2 fingers of head on top of an amber clear beer. There is nice lacing as well. The smell is a little weak, with some sweetness, and floral hops, but really not much. The taste has a more prominent hop presence and is a bit light and fruity as well. The mouthfeel is smooth with good carbonation. This light tasting beer is very drinkable and good to have a few of in a night."
"Pours a moderate caramel-brown color with a light tan head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings some light floral hops over a body of caramel and some lightly-sweet bready malt. The flavor is a bit bready with some yeast characteristics. The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall, one of the first craft beers that I had, but not something that impresses me terribly these days."
"One of my favorites! Would love to find it on tap around me!"
"All in all, this beer tastes like iced tea. It has the look on iced tea too. If you like the tea flavor, then this beer is for you! I do love tea, so this one is good for me. Good to try once for the style."
"O: Doesn't knock my socks off, but the aroma made me laugh so it was worth the ride."
"D: Very enjoyable. Could drink this all night."
"Overall I really like this beer the nice hop kick to it is somthing I didnt expect coming into it, but I very much enjoyed it. Rogue is a great brewery and the beers I have had from them have all been great, next time I hit the old beer store I am going to get a couple of their brews I have yet to try, must say Dead Guy Ale is a great brew and is a must try. I forsee I will be drinking this many times again in the future. Cheers!"
"D - Could drink this all night. Great session beer, or any-time beer, honestly. This is my new ""go-to"" beer for expanding friends beer horizons."
"D- I love this beer this is the fist time I have tried it. I will keep this beer in my mind when I'm looking for beer that I'v already tried and like. I'm glad I got the last bottle at the store."
"Dead Guy Ale has a slightly cloudy orange colour. The head lasted less than a minute but it maintained some lacing around the edge of the glass. The smell is of floral hops. The taste is warm and malty with a hint of hoppy high notes. The maltiness intensifies as you swallow until some bitterness can be tasted. This beer feels pretty good in the mouth due to the decent amount of carbonation."
"D - Nice and drinkable, definitely a go-to if there's nothing else available."
"Lack of character and one-dimensionality of this beer precludes me from drinking it often, but at times, especially when it's available fresh in a growler, I'll get it and enjoy while the growler lasts."
"Pours a burnt orange with thin white head. Great sweet, nutty flavor with a dry hop finish. Balanced, Medium body makes you want to drink several (and I have). Not a MUST have from rogue, but it is a great go to brew."
"Thanks Rogue."
"D: Could have this all night. Excellent offering - moderate abv."
"This would make a good spring time beer FYI."
"amazing good would and could have it at any point any where beer isnt to heavy nor light its great"
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan head and great lacing. Smells of chocolate malts, vanilla, and some dark fruit. Tastes of vanilla, chocolate, coffee notes, roasted flavor, and some hidden hops. Mouthfeel is pretty nice. Drinkability is above average."
"Drinkability - I am fairly impressed with this beer. Very nice tasting beer that offers a lot to the senses. Overall, i can drink a few of these a nite, but would be a great beer to pass out at a party!"
"D- Nicely drinkable, nothing about it makes me not want to take another drink, overall this will be gone relatively quick. Could be a session beer, though i probably wouldn't want more than a couple at one time"
"I've had this before in the past and don't remember it being as bland/dull so maybe I'll revisit it in the future...especially for the price for a bottle, had more expectations."
"Listed as a Maibock / Helles. Always thought of it as an APA."
"Would like to find it on tap sometime."
"I had no problem pounding this pint and a half ..extremely drinkable ."
"In conclusion, this beer was ok. I'm not a fan of bock beers, so this was an experiment for me, frankly I'm still not a fan of them. Overall, it tastes like a bock beer and is probably a good beer for those who like the style."
"D: Decent session beer. Gets better with more sips. A safe pick at the bar."
"A: The head is thick and creamy and a light beige color, retention is good and coats the interior of the glass, medium orange to dark gold in color, crystal clear beer which permits great visibility to all the activity going on in this beer - 4.25, S: The nose is quite heavy on the malts and has a lightly toasted and malted milk ball aroma, I also perceive a touch of sweet caramel on the nose, no hops are really perceived - 4.00, T: The hops that alluded me on the nose are noticeable on the palate - significant bitterness, a mellow sweetness exists - somewhat doughy and/or cookie dough-like, there is an earthy and dry bite on the tail end of the beer - 3.50, M: Medium bodied and creamy - 4.00, D: Pretty nice representation to the style, very drinkable - 3.50"
"Then I got busy doing a few things as the beer settled in the glass. Upon my next sip, I was very impressed with how pleasant and balanced the flavor was. I started to wonder if this was intended to be a red ale. There's no prevalent sign of hoppiness or nuttiness, just a copper-colored ale that tastes great. Very drinkable. I will definitely have this one again."
"brewery!"
"drinkability is good and I could enjoy this beer quite a bit due to it's availability."
"D - Well balanced, but you gotta like hops to really enjoy this beer. Good but not great"
"Picked up a pre-packaged growler of this from the liquour store for a party, and, on a separate night, had a couple bottles at a thai restaurant for dinner. I will review the growler, as it seemed a little perkier and more flavorful. Dark garnet color, small off-white head. Lightly hopped, good caramel flavors, sweet, but not cloying so. A very drinkable, very enjoyable beer."
"drinks rather well. skirts many styles, and falls in between them all in search of balance. finds balance, and sticks in the middle of the road. safe."
"Seems like I have tasted a bunch of this over the last year. A nice option to add to any repertoire since it seems to be readily available. I ended moving this to a tulip which helped coax out the malty aromas. Along with malts I got toffee and something like bread pudding. This did need to warm up a bit for the aromas to come alive. The malty flavors are quickly matched by the hops. A nice bitterness on the finish. A very solid and balance beer. One I will grab whenever it is on sale."
"D - Extremely well-balanced beer. Alcohol level is appropriate. Great session beer."
"Final Notes: Definitely more of a session beer, and I must say it's kind of nice Rogue makes one. That said, it lacked the interest and off-the-wall characteristics I've come to expect from Rogue, and as such it was a bit of a disappointment. Still a great beer though."
"D- Very drinkable, no overpowering flavors. Not too high in alcohol and alcohol flavors a hidden."
"D: This is a personal favorite. I find it extremely drinkable due to its balance. I like to use this beer as a gateway to introducing friends to Rogue. This is a great beer and for me I often find myself comparing other ale's to this one for personal comparison and ranking. Enjoy! It's time for me to go open another one."
"This is a great beer, very drinkable."
"D - Well, I'm a Rogue fan but rarely buy any of their beer for some reason that I really can't explain. This bottle was gifted to me as a souvenir from a trip to Yellowstone. Glad it was...I haven't sampled this one in a really long time. It was one of the beers that got me going on craft beer many years ago...over the years, my pallette has changed and I prefer hoppier beers, but this one still hits the spot for me. The malty flavors and body that is achieved is quite good and the hops play off of this just about perfectly - never taking over and only serving to help show off the finer points of the malt. This is really smooth and I'm figuring this would go really well with something off the grill. Never thought of this as a Maibock before now, but surprising to me, this hits the style pretty well."
"Overall a decent beer but nothing too special. If someone handed me one i wouldn't refuse but on the same token i wouldn't buy it again."
"Taste is nothing special. It's sticky sweet up front, and almost harshly bitter on the finish. Not too much flavour complexity, either, mainly just sweet malt - no real caramel, toast, hops, or anything else. Just green-grassy malty sweetness, finishing with a neutral hop bitterness. Not bad, but nothing special, either"
"D: I could have 3-4 of these no problem. Truly interchangeable in that I could enjoy one (or more) during any season of the year. Malty and substantial enough for fall or winter yet light and drinkable enough for spring or summer."
"Overall, a very good beer, perhaps not unique or outstanding, but worthwhile."
"Overall not a bad beer, but not as flavorful as I was expecting. Would drink again if it was offered to me, but I probably wouldn't seek this out."
"Still more complex of course, but i get the feeling they were going for a cheaper beer (and taste shows). A tad watery, medium hop bitterness, thin and pale mouthfeel. Probably a mix of pale/amber/dark malt for this brew. Easily drinkable, but this is not a complement. This beer could easily be much better, but i feel like it's integrity was compromised somewhere along the way"
"Great label, one of the better Rogue bottles I've seen."
"Pours a cloudy red/apricot color on the verge of copper with a medium white head. The scent is malty with dark fruits and a fair amount of hops. I also get some caramel scents. The taste is exactly as it smells. On first taste I get a complex blend of malt, dark fruits, and caramel. Then I get a light hint of hops and bread. The mouthfeel is light, yet full of flavor. The drinkability is pretty high."
"Overall, a nice beer, but nothing that really pops out from the crowd."
"The light coloration and the boozy flavor don't do much for me (especially at only 6.5 abv) but the taste is satisfactory for something called Dead Guy, and if you want to man up and down a jug, the abv is just right. Yar!"
"The well-balanced nature of this brew adds significantly to its drinkability, which I believe is fairly high. It's great tasting, but goes down easily, with no major characteristics standing out."
"wise."
"Drinkability - This is the kind of craft beer that i wish people that never had craft beers before could try. Its tasty, smooth and rich. You can drink 4-5 of these no problem. Or you could session this with a friend."
"It's extremely drinkable, tasty with smooth finish. Overall a very enjoyable beer"
"D - Even though it's 6.6%ABV I would still consider this as a potential session beer. All in all it's a good beer with a nice balanced taste which struck a good compromise between favouring the malt flavour but still adding a nice edge of pronounced hops and subtle sweet flavours to the mix."
"Overall: Very solid beer overall, although I'm not sure it's really a Maibock. You could do a lot worse than this."
"D- Easy to drink and satiates your thirst quite well. Would probably get it again, but it's fairly expensive in Ontario's LCBOs."
"D: Average drinkability with no distinguished characteristics. Would take a pretty bad tap list for me to revisit."
"D- Absolutely spot on, this was quite a nice beer experience."
"Pours a bright amber-orange colour with slightly off-white head. Head dissipates without much lacing. Smell is incredibly fruity and lots of bready malt. Taste is quite sweet with a hint of bitterness. This reminds me of some English ales actually, though I may just be crazy (or wrong). Smooth mouthfeel, but a little bit under-carbonated. This is pretty expensive in Ontario so I don't drink it often even though it is available, but I would drink it more if the price were right."
"I didn't enjoy this as much as I used to. Perhaps my tastes have changed or I got an old bottle but it's still a good beer that I will not have a problem revisiting in the future."
"Simple straightforward uncomplicated brew, but very pleasant overall due to the famous Pacman yeast which improves as it nears room temperature. It's not a Maibock, but I'm not complaining."
"D - This one is easily drinkable, alcohol is nicely hidden, flavours are nicely balanced and all-around a very tasty beer. Highly recommended to anyone looking a nicely balanced hop offering."
"The mouthfeel is a succulent combination of creamy smooth malt and quenching hop carbonation; really perfect. It is easy to enjoy but full of deep and wide flavors making it an excellent beer for dinner. Spicy foods, anything off the grill, or deep tomato based pastas."
"D-Makes my cheeks warm. Tasty but a bit low on the drinkability scale."
"I thought upon ordering a draft of Dead Guy that I was familiar with the beer. I was very pleasantly taken aback by the distinctly good flavor of Dead Guy. It is a very nice amber color and has a terrific smell. It feels great in the mouth with a blend of spice. I don't recall appreciating this beer as much out of a bottle. Thanks to the folks at Shebeen in Charlottesville, VA for keeping in on tap and running great happy hour specials."
"Light, smooth, and pretty tasty. Not bad at all."
"for those who like cheese, it belongs with a brie double creme, that cheese brings the nutty taste on another level. good stuff"
"d - A very solid maibock. Lots of malts in the smell and taste. Have had it many times and would definitely order it again."
"D- Dead guy ale is a great brew that is incredibly drinkable. The emphasis of the honey makes the brew absolutely fantastic. The malt is pretty extreme in it"
"Drinkability- ABV is significantly higher than flavor or body would suggest. One could drink this in session, but beware the ABV."
"Overall, a unique and americanized interpretation of the style that is very enjoyable. Good beer to take the edge off of a hot day at work."
"Prost!!"
"Overall this tasted much better from the bottle than it did on-tap. Nicely nuanced malt flavors and a nice mouthfeel make this one worth a shot."
"D: Easy drinking at 6.5% ABV.  Definitely one that is very enjoyable to have alongside a nice meal."
"d - Absolutely, one of the most drinkable brews I've had! There's a lot going on in that beer, but not overwhelmingly so. Makes you want another."
" Drinkability is stellar, could of stayed there and pounded all afternoon into evening. Picked some up on way home from work, will keep revisitng this old friend with more frequency I believe!"
"Upon pouring this beer, a beautiful cascade of carbination formed a substantial head on this beer. The color is a golden amber that is just hazy enough to not allow clear sight through the brew. The head stayed full for quite a while and slowly faded off leaving behind delicate lacing. The smell of this beer gave of strong send of toasted malt and zesty citrus aromas. After my first taste of this beer, the citrus and bread qualities of this beer come to form. Its flavor is well developed and quite the oxymoron in that it is complex while keeping its simplicity. The toasted malt and sweet citrus make this beer quite drinkable, but if you savor this beer the malt and hop complexities truly take shape. A wonderful beer. I am looking forward to trying the other deal guy ales in this line."
"D: Exceptional. I really enjoyed this brew's feel. The breadlike quality in the texture is clean and smooth. I hadn't had a Dead Guy in a long time, but after this, I know I'll be having another soon."
"D - Damn. This may just have been the beer that I've been waiting for all my life. It's just made it into my top 10. With time and thought, it just might make top 5!"
"D - Especially given the price, the best selling point of this beer. Simple, yet complex enough to keep it interesting even at the end of a case."
"D - Even through I really enjoy this ale, I don't have the desire to have one after the other."
"Drink - An excellent session beer"
"One knock is that the bottle doesn't glow in the dark, I heard a rumor that it did and now I'm mad."
"Drinkability: Excellent taste and clean mouthfeel make it very drinkable."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter it appears a perfectly clear orange color with a finger of fluffy head that retains well and sticks in patches about the glass. Aroma is a mixture of buttery notes, citrus hops, a bit of sulfur and quite grassy. Taste is grainy with earthy and herbal hops. The grain character is a bit sweet with a slight hint of the alcohol accents the hop bitterness. The feel is a bit watery and light with a modest amount of carbonation. There is a lingering presence of the hops left in the mouth. As it warms, the aroma takes on some notes of lemony citrus that can also be picked out in the flavor as well. Overall not bad but nothing to go out of your way for either."
"Poured an opaque dark orange. The cream colored head was soft froth that lingered and stuck to the glass. Smells like spicy wet grass and oak. Lots of flavors happening: Firstly, sweet malt and nutmeg, candied yams. Then comes the tingling hops, all the while the alcohol peaking through. The feel is the best category for me with this. It is sticky and smooth and leaves a bitter, dry funk on the tongue. I love to drink this beer. It is easy to find at my local Wal-Mart and is a go to when I want a balance of sorts."
"D: Very quaff-able. A good session brew."
"Actually didn't know the style of the beer when given one. Seemed a little Scotch Ale-like in its alcoholic content & overtone. Nice ruddy brown hue with a sticky tan lace and full, bitter-yet-smooth character. Honey and marmalade hints. Maibock you say? Nice!"
"D: very drinkable beer that went down great in the hot sun poolside with a cuban cigar."
"D- I will definitely buy this beer again. To me it's not a sipping beer, it COULD be, but it's also a great ""anytime"" beer. this is one you can just start drinking on at anytime whether it's a special occasion or just wanting to wind down at the end of the day. This is an excellent beer."
"D: Definitely one you could drink a few of, but of course with a higher alcohol content you wouldn't want to just sit here pounding them all day."
"D: I could drink this endlessly, and I feel none of my friends would object to partaking as well. Very, very good."
"O: This was the first time I've had Dead Guy, and I found it to be true to style as far as a hoppier version of a traditional bock, but I didn't get the malt presence that the style calls for. At least not in this pint. I almost thought I was drinking a pale ale which is alright by me."
"This is a very drinkable, very tasty brew from Rogue. I had this on tap before and remember it being a bit more deeper and complex in the flavors. Maybe that is just tap brew being tap brew though. This is still very good though."
"This is one hell of a drinkable brew. Very tasty and really sessionable."
"D - Very drinkable and sessionable beer from the nice IPA-like citrusy, fruity hoppiness, light bitterness and creamy smoothness. (4.5)"
"D: Easy drinking. Could have a couple of these all night with some friends."
"D: This is an easy drinking ale, something I could drink a lot of in one sitting. While there is nothing exceptional about this beer, nor do I think its a great example of the style, it's still very enjoyable."
"D: Very easy to drink. Even the wife who isn't to big into beer thought it was very nice."
"D: Better than I expected. I did not notice the 6.5 ABV til well into the second one. These go down easy and good for a few. This is well worth seeking out."
"Mild aroma of sweet caramel malts and a hint of bitterness. Moderate carbonation and a fairly light mouthfeel. Slightly hoppy flavor followed by more caramel, biscuit, and a return to hops on the finish. Very easy-drinking and one of my all-time favorites to sip when I don't want to think too hard about what's in my glass. Great balance of hops and malts."
"This is a fantastic beer, not much else I can really say, other than I could drink these all day."
"D - Easy drinker, used to be my favorite brew before I really started exploring all that's out there. Always be one that I happily go for when available."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer for drinking with friends and for an evening of conversation and good company. It's easy to have another sip and its easy to have a second beer. I'll probably be buying this one again."
"This is my first foray into the maibock style, and thus don't know if this is representative of the style. It is a fairly interesting combination of flavors, though. Fairly enjoyable."
"very good beer to start your adventure into tasting and collections. strong for an ale but finish smooth. have not tried other rogue beer yet. i would place this on my list to try again. In the same ballpark of IPAs and Porters. The IBU are in the mid range along with the alcohol percentage."
"D: Good beer and great style, but not the best. I come back to this brew but do enjoy other maibocks a bit more. Dead Guy does have a clean and drinkable tone to it. Nice and light, not thick and heavy on the way down, something I have found in other maibocks. Had to grab for a good price of 8.99 - - - typically see this one at 10/11/12 in the Midwest and Colo."
"Tasty enough, on the floral side of hoppy, just barely too strong to session, a good fall beer I would think. Would have again but I'm not crazy about it. That's more my preference in styles than the beer itself though."
"Pours a nice deep orange. Caramel malts and slight sweetness dominate. A really good combination. Creamy beer overall creates a very enjoyable mouthfeel. A little bit of hops balance it out on the finish, but the malts certainly make this beer. Nice drinkability."
"Overall, I get why people like it, but it is not my cup of tea."
"This one has an expected dark orange color and a small somewhat sticky looking head. The smell is faintly malty and like burnt candy, distinctive and pleasant, warming. It smells like it'd be sweet. Caramel is the dominant taste, with a mouthcoating, kind of velvety body that makes it quite easy-drinking. Full-flavored. The caramel is just short of being too strong (to the point of cloying) here. I can see this one as being very enjoyable to sip in cooler weather. It gives a fuzzy, cozy feel."
"D - Easy to drink, ordered another one after the first bottle and enjoyed it."
"D: At once challenging and also perfectly enjoyable. Its dryness and bitterness seemingly force you to take the beer slowly but this is perfectly offset but the smoothness and lightness that lets you purely enjoy it. Dead Guy is one of the best from Rogue."
"A solid session beer."
"I'm definately getting this one again!"
"D - Enjoyable and quaffable but the sweetness makes it difficult for more than a couple..."
"This has some peculiarities for the style, as far as I can tell, but I generally dismiss them. I can't get a straight answer from anybody if this is lagered like a traditional helles bock, or just an ale approximation. The taste is ambiguous there too, but I've tried to see if my palate would guide me. I'll leave it at they should keep doing what they're doing. If it's not a German Maibock, lets say it's an American Maibock. I'd like to see some brewers do as well in an approximation of styles like this. Bring on the American Maibocks."
"O. This is a good beer for folks that like real beer. The lack of clarity will frighten the cereal brew fans, but they would be missing a fine example of beer brewed the way it was intended; full flavored and hearty."
"Drinkability: It's got just a bit of tang, which I'm a sucker for. It's also got a clean aftertaste that keeps me coming back for more. Only downside may be that it's a bit strong/alcoholic."
"Beautifully crafted maibock, too sweet and malty for my taste but fits the style. Nice."
"Hared to get in UK, but will be making the effort to find more."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but the hop bitterness and crisp, yet understated carbonation serve to clean up any residual stickiness. I could drink a lot of these. A good session beer for those crazy high abv drinking yanks!"
" I gave it a fairly aggressive pour into a pilsner glass, and it didn't come up with too much head, maybe a finger or so. The first thing I noticed was it had very little visible carbonation, just a few tiny bubbles, and a gorgeous golden amber color. The smell is of malt, a slight touch of hops in the back, sweet bread and I catch almost a little carmel and brown sugar in there too. Some medium lacing on the way down. The mouth feel is real silky to me, not a whole lot of carbonation going on, so it lays easy on the tongue and with the smooth flavors, with just a slight hop bitterness at the end. It's real easy to drink, I could definitely see having a few of these in a sitting with friends, and feeling good at a 6.5 ABV with this drinkability. Good stuff."
"Overall: I love maibocks. This is a good beer. Would buy again, but not too often. I have had some better maibocks in various brewpubs, but this is still a great and enjoyable effort by Rogue."
"Pretty good beer though. I also recommend the John John if you can get your hands on it. Dead Guy Ale aged in barrels of whiskey that was distilled from Dead Guy wort. Yum."
"Interesting, but I'd never have considered it a Maibock if it had been a blind tasting. Too weak in the mouthfeel for me."
"The first time I had Dead Guy I wasn't that impressed, but this was a totally different experience. It smelled faintly of raisins and hops - pretty good. I tasted mostly dark fruits and lime. It was a little bit on the sweet side, but I felt it was appropriate. The balance is excellent, making this highly drinkable."
"Is Dead Guy an ale or is it a lager? I think that question is moot. This beer has all the qualities of a great maibock, so we'll just leave it that."
"D-Very drinkable. I'm going to celebrate my b-day with this beer. My friends and fam will love it too."
"D: The crispiness from earlier makes this quite an enjoyable beer to drink. Not overbearing at all and goes down very easily. Definitely would have another."
"Good beer. Gets a B from me. Reminds me of an english ale, malty but clean. Good nose, liked that I could buy it in a 24 oz. bottle, instead of a six-pack here in NJ. Will definitely buy a six next time. Nice balanced beer. Best Rogue beer I've had."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is pretty good."
"D: A very solid drinking maibock. Nothing too out of the ordinary to be called truly delicious. But, it's a great brew and the 6.5% ABV doesn't hand out a boozy effect in the taste or feel. Would like to try on-tap to note variations in mouthfeel. A little more crisp and this brew could be really dangerous."
"D: This beer is easy to drink and very sessionable."
"pours a cloudy copper color with large tan fluffy head, good lacing and lively carbonation. sweet malts carmel, molasses and hints of burnt nutty like flavors. light piney hop feel as well, maybe some hints of toffee. medium body, with an oily creamy texture that was slightly fizzy. moderately sweet with an average flavor duration that finished sweet and slightly bitter. all around fantastic beer. first rouge beer i've tried and was very impressed."
"No freshness date."
"D - Good refreshing beer. I would get this one again."
"Pretty good overall, worth trying for sure, it's like a more subtle sierra nevada pale ale combined with an american wheat like mothership wit. Less hop bittering, less wheat fruit notes are the product, but it retains a sweet malty body and enough hopping to keep you entertained."
"Very well balanced malty delight. Just enough hops to balance the toasted malts. Great Brew. The high price of Rogue is the only reason I would not regularly buy this brew."
"Overall, I could definitely place this within my spectrum of ""sessionable"" beers. Great, drinkable, and delicious."
"What is great about this beer is that it balances everything perfectly."
"Not too dense. Goes down smoothly with a medium amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Its an easy drinking and flavorful brew for sure. Probably not a bad choice for a session beer. I had heard a lot about this beer and while I don't find it to be amazing, its still not bad. I certainly wouldn't mind having it again."
"D- This is just a really easy to drink beer. It is smooth, refreshing and different, and at 6.5% ABV it is very easy to drink one bomber and even a second if it is there to drink."
"Enjoyed this beer in a s.a. glass. Distinctive aroma, great medium malty taste with a nice hop presence and finish, around 40-50 ibu's. As a home brewer I can identify The distinct Pac Man yeast. Feels real nice in the mouth. Color is nice. I will frequent his beer..."
"Pours a dark orange with ligh carbonation. Head fades very quickly into light lacing. Smell is difficult to pinpoint, but faily hoppy indeed. Drinkability is easy and the taste hits the spot. Easy beer to just sit with and hang out for awhile. Will be purchasing this one agian in the near future."
"Beautiful copper color with very nice head and lacing throughout. Tried my first maibock a little while back and am always on the look out for this beer style. This one is crisp but sweet, mild carbonation. Excellent. Will definitely seek this out again and again. Wish I got more than one bottle."
"Drinkability: Tasty, smooth, and refreshing. Overall a really good beer. Complex flavors that really balance themselves outwell. Very impressed."
"Pours a nice hazy dark amber color with a 1/2 finger head that stays for quite a while and leaves a good trail of lacing. The nose is sweet malt with a nice hop presence. The taste is very hoppy at first but follows with a heavy malt presence. Has a very nice balance between hops and malt. Very smooth mouthfeel and a nice drinkable beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts, finishing slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a pretty good brew."
"I can't help but compare Dead Guy to its bourbon barrel-aged version, John John Ale, which I tried awhile back but haven't gotten around to reviewing. Regular Dead Guy is more easy-going and run-of-the-mill than John John, but arguably just as tasty. This statement is not meant to denigrade John John, but only to praise Dead Guy. Because my logic says that if a beer can even hold a candle to a bourbon-infused version of itself, it has to be pretty good."
"Notes: I was not expecting the complexity of this beer. It doesn't every seem overly complex though. All the flavors and aromas work in perfect harmony without seeming like its trying too hard."
"I really enjoyed Rogue Dead Guy Ale. It pours a very dark orange color. There is some nice head which lingers and laces the glass. The smell is a bit sweet actually. The taste seems to be bitter at first, but then finishes sweeter than I anticipated. The initial bitterness may hinder the drinkability for some, but I highly recommend this beer."
"D--Very drinkable. I like this more and more as I get farther down the glass."
"Drinkability: A little on the bitter side, has some bite to it as well because of the amount of hoppyness. Overall it is refreshing but I don't think it'd be very enjoyable if it's consumed too quickly."
"Very easy to drink on a warmish spring night."
"Fairly simple flavor profile but the flavors mesh well, balance is present, and the beer is indeed drinkable. Overall well rounded with a pleasant aroma."
"Highly drinkable and very delicious. This is one i like to revisit."
"This is a good enough beer, but over-priced and over-hyped. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, and probably not something I will buy again when I can get similar beers for half the price."
"Ahh good old dead guy has been a fall back for me for many a year. Very malty and smooth as you would ecpect. Head sticks around for a little while with a nice toffee hue to it. The taste is bits of chocolate and caramel just a great sort of malty flavor. A solid beer could have one of these everyday."
"A tasty beer to be sure. It has a sameness that is common to the Rogue beers but it isn't detrimental. Tasty."
"Consumed from a tulipesque Aventinus man-glass."
"Smells strongly of 2-row pale base malt and buttery diacetyl. Good head retention. Tastes like the aroma, strong malty character from pale malt as well as a nice balance of butter from diacetyl, but does not overpower. dryer finish than expected, great hop balance. Suprisingly refreshing for the style."
"D- Totally drinkable. I'm drinking this on a warm night, and its just so soothing and tasty in the warm air. This could be a real nice go to spring beer."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. I essentially quaffed this down while waiting to be seated and not intentionally. I just looked down at the glass and realized most of it was gone before I could slow myself down. Not a bad beer at all and if there are no better choices in the future, I may have this instead of a SA BL of SN PA."
"M/D - Pretty smooth brew with a little bite at the end but very tasty for sure. One of my favorites from Rogue, well balanced brew that should be tried, this for sure will be bought again."
"D: Very tasty ale, quite refreshing and well-balanced. Definitely one I'd gladly have more of."
"I would definitely get this on again. Next I will try the double dead guy. One of my faves by Rogue is thier Brutal Bitter this dead guy ale is more dirnkable and smoother than the Brutal (which I like a lot)."
"D-this is a decent brew and has a good bit of balance. Good malt presence, nice hop backing. A little rough on the edges but still a decent."
"D good refreshing beer, would definetly purchase as a session beer"
"Overall, this is ok. Probably the rating suffers from being compared to other Rogue beers. Maybe this is too hoppy for the style. Just a tinge less hops would have been better balanced to me."
"Drinkability: It's not too complex, but it's tasty; it's a well-built beer. Very smooth. However, I was expecting nothing short of orgasm for a $10 sixer."
"Awesome beer, not the best I ever had but would defiantly buy again"
"I can easily see this beer becoming one of my ""go to"" beers."
"d - the unusual flavors in this brew make for an interesting drinking experience, but this is not a beer that i would consider sessionable."
"This brew makes for a great session beer, easy to quaff down quite a few if you aren't careful. Great price point too."
"overall, interesting beer which tastes like what they call it though perhaps a bit too toasted. ale fermentation adds some intesting flavors and the hops just didin't meld well for me. more interesting than anything, a bit of a kitchen sink beer in my mind."
"Copper with orange hues. Small head with light retention and lacing. Small nose of bread and toasted grains. Malt is balanced nicely with a moderate dose of floral hops that leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. To style? Nope. Tasty? Yes. Very fluid mouthfeel and low carbonation. Quite drinkable with a slight alcohol finish. Good beer that is widely available."
"This is my first beer review. After three bottles [all on different days :-)] I feel like I have a pretty good sense of this beer. It's a nice amber color with a thick, but short lived head. Like the flavor its smell is balanced with caramel malts and terrific citrus esters. The hops are stronger on the palate than sensed by the nose, but much more subdued than an American IPA, for instance. I find this the most drinkable beer I've had so far. Dead Guy Ale may bore those who prefer a heavily hopped beer. The style confuses me; I would have called this an amber ale. So much to learn..."
"Overall - I like this beer and would definitely recommend it to everyone as a beer to be tasted. The only thing I could for that this beer does not deliver on is a fair amount of sediment to swirl in, but I cannot mark off any points for that."
"Drinkability: This is an interesting beer, an ale brewed with the same ingredients as a maibock. Creating a similar flavor with some extra fruity esters. I think its a decent beer overall and a maker for a decent session ale. Its not all that complex, so its hard for me to get excited about though it is damn drinkable and there is very little wrong with this beer. I think this beer is hyped up a lot because it was one of the first accessible craft beers. A damn good beer... Worth the price, no."
"i love the way the finish reveals (before drying and fading) herbal notes, a hint of forest...it even reminds me of a british pale ale beefed up, but not in the american ipa sense. hops stay low. near perfection for what it is."
"This is my all time favorite beer. I am a big porter fan, and im in love with any dark beer and this is the best beer i think you can buy at a grocery store or any market like it. The beer drinks so smooth for how dark it is, and tastes of a hint of caramel within the full body. A true classic. One of my favorites anytime i go to the bar"
"D/M- very nice medium body beer with good malt profile and good drinkability. Nice"
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. The initial flavor is somewhat sweet, the bitter hops are strongest in the aftertaste, but not overpowering. A well balanced beer which I would buy again."
"A middle-of-the-road beer in terms of body. Good for anytime. and very drinkable for sure."
"D - May have this again if I find a sixer defiantly a good beer to buy."
"Definitely a solid brew. Not my favorite, but some nice flavors. Has a mild hop presence, mainly presenting earthy notes but with a hint of citrus as well. Strong malt presence, with a bit of toffee and some toasted malt flavors. Finishes with a touch of bitterness, but not as much as I would prefer. Medium bodied, with a nice level of carbonation. Good brew, but not my favorite style."
"This is a very smooth beer that's incredibly well balanced. Not my style of beer, but very well brewed nonetheless. Rogue has better offerings (like Double Dead Guy), but this is a very solid beer that's very drinkable. Is noteworthy."
"d- i'm gonna start off by saying that this is my first maibock so i'm not sure what the exact style is shooting for. it does have a nice hop profile, and is lighter in color, although i'm not getting any alcohol coming through. i really am enjoying it though, it's a nice refreshing lager spliced with some great ale characteristics. another top notch rogue offering, can't believe i'm only getting around to trying it for the first time now."
"(d) Decent, but not something I would go back to in a session. Great beer to build on, but for the price lets leave it at that. (3/5)"
"D -- Overall a very drinkable beer. I could easily drink the entire six pack in a sitting. One of my favorite beers from Rogue brewery(except double dead guy, which is even tastier)"
"One of the earlier available microbrews ten or so years ago, this was one that was surprisingly interesting since it was a german style lager rather than the typical ales that you found from most micros. Great color and aroma, very malt forward with a great flavor. Much better on tap than in bottles."
"Overall: An outstanding American beer I can be proud to drink anywhere."
"D- Overall pretty good. I'm glad that Rogue is so easy to find because you know your always getting a solid beer."
"D- Easy to throw a 6'er of these down, i'm glad Rogue bottles these in the 12oz bottles. They're starting to become a regular staple in my fridge."
"D: Very drinkable beer that I have, and will drink again."
"Pours a clear copper color with a moderate tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet and fruity with some hops and a bit of honey. Malty flavor that is nicely balanced with citrus and floral hops. Mouthfeel is just right.. medium bodied and quite smooth. This is very drinkable and a really good beer."
"D - Definitely a do over. I could throw down a few after dinner as a dessert and not be completely immobilized."
"Bottle, home. This beer is somewhere between tawny and mahogany in color. The head is off-white and leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is nice - sweet, subtle caramel malt with some light, fruity hops. The flavor is a tad sweet and finishes with a mildly sour lager/malt flavor, but it's well-balanced and goes down easy. The mouthfeel has always seemed a tad odd to me. I get a funny graininess at first. Dead Guy won't bowl you over with complexity, but it's a solid beer and it's easy to see why it has converted many a macro drinker."
"this beer is one that ranks up thier at the top of my list...one of my all time favorite beer,,i can arcoss the beer by sure happenstance...i was in the outer banks and was at a huge beer store and could not decide what to get,i saw the bottle out of the coner of my eye,,why not,,,once i got back to the room and opened it i was hooked right away,,it was one of the best,,,thats all i can say,,,,TRY IT"
"I've had this beer before but I fogot how good it is. This is a fine piece of work from Rogue and I'm already looking forward to my next."
"Overall, this is a solid well balanced beer, that you could easily drink several of in a sitting, great for a ball game."
"D: I could drink about two, maybe three of these before I would want to switch onto something else."
"Very malty aroma hit me as soon as I popped the top on this bad boy. An off white 2 finger head with big bubbles diminishes quickly leaving a perfect rind on the wall of the glass. The smell is like walking through the doors of a brewery. The wonderful malty smell hits you fallowed by a light hops. The body color is simply printed on the bottle ""Deep honey in color"" not any room to argue that one they're Dead on. Has a great full mouth feel, nice and chewy with tastes of wheat and honey... oh and don't forget a great balance of malts and hops. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"D: Very smooth beer, refreshing, and nothing is too overwhelming."
"NOTE - Mine may have been aged a year or more due to the fact that I bought it at a liquor store that doesn't move allot of it's craft beer quickly, and is known for stocking old beer to still make a profit."
"Definitely an improvement over my on-tap review. Looks like I did indeed have a bad pour and this beer is redeemed."
"Have had this on bottle and draft, hands down the draft is where its at."
"At $200 per keg - I probably won't be buying too many more kegs, but I will always buy the jug!"
"Drinkability: I thought this beer was quite good. It's not going to make my top ten or anything, but certainly worth taking note of."
"People can complain about Rogues prices all they want to but I know I never have to worry about not being able to get my hands on this and it is an incredible jumping off point to craft beers. As a matter of fact, I must say this should probably be THE beer for converting macro drinkers. Thanks a bunch Rogue!"
"M: Medium bodied, good carbonation. I agree with some other reviews, it does have a syrupy texture, but perhaps its the caramel flavor that gives that impression."
"Poured 650ml Bottle - Pours honey colored with small white head. Aroma is sweet fruity hops along with some hints of caramel. Flavor is bigtime fruity and flowery hops. It's bitter and hoppy but it does go down smooth. Well balanced and quite nice and I would drink it again."
"Overall, a descent brew. A lot of interesting flavors going on here. The only thing that turned me off was the cough syrup aftertaste. Worth a try, nonetheless."
"Very drinkable, goes down easily. I enjoyed this and will probably keep some on hand."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. This is a refreshing ale that goes down smooth and will not disappoint."
"D – Hell yeah, I'll drink this anytime."
"12 oz bottle served in shaker. The commercial description fits this one well. Aroma of caramel malts with floral and spicy hops. Bright honey colored with a thin off white head which dissipates quickly. Sweet and slightly bitter with a pleasing alcohol warmth. Nicely balanced. Medium body and gently carbonated. Highly recommended."
"D: I'm still a little confused as to this beer's style, and my attempt to place it is having an interesting effect on my reaction to the flavors. I'd like to try this one on tap and review it there as well."
"D. This beer is pretty drinkable. A little different from most of the beers that I have tries in this style but good none the less. Seems a little heavy too drink more than 2 or 3 in one session."
"D-I could slowly session this beer all night. Goes down very smooth. A wonderful offering but too overpriced indeed. I got this on a mixed sixer so is wasn't bad. I would never pay 11 dollars for this."
"Really good Maibock, unfortunately the style does not allow it to stand out too much from other beers. The hint of spruce at the end really defines this beer (and much of the others from rogue) and makes you remember it. If you didn't like it, try it again a second time with an open mind and i think you will find it more welcoming."
"A very drinkable, tasty and balanced beer."
"Pours golden haze with a nice frothy head. The head laces the glass, Smells citrusy with sweet malt. Initial taste is of sweet malt finished with herbal hops. Light mouth feel and highly drinkable. This is a solid offering by rogue. and is a go to brew when i am looking for refreshment."
"If you see this on tap somewhere (which isnt difficult to find) I assure you wont be dissappointed."
"i wasn't sure about it at first with all the sediment floating around in the bottle, this is shockingly delicious."
"D: A solid enough brew and I enjoyed it. The yeast character of Rogue beers have never been a favorite of mine, but the maltiness helps to push that towards afterthought."
"Nothing wrong with this ale. Another good beer from Rogue. There could be more flavor on the palate though."
"Libation: A very well put together ale, almost perfectly balanced for the style. Very interesting savory & spicy flavors are well balanced with a small hop character. Extremely (dangerously?) drinkable. Clearly one of the better offering in this style, I'll be back."
"The prototypical new world Maibock, despite the confusing name, and with verily big malts, nicely cut with soft, but effective balancing fruity hops. Very drinkable, at this particular bookend of my beer-drinking years."
"Overall: A good solid, drinkable, beer. This is my first Maibock and thus the ratings may change as I try more."
"It is not perhaps the most outstanding example of a maibock but it is very accessible and generally available."
"A nice orangey-copper-brown, this one has a half-inch white head on top of it. Head fades relatively quickly, but leaves behind some nice lacing. Something about the smell to me is off-putting, and I can't quite place it. In any case, I'm getting some lightly roasted malt, and a hint of citrus hops. Taste follows suit, but the malt definitely dominates, with roasted flavors and amber malts coming through. Some nutty flavors too--hazelnut for one. A hint of hops pushes through, though they are minor. Feel is nothing special, pretty typical for an ale, though I guess slightly above average for creaminess. Drinkability would be higher if I could figure out what I don't like about the smell of this beer, there's just something I don't like. I've had it in bottles and have noticed the same thing. In any case, this is a nice sessionable beer."
"This is my first Maibock so I really do not have anything to compare Dead Guy with. It is very drinkable and tasty, though not exceptional."
"Its not outstanding, but it is a solid beer."
"Malt bomby, but still with a little bit of hop character, but the malt wood tobacco feel overwhelms the hop character. As it continues, the dirt, earth, dark mahoganny feel to the bottle increases, and you're just about over this beer."
"D-very drinkable, the beer gives a good balance like a maibock should a nice spicyness and a good strong maly flavor while not being too heavy"
"D- Great beer to drink a few of. Hit the mark with beer. Mellow yet complex"
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a half inch head that leaves ample lacing. The appearance is light amber and cloudy. The aroma is of spicy hops and malt. The taste is moderately bitter with malt sweetness. The feel is medium bodied with a flat finish. This is a delicious and drinkable ale."
"D: This is a unique session brew that doesn't necessarily need to be poured into a glass; as far as I can tell there is nothing truly appealing about it's appearance, but the true testament of a good brew is it's taste and drinkability. This one has both."
"Light copper color, gold hilights, small white head leaves thin lacing. Some hop smell, a bit of citrus but not very strong. Malty taste, slightly sweet to start. Then you get a dose of floral and citrusy hops. Sweet aftertaste. Good carbonation level, medium bodied, easy to drink. Refreshing and easy to drink, a good sessional option."
"D: One of my favorite american beers, i would like to celebrate the next ""dia de muertos"" drinking this beer."
"Fantastic. Lots of flavour within while resisting the urge to become incredibly intense which would limit it to one or two. This beer is a great example of a session beer."
"Pours a light burnt orange color, reminiscent of a sunset on the horizon. Really beautiful when held up to the light, with a great stark white soapy looking head, that leaves a decent ring of lace on the glass. It has a nose of sweet malt, citrus hop, some bread and yeast character and hints of coriander, maybe even some wheat notes. As usual the sweet malt strikes first, followed by some citrus and bread that converge into a floral hop taste with a minor bitter finish. This is a nice and crisp beer with a light to medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Very well balanced beer, with a good malt backbone and a strong hoppy prescence. This is very visually appealing beer with a constant head and lace throughout that keeps it attractive till the end. The taste is equally appealing, with a great blend of sweet and floral flavors that keeps it complex, while it still something that can be drank in quantity, which is a hard balance thing to achieve in beer."
"Mouthfeel was very smooth, nice rich creamy body wasn't lacking a thing. Carbonation was spot on, not distracting from the smooth delivery. Great beer, and relatively easy to find."
"D - The taste makes me want more. Starts out a bit rough, but then grows on you. I wouldn't mind drinking 4 or more before going to something lighter."
"D - Excellent brew overall. Perfect for the style; refreshing and bold, an absolute delight with spicy food."
"The feel is good for this style of pretty and its pretty drinkable."
"this is a solid beer but not something that knocks your socks off."
"A fairly easy to drink beer, nothing exceptional but will probably have again."
"Now, is this still a maibock if you brew it with an ale yeast?"
"Drinkability- really good, definitely will drink more"
"Notes: strong, flavorful lager with malt and bitterness well balanced"
"Delicious beer, probably one of my favorites. Just the right amount of bitterness, and is very drinkable. Rogue continues to impress me with nearly all of their beers."
"Poured with a deep orangeish color with a very thin head. Nose is faint hops and malts and some citrus. Taste is a sweet, citrus-like taste which was sordove oversome with malt. Refreshing but a little more syrupy and bitter than the draft version. Almost two different brews from bottle to draft."
"D: does this come in 6 or 12 packs! great brew"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable beer which should appeal to a diverse crowd."
"It's like a cross between a bock and an american pale ale. Dry, hoppy and light, but still fairly well balanced. Has the stickiness of a bock with a bitter hop finish that makes me think pale ale. It's one of those beers I don't buy too often but when someone throws it in the cooler in the spring/summertime I'm all about it."
" Very complex and smoothe flavor."
"The ale pours brilliant honey-amber, with a two-finger off-white head. The nose has a nice balance of yeast and malt. Quite pleasant. The carbonation is well-developed and very pleasant with very small bubbles. The body is medium-light. Much lighter than I would expect of a bock, but then this is a Maibock, which is traditionally lighter. It is also rather dry and lightly hopped. The lacing is very light and sparse. Excellent with lighter foods or deep-fried foods. Quenching. I am not certain that if I was a monk and this was a meal-replacement ale, I would be totally satiated. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate, but shows itself after a few sips. The lingering is very pleasant and the malt shows very nicely accompanied by notes of honey."
"Matchbox/$6/Pint"
"Great fall weather brew, good with hearty meals."
"Overall impression: Solid all-around brew."
"Pretty good. Not spectacular though. Very drinkable."
"Very slightly cloudy red/amber. Pretty thin had that dissipated rather quickly. Had a sweet smell of toasty caramel. Really had no hops smell to speak of. Sweet malt taste with honey. I just didn't get any aura of hops. Carbonation and feel were quite nice, but the taste just seemed to be lacking. Didn't notice any alcohol...didn't really notice anything in particular. It was, as my score indicates, just average."
"D-- Good beer. Plain and simple. Easy to drink 2-3 of these. My favorite Rouge beer and always worth drinking."
"Mouthfeel is very rich and full. One swish around the mouth and the beer foams up into a rich, thick beer. Quite nice. There are nice parts of this beer, but as a whole it takes a bit of a knock from me mostly because I found there to be a bit of a clash in some of the beer characteristics going on. Good parts but didn't come across as a unified whole to me."
"D - Good, drinkable beer, thought that tea-like astringency does kind of build up."
"An awesome drinker. I've had this beer all the time and definitely one of my favorites. To me, its a one of a kind (well...OK...its the only maibock - helles bock.)"
"Poured an smallish white head into a standard pint glass. Rich amber in color, not as much clarity as I would have expected. Nice Lacing. Smells honeyed and grapefruity. Tastes of caramel with a citrus hop bite in the aftertaste. Smooth to drink, moderate carbonation, perhaps a bit watery. Drinkability is very good, moderately high ABV is very well hidden. Crisp and refreshing, a nice summer beer."
"D-As said earlier, can barely taste the 6.5% alcohol, so great drinkability. Happy medium between a sipper and something I could quaff down 5 of. Great beer, one of my favorite year-round brews."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - would definitely drink again - very good pale ale - more ""approachable"" than an ipa"
"D: This is the definition of 'quaffable'. I really enjoyed this beer... the fine balance and the addition of the fruitiness is very drinkable and nowhere near overpowering."
"I'd say that this is my first tasting of a Helles bock and I liked this version of the style, but I don't have alot to compare it to. The ABV is a bit high for me to make it a personal session beer. I think that you can get some Rogue beers here now too so that is nice-seems like they know what they are doing."
"D - Good. All in all, this is a very tasty, good maibock, despite technically being an ale. Another great Rogue beer!"
"Poured out of the 64 ounce growler. Color is a cloudy amber with a one finger head with some lacing. Nose is sweet with a berry tone. Flavor is somewhat sweet with a bitter edge on the tail. Mouth is smooth and a little bit heavy, with a slight bit of bubble that clings to your mouth. Extremely drinkable due to it's smooth tone and flavor. Excellent brew"
"Pours an orangish copperish color with a moderate frothy white head. The head gives way to a slight lacing. The aroma is of citrus hops with hints of fruit and a sweet malt characteristic. The taste is of a mild citrus hop bite, with a slight fruit note to balance out the harshness of the hop, there is also a slight sweet malt characteristic. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, there is a good hop characteristic without being overly hoppy. Overall the flavor is good and there is nothing to make you dislike this beer."
"A very fine beer indeed the one drawback being I couldn't see myself quaffing this in mass quantities. The almost overpowering malt would be a bit too much from my poor pallets sweet receptors after a while leaving my mouth feeling very dry. I would definitely have to be in the mood for a malt fix to have more than a few at a time."
"It's tightly carbonated with a strong, crisp finish. I wouldn't change a thing in this department, it's a needed kick that cuts through a thick texture. Well balanced and has a sticky body, a staining aftertaste. Still, I do feel it's missing something, an intangible to put it over the top."
"It's a bit pricey but close to worth the premium."
"Picked up a 6-pack of this at the Whole Foods in Nashville. A nice offering from our friends at Rogue. An exemplification of the style, IMHO. Pours a nice coppery orange, with a one finger head and a nice, long-lasting lace. Great, caramely malt backbone, some fruit, well balanced with appropriate hops. A good standby and a great session beer, with a relatively low ABV. Will definitely be drinking this again."
"Nice dark in color and small maybe half inch head. Very dry and quite bitter on my tongue. Was better after the first two drinks and went down rather smooth. I liked it more as I had it. Nothing really stood out though. A definite stand-by brew and one I can recommend."
"Solid classic in my book. An old standby in my days at the Other Side. Is there better? Likely. But that does not diminish a fine beer. A hazy reddish gold pour to copper-brown with thinnish white head, but lace that sticks about. The aroma advertises the floral-piney hops more than the nice roast malts that balance it. The flavor as said, is a great balance of malt & hop, with honey & pine qualities. The feel is a crisp, biting carbonation with dry finish that provides for a clean & drinkable sensation. A great old standby."
"Very drinkable for 6.5%. Were it not for the price tag, I'd be inclined to drink a few of these in a sitting, but I think there are cheaper options of comparable quality. Still, this is a solid beer that's very enjoyable to drink."
"D - I would definitely buy this again if I'm in the mood for a full flavored lager."
"Final Thoughts: Given the only Maibock I've had before was Holsten, I'm quite disappointed by this beer. I was expecting a lot more diversity out of this and frankly, if the hop presence wasn't so varied this beer would be abysmal. I'm guessing this beer is rated so high is because it probably made a lot of people realize that they are hop heads. That doesn't do it for me though, for me a beer needs balance which this beer is in need of."
"Tastes...well basically like it smells. Very drinkable...and the spices are noticable right away on the tounge...and last long after you finish. Once you have had Dead Guy Ale...I definately recomend getting Rogue's Double Dead Guy!"
"Overall- my natural reaction was to hate this beer for all its hype the company gets. this brew isn't to shabby. i've only had this one and a couple sips from their hazelnut brown nectar and both are good. i say pick this one up if you haven't tried it and if you're lookin for a good lager fill."
"D-This is one of the better Rogue beers I have had and would gladly drink again. Won't buy with any regularity since priced higher than other beers I like better. It was the best choice among bottled beers at a restaurant this summer, and will find similar use in my future."
"Pours a clear orange amber, with the slightest of haze. The flavour is pretty bland to be honest, a little sweet, not shitty, but nothing stands out either. The after taste is a little annoying in this beer. Don't notice the 6.6% at all, so its easy to drink. This just doesn't have any personality. Very average beer."
"Drinkability - had I not split this beer with someone else I definitely could have finished the whole thing myself. A nice balanced beer that is very refreshing and a good choice with a meal. I'll have to try it again and see if I think more of it."
"A pale hazy orange with a rocky white head and an adequate amount of lace. I found the aroma to be the weak link in this one, a bit underwhelming but not at least slightly better than average hoppy citrus aroma. The flavor leads with a balanced citrus hop attack that finds a nice medium between sweet orange and a drier grapefruit. This is followed by a sugar cookie maltiness in the middle that evolves into a slight sweetness before finishing with a dry hop note. I felt like the alcohol peeked its head out just slightly but I had to try hard to pick it up. Light and refreshing on the palate and representing a wide range of flavors. This one goes down easy and shows a nice complexity and though it's a little high on the ABV it might make a good session beer. Certainly one of the best I've had of it's kind."
"D - the smell and taste is great, especially the way it presents fruit and hop flavors. I could drink many of these on their own, but they would be even better with finger foods."
"Every Rogue product I have makes me love the company that much more. This was a very nice ale; rich in both smell and taste but goes down very easy. Can't wait to have their double dead guy for my 100th review."
"Also served at the Yard House in Waikiki, medium hazy amber in color with a thick head. Had a nice biscuity scent with a decent amount of hop spice, not very strong but pleasant. Toasted malt and barley, with some floral notes emerging as a resuly of the hops, becoming richer as it warmed up. Medium body with moderate carbonation, adding to the overall flavor at all stages, and went down extremely smooth for a beer of this complexity. Might be a little strong to be considered sessionable my many standards, but nonetheless equally enjoyable in both complexity and drinkability."
" I'm still relatively new to the craft beer universe, but this and Dogfish's 60 min IPA are my favorites! These are my gotos when I'm at the bar. Congrats to Rouge for another excellent beer!"
"D - Very sessionable beer at this ABV. A nice drinker all around."
"Should be called Dead Guy Lager, seeing as Maibock is actually a lager style beer. Oh well. It is an interesting American twist on a traditional German style that comes off quite well. A lot more hop aroma and flavour than a traditional Maibock, and a little more bitterness. A very good beer that I would be happy to drink again."
"even on dead guy's good nights, i don't want more than one or anxiously anticipate the next time i might pop one. yet it is enjoyable now and then."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Moderate ABV, strong flavor profile and a good balance of flavors. Could easily session this beer. A nice American example of the Maibock/Helles Bock style."
"Dead guy ale pours a dark orange amber color with a nice creamy head. Smells distinctly of fruit, spices, and cloves. You can definitely taste fruit and then cloves in the aftertaste. There is also something very sweet in the mix. Mouthfeel is great. Nice bite! Drinkability is like water. This stuff goes down nice and easy."
"D: Same as mouth."
"Overall, not the greatest beer in the world but its certainly well crafted. I'm glad that I chose to go back to this one. Its an interesting experience to drink this again because I thought I could remember exactly how it tasted back when I first had it and this tastes nothing at all alike. Its a fun exercise in looking at your palate! I dunno if I'll reach for this again but it does give me incentive to try and search out Double Dead Guy. Cheers."
"D: Tastes good, easy drinking beer with mild complexities."
"Drinkability is great. Very easy on the tastebuds. There's just enough hints of hoppiness here to keep it from being boring. Perfect segue for those that are wanting to get into craft beers."
"Overall im very glad i was turned to this drink, i will definitely seek it out again and give as gifts :)"
"had on tap at burger jones in uptown..it came in a pint glass and had a cloudy orange color to it with some nice sticky lacing..the smell was hops and pine and malt..it looked like an IPA..the taste was very good it was a great hop hit with some sweet malts it was very fresh and sweet tasting with a toasty malty earthy sweet taste ..the mouthfeel was sweet and creamy this is one great ale that i will have again soon... im very impressed with it ...quite tasty and recommended"
"I hadn't had Dead Guy Ale in a while, so I decided to be crazy and buy a six pack. I forgot how good this beer is. Pours a cloudy light orange color. Not a huge head, but plenty there. It's got a sweet and slightly spicy smell. Not a whole lot of hops in the nose, but plenty of malt It tastes really good. Definitely high on the malt and little more subdues with the hops. The taste starts off slightly sweet (caramel) but gives way to spice and bitterness. A lot happening there and it all comes together beautifully. Medium mouthfeel. Nice and clean. Very drinkable. I'm glad I decided to pick up this six pack. I don't remember liking this beer as much the last time I had it."
"Drinkability: a very tasty, eminently drinkable beer."
"This is a very drinkable brew; true to class, exceptional."
"D: THis is Very drinkable....only drawback I see is the hi price. I dont think it's as good as the price reflects."
"D - Could drink this one all day! If I had another one, I would certainly drink it. It's great balance is what sets it apart, not too hoppy or malty, but very much both."
"Didn't know what to expect with this one but it was a nice surprise. Looked great, hazy orange with a soft head. The nose is a little out there (in a good way). That mish-mash of hops and malt is pretty distinctive. A touch of stone fruits in there with the soft buttery malt. On the palate it's loads of fun with all that coming together nicely with a nice bitter kick at the finish. A good smooth ale that I'd be happy to come back to if I could pay the same price as the Americans for it."
"D - Very drinkable beer. My first Rogue beer and it's a damn good start for me I'd say. This is a beer you could definitely come back to time and time again."
"D-Easy to drink, I could definately see myself drinking a few of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Damn good. One of my favorites and something I will come back to time and time again. Try this beer as soon as you can."
"This beer is very drinkable. With foood, as a thirst quencher, as a substitute for a meal, this beer will do it. The flavor is interesting enough not to get boring."
"Blipped ""Stone Dead Forever"" by Motorhead"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, mostly because it is very balanced. Not too bitter not too sweet somewhere near the middle. I recommend at least one try of this beer. It's a beer I could definitely session with, goes nice with an Italian dressing covered sub. Cheers."
"Overall: First brew from the guys at rogue and I must say its definitely a win, it's got just enough of everything to make it complex with a purpose."
"D: Super easy to drink and quite pleasurable. A great beer for any occasion."
"Overall, a good, balanced, sessionable beer."
"D: Easy to drink, but a little too much to be a session beer IMO."
"D - Not bad at all. One of Rogue's better offerings, IMO. Could session with it, easily. Will buy again."
""
"D: It's a special beer for sure but I'm not sure I will drink this one again. The huge amount of honey (or syrup?) makes it very sweet."
"It was a treat to have this beer on tap. I've always enjoyed it bottled."
"This is the first beer I've given a 5 for drinkability and the best helles I've had."
"This is a very drinkable beer."
"D - Could suck a few down."
"D: Very drinkable. Balanced brew with enough of everything to please almost any drinker."
"d. only having a 22oz., something for the cooler months, will reconsider when frost hits"
" I could have this beer frequently and not be wanting for more."
"Very drinkable in all"
"Drinkability - This isn't for a novice beer drinker who constantly drinks ""lager"". I enjoyed this beer, though not all of the time. Im glad I tried it."
"D- Finished a pint of this beer pretty quickly and was ready for another. I don't think many people are going to struggle with drinking a couple of these."
"D- easy to finish but the price is too high to revisit this one on a regular basis."
"The taste is a slightly sweet, toasty bread, very slightly bitter combination that is very pleasant. The amount of carbonation is nearly perfect and complements the taste giving the overall mouthfeel that I like in a beer. I find this beer very drinkable and I only wish it was more available in my area."
"An easy to drink, sessionable beer. While the flavor isn't the most complex, I thought there was a decent balance of sweet and bitter."
"d- great price/ tons of flavor. the bitterness and heavy feel are keeping this from a perfect 5. i would buy this again, this might be a great beer to convert macro drinkers."
"Very drinkable, and all that, but its got a bit of a cloying sweetness that stays with you. Not a bad beer by any means but I'd go for something else that Rogue brews personally."
"D - Nothign too complex, lighter and refreshing. 6.5% is probably on the border of session drinkable."
"This is very drinkable as it is a balanced beer."
"Verdict: Dead Guy is a tasty and very drinkable beer with lots of character, but falls short of being exceptional. A worthy flagship brew for one of the bigger American microbreweries."
"D: Definitely an easy beer to drink. One of my personal favorites to drink, too."
"Served in an imperial pint glass, the beer was an amber color with a small white head. Malt upfront in the aroma, sweet, a little caramel. Big malt taste, little bit of caramel. Alcohol I thought was a little noticeable. Medium-bodied, very good beer."
"Poured 12oz. out of bottle into Rogue pint glass. Amber in color, I didn't remember what it smelled like, but the one I poured had almost no aroma at all. Smooth mouthfeel, moderately hopped, a great example of the style. Easy to drink. Still love this beer."
"D - Overall, a solid beer. To me, this is much more balanced and drinkable than traditional bocks that focus more heavily on malt depth, which results in a really sweet, syrupy brew. I'd drink this again."
"I now realize what this beer reminds me of, Magic Hat #9, this has a little more zing to it."
"It is still a good beer, just not as spectacular as i remember."
"Cheers!"
"A very drinkable ale and most enjoyable. A really clean and lovely beer to start the day."
"Light bodied and smooth, with light carbonation. Immensely drinkable. On the whole I'm having a difficult time finding a lot to say about this beer, but the fact that I can't seem to come up with anything particularly negative seems to say a lot. It's not special, but there are no serious flaws that I can find."
"Mouthfeel nicely full and rich, almost chewy towards the end. A little bit intense on the mid overall, but that's otherwise a very pleasant beer."
"Good drinkability, still have that curious tingle on my tongue, but probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Drinkability is ok - but this is probably not something I would seek out."
"Drinkability- Very Good."
"Finally a rogue beer that isn't an overhopped nightmare! I can see me getting more of these."
"Pours a hazy golden-orange with a bubbly white film on top. A beautiful silky lace permeates the glass with each sip. The smell consists of flowery hops, light malts, and alcohol. Sweet and yeasty aromas become apparent. Taste is fruity and zesty hops balanced with a dryly malted aftertaste. There's a peppery hop spiciness that nicely compliments the malty flavours and floral aromas. Lots of bite! The mouthfeel is crisp and velvety upfront; perfectly bitter and dry in the finish. Well balanced. Another fine ale from Rogue, with more of a malt profile than most of their beers. The tangy flavours would pair well with spicy food or creamy dishes like clam chowder."
"D- Good beer, lives up to the rogue standards, one of the better ales I've had"
"D=good beer, definitely drinkable, overall I enjoyed the beer."
"Both complex and easy-drinking; a fine ale for those seeking an alternative to the hop-bomb."
"Second bottle, during a second tasting session, the alcohol is less present."
"my favorite thing about this beer is it's the exact same color as my hair and beard.. Other than that it's sort of a typical light bock.. Has a clean finish. a bit buttery and has a caramel presence, a bit bready, pale malt, a bit of hop is in there. A bit filling but it is a bock so that's to be expected. Not much aroma from the glass. Mouh is full-bodied. Good, not great I wouldn't buy it on my own but I'll drink it above other stuff"
"This is a very nice brew, and one I've wanted to try for a long time. It was worth the wait."
"D: I could drink this beer all day long it has a good taste and is very easy going down i would but this agian for sure."
"But the Dead Guy is the one. I think that it is the best beer to give to you up and coming beer buddies to educate them on a bock style beer... I have many friends that are growing into the craft beer scene and I think that this is (after you get them into pales....and ambers) the best way to get people to the next level"
"From the bottle pours a really nice clear orange color with a nice big white head. Head has pretty good retention and leaves some good lacing down the glass. The smell reminds me of an IPA, hoppy, kind of sweet as well. Not much else to the smell. Taste is kind of hoppy, some caramel taste come through as well. It's pretty sweet as well, not to much bitterness. Definitely a great taste. This is one I've been a fan of since the first time I had it when I was first getting into drinking beer and I still love it and pick it up quite often today. A great offering from Rogue and one everyone should try."
"overall a decent brew, not as good as other rogue offerings though."
"D - Goes down nicely. Could easily finish off a few."
"Love the bottle and the name, but not one of my favorites from Rogue."
"D = This one I could definitely drink more than a few of in a session. I would love to have it with a more delicate cut of steak such as New York strip or tenderloin. Au poivre sauce would make an excellent spicy combination with the mild flavor of this brew."
"Overall, a good beer, there are better examples of this style but it's not bad. Not necessarily my style, but it is enjoyable except for the fact that it leaves me wanting a more complex hop profile."
"D: Heavier than other Maibocks I've had, but not at all cumbrous."
"I've been looking forward to this one for quite a while and happened upon a 6 pack. Good beer, my second from Rogue."
"From the bottle of a barrel-perched skeleton pours this PNW Maibock. Based on the pour it looks medium bodied. The honey amber hue is slightly translucent with microbubbles of co2 effervescing from the bottom. Ivory head holds up fairly well before lacing the walls. Taste is of clean, sweet cereal grains, kinda like golden grahams. Malt is sturdy. I get a sense of perfume and citrus from the hops, not necessarily on the tastebuds, but swirling around the sides and roof of my mouth. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet finish. A very civil interaction between malt and hop with the grain taking the top billing. Good brew."
"Hats of to Rogue for a really enjoyable brew."
"Good brew - I've had both tapped and bottled - love the tap, don't like the bottle. Good luck!"
"D: This beer is perfectly balanced in my opinion. Rogue has definitely hit the nail on the head with this one. Very drinkable!"
"Overall, a very good brew that is sessionable. Good malt flavor and nice balance."
"Pours a transparent rustic orange-brown. Thin head, little retention or lacing. Looks to be short on carbonation. Smells almost like a thin brown, sweet malt with a slightly bitter nuttiness behind it. Taste is similar, tastes like a clean lager, but with a bit of a nuttiness. Slightly bitter finish. A bit of pizazz flourish at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit low and watery, could use more carbonation I think. Tastes kind of flat. Decently drinkable. Overall, nothing spectacular. Kind of expensive for a session beer."
"Dangerously drinkable at this ABV."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and very drinkable. Paired extremely well with some spicy pepperjack cheese and water crackers."
"Very drinkable. I could easily pound this back all night; actually I would love to pound this back all night. I will definitely buy this again. I'm three for three for Rogue. This is a great brewery."
"D- Pretty drinkable I'd say, goes down smooth and not too high of an ABV to be a deterrent from drinking another."
"Notes: It is remarkable how much my smell/taste has changed in the past 18 months as I think about this beer and strain to recall what it tasted/smelled like then. Anyway, this is a nice, drinkable beer from Rogue."
"D - Absolutely. You could session with this beer. This is a delicious beer that is easy to find, and even easier to drink."
"D- Highly drinkable beer."
"Overall: I'd buy it again but far from one of my favorites."
"good beer, but i dont see what the big deal is about this beer. nothing would have me crawling back to it, just a good refresher along side your meal."
"Drinkability is the strong point of this beer. Hot day today, I'm already wishing I had another of this delicious and wonderful brew. Will definitely get again."
"highly drinkable and very balanced. spicy hops and malty as well."
"Overall, a very nice beer."
"it pours up a clear golden amber color with a nice white head. decent lacing. the nose is floral hops and pale malts. the taste is sweet pale malts and floral hops, medium bodied, medium carbo, very smooth and tastey. Fryin Brian didn't dig this one though. Claims its too boozy. Low alky brews? Im brewin ideas..."
"Notes: This is a well put together beer, and it is what I have come to expect from a Rogue product. But this style is not for me, but it is still a quality beer."
"drinkability/overall- pretty smooth, definitely a good beer."
"Drinkability is.... Everywhere. I could drink this beer all day. An excellent warm weather beer. Not a session beer... a little too much ABV here for that, but an great brew nonetheless. A must try."
"*side note: what's w/ the name, i though a maibock was a lager not an ale??wtf>!"
"suprised when I saw rogue at a mediocre distributer in philadelphia. poured into bottle, honey/amber color, thin off-white head. smells caramel -strong but not overwhelming- malty taste, smooth and refreshing. on my second now, don't think i'll go for three but definately will drink again. one of my favorites (along w/the double dead guy) from rogue"
"D: Very tasty beer, enjoyed it very much. The flavors from the malt are extraordinary, and the hops add a great balance of bitterness. Solid beer, would drink again."
"Poured an amber honey color with a thick white head that died down pretty quick. Sweet toasted malt and flowery hop aromas. A big malt flavor, sweet and toasted, followed by some grassy hop flavor and a little bitterness in the finish. I also could detect a little alcohol every other sip. Good mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Pours light amber with some gold colour, white head, and nose is very faint & disappointing. Palate offers the traditional maibock malt forwardness, but it is somewhat fruity sweet and lacks the alcohol warmth that is a regular component of the maibock experience. Very drinkable."
"This was a surprise beer. I bought a six pack of what I thought was Mocha Porter and poured. It obviously wasn't a porter, bonus beer. Anyhow I poured into a Cleveland Browns bud light nonic to a half inch a white head. It is copper in color and smells spicy and bready. The taste was spicy at first but became sweet. The hops were appearant on the back end. I have not had this beer in a while but it was not bad considering I was expecting a porter. I guess I should have looked at the bottle instead of bullshitting. Oh well, a pleasant bonus."
"Overall: I would say it is a unique brew. I like it but for 12 bucks I will get something else. One thing is it is quite potent so take it easy if you dare to be a dead guy."
"Drinkability: Meh. It's not the best tasting beer that I've ever had but it's not awful in terms of driniability. I'm sure I could drink several of these and the price is moderate."
"After drinking this beer, Miller Lite tastes like a Guinness. This is by far one of the worst tasting beers that I have had. It is almost like someone took a barrel full of hops and mixed it with a glass of sugar water. This beer is one of the most distastful things that you could do with water, sugar, and hops. Please stop supporting their efforts in wasting our fresh water supply."
"D- Definitely a sipper for me. I can drink one or two in a sitting, but that is the max. I will definitely drink again."
"Drinakbility: I have worked my way through a six pack over the course of a couple weeks and overall I have not really come to love this beer. It seems way too expensive for the quality of beer. For some reason it is also a sipper, which is a surprise at its 6.5% alcohol."
"D- Very drinkable due to the 6.5% abv, ample carbonation, and crisp ever-so-slightly bitter finish"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer. I'm not sure I'd want to session it, but maybe I was expecting it to deliver something that it didn't. I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't reach for it first either."
"Overall this would probably appeal to some people, but wasn't my cup of tea."
"This is a great beer that doesn't try too hard. No huge dominant flavors, but everything is done well."
"This is a good beer, not daring, nothing really stands out other than it is made well. Good beer, but nothing really stands out. What makes it good an appealing to many also keeps it just a good beer, nothing wrong with a good beer though."
"D- An ok brew that wasn't what I was expecting, but pretty good none the less."
"Notes: I've had Rogue Dead Guy numerous times before this review, but as the month of April begins to close I thought what better a time to review a Maibock than a beautiful spring day? This is one wonderfully light, crisp, and refreshing beer, and it suits the warmer months well. Rogue Dead Guy is a finely crafted brew, and while it won't knock your socks off with intense flavor (which it isn't supposed to do - sometimes it's nice to have something light) it will definitely make you appreciate the craftsmanship of the Rogue brewers and the gentle pleasantness of this beer."
"This is a nice beer to have if you are not a Hop Head, but want to know what all the fuss is about. It gives you a malty sweetness to balance a bitterness you may not be used to."
"Pours a hazy, murky deep orange/red honey color. Aroma of sweet malts/caramel. Moderate head mostly diminishing with nice lacing throughout. Definite yeast presence. Roasted straw and light molasses. Slightly sweet taste and light bitter finish, lasting a good measure. Medium-bodied and well balanced beer. Definite malty, caramel flavor. Not very hoppy to me, even in finish. Good malted beer - Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is a little strong, but is quite evenly manageable. Has a nice drinkable feel as well."
"Overall - I'll be adding more to the collection..."
"D - Very drinkable. You can kick these around all day."
"The best thing about this beer is the marketing for it. The name sucks you in. As for the beer, the appearance is a caramel brown. It smells strong of malt. I tasted it out of the bottle and was bitter so I poured it into an Ayinger glass and it relieved much of the bitterness. If you like very malty tasting beer this is probably right up you alley."
"Drinkability: Not the most complex for the style, but a delicious brew. I could have a six and be very happy. I will search for this again."
"Get this on tap if you can. The bottle does not do it justice. I will bypass all other beers if I see this."
"D - The Dead Guy could be put on a pedistal for other session beers to look up to."
"Had at Marathon Grill in Philly. Poured an amber brown with thin white head with almost no retention. Smelled malty and sweet with some hop notes and also vague hints of molasses and lemon. Taste was fairly light, much lighter than I expected, watery like seltzer at first then moved onto that molasses/lemon taste probably form the yeast (I once used a particular yeast in some homebrew that gave a similar taste). Sweet at first then sharp with a faint hoppy finish. Very wet feel. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just nothing too special."
"T: The perfect contrast of bitter hops drifting along a blanket of smoothness. Sugary sweetness flirts on the tip and edges of the tongue. Strong, in your face flavor. The sweetness radiates a fruitiness throughout the beginning and mid until it slowly warms into caramel, which dissipates leaving just that lingering, back-of-the-mouth hoppy bitterness."
"D - Strangely, something about this beer makes it difficult to drink more than one of. Lots of sweetness and bitterness make this brew rather rich. Certainly an improvement on-tap however."
"It tastes bitter and tangy. The is a nice caramel influence, some iced tea, a little bit of floral notes from the hops. The hops become more assertive as it warms. Half way through, there is a definite floral/earthy taste. Yummy. This beer is relatively subdued, yet delicious with a chewy, velvety mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. I could drink a few of these in one sitting. Very drinkable."
"M/D - Mouthfeel and drinkability were great. Very creamy and smooth. i could go for a few of these."
"Another good product of Rogue. Next in line: Double dead Guy Ale..."
"Drinkability - I think this is a brew with quaffability. Maibocks are pretty decent session brews in my opinion, and this one is certainly no exception. I could see drinking a few of these at a grill-out on a summer weekend. Highly recommended!"
"All around, not a bad brew."
"D - I could take a few of these down."
"D - Flavorful and full bodied with a nice malty character. Reasonably drinkable, but the heavy malt gets old after a couple of pints."
"Have had this a couple times and each time I have it I feel like the drinkability goes down. Pours a lighter amber/dark orange color with a fairly small white head. It smells sweet and malty. It is pretty smooth and tastes of malts. Also a little bit of sweet bitterness. There is something weird in the taste that I seem to dislike more every time I have this. It is not bad at all, just changing my original reaction. It is drinkable, but I couldn't drink a lot of this in a night. Still, a very good beer. A lot of people praise this highly."
"Drinkability: Definitely a good beer and an easy drinker. Not as complex or hoppy as I usually like, but a good solid beer."
"Sorry if the review is too gushy, but I'm reviewing as I'm tasting. Hey, don't judge- it's a fun way to procrastinate studying..."
"Good beer, it was the special that night so I decided to give it a try and I don't regret it. Probably reach for this again sometime."
"Dead Guy is the first Rogue beer I ever drank and it still one of my standbys. Red in color, 1 finger off white head, some lacing, smells of spicy hops, tastes fairly hoppy but not like a IPA, Thin to medium bodied fairly drinkable little too strong for a session beer but I have drank my fair share in a sitting."
"Note: This beer definitely benefits from the proper glassware. I enjoy Dead Guy much more from the pilsner over a standard pint."
"An excellently balanced beer that I've had my share of, and will return to again and again. A great session beer."
"OVERALL: Very enjoyable. A drinkable brew that's tasty and interesting. The ABV is a little high to be a session beer, but this is definitely one I could have a few of. Recommended."
"Overall a great, flavorful, balanced and drinkable beer that isn't too filling. I loved it."
"D - Very drinkable."
"Drinkability ranks high.. you could easily session this."
"Overall a very sessionable beer that i would buy a sixer of to bring to a party or maybe even a case. Great brew..."
"Went down well I'd certainly have another."
"Medium body with a light to medium carbonation level. I could see drinking maybe 2 of these in a sitting but I didn't feel like I would want to drink this all night long. For some reason, I've never been blown away by Dead Guy like some people are but this is still pretty solid stuff. For my tastes, this isn't one of my favorites to drink by itself but it does seem to pair well with some spicy foods, so there's definitely certain occasions where this would be more drinkable for me."
"Poured a medium amber body with great lacing and a pure cloudy unfiltered appearance. On the nose it is tremendously pleasing with a great deal of malts and roasted grains with a sweet honey fruit scent backed by a serious balance of sweet and savory. The taste delivered what the smell promised. Very balanced with a great deal of malt and a sweet earthy molasses fruit. Well balanced through the finish even with the alcohol present on the palate with pleasant carbonation and a medium to full body. A great early spring (when it is still chilly out) or fall beer. Rogue continues to deliver..."
"I'm not huge into Rogue but they always seem to deliver the goods."
"Makes me want to try others from this style and I will drink this again."
"D, notes: A fine tasting lager that is surely a good crossover beer."
"It is not too heavy so it can be drinkin often and it goes really well with pizza!"
"Unfortunately, my scores might be a bit low because I'm ""hedging my bets"" to allow myself some wiggle room on future beer reviews. I can't just give this thing an easy ""A" having only one other review under my BA belt, though I'd really like to."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I think this is a fantastic beer. It has a nice flavor and aroma profile that is complex enough yet not too over the top given the light, playful nature of the body. It definitely has more character than your traditional English styles, but is reminiscent of that same vain of easy drinking subtlety flavored beers. I think it would pair fantastically with typical pub grub like fish and chips or mutton stew. Or, it would pair fantastically with a six pack of it's buddies on a hot summer dark or while raking leaves in the fall."
"Enjoyed on-tap in a 16oz serving at the Mellow Mushroom in Winter Park, FL. Pours a dark copper color with a very thin off-white head that quickly disappears. The aroma is definitely on the malty side with hints of caramel and very little hops. The taste is very similar to the aroma with some toasted malts and caramel with a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, Dead Guy is a solid beer but I was ready to move on to something else after my first pint. Worth a try."
"Unremarkable overall. One I would drink again if I come across it, but I'm not going out of my way."
"I've had this in bottles and it never tasted this sweet. Very drinkable beer. I'll def revisit."
"D- A few pints for sure but not an all nighter as i would tire of it. Overall, this is quite drinkable. Not sure of the maibock style so all and all this is worth a shot."
"D-The sweet flavor may catch up to me after a couple but for the one i had it was quite enjoyable"
"22oz down I could go back for more - that is drinkability."
"D: This is my first Rogue in 5 years (I just returned back to Canada from Japan, where Rogue isn't available) and it did not disappoint. I'd like to keep a few of these in my fridge at all times as a stand-by beer."
"d: First one I've had in years. Pretty good, but nothing really special."
"D 4.5 - I would drink this as a session maibock any day, great taste, balance and a sneaky 6.5% ABV!"
"Drinkability: Medium body and good taste should set the stage for great drinkability, but I am concerned that the sweetness that I enjoyed will catch up after a few. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt since I only have a single."
"D: Very easy to drink, even though some may consider this a ""strong"" beer."
"Drinkability: Oh hell yeah! This is sooo complex, tasty, and smooth. Zach and I wish we had a second growler. The one knock on this is it might be a bit too full in body."
"A brilliant beer, quite simply one of the best I have ever had. Can't pick a beer that is similar, as proper Maibocks are fairly different in character. Had to pay a massive AUD$18 for it, but it wasn't money wasted."
"This was the final beer of the evening for me at Port Royal Lounge, and it was a good beer to finish off the evening. Pours a clear yellow color with some sediment at the bottom. The smell is a bit weak, but I could pick out some malts and a bit of citrus. The hops really came out in the taste, as it was bitter first and malty second. There was a citrus taste that lasted throughout the taste, but it seemed to linger in the background. It had decent thickness and carbonation, but nothing to rave about. Overall, it's a good beer to have in a bar, but it's not a great beer. It's decently drinkable, but the flavor is just a bit too strong."
"Overall a very drinkable beer that I enjoyed a lot. My first Rogue beer, and it's good. So far, this is one of my favorite beers; I'll definitely purchase again."
"Very drinkable. A very nice ale."
"Overall, very easy to drink. It isn't something I particularly would go out of my way to buy."
"overall-- I've had this beer probably hundreds of times now on both on tap and off. its certainly one of my all time favorite beers...this is the first Rogue I had that got me addicted to their brewery. you MUST have this beer if you haven't yet-- especially if you like malty beers (like I do)."
"This is a nice beer to keep around if I get in a sweet mood. A six pack would last a while because I think one or two beers of this at a time would be enough for me."
"Poured into my pint glass at home. Pours a kind of dark, clear amber with a nice foamy head that lingers to film, nice lacing around the glass as I'm drinking it. Aroma is sugary spring sweetness. Taste has a nice balance of malt, sweetness, and nice bitterness, yum. Medium light mouthfeel typical of what you'd expect. Definitely a nice beer to session, in my opinion, highly drinkable and smooth tasting."
"D: all in all this is a very tasty beer, but i don't think i could drink much of this one"
"I poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a tulip glass. It pours a clear amber with a pretty white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is sweet and bready. The flavor is sweet, minimal hoppy bitterness. The finish is crisp. A light to medium bodied quaffer. An enjoyable brew."
"Taste malty and strong, smooth and creamy, I could drink this all day."
"While not the first run-in I've had with this beer, this tasting went very well. Not really my style, so I probably wouldn't buy it too often, but it's a damn good brew and a sure pick for a nice spring day."
"I would recommend this to anybody looking for a solid micro-brew."
"Poured from a bottle, small head that quickly dies to a very small lacing. Cloudy straw color. Smell is less malt and more hop then I expected. Taste is great, very sweet, but very balanced. I now see why this is so popular, will definitely buy again!"
"Rogue Dead Guy Ale is a very good example of a non-traditional Maibock. The taste is a little too complex to be a session beer, but I will not hesitate to order one again on our next dinner excursion."
"D: All systems a go! Recommended."
"D: Tasty and well crafted, evenly balanced, nothing really holding this beer back."
"To me, this beer is an in-betweener. For an American Pale Ale, it is too heavy on the malt, and no where near crisp enough. But for a bock beer, even a light bock beer, the yeast profile is far to prominent for the style, the mouthfeel is distractingly light, and the hops are surprisingly intrusive. I understand that this was deliberate, but personally, I would prefer a good ale or a good bock to this beer, which tries to be both, but fails to be either."
"d - definetely happy that I got a sixer of these as opposed to a single. great beer from a nice brewery."
"Pours a clear amber with a small off-white head that breaks down to a soapy film. Faint smells of sweet malts are faint and not very interesting. The taste is the selling point: a very complex blend of carmell and toffee sweetness balanced perfectly by a burnt bread bitterness and piney hops. Alcohol slightly detectable but this beer still shouts ""quality!"" once you get it in your mouth. A really superb flavor. Nice medium body. One that I will definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Could and have drank all night long. A nice beer to serve to friends that have been living the macro brew life and haven't ventured into the quality of craft brews."
"Over all a good beer."
"D - Very drinkable beer, especially if one is trying to escape macro hell and find some quaffable craft brews. Quite filling considering the mouthfeel. I wouldn't turn this one down, but I don't think I could make it through more than one or two either."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. One inch head with good lacing and good retention. Smells of sweet malt, some fruit/spices, and some earthy aromas (something like butter or caramel). Fits the style. There's a smooth and crisp mouth feel with average carbonation levels. Tastes of sweet/ earthy malt and a good amount of hops to create a good blend of sweet and bitter. There's also another more subtle flavor maybe butter or caramel. Overall, a really good beer - another great example from Rogue."
"Poured from a factory sealed growler into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. I don't know how old the growler is but it let out a nice hiss of carbonation when I uncapped it. This beer pours a dark, reddish copper with a nice 2 inch head that dissolved into just a thin layer that sat on the top of the beer. The aroma has a nice caramel/toffee aroma with a bit of vanilla, and some fruity esters. The flavor follows suit with some mild malts really building the flavor profile. Caramel, what reminds me of blueberries sometimes and cherries other times (no I'm not crazy) and other dark fruits. There is also a fake sweetness to it. It kind of reminds me of Sweet N Low. The mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth. Not as clean as you find with other Maibocks. This is a good beer and one I'm sure I will revisit again down the line."
"D - Highly drinkable in its own right - not sure in comparison with style because I don't understrand Mai Bock designation. This will not join the ranks of my favorite, but all-in-all a descent beer for sure. It will stay on my radar."
"D_Kind of surprised I have never reviewed this one as I get it frequently. A well made flagship beer."
"Overall it's very drinkable."
"poured into a pint glass.Poured amber with a frothy white heading. Great lacing.Very fruity smell and a good blend of hops. I got a taste of oranges immediately and a very hoppy aftertaste. An easy enjoyable ale. I will definetly by purchasing this again."
"Diverse flavor offerings and interestingly balanced body make this a keeper. Always a go to."
"D- Excellent. A well balanced brew that I could definitely drink a few of."
"¡Salud!"
"Drinkability: Fairly balanced...sweet up front with bittering hops in the end. Easy to get through a few of these."
"The only thing dead here is the guy on the label."
"This would make a great session beer, and was a solid introduction into the style. I think it would make an excellent introduction for people who are just getting into craft beers, as well. I would say it's a little too sweet for my tastes, but its so easy drinking that it really doesn't matter. Solid beer."
"D - I love the hops in this because I'm an IPA fan...this is just another reason why Rogue is a great brewery!"
"Nice amber color with a small off white head. smells and tastes like caramel and hops. There's a decent amount of carbonation that keeps the drink consistent and very drinkable. Another great Rogue beer that was even better for the price I paid."
"taste is smooth, with some shy malt flavours, with a touch of hoppiness, fruity esters, banana, with a spciness present. A yeasty touch is also present which bring some banana flavours and sweetness."
"Like the numbers suggest this is a good beer. I have not had it for years. I had it 3 years ago and didn't care for it. I received it as a Christmas present this year and I like it alot. It is gold to amber in color with a sturdy big head. When the head falls into the glass it leaves ample lace around the glass. It smells nutty, sweet, and grainy. Very pleasant aromas. The taste has caramel sweetness and some clean spicy hop flavor. It is medium bodied with very good drinkability. I see this beer as a good match with simple but good foods. This beer should be found on Thanksgiving tables. Not too overpowering but plenty of flavor."
"mouthfeel is of good weight and carbonation brings out the creaminess, balance is excellent, yum"
"Drinkability- This could easily become something I have a couple of in my fridge all the time. It was def a refreshing beer and none of the aspects overcrowded the others, everything has a great balance to it. I enjoyed it very much"
"D: Tried this about 6 months ago and did not like it. Two of these were snuck into a sixer of Santa's Private Reserve, now I love the complexity of it. Not too many in a sitting though because these could catch up to you pretty quick."
"D - I would have to say this is not my favorite beer by Rogue, I wish others were available in 6-packs down here, but all in all this a damn fine beer and worth a try, this one is even better on tap"
"D - Very drinkable. Great balance of malts and hops. Excellent beer!"
" Reddish/gold color with a thin off white head that stuck around till the end.Sweet Aroma of caramel,bread,pine and malt. Flavor is warm sweet nutty malt,with just the right roast,maybe some honey notes,and a nice little pine hop finish,nice lively mouthfeel.A very Solid Offering.I could drink several of these at one sitting no problem."
"Poured into pint glass. Virtually no head on top of the caramel golden body. Smell is very sweet. Taste matches the smell. Kind of a sweet hoppy taste, smooth. Mouthfeel is light and very smooth. Don't think I could drink too many of these as the taste is a little overpowering. Overall a solid Rogue brew."
"I think this is a pretty decent beer. I don't have anything else to rate againist in its category so I may have to come back and rerate the beer."
"Drinkability: Its a very delicious beer. Its got some nice hops as the backbone with some nice citrus and grassy notes. Its a good beer, nothing to go too crazy over, but a definate win over Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada. A bit more $$ than those, but its a better version of SA for sure and has a nice continued aftertaste that is sweet and grassy."
"D - Sweetness really limits this one for me. It actually reminds me a bit of cider and I can't drink a lot of that either. A good brew nonetheless."
"D=for me, this fits the definition of my quintessential session beer."
"(rated Jun 11, 2007)"
"The smell is malty, but sweet, the taste favors the smell. Feels great on the tongue, and I could see this being more of a go-to session beer for me in the future."
"Future outlook: Good session beer that I would certainly never sneer at or turn away. Next time heavy, relatively mindless drinking is afoot, this will be a consideration."
"A cornucopia of flavors here. Zesty hops and caramel sweetness blend together nicely. Toasty notes add to the bitterness. You can tell there is some alcohol here, but it's hard to put a number on. This is a surprisingly good beer that I did not have super-high hopes for. I will buy this again, fo sho."
"Got it in a 64 oz. growler, that glows in the dark. Dark amber pour with a thick, creamy off-white head. Rich, caramel malt and spun sugar aroma. Sweet, very malty beer. Lots of caramel and chewy malt, but blended with candy-sweet grapefruit hops. Very easy to drink. I'd drink this again any time."
"Pours a red/amber colored body, with a medium-sized head, but is quickly diminishing. Has a malty aroma, some sweetness, and some hops. Taste has malty-hoppy flavor, some sweetness. Not too bad. Better as it warms up."
"I'm reasonably confident that the next time I reach for a beer to give to my BMC friends I will reach for Dead Guy Ale. It's just plain good, but it has the advantage of being good in ways that don't seem crazy to macro-lager drinkers."
"Not very complex, but a nice hoppy flavor, an easy drink, good biting aftertaste that lingers throughout quaff."
"Note to HOMEBREWERS: while Rogue usually silkscreens their bottles, my Dead Guy case had paper labels that will soak off nice and easy for homebrew. Props to Rogue!"
"I haven't had a bad beer from this brewer. I need to try more."
"Appearance: A deep golden brown color with a little off white head.. The nose is hops and some malt. The taste is slightly hoppy with a subtle malt undertones. a very well made beer and very good to drink also The finish is slightly acidic with a little bit of the finish lingering."
"The taste is heavily toasted, caramelized whole wheat bread or overly baked cookies that have slightly burnt plus grapefruit. It soon develops a finish of bitter grapefruit pulp and cookies. It is rather thin and bland and too bitter for the character, but it's pleasant enough."
"D: A balanced beer, good mix of hop and malt. A really good beer."
"Mouthfeel - The medium body and smooth creamy texture with good carbonation coats your mouth and throat nicely. The higher alcohol level does not have a negative impact."
"Drinkability: Nice beer, complex and malty. In my opinion, its too sweet to score above a good. I could definitely drink my fair share, however, I would rather drink something a little more bitter."
"D= Though still a malty ale, the hops in this one provide an interesting balance. Very balanced and highly sessionable."
"Loved this beer. Aroma was very nice, very fruity. Flavor was malty at first, but well balanced. Really, really easy to drink. Very smooth, very enjoyable taste. Definitely looking forward to eventually tasting Double Dead Guy as this is a brew I frequently come back to. Highly recommended."
"Taste: Light maltiness and bitter citrus. Has a sort of strong flavor that will stop some from enjoying it."
"Feels outstanding in the mouth and sticks in there nicely. Highly drinkable!!!!"
"Good beer overall, I will definately pour a few more of these. A good session beer."
"I'd heard great report about this one from friends, so my anticipation was high. Nothing could have prepared me for this one though. I found the taste very unusual, but that's not a bad thing. The fruitiness caught me by surprise, and I detected more than a hint of grapefruit. Would definitely drink again."
"This beer poured a reddish-tinted copper color with a single-finger light tan head. The smell is mostly malt with some fruitiness. The taste starts off with some sweet toasted malts with some dried fruit with some hops at the end. The mouthfeel is a little thick with some fine carbonation. A tasty beverage, but it sits a little heavy and I probably wouldn't want to grab another one immediately after."
"could sit here and drink this all night, might catch up with me but I'd be happy"
"Pours a dark chocolate brown color with burgundy edges and a thin beige foam head. Malty aroma with chocolate, nut and caramel notes. Medium bodied and very quaffable with a slightly hoppy finish. Flavor consists of chcolate maltiness, hazelnut and subtle dark fruit presence"
"Reviewed on 2/28/08. Bottle. Poured an orange/amber color with a creamy white head. Aroma of wheat and floral and citrus hops. Tastes strongly of wheat, wheat malt, and some hops. Cross between an APA, hefeweizen, and heller bock. This is an excellent beer to chill with! 7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"D: Decent beer with a warming alcohol feel. An easy drinking 6.5% with a nice malty sweetness and fruitiness that can be enjoyed even in the summertime."
"Hats off to Rogue for another superior brew!"
"Overall, very easy to have a second or third pint. I've had the 12 0z. and the bomber before, but not out of the growler. Would have been good to do a side by side to see if there was a difference. Overall, another winner from these guys."
"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass, two-finger light tan head with excellent retention. Golden-amber with sticky residue clinging to the glass. Sweet honey smell. Taste of honey, a little hoppy, nutty sweet, some toasted malts and biscuits and horehound. Very smooth, creamy with some hop bite to balance it out. Superb! I could drink this all night long!"
"D - Worth trying, I'd drink it again but there are others in the same price range from Rogue that I'd buy before buying this again."
"Delicious and fairly complex, and rather drinkable, this poster child for Rogue Ales is a worthy and widely available quaffer, making it a great fall-back beer, but not one to be used as an introduction to the uninitiated."
"Overall is a good beer, would buy again, just doesnt really stand out to me."
"D: Very interesting brew... it will take a little getting use to.... Not the best I've had... A little to Hoppy for my taste so it is really not my type."
"I love this beer. Even the bottle looks cool."
"Drinkability: Rogue beers had been hyped up for me before I tried any and this was the first I tried. It lived up to the hype. This is a beer I will definitely be picking up in the future and is definitely now a favorite of mine!"
"overall drinkability is great. nicely balanced."
"D= high, I'll have no problem drinking a few of these anytime. without the high ABV it would be a great session beer. Dangerously good"
"Overall an excellent sessionable beer with excellent balance."
"4.0 D: This is my first Maibock and I like what I'm tasting. I could drink a few of these without getting bored, but there is a hoppy aftertaste that gets old after a while."
"D - A truly drinkable brew. Well balanced and flavorful offering that did not disappoint,."
"D: Very nice balance to a tasty beer. This would be a great beer for just about any purpose. Very well executed."
"This is a very drinkable beer. A very good, refreshing beer."
"Overall a very interesting brew, will buy again! And i must say a very interesting style of beer."
"Goes down easy, not realy thic, not coorsl light thin either. Never tried this beer before today, dunno why its everywhere. Its decent, and if rogue didn't price thier beer like gold i would have it again. good beer , very sessionable, but this is no maibock."
"D: Overall, this is an ""o.k."" ale. The lighter body allows one to drink easily, but the after taste was just a little harsh. Others have given this a high rating. Maybe a different bottle will change my opinion."
"Worth a try, Cheers!!"
"Taste: Soft creamy malt with a subtle bitterness and a well balanced body that makes this a very pleasant and easy drinking ale"
"Live it up!"
"D - Nice enough but not that outgoing for a Rogue beer."
"This brew had a good, full flavor to it with a hoppy finish that was just right, not too bitter. Well balanced between the hops and malt. Overall pretty good, although I wouldn't knife anyone over this beer..."
"An outstanding Maibock especially if you can get it fresh."
"Comments I really liked this beer a lot it is one of a very few that made me say WOW. A maibock that is an ale, who'd a thought it. I'll be getting a lot more of these."
"This is a really great beer and great to have with hot and spicy dishes."
"D- Not one I'd go back to soon. A little too overpowering in flavor, and not in a good way. I will, however, pick up another and revisit it some other time."
"Comes out of the bottle a dark, appetizing, clear amber with a very thick and fluffy yellowish off-white head. Aroma is strong and mainly malty with fruity and hoppy hints. Mouth-filling flavor is edgy, malty, with a good hoppy undertone and just the right amount of bitterness. Texture is lively and edgy, and it leaves a bitter but satisfying aftertaste."
"Very enjoyable. This beer has a nice body in between the sweeter notes, and a great dry finish. Very drinkable, just wish it was cheaper in my area."
"A tasty session brew."
"A good sessionbeer from Rogue that i'll gladely buy again if i can find it. Very balanced. Yummy!"
"I guess it is suiting that most places can only get it in $6 650ml bottles..."
"This beer pours a semmi cloudy amber with a 1 fingered head and lacing. The smell is of hops and nuts. The flavor has a nice nutty flavor to start, the malt base to this beer seems a little weak, and the hops seem alot more muted than the nose. Not the most comfortable mouthfeel, but it seems nicely carbonated. Not the most drinkable of beers but I don't think I will have a problem finishing off this bomber."
"Overall, a really nice beer. Works well in the colder months, and would be fabulous when the mercury rises. Wish I had another bomber of this."
"D - Very drinkable but some might consider it a little strong"
"d. Definitely drinkable and fairly sessionable. This one is a touch on the sweet malt side for me, which is saying a fair bit, as I'm a sucker for caramel and toffee in my beers. The hops just didn't quite pack enough of a punch to properly balance the malt sweet in my mind... maybe this bottle has been sitting for a good while? Either way, a pretty solid brew with some impressive characteristics. Definitely worth a try."
"."
"D - One of the more drinkable American Maibock-style ales I've come across."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable for a bock, it's amazing how the contrast of fruit and stronger malts tends to smoothley fit with eachother. This was definetley a diamond in the rough for me, an excellent beer with just the right amount of hops and bite. Good job to the guys at Rogue."
"Drinkability: This Maibock is phenominal. The rich, creamy taste will soothe you to the core, no matter what time you indulge in it. You can drink this with dinner, with a snack, as a session beer, or any other time. So stop reading this and go get some Dead Guy Ale, pretty soon you'll be writing up the same praise I am."
"This beer is very well-balanced with a very pleasing flavor profile. Highly drinkable."
"My first Rogue, and this is a great start. Wonderful back-and-forth play between hops and malts. An excellent ale. Love the name, too."
"Mouthfeel is thick smooth and lightly carbonated. Very easy to drink."
"Picked up growler at Majestic on Inwood in Dallas. Sealed with a breakable sticker. Poured into pint glass aggressively, not much reaction from the brew, just a minor head that killed to nothing pretty quick. Amber brown in color, head might have been off white, low visible carbonation. Taste is solid. Good malthead flavors, sweet, low carbonation, no real strong noticeable hops."
"D - I thought this beer was delicious; very drinkable, and a real treat for a beer that is fairly (broadly) available."
"I brought this home tonight to try and WOW. Has to be one of my top beers period. I am flat out in love. I have never had a maibock and now I want to try others. Perfect all the way around. Wonder aprearance and superb taste with no negative aftertaste."
"Moderate bitterness. Creamy and smooth characteristics make this highly drinkable. Recommend you try this one."
"D - Delicious and highly drinkable, but for $10 dollars a six here in Ohio (I think that's about what it goes for back home in Oregon) this is a beer that I can only afford for special occasions (perhaps end of spring term?!). My first go with a Hellas bock and I throughly enjoyed it. This beer also has sentimental value to me because I bought it a midnight on my 21st birthday - represent Oregon!"
"D: Very well balanced and drinkable. This was a store bought growler and for ten bucks it was a pretty good deal. I will have to give this a try on tap in the near future."
"Feel is smooth, creamy, and well-carbonated. Medium-bodied. Drinkability is pretty good. The alcohol is well hidden. If not for the sweetness, I could drink this all day."
"Consistent, good level of carbonation. A bit creamy. Medium bodied. If the speed with which I can knock a couple of these back is any indication, it is certainly drinkable."
"Serving type: 12 ounce bottle"
"D: Easy to drink, though I felt a bit boring. Haven't had many maibocks yet, so maybe I am not used to the style yet."
"Poured a golden brown color with a nice white head. Smelled of hops and malt sweetness. Tasted of crisp hops, slight citrus, and spices upfront. Smooths out and finishes with low hop taste and crisp malt flavor. Flavor lets the tongue know its there but does not damage, goes down great too."
"Not to mention the label is pretty sweet marketing."
"I could drink this stuff all day. It's really just an all-around great beer."
"D: Fantastic brew and very cool to get such a wide offering of a unique style (and a damn good style at that). I'm moving towards buying more 750ml. offerings, so Rogue's more extreme brews are on the near horizon, after this I'm excited!"
"Usually not too big of a fan of this style but this beer was delicious. A nice honey taste to it and at 6.5% ABV it went down a little bit too easy. A very smooth and drinkable beer. A little expensive at how much it is for a 22 oz. but I was glad I got try it and would try it again in a heartbeat."
"A nice thick mouthfeel, what a tasty beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - goes down very smooth and isn't too strong, but the sweetness might be too much after awhile."
"Drink> heck yeah. One of Rogue's best."
"Despite the strength of this beer, it is a highly drinkable session beer."
"This beer settles down in the glass with an amber/copper color and a big cap of comely foam. The aroma has bread dough characteristics balanced with some citrus hops. A slight sweetness kisses the palate in the beginning but it quickly gives way to an assault of hoppy bitterness. This is a fine beer and quite drinkable. A beer that can be enjoyed year round."
"Very sweet aroma thick with malts and hints of fruits. Slight ting of alcohol in the very back of the nose. Pours hazy golden color with a quick fizz and minimal ring around the glass. Flavor is very sweet malts that go from caramel flavor to more sweet fruit as it warms. A very nice hop balance kicks in with just the right amount of ""bite"" to clean the sweetness. Towards the end some alchol warmth kicks in but is not obvious. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated this beer is very smooth in the mouth. Good drinkability due to the great balance of flavors."
"Poured this 22oz bomber into my large pilsner glass. This beer pours a dark golden color with a nice two finger head that quickly disappears. Smells of malts yeast and I love the honey smell. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and nicely carbonated. Tastes of dried fruits with a nice bitter finish. drinkability is high, I really enjoyed this bomber."
"Good beer for a group of buddies sitting around just shooting the breeze."
"Now that I've had this beer from Rogue I'll have to try them all!"
"Poured into a pilsner and got a light amber color beer with a light tan head that was about two and a half fingers thick and slowly thinned out. The body is crystal clear with some mild carbonation in the center. There are some strong dark fruit aromas mixed in with some hops and a hint of apples, there is a slight sour aroma but I can't quite place it. It has a smooth hoppy flavor up front, sweet over all and slightly bitter on the side of your tongue, it has some roasted malt flavors as you swallow it. It has a medium body with a very slight carbonation fell to it. It is pretty smooth over all and goes down pretty easily."
"D: This beer is nice but its not blowing me away in any sense of the word. I will drink again if offered but I am not going to go out of my way to track it down."
"Orange/amber in color with a slight haziness. Average head volume with nice lacing and retention. The malts and hops battle it out in the nose, but the smell of malts ultimately win out. The opposite is true for taste. The malts and hops battle once again, however the hops win here in the taste department! This beer always seems a little on the thin side for me, but the carbonation still stimulates the palate. I give this beer a ""session"" rating. This is a beer you can drink all night long and not get bored!"
"Beautiful honey color complimented by a nice, off-white head. Smells of alcohol and honey battling for supremacy. The taste is of floral notes, a touch of black pepper, and then delicious hop, dry finish. An impressive complexity of flavor and personality."
"The pour is thin, forming a cloudy copper brown brew with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Odour lacks complexity, with a sharp, citrus element. The hops are present, but not prominent. The taste is fairly omnidirectional, with the aforementioned citrus zing, and a light bitterness to finish. The body is light, and tends not to linger on the pallet. The beer is fairly sweet, though more in a fruit sense than saccharine. It drinks easily, and with its alcohol content, refuses to be a heady beer."
"Very good. Will make regular rotations in my fridge."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a light brown with a bit of amber, little to no head. Smells primarily roasted malts with a mix of citrus. Good medium body with a sweet flavor and a slight tinge of bitterness. This beer got me started on craft beer, I owe it all to you Rogue."
"I dug a hole in a shale bed under the hot sun - then I went inside and drank this beer. Basically nothing about it stood out to me - the plus was no aftertaste, it was just down then gone from my memory. No interest in trying it again, but nothing wrong with it."
"Overall Impression - The malt profile of this beer is quite nice. It's a solid beer that's pretty drinkable. They used a pretty clean yeast. I detect no diacetyl or DMS."
"D- awesome"
"Pours a murky copper color with moderate head and lacing. Sweet fruity hoppy aroma. Flavor is sweet and somewhat fruity with a nice hop/malt balance. Slight bitter finish. Solid beer. Seems like this could fall between a Pale Ale and an IPA, but regardless of what style it falls under I liked it."
"Classic dark amber sliding towards copper color. The smell is malt with cane or natural sugar. Very little wispy lacing and little retention. Toasted malts come forward first then some herbal hops followed by a semi-bitter biscuit-like finish. Light carbonation and a great mouth feel. Smooth and pleasant without being too much of this or that. Balanced and very Ale-like. A good flagship but not the best Rogue by any means."
"This is definitely a session beer. I would make this a beer that I always kept in my fridge if I had a extra money on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: Endlessly drinkable. A great taste that does not dominate or wreck the pallet, in a beer that you can drink all night. An amazingly well balanced beer that everyone should try."
"Notes-I find this to be an excellent and most drinkable bier a delight for the senses."
"12oz bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Allowed to warm for about 10 minutes from the fridge. Pours a clear, medium copper with a nice fluffy head which dissipates. Medium aroma of straight-up malt. Initial tastes are mainly malty with a tiny bit of sweetness and a slight hop tang. Aftertaste becomes more hoppy as it warms. Balanced. Medium bodied. S'alright."
"Nice ale. Cheers."
"D: Very high. Be continuing to come back to this one. When I read others making a reference to ""session beer", I think this would be it."
"DGA pours dark copper and has a wonderful sweet malty flavor that's quickly followed by a strong West Coast hop bite. I'm not sure that it exactly follows the guidelines for a maibock, but I do know that it's quite delicious (and pairs excellently with pizza)."
"It's a little late when I got home so I don't know how many I'll finish, but I know I won't switch over and I will be drinking these puppies until I go to sleep. At least three, maybe four = drinkable for sure. As for the high marks, well I liked it! What should I have done?"
"Deceptively easy to drink and quite enjoyable. This beer is smooth and mild yet still has a nice hop ending. The beer to me is a good transition beer, one that's a good gateway beer to superior craft beer. Probably why there are over 1,200 reviews."
"Cheers..."
"Prosit!"
"This stuff is pretty good but the only problem is that the taste gets old once I get about halfway through with the glass. It's a good brew, definitely not a real bock, but it just doesn't really do it for me as much as others."
"D: A nice little ale from Rogue, not a true maibock, but a nice hybrid, a lot better than some of the stuff that's out there. Could buy again."
"Good brew indeed. Bought a bomber a while back and cracked it after a long day and a nice shower. Pours a burnt orange color almost looks like a dark rich honey. There is a white medium sized head that forms and soon dissipates to a white film, zero lacing is left on my glass and a steady stream of carbonation works it's way up to the top. The aroma is nice easily detected but not too strong which primarily consists of delectable sweet malts. Very pleasant and appealing the scent lured me into a balanced flavor of sweet malts. I was expecting something over the top but this beer was simple and delivered, perhaps perfecting a recipe that relies on a sturdy malt characteristic only is what makes this ale so good. Creamy mouthfeel that goes down full and finishes slightly dry. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer simply for what it does right."
"Drinkability- could down a few of these in a session, not my first choice.."
"Drinkability- Definitely drinkable,"
"Pours a clean orange color with a nice off white head. In the aroma, a sweet buscuity malt. In the taste, a sweet malt, and small grapefruity hop. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry, and small hop aftertaste. Quite like an IPA, small bite and good."
"This beer will never disappoint. It is full-flavored, hearty and well-rounded. I think I'll have another!"
"Amber colored brew with an off white fluffy head. Some lacing but minimal. Smells of sweet carmallized malt, a touch of honey as well as hints of spicey hop, and overripe citrus. Taste is very sweet carmelled malt, with hints of the citrus I smelled and a slight bitter hop finish. Overall it has a medium mouth feel with light carbonation and allthough the scales are tipped pretty far to the malt side of things it still comes off as very drinkable."
"D- a fine Maibock with good hops character, highly recommended."
"D: superior drinkability, this is a great anytime beer. very pleased I ordered one"
"D: Definitely drinkable, I have yet to be disappointed in any Rogue that I've had thus far. I will say I'm not a big fan of paying $5.50 for the bomber but this brew is worth it."
"You get the picture. A fine beer but not an exciting beer."
"Poured a light amber, but not translucent, in color with a thick white head. A light hoppiness aroma, well balanced. The taste was of hops, well balanced, not to bitter, and a caught of hint of caramel. It had an excellent texture. It was a hot afternoon sitting outside, and I had a number of them. I didn't think it was to heavy, and recommend it as a session beer. Overall I enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability is good, pairs well with pasta."
"If I didn't know it was supposed to be a bock I would've simply thought it was a maltier attempt at an APA. Highly drinkable!"
"Serving type: tap"
"Blown away by this beer and its complexity."
"D - Very high. Great brew for spicy Chinese take out!"
"Orange colored ale with a fading head that stays as a thin film on top.Aroma is some kind of fruit.Taste is citrus,caramel and bread.I was worried that this was going to be another overhyped ale but it wasn't!!Probably one of the easiest drinking ales I've ever had.Good flavor from first to last sip.I highly recommend and will purchase again shortly!!"
"drinkability - dont know if this is a beer i would like to drink alot of at one time, but i think paring with ceratin foods, or enjoying on a hot sunny day yes...."
"Pours an amber/copper that leaves a two fingered soapy head. As the head disipatates it leaves behind sticky lacing that clings then dries and clings to the glass. The aroma is of malts and dried fruits. Earthy hops and caramel come through as well. The taste is similar to the aroma. Strong malty caramel upfront that dominates and an earthness of hops and dried fruit. It's not too bitter nor it's not too sweet. The mouthfeel is slick,thick, and creamy. Dead Guy Ale is good to the last drop. As it warms the flavors are more pronounced. I can't believe the abv is 6.5. This beer goes down easy and finishes smooth. Recommended!!!"
"A very drinkable beer, I'll buy more of these."
"Pours medium honey color with thick bubbly head that dissipates kind of quickly, leaving a thin flim and spidery lace. Malty aroma that is slightly sweet and grassy. Maybe a hint of tropical fruit as well. Malty IF that has a honey flavor. Picks up a nicely balanced bitterness for the finish. Very tasty. Medium bodied with a pleasant almost light syrup finish. Very drinkable any time of year."
"Excellent beer!"
"Overall a good beer, I will buy this one again. I am not sure I what I expected from this one as it was a gift and I specifically chose not to read up on it prior."
"drinkability: snappy and tasty, rather refreshing while being full of flavor. I approve"
"Another well crafted and balanced beer from Rogue. Tastes of pale malts (a little sweet), the fruitiness is not as evident as I assumed it would be after smelling the beer. Finishes with a good hop bitterness."
"Orange body and a compact off-white head that leaves little lacing. Fruity, bready aroma, with a touch of floral hops. Holy malt, batman. Fruit and caramel malt transitioning through to honey baked bread with a flowery hoppy finish. Surprising warmth from the alcohol. Full, slick, perfectly balanced mouthfeel, with fairly aggressive carbonation. Huge drinkability, and I'm already planning on taking a sixer to the July 4th bbq."
"I like everything about this brew. A+ for the folks at Rogue."
"A nice drinking beer. I really enjoyed it more on-tap than in the bottle."
"D: How's your wallet?"
"This is a very good, drinkable, malt-forward beer with - let's face it - one of the coolest names and labels out there."
"Overall a good brew that will cut through meat dishes with ease and can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Not the best example of the style but serviceable nonetheless."
"None of this is to suggest that this isn't a beer which goes down smooth. Wet and slippery in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation to keep it alive. It's intoxicatingly drinkable for something so hoppy and bock like. Perfect for when you need or want something to fall back to. Thanks again, Rogue, you've sure created a classic."
"It has a medium body that is a little rough in the mouth and sticky in the throat. It leaves a mild coating that can be distracting. It's a decent anytime beer, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"D - Perfect year-round ale that is also food friendly,be it burgers, ribs, or fish."
" I would take a 6 pack (or 12) of these over any AB product any day. This just tastes good, I cant pinpoint all the flavors yet but its very very flavorful. A good malty aftertaste for me. This is probly the first beer I have that I could easily just grab a 6 pack and be good on just this. Props to Rogue for making a flavorful beer. I will be trying all of there other styles."
"I prefer a fuller bodied beer...BUT, the 6.5 ABV did the trick on a lazy summer afternoon. A steal at the price."
"Extremely smooth and drinkable."
"This is a good beer, it did not blow me away, but drinkable. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug, it produced a hazy, looked like apple cider, appearance, with a white thick head that dissolved fairly quick. The aroma was malt with a health hint of apple. The taste was unique. The apple really came out, which provided some sweetness, along with a nice malt and hop combination. Overall, this is a good beer that is drinkable, but not something that I will have to keep in stock, but something that I will pick up from time to time."
"M + D: Lighter, without much for carbonation. Kinda lopsided in balance between those. Easy to drink, perhaps not as intriguing as German brews of the style, but a decent drink, nonetheless."
"Shiny copper with a bit of murk in color and a moderate head that hangs tight for a minute or two before vanishing. A very scrumptious malty, nutty and caramel aroma. A sweet and creamy toasty malt thing is the first thing noticed in the taste. Not too sweet though because a hop bitterness balances it out. Neither dominate the flavor but compliment each other in a nice complexity. The caramel nuances don't take away from the hop bite nor from the malt roast but add the the overall flavor. A great blend that leaves a slightly dry but mostly soothing feeling in the throat."
"This beer has flavor and drinkability. Definitely easy to kick back and have a few of these!"
"d-yes this is drinkable however I was looking for something different. I think I'll start drinking and reviewing a beer twice before writing a review."
"Beer is a coppery color with a thin soapy head that dissipates to lacy bubbles quickly. Smell is pleasant, hops and malt combine for a very tart green apple nose. Hops are ever present in this beer but less aggressive than most rogue beers. Medium malt flavor with an herbal taste of tea and caramel that tasted great, but really needed more presence in this beer. Decent, well-balanced beer from Rogue."
"D- Light, refreshing, and pleasant. Just what I needed in this 80+ degree weather."
"Overall, a very easy drinking beer."
"Overall very nice. Would recommend."
"Side note: If you have not tried the Sweetwater IPA, I would highly recommend searching it out if you're in the Southeast. Fantastic hops! You'll swear they squeeze a grapefruit in every bottle."
"Drinkability is ok, but even this much richer draught version still isn't really my cup of tea, just a bit to thick, I still think this one is lacking the crispness of a lager yeast that a bock mandates."
"D: I like that this is a lighter bock and is one complex beer that doesnt crush you with the malts. Well done by Rogue."
"D- I picked up this beer after reading plenty of articles about it. Although not a big Maibock fan or even well versed in this particular style I found this beer to be very easy to consume and enjoyable. A beautiful looking beer that went down well and tasted great. I am definately glad I gave this beer a shot and would certainly get this again."
"D: Good. I like this beer on a hot day. Have to pace yourself since the 6.5% can get you when you're not looking."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but perhaps a bit too sweet to be sessionable for me."
"Drinkability: very good, would make a fine hoppy session beer."
"D: Appropriately for a Maibock, sampled in May. Fairly complex malt with a nice hop touch. Moderate ABV for the style and structured well, overall very drinkable and certainly a looker. I like it, just a tad pricey for a session, $6.00 a bomber in my area, if someone else picked up the tab I'd drink it all night."
"D-This could be an everyday brew for me."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. However, so are many other amber-style beers. Huge props for going the different route and brewing a Maibock instead of the ubiquitous amber that's the ""flagship"" of so many US breweries. However, the price point doesn't justify this beer for me. I don't mind paying more for a bomber of the superb Shakespeare Stout, Brutal Bitter or many others, but it's harder to pay the Rogue premium for a beer that doesn't stand out much among a crowd of worthy ""ambers"" that run nearly 50% less. Price is usually reflected in my drinkability score, and certainly is for this beer."
"This was my first encounter with Rogue. Pours with a pleasant aroma and produces a nice head that lasts long enough but doesn't wear out its welcome. Distinct bready aroma with enough malt to be different. Especially noticeable was the change in aroma as the beer got warmer: the breadiness went away and was replaced with some pleasant apples and bananas. Not too demanding, and fizzy enough to be a good summer beer. Nice all around. Would definitely try others from Rogue."
"pours a slighlty hazy med. gold-copper color w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing in my nonic ; not a strong smell, bready w/ steely cereal grain and some darker malts, butter and dark fruit noted as well ; a sweet, malty ""strong tea""-like flavor with hints of whole grain bread, caramel and raison in decent balance w/ the hop bitterness, a bit of a minerally finish ; a rich med. body w/ a moderate amount of co2 ; a very drinkable brew, esp. for a bock, my only regret is not getting more..."
"I can safely say this is the best maibock I've tasted."
"D: While I do like this beer I would never get a second. There is something about it that just does not make it drinkable to me. Don't get me wrong I have drank a ton of this just never more than one in a sitting...unless I was already drunk."
"Poured from a bomber to a pilsner glass a dark honey orange color with a minimal head that quickly settled. It had a malty sweet aroma and the taste was the same with a hint of honey. With it's medium body, light carbonation and crisp finish I could definately drink a few of these."
"This is turning into one of my favorite session beers. Has plenty of taste yet it's still drinkable. Can't beat that. Had this one on tap at Tapwerks in Oklahoma City. Notice it has a bit more bite on tap. Reddish orange brew. Bartender filled it to the rim, so there's no head. No complaints here. Smells hoppy and citrusy with a slight sweet malt essence in the background. Tastes of oranges and a perfect mix of hops and malts with some florals hiding out. There's a bit of chalkiness to it as well. Tasty and very drinkable. This one always leaves me satisfied."
"*Edit: Just drank another bottle of this and thoroughly enjoyed it. Was alot more drinkable, and I loved the flavor the second time around."
"First off, most people thought that this ""strong"" beer tasted a lot less like a typical maibock than it did like a typical ale. It lacks the springy flavor of most maibocks, and comes across with a heavy, ""good flavor."" That said, most people enjoyed it, though less than one might expect. Some thought it was ""bitter"" and just a touch overpowering, especially given its not-particularly-high ABV."
"Pours a well toasted and keenly hazey copper with just a few highlights of golden apple yellow. Great thick foam with a little lacing just above the top of the beer. The aroma is of great toasty malts with a good dollop of earthy, herbal hops. Maye a faint hint of fruits mixed in there. The taste is an upfront toast with a little light red currant jelly just tickling the outsides of the tastebuds. The middle gives a good herbal hop definiton. Finishing with slightly creamy malts and a more earthy hop tone. Very clean, earthy hop palate with a clean malt bill. Very good beer. Great hoppy maibock."
"This beer is quite malty with a distinct alcohol tinge to it and a hint of peach. It's a drinkable beer, but I'm partial to hoppy IPA's, so maybe not the guy to ask about drinkability;) This brew has an amber haze, but is without floaties. A good drink that's bitter and a slightly flat with a little acid prick. Nice one!"
"Hops and grapefruit, bitter all the way through. There's a little bitter chocolate taste mixed in too. The body is pretty thick, moderately carbonated with a nice warmth coming along. I feel like this lacks some of the better qualities, but is a pretty good maibock, if not at least a very unique one."
"Except for the very poor mouthfeel, a great beer, one that I would recommend from the bottle."
"This is a very drinkable ale and will look for this again."
"Overall - Another pretty solid brew from Rogue... nothing earth shattering but definitely worth a try..."
"drinkability - This was a very good beer, i'm keane to hops but this was the best balanced beer that I have tasted in a long time."
"O- A quality beer. A definite recomendation on this one."
"D- Drinkable, yes, but I could go for a bit more character with my elevated ABV brew"
"Do I recommend this? Yes, but words of wisdom, pour it in a glass."
"D: a good beer to drink in good company, I will recommend it, A versatile anytime beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a pilsner glass. Poured golden amber with an inch thick white foam head that didnt last too long. Gave off anice floral scent with a hoppy malt sweet smell. The taste was immediate honey sweetness followed by a nice hoppy bite. Finished with slight alcohol warmth. Overall a nice medium bodied crisp feel with fairly light carbonation. Good hoppy spice feel. Enjoyed this one and could defintely a couple more of these tasty bombers."
"I'd heard good things about Dead Guy Ale, and though it didn't quite live up to all the hype (IMO), it was certainly worthy of some praise."
"D: A well-balanced taste with a nice mouthfeel made this a fairly drinkable beer. Goes down nice and easy."
"Pours a dark copper color with nice half inch head. Smell is has malty aromas and alcohol. Not much to excited about here. Taste is moderately bitter but goes down pretty smooth. Malts here are kept pretty low. Overall it's a decent beer, but unfortunately the hops overpower the maltiness."
"It's really not that drinkable of a beer, but this is probably because the strong flavours aren't my favourite."
"This is a very tasty, well balanced beer that hides its 6.5% ABV very well."
"Not a bad session beer."
"Drinkability: Alcohol is kind of high for what it is, but overall, I could drink a couple pints of this if I could ever find it on tap in the great white north. Damned polar bears....Stealing all the Rogue."
"A good beer. Maibocks are a style I haven't had much experience with, and perhaps the phenols I found slightly irksome are simply natural and maybe even desirable flavors and aromas of this style. Taking those out of the equation, however, and this is a great, crisp, delicious beer."
"Decently light, but has a good mouth feel and definite boldness. Pretty big flavor packed into this. Very enjoyable."
"D - I heard alot about this beer ut wasnt overly crazy about it"
"Great flavor. Fruity, malty goodness with a dry hop finish. One of the better Rogue ales."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a nice amber color with a 3/4 inch white head. There was a sweet smell to this, very fruity with hints of spice. A little citrus, maybe orange or grapefruit and a mild cinnamon hint. Tastes smooth with little carbonation, very full of the fruitiness you smell. Subtle hints of spice. This is a lighter body brew, but very refreshing. Very solid ale."
"Note: I am not going to say that one should not purchase this beer as I have bought this and liked it. Try it and see what you think."
"D - Solid session beer, but nothing to get overly excited about..."
"D- very nice, ubiquitous beer. Won't buy it very often as for the price there are superior brews, but it's pretty darn good as mass-produced ""craft"" beers go."
"An awesome, everyday, anytime beer."
"This poured a dark copper with only a little head. By far the mildest beer I've had from Rogue, it smelled and tasted of very sweet citrus hops and malt blend. It had really good texture and a mild aftertaste. It had a decent overall flavor that was well balanced and easy to drink, but nothing too special."
"Bought this in a half gallon sized bottle. Ended up resealing and finishing the day after which probably wasn't the best idea but it did indeed maintain is carbonation which was good. The beer had a bit of hoppiness to it but nothing overwhelming and overall tasted very good. At first smell it seemed to have a strong alcoholic odor but mellowed out while the bottle was open."
"It was a very nice Amber color. It had nice sized head that recedes fairly quickly, with little to no lacing visible. It had a slight hoppy and caramel taste, as well as pumpkin especially in the finish. It had a nice mouth feel with good carbonation, enjoyable to drink."
"D- I will enjoy this often. A very solid Maibock."
"Poured a cloudy amber from a 12 oz bottle. Smell was apple juice and fruity with a faint hop aroma. Taste is nice, sweet malt...but not too sweet with a mild hop finish. I really didn't know what to expect with this beer because it just says ""Ale"". But man, it was a nice balance. Sweet malt based with a well balanced hop finish. Mouth feel is wonderful. Perfectly carbonated in my opinion. The drinkability for me isn't the best though. 6.5%. I can hang with 3 at the most. I couldn't sit there and drink like 6 of these (12oz) but...I'd like to start a session with just one of these."
"One of my favorites, and I just brewed the recipie, hopfully it turns out as good as the original."
"Aroma is predominantly malty, caramel, hints of fruitiness. On the palate there is soft carbonation and medium body, a bit sticky in the finish. Taste is much less sweet than expected from the smell...but sweetness is there, but a masterful balance of crisp hoppy bitterness, hints of spice and alcohol tingling, a constant interplay between malt and hops that keeps this substantial beer almost refreshing...not a dry thirst quencher, but invigorates the palate. This aspect makes this beer quite drinkable, even as I am licking the sweet malt of my lips, I am ready to reach for another. Great with food. Very well made brew."
"M/D - Very well balanced with good carbonation. This would make a great session beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad easy going. A versatile anytime beer."
"D- Tasty brew indeed, however, the taste become a bit redundant after 2... Also, the tartness becomes a bit too dominant after the first 1. Still, I recommend trying this."
"D: Quite drinkable, I'm sure I'll tip a few of these back today. Not too bad of a beer in all, just not one of my favorites. Tasty though."
"Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish"
"Overall decent, I may give this one another shot someday. I feel like something I ate or drank beforehand threw off the flavor. Either that or the beer was old. :("
"overall, this is a good brew that i really enjoyed but its a style that isnt my favorite very good forthe style though"
"Drinkability is high as this beer is smooth and refreshing with low alcohol and great flavor."
"Orange-reddish hue with almost slight foam, which almost completely disappears after a few minutes. Smells of malts -- lots of caramel and butterscotch -- with faint aroma of hops. Malts dominate the flavor, but there's a nice balance of citrus hops and fruity esters. Even at 6.5 ABV, this was very drinkable as I could not wait until the next sip."
"Pours a bright hazy brown color with a nice egg-shell colored head that dissipated quickly into a slight cap, leaving some spotty lacing on the glass. The smell is of bready/doughy Munchen malt, with a floral honey aroma. The taste upfront is of the doughy Munich malt, honey, a touch of ash and bitter hop. Perhaps a very slight hint on lemon and pepper. The feel is moderate with semi-soft carbonation, finishes well balanced; slightly on the bitter side. A very nice and enjoyable ale. The sweetness of the Munich malt is offset with some bitter hops. The feel remains light thus making this a very drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and this beer is extremely easy to drink. Solid beer."
"A hazy amber in appearance with a white head. A fruity smell with a hint of honey and flower petals. Sweet in taste with a good bite from the alcohol and carbonation. An incredibly balanced beer. I really like this one from Rogue. Easily drinkable. Wife doesn't like the bite. I likey the bite."
"An all-around must for beer lovers. Pours a darkish-brown w/ ruby tints with marginal head that leaves tiny amounts of lacings. A malty smell follows, although there are dark fruit smells that I picked up. A very smooth beer with a light to medium body which underlies a very malty taste. Can't tell if there are some coffee or roasted/toasted malts in there, but there is a malty sharpness. Overall it is smooth because there is some faint sweetness brought on, but this is balanced with a dryer backbite from the hops. At 6% it is just there for sessioning - buy a six-pack and chill out with this beer."
"Very nice, aside from the aroma."
"i've been wanting to try this beer for a while, and i think it is quickly becoming one of my favorites."
"D - I really like the hop levels. Very nice punch you're not to miss. I could drink a few of these."
"D- This is a very flavorful ale. I could (and am going to right now) drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Get this on Tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Augusta!"
"Drinkability is good. A tad sweet to throw down too many but it was tasty for sure."
"Very nice brew. Just solid, well-balanced. BTW, goes amazingly well with a buttery, toasty Reuben sandwich (w/ swiss cheese)."
"Overall this was a well combined effort with the senses having a go at the hops, malt, and alcohol presence. There was not a lot of lacing later on but it is still a keeper, at least for a little while."
"Pours amber-brown, whte head drops cleanly. Aroma is dark fruits over a malt base. Flavor is toasted malt with some bitter hops coming through at the finish. Alcohal warmth is not over-powering but more than expected for 6.6% ABV. A nice beer I'd have again."
"D: Extraordinarily drinkable. Excellent sessionability. One is definitely not enough. Very nice taste, not very complex, but very smooth. Another winner for Rogue!"
"Cloudy reddish brown pour. Typically smell similar to the few other heller bocks i've had. Sweet, tart taste and smell of dried fruit and honey with a touch of bitterness too. Best one I've had of the style, but it's still not one of my favorites. I will say this grew on me a little bit, but I don't see buying it again still."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It poured an amber color with a white 3-finger head that left no real laceing and went away quickly. The smell of this beer was malts with just a hint of honey and light floral hops. The taste gave way to a little more hops with more of a malt and honey aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, and the overall drinkability of this beer is decent. Not the best beer I've had, but definatly will be one to pick up agian."
"D- A fairly drinkable beer, I do not consider this to be an example of a Maibock though."
"D: A little too much for me to want more than one at a time. I'd go back to this again, however. Would go well with highly seasoned food."
"</metaphorzz>"
"D-I really enjoyed this one. I will definitely buy this one again, and so far, it's my favorite from this brewery. Props to Inebrio for recommending this one."
"I tried hard to be objective reviewing this ale. I waited a long time to review it because it is one of my personal favorites. I can't put my finger on it but man, this is good! I like the maltiness but I also like that bitter citrus finish and this one has them both without being too refined. Perhaps that's what I like about it - it's just a little rough around the edges and I like it. One of my favorite standbys after a long day at work."
"I like this one quite a bit. Much better than their American Amber. Aroma is mainly malty with some light grapefruit, apricot, grapes, and yeast. Pours a medium cloudy amber with a small off-white head that goes away. Flavor is good, sweet throughout with a nice alcoholic bite in the finish. Quite nice. I would by this again and serve to dinner guests, well worth getting a sixxer if you can find one."
"Overall, this is a really good beer. You can definitely compare this to a German-bock-style beer, though it has a far bigger malt flavor and smell than anything I've had in this style. I like to smell my beer before each sip, and each time I smell this beer, I think of how grains smell in the mashing stage of brewing - filling the room with that awesome roasting grain smell. This beer is very drinkable. Tastes good, goes down smooth."
"D - This is a very drinkable brew. I threw back 3 of them in the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl! G-MEN Baby!!"
"Dead Guy is a brew that I pass on nearly every time I see it at the store... ""Is it a maibock? is it not?"" It is probably a very clean malt dominant brew with a slight cold conditioning... I probably should pick it up more often, but it is sorta in my ""Fat Tire"" category.. I used to drink it all the time 6-7 years ago and got burnt out on it... overall, a beer that deserves more respect than I give it."
"An interesting ale indeed. Picked up a single a while ago and couldn't remember how it tastes so I got another one. Due to the lack of a chilled glass I am having this one strait out of the bottle, but even still its a wonderful tasting beer. Maybe a touch overcarbonated, and I agree with another reviewer about this beer, its a nice ale, but nothing that reaches out and tells you its a Rouge Ale."
"Without the unfortunate metallic flavors this would be a quite delicious quencher and fairly sessionable. As it is I probably won't go out of way for this one any time soon."
"Still, if you want to enjoy an ale- here's one to reach for."
"Appearance was a murky brownish orange with no real head and no lacing. Smell took a while to get used to, probably because I am unaccustomed to this particular style of beer. The smell is mainly of caramel and fruit, though I detected some veggies in there. ""Organic"" is a word that comes to mind, though not in the sense that it is used today. It just smells of things found in nature. Taste is very interesting. I haven't had anything quite like it before. Pretty well balanced. Malts, fruits, some vegetables, and yeast. Medium bodied and very carbonated. I've never had anything quite like this before. I must try this and other examples of the style again sometime to get a better grasp of how this one holds up."
"D-first time i have had the beer and i want another. I would like to have a sixer of this for the weekend."
"Poured into standard shaker pint glass. Color was a slightly cloudy reddish brown that has a 2 finger thick head. The head disappaited very quickly but clinged to the side and left a ring around the top. Aroma smelled hoppy with small hints of lemon and spice. Tasted clean, slightly bitter, and also oakey. Mouthfeel was good. Coated well, slightly carbonated. Went down well, and was easy to drink. Alcohol wasn't too strong."
"Always a good go-to beer when nothing else seems to satisfy. I can't belive I hadn't reviewed this sooner..."
"As we all know an english IPA is far different from its American Counterpart. Less hop/citrussy profile and this is what i felt this was comparitive too."
"Great with my local BBQ's pulled pork sandwich and slaw."
"Overall I found the balance to be very appealing. Although, the head was poor and the lacing was almost non-existent. With a stronger nose and lighter carbonation it would improve greatly."
"This one is easy to drink and more enjoyable than expected."
"Pours a golden honey color, nice white head settles fairly quickly. You can definetly smell the malts, and some of the saaz hops at first. Taste is very sweet and malty, with just enough hops to keep it in check. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very sticky on the finish. A very well balanced, solid offering. Definetly worth a try on tap if you can find it, but the bottle is solid."
"I liked this one a lot, but it seems that it would be better on tap."
"Not sure I could drink more than one or two at a time due to the sweetness, but a very good tasting beer."
"A great beer for the beer impaired to be introduced to the good things in life."
"~ I would really love a six pack of these bones after a hard day of mountain biking. Two for me, two for my riding partner, and one for each of us on the ride home. Oops, did I say that? Maybe that's how it got its name?"
"It is very drinkable, and balanced, my only concern is the price- it was a 9.99 six pack at my local store. Personally, i would rather go for a DFH 90min 4pk for the same price- and im sure you could find something in the same style range for a lesser price. Nonetheless, i would try it again."
"Great brew - Try the Russian Imperial Stout, it will blow your mind."
"D: A highly drinkable session beer."
"This a strong ale, that is fairly thick, but goes down smooth. Definitely a drinkable brew from the fine brewers at Rogue."
"My overall impression, was this was just an excellent brew to drink, nothing fancy, but just very well balanced, and what was definitely weird about it, was the flavors seemed to shift as the beer warmed up, becoming a little sweeter, and more malt flavor coming through. Definitely a beer I'd buy again."
"It was smoother than I expected, and easy to drink."
"Note: Definetly a session beer, easy to drink"
"It pours a copper color into my glass with a medium body. The head on top rises nicely and is sturdy. This is a very mellow beer to drink. A little sweet, but then overtaken by soft hops which are floral and tea-like. it's a drinkable brew which I would have never guessed contained a 6.5% ABV."
"The appearance was very nice, with an off amber color. The smell was somewhat above average, never really overwhelming at any point. The mouthfeel was fairly lively and carbonated. I'd never tried a maibock style beer and didn't know what to expect. It had an overly tart, malty taste to it, that didn't really cut it for me. Overall, it's an okay beer, not something to add to a list of favorites."
"Pours a great copper color with excellent head and lacing. Nice malty scent, floral and pleasing, with a good hop balance. Great taste, a nice balance of hops and malts. Well blended flavors with a slight caramel hint. Goes down extremely smoothly. An excellent beer and one of my favorite tap beers, too."
"12 oz bottle. A: Orange/amber, pretty thick carbonation, head that retains to a thin layer pretty quickly. S: Pretty malty, some citrusy hops in there. T: Muted sweetness up front followed by some watery citrus and lingering bitter hops. Some caramel in there, too. M: Nice thick character, maybe a tad thin. D: I've been drinking this for a while now, this is the first time that I've actually ventured to review it. It was one of the first truly good beers that I recognized as a young drinker, and I'm sure I'll be sipping on it for years to come. Great balance, nice crisp character. Excellent drinking beer."
"Drinkability- Ive had this brew many times. Im assuming the Anniversary is the same as the Dead Guy but for some reason this seems a bit more fruity (probably just in my head). Its a solid brew that is good every time, anytime. On a side note, when I make chili I use either a bomber of Dead Guy Ale or Chipotle Ale every time. Great beer for cooking."
"Poured into a tapered glass. thick head of foam that settles into a creamy lace. Dark honey like color, and sweet smelling. Not very hoppy right off that the bat, but has a nice little bite at the end. Very drinkable and smooth. This is both a great sipping and session beer. At about 10 bucks a six pack, you wouldn't want to just guzzle this stuff down. Great stuff!"
"D - Not bad at all, I would accept one of these anytime. I'm new to the style but this was a very drinkable brew. So it seems I'm 2 for 2 as both the Maibocks I've had have been very tasty. Try this one out."
"This the first Rogue beer that I ever tasted and the one that sparked my movement away from light Macro Brews and into the good stuff. I had not had it since and just got into reviewing, but now I remember why the movement began. This is a great beer that should be stocked in every fridge at all times."
"Rich and creamy tasting, somewhat sweet as well. Slightly dry, with a roasted burnt malt taste. Long lingering aftertaste. Heavy in the mouth, a little to much for a considered ale. I did enjoy this beer, I was hoping to rate it better, but I will try it again."
"No problems with drinkability, as I could drink this all night long. It's the third time I've used the word, but the key here is balance. It just makes me proud to be an American!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, copper-orange color with a pillowy, one-finger, off-white colored head. The smell is slightly sweet with slightly toasted notes coming to the forefront, also a slight hop presence. The taste also has the sweetness of the nose but is better balanced with a definite earthy hoppiness and slight alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy carbonation that makes for easy drinking. Drinkability of this one is pretty high, easy to drink and pretty tasty too."
"Won't knock your socks off, but its pretty solid."
"Decent to above average. Nothing special, but will do the trick if nothing else is available."
"D - This is a good ale pretty easy to drink I think I could drink this all night could be a session beer"
"It is surprisingly drinkable, very nice. Would make a good session ale, although it is 6.5%... Very drinkable brew."
"Poured out of the 64 ounce growler. (the glow in the dark one) Color is a cloudy amber with a one finger head with some lacing. Nose is sweet with a berry tone. Flavor is somewhat sweet with a bitter edge on the tail. Mouth is smooth and a little bit heavy, with a slight bit of bubble that clings to your mouth. Extremely drinkable due to its smooth tone and flavor. Excellent brew - better than I remember. (maybe its the growler as opposed to the bottle)"
"Amber reddish body with off white head. Strong malty aroma with slight spicy slightly citrus note. Good malty flavor but not too sweet. There is a spice in there that I can't quite put my finger on. Good medium body and good drinkability. Extra points because I can (and have) drink this beer all day long."
"Can easily be a session beer as the 6.5% is well hidden and is not a heavy beer."
"Wow... the first brew I've ever had from the Rogue company, and I'm completely head-over-heels with this beer! Definitely a terrific drink in my opinon... The appearance is wonderful... pours an amber and slightly copper color with a nice head that foams for a while before dissapating... The smell is awesome....full of bready caramel notes... The taste is what truly makes this beer above and beyond... it is so rich and thick that it makes some other brews I've tried taste like water... the flavor is full of caramel, vanilla, and has a nice, sweet aftertaste that lingers on the palate... ""rich"" is how I'd best describe the tate... Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is near-perfect, goes down smooth and clean without the slightest bitterness present... Copped this beer singly for about $1.99 and will definitely pay the $10 plus for a six-pack... Eager to try other samples from this brewery... Definitely recommended..."
"Feels milky and thick. Smooth like a hefeweizen. Buttery and leaves a watery film. Strong but really drinkable. Nuanced and flavorful, especially considering that it's so strong."
"Pours a nice amber with a beautiful head that fades to a cap and leaves some okay lacing. Smells of sweet malt, snickerdoodle cookies, and orange and lemon zest. A touch of bitterness on the back. taste is fairly balanced between dry malt and light, slightly citrusy hops. It's well made, but just a tad bland and with a slightly flat finish. Nice bitter hops right at the end. A little light in the mouth and slightly watery, but a well-made easy-drinking beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer plays quite well on the mouth with enough hops to keep a clean palate. Carbonation is there, but doesn't distract. However, it is a strong, full beer that is best rounding out a meal or having one or two during a ballgame. Not a great session beer."
"Great brew - it pushes limits and adds to the meaning of a bock. This is possibly my favorite of Rogue's beers!"
"First time I had Dead Guy, trying it on tap at a local pizzeria. Not bad, but didn't blow me away. It presents itself nicely, with two fingers of head atop an amber-copper body in a pint glass. The nose was malty, and I detected a hint of chocolate, but little else appeared. The taste was subtle but smooth. But I was disappointed since the malt was clear, and some spice was present--ginger, paprika--but little else. I was hoping for bolder flavors, but was left wanting. The texture was smooth, and ordering a second sure wasn't difficult. Overall, worth a try and a nice brew, but nothing that will knock the socks off."
"this beer has been reviewed so many times, what more can you say? all i have to add is the fact that i was surprised at how good it actually was on tap. i think that it must not age well or something in the bottle because i never noticed the great malty, caramelly character that i noticed on the fresh keg offering i had tonight. wow... i was impressed. i'll definitely have it again."
"Not bad at all!"
"A very tasty and enjoyable brew...I'll be back for more."
"Had in its bottle at Moan and Dove. The drink poured with an orange-like amber to it with a very thin head. Faint hops and malts could be smelt from the beverage. A sweet, citrus-like taste enveloped your mouth when sipping the drink. Its carbonation was great: incredibly crisp and refreshing. With the citrus tastes and carbonation, this is a sure winner from Rogue Ales. Definitely one of their best."
"D-this beer has similar characteristics of a Sam Adams BL as far as drinkability but this is much more complex,and superior in every imaginable way!"
"D = Great beer to just sit back and enjoy; a good all around beer."
"The bottle gushed on opening with amber colour and vigourous carbonation. Solid beige, off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smells hoppy but with a lot of caramel roasted malt too, the smell is apparent even before pouring. The taste is similarly two dimensional: hops and caramel-roast taffy. There is a smooth, buttery mouthfeel. This is a nice drinking ale with a nice, even keel ... the hoppy bitterness is balanced perfectly with malt, a real taste treat and another winner from Rogue."
"EDIT: Tried the growler version of this (found on a shelf- no clue how old it could be) but seemed to have less hop presence, more malts, more honey, and more light fruits (apples, peaches, concord grapes). The carbonation was very low. I am assuming that the growler had been sitting there for months, but it still tasted excellent in its own way."
"Nice job!"
"Delighted to find this offering from our favourite Oregon on offer at the local. It's not in our favourite IPA category, but it is a great all-round beer nonetheless. Coppery-red colour with a slight haze and a moderate head. Aroma is fairly muted but the palate glows with complex fruit and malt and caramel. It's a bit chewy and very quaffable, although I note a fairly robust 6.5 % alcohol level."
"The taste is delicious. Again, bottles don't really compare to a good Dead Guy on-tap (IMO). It practically bursts with notes of fruit and caramel malts, and a bit of creamy vanilla/butterscotch too. The finale is predominantly hop territory, as the flavor ends with a bitter, resinous bite. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied, semi-creamy but crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is nearly perfect. It's complex, flavorful, and almost too easy to put away a few in one sitting. Hooray for Dead Guy, my faith is renewed!"
"A drinkable beer but not one I would buy again. This is my first beer within this style so I may just not like the style! Try it for yourself."
"a very good (local for me) beer. I would recommend you try this if you like pale ales and the taste of hops."
"This is a great beer. One of the best American crafts I've had."
"Great brew love Rogue but need to get a bottle and make a new review to make sure appearance and mouthfeel are accurate."
"I know when I buy growlers from other breweries they say the carbonation should last about 10 days, there is no bottling date and the carbonation seemed fine, so I grabbed it at a good time or there is something in the bottling process."
"Final Note: I've made this a tradition for the past 3 years to drink this beer on 'Day of the Dead' but I may start drinking it on other days of the year as well. Dead Guy is another fine brew from Rogue."
"Final thoughts  All I can say is awesome. Complex and well balanced make drinking this brew a great experience."
"a nice little brew which reminds me of the good life in good-beer-starved china..."
"D: Highly drinkable. I wouldn't mind taking down a six pack on a sunday afternoon. However, not one to waste; savor it, while not sparing it."
"I'm sorry to keep refering BMCs, but I really think this growler thing is responsible for the lacking in taste, smell, and mouthfeel. I've had this brew from the tap and I was much more impressed. Leave the growlers for the brewpubs, man."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a nice amber color with a 3/4 inch white head. There was a sweet smell to this, very fruity with hints of spice. A little citrus, maybe orange or grapefruit and a mild cinnamon hint. Tastes smooth with little carbonation, very full of the fruitiness you smell. Subtle hints of spice. This is a lighter body brew, but very refreshing. Very solid ale."
"D: Overall a very drinkable beer. It's delicious!"
"d - excellent and easily quaffed. complex and one i'll easily go to again."
"A very drinkable beer, although due to the hops and strong flavor I recommend stopping at just a few."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey color with a thin white head that never quite goes away. A small cloudy dribble from the end of the bottle suggests this was bottle conditioned, but there's nothing on the bottle to warn one about this. You may want to pour gently and slowly so you don't get any carryover. Lacing is minimal. A nice malt aroma that translates into a noticable but not cloying sweet malt presence in the flavor that is balanced by spicy hop bitterness that dries out the aftertaste. A well-built beer that is certainly quite sessionable. I had it on tap at the Finley Grill in Downers Grove, IL, and was more impressed there than with this bottle, but did not get to reviewing it in time for my memory to serve me well."
"D: I wasn't aware of the ABV until I saw it here. Without that knowledge I could imagine drinking more of these than I could handle in a night. Goes down nice and smooth."
"Poured out of 22 iz bottle, into a standard pint glass. Appeared a cloudy, golden copper color. Aroma was pleasant, but not exciting. Taste was malty, mild, again, very pleasant, but nothing exciting. This is a very good beer, I don't think it is great, but I will ceritanly buy it again, and would recommened to anyone. It is an easy, drinkable beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass with a white, foamy head that dissipated quickly; little lacing remained during the serving. Presented with a hazy copper color and a mild, hoppy aroma. Taste of malt and hops with a slightly astringent/citrus finish. Very pleasant and drinkable with a smooth mouthfeel."
"Poured a murky orange brown with a medium sized off-white head. Nice malty aroma with sweet citrus notes. There is a juicy malt quality as well as an earthy vibe to it. A bit dry but the hops and malt are very well balanced. The finish is sweet and slightly bitter. A really good brew, with a great mouthfeel and plenty of drinkability."
"Comment: Two summers ago when on a long camping trip in Southern Oregon and Northern California Dead Guy was the beer of choice in my cooler. I find it to be a easy session drink and highly tolerant of non-ideal handling."
"Had this beer on tap tonight with dinner. It came from the bar a nice cloudy brown with a faint cream head on top. The beer had a really good smell with hops and malt that isn't too strong. Has a nice crisp taste with a dry bite at the end. Went very well with my dinner and look forward to trying again. (dead guy)"
"The taste is sweet malt and just a hint of hop on finish to aid in the finish. Finishes crisp and clean. It is well balanced for what it is but it definately is not a big beer. Nicely done being medium bodied and carbonation. A well manufactured brew and it goes down easily."
"D: Very easy to drink. I prefer bigger beers normally, but this is one that I could easily drink a lot of when I'm in the mood for mass consumption."
"The alcohol isn't very noticeable, but you can get a sense of how it is a toned down bock. It provides a nice taste, again I feel like there is a hint of apple. Some hops are noticeable, but it seems fairly reserved. Anyway feels nice to drink, not much aftertaste, nice clean finish. Easy to drink beer that keeps you respectable. I'm a big fan of the brewery, this isn't their best, but the bar was set very high long ago."
"O: A staple for me when I get a healthy sized hamburger at one of my favorite spots."
"D: This beer goes down good. I give her a B-"
"Mouthfeel is solid. At no point does it slip into the watery character that some Rogue brews do. Yet it also resists the thickness that such a malt-driven beer can easily take on. Nicely done. I don't love the beer although I could see easily finishing the bomber. Still, I'm not sure how this has become Rogue's flagship (at least in terms of visibility) brew with so many more easily approachable beers on their roster."
"Drinkability- This is a great beer that I decided to revisit. I had this beer when I first turned 21. A long time ago."
"give this beer a try. i bought a case for about 38$"
"I've been going on a Rogue-sampling binge, and maybe one of the four beers I've tried has been to my taste. I appreciate that folks love the Rogue brewery, but at this point I'm beginning to suspect that their offerings are not for me."
"D - Extremely drinkable....I found myself downing it a little too fast and had to slow down...I bought a six and it won't last very long"
"It pours a very nice deep amber color with one finger of white head on it. Sweet malt and floral aromas for the smell. The first sip is very malty and well balance with medium carbination. As the beer warmed I got a good taste of toasted malts and a slight breadiness. Great mouth feel that is light and would be nice on a warm day. Very highly drinkable and a good offering from Rouge."
"Old stand-by, good beer."
"Drinkability: FINALLY!! A Rogue Beer that I enjoy. This is a very drinkable beer that goes down nice and has a good taste"
"D: It drinks easy enough with the lighter body but the higher carbonation , and nothing in the taste department, makes this less than ideal for a good session beer."
"It has a unique mellowness to it as it balanced between the hops and malt. I taste a citrus fruit like a sweet lemon or lime flavor. The ale finishes definitely on the hoppy side as it leaves its trail on the back of you throat. I bought a six pack of this at the beach and it is a nice style to quaff."
"Available in six packs and bombers for those of you wanting to try this"
"D - very easy on the pallet to quaf."
"Not as much head as I'd like (that's what she said). It smells kind of creamy, a strong maltiness with a slight balance of hops that gives it a very slight tinge of floral aroma. It tastes much like it smells -- creamy, slightly toasted malts, with just a fine balance of hops, and it warms excellently, unlike some hop-heavy brews. It tastes good, and feels good enough going down that I know I could drink a lot of it (that's what she said). I'm confused as to why it's called an ale, however, when even Rogue refers to it as a maibock."
"D: This is a really drinkable ale. One of my favorites currently."
"A very pleasing and easy to drink beer, one of my favorites. Dead Guy is a brew to share among friends or just to relax with and enjoy by yourself, great stuff!"
"A honey colored body under a rocky 1F crown of ivory with fair retention. Good lacing with long legs on the side of my snifter. A light nose of caramel-sweet malts with a whiff of pit fruit on a summer breeze. The flavors are a perfect balance between sweet and bitter (for the non-hop head that I am). Earthy with some white grapes, and just the right amount of spice and hop bittering. Ying and yang in liquid form! A fairly light body belies the long legs that continue to coat my glass, and the soft carbonation matches the whole picture to a tee. Hard to believe this is not a European brew, more so that it's a West Coast beer."
"Pours a deep, very reddish amber with a slightly off-white head that fades to a dusting. The aroma has a lot of fruit and potpurri spices too it, as well as some musky hops and amber malts. An ale character suffuses all of this. On the palate, rough fruits and scratchy hops first off, followed by some tea-like malts at the mid-palate. The finish dries out and brings a hoppy bite and some alcoholic burn. Overall, this is quite a nice beer, but it's no Maibock. Very ale-like character, especially in the mouthfeel, which has too many rough edges for a lager. In spite of the lack of stylistic distinction, it's still a beer that drinks well."
"Overall a very good brew with a nice balance. There's something slightly odd about the hops that I can't quite put my finger on, but it isn't bad."
"Overall, quite delicious. This really hits the spot. I need to find some more Rogue brews."
"O'all drinkability - A malt-dominated beer with exceptionally clean character. Could use more hop flavor if an ambert ale, works fairly well as an American Brown."
"Body is medium light to medium. There is a slight buttery quailty that has always been here. It's been a long time, what a great beer. Why do I forget some of these greats?"
"EDIT: (01.30.09) After a year of not having this beer, and after many more beer tastings, with a new refined palette, I can say I have a much greater appreciation for this beer. The honey, sweet caramel malt notes of this brew is amazing! I'd agree that the alcohol is still a bit of a smack in the face, but that sweet flavor is wonderful."
"Wow. Rogue does it again. Gorgeous orange color with thick, foamy tan head. Subtle hops in the nose with a rich malt scent. Taste is almost all malt (foam too) with just a touch of bitterness. Alcohol is in check and with rich flavor and gentle carbonation, this is an absolutely phenomenal beer. Well worth seeking out."
"Wow, a true malt bomb. This Rogue offering poured a fairly opaque brown capped by a creamy foamy head. Moderate carbonation and a fair amount of lace. Aroma is all malt. Caramel and other sweet fruits in the nose as well. Apples are brought to mind. Taste is more malt. Any hops in this brew are buried. The malt taste has layers of vanilla, apples, and yeast. Mouthfeel isn't as thick and chewy as one would expect from a malt bomb. Pleasantly crisp. Extremely drinkable, do so with caution."
"This darker beer comes with testosterone. (not literally) You have to be a real man to dig this stuff or an extreme beer lover. (not to exclude our women beer lovers) I recommend this beer to everyone. If you are someone who wants to get into beer tasting, make ""Dead Guy Ale"" one of your first. If my memory serves me correctly, since it has been a few months since I last had a pint of Dead Guy and I have drank many beers since, Dead Guy is a pretty smooth beer. The real flavor comes in the aftertaste. That is when it hits you and you think, ""this is a great beer""."
"a nice brown color with a good sized head and a decent retention. Smell of malts, caramel. It was a little bit bitter taste nuts and hops. A good mouthfeel not to waterery. A good beer just not to my liking to much clashing between hops and sweet. I would drink another but I wouldn't search it out."
"Overall a great beer. Complex with a great taste, and highly drinkable on top of that."
"This beer is really, really good."
"An orange amber color with big bubbles in a otherwise thin head that settles to a modest lace. The smell is not very perceptable, a very light biscuit. There is a little bite at first taste but then a dry-hopped middle to it. A bitterness that hints at licorice, kind of tangy at the front but not much aftertaste here. Overall, it's good, I would drink any time."
"A very good Ale. Interesting in that it uses a malt recipe for a bock, but uses top-fermenting ale yeast. A little different than your traditional ale, it might not appeal to some. If you want more of a traditional ale, try Rogue American Amber Ale. Smell and taste of caramel hops, a bit of a sweet taste. Poured with small head that didnt last too long. Some hop bitterness."
"D - Delicious, with just enough sedation to prove to be a solid session candidate."
"D- close to the top if not one of the best, you can hardly tell it's 6.5% until you drink 3 and stand up. cannot wait to try more from rogue."
""
"Overall, a good, strong Beer. This is a malty Beer that is higher in alcohol. It does taste like a good Bock, but Bocks are bottom fermented and this Beer is top fermented."
"Drinkability: Good balance between hops and malt. Very drinkable."
"Pours a medium honey color (like gold leaning to copper) and was a touch hazy. Initial head was about one inch. to a film.This drops to a thin layer, but never Sweet in the smell came through like peach with some sweet/sharp orange coming off the hops. Taste gets complex, but orange comes through more than anything else. Hop bitterness is solid, but not huge or overpowering. And the aftertaste is neither too astringent/hoppy or too sweet. Great mix, with most of the hops trailing off leaving a slightly dry orange kicking around. Mouthfeel was at medium body, with a creaminess tempered by carbonation that hits both in front and throughout the taste. While the carbonation might make more than one or two these filling, it's very drinkable. I know it's a bit out of the recommended pairing, but I'd like to try this with non-coconut milk-based curries."
"drinkability: A session beer thats great with meals."
"Hazy copper color with a medium head which recedes quickly and leaves some nice lacing. Slightly sweet malty aroma with some herbal hops. Nice malty flavor with some interesting notes- a bit buttery on my first sip, perhaps some dark fruit. Medium to full bodied and very well carbonated. Pretty good beer. A bit heavier than it seems at first but still quite drinkable."
"Certainly very drinkable, at 6.5%, though due to its substantial flavor, you might not be in a rush to session this. It's a savory beer. Maibock is a style a little out of my comfort zone that I've been appreciating more lately, and this is good stuff by my reckoning"
"it pours a dark orange-amber color with a one/two finger head that sadly dissipates faster than i would want. it smells sweet though fainter again than i would want, but that's ok as the taste is what i like most from this one. a sweet start that moves to a slight bitterness that is welcomed greatly. all in all this is a drinkable beer despite its 6.5% alcohol content. i would welcome this in my fridge any day any time. i look forward to more from Rogue."
"Overall Drinkability: My first Maibock and I definitely wanted another one - too bad I had only purchased one bottle! I can't see having too many in one sitting though as I think the ABV will sneek up on you before you know it. Recommended to all."
"This is my first Maibock, and my first example from Rogue. I'm pretty impressed, and I expect to see more of this in my fridge."
"Tried this on tap for the first time a couple of weeks ago. My first Rogue, and it did not disappoint. Poured clean out of the line, amber in color with a small head. Aroma was of a slight fruitiness, generous use of malts and maybe a note of hops. Taste was just delicious. A well-balanced beer. Robust example of an ale, balanced by malted barley, fruits, spices and a glancing of hops on the tongue. Just a great beer overall and a joy to drink. Wish I had another right now."
"This is one of my new favorite beers. Its taste and smell make it a very pleasurable beer to drink."
"Time for an update! Not all too much has changed, except there's a more distinct toasty, bready malt character. Still sourish, less cidery and more akin to a non-oaked white wine. Slight score bump overall."
"Strait out of the bottle into a pilsner glass this brew has an amazing cloudy orange color with a slightly red tint. A good amount of head that is not quick to dissipate. Upon first sniff i get a sweet hoppy smell. When I dig a a bit deeper a muted fruit scent is detected. It has a very balanced taste: Clean wheat with a delightfully mild bitterness which seems to complement the flavor nicely. The mouthfeel is very smooth all the way through. I hate to use the same descriptor twice but it finishes absolutely cleanly begging you to drink more. All in all this is a highly drinkable beer. I could easily enjoy a few of these on an average night with some good food and great company."
"Pours a bright orange/copper color. Relatively thick head turns thick fast. It smells sweet and malty with definite caramel hints: Far sweeter than it tastes! It has a biscuitty taste that starts slightly sweet and fruity but that finishes a little bit better. Mailbocks aren't my style, but Rogue does this one nicely."
"Very drinkable beer with one of the coolest labels ive seen"
"Overall: Rogue's most well-known beer is also one of their best. If you love heavily malted beers, then Deadguy should have a spot in your fridge."
"almost an orangey gold colour with thick head this beer smells like hops but the taste is more malty than expected. This is a session beer with balance built in but a full flavoured Rogue mouthfeel. I get caramel and some fruit on the finish but mostly a nice hop/malt mix that satisifies"
"For me, this is a great summer beer, not something I would offer to people who are not ""into"" microbrewed beer. I enjoy the after taste and think this beer is great to bring to a BBQ or even with a steak dinner."
"Drinkability: One of the best session beers out there. Extremely quaffable and with a fairly unique character that makes it stand apart from other brews you might commonly find in the Pacific Northwest."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite from Rouge but one of the better brews out there today, very well done."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium-light bodied, with lower levels of carbonation. The spritzy feeling of carbonation nicely melds with the flavor of the malts, which suits this style-in my opinion- quite nicely. Finishes slightly dry. Was a bit lighter in body than I expected. The brew is easy to drink, and goes down smooth. This is something I could be seeing myself buying again, though I'd like to explore other offerings from the same style first."
"This is always a drinkable brew no matter the season or occassion. It's even better on tap. Rogue scores again."
"D: Very drinkable but also complex enough to keep your interest. A must try and a beer I will definitely be picking up again."
"Quite nice, very tasty and drinkable. Damn good I say."
"D: Easy drinking, balanced beer. If nothing else, this is a perfectly balanced beer that might be a little too strong for sessions. Recommended."
"Highly drinkable -- not one that I would think to pair with food, though it would go pretty well with sausages or barbequed chicken. But certainly a good one to sit back with and enjoy."
"Overall this is another good offering from Rogue. However, this one seems to defy convention. At first the taste and drinkability are top-notch, midway through, both seemed to lose a lot. However, as the level in my glass got closer to 0, both picked up again and I could feel myself desiring another. An enigma of a beer. Pick it up and decide for yourself. My rating should be accompanied by a +/- because it is that easy to go back and forth and this one."
"sips or gulps easy enough"
"Bottle and on tap. Pours a nice amber/copper color with a minimal head. Malty and hoppy in aroma and taste with some citrus too. Slight bit of peppery bite in there as well. Leaves a nice hop aftertaste. Bought a case of The Dead Guy at the Brewry while visiting Newport, OR. I have not disliked a single Rogue product."
"Pours a four-finger creamy head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Hoppy nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet/hoppy then a serious hoppy/bitter finish that doesn't really linger. $1.89 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Pours a rich copper apricot color with a nice thick foam head that stays around. Leaves chunks of lace around the glass as the beer recedes. Sweet, malty aroma, with notes of candied sugar and caramel. Some dark fruit scent here as well. Hint of apple and pear too. Sweet tasting brew, again with a caramel appeal. Some pear/apple/strawberry sensation, as well as a sugary, vanilla taste. Tasty, to be sure, although I'd only want to drink this beer fresh. In my opinion, maibocks do not age well. Smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability. Deceptive alcohol content, though, at 6.5% ABV. Another nice brew by the folks at Rogue."
"Bright, gorgeous orange color, and a terrific head. Nose is thick toasty and robust, with some very large citrus notes. Taste is unique as hell. Honey, caramel malt, toffee, and HUGE hop presence. Mouthfeel is substantial, and sticky. Great, great beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and carbonation is perfect. This is a great session beer. The abv may be a little higher than what some would say a session beer should be. But, it's so easy to drink. In my mind, it's a great session beer, as most Rogue brews are. Overall, it's a good, solid beer. Try it."
"One other odd thing I've noticed, is that this is the ONLY Rogue beer I've ever seen that doesn't list all of the ingredients on the label. What is in there that they don't want us beer geeks to know about?"
"D - A very good beer. Not to mention a great label."
"D: as a daily drinker, you would be falling off the chair but one of the best that i have had"
"This goes down fairly easily, and doesn't make me cringe or anything, but it doesn't really make me want another."
"- Bomber pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"Pours with a small head that dissipates quickly, doesn't leave any lace behind. It has a cloudy orangish appearance. It has an odd nose, but I mean that in a good way. It is slightly citrusy/flowery with some malts underneath. The taste is on the bitter side but not overly so, but this probably would not appeal to someone who did not like hops. The malt backbone balances everything nicely and gives a nice creamy mouthfeel. I don't know how representative of the style this is, but I could drink this all day."
"pale golden color, almost could be mistaken for any of the big three in color. decent hop aroma, but the taste is just way to mellow for me. i mean, if the object was to finish as many as possible this might be my choice from rogue, but other than that this was just alright."
"A little on the sweet side, but seemed to be pretty balanced with the hops and malts. Couldn't taste any alcohol and the finish was quite a bit dryer than most ales. Virtually no aftertaste at all."
"If it's not my favorite beer, it's definitly close. Pick it up if you see it and give it a try."
"slightly hazy amber in the glass with small creamy head, aroma has that unique rogue malt combo smell to it, biscuity, doughy, along with some subtle citrus, tropical fruit, and honey notes. taste is a well-balanced interplay of the light/medium sweetness and substantial, moderate hop bitterness. medium mouthfeel and viscosity, soft carbonation, and lightly astringent in the semisweet finish. why don't they paint the labels on these any more? only the bombers now? was glad to find this at a ""normal"" chicago bar."
"A nice after dinner ale."
"Thanks to Scott & Bonnie at Otters Pub in my hometown for putting up this really good Maibock on draught, as it is not seen often in Northern Connecticut. Coppery to lightish amber in color with quickly dissipating head and little lacing. Absent of any real aroma. This one's taste makes up for its absence of aroma. Immediate sweetness on the tongue, but not cloying. No real hop bite, but still a bit drying in the finish--very interesting. The taste is very aggressive, but not extreme. Nice medium to thick mouthfeel. Elevated ABV is well-hidden, but definitely there. I really like this version of the style--good work by Rogue Ales."
"D- It took me over an hour to finish the glass."
"I was expecting a bit more complexity with this ale. The pour was thick and the froth hung around for awhile. The color is your nice, clean amber, typical of the style. The smell is a little hoppy, a bit of wheat also come through. The taste is about the hops from start to finish. I had to drink a good pint to discern enough sweet, caramel maltiness in the middle to appreciate it a bit more. It is a bit more hoppy than I appreciate and definitely has a nice bite at the end, if you go for that sort of thing. It is above 6 ABV but the alcohol flavor is well masked by those darn hops again. Not a bad ale by any means, but just know that you're in for a hoppy ride. L'Chaim"
"I was attracted by the Rogue reputation and was by no means let down. At first glance i fell in love with the rich amber color. The bock characteristics show in this brew with a malty aroma and flavor. Hops really came to place with an average bitter kick. I liked it."
"As this is the first beer I am reviewing in the style, I must say it was a very good start. Pours a beautifully semi-transparent copper, this brew is nicely balanced and easily drinkable. This absolutely makes me want to try more from Rogue, who I've known previously only from their stellar reputation. I would definitely like to try this again."
"Drinkability: This is a drinkable beer in comparison to other Maibocks."
"This beer pours almost a copper/red-brown color with a light tan almost white head. The appearance for me is exactly as an ale should look, makes my mouth water. The smell is sweet with some hop in there as well as malts. its hard to seperate, but a plesant sensation regardless. The taste is where this ale really shines. Its very smooth with a little sweetness mixed with hop bitterness. None of which over powers, and the way they balance out is great. It has a smooth medium body that is not heavy at all and makes this drink more robust but still very drinkable. very good al, highly suggest trying."
"This was a very enjoyable brew. Not what i consider a session beer , but a very enjoyable beer."
"very similar to it's bottled counterpart, the main difference being the mouthfeel, which takes on an almost Guinness-like thickness. maybe a little bit sweeter, a little bit stickier, but all of the same flavors of bread, fruits, honey and spices are present."
"reddish-orange with slight chill-haze with a thick, melted-vanilla-ice-cream head. smells fruity, a bit like vegetables (cucumber?), caramel-sweetness, and booze. taste is much the same, but with added spice and berries. mouthfeel is good, medium bodied with fine carbonation - crisp at first, then quite smooth and creamy in the finish. quite drinkable, as i once polished off a growler of this stuff with little to no help."
"Taste is certainly pleasant, a nice mix of mellow buttery sweetness and some more herbal hop flavours. Anise, lemon, earth, tart apples, and some more medicinal bitter flavours that aren't unpleasant but are definitely there. Mouthfeel is rather thick and malty, but dries well and sticks to the throat. Alcohol is a bit more evident than expected, and carbonation might be a bit better if it was toned down just a little. That said, this beer is very drinkable and I'm really enjoying it tonight, it's the kind of thing I can really go for late in the year, it just screams ""Autumn"". Didn't blow my head off, but sessionable. Well done Rogue."
"This one of the first craft beers I ever had and had been one of my favorites long before I realized just how vast the world of craft beer really was. The beer was served with a thin off white head that diminished into a ring but still left good lacing on the glass. The aroma was heavy on the malt with a mild amount of earthy hops behind it. The taste was heavy on the malt as any maibock should be, but this being brewed as an ale, the earthy hops shine through a lot more than they do in any other beer of this style. The beer is not heavy at all and is very enjoyable. I will always consider this a great session beer, even though it is 6.5%."
"You guys get a 3.5 for this stuff -- and hey; STOP MESSING WITH MY HEAD!"
"Overall, an easily drinkable beer with a very distinct flavor."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazy, golden amber color, reminds me of honey, with a finger of of white foam that quickly fades. Smells of sweet fruit and malt, as well as some alcohol. Tastes of sweet caramel, crisp, tart apple notes, and bitter, lemony hops. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. An overall consistent offering from Rouge that I revisit a few times a year."
"I realize my review sounds negative but I was trying to find flaws in one of my favorite brews. As for the positive aspects of it.. well let me just say ""It's delicious."""
"I think this is a nice beer and worthy of trying, but it's a bit too strong in the carbonation department for me to really enjoy, and the taste (while generally nice) doeesn't correspond to my personal liking."
"D- sessionable, good flavor, like rogues twist on this style, very enjoyable, recommended"
"Overall: Although I want to, I have a hard time really liking this beer. Each characteristic tends to stand alone  the experience is not very well integrated."
"D: It's a great beer with a lot of wonderful flavors. The best part is that no one flavor really silences the rest making it a very drinkable beer."
"Overall a very good brew. Think of a pale ale with a good light-malt background. I'll have to keep a sixer of this around."
"Good stuff, seriously easy drinking with enough character to keep you coming back."
"D- This took me quite a bit of time to consume considering the low ABV. This was a very interesting brew."
"This is not even close gto my favorite Rogue ale but is solid nonetheless and a must-have with Thai food..."
"D: Awesome. All the elements combined made this beer insanely drinkable with incredible flavors being bounced around. Can't wait to buy a growler this weekend and really go to town"
"-Oelergud"
"Bottled. I drank a bit of this a few years ago but have not had any recently until this week. Just poured a bottle. Pours and smells a basic Pale Ale. Flavor seems slightly more malt directed than others. It is good and refreshing. Not a favorite but not crap either."
"Still all in all, this is a good session beer. I will be drinking all 6 of these bad boys."
"Downright drinkable and splendid taste"
"Dead Guy does pretty good all the way around. Gives of a lot of CO2 for a good light tan head and retains very well. Medium bodied with a dark golden amber hue. Gives off aromas of grapes, molasses, and a weird coppery aroma like pennies. This tastes very sweet and malty. There's a dominant molasses flavor here, too. This ale feels very warm and inviting with each sip. I feel more alive than dead while drinking this concoction."
"Dead Guy is so strong that it was kind of hard to drink. But overall it is a very unique and interesting taste."
"This is an easy to drink beer, very smooth and the different flavors blend nicely."
"If you've never had this... GET IT"
"I think y'all know what this beer is about. I lucked into a sale at 7.99/6 at the Lowes in Calabash, NC on 1/29/07.They also had the Red and the Amber on sale as well. Anyway, awesome malty flavor with a strong hoppy kick at the end...this batch was in 6 pack form...no dates whatsoever on the packaging so I have no idea of the actual production date. The last time I found this was in bomber form in Cloudcroft, NM a coupla yrs ago...I turned some of my bud lite friends onto this and they loved it...so if you have it at yr local groc get it...kill if you must...Have a nice day!!!"
"Better than I remember."
"Poured into a mug as dark copper with a nice puffy white head. Laced the glass very nicely. Smell is slightly fruity, nothing special though. Tastes light almost sweet but with a good brew appeal. The sweetness lasts through with the aftertaste but has enough kick to enjoy. I like it, a good Rogue product."
"A lot milder than I had anticipated. I was expecting more of a kick in the pants, but I found this beer to be more of a pat on the butt. My novice palate ignorantly compares it to an India Pale Ale, but the flavor profile seemed a bit more refined than your typical IPA. Subtle notes of clove, apricot, and honey. Slightly peppery as well. I would try this again for sure, perhaps by a different brewer for comparison. Watch the high ABV.. this brew is so smooth, it can creep up on you fast."
"Very drinkable."
"This hybrid bock brewed w/ ale yeast is intersting and a damn-good beer as far as drinkability is concerned. Fruity, sweet, and balanced hop profile makes for a great beer. A regular in my fridge."
"Pours copper with orange tones and flecks of gold and red. Small yellow-white head with light-medium lacing; dies down quickly. Aroma of bubblegum, banana, and apple with floral undertones; hints of spices here and there. Light-medium body. Initial flavor is a mixture of rich and spicy (though mild) noble hops and sweet flowery, cake and cookie-dough malts, punctuated by a subtle undertone of sour lemon-lime citrus. Followed by toasty, buttery malts underlined by mild floral and dark fruit flavors. Hops linger. Bready, somewhat spicy finish and aftertaste."
"D-The malts overwhelm for me cutting down on drinkability"
"All in all, a good drinking beer."
"D: Very good. If it weren't for my ALDH deficiency, I could see myself drinking a few of these."
"All in all, this is a really tastey brew that would be lovely to session. I'll be picking up more for sure."
"Notes: I'll fess up -- I don't know much about this style and what exactly this beer should be. But I've had it on tap and in the bottle and always liked it. Another solid offering from Rogue."
"My first Rogue. And my first Maibock. Hazy deep amber color. Sweet malt aroma. white head disapates completely. Initially thought that this was very malty and that I wouldn't want any more maltiness...but realized that there was enough hop to balance it all out. It was suprisingly good and actually refreshing even throughout the temperature change. I will definitely be looking forward to having this again."
"The taste is very malty, with strong notes of caramel and honey. There is a slightly bitter finish due to the hops. The beer is balanced, but leaning toward the malty side. Mouthfeel is medium, and creamy. This is a fairly drinkable beer, if a bit on the heavy side. Overall this lager is a nice, solid brew, but nothing exceptional in my opinion."
"note: disregard the placement of the pts.in the score"
"All I could say was, ""hmmm... this is good... this... is... (burp)... good."""
"D - Not my favorite Rogue but it's not a bad beer."
"This ale pours a nice orange-amber with a white head with little retention. It smells sweet, with roasted mail notes and a bit of bread. I thought I picked up a bit of honey too. Very nice. The taste is excellent. Sweet and a bit floral with a nice sour finish. Very rich, with a nice thin mouthfeel. Very drinkable!"
"even though i prefer stouts..i like IPA and ales too....this one ranks pretty well to me."
"The head dissapears and leaves no lacing while the smell is a little old and dank. You can smell an slight aromatic lager with a slight clove smell to it. The taste isn't very smooth, but this seems to be an old bottle. The taste has an aftertaste that's a little off putting and a little sour. The mouthfeel doesn't seem to be bad or good. Overall I will check to see if the next six pack I buy is old or not because this would seemingly be great when it's fresh. I will try it again."
"Pours out a deep garnet with a slightly off-white head that thins out. However, once thinned, it maintains its size and shape. Smells sweet, nutty, and bready with a whiff of floral and tea-like hops. There's a hint of jasmine in there as well. The rich maltiness is present in the flavor, but is then pushed out by a sturdy hoppiness: floral notes and a good bit of bitterness. I get a slight buttery taste in the aftertaste as well. Body is slightly light, a bit light for what I expected, but the carbonation is solid. Extremely drinkable, despite the alcohol."
"Foggy orange color with no head at all. The smell on this kind of reminded me of baby food. i am not sure about you but that is not something i want to sit back and enjoy. Taste was a bitter lemon, it was ok but was a little too bitter at times. Mouthfeel was thick and felt good but the bitterness is too overwhelming at times. The drinkability for me is low, but if you are a fan of bitter beers i would recomend it."
"Drinkability - this is a good beer, it's hearty and satisfying, and it's quite sessionable."
"This is an all around good beer. Refreshing, light and tasty. Buy a half-gallon of this beer and share it with a close friend... you will not be disappointed!"
"pours dark honey cloudy color a two finger light tan head with a fair lacing. smell is fruity, coffee, bready. lots of toasted malt up front slightly fruity slightly bready sweet taste with a nice hop finish. mouthfeel is medium but not syrupy with nice medium carbonation. really enjoyed this one great tasting beer hope to get some more soon."
"Smells slightly metallic, some mild spice, light on the hops, not to much going on here malt wise, honestly rather boring. The taste a bit better although not by much, a very mellow flavor. Its not very dynamic or interesting, but drinkable non the less. I feel like this would be loads better on tap, but as it is I can say with assuredness I will never buy this (good thing I didnt in the first place). This is not a bad beer, it just nothing special, maybe with a greater understanding of the style I might enjoy this more, but until that day Ill stay way."
"Not sure if I got an old bottle, but I'd prefer Summit's Maibock any day of the week over this one."
"Overall Impression: This was one of the first micro beer bottles I have ever seen back in 1996 in the party store. Someone said don't try that beer it's disgusting, so I didn't. 10 years later I'm sampling it on my web site, who knew. A delicious Maibock, I would call it. A session beer to boot! Very clean, refreshing and delicate. If you don't like the hop flavor or hop bitterness even just a bit, stick to those American or Premium Lagers."
"cheers!"
"Drinkability/ Overall- Very drinkable, but I tend towards bigger flavors nowadays. However, it is a very well balanced beer and I would happily drink another."
"This brew poured a perfect amber pint with good head and some sticky lace. Great sweet malt aromas with a hint of hoppy spice. The flavor is great- big malt flavor, creamy and complex with a perfectly tasty and exotic hop profile- very nice. Smooth as silk in the mouth and the alcohol is hidden very well. After sampling this offering i'll be back for more from Rogue."
"Murky dark amber body with two fingers of offwhite head that leaves a fair bit of lacing. Smells of caramel malt more than anything. Tastes malty, nutty, caramel... The flavor has a malted milk like quality to it... On the heavy side of medium-bodied. A rather good tasty brew. Not as complex as it could be. Not a ""wow"" beer... Not sure what it is about this brew that keeps bringing me back to it, but it's a good beer, and pretty much the only Rogue ale I can find easiy around here."
"D - Like all good maibocks, you can put a few of these down."
"Eric"
"A bit too highly carbonated for my tastes, and not very drinkable. I split the bomber with a friend and probably wouldn't want to finish a whole one. Maybe it's the style? I'll have to try some other examples. I probably wouldn't buy this beer again, but it's worth a try."
"Taste, Mouthfeel, Drinkability: I could definetly enjoy this one as a daily brew and have enjoyed six-pack after six-pack over the years....always a good call"
"This is a good drinkable beer. I'm really not familiar with the style so I can't really review it within the style."
"I know the dead skeleton on the bottom is for Mays day of the dead. But I love this beer in the winter. I thought the graphic depicted exactly this the first time I had this beer, the skeleton with its arms crossed sure looks like it is freezing on top of a nice barrel of dead guy to help sustain sanity through a bone chilling night. Plus the colors in the background look like the Northern Lights, and youre gonna be cold if you see those. if not hallucinatory"
"Pours a deep hazy golden color with modest head. Nice malty smell. Taste is soo good. Nicely sweet and mildly bitter. So smooth in the mouth with a complex and totally enjoyable taste. I've had this before in bottles, seeing the growler with the Dead Guy logo was too much to resist. Superbly drinkable, my daughter and I polished off the growler, with my hungover son-in-law declining. Too bad it was a bad day for the Eagles."
"I wasn't sold on the flavor, but the drinkability on top of this flavor is what saves this beer and makes it memorable."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with zippy carbonation. Smooth. Not my favorite style but pleasant."
"for someone who loves malts and the complexities of malts this is your beer little hops but great to try if that is preference i recommend"
"This beer is very drinkable nice and balanced. Great choice!"
"The mouth is medium bodied, is decently carbonated, though not all that complex. It is very drinkable, especially out of the bottle. Often on tap due to varying amounts of carbonation in draft lines it becomes too syrupy. It's an easy drinking tasty ale, even if not the most complex brew."
"Pours a dark coppery color with a head that doesn't last long. It has a fruity/floral aroma. It tastes almost like an IPA but not as strong. It has more hop bitterness than malt sweetness. It tastes good enough that I want to drink a few. Goes down pretty smoothly; there is a little carbonation on the tongue. Not the best I've had, not one that I'll buy all the time, but it's better than a lot of beers out there and I will buy some again sometime."
"12 oz. bottle. I am not sure how I missed reviewing this, but anyway.. Pours a cloudy copper/honey color. Off white fluffy head disappears rather quickly. Nice bready, spicy aroma. Bready malt flavor, a bit of caramel, some sweetness complimented by floral hops. Very smooth. A little yeasty at the end. Malt is the showcase here. Some spices as it warms. Very drinkable, but not as clean as I would think for the style. Enjoyable."
"It pours a very dark orange to brown with a decent amount of head that disappears pretty quickly, but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is fruity, sweet and bitter, yet VERY alcohol-y. As for the taste, it retains that bitter and sweet taste, however doesn't quite taste as alcohol-soaked as it smells. But it wasn't anything that made me say ""that's delicious"" (like a lot of other Rogue beers have done for me). With a mouthful that's neither thin nor thick, I don't think many people would have a hard time drinking many of these, unless you breathe in too deeply the alcohol scent as you sip. For me, it tended to really lower the quality of the beer."
"This is a good beer, served it at my halloween party and was very well accepted. This was out of a bottle, into a pint glass, on tap locally had a bit more of a kick, but overall recommended. Found myself drinking one of these almost every other day lately. Good Brew/"
"This poured a hazy orange/red with a thick head that left very nice lacing. Sweet smell of malts and a biscuity aroma. A very nice taste of fruits, hops, with the biscuity flavoring coming into the background. Complex, yet smooth and refreshing. Exceptional. A good, well balanced mouthfeel that goes down smoothly. Incredibly drinkable, you will definitely want more. An exceptional beer."
"Pours a cloudy orangish yellow color with a finger and a half off-white head that leaves some decent lacing. Smells of malt and a little fruit, honey, and caramel. Taste is of malty sweetness initially with a little kick of hops at the end. Sort of an iced tea like after taste. Mouthfeel is fine and drinkablity is pretty good. Pretty solid brew."
"Poured this from a 12 oz. bottle. Dark orange-red color, light head. I'm not getting too much aroma. Flavors are subtle. This is a fairly sweet beer, which I'm usually not that fond of, but this one is pretty damn good. I could definitely have this as a semi-regular beer."
"Poored from the bottle with weak head that quickly ran away. The color was murky, orange- almost looks like an unfiltered homebrew. Smell is hoppy, not what I would expect here. The taste is nearly horrible. Very bitter with very little trace of malt. The aftertaste is putrid, almost vomit-like sitting on the back of the throat. This was very disappointing."
"22oz bomber poured in a pilsener. Hazy copper-orange color, with a frothy white head that quickly fades. Faint smell of malt. Taste is interesting; malty, a little sweet, but finishes up with a little hoppiness. Carbonation seemed to disappear a little too quickly. Smooth mouthfeel with little aftertaste."
"Head was a little underdone on this brew. The color was fine, though, sort of orange-golden, and it was rather clear. The aroma was nice, features gold robust malt, manifesting as a ripe graininess along with softer caramel notes as a compliment. Not much hops detectable to me, and I also don't get a lot of fruitiness which is a little odd because I seem to recall getting more fruitiness from past samples. Nevertheless I don't smell them now so let's continue. The flavor is strongly malty at the start, and has some nice bitterness for balance, but there is also some higher alcohol notes that do not seem to blend or compliment the other characteristics well - its seems rougher rather than smoother. This is somewhat detracting, and I don't knmow if its more of a flavor or a mouthfeel ""issue"" so I'll hit it a little in both. Overall this is a decent beer, but for a maibock I think I'd like a more malty / smoother delivery. If indeed, however, its not a maibock, I'd still have to ding it a little for (lack of) smoothness."
"Overall a very good beer. A great choice to go with a nice pork roast dinner. Another great offering from a very good brewery. Pick it up and enjoy it yourself."
"Overall, the smell alone makes this a must try. A bit aggressive on the palate for some, but eccentrically balanced and stands out beautifully."
"This beer settled down a bit as it warmed but it was still quite tough to drink."
"One of the best pints I've ever enjoyed was a Dead Guy Ale, extremely fresh off tap at the San Fransisco Rogue Brewpub. It was so malty and yet so hoppy. It was Halloween and my flight had just arrived in earlier that day. We watched as the kids trick-or-treated and the bartenders gave them candy. It is a wonderful memory that was made especially extraordinary in thanks to the wonderful beer itself."
"D: Always a solid choice. Very drinkable. Crisp, pleasantly balanced between hops and malt. A recommended beer."
"D - This is a good beer - it has a nice roasted taste with a bit of sweetness to it. It feels very mellow on the tongue, but is still a bit filling. Is fine as a session beer, but I prefer to have this with some food."
"Brew pours to a cloudy copper color with a nice sized light tan head, which had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side off the glass. The aroma was mostly of sweet malt and possibly fruit? The taste is defiantly malt, which leads to a toasted flavor. There is a noticeable hop presence that is noticeable but not as robust as the maltyness. This is a good beer, not a favorite but defiantly a solid choice. If available I will always think about getting one."
"The classic Dead Guy bomber. Pours a hazy ruby-amber with off-white head. Smells of sweet, fruity amber malts. Tastes of caramel malts with a bit of esters and little bitterness at the end. A very well-balanced beer, although the mouthfeel is just a little hot at times. Very drinkable, give me a keg."
"A solid beer. I just had it from the Wild Onion in Wayne, PA, on-tap. It had a nice color, yet not that much smell. There was not much head and and a touch of lace. The head had low retention. The taste, was bitter and not over powering. Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: Dead Guy Ale is very drinkable. A nice malty marzen with plenty of caramel, brown sugar and fruitiness in the flavor profile along with a slight nuttiness. Hops are subtle but do make an appearance in the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden. A good session beer with plenty of flavor that won't wear out the palette. Overall a nice beer with very good drinkability. Recommended."
"DA: This one wasn't as great as the first time I had it....but still easily drinkable."
"Taste was another matter. the first taste was sweetish, there was a rather complex combination a flavors in the mid-palate, and the finish was dry (and good). The brew has malt sweetness balanced with indistinct hop bitterness, some flavor notes of grass and maybe a touch of lime. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with some malt-stickiness. All in all the drinkability was good, which is nice because I've got a six-pack of it to sample. I'm glad to have tried the draft version, will go back to it any when the chance arises."
"Pours with a nice orange color. Creamy white head that dissipates leaving a bit of lacing. Smells of hops and fruit. Taste wonderful. Hints of fruit, nice strong hop flavor, nice bread taste as well, a bit of alcohol burn. Mouth feel is oily and nicely carbonated. Great beer, nicely priced, very drinkable."
"D: Definitely enjoyable offering. I'd have a few back-to-back for its balanced complexity of taste."
"Poured a Rouge Dead Guy Ale into my tasting glass. It has a very orange color with nice creamy head that turns into lacing after about 10 seconds. The nose slightly hoppy as with the taste. I could drink a few in a session. I am not overy impressed, but it is a pretty good beer."
"this is a good standby beer, and would make a great session in an oregon taproom overlooking the pacific and some big m-f'ing redwoods."
"This beer is definately on the short list of what to keep on hand!"
"Pours a slightly hazy deep amber color with a minimal head. Mellow, malty aroma is very inviting and appealing. Big malty taste with a subtle, spicy hoppiness lingers on the palate for some length. Creamy mouthfeel makes this a very pleasant beer to relax with for a bit."
" Wavz"
"I poured this 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug and a shocked by the nearly pumpkin hue that the brew has. Little to no head with slight patches of lacing. Both in smell and taste a bit citrusy, orange to it. Slight bitterness with a great mouthfeel that really makes it a pleasure to drink. Just the right amount of carbonation to really make the beer soft on the pallate. Great beer."
"drinkability is great too. really enjoying this one and looking forward to more."
"D - Not what I'd call a refreshing beer, although the hoppiness helps a bit in that regard. A heavy boozy drink, but with some complexity."
"A very slight alcoholic taste for a 6.5% beer.Overall a good beer."
"The smell is nice and sweet which fits in well with the slightly fruity taste. The mouthful is nice and creamy. The drinkability is very smooth and refreshing. This is one of my all time favorite beers. I find myself going back to this one quite a bit."
"Drinkability-- very much so, ongoing."
"A greatly crafted brew. Anywhere I go and they have it on draft, I get it. But it is dangerous on draft. You won't realize how much you had until you look (hazily I might add) at your bill. Be careful with this one."
"This one has grown on me over the years. While I don't think it's particularly complex, it is quite delicious and a beer I keep on hand frequently. Overall a fine brew, another classic from the folks at Rogue."
"Good stuff, Glad to see some quality brews available here for a change."
"Pours a gorgeous orange brown. The head is a creamy white and leaves a lacing against the glass on each consecutive sip. Theres a hint of some sort of exotic fruit in the drink as well as a bit of spices. The taste is crisp although not lacking in any sort of complexity. The carbonation is light to moderate and is fairly smooth. Drinkability is outstanding"
"D - I could drink a whole 6 pack easily. The only thing holding me back is the abv. At 6.5% its a little strong for a session beer."
"D: This is odd. It's labeled an ale, yet pretty clearly is not an ale. It's a pretty big, flavorful lager, though, so the ale/lager categories don't really matter much. It's really easy to drink. A damn fine beer."
"Slowly gets more delightful as it warms, lending more complexity with each sip. It's definitely worth a try."
"Notes: This is quite a brew the maltiness is great it could definately pass for a great winter brew so very tasty.Cheers"
"Wow. This is just a winner all the way around. I can't find anything bad to say about this great brew from Rogue. It looks great, has a great bottle, the name is badass (what are you drinking? ""Rogue Dead Guy Ale"" whoa...don't f*ck with that dude), it smells heavenly, tastes like liquid gold, and it is dangerously drinkable. Amazing."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable. I was never sure what type of style this was, its a pretty unique taste. Well made and one that I revisit often. This was the first craft beer I remember having and really enjoying (long time ago it seems). It's widely available here, we see it everywhere now, even Kroger's."
"Overall, I'm really impressed with this brew. It has just the right amount of sweet fruitiness blended with a wonderful oily hoppiness and mellow and raw background malt character. What a supberb brew Rogue has crafted with this one. A job very well done, and a highly recommended brew!"
"It's always good to find a reliably excellent beer, and Rogue's Dead Guy Ale is one of them. For those of us who love hops, this is a fabulous break -- an opportunity to splash in a beer full of ""malty goodness."" Rich, butterscotch, deeply sweet aroma... chewy mouthfeel... slightly bitter, smooth... the sort of beer that, as it goes down your throat, leaves an almost magnetic attraction for the next bottle in the six pack. I don't love every beer in Rogue's line-up, but when they get it right, they get it right. I have never been disappointed by this beer."
"Drinkability: With the alcohol coming through so much, it makes it one that I would have one and move on to something else."
"An odd taste, but not bad."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite session beers in general, and certainly one of my faves for the Maibock style. Relatively easy to find, this is probably Rogue's most popular brew, and it's one they do extremely well and one that I like to enjoy quite often."
"Very sweet, medium bodied ale. Good balance of hops, great example of its style, though I am not a fan of the maibock, this particular brew was well worth the time I spent drinking it down during happy hour at The Mews in Wakefield, RI. The head disolves quickly, but with a sweet beer such as this you don't miss it much."
"The beer pours a deep gold/copper color. You can tell by the smell it's gonna have a bite. Medium amount of bubbles that settle to a blotchy, thin head. Faint lacing. Strong hoppy taste, especially the finish. Leaves a dry, bitter taste. The flavor and the aftertaste work well together. I was glad I gave it a try."
"D-Very good! I would like to buy a case of this.This is my 2nd time drinking this stuff.I love the honey taste in it and it goes down real smooth but watch out after a few you begin to feel the buzz.Well done Rogue!"
"P.S. We will miss you Cindy, good luck with your new job!!!"
"This was a really nice peach color with a red tint, but the slight head collapsed quickly and left no trace. Aroma of sweet malts with blueberries lurking in the background. A big coffee taste, slightly burnt, and a metallic trace are the primary flavors, with a dry, hoppy finish. The taste could have been fresher, I thought, and the slightly chalky finish reduced the drinkability, but it's still pretty good... and I loved that blueberry touch."
"This beer pours amber brown with a light head. The head on my beer died fairly quick. The smell is a clean sweet malt. The taste is very surprising. It starts a sweet fruity malt with a bit of a raspberry flavor. The beer has a clean finish with a bit of a hops spice. This beer is clean and smooth without much of a hard bite at all. Its well blended and goes down smooth. Over all I was quite pleased with this beer. I had never had it before this tasting and it caught me off guard. I would certainly recommend this beer."
"Notes--This was a very tasty beer, I'd certainly recommend it."
"All in all, quite a good brew... my first review of a Maibock, but not my first time drinking a Dead Guy. Won't be my last, either."
"The drinkability is high, Now I see this is not hype This is quite a good Hybrid beer. Prosit, MK"
"This is a favorite ""all the time"" beer. Along with Kentucky Ale, this is usually in my fridge at all times, and one of those beers I typically reach for after work. Not a special or extreme option, but a damn nice beer regardless."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are what this beer is all about though. Feels smooth and finishes smooth, a tiny bit bitter but makes you want more."
"Dead Guy was one of the first ""good"" beers that made me realize I need to explore the beer world more. It's rich, complex, flavorful, and easy to drink. A solid craft beer."
" This is simply a great beer. Maybe the absolute best that can be found in most supermarkets anywhere in the country."
"The color is very nice, but what little head there is disappears and leaves no lacing. Smell is faint but sweet. Taste is nice and malty and has a tea like quality. The tea like quality gets stronger as it warms up... best to keep it cool. The real strength is it's drinkability, easy drinking and tasty enough to want more."
"Drinkable with ale tendencies [ as i read they use an ale yeast] some bitterness present. malty back taste."
"A good interpretation of the style, and a very enjoyable brew."
"Notes- This is a unique beer and definitely worth a try. I really enjoy it on tap or in the bottle. Easy to drink despite the High ABV. Stand up great with a heavy meal or as an evening sipper."
"Served in a mug, the beer has a copper/orange color to it and not much of a head to the beer. It smells like malt, apricots and caramel, it's a sweet aroma. It tastes like yeasty bread, sweet malt, apricots and other citrus fruit. It tastes sweet and bitter at the same time, but it finshes with a bitter aftertaste. This is a very well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is medium and a little slick, and the drinkability is pretty high with the beer being very smooth and crisp. I could drink this pretty often. It's another great beer from Rogue!"
"Drinkability: I reached for a second one real soon after the first. Very sessionable beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. The consistency on Dead Guy has been hit or miss for me. I think it is due more to an age - storage issue rather than a brewery issue. This was a good bottle."
"Very drinkable (I had 4 last night). The 6.5% ABV could sneak up on you though if you're not careful."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass, color is a rustic orange with a one head foamy white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells like some warm fresh bread just taken out of the oven with a hint of a citrus flair. Taste is of yeasty bread with a bit of hop bitterness that is very smooth and goes down very well, very well put together and tasty. I could drink these all night long very nicely balanced, another great offering from the good guys at Rogue."
"The appearance is hazy orange with a white head. The smell is of bread with some fruit. The taste confirms the smell with some homemade bread flavors, and some fruit like apple and mango. There is a nice hop balance that makes for far above average drinkability. Great stuff."
"Dit's different. Very sweet and I think might be a good transition beer. Rogue, one again, doesnt disappoint. I would have this again"
"Dead Guy Ale pours a honey color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Nice malty aroma. Nice spicy, hoppy flavor with a good malt backbone. Very quaffable. It's been quite a long time since I've had one of these, and I have to say I'm not disappointed in the least. Recommended."
"D: As I see it, this is the perfect beer. It's good in the summer, winter, and any occasion. This has been a staple in my fridge since I first had it."
"This was served on tap in a standard pint glass: A: Light orange amber color with low carbonation, little head and minimal lacing S:Malty citrus dominates with a hint of spice maybe even cinnamon T: Starts medium body with enough hop punch at the finish to be crisp and clean. M: Moderately thin but enough to represent the style. D: Very refreshing and not overly filling, a definite session beer. Yet another winner from the good folks @ Rogue."
"Very easy and pleasurable to drink. Substantial enough to be satisfied with one, if you can control yourself, because its tasty and crisp enough to easily turn this into a session brew. Gotta get me a jug of this sometime. Will come back for more."
"D - Very good. Rogue shows again why it is held in such esteem by beer geeks."
"The beer pours a medium orange/amber with an inch of head. I smell carmel malts and a twinge of hop bitterness. Taste is sweet and malty with a nice hop bitterness and balance. There is a slight citrus flavor in the hops as well. It might not be a true Maibock, but I don't care, this is an excellent brew. I had it for the first time the day I turned 21 and thought it was the best beer of the mix six I got. It would be in my regular rotation if it wasn't $10 or more a six pack."
"D: On a summer day I could sip these till the sun goes down. Inasanely refreshing and all the tastes meld with nothing standing out."
"Nice, smooth taste, with a great balance between the thick and flavorful malt and the bittering hops. Not a standout in any one area, but a good all around beer."
"Very sippable beer. I ordered this after a long day of work, and you couldn't ask for the better ending to the day. Overall, a fairly hoppy beer, although it's balanced nicely by elements of sweet and the light creaminess. Would definitely recommend it."
"All around a very, almost painstakingly balanced brew. Definitely worth keeping this one in heavy rotation."
"It was entertaining to see my friends at dinner immediately gravitate to the appearence of this beer after I poured a pint for myself. They enjoyed it very much and asked where more could be found."
"I very much like to drink this beer during the summer whether at the bar from the tap or at BBQs. It has a very light taste to it and a nice hop finish. It clears your palette when you are are having heavy foods, but it hasn't overpowered anything I've eaten."
"Very tasty beer, with a simply excellent aftertaste. To me, this is a sessionable beer, but I can see how it wouldn't be to others. Good stuff."
"This one poured with high, thin carbonation. The bubbles dissipated with a ferocious quickness. The smell was sweet, malty with some hops in the backround. This one tasted like some European beers I've had recently with American hops added for bite. Delicious sweet malt and hops fight in a tug a war in your mouth with no apparent winner. A medium mouthfeel left my mouth sticky after swallow, more typical of your heavy mouthfeel beers. The medium mouthfeel combined with the sticky aftertaste meant I definately wanted one more after I was done, making the drinkability excellent. Another unique beer from one of the most unique breweries in the Nation. Well done Rogue!"
"This beer almost reminds me of La Terrible, wonderful. Good example of the style. Definitely recommended. A+"
"This was a very enjoyable beer that I will definatly re-stock up on. It poured a cloudy amber color with a white lace. It had a very sweet smell to it. Hops and malts were both equally present with small hints of sweetness and maybe even some fruitiness. It tasted good and was very smooth and refreshing. Again the malts and hops were very present. Malty sweetness and even slightly fruity. It was a very good tasting beer that was as enjoyable as it was unique."
"Rated on the 12 oz. bottle, but have enjoyed bomber as well. Poured to a hazy reddish-orange, with one finger white-tan head that lingered. This was a very active beer, as carbonation bubbles continued to work the entire drink. Aroma of fruit (apples?) and malt, with hops present. Bitterness combined with the fruit created a very good flavor and finish. Alcohols presence became more apparent near the end....even more so in the bomber. Overall, a very good beer."
"This beer had a nice smell of malt, though not much else. The flavor is a good toasted malt flavor that sits on the tongue a while and dissipates slowly. The sweetness of the malt is pretty good without being too much. I understand that this beer is somewhat of a session brew, but I have a feeling I may get tired of the flavor."
"D: Bummer the carbonation was screwed up. I've drank this enough to know what the carbonation should be like. Like this beer quite a bit. Pairs very well with food."
"This beer pours an light amber with very little white head. Smell and taste are hard to distinguish. Smells of malts and sweet tones. Taste is similar. This beer is best on tap, I didn't find it as inviting when I picked up a six pack. It is a hard beer to describe but is very good. I recommend this one to everyone, it is middle of the road with some great flavor. The balance is amazing, a good deal of flavor that works well together. I could have these all the time. Cheers!"
"I don't care if this is a ""real"" maibock or not. Its just a damn good beer, and one that combines some tastes that are usually not together. Great name, great bottle, great beer."
" Moderately high carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Very easy to drink."
"Pours a medium orange color with an off-white head of good size. Appears lightly carbonated. Nose is malt upfront, with some subtle hop background. Has a pleasant floral scent as well. Palate is very malty, but carries a strong hop bitterness that offsets it well. Some sweet mollasses or honey flavors are present as well. More a sit warms. Mouthfeel is medium with this one, and not a lot of carbonation. Over all, this is a good example of a bock, with a discernable hop presence. Not among my favorite styles, but a good one when I'm in the mood. Recommended."
"Had the opportunity to try this out of a growler from Frugal MacDougal's in Nashville. It was a bit warm (around 65), but it actually seemed to bring out more flavor and nose. I was really impressed by it when slightly warm. It seemed like there was a much more complex taste to it, reminiscent of a belgian brown."
"Very drinkable, one of my favorite ales."
"This is a really drinkable beer. I have a renewed love for this one after this bottle."
"A natural quaffer here, all quality."
"This is a solid beer, and I can't wait until I can try it on tap."
"D - also medium, probably too bitter for some, i like it very much"
"Dark copper and light head catch the visual senses. I love the taste of this beer. Defiantly bitter but in a good way followed by spices and as mentioned a noticeable alcohol taste. I enjoy this as a after dinner beer as the flavor can over power most meals."
"Not a bad brew. A little thick and the ABV is a little high for a session beer, but I wouldn't mind knocking back a handful of these."
"Without a whole lot of experience with the style, I'd say it's a heckuva maibock."
"The more I try of this beer the more I keep thinking it's almost like a ""light"" Barleywine. It has a lot of the same hallmark flavors, but less pronounced. The beer reminds me a lot of someone trying to turn an Old Ruffian into a session beer, which isn't necessarily a bad thing!"
"Poured a light head that dissipated rather quickly. Color is golden amber with a light haze. Wonderful malty aroma with notes of caramel, no hops. Moderate hop bitterness hits you first with a nice caramel malty finish with a touch of raosty dark malt. Beer has good body and feels creamy on the palate."
"Overall: A very good Maibock/Ale."
"Drinkability: it is smooth with a great balance of flavor, I am still very interested in the flavor of this beer and I may buy it again and that says a lot."
"I had a few of these after mowing the lawn and it really didn't do anything for me. In my quest for the perfect warm weather beer, this doesn't do the trick. As it warms I think it tends to get a little better, with the harsh tastes rounding out a little as you go."
"Drinkability: A spot filling, without a particularly elite flavor. These factors detract some from the drinkability. However, this is a good, enjoyable, and, in a sense, classic beer. I'll always have a place in my heart for Dead Guy."
"Also, it comes in a pretty damn cool bottle!"
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - pours a clear bronzed caramel body with a few beads of carbonation leading up to a small off-white head. The aroma consists of pale and toasted malts with some sweet/caramel qualities. The body is medium and prickly at the start, revealing caramel, toasty, sweet (bubblegum?) malts with a mild hop bite, and leaving a medium finish. Pretty good but Rogue brews better beers that I'd rather buy."
"One of my favourite styles and I'm excited to try this Maibock from Rogue. Came in a 6-pack of 330ml bottles with the lovely skeleton on the barrel label. A solid-looking beer in the glass, iced-tea colour with a generous cap of tight dull-white head. Good full sheets of lacing. The beer can appear light orange as well as dull rusty-red. A swell looking Maibock. Onto the more important...aroma: the first scent I get is spicy nuttiness, like egg-nog with nutmeg. Excellent malts with full notes of toffee and vanilla wafer, and some sourish bready notes. Very creamy smelling, with a spritziness that could be the alcohol or the hops. The hops are complementing the malting well, adding some dry, earthy, musky smells. I get a lot of sweetish vanilla and even maple. Lots of tree bark and caramel with the bitterness of tea. Bready, roasted and warming. Not hugely complex, but done very well for the style, with emphasis on the rich malts. A respectable aroma. The taste is sweet caramel malt with the flowery aftertaste of German hops. Butterscotch and raisins with some white sugar undertones. A little hard-water in the middle of the mouth, making the body feel a little thin at times. Honey and strong toffee flavours in the beer, with lots of buttered toast and whole-grain bread tastes. Besides the tiniest watery sensation the taste is stellar for a bock. Smooth on the tongue with medium carbonation and little alcoholic burn. Medium bodied, going down easily, with all the ""have-another"" character you could want in a bock. Solid. Thanks Rogue."
"Prickly on the tip of the tounge a pleasant ammount of carbonation that settles out by the time it gets to the back for a crisp and smooth finish."
"The hops and malt comingled at the start of each sip, but a little caramel and toffee sweetness emerged near the back end. The aftertaste was distinctly hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. The carbonation and mouthfeel were a little thin, but overall this is a highly drinkable, quality brew."
"D - Not awful, but I'll make a point to avoid this in the future. It isn't undrinkable, but it is far from desirable. The pilsneresque grassyness suggests that it might be good with some foods, but I am not sure what."
"Where I live, this costs $48 a case. Its worth it. With an exceptionally rich taste but light mouthfeel, this is one of my favorite beers. The taste is an even blend of bitter fruit, smoke, and hops. It is sweet but earthy. Heavy carbonation adds to its bite. A versatile four season beer that can go along with your dinner or serve as a session beer during the Red Sox game."
"Very drinkable. I could have a few of these... thank goodness they are easy to come by."
"The beer pours with a nice amber color, but it has a weak head which doesn't last very long. (this particular bottle was clear, but it has been cloudy every now and then) I like the very unique smell of this beer. I've never really smelt a beer like it. it has a full aroma that smells malty to me. The taste follows the smell in fullness. It also has a nice lever of bitterness with a hint of citrus. There is a nice (medium) amount of carbonation and a very thick taste. The beer does however leave a lingering bitter taste in your mouth (which I don't mind) Overall this beer was very easy to drink even with its slightly high alcohol content. I would definitely drink several in a row (if it wasn't so hard to come by) and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it."
"I am curious how this ale wound up classified as a 'bock'."
"Overall a very nice beer. I could see this as killer session beer if I'm in ""that"" mood. I know it's a maibock/helles bock, and it surely has all those qualities, but honestly it doesn't fit right into that mold. It's so much more and just very nice."
"D: Pretty good session brew. Nothing really stands out and grabbed me with this one though."
"This beers made for sessioning. The light sweetness and easy feel were really easy to drink. Its 6.5%, but I look forward to getting the little pre-packaged growler and drinking it myself at a future social gathering. Nice beer."
"Dead Guys Ale is nothing like Ive ever tasted. Its an odd tasting beer, but in a very nice way. Glad its in town now!"
"Very drinkable and the bottle is cool too."
"Excellent mouthfeel and drinkability, despite the high alcohol, I could spend the whole afternoon with this great beer!"
"Drinkability - interesting style, unique and nothing like it. great beer / craft brewer."
"Drinkability isn't too high, not a whole lot going on and too sweet for me..."
"Orange color with one finger off white head that falls to a thin film immediately. Smell of bread, orange peel, faint alcohol. The bready, biscuity flavor is what dominates for me though. Some faint earthy hoppiness. Taste follows suit, very bready. Mouthfeel is somewhat chewy and full bodied. Finishes with some bitterness, but on the earthy side. Overall an above average beer, but not one I would go back to a lot."
"Worth trying again, but I wouldn't go to a whole lot of trouble to get it."
"A really good beer. Pours a somewhat cloudy orange. Head off first pour is about half inch and hands in there for a while. Subsequent pours, little head. Leaves no lacing. First smell is citrusy and hops. Taste is balanced with some hops bitterness but a slightly malty flavor. Very smooth, rich mouthfeel. I had it with my Easter ham dinner and it is a good complement to food. It would also be a good session beer, taking the 6.5 abv into account."
"I did not pour this beer I drank it straight from the bottle. So the color was unknown to me. However, this seems to be one of those beers that you really just sit and enjoy. Not one to be drank fast but to savor the flavor. I liked the strong yet mild taste of this beer. I would recomend trying this beer at least once."
"Pours a nice mid-orange amber color with a big two fingered head. Malty nose with hints of breadiness and slight citrus. Head sticks around througout with good lacing. Taste follows the nose with a sticky bready taste rounded out with citrus and dark fruit flavors (raisin possibly). Easy to drink, and decpetively strong in ABV."
"Mouthfeel is full and bubbly, oily. A nice feel. Overall not the most drinkable brew ever, though I could see being in the mood for this from time to time. Not great, not bad. Worth a try."
"Glow-in-the-dark bottle gets extra points for appearance!"
"This is a darker orange colored beer with a relatively weak head on top. Very grainy and salty smell to it. Not all that aromatic. Has a nice bitterness to it. I'm not really sure what type of hops this beer uses, but they are quite delicious. The maltieness is the major note and reminds me of a hearty bread, but it is well balanced with the hops. It is clean and crisp and easy to drink. A nice offering from Rogue."
"a bottle from our friday bio meeting. pours orangey-brown. nice white head. bubbly. odor is kind of citrusy and earthy, a bit like oranges. taste is malty and crisp. good hop flavor, not too powerful, some alcohol on the edges that is almost, but not quite unsettling. actually, i think the alcohol taste is tamped down to some extent by the citrusy hop flavor. smooth and eminiently drinkable. a good session beer in my opinion. this is my first try of rogue's flagship beer and im impressed."
"Light amber in colour with a bit of haze and lots of carbonation. Very malty aroma and flavor, with some minor caramel and orange notes. Theres a bit of roasted grain nuttiness on the finish as well. I detected a bit of spicy hop bitterness, but this is one doesnt seem nearly as hoppy or as complex as other Rogue products that Ive sampled. Solid, but unspectacular."
"Pours a warm copper with an off white head. Smells biscuity, a strong malty base with mild hops and citrus not much nose to this one. Taste is very balanced sweet malt on the palate with a dry hop finish, a very solid session ale.I could definately down a lot of these"
"Overall, not a bad beer, but I wasn't expecting such a dry finish. The flavor was good, but I don't think I'd drink a lot of these in a row."
"Bottle purchased at Whole Foods, Chicago. A bit of a surprise since I did not know what style this was. A flagship beer from a northwestern brewer thats not full of hops? So be it. Big malt smell upon opening and pouring, almost like malt candy. A lovely brown body under a cream colored head. Great taste of caramel malts and something that must be honey, that cant help but overpower any hop bill. Big caramel and toffee malt finish."
"d- this beer lacks a whole lot of drinkability"
"Nice brew to style making it a very sessionable malt refresher."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I probably would not buy it but I would drink it again. Smooth, refreshing. (Nice bottle) I have my old time male friends who know nothing about beer but drink this just because of the look of the bottle. Interesting what we (men) do."
"the mouthfeel is full, coats your mouth with malty goodness, but not to thick."
"Bottle erupts a clear amber with a frothy, bubbly head that recedes slowly. Aromas are sweet and malty, though there isn't much coming out, mildly spicy with little hops detected. The flavor is pretty clean, sweet malty, no hops tasted. A bit alcoholic at the end. Body is weak, slightly watery. A little dissapointed with this as most Rogues seem very good. Very clean, somewhat refreshing though this caramel bite is halfhearted. One and I'm done.."
"Pours a reddish-orange color with an off-white head. Floral, hoppy aroma. Bready, slghtly caramel flavor with some citrus notes. Very, very smooth, medium bodied and moderately-to-highly carbonated with a dry finish, incredibly drinkable. A great beer."
"Drinkability - this is super drinkable to me. Even with the price so crazy high (it's worth it.)"
"Pours a deep, slightly cloudy copper with a large golden-tan head that is slow to dissipate and leaves good lacing and a large ring around the glass. Aroma is of sweet malts with some plum and alcohol, and floral hops in the mix as well. A bit of yeast and bread are also apparent Taste is lightly hoppy, with plent of malt underlying it. Caramel and butter come through, with some dark fruitiness lying just beneath it. Plum and pear are noticible. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and crisp, very full and satisfying. Drinkability is very good. A very nice ale, interesting twist on a maibock, equally good on a crisp fall day or at the beginning of spring."
"Overall: Sure, the label will make you buy it, but the flavor will keep you coming back. I really like this beer for the flavors it pits against one another."
"Drinkability is hurt by sweetness and relatively high alcohol content. It's good stuff and a nice change of pace, but I couldn't take more than a few of these."
"Kewl skeleton holding a pint, sitting atop cask of rogue ale on my 12 oz. bottle. Poured a hazy dark orange-honey color with a half inch off white head that dissipated to a thin layer. Smell is malty and on the sweet side , with light honey , sweet fruit aromas of papaya , and bit of hops. Taste is also kinda sweet , the 4 malts make it nice and rich , bit of honey sweetness , then the hops come in and clean up the finish, leaving a slighly bittersweet and grainy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth. Mmn tasty and very drinkable. Would love to session this Maibock."
"Exciting flavor profile for a style that can easily be pretty bland and wheat-heavy. A very well rounded offering from Rogue; highly drinkable. This was my first introduction to the Rogue brewers many a year ago. ('Gratefully dedicated'...I know it's a coincidence, but that's still pretty cool)."
"Very drinkable, I can certainly recommend!"
"drinkability - taste is pretty good, stays consistent throughout, isnt too thin, and has a reasonable abv so overall this would be a good beer to have a few of if you options are limited."
"The body has a medium feel. Carbonation seems a little low, but still a easy drinking. I don't think I would kill anyone for it, but you never know."
"It's been a while since I have had this beer. It is good. Really good. The malt richness of this beer is not so overwhelming. Maybe I'll have another."
"I wish I could taste this straight from the tap..."
"Overall, a great beer to sit down and relax with."
"Very obliging and easy to drink, but it's got a pretty subtle alcohol punch to it - with the hop sedative effects, I'd take it easy with this one. It's a distinct departure from the bock styles I've had before, and I look forward to exploring the style more; a very nice brew all around."
"Poured into a 20 oz. pint glass, with a orange/copper color, with an of white head that disappears quickly. A nice aroma of citrus and spice comes through on the first scent, then there is a bit of malty sweetness. The taste starts with the malt followed by a mellow hop flavor with citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is medium to slightly heavy, and has nice dry finish at the end. The taste is well balanced, this can be a go to beer when you can find nothing you like at the store."
"This is a drinkable beer. It is a little sweeter than I like, but not bad. Being a May beer it might actually be better on a sunny May day. It is a very smooth and sweet tasting ale. I would certainly have it again."
"Pours a cloudy amber. Foamy head did not las t long,and not much lace. Smell is malty,but not strong. Mouthfeel is light,not much carbination. Taste is smooth and malty, with a bit of a fruit/mint taste in the finish. This beer tastes a lot better than it looks or smells."
"Pours a bright amber with gold highlights around the edges. Smells of malts and hops but not very strong. First taste is hops that flows in, then a smooth malt flows in with really no alcohol taste present. Sily smooth mouthfeel almost perfect amount of carbonation. Heh don't wanna drink too many or won't be feeling too well in the morning, but it is hard not to."
"The ABV, while not high, is high enough to lower the drinkability. Were it not for that, this would make a fine session brew."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer, quite balanced. I bet I could drink this all night (although, perhaps my wallet wouldn't allow). I know this isn't a typical maibock, but I'm *definitely* going to seek out more now. Next time I'm buying a 6 pack instead of a 22."
"I've never had a ""red"" beer that I liked before, so this is a pleasant surprise for me. Not too heavy, but a good filler-upper. Perfect for late winter. I'll have to buy this again."
"Drinkability: This is quality stuff. You could easily drink a sixer of this in one sitting. Please go seek this out."
"I was often curious as to what this would taste like exactly. I've seen it sitting on the shelves at my store for a long time. I've never had to refill the runners with it, but I enjoyed the name so I picked up a bottle. It looked good, had a nice color. The head was quite big, which I liked a lot. I don't know if I had a skunky beer, but it smelled terrible. I was shocked at how bitter it tasted, but maybe I shouldn't have been. It wasn't very smooth, and the bitterness remained in my mouth long after I was done with the beer. I wouldn't buy it again."
"D: The beer goes down very nicely and is very tasty, which allows you to throw it back easily. The only thing that diminishes its drinkability is that it may fill you just a bit. However, I could certainly kill a few of these large bottles before I get too hammered and realize that I’m not tasting it anymore."
"D - amazingly drinkable brew. The size mug I was drinking was basically two pints plus 2 oz. Could have drank some more, but alcohol was kicking in and I had to commute home (on the subway). Great, easy drinking, extremely flavorful, well-balanced ale."
"D: I had two and would have continued if it wasnt getting late. Tastes good and filling"
"Poured an orange-hued coppery color with the thinnest off-white head that quickly fell to very light lacing. Smells primarily of floral hops combined with a blend of caramel malt and has a nice sweetness about it. Tastes of caramel / toffee malt and slight hoppy bitterness, alcohol flavor present as well. Medium body with fine and light carbonation, mouthfeel is rougher than most, leaves a slight alcohol/hop bitter aftertaste. Overall a solid beer, nothing too complex or over the top about it, easily drinkable. Have had much better from Rogue's, but not bad at all."
"This beer poured a really light clear dark honey color with almost no head. Very few carbonation bubbles come up from the bottom. The smell is a nice mixture of hops, malts, a faint fruit. This is a good tasting beer with a great balance of hops and malts. It's a nice rich tasting beer actually. This is a dangerously drinkable beer if you ask me. Goes down very well."
"The flavor, just like that smell has something I can't quite name. Hints of apricot? Hop profile is subtle, and could be stronger in my opinion."
"meh...it's okay. never had an example of the style before, but from what i read this seems to be a fair example. i guess i'll give it another shot sometime"
"Pours a deep amber with a decent head that clings throughout. Smells sweet and malty. The taste is much stronger than the smell suggests. Fruity and malty at first. Then you can really taste some alcohol. Finishes quite hoppy, to perfectly balance the malt. Moderate carbonation, with a slick, smooth mouthfeel. A well balanced beer, I'll take another."
"M&D: big, rich and oily initially on the mouthfeel, yet softening all the time towards a soothing texture in the very end; this is my first-ever Maibock, and I must say I'm quite impressed. Yet it's hard to imagine a German lager is so low in terms of carbonation and contains such high-octane aromatic hoppyness~~ In a sense it is indeed like some American IPAs I've tried, and it's so very nice all the same."
"d- really pleasant to drink a couple. i wouldn't choose it for beer pont though"
"Looking forward to having Deadguy again, hopefully on tap!"
"Overall a good beer but nothing too special either."
"Very mellow yet awesome."
"Quite tasty...a whole lot of Munich malts. Seems to get sweeter near the end. Probably too fruity to fit the style, but Rogue has never really adhered to ""styles"" all that well."
"Feel is good and I bought a case of this since I know it drinks rather well."
"Drinkable enough but nothing special"
"When poured into a Pilsner glass it was a light orange color (almost honey color) with a nice head of foam that left some rings and lace around the glass. It had a wonderful aroma of juicy fruits with some sweet malts in the background. At first I was expecting this to have an average ale taste, but there is nothing average about this taste. Up front there was some juicy fruits, then some sweet malts, and at the very end, some bitter hops. It wasn't too hoppy, it wasn't low in the hops, it was just right. Much like the Three Bears story, but with hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and with a nice dose of carbonation. This made for a nice well balanced ale and a good Rogue product. I wish I had bought the 22oz. bomber of this beer."
"Kinda brick/brown colored as it sits in my glass. Not much of a head with non-existent lacing down the side. Smell? Well, hard to describe but I can detect some kind of fruit, maybe raspberry? Taste of fruit on the tongue as well and hoppier than expected for the style. Come to think of it, maybe a little darker colored for the style. I would rate this a slightly better than average brew to drink, have had it with smoked brisket and thought it went well."
"This pours a hazy amber. Gave is some good head, a fizzy bubbly stuff that shrinks to nothing after a while. with little head to speak of. Smells sweet and of mildly toasted malts and hop goodness, and has a deep fruit aroma, something orangish and tropical. Pretty nice. Taste is initially of grainy earthy hops, and some good malty toasted something seems like. The alcohol becomes apparent throught the middle and and has a very nice warming touch. This is one of those I'd call very well balanced in character, with carbonation and smoothness and alcohol warmness and hops and malts all balancing each other out one way or another, which makes this an extremely drinkable beer."
"O: Props to the guys at Rogue...wow a style that is typically fermented as a lager and they used their pacman ale strain. Awesome job and I highly recommend this beer!"
"Cheers"
"Quite drinkable... while I was not as impressed with this brew as I have been with many other Rogue brews, it is still quite well done. Rogue remains one of my top 5 favorite brewers."
"I like this, will pick up more soon!!"
"This is another good brew from the folks at rouge and my first Maibock. Look forward to trying other examples of this style and other Rouge br"
"First of all, I think there is a difference in the taste between a growler and bottle. This is quite a bit more bitter. It looks a bit darker than I remember and also seems to be a bit cloudy. The head was small but reading my bottle reveiw I said the same thing about it then. There seems to be a little difference in taste between serving types. I have had this beer on-tap as well and it was far different. Perhaps I will reveiw it on-tap sometime. Still a good beer from a good brewer."
"This is the one beer to have when you are having only one....cuz any more then one of these guys (12 oz.) and you arent getting up. It is THAT heavy a feeling beer. The problem is that it just doesnt have the rest to back it up. All that weight in your body and the body of the beer is just medium....think Guiness-. Flavor is pretty one dimentional too, nice bitterness along the lines of a strong cup of coffee. Sweetness and maltiness are sort of muted by the odd alcohol/something I cant place aroma...not bad, just not part of my palate memory. All in all not what you are hoping for and ye for some reason I come back to it every so often just to be underwhelmed."
"It's flavorful. It's not that great though. I think there's a certain hype about this beer. I was hoping for something good-excellent, but I got an average strong beer. I didn't go reaching for a second bottle and neither did anybody else. There are better drinks to quaff."
"There is a light carbonation, but the mouthfeel is overall quite nice. It is refreshing. Overall, it was different than expected. A much simpler brew. While I could probably have another, I don't see the point. More exciting stuff out there."
"While this is a great brew, I have one point of contention with it; call me old fashioned, but if you categorize a beer as any type of bock, it better be a LAGER!!! However, because Dead Guy does have a lot in common with many of the Maibocks Ive tried, and because its a fairly exceptional brew, Im more than willing to overlook any sort of classification gripe I might have. Highly recommended."
"I am really impressed by this beer, and I see why they sell it in giant growlers."
"I prefer this beer relatively cool; After it starts to warm up the alcohol becomes more noticeable; Never astringent or ginny, but it leaves a certain sickly taste as the carbonation starts to fade and the beer warms. 6.5 abv - a lot or a little depending on what you're used to, but two of these put me in a right cheerful mood. Definitely not a session beer but definitely worth a try."
"Overall, it is enjoyable. It is not what I was expecting, but is still tasty; I could drink a few or more of these in one sitting."
"sort of reminds of an esb. lots of malt, but a big hop presence as well. a lot more than i expected, though true to style by the description. full and smooth mouthfeel. plenty of sweetness makes this a bit filling, but very enjoyable as well."
"Body falls just below medium with a slick mouthfeel and light carbonation. A non-thinker and easy to put away."
"This beer drank easily and was not very filling. I would definately enjoy another one."
"Dead Guy is a very good beer. What Rogue beer isn't, right? A little more expensive than I'd like, (around $8 for a six pack) but that's Rogue for you. This wasn't a ""knock my socks off"" beer, but it's a very solid brew and one you should try if you haven't."
"However the beer pourse a cloudy amber orange color with a decent head that could hold and lace a little better than it does. It smells rather sweet but not to strong of a smell. It tasted of a good level of hop bitterness with some mild fruity malts that give it an initial sweetness. It hold well in one's mouth with some good carbonation and some slight dryness. Overall its a fantastic beer that can be drank easily."
"The smell was sweet with fruits amd malt, caramel and hops. Although this was a decently hoppy beer, it wasn't terribly bitter. It was sweeter with a complex taste of fruits, rather spicy and a nice finish. It was clean and quite spicy but rather drinkable. This isn't rated too high but I think it's pretty damn good."
"Poured this beer into my pilsner glass. It poured a nice golden color with a thick head that left plenty of lacing. it smelled of caramel and hops. Taste of caramel and fruit. Not too hoppy of a beer. Medium spicy and roasted malt flavor. Good carbonation with a nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer, I enjoyed it very much just like all the rogues."
"12 ounce bottle. Dead Guy Ale pours out a clear amber color with a huge, long lasting head. Good lacing. The aroma is caramel, plums, apricots, and hops. Biscuity malt flavor up front, which then becomes toasted. Fruity flavors come in at the middle. Sweetness turns bitter in the finish. This beer isn't as hoppy as your average Rogue beer, but it has some tasty bitterness. A little spicy with an alcohol kick in the finish too. This is the first beer I ever bought, and it's still a favorite."
"Golden amber. Fluffy head with sticky lace all the way down the glass. Honeyed malts and candied fruits in the nose with a bit of orange zest. Taste is primarily golden roasty malts with enough citrus/leafy hop sparkle to balance the gesture toward sweetness. Toasted biscuits. Medium body, lightly chewy mouthfeel. I've been craving maltiness lately, and this didn't quite live up to what I remembered as a surprisingly tasty malt-forward beer the first time I tried it. But it's definitely a great beer to have in my hand while hanging lights on the xmess tree."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. Definitely a session beer."
"This beer is a strikingly gorgeous deep amber with strong ruby tones. The color was nice enough that it was even complimented by a non-beer drinker whom I was playing pool with at the time. Unfortunately there has about the least head formation I have ever seen with just a bit of a sudsy ring around the beers surface and that is all. Smell is straightforward with a balanced earthy scent, some strawberry notes but nothing overpowering. Taste is quite delicious, earthy and smooth especially after warming up a but, really invites large swigs. This is a very high quality ale which could easily be chosen to introduce friends to craft beer because of it's approachable flavor, yet all the signs of a high quality product are here."
"D- This is an interesting beer with spicy bold hops and malt and sweet honey notes in the background. It doesn't have the sulfur qualities of a lager but it does have a crisp clean quality that is nice."
"Very pleased. Even though not a growler in the true, fresh sense, bottle didn't seem to apply since this was not the 12 oz. or 22 oz bomber."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer overall. I could sit around and drink these all night long."
"Pours hazy copper, with a thin white head. Poor retention, and very weak lacing. Toasted amber malt and floral hop nose. Crystal malt, nut, honey and caramel flavors, with a pronounced english hop presence and hint of fruit ester. Tiny rushing bubbles carbonate the light body and give it a crisp mouthfeel. Aftertaste is clean, but the finish is semi-residual. It's easy to drink, and the complex malt profile is well balanced with pronounced hops, but it's still nothing to shout about."
"The taste is a spicy blend of malt and hops with some touches of alcohol in the backend. This is a unique tasting and satisfying beer."
"Tasty enough but i'll leave this one for you guys."
"Overall i would recommend. It is a very easy beer to acquire (relatively speaking). A great example of american craft beer."
"-UF"
"D: Very drinkable brew. Nice session beer."
"My neighbor dropped this off in exchange for a Stone's IPA. The Dead Guy poured a hazy orange-copper; I thought it would be clearer. There was a white head that remained for most of the glass. Very malty bready smell, then I got some caramel and the smell ended with some piney hops. The malts hit first with a semi-sweet caramel, then a hint of the hops. The hops and malts seem to be in real good balance, not too much of one or the other. The mouth feel was medium, almost chewy, but there was a real clean finish making this beer very drinkable. I would definitely have this again."
"Mouthfeel is thin, sticky, and syrupy, average carbonation, which is visible until the end. It's very, very drinkable, as the body is so light and the taste so mild. A little close to a pale ale in flavor for my tastes, but the bottle surprised me by emptying itself very quickly."
"Yes, it went down well and so did the second one thereafter."
"Thick creamy foam ice bergs on a brilliant amber sea. The head gradually disappeared, but it was quite a sight. The odor was complex, with obvious malt, and toast, honey-floral undertones. The rich malt dominated the flavor, alcohol was noticeable, and the bitter finish was assertive, but not aggressive. Nice body."
"This beer pours a clear amber topped by a thick head with moderate retention. Malty/bready nose with spicy hops. The flavor is malty, with brown sugar and a slight hint of fruit and bitterness. There is nothing to get exited about in here, but this is a solid, quaffable brew."
"drinkability is very high, this goes down so smooth. I really enjoyed this beer, it is something different than the typical hop bomb ales that are very popular these days, so far i have been very impressed with Rogue."
"Sofa king expensive."
"Smooth as silk. Probably not for everyone but for those who like a lot of taste and a somewhat heavier ale, well worth a try. If you like it you'll want several."
"Drinkability -- I could definitely have more than a few of these, but this is not one I'd seek out. A very good beer but its just not my ""cup of tea."""
"This is my first Dead Guy Ale, although I have another bottle in storage which I'll try again in a couple of weeks. Not quite as fantastic as I was expecting given its reputation (and given how much I adore Rogue Chocolate Stout), but still quite good, and I'll definitely pick it up again if I happen to see it."
"Being from Canada I'm always concerned about the freshness of US micros exported to Canada (Where is Free Trade?) as they are always held in bond at Customs (Federal) before they are distributed to government (Provincial) run liquor outlets. All bureaucracy aside, this ale stood the test of time and I was duly rewarded. Poured to a carmel brown with a healthy lacing with slow retention. Wafts of nugmeg and other spices added to the experience. Had a dry feeling in your mouth, much like drinking cold tea (which is not a bad thing). Left me craving another. Freshness was not an issue.. Another excellent Rogue product. Well worth the potential bureaucratic quagmire."
"Drinkablility = good."
"Got this in a 650ml bottle. Interesting mix of sweet and bitter malt. Hazy reddish/copper hue, with a nice quarter inch of white head and lacing. Smells of fruit, grass, maybe hints of hops. The taste is quite appetizing, somewhat spicy, a little sweet and fruity, caramel malts, maybe, and the bitterness kicks in towards the end, complete with a medium mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation.Very fine aftertaste. As many have mentioned, it hides its alcoholic character quite well, so it's pretty drinkable. Overall, I like it a lot."
"Well, this is my first Rogue and first Maibock. Pours a cloudy copper color with nice carbonation and alot of lacing. Scents of hops, citrus, spices. This brew has a very nice and unique taste of sweet/bitter malt. There's a medium body. The lacing just does not want to disappear. The brew is very drinkable at 6.5%, highly recommended."
"I will revisit this one in the VERY near future again."
"The first time I ever sampled this brew I wasn't particularly impressed, but it has grown on me since and I really enjoyed it on tap. Definitely recommended."
"Damn fine brew. Another winner from Rogue. Mouthfeel of most rogue beers to me seem so rich and creamy but not overbearing. Above average in this style and one I've gone back to again and again. You can never go back to the well too many times with this."
"Caveat Emptor: I haven't had a Maibock except for this one (which I've tried a few times). This has a rather nice smell. I can't quite tell the individual components of it, but it seems to be dominated by a sweet malty smell with a bit of hops. It tastes good. It starts of fairly sweet and then finishes with a taste that I can't quite put my finger on. It's pleasant though. The carbonation is decent, but nothing amazing. It goes down pretty easy too, but the aftertaste can get a bit strong after a while so I don't see myself drinking more than two at a time."
"Overall drinkability solid. I find this to be a near-perfect dinner beer -- those new to the beer might want to give it a few tries, as the overall quality of the beer can sneak up on you when you're not looking."
"Drinkability- Couldn't even find word one about this beer. Don't even know if it's a Pale Ale or not. I just know it was pretty damn good. Different and quenching."
"A nicely balanced, refreshing beer--bracing enough for 50 degree nights. I have no idea why it's Dead Guy ALE."
"Ok, but not all that great, I won't go out of my way for it, but I'll take it if offered."
"Not for the feint of heart, or the novice beer drinker."
"excellent. this is highly drinkable but also high abv ! caution."
"It's hard to find a really good maibock. Dead Guy Ale is exceptional. Very full mouthfeel with the perfect balance of hops and malts. And lots of both. This beer doesn't mess around. This is the best maibock I've tasted since Wurzberger's Maibock and I don't even know if that is produced anymore. The only drawback to the beer is it's $11 a six pack. Steep price for an American beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Balanced."
"The first thing noticable about the taste is the sweetness of the malts, but the hops balance very nicely. Noticable alchohol taste, with a great meduim mouthfeel. This is a great beer which is even better on tap."
"Overall, this is a very good and filling beer. Good flavor, impressive appearance and very well balanced overall. Too bad it costs too damn much to make it a regular."
"A great looking two finger head with a dark coppery look.When I picture an ale in my mind I picture this color.Too many ales are to light in my opinion.A full spiced ale, but not an overwhelming taste,just right.This is a great ale from on of the best brewers in America."
"Slightly hazy, maple-caramel colour toped by a short, dense, cream head that showed a bit of lacing. Grainy, caramel maltiness in the aroma, with fruity undercurrants. Hops are restrained, but there is a bit of grassiness. Bitterness hits you right away, while the rest of the flavours seem to complement this character as they appear and fade away. Toasted malt shows up next, followed by a bit of plum and light spicy, herbal hops. Caramel and pleasant alcohol appear at the end and carry through the finish, at which point the bitterness finally starts to fade. Soft carbonation is well integrated with the texture, which starts to dry out in the middle, but this fades in the finish. Fully bodied without being sticky. Lingering alcohol warmth at the finish as well. All around, this is a really enjoyable beer with just enough complexity to keep me coming back."
"Overall, a well-made beer, but it doesn't do a lot for me."
"Wow! I was expecting a good beer and this exceeded my expectations. It has all the characteristics of a kick ass session beer, maybe a little high ABV though."
"Drinkability - Because of it's mild taste and subtle character, it is easy to drink."
"....all in all a unique brew which bridges the style gap between maibock and ale ( if anyone asked for this). Perhaps I feel let down aster all the hype touting this as a Grman style ( and I'm a mad German bock and lager hound). Frankly Id rather drink mellow lagered German Maibock but if there is none available this ale will fill the bill."
"It's a wonderful beer... it's just not a maibock!"
"Scents of caramel, toffee, toast, and some floral hops. Man this tastes really good. Honey rolling over my tongue. Medium bitterness. Rather full bodied, and medium carb. Im going to score this a bit lower and the overall because its not a maibock if its made with ale yeast. Its probably a bit too dark also, but damn it is good."
"This poured orange/copper with very little head. But I think that is only because I poured it too softly. The aromas were of slight hops up front, buit were quickly covered by the sweet caramel malts. The taste was of citrusy caramel malts, and a little bit of grape nuts. The bitterness of the hops made for a dry finish and the low carbination made for a smooth mouthfeel. The drinkability of this is that it should be enjoyed by everybody."
"Very smooth finish. A great ""session"" beer. Also a good beer to recommend to someone just getting into mirco's."
"Not a great session beer, but still good. Its not very filling. Certain subtle tastes in it would make hesitant to drink more than a few of these. They are good tastes, but I think I would get sick of them after a few of these."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and mildly carbonated. Worth a try."
"This is a wonderful beer; I'm surprised I've never reviewed it. Drank once or twice per month at the local pizza pub. Pours a nice deep coper to auburn color; translucent; vibrantly carbonated and impressively headed and laced. Smells of sweet malts, dark fruits, spices and esters. Tastes about as sweet and dark as possible without getting into heavy roasted grains. Lots of barley, molassas, and brown sugar. Mild, smooth flavors of prunes, dates, raisons, and almonds. More highly hopped than most would expect; picking up fuity esters and spicy alcohol. Full rich body that remains creamy under the abundant carbonation. Finishes sweet and a bit malty. I've always considered this a dopplebock. No matter where you categorize it, it's a good beer."
"Pours a brownish honey color with a large bubbled off-white head. The smell is weak but non-offensive. Fairly basic, with rich malt smells, but just not much of them. The taste is slightly complex, sweet malts in front, followed by a strange fruit flavor, and finnished with slightly bitter hops. I'm not sure about the fruit, it seems almost peachy, but maybe darker. Mabye there is a real small amout of extract in it. Carbonation is decent, and the feel is not exactly heavy or oily, but not light either. This is a real middle or the road brew. Overall it's a real drinkable beer, but sorta hard to describe. It is my first maibock review, but this beer is just sorta hard to pin down. I would buy it again, I suppose."
"One of the best brews to grab on tap as far as I'm concerned."
"Pours a dark honey color with a fat finger of creamy head that dissipates in several seconds, leaving a very light lacing. Pretty color. Smell is pretty strong, containing hefty malts (detecting a lot of caramel and coffee) along with solid hops and some alcohol. Taste follows suit with a strong but good balance of malts and hops. A lot of caramel and coffee flavors mixed with the bitterness of the hops. I can taste the alcohol, too, eh. I expected more smoothness from the mouthfeel, although some is present. Overall, I'd drink it again if I were in the mood for its features."
"Overall: This was an average offering. I am not a big fan of anything that is this sweet so I probably am not the best judge but needless to say, I will not return."
"An instant classic. Rogue really has a winner, and an all around great ale. Along with Anchor Steam, this is one of my tried and true stand bys. I've had it both on tap and in the bottle, and neither fails to please. A good full hearty ale which is well balanced and a pleasure to drink. Very little to say about this beer which is bad. Sometimes beers are brewed which are just damn near perfect, and this is one of them."
" I have been to the Rogue brewery a couple of times (although it's been several years), and have always enjoyed sampling their offerings. I will say I'm confident I'd have ranked this higher had It been poured from a tap. Good beer."
"Pours a deep amber with a nice off white head. Nice malty nose with a light nuttiness and caramel undertone. Taste is very nice with a soft rich maltiness. A good substitute for an Oktoberfest when they go out of season and you need a fix. Mouthfeel is good and medium bodied with average carbonation. Drinkability is good. Maybe a bit $$$ for an everyday fix, but if you have a malty Marzen/maibock jones this is an able substitute."
"An interesting orange-amber color with slight haze and an average amount of off-white head. Nose was pleasant but understated--sweet malts and a hint of hops. Those qualities carry over to the taste, which is nicely malted up front, fading to a bit of bitterness that lingers just about right. A smooth but not chewy mouthfeel helps make this an unexceptional but nicely drinkable beer."
"Also, congrats to Rogue Ales Brewery on their Gold Medals."
"Okay, the head has dissipated enough that I have struck beer. Caramelly, toasty malt prevails. Medium hop bitterness comes through quickly, leaving a slightly astringent aftertaste. Super creamy mouthfeel and quite drinkable. Admittedly I know little about the Maibock style, but I found this to be a very well balanced and tasty ale that is definitely worth a try. I have to wonder about the excessive foaming, though."
"Pours a dark bronze color with a small off-white head that left nice lacing through out the whole glass. Smell is of caramel, and very sweet. Mouthfeel is thick. Overall, this is unlike any other maibock/helles bock I've ever had. A beer that is classified as a helles ""clear"" bock shoudl at least be clear, not dark and cloudy like this beer. The mouthfeel was also too thick for it to be a good maibock. However, even if this brew wasn't intended to be a maibock by the brewer, I still didn't like it."
"Reviewing this, Sprecher Mai Bock, Capital Brewery Mai Bock, and Tyranena Fighting Finches Mai Bock simultaneously. This is the least attractive of the three, a cloudy, dull red-amber color with almost no lacing. Smells floral and faintly sweet. Initial taste is of sweet apples and bitter hops, with the bitterness lingering. The taste is too unbalanced, I think, in favor of the hops; it's fairly unpleasant to drink. Feels a little harsh in the mouth, as well. I'm not a fan of this one."
"Drinkable"
"deep reddish mahogany or dark amber honey colored with enough haze to render it opaque. creamy off-white head that left chunky bits of lacing stuck to the inside of the glass all the way to the bottom. light floral scent with malt wafting though and a faint tingle on the nose suggesting hops content. tasted caramel and nut flavors in the initial sweet malt impression - toasty. bitterness creeps in soon after adding bite to the malt before crushing it with a heavy hops burst mid-palate. strong finish that is noticably more hops than malt (despite the touted ""balanced finish"") and has great lingering power. felt smooth at first, then more medium-bodied and a bit chewier or oily. appropriate carbonation. very decent brew if you're in the mood for something less pale with plenty of hops."
"I Got another rogue to try tommorow, I hope it is as good as this was."
"D&N: I think I like this beer better in the bottle than on tap. Tasty and highly drinkable."
"At the end of the bottle, the flavours are not as distinct as they were at the start. However, this actually makes the beer smoother and as a result more drinkable. I'm not sure if this is a result of the beer, my palate adjusting to the grapefruit hops or the temperature I started at compared to the temp at the end. Either way, the beer is smoother at the end, but the flavours are not as dramatic or bold. Basically, you're getting one good thing at the expense of another. Regardless, this is a very good offering from Rogue."
"D: This is an awesome beer. I tend more towards ales than lager, but this is fantastic. It has more character than the last Marzen I enjoyed, but not quite so much as some of the better IPA's. At $6.50 for a 6-pack, this beer will find a welcome home in my fridge any day of the week."
"Drinkability: Could make for a fantastic session brewgoes down deceptively smoothly."
"Very malty, very malty. The nose was somewhat mellon-like or some fruit I can't remember when I was in Puerto Rico (Passion fruit?). The appearance either escapes me or was completely unremarkable, I might revise that in the near future as I have another bottle. The taste was a great thick malty flavor with some burnt toast and an excellent creamy consistency. You got the impression you were drinking fresh baked sweet bread in a sense. I had to clean my pallete afterward but almost regretted doing so as the feel and taste weren't anything to complain about."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, trade with maeib. Pours very foamy and fizzy, with a decent lingering head. Deep amber colour, hazy. Sweet yeasty aroma with elements of oak, molasses, butter and hayloft. Flavour has some molasses sweetness, butter, butterscotch, some spices and decent hops, but lacks a fresh and spritzy ""bite"". Too much butter elements, I guess. Still a beer well above average, but Im not ecstatic."
"This is a nice beer. A bit more hoppy than a double bock which is nice. I'm not a terrible fan of malty sweet beers. I think years ago I made some chili using this with good results. I will have to try it again."
"I won this beer at a club meeting so it was worth the price of raffle tickets. I probably won't buy it. An okay beer but one that I will soon forget."
"Hopefully, they'll get the quality control controlled at the bar so I can get a real taste of this fresh and alive instead of buttery and gross. Until then, I may as well live in Ohio. DOH!"
"Overall = A great tasting beer. A little too syrupy for me to pound down many at a time but this is an amazing beer to sip slowly and enjoy."
"Beautiful amber color with a thick off-white head. There is a significant alcohol smell, with a hint of hops. The smell is a bit closer to solvent than I'd prefer in a beer. The taste is less dominated by alcohol, though its presence is more noticable than I would expect for 6.5%. This beer definately gets most of its flavor from malt, with hops playing a secondary role. It's fairly sweet, with a hint of something burnt. It has a light feel, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, but I think I'd get bored after two. This is a decent beer, but I'd expect a six-pack to cost $8, not $11."
"Pours a hazy dark orange brown. Some head, that falls quickly to a table of beige. Nose is malty with a strong candied fruit aroma. Taste is malts and some hops, good but not expceptional. The candied fruit is less pronounced but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is thin for such a malty and sweet brew. Very easy to drink and not too expensive. Good beer to have on hand for company."
"Poured an amber brown with a thin beige head and no lacing. Smell was light and malty, not much going on. Taste is very sweet and malty upfront, with hints of caramel and plums, and nicely balanced with a solid woodsy hops presence. Medium bodied with a somewhat syrupy smooth feel. This is one of my least favorite Stone offerings---its not bad but its just not good enough for me to seek out."
"Very disappointing."
"I pour this beer fro ma 12 oz. bottle into a wide mouth stem med glass, nice rich color, medium head retention with a sweet pleasant aroma. Taste, ...oh yeah baby, this is some good stuff, full boidied, great balance and depth. at 6.5 abv i must be careful, i could drink this maibock all friggin night. Rogue never ever dissapoints me , i love this stuff!"
"I've always tried this beer straight out of the bottle, so this is my first time pouring it into a glass and am I surprised to find that this beer is a reddish-orange amber. Not sure why, but I thought it would look even darker. The smell is of sweet malts and along with the hop aroma there is a fruit punch smell. The taste is sweet, but the alcohol is also prevalent and the hops give it a perfumy/metallic taste. Mouthfeel has a dry finish. I didn't like this beer in college, but it is growing on me."
"Loads of good malty sweet flavours - caramel, honey, & toasted. Some sublte dark fruity tones wander around. Decent hopping - woody, spicy, & a little bit herbal. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Overall pretty solid & tasty."
"Pours a deep amber color with a big white head that leaves nice lacing. The smell is fruity esters, with a sweet malt backbone, a nicely done maibock smell. The taste is a Bready and slightly sweet malt followed by a floral hop taste that ends in a citrusy tart bitterness. Overall a quality brew, maybe nothing outstanding but very drinkable and complex enough to satisfy the experienced craft brew drinker. A great session beer"
"Oh well, still a great brew, from the hazy orange pour with ivory head, to the lightly spiced, malty aroma and taste. Hops are lite (IBU 40). Perfectly carbed, lite in the mouth and drinkable for the short or long haul  the 6.5% is craftily hidden."
"I really like this beer. The name is creative and the bottle as well. Pours dark amber with minimal head that doesnt retain very well. The smell is not very powerful and nothing really stood out (except the famous and exclusive (i think) Pacman yeast), but it was still had a very pleasing maltiness tone. I really like the taste of the Pacman so I am partial to most of the Rogue offerings. Very smooth mouthfeel that feels like silk on the tongue and the back of the throat. A very drinkable beer. The price is pretty high here in the South, $10 for a six pack, so I try to savor every ounce of this well crafted brew."
"Paid $4.99 for a 650ml bottle"
"I think that what could have made this beer better would have been more malt balancing to offset the hop bitterness. I am open to the idea that others would prefer the assertive hop character, though. This one was (and is) definitely worth a try."
"I like this much better on-tap than in bottles. Satisfying either way, but on-tap is the way to go if you have the choice."
"Mouthfeel is pretty dry, but it is quite good. I give a 4.5 for drinkability. A very hearty beer. Has just enough bitterness to be interesting while leaving a very clean finish. Well worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is pretty soft leaving you with a dry finish. At first taste my mouth was filled with beer euphoria (something you get when you haven't tasted a really good beer in a really long time). Good beer. I will definitely have to get it again in the near future."
"A good beer from rogue, but nothing to get excited about."
"It seems like everything in this beer is in balance, quite a pleasure to drink. Rogue picked a good beer to be their ""flagship"" brew."
"Pours a somewhat orange tinged amber color. No real head though a good carbonation level. Malty aroma-touch of caramel sweetness. Medium hop bitterness. Good malt flavor. Somewhat dry in the finish. Ok body for style. An average beer overall. I know its popular with some folk but Rogue can and does do better."
"Overall impression: A very enjoyable offering from Rogue - and a great gateway beer to get your friends to drink better beer. This is one of my favorite standby's, and a regular purchase if I'm attending a party."
"In conclusion: Rogue Dead Guy - RECOMMENDED!"
"Nice medium light mouthfeel that adds to the drinkability."
"After making my notes I read other reviews and it looks like we are reviewing 3 or 4 different beers! Perception or reality?"
"Draft...light amber brew with off white head.Malt aroma with some cardboard, faint spice from the hops.I thought the taste was very good it has a smooth malt taste with some caramel ,the hops are subdued but offer some spiciness and floral notes.A easy drinking low hop pale ale"
"Served on tap in a standard pint glass. I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer given the number of times I've had it. Pours a deep dark orange with about 1/2 inch of lasting head. Smell is subdued, but is slightly sweet and fruity. Taste is creamy, smooth, fruity. I think I'd maybe put this more into an ""Alt"" category, but thats me. It tastes almost as if it was served on cask, except on draught. Immensely drinkable, though the fruitiness could get old."
"Beer pours a hazy, dark, golden orange. There wasn't a lot of head, and almost no retention or lacing. The aroma had a light sweetness to it. It reminded me of raisens a lot, mangos too even. In the mouth, it feels very chewy and full. Again there's a lot of sweetness from the malts, tastes almost like honey. The hops aren't in the forefront of this, only a little bitterness at the end. Tastes a lot like a less complex, less grassy/earthy belgian. It's a very full beer, so I don't know if I could have more than two in one sitting, but I'd certainly drink another."
"This is a beer I can, and have, drink/drunk all night long."
"Comments - Interesting that they would make a maibock with pacman ale yeast. From the Rogue web page: ""Maierbock is a German-style Maibock made with Rogue's proprietary 'PacMan' ale yeast-deep honey in color with a malty aroma. Rich hearty flavor and a well balanced finish. Maierbock is created from Northwest Harrington, Klages, Maier Munich and Carastan malts, along with Perle and Saaz Hops."" Although perhaps not entirely to style, this is still a wonderful tasting beer."
"Dead Guy wouldnt be a bad choice when the warmer weather arrives."
"12 ouncer sampled w/o any freshness indication. Pours hazy orangy amber, light tan head, shows moderate retention and leaves moderate lacing. Nose is quite sweet with some fresh fruit aromas. This a sweet and malty brew, some peppery hops in the background. Smooth and highly drinkable, better then average sessioner."
"The drinkablility of the Dead Guy is alright. There is nothing in this brew that is offensive or overpowering. Moreover, there is nothing in this beer that compels me to hustle back to the refrigerator to get another glass. This brew is pleasant but unremarkable. The psychedelia on the bottle is groovy though."
"Poured nice and rich red. Very thin head, that quickly went away. Smelled good, with no smell of alcohol. Tasted of hops and fruit. Not too overly carbonated which is a good thing to me. Sweeter aftertaste, maybe could be a little stronger on flavor. Something that can be a session beer."
"I don't think I could drink much of this at a time but I could see having a hankering for this brew. I'd say give it a go but wouldn't expect everyone to like it."
"Mildly hazy orange color with a medium white head. Aroma is of fruit. It has apples, pears, and a mild citrus character. The malt lends a sweetness to the aroma caramel to accent the apples. These characteristics show up in the flavor too. The apple comes through and the caramel character of the malt. In the flavor a mild toffee character comes through too. The hops lend a pleasant bitterness to the beer. The yeast brings a certain character too. Many people do not care for the flavor lent by the Pac Man yeast, but I thin it comes across well in this beer. It has a mildly slick mouth feel, and is very drinkable."
"I really like this beer, so does the wife. As easy as this is to drink, this could get expensive $$."
"This ale pours a clear amber with a small head that is quickly forgotten. There is a distinct aroma of flowery hops and fruitiness, and a bit of toffee-like sweetness. Taste is of raisins and cashew nuts with the flowery hops on top and the toffee-caramel sweetness underneath. Not much depth of flavor, but not bad. The mouthfeel is a bit diacetyl-oily with smooth finish and inadequate carbonation that is quickly history. Pretty drinkable, but not the best offering that rogue has out."
"Drinkability: This beer didnt wow me, but it was pleasant and goes down easy. I think Id appreciate this beer more if I had 2 or 3. I also remember this beer being much better when I had it last year on tap."
"4-29-05 exhumation and reautopsy reveals origional findings along with a discernable presence of pecan nut flavor at the end. Drinks well @ 40-50° although not a showy head on initial examination, carbonation present in the remains after 20-30 minutes. Last shot of yeast separated for further examination under magnification. Rest in Peace, old friends - I will raise a Dead Guy in your honor."
"A very nice, full-bodied brew. Flavorful like an IPA."
"Pours a dark brown almost amber like color. Smells of Malts, with some hops and fruits. Tastes of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as dry fruits. Has a very pronounced malty taste, with lingering hops. Takes a few sips to really get a feel for this one. But overall a very good beer. I had this in a 22oz bottle a year ago, and it was my first Rogue. I have had many since then. I would definately recomend this beer."
"A nice beer, but the taste of alcohol spoiled some of the experience."
"Nice brew, obviously no killer."
"The first sign that this one's not your standard beer comes when you pour it. It's almost orange/almost red/almost brown. I guess we'll go with ruby, but it looks really interesting in my tulip. Small head that leaves little lace and doesn't retain particularly well. Malty smell with hops, fruit, and a little spice in it. Do I detect nutmeg? I won't swear to that one, though. The taste is also interesting. My first few sips were a big upfront sweetness that wasn't cloying, but close, that settled into a nice hoppy finish that lingered as a hoppy aftertaste. As it warmed for a few minutes out of the fridge, though, the sweetness became less overwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it's still a tasty beer, but it's just a tad out of balance. A very interesting brew that I enjoyed immensely and will not hesitate to try again; worth the hype, if just a tiny bit too malty sweet for me."
"A very unique brew unlike what many may expect. Poured out to a red / amber / golden color that was almost similar to fruit punch. Odor was consistant, with overtones of fruits, nuts and a touch of cinnamon. Suprisingly smooth texture with flavors of sweetness and bitterness. Crisp presentation of flavors was enjoyable, as was the slightly bitter aftertaste that disappeared quickly. Recommended. A very good brew in all aspects, but it can be a bit pricey. I'd say it's worth it, but not everyday."
"Overall- a great ale to sit about and shoot the sh!t with."
"Notes: It's not one of the big, bold-flavored beers from Rogue, but still a decent session beer."
"The appearance is a very cloudy and hazy golden with a very thin white lacing. Both the smell and the taste are absolutely dominated by a sweet malty presence. There is enough hop balance to where I can stand to drink it, but overall I am not too fond of this beer anymore. Perhaps if the malts were slightly roasted, or if the hops bitterness and aromas were more balanced, this would make a hell of a brew, but now that I've walked the path of the hop-side this isn't nearly as quenching as it used to be. Leaves a somewhat dry finish. A good beer to convert macro drinkers though."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle, Dead Guy has a cloudy, red-orange color to it. I love the color, but there wasn't as much head as expected. I didn't give it a very hard pour, though. The beer has a sweet, malty aroma with a hint of fruit to it...very nice. The taste doesn't disappoint. There's plenty of sweet tasting malt in the brew, and there's a nice touch of citrus-like hops behind it that becomes more prominent in the finish. This is a very tasty and very flavorful beer. Dead Guy is the first Rogue beer that I've tried, and I think I'll be giving more of their beers a taste. Excellent stuff."
"All and all a very enjoyable beer and one I will definitely drink again."
"Pours a nice burnt orange or copper color, a nice head with some white lacing, but it is short lived. Taste is where this beer really shines, it's a nice, light caramel apple like taste, some smoky malt and creamy mouthfeel. I liked this beer a lot, but it's a bit heavy so drinkability is questionable."

"This is quite a killer beer. Give me more!"
"Pours a burnt orange color with slight hazy, topped by a creamy white head. It looks remarkably like unused motor oil. The smell is very sweet, caramel and some fruit, along with piney hops and alcohol. The taste starts off sweet and malty smooth with hints of caramel. Hops are pungent and piney, nice balance for the big malt bill. Finish is sweet caramel and alcohol. Pleasant, easy drinking brew."
"Looks like used motor oil and smells sweet and fruity. The first taste is hoppy bitterness followed quickly by malty ester, a little too sweet. Initial hop impression is gone leaving a sweet, alcoholic aftertaste. Thin to medium bodied, good session beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light tan head above the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Head fades pretty quickly, leaving un even layer of bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is deeply of sweet malts, with some dark fruit notes, and a whiff of booze. Taste is everything that was in the nose, all at once. A cacophany of flavors that fits the bill. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. A classic that is always an enjoyable one to revisit."
"Poured a dark, hazy golden body, with a good head, good retention. Aroma of sweet malt, and fruit. Kind of toasty, spicy, fruity and lots of malt sweetness. Could use some more hops to balance. Medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel and quite a session brew."
"Blah. Rogue missed the mark with this one. Too sweet, too malty, and way, way unbalanced. I feel like they just forgot to add any kind of tasty hops. Normally I love Rogue brews, but this is one is just nt my cup of tea. The sweetness really overpowers the other flavors, and winds up destrying what could've been a wonderful brew. Oh well..."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a 2 finger head that lasted a good while. Good lacing. Aroma was faint but a malty smell did come out as well as some hop presence. Some raisin and caramel notes as well. A nice malty flavor hits immediately followed by adequate hop bitterness, hop flavor quickly dissapears and leaves just enough bitterness. Some raisin, caramel, vanilla flavors also detected. Finishes a bit dry and has decent drinkability. Not one for a warm summers day but enjoyable this time of year. A good solid brew."
"This is a hop lovers dream. As I like my balance on the other end of the spectrum (malty)I will not seek this one out before summer and the need to beat the three H's of NJ weather Hazy -Hot - and Humid."
"A perfect beer after a hard day's work. Cheers!"
"What a delightful session beer. Very easy to drink yet extremely flavorful. A nice copper, amber beer with a fluffy white head. The nose presents hops, orange, and cinammon while the taste is a pleasant balance between hops and malt."
"This beer was served on tap and the Yardhouse in Pasadena. The beer came with a nice 2 cm tan head on top and a clear red color. The aroma of this beer was excellent with a sweet caramel and light, summer fruit smell to it. Fresh apple and pear scents along with a refreshing clean malt scent. The flavor starts with a tangy burst of malt up front followed by a nice floral hoppy flavor accompanied by a bit of bitterness. It ends with those same fruity flavors as in the nose along with some sweet but very light cherry flavors. This beer had no sour characteristics to it despite the many fruit flavors. A crisp and clean malt profile makes this an excellent beer to enjoy over and over again...and I did!"
"Poured this beer into a duvel goblet (color reminiscent of Orange Hawaian Punch). The pac man yeast is doing its job and carbonation was perfect. Mostly malt in the nose with hints of honeysuckle. In terms of taste, flavors of malt, rainer cherries, and plums. I love its crisp taste and the beer seems like some kind of barleywine/red ale combo. The 6 percent is well hidden. Well done and I'll be drinking this again soon."
"Pours out a dark amber color 1 finger head,,looks impressive.Nice hop aroma , again very nice. Taste is remarkably balanced between malt and hop,,is decieving,,the higher hop scent had me thinking i had a hop monster but this is very smooth.Nice mouthfeel,,my first rogue beer and im impressed,,good job.Definitely coming back for more."
"Poured a cloudy amber color while making my pint glass sweat from this beers abilities. 1/2"" of head which quickly went down to a thin ring. Clean sides of the glass theorize no lacing on this beer what so ever. Above average carbonation. First tasting of this beer style. Sweet matly beginning which works its way into a low key bitterness. Could drink a 6 pack of these in a night. I like Rogue for brewing this unique style of beer and distributing it so widely. This will definatly expand beer drinkers horizons. Hope to find more varities of this style in the future. Nice glow in the dark bottle. Not my favorite beer or style, but would buy again."
"Another fine beer from rogue"
"Cloudy dark copper under a fairly short-lived off-white one finger head that leaves no lace. Strong sweet malt nose, with a hint of flowery hops and a touch of caramel. The mouth is light and very prickly. Good smooth taste, with lots of sweet malt dominating until the hops come out in the finish. Flowery in nature, the hops are never over the top, just leaving a slight bitterness in the aftertaste, not quite espresso, but a bit more than capucchino. The sweet malt never goes away completely, making this a very easy drinking brew. Too malty to be an IPA, not sweet enough to be an amber, not sure what I'd call this. I guess Maibock is as good as any name."
"Thanks to mrpicklerelish for the opportunity to sample this beer. Poured from a 12 oz bottle, a clear copper with a light buttery-white head. Head fades soon to a light lace that leaves little lacing on the glass. Nose is light flowery hops, sweetness, but subtle. Taste is sweet and malty, offset soon by a bit of hops bitterness that cuts the sweetness and shares finish- I like the balance. Nice carbonation, nice smooth mouthfeel. This beer is easy to drink----wish I had another here right now."
"Great choice that is not too often found at bars in Charlotte, let alone beer specialty stores. Paid $2.50 for a 12 oz. bottle. Nice balance of hops, great snesation in the mouth. Appeared like an amber, very drinkable. Wouldn't mind trying this in a draft as well if available. Catchy name and label."
"Flaky film of head to start, with just a smidgen of lace as the glass became less full. Copper, slightly weak metallic brown hue, but still fathomable. Treacly malt bouquet that seems to be a plaintive, calling aspect overall. Garrulous malt freneticism to taste, with aged pablum, plums, toasted sesame seeds, and light brown sugar sweetness, though hidden. Experienced an upper mouth slam with a back tongue coolness while partaking. Cacophanous malt affords this brew a simple but direct statement of Dont mess with the dead guy, or you'll be dancing with bears!"
"For all those who are not with us today...."
"Drinkability: It has it's own flavor, that's for sure. I don't like the overall taste enough to have another, but that's only because I'm faced with 50 other taps. I see on the website that this beer is ""in the graveyard"" and was brewed for the Aquarium series a few years ago. I guess it's been resurrected in small quantities for the Rogue Publik Houses (such as KClinger's in Etters, PA)."
"This beer taste to good not be drinkable but is probably too rich (and too strong) to drink to many at once."
"Disturbingly easy to handle and consume. Highly pallateable and enjoyable. This would make a nice appetizer to any meal, and would go well with a light salad."
"Reflection: I've been drinking this beer for years and it never lets me down. For Christmas I wrap different styles of beer for my co-workers to try and this one has made the cut for the last five years!"
"Doesnt rank high on the drinkability scale."
"Had this on tap today at the Ale House. This ale doesn't change a whole lot from bottle to tap in my opinion. Maybe because Rogue doesn't pasturize or anything like that? As far as the taste goes, I suppose it could be hopped up more to provide more balance. There certainly is enough delicious fruity malt to handle it. A great fallback."
"Excellent drinkability. Try it."
"This beer pours a reddish brown color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really sweet and a little creamy. It reminds me of a raspberry cream saver candy. The flavir is not right. There is sweet caramel in there, but a really offensive bitter flavor that I don't like. The feel is moderately thick nd a bit creamy. The drinkability suffers from the taste. I really didn't like it all that much."
"A very deceptive 6.5 % ABV beer that is very drinkable. This could make a great session brew for an evening with friends."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a foamy white head that hangs throughout the glass. Fruitty smell with a hint of melon. Tastes of citrusy hops, fruitty esters with a grainy and malty finish. Hint of alcohol in the taste, body is a bit on the thin side but it is a refreshing brew. Pretty drinkable, especially for the alcohol content."
"Mouthfeel is good here....extremely easy to gulp and not too bubbly. Drinkability is great here as well...tasty and goes down smooth. A good session option IMHO. The Dead Guy is worth a try!"
"Very tasty, and very drinkable beer. Goes down smooth and easy, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste."
"This is my first time trying this beer, i have been working my way through the Rogue brewery beers. I am pleasently suprised by the smooth yet complex taste.. A nice touch of bitter and a deep flavour with a touch of smokiness. The aroma is also as deep as the taste. I recommend this one as almost a dark wheat taste."
"Funny how I've had this beer so many, many times and am yet to review it. It might be getting close to the lead for most reviews - I make number 441. Pours from the 22oz bottle a slightly hazy, orangish-amber hue with a small head that subsides quickly. Pleasant aroma of floral, bitter hops, plum, and a touch of roasted malt. Sturdy, slightly foamy body holds a well-balanced palate of lightly roasted malt, lightly bitter hops, and an underlying taste of fruit (plums, grapes). A tad bitter on the finish. While not my favorite beer, it's a good, consistent presence in my fridge. Dead Guy is also a wonderful fallback in many places where the selection may otherwise be Big 3 macro swill."
"Nice, malty, yet easy to drink beer. Beware of the alcohol. It is very smooth for a beer of 6.5% abv. It's a perfect choice for Halloween."
"Poured from a standard 330 ml bottle. Lots of almost white foam that has lasted until the end of the glass. A cloudy medium reddish brown colour with some orange hues. Smells of malt and caramel, with some citrusy notes. The taste is also malty, but a little too light, with a bit of a fruity finish and very clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very nice, fullbodied and smooth. This beer is quite good, tasty and with a high drinkability factor. Although its 6.5% ABV it does not taste like so and would therefor be an excellent session beer. Picked up a 6 pack in Illinois that works out to be about $10 CDN, so overall an excellent deal for such quality beer. Very recommended."
"Dark cloudy red brown, with almost nothing in terms of head after moments. Nose is low malts and spice. Roasted cinnamon. Taste, too, has a cinnamon sweetness. Nice, isolated compact hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Combination of sweet and bitter leveled in the excellent mouthfeel, thick and bodyful. Carbonation bubbles away softly until the taste is ransacked by the hops. Not my favorite Rogue beer as far as taste goes, but great complexity and drinkability."
"Nothing amazing about the appearance; standard brownish-amber color, bit of head on there. What can I say, it looks like a beer. But it smells great. This is a straight-up ale. Sometimes I find a lot of ales that are pretty hoppy, more like a pale ale, but this one is true to style, more like a bock or something. A mild, sweet aroma. That sweetness definately comes out in the taste, quite malty and ""spring"" tasting. I can picture a bunch of skeletons brewing this stuff up in Oregon. Feels very smooth and creamy (but not thick) in the mouth. I could drink this shit till I'm dead. Sorry that was lame. Let's just say that this is a solid, well balanced, and outstanding beer. Good bye."
"I had never had this brand before and was lucky enough for a fellow BA to bring this over to my place. This beer poured an autumn brown with a good head. It's aroma definitely was enticing with a floral hops character. It's taste was extremely smooth, which some might say as a macro beer slogan, but definitely isn't a bad thing. It was just the right sweetness with just the right bitter of hops. It felt great in the mouth not too thick not too thing. This is a beer I could drink more than one, but it's a little higher in alcohol so how much more is another question."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a slightly turbid bronzy copper color with a nice light beige head. Malty, rich and fruit-like and candy-like hop aromas in the aroma. Malt sweetness hits the palate like a ton of bricks, mixed with some plum-skin like fruitiness, and the hops work well to counterbalance the sweet malt. The hops are pungent, but the malt is moreso. This has always been a very nice beer. An interesting hybrid between the maltiness of a bock and the hoppiness of many West Coast beers (this being one of them). Works out well."
"This is quite a tasty beer. It pours an amber color with a fair amount of lace. It smells of sweet, fruity malt. This is certainly not an overhopped ale like many of the popular west coast ales, as the taste is more dominated by the malty sweetness. I taste a very slight tropical fruit taste too, which is quite intriguing. The carbonation cleans the palate quite nicely. I would have no problem drinking many of them...it is a very drinkable beer."
"Quite a drinkable brew - good flavor, wonderful color and an inviting nose. What more could you want?"
"Very tasty brew here, one I could happily sip all day (or night actually) long."
"Wow, I'm really glad I got around to trying this beer. Dead Guy Ale pours a dark and slightly hazy amber color. The head is light brown and lightly creamy. Head height is average. Smell is nice and malty. It has that sweet, bready aroma. Taste is excellent! Flavor is initially malty sweet, then the nice, slightly bitter hops kick in and really balance this brew out. Finish is a tasty, sweet blend of hops and malts. It seems like every sip I notice something new about this beer. Mouthfeel is right on, and drinkability only suffers from the filling nature of Dead Guy Ale. For me this beer is a ""must try""."
"(Maybe this is how a maibock is supposed to taste; your mileage may vary.)"
"The smell was lightly of malt with a hint of hops. When tasting the malt comes through with a light hop taste. Lightly sweet. The body is medium to light. This is an easy drinking beer that I could have several in one sitting."
"Pours a deep coppery orange color with a firm white head about an inch thick that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Aromas consist of sweet caramel, some toasty malts, and a bit of zesty hop. Initial flavors consist of a bit of citrus flavoring followed by a wide arrange of malts which leave a multitude of flavors ranging from toffee, to biscuit, some caramel sweetness, and a doughy bread like flavor. There is also a nice estery yeast flavor in the mix which really adds some complex flavors to the brew. The finish is quite citrusy and zesty from a nice strong hop finish. Overall this brew is light to medium bodied with a refreshingly crisp carbonation that is almost biting on the tongue."
"I didn't expect to like this one, but what a surprise!, copper color, sturdy head, malty and dried fruit in the bouquet, strong hop in the mouth, well balanced by malt and fruit complexity. Mouthfeel was a treat, very effervescent and foamy, higher carbonation than expected, I could drink many"
"This beer has a clean amber color with a small beige head. The aroma is lightly malty with a hint of grapefruit in the background. The taste has a serious sharp hop bitterness with, again, a hint of grapefruit sweetness somewhere in the middle. Has a crisp finish."
"dead guy ale pours a copper color w/ a small head that fades to a ring.smell is slightly hoppy with stong malt in front. laced the glass nicely. taste was unimpresive. Think that the bottle is bad. extemely bitter, acrid taste. kind of like soda water with bitters added. surrely a bad bottle. with no way to tell age it is hard to tell how old this crap is. huge dissapointment. will re review when a fresh sample can be obtained."
"Love the name of this beer, was always curious what it tasted like. Great aroma. Lots of citrus fruits that are balanced nicely by the malts. Nice, balanced, fruity taste as well. Very easy on the palate and highly enjoyable. A must try."
"Just the right amount of carbonation and smoothness in the mouthfeel. Very high drinkability, and a recommended brew for those who dont normally go for the hoppy stuff but still want something with a little bit of bite."
"Full bodied, goes down like butter. High alcohol %, though, and since it's so smooth it's easy to drink too many of these..."
"Dead Guy is not bad. Not bad at all. The pint I was served had almost no head, limited carbonation, and no lace whatsoever. It was a flat bronze color, clear but without luster. It had a light aroma of sweet malts and an adequate mouthfeel, but was nowhere up to Rogues customary high standards. It tastes well balanced and clean with a rounded malt profile and a punctual finish. But as the name might suggest, the Dead Guy lacks vitality."
"Very drinkable for a beer that heavy. The light carbonation might have something to do with it."
"Drinkability: Ok for me. Seemed very filling and I'm not sure if I could have more than one of these in a sitting. A good representation of the style and certainly a well made brew but I probably won't be back for more."
"The taste is bold and oaky but very smooth, not over-powering. It sits well on the tongue and new flavors emerge as you easily hold it for more of a taste. One quick bite as it goes down and the glass comes up for another drink."
"Overall a solid, great tasting beer that's easy to drink and a good representation of the style."
"Pours a cloudy, dark amber with a dense head that dissipates quickly. Smells of sour apples, cherries and caramel malt - yum. Taste is plenty malty but is balanced nicely by spicy hops as well. Candy-esque tastes show through in different capacities as you drink it and it warms; whether it's the reported ""cotton candy"" or caramel apples. Finishes mildly bitter. On the tongue, it's medium to full and ever so smooth. A blanket of gentle carbonatin soothes the tongue. A great, highly drinkable, classic American micro that should be tried at least once by all. There's always room for some in my fridge."
"Wyll-"
"Like most of Rogue's stuff, this fails to impress me. I think I am narrowing it down to their odd bittering hoppage and the boring yeast. A good beer but not one that I am likely to return to."
"Cloudy, light amber with a small head. Smells bready, with clean hops. Taste is malty, with some hop presence and a very nice, solid bitter finish. Good mouthfeel, a little hop oily. Very good drinkability, good both as a session and with food. Very nice, classic beer overall, but this may be an old bottle..."
"That said, it's outstanding with a meal (I'd put it with thick soups, pasta, deli sandwiches, etc) and great as a nightcap at the end of a session."
"Overall this is one good beer, its so easy to drink, that the alcohol sneaks up on you."
"Rusty orange-brown in color with a small white head, the Dead Guy doesn't have a very strong smell, just a bit malty. The beer itself is quite tasty though, a sweet mix of malt, caramel and orange peel with a silky texture and a nice fruitygrainy finish. I've always liked this beer, they still print these occasionally with an orange version of the dead-guy label that glows in the dark, don't know if that was an annual Halloween stunt or what but it's cool."
"Tried this one on a suggestion from an IPA lover. It had a orange honey color, kind of cloudy. Held a decent head throughout the glass. Smell was somewhat fruity. Taste was sweeter than expected. Made me think of crisp, sweetness. Not too hoppy, but just enough. Is that possible from someone who usually drinks dark stouts? Maybe my tastes are changing. Maybe it's just summer, and hot, but I enjoyed this one a lot! And will definetly drink it again."
"had this awhile back and forgot to review it..its definitely a good, classic beer and worth a try if you havent yet..."
"Not particulary my favorite style, but still a fine beer and one I would order again."
"I could drink this beer all day. I find it very satisfying. I had it served in a bottle and the bartender walked away before I could get a glass. It is quite hoppy, but not overhwelmingly so, almost bittersweet. The carbonation is mild and actually what I think makes this beer so good. The aroma has hints of banana. The taste also has hints of fruit, but I've never been able to decide exactly what."
"I'm a big fan of this, very drinkable, very moreish, so drinka ble"
"Finishes like it started, bitter but interesting. Not immensely drinkable to my tastes. This is a good beer, but it fails to get the maibock style completely right, IMO. I'll give it a go again sometime, but I'm not sold on it as a mainstay of my regimen."
"This is one complex ale. The sugar in the nose is apparent (like a sarsparilla candy cane), but there is also a smoky yet suppleness to this one. The hops are present, but muted (to my liking). This is excellent stuff. I don't get enough Rogue in my diet, and need to drink more!"
"Note: I've had this beer several times on tap, and absolutely love it, though I am not very impressed by the bottle offering."
"Had this on tap at Dr. Dremos. Dead Guy came out a dark amber color with not much head to it, probably due to the bartender more than the beer. The aroma has a pleasant hoppy citrus smell with creamy malt and fruity smell to go along. Taste starts off with a bitter hoppiness with spiciness to it. A nice creamy malt flavor on the back to provide some balance. It has a nice mouthfeel and is very drinkable. Has enough complexity to keep you coming back and it would make for a good session beer"
"The name is intriguing even though I'm not much of a bock afficianado; nontheless I figured I'd give it a shot. The Dead Guy Ale pours a honey-caramel colour with an off-white head that--I'm not kidding--has a green tint to it. The hops come first to the nose, but underneath are some pines and light grape and citrus tints. The taste is excellent; very complex, but balanced. It starts off with a nutty sharpness, mostly hops but a little sweet too, and there's some good strong bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is medium and heavily carbonated."
"Dark amber brown with a small bit of quickly receding head. Smell is very nice, with some buttery pine nut flavors overlapping malts and hops on the back. Taste is much the same, with similar components. Mouthfeel is light and sharp with good amounts of carbonation. Feels perfect on the back of the pallate. It is crisp and refreshing, but it has plenty of flavor hidden within it to make it quite a good beer for a warm summer evening."
"Poured out golden with a decent head that was nice and creamy. Sugary scent, malts, vanilla... Great bite with pepper and hops, alcohol. Very nice one. This is one beer that I have always ordered when seeing it on a beer menu, as far back as I can remember, knowing that it has remained consistant."
"Pours a slightly murky dark copper color with a yellowed off-white head that starts off at a couple fingers, but quickly fades to a lasting 1/4 inch layer of foam. Very little lacing on the glass. Smell is of sweet malts with a little bit of citrusy hop aroma. Taste includes sweet, bready malt, a little fruityness, and nice citrus rind-piney hop flavors. Very well balanced. Lingering hop bitterness, but it's not at all harsh, Very smooth and drinkable. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with medium body. Carbonation is apparent, but not over-done. Upon finishing the first one, I immediately wanted another! Not exactly to style... but who cares! Highly recommended and sure to become one of my regulars."
"I hate to say this, but I waited way too long to try this beer, being an Oregon native and all. Perhaps this is one of the better beers to share with the fizzy-yellow beer crowd in hopes of converting them to the true beer way."
"Hops give way to sweet malt and alcohol in the mouth, buried in a smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel. The sweetness takes over quickly, pretty much obliterating any hop bitterness. Malt lingers in the aftertaste, with hints of chocolate, smoke, and hay. For reasons unknown to me if I try to drink more than three of these in a night I wake up with a headache, which reduces the drinkability score somewhat. Certainly not without its charm, but not a whole not here to distinguish it from other microbrews."
"An intriguing beer that is not quite an ale, and not quite a lager, or both. There is a smoky element, perhaps from the yeast, that this beer has in common with Anchor Steam (a similarly in-between beer). Also like Anchor Steam, I've found this beer can be wonderful if fresh and well-kept, and blah if not. This is a good, fresh sample. I like the Day of the Dead theme but the Grateful Dead association is a little much. A disconcerting, and intriguing murky copper, with good head that doesn't stick around, minimal lacing. The aroma isn't much, it's pretty invisible. The beer itself is a nice blend of caramel malts, honey, bread, light smoke, gently tangy citric hops. It's almost like a Munich-style helles cross-pollenated with a hoppy Pacific Northwest pale ale. Fine stuff."
"notes: Nice beer to drink, good combination of flavors but I wish it had a bit more complexity. Not much seemed to jump out flavor wise. My first Maibock."
"The taste is another story. It is a very flavorful bock with mostly roasted maltiness and some real underlying hops kick. It is bubbly in the mouth, but still manages to be creamy. I really enjoyed this first foray with the Dead Guy."
"Once the head settles, it looks more a glass of tea. The body thins as it warms up and the alcohol becomes more evident."
"A fine beer, I would definitely have this again."
"A very good beer, I will have to request more of it be ordered as I had the last six pack in the store."
"A fine ale. Pours an intermediate amber color. A nice white head forms but does not last. There is however nice lacing throughout the duration. Tastes absolutely wonderul: a some what sweet malty caramel nicely balanced with a hint of bitter. This is something worth searching out. A highly drinkable beer. Enjoy!"
"There's almost a hint of green apple in the smell and taste. I like it. I'm not sure how it got in there but it seems to fit nicely. The flavor is good and blends the alcoholic content very well, resulting in an easily drinkable beer."
"Amber in colour with a hint of gold. Hops on the nose mixed with a slight fruityness. Hoppy flavor with a good malt backing, leaves bitter. Crisp and easy drinking. I can, and will, drink this all day long."
"This is a so-so Rogue."
"Beer is good. Dead or alive. Happy beering."
"Well-rounded, awesomely balanced brew."
"On Tap in NYC at the Blind Tiger Ale House. Coppery/reddish body with a thin white head. Aroma is fruity and tea like. I specifically smelled grapes. Taste is definitely on the hoppy side of things. Good pale malt backbone. Strong hop bitterness throughout. A full and smooth mouthfeel. This beer is close to IPA territory."
"I will definitely be making a return trip for more of these, in fact I wish I wouldve picked up a sixer instead of a bomber. Theres always next time. In fact, now I know why they keep cases of this one by the door!"
"Great session brew, but perhaps not with taco salad. Live and learn."
"This is the beer that really got me searching more than ever for better beers. Had it at a deep dish pizza place that had the first beer list I ever saw. I admit I was drawn by the name but came back for the taste. While it almost made my girlfriend sick (she dislikes beer in general), I enjoyed it. It's a good one."
" well I''ve found that this is also a great beer prelude to bluegrass as well as classical. I truly, truly enjoy this beer. I also had the good fortune to have pints from a fresh keg - this is one quaffable drinkable beer. additional comments- really smooth, nutty mouthfeel. I love the sweet hoppiness and the dark distinct, medium to full body. this is almost a combination stout-ipa or porter ipa, but way better than any black & tan that I've ever had. truly wonderful beer and a favorite."
"This is my first experience with the Maibock style. Pours a solid orange, quite an unusual and interesting color for a beer, with average head. Smells like a pilsner, hoppy and ""crisp"". An excellent taste, pacman hops provide an unique and subtle bitterness, semisweet, with a hint of jasmine perhaps? A fun and refreshing brew."
"Already tons of reviews for this beer, so I'll spare the unabridged review. Just wanted to note the (very subtle) flavor of cotton candy I noticed in this beer. (anybody else pick that up?) And, call me crazy, but I see this as being a near perfect session beer. Very, very drinkable, yet it has the complexities to keep one interested for some time. Give me this stuff and just watch it disappear."
"i give dead guy the nod. i look foward to trying more maibocks in the future. this beer kinda reminded me of hopdevil ale, sans spiciness. the negatives for this beer would be that it could have been more bold, and the the aftertaste can be rough to the point were it interferes with the taste of your next sip, gulp, whatever. i have to say though, this beers positives far outweigh the negatives. good beer for a cool fall or spring night."
"This is a very drinkable and refreshing beer that didn't let me down, given how ledgendary it is. I'm glad I finally got to try it."
"Finally picked up this legendary beer. My expectations were kind of high and I guess i was a little dissapointed with it. Pours a nice red/brown color with a small white head that was tinged with beige. Smell is faint but it is sweet and malty. Taste is more of the same. The malt is more easily perceived than the hops and the finish is slightly sweet like Xingu. This beer feels a little bit thin to me, but i suppose the drinkability is decent. This is just a good beer, not great, not bad, but good."
"Overall a pretty drinkable beer that has a unique taste and good mouthfeel."
"Dark orange-copper color, medium white head. Smells of malt, but more dominated by hops. Big malt. Big hops. Very satisfying beer that is refreshing, and flavorfull at the same time. Pine and citrus are also in the flavor. I thought it was a pale ale, but it apparently a pale bock (according to this site). Very delicious, all-around."
" I'll admit to avoiding this Rogue ale, out of superstition. After having one, at last, it seems an ideal spring ale. This would be a near perfect ESB, if it were brewed with English hops."
"Cloudy amber with a rich white head, fairly good retention for the alcohol content. Moderate malty aroma. Light-bodied, slight carbonation, could be a bit more assertive for the style. Pale malt flavors, hops just enough to balance, subtle fruity tones. Sweet going down, and is that hops I feel? Barely noticable. Clean finish with an interesting profile on the way down, quite likeable and distinctive enough to make this stand out. Good example of the style."
"Tastes pretty good with sweet caramel buttery notes and good hop bitterness. May be better with some more hops to balance out the sweetness a little (but I guess thats why they made the Brutal Bitter ;-). Overall it's a good beer across the board, and drinkable enough to have a few. May also be a little better if chilled a little more."
"Had it a year later on tap, found it sour but decent. Had it again on tap in May 2005 at Eulogy's and it was above average."
"This brew is very drinkable and I am sure I will enjoy it with the pizza I am about to eat."
"Taste is quite fruity and malty. Yeasty and sweet pale malt. Lots of floral hops up front with an understated but strident hoppy bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with a nice bitter aftertaste. Pretty good but I thought I would like this more."
"It is a dark gold color. The aroma is fruity and hoppy. The body is malty, but not too thick with some fruitiness (orange and mango). It has a crisp hoppy finish. The added fruitiness from the top fermenting yeast is nice, but it comes across as a very drinkable Maibock."
"Very drinkable brew, tasty and full of flavor without any defects."
"Pours a hazy amber with a nice white haed that falls to a thin ring of foam.Sweet dark fruity aroma, intense malt flavor with strange fruity presence ends in a nice hop flavor and bite. Never had a ale with quite this taste before. Not bad, but not something I would buy on a regular basis, but definitely something worth trying."
"After thinking this, you taste it and realize you are correct. What is interesting about this beer is that its flavor opens up rather slowly. A slow released change that includes complexities of bitter, sweet and alcohol."
"hazy dark amber. light and airy sizable head. substantial amount of bubbles racing towards the top...some lace manages to coat the glass. aleish fruitiness with a light leafy hoppiness on the nose. sturdy medium body, chewy and pleasant. pleasantly sweet fruity malt flavors mingle harmoniously with a crisp hop oiliness. characteristic rogue flavor underneath. finishes slightly dry. eminently quaffable. this may be my top session ale of all time. unbeatable in its sheer quaffing pleasure. i need to drink more of this. now."

"Features an outstanding mouthfeel- full, buttery, and smooth, but not heavy in the least. Quite drinkable and something I am glad to have experienced."
"Honey color, slight head, a really beautiful beer. Definite sweet aroma, crisp hops also, slight citrus too. Sits very smooth in mouth, not too heavy, perfect amount of carbonation. Slight sweet taste, like honey, followed by a crisp, slightly bitter hop element. Very nice brew, could definitely drink a few, will definitely buy again."
"Purchased this in the 1 pint, 6 fluid ounce / 650mL size bottle. Poured a medium reddish brown. Now let me say this. I tried the Chocolate stout from Rogue about 6 months ago and it was just really not for me. I really didn't care for it, to be tactful and polite. But many people have been saying that I absolutely had to try the Dead Guy and boy were they right! Wow! The taste is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. It's a little bitter at first. And I mean a LITTLE bitter. It goes down smooth, and then a few seconds after you swallow, it leaves a faint taste of caramel. Almost no carbonation to speak of make this one real easy to drink, but if you pay attention to it and are looking for it, when you first take a sip, it's a tiny, tiny bit thick which makes it something you wouldn't want to kill a whole lot of in a sitting. Nevertheless, I'll be buying this stuff again!"
"Nice smooth mouthfeel that is slightly creamy. Drinkability is very good. While not an every day choice for me, this is a beer I always enjoy. Was one of the favorites with my old co-workers and I can see why."
"Rogue Dead Guy Ale is a supreme beer. The apperance is exceptional, gold honey in color, the usual amber color. The head was a gorgeous cream color that lasted the whole way through. The smell is of malts with caramel and a fruity scent. The taste is good, very good. The hops are very present in this beer, not to much though, sweet caramel malt aftertaste. Fells full and colorful in the mouth. A very drinkable beer. When you want a good ale don't look any farther that Dead Guy Ale."
"Mouthfeel: There is decent carbonation in this beer. It makes it very drinkable. A very mild beer that I would have again."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle, Rogue Dead Guy Ale was rich copper in color and topped by a small off-white head that left excellent lacing. The nose presented a rich but delicate roasty malt aroma and a light resiny hop profile. The taste resembled a subdued barleywine, with a firm rich roasty malt body, light and zippy citrus notes, and a big bitter finish with lingering roastyness. All of this was well balanced and held up by an appropriately full body. Dead Guy is a full flavored session beer, good for the roasty-bitter fan."
"Taste: Crisp in the mouth, but doesent attack. Perfectly hoppy (for me). The hops lets you know it's there right at the begining and then exits the stage very gracefully. A little sweet right after the hops. I would guard this one till the death, just are our character does on the bottle."
"This is a very drinkable brew, but just not as bold as I would like. It might make a decent session beer for someone with less bold tastebuds, but after two pints, I would probably want to switch up."
"On draught at the MoJoe Lounge at Easton. Pours a clear reddish-amber color with a thin skeleton-bone head. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma is mildly citrusy hops along with a touch of spice. Medium body, with a somewhat flavorable blend of floral hops, citrus, honey and spice. The flavor is kind of like Arrogant Bastard's ""Mini Me"". The finish is mildly bitter making this for an all-around good-drinking beer."
"This is a cloudy amber color with orange hues and a little head that lingers. There is a smell of lightly roasted malts and a nice touch of hops. The taste is of a sweet fruitiness and a good balance of hops. There is an almost candy like taste to this beer but it is very drinkable. This is a quality product that I will never get tired of. Aftertaste is a nice blend of hops and malts that leaves a great feeling on your tastebuds."
"Rogue puts out good stuff and this is no exception, possibly one of their best."
"Dead Guy Ale may be the most ubiquitous craft brew in this city. Every store that carries beer seems to carry it. It's obvious that it's a quality offering, but it doesn't stand out as exceptional. Even though I'll probably drink it again, it won't be anytime soon."
"A great session beer."
"Slightly hazy amber color with a thin off-white head and a sweet malt aroma with a nice balance of hops. A full but not heavy mouthfeel fits extremely well with the malt upfront and hop flavor/bitterness finish. The taste lingers a long time, with more of the sweetness than the bitterness in the linger. Easy drinking and quite good, I really enjoyed this brew."
"While I prefer a less hoppy beer, I found this to be a pleasant change. The taste was there, but was enjoyable without a strong aftertaste."
"Ahh, Dead Guy. At a tasting seminar once I had asked the woman at the Rogue table for one of these. She promptly told me that this beer was so yesterday. Well, I must disagree. This was one of my first introductions to the world of better beer, and still holds its own today. This version poured a bit hazy in appearance. The color is an orangey-amber and the head was thin. The aroma is full with sweet fruity malts and has a touch of spiciness. The taste is of light malts and leans towards the sweet fruit side rather than the bitter. There are some citrus and lemony hops in there, but are well disguised by the sweet malt. Alcohol is hidden well under a blanket of flavors. Very lively and highly drinkable."
"This is for sure a malt lovers beer, but it has a very good ammount of bitterness to interest the hop heads as well. It poured a copper color with a decent head that left nice spider webs on the glass. The smell was fruity and malty and I couldn't wait to taste. The flavor was great, with a thick mouthfeel that fit the malty flavor perfectly. But just when you think its all malt the hops came in and added a great element to the flavor. Even my Coors drinking dad loved this one, so this is a very drinkable beer and would be a good one to start novices on."
"Deep orange-copper with a lively tan head which dissipated but leaving foam laced on the glass. Aroma is quite floral, almost grassy. Flavour is big on malt and hops which balance themselves well in spite of dominating the palate in no uncertain terms; a 'tangy', bold beer with much character. Aftertaste is dry and malty, hops are in evidence more to the finish leaving a pronounced bitterness that subsides slowly."
"ng"
"Poured out a dark orange/copper color. Reminded me of Victory's Moonglow, looks somewhat similar. Poured out a decent head but went away very quickly. Nice lacing around the glass. Smell of plums come to mind, also some sort of sweetness aroma but can't put my finger on what it is exactly (exotic fruits? can't be sure). Taste is a little surprising. At first there seems to be no body to it, but later on there's a nice medium body to it, very nice, I like that. Good malt backbone to this beer as well. There's a bitter aftertaste as well, but in a good way. I like how this beer is put together. I can see why Rogue is proclaimed. I would recommend this beer."
"a hearty ale that is a great selection on a chilly winter day. it'd be hard to pair this with food because the taste is so complicated and demands a great deal of attention."
"Overall, nothing outstanding but can definitely do worse."
"A brilliant brew by Rouge, one i'd be glad to quaff any day of the week."
"I enjoyed this one, but was slightly dissapointed. I had it about 6 months ago, before discovering BA and its world of wonderful beers, and I absolutely loved it. I'm talking top 5 beer material. It's definitely not that anymore, but still a solid beer I will have again. Rogue continues to impress!"
"Had on tap at Redbones, although I have had it on tap in the past at other places around Beantown. Pour was a clear dark amber, with minimal head. Clean sweet aroma. I thought the mouthfeel was very pleasant and well-rounded. Sharp carbonation was also detected. Taste leaned towards the sweet, and I kept thinking I could pick up the alcohol in this one. A nice treat from Rogue. pat"
"At first I thought this was a mild ESB. Very earthy taste and smell. Bitterness all around, due to the hops and the aroma. Poured with a nice head that dissipated slowly into a light head and eventually disappeared with traces of lacing along the side of the glass. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit bubbly. I like the earthy aftertaste. It's not overbearing like some ESB's, but still keeps you aware of the bitterness. I can't quite put my finger on it, but this is one you keep drinking in order to try and figure it out, but with the smooth mouthfeel giving way to the bitter, it's almost as if the beer is teasing you to pinpoint it's definitive taste. The bitterness is a mild, but not astringent, bitterness that I generally associate with root vegetables. I'll be looking for this in the bottle..."
"My boss actually purchased this beer about a month ago for our new office. The first thing I thought was ""Wow this taste just like many solid Octoberfest beers."" Huge malt background with some citrus notes coming though. Malt, clove, earth, raisin, orange and nutmeg flavors all coming through. Dry in the end with the flavor dropping right off. A great beer that I will look for time and time again."
"This is a nice beer that serves as both a single bottle sipper and as a possible session beer (even with the rich malt quality)."
"I have to start by saying I really liked the art on the label. That being said, this beer had a great appearance. Poured a deep amber, decent sized head, many bubbles. The smell was nice too, very hoppy, almost reminded me of Victory Hop Devil. The taste was also very hoppy, a bit toasty and sweet. The sweetness seemed to be well balanced with the hops though, if not dominated by the hoppiness. Mouthfeel was good, medium bodied, very drinkable. I would buy this again defiantly, I was extremely pleased."
"Glad i waited for tonight to have this one."
"A significant front of hop bite gives way to a very broad and caramel maltiness. Not cloying. I guess at 6.5% this could qualify as a bock. Alcohol is subtle. An excellent quaffing beer."
"This is a favorite of mine, I find it highly drinkable"
"What a Rogue! Dark cloudy amber was this brew with a small off-white head that diminished fairly quickly but left nice lace. Lovely nose full of malt and caramel, hinting of a fruity hop overlay. The taste is very good, being full of malt, but beautifully restrained by the clean fruity hops. Nicely bitter and full bodied, this is creamy, smooth drinking beer. Easy drinkability."
"Bottle: Deep copper colored brew with a nice white head with good retention skill. Complex mix of malts and hops that is hard to defined but easy to enjoy. Sweet aroma and taste with a bitter aftertaste. This is very good and the bottle design is excellent! Will be looking into trying more of the Rogue product."
"This was an interesting beer with a cool looking bottle. Poured a deep red color with a bubbly head. Plum on the nose. The initial taste I got from this was plums. Some roasted caramel was noticed later. More sweet fruits came and went. Not too much in the line of hops but I think that's because of the style. The smoothness of this beer made it go down easily. All in all a solid beer but lower on the Rogue totem pole of beers."
"Gorgeous, clear, dark red/amber color. Small, off-white, dense, thick foamy head leaves a few spots of lacing. Sweet deep malt, creamy aroma. Hops jump in right away with a touch of fruit. Deep, almost chocolatey malt takes over quickly: creamy, thick. Very bitter finish... creamy malt survives through the end. This is a special beer. The huge hop bitterness is a little unexpected among the dark, creamy malt. It's an unusual bimodal taste, but a real winner."
"Also, my boys love the bottle. They want more so we can use them for Halloween decorations in the garage next year."
"Rogue can keep this truckin' up to Buffalo for as long as they want."
"An all-around fine brew. Nice caramel color with a head that dissipated quickly, but left a nice lacy residue. Fruity smell that was not overwhelming. Nice rounded feel with a light sweetness followed by a slightly tart finish. Slightly oily with a medium to full body. Some alcohol undertones. Recommended, refreshing brew."
"I don't know if the Ale name is very appropriate, seemed more like a Lager."
"This beer is well balanced and has a good body The high ABV is a bonus, unfortunately Dead guy is too sweet for me."
"First time trying a Rogue beer and was really looking forward to it, maybe had hopes too high but this beer seemed fairly average. There didn't seem to be anyhting particularly compelling about this beer, nothing up front on the pallate, nothing lingering on the back end to make me look forward to the next bottle (not that I didn't have another though). The bottle was very cold to start and the flavors opened up as the beer warmed up. I felt it was a good brew though and representative of its style, just not a knockout."
"Pours a translucent copper color with a monsterous head that is semi-creamy and off white in color, a thick and sticky sheet of lace clings mightly to the glass. Sweet malt, plum like, crisp, fresh and pleasing to the senses, start is ambrosial, thickly malt, the top is moderate in feel. Finish is dynamically hopped, moderate acidity, aftertaste somewhat bitter and long lasting."
"a good a beer. i would recommend it to anyone."
"Drinkability - Not a beer you can chug, nor would you want to. It's so tasty it's gone before you know it, though. Once the 'macro' guys at the Halloween party got a little pissed up enough to try this, they really liked it! Beer advocacy continues..."
"Golden to amber. Pours with a lot of foam that slowly fades. Smooth mouthfeel. Body is a little light for a Maibock. The strength of this brew is evident. Starts malty and with notes of vanilla on the palate and in the aroma. Malty with a spike of hoppiness towrards the finish and fairly bitter finish for a bock, but this is sort of expected from a Northwestern brewery. Doesn't seem as balanced as it did the other day. Seems more bitter and the flavors seem just a little brighter. This Dead Guy still not as lively as on previous occasions, but I guess you can't ask too much from a dead guy, eh?"
"Update - I happened upon this again in 2010 and found it to be much more malty. The malt base is unsweetened and very raw. I think really it needed this to balance the big hop bit. It's almost like unsweetened caramel if that's not an oxymoron. It's a solid 4 all the way around and a definite ""must try"" for any beer enthusiast."
"Excellent beer that borders the boundaries between being a bock bier and an ESB. Cant really classify between the two. Pours a white fluffy head that dissipates to form a sticky lace with a dark amber color. Slight citrus hop smell with goes along with a caramely malt. Tastes superb with a slight toasty caramely malt to accent the hoppiness. A slight fruity ester flavor comes threw but is not dominating. Highly drinkable but alcohol will kick in after two or so."
"The smell pulled me in. A soft citrus smell prepared my sences for what what was about to come. I took a sip, The orange/amber colored ale was just as fruity as the smell had me expecting. Very easy going down, very smooth and refreshing."
"I just cracked the top off of this one, so I could review as I enjoy this. Nice label, especially since today is Halloween. This poured a nice clear dark copper/garnet color. The head is pretty thin with no lace around the large goblet that I'm drinking it from. The aroma is pretty malty, maybe caramel, with litter to no hop presence. The taste has a large malt presence up front with a little brown sugar hint. Great finishing hops presence makes this one finish clean and balances it out at the end. Good mouthfeel with medium carbonation. This is very drinkable and at 6.5% will make a damn good session beer. Great job by Rogue and I can't wait to go back and get the Shakespeare & Brutal."
"This must be the least enjoyable Rouge ""ale"" I have had so far...It looks ok, deep golden orange hue with thin, soapy head. The aroma is very pleasant with a nice balance of sweet toasted malt and domestic (that's USA) hops. The flavor is just plain weird to me. I don't know what it is but there is something... I dunno... ""green"" tasting about the combination of hoppiness and sweet malt in the middle. Finishes with a sweetish, smoky flavor that continues with the oddness. What is most odd about this ""ale"" is that it is not an ale at all. It is a Maibock, which is a German lager beer. It is as much an ale as Bill Cosby is a young white dude."
"Drinkability: A nice house beer, which has character and somewhat broad appeal."
"Pours a clear copper with a nice sized tan head that lasts fairly well, and laces quite nicely. Aroma is lightly malty (fruity, plums?), and strongly hoppy (floral, pine, grapefruit). Flavor starts with some dark fruitiness, and ends with a very strongly hopped finish, good bitterness. Medium-full bodied, light notes of alcohol poke through towards the end."
"I'm gonna run off and tell all my friends about this one. Great beer."
"Very nice."
"This beer is a dark orange color, with a small and fleeting tan head atop it. Sweet malts and bubblegum are what she reeks of. This is a very sweet, malty drink, with the hops adding their two cents in the back. Seems like a pretty well put together beer. Not my all time favorite though."
"Drinkability: one a day wouldn't be too much. a pleasant everyday drinker."
"Dark copper in color, quickly dissipating head. Very nice sweet sugary malty aromas with hints of tropical fruits. Lightly toasted sweet malts up front with more sweet malts in the middle. Then a kiss of hops, flowery hops, and a nice smooth finish. A great and very drinkable brew. The Rogue guys continue to impress."
"While this is not a great beer, and slightly deflates the Rogue mystique, I still like it. It actually reminds me a little of a Fullers ESB, though I find it a little less silky."
"A beige head settles fast upon pouring over a very dark amber body. It smells of hops, which although not overwhelming, are very present. It is not as bitter as some other ales but it remains very potent. It is not a thick ale and goes down smooth. I like drinking this on occasion and am happy it is not a seasonal brew. I wish I was able to find a larger variety of Rogue brews around my area, but alas it is mostly Dead Guy Ale."
"This beer is a pleasing copper/ amber color with a bit of chill haze to it. It pours with a frothy cream to tan colored head. The main aroma is one of a malty biscuit, it is accompanied by a sweet hoppiness. This beer is very malty tasting, and lightly sweet. I must say this is a great session beer, lots of flavor yet it seems to be relatively light. A beer for when you aren't up to being assaulted by hop varieties and dense maltiness. This beer finishes with a balancing bitterness that counterpoints the wonderful mixture of sweet maltiness and hop flavors that are at the front part of this beer. This beer is what I wish Fat Tire was, I know it is a bit hypocritical, but I can still wish."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. I'm glad they make this year round so I don't have to wait for the fall."
"I've had this beer a few times now, and it's always so hard to nail down. I always enjoy it, but it doesn't leap out in any way. Subtelty in a Rogue? Imagine that! Starts off quite sweet and malty (almost too much so). By the end, the trademark Rogue hops are prevalent. In between, however, a nice unique ale. Good balance, good taste, good drinkability. Good beer. I'm glad this is available again at one of my local beer stores. A nice change."
"Light amber color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty,fruity and sweet. A medium bodied, helles/bock ale. Fairly malty, yet with a nice strong hop bite. Some hop spiciness. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Had this one on tap at the local pub. Pours an amber color with some orange hues and a moderate head that dies off quickly and leaves a decent amount of lace on the glass. The aroma is not very strong, but there were some slight hops and a little citrus present. The flavor was sweet and malty - good combination. The flavor is fairly smooth, but not perfect - it could be a little more smooth. The mouthfeel was average in my book."
"Seemed like a fairly average beer to me. Poured a little on the cloudy side, but cleared as it warmed. There was a sweet malt scent with a touch of hops. The start was somewhat malty sweet, but then the hops kick in with a dry, citrusy, grapefruit finish. As with the finish, the aftertaste was on the bitter side. The mouthfeel was a little creamy with a light to medium body and slight carbonation. Well balanced, but over all, the flavors are a bit subdued. This is a good brew that is quite drinkable, yet it didnt seem to stand out too much to me. Would probably be an all around good beer that even non-BAs might enjoy."
"Overall Impression: Rouge has done it again. An outstanding beer. Drinkability is unsurpassed. Leaves a dry finish that triggers an almost instinctual next sip, and a great taste that rewards the impulse. I’m starting to run low, someone help!!"
"A pretty good beer that went well with the Clam Chowder I had."
"Wouldn't particularly drink it as a thirst quencher, but the beer is very nice."
"Tell your friends, if you don't know, now you know."
"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite beers. To hell whether or not it 'adheres to the style', this is one of the best that Rogue has to offer. This proves they can do subtle as well as they do bold. Pours a clear dark copper with a a frothy off-white head. Aromas are all light and subdued--sweet, hoppy, grassy, inviting if nothing else. Everything else is all she wrote. There is a perfect balance of the malt and hop profile and neither is over done, although each dominate at different times. Tastes sweet--raisins-- followed by the smoothest hops and a slightly dry finish. I could (and have) drink this all night and I usually opt for variety. I can't wait to have it on tap again."
"This bock poured a cloudy/hazy amber-brown with hints of red, with white foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was spicy hops and sweet malt. The taste was sweet malt (caramel) and spicy hops near the finish. Nicely balanced flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but dry and hoppy (almost chalky) at the finish and in the aftertaste. The body was medium and the carbonation low. This was a very tasty bock on tap."
"I've heard so much about this brew that I just had to try it when I saw a big bottle of it at a local market. It poured a nice, slightly murky reddish orange with minimal head yet ample sticky lace coating the glass throughout. Attractive fruitiness and sweet malt on the nose with a little cooking caramel as well. The taste of this baby is really quite nice. Lots of caramel malt flavors and a slick buttery texture, that finds balance in nice grainy malty/hoppy interaction. This beer is superbly balanced and very flavorfull! I'm picking up more of that caramel corn thing as I finish this beer. This is some tasty stuff, and as I drink more of it, it becomes even more ""drinkable! I would not call it a refresher, yet I would call it a damn good, turn on the AC and kick back in the chaise lounge summer sipper!"
"This was another selection at the Old Chicago in Phoenix. Appearance is reddish-orange, making in quite interesting as opposed to a disappointing pour which did not leave much of a head. The smells detected were of malts and a slight fruit odor. The taste is interesting, nothing like I have had before. Had a good mouth feel. Overall was a very drinkable beer, a bit pricy as it asks for a Stone Brewing price but does not deliver the same caliber of beer."
"Flavor is bold and powerful, yet smooth and rich. The beer starts out malty sweet, fading into a slight toasty graininess, then travels into a moderate northwest hopping, finishing the beer. Malts remain throughout the sip, finishing with the hops wonderfully. Hints of apple, pear, and plum. Heavy body, with mild smooth carbonation. A touch of cookie-like yeastiness. Nice and complex flavor, changing and melding throughout the sip. One of the best flagship beers, in my opinion."
"Not sure how I found this beer in Atlanta - Georgia supposedly has a beer alcohol limit of 6%. The color is honey caramel - maybe even orange. Theres a slight floral, almost sweet/citrus, aroma. Although this beer feels thin in the mouth (it's almost flat - perhaps I need to have a few more to be sure). The malt/hop balance is very nice. This is an extremely easy drinking beer. This will be a beer that I drink by the pool or while lounging on the deck, or watching a ballgame - if I can keep finding it in the ATL."
"Dead Guy poured a dark red, maybe slightly brownish color. A bit cloudy, it also had a nice fluffy head. Not a very active appearance, but deep and serious. The smell was quite interesting, a floral hoppy aroma with sweetness underlying it all. Nice honey traces. The taste was a bit strange, but I got used to it pretty quickly. The initial sweetness is tempered by a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Different than most beers, even most maibocks that I can remember. The full mouthfeel was very appropriate, and matched the complexity of the beer very well. Good taste, and good drinking overall. The alcohol can sneak up on you a little, but this makes for a great standby, and a good session maibock."
"One of my current standbys, a very good beer. It's a lovely color in the glass. The head isn't quite as pure white as a lot of other beers, which gives it a good feel. Not every beer has to have a snow-white froth floating on top. Feels very good in the mouth, and goes down surprisingly easily. On top of all this, a jollly beer-swilling skeleton on the label makes this one of my favorite bottle designs of all time. Highly recommended!"
"Notes: Impressive session brew."
"Drinkability: maybe I got a less-than-fresh pint. I'll give this beer points for being well-balanced but I felt that it was lacking in flavor and aroma to the point that I'll either a) not touch it again; or b) go back and get another and adjust this review if necessary."
"The beer pours an dark golden/ amber color with a thin off-white head that laces nicely. The aroma is fruity. There are hints of pale malts and yeast. The taste is also good. There is a sweetness about it that stays with you until it finishes. This is a refreshing beer that's low/med bodied and carbonated just right. This is a great sessions beer. Rogue has done it again."
"Bronze-red colored. Smell is slighty hoppy. Taste is clean and crisp, with just enough hoppiness to keep it spicy, but not too much for my palate. Very appetizing and enjoyable, a great session beer on a summer evening. Recommended."
"It drinks extremely easy. Maybe too easy. It is fresh and finishes nice. I just have to say a comendable job on creating this easy drinking ale."
"This beer was a nice copper brown color with a medium-sized, creamy head. It's taste included a caramel maltiness and was different from a lot of beers I have had before. The mouthfeel was excellent and I'd definately drink this beer again and often."
"Overall Impression: I guess this is Rogue's one-size-fits-all beer and I have to admit I do like it. Most the beers I've tried from Rogue were just too heavy on the hops. This one is more balanced, so it's no wonder it has more wide-ranging appeal."
"I found this particular beer to have both a bitter taste and an after taste as well. After just a few sips of this beer, I could definitely feel the alcohol effects. All in all not too bad of a beer, but not one of the better beers that I have tried."
"The rogue in me certainly enjoyed this beer quite a bit! Whether it's a lager or an ale, it's a good beer and one I will have again!"
"Nice hoppy aroma. This brew formed a nice medium head without too much carbonation. It lasted only a short while though and left an excellent lacing on the side of the glass. It is a cloudy light orange brown color. It has a slight aftertaste but is still on the mild side. A nice drinkable but unimpressive beer."
"Beautiful color in glass, deep red with a little orange. Not much head to speak of and very little head retention (the only dissappointment I had). Hoppy and slightly sweet bouquet. The flavor was hoppy and delicious with a definately sweet malty round undercurrent. Drinkable and delectable."
"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle, it bears a resemblence of liquid twilight, a beautiful hazy copper tone with a one-finger off-white head that recedes to a frothy ring. Aroma is complex, caramel malt, a bit of fruit, some citrus, definitely some honey, floral hops, a touch earthy. Flavour is bold, sweet and bitter and oily all at once, difficult to pick anything out on its own, it all blends in. If this is a standard of what's to come, then I salute the rogue in each of us as well."
"Another winner from Rogue!!! Poured this one and saw only a little lacy head on one side the glass, virtually none at all. A thick amber colored beer, looked almost like a jar of mountain honey in my frosty mug. Lots of smell coming from this one...fruit? A very satisfying mixture of taste that is at first sweet, then that little bit of Rogue bitterness that makes a nice finish. A unique brew that is always in my fridge!!"
"On draught. Appearance: hazy, honey colored w/ a medium white head. It has a malty taste up front w/ a bit of a funky tart finish. Maybe grapefruit or lemon? unique, to be sure. It's definitely different and a must-try for any serious beer lover's list"
"I really like this beer. Dark copper color paired with a deliciously creamy head. Aroma is a nice balance between sweet malts and flowery hops. Taste is fronted by sweetness, followed and balanced nicely by hops. Tastes like a maibock. Extremely drinkable--watch out six-pack!"
"I had this on tap at the BW3 downtown Indy, Poured a clear red/orange, with a moderate head, that didn't last long. Some signs of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt and hops. Taste is malty and sweet, almost too sweet. It has a good mouthfeel with just the right amount of hop bitterness in the finish. Not something I could drink alot of at one time, because of the sweetness. But still an over all good beer."
"Almost exceptional appearance.Maintained a huge head for awhile before it faded leaving spotty lace and a thin white head.Floral fruit aroma with hints of caramel malt and a touch of bitterness.The color is an orange to amber.Medium bodied with a strong bitter finish and taste.The bitterness makes no attempt to hide itself.Fruity taste thats dry but not too refreshing.It is strong at 6.5% and that might limit drinkability.Smooth mouthfeel thats clean and crisp.Complex and well-crafted with a great reputation."
"A bit odd, similiar in taste to Golden Syrup, a bit too sticky. Quite sticky and sweet, with a touch of salt at the end. Kinda like a bock, just with a bit more hops that i'd usually expect in one. Very odd, flavours didn't mold well at all. Probably my least favourite from a night of tasting many great US beers."
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours an orangish-red color with 2 fingers of head and a little bit of lacing. The smell was just a little weak. It smelled of citrus and hops a little bit. The taste is a good mix of fruit and hops and is very well balanced. It is a very soothing ale, if that makes any sense. The mouthfeel was just a tad bit oily. The drinkability is great, and this is a pretty unique ale."
"Drinkability is nearly perfect and this is a wonderful session, pairing, or convert beer. A great all around offering, but would you expect anything less from Rogue?"
"Good carbonation, strong taste with slight bitterness, and lingering aftertaste."
"a nice looking copper colored beer with good tan head. the smell is mostly caramel malty with a little hoppiness thrown in. the taste is very well balanced beer, nice blend of herbal hops with sweet caramel malts. real nice balance and an appropriately medium mouthfeel. rogue always satisfies."
"I could have sworn this was a pale ale. But the category shows that it is not. Pours a nice coppery amber color. Nice head with good retention. Beautiful floral hops and malt balance. The finish is just as good. Alcohol is there too but not up front. Mouthfeel starts out velvety and finishes a little dry. Makes you want more."
"I'm finding that this beer is winning me over as I drink it. At first seems a bit too fruity for my tastes, but as I drink it the complexity starts to present itself, along with the hops. It's like I'm not sure if I like it, but I know I want more!"
"Yes, it's extremely drinkable. This six-pack won't last long. It seems a bit hoppy for a maibock, but I'm not really complaining. It's like an ESB with a really firm malt backbone. I've had a few of these now, and I just LOVE this beer. No matter what you call it, it's darn tasty."
"Had this on tap at the Sunset Cantina. Color was a clear, light copper hue, and the head was white, fine and thin, but with minimal lacing. Nose displayed some citrusy hop notes, and even seemed a bit grassy to me. Body was better than medium, with a slight prickliness on the tongue. Flavor was a great balance between malt and hops. Malt was slightly toasty, with some sweetness (but not enough for me!) and the hops were pleasing with a citrus lean to them. Good stuff!!"
"Brilliant amber color with a large two inch fluff atop. This beer is so well balanced and a treat to throw back. It's creamy sweet and then spicy sharp hops....caramel malty and then sharp hops. An awesome session beer that is stronger than one would imagine. This is most definitely worth a try and is one of my fall-back brews"
"Pours a beauty of a dark amber with a thin, retaining head. Some fruity and hops are noted on the aroma, barely detectable. A spicy hoppy taste is noted on top, with some underlying malts and some citrus detected. Medium bodied, and hopped up as expected from Rogue, all in all an above average beer that can have some bite."
"Great rusty bronze color with creamy white head. Head didn't stay long, and lace was minimal. The aroma smelled like a kettle of carmel when you melt it to make carmel apples, and a sweet malt and alcohol smell came through nicely. The taste was rich and smooth, pronounced carmel flavor, with a bitter-sweet middle, and a pleasant sweet and tart finish that lingered a bit. An excellent Maibock style beer."
"My first Rogue. ""All Killer, no Filler"""
"Lightly drying but with an obviously bitter finish, it didn't diminish the very wet feeling the watery mouthfeel left for most of my tongue. A good session beer, light (relative to most Rogue offerings) yet interesting. I thought better in bottle, as for me the draught had lost its malt flavors and thus its balance."
"Dark amber, a little hazy, with an orangey head that is thick and lingering. Aroma of sweet malts and ripe fruit, some toffee and candy. Flavor is coarse brown sugar, ripe pear and hint of butterscotch. Also a bit of a rough-edged flavor, a little grainy. Mouthfeel is round and full, with even carbonation. You can just feel tinges of the alcohol."
"Tawny bronze hue. Covered by a cream white, fluffy, well retained head. Rutted lace remains. Soft, spicy hop nose with an herbal tinge along with lightly toasted malt and mellow light caramel. Pleasant, understated aroma. Assertive hop bite initially in flavor is partially contrasted by mildly buttery malt and mellow toffee. Malt character is predominantly of cleanly grainy, toasty Munich and stately, dextrinous light lovibond caramel malt. Not complex, but sufficient in malt backbone for adequate balance. Subdued herbal, mint tinged hop flavor. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth mouthfeel well calculated in dextrins. Finishes with lingering hop bitterness and fleeting toasty malt, and thus quite dry. Another well hopped, unique Rogue creation. Simple, tasty and certainly quaffable."
"Rogue Dead Guy Ale: In a twelve ounce brown bottle. This is one very tasty beer. Deep amber color, nice off-white head with sufficient staying power to coat the sides of the glass. The taste is exceptional, neatly balanced malts off set the assertive hops. Clearly, this is a terrific beer for any hop head, but one that I think any beer drinker would enjoy, as this beer showcases the floral/citrus aspects of the hops with out leaving too much of a bitter bite. Very nice!"
"Pours a reddish brown. Not much head to the beer. Both the aroma and taste are very complex. There are a great deal of malts and hops in this beer, but neither are overwhelming, but there is a good hop kick in the end. Extremely well balanced. This one would get the Mayan's to come back from the dead! (Big misconception that this was named for Jerry Garcia. It was named for a Mayan celebration. It does sell beers, since they don't readily discount it.)"
"If you see this beer, do yourself a favor and get a pint. I suggest it to all newbies and I get great response. Enjoy!"
"This is the sweetest juice of god. It has a beautiful deep golden amber color. Shimmering with deliciousness. Aroma is of bold malts wrapped in a loving bouquet of hops. I do not catch any of the fruit other see, but this has the rich warm qualities of fresh baked bread. A firm hop back bone, that make me glad I was born. The creamy smooth mouthfeel is liquid silk."
"Quite a treat here. Copper red color with a pale orange hue. Initially fluffy then disappates into an offwhite head that resembles a flat cloud in shape. Sweet and mellow candly-like scent. Flavor initially is slightly bitter but soon transforms on the tongue to a mellow sweetness. Just a plethora of different sweetnesses confused and excite the tongue and palate. Aftertaste almost has an element of carmel too it. Any taste of alcohol is non-existant in this brew. Carbonation is light which allows for all the flavor to come out. Extremely drinkable. A nice appetizer beer because once its gone you want another and another and another..."
"Poured a nice amber color with a white head, bubbles efervesced throughout the duration of the beer in my glass. Lace was left down the sides of the glass. The smell is hoppy and you get a good whiff of alcohol - almost vodka-like with my bottle. Interesting. The taste is very good and satisfies the hop-head in me - little malt presence on the palate, followed by bitter hops and a crisp finish. It feels to me that the tail end is almost missing something. Maybe I'm delusional. This is a very rich ale for my tastes, so I can see drinking one or two of these tasty brews, but certainly not more than that."
"I had this for the first time recently and enjoyed it very much. It poured a nice head that laced the glass as I drank it. The thing about it that impressed me the most was that despite its intense hops, the malt flavor came right through. This is American brewing at it's best"
"A bock, but they call it an ale? I don't understand. A very good bock. One of my favorite bocks. Too sweet for me to drink very much of, but very good none the less. Balance is good. Nice malt profile. I welcome this beer into my fridge. Great label."
"The beer has a nice body to it and the alcohol content is hidden, making it dangerous if you think it is a session beer! I just wish it was more readily available in my neck of the woods."
"Drinkability: I really wasn't constantly ready for another drink with this one. Not a beer that I would actively seek out again."
"This stuff is great, pours an orangeish hue with a white head. It tastes like a nutty amber, but it works! no massive hops, yet a subtle transformation of a classic which yields an awesome offspring. Any fan of ales would enjoy this tastey interpretation."
"Overall I will get some more...not my favorite, but still good"
"Nice looking deep golden brew with a level off-white head that died in a hurry.. Smell is a mix of english and american bitter hops, but I once this tasted a few more flavors kicked in, most notably a very sweet maltiness. Nothing overpowering, just a decent balance of hops & sweet bready malts. Alcohol is totally hidden. Not the best maibock I've head, but pretty good."
"Amber in color, light tan small bubbly half inch thick head. Very appealing to look at. Smells of light floral hops and yeast. Start and middle are a little bit empty, but ohh the finish is so nice. Good fair amount of hops with a nice dry hop bite. Sip or drink it slow, its quite smooth with a nice hop bite. Drink it fast and watch out, the hop bite bites. Has a light body feel and leaves a dry hop tang in mouth and tongue. Drinkable indeed, this is a nice clean hophead ale for sure."
"Poured and amber color topped with a large foamy white head, excellent retention. Not much aroma, a little malty sweetness. Carbonation is low, giving this brew a smooth mouthfeel. Malts dominate the flavor, a little raison notes. Not too bad overall, but not the best Rogue has to offer. Character is a just a little lacking, something that some of Rogue's other brews have that makes them stand out. But hey, when the day of the dead comes, what better than a dead guy."
"Presented in a 22oz bomber bottle with the classic Dead Guy sitting on a barrel. This is one of my favorite maibocks. Pours a deep amber/bronze color topped off by a medium sized bubbly head. Nose is floral and malty with slight undertones of nuts and fruit. Bitter hops are immediately recognized upon first taste, followed by a sweet fruitiness and malts. Very balanced and easy to drink. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste, very nice. Another great beer from Rogue."
"Nice rich gold color with creamy head that stayed nicely,smelled nice and malty with some fruitiness to it.Nice balanced brew not overly sweet but enjoyably sweet,hop is in there after a few sips it shows.Drink this one alot really good beer with some balls."
"Comments: Very flavorful brew, extremely easy to drink. The dead finish provides an interesting effect. Thank you Keith (stegmakk) for the bottle."
"Poured a hazy wheat/honey type color with a small amount of head that thins out and leaves a lacy coat on top. The aroma is not strong at all but you can smell the hops and light malt. There was a slight bitter, malt aftertaste that is not overpowering and completes the initial hop taste. There is a smooth mouth feel to this beer, that makes you want to grab another and another and another. The drinkability is great, this is one of those beers you want on a hot summer night when you're relaxing at home with some friends having a good conversation about beer and life."
"This is overall an excellent beer and very drinkable in my opinion."
"Dangerously drinkable...a 12 oz. bottle gives me a pleasant buzz on an empty stomach. Delicious..somewhat of a dessert beer. This reminds me of a sweet real cask ale. At it's prime, this is one of my favorite beers and in my top 20. On tap at the Rogue Ale House, this is just sublime."
"You can drink a truck full of this and still like it."
"Another great offering from Rogue. This tasty mai bock was originally created to celebrate the Mayan Day of the Dead or Dia de Muerto on November 2, All Souls Day. Pours a hazy medium orange with a white foamy head. Nice citrusy, buttery aroma with a hoppy floral boquette. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, which is thick and creamy. Smooth front with a crisp textured finish. Sweet and citrusy upfront with a biscuity malt goodness. Flavorful finish from the Saaz hops is just perfect. I picked up a single bottle to sample and now I wish I had grabbed a six-pack."
"For some reason this reminds me of an outstanding homebrewed beer, probably the hazy appearance and the rich natural flavours, true craftbrewed excellence."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber copper hue with an off white fluffy billowing head. This beer doesn't have the thickest lace, but what it lacks there it makes up with in taste and aroma. Aroma is a sharp sweetness with notes of caramel and slight apple tartness. The flavor is very complex yet simply amazing in every way, this beer blends the perfect amount of subtle bittering hops with a huge blend of specialty malts. Gotta love the maibock brewed with ale yeast instead of the standard lager yeast for the style. This shows that taking a chance can bring you an awesome product like the one I have the pleasure of sipping on right now. There are hints is a soft chewy mouthfeel that carries a plethora of caramel malt, a ver slight tartness, and the trace of hop character tie this beer together. No loose ends here, one amazing totally solid brew that is so easy to drink. If I see this stuff on tap it is going to be quite a fun night, very good drinkable brew."
"I really like this beer a lot. I had not had any Rogue products prior to this and I hope all of this live up to Dead Guy's near perfection (IMHO). I think this beer would be great to drink at any time, whether at the bar or with food."
"Very reliable brew. The pour was silky smooth with an attractive red orange color with just a tad bit of carbonation and a somewhat unsubstantial white head that formed clingy lace. The smell was a balance of malt and hops but was a little lacking in complexity. The taste was not however. It was full with some citrus flavors and notes of apple and bitter malts. Yet another quality effort from Rogue."
"Pretty dang good . . . I can see it becoming my fallback brew."
"Taste = This is how Bock beer ought to taste. A one-two punch. Malt and plenty of it, just start to taste the sweet of it when POW the hops hit you. Plenty, but not too much hops, luscious short to medium finish. A wonderful brew. More please."
"Pleasant creamy mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable! I'd have this one again...and again...and again."
"A pretty good brew. Pours a dark orange with a white lace. Nose is sweet, with obvious malt and hops. Initial taste is malt sweetness, but this is quickly followed by hop bitterness that ends with a nutty sweetness. Fairly smooth and medium-bodied. A great ale, and rather warming. I'd have to say I'll come back to this one."
"A genuinely delightful beer. Pours sunset orange in color, with a mountainous off-white head that leaves a great lace down the glass (what Rogue beer doesn't?). The aroma is malty sweet with a bit of a honey-like scent and an aroma of tropical fruit. In the mouth the beer is creamy and sweet with a medium full body. The flavor is mostly malty, with some muted fruity flavors, a bread-crust like finish, and some piney and floral hop flavors which lend it a slightly dry finish./ Not terifically complex, but I could drink this all day."
"When I saw the name of this brew on the menu as on draft at my local CT upscale diner, I figured it was a local IPA or Pale Ale of some sort. How pleasantly surprised I was when it arrived at the table and was confused as to what type of beer it was as it did not adhere to either style. When I got home, I punched it in at the beeradvocate website and found it was from Rogue, which I haven't been able to get in any of my local stores here in New England. As far as the beer goes, it did not have the metallic taste I associate with other Rogue products I've had. The malt was a honey-ish variety with the hops being ever present but not overtly spicy. The body was nicely constructed, with the head playing a strong part in the experience all the way to the bottom of the glass. If it wasn't for the fact that I was driving, I could easily have sat there and sampled more. A good beer and one I will try and find to have in the house."
"This brew pours a murky, deep brownish-orange with a light beige head that reduces to a cap. The smell is very unique....floral, heavy waves of candied fruit, chocolate, and dark caramel. The taste is of burnt caramel, chocolate malted milk balls, plum preserves and raisins. Though lighter-bodied and less potent, it reminded me a bit of the sample of Samichlaus I tried not too long ago. Unfortunately some odd metallic taste comes on in the finish contributing to an unpleasant bitterness. I think my bottle might be an old one, and I know it was not stored at cellar temperatures prior to my purchase. Even so, I could tell this was a good beer past its prime. I will have to try to locate a fresher sample."
"This brew poured a deep orange-amber color with a small white head that didn't last long. The aroma was slightly citrus with a flowery hint. The taste was malty up front with a sweet middle and a good balance of hops to finish it off. A slight alcohol flavor is present in the aftertaste which gives the beer a slight warming effect. This beer had good carbonation with a crisp refreshing mouthfeel. I will have to puchase this beer again."
"[ STATS:>> SERVING: 16 oz. pint / ABV: 6.5% / PRICE: $4.00 USD ]"
"Copper orangish in color with a thick off-white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is malty and fruity. This aroma carries over into the flavor as well. The malty, fruity flavors are balanced out by the hop bitterness. The balancing of the malt and hops makes this beer very easy to drink. Overall, I found this to be an excellent ale, well balanced and very drinkable."
"Cheers"
"This was a great offering. Poured a nice amber color, with good carbonation. The taste was awesome, with excellent malt flavor, and hops to compliment it. Not too sweet for this man's pallette. Not overpowering, good for drinking at least three bttles in one sitting. A definite great beer."
"Yet another winner from Rogue. Pours out to a very, good-looking amber in the glass with a light head. Carbonation is lively but not overbearing. Aroma is that of fruit with some floral overtones. Taste is nice and malty with a good dose of hops on the swallow, but not too much. I really like this brewery."
"Taste: The sweetnes and fruitness that is present in the aroma of the beer if very evident in the flavor as well. Almost too much so for my tastes. I prefer more bitterness and less sweetness in my beers, so for that reason this brew did not score higher. All that said, this wasn't an unpleasant beer; just not the one for me. I did suck it down rather quickly, though, which led to the higher ""drinkability"" rating."
"This beer came to me at the table an amber color with hints of red and yellow-honey when held to the light, some cloud but you could see through it. The head was an off white/beige color that seemed to have some stability to it. Lace was present on the sides of the glass. The aroma was of much like a zinfadel or at least that is what the wife stated. I noted fruit, sweet malt, and some hops. The taste was incredible. Before I start I would like to say that I liked-loved this beer. Now, flavors of sweet malt, fresh fruit, caramel, hops, and a bit of alcohol at the end. They all just danced around my tongue like it was on vacation, and after the last sip I heard a slight sigh from inside my mouth (I swear) because it knew that the last sip was indeed the last sip and I had to leave. So I bought 2 bottles to take home, one to drink, and one larger one to save, because I loved the painted label on the bottle, simple but classy, plus I like stuff like that. If someone who has never had this beer and reads this, stop reading and go get some."
"Still, not bad, and enjoyable. But I've got many other beers that I would rather drink first."
"Good, but not outstanding. Pours a clear amber with fair head. Little head retention and minimal lacing.Moderate malt flavor with a bit of hops noticable.Slightly sweet with a medium thickness. A very drinkable beer, but nothing really grabs me. Will definitly put a few more away, but I won't go out of my way for it. Give it a try."
"Cool label, pours predominanantly amber but slightly golden. Medium carbonation and thick frothy clingy head. Slithgly fruity aroma mixed with some spicyness. Aroma is not overwhelming but definately there. Taste is a malty fruityness that is rounded out with spicey hop flavor. It is complex. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but that's fine. The heaviness and body make it difficult to drink a number of these, even though you really would like to."
"I will definetly have another and can't wait for more from Rogue! I think the Mocha Porter will be next but I'll see."
"Man what a beer! It poured with a deep honey color and a very nice and creamy tan head. YUM! The aroma was great! I can find the all the words to express myself but lets start with, spicy, malt, fruity with a hint of hops. The taste was long awaited and well worth the wait. A great balance of malt and hops with tones of fruit bounce off your tongue! Mouth feel and drink ability are great! I was well pleased with this ale and would recommend it to anyone. Im looking forward to try more Rouge beers."
"An interesting beer...a maibock style ale....definitely still tastes like an ale...fruity maltiness is present along with a buttery texture caramel like flavor at first...great floral hop flavor...a great fruity/foral hop mix on the nose...I don't really see too many maibock characteristics but this is a good beverage..a brilliant orange in color... This is a solid ale I wouldn't mind trying again sometime.."
"Another winner from Rogue, and, as usual, they shun traditional guidelines to make a delicious brew."
"All hail Dead Guy, Long May He Rest!"
"This is one amazing beer! I usually try to stay away from American brews, from the few i have tasted, but this is one good beer. Its full of flavour, and kinda floral smell. For those of u who love a beer with a strong flavour, this is it, its got hints of fruit, and slight molassas, which i like very much. The only real complaint i have is that i wish it had a bigger head that retained itself, but the taste more than makes up for it. The appearance is very nice, giving a orange-red cloudy color. I will definatly be buying this beer again, and again."
"Good looking beer. Nice amber color with a decent head. Malty smell that's really pleasant. The first sip did not dissapoint & held its own until the end. Very drinkable. I will be buying more as long as I can find it."
"Pours a clear copper color with a medium off-white head. The smell is a delicious combination of roasted malt, caramel, and light sweet fruit. Nice indeed! The taste replicates the aromas making for a nice complex mix with the just the right amout of hops with a light-dry finish to make this one superb brew. It has a nice medium mouthfeel and drinks down pretty easy. Damned good brew! Pineywoodsrooter donated a few of these to me brought up from Houston -thanks! Cheers!"
"I don't know if I had a bad one or something, but I wasn't that inpressed with it. It was the last one on the fridge shelf, so I guess it was old. Even though it was probably old, it was still good. I wouldn't give it the best review, but I also wouldn't give it a bad review or an average review, because it was better than average. It had an overbearing alcoholy taste to it, which I don't really dig. If it were fresher, I'm sure it would have been better."
"Pours a beautiful amber color with amble thick head that reduces to a thin rind. The lace is minimal. Roasted malt is the dominant smell, but there is a fruity smell that I don’t recognize. The taste is a little bitter for my taste, but is still quite enjoyable. It starts out slightly sweet, but turns bitter. The finish is quite pleasant. This is an all around good maibock. This beer is a little heavy to drink more than 3 or 4 but it is definitely a beer that I will purchase again."
"Dead Guy should be a staple in everyone's beer diet. It's got a full rich flavor, but at the same time it's light to medium bodied, and quite drinkble. To me, this tastes like everything Bass Ale aspires to be. The tastes are comparable, but Dead Guy gets it right. There is nothing too complex about this beer, and that's a good thing. It is a testament to the fact that your tastebuds don't always need to be assaulted with a billion different flavors to be an interesting beer. The beauty of Dead Guy is it's simplicity. It's also great with just about any food you can think of."
"Pours an Amber color, with a white thick head which lasts longer that i expected. Smells very nice (light caramel/candy smell). Tastes very nice (a bit sweet) and goes does very easily"
"Amber-honey color, with a white fluffy head, nice lacing, smells sweet candy and hops. Starts sweet medium body with noticeable hop bite, strange for the style, goes down very smooth and easy."
"A surprise this was, set up at purchase in a halloween display. A nice looking copper/amber brew with a medium white sticky head that laced well. A good balance of more malt than hop with a slight fruity sweet taste. The aroma backs up the taste well. I will seek this again as a great autumn ale for its name, available year-round."
"Pours a dark orange color with is sticky head. Great balance of malt and hops. Both present themselves in every aspect of the beer...from the first sniff through the finish. Aroma shows a more floral hoppiness as it warms. Likewise, sweet molases flavors appear as you work on the beer. It has a rough, hard-edged quality, with the flavors banging against one another. Very good....I hope it becomes a regular item in my local beer store."
"Pours a reddish amber color with a light head and a sweet malty aroma with hints of citrus and a definite hop presence. The taste is dominated by a strong, yet pleasant, hop bitterness, especially the aftertaste. It goes down easily and is quite refreshing. A decent buy at $3.49 for a 22oz bottle."
"I finally got around to trying this one and was pleasantly surprised that it lived up to the hype. It's golden-amber with a sticky white head. It's got the unmistakeable bock smell of sweet malt but with more hops than the typical bock. It has toffee and caramel flavors up front with traces of ripe fruit and enough hop bite to liven things up a bit. It's highly drinkable and just made for that old saying: Through the teeth and over the gums, look out stomach here it comes. A winner."
"Hoisted this to celebrate Halloween - the night the dead guys roam.  Another winner from Rogue - malty, almost syrupy and full of ripe fruit flavors.  No idea how old this bottle was - there was a good bit of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, but it did not decant and, whatever the beer's age, it had aged quite gracefully.  The only negative was that I did not have a bottle with the glow in the dark label I've heard about ... well, there's always next year."
"Pours a hazy orange brown with a thick and creamy off-white head with excellent retention.  Thick, sticky lace thoroughly coat the glass walls.  The carbonation is quite lively, though its difficult to perceive due to the beer's cloudy quality.  Rich caramel malt aroma with a fruity quality that is somewhat like dried apricot.  Taste begins with toasted malts and a slight sting of carbonation, towards the middle of the taste the hops assert themselves fairly forcefully.  Towards the finish, caramel flavors play off against the hop bitterness.  The flavor range of the beer improved dramatically as it warmed."
"A long time favorite of mine. Pours an orange-ish amber color from the tap with a frothy tan head. Head retains well and leaves decent lace all the way down the glass. Smell is fruity and sweet for the most part. Taste is of sweet maltiness at first, with some of the trademark Rogue hoppy bitterness presenting itself, as well. Feels rather smooth in the mouth. An easy drinker, for sure, making this ale a candidate for session beer status. A solid offering overall."
"TLBB  21st October 2002"
"This is a very drinkable beer that is super-smooth.  Nice hazy orange-amber body with a decent head in a pint glass.  The head leaves a faint lace.  Moderate aroma that is not overpowering, very enticing.  Floral hops are noticable, as well a slight malt sweetness.  The taste is clean and much lighter than I was expecting.  Very well balanced with a good, bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is very smooth, and the beer drinks very easy, especially for a moderate ABV.  This was my first Rogue tasting, and it will not be my last."
"Rogues Dead Guy Ale pours honey-apple cider amber with a delicate white head, some retention.  The taste this beer brings to the table is awesome.  This is a brilliant use of hops, malt, and yeast to create a tropical fruit, caramel, toasty malt, spicy hops combination of flavors.  The creamy mouthfeel was welcomed.  The drinkability of this beer is outstanding.  This is a must try and something that could easily become a standard beer in your refrigerator.  Obviously, I'd recommend it."
"This ale very good. It pours with a fairly thick head which leaves a light lace. It has a thickly hoppy smell and a taste that is slightly more malty. The mouthfeel is just okay but it is fairly drinkable. I dig this brew and will probably geti t again."
"Pours a slightly hazy, amber honey color with with a nice white head, which leaves generous lace. all the way down the glass. Malty aroma  with fruity and floral hints. Starts off with some sweetness, a bit of honey, and grain/bread flavors. Then comes the hops to balance it nicely. Smooth and medium body, easy to drink. Flavorful and enjoyable."
"Hazy orange tinted copper color.  Slight sticky off-white head dissipates to a rimming in seconds.  Carmally, malty aroma. You can tell this ""helles bock"" uses an ale yeast.  Some fruity tones not present in most maibocks are here.  And there isn't as clean of a malt profile as most maibocks.  That said, this is a tasty brew.  Tastes more like an american style amber ale, but there is a bit of a munich malt twist to it. Solid maltiness and solid hop characteristics (of course).   Has a spicy little noble hop kick.  Almost full in body and almost a syrupy mouthfeel, but not quite.  An enjoyable brew, even if it's not necessarily a ""true maibock."""
"This pours with lasting tan head over medium-amber liquid, with a gentle carbonation. A beautiful malty-bready aroma meets the nose. Taste is sweetness with depth, a bit of honey-ish notes followed by  a subtle but effective hop bitterness. This finishes smooth and clean with some latent hoppiness to close things out. Another in a long line of winners from one of America's premier micros."
"Amber haze with a white, sticky head that mostly settles soon after the pour.  Great balance of sweet malt and hops in the nose.  Just a bit fruity and peat-like.  With a taste, I literally become wide-eyed... what is this I'm tasting?  Could it be?  Pistachio!  Right in the middle of the palate, a very clear pistachio-like character.  Something I've never experienced in a beer before.  Before I start ranting about loving pistachios, I'd better move on to the other characteristics.  Sweetness from the malt, balanced well by the hops, as in the nose.  Bread-like toasted malt character abound, especially with retro-olfaction.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that is both crisp from the hops and grainy from the malt.  I'm really enjoying the unique character of this beer.  Very flavorful and just plain enjoyable all the way through."
"Slightly hazy. Reddish-orange in color with a fluffy ivory head that holds well and leaves some light lace. The aroma is mainly malty with a softly toasty caramel note and a lightly spicy hoppiness, as well as some dark fruitiness (at times I thought of cherry). The body is medium with a somewhat less than moderate carbonation level (very English), giving a nice creaminess in the mouthfeel. The flavor is richly malty with a solid caramel notes and some distinct, piney hops. It's well balanced, giving a see-saw effect that goes from sweet malt to hop flavor & bitterness with each taste. The finish is dryish with a nice hop flavor. Very nicely done. Very drinkable with alot of character. Highly recommended."
"I think I was expecting more from this beer, because the friend I was with couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I found it good, not great.  The color was orange-amber, but was cloudy.  It poured nice with a creamy head.  the smell was both sweet and hoppy.   I tasted malt, honey.  The bitterness was was what I was not expecting.  Drinkable, but not the greatest beer."
"Healthy, tenacious head of copper and cream color. The liquid is reddish gold. The color is so vibrant it looks like a light source of its own. A nose of baklava (honey, phyllo, roasted pistachios) dirty laundry and guava. Dense and tropical. Silky creamy texture that reveals delicate shadings of melon, tropical blooms, hops, strawberries, new paint, ... I can't get over how solid it feels...like heavy cream...and how bright and clean it is on the palate. The finish lasts and lasts. You can drink more than one of these, easy!"
"Deep hazy amber in color, with a delicate white head.  A sweet malty aroma hints at wood and honey.  The nose is sweet and opens up to cinnamon and other baking spice flavors, as well as toffee.  Mouthfeel is very rounded and soft.  The hops provide solid bitterness in the finish, but don't completely cut the sweetness in the aftertaste.  I like the complex malt flavors in this beer."
"Hazy amber orange with very little head.  Sweet aroma from malt, and floral / fruity hops.  Very balanced between malt and hop flavors, with a medium body. MMM, tasty!  A quality brew from a quality brewery."
"I'll say that this is the least beer that I've tasted from Rogue. I thought it was to bitter. After the first taste, I couldn't pick up the flavor of this brew. I might try again later, but I won't go out of my way. Second time around I found it pleasant with a malt, hoppy and caramel flavor. The bitterness was not over powering and was a pleasant surprise."
"Cloudy light brown color with thick off-white head that lasts until the last drop.  The smell was light malt with a slightly nutty smell.  But the smell was light overall.  The very sweet malt flavor and slightly bitter/dry finish was nice.  The flavor was long-lasting, but the beer was not active enough to warrant more than a 3.5 for mouthfeel.  I would call it an above average beer, but not great."
"Flavourful malts and balancing hops, but too light for me.  Worth a try, however.  Cheers"
"Gold-orange in color with a nice thick head.  Pleasing malty nose.  Nuts and sweet flavors in the mouth with a good touch of bitterness.  Very well balanced almost to the point of perfection."
"The dead guy has been sitting on my shelf for about a month and I finally got around to him last night. Wow, What a good beer. Deep burnt orange to amber in color, the head was very full, fluffy and thick with a light tan color. Noticable hop aroama bubbles bust through. Slightly sweet, floral, and honey smells with a big burst of malt. Taste is unbelievably balanced with supersweet malty richness, and a crisp dry hopped finish. Tastes alot like the best amber ale I have ever had, that rich. I was surprised to see it listed as a Mai-bock. Whatever you want to call it, it's a great beer. Smooth and creamy richness, suspect a higher abv warms your belly. Another pleasant surprise from Rogue. This is another beer that made the cross-country trip from California, and well worth it."
"The Dead Guy was a good guy. What a great, almost perfect balance of malts and hops. Both are so equally represented in this brew. Slight tartness and bitterness towards the end. Nice hoppy flavor, characteristic of Rogue. Chewy, caramel maltiness makes this very interesting, especially for the style. Subtle alcohol as well . Sooo much better on draught too...same flavor, but a bit creamier with more body. A session brew if ever there was one."
"Very malty (candy) nose with a hazy dark orange look.  The head is very pale and lasting with a good lace on the glass.  Wonderful taste of slight nut and sweetness followed by distinct bite.  Layers of flavor.  That bitterness gives great balence to the brews sweetness.  Great smooth body through to the finish.  Quite a complex ale.. there is alot going on here ... and I like it...."
"isn't it ironic. the dead guy makes me feel very much alive. i will admit that i tried this beer because of the name. i work in a liquor store and i could not pass on the dead guy. let's just say i was pleased with this beverage. it was a dark and smooth ale that had a little kick for ya. i look forward to sampling other beers produced by Rogue brewing. malts provide a nice backbone whilte there are some nice spicy notes. a tad different than other maibocks, but very drinkable."
"Dead Guy"
"This beer has a nice dark amber color and tan head.  Nice aroma to it.  Some sweetness to the taste, with a bit of tanginess.  The title and label may be a way to get some of my punk rock buddies to switch from drinking Rolling Rock."
"I have to admit I'm a bit confused by the style. Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops as much as the next guy (and maybe even more than some), but I didn't think they really fit here."
"Nice medium dark appearance.  Thin head might be nicer if served from draught.  Sweet malty bouquet with hints of fruit and flower.  Rich and full flavored with good malt character, nice finish of sweet floral."
"Notes: Delicious to say the least ... an all around prize ale brewed here, crafted very well. Great use of hops and malt to come up with a very drinkable brew ... a quaffer's delight."
"Love the label. I agree with some of the other reviews and saying that it's not a beer  that knock you off your feet. But a good drinking beer."
"Pours a nice yellowish pale amber with a nice thick creamy foamy head.  Light earthy hops with a strong malt presence in the aroma.  Strong malt body with light hops that balance this brew out very well.  Creamy across the palate and dangerously drinkable.  I agree with the previous reviewer.  This isn't a knock you off your feet brew but definitely a very tasty brew.  A great brew for a night of laid back drinking."
"I'd agree with one of the other reviews in that this isn't a knock-me-down great beer, but it's straight up solid, all-around good beer."
"Lightly airy and medium in the mouth. Quite drinkable, but not terribly interesting. I'll be the first to admit that I prefer a traditional maibock. This seems like a training-wheels version for the American consumer."
"Dead Guy Ale starts with light malt aromas and notes of hops. The color is a golden amber color topped by a tightly bubbled, tan, fluffy head. On the palate it is very flavorful with an initial surge of honey sweetness and then notes of grapefruit tartness, followed by a very nice bitter finish. Yet another excellent brew from Rogue!"
"Hazy amber, not highly carbed.  Relatively full-bodied.  Extremely well  balanced, malt has a creamy quality.  Not a blast of taste but nice mouthfeel and full finish. Dee-rinkable!  Nice if allowed to warm.  Me like!"
"52"
"this is a maibock, not an ale. has a cloudy orange apearance and a saaz hop aroma.  wonderfully balanced and is delicious. warm alcohol finish to boot.  this is one helluva maibock.  slides down so smooth, it's scary."
"Dead guy ale.  What a name.  It has both a strong malty caramel tendency and a bitter hops taste.  So, I'd say it's very well rounded.  There are also some slight earthy fruity flavors invading the palate here.  Extremely tastey brew.  A fairly potent whif of malty caramel on the nose.  A superb beer!"
"I like a hoppy beer, but I found this a bit unbalanced.  Has a great head and smell.  Goes great with spaghetti."
"Wonderful, This is one of the beers I miss from the Northwest. Just a very drinkable beer, find it, drink it, love it and may the Dead Guy be with you - great for October."
"A high-end ale.  A great all-around beer."
"Nice hop flavor and well balanced."
"Very good strong ale. Malty sweetness is balanced with assertive hopping. Another fine Rogue brew."
"Technically labeled a bock, this one tastes more like the classic English strong ales IMHO. Nevertheless, a favorite."
"I love this beer. Great maltyness, a touch of sweetness and oh so easy to drink. I'm on a steady diet of dead guy. Made right in my own back yard and it is super superb when really fresh."
