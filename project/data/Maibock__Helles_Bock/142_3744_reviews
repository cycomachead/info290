"Overall: A decent, suitable maibock."
"T: Very light with a slight malty breadiness. As it warms it tastes like grape bubblicious as well. Kind of strange."
"D: A good, spicy, fruity and floral brew with the fine drinkability of a German pilsener or lager but the full-bodied malt backbone of a study bock beer. The 6.5% ABV would sneak up on you after a while, but the combination of malt bittersweetness, floral roastiness and snappy, herbal hop finish are a very drinkable combination."
"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Pale gold with a big foamy white head. Very mild aroma, some biscuit-like malt and lightly sulfurous lager yeast. As it warms I pick out more malty/honey sweetness. It's light and clean on the palate, but decidedly more malty than Spaten's helles lager. There's little in the way of bitterness, It finishes clean and semi-dry, a bit bland but not bad."
"Mouthfeel is full of malt, medium bodied, slightly spritzy, sweet up front leading to a mildly sour but addictive aftertaste."
"Poured a pale, golden-copper; clarity was translucent. Head was one inch, dense, rocky and white in color. Nose was very light - something of a subtle wheat character and a hint of light fruit. Taste follows nose - wheat malt dominates, but the fruit is definitely more present and some light toffee notes are revealed as well. Mouthfeel is fairly light; however there is some consistency here, maybe better described as a slickness, an even, pleasant carbonation and a semi-dry finish. This is an exceptional Maibock - perhaps the best I've had. I found this beer to be tasty without being cloyingly sweet and also somewhat refreshing. Well worth your time if you get the opportunity to try this one."
"d - A good maibock. Lots of malts here, would definitely try again."
"Quite drinkable for a bock, refreshing and flavorful. Not my favorite style, but this is the best that I have had in this style. One not to miss when you see it on tap!"
"Found this on tap at Teske's German Restaurant in San Jose, CA. Enjoyed in a big ass mug fitting the German stereotype. It's a clear gold color with a healthy white head and good lacing. The aroma is sharp wheat and citrus with malt liquor underpinnings. The flavor offers thick malt and flowery bread. It's all you need to know. Crisp and lively with big carbonation yet a medium bodied brew with a touch of chewiness. Quite drinkable, refreshing and flavorful. A most anytime brew and one not to miss when you see it on tap, fresh and crispy like this."
"The beer pours a gold-orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of bready malt and some corn and wheat. The flavor is bready malt, grapes and floral hops. The flowers and grapes stand out quite a bit and a are a bit overwhelming. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Great golden color, interesting aroma, outstanding flavor. Lots of malty flavor without being too strong. i love this beer."
"D: This is quite a good maibock. Not my favourite style, but it is well made and true to the character of the May bock bier. Classic German lager."
"D -- Very good drinkability in this beer. I have to be honest and say that my first thought is that it reminded me of Capital's Maibock -- probably a big compliment to the Cap, but certainly a nice Bavarian Maibock on its own."
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"Stopped by Jacob Wirth last night with some friends for beer and pretzels. This maibock was served in a standard pint glass. Bright yellow color, but slightly hazy body. Very large white head. Had a yeasty and slightly citrus smell. Taste was extremely full of malt, almost a bit too much. Somewhat surprising for such a light colored beer. On the down side, I was not a fan of the mouthfeel of this beer. It seems to be overly thick and sticky on the palate, which seemed to detract from the drinkability. I am not sure if I like a maibock that is this malty. I would probably not order another one of these from Spaten again. Not worth the $6.50 pricetag."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with some honey highlights and a small wispy white that the basically settles into nothingness. The aroma is that of the doughy munich malt, black pepper and grassy hops. The taste is similiar to the aroma, doughy munich malt, pepper, honey and mineral water. Like a heavy munich lager, which it is supposed to taste like. Smooth flavor, not grainy, with a dash of spice from the hops. Moderate body, slightly chewy with tingly carbonation, finishes very smooth. A nice drinking maibock, ABV respectable, not ridiculous. Fine brew."
"Nice overall drinkability - a good lager for a nice Spring day on a bier garten patio."
"Overall this is the best maibock that I've ever tasted. It's so great to have FRESH German brews in the US."
"Poured medium gold that looked quite enticing, with modest head that was a good contrasting white. Nose had clean malty aromas. On the palate the malt came through nicely with a focus on the malt sweetness but not overly sweet. Light hoppiness for balance, and washes down very clean and malty. Excellent beer."
"Another delicious German lager!"
"To give you the rundown, this looks pretty good, tastes pretty good, and will kick your ass. It has a pale orange color, but with a bit of body to it (if that makes any sense). This reminds me of drinking honeysuckle with a sizzle of hops and a pinch of alcohol. Medium to full bodied, not difficult to put down. Although a little monotone in flavor, the balance is good in this beer. Oh, and you may want some small snacks in front you if you plan drinking a large quantity of it."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is good. This is fresh, light and easy to sip. I could easily have several or return to this. Two key words here are balance and subtlety. This is a beer to drink alone or with very mild food."
"I came close to not reviewing this beer. At first I questioned whether or not I was actually served the correct beer. I really questioned how this beer could be so far off from the traditional style, especially coming from Spaten. After consulting with another knowledgeable individual I was assured that this was norm for this beer. Spaten needs to reconsider it's recipe in my opinion."
"Drinkability - I would recommend allowing this beer to warm a bit from typical refrigerator temp. The body and profile becomes much more rounded and balanced once warm."
"On tap at the Glockenspiel Restaurant in St.Paul. Poured a clear straw-golden color with an inch or so of white foam. Aroma comes forward with bready malts, vanilla, and flowery noble hops. Unfortunately I also detect a noticeable amount of DMS (cooked cream corn) which I will ignore for now. Taste is much like the aroma but at least the DMS is not so bad here. Nice rich mouthfeel without being heavy and finishes just a touch sweet. Hop bitterness is restrained but enough to balance the sweetness nicely. Very thirst quenching. Without the DMS this beer would be really awesome so I will just assume that it was just one bad keg. I would definately order it again."
"I really enjoyed this one. It had a slightly sweet taste up-front but finished with a dry note and a hint of the hops. Carbonation was right on. Overall very refreshing. Spaten has been brewing beer for over 600 years so it figures they know what they're doing. Good stuff!"
"Got this beer on tap at the flying saucer in addison. This beer poured a yellow/golden color with a nice two finger head. The overall taste and smell went with your standard bocks. Left a very warm feeling once the glass was completed. I look forward to making this a spring staple at my favorite watering hole."
"It pours a clear amber with a thick, fine-bubbled white head. Aroma is strongly malty and has a fruity hint. Flavor is rich and malty and has a good zing to it - not complex, but tasty and enjoyable. Texture is smooth and pleasant. A nice spring ale."
"This one gets a lot better as it warms, so keep that in mind. Beer is a standard bock look, light brown with copper highlights. A small head that dissolves fast. Nose is light spicy malt, a touch of fruit. Taste is likewise although stronger: spices, caramel malt, a touch of hops at the end. Feel is solid, good body with nice funky carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer. I haven't had too many maibocks, but I prefer the Dead Guy."
"Pint from Raleigh's Flying Saucer. Served a crisp pale orange with a decent head that diminished to nothing. Aroma was a little weak, some sweet malts and sweet fruits, not much else. The taste was a wonderful malt abundance with slight hop bitterness in the finish, quite tasty! The beer was medium bodied with low carbonation. This one is very enjoyable, but it tends to be hard to find most of the time."
"Id have no problem session drinking these, especially in the spring/summer heat."
"got this on-tap at a local irish bar, never heard of maibock from spaten so i gave it a go. had a golden light color to it with a small frothy head, had some hoppiness to the nose and some maltiness as well. tasted very unique, looking at it you'd expect it to be lager-like but it had a very nice and surprising maltiness to it, the hops were present and were warm and spicy. very drinkable beer, a real treat."
"Overall a very tasty bock with very good drinkability."
"Golden/straw colors, slightly murky, thick 2 finger head. Smelled sweet and floral. The taste was fresh and earthy, strong floral hops, with some spice, yeast flavor, and a little bit of a hop taste to round it off. Left a long, floral aftertaste sitting on my tongue which, combined with its light carbonation and slightly heavy feel, gave this beer a wonderful moutfeel. Drinkable and enjoyable."
"Looks like a pilsner or kolsch with a golden straw yellow color. This is a nice standard Maibock. The aroma and flavor are of apple juice-like malts with a touck of bock-licorice and a earthy/spicy hops taste at the end. I enjoyed it and you probably would too."
"Served in a half-liter Spaten mug. The beer looked basically like a Czech pilsner: a golden straw color with a bubbly head that dissipated into nice lacing. It did not have the amber tinge I've seen in some maibocks. The smell was all caramel malt and hop bitterness. Taste was even bigger on the caramel flavors, with hop bitterness showing through in the end. There was also some graininess throughout. Mouthfeel was crisp, dry, and a little syrupy - an interesting combination. I had no trouble putting away half a liter of this stuff on a warm summer evening."
"D - Very nice maibock. I was very happy to find this available. Good drinkability."
"Opinion: This is a great beer and a good representation of the style. It is clean and super easy to drink which may confuse some people into thinking that this beer lacks substance. It has a squeaky-clean malt presence that even holds up after it is warm. This is a really good beer and that I will definitely be drinking again."
"Thick creamy mouthfeel, very easy drinking = a damn bood helles."
"Not the best of the style, but pretty good nonetheless."
"Fond this beer on tap at my favorite German Restaurant in Portland (Gustav's). They have it all year around despite the seasonal availability noted above. Poured into a traditional German bier stein. Nice thick white head that left a descent amount of lace as I finished my stein. Very sweet almost honey like on the nose. Pale yellow in color. Great alcoholic zip, smooth and well balanced. A bit of straw like hops on the finish. Nice carbonation. Overall a great brew to go with a fantastic dinner."
"The mouth feel was medium bodied, dry and crisp. Substantial, but easy. Very nice."
"Pours straw yellow with a large bubbly head, very carbonated. Smell is floral with very noticeable hops, light malts in the back. Taste follows suit, is a bit like an IPA, hoppy, has some decent flavors, but the bitterness lingers with only some compensation. I was expecting some fuller flavors. But, good drinkability, and altogether decently enjoyable."
"D - very, very tasty seasonal brew. Size and alcohol content here would discourage me from making this a session beer, but definitely something to catch while it's around."
"Spaten's maibock is a rather descent brew. It pours a nice golden color, with moderately foamy head. The smell is of the sweet malts within. The taste is pleasant, being malty but nicley balanced. This is a good brew worth giving a go if you see it on tap some place."
"On tap at the Pizza Plant on Transit,poured a dull golden with a rather thin head with nothing left behind as it settled quickly.Cooked grain aromas mainly a touch of honey-malt but nothing strong,now the flavors to me were more assertive quite grainy and vegetale with some token sweetness and spicey hop in the finish.The alcohol is not assertive but is noticable,I like a good spring bock and this fit the bill nicely for me."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not much else to say really. Drinkability is superb. I easily put down my half liter. The menu said 9%, but I definately didn't detect a bit of alcohol. Highly quafable with a nice clean malty finish. Glad I ordered this one."
"Served in a large tulip glass with a thick, frothy white head floating over the rest of the beer which was a pale, semi-opaque, golden color. Quite a bit of lacing was left behind in my glass. The carbonation level was moderate with soft bubbles surfacing slowly. Aromas of hard candy, roasted malt, ginger, and alcohol seemed to come out nicely. The taste was sweet with fruit-laiden backbone making it seem more like a Belgian Pale Ale than a Maibock. Various malt flavors and fruit flavors came out with time, as the beer warmed a bit. Impressive sweetness that rolled into a mild hop profile and finished slightly sour. A bit thin and slick in the mouth, but still highly drinkable. An enjoyable beer that I would like to have again."
"I like bocks, and the more bocky the better. This is indeed a bock, but a bit thinner and more rocky in presentation thatn I would gravitate toward. Don't get me wrong, in a pinch it would help fill a bock Jones. But with others so available, I don't see myself coming back this way again. It was good to try, but now I know it's close enough to just average that I have better options available to me."
"Pint at Flying Saucer in Raleigh."
"Now this is a very nice beer. Strong, but still quaffable."
"overall- $5.75 for a liter of this is what i paid. Excellent deal if you ask me. ide had enough after the one liter, but it was enjoyable while it lasted."
"D - Very nice. I wish I could find this on tap."
"Clean and clear golden hues, crystalline with few bubbles lingering. Big foamy white head that faded slighted but laced the glass. Smells almost like a white zinfandel which was kind of weird but pleasant. A bit sweet and something that amounts to raw almonds on the tongue. The finish is reasonably hoppy and pleasant. No lingering aftertaste and felt smooth and full in the mouth. Very drinkable on a warm summer day."
"The aftertaste is malted too; just a hint of hop in the finish. Decent bock."
"241"
"Drinkable? Yes it is. Ive now tried this multiple times on-tap at the Huber-Haus in Omaha. I belly up to the bar and order round after round. This is a solid Maibock. Recommended."
"This beer poured a deep, clear gold with a thin white head. Hmmm.. Looks like a pilsner. The aroma is a clean malty smell mixed with a citrus hop. Very crisp smelling Hmmm. Smells like a pilsner. Very crisp tasting. Crisp pilsner taste from German hops Hallertau? Crisp hop flavor, more grapefruit. Slick mouth feel good drinakbility. Except for the addition of a good strong hop flavor, this came off to me like a pilsner. Thats not bad, just not true to style. I liked this beer, and will have another in the future."
"From notes. This beer arrived a slightly golden straw color with a small head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was weak, save some honey and caramel sweetness. The flavor was not good to me. Astringent harsh grainey quality dominated a slight caramel finish. The feel was moderate. Overall, I found this beer lacking. I will be avoiding it in the future."
"Drinkability: Really surprised me, especially since I went into the restaurant with a thirst for a big, dark beer. But I really liked this one a lot. A little too meaty to be too sessionable, but that not a bad thing at all. Bocks are typically a springtime beer, and the spring-like qualities of the beer make it very enjoyable. Definitely worth a try."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a medium gold color with one finger of head. There's a little bit of lacing. The smell is nicely balanced, with sweet caramel malt mixing well with grassy hops. The taste is about the same. It's very malty with some caramel sweetness and just a hint of hops. It tastes almost like a pilsener. The mouthfeel is decently thick and the drinkability is good. A decent maibock."
"Pours a nice golden color with white head that is a pleasure, the smell is a nice sweet caramel and floral hop that added great distinction to the nose. The taste is a nice smooth rich caramel with a nice light floral fruit hop, a slight mixed berry taste goes well with the caramel smoothness, nice effort."
"Drinkable, but not very memorable."
"Came in a pint glass and had a nice golden color to it. Smell consisted of malts, grains, with some honey and sweet aromas in there. Not bad. Taste wasn't bad either. A little bitter to start out then the sweetness kinda explode in your mouth combined with some malts and grains. Mouthfeel was ok, the sweetness was a little cloying at times which brought down the drinkability. All in all, not a bad brew by any means. Order this if you see it."
"Very easy to drink. I will be ordering again."
"On-Tap at Gasthas Bavarian Hunter in Stillwater - Served in a dimpled liter mug, approaches me a glowingly solid, thickset gold color with a firm, thin white cap of foam. Aroma is of dulled fruity malts, a slight dusty edge of bread yeast and toasted crusts with a pinch of grassy hops. Taste is thick and chewy, lots of malted sweetness with a nice toasty ring to its middle. Smooth, sweetly bready, and delightful. The sweetness of dulled fruityness and bread continues to surge for a good long while after each sip. Hops are very tiny with some floral and grass tinges just before the finish. Feel is quite thick and malt laden with stodgyness, sweetly lingering to the point of almost cloying. A very nice Maibock, quite thick in its character. I enjoyed this immensely, but the overall thickness seemed to draw out its full potential in regards to it becoming a solid sessionable brew."
"clear golden tan in color. 1/4"" of white foam subsides rather quickly and is gone for good. big malty aroma that protrays a complex fruitiness. well carbonated, quite refreshing while still remaining somewhat full and chewy. sweet passionfruit flavors and a touch of graininess. signature noble german hop flavor at the end keeps this beer in balance. tasty and quite drinkable. i don't see this around too much, but i would grab one when i could. good stuff."
"very yellow, with a nice white head. smells nicely hallertauy and pretty alcoholic. The flavour mainly consists of bad vodka, which is joined by pepper, a bit of malt, and a dry herbal finish again dominated by the vodka. It must only be 6.5-7% or something but it tastes as alcoholic as EKU28. not that i mind that too much. there's a bit of bitterness but it's kind of thin and edgy, like it's hop extract rather than whole hops. i like the normal bock better, that's got a bit more malt guts."
"I had four of these at Anam Cara this past Saturday which means one thing (to me at least): this beer was in perfect shape, and the drinkability kicked ass. All pours were clear, clear golden. Small white head went away pretty quickly. Aroma came across as slightly malty, with a touch of fresh grain. Mouthfeel is properly carbonated, and medium body is very pleasant. Taste is slightly sweet from the malt, you get some hoppiness in the finish. If I didn't know, I would have sworn I was drinking them in D-Land, that's how tasty this was. Good stuff."
"The beer pours from the tap a distinctly clear and golden yellow color with a hefty brilliant white and creamy head, the lace a filmy curtain to drape the glass. Nose is citrus crisp, and malt sweet, pleasingly fresh and a real treat, start is nicely malted and lightly sweet, the top is moderate in body. Finish is masterfully hopped, the carbonation brisk and the aftertaste quite dry, a fine drinking beer and one Ive never seen around these parts."
"A good drinkable pint that went well with my Bavarian Sausage platter."
"A wonderful beer. Nicely hopped for aroma and bitterness which were perfectly balanced to match the nics dry crisp taste. The taste was slightly spicely and bitter leaving the mouth dry. It had a nice crisp and dry taste that which is what you expected from looking at this nice copper clear beer. A good amount of head which retained throughout. Overall a great light lager."
"This is definitely my favorite mai bock."
"Poured a golden color with a thin, white head that dissipated quickly. There is no noticeable aroma. The mouthfeel is too carbonated for my tastes. The flavor is watery, with light yeast and fruit. No hop presence, not much presence at all. I found this one disappointing."
"Was poured with creamy white foaming head that pairs nicely with th vibrant golden hue of the beer. Served up in the official Spaten glass at the Sharp Edge, the aroma consists of malt sweetness laced with the European hops providing a mildly floral hop aroma. This is a great crisp lager that has fruit tones of sweetness along with balanced bitterness to form a really refreshing lager, the maibock form of Spaten comes with a decent kick of alchol in the flavor. A very drinkable classic that was great for a hot sunny day like yesterday."
"A big solid malt flavor dominates this one. It is blended well with a mix of fruits, orange being the most noticable. Crisp carbonation starts you out, and it then smoothes to a nice silky mouthfeel. Very easy to drink, and you could have a few at a sitting. Not a beer I would like to miss out on."
"Prost!"
"Medium copper body with amber highlights. Served with a thin off-white head that showed very good retention. Very fruity aroma, with a slight alcohol note mixed with a touch of hops. The restrained malt flavor has a bit of a graininess to it, but shows good sweetness atop a creamy mouthfeel. Decent bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is robust and full, but yet a bit harsh. The slightly malty, slightly bitter aftertaste refuses to go away, and the beer becomes a bit of a nuisance half way through. It feels as though I could go 15 minutes between drinks and still feel like I was drinking continuously. Not a bad beer, but it just never seemed to ""finish"". In my dreams I thought a never-ending beer would be great. Well, it's not bad, but I couldn't drink it frequently."
"Had this on tap.  What a treat.  One of the most beautiful beers I have laid my eyes upon.  Invitingly golden in color.  Great head.  Smell of subdued malts.  Tasting this on tap is a treat.  Smooth is an understatement.   Great clean malt taste.  Hops only seem to be around for balance as they contribute little to the taste.  If you look up ""nectar of the gods"" in the dictionary, surely a picture of this will be present."
