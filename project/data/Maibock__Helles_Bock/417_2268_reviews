"Overall : I think it's a good beer - but it's not my style personally. I think they did well here, and I'll have it again."
""
"A really nice Maibock. Pours clear with nice white head. Both aroma and taste are hop forward. Perhaps a little lighter malt base than is typical."
""
"Frankly, I detect very little malt to this.  It's more like a pale version of a pale ale, with a distinct, but mild hoppiness and little else.  I wouldn't have guessed this would be marketed as a blonde doppelbock.  It's a disappointment."

" Pours a lighter amber in color with a 2+-finger white head. Left good lacing with each sip. The aroma is of malty grain with a hint of citrus. The taste was sweeter than the aroma with perfect carbonation. The flavors of caramel malts and grains with a hint of dark fruit and citrus. Very surprised at a good taste this type of brew was. Went down smooth and easy."

"Medium-bodied with lightly effervescent carbonation, though never feeling overcarbonated. Result is a smooth, slightly foamy-pillowy mouthfeel. Finish is semi-dry with modest stickiness lingering on the palate."
"Light amber with a solid quilt of light creamy foam. Smells of sweet malts, hint of carbboard, artificial cherry, some sweet biscuit. Flavor is quite sweet, some herbal character, some tea, some grain and orange. Medium bodied with sharp, but fleeting carb and a moderately wet finish. Not my favorite."

"Comments: Love this beer, one of the first beers I ever had, and really turned me on to craft beer. I hadn't had it in a while and wondered if it still lived up to my memories of it. Happy to say it has held up well. Still a really wonderful beer, as good or better as my memories."
""
""

"Final Thoughts: I've had better Maibocks than this one. Perhaps the bottle was a little further past the expiration date than I thought (couldn't find a date anywhere on the bottle). If you like a big blast of malt then this one will give you that, but it really doesn't even do that completely well."

"O= Much more bitter than most bocks I've had. I actually like the change. Worth trying and buying for a bocky change."

"Medium bodied, sticky sweet aftertaste, with average carbonation. I like this beer quite a bit, and am surprised it took this long to sit down and write a review."

"Light caramel, bready notes are highlighted here. Sweet with a light undertone of some herbal hops peeking though. A light touch of dark fruit perhaps? Possibly but a sweet, caramel malty lager type aroma is what is predominant here. Caramel, and toffee, hints of buttery like notes persisting now as it comes up in temperature."
"My first brew from August Schell Brewing and I am pleasantly surprised – I’ll have another!"
""
"Drinkability: Wow. All I can think about right now is the five bottles of this still chilling in my fridge. How am I going to make myself drink them? The first bottle became tolerable after it warmed for about 10 minutes, but otherwise I was very disappointed. I hope it was a bad bottle."
"Overall: A very solid version of a Maibock from Shell's."
"(sidenote) proud to be the 100th review of this brew!"
"Overall pretty good, will enjoy again I'm sure."
"Very drinkable. Overall a very solid, if not overly exciting, brew."
"This is one of the first August Schell beers I've had, and it didn't disappoint. The Maifest pours a light copper/orange color. There is a nice head on this beer that lingers and laces the glass as you drink. This beer has a very pleasing smell, almost sweet. The Maifest has some very good flavor too, nothing overpowering though. I find the 7.2% ABV to be very well hidden. I recommend having this beer. I know I look forward to having it again."
"D - I thought I might be disappointed in this beer but I was rather surprised. This was a solid offering from August Schell, and one I would certainly recommend for a try."
"D - Not a bad beer at all...a little out of my range for favorite styles. Very malty, definitely balanced to the sweet side. Flavors are a bit heavy, not at all what I would call refreshing or crisp. It's a smooth cool weather beer that isn't a sipper or a pounder. It'll take some time to get thru it...but not a lot of time."
"D - Pretty good brew, not one of my favorites from Schells but still a good drinker. Glad I had the brew but wouldn't seek it out again."
"Schell's Maifest feels medium-sized with an effortless bite and tingle. It goes down nicely and leaves the mouth feeling almost as if it just experienced a butterscotch sunday, but still shy of that cloying characteristic. A lot of malty-goodness in this brew; can't forget to point that out. I'm certain I could sit at a bar and savor 4-5 pints of this one. Cheers!"
"Context: (instead of Drinkable) I brought this home and opened the first too soon, not allowing time to cool properly - that was a wasted drink. Third beer, which is where this review comes from, 3:00 in afternoon, SE Minnesota, overcast day, June, done with work - a pleasant brew to enjoy while waiting for the family to get home relaxing or talking with friends over an evening pre summer fire pit or BBQ. Incidentally, the fourth and fifth went very well with seasoned grilled ball-tip steak and fried red potatoes."
"D: I could probably get a few down but is a little sweet and the hop character can be a bit offputting I think."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's an okay Maibock, but is simply too sweet and alcoholic for my personal tastes."
"Picked up the maifest from Schell, I liked it better than Summit's version in that it hides the alcohol much better. The flavors seem to meld together well. A pretty good beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Refreshing for a spring day."
"Conclusion: Not bad really, but not something I'll probably go back to...Schell's has a few quite tasty beers...this isn't one of 'em IMO"
"Pours a surprisingly lively deep corn-golden. Nice billowey, frothy head, but it dissipates fairly fast. Doesn't smell like much, almost like thanksgiving maize, a bit nutty, a bit roasty. Clean lager smell. Tastes clean, a bit nutty, but not that real sharpness you sometime get. Clean and smooth, Not the fullest feeling, but it is clean and refreshing. I like this a lot better than Dead Guy, for example."
"D: This is a good, if not great Maibock. It could stand a bit more complexity, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, slight alcohol, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, and slight roasted malt, and very slight hop. Overall, a refreshing Maibock with good body and easy drinkability. It might not have the complexity, but still a good Maibock."
"D -- Very good drinkability for a 7% beer. This stands up to the better Maibocks out there -- yes, even Capital. Very nice brew."
"D: Pretty high. I would order another and I'm glad I bought a six pack."
"Maifest is medium in body and seems to fit the style--not as substantial as a doppelbock, but not watery either. The cherry and alcohol presence seems to make the finish a bit astringent, though this isn't unpleasant. While the ABV isn't low, I felt like the beer was pretty drinkable, probably because the taste and mouthfeel aren't overstated. I really enjoyed this one from Schell!"
"Overall, this is an easy drinking beer. This 20 oz went quick. It seems to be a very simple beer with not to many big flavors attached to it. I could have more in a night."
"Nowhere near a drainpour, but I wasn't impressed considering how many other great Maibocks there are."
"Really enjoyable and a very, very drinkable beer. Maibocks are wonderful, and although Schell's isn't a favorite brewery (this is my sixth Schell's) their Maifest is wholly satisfying."
"Another above average beer from Schell's. Nothing special, but definitely a good beer."
"D-I've loved this brew for many years now and am again pleased with this brew. Smooth, very flavorful and interesting, this brew is one to savor each spring."
"I don't know much about this style, but I found the beer crisp and refreshing and not at all complicated. Better then BMC, not expensive, would make a decent session/party beer. The flavor is pretty light, I mean it probably doesn't even need to be poured in a glass."
"Don't get me wrong, I will always buy a 6 or 12 pack of this in the spring but that is it. Give me the Schell's Dark or Stout any day. YES!!!!"
"The taste is fruity with whole wheat up front, a bit pungent, sweet with some bitterness and a clear hint of the alcohol strength. However, the alcohol element starts to overpower the rest, the flavour quickly degrades, and it becomes very rough with a light but sharp and unpleasant bitterness becoming evident. The result is that the beer smacks your mouth a bit but without much flavour. It's also heavy and strong for the low flavour, and quickly gets tiresome."
"D - This is a good brew! The high ABV is a little bit hindering as far as sessionability, but I would pick this up in a heartbeat."
"Flavor is some caramel and grainy malt with just a bit of fruit, apricot maybe, but then the flavor rolls to some earthy and spicy hops. Not very bitter but dominant on the palate. No ABV hints and the beer is very drinkable. I wish that the flavor and nose were a little bigger, but overall the beer is nice to drink and is extra good on this hot June evening."
"Drinkability: While the ABV could keep this from being sessionable, the taste and ease of consumption do not. I really enjoyed this beer. Easy to drink, not too heavy or filling, tasty. It would be easy to have a few too many of this. I would get more of this if I can this spring before it is gone (I maybe too late already)."
"Tasted on 3/25/08."
"This is a decently drinkable beer. I don't think I'll seek it out in the future, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"Not quite full-bodied but close. Decent carbonation, nice and crisp, and quite tasty on a spring day."
"D: It is an excellent warm spring day brew. It is smooth, has good mouth feel and enough kick to be fun."
"Has a medium body with enough carbonation to give it some life. The ABV is a little high for me to rate drinkability higher."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, a little on the fruity sweet side, but a perfect spring beer. Left me a bit more buzzed then I intended to be. I would definatly buy this again. Summit Maibock would be my preference over this beer though."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet for my liking, but not too bad. I wouldn't seek this out again."
"Drinkability- Overall, the taste didn't really live up to the smell and appearance. Not a bad offering, but not something I will visit often."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is large, frothy, and recedes very slowly into thick, chunky lacing. The aroma is of biscuit malt, with a hint of caramel, and a lot of floral hops. The taste is as vibrant as the aroma with a long noble hop finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer, and a wonderful maibock. I will certainly drink this again."
"Mouth feel is smooth. Alcohol is hidden. This beer is very easy to drink."
"D- The drinkability was pretty good. This beer really helped to raise my hopes that spring's right around the corner. Too bad the weather hasn't been as agreeable."
"Drinkability: About as fun as being eaten by sand weevils."
"Not too bad, but a Schell's seasonal that I have fond memories of."
"Cheers."
"The mouthfeel is the only thing that I particularly like about this beer. Very warm, very creamy medium-full body with excellent carbonation. Unfortunately it's just too sweet and sticky to really enjoy, particularly with the above-average alcohol content."
"Poured a dark golden color with minimal head that dissipated rather quickly. Had somewhat of a spicey aroma to it. Taste was malty, but not too sweet. Something is missing in the flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Ok, but I would definitely not seek out."
"Pours a fizzy golden tan color with a nice fluffy white head. The aroma is rich and malty. Very nice smell, sweet and almost fruity. The taste is decent, rich and malty. A smooth, flavorful, impressing beer. The mouthfeel is big and heavy, yet it consistently goes down smooth. Drinkability is excellent, expecially when considering the heavy feel. Surely recommended."
"i was confused to see this described as bock, as it poured a pale gold in the glass--but have since learned that maibocks are less malty than traditional bocks. lots of floral, hoppy aroma but not obnoxiously hoppy in the mouth. very drinkable, and dangerously so at 7% abv. very active carbonation. holds its thin head for quite a while. a great beer for a lazy weekend afternoon on the back porch."
"D - This is a pretty good offering from August Schell. I wish that I had more than just one on hand."
"Poured into a pilsner a rich clear golden with well formed fluffy 1 1/2 finger white head good carbonation and head retention to this brew.Notes of caramel malt some veg in the nose somewhat light but noticeable a hint of floral hop as well.Pretty light in the mouthfeel department lightly sweet but quite crisp caramel sweetness being the dominant flavor up front with underlying white grape skin flavors and moderate toastiness as well.A lighter spring bock but of decent quality and it is drinkable for the style."
"D: Tastes like nothing I've had before but I would not try this one again."
"Part of a sampler pack purchased at Dinkytown Wine and Spirits, MPLS"
"D. Good session beer if was more easily available in my area."
"overall this is a very enjoyable beer that i find very refreshing, deffinatly will be in my fridge again"
"Overall, I think this is a good Maibock, very tasty. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"Very drinkable if you're in this mood. I'd come to expect less of the beers in the sample-6-pack after my first experience with one, and after reading the reviews, but this is one fine beer."
"Drinkability: Despite possibly inconsistent style elements, this is a drinkable beer."
"A bit light on the tongue, for the strong flavors at the end of the beer, but fairly drinkable. Not too bad overall."
"Drinks about average, too far departed from the grand style of the motherland for me to reccomend"
"This beer by Schell's gives their Firebrick Lager a run for its money. Brownish amber in color, slight head. The smell is a bit sweet, of pale and caramel malts. Initially the flavor is a bit grain like, toasted caramel and toffee flavor, but it has a great finish, almost similar to drinking an apple cider, rather sweet and fruity. This is a solid Mai Bock, quite drinkable for the style, I could have more than 2 or 3, but it wont knock your socks off."
"Maifest is probably my third favorite ASBC beer after Pale Ale and Pilsner. It needs a little more *something*, although I'm not sure what. If you love the style, or even like it, and it's available where you live, I'd recommend giving this one a go. It isn't exactly 'my bock', but it might be yours."
"over all i like this beer it goes down easy and tastes great."
"drinkability: pretty easy"
"12 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with a small creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Fruity, bready aromas, sweet green apple, pear and caramel flavors. Medium to full bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, finishes sweet."
"Pours a golden amber into the pint glass. Nice half inch or better head. Dissipates fairly quickly leaving spotty lacing down the inside of the glass. Sweetish aroma. Tastes of pear and licorice. A nice maibock. I haven't had this before, but will have it again. Schell's makes a good beer when they try."
"got this in a trade and I can not find my paper on who sent it to me. but thanks who ever you are. from the bottle, poured a copper with a small white head that didnt last very long. aroma there sure is some malts in there and hops, lemon. flavor a a like on the weak side malts and hops with a tanging lemon and a touch of molasses as it warmed. not to bad. session beer if I could get more"
"Mouthfeel is where I like to see it for the style and the carbonation is nice...glad to try this one, but not itching to have another."
"D- This beer has a surprising maltyness for the light body but it has lots of good character. Good complexity and very well built this beer is light in color but big on flavor."
"This is one grand springtime beer. Grab a sixer when it starts warming up outside and go sit by a river or in a field or something. Or just drink them at home, in front of your computer, with the window open."
"Light shade of copper. Nice clarity. Medium sized dirty white head. Lacing is moderate. Thick juicy malts on the nose. And fruits...grapes and apples come to mind. Nice, sweet aroma. This leads into a nice, sweet flavor profile. With a lot of the same in common with the nose. The apples and grapes and also pears are noticeable. And sweet, sweet malts...without being cloying. Hops only provide balance and are undetectable, save for a slight dryness to the finish. The body is full and round and the carbonation delicate. Probably my favorite offering from Schell's, with the possible exception of their Hefe."
"Much different then I remember the on-tap version being. Malt levels are very in-your-face and almost has a ""raw"" feeling to it. Alcohol is also very present in the taste. I would almost say this could be a candidate for aging for a year, perhaps I'll buy a 12'er and drink one every month for a year. Still worth trying, and I recommend it to anyone."
"Sweet, caramelly, brandy malt flavors up front, but these are tempered by some bitter, vegetal hops. Overall, more on the bitter side (for a maibock). Malt gets reduced to a vegetable/carrot flavor near the end. Finish stays bitter. Full/big body, and almost too mouth-coating."
"Drinkability and overall: I liked this one. Again, with Schell, they are good beer but there is a macro feel to them. I can't put my finger on it but I just can't taste the attention to detail with these beers like I do other craft beers. I know that's very subjective but that's the best way I know how to describe it. A good but not great beer."
"A Summer Cheers to FeloniousMonk for this Spring Seasonal from August Schell."
"Super crystal clear agate amber color with a puffy finger high head of off-white foam that fizzes away fairly quickly to a thin all-over skim, lacing drips back in quick leaving very minimal spots. Aroma is highly sweet of fresh bagel dough and lighter caramelness with vanilla, dulled grasses, and slight banana esters underneath. Taste is more of the same, with a very sweet and malty charge from front to back thats dulled of fruity-candyish waffer cookie things with small hints of grassy herbal spices peaking around the edges of the palate. Some grainy-sweet corn like sweetness mixes in there at a non-threatning level. Always keeps a decent balance of malty sweetner. Slightly crisp and drying in the finish, medium body feel, but overall slightly chewy and buttery slick, but in a light way not heavy. This was surprising to say the least, quite tasty and refreshing, one I'l have again....and again..."
"This beer is a dark gold/light brown color, with a bubbly cream head on the top. The scent is that malty maibock scent we all know and love. Taste is malty, pretty typical for maibockm greater emphasis on bitter hops than usual for the style. Also has some weird taste like copper pennies or something. Nothing horrible, but not the best blended brew."
"Not a bold version of style. More subtle than I normally think of, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Good, though, I'd never say no to one!"
"A creamy off-white head rests lazily above a clear golden-amber body as very fine-bubbles rise steadily upwards. The head holds quite well, and it maintaina a solid covering throughout most of the glass. Additionally, the lacing is nice except that it doesn't seem able to stick to the glass and disappears momentarily. The nose reveals a limited amount of malt, some mild fermentation esters, and a light note of alcohol. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth due to it's full body and very fine, moderate carbonation. A rich, grainy malt displays a light touch of toastiness and some mild fruitiness in the flavor; and it's well-balanced by a low level bitterness that barely emerges except to help dry the finish along with a wash of alcohol. The alcohol is somewhat apparent, however, and tends to intrude half-way through the glass. Still, it's a decent example of the style and could readily be enjoyed as one of the first beers of spring."
"Pours to a hazy deep golden color. The head fades to a ring. The aroma is yeasty, spicy, and caramel malty. The flavor has the caramel malts, spicy hop flavor, and a bit of alcohol. This as an okay beer, not up to par with other maibocks. It is a definite warmer; medium-bodied and easy drinking for its strength."
"Schell Maifest: a brown beer with golden highlights. Not much head, and not too much in the way of lacing. Very weak aroma, but that’s not all that unusual. This is a very heavily malted beer, with a caramel taste, that is somewhat grainy and processed. There is a pleasant smoky aftertaste that brings the taste score up a little. Easy drinking, but I’ve had better manifests lately."
"Thinner and fizzier than expected. Needs more malt, more heft and smoother transitions to accomplish the ""blonde double bock"" it is billed."
"Bright deep gold color (exactly the color of standard bourbon), nice 1/2 inch head of very small bubbles and decent duration. Laces don't hold up well. Yeasty vanilla aromas, subtle. Malty flavors predominate as expected -- best described as leaning toward gingerbread in quality, with a bit of bitter marmalade mid mouth. Finishes in a similar vein with some artificial caramel aftertaste. Hops may contribute slightly to the bitter orange sense. Overall, thin mouthfeel for a beer described as a ""Blonde Double Bock", but an OK Lager overall."
"Pours a copper/amber color with little head. Hints of caramel and very sweet for a double bock. A very smooth drink, almost as smooth as a lager. Very drinkable brew, I consider this to be Schell's finest offering and won't hesitate to try in the near future. A good fall beer."
"a re-review...a blonde doppelbock that is a deep copper colored, pours out a moderate head and leaves a bit of lace. the very nice sweet caramel malt aroma is followed by a rich and thick malty body. wow is this sweet. alcohol makes itself known...very tasty; a bit of a soapy taste but i can overlook that. the first time i reviewed this beer, i bought a sixer knowing it was old and slammed this brew. i found it again, out of season once more and decided to give it another shot and glad i did. much better than the first time i tried it. a spring time warmer that is a very pleasant early winter surprise in minnesota."
"Copper with short lasting head.  The aroma was malt with some caramel and maybe vanilla tones (but faint).  The hops was nice, but the malt was very big, as it should be.  There was decent carbonation and long lasting flavor.  A very drinkable beer and probable Schell's best offering (from what I have sampled)."
"re-rated next to Capital Blond Doppel and this is not as good, but still an excellent beer..I dropped the rating from an itial 4.9 to the current number"
