Nose is heavily malted and a bit stale, lots of caramel malts, overly toasted, lots of sugar.  Taste follows suit, a little less stale, way too much sugar, lots of caramel malts and toasted grains, very little hop profile and no clean grains.  Syrupy feel, soft carb, too big and full.","cpetrone84","Dec 12, 2014"

3.78,9.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced earthy hop, bready malt, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of earthy hops, bready malts, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good maibock. Robust and well balanced earthy hop, bready malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2014"

3.63,4.9,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, lemon and a tart vegetal element. Flavor of biscuit and mildly bready malt, wheat, lightly tart lemon and apple juice, finishing with biscuit and European hop flavor and bitterness. Medium bodied. An interesting take on a bock style beer, more similar in profile to a biscuity lager, but with light German bock flavors woven into the taste. At first the lagerish malt and hops are unexpected from a bock, somewhat drier, but the flavor is intriguing and pleasant. Although it is not really to style, this beer has suggestions towards the original maibock while presenting its own malty flavors. Drier and less sweet than a typical maibock, but an enjoyable beer. As the beer opened up in the glass, a pleasant floral element developed in the hop finish.","LiquidAmber","Feb 09, 2014"

3.52,1.7,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"this is everything a bright bock should be, grain driven, clear pale golden in color, heady, dense, clean finishing, and bready as the authentic german editions, but it is also some things it shouldn't be, semisweet, overly filling, and expensive. lager yeast marries well with robust grain, maybe some wheat, but definitely german pale malt, and the result is a decidedly malty and heavy light beer, carbonated like its namesake literally demands, but still filling and heavy to drink a lot of. not as clean finishing as others, and while the lager yeast tries its hardest, the residual sugar is still there in enough concentration to make this even more filling. i like american made bocks, and this is a pretty good one as they go, with a nice nod to tradition, but its not quite as clean as it should be, and its rather pricey at 9 bucks a go.","StonedTrippin","Jan 13, 2014"

2.85,-17.6,3.75,3,2.75,2.5,2.75,"A nice looking beer that doesn't quite follow-up with taste, aroma, or feel. There is just there barest hint of toasted malt, but it's strongly overshadowed with a brazen bitterness. The mouthfeel comes across coarsely. Drinkable (barely) but definitely unbalanced and unrefined.","beergoot","Nov 07, 2013"
3.78,9.2,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like bready/grainy malt, floral hops, toffee, and some fruitiness. I think this taste is mostly like the aroma, but there's also some honey, nuts and light citrus flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, smooth and easy enough to drink. It's also well carbonated. I liked this brew, I'd buy it again in the future. $5.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Beers"

As I mentioned above, this brew has a slightly odd and random assortment of flavors, some of which fit the traditional profile for the style, and some of which don't.

The nose comprises dry wheat, mild grass, flowers, light honey, and a touch of sweet oatmeal. Honestly, there are certain sniffs that elicit memories of Honey Nut Cheerios (only positively, considering I dislike the cereal). The taste brings in more of the same, along with candied orange peel, light powdered sugar, and a light kiss of red apple skin. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying-ish finish. Overall, a solid, enjoyable helles bock, one that follows tradition to a point, then proceeds down its own path. We need more of that in our beer lives...","TMoney2591","Sep 13, 2013"
