Smell is not very powerful, brown sugar and bready. Taste matches aroma adequately, with addition of pineapple and some spices. Higher carbonation lingers on front and middle of tongue for half a minute or so. Decent body, not as heavy as I had imagined, a little on watery side.

That night after a day of steelhead fishing I opened my growler and was almost blown away at how good that Dead Guy was from draft.

I tend to pass on more common/available beers in favor of more obscure (typically foreign brews). I was delighted to find a modern, West Coast brew that was not dominated by hops.  But then this is from Oregon, not CA.  This is a very good beer, well balanced, offering an uncommon flavor profile. It would pair nicely with duck.","ph001c","Nov 18, 2014"

APPEARANCE: slow, steady bubbles are mired within an opaquely beautiful orange brown body; creamy, substantial off-white head; lacing creates white fencing... AROMA: strong citric cleansing power--peach, tangerine, and orange--weds with soft pine to produce a sweet, rewarding allure... PALATE: smooth, active and bubbling to the tongue; simmering and balanced, if not a little difficult to place--could be the ale/bock moniker coming to fruition; still, highly drinkable for a beer nearly 7% ABV.....TASTE: intense melon, ear-tingling hops, and a solid malt base at the throat creates a full, demanding taste; nothing Dead here!  ... OVERALL:this hybrid beguiled me at first--seeking the ale, malt made me rethink everything--the style, the glass, the night...then, seeking the malt, the crunch of West Coast hops puts me square back in a pint glass... this beer makes me ask too many questions and, frankly, I do not mind--complex and rewarding....","dacrza1","Oct 14, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light dark fruit, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice maibock style. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 07, 2014"

4.04,2.3,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy medium coppery amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of biscuit and caramel malt, mild citrus hops, pleasantly malty. Flavor is semi-sweet caramel malt with slight biscuit, mellow nondescript stone fruit, developing and finishing with spicy hops with light pine and citrus elements. Great balance. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I'm really overdue to review this Northwest classic, which I started drinking ages ago as Wolfeel Ale. One of the early flavorful beers that pulled me into craft styles. Nothing really stands out in this maibock, but it is almost perfectly balanced with a nice flavor progression from the lightly sweet maltiness into a good, non herbal mild hop finish. Really a fine example of the style (but with a domestic slant) and a great drinking beer. Very nice malt flavors. Glad to revisit it.","LiquidAmber","Jul 01, 2014"

Medium body with a smooth texture that hints at oily resin. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The complex flavor profile is quite nice and well balanced. It begins with a citric tartness, flows into a softer caramel light sweetness that gradually comes to the forefront with a bit of spicy heat. It finishes with a sweet fade into light hop bitterness coupled with a light spicy hop flavor. An outstanding and well crafted maibock.","tillmac62","Jun 27, 2014"

The first taste was nice and crisp with a little bit of vanilla and banana sweetness to it which then yielded to a nice yeast taste. The balance was very nice which transitioned to a piney yet subtle hop finish that made the beer incredibly drinkable regardless of weather. A very good beer worth trying.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 18, 2014"

My tastes may be biased, however, as I am a fan of IPA's and dark, heavy beers, and this is dead center between the two. Overall I wouldn't NOT recommend it but wouldn't push strongly TO recommend it. Perhaps the word 'bland' fits as a description.

It was really refreshing which was one of my favorite qualities of it. All around, I gave this one a solid 3.5. If you're sitting at a bar reading this wondering if it's a good call, go for it!

Pours a beautiful cloudy dark orange/amber color with a very thin white head. It has a pleasant light fruity smell to it. Very drinkable and has some caramel malt flavor to it and well balanced slight bitter hop taste. It's full bodied but refreshing and easy drinking. This is a great beer and it will be on my purchase again list no doubt. Nice job to Rogue, i'll be looking to try some more brews from this company.","MIchelle","Apr 27, 2014"

Its dark color is a great to see in a tall glass and provides a mature rich taste compared to some other ales I've had. Its taste is very powerful at first and then relaxes, which is what an ale should do. If there’s somewhere where this is on tap please let me know. Bottled is great but I’m guessing on tap would provide a better taste and you would be able to taste the ingredients more. I highly recommend this beer.","Trooper92292","Feb 18, 2014"

There is a Xmas cookie-like flavor here; biscuit-y and slightly sweet; with hints of orange and lemon to add to the overall dimension of things. The hop bitterness blends well with the malts and completes the package, adding nice overall depth and complexity to this palate pleaser.","beergoot","Jan 02, 2014"

Thick & bready in the mouth with good carbonation.Honey up front, then caramel and other malt sweetness, followed by an awesome, bitter finish that lingers on the tongue awhile. More dry & hoppy than other Bocks I've had. Noticeable warming from the alcohol after you swallow.","anarchia","Dec 01, 2013"

Didn't get too much out of the nose but the flavor is rich and extremely malty with a thick, full mouthfeel. There's a very strong hop presence that lingers throughout the sip; hard to place exact flavors. This beer seems to be all over the place but is extremely tasty and satisfying. A cross between a pale ale and an amber. My only complaint would be its muddled, undefined flavor that doesn't quite allow anything to stand out. Definitely worth trying, but not something I'd return to regularly.","Aaron_Ramson","Nov 16, 2013"

Served Ice cold the Dead Guy Ale can taste like a cheap gas station beer, but once it warms all of the deep malty character come out. It pours a honey color with an off-white head and sweet caramel aroma. The taste is all malts, with big sweet malt and caramel notes and a nice depth that lingers on the palate. This is a definitely a complex beer for a Maibock and a great counterpoint to all the IPAs I have been drinking lately. It has deceptively high alcohol content for the very smooth and easy drinking beer. The Dead Guy Ale was a nicely balanced and outstanding beer.","brurevu","Oct 23, 2013"

The aroma is of malty grains with a hint of caramel with maybe apricot. Pretty much was the taste as well as with a hint of spice. Good balance of flavor and smooth to drink. No harsh or bad aftertaste was noted. Overall a fine brew","BeerWithMike","Oct 18, 2013"

It's not all fruity and bitter like some IPAs'. It's not watered down by any means like mainstream American beer. It goes down smooth and at 6.5% abv, it's outstandingly palatable.

Aroma was sweet, fairly floral, spicy Noble hops. Taste was a really complex mosaic of light caramel, aromatic biscuit, lemon, dry chocolate powder, orange, honey, and tobacco with ample hop spice and subtle bitterness. I was struck by how integrated the flavors were, one had to really focus to pick them out and the overall impression is one of a floral/herb/spice bouquet with a honey sweet backdrop. If Rogue was going for integration rather than staggering things on the palate they hit a home run here.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 10, 2013"

It was hard to get a definable aroma, malty sweetness is what came through and maybe some mild hops. Taste is where I really fell for this Ale, sweet with a tangy after taste...some bitters on the back of the tongue and a malty finish. The mouthfeel was solid with a medium smooth drinkablity. Overall it's a very fine Maibock, great taste, decent ABV and it looks good in a Pint glass.","Bear1964","Jun 12, 2013"

It's not a bad beer, and certainly is something I'd take over most common bar offerings, but I don't know that I'd pick this up over many of the other options I have in the craft aisle. This beer isn't bad, but I can already tell that the sweetness of this one is going to wear on me by the end of the bottle and I don't know that I'd sign up to enjoy this one again.","jdhowe","Jun 01, 2013"

Very malty, taste like part of the malt protiens did not convert to simple sugars for fermentation. Thats not a bad thing, the flavor is great ... I'm just not sure if that is even it, whatever it is, it works!","FlatRabbitRed","Jan 26, 2013"

Lightly sweet followed by a good but not overly punch of hops. This beer has a nice balance to it. Very smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium carbonation. Very good beer and a good example of balance.","Braz","Jan 23, 2013"

Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, herbal, floral, toffee, earth, pepper, clove, pear, apple, and light citrus. Very nice and well balanced malty aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, herbal, floral, toffee, pine, clove, earth, pepper, pear, and light grapefruit. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pine, herbal, earth, and citrus on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavor; with good malt flavor robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent maibock. Nice toasty flavors with good balance and robustness.","SeamusDoyle","Dec 27, 2012"

Front end is loaded with carmel malts that give way to a nice hop balance. Very well balanced beer that keeps you coming back for more. Picked up a bready, nutty profile as well that is subtle. Feel is nice and full with good carbonation and silky ending. Overall- A very surprising brew. Balanced and full of flavor. nice carmel, sweet front with hop balance.

The head retains very well, dissipating slowly and leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of sweet and bready malts with some earthy and floral hop aromas. The malt profile is strong with the bready and mildly sweet notes. There's some good back end bitterness from the hops, which bring some floral and spicy characteristics. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is sticky and dry. This allows the aftertaste to linger for a little while. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Oct 06, 2012"

Beautiful amber color with small white head on top. This one has a very solid aroma: caramel, biscuits, pine, toffee, citrus. Doesn’t go down particularly easy for only 6.6%, but a nice changeup. Flavor is biscuity malts, some caramel sweetness, and a good bit of hefty bitter and booze for the abv. Overall, I liked this but not over the top on it.","BMMillsy","Sep 25, 2012"

Weird for the type, Eh?, It all piled together nicely thought. The mouthfeel somewhat follows, Though it allows more of the skunk to come through. Overall, A VERY easy to drink beer.

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"totally unlike any other bock ive tried, and certainly a departure from traditional bocks, but this is a very unique ale that has become a bit of a legend in the USA. the smell is odd to me, sweet and malty, but also spiced to a degree, and hopped like only a west coast beer can be. the flavor features heavy hops on the back end, which is not common in a spring bock. the malts do the rest of the work, layering in a ton of complexity to this. i also get some woody notes and a touch of dried fruit. mouthfeel works, its heavier in the body but the carbonation is very high, which makes for a pleasant experience not like many others. overall this is an excellent brew, but i dont want to drink a whole 6pack. just gets too heavy and sweet after a bunch of them, but one or two every so often is really nice.","StonedTrippin","Jun 17, 2012"

It is not a traditional maibock, as it definitely possesses some features that seem decidedly 'pale ale-inspired'.

Had to try it just to see what that price buys you these days. I wasn't disappointed, but not exactly knocked over. A solid, balanced beer, that doesn't carry any one defining characteristic. More maltish in taste than anything. Certainly not hop-heavy. It's the mix that does the rick here and makes this an eminently drinkable brew. Hard to have just one. It could be a good staple beer, if it weren't for the cost.","standorsey","May 20, 2012"

It's smooth and very drinkable, with a pleasant, refreshing taste that makes me wish I had a few more of these to drink. The taste does an excellent job of having the malts, hops, sweetness, and bitterness all fit together beautifully. I can certainly see why this beer is available year-round as it would be easy to enjoy no matter the season.","TechTriumph","May 19, 2012"

This beer has an interesting character. Up front is the spicy, earthy, clove notes. The middle is kind of bread like, and it ends a bit of a bite. It stays on the palate. This beer wants you to drink more of it. And I will.","omokoro","May 18, 2012"

The taste is mainly roasted malt - bready and nutty, and a bit sweet, but with a hint of grassy and floral notes. The flavors all work really well together. Very low bitterness, and very drinkable. Solidly good all-around. This might make a good beer to transition someone into the craft beer world from BMC products.","DeltaGolfSierra","May 17, 2012"

4.1,3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A clear reddish brown in color with a rocky light tan colored head. Smells of freshly baked bread. The taste is a super sweet caramel and grain medley up front, followed by some zesty, light balancing hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall this is a great beer. A conundrum to fit in stylistically, yet that matters not when the result is this good.","tronester","Mar 23, 2012"

I had trouble picking out flavors...I don't really get any of the fruity notes some people put forth (unless its interfering with the hop...or IS the hop). Its good on the whole, but after having Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Shakespeare Stout, I had much higher expectations for the flavor. Still, a solid beer from Rogue, and I wouldn't mind drinking it again.","DM1293","Mar 21, 2012"

The smell has malt and balancing hops...slightly sweet. The hops provide an initial punch of bitterness in the taste, but then the sweet malt helps to calm the pallet. ABV is present in the first few swigs and then settles as the pallet adjusts. The mouthfeel is a light to medium body with good carbonaiton. Overall it is a solid ale.","WoodBrew","Jan 06, 2012"

Although I didn't like it as much as say; Maibock by Capital Brewery, I think this is a perfect session beer. It had a decent, smooth, malty taste so it would be ideal to down 3-4 of them in a row. It had a nice copper color and there was a little bit more of a bitter hoppy taste than most maibocks. So I did like it, the beer just didn't wow me.","mjpolzin","Jan 01, 2012"

Also woodsy, spicy and citrusy. Very complex aromas. Taste is great. All of the scents are realized, with cocoa, spice and roasted malt coming forward. Rinses down with a hops bite and perfect carbonation. Finishes silky smooth. So many complexities in the flavor. This goes beyond any Maibock or Helles bock I've had, which makes me question this designation above. This is simply a rich, rewarding ale with an abundance of positive qualities.

Even though this may be possible I still enjoyed this brew. I've had other brews by Rogue, but this is my first ever Maibock. This was an experience and I recommend that everyone should at least try this brew at least once. I've seen this in 6 packs all the way to a growler. People love this for some reason and I now slightly grasp why.","TheAlamoWrocker","Nov 10, 2011"

3.87,-2,1.5,4.5,4,3,4,"I'm not sure what rogue wanted out of this beer. It is an amazingly complex malt forward beer without the weight and power that so many have. It is also worth pointing out that Rogue only mildly over charges for this one (I guess on Dead Guy they have an excuse to not post the bottled on date?) and it is easily accessible so any craft lover should give it a shot. I think this is a beer that a great many people will really dig in today's 3x imperial hop explosions.","bobhits","Nov 05, 2011"

Looks pretty good. Nose is mostly malty up front but has a nice floral hops balance. I get cajeta, a slight hops bitterness and a touch of honey. The taste is very earthy and floral. Still getting some honey. Bitter hops shine through in the middle and the taste ends with a light coffee,caramel flavor. The mouth feel is soft, medium in body and the carbonation is on the high side. All in all not bad. This is one of the beers that kick off my love for craft beer.

3.68,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I have to admit I'm a bit confused by the style. Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops as much as the next guy (and maybe even more than some), but I didn't think they really fit here.","huhl23","Jul 26, 2011"
3.97,0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: Wasn't sure to expect here, but this is a very satisfying and drinkable brew. Not sure if I would shell out for a six pack, but I enjoyed this for what it was. Worth a try at least once for everyone.","Groomsy","Jul 25, 2011"
4.02,1.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: All of the Rogue ales seem to share a similar malt profile and I must admit that it's one of my favorites. This brew is truly a classic and, as others have mentioned, for a Maibock to be a brewery's flagship ale is pretty impressive. This one in particular packs a good malt/hop balance and comes off quite quaffable. This is definitely a ""mood"" beer, and when I'm in the mood for the style, this one always comes through.

I wouldn’t pay for a bottle of this stuff again, especially considering what I paid for just a small bottle. And, while I’ll keep trying their stouts and darker creations, I don’t think I’ll be working too hard to get any of their lighter stuff.

The mouthfeel is pretty smooth but it also felt a little watered down. Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer. Yes it's drinkable but just falls short to me.","Knapp85","Jul 05, 2011"

Body is thicker than average, coming off more like a rich tripel.

I’m not sure but after reading some of the other reviews maybe us Canadians get the old crappy batches because my review sounds miles off from the others?

Aromas are rich caramel, with a good dark-sweet character to it. Flavor is toasted malt and caramel notes again, with a very slight peppery hops spicing peeking through, and some grapefruit/citrus ccharacteristics, as well. The aftertaste almost has a sour tone to it, and the finish is dry and crisp, with a hint of bitter from those late blooming hops. Easy drinker, and it goes with anything foodwise.

I'm wary of such beers, but the taste did not disappoint. The smell was citrusy. It really didn't have much smell at all. The taste was quite pleasant as well. It had a little more hops than I'd like, but I'd expect that in a maibock. Not nearly as disgusting as Sierra Nevada's take on this style with their Glissade beer. The taste is pleasantly sweet with a strong citrusy hop overtone. For a hoppy beer, it's really very easy to drink. I don't taste any malt undertones, but I can clearly SEE that malts were not skimped on, so maybe I'm congested or maybe the citrusy hops just overpower everything else.","ElCommodoro","Apr 11, 2011"

After tasting and noticing the style and ABV I realized this is no where near a pale ale styled beer. Its a very interesting take on a session beer. There's really not much more to say about it. Its an amazing beer that should not be overlooked. As I said i'm super stoked about trying their Shakespeare. This brewery obviously has a passion for making darker beers, and making darker beers more session worthy if you will. Usually a semi-strong alcohol taste lowers the drinkibility, not in this case, this is a very drinkable, very well balanced beer. Stay thirsty my friends.","NickRivers","Apr 05, 2011"

There is almost a raspberry apple flavor that is strong on the tongue. The body is really quite watery, but for a lighter bock it's not too bad. The drinkability of this beer isn't all that great.

Wow, taste is very smooth, probably the smoothest hoppy beer I have ever had, granted it's not as hoppy as some beers, but still. Pretty simple beer all together though, at first you just get that smooth feel and then come the hops and malts, if there is any fruit or citrus, it is almost undetectable in the taste.

Hint of citrus and grass, maybe some cereal grains in there somewhere. The flavor is a little better, with a healthy blend of honey and caramel followed by delicate touch of grapefruit. Herbal and grassy finish. There's a huge turnoff here... why is my bottle of Dead Guy metallic tasting? Metallic finish kind of kills the 4.0 I was gonna give it... Hearty and almost ""meaty"" texture. Nicely carbonated and quite smooth. Almost thick to the point where it coats the palate but actually gives a very balanced body between sweet and dry.

Aromas aren't too strong, and this is out of an almost-snifter, because of the low head retention and carbonation, but that's OK.

Glad it was...I haven't sampled this one in a really long time. It was one of the beers that got me going on craft beer many years ago...over the years, my pallette has changed and I prefer hoppier beers, but this one still hits the spot for me. The malty flavors and body that is achieved is quite good and the hops play off of this just about perfectly - never taking over and only serving to help show off the finer points of the malt. This is really smooth and I'm figuring this would go really well with something off the grill.

The smell of this beer gave of strong send of toasted malt and zesty citrus aromas. After my first taste of this beer, the citrus and bread qualities of this beer come to form. Its flavor is well developed and quite the oxymoron in that it is complex while keeping its simplicity.

The grain character is a bit sweet with a slight hint of the alcohol accents the hop bitterness. The feel is a bit watery and light with a modest amount of carbonation. There is a lingering presence of the hops left in the mouth. As it warms, the aroma takes on some notes of lemony citrus that can also be picked out in the flavor as well.

It smells like it'd be sweet. Caramel is the dominant taste, with a mouthcoating, kind of velvety body that makes it quite easy-drinking. Full-flavored. The caramel is just short of being too strong (to the point of cloying) here. I can see this one as being very enjoyable to sip in cooler weather. It gives a fuzzy, cozy feel.","DioS","Jun 16, 2010"

I can't get a straight answer from anybody if this is lagered like a traditional helles bock, or just an ale approximation. The taste is ambiguous there too, but I've tried to see if my palate would guide me. I'll leave it at they should keep doing what they're doing. If it's not a German Maibock, lets say it's an American Maibock. I'd like to see some brewers do as well in an approximation of styles like this.

4.45,12.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5," I gave it a fairly aggressive pour into a pilsner glass, and it didn't come up with too much head, maybe a finger or so. The first thing I noticed was it had very little visible carbonation, just a few tiny bubbles, and a gorgeous golden amber color. The smell is of malt, a slight touch of hops in the back, sweet bread and I catch almost a little carmel and brown sugar in there too. Some medium lacing on the way down. The mouth feel is real silky to me, not a whole lot of carbonation going on, so it lays easy on the tongue and with the smooth flavors, with just a slight hop bitterness at the end. It's real easy to drink, I could definitely see having a few of these in a sitting with friends, and feeling good at a 6.5 ABV with this drinkability. Good stuff.","Nhoddus","May 25, 2010"

It's a nice amber color with a thick, but short lived head. Like the flavor its smell is balanced with caramel malts and terrific citrus esters. The hops are stronger on the palate than sensed by the nose, but much more subdued than an American IPA, for instance. I find this the most drinkable beer I've had so far.

I think this beer is hyped up a lot because it was one of the first accessible craft beers. A damn good beer... Worth the price, no.","MaxBrews","Feb 28, 2010"

Something about the smell to me is off-putting, and I can't quite place it. In any case, I'm getting some lightly roasted malt, and a hint of citrus hops. Taste follows suit, but the malt definitely dominates, with roasted flavors and amber malts coming through. Some nutty flavors too--hazelnut for one. A hint of hops pushes through, though they are minor. Feel is nothing special, pretty typical for an ale, though I guess slightly above average for creaminess. Drinkability would be higher if I could figure out what I don't like about the smell of this beer, there's just something I don't like. I've had it in bottles and have noticed the same thing.

As usual the sweet malt strikes first, followed by some citrus and bread that converge into a floral hop taste with a minor bitter finish. This is a nice and crisp beer with a light to medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Very well balanced beer, with a good malt backbone and a strong hoppy prescence. This is very visually appealing beer with a constant head and lace throughout that keeps it attractive till the end.

Excellent with lighter foods or deep-fried foods. Quenching. I am not certain that if I was a monk and this was a meal-replacement ale, I would be totally satiated.

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured out of the 64 ounce growler. Color is a cloudy amber with a one finger head with some lacing. Nose is sweet with a berry tone. Flavor is somewhat sweet with a bitter edge on the tail. Mouth is smooth and a little bit heavy, with a slight bit of bubble that clings to your mouth. Extremely drinkable due to it's smooth tone and flavor. Excellent brew","Anthony1","Nov 03, 2009"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an orangish copperish color with a moderate frothy white head. The head gives way to a slight lacing. The aroma is of citrus hops with hints of fruit and a sweet malt characteristic. The taste is of a mild citrus hop bite, with a slight fruit note to balance out the harshness of the hop, there is also a slight sweet malt characteristic. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, there is a good hop characteristic without being overly hoppy. Overall the flavor is good and there is nothing to make you dislike this beer.","goblue3509","Nov 02, 2009"

A hazy reddish gold pour to copper-brown with thinnish white head, but lace that sticks about. The aroma advertises the floral-piney hops more than the nice roast malts that balance it. The flavor as said, is a great balance of malt & hop, with honey & pine qualities. The feel is a crisp, biting carbonation with dry finish that provides for a clean & drinkable sensation. A great old standby.","selecter70","Oct 23, 2009"

I was expecting a lot more diversity out of this and frankly, if the hop presence wasn't so varied this beer would be abysmal. I'm guessing this beer is rated so high is because it probably made a lot of people realize that they are hop heads.

3.88,-1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A pale hazy orange with a rocky white head and an adequate amount of lace. I found the aroma to be the weak link in this one, a bit underwhelming but not at least slightly better than average hoppy citrus aroma. The flavor leads with a balanced citrus hop attack that finds a nice medium between sweet orange and a drier grapefruit. This is followed by a sugar cookie maltiness in the middle that evolves into a slight sweetness before finishing with a dry hop note. I felt like the alcohol peeked its head out just slightly but I had to try hard to pick it up. Light and refreshing on the palate and representing a wide range of flavors. This one goes down easy and shows a nice complexity and though it's a little high on the ABV it might make a good session beer. Certainly one of the best I've had of it's kind.","apbarwood","Oct 19, 2009"

Had a nice biscuity scent with a decent amount of hop spice, not very strong but pleasant. Toasted malt and barley, with some floral notes emerging as a resuly of the hops, becoming richer as it warmed up. Medium body with moderate carbonation, adding to the overall flavor at all stages, and went down extremely smooth for a beer of this complexity.

There's a peppery hop spiciness that nicely compliments the malty flavours and floral aromas. Lots of bite! The mouthfeel is crisp and velvety upfront; perfectly bitter and dry in the finish.

I get a sense of perfume and citrus from the hops, not necessarily on the tastebuds, but swirling around the sides and roof of my mouth. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet finish.

4.1,3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I think this is a fantastic beer. It has a nice flavor and aroma profile that is complex enough yet not too over the top given the light, playful nature of the body. It definitely has more character than your traditional English styles, but is reminiscent of that same vain of easy drinking subtlety flavored beers. I think it would pair fantastically with typical pub grub like fish and chips or mutton stew. Or, it would pair fantastically with a six pack of it's buddies on a hot summer dark or while raking leaves in the fall.","Jekster","Feb 24, 2009"

The aroma is definitely on the malty side with hints of caramel and very little hops. The taste is very similar to the aroma with some toasted malts and caramel with a mild hop bitterness in the finish.

There was a citrus taste that lasted throughout the taste, but it seemed to linger in the background. It had decent thickness and carbonation, but nothing to rave about.

But for a bock beer, even a light bock beer, the yeast profile is far to prominent for the style, the mouthfeel is distractingly light, and the hops are surprisingly intrusive.

This beer pours a dark, reddish copper with a nice 2 inch head that dissolved into just a thin layer that sat on the top of the beer. The aroma has a nice caramel/toffee aroma with a bit of vanilla, and some fruity esters. The flavor follows suit with some mild malts really building the flavor profile. Caramel, what reminds me of blueberries sometimes and cherries other times (no I'm not crazy) and other dark fruits. There is also a fake sweetness to it. It kind of reminds me of Sweet N Low. The mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth. Not as clean as you find with other Maibocks. This is a good beer and one I'm sure I will revisit again down the line.","hwwty4","Jan 16, 2009"

A very nice hop balance kicks in with just the right amount of ""bite"" to clean the sweetness. Towards the end some alchol warmth kicks in but is not obvious.

The aroma is nice easily detected but not too strong which primarily consists of delectable sweet malts. Very pleasant and appealing the scent lured me into a balanced flavor of sweet malts. I was expecting something over the top but this beer was simple and delivered, perhaps perfecting a recipe that relies on a sturdy malt characteristic only is what makes this ale so good. Creamy mouthfeel that goes down full and finishes slightly dry. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer simply for what it does right.","kinger","Aug 01, 2008"

The aroma is of malts and dried fruits. Earthy hops and caramel come through as well. The taste is similar to the aroma. Strong malty caramel upfront that dominates and an earthness of hops and dried fruit. It's not too bitter nor it's not too sweet. The mouthfeel is slick,thick, and creamy.

Neither dominate the flavor but compliment each other in a nice complexity. The caramel nuances don't take away from the hop bite nor from the malt roast but add the the overall flavor.

I don't mind paying more for a bomber of the superb Shakespeare Stout, Brutal Bitter or many others, but it's harder to pay the Rogue premium for a beer that doesn't stand out much among a crowd of worthy ""ambers"" that run nearly 50% less.

Perfectly carbonated in my opinion. The drinkability for me isn't the best though. 6.5%. I can hang with 3 at the most.

The smell is of bready/doughy Munchen malt, with a floral honey aroma. The taste upfront is of the doughy Munich malt, honey, a touch of ash and bitter hop. Perhaps a very slight hint on lemon and pepper. The feel is moderate with semi-soft carbonation, finishes well balanced; slightly on the bitter side. A very nice and enjoyable ale. The sweetness of the Munich malt is offset with some bitter hops. The feel remains light thus making this a very drinkable beer.","Gmann","Mar 07, 2008"

A malty smell follows, although there are dark fruit smells that I picked up. A very smooth beer with a light to medium body which underlies a very malty taste. Can't tell if there are some coffee or roasted/toasted malts in there, but there is a malty sharpness. Overall it is smooth because there is some faint sweetness brought on, but this is balanced with a dryer backbite from the hops. At 6% it is just there for sessioning - buy a six-pack and chill out with this beer.","clayrock81","Mar 04, 2008"

I haven't had anything quite like it before. Pretty well balanced. Malts, fruits, some vegetables, and yeast. Medium bodied and very carbonated. I've never had anything quite like this before.

The appearance is wonderful... pours an amber and slightly copper color with a nice head that foams for a while before dissapating... The smell is awesome....full of bready caramel notes... The taste is what truly makes this beer above and beyond... it is so rich and thick that it makes some other brews I've tried taste like water... the flavor is full of caramel, vanilla, and has a nice, sweet aftertaste that lingers on the palate... ""rich"" is how I'd best describe the tate... Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is near-perfect, goes down smooth and clean without the slightest bitterness present... Copped this beer singly for about $1.99 and will definitely pay the $10 plus for a six-pack... Eager to try other samples from this brewery... Definitely recommended...","dsa7783","Dec 22, 2007"

It presents itself nicely, with two fingers of head atop an amber-copper body in a pint glass. The nose was malty, and I detected a hint of chocolate, but little else appeared. The taste was subtle but smooth. But I was disappointed since the malt was clear, and some spice was present--ginger, paprika--but little else. I was hoping for bolder flavors, but was left wanting. The texture was smooth, and ordering a second sure wasn't difficult. Overall, worth a try and a nice brew, but nothing that will knock the socks off.","Gehrig","Dec 07, 2007"

4.11,4.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"The taste is delicious. Again, bottles don't really compare to a good Dead Guy on-tap (IMO). It practically bursts with notes of fruit and caramel malts, and a bit of creamy vanilla/butterscotch too. The finale is predominantly hop territory, as the flavor ends with a bitter, resinous bite. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied, semi-creamy but crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is nearly perfect. It's complex, flavorful, and almost too easy to put away a few in one sitting.

You may want to pour gently and slowly so you don't get any carryover. Lacing is minimal. A nice malt aroma that translates into a noticable but not cloying sweet malt presence in the flavor that is balanced by spicy hop bitterness that dries out the aftertaste.

Earthy with some white grapes, and just the right amount of spice and hop bittering. Ying and yang in liquid form!

On the palate, rough fruits and scratchy hops first off, followed by some tea-like malts at the mid-palate. The finish dries out and brings a hoppy bite and some alcoholic burn. Overall, this is quite a nice beer, but it's no Maibock. Very ale-like character, especially in the mouthfeel, which has too many rough edges for a lager.

Taste gets complex, but orange comes through more than anything else. Hop bitterness is solid, but not huge or overpowering. And the aftertaste is neither too astringent/hoppy or too sweet. Great mix, with most of the hops trailing off leaving a slightly dry orange kicking around. Mouthfeel was at medium body, with a creaminess tempered by carbonation that hits both in front and throughout the taste. While the carbonation might make more than one or two these filling, it's very drinkable. I know it's a bit out of the recommended pairing, but I'd like to try this with non-coconut milk-based curries.","wcdoyle","Jul 16, 2007"

It has a very balanced taste: Clean wheat with a delightfully mild bitterness which seems to complement the flavor nicely. The mouthfeel is very smooth all the way through.

Some pear/apple/strawberry sensation, as well as a sugary, vanilla taste. Tasty, to be sure, although I'd only want to drink this beer fresh. In my opinion, maibocks do not age well.

Immediate sweetness on the tongue, but not cloying. No real hop bite, but still a bit drying in the finish--very interesting. The taste is very aggressive, but not extreme.

I had to drink a good pint to discern enough sweet, caramel maltiness in the middle to appreciate it a bit more. It is a bit more hoppy than I appreciate and definitely has a nice bite at the end, if you go for that sort of thing. It is above 6 ABV but the alcohol flavor is well masked by those darn hops again.

The taste was heavy on the malt as any maibock should be, but this being brewed as an ale, the earthy hops shine through a lot more than they do in any other beer of this style.

Aroma of bubblegum, banana, and apple with floral undertones; hints of spices here and there. Light-medium body. Initial flavor is a mixture of rich and spicy (though mild) noble hops and sweet flowery, cake and cookie-dough malts, punctuated by a subtle undertone of sour lemon-lime citrus.

Smells sweet, nutty, and bready with a whiff of floral and tea-like hops. There's a hint of jasmine in there as well. The rich maltiness is present in the flavor, but is then pushed out by a sturdy hoppiness: floral notes and a good bit of bitterness. I get a slight buttery taste in the aftertaste as well.

But it wasn't anything that made me say ""that's delicious"" (like a lot of other Rogue beers have done for me). With a mouthful that's neither thin nor thick, I don't think many people would have a hard time drinking many of these, unless you breathe in too deeply the alcohol scent as you sip.

The aroma was nice, features gold robust malt, manifesting as a ripe graininess along with softer caramel notes as a compliment. Not much hops detectable to me, and I also don't get a lot of fruitiness which is a little odd because I seem to recall getting more fruitiness from past samples. Nevertheless I don't smell them now so let's continue. The flavor is strongly malty at the start, and has some nice bitterness for balance, but there is also some higher alcohol notes that do not seem to blend or compliment the other characteristics well - its seems rougher rather than smoother. This is somewhat detracting, and I don't knmow if its more of a flavor or a mouthfeel ""issue"" so I'll hit it a little in both. Overall this is a decent beer, but for a maibock I think I'd like a more malty / smoother delivery. If indeed, however, its not a maibock, I'd still have to ding it a little for (lack of) smoothness.","KroMagnon","Oct 27, 2006"

This one tasted like some European beers I've had recently with American hops added for bite. Delicious sweet malt and hops fight in a tug a war in your mouth with no apparent winner. A medium mouthfeel left my mouth sticky after swallow, more typical of your heavy mouthfeel beers.

3.8,-3.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"One of my favourite styles and I'm excited to try this Maibock from Rogue. Came in a 6-pack of 330ml bottles with the lovely skeleton on the barrel label. A solid-looking beer in the glass, iced-tea colour with a generous cap of tight dull-white head. Good full sheets of lacing. The beer can appear light orange as well as dull rusty-red. A swell looking Maibock. Onto the more important...aroma: the first scent I get is spicy nuttiness, like egg-nog with nutmeg. Excellent malts with full notes of toffee and vanilla wafer, and some sourish bready notes. Very creamy smelling, with a spritziness that could be the alcohol or the hops. The hops are complementing the malting well, adding some dry, earthy, musky smells. I get a lot of sweetish vanilla and even maple. Lots of tree bark and caramel with the bitterness of tea. Bready, roasted and warming. Not hugely complex, but done very well for the style, with emphasis on the rich malts. A respectable aroma. The taste is sweet caramel malt with the flowery aftertaste of German hops. Butterscotch and raisins with some white sugar undertones. A little hard-water in the middle of the mouth, making the body feel a little thin at times. Honey and strong toffee flavours in the beer, with lots of buttered toast and whole-grain bread tastes. Besides the tiniest watery sensation the taste is stellar for a bock. Smooth on the tongue with medium carbonation and little alcoholic burn. Medium bodied, going down easily, with all the ""have-another"" character you could want in a bock. Solid. Thanks Rogue.","Cwrw","May 20, 2006"

(this particular bottle was clear, but it has been cloudy every now and then) I like the very unique smell of this beer. I've never really smelt a beer like it. it has a full aroma that smells malty to me. The taste follows the smell in fullness. It also has a nice lever of bitterness with a hint of citrus. There is a nice (medium) amount of carbonation and a very thick taste. The beer does however leave a lingering bitter taste in your mouth (which I don't mind) Overall this beer was very easy to drink even with its slightly high alcohol content.

Up front there was some juicy fruits, then some sweet malts, and at the very end, some bitter hops. It wasn't too hoppy, it wasn't low in the hops, it was just right.

Taste is initially of grainy earthy hops, and some good malty toasted something seems like. The alcohol becomes apparent throught the middle and and has a very nice warming touch. This is one of those I'd call very well balanced in character, with carbonation and smoothness and alcohol warmness and hops and malts all balancing each other out one way or another, which makes this an extremely drinkable beer.","objectivemonkey","Jan 16, 2006"

Toasted malt shows up next, followed by a bit of plum and light spicy, herbal hops. Caramel and pleasant alcohol appear at the end and carry through the finish, at which point the bitterness finally starts to fade. Soft carbonation is well integrated with the texture, which starts to dry out in the middle, but this fades in the finish. Fully bodied without being sticky.

The aroma of this beer was excellent with a sweet caramel and light, summer fruit smell to it. Fresh apple and pear scents along with a refreshing clean malt scent. The flavor starts with a tangy burst of malt up front followed by a nice floral hoppy flavor accompanied by a bit of bitterness. It ends with those same fruity flavors as in the nose along with some sweet but very light cherry flavors. This beer had no sour characteristics to it despite the many fruit flavors. A crisp and clean malt profile makes this an excellent beer to enjoy over and over again...and I did!","BrewMaster","Jan 08, 2005"

Sweet matly beginning which works its way into a low key bitterness. Could drink a 6 pack of these in a night. I like Rogue for brewing this unique style of beer and distributing it so widely.

The mouth is light and very prickly. Good smooth taste, with lots of sweet malt dominating until the hops come out in the finish. Flowery in nature, the hops are never over the top, just leaving a slight bitterness in the aftertaste, not quite espresso, but a bit more than capucchino. The sweet malt never goes away completely, making this a very easy drinking brew. Too malty to be an IPA, not sweet enough to be an amber, not sure what I'd call this. I guess Maibock is as good as any name.","Globetrotter","Dec 05, 2004"

Garrulous malt freneticism to taste, with aged pablum, plums, toasted sesame seeds, and light brown sugar sweetness, though hidden.

Pours from the 22oz bottle a slightly hazy, orangish-amber hue with a small head that subsides quickly. Pleasant aroma of floral, bitter hops, plum, and a touch of roasted malt. Sturdy, slightly foamy body holds a well-balanced palate of lightly roasted malt, lightly bitter hops, and an underlying taste of fruit (plums, grapes). A tad bitter on the finish. While not my favorite beer, it's a good, consistent presence in my fridge.

The mouthfeel is very nice, fullbodied and smooth. This beer is quite good, tasty and with a high drinkability factor. Although its 6.5% ABV it does not taste like so and would therefor be an excellent session beer. Picked up a 6 pack in Illinois that works out to be about $10 CDN, so overall an excellent deal for such quality beer. Very recommended.","Viggo","Oct 08, 2004"

That sweetness definately comes out in the taste, quite malty and ""spring"" tasting. I can picture a bunch of skeletons brewing this stuff up in Oregon.

Malt sweetness hits the palate like a ton of bricks, mixed with some plum-skin like fruitiness, and the hops work well to counterbalance the sweet malt. The hops are pungent, but the malt is moreso. This has always been a very nice beer. An interesting hybrid between the maltiness of a bock and the hoppiness of many West Coast beers (this being one of them). Works out well.","crookedhalo","Sep 19, 2004"

Flavor is initially malty sweet, then the nice, slightly bitter hops kick in and really balance this brew out. Finish is a tasty, sweet blend of hops and malts.

Initial flavors consist of a bit of citrus flavoring followed by a wide arrange of malts which leave a multitude of flavors ranging from toffee, to biscuit, some caramel sweetness, and a doughy bread like flavor. There is also a nice estery yeast flavor in the mix which really adds some complex flavors to the brew. The finish is quite citrusy and zesty from a nice strong hop finish.

Very little lacing on the glass. Smell is of sweet malts with a little bit of citrusy hop aroma. Taste includes sweet, bready malt, a little fruityness, and nice citrus rind-piney hop flavors. Very well balanced. Lingering hop bitterness, but it's not at all harsh, Very smooth and drinkable. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with medium body. Carbonation is apparent, but not over-done. Upon finishing the first one, I immediately wanted another! Not exactly to style... but who cares! Highly recommended and sure to become one of my regulars.","jimdkc","May 29, 2004"

3.13,-20.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Hops give way to sweet malt and alcohol in the mouth, buried in a smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel. The sweetness takes over quickly, pretty much obliterating any hop bitterness. Malt lingers in the aftertaste, with hints of chocolate, smoke, and hay. For reasons unknown to me if I try to drink more than three of these in a night I wake up with a headache, which reduces the drinkability score somewhat. Certainly not without its charm, but not a whole not here to distinguish it from other microbrews.","Hunter","May 25, 2004"
4.01,1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"An intriguing beer that is not quite an ale, and not quite a lager, or both. There is a smoky element, perhaps from the yeast, that this beer has in common with Anchor Steam (a similarly in-between beer). Also like Anchor Steam, I've found this beer can be wonderful if fresh and well-kept, and blah if not. This is a good, fresh sample. I like the Day of the Dead theme but the Grateful Dead association is a little much. A disconcerting, and intriguing murky copper, with good head that doesn't stick around, minimal lacing. The aroma isn't much, it's pretty invisible. The beer itself is a nice blend of caramel malts, honey, bread, light smoke, gently tangy citric hops. It's almost like a Munich-style helles cross-pollenated with a hoppy Pacific Northwest pale ale. Fine stuff.","Thrasher","May 23, 2004"

But many people have been saying that I absolutely had to try the Dead Guy and boy were they right! Wow! The taste is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. It's a little bitter at first. And I mean a LITTLE bitter. It goes down smooth, and then a few seconds after you swallow, it leaves a faint taste of caramel. Almost no carbonation to speak of make this one real easy to drink, but if you pay attention to it and are looking for it, when you first take a sip, it's a tiny, tiny bit thick which makes it something you wouldn't want to kill a whole lot of in a sitting.

The taste resembled a subdued barleywine, with a firm rich roasty malt body, light and zippy citrus notes, and a big bitter finish with lingering roastyness.

The color is an orangey-amber and the head was thin. The aroma is full with sweet fruity malts and has a touch of spiciness. The taste is of light malts and leans towards the sweet fruit side rather than the bitter. There are some citrus and lemony hops in there, but are well disguised by the sweet malt.

The flavor was great, with a thick mouthfeel that fit the malty flavor perfectly. But just when you think its all malt the hops came in and added a great element to the flavor.

I like the earthy aftertaste. It's not overbearing like some ESB's, but still keeps you aware of the bitterness. I can't quite put my finger on it, but this is one you keep drinking in order to try and figure it out, but with the smooth mouthfeel giving way to the bitter, it's almost as if the beer is teasing you to pinpoint it's definitive taste.

Some roasted caramel was noticed later. More sweet fruits came and went. Not too much in the line of hops but I think that's because of the style. The smoothness of this beer made it go down easily. All in all a solid beer but lower on the Rogue totem pole of beers.","granger10","Dec 21, 2003"
3.93,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Gorgeous, clear, dark red/amber color. Small, off-white, dense, thick foamy head leaves a few spots of lacing. Sweet deep malt, creamy aroma. Hops jump in right away with a touch of fruit. Deep, almost chocolatey malt takes over quickly: creamy, thick. Very bitter finish... creamy malt survives through the end. This is a special beer. The huge hop bitterness is a little unexpected among the dark, creamy malt. It's an unusual bimodal taste, but a real winner.","kbub6f","Dec 15, 2003"

There didn't seem to be anyhting particularly compelling about this beer, nothing up front on the pallate, nothing lingering on the back end to make me look forward to the next bottle (not that I didn't have another though). The bottle was very cold to start and the flavors opened up as the beer warmed up. I felt it was a good brew though and representative of its style, just not a knockout.","counselor","Nov 28, 2003"

Starts malty and with notes of vanilla on the palate and in the aroma. Malty with a spike of hoppiness towrards the finish and fairly bitter finish for a bock, but this is sort of expected from a Northwestern brewery. Doesn't seem as balanced as it did the other day. Seems more bitter and the flavors seem just a little brighter.

Pours a white fluffy head that dissipates to form a sticky lace with a dark amber color. Slight citrus hop smell with goes along with a caramely malt.

Highly drinkable but alcohol will kick in after two or so.","leeenglewood","Nov 01, 2003"

The head is pretty thin with no lace around the large goblet that I'm drinking it from. The aroma is pretty malty, maybe caramel, with litter to no hop presence. The taste has a large malt presence up front with a little brown sugar hint. Great finishing hops presence makes this one finish clean and balances it out at the end. Good mouthfeel with medium carbonation. This is very drinkable and at 6.5% will make a damn good session beer.

""green"" tasting about the combination of hoppiness and sweet malt in the middle. Finishes with a sweetish, smoky flavor that continues with the oddness. What is most odd about this ""ale"" is that it is not an ale at all. It is a Maibock, which is a German lager beer. It is as much an ale as Bill Cosby is a young white dude.","EagleTalon","Oct 25, 2003"

The main aroma is one of a malty biscuit, it is accompanied by a sweet hoppiness. This beer is very malty tasting, and lightly sweet. I must say this is a great session beer, lots of flavor yet it seems to be relatively light. A beer for when you aren't up to being assaulted by hop varieties and dense maltiness. This beer finishes with a balancing bitterness that counterpoints the wonderful mixture of sweet maltiness and hop flavors that are at the front part of this beer.

The start was somewhat malty sweet, but then the hops kick in with a dry, citrusy, grapefruit finish. As with the finish, the aftertaste was on the bitter side. The mouthfeel was a little creamy with a light to medium body and slight carbonation. Well balanced, but over all, the flavors are a bit subdued.

This proves they can do subtle as well as they do bold. Pours a clear dark copper with a a frothy off-white head. Aromas are all light and subdued--sweet, hoppy, grassy, inviting if nothing else. Everything else is all she wrote. There is a perfect balance of the malt and hop profile and neither is over done, although each dominate at different times. Tastes sweet--raisins-- followed by the smoothest hops and a slightly dry finish. I could (and have) drink this all night and I usually opt for variety.

The taste was sweet malt (caramel) and spicy hops near the finish. Nicely balanced flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but dry and hoppy (almost chalky) at the finish and in the aftertaste.

It poured a nice, slightly murky reddish orange with minimal head yet ample sticky lace coating the glass throughout. Attractive fruitiness and sweet malt on the nose with a little cooking caramel as well. The taste of this baby is really quite nice. Lots of caramel malt flavors and a slick buttery texture, that finds balance in nice grainy malty/hoppy interaction. This beer is superbly balanced and very flavorfull! I'm picking up more of that caramel corn thing as I finish this beer. This is some tasty stuff, and as I drink more of it, it becomes even more ""drinkable!

The taste is interesting, nothing like I have had before. Had a good mouth feel.

4.25,7.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Flavor is bold and powerful, yet smooth and rich. The beer starts out malty sweet, fading into a slight toasty graininess, then travels into a moderate northwest hopping, finishing the beer. Malts remain throughout the sip, finishing with the hops wonderfully. Hints of apple, pear, and plum. Heavy body, with mild smooth carbonation. A touch of cookie-like yeastiness.

The smell was quite interesting, a floral hoppy aroma with sweetness underlying it all. Nice honey traces. The taste was a bit strange, but I got used to it pretty quickly. The initial sweetness is tempered by a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Different than most beers, even most maibocks that I can remember. The full mouthfeel was very appropriate, and matched the complexity of the beer very well. Good taste, and good drinking overall. The alcohol can sneak up on you a little, but this makes for a great standby, and a good session maibock.","SchmichaelJ","Aug 04, 2003"

Not every beer has to have a snow-white froth floating on top. Feels very good in the mouth, and goes down surprisingly easily.

3.88,-1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at the Sunset Cantina. Color was a clear, light copper hue, and the head was white, fine and thin, but with minimal lacing. Nose displayed some citrusy hop notes, and even seemed a bit grassy to me. Body was better than medium, with a slight prickliness on the tongue. Flavor was a great balance between malt and hops. Malt was slightly toasty, with some sweetness (but not enough for me!) and the hops were pleasing with a citrus lean to them. Good stuff!!","Alewife","Jun 01, 2003"

The aroma smelled like a kettle of carmel when you melt it to make carmel apples, and a sweet malt and alcohol smell came through nicely. The taste was rich and smooth, pronounced carmel flavor, with a bitter-sweet middle, and a pleasant sweet and tart finish that lingered a bit. An excellent Maibock style beer.","jaz","May 22, 2003"

3.95,0,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Dark amber, a little hazy, with an orangey head that is thick and lingering. Aroma of sweet malts and ripe fruit, some toffee and candy. Flavor is coarse brown sugar, ripe pear and hint of butterscotch. Also a bit of a rough-edged flavor, a little grainy. Mouthfeel is round and full, with even carbonation. You can just feel tinges of the alcohol.","far333","May 12, 2003"

Soft, spicy hop nose with an herbal tinge along with lightly toasted malt and mellow light caramel. Pleasant, understated aroma. Assertive hop bite initially in flavor is partially contrasted by mildly buttery malt and mellow toffee. Malt character is predominantly of cleanly grainy, toasty Munich and stately, dextrinous light lovibond caramel malt. Not complex, but sufficient in malt backbone for adequate balance. Subdued herbal, mint tinged hop flavor. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth mouthfeel well calculated in dextrins. Finishes with lingering hop bitterness and fleeting toasty malt, and thus quite dry. Another well hopped, unique Rogue creation. Simple, tasty and certainly quaffable.","marc77","May 09, 2003"

Deep amber color, nice off-white head with sufficient staying power to coat the sides of the glass. The taste is exceptional, neatly balanced malts off set the assertive hops. Clearly, this is a terrific beer for any hop head, but one that I think any beer drinker would enjoy, as this beer showcases the floral/citrus aspects of the hops with out leaving too much of a bitter bite.

Just a plethora of different sweetnesses confused and excite the tongue and palate. Aftertaste almost has an element of carmel too it. Any taste of alcohol is non-existant in this brew.

The taste is very good and satisfies the hop-head in me - little malt presence on the palate, followed by bitter hops and a crisp finish. It feels to me that the tail end is almost missing something.

The flavor is very complex yet simply amazing in every way, this beer blends the perfect amount of subtle bittering hops with a huge blend of specialty malts. Gotta love the maibock brewed with ale yeast instead of the standard lager yeast for the style. This shows that taking a chance can bring you an awesome product like the one I have the pleasure of sipping on right now. There are hints is a soft chewy mouthfeel that carries a plethora of caramel malt, a ver slight tartness, and the trace of hop character tie this beer together.

How pleasantly surprised I was when it arrived at the table and was confused as to what type of beer it was as it did not adhere to either style. When I got home, I punched it in at the beeradvocate website and found it was from Rogue, which I haven't been able to get in any of my local stores here in New England. As far as the beer goes, it did not have the metallic taste I associate with other Rogue products I've had. The malt was a honey-ish variety with the hops being ever present but not overtly spicy. The body was nicely constructed, with the head playing a strong part in the experience all the way to the bottom of the glass. If it wasn't for the fact that I was driving, I could easily have sat there and sampled more. A good beer and one I will try and find to have in the house.","beernbbq","Feb 19, 2003"

The smell is very unique....floral, heavy waves of candied fruit, chocolate, and dark caramel. The taste is of burnt caramel, chocolate malted milk balls, plum preserves and raisins. Though lighter-bodied and less potent, it reminded me a bit of the sample of Samichlaus I tried not too long ago. Unfortunately some odd metallic taste comes on in the finish contributing to an unpleasant bitterness. I think my bottle might be an old one, and I know it was not stored at cellar temperatures prior to my purchase. Even so, I could tell this was a good beer past its prime. I will have to try to locate a fresher sample.","johnrobe","Feb 16, 2003"

The aroma was of much like a zinfadel or at least that is what the wife stated. I noted fruit, sweet malt, and some hops. The taste was incredible. Before I start I would like to say that I liked-loved this beer. Now, flavors of sweet malt, fresh fruit, caramel, hops, and a bit of alcohol at the end. They all just danced around my tongue like it was on vacation, and after the last sip I heard a slight sigh from inside my mouth (I swear) because it knew that the last sip was indeed the last sip and I had to leave. So I bought 2 bottles to take home, one to drink, and one larger one to save, because I loved the painted label on the bottle, simple but classy, plus I like stuff like that.

To me, this tastes like everything Bass Ale aspires to be. The tastes are comparable, but Dead Guy gets it right. There is nothing too complex about this beer, and that's a good thing. It is a testament to the fact that your tastebuds don't always need to be assaulted with a billion different flavors to be an interesting beer. The beauty of Dead Guy is it's simplicity. It's also great with just about any food you can think of.","HossMcGraw","Dec 03, 2002"

4.3,8.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A surprise this was, set up at purchase in a halloween display. A nice looking copper/amber brew with a medium white sticky head that laced well. A good balance of more malt than hop with a slight fruity sweet taste. The aroma backs up the taste well. I will seek this again as a great autumn ale for its name, available year-round.","chilidog","Nov 26, 2002"
4.42,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark orange color with is sticky head. Great balance of malt and hops. Both present themselves in every aspect of the beer...from the first sniff through the finish. Aroma shows a more floral hoppiness as it warms. Likewise, sweet molases flavors appear as you work on the beer. It has a rough, hard-edged quality, with the flavors banging against one another. Very good....I hope it becomes a regular item in my local beer store.","Suds","Nov 23, 2002"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a reddish amber color with a light head and a sweet malty aroma with hints of citrus and a definite hop presence. The taste is dominated by a strong, yet pleasant, hop bitterness, especially the aftertaste. It goes down easily and is quite refreshing. A decent buy at $3.49 for a 22oz bottle.","Morris729","Nov 14, 2002"
4.1,3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I finally got around to trying this one and was pleasantly surprised that it lived up to the hype. It's golden-amber with a sticky white head. It's got the unmistakeable bock smell of sweet malt but with more hops than the typical bock. It has toffee and caramel flavors up front with traces of ripe fruit and enough hop bite to liven things up a bit. It's highly drinkable and just made for that old saying: Through the teeth and over the gums, look out stomach here it comes. A winner.","mickeymac","Nov 03, 2002"
4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Hoisted this to celebrate Halloween - the night the dead guys roam.  Another winner from Rogue - malty, almost syrupy and full of ripe fruit flavors.  No idea how old this bottle was - there was a good bit of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, but it did not decant and, whatever the beer's age, it had aged quite gracefully.  The only negative was that I did not have a bottle with the glow in the dark label I've heard about ... well, there's always next year.","Brent","Oct 31, 2002"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange brown with a thick and creamy off-white head with excellent retention.  Thick, sticky lace thoroughly coat the glass walls.  The carbonation is quite lively, though its difficult to perceive due to the beer's cloudy quality.  Rich caramel malt aroma with a fruity quality that is somewhat like dried apricot.  Taste begins with toasted malts and a slight sting of carbonation, towards the middle of the taste the hops assert themselves fairly forcefully.  Towards the finish, caramel flavors play off against the hop bitterness.  The flavor range of the beer improved dramatically as it warmed.","Pegasus","Oct 31, 2002"
4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A long time favorite of mine. Pours an orange-ish amber color from the tap with a frothy tan head. Head retains well and leaves decent lace all the way down the glass. Smell is fruity and sweet for the most part. Taste is of sweet maltiness at first, with some of the trademark Rogue hoppy bitterness presenting itself, as well. Feels rather smooth in the mouth. An easy drinker, for sure, making this ale a candidate for session beer status. A solid offering overall.","Jon","Oct 23, 2002"

Moderate aroma that is not overpowering, very enticing.  Floral hops are noticable, as well a slight malt sweetness.  The taste is clean and much lighter than I was expecting.

This is a brilliant use of hops, malt, and yeast to create a tropical fruit, caramel, toasty malt, spicy hops combination of flavors.  The creamy mouthfeel was welcomed.  The drinkability of this beer is outstanding.  This is a must try and something that could easily become a standard beer in your refrigerator.  Obviously, I'd recommend it.","bditty187","Oct 08, 2002"

Some fruity tones not present in most maibocks are here.  And there isn't as clean of a malt profile as most maibocks.  That said, this is a tasty brew.  Tastes more like an american style amber ale, but there is a bit of a munich malt twist to it. Solid maltiness and solid hop characteristics (of course).   Has a spicy little noble hop kick.  Almost full in body and almost a syrupy mouthfeel, but not quite.  An enjoyable brew, even if it's not necessarily a ""true maibock.""","Bighuge","Sep 27, 2002"

With a taste, I literally become wide-eyed... what is this I'm tasting?  Could it be?  Pistachio!  Right in the middle of the palate, a very clear pistachio-like character.  Something I've never experienced in a beer before.  Before I start ranting about loving pistachios, I'd better move on to the other characteristics.  Sweetness from the malt, balanced well by the hops, as in the nose.  Bread-like toasted malt character abound, especially with retro-olfaction.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that is both crisp from the hops and grainy from the malt.  I'm really enjoying the unique character of this beer.  Very flavorful and just plain enjoyable all the way through.","hyuga","Sep 17, 2002"
4.27,8.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy. Reddish-orange in color with a fluffy ivory head that holds well and leaves some light lace. The aroma is mainly malty with a softly toasty caramel note and a lightly spicy hoppiness, as well as some dark fruitiness (at times I thought of cherry). The body is medium with a somewhat less than moderate carbonation level (very English), giving a nice creaminess in the mouthfeel. The flavor is richly malty with a solid caramel notes and some distinct, piney hops. It's well balanced, giving a see-saw effect that goes from sweet malt to hop flavor & bitterness with each taste. The finish is dryish with a nice hop flavor. Very nicely done. Very drinkable with alot of character. Highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","Sep 15, 2002"

A nose of baklava (honey, phyllo, roasted pistachios) dirty laundry and guava. Dense and tropical. Silky creamy texture that reveals delicate shadings of melon, tropical blooms, hops, strawberries, new paint, ...

Deep burnt orange to amber in color, the head was very full, fluffy and thick with a light tan color. Noticable hop aroama bubbles bust through. Slightly sweet, floral, and honey smells with a big burst of malt. Taste is unbelievably balanced with supersweet malty richness, and a crisp dry hopped finish. Tastes alot like the best amber ale I have ever had, that rich. I was surprised to see it listed as a Mai-bock. Whatever you want to call it, it's a great beer. Smooth and creamy richness, suspect a higher abv warms your belly. Another pleasant surprise from Rogue. This is another beer that made the cross-country trip from California, and well worth it.","StevieW","Jul 12, 2002"

4.23,7.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I have to admit I'm a bit confused by the style. Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops as much as the next guy (and maybe even more than some), but I didn't think they really fit here.","mophie","May 29, 2002"
