"The ABV to $$$ ratio is strong in this one."
"I had this beer a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it, especially at $6.99 a six pack. More bitterness than I remembered . Tastes better the longer it sits. Good beer that I'd have again, but wouldn't go hunting it down."

"This is a tasty beer, but not one that I'll revisit. There are much better Mai Bocks out there, and JosephsBrau produces much better affordable beers. You might as well try it. I suspect that you won't buy a second bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I haven't had many of this style (Maibock), but it is a perfectly serviceable German-style beer to me. And, man, is the price right on this or what. ~$6.99 a six-pack!"
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is quite drinkable for a mailbock and is a relatively good representation of the style."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty standard bock, not too cloying which is a standard fault, but could use a tad more carbonation to make it more pleasant to drink, more of a preference though"
""
""
"The Verdict: Average. The running theme here is “mild.” Mild aroma, mild taste, mild price. The only thing that’s not mild is the ABV. Drinkable, but nothing exciting about it."
"O: A very, very tasty and authentic German beer. As typical with TJ brand beers, this is a huge bang for your buck. This beer is pretty much a mainstay in my fridge. I love German beers, and there isn't a better value for the quality you're getting here. You can by these by the single bottle...but why would you when there are six packs available?"
"Taste has floral hop notes mixed with a toffee-grainy malt flavor. The alcohol is a bit rough and is not masked very well. Mouthfeel is slick and a little on the sweet side...I kind of wish there was a bit more lively carbonation. Not too bad for a helles bock, but at this price it might be worth a repeat purchase one of these days."
"Overall one of the better styles from Trader Joe's beer selections."
"notes: Maibock. hard to get the style, a slightly maltier lager with just a touch of sweetness. I guess."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin white head with good retention and slight lacing. Mild aroma of sweet malt, grassy hops, slightly spicy. Flavor follows aroma; sweet bready malt, light grassy hops and light estery spice that saves it from being pedestrian. Light bodied. A pleasant, non-challenging bock that is better than expected from a contract brewed ale. Good job on an inexpensive bock, although it leans, perhaps, towards a malty lager in flavor."

"Not much there. Overly sweet and not a pleasant finish."
"Pours a cloudy honey-gold with a thick white frothy cap on top. The nose carries some sweet floral tones, fruity sweetness, and a slight dry huskiness on the closeout. Smooth carbonation. Subtle bite, with a slightly oily feel. Mild fruit-like flavor, apples, honey, crackers. Pretty mild unoffensive beer. Nothing that exciting, but I wouldn't turn one down. A refreshing easy-drinking beer."

"The body was nicely full and smooth, although the stickiness of the finish was a bit annoying. Drinkability was decent, I'd have another. Overall, as with most of the TJ's brews, this isn't a great beer, but a good solid one and a decent value."
"O: It's cheap ($1), drinkable, and features 7% alcohol, but the beer itself doesn't impress. Too intrusively offbeat to be a good beer, but I don't hate it."
""

""
""
"Overall this bock is not bad. I really can say I am impressed more with the fact that this is a store brand beer. Would I try it again... well yes if I was low on cash. Because these Trader Joe brews are a real bargain. $6.49 for a six pack or $1.09 a bottle."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this bock and fastic value for a dollar."
"Two finger thick white head with good retention but little lacing on a clear golden amber body. Aroma is malty with gingerbread and a light spicey note. Flavor is more of the same with full malt backbone and gingerbread notes. Fairly smooth with medium body and light to moderate carbonation. A flavorful beer and a nice version of the style, just not very memorable."
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation that only foams this up slightly on the palate. Result is that beer stagnates a bit in the mouth. Finish is quite dry."
""
"A straight-forward but well brewed (and inexpensive) version of the style."
""
""
""
"o: The aroma and appearance of the beer was outstanding and I thought I was in for a real treat. But that wasn't the case. I am still sitting with this flowery flavor in my mouth that makes me feel like I just ate a bunch of flower petals. There is too much caramel sweetness in this beer and it overpowers the malt flavors that could have been enjoyed. I would suggest they lay of the caramel malts a bit and figure out a way to reduce the harshness (e.g. don't use as fine as a grain crush or maybe watching the sparging pH)."
"Pours a clear gold with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, grassy notes, and a light fruity aroma. Taste is of malt/grain, grassy hops, and some light fruit flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip that quickly fades. This beer has a lower level carbonation with a slightly crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the mouthfeel is a bit off in my opinion."
""
"Poured this Helles from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a clear golden color, produced an average off white head, decent retention and produced nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was faint, some amount of malts and hops come through. Light in body, the Helles is smooth, easy to drink, has some biscuit flavor, toasted malt with a nice balance of hops. Overall it is a decent attempt at a Helles. Great Value for about 1.25 a bottle. Prost!"
"I'd pair this with a lamb shank and mashed potatoes. Oh yes, that sounds perfect."
""
""
""
"O: a fine, if not exceptional, golden bock."
""
"An average flawed beer."
"Overall, I think it was an ok beer. It's good for anyone that likes moderately high hoppy/bitter beer. It wasn't bad."
""
"amber color with a nice head of white that reached a height of around an inch and half before settling back down to earth and leaving just thin lacing in its wake, but for the style nice and a classic look. aroma of sweet bready malts and a classic caramel aroma that was cut with a touch of grain. nice and clean with a semi crisp feel and an overall nice balanced body that really seem to let the taste pop"

"Not a bad beer at all and at $6 a 6 pack and 7% abv it's perfect to pick up before going to a bbq."
"O: Got quite a bit better as I drank, my inital impressions were none to good. Solid example of the style at very good price point as the majority of the TJ's beers I've had have been."
"I have been drinking this stuff for years, so might as well make it official. When so many average beers in San Diego go for over 9 bucks a six, this is almost half that. Especially a bargain for a strong flavorful bock. Even better, it stands up well to big hops as a mixer with the other half of that IPA bomber."
"A nice amber-golden brew with 3 fingers of head that sticks around. Aroma is honey-comb and clover-grassy. Nice sweet maltiness in flavor. A bit dry in the finish with a light grass hops to end it. This is a good beer try one on for size."
"Overall: This is drinkable and I thought it was fine."
"M: Sweet at the beginning turning slowly and really not to much to a bittersweetness and at the very end some hops bitter."
"Clear orange/gold with a meager cap of off-white foam that disappeared quickly. It seemed pretty lifeless during the pour. Caramel aroma, toasted malt, a hint of grassy hops. Same in the flavour, which seemed a little thin. Very low bitterness, which made it seem sweeter than it is, quite toasted and bready. Finished with some sharp bitterness, tastes artificial. Medium to light bodied with low carbonation, more astringency than I liked. I'm not a fan."
"Dr: It's drinkable enough, but the ABV does come through more than it should and it feels produced for the mass."
"**Edit: After reading all the other reviews and seeing an average of B's, I must be convinced that I got a bad batch bottle. Maybe I will be willing to revisit it. Maybe..."
"Pours caramel golden. Not much head. Nose was sweet malt and corn maybe, caramel on the nose as well, nothing special. Tasted like it smelled, flavor is decent, just not great. Sweet, but you can taste the alcohol, burns my stomach on the way down. Not bad for a buck, drinkable."
"Overall: A decent version of a bock. Light but tasty."
"Trader Joe's Hofbrau Bock is a fair attempt at the bock style. Coupled with being less than a buck a bottle, this is one to try."
"T: This isn't a particularly offensive tasting beer, nor is it particularly good tasting. I get some light malt flavor and a bit of subdued grassy hops. It's not the first beer I would go for, but you could certainly do worse. Also, the sausages Trader Joes makes with this beer are killer."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent, except for the headache it is giving me. (Maybe that has more to do with the four beers I had earlier.)"
"D: Alright, but there's some alcohol bite."
"This beer pours out as a golden yellow color with a clumpy white head. The aroma that this brew gives off is of some fresh malts and just a little bit of grassy hops. The taste of the beer is a little weak I thought. Mostly a hefty amount of malts with not much else to back it up. The mouthfeel was decent. Very drinkable and on the lighter side. It's a decent brew but it's just not for me."
"Trader Joe's is a pretty good place to buy beer if you're on a budget. Hofbrau Bock is an excellent example if you're a fan of the style. Hell's bells, it's good beer even if you aren't."
"Poured a rich golden color with just a bit of lingering head. Not much on the nose. Some malt, nothing overpowering. Taste is not great. I've like most of the Trader Joes brand beers, but this one isn't on the same level. Very bitter taste throughout. Very bubbley mouthfeel. Reasonably drinkable, just not to my liking I guess."
"***"
"D - goes down fairly easy but 1, maybe 2, would be enough in a sitting."
"I would score this better on drinkability but the flavors are so strong I am not to eager to drink these one after another."
"D: Metallic finish detracts from what is still a pretty drinkable beer."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Light copper color with a decent-sized head that fizzles out too quickly. Cereal grain aroma with some hearty bread and maybe some caramel. Good but a bit muted. A little corny in flavor but mainly grains and a light toffee sweetness. Vague earthiness, must be hops. Very low bitterness but it's there if you look hard enough. Body is thin for the style, almost closer to pilsener than bock. Medium carbonation, slightly astringent/metallic finish. Would not reach for it again."
"D: Truly hard to beat for $1 a bottle."
"D - A decent beer, but not my favorite for the style. It lacks a bit in the aroma and I think it could be approved in every category if it just had some better carbonation."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Served from bottle into goblet. Flavour is fairly uncomplicated- malt and the label-promised hallertau hops. Pours with a thin head which quickly dissipates; remaining color is orange. The effervescence is not visibly prominent but feels appropriate and drinkable. This beer does get bonus points for being a store-label brand for a national chain but, even with that, it's better than expected."
"12 oz. bottle with code on back label. Brewed by Gordon Biersch with three malts, Hallertau hops and lager yeast; 22 IBUs. It has a nice deep golden color, filtered, with lots of carbonation and a half inch of white head that settles to a fine froth. Smells rather a lot like Yuengling at first - clean with a few lagery adjunct notes - but it becomes a bit more hoppy and bready as it warms. Tastes clean and malty, a bit minerally, with toasted and biscuity notes while the hops bring a sturdy bitterness, and green/floral, almost skunky flavors. The body is light and crisp, highly-carbonated, and it fills out quickly. The label describes it as a traditional bock, but its light color and prominent hoppiness makes it more like a hellesbock, and I judged it as such. For the price, this is a great beer that is worth the cost of admission."
"Very attractive amber color and light brown finger thick head which dissipates quickly. At first you get a hint of sweet honey, quickly followed by a tart citrusy hit that lingers - reminds me of oranges/grapefruit. Finishes pleasantly clean though! Not a bad beer - sweet and tart at the same time; a little bit on the tart side for my taste, but it is not overwhelming. Becasue it finishes so cleanly (very clean after taste), you unwittingly find yourself pulling another bottle out of the fridge while watching the football game :-) Finally, at 7% alcohol by volume and just under a buck per bottle (yes, you can purchase as many individual bottles as you want at Tarder Joe's - 6 = $5.99), this is one I would definitely pick up again."
"Pours a transparent amber-red body with a 1.5 finger head which dwindles to a thin trace of foam sitting on the head. Smells of bread, biscuit and yeast with a sweet hint of EtOH. Tastes of caramel malt, yeasty beasties and hops and EtOH seem to linger. The feel is somewhat interesting in a so-so way as it feels smooth yet slick-I don't know what exactly to think here. Overall a nice bock, but the feel of it is somewhat off-putting; give it a try though!!"
"Decent flavor for $6 bucks a six. Though I enjoyed the Hefeweizen more."
"Drinkability: I found this one to hit the style marks but not push them. A good beer to sit with for a football game, but not one I would look for regularly. Inoffensive beer that hides the alcohol well."
"12 oz bottle from Trader Joe's. Pours a golden color with a practically not existent head. Light aroma of biscuit malt, and piney hops. Medium body, quite tangy and reach. Flavor is dominated by piney, earthy hops balanced by caramel malt. Finish is long and balanced between hops and malt. As with most TJ's products - good beer for the price."
"My first Trader Joe's beer. It pours a clear straight amber topped by a short-lived finger of white foam. The nose comprises caramel, orange peel, flowers, wheat, buttery biscuits, and rye bread. The taste doesn't stray too far from this formula, with the orange coming through a bit more, joined by a sorta clove-ish flavor. The body is a heavy light, with a light carbonation and a very fluid feel. Overall, a bit on the flimsy side, but a pretty decent and drinkable beer."
"Full bodied."
"Taste, a little bland, the aroma made me think this would be super dry and relatively hoppy for style, but instead, it tasted like it had diminished carbonation and by virtue, any of the prickly hop spice feel you'll get in a good version of this style. Good price on this stuff though."
"This beer pours a very attractive, dark golden tan with plenty of head and some lovely lace. Good carbonation. A very pleasant, sweet malty aroma. Taste is a little grassy hops with a strong malt backbone and a little alcohol kick at the end. Very well done for a beer that is 7% ABV and only $5.99/six."
"Overall, this might not be the best beer in the world, but it's very easy to drink, well balanced and unobjectionable. I imagine that anyone who likes beer would like this one, and I'm not sure of many other beers that are this good with such a cheap price tag. No middle man, no jacked up price and a solid, drinkable beer."
"B: Bought a sixer. Will be my last I think. Too bad because TJ's does rebottle some excellent single-malt, so I was hoping they could do the same with beers."
"Overall: Fairly drinkable, but can become cloying. It looks good, tastes good, but isn't exactly lively."
"This beer pours with a slightly deep golden color with a constant stream of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The foam, which recedes quickly, leaves a surprisingly nice lacing pattern. The aroma is lacking a bit. If you try real hard you can detect notes of clover and honey. This is a pretty smooth drinking beer that has a slight hop character at the front and a tiny bit of alcohol at the end but both are so toned down that neither flavor comes out that much. Overall not a bad representation of the style but there are definitely better ones out there."
"For 5.99 @ 7% abv a damn good beer. Great to bring to a party: easy to drink, big bang for your buck, goes down smooth. Doesn't hold up to other helles I have had, but, once again, for the price..."
"The drinking is good, but this hides a 7 abv almost better than anything ive ever had. Feels more like a light lager than a bock, but still has the taste qualities to it, pretty good beer"
"Drinkability: This really isn't the best beer out there, let alone the best beer of its style. That said, my sixer was only $5.99, so this makes an excellent choice for a good beer to have around at a very affordable price- especially for its 7% ABV. I wouldn't buy this normally, but this is a beer I'd definitely be willing to drink again on a budget."
"I got this because our store does not carry teh Fat Weasel anymore. I was please with the bock as replacement to the weasel. It comes with a full flaver and a strong taste. It's a big bear for the price of 6.99 a sixpack. I'll continue to pick it up frequently and enjoy it year around."
"A little light in the flavor department, but overall not a bad maibock. Poured golden with a touch of amber. Slightly sweet grain notes in the aroma. Up front also a bit of sweet grain, quickly followed by moderately roasted caramel flavor. Finish was clean with some residual bitterness. The 7% abv was well integrated with no ETOH notes."
"Drinkability: Not too bad overall, if you go in open minded you probably won't be disappointed. If you're expecting a bock you'll definitely be a bit upset. For $5.99 a sixer it works though...especially great if you cook up some of the bratwurst that TJs makes with this beer..."
"M/D - Interesting taste, malt with a sweet citrus taste but mixed caramel. Not sure if I would get this one again but it was worth trying and recommend it"
"Drinkability is good. I wouldn't mind having two, which I don't usually do for beers over 6%. The sweetness is not prohibitive."
"Another value, man. Not my favorite Trader Joe's beer, not by a longshot, but it does have a fairly strong hop presence and a pleasure to drink due to its easy nature."
"Light bock color, golden amber, with enough head retention and lacing to momentarily satisfy me if not blow my socks off. Sweet, honey-like aroma, with hoppy notes of the most nectar-like floral variety. Clean and a bit light, if not exactly subdued. The flavor is again quite sweet, but lightly so, rather than being syrupy and full. Pretty malty overall, with the hops still quite floral. A little spicy bit of alcohol and a grassy undertone add some color. Light in the mouth, clean in the finish. Not quite dry, but highly carbonated so there's not much afterflavor. In general, a little light and tending towards drinkability in favor of challenging. Not a bad thing, and for the price I expect nothing less (or more, as it were). Decent choice for a party or when you're feeling like a bock but want to knock a couple back."
"A good beer, not overwhelming but certainly quite drinkable."
"D- Not a bad beer at all, clean, true to style, malty yet nicely hop balanced. Makes me look forward to spring!"
"Pours a clear copper with a big with a big white head. Aromas are very sweet with lots of grass but also too much alcohol. The flavors are all caramel with a faint toastiness. The alcohol really detracts from the taste. It is not bad but I'm not a fan."
"Taste. A slight honey sweetness with a touch of grain. Followed by dry resinous hop bitterness."
"Like most of the beers from Trader Joe's, there is nothing bad here. I just wish there was more of the good stuff."
"Bottle poured into pint glass. Light copper color with a decent-sized head that fizzles out too quickly. Cereal grain aroma with some hearty bread and maybe some caramel. Good but a bit muted. A little corny in flavor but mainly grains and a light toffee sweetness. Vague earthiness, must be hops. Very low bitterness but it's there if you look hard enough. Body is thin for the style, almost closer to pilsener than bock. Medium carbonation, slightly astringent/metallic finish. Not awful but I'll reach for a German bock every time, even if it's had to suffer through overseas transport and millennia on a BevMo shelf."
"Pours a clear filtered golden body along with a large white head that dissipates to a sheet of lacing. The aromas are strong fruity characteristics of apples along with a maltiness and German spice hop kick. The flavors are sweet pale malt along with a slight apple fruit character. The hops clean it all up and bring it together rather well. The mouthfeel is rather creamy and tasty. At 7% this is a rather tasty bock that is right up my alley."
"Poured a dark golden color with lots of carbonation. The head quickly disappeared to almost nothing. The nose was sweet caramel malts, citrus fruits and yeast. Very sweet up front with caramel malts and a touch of honey and a light bitter finish that ends quickly. The body was light / medium and carbonated well which made for a very light drinkable bock. Overall very average."
"One bottle of a mixed sixer I received from my parents for my 26th birthday."
"Medium, chewy mouthfeel sits on the palate, with ample carbonation. Certainly a drinkable beer, and a fine offering from Trader Joe's. This is the first TJ's beer I've tried, and I'm curious to see how the other styles fare."
"Overall, not too shabby a brew. The price can't be beat for the product."
"Sweet caramel and toasted grain flavor segue to a spicy finish. Slightly rich and buttery in body from a robust amount of malts. Decent lingering malt finish with a good level of carbonation for the rich body of the beer. Bit narrow in the complexity department makes for an average drinkability."
"D- 7% abv is a good level and this is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Considering the source and the price, it's not too bad, but not worth seeking out. However, it's a decent sipper and I am glad that Trader Joe's made it at the appropriate high abv."
"D: Exactly what I was expecting. I slightly better than average beer, but, for the price, I'm not complaining. I got what I expected and paid the appropriate price as well."
"You really can't go wrong with these Trader Joe's beers. At the price they're nice everyday beers. I quite often go to the fridge and find only beers that I want to hang onto for a tasting, or more basic stuff that just doesn't have enough flavor. Up steps Joe. And they're great for taking to parties where you never know what you'll find. And, they make great intro beers for the non-initiated as well. But OK... The Hofbrau Bock pours a deep amber with golden highlights. It'd be nice if it was a little darker, but it certainly fits the style as is. The aroma is restrained and clean, only revealing a hint of honeyish malt and a suggestion of floral and grassy hops in the background. The flavor is fuller, of course, and the maltiness is like honey-drizzled bread. It opens up as it warms, and the toastiness really becomes apparent in the finish. It's balanced by a firm bitterness, and along with the alcohol, it finishes dry and spicy with spicy and gently grassy hops swirling here and there as it slowly fades. Could it be better? Yes. A bit more malt girth at the center would really help to focus it, and then round out the overall flavor. But as it is, it's still a really nice, balanced and flavorful bock. I won't say I could drink 50 of these, because we all know what 50 eggs did to Cool Hand Luke, but I could easily drink 3, and maybe 4 of these in a night. So, overall, not great, but pretty good."
"D - This is a pretty good brew from Trader Joe's. It is not a bad deal for a buck a bottle."
"I was not sure what to expect from a TJ's beer, and this was a pleasant surprise. Quite refreshing, and a nice deal @ $5.99/sixer."
"Sweet with some cleansing bitterness and unexpected carbonation. All I can muster is candy corn, maybe some factory made square caramel candy, if you close your eyes and free associate. Some type of hops are in there, giving it some German credbility, but ultimately it's kind of flaccid. Pretty dull candy flavored alcohol delivery device..."
"Clear gold under a good sized creamy head. Smells bock-y: clean toasted malts, sweet bread, and some grassy spice from the hops. Rich toasted malts upfront in the flavor, caramel, and a bit of hop bitterness. Quite sweet which could turn some people off. Medium bodied with some texture to it...maybe even a little chewy. Certainly a perfectly good interpretation of a standard bock."
"Overall, this was not very complex, but it was very good and you can't beat the price for this one. I thought it was a solid bock and I will buy this one again."
"This beer has a bit of an identity crisis. Bock or Maibock? Interesting enough as it rest in the nowhere land between the two."
"D--Nice and drinkable, not too heavy, but the alcohol will probably get to you a bit faster than normal."
"D: Not a good pick if you're at TJ's unless you are looking for ABV at the expense of flavor."
"Drinkability: Not the full bodied, well caramelized malt bomb I was expecting. Drinkable, but not worthy of another visit."
"Drinkability: Doesn't taste bad, mouthfeel is alright and its pretty easy to drink overall. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it."
"Pours a clear yellow with short head and poor retention. There's little to no lacing present. Smells of a lager with a slight wheat smell. Fits the bock style fairly well, though not very dark at all. a smooth flavor with a slightly sour aftertaste. Very low carbonation. Overall, not too bad (I'm not a big lager or bock fan) and fairly easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer. I would drink it again."
"Pours clear yellow-gold. White head of large bubbles two fingers high. Head lays down fairly quickly leaving just a touch of lacing on sides of glass and surface of beer. Some aroma of cloves, malt and citrus. Initial taste holds no smoke or grassiness; some malt, but not sweet; some crisp carbonated bite; a little cloves and allspice on the finish. Overall, a well-crafted, flavorful brew."
"The taste is also definitely in character for a strong lager/pale bock, but just on the lower, rougher end of the spectrum and closer to some higher ABV malt liquors (like Steel Reserve). It's a bit rough, sweet, raisiny/grapey with old, musty fruit, some meaty grain. It's a bit sweet, but then rough, biting, spicey alcohol takes over a little too much, along with cooked vegetables and a rough, thin, bland minerally quality. It's not bad, but not really good. That said, my wife really likes this, and she doesn't like maibocks or other pale bocks or European strong lagers (but she does like some malt liquors)."
"Fairly full bodied with minimal carbonation. Flavor is quite nice. The caramel malt hits the tastebuds first, but any sweetness is nicely attentuated with hoppiness and a nice tanginess. Long finish from these lagered hops. Alcohol is there but not really distracting. Very drinkable, a well-made beer...high ABV for a session beer, but a good brew for cold winter nights."
"Drinkability: At 7% abv, too strong. Did not finish the glass. Sorry, Joe."
"Far from complex, this bock delivers fine flavor with an even more delightful texture. Had I only had sight and smell to judge it by, I would've written it off as sub-par, but it delivers where it counts most. Wish I had more than just one, because this is a keeper."
"Decent."
"Don't pass up."
"T: Malty, slightly sweet. Light bodied, smooth carbonation. Bready body with a floral hop taste to balance the malt. The finish leaves a slightly watery taste in the mouth. No strong alcohol presence. Not the best bock, but very drinkable and great purchase for the price."
"Drinkability: After Stockyard Oatmeal Stout this is my favorite beer from Trader Joe's. I wouldn't get it again, but it's good and a bargain."
"Not the bext example of a bock."
"D: Not bad at all. Packs a decent punch and has some good flavor. Mildly recommended."
"Can't beat the Trader Joe's price either, of $6 a sixer these days. I believe this is a Gordon Bierch-made lager, very nice!"
"Drinkability - could be better, I wouldn't go for this one again."
"Clean pour, fine aroma, good tasting beer, but nothing that stands out."
"Flavor is a nice surprise. The caramel malt character is nice and rich with a pleasant hop finish of earthy grass and dried hay. It's creamy and smooth with little trace ot he 7%ABV. Tastes relatively authentic in terms of style and a great beer for $5 a sixpack."
"I don't see too many straight up bocks around, so this was a sure pick for me the other night. Pours a very good looking gold color, with a lasting white head. Aroma is of bready malt...has lager written all over it. Taste is crisp and bready, with a bit of grain husk to boot. Mouthfeel was a good balance between hops and malt, maintaining carbonation all the while. Alcohol is not evident at all on this one despite the 7%. The six pack of this lasted me two nights. Not exactly awe struck by this beer, but impressed. There should be more bocks around. Cheers"
"Well holy crap Trader Joe's sharts out another good call! I'm a fan of this golden lion's mane colored brau! It tastes like a baby belgian trippel and the 7.2% abv is nice and refreshing. The mouthfeel doesn't putz about leaving you unfulfilled and doesn't give you syrupy throat either. Great Scott I'm impressed with the sweet and subtly complex malt character. I don't taste any damn hops, but at 22 ibu's they are doing their job like a cool rhythm bassist way in the back grooving away. Give it a bounce!"
"I picked this up today just for kicks. There wasn't much of head to speak of, but I did like the dark gold color. Not much hop smell on the nose, but there was a nice sweet maltiness. The taste was pretty good for a beer that cost $4.99 a sixer. There was a richness not commonly found in other lagers (especially domestic macroes found at this price point). The taste matched its smell in that I found a sweet malt flavor that finished with a slight amount of hops. It had a light amount of carbonation and decent bitterness. The mouth feel was a little heavy with as noted by another reviewer a syrup consistency. However, I liked this beer...the price really helped."
"Very drinkable. I could drink it all day."
"It's not one of the most masterful Micros, but I haven't had many sub $1/bottle beers with this caliber of brewing."
"Moderate carbonation, reasonably crisp, felt OK in the mouth. But sweetness and a moderate lack of balance would limit this to one. Not a terrible dinner brew. Certainly interesting for the price."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with a medium head. Smell is spices with apple banana. The taste is very spicy a little alcohol hint as well. The mouthfeel was nice with a good drinkabilty despite its high ABV."
"d: Easy i guess. A little pilsner, a little malt liquor, not much bock. Okay maybe there is, I dunno...it's a decent beer."
"The mouthfeel is sort of thin, with the beer being a little flat. However, this beer is very drinkable. It has a high alcohol content, but it goes down nice and smooth."
"Another good value for the money from Trader Joes."
"This beer pours a smart looking golden amber color, with a frothy white head that dissipates over time and leaves only trace elements of the lacey stuff. Not a bad looking beer, but nothing special to see... move along.... The aroma is, as all good bocks should be, nice and malty. This nose also has some strong banana nut bread smells in it as well. Faint licorice and strawberry scents waft in and out accordingly. The taste follows suit. It's faintly nutty, and strongly banana-y, with a heavy dose of malt. Some undiscernable spices make a presence in the mouth, as does an apple/strawberry tribute. Finishes slightly hoppy, with a mildly acidic bitter aftertaste. I'm no bock expert, but this beer tastes okay to me. And even if it's not in line with proper German bocks, I still admit to liking the flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and, at times, creamy, with a rather dry finish. On the whole, a bit sweet, but an overall drinkable beer from TJ's."
"Seems that the more I contemplate and pay attention to the flavor, the less I like this beer. It's not bad, but it just seems a bit crude."
"Mouthfeel is a touch slick on the finish with too much fizz up front. This is by far the least impressive of the TJ's Gordon Biersch brewed beers. Not very good."
"The beer pours a crisp dark yellow with a decent head. The aroma is of sweet malts. The taste has a great maltiness with just a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy with sticky alcohol. This one makes for a refreshing summer beer and for 92 cents a bottle, it's a very decent brew."
"drinkability is good. this is a somewhat refreshing beer, that doesn't take a toll on the stomach, and finishes with a bit of sharpness. for fans of the style, this one is a decent example."
"This Bock seems to be more of the Maibock variety, with its lighter color and higher %ABV. Pretty much as expected for the style. Crisp grains, light but assertive hop presence, and a little higher alcohol content. As always with Trader Joe's beer, the price is right. Recommended."
"Hey, nice surprise here! This is a damn good beer. Great value too, at just a little over $5 a sixer. I'll have to try some more of the Trader Joe's beers now. Recommended."
"M: starts with medium carbonation. ends without any."
"Drinkability- I like it, but as bocks go, it's not quite sweet enough."
"Again, considering the economics inloved here, this isn't a bad beer and I can see picking up a single or two on occasion if in the mood for something cheap with a kick (and more drinkable than the Fat Weasel Ale it is sold beside)."
"Even so, this slides down the throat faily nicely, and is a worthy beer."
"($0.92 / 12 oz bottle)"
"Crystal clear golden copper in color, beautiful. Light puffy white head that maintains its presence. The nose is grainy, some toasty malts and biscuits are noted. Smooth, lightly carbonated; grassy hops, touch of perfume hops and a large biscuity body. The grainy like hops seem to dominate the bored palate; very soft and cotton candy finish. Very lame for the 7.00ABV, but a tough style to nail. OK stuff."
"Sensing the alcohol when the ABV is a middle-of-the-road 7% is a major flaw in my opinion. Otherwise it's a decent drinker. To be honest, though, it's strongest point is how it looks in the glass."
"Drinkability: This is an average example of, what is to me, an unappealing style."
"Pretty easy to drink, and not bad for a grocery house brand."
"Have to say that I enjoyed this one despite the initial smell. A nice well balanced beer that should go well with a range of foods. Crisp enough for summer, enough alcohol for a cold winter's night."
"Drinkability: For the price it's worth a try, but I really want trader joe's to do more with there brews."
"Clear gold body, nice looking fluffy white head. This is deifinitely more like a maibock, with the light colored body, and spicy alcohol and malt. Not much more than a light graininess on the nose, this is along the quality of the other TJ's offerings, not bad, but not that great, either. Some spiciness, but not really the full experience you want with the style."
"Decent maibock...reminds me some fo the Summit maibock..definitely worth the low price.."
"Clear light golden. Slight, wispy white head. Moderate lace. Light malts. Sweet aroma overall. Not much hop presence, but that's o.k. Would like some more bready malt aromas though. Taste starts with light caramel malts and a hay like accent. Nothing special here, but nothing bad either. The mouthfeel is agreeable enough. Lightly carbonated. Medium-full obdy. Pretty easy to drink, but not as malty as I like my maibocks. Average beer here."
"Served in a pint glass it pours golden and clear, with a small white head which goes away fast. Not much lacing. It smells sweet, mainly like grain/bread with a small bit of citrus. The first taste is of grain, but there's a good hoppy bitterness at the end with a slight aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, with medium carbonation. This is drinkable, but I just wish it had a stronger taste to it. I could drink this now and again, and for the price it's a good deal. But overall it's a little above average, nothing great."
"Pours a very bright, golden amber hue with lazy bubbling. The aroma starts out a very, veryy bready malt when its cool. The aroma gets a tit finky as it warms. The taste is a light toasted malt mixed with subtle German hops. The palate is very clean. But not refreshing. Although the aftertaste leaves a good lingering flavor of toast and candi sugar."
"At $4.99 a 6 pack this is a great beer. Sure there are better bocks out there but this one is good enough and really affordable. One of my favorites from the Trader Joes/Gordon Biersch line."
"Pretty typical from my experiences with Trader Joe beers. Pours pale golden-orange with a medium thick bone white head and decent lacing. The aroma is a little musty, with sweet malt and a bit of citrus. Medium-bodied and clean with sweet malt flavoring, as well as some citrus and hops in the background. Lingering spicy hops aftertaste keeps the malty flavor from becoming cloying, yet overall this brew is not quite balanced enough to be an enjoyable session beer. Just a little below average, but worth the roughly 83 cents per bottle."
"It does leave you with a nice warming 'glow' after you swallow"
"Notes: For a Trader Joe's beer this was one of the better products I've had. For the price this is OK and when in a pinch I would consider it again, for now I'm out."
"This was a very clean beer. It was enjoyable and quite drinkable. A better beer than I was expecting from Trader Joe's."
"I would buy a six."
"It poured a pale golden color with a head of foam that was about 1in. in height. The head receded fast, but just a little skim of foam still remained during the entire duration of drinking. The aroma was kind of grassy with fruits, hops, and some malts in the background. The taste was about above average, not too complex, but still had plenty of flavor. What I could detect was a moderate hoppy taste up front and with a slight malty aftertaste at the end. Nothing too special with the mouthfeel except for the usual light, carbonated, bitter, and somewhat watery mouthfeel. While this may not be the brew of royalty to me, this did make a nice affordable beer that would come through for me if nothing else was available."
"A bottle my wife picked up at Trader Joes in Chicago. Pours golden to yellow, big rising bubbles, quarter inch head gone in less than a minute. good lacing. all around nice looking beer. Odor is not so good. slightly skunky smell, some hops. my wife said ""it vaguely smells like beer"". wheaty, biscuity flavor, reminded me of sour oranges. kind of like a hefe that died before adulthood. hoppy aftertaste. pretty smooth with a tiny bite. this would be too weird to drink all the time. not the best i've had from TJs."
"Yet again, another solid beer at a very reasonable price at your local Trader Joe's."
"D- This beer is not half bad. Quite a deal @ 5.29 a six-pack. Nothing earth shattering but certainly worth the try ... a good beer to mix things up a bit but not something I'd stick to all night."
"Well-balanced and fairly straightforward. There is definately a good bit of malt in here, but it's not exactly the most exciting malt profile I've ever tasted. If I'm going to pummel my liver with higher ABV beers, I'd rather do it with something that has a bit more panache."
"Drinkability: The more I drink, the more syrupy this gets. Still, these go down pretty easy, especially if I had some buttered bread and/or bratwurst to go with it."
"Drinkability  This is an enjoyable beer that I would have again, and its superbly priced for its quality."
"Light amber colour with very little head. Smells like a pilsner infused with brown sugar. That might sound like a nasty clash, but it doesn't make me wince. Very slightly yeasty taste gives way to a rich malty flavour backed with a suitably tangy hop profile. This brew isn't outstanding, but it is certainly well balanced. The 7% abv is not particularly apparent. This is much better stuff than the Shiner which Texans are apt to wax lyrical about."
"This is a good beer. Should it be called a Bock? No. Not even close. Blond Bock? Yes. That would be a more accurate description of this brew. Poured out to a golden color with a nice foam head. Medium level of carbonation. Some lacing noted in the glass. Aromas of fresh malts and grain, with some toastiness. Nice. Taste was along the same lines as the aroma. Very straightforward flavors of malt, hops, grain and some unsweet-butterscotch. Aftertaste was smooth and satisfying. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite enjoyable. A good level of drinkability, this could be a ""fallback"" beer to keep in the fridge for BMC drinkers who frequent your home to introduce them to good beer, yet keeping the Duvel and such from being wasted on those who wouldn't appreciate it. Hell, I'd keep it in the fridge for myself. Recommended."
"As much as I wanted to enjoy this beer, I was not impressed. This is a below-average bock. It's taste does nothing to encourage me to buy another. Not a hard beer to drink, but for me, nearly an impossible beer to enjoy."
"Drinkability and Notes  Very drinkable, because of the balance, mouthfeel and the very cheap price. At $4.99 for a sixer its one of the better cheap beers out there. Definitely a good beer when you want solid flavor, but not a lot of complexity."
"Not bad for what could be perceived as a ""budget"" brew (paid $5.49 for a six-pack.) A golden colored beer that pours with a frothy white foam that rises up and lingers, a crisp malt aroma is followed by a crisp malt flavor. A little sweet perhaps, but this is a bock, and I found it to have just the right bitterness. Sure, this is a pretty simple beer (not very complex) but this sample was fresh and hit the spot on cool spring evening and was extra tasty from a ceramic stein, but then again I have a soft spot for (blonde) Maibocks this time of year. Hofbrau was maybe not as good as Summit or others I've tried, but was rather satisfying."
"Not bad really, quite drinkable..though not a great bock."
"This beer pours a rusty orange color with a very small flimsy airy white head that fades abruptly. Looks low on carbonation and tastes low as well. Aroma is grassy, slightly floral, and somewhat spicy and toasted. Not bad, but a little weak. Taste has more toasted sweet malts and less floral hop flavor. The hops that were there in the aroma seem lost in the mouthfeel and flavor. I'm only really getting toasted honeyish flavors and a little breadiness. Not bad but not great. The lack of carbonation hurts this beer, needs more liveliness. Still, its really smooth and the abv is very well hidden. Finish leans towards cloying. Still, not terrible but not too great either. Good for its price."
"For the ABV, there is little alcohol profile and this is a very drinkable brew. At the price, this is the best of the TJ values."
"Drinkability- Fairly impressed with this one, but not as a bock. Good sample brew."
"Pours a full, clear gold color and is topped by a frothy thin tan head that disappears fairly quickly. The aroma is grainy smelling and has a bit of alcohol in the finish. The aroma is pretty subdued, and because of that fairly disappointing. The taste is sweet up front with a solid sweet malt taste that has a hint of toffee to it. There is perhaps a hint of spicy hop notes here in the flavor and a bit of bitterness in the finish. This is clearly a well made beer, but it just is lacking in flavor and depth."
"overall: 7% MGD"
"Drinkability is satisfactory. Overall, this was a step up over the others on the TJ's line, though not by much. Hofbrau Bock falls into the range of a decent brews that make it into my ""take it or leave it"" group."
"Overall, one of the worst beers produced by Trader Joe's that I've tasted so far!"
"Drinkability: Excellent accompaniment to anything that comes with a Super Bowl spread. Hot wings, hoggies, chips, even carrots and ranch dip. But be warry of heavily spiced food with this one (Italian, Indian, and some Mexican), as well as spicey food that is heavy, Sorry Carnitas, you're out with this one."
"Not a bad beer, I suspect that this is Gordon Biersch Blond Bock relabeled."
"Overall: The last of the four Trader Joes Brewing Co. beers that I picked up last week. Out of the four (the other three were Bohemian Lager, Bavarian Hefeweizen and Vienna Lager); this is the strongest and perhaps the best of the bunch."
"I think I liked this one a bit better out of the bottle where it seemed maltier."
"Overall Impression: Nice drinkable beer. Nothing thrilling about it, but for the price ($4.99 at Trader Joe's) this is a good everyday offering."
