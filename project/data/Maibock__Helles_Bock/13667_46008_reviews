"Overall, this is not a good representation of a bock, helles or maibock. It is way too sweet. There are some spring bock features, maybe a touch of biscuit, but the hops are not balancing."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a semi-cloudy dark straw, a little lighter than expected for a bock, but still good, with a small white head. Smells of nice grain, very sweet. Tastes of sweet grain, with hints of a fruity aftertaste. Beer is carbonated correctly and finishes really nice for its light body, good carbonation. Overall an above average beer."

"O - not a bad brew. My first from Starr Hill Brewery. Paired well with the Buffalo Chicken Salad I was enjoying. Good enough that I ordered another while I polished off my lunch. This is supposedly a winter seasonal brew, but I don't get it...i'd drink this in the summer / fall, but nothing about this beer says ""winter"". Cheers [ii]D"

"This was painfully average and nothing I'll ever have again unless given."
"Swigged this one straight from the bottle at a holiday party. Apparently, this varietal is actually a special seasonal, but couldn't really pick that up from the label nor the taste. This came in a regular variety pack along with the northern lights, red ale and imperial stout. By the time I got to this one I didn't holdout much hope. In addition to the I don't think Maibocks bring much to the table in general. It was surprisingly light, with a sweet finish. The website states that is uses munich malts helping pacify my taste buds into thinking this is a german original. Seemed like a typical lager. Descent beer, best of the mixed case."

"O: For the price, you could do much worse. And as I said this is Starr Hill at its best in my opinion."
"O: A good, solid lager, worthy of the winter season, but able to hold its own any time of year. Worth picking up a few more the next time I'm at the store."
""
"Drinkability: goes down kind of smooth. Not too bad. Pretty average brew, considering this is the first time I've had this style. Somewhat reminds me of a winter beer. Maybe I would have this again, but I would recommend it. Still goes down pretty smooth."

"This tastes much like an adjunct lager. It has off flavors presumably from poor temperature management during the lagering process. I definitely won't have this again."
""
"O: Not the most popular style in the world, but I dig it on occasion. This was nice, but one was totally enough for me."

"This beer is labeled as a winter bock, but it’s a little lighter in color than I would expect for a beer with this designation and its taste is a little sweeter than expected. I’m not sure I would purchase this one again due to its candy- like character, but I can agree that it has some interesting things to offer."
"Very nice Maibock! I like it."

"Bought as part of a sampler pack. Pours a hazy golden color, not much head to it. Very little in the aroma department. Taste is light to medium bodied, sort of boozy, some honey and strong malts. Mouthfeel is not great, very low drinkability. I'm not a big fan of bocks/maibocks to begin with, but this one is just not good, even hard to drink even. Way too much of an alcohol taste for only a 6.5% ABV and the taste is just lacking... I'll pass."
""
"Comments: A fine beer for winter weather for those of us that aren’t hop heads."
"I haven't tried this style of beer before and thought it was pretty good. Maybe a bit of the sweet side though."
""
"Not bad; far better than some of the others I've had from this brewery."
""
""
"O - Light and easy-drinking, this is no doubt a refreshing beer. There was a bit too much carbonation for me, though this did mellow a bit as the beer warmed. This is a Winter offering from Starr Hill, but one could argue it would be better suited for a warmer time of year as it's not the type of beer to knock the chill off. That said, it's a nice choice to have in good company and one that I'll enjoy again in the future."
""
"Overall, not having anything else from Starr Hill, I appreciate this brew. As a bock I would like something more."
""
""
"Beer is medium in body has a little roastiness at the end and an aftertaste that shouldn't be there. Not my favorite but it is fine I guess. I won't have more though."
""
"Overall I am usually not a big fan of this brewery, but the Platinum made me want to try them again. This is not a dismal failure, it is certainly drinkable, but nothing I would want to have again."
"Carbonation has a nice background role. The mouth feel is thick and a little creamy. The taste notes are very grainy, but not wheat. Very malty. There is a bitterness at the end that could use more, of what I can't tell you, but it doesn't quite finish with a bang. It is a good beer. Not sure what WinterBock's are supposed to be, but I like the versatility of this beer. May buy it again if it is on sale or on tap."
""
""
"Overall, nothing special, but it is another solid part of the Starr Hill lineup."
"This beer is just ok. I thought the flavor was lacking and could have used more maltiness."
""
""
"Pours a dark, pretty yellow. Thick head dissipates quickly. There are a number of flavors going on here. A little spice, a little sweet, some nutmeggy notes. It's both a blessing and a curse then that these flavors are very well balanced, so that it goes together well but also makes it difficult to detect any one. It finishes sweet and lingers."
"O: While this particular experience was mediocre, I know for a fact this is a great beer, even from the bottle. I bought four cases in one go when they went on sale and regretted it only slightly. Definitely recommended. It does not taste near its strength and is likely to be popular even with non 'beer geeks.'"

"Pours a honeyish amber colored body with a small white head. Aromas are predominantly toasty with a good amount of brown sugary sweetness and noticeable alcohol. Hops are minimal. Taste reminiscent of a pancakes and syrup, with a big toastiness. Full bodied with a warmi alcohol finish. Not really my cup of tea, but I can appreciate why a lot of people like it."
""
"Creamy and pleasant for a few sips, but perfumey flavor gets old. A little hot, a little touch of soapiness. Not one for a big glassful."
"Nice, somewhat orange in appearance. Some floaters going on in there. Malty, mild sulfur aroma. Decent malt flavor with enough hops to be noticed. Sulfury, bready with a mild lingering sweetness. Decent body-the malty sweetness really tends to hold this together. A decent enough beer. Maybe a tad to sulfury and yeasty-could be cleaner for my liking. Still worth a try."
"D: Delicious. One of my favorite Starr Hill beers."
"They hit a home run with this for sure. Great job!"
"Drinkability: A fairly good brew overall, but nothing great. I would enjoy drinking this brew again, but I don't think I would necessarily get too excited about it."
"Purchase before July 2011 notched on the label. Pours hazy copper, medium off-white head. Good head retention with a bit of lacing. Aroma is muted malt, bready with a touch of floral hops. Some more floral hop flavor up front, changing quickly to an intensely nutty, bready malt flavor. Not entirely pleasant actually. Some chocolate but lots of nutty flavor. On the sweet side, medium bodied."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): pours a hazy amber orange with a foamy, off-white head. Decent head retention. The nose has notes of citrus, grass, wet paper, a bit of hay, and green apple. The flavor profile is light with notes of bread, a subtle fruity-honey sweetness, a bit of dough, and a slight earthiness. Not much in the way of bitterness. Medium to rich body that coats the mouth. The carbonation is minimal and soft. The finish is medium with a sort of odd maltiness lingering."
"Overall - I am VERY impressed with this unique concoction. Starr Hill struck gold with this one. I highly recommend trying this one out."
"12 oz. twist-off longneck with clearly marked freshness date. Brewed with two-row, Munich, pilsner and caramel malts; hopped to 25 IBUs with Hallertau, and fermented with German lager yeast. Pours a nice amber color, fairly clear, with lots of carbonation and an off-white head that reduces to a dense cap and leaves a bit of lacing. Smells malty and toasty, with a few hop notes and yeast artifacts, and some distracting DMS. The flavor follows through, lightly sweet and bitter, with a breath of ethanol and some vegetal tones on top of a dry, highly-carbonated, moreish body. Definitely some off flavors on this one. It's a few months past the best-by date, but it isn't even a year old, and a beer like this should last at least as long fairly intact. However, the sulfury flavors don't necessarily develop during aging so it may have tasted like this from the get-go. I'd pass on this one."
"D- Very drinkable, even at 6.5%. Could be a session beer, though it's probably better used for a two beer buzz. I enjoyed the beer, and will probably buy it again. However, I can say that my wife does not enjoy the slightly ""bitter"" beer breath the beer leaves behind."
"D: A nice tasting bock that has high drinkability at any time of the year. The ABV is just right."
"Pours a light, golden color with decent head that manages to hang around on top of the brew fairly well with minimal lacing. Very sweet aromas of honey, crystal malts, candied apples and a flurry of spices with a bit of an alcohol scent that makes its way in the nose. Taste is quite solid, malty and sweet up front, nice bitter hop character, apples, cinnamon, some faint citrus notes manage to come through as well. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation presence that's not too overwhelming. Overall, a great winter lager."
"I realize that a slightly heftier malt bill with additional sweetness is probably what makes this a winter appropriate lager, but it seemed slightly out of balance to me."
"Drinkability is good. This is an unusual choice it seems for a winter offering, given that the style is of a spring beer, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Drinkability: A pretty average bock. Nothing great but nothing offensive. An interesting choice for a winter seasonal but still pretty tasty."
"D/M: Very simple drinkable bock beer. Doesn't overwhelm the palate with spice but lacks a lot of the strong body that you would want with this kind of beer. Surprising but nothing too extreme"
"Definitely had the traditional winter taste. Flavored with wheat, hops, grass, the mouthfeel was excellent."
"D: Tasty but light. Not a bad brew."
"D - It pulled through with the winter feel. A good ""lighter"" winter beer in a season bogged down (not a bad thing most of the time!) by rich, thick brews. I could do a six-pack of this on a session beer night."
"Appears honey golden with white frothing head fine speckled lacing left unevenly. Aroma sweet tart apples with hints of honey and biscuit malt sweetness. Herbal hops are minimal but evident. Flavors hit the sides of the palate with the sweetness, juicy fruit and honey tones. Ripened apples, spicy herbal background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied a bit of residual sugars could become cloying at times. Carbonation is soft even goes down easily. Drinkability overall is something I will look forward to each winter season, nice to see a Maibock that early in the season."
"This was tasty little Bock from Starr Hill that had just enough hop character to nicely balance out all of those heavy malts. This was very smooth for the size which kept the overall drinkibility of this pretty good."
"Great smooth and creamy body. Carbonation level is moderate. Flavors of honey, grass, some fresh bread, and has a finish of sourdough. Wow. I think this may be my favorite SH offering to date. I could drink this all year round. I like that it's not a typical spicy winter release. I like this style. Good work, Starr Hill!"
"The thickness might wear on some, but I find this a pretty drinkable beer on a cold night."
"D: A bready, fruity, pleasant winter Helles bock. This has an interesting flavor profile, managing an appealing balance and a great mouthfeel. If you're in the area, Starr Hill is an unheralded option that you won't be disappointed by."
"D: Quite drinkable, and a lot lighter than the ABV would lead me to believe. This may be my favorite Starr Hill (though it's in serious competition with The Love."
"D - As drinkable as it gets."
"drinkability: good"
"A friend brought a sixer of these over. A tasty beer, if not the most exciting thing ever brewed. Amber color with a smallish head and fairly weak lacing. Nose and flavor are fairly well balanced, fruity and some cookies and caramel malt. Nice. Body is fine, appropriate for the style. Better than the other Starr Hill efforts I've tried."
"Very nice winter brew from Starr Hill...kind of strange to say, but it almost reminds me of a Belgian wit in some ways. Almost like a cross between a winter warmer and a wheat beer, even though there isn't any wheat in it. Good beer, nonetheless."
"Poured a clear auburn gold with great carbonation that leads to a solid head. A veggie-hop like smell, pils-like, with hints of sweet malt. Nice, clean, smooth, light; passes with a hoppy bitterness and some minor malty sweetness. Good finish to an alright beer."
"Drinkability is acceptable for the style, but not my preference to date."
"D: A really good bock which, while a little two-dimensional, is still really enjoyable, especially if you like malty brews."
"This is a great session beer even at 6%. Very simple, but highly refreshing and drinkable. Plus it is brewed right down the road from me, which rocks."
"A helles bock is probably my favorite lager style of beer,and this beer is everything I like in the style.Pours a clear lighter bronze color with a nice lacey,tight white head that settles slowly.Alcohol infused fruit,toasted grain,and a sharp spice comes through in the nose.Really nice flaovrs going on,somewhat sweet up front with some caramel and sweetish alcohol infused white grape flavors,melding into a crisp cracker-like finish.A decent amount of hops are used for the style and it gives it a nice finish.In my opinion easily Starr Hill's best brew,not overly heavy and or sweet,a good warming winter brew."
"Nice solid beer, easy beer to serve to non-beer nuts."
"pint at Taphouse on Queensway, Hampton, VA"
"Solid. Try it when you're in VA. I had it at the Taphouse in Hampton, VA and must say that this is a very good, what I would call Golden Ale, but I think it isn't an ale at all. Nice color with a great beer scent and just right on hops and malt. I would drink it more if it were available in Mississippi. Solid. Golden color, great aroma, and very good taste. Nice beer."
"Crisp, light to medium in body. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This beer doesn't try to be anything that it's not, and in so doing succeeds at being precisely what it is and then some. Right up there with the Pale Ale as being my favorite Starr Hill brew, this one's simply a well-crafted, malty, winter brew that I could easily toss back a sixer of around the fire with family or friends. Cheers Starr Hill."
