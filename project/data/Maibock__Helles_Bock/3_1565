3.61,1.7,3,3.25,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Interesting beer. It pours, smells and tastes a lot lighter than a high gravity 8% ABV doppelbock. In my opinion the style and labeling is misleading, but not necessarily in a bad way. It is still a very enjoyable beer. If I was blind folded and had no preconceived ideas I probably would have rated this beer higher. It was definitely a well crafted beer. I would never turn this beer down, but probably won't go out of my way to buy it again. Only because there are so many other beers to try. This one's not bad at all, but there's not much about it that makes it stand out either.","sremed60","Saturday at 06:44 AM"

3.64,2.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Clear golden orange with little precipitating carbonation.  Vigorous pour produces nice thick head with sticky lacing and nice clumpy head.  (Less vigorous pour leaves an anemic head with thin collar and scattered cap.)  Nose of sweet malts and vague fruit-like character.  Malt forward in the mouth with lightly tart hoppy finish.  Good in mouth; crispiness belies the lack of apparent carbonation.  Smooth and slightly chewy.  Is this a doppelbock?  Perhaps.  Whatever it is, it's certainly a fine beer though nothing incredible.  Would try again.","jettjon","Mar 06, 2015"

It smells fresh and fruity. It has a balanced mouth feel not thin and not thick, balanced and not bitter at all. This might be my first Helles Doppelbock, I'm impressed very nice and with an ABV of 8% it can bite ya. It is smooth and well balanced, hints of fruit and just a slight bitterness I must say. I do believe this is my first Abita beer and I am impressed and will try some more.","bleedsblu","Aug 30, 2014"

Pours a thick yellow straw color with a huge rocky head of white, dying down to a thin foam layer with excellent clinging lacing. Smells of fresh apples, pears, and sweet light malts. Excellent mouthfeel, well carbonated, with light caramel and slight bittering hops on the back. Not a lot of dimension, but not bad at all. I would compare it to a lot of the Russian beers, yet smoother and not as abrasive to the novice beer drinker. Also would love to have it side by side to the hop gator which I have had and liked a bit more. This beer at one time to my recollection was a ""barley wine"" by name sold in small Little Kings sized bottles (a bottle style many I know referred to as stop sign smashers). Still, a very nice beer indeed.","Brutaltruth","Jun 22, 2014"

There is an imbalance toward sweet flavors, but for such a high gravity this is expected for the style. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth.

3.68,3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 5/5/2013. Slight gusher upon opening. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apple, raisin, grape, biscuit, cracker, light pepper, herbal, and floral hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of fruity ester, bready malt, and hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of apple, pear, grape, biscuit, cracker, light pepper, herbal, grass, and floral hops. Lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, cracker, light pepper, herbal, and floral hops on the finish for a bit. Good balance of fruity ester, bready malt, and hop flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly slick, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good Helles Bock. Good balance of malt, hop, and fruity ester notes; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 07, 2013"

3.46,-2.5,2.75,3,3.5,4.25,3.75,"Pours a transparent straw color with a respectable white head that recedes to a level that just qualifies as full surface coverage. Aroma is mild, smelling of honey, hay, and a faint, tropical fruitiness. I have no idea what a Helles bock should taste like, but it's much milder than I expected. There's a gentle, bready, honeyed malt flavor with enough earthy, herbal hops to balance it out. Some pepper is evident as well. The aftertaste is slightly medicinal, but mostly dry. The hops become a bit more aggressive as it warms. I must say that the alcohol is adeptly concealed, as I never would have suspected its 8% ABV. Present, tingly carbonation lends a lively mouthfeel that complements the flavor profile nicely. Despite the highly generic presentation and mild aroma, this brew was a pleasant surprise, yielding a drinkable, balanced character that belies its weight. Not exactly my favorite style, but a pretty quality offering nonetheless.","MaximalC","Mar 26, 2013"

Poured a golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, corn, grain, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, floral, wheat, grain, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. I really wasn’t impressed with this one that much if I am honest. However, this was about the only thing that was listed on the menu that I had not had before while we were grabbing food after the Zwanze Day festivities. There was just too much of a spicy and wheat aspect going on here. The aroma kind of reminded me of an adjunct lager in a way with the corn aspect going on. Really glad it didn’t carry over. Still not that great unfortunately.","thagr81us","Dec 26, 2012"

Despite the lightness of it all, alcohol is incredibly subdued for 8%, but thankfully still discernible. But man, I could probably chug this down if I wanted to. Both due to the light, crisp flavour and the seemingly magically hidden alcohol content. This is not what I was expecting at all, but it's really quite good nonetheless. The only other thing I've encountered that claimed to be a ""Helles doppelbock"" was made by Samichlaus. That was 14% alcohol and a thick, sweet concoction. Amazing, of course, but in no way related to this. This is a totally different approach. I'm pretty sure I even taste wheat in this. This is far more on the Helles side, not so much on the doppelbock side, but in all the right ways. It's less bitter and a tad more sweet than most helles bocks and of course, it's got that doppelbock level of alcohol. Good stuff.","ElCommodoro","Aug 09, 2012"

Not too overpowering though. After the first taste I was very impressed. Floral, sweet, and smooth all the way to the end. There was a slight taste of hops left in the back of my throat.

Two fingers of foam that falls apart in less than a minute, no lacing left behind. Medium body with really nice carbonation, just a touch of stickiness to the body. Nice floral scent overlaid with mild generic fruit esters, some caramel malt appears in the nose once it gets good and warmed up to room temperature. Taste is semi-sweet, the generic esters on the nose come into focus as restrained pear tones garnished with herbal hopping notes.

Smell is of sweet malts and some citrus hops, seems inviting. Taste starts with light malts, some interesting sweet and fruit flavors. Hops come in toward the end to help finish the sip with a little bitterness. Mouthfeel was just a touch thick for my preferences.

Fruity, malty aromas, with light hints of grain. The beer has tangy, fruity flavors, with round, bold, malty notes and a grainy ending.

Vibrantly carbonated and gives huge head, that actually settles into a nice comforter like layer of foam, with decent lacing. I'm already impressed from what is usually a sub-par brewer. This is like Baroness' ""Blue Record", to continue that thought...Ouch, wtf am I drinking? Lots of cinnamon and other stuff, like coriander, right up front in the flavor. This is truly unique, no doubt about it...But is it good? Crazy stuff going on, and a hop bitterness I can't quite place which ends the beer both sharply and with a certain roundness. It's actually well-balanced, but so wacky are these flavors they clash with each other. Hmmm...I'd have to say it's a good beer just out of uniqueness, and I like the spciy flavors...Worth trying folks. Color me a very Baroness-level surprised...","SolomonGrundy","Sep 02, 2010"

Once I poured it and smelled it, the Andygaror was clearly not a dopplebock. The alcohol smell came through right away along with a strong and very unappealing grass odor. Carbonation was minimal. The taste was very unappealing: overly sweet and loaded with rice. An extremely sour aftertaste lasted for some time, and I continued to smell what seemed like old celery.

Kind of reminded me of Leffe Blonde. Head was super thick, lasted a good while, then to a thin lacing. Smell was malty up front with a slight fruit on the rear. Taste was big malt up front and slight tinge of fruit and alcohol on the finish. Again, the taste reminded me a lot of Leffe Blonde, rather than the dopples I'm used to.

Overall this didn't have as big or bold of a flavor as I was expecting. It was still pretty crisp and tasty, and had a nice fully body. It hid the alcohol well too, so it was pretty easy to drink. But it could definitely use more malty sweetness and overall flavor. As it is, this beer was pretty bland and forgettable.

A doppelbock, being a ""big"" lager, and this being a big helles-style, fits well enough. It is a bit boozy, not unexpected. The only real drawback I have is the slightly soapy aftertaste. Also, if you are having it alone, I suggest keeping it refrigerated between pours, as it doesn't exactly improve with warming (also not unexpected for what it is).

I should probably try the bottled version but I've never had a good enough experience with this on tap to even want to bother.

3.53,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think some of the dislike of this one comes from the confusion around which style it actually is. It's not a Doppelbock, that's for sure. I'd say it's a strong Maibock.

3.78,6.5,4,3.5,4,3,4,"This poured out to be quite a good looking beer, with pale golden body, three finger thick head, and excellent clarity. That being said, it looked nothing like a typical Dopplebock, but since it's a Helles version of it, I'd let that slide. The smell was sweet honey, banana, bubblegum. and aged Cheddar like hops, in other words, far more typical of a Belgian Pale Ale than a bock. The taste was delicate, sweet, and well balanced. I could detect fruits in the form of banana, pear, and pineapple, but they were mostly fleeting in nature. I was most surprised by the spicy and relatively aggressive hop character. This is something that one would not expect in a Dopplebock, much less in one from Abita. This was certainly not liquid bread for lent, but it was deliciously made, so I overlooked all the non traditional aspects of the taste. Light and runny on the palette, and not much heft to indicate the potency of this beer. If you can cope with something unexpected, and take it how effective it is versus what you expected it to be, this beer might do it for you.","rajendra82","Jan 12, 2009"

Off-putting. Taste is similar; sweetness that's really unmatched by anything else in the brew, making it fairly unbalanced. Grainy malt again, with some citric notes and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side, but not horrible. It's like all of the negative characteristics that one can find in a cheap lager have been cranked up to 11.

3.92,10.4,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Served to me as clear, orange-ish, with a 1-finger head. The smell was faint, but pleasant. I could get plenty of sweet smells, sugar and fruit. It almost smelled like apple juice. I found the the taste to be complex, but light on the tongue and subtle. There was definately the fruit and sugar, but it also had some floral and grassy hops and a slight presence of the malts. The beer finished with a tiny bitter buzz that still left the palate wet. Amazingly, even though the overall taste was quite subtle, I could taste no trace of alcohol in this 8% beverage: very impressive. The beer was well carbonated with a thin mouthfeel. Overall, I was quite pleased with this beer. It was refreshing, like drinking a tall, cool glass of well-flavored water. It was as thin and easy to drink as a session beer, but it quickly leaves you lightheaded.","micahgoldfus","Sep 19, 2007"

The nose is really the same in the flavor here, but the sweetness ended up being much worse than I had expected. The phenols or esters or whatever the hell was going on with this beer come out way too much also. Lots of medicinal alcohol. Mouthfeel is slick, syrupy, prickly, and tongue-coating.

Poured a amber-chestnut with nominal head. Mildly malty and nutty, with some sugary notes wafting in toward the end.

3.47,-2.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is listed on BA as a dopple, above the bar at the Abita Brewpub as a barleywine, and in the Abita Brewpub's menu as a ""continental malt liquor"". So really what is this? Served in a small chalice. The color is light golden, head is very small. The aroma is sweet and beery. Pretty much a richer version of the smell in a standard malt liquor. The taste is most reminiscent of a malt liquor, I really can't see this being classified as a barley wine or a dopplebock. A flavorful light malt taste is backed by subtle hops. A mild taste of alcohol is in the finish. Basically, I'd consider this a craft beer version of malt liquor. I'd drink this again, but Abita has plenty of beers I'd rather have.","Gagnonsux","May 01, 2004"
