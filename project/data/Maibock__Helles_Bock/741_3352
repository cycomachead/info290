3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2/10/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of orange zest, plum, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, plum, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, plum, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Maibock style. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 02, 2014"

3.47,0,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"a passable but incomplete maibock for me, i am left wanting for more carbonation and a quicker finishing experience, not as spring feeling as the style usually delivers either. caramel colored beer, rather still after a minute, sits lazily in a white wine glass. the nose is sweet from the grain, but a little stale too, not as fresh as it might be. no hops to speak of, and a lager yeast i have seen before. the flavor is a bit one dimensional for me, coppery caramel toffee flavor from the grain, and thats it. no german interest, no balancing hops, not even a drying bready yeast profile to wrap it up. not bad at all, devoid of off flavors or weirdness, but not as interesting or as tradition as i like these to be. the body is big enough for sure, but more bubbles would really help this out. one bottle is enough, especially given the only sort of disguised alcohol strength. not bad, but i wont miss not having it in my fridge anymore.","StonedTrippin","Apr 10, 2014"

The flavors were also well-balanced, a pleasant sweetness of caramel malt first hit my tongue that was soon met by some piney hops that led to a bitter, crisp finish.

This beer is just too sweet, and gets worse as it settles. There clearly is a citrus like sweetness here - green apple, maybe - with a tad bit of sourishness in the late finish.

The color is a lusterous amber/orange with a diminishing thumb thick white head. Quite pretty coloring.

By mid mouth, and certainly by the end of the glass, there's a good amount of buttery diacetyl going on, maybe too much for my tastes in that the hops could be spicier, more assertive, and the brew could be a little more dry for me. The esters from the aroma seem a little lost as well. Lakefront certainly explores the world of Lagers in interesting directions, for this style, its a little cloying.","ADR","Oct 02, 2004"

Flavors are nice, refined whole grain richness that has a toasty breadishness and buttery notions, not overly sweet or cloying in the malts, very solid malt display with some grassy openness floating around and a delicate dryness. Feel is significantly bold and malty rich, creamy, yet favorably carbonated and full of good zip.

Hundreds of tiny bubbles stream steadily upwards, helping to maintain a thin surface covering throughout the glass. The lacing is limited, but generous notes of rich, toasty and lightly husky Munich malt waft towards the nose. The body is firm, and the fine carbonation leaves it creamy in the mouth with a light sensation on the tongue. All of the rich maltiness displayed in the aroma is carried over in the flavor. It's rich without being sweet or cloying; and it's quite clean except for the fact that the straight-forward maltiness has a bit of a husky, hay-like character. Still, I enjoyed it and didn't see it as a negative. In fact, it lends some character to the beer and reminds the drinker that beer is an agricultural product (and in this case, from the epicenter of the grain belt... Milwaukee) - not something generically created and pumped into shiny metal cans in a sterile industrial setting (although that is sometimes true as well!). The alcohol is very well hidden, and never makes an appearance. I'm not sure how strong this beer is, but it's definitely within the Bock range. It finishes with a wash of sweetish and grainy malt across the mouth, but it's so deftly balanced that it simply fades away without the bitterness ever making an appearance. Very nice! There's some real finesse going on here! However, I can't figure out the name! Maybe there's some local connection that I don't get, but why is a beer from Milwaukee named ""Big Easy Lager Beer"" with a lobster in a Mardis Gras mask on the label? The only thing that I can think of is that it's a big malty beer that goes down easy... real easy! Quite enjoyable, and worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Mar 16, 2003"
