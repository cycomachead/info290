The addition of clover honey really imparts a lot of flavor and turns what would've been a fairly standard lager into something special. Its a very sweet beer so that may divide beer drinkers on this one. There are aspects to it, particularly the finish, that remind me of mead (an alcoholic drink of fermented honey & water, for the layman). I don't think I could drink a lot of this in one sitting but I would recommend giving it a try. Its not amazing or anything but I found it to be a tasty treat.","WolfsbaneBloom","Apr 17, 2013"

This is another one that poured with virtually zero head. Pours a golden pilsner type color, although a bit clouded. The nose is remniscent to their apple ale. It smells like crisp apples touched with honey. The first taste reminds me of much the same. More lightly tinged apple with a touch of honey. This would be a decent beer to have on a hot day. The mouthfeel is very light and delicate. The faintest taste of apples is left behind. All in all, this isn't too shabby. Nothing incredible. Nothing awful.

4.04,13.5,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly richer than pale golden color with a big fluffy white semi loose head that tightens up and becomes fluffy and beautiful and leaves some good lace on the glass. The initial aroma reminds me of the boiling beer on the stovetop when you make bratwurst, not a bad smell at all just not one you usually get from beer prior to bringing it to a boil. This gives way to a the dominant aroma which is bready baguette. All of this is accented with some nice but light floral notes. I really like the way this smells, it's aromatic but simple, it's subtle and clean but has some very definitive characteristics none the less. The flavor is also very clean and has some nice finesse The thing that catches me right away is that the beer is dry, far more dry than the typical product that advertises honey as a definitive ingredient to the beer. The flavor that the honey imparts is not likely sweetness as the bit of that that's in here seems to be covered pretty well by the malt as opposed to any adjunct. There is some spiciness and richness that reminds me a little bit of good honey, but I will admit that if it didn't say honey on the bottle it is not very likely that I would have picked on on much honey flavor. Which is of course ironic because honey flavor seems to be a very definitive characteristic to many pale/heller/mai bock beers. Beyond this whole honey bit there is a nicely subtle hop zing mainly in the herbal vein. The bready maltiness is just slightly toasty and there is just a slight hint of cereal in there as well. This is a damn well balanced & wonderfully crafted lager, the likes of which are some of the most exciting beers that New Glarus makes. The palate is just lightly sharp and the beer is fabulously easy to drink, as evidenced by the fact that as I write this I am finishing the bottle, as opposed to the Barley Wines I have this many notes for after about two oz. I would happily drink pint after pint of this beer.","BieresDesMoines","Dec 20, 2010"

People who drink mass produced lagers aren't going to buy this at the price anyway. NG's market is with people who roam this site. I hope things improve throughout the year. Best of luck Dan.","Wisconsin","Feb 03, 2010"
3.16,-11.2,4,3,3,4,3,"D - I would have guessed this was an adjunct lager from one of the big brewers with a touch of honey added. Not what I was expecting.","brewcrew76","Feb 02, 2010"
2.92,-18,4,2,2.5,3,4.5,"I really had high expectation for this beer given the original description, but I feel it falls so short and disappoints. I see this beer as the winter version of 'Totally Naked' and a direct competitor to 'Honeyweiss'. This is the full bodied "winter"equivalent of that beer, and while I see it will please the people who this is targeted to, I find it a travesty that beers such as 'Uff-da bock', 'Black Wheat', 'Coffee Stout' and 'Hop Hearty' had to be shelved to make room for this. Why not just make 'Totally Naked' all year round? It feels like a brewery I know can make some of the best beers I have ever had, is now catering to the least common denominator in order to pay for the new brewery. I really hope the rest of the new beers being introduced this year are not a dumbed down version of styles BA's know New Glarus can hit a home run in if they wanted.","weatherdog","Feb 01, 2010"
3.05,-14.3,2.5,2.5,3,3,4,"In summary, NG used more expensive ingredients and a more intensive brewing process but failed to produce anything that is better than a crappy macro.","PrinceDarren","Jan 31, 2010"
3.25,-8.7,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Looks really like a clear honey, with a light creme tan head, really tastes like a macro with maybe a hint of honey man this a llight and...to put it blunt a pretty crappy bock. Don't get me wrong it's probably what NG was going for some weak beer that spotted cow people would drink. But I need more flavor.","minnunderground","Jan 30, 2010"
3.63,2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: I can see the reason that this won't be rated very high--it isn't boisterous with enormous flavours, it is subtle and very easy to drink--Not something I am likely to pick up again, but a nice sessionable beer from New Glarus.","darklordlager","Jan 28, 2010"
3.19,-10.4,4,2.5,3,3.5,4,"D - Cabin Fever is an average beer with decent drinkability. It's nothing to be proud of but certainly nothing to be ashamed of. I'd have it over Spotted Cow as a session beer.","BeerFMAndy","Jan 27, 2010"
4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D: Exceedingly refreshing! We really enjoyed the subtleties of the natural honey throughout this.","GbVDave","Jan 27, 2010"
2.85,-19.9,3,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours a deep golden yellow with a bright white head that goes away quickly. Lots of carbonation with no lacing to speak of. Smell is sweet malts and honey with a touch of floral. Really not much to get excited about. It's a sweet beer with the honey and malts. Some grainy corn shows up. Very little hop bitterness. Pretty boring. I was expecting something with much more of a complex flavor. It doesn't have any bad or off flavors, but it doesn't anything great to offer either. They could call this a pale lager and make it a summer seasonal and not miss a beat. It's still ten degrees outside, I need something bigger.","lester619","Jan 26, 2010"
2.65,-25.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I'll give this another go sometime, hoping that, right now, either it's off or I am. My present opinion is that it's the worst thing New Glarus has even released.","cokes","Jan 22, 2010"
3.3,-7.3,3,3,3,3,4.5,"Cabin Fever is not overwhelming in any sense of the word. In fact "craft-brewed macro" might be an appropriate term for this beer. It has all the hallmarks of a macro brew, which sadly isn't my thing. However, it is quite crisp and refreshing, with a light-medium body making it quite sessionable. I'm surprised this beer rounds out at 6% ABV. It drinks like a 4% ABV beer.","Soneast","Jan 21, 2010"
3.03,-14.9,3,2.5,3,2.5,4,"The feel is super light, but decent drinkability.","jrallen34","Jan 21, 2010"
2.6,-27,3,3,2,3,3,"UPDATE: 1/29/10 I distributed this beer to 3 of my beer loving/ judging friends and I've recieved back 2 dissappointing reviews, while the 3rd has yet to try the beer. If I were to review this in the summer months I might give it a solid C rating, but the release time on this one isn't feeling correct to me. I do love most of the NG beers and eagerly await new releases...","RJUGA03","Jan 21, 2010"
3.93,10.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall a super drinkable beer. Not thay this is a surprise considering the source. Keep'em coming NG.","beerwolf77","Jan 20, 2010"
4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"pours a nice golden tan color with a great fresh head and sticky lacing till the end it looks good and fresh with a pure white ring..the smell is malts and fresh baked bread followed by some floral hops a pleasant springlike clover smell..the taste is malts first and in a good way followed by the floral hops it finishes crisp and clean and a little sweet..its highly drinkable,,very flavorful ..another fine bock from NG that is well balanced with malts and hops and honey nothing overwhelms in this one...recommended","gatornation","Jan 17, 2010"
3.93,10.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall a very tasty beer that is very drinkable and has a decent amount of flavor and body. The only downfall is the sweetness and low hop flavor. I am accustomed to a bit more in a maibock, but a good beer all the same. Sadly, this is not the stunner I was expecting to replace Hop Hearty, but it will do for now until I run out.","wheatyweiss","Jan 15, 2010"
