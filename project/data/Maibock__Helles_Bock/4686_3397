3.74,-3.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a green bottle (!) into an Oktoberfest mug. This lager is an orange-amber color with some off-white to tan foam. Smells exceeding malty, with caramel, toasty, and nutty elements. Body fairly heavy and this brew is quite sweet with a moderate degree of carbonation. Taste is very malt-forward, with caramel and bread crust flavors combining with the buttery mouthfeel to yield a waffles and dark syrup effect, quintessential German malt. There is also a fermented honey sweetness and the hops are more assertive than expected, herbal and minty. I'd rate the flavor higher were it not for traces of a metallic skunked flavor due to the packaging. I feel fortunate though ... This example must have been protected quite well from light, as the skunk was a minor nuisance than did not ruin the entire experience. I can imagine than this would be sublime on tap. Shitty to put such a great malt showcase in a green bottle. Bad call probably based on marketing but do not be dissuaded from trying this if you are a fan of classic German sweet malts. The malts are plenty assertive but the hops also get their licks in ... Well done.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 03, 2014"

Sweet caramel and honey notes on the nose with a touch of herbal, earthy, noble hops. The taste is on the sweeter side, with rich caramel, honey and toffee notes followed with an earthy, herbal, grassy hop back bite. Very well balanced. My favorite of the Hofbrrau family I tried.

3.63,-6.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Served in a Flute glass. Pours a nice light amber color with about an inch of nice foamy white head that dissipates rapidly for the most part. The beer is mostly transparent with a slight cloudiness and a very large amount carbonation bubbles which can be seen bubbling through the beer from the bottom up. These carbonation bubbles help to maintain the small amount of head that lingers at the top of the brew. There is very little lacing (residual foam left on the glass) with this beer, which, as I understand it is typical of the style. The beer has a very nice overall scent of a nice sweetness, possibly similar to dark fruits, and a very slight molasses note. This brew has a very pleasant taste with an initial underlying sweetness similar to grapes and a nice deep malty finish that lingers on the back of the palate. The Hofbrau Maibock, although it is 7.2%, seems to have absolutely no alcohol burn which really makes it easy to drink. The deepness of the brew really helps the overall taste, but does hurt how easily it drinks.

Musty nose brings forth butterscotch, fresh grains, brown bread, and something almost egg like. Taste is full of flavors such as white cake, herbs and floral notes, more fresh grain etc. The mouthfeel is much lighter than I would have expected, which jacks up the drinkability by a notch or two.

Alcohol flavour and warmth linger in the finish. Medium bodied with carbonation that was on the creamy side. Light dryness, but with a slightly slick texture.

A nutty melanoiding flavor is present, with just enough alcohol and background hop bitterness to keep the finish on the dry side.

Good balance in flavor, rich, semi sweet malts right away coat and linger in the mouth a brighting hop bite appears just before the finish and hangs out long into the aftertaste. Toffee, a little nutty and a small hint of chocolate, good malt structure here no doubt. This is by far the best bottled beer ive had to date from Hofbräu.

The smell is malty sweet, slight fruitiness and obvious skunking (which I had expected from above). The taste is very much the same, malty backbone - slightly toasted, very skunked and no perceivable hop flavor but there is some perceived bitterness. The mouthfeel is light in body with a minimal amount of mouth-tingling carbonation. Drinkability is still relatively decent because of the light mouthfeel and low carbonation but that doesn't make it desirable. I would love to try this a little fresher, I'm sure it's much MUCH better. Also, for 7.2% it's not really very noticeable - even in full skunk form.","gmfessen","Mar 01, 2008"

In my broken German I asked if the bock beer was the Maibock. The server told me it was pretty much the same beer as the Maibock. Accordingly, I will go ahead and review this beer as the Maibock. This brew was incredible! It had all of the ""German maltiness"" you would expect in a German bock beer. It was soooo drinkable, it was crazy.

My only gripe here is that it's hard to get a good head on the beer, although that didn't detract a lot from my rating. Smells ranged from fruity to floral, which matched the ""spring"" characteristics this beer is supposed to have. And they're right, this beer fits right in for drinking in May - I had this relaxing on a late spring day in hot Florida, and it really hit the spot. The real draw here is the taste, which was really good in my opinion. Some people have likened the taste to warm bread, which I tend to disagree with, although I guess I can see where they get it from. There is some bread in the taste, but it was a bit sweeter than I expected. It hits your mouth with an interesting richness and just slides down your throat, leaving a nice sweet aftertaste. The beer is incredibly drinkable, but the alcohol content will slow you down a bit. I had 3 in one sitting, and was really feeling it after, but in a really good way... I'll recommend this beer for anyone looking to unwind after a long hot day, but I'm not sure I'll pick it up again anytime soon, especially out of season.","BucBasil","May 19, 2007"

Smell had some mild floral aroma. Taste had some slight bitterness to it. Taste reminded me of Genesee, but in a good way. That is not a bust on this beer but a complement. I think it has something to do with the carbonation. Had a medium body feel and some dryness. Drinkability was pretty good, but not great. Overall a very good beer that I would recommend.","jhu1995","Apr 28, 2006"
3.95,1.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Half liter bottle. Pours a soid ambered dark tea brown color . A finger of off-white head falls to a healthy coat over top. Clarity is excellent and a moderate cascade of bubbles keeps the head maintained. Nose is nicely rounded with melanoidan toastyness with very light hints of raisin and a very light butteryness. Flavor is definately more raisiney than the nose. Toasty notes are there, but hidden well behind the raisin. There is almost a bit to the fruityness that takes a little away from this one. There is also a touch of metallic on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the light end of moderate with a light carbonation that matches well. This is an okay beer. I think it is a little too fruity and not enouth of the toastyness. Fruityness is more in line with one of the bigger members of the bock family. That being said, its tasty and is worth a look. Enjoyable spring brew.","kmpitz2","Apr 27, 2006"

I am getting all kinds of hidden flavors here, I suspect my mind is recalling previous tastes; I have to thank this beer for being so evocative. This is a pleasurable, lighter alternative to a doppel, may even be a neat substitute for your basic bitter or pale ale.
