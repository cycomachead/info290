"Had a pint at the Old Engine Room in Mystic, CT. Wonderful sweetness balanced by some bitter grassy hops. What a pleasant herbal aroma that is perfectly matched in the taste. This has got to be one of the best low-cost beers available! Matches with damn near any appetizer or entree. Try it!"
""
""
"O: Its ok, maybe I don't like the style but this is one I wont revisit."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid dark lager that should appeal to fans of a straight-up bock. It's accessible without being boring, and is definitely priced fairly (usually $9-$10 for six tallboys). I like this more than Narragansett's original lager, which I like. Would drink again."
""
"O: Surprisingly good. It lacks some qualities, but this is a good beer for both you and your dad. Enough ""oomph"" for the craft beer drinker and plain enough for the casual beer drinker. Plus, it come in 16 oz. pounders and those are incredible."
""
"Goes down easy and does give a taste of spring during this thaw."
"low price cans"

"This was a nice find and my first beer I've had in Maine. It was warming and very tasty with a good malt sweetness and body, all nicely complimented with a well-balanced hop presence. It was worth the two cans I had to wash down my lobster-stuffed haddock at Warren's Lobster Restaurant in Kittering, Maine. Ah, but this would be an excellent lager on its own merits!"

"The taste has a semi-sweet grainy and caramel malty note with a solid bitterness tagging itself onto the end. The bitterness was what impressed me the most because it felt so well balanced."

"Just saw this one today at my local bottle shop. Poured into a Smithwicks Draught mug and was rewarded with a nice off white collar of rocky foam about 3 fingers high sitting over clear medium amber/gold beer. I get sweet malt, a nutty, and grassy note, fragrant and flowery yet subtle hoppiness in the nose. Average mouthfeel. Superbly balanced, neither very sweet or very bitter...layer of malt backing gives way to the hop bitterness, just enough to let you know it's there but not the dominant flavor. Finishes flowery-bitter with a biscuity flourish. Very nice take on the Bock style and well worth the effort to find it. Love the can graphics too. See it? Buy it!"
"Another solid offering from this brewery. Never had a canned bock beer before, and in spite of the metallic notes in the aroma, this is a rustic, raw, and satisfying take on the style and quite easy to drink even with its strong malt focus. For a style I barely drink, I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"notes: unbelievably tasty. I'm going back to the store tonight for more."
""
"It was difficult to find this beer. Excellent New England beer and rebrewing of a classic."

"Overall: I am not too familiar with maibocks, but this is a good start. Very impressed with this canned beer from Gansett. Good stuff."
""
"Found this at a beverage store just off Monument Square in Portland, ME. The beer pours a crisp, clear amber color with lots of reddish notes. There is very little foam and minimal lacing. The nose is roasty malts and lots of warm bready, very nice example of the style. The flavor mirrors the nose in lots of roasty malt and bready goodness. This is a wonderful beer for the price and a not so common style. Big props to Narragansett for making a very nice example."
""
"I'm a bit disappointed in this beer. It has promise as most of the traditional bock characteristics are present, but it has some off notes that detract terribly from the overall flavor. It's still drinkable even if I am a bit distracted. I will probably avoid this in the future."
""
"Overall I was not expecting such a flavorful and easy drinking beer. Certainly want to pick up some more of these. Would recommend it to any bock fan."
""
""
"Overall, this is decent fare, and for the price and size, not to mention the 6.5% ABV, good value. It’s also very drinkable and smooth, with nice layers of grains and sugars. In the end, however, it’s rather light, coming across not as watery, but simply weak, the flavors fading out quickly over the course of even a few sips. This is not to say that it’s bad beer, but that a few more handfuls of grains in the mash would have certainly gone over well."
""
""
"overall a fantastic beer that is lite but still very soft and complex in flavor. Gansett just nails it every year with this one"
""
""
"Just attempted to drink a can of this stuff and I could not do it. Had a harshness to it and a good bit of diacetyl. Metallic as well. Bleh!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft, sweet bready malts up front. Light toasted edge. Honey malt sweetness fills in with notes of cereal grains and light fruitiness. Spicy hop flavor early on disappears mid-palate, but then peppery hop bitterness returns for the finish. Slightly floral and perfume-y. Lingering honey. Medium bodied with a creamy, nicely carbonated feel."
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. When you consider the price and ABV, it is a must try in-case you are looking for another beer for those kind of weekends/family gatherings/whatever."
""

""
""
"I am usually pretty satisifed with Naragansett but they missed the mark with this beer. Doesn't really resemble a helles bock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Narragansett Bock pours an amber color with a thick beige head from a sixteen ounce tall boy can. The aroma is bready and malty, which is quite pleasant. A fair amount of hop bitterness hits me up front when I take my first sip. There is a nice malty backbone. There is nice lacing as the head collapses. Quite drinkable if not my favorite example of the style."
"Medium full body with middle of the road effervescence. Somewhat warming. Pretty smooth, too. I'd have again, despite the can though the porter is better."
"Pours a dark rusty amber with a small tan head atop. Nose is rich with syrup, faint molasses, and just a wallop of toasted malts. Great moderately-thick body. Not too rich, but nowhere near thin. Carbonation spot on. Tasty, chewy, sweet malts abound. Caramel, nuts, bread. Just an awesome beer here, and a great Bock for sure. This is one I will be sure to restock each and every spring."
""
""
"Poured from the can into a stemmed glass. Dark orange colored body, plenty of carbonation, and a thick head. A promising start. There is a bit of sweetness to the aroma. Then it all goes downhill from here. Flavor was pretty mediocre. Malty, with nothing else showing. The mouthfeel on this beer is nasty. Sticky and medicine-like. Leaves a gross vegetable flavor on my palate that I cannot remove. Not a pleasure at all to drink. Struggled with finishing just half a can. Not good."
"O: This is a very good representation of the style that is relatively easy to drink despite being a little fuller-bodied."
"O This is very good example of the style and a very enjoyable beer. I found the beer to be quite delicious and definitely a great value. I would definitely get this one again."
""
""
"O: This beer will surprise you pleasantly! Its good to see 'Gansett branching out into some legit craft beer! This is not anything like picking up a Genny ""Bock"" beer, as this one genuinely reflects the style, and has a lot of complexity and flavor packed into a simple package. Keep it up!"
""
"Poured from a tallboy into a stemmed pilsner glass, the beer is a crystal clear, amber-tinted copper coloring with a thin, foamy, bubbly off-white head that clings to the glass as it settles. Aromas of sugary sweet malt, toasted grains, and a tangy, nutty sweet highlight. Flavors are rich and robust, with a strong caramel and toffee malt presence throughout, giving rise to a roasted and slightly peppery undertone. The aftertaste is sweet, and slightly cloying, with a slightly boozey and nutty highlight. The finish is surprisingly clean with all of the sweet characteristics throughout the palate. Decent Bock."
"Not bad, an enjoyable spring bock, I wish the sweetness was balanced with more crispness or hops. As usual for Narragansett, good price for a 6-pack of tallboys ($9 I believe)."
"Overall: This is food in a can. I was hungry, now I am satisfied. Nourish me."
""
"Not too bad for a Helles. The body was more full with a solid flavor throughout that doesnt seem watered down."
""
""
"Lots of flavor with this, especially hop oils and citrus. Surprising bitterness for the style but it's welcome. The texture is a plus as well, with a light, creamy mouthfeel that fits the flavor well. The creaminess doesn't surprise me since the 'gansett lager has the same quality but it really just gels here with the stronger hop flavor. It doesn't taste like a maibock to me, but I definitely like it."
""
""
"I like the aroma, but the flavor is middling (though inoffensive). I would politely drink this when offered, but nothing I'd pick up again."
""
"Mouthfeel has a pronounced creaminess to it, quite nice."
""
"Another nice seasonal from gansett. Get some while ou can."
"Overall, this is really a much better beer than I was expecting and definitely a good bock."
"O: Bought this with the intention of it being a session beer, but it's a bit to heavy to be employed as such again. Very tasty beer nonetheless and quite reasonably priced to boot."
""
"Notes: Very solid and very drinkable. Cheers."
""
"Overall, wow, a great beer that I was impresed by, just a solid bock style, great caramel flavors with just enough hopiness to bring it back in balance"
""
""
""
"Respectable ABV for the money and would be welcome addition to any BBQ, poker night or game day festivity."
""
"Pay attention to this brewery."
""
"Serious drinkers take note, this is a bargain. Delicate palettes, look elsewhere (Celebrator for instance) but you can't match this much flavor for this much dollar."
"First off for my money the line of Narragansett beer are the best bang for their buck out there,six top notch 16oz cans of a good maibock for I paid can't be beat.Poured into a half liter stein a rich copper/bronze with a large billowing white head,just a great crown that settles into a creamy mass after a short time.Doughy with caramel notes in the nose,real defined sharp leafy hops really play a role as well.Caramel and tosted pizza crust flavors with a tinge anise meld into a quite a leafy hopped up finish.The drinkability of this spring bock is off the charts,I have paid as much if not more for a few beers of the same style that don't hold up to this,a great beer."
""
"At first sip, and all the way through, I received a very off, skunky tasted. In two attempts, I could not finish the 16 oz. can. I enjoy the porter far more."
"Overall- I like this beer. It certainly exceed my expectations coming out of a tall boy can. It also exceeded by expectations given previous negative experiences with bocks. A beer as malt forward as this could, and many do, turn almost cough medicine tasting, but they do a nice job of letting the malt be the star without giving a syrupy sensation. This is a very successful beer, and in fact one I would encourage because it is good and because it breaks a lot of stereotypes."
""
""
"O: Another good value from Narragansett."
"Overall impression. I bought a six pack of these on a whim, and they sat in my fridge for 2 weeks. My wife (not a big beer drinker) tried one and declared she liked it so I had to try one. I loved it. Due to its price point, the 16 oz cans, and taste, this beer is finding a spot in my regular rotation."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall quite interesting, very enjoyable brew."
""
"an excellent bock, which happens to be one of my favorite styles. this one tends to lean in the Helles direction and isn't as sweet as the dopplebock-like bocks out there. gotta love what narragansett is doing....makes me proud as a new englander...even if they're canned in Rochester NY."
"O - A fairly one dimensional beer, which is both a negative and a positive. Its simple, clean and has a pleasant flavor profile. This makes for a very drinkable beer. I'd take a sixer of this over their standard lager any day."
""
"Overall- 4.0 I love that Narragansett serves these crafted styles in their popular 16oz size can and prices them very fairly. Perfect for the person with a rich mans taste and a poor mans wallet."
""
"Smelled sweet and biscuity. Well balanced with just enough flavor and alcohol to keep things interesting. Went down so well I think I'll have another. Narragansett doesn't dissappoint."
""
"O: I think I anticipate this beer more than any other seasonal. For less than 10 dollars for a six pack of tall boys this beer is ridiculous. It is just loaded with malt flavor and has a surprising bitterness to even it out."
"16oz can from Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a crystal clear amber with a good half inch or so of khaki-colored head. sweet fruity and caramel malt wafts from the beer. Bread, biscuit, and caramel comprise the majority of the flavor with just a hint of hops. Medium in body and carbonation. A good solid bock, especially for the price. Awesome."
""
""
"O: Impressive offering here. Yet another solid seasonal from Narragansett. One of the better representations of the style and a point for being very affordable and in a pint can. Probably thier most complex beer in terms of flavor and feel, and a very nice spring time sipper."
"quite a nice version of the style. very much the same as just about everything else narragansett makes, in the respect that it's not going to knock your socks off, but is a damn solid, well put together brew, that's got a great quality to price ratio."
"Overall this is a fine beer. It's my second from Narragansett and I'm impressed so far with the quality versus price of these brews. Is this world-class? No, but it's a solid choice."
""
""
"I like porter/summer better tho."
""
""
"O: Another nice surprise from Narragansett. I've had 3 of their seasonals so far (missing the summer), and they've all been a good-great representation of their respective styles. The bock is no different, and is very easy to drink"

"A decent example of the style that should hook mainstream drinkers. I'm hoping for a stout from Narragansett to complete their seasonal lineup. Otherwise, check this out if bocks are your forte!"
"Another surprise from Narragansett firs the porter now this. The beer pours A orangey yellow color with a decent head and good retention. The smell is sweet malts with a hint of hops. This beer is sweet medium bodied and very smooth an excellent maibock."
"O/D: It's a solid Bock, the old recipe was more complex, but I'll settle for this in tallboys."
"Thanks to Eddie for bringing me a six pack of this from trader Joes in the NY area last weekend as this one does not make pa yet!"
"I have to admit that I drank a lot of these this spring. It wasn't a breathtaking beer, but it was very good. It's a tasty bock that is excellent with food."
"The taste is mild and malty and the mouthfeel is very soft and creamy. Bready is how I would describe the taste. The finish is clean with little aftertaste. This isn't my preferred style of beer, but this is obviously well-made. Recommended."
"O: Goes down easy, pretty tasty, somewhat filling, mild kick, decent representation of style."
"Rich golden in color with amazing clarity. Nice fine carbonation seemed to be leaking toward the surface throughout the session and really get a nice high head of white going from the very start. Aroma is full of bready grains, popcorn like aromas with hints of grasses and herbal hops. Well rounded, clean, concise. Just what you would expect from SN. As I take the first sip, clean, crisp flavor washes over the tongue. Rich notes of caramel, almost clove like spice and loads of grainy grasses wash over the tongue. Quick hitting as the flavor rolls on by a nice long, buttery like finish dries the palate and leaves you looking for another sip almost immediatly."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice quick/foamy one-finger plus white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some slight bananna note, and caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, a slight bananna note, and caramel. Medium Body. A nice brew, glad to have gotten a chance to try it."
"This is a mighty fine example of a Maibock. It sure does got a purdy mouth."
"D/O - Every seperate aspect of the beer really comes together as a whole here. You get the impression that the folks at Narragansett set out to create something specific in this style and managed to achieve it. Very refreshing all the way around. Will be drinking more. Will in fact be having to stock up on what I can still get before what is left is gone and the summer ale takes over! O, and did I mention? Tallboys."
"This is one of the best maibocks I've had and just an excellent beer. The fact that it comes in tallboys and sells so cheaply only makes it better. I wish I bought a case because the 2 6 packs were so enjoyable. Very well done; a great spring beer."
"D/O - Great drinkability. This was a very nice bock, would gladly drink more!"
"From a 16 oz. green can with no freshness date. Brewed with pilsner, light and dark Munich, and wheat malt; hopped to 32 IBUs with Northern Brewer and Hallertau. The beer is crystal-clear, somewhere between gold and amber, with medium carbonation and a fluffy tan head that is easily teased above the rim and leaves a bit of lacing. Smells very ""lagery"" - clean and malty, with a dash of hops and distinct yeast. Quite malty on the palate, grainy and lightly sweet, with notes of biscuits, fresh bread and a bit of husk. Full-bodied as well, dry and crisp, with some apple esters, light hops and a dash of alcohol that leads into a malty finish. This is a very approachable beer that is solidly in the hellesbock profile. It's easy-drinking, pleasant, affordable and somewhat local to Boston. Well-worth picking this one up - it could be a nice alternative to your standard lawnmower beer this summer."
"Overall this beer was very close to being a very good bock, it was just the tiny bit of sweetness that overdid it for me. Still, a solid beer for the style that’s worth a shot."
"There is nothing like the audible Crack followed by the Glug to brighten my day! This time, it resulted in two fingers of thick, fluffy eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a malty sweetness underlain by a sharp peppery scent. Mouthfeel was full, not quite creamy, but close. I let a mouthful just roll around on my tongue, getting an initial caramel sweetness from it, followed by some black pepper, probably from the yeast strain. Finish was clean, as advertised, with a literally breathtaking dryness. Another winnah from the Ocean State! It might be a little big to take to the beach in the cooler, but it CAN definitely have some space in my cooler."
"Overall - It was ok at best. The aftertaste really killed it for me. A stronger flavor and I could have forgiven it, but not my favorite bock by any means."
"Many thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very malty, a bit on the sweet side. Taste is malts up front, a touch of caramel, the hops kicking in at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Full bodied as would be expected. There is a light sweetness, but the finish has a good hop bitterness. Well-balanced."
"Would I buy more of it? - I would. A six-pack of 16 oz. cans is going for about $8 here in New England. Very affordable for a quality brew. Narragansett has done very well with all of their seasonal canned releases thus far."
"This is an easy drinking beer that's fairly well balanced. Can be enjoyed any time of the year and especially with dinner. It's a nice malt alternative to all the hoppy beers out on the market today."
"This is an excellent mild beer. Pours a clear orange/copper body with a thick ecru head, leaves some lacing. Smells like fresh raw dough, very mild malts and a subtle herbal malt. The taste is very bread, very mild and those hops are still subtle. I can see a lack of appreciation for the style, but I'll drink lots of this. Nice bock!"
"Overall: In the cans I got, the hops actually came through a bit too much. This one is a one and done for me. I wanted a bit more balance. This almost tasted more like an English pale ale."
"Tallboy served in a pilsener glass. Pours a translucent copper with a slightly golden hue and a rocky, three inch cream-colored head that exposes dense, concentric rings of lacing as it slowly dissipates. Nose expresses candied, fruity esters, a faint herbal or grassy quality and a trace of noble hops towards the back. Taste is less sweet than suggested by the nose - a slightly spicy character intersperses itself throughout the flavor profile, along a light malty backbone, culminating in a residual earthy hops finish. Mouthfeel is light with a lively carbonation and a slightly oily quality. Definitely one of my favorite Bock beers and you can't beat the price at $7.99 a sixer. A great spring seasonal."
"I'm glad I got to try this beer. Its a very good example of the style and a very sessional beer. Goes down very smoothly."
"O - a good example of the style."
"Overall: Exceedingly drinkable, not as sweet up front (perhaps a tad more hops?) but still very well balanced and sessionable. Not feeling the 6.5 ABV as much as last time, maybe drinking beer with dinner is why. I STILL love this beer and I've told that to anyone who'd listen."
"Lime green 16oz can. Pours a translucent golden color with a 1/2 inch of head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of honey, spices, bread, and a bit of cut grass. Earthy. Flavor has a nice mix of hops and malts. More of those bread and honey flavors. Malty, earthy aftertaste. A bit thin mouthfeel wise but still tasty. Overall once again 'Gansett has made another solid brew in a tall boy. I hope they continue to make new styles. Worth buying again."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to pound down for a long time."
"If you're looking for a beer that throws its weight around a little more than your typical spring seasonal, this is it. I'll have to wait for a longer session to see if it carries the same hangover problems I had with the porter, but this is a vast improvement over the original Narragansett Bock."
"very easy to drink with a not to sweet or hoppy balance and at a very good price"
"O - An outstanding spring seasonal from the brewers at Narragansett. A wonderful beer for such a good price, this one is a no brainer."
"Taste is sweet to start, with a peek of fruitiness in the middle that promptly gives way to moderate hoppy bitterness and a clean close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is great. Good stuff."
"This is a really good Bock. I love lagers and this is a great variation of the style. The beer is lacking in the smell category; A weak, sweet smell is all I'm getting from this beer. The taste and mouth feel, However, is exactly what I expect from a Bock. It's a bit on the sweet side but it's crisp and clean. It has a slightly spicy finish that lingers long on the tongue. The mouth feel is rich and creamy, which I like. This beer is very drinkable and will be nice when the weather finally warms up. I hope they continue to put it out well into the summer."
"Oh and the foam lasts throughout the session. Well done, brewery in Rochester NY."
"D- High, this is a great beer. The taste is great and the price is even better. I could drink these all day."
"D: Very clean, smooth, slightly creamy, well-balanced and dangerously drinkable at 6.5% ABV. Didn't notice this brew sneak up on me until the bottom of the can, but it's deceptively potent and flavorful enough to mask the alcohol with clean malt spices and hops. Gansett Lager is a standby, Fest impressed, but this Bock took it to a whole new level. What a great value spring beer; Hi Neighbor!"
"Just a great bier and a terrific surprise. A quality example of a maibock. Good flavor, right amount of hops, crisp taste, and a strong beer with no overpowering alcohol taste. Well done. This has got to be brewed by either trinity or cottrell. Delicious and well done example, this coming from a guy with some years living in Deustchland."
"One pint easily goes down on a moderately warm (50 degrees) spring day. Alcohol concealed and its basic enough where drinking it isn't a complication. Good job, 'Gansett!"
"O/D-Easy drinker. ABV hidden well; drinks like a 4% beer. I paid a considerable amount more for a 6-pack of pounders than I would have if I had bought the lager. That being said, I won't be buying it as much because of the price jack. Nevertheless, I find most spring seasonals to be pretty lame. This one is quite good. Gansett is a great company, and this one is evidence. A 6-pack of this would be ideal for a warmer spring day."
"This is definitely one of the better beer values ($6.50 a 16 oz.sixer, no less) in the New England area."
"This is going to be really nice on a hot day - clean drinker that leave no unpleasant aftertaste."
"I gotta say this may be one of Narragansett's best beers since the light and easily the best of the seasonals. Not a blow you away pure traditional German bock in any way, but damn, for $5 a 16oz can six pack, this is an amazing beer. True to the style still, but in a mildly macro lager sort of way. I know I said this with other Narragnsett's, but this is what cheap beer probably tasted like before prohibition. And I mean that in a complimentary way. I could easily drink this all day."
"The body is light and crisp with good carbonation. Overall a great canned seasonal. If any beer encompasses the flavor of spring it's definiatley this one. I will be grabbing more of these."
"Pretty decent beer. :)"
"D - Quite drinkable. Narragansett continues to pump out great seasonal beers. Very shocked by this, and pleasantly surprised."
"Narragansett Bock will find it's way to my frig."
"I do give two Schlitz for Narragansett Bock. If this were available year-round in Michigan it would be a permanent Schlitz replacement in my fridge."
"Drinkablilty: My favorite of the Narragansett seasonals - very easy to drink. This beer will be perfect for when the weather warms up."
"While this is no daringly exteme beer it is a well done example of the style and worth trying."
"Wow ... I'll be hunting for cases very soon. One of the best spring seasonals I have run into in years."
