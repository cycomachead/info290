"Just does not quite taste like a beer I'd buy again"
""
"Started to taste better when it warmed up"
"Enjoyed from the 12 oz bottle.  This bock pours a clear bright orange with a thin, quickly dissipating white head that leaves little lacing.  Nose of light bread, caramel malts, nuts, grains, and sweet malts.  flavors follow the nose with sweet breaded malts notes up front and on the sides, a nutty character blends with light breaded malts as well as a moderate grain flavor.  Lightly sweet aftertaste mixed with a grain note.  Moderate alcohol in the finish.  Smooth and wet, lightly dry on the finish.  A decent bock."
""
"Somewhat watery, this was very malt forward, as expected. Decent beer, nothing excellent"
""
"AT. Finish is very crisp, clean and just a little dry. Body is full, very smooth, crisp, semi refreshing, well carbonated."
""
""
"Tasty and easy to drink despite sporting a higher ABV than most other Bock beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit too sweet for my taste.  Might be better when washing down some oysters down in NO but not for a night on the tundra."
"Nothing special really. It represents the bock style well but doesn't bring anything new to the table."
""
"Lite auburn draft with thin off white head. Not much nose, maybe a little caramel. Dry with a little caramel. Dry, lite mouthfeel. Enjoyable overall."
"The feel is very light, bubbly and at times sharp but it is actually served better a touch warm."
""
""
""
"Very drinkable beer very smooth. Make this your Mardi Gras Beer. From the great folks at Abita!!"

"The description says similar to a maibock - and it's similar. A nice malty, yet with some balance, easy-drinking beer. I can see this going well at Mardi Gras in warm New Orleans!"
""
"Pours a deep orange color with a khaki head that fizzes away rather quickly without leaving trails. The smell was rather subdued with a bit of caramel and hops but very faint. The taste was a bit mild, but had the standard bock notes of caramel and then some grassy hop flavors. Nothing too out of the ordinary but overall not a bad beer."
"Tastes like the artificial butter flavoring that goes on movie theater popcorn."
""
"Solid beer all around. Good job again abita."
"Not a bad bock. Would have again."
""
""
"On tap Pork Slope, Brooklyn. A boring looking, malty blast with a poor mix of hops. Did not dig the flavor."
""
""

""
"They market thisbasba maibock, maybe Dead Guy has me spoiled but I just find this on the watery side. Just nothing spectacular. A resounding meh."
"Aroma of malts, grains, slight vegetal note, faint caramel. Taste slight sweet malt, grains, grassy, hoppy bitter finish."
""
""
"Pours a clear amber producing 2+ fingers of beige, foamy, moderately lasting head that leaves streaks & splotches of lace. Aroma is malty toast & toffee with a hint of crackers, nuts & herbal hops. Taste is deeply malty: toast, toffee, cracker, roasted nuts & pepper finishing with pepper & hints of honey, molasses, herbal hops & a roasty bitterness that dominates the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a little syrupy on the tongue & quite smooth despite a light prickle throughout most of the sip."
""
"Very surprised on how well this beer tasted. Complex flavors make it feel and taste almost like a pilsner but has a more full body. Very good smell too."
"Not my thing...probably won't have it again. Just not a good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking beer - it has a slight hint of hops on the nose and in the taste. Bread and malt dominate the taste. One of those rare smooth, tasty, easy to drink beers. Not very complex or hoppy though."

"02/21/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nice beer. I know that can sound offensive but sometimes all you want is something amiable. This is that kind of beer. Polite flavors. I think the Mardi Gras labeling is a misnomer as it's not so much a 'party' beer as a beer of the season. Very drinkable. The personification of a ""session"" beer."

"Medium to just above on the body, medium carbonation, creamy and smooth."
"Overall:  Another good beer from Abita.  Good flavors of malt and caramel-like sweetness, wrapped up in a smooth, creamy quaff.  I’d certainly get it again."

"Bock shouldn't be huge, but this seems a little thin in body. Still, the malts lay down pretty good support, and there's a good balance between crisp and smooth, dry and sweet."

"Pours a purplish-amber in color with a thin white head that settles down along the inside of the glass on top. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of of caramel malts, roasted malts with a hint of honey. The taste is even better with lots going on and has a great taste! Full body with lots of flavor that is mentioned above. Perfect balance as well as perfect carbonation. Goes down easy with no bitter aftertaste. A great tasty brew!"
""
""
""
""
"It's an outstanding beer."
""
"O: Easy to drink with a nice blend of distinct malt flavors and a definitely hop presence which is not overbearing. Enjoyable and not too filling. Definitely one to grab again."
""

"Overall: A little too rough around the edges, but does offer some decent flavors."

"Pours a white, five-finger head that fades slowly leaving a some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Honey malty nose and flavor is malty/caramel. Nice bock. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett NH."

"The aroma really is unique with this beer and adds to its odd-ball appeal. Distinctive with an easy drinking character."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Tasty enough, but nothing special. Good enough for washing down a meal though (Salmon melt sandwich) but lacking in aroma."

"The taste is quite enjoyable with the toasted malts, crusty sweetness, and a slight bitter finish that lingers only briefly. Very easy to drink."

"O: Mardi Gras time calls for a beer with plenty of alcohol that won't make you feel too full. This is a good stand in for that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good brew. The malts are not thick but do have a very nice bready bouquet. You can easily drink many of these."

"Golden copper color, decent head, very bubbly. Hints of caramel malts with a slight citrus scent as well. Kind of smells like a brewery floor. Flavor is like a rocky road, whereas; there is no balance of flavor. Contrasting flavors make for a strong and unsmooth taste with a strong alcoholic finish. Beer has an overbearing hoppiness to it which isn't as pleasant as a Pale Ale style beer. A very dry very bland taste makes for a boring brew. Very bubbly and just simply plain."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 5/11/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear pale orange copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, grape, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and fruity ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, cracker, apple, pear, floral, grass, bread, toast, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, floral, grass, bread, toast, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Good balance of malt, hop, and ester flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Overall this is a very solid maibock. Good balance of all flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Rich bodied with a moderate carbonation level. Creamy taste with a touch of sweetness. There's a touch of hop in the swallow. Very round flavor. Lots of toast and semisweet caramel."

"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and sugary aromas. Taste is much the same with malty and slight vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but not something I would go after again."
""
""
"O: While this beer is rather malty, it's not overly filling and seems to have a good balance between the different malts so not one flavor dominates."

"Yeah, it's been about a month since Fat Tuesday, but, hey, it ain't Easter yet, right? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear bronze topped by a couple fingers of light cream-white foam. The nose comprises mild mixed greens, light sweet biscuit, and a twinge of marshmallow. The taste brings in more of the same, only now things are brighter, more expressive, and a bit heavier on the greens (but not by too much more). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a nice little maibock, nothing worth a party, but a welcome addition to anyone's Spring lineup."
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, but not superb, about middle of the road, but thinking of maibock's I really havent had one that's been great to me. Still worth having."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to taste much in the way of hops. Not a veteran of this genre of beer but it drinks easily though not as complex as others. It's ok but not my favorite. Would be easy to drink a ton of these at mardi gras so I guess it works for that."
"O - I was impressed with this beer. I found it easy to drink, but still moderately complex with lots of flavor. I will definately pick it up again next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A very drinkable beer and a nice example of the maibock style."
"Overall its not a bad beer but it isnt very exciting. None of the categories besides it look were very impressive."

"It's a borderline below average drink. the taste had a artificial sweetness to it and the body didn't support the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rather simple though very drinkable beer. There isn't much to report in either flavor or aroma, but there aren't any off flavors either. This is a beer that you can sit back and enjoy a few of without worrying about fatigue. I'm glad I tried this one once, but I probably won't pick it up again."
""
""
"O: A OK maibock, really not doing anything that interesting. It's does its job and that's it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good example of a Maibock. A fun beer for the fest season!"
"A ood solid bock - not great but easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"It has an average body that doesn't leave an aftertaste that lingers too long.... Overall, this beer is one the best I've tried out of the Abita brewery.... However, I was really excited at first look and smell, and slightly let down after finishing.... Not that it's bad, but it leads you to believe that it's much better.... An easier drink than you'd initially think."

"I have a feeling the influence from the hops would be great if this were fresher, but it's mighty tasty and highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was certainly a smooth Bock with plenty of character. It was rather light on the palate, but seemed to work well as a spring seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a disappointing head and OK lacing. Orange beer. The smell is malty, slightly licorice, and sweet. The taste is malt dominated, sweet, with a licorice flavor that may be coming from the hops, not sure about that. Sugary, tastes a little like a Mardi Gras king cake. My favorite Abita offering."
""
"What is it about Abita beers that creates such massive head?!? A light-handed pour still garnered two-plus fingers of eggnog-colored head with great retention on this humid evening. Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with malty sweetness, perhaps too much for my taste as a self-avowed hophead. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a pleasant effervescence that seemed to fill my mouth. The sweetness was not as prevalent on the tongue as it had been on the nose and I found myself enjoying it more than I had expected. In fact, it was so smooth as to be dangerous as over half of it was gone from my glass before I realized it! My my. Finish was semi-dry as there was some inherent sweetness in it, but nothing like the nose had led me to expect. Highly drinkable, but be careful."

"Poured this Maibock from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This brew poured a clear amber color, produced a thick clingy head, featured excellent retention and excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of malted barley and earth. Medium in body, this Maibock featured a malted grain backbone, some notes of caramel, fresh baked bread and sweet malt. Fruity esters from the yeast were also present. Balanced nicely with spicy hops, this is a nice session beer- excellent example of an American Craft version of a german classic. Prost!"
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly true to the style which isnt one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Beer improves as it is allowed to warm, still a poor beer."
"Taste-Sweet toasted malt, nice little hop bite provides a nice balance. Rich flavor. A nice match with a big bowl of spicy jambalaya."
""
""
"A different brew here, good flavors just a bit sharp to hold my interest to session. Pretty good though."
""
"O: I'm not leaping out of my shorts, but a very pleasing brew nonetheless. Will certainly have it again. I've not had much of Abita, but I really do like it."
""
"Pours clear copper with a white head. The smell is of sweet malt, a pleasant floral hop aroma and some breadiness. The taste of slightly sweet malts immediately comes in on the first sip. This is balanced with some hop spiciness and bitterness. The flavor is fairly rich, but also very clean. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is very adequate. I picked this up in the Abita Party Pack and I have to say I'm pleased with this effort overall. I would pick this up as a six-pack. This is a solid beer."
"D: I suppose it is an alright maibock for throwing into a mixed 12-pack. Sort of an intro for the masses. But perhaps not the best first impression as it is a bit coarse and not all that inviting. It is also bit wide of the mark of the real deal. It does drink fairly okay, but needs more malts for the style and abv. Alcohol punch without enough flavor or any real heft to the feel gets to be a drag and hurts drinkability after a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is just an ok beer. I feel like the hops could have been a little more prominent."
""
""
""
""
"O - a nice tasting seasonal, happy spring!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Personally, I think this would be a pretty good session beer, although it is pretty strong for that. I would definitely serve his beer at a party. What can I say?... I like a decently strong beer for that? Either way, worth trying."
""
"more mild than plenty of bocks ive had. smells german malty and a bit like a red ale, with a smililar malt profile. flavor is balanced but definitely malt dominant. some light notes of wheat and sweet fruit are present. mouthfeel is just above medium bodied with lots of crabonation. makes it feel lighter than it is. easy drinking for a bock, but a nice abv on it makes it a perfect beer for this time of year. not bad at all"
"O: Smooth and sessionable. Not as malt-heavy as I remember from years ago. Ready to down more when the parades roll by."
""
""
"Had as Mardi Gras Bock. Strong, malty aroma has good fruity and caramel notes, rather tempting. It pours a clear, somewhat dark golden amber with a fairly thick, pale golden-tan head that leaves some respectable lacing. Flavor has malty, apple, caramel and pear notes, nothing outstanding but still enjoyable. Smooth texture has above-average body and plenty of fizz. Throw me something! ;)"
"Overall, I like the beer. Seems suited to a warmer weather drinking activity. Goes down easy, priced right, and it's not a bad brew to share with friends. Not that complex, so might fit in for the new craft brew crowd."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a quite enjoyable brew...especially for Abita."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber color with a moderate off-white head. Scent is floral and wheaty. The taste is flavorful with a great blend of slightly bitter hops, sweet malts, and floral/hibiscus tones. Drinks smooth and is quite refreshing. My first Abita beer and I plan on drinking many more!"
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is on the malty side. Taste is crisp, malty, some bready flavors, mildly hopped. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking beer that is probably better suited to warm weather."
"O -Not great but not terrible. the ABV makes up for what it lacks in all other categories. Don't go out of the way to buy it...but don't turn it down if it is offered to ya"

"I didn't think there was too much to this beer. The biggest flavor I found was a bit of alcohol. It wasn't bad or anything, but for sure not one of the best Abita brews. But really, I didn't find a ton of flavor at all. I probably wouldn't get it again myslef, but some people did seem to enjoy it."
"Abita Mardi Gras Bock is a decent beer. The beer pours a nice copper clear with thin white head that appears to be lacing. The smell includes a slight lemony/white winish scents. The taste is a fairly good balance between barley and hops, with a sharpness from Saaz that is present. Mouthfeel is good...decent carbonation and medium body make this a pretty good beer. Overall this is a decent beer and worth some beads....Yeah Baby!"
"A descent beer that leans towards the malty side. Easy to drink and would go good with BBQ."
"The Rest: Medium bodied, Abita Bock checks all of the boxes for the bock style, but isn't really special in any way. A very decent bock, but nothing to write home about."
"A good beer with a rich amber color and a somewhat nice thin foamy head. Not too heavy so it’s a good beer to be enjoyed readily throughout the day. Scents and tastes of caramel and malt are noted but neither of which are too heavy or overbearing of the other; but there’s a nice little bite of hops at the end that makes this a right-tasty beer!"
"Overall: This beer is pretty boring. It was lacking in flavor big time. Im used to bock having more than just one note but this pretty much what this one was"
"Definitely one of Abita's better beers."
"Beer is medium to light in body, malt on the backbone, simplicity, nothing else at all. This beer is easy going, easy drinking, easy tasting, no offensive. I liked it."
"O - an enjoyable bock beer. Maltier than average for style."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours a clear amber color with a bit of sediment in suspension. Nice pillow-top, tan colored head. Nice carbonation. Aroma has some caramel, a hint of fruit and maybe some jaggery. Taste is...a mess. It doesn’t come together like the aroma until the aftertaste. At first, it has a harsh buttery hop bite, maybe a little metallic note and finally the rich, aromatic sweetness found in the nose. Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Finish is ultimately bitter and the alcohol is noticeable. This was almost a good beer."
"A very clear orange straw color and a off white head. Once I began to drink it, the head disappeared to a thin film. A European aroma to it. A little skunky with caramel malts. Lots of malt and little hops to note, yeast cone out a bit though. Kinda generic taste. Mouthfeel is full of malts, dry and chewy. Overall, a beer that is not as high in quality as I was hoping for, buy one I should he able to finish."
"Overall I like it. It's nothing spectacular or too complex as far as flavor but a very easy drinking beer. I could crush a six-pack quick and easy."
"Overall: A solid maibock. Not overly interesting but not really flawed either. I could have several on a hot day, but there are several other Abita offerings I would hit up first."
"Much to my disappointment, I just poured three bottles of this brew down the sink. The beer, while not skunked, had an awfully unpleasant taste. The beer had a dark golden color and not an unpleasant nose but I struggled to get through each bottle without finishing any."
"The feel of this beer is crisp with a light drinkable feel. There is a smoothness that has a nice welcoming feel and goes down easy."
"If there was ever reason to brew an easy to quaff, relatively high ABV style, then Mardi Gras is it."
"Ordered a bottle this past Saturday at Coda in the South End. Poured in a standard pint glass. Dark tan color. No head, and not much carbonation. Nothing really detected in the nose. Taste was one dimensional. Mostly malt, some sugary overtones. Mouthfeel was slick and flat. I drank this beer, but didn't find it pleasurable at all. Very boring."
"overall i can see why this would be a mardi gras favourite. a spring pale bock and higher ABV mixed with revelry and jubilation makes for a drunken good time. but as a standalone maibock, it lacks the character that i consider worthy of praise. not bad, but not recommended."
"Overall, a decent lager. Not too flavorful, but solid and drinkable -- and good paired with mustard and fried crawfish."
"D- Drinkable, just think after a couple of these I might get bored with it."
"The beer pours an orange, copper color with a white head that quickly faded to nothing. It has a nice nutty, buttery, toffee aroma. The taste first consists of a light lemon flavor on the back of the tongue, a wave of butter, nuts and caramel washes over and leaves a nice balanced aftertaste. The beer is light with stinging carbonation and a bit of a sticky finish. I thought this was a well done bock, I could definitely drink this again."
"O- A fine example of the style but it's not too interesting. Solid, nothing offensive."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight citrus hop, hint of grain, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight citrus hops, hint of yeast, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."
"These short coming make it drinkable - if I had a bunch, I could drink a bunch. But it is not memorable. This not being one of my favored styles, my opinion is perhaps too much on the low side. It is well made and drinkable."
"O: Pretty darn good brew here. Abita gives you a nice Maibock with this one."
"Slainte and Happy Mardi Gras!"
"Drinkability - This is a very drinkable example of the style. Nothing here is going to blow you away but this seems to be one of the most problematic styles for American brewers to replicate but Abita did a good job of it."
"Drinkability - Has an interesting fruity character to it, which helps the drinkability. Just enough complexity to keep you coming back but won't overload your tastebuds."
"D- (4) Goes down easy. I'm going to get another."
"D: I have been on a Bock kick lately but i would love more of these"
"Drink is good. I am not too familiar with the Maibock style but this is a winner of a lager in my book. Nicely done."
"D: The creaminess makes it go down easily, but the taste is just too bland to leave me wanting more."
"D- a very drinkable brew, esp. on a cold night"
"D. I could drink a lot of these. Haven't been a fan of lagers lately, but this will bring me back."
"Pours a light copper caramel color with an off white head and a small bit of lacing. Nose is mostly comprised of a bit of yeast and some bready malt. A touch of light fruit. Taste is much the same with a bit more fruit along with some grain. Slightly sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel. Drinkability isn't half bad. Nothig great about this but it is an easy sipper."
"D - I could drink this, but wouldn't buy it."
"O - Abita Mardi Gras Bock does a good job of delivering a little more alcohol in a smooth and familiar package to those who might binge-drink the yellow, fizzy stuff, during this ""celebration"" time. A fine maibock, the maltiness is there for a seasonally enjoyable brew."
"With aggressive pouring got a smallish off white head and a little lace. Color is a hazy medium amber. Aroma is malt caramel fruit. Flavor is two dimensional: malt caramel with carbonic acid a hint of hop and fruit. Body is ok but carbonation is way over done- seems forced. Finish is like flavor. Came all the way down here thinking I could get some special Abitas that I can't get at home. I'm askin ya, is this any way to answer a reasonable question? Can't finish this beer."
"D: A tasty brew, easy to drink. Paired with a Thai dish (Gai Pad Nam Prik Phao leftovers), this was probably better than as a stand-alone sipper. Worth a try, a pretty good spring-time brew."
"D: This is a nice bock overall. Avery nice complement to a cool spring day."
"No homerun here, but a decent beer that you could probably have a good time with, especially if you've got the mardi gras beads to go with it."
"D- Fits in well every now and then but doesn't serve as a staple"
"D - This is a nice maibock. One of the better brews from Abita."
"D-not bad but very one dimensional malt wise. The flavor is fairly straight forward. I would drink this again if given limited choices."
"All the Abita beers I had were overcarbonated and a bit thin in mouthfeel. Perfectly fine bee."
"d- there is a sour weird funky aftertaste that i cant get over, it makes this very difficult to fully enjoy and i cant put my finger on it. i feel like if rust had a taste, this could be it."
"Malt flavor leans more towards the toasty side than caramely sweet. There is a bit of hoppiness in here, but it seems as though most of the bitterness is coming from the toasty malts. Lack of sweetness hurts the mouthfeel as this one is kinda thin. Does have just enough creaminess once some of the carbonation leaves (via some swirling action) to keep things interesting. This is a drinking bock that goes down very easy without thinking too much about. Bought this at the same time as SN Glissade and am enjoying this one a bit more surprisingly. Perfect for slugging down on Mardi Gras mornings before a big parade!"
"Poured with good clarity a clear rich golden with a well formed,fluffy one finger white head that left broken lace as it settled slowly.A mix of vegetal,and caramel notes in the nose along with a bit of toast.None of the aroma attributes come across on the palate reaaly save some light caramel in the finish,not one thing eally stands out really.Eh,it started out pretty good but really fell flat flavor wise."
"D: Pretty drinkable for a strong beer. This could become dangerous, easy to get pissed off this stuff."
"Not too bad. Not too fantastic, but well balanced, spicy and crisp."
"WOW just found out now that this is 6.5% , very hard to believe alcohol is concealed nicely."
"Notes: I like that this is drinkable in the spirit of Mardis Gras."
"Smells and tastes zippy, malty, and smooth. Good comparison is Millstream's schildbrau, only this has a livelier yeast profile and a bit more hop presence. Starts with candy sweet toffee, moving into biscuits and bread, ending on sweet and sour maltiness."
"A decent brew, but not something I'll seek out again."
"D: Quite drinkable, I really enjoyed this brew and Abita continues to grow on me."
"D: The sweetness is a little cloying, and the full flavor (and ""non-sessionable"" ABV) gives this beer weight in the back of the mouth. In the end, it's smooth, flavorful, and very drinkable. Enjoy one or two, but more than that and you're gonna be feeling it on a couple levels. Recommended."
"Watch the high-ish ABV! Probably best enjoyed with hardy food. Abita recommends roasted beef or pork (and Mexican food...)."
"Drinkability: Typically, I find Abita brews to be lackluster at best, but this lil' bock isn't half bad. If a regular dose of Cheerios is heart-healthy, sure Abita Mardi Gras Bock has some health benefits as well."
"M/D - Excellent in both of these categories. Each sip leaves the mouth wanting more, and I could drink ton of these."
"Poured a ruddy light brown with about an inch of head. There is a tremendous amount of lacing around the top of the glass as the head settles quickly. The aroma is slightly yeasty with a sweet malt presence as well. The taste is very malty and slightly smokey as well. The taste is prototypical to a bock and not very remarkable at all. The mouthfeel is very smooth and makes me want to drink many many more of these. Probably my second favorite Abita beer after Turbodog and a good solid bock."
"RJT"
"Drinks ok, this is very sessionable which is a good thing, but Bud Light is also sessionable"
"D: I could throw these back pretty quickly because it does seem light bodied, and I am enjoying the progressions of taste mentioned above. All in all, a decent brew from the boys down the street."
"Pours a copper color with basically no head. Smell is biscuity with a little bit of fruit and hops. Taste follows the aroma a lot of malt. Not much hop presence in the beer. Even though this beer is half a year old, it still tastes pretty good to me. One of the better Abita brews I have tried."
"Overall: This beer is decent. To me, Abita isnt known for great beers, but this one is worth buying."
"Overall this beer doesn't taste or smell like much of anything until it has a chance to warm, but once it does it turns into a fairly quaffable brew. I certainly don't recommend seeking this one out but it'll do in a pinch."
"Pours a crystal clear amber hue with a light tan off white head forming thick and creamy like rising above the edge of my glass. Aroma contains sweet biscuit notes with honey caressing the senses and a touch of caramel malts. A mild herbal or grassy hop character just barely peeks through. Flavor is more of the same a mix of sweet and semi sweet with balancing herbal hop notes. Caramel and biscuits drizzled with honey nails my description of this brew. Clean drinking experience with some mineral water adding to the complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but never ways heavy on my palate, excellent quaffable bock from the bayou. Drinkability overall it does the trick, not a brew I'm dying to get again but one that I will revisit next Mardi Gras season, now if Abita would just bring back their 20th Annivesary Czech Pils than, I'd be a happy camper."
"This poured a clear, dark gold with light tan head. It smelled like heavy bready yeast with honey and fresh wheat, and a bit of orange. It tasted like oranges and honey wheat bread, with some caramel malt. It was slightly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a nice clean and crisp beer, with a refreshing flavor and good body. It's a well constructed brew that was quite easy to drink, and was definitely enjoyable. This is worth picking up a six-pack of this one, rather than just sampling a single."
"Notes - A true-to-style bock, which is fairly rare. Probably my favorite Abita to date."
"D: I want to like Abita's standard offering, but these same vegetable flavors keep popping up. Are they using adjuncts, or is it just a unique effect of their specific brewing process? Either way, it's not really doing much for me."
"Drinkability: only going to drink one bock tonight but I think I could easily throw back a six-pack during an afternoon on the lake, on the deck, or at the golf course. I am somewhat of an Abita homer. I am a fan of their offerings save the purple haze. I was glad to find the bock while spring brew shopping."
"Overall Abita Bock is a pretty tasting Bock, but I believe that its characteristics makes it must more sessionable then most Bocks I have consumed."
"drinkability is dead on, seasonable perfect spring celebration beer"
"From an Abita ""Select"" handle in its home state. Was told this was the doppelbock, but this seems to fit the appearance and availability more. Pours a dark amber, mostly clear but some floaties quickly settle to the bottom. Smell & taste: lots of caramel, some vague fruitiness, a bit of grainy and grassy hops, maybe a touch of raisin and alcohol. Decent, might try a single again if I find it in bottles."
"Mardi Gras Bock pours a light copper with a 2-finger off-white head. Minimal lacing. Smells of roasted malts, bread, slightly bready. The flavor is kind of empty, just some bready malts with an odd bitterness & a hint of sweet caramel. Mouthfeel is a little carbonated, but light & watery. This just OK as far as drinkablilty, but there are much better choices out there as far as bocks go."
"I prefer my bocks to be heavier, thicker and sweeter than this. It could be that I should buy doppelbock instead. Nevertheless, it's not a bad beer by any means, and while I won't seek it out again it's drinkable enough that I don't regret buying it."
"Drinkability: A nice beer for relaxing, but nothing that sets the world on fire."
"Better than I remember it, but still nothing special."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability for one or two, but the sweetness would soon get me to switch to something a bit more in the way of a hop presence. Good solid brew but nothing exceptional."
"I Had this beer on tap at The Chimes. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, not because it was good, but because it was a solid beer from Abita. The appearance is a straw-gold color, but the aroma is a bit better with lighter fruits with a hint of citrus. The taste is mostly roasted malts, but there is a yeasty aftertaste. Like many Abita beers, they made this beer too thin. This beer is very drinkable due to no bad notes in this beer; I also feel it's at a higher ABV than their Amber or Fall Fest."
"(Note: This beer was companion to a hoagie and followed a Vanilla Porter). This beer did not impress me very much...could have been me, surroundings, the food. It was as good as and as drinkable as a glass of fresh, cold water...I mean that as a compliment, sort of."
"Not bad overall, but not incredibly impressive. I like Abita and this is a decent beer, but it seems a tad uninspired. Easy to drink for sure, but there's just nothing terribly memorable about it. I'd have it again but wouldn't go out of my way to pick more up."
"D: The flavor and body alone make this beer really drinkable - and in quantity. Not big on flavor or fill especially if you work a little to decant it (which I did on the second beer)."
"Good offering from Abita."
"Light bodied, crisply carbonated. It isn't bad, but I'm disappointed."
"Medium carbonation but seems too thin for a bock. Overall this is just a really average beer. I mean I'd take one if offered, and I'd prefer it over most macros...but there's just nothing really special about this that stands out. One and done here, I've had my fill and won't be seeking this out again. It seems like our local breweries down here like to just tack on ""Mardi Gras"" to their duller brews to make them look more appealing..."
"D - I bought this in preparation for the Mardi Gras season down here, but was sorely disappointed. As a Bock beer, there are much better offerings, and much better beers to get into the Mardi Gras spirit"
"Decent atmosphere, pleasing complex nose, and distinctive flavor. It has a very interesting sweetness to it, but so much so that it's distracting. Feel doesn't do anything to take away from the brew, either. All this, and good drinkability, make for a really nice quaff."
"Overall-not that great, too sweet, muddled, just not that drinkable."
"Drinkable average bock."
"The feel is creamy and a tad bubbly. Thicker than expected, but certainly not a choker. It's a substantial drink with lots of summery, tree-fruit notes. Very very nice."
"1"" dirty cream head retains at 1/4"". Clear, bright golden beer with a good amount of slow moving bubbles rising up. Some lace. Sweet aroma, sugar candy...hops buried way down in there. Low aroma. Not much flavor at all, just some sweet, grainy malt. Thin body with carbonation somewhere between low and medium. Not much there, don't care to drink again."
"Pours a smoky brownish orange with no carbonation. One-finger head of light tan foam that fades at a casual pace, leaving a thin sheet of lacing over the beer and plenty along the sides of the glass. I was really excited about trying this beer but was highly disappointed."
"I'm not sure what the ABV is on this bock, but it doesn't feel too big to me. It's crisp, it's refreshing, and it still maintains a nice residual bock sweetness. Another very well-crafted brew from the gang in Abita Springs."
"This beer poured a golden/amber color with a nice white head that lasted a while. Aroma was malty with hints of caramel and toffee. Flavor was very much the same with some hop bitterness coming through to balance the flavor. Very little lacing, good mouthfeel and carbonation. Good beer."
"D: Again, Abita makes OK brews but nothing special by any stretch of the word."
"Pours a very darker amber brown. No head. Nose is crisp and airy. And apples. Flavor is very sugary sweet; too much so in my opinion. On the end an out of place metallic tone. Bordering on burnt caramel is there too. Feel is extremely sticky and thick on the liquid and very low on the carbonation. I have to say that overall you can drink this one, but I don't really see any good reason to. Leaning way too far to one side, it doesn't deliver a balanced and worthy experience."
"Pours a orangish gold color. Thick head on the pour that quickly dissipated. The smell is weak with a faint toffee smell. The flavor isn't bad, but nothing exceptional. A sweet malt flavor up front with faint hop bite at the end. Not a bad bock, just nothing outstanding about it."
"Drinkability: This is really good. The slight malt finish reminds me of Spaten Oktoberfest. It's not as strong as Spaten, it hints at that flavor. I actually expected something like Shiner Bock when I bought this. It's more European in feel than Shiner."
"It is a more malty, less grainy Shiner Bock (which is also barely a bock)."
"12 oz. stubby bottle, best before 7/3 - 2007 I would presume. It pours a lightly-carbonated golden/topaz with a finger of frothy, beige head that quickly dissipates to a fine collar. The bouquet is lightly sweet, with hints of fruit or jam (apricot?, banana?) and maybe some white wine, which seems a bit strange. Its flavor is very clean, with lightly spicy/grassy hops, a mild bitterness, and a cherry Kool-Aid fruitiness, which also seems a bit strange. The body is medium, fairly smooth, with light carbonation and a fleeting finish. OK at best - not really worth seeking out."
"A great session beer on a warm springs day."
"D - I sampled this on a beautiful spring-like day, but it really wasn't anything worth waiting for. In the 'spring-bock' category, I'll stick with Saint Arnold."
"Drinks okay a very dulled down version of a bock, still glad to see something different from these guys, I remember when these guys were the the only southern craft beer I could get. As long a you're not too pedantic about style (or malt), this is an alright warm weather sessioner"
"Laissez les bons temps rouler!."
"Anyway, give it a try"
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a nice creamy head  small bubbles, but the head doesnt last long. The smell is quite malty  with sweet and sour hints. The taste is malty, but not sweet. The hops are noticeable and balance out the beer well. The mouthfeel is full and slightly creamy. This is a nicely balanced beer that I would consider a favorite during the season."
"A fairly poor example of the bock style, but very drinkable."
"Not a bad bock, however it seems to be a little more tame than other beers in this style. Try it for yourself."
""
"Medium amber with a small, off-white, foamy, slowly diminishing head. Smell is bready and fruity, with grape being the most notable aroma. The taste is also quite juicy, both in taste and mouthfeel. Fruitiness is accompanied by some buttery malt, light caramel, and light spicy hops. Rather odd, but oddly enjoyable."
"Overall Impression: Solid beer. No obvious flaws, nice nutty base, noticeable but restrained hops, clean with a great color. Glad to see Abita can still kick out a solid beer."
"Overall: Intriguing flavor, creamy mouth and matching cream-soda taste is a plus."
"Surprisingly nice, comming from Abita, but still not a strong contender for it's style. Has some nice Bock characters. A strong malt dark malt flavor, but not the body or viscocity. Ok head retention, but quickly fleeting. Has a strong malty aroma and flavor with no supporting melding, aging, complexity, or strength. Lighly syrupy flavored with hops for bittering and, maybe, an earthy flaovr and aroma. A little nutty and woody. Body is quite light for style with over carbonaiton. Leaves the mouth too light and thin. Still better than most macro bocks (cough, cough, amber bock, cough, cough). It's ok. I will probably drink again only when offered for free."
"Grassy aroma smells oddly adjuncty. Quite unexpected aroma that reminds me of a polish lager. Clear amber with a tiny white head. Fore is thin and touches on toasty grains and mild apple notes. Pervasive watery flavor throughout. Very low flavor intensity. It's like a Bock Lite."
"Drinkability: The flavor really allows this beer to drink fast and often. I could imagine making a big session out of this beer - so very appropriate for Mardi Gras."
"Pours an amber garnet with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells sulphury, sweet, and slightly of floral hops. The flavor is pretty lackluster, especially in terms of the malt profile. The only thing holding my attention is the floral hop flavor and the balance to the syrupy sweetness. Mouthfeel is decent. It is neither heavy, nor is it too bubbly or anything. Drinkability? No."
"Cheers2Beers"
"-UF"
"Pours a solid copper color with excellent clarity and minimal head over top. I'd like to see a touch more head on the pour. Nose is not what I was looking for. I get a healthy graineyness, not the toasty maly I want to smell. I'm also getting a touch of buttery diacetyl, but blended in the with the grainey character. Not really drawing me in. Flavor is a bit better. Graney and toasty notes dominate, with just a touch of buttery playing in there. I get just a kiss of bitterness on the finsih to balance things out. Feel is moderate with a healthy moderate carbonation. Overall, an okay brew. Its not doing anything to really grab me. I would like to see the grainy character be gone and a stronger toastyness. I'd have it again, just not too soon."
"This is not a bad special entry by Abita, especially given their penchant for making some fairly pedestrian brews, particularly some of their minor offerings. I'd be okay with sucking down several Mardi Gras Bocks while taking in a few parades on St. Charles."
"Pours a clear yellow amber color with a small foam top.The head didn't last very long.The smell is kinda hoppy but bland. Does every abita brew smell the same to everyone else? It has the same stench. The taste is better though. The caramel flavors hit ya upon first sip. I would prefer more hops in the taste, kinda weak and not dry enough. The mouthfeel lacks punch, kinda syrupy water feeling. Mouthfeel of soda. It sounds like soda too! There are some good flavors here but everything else falls short. It is just plain blah."
"Overall i think this is an excellent beer. One of the best ones i have had from abita, well at least for the seasonals (love turbodog). This years batch seems better than the past years. To me it tastes almost like a light version of andygator."
"Opinion: This is the second time Ive tried this beer, and I remember thinking the last time that it was an OK beer. This one is way out of balance. Maybe they may do better in coming years, but I wouldnt buy the 05 again."
"A light amber-tan colored head sits atop this brilliantly clear copper colored beer. The aroma is subdued with notes of sweet malt, a hint of sweet orange peel, and a bit of alcohol; not really much there though. The taste is lightly sweet up front with a body that seems both thin and slightly full at the same time. The predominant taste is of sweet malt with a bit of caramalization to it; overall, like in the aroma, this beer is pretty bland. Certainly there is not anything wrong with this beer just a bit uninspiring."
"This is a better than average maibock. At least the brewers haven't scrimped on ingredients like they do in most of the rest of their lineup. Although it doesn't thrill me, Abita Bock is a drinkable springtime seasonal and is the best beer from these guys that I've had yet."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head above the clear, light amber brew. Head lasts well, and exhibits nice lacing. Aroma is pretty non-descript, with minimal pale malt and hops components, and a bit of fruitiness. Taste is upfront with the malty bitterness, and a sort of ""off"" fruitiness that kind of wrecks it for me. Aftertaste doesn't do it for me either. Have to appreciate the creamy mouthfeel here, even if I wasn't enamored by the flavors, and drinkability is reasonable if the tastes are your bag, I guess. Had better Maibocks recently, so this has probably jaded me for awhile."
"I like this style the best of all the Abita's I sampled. It's highly drinkable and flavorful, a real pleasure."
"Maybe the swamp water cancelled out some of the bock molecules..."
"Thanks to BigLove for the sample, and the Abita glass to enjoy it in!"
"not too drinkable though- the bitter edge gets annoying after half a bottle's worth is done and there is no overall hop mouthfeel or anything to match."
"Pours a clear amber color with a small head that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma has some faint caramel and some apple. Taste is nice for a bock, crisp and clean with hints of caramel, apple, and lightly toasted malts. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a hint of spicyness on the tongue. Extremely drinkable. One of Abita's better ales."
"Abita Bock is amber-orange in color with decent head. The aroma is invitingly malty, but nothing outstanding. The taste is malty, primarily caramel, not very strong or complex. A slight rawness is a little bit annoying, perhaps it is actually the metallic taste I've be reading about. Nonetheless, I found this enjoyable in the same way I find most other Abita beers enjoyable; as above-average, easy-to-drink beers."
"P.S. I have noticed that some people have detected metallic or musty flavors or aromas in the beer and I can only say that I was lucky to get this beer super fresh. There were no off flavors at all and I can only hope that more people will see how great a bock this is when they get to try it fresh. I dont know why everybody keeps talking about a golden color, mine was dark amber, thats weird, maybe they changed the recipe."
"Clear, gold in color, I was expecting a more vivid color; this is dull even for a Pale Bock. A head of one finger in height topped off the beer. The head retention was fair, after a few moments it faded to a small cap and then a soapy collar, sparse in the middle. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is bland. The nose is sweet and grainy but clean and fruity. Lightly toasty at the back, with a musty undercurrent that reminds me of every Millstream beer. Not a pleasant reminder. The potency is moderate, while I cant call the bouquet inviting I wouldnt call it offensive either. The palate is tasty; there is no getting around that. It is much better than the nose indicated. The sweetness is ideal and it is not weak or wavering, rather firm actually. The toastiness is faint but noticeable. There is a bit of spiciness in the middle that is pleasantly coupled with some fruity flavors. There are no distinct fruits, just a nice marmalade. The finish is the home of the hops, light hints of Saaz I think, and just the slightest taste of alcohol. I actually got a little belly warmth out of this beer. Cool. I mean warm. I mean whatever. The aftertaste is long but clean, something to be expected (or at least desired for the style). Medium/medium-light in body, low carbonation but the mouthfeel is pleasant but ordinary. I havent had many Abita beers but this dandy is the best thus far. I would buy a six-pack of this if it were found locally. But it is not. Thanks Morris729 for the bottle!"
"Not quite sure what to make of this. It's kinda between a Kolsch in it's carbonation, mouthfeel, and dryness, and kinda like a Helles or Dortmunder otherwise. Either way, it's not very impressive. One is plenty enough for me. Would probably be better ice-cold."
"Beer is good. Happy grainy brewing."
"This beer I would put in the top three of the Abita offerings, behind Turbodog, and their Amber Ale. This beer is an excellent example of the style, has a great malty nose, followed up by a clean malty flavor. I had the priveledge of drinking a couple of pints at the Abita Springs Brewpub and would highly recommend making the trip if you are ever in the New Orleans area."
"Pours with a thick head, but very thin lacing and almost no head retention. Golden color. Heavy carbination, but not too much. Very light aroma, hint of champagne in the scent, and there is an almost sweet champagne taste in there too somewhere. Maybe it is apple juice -sparkling cider? Slight bite in there, light bitterness that is left in your mouth afterwards. Light tasting beer, smooth, would be good for hot days in the sun. Goes down easy. One of the better of the Abita's."
"Abita Bock: a nice tasting MaiBock from Abita, in fact this is probably my favorite Abita beer. Pours a deep golden, with just a hint of red around the edges. Not much head, but what it had was a wee bit sticky. The taste is very nice, rich hearty malty Mai-Bock flavors. Sweet and slightly fruity, with mild tastes of red apples. Very nice, and worth picking up if you see it."
"The beer pours a gold color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is sub-average. It boasts of pale malts and a musty stench. It has a lager yeast aroma as well. The taste is average. It is light with a slight grainy malt flavor. It finishes dry with a musty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little more than average carbonation. It drinks fair. I don't care for this beer. It's one and done for me."
" Finish is dry w/ another hint of German malt in the background."
"Beer is an appetizing ruby brown. Metallic, old malt, semi-syrupy sweet, with a little bit of bite. The metallic taste really bothers me. The body of the beer is quite thin, but I guess this is a Maibock at the same time, this quality adds to its drink ability."
"Pours a light brownish-orange with a thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Light malt aroma. Thin to medium-bodied with a clean malt flavor. Smooth and a little watery though. The finish is a little spicy and malty. Overall not bad, it just felt like there could have been more to this."
"This started out looking pretty good, then faded fast. The nice golden tan head vanished nearly instantly and there was absolutely no lacing. The color was light amber or very dark gold. The initial taste was pure malt, but followed by a decent amount hop bitterness in the back. Along the way there was also light fruit sense. Fairly nice flavoring but points off for the feel which was overly astringent and peppery. Insignificant caramel malt aromas."
"Pours clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head. The smell of an earthy grain and lightly sweet malt with a bit of spicy hops shining through. After first taste, this reminds me of a bolder version of Miller High Life with a sweet corn taste. Adjuncts? Im not sure about that, but from the taste I wouldnt be surprised. It also contains a perfumey fake finish that doesnt settle well. It is a light bodied brew and finishes with a headache. This is not a good brew! So far, so bad with my Abita journey, and this one is the worst! Im not impressed. This seems to be a brewery that makes shortcuts on their brews IMO. Cheers anyways!"
"Pours a golden orange color with a creamy white head that fades into a good amount of lace, but the head can easily be fully resurrected by swirling the glass. Nose is sweet malts with a touch of stale and musty grains. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts with a bit of fruit and some grassy notes followed by a mildly bitter hop bite. This was a pretty enjoyable brew, but its not one I would buy all that often."
"The smell is toasty nutty with a little bit of fruit. The beer starts sweetish and lagery, giving way to a roasty nutty middle. Quite full-bodied. The finish is German bitter, a little metallic, some alcohol evident. This is quite a surprising beer. Interesting."
"This is one of the better Abita brews. The beer pours quite golden for a Bock. The head is weak and short lived. The nose is also quite weak and only hints at malt. On the inverse - the flavors do not match the nose. There is a very strong malt and hop flavor that stands out in contrast. The flavors are a bit out of balance and the hop finish is quite bitter. This has a medium to light mouthfeel with no unique texture. This is really more like an IPA than a Bock."
"The flavor of this beer is fairly good. It is pretty fruity and sweet, like caramel and sweet black cherries. There are not a lot of dark and roasty malts like I would have expected out of a ""bock"". I had expected a darker beer, but it did not hurt this brew that it was fairly light and light-bodied. It was very easy to drink, but I think if you came accross this during the summer, it would end up being a fine selection to quench the hard hours of labor."
"An slightly above-average beer all in all. Abita suggests that it goes well with Mardi Gras... Considering the deceptive alcohol, a few of these would ensure that the drinker either gave or received large volumes of beads"
"Golden in color, weak small head, malty, musty aroma, sweet malty caremel flavors, very sweet at first finishes sour, bad aftertaste.I would not wan't to drink more than one, not a very good bock, I don't care for it."
"The nose is a beautiful push of brown sugar and honey. On the palate it briefly offers more of the same before it succumbs to a watery tasting mix of hops, caramel and kids cereal. A nice effort and quite drinkable."
"The body is hazy and orangish-gold in color topped by a frothy white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a decent collar and whispy surface foam. The aroma is quite nice with a slightly fruity and richly malty Munich malt character that's gently toasty and sweetish; backed by some bright, sharp, spicy hops. The body is medium with a very fine, standard level of carbonation that gives it a lightly crisp but smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is as the aroma suggests with a slightly fruity, rich, toasted malt that's supported by an underlying bitterness. It's a ""juicy"" malt that also has some decent hop flavor present - spicy Saaz and floral Hallertauer. It finishes semi-dry with a lingering sweet maltiness as well as some clear alcohol. Easily, and without question, my favorite beer from Abita! Although this Bock offers some rich malt & hop character, it's not real filling and the alcohol is fairly well-masked making it quite drinkable. Very well done and definitely worth trying. I'd love to get a hold of this fresh, and on tap!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a short brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Notes: A damn nice stab at the Maibock style. A bit one-dimensional if compared to traditional Maibocks, but if not compared, this is a pretty tasty offering. Personally I enjoyed it. Drinkable, flavourful and sturdy."
"Abita's bock shares a slightly astringent tartness that I find in all of their beers.  In the bock, it is well integrated with a mellow maltyness.  Mouthfeel is fairly light, but this is a very drinkable brew, and would go along happily with about any food you want to pair.  Their Turbodog gets the most attention (probably because of the name), but the bock is something of a sleeper from the brewery."
