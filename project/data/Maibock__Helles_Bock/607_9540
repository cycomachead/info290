3.45,-12.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This one pours out as a clear looking yellowish gold color. The head is fluffy at first and leaves a decent lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has plenty of malts on the nose. The taste is also full of malts and has a sweeter flavor going on. The mouthfeel is in he lighter side. Overall this beer is a pretty good brew for this style, light, refreshing and sweet. Not bad.","Knapp85","Apr 27, 2011"
3.47,-11.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The mouthfeel is medium with adequate carbonation. Finishes fairly dry and bitter despite the prevalent breadiness of the malts. Overall this is an average beer at best in my opinion. There's no memorable qualities here although it's a fine tasting beer. Maybe I just think this style is boring but I have had much better Maibocks/Helles Bocks. I would definitely classify this more towards the Helles side. Quite light in flavor profile, like a good sessionable German pilsner. At such a high ABV, you can't/wouldn't want to have more than one. This would be enjoyable to session on a hot day because of the freshing qualities it offers, but at 7.5%, I won't be ""wasting my consumption limit"" on this brew.","claspada","Jul 21, 2010"
4.5,14.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is an easy sipper of a beer and each sip follows the earlier one quite naturally. I’ll certainly be having this one again. In addition it was an excellent counterpoint to the seafood gumbo that was lunch. The paring worked well in that the malt countered the spiciness of the Gumbo and both played off of each other quite nicely. My overall impression is of a well made maibock that demonstrates nicely that good German style beers can be made in the US.","drtth","Apr 15, 2010"
4.46,13.2,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Into a pint glass, it poured an amber/golden hue, with over two fingers of white head, generous amounts of carbonation, great head retention, and very good lacing. Smelled very malty, with caramel, apple, and some herbal noble hop notes. The taste was a little more pronounced than the nose, with a very nicely balanced fruit/maltiness, and finishing on a crisp dry note. Medium- to thick-bodied, but when mixed with the generous carbonation, it creates a nice mouth sensation. Very feint hint of heightened alcohol content makes this yet another dangerously drinkable beer from these guys. I think I see a trend here...","donniecuffs","Mar 13, 2010"

4.43,12.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"High Point did something extraordinary with this maibock: that is, they brewed a beer in New Jersey that tastes like it could have come from Bavaria. A pleasure to drink. A.","dasenebler","Jul 01, 2009"
3.18,-19.3,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Growler from Big Z's. Pours a deep burnt orange with a small white head. Aroma of bready lager malt and some sweet fruits. Flavor of sweet malt, a touch of cardboard, and bready malts. A little sweet and on the bland side. Not bad just uninteresting.","LilBeerDoctor","Jun 30, 2009"
3.45,-12.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D- I guess for the alcohol content its pretty easy drinking but i didn't find myself wanted more than one, i'm not the biggest Maibock fan perhaps this is why i didn't enjoy this one as much as others","bonbini26","May 19, 2009"
3.55,-9.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"There's a lot going on here, and it's impressive, but I just don't think they all meld together well enough. Maybe it's just my personal thing about all maibocks, but nonetheless.","dudecandle","May 09, 2009"
4.33,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very good example of the style. One of the best American version you're gonna get from a brewery that quietly makes top notch German-styled beers.","TheycallmeTim","Jun 02, 2008"
4.15,5.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Clear amber color with a short off-white head that was revived with each swirl of the glass, leaving some spots of lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel and roasted malts. Taste is on the sweeter side with a hint of alcohol and noble hop bittering. Medium bodied, crisp and smooth feel make this a good brew to drink and welcome the change of season.","JoeyBeerBelly","May 26, 2008"

4.35,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This might be the best maibock I've ever had. The balance of flavors is perfect. The only think I could say is I wish it was a touch stronger in taste. It had this pairs of the sweet, cherry and red licorice malt sweetness with underlying crisp biscuit and a hit of grassy herbal hops for balance. Some maibocks are too plain, or are too sweet, this beer is just damn tasty.","tempest","Mar 09, 2008"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"It was a nice treat to find this on-tap at pearly bakers the other day. It was even recommended by the bartender. It's nice to see this brewery distributed in PA now as well! Anyhoo, this brew is a nice light-dark red colour with tinted orange highlights and a nice cap of tannish/white foam. The aromas are all fresh bready,biscuity malts and green, leafy, fresh German hops. The taste is malty, sweet, and biscuity, with a nice touch of those fresh hops keeping everything together in a nice balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and good and drinkability is very nice as well. A real winner of a Maibock from this awesome wheat-based-beer-brewery. I'd love to try their new beer soon as well. I hear it is a killer APA. Nice.","francisweizen","Jun 10, 2004"

4.15,5.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability  I loved this Ramstein to death. It is the first really good Maibock that Ive had here in the US. Dont try to sip this all night long, though. At 7.5% ABV this one is unusually high in alcohol and actually quite filling.","RoyalT","May 09, 2004"
4.4,11.7,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Amber orange with a clingy white head and a fruity tootsie-roll smell. Tasted like caramel, brown sugar, spiced apples and Milk Balls that have been stripped of their chocolate coating. And a wee, wee, wee bit o' hops. Great smooth mouthfeel with a lower than average carbonation that helps bring out the flavor. Shocking that a) this is 7.5ABV? b) it's being served to me in a 20oz glass and c) I want another one. And another. Hell I could drink this all night. I'm in a bar surrounded by fabulous, expensive Belgian beers and this is the $5 20oz tap special and I could STILL drink it all night. Wow.","PopeJonPaul","Apr 05, 2004"
4.15,5.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A mild tea-like and citrusy hop taste provides a little counter to the big malt sweetness. The potent alcohol is barely noticeable. This is a highly gulpable brew!","BeerResearcher","Mar 20, 2004"
4.68,18.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"On tap at the brewery and out of a filled 2 liter growler. Crystal clear yellow orange with a white lasting head. Clean malty aroma, the way a lager should be. Big long malty flavor that lasts on the tongue. Crisp, clean finish. Slight hop note in the background. This years is the best ever. Great mai-bock!!!! I wish this were more available, but alas. Hopefully the standard established by this years batch can be maintained in the years to come...","vladtheimpaler","Mar 14, 2004"
4.45,12.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This will be hard to find. Don't wait for the nest open house. Grab a growler, call Greg, and ask when he can fill it. Get yourself up to the brewery. Try all his beers.","RonfromJersey","Apr 22, 2003"
4.33,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Backwash: I don’t normally review beers in front of the computer, but after a few at yesterday’s open house and one from the growler last night, I still wanted a “refresher!” This is another big winner from Ramstein, which doesn’t make a bad (or even mediocre) beer. Heaven help its competitors if they decide to stray from their “mission” of make great German-style beer; but I guess that would be a bit like Ferrari deciding to make a station wagon! I had last year’s version later in its life-cycle, so it had mellowed somewhat; but I think I like this year’s even better. In any event, this is a worthy successor to their Octoberfest, Winter Wheat, and Eisbock.","Dantes","Beers"
4.6,16.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Oranges blend with a big malt character to start you off. A beautiful hop presence balances it out to a masterpiece. Dry bready aftertaste in the end, and maybe you can pick up a tiny bit of alcohol, but you really have to look for it. It is smooth with a very light carbonation. The body is as full as it could be for the style with loads of flavor. I could drink this brew all day long. I am sorry I did not pick up a growler for Easter, but the one I have will not last long at all. A beautiful drinker, that is complex with flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel is excellent, and it looks damn good too. This is not one to miss, but unfortunately many people will.","ElGuapo","0"
