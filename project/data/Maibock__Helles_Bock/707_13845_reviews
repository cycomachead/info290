" A realy good beer one of my fave lagers I can put theese back all day and at 7% you can't taste the alcohol really smooth beer"
"An enjoyable beer for sure."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in weight, with medium-low levels of carbonation, enough to just create a mildly fizzy, modestly foamy mouthfeel as this travels across the palate. Finishes dry, as one might expect from the bittering hop and ethanol content of the beer, with modest residual stickiness across the palate. A very pleasant and satisfactory mouthfeel, overall."
"The color was a nice clear golden yellow with a reddish hue. There was very little white foam and not much lace on the side of the glass. The smell had a strong aroma of Saaz hops with a hint of citrus. The taste was of hops, with a citrus bitterness, but also, a citrus sweetness. A little bitter on the palate and aftertaste, but, not overly bitter. Overall, a nice balance for this Maibock."
"Another sweetheart deal from the distributors for BevMo. From the 500 ml bottle."
""
"Overall - An interesting beer; lots of honey character, but the bitterness cuts through to give this brew a bittersweet quality not unlike a lot of Octerberfest brews."
"This pours a light amber tan with some foaming that dies down into a tight lace. There’s a lightly sweet aroma followed by some light malty notes. I get a mild caramel hint of sweetness which rounds out the flavor. It’s honeyed and mellow and exceptionally smooth, with a nice rounded finish. A little too sweet for a starter beer but I could easily see having this one for dessert."

"An interesting find at the local beer market. Very european in style. Now just got to compare it to its American cousin Rogue."
"O -- Overall, this is a good beer, but like Urquell I can see the Saaz hops becoming too fatiguing to my palate. I prefer the German renditions of the style better, but that doesn't take away from this being a well-made beer."
""
""
"O: A really wonderful beer. Suprised me to find out how good it was."
"Overall – very interesting brew, with a very good taste."
""
"There's something off-putting in the flavors. Almost like a forced herbal mint. Didn't come together very well."
"The taste is initially of malt, but then a decent array of hop flavor steps up for an overall balanced taste. There are some interesting flavors in the mix -- some kind of fruity, some kind of earthy. I liked it and will definitely finish the rest of the set I received. However, I probably would not actively seek out this beer. I also wouldn't turn down a pint if offered."
"Hot, generic and rather unpleasant. It's perhaps not actually offensive, but it's unnecessary in its weight and aggression. I've had far, far better."
"I liked this a lot. Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol."
"This is a great example of a maibock. Wish I can get this one more often"
"I am pleasantly surprised at just about every part of this beer. For some reason I expected a big, hot lager, and that is not what I got. Everything comes together nicely, but I do think it is a little too heavy to be a quencher."
"Amber-copper color, similar to some ciders. Modest carbonation and pours with a medium sized, firm head. Smells of grain, malt, and some sweet notes. Soft mouthfeel, round, smooth, and balanced. A bit hoppy then some bitterness, but I still found it really enjoyable."
"Pours a dark golden orange with some cloudiness to it and a full inch of a thick white head, good retention with light lace. The aroma has Sweet grainy malt, and a subtle fruity notes. The taste is similar and rich, well-rounded and some nice character. It has strong toasty grain, and somewhat a dry finish. I felt a touch of alcohol right on the finish. I'm surprised this rates so poorly on RateBeer, and Rates pretty decent on BeerAdvocate. Well, I'm with BA on this one....I liked it."
"Pours a semi-clear copper color with a good amount of carbonation for a good head. Scent has some malts standing out giving it that obvious bock smell. The taste is mild with an almost nutty flavor to it. A very long lasting taste that is smooth and hits the taste buds just right. A great beer to go with a sandwitch."
"Pours a clear, light amber. Bubbles swirl inside the glass while a thick, off-white head head clings very well. Smell is a sharp-tipped (alcohol), sugary malt. Taste is an explosion of sweet, dark-fruit malts and a lot of pithy bitters. An overload of ingredients in fact, but they balance out nicely. Has a rich, bready body, while the end is hoppily bitter and dry. An alcohol feel is present too. Except for a scad of alcohol burn, everything is good here. All in all, a fine example of a maibock imo, and something well worth picking up for $2.00!"
"Overall. Impressed for a lager. Medium sweet semi honey like, this is the second time I purchased this beer. $2 for a 500ml thats 7.5% seems like a fair deal to me, if your at the same price point you should try it!"
"D- although not terrible, the strange flavor is off-putting and makes this one difficult to finish."
"CONCLUSION: This a great light beer and provides a very good drinking experience. Not once were my taste buds being punished with intensity or bored to death with mediocrity. 500ml of 7.5% alcohol makes one more than enough for me though. The label boasts of its award as the ""World's Best Lager", while I don't know about all that I will say it's pretty dang good and interesting. Don't let the cheap, Eastern-European, malt liquor-like label fool you--this is a good one. *it's best at 50+ degrees"
"O: Very drinkable, well made but not my personal favorite."
"Drinkability - Although this beer is very balanced and drinkable, I feel like it is slightly less drinkable than a Doppelbock. The bitter hop presence will make you want something slightly sweeter and/or maltier everntually. But when it comes to one beer, enjoy."
"Drinkability is high due to the subdued sweetness. One of the better beers in the style."
"Nice, but no cigar!"
"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: This beer is super drinkable. Not too complex or strong in flavor and aroma, sweet, malty and fruity; definitely an easy drinker. The higher alcohol is masked almost completely which makes it a dangerous beer because you may be tempted to drink it quickly. I'm sad to see all of the hating going on against this beer and Primátor's Doppelbock. This beer was awarded Best Lager in the World 2008 by Beers of the World magazine and I believe it is a very well-made, deserving beer. And at a very low price for a 500ml bottle, I wouldn't complain even if it was half as good as it was."
"D - This is not exactly my cup of tea. Even if I were a fan, the sweetness would wear heavily on me by the second pint, if not earlier."
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its mouthfeel. Although the carbonation is perceivably overwhelming, the thicker characteristics and creaminess certainly make up for it. As for flavoring, there was a disproportionate level of sourness which, if curbed, might have let some other flavors shine, while ultimately making the beer stronger in quality."
"I'm sorry, this beer did not work for me. I didn't like the aroma, it was caramel but stinky a bit like cheese. The looks, light amber with temporary big foam. Body was OK, though carbonation seemed unsuitable. Caramel taste with some bitterness, bit the whole experience did not work so not so drinkable."
"D:I guess if you just want to get drunk it'll do.Its a chuggin beer.It's not for philosophers.I wont buy this one again.It just didn't do anything for me."
"I'm not impressed at all, it is a stretch to call this even mediocre. The feel is utterly terrible, like fizzy watered down corn syrup, and the hop is just gross."
"Pours a clean orange-ish / copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy and a touch of fruit. In the taste, lager-ish, a small fruitiness, earthiness, and a sweet biscuit like malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruit like aftertaste. Nice fruity sweetness and easy to drink. Quite nice."
"Drinkability: Booze and sweetness are it's more notable attributes. Fine for a cheap liqueur or for a Let's Get Sauced Weekend, but that's not at all what I wanted from this. A thumb down for my displeasure, but a thumb up for not being as quite as despicable as their Double Bock."
"drinkability is ok - i only bought one so i dont know if drinking more could put one into a sugar coma"
"It's decent, the hop taste is a bit overbearing though."
"Just the slightest haze in this golden colored brew. The rich head is off-white and a good three fingers thick. The overwhelming taste is of sweet fruitiness (kind of a combo of apples, bananas, and peaches) mixed with some caramel. Despite the higher ABV, it's pretty refreshing. I didn't know about this one after the first drink, but it really grew on me. As far as the hops, I didn't get any in the taste. However, there were some flowery hops in the nose. I'd definitely have this again."
"D: Not bad at all, a nice bit of citrus and malt flavor that balances nicely. The metal taste that creeps in once in awhile rains on the parade a bit."
"D: medium to high"
"Hazed, orange blonde with a creamy bone colored head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Rich and malty with plenty of fruity yeast in the aroma. Rich and malty with nutty and green apple flavors with a dry champagne yeast quality in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Full bodied with smooth carbonation. A tasty surprise."
"d-decent beer. I always seem to think this when I have a german or czech lager, but this was probably better over there."
"It is called a Maibock, but one might nearly call this a double/imperial lager. Very enjoyable!"
"In the overall picture, one of the better maibocks I've come across."
"Serving size: 16.9 ozs"
"Pours a dark golden orange with some cloudiness to it and a full inch or so of thick white head, good retention and lace. The aroma has fresh malted barley alongside an earthy and bitter, hot hop character. The flavor begins with a mild pale malt character with some nice grain flavors, then the hops kick into a full hops bitterness that is a bit floral but also quite astringent and surprisingly harsh on the palate. Lingering bitter finish with some cookie and pepper. Body is medium viscosity with a smooth, moderate carbonation. Not too impressed with this one, a bit rough around the edges and drinks slowly."
"Overalll, a decent Maibock. The higher alcohol makes you feel good, but not so nice on the aftertaste and finish."
"Slightly sticky mouthfeel echoes the honey-like appearance. Owing to its alcohol content and abundant sweetness, you probably wouldn't want to have more than one of these. The one you did have, though, would be enjoyable. Overall, very nice."
"Pours a four finger cream head that fades quickly, leaving some lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light malty nose. Flavor is sweet malty caramel with hops way in background. Good price at $2.79 for a 500ml bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT"
"Pours a nice clean golden/light-copper color. Fluffy off-white head. Retention looked almost ""curdled", decent lacing. Smell is of carmel coated popcorn and a strong lager sulfury stank to it. Taste is a very sweet carmel coated popcoirn flavor - sweet malts and diacetyl - followed by hop presence and a very sulfury taste. Alcohol pops up in the finish. Medium bodied, slightly coating, slightly warming. Very sweet and very sulfury lager bite to it. Slow sipper."
"Drinkability: Pretty strong Maibock overall in terms of malts, hops and alcohol - not that I'm complaining."
"D - Overall its not a bad beer just nothing extra special has a decent taste"
"Pours pale golden with generous white head. Noes is somewhat light with a clean, lightly malty aroma. Palate is warm with the alcohol, malt as the focus, and a clean finish. More alcohol warmth into the finish and aftertaste. It's light enough to enjoy with everyday food but perhaps too hot for being a sessionable beer."
"I only had one bottle, I should have bought more, even thou the high alcohol might come back to you after the second one, but with this beer I don't care if I have a good buzz after two pints."
"D - I just couldn't get past the sweetness of this beer...if it would have been cut down a little by some hops I think I would have liked it better...it's nicely carbonated which makes it very refreshing...a good beer for the price but I'll pass the next time"
"D - Overall, looks can be deceiving."
"The taste is similar and similarly rich, well-rounded and characterful. It has strong toasty grain, some bread, spicey-raisiny-grapey alcohol, herbs, some grass. It has a light but firm, malty sweetness underneath a fairly strong, dominating bitterness that is herbal and grassy and, with raisiny spice, dominates the finish to linger nicely over underlying sweetness, without being too strong."
"The beer is bright gold with a huge white head. The nose is malty and a little alcohol fueled at first. I liked the solid malty midbody with a slightly sweet finish and the bigness of the beer in general. There was a little hotness to the beer at first but it smoothed out fast. Drinkable and in profile almost like a big Octoberfest."
"I didi not enjoy this beer."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. It's labeled as a 'blonde doppelbock', which is pretty unique from my experience. I think it's pretty tasty (of course I am a sucker for decoction mashing) but it's a bit too alcoholic to become a regular of mine (not to mention a bit rare in my neck-of-the-woods)."
"Ahh, thankful for a strong beer offering from a Czech brewery! Not particularly special as it is your usual Czech beer but a bit stronger nonetheless. Compared to other offerings, however, it is both affordable and drinkable. Tasty and a great way to wind down the day after classes. Out of the bottle it has a good layer of foam which remains throughout drinking. A bit of a hop flavour, although not much to write home about. I drink this beer regularly and can highly recommend it for those living in the Czech Republic and feeling at a loss for strong, tasty beers."
"It should be fairly obvious by now that I don't care for Primator Blonde Bock. I'm tempted to break out one of my shot glasses for the remainder of the bottle, but there are only a few ounces to go, so I might as well tough it out. Here's hoping the bottle of Primator Double Bock currently residing in my cellar is not only a horse of a different color, but a horse of a better flavor."
"Pours a vibrant, crystal clear amber with a tall white foamy head. Smells rich and malty, grassy, with some sweet caramel notes. First taste reminded me a lot of my local gem, Capital Blonde Dopplebock - robust with sweet caramel malts and grassy notes - but sadly picks up some astringent, medicinal, bitter notes that give the tongue a little twitch and detract from the overall drinkability, though the 7% is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is rich and full. This is a solid dopplebock, but I guess I'm spoiled with Capital in town. Worth a try as it's still not a bad light dopplebock."
"Nice golden color with a huge white creamy head. Lots of lacing thru out. Noticed scents of wheat/grassy. Nice sweet taste with a medium body. There's also a nice malty aftertaste. This brew really does not feel/taste like a 7%. Would recommend this to everyone to try at least once."
"D- Pretty easy to quaff but a big enough body to keep the sipping to a minimum."
"Not bad, not bad at all."
"(11.2 oz / 330 ml)"
"D- Very nice beer and this would make a good session beer for spring. Even though it has a big malt taste it has enough hops and alcohol to balance out. It goes down smooth and has a nice complexity about it."
"Overall, I like this as a choice of a general drinking (session) beer- just real easy to drink and enjoy, without being overly complex."
"Overall this is unremarkable but not horrible...I would not purchase again..might fit better as an Imperial Pilsner"
"Drinkability  This is the equivalent of high-quality malt liquor. Its strong, grainy, sweet, alcoholic, but smooth. Well done."
"What a tasty creation."
"Pours a brilliant golden color witha nice head that leaves a nice amount of lace,aroma is all malt grainy and fruity with some hints of alcohol.Taste is a malt bomb (me like that)bready malt with a hint of alcoho with a decent fruitiness to it.No hops here a beer that really takes the edge off,nice beer."
"Classic Czech floral aroma. (Saaz?) Tall white head, vigorous carbonation. Clear light yellow with a small measure of sediment. Sweet to the lip, thin on the tongue. Has a manicured finish -- a bit truncated but clean. This is a flavorful beer but very modest. It is drinkable and informal. A simple kiss of malt with only floral hops, nothing bitter."
"Crystal yellow with an overflowing think off-white head. Smells of hard rye bread or something close to it. The taste reminded me of caramel candy without quite as much sugar, it has a sharp start and sharp finish, not quite harsh. Hope lingered throughout but I didn't get a strong hoppy feel as other reviews seem to have. I wouldn't call it spicy but there was a slight burning sensation after a while. The carbonation was suffiicient, felt reasonably well in the mouth and was quite drinkable for a heavier beer. It's a beer I'll have again along with their double bock."
"Mmm. Went well with my burgers made on toasted rye bread with a little German flair. Not bad. Clear golden color with a small head that fades rapidly. Nothing too exciting or exceptional. Likewise, the aromas are non-descript -- a melding of grassy, subdued malts, understated hops, and mild alcohol sweetness. Similarly flavored with just the most mild fruity character -- perhaps mostly just the alcohol being its normal sweet self. Finishes with a very mild but balancing hop presence. Certainly appropriate for the style, but not exceptional."
"Primátor is a good lager that keeps the fine Czech brewing reputation well intact."
