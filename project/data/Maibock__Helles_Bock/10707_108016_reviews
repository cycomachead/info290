"I was not too happy with this one. It smelled funky and just kind of, for lack of a better term, ""off"". The taste was similar but only slightly better. Overall, the taste and aroma are grainy but in an unappealing way. Will not get again."
"Poured nicely with a white creamy head, however, it dissipated very quickly and the taste was too bland for being a German Bock."
"Overall: disappointing."

"Of all of the Trader Joe's beers this is probably my favorite (with the exception of their Vintage Ale and Providential Golden Ale made by Unibroue). It's a clean, straightforward helles bock that's got just the right amount of maltiness to it so that it's not too thin, too full, or too sticky. And it's got some decent floral and spicy hops in the flavor as well. The head retention and lacing could be a bit better, the aroma could be slightly fuller, and perhaps the malt quality itself, but as far as American brewed versions of the style go it's top-notch. With that said, just getting a malty 7% abv beer for $1.17 ($28 for a case) is next to impossible!"

"I was never a fan of light beers until I tried the JB Heller Bock. It starts crisp, but gains weight in the middle and finishes with a meaty malt flavor."

"Serving type: bottle."
"Overall- I'm not familiar with this style and what to compare it to, but its a decent beer that at the very least is an easy drinker if something simple is desired.  Solid malt flavor, but the hops are way too spiced up.  Worth drinking if ya got it for free, but certainly not something I'd paid for or recommend. (71/100)"

"O: Nothing special but not bad either, a pretty decent offering especially for the price. Easy enough to drink and enjoyable. Worth grabbing for the price and worth sampling."
"Poured from a bottle into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium coppery amber with a thin white head that dissipates to light patches and thin ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet caramel and bready malt, hints of lemon and toffee. Flavor is sweet caramel malt, light lemon and toffee and grassy hops. Medium bodied with light carbonation. An adequate, mild take on a heller bock without much character to the hops, hits the right notes in the malt profile. Delivers on its purpose: an inexpensive, nicely made domestic  heller bock."

"Overall it's not a bad helles bock, but doesn't stand out for the style either. However, given the price of trader joe's beers (5.99 a sixer at my local place), if you like helles bocks, this is a perfectly fine choice. I don't mind breaking the tie based on price when all else is equal in beer selection."

"The taste was fairly routine for the style with some caramel malts and crisp. Clean hops. Nothing special."

"I'll admit that Maibocks aren't my favorite beers. Still, JosephBrau's Heller Bock isn't a very good representation of the style. Nor is it a beer that I'll be drinking again."

"12 oz bottle from TJs. Pours golden with foamy whit head. Nose id of grassy hops, bready malt and hints of caramel. Body is medium and crisp. Grassy, herbal hops dominate the palate; bready malt and grain provide some balance. Finish is long, herbal. Not very good brew with unpleasant hops profile. I would not by this brew again."
"Offers a firm and steady hop delivery regardless of agitation in the glass. Distinctive German character yet with more than average intrigue."
""
"T: Nutty and a touch bitter, almost like pistachio nut oil. A lot of graininess, malt syrup, slight almond and a tad of faded grassy hops. Mouthfeel is way heavy, allowing the sweetness to become overbearing. Not recommended."
