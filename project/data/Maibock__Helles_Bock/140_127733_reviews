"Overall: little gem of a very nice beer"

"May have been past its prime by a ways."

"3.64/5.00"
"A really nice brew and true to the name..a really hopped up tropical maibock.  I would buy this again.  Recommended."

"I Crack!ed this bad boy open and oh, how I wanted to CANduct an inverted Glug, but I CANstrained myself due to its relative age. I CANnot take the ChANce that one of these beers might be CANditioned, so I felt CANpelled to go with a gentle pour. When this only netted me a skim of light-tan head, I CANtinued to employ the bartender's trick and give it a good agitation. Soon, I had two fingers of light-tan head that quickly fell back to wisps, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "

"Ehhh, this isn't so impressive.  I wouldn't have guessed it's a Maibock; a real miss on the style.  It's a smooth, hoppy lager that is a bit too overwhelming in the citrus rind flavors."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with average carbonation, well above average flavor and a slightly grainy, sweet bitter finish that can seem dry or clean at times. This was very interesting and I enjoyed it quite a bit – my expectations were low for a bock/maibock collaboration from a can but this shocked me with really good flavor and pretty peculiar qualities that made for a tasty beer experience. To me this was the “sleeper” brew of the Beer Camp Across America 12 pack since I expected to crack the top and just throw this back, but it was really enjoyable."
"Overall a very interesting beer which kind of seems all over the place but is easy to drink. Not worth a second visit though."

"Had this beer on tap yesterday (12/24/14) at the Green Onion Pub in Utica, NY.  I wanted to review it because a previous rating narrative described Yonder Bock as cloyingly sweet.  I find that description peculiar in that I found the taste to be exceptionally dry, showing that it was effectively fermented.  Maybe I got an old batch, perhaps it was a mistake batch, or maybe my sense of taste is beginning to wane.  The fact is, this beer was dry, almost as if it had a touch of brett in the ferment, though it didn't.  Anyway, easy drinking at 7.7, great hop content for a lager, that kind of took it out of the Maibock range, but who cares, adhering to beer style ""rules"" is a thing of the past.  US brewers are making the best beer in the world right now by breaking the ""rules", and have been for years.   We just want great beer, and man it is out there like crazy.  Nice job Sierra-Cigar City."

"O - A tasty brew for sure.  Less Mai-bock, more IPA IPO"
""
""
"Copper body with  a small white head. Sweet boozy aroma. Mango comes through with too much alcohol heat. Maibocks are already sweet, and this is too much, even cloying. I didn't particularly enjoy this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"11/5...BCAA 4/12...pours brownish copper color with fizzy white foam that leaves a layer. Tropical fruit nose, small scent. Taste is a fruity malt blend, with tones of vanilla, cola, root beer, and a prickly cactus like bitter. Full malt. Great."

"Malty, sweet, boozy. Drink with an open mind because what you see (Amber) isn't quite what you taste. Good beer but may not please those folks not partial to porters or stouts."
""
"A great new twist on an old style. Came out a bit too sweet for me. Overall a fairly nice and potent beer~"

"Enjoyable."
""

""

""
""
"O: Reasonably drinkable, but nothing to get excited about. The fruity flavors and the sweet malts have more of an additive effect than I'd like without much in way of balance. Not the worst of the Beer Camp pack for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Pretty nice tropical maibock.  I could only imagine how much more hoppier this was when canned, but the hops have held up well since then."
""
"3.82 | 86 | B+"

""
""
"O-Another let down from the SN Beer Camp mix pack"
""
"Certainly one of the better Maibocks I've ever tasted. From the 12 oz can. One of my favorites from the 2014 Beer Camp pack. I don't care if a lot of these SN experiments are off-kilter, it's a great way to promote beer creativity."
"O: Very cool idea, but I think a bit too malty for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Another good hybrid style. Malt bill is bock, but the hop profile is definitely an IPA. A juicy tropical one. This blends well."
""
""
"Overall bleh, just a mix of lots of so-so flavors that don't go well together. Like a typical collab fashion they couldn't agree on a single direction for the beer, so they all just added random things to make it interesting, and it came out horrible."
"not my cup of tea (or beer).  A bit too sweet.  Almost a slight sour after taste (not what I would refer to as bitter, as in an IPA)."

"12oz can, Pours a deep copper amber with a off white medium lasting fluffy head. Aroma is grains, caramel malt, fruity notes. Taste is sweet fruity notes, I guess tropical, grains, caramel malt and mild earthy herbal hops bitterness. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is grains, malt some tropical fruity notes with mild bitterness on the end. Overall an interesting and good drinking brew."
""
"Great collaboration guys!"
""
""
""
""
"Looks nice, bright copper color, clear, nice creamy white head. Good head retention.  As expected by the description, big fruity hop aroma. Taste is well balanced: biscuity malt flavor and hoppy finish. Medium body and carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Cigar City cannot fail.  I've loved every beer I've tried with their name on it.  Light, fruity flavors are pleasant in the Florida sun.  One of the craft breweries that are absolutely nailing it right now"
"Overall a pretty tasty brew.  Not really catching much of the bock style other that it is pretty smooth.  Tasty brew, would recommend to those that enjoy hoppier brews."

"Definitely on the strong list for the Beer Camp series. Shame it's not always available. Definitely would put on regular rotation."
"I was surprised how much I liked this beer.  The fruit is very subdued and the overall impression is one of smoothness and great balance. The ABV heft is very well masked and it would seem that one could quaff this for a while; until it catches up with you! Had on draft at Hunger-n-Thirst in Lancaster and it is still there (as of 18 Sept). Highly recommend!"

"Poured from a can into a bell shaped glass.  Head easily climbs to three fingers with a strong pour.  Head is biscuity tan and turns quickly rocky as it fades.  Tons of lace is left behind as it fades.  Nose is both spicy and musky fragrant.  Which is not what I expected from this version of the style.  Flavor is spearheaded by a balance of tropical hops and sweet malts.  There is just enough spice to this brew that balance things out and really makes this brew interesting.  Overall I was expecting a brew a bit sweeter but I was pleasantly surprised."

"This bock smells AMAZING. As soon as its poured you are hit w/ a fruity, sticky sweet, caramel smell. It looks vibrantly amber in the glass & has a foamy head. Upon taste it is not overly sweet w/ a smack of hops at the end. Crisp, clean & perfect for a hot day at camp. Im normally not a huge fan of the style (except for maybe Rogues Dead Guy Ale) but this was surprisingly good. A bock well worth trying."

"Another beer from the master of all things canned, (well, beer related anyway), woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of bready malts, some mild fruits. Taste is malty, some bitterness, a bit bready, light fruits, just a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Overall, an interesting take on the style with some unique flavors but a bit too bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: didn't get anything that would make me want to come back;"
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops open up a bit with time but so does the yeasty dark fruits. Kind of like a cleaner Doppel with toasty malts and slight stone citrus fruits."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty tasty, easy-going beer. The ABV is a little high for what is otherwise a supremely drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Maibock is one of my least favorite styles and the tropical twist here is enough to keep my attention diverted for a couple of sips; ultimately, the harsh finish forced me to downgrade the result"
""
""
"Taste is very heavy on the palate — big malts up front, but along the finish there’s a tropical fruit twist that’s unique and delicious. I get mango, pineapple, and even a note of lime. An inventive and unique brew that’s quite delicious and balanced between malts and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste - Fruity with a refreshing malt backbone.a faint sourness with pine notes throughout. The malt is more noticeable as you continue drinking. You can tell there was a lot of careful exploration with the hops that were used."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent take on the style. The ""tropical"" element is a bit odd. I can't get the idea of sweet bread out of my mind."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D:  Another great offering in the camp lineup.  I love that you do get some of the Cigar City character in this and the entire concept of a Hoppy Maibock is pretty cool.  Would easily have again.  Cans are a real nice touch too!"
"great from a flute"
""
""
""
""
"Can: Poured a deep amber color bock with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and fruity ester and tropical fruit notes is singular. Taste is also a mix between some caramel malt with some residual sugar balanced off by some tropical fruit notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting experiment but not sure I would seek this again."
""
"A fairly active pour yields two fingers worth of crisp dense khaki colored whipped frothy goodness...  Really good retention...  Once settled there is a full even lacing and slight collar...  The color is a pale warm inviting caramel color...  A light to moderate bit of slow to moderate paced carbonation rises throughout...  Overall a pretty nice looking brew...  A very nice nose...  The malty goodness is at the forefront in terms of gooey caramel and toffee...  Next rises a warm sweet fruity component that was lingering a bit beneath the surface...  Lots of warm doughy bread notes...  The flavor profile is dialed up in intensity from the aroma, but all of the expected players are present...  Lots of caramel, toasted malts and warm bread notes...  Overly ripened fruit with a slight hint of citrusy hops...  Simple, straight-forward and quite effective...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Viscous, chewy and perhaps even a bit sludgy...  Limited carbonation...  Coats the mouth fully...  After starting a bit lush, the finish has a touch of dryness and is somewhat chalky...  Overall a very nice beer and one of the beer from the Beer Camp offerings I've tried thus far (I still have 5 to go)..."
"Pours an orange color with a 1/2"" head. The aroma is bready and full of caramel. The flavor profile follows the nose as caramel, bread, dark fruits, and mild bitterness. Smooth throughout, and a relatively short aftertaste here. Easy to drink."
""
""
"O - This beer does the trick for me. Balanced, with inventive flavor combinations; never had anything like the malt/hop bills presented here. The 7.7 ABV seems just right to pack enough flavor punch and body. Sad that it's only available in the Beer Camp 12 pack. If this were a year-around release, it would be a staple."
""
"It seems I'm not a big fan of the style but this is pretty good for the style. The hop character is pretty rich; the bitter finish goes a bit too much towards grapefruit for my taste. Caramel notes and toasted malt flavors with a distinctive lagered profile. There's a sweetness that I'm not a fan of, but might pair well with the right foods. Anyone who enjoys Dead Guy ale should give this a try. Not the beer for me, but well made."
""
""
"Overall, not great, but not bad either."
""
""
"Nose is tropical with mango and guava. Taste to match. Soft and easy drinker, very cigar city. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really nice beer.  Not entirely to style for a maibock, but a neat take on it.  Doesn't taste like 45 IBU!"
""
"Thought this was decent but just wish the fruit shined through a bit more – thought it was a bit difficult to detect it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure if it all really works. The citrusy and tropical flavors are nice, but I don't think they entirely work with the other flavors typical to the style. Ultimately, I would like this dryer, slightly less boozy, and a little cleaner."

"o: Rather fruit-dominated flavor and hoppy for a Maibock, but tasty as such.  Refreshing."
"Collaborations are a good place to try out Big Idea beers that you know probably aren't gonna pan out. If it's good, great. If it sucks, so what--you can blame the other brewer, and heck, it was supposed to be a one time thing anyway."

"Poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass with about an inch of light khaki colored head.  Beer is an amber orange tinted color with slight amount of bobbles.  Smells sweet fruity malt scent perhaps a hint of mango.  Just like the scent the taste is fruity sweet with a solid malt backbone.  Smooth creamy feel.  I'd say this would be a great summer maibock.  Pretty well balanced and not overalls sweet.  I'd get this beer again if I was going to be outside."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. Not bad, not great either. I would pass on having this one again."

"O: What's there is pleasant. What's lacking is complexity and intensity"
""
""
""
""
"Light coppery color gave way to a large fluffy head. Light malty nose, with raisin and date along with some bready character. The flavor is smooth and light but quite delicious. I catch strong malt influences of grain, tea leaf, biscuit, caramel and toast. Light nut, molasses, raisin and date are deeply subtle. This drinks very smooth and easy but has a great thickness. Very enjoyable and amongst the best in the lot."
""
""
""
"Really nice tropical fruit flavors, easily the best aroma of any of these beer camp beers. It has a nice malt backbone too, with a slight hop bite near the end.  I am really enjoying this, probably would taste even better on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich enough but nothing stands out.  A pleasant enough beer but nothing memorable.  Cigar City and Sierra Nevada could have done better."

"Overall - Blah."

"Picked up the Beer Camp Sampler and immediately wanted to try this one. Right out the gates nothing like i expected. the color is a gorgeous orange amber color. The smell is slightly fruity but also piney and floral. Mouthfeel is very nice with some bitterness. Taste is not what i expected at all the fruit flavor is very subtle, I've had west coast and DIPA that possessed greater fruit flavor on the first taste. The mango and passionfruit come through ever so slightly while the star of the show would be the malt bill that is equal parts smooth and intricate, while also possessing some bread characteristics. The beer finishes very clean. Really nice brew."
""
""
"deep orangey bright color...smells of hearth baked bread with extra 'toasted' yeast....maybe buttered toast....taste trumps the nose and ups the ante with a rich mouthfeel, chewy enough but not thick. really phenomenal. maybe the super wide pilsener glass is do its job. the abv is sure present but so well woven into the rest of the profile and the mouthfeel. incredible surprise from this expensive, but so far, interesting limited edition case."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very enjoyable brew. The aroma could have been amped up a bit but otherwise, a very tasty-almost-decadent brew."
""
"This beer pours a amber color body with a frost small head. The smell has a little mango and citrus coming from it. The taste has a little sweet to it up front then the hops come in, they are well balanced and flavorful. The mouthfeel is nice and overall a really good beer."
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how else to describe this bock. I like it but it just feels underwhelming. It has to be amazing on tap though because of the hop profile."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Bock. Nice kick of citrus comes out from the Bock malt notes."
""
"O: The hops make this very ale-like, but the malts and yeast keep it in line. Way too easy to drink for 7.7%. Would definitely buy this in a standalone 6-pack"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish orange color with a thick foamy head. Head retention and lacing is excellent. A tropical fruit aroma predominates. Can possibly get a hint of apples as well. Fruity malty taste with a slight hop bitterness at the end. Mild bitter aftertaste with a touch of sweetness. Not a bad beer. Would drink again, but it is not a style I usually look for."
""
"Can from the mix pack. Pours a beautiful red orange color, slight haze , with a big creamy off white head. Aroma of sweet malts, Brady, some fruits, sweet sugars. Flavor is nice bready malts, lots of sweetness, some tropical fruit notes, and a crisp finish that keeps this far from too sweet. Medium plus body, very smooth and silky, with medium carbonation. This was pretty nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of those beers where nothing is remarkable and yet nothing is flawed either. Enjoyable and would be a nice fall weather beer."
""
""

"D: a very unique bock beer. good hop flavor. lots of tropical notes with a big bock body. im happy to say this is the first time I have had a beer like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – At 7.7 % abv the alcohol taste is almost non-existent and the flavor exhibits big fruity and bready flavors. A very drinkable Maibock with a nice flavor profile. Even while on the slightly sweeter side , this was a rather good drinker."

"The body was smooth and even. Drinkability was good, even though the beer was a bit blandish. Overall, a solid enough beer, not bad, not notable. It's in the box, drink it."
"Overall interesting beer, I expected more, but still liked what I got. Became more complex as I drank it and more flavors revealed themselves."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good take on a Maibock hit with a solid dose of American high alpha and experimental hops. This could easily be reason for a new spinoff style, IDL, IO or IM. . India Dark Lager, India Oktoberfest or India Maibock, but that's just silly, ain't it?"
""
""
""
"A nice maibock."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nice mix of hop and malt flavors without letting either one get too out of hand."
""
""
"O: The fact that this beer is a collaboration with Cigar City really comes through - I consider this a positive as aspects from both breweries come through in the finished beer. Enjoyable and easy to drink."
"o: Well, the alcohol was well masked anyway. I wonder how much better this was fresh?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, this one is another miss for me out of this pack. I can't really say it's a bad beer, but I'd certainly reach for almost *any* other beer out of the box again ahead of this one, and certainly wouldn't dream of buying it as a standalone beer. I think this may be another case of expectations that were let down--I read ""tropical bock"" and expected something really unique and interesting, and instead found just a beer."
"Prost!"
""
"O - Cigar City nails it. I love what they do, this one so far best of beer camp bunch. I hope to see this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another bock? Yeehaw? Anyways. Great clarity on this one with a dark amber hue. Thick tan head. Nose is sweet on a very malty tone. Flavor is moderately malty sweet with a mild fruit tone that definitely leans towards tropical (mission accomplished on that aspect). I wouldn't have expected to appreciate this one as much as I have. I typically dislike anything bock. But apparently, this is an exception."
""
" This is very tasty and tangy with tropical flavor like fruit salad with mixed taste of light toasted grain and gentle woody hops in the background with slight caramel flavor mid palate. The taste has a gentle astringency level with some fruity tangy character coming through with mild yeast adding to the complexity and grainy malt carrying a supplimentary flavor into the semi-dry finish with a little alcohol noticeable in the taste. I really liked this bock..it is a good lager with fruity hop accent complimenting the base yet a bit sweet which is the only thing holding this back -hoppy and bock can be good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pleasant beer to drink and much hoppier than a regular Maibock. This is my first of the beer camp box I bought. So far so good. Would buy again for the colder months by the fire."

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Across America Yonder Bock ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is bready and spicy with a subtle candied apple caramel flavor. Darker than expected on the pour yet there isn't a lot of sweetness on the tongue that the color might suggest. Finish is dry and offers a light crackery bitterness. Feel is again a bit thin with regards to what the color/flavor/style might suggest. Overall an easy drinking brew, rather hoppy and dry for the style and with a body that doesn't quite define itself in a traditional sense. ABV is hinted at but never obvious nonetheless. A nice take on the style and reminds me of Weihenstephaner's Festbier in a sense. Atypical yet perhaps more to my liking as for lack of buttery sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet mango and orange backed by bitter citrus rounded by a bready malt backbone with sweet caramel notes. It finishes with an herbal, floral bitterness slightly dry."
""
""
""
"O: hoppier than the bock I had yesterday, more rounded/balanced; not sure how this stacks up to the standards of the style, but as a stand-alone beer, it was a very enjoyable drink that I'd have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very well balanced and definitely the most interesting maibock I have ever had."
""
"O: Balanced and flavorful brew. A tropical Maibock? Who'd have thunk it?"
"O - The beer is definetly as its described. An interesting take on the style. Definetly gla I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Not bad. I'm not a big fan of the style thus I wouldn't try again. A good hop presence but not a lot of flavor from them."
"Overall, this ended up being a drain pour."
""
""
"O: This tastes very much like a Cigar City-inspired German style maibock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks sweet and a bit course on the palate but otherwise is a very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"o: you know…its not that typical of the style, but its tasty. its very sweet, but it doesn't overwhelm. it also has a nice mix of fruity flavors in there that work with the caramel to compliment each other."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a bronze-coppery amber with a one finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Interesting aroma of melon and berry tropical fruit, apricot light bready malt, a bit spicy, light grassy hops; really unique. Flavor is mixed mildly carmal and biscuit malt, sweet tropical fruit leaning towards pineapple, grassy hops. Finishes with a quite pleasant tropical fruit / grassy hop taste that lingered with floral fruit flavors for a while. Light to medium bodied. This ain't your granpappy's maibock. However the basic maibock profile is there, but nicely spiced and modified by the unusual fruit flavors. I was slightly disappointed in the initial flavor after the very interesting aroma, but this really grew on me as I drank it. Interesting and flavorul. The tropical flavors mesh nicely with the maibock base. Now 6/12 on the pack and still really enjoying it."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. If you haven’t picked up on it yet, this is a subtle brew. Everything comes together nicely without beating you over the head with any single feature. Another solid offering from Beer Camp."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty solid maibock, tastes and feels fairly big. A fairly well done example of the style I'd have to say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: The overall take away from this ""BCAA"" series is that it misses the mark on what could have been an exceptional package. Only maybe 3 or 4 of the beers in this 12 pack are noteworthy and that makes this series extremely overpriced at even the $25 I payed here in the Houston area. With the same money I could have purchased 3 sixers of any of the really fine Sierra Nevada offerings and had enough left over to buy a burger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the last of tonight's BC beers (West Coast DIPA, Chico king, Alt Route, and Yvan the Great). These are some great beers, but they do run together (even from when I did them one a night)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a caramelly amber with almost no head after a few moments. Malt, caramel, and booze are big in the nose. I was expecting more tropical hops as promised by the can. Flavor is classic maibock. Sweetness, malt syrup, some booze, and a firm bitterness in the finish. Again, I'm not getting big hop flavor or aroma in this as I would have expected from the description. Solid maibock, though. Mouthfeel is moderate to full, with a bit of slickness. Carbonation is tame. This is a pretty good maibock, but I was expecting more hop flavor and aroma and those tropical fruits I was promised. This is pretty standard (but in a good way)."

"O-For a Maibock, this is pretty tasty. I usually don't enjoy the flavor essences of Maibocks. Actually looking back at my ratings, I don't take too kindly to this style at all."
""
""
"O- An interesting beer to say the least. I assumed it would be unique based on the name alone, but this one certainly is pretty crazy. Worth a try though."
""
""
""
"Disappointing beer for me. I think a better recipe formulation or even a better description of the beer itself merits some consideration. I feel like I was expecting one thing by the description note on the back of the can, but got something completely different. Not a bad beer nonetheless. About above average."

"Overall - Pretty good. Its a simple one-two punch of citric fruits and caramel malts. Simple, yet effective, the citric fruits provide some sweet and smooth flavors. The beer has some bite, which makes it feel bigger then what it is. Solid, and glad I got to try."

"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. A collaboration between Cigar City and Sierra Nevada. Poured that can into a glass to see what's up. Gorgeous crystal clear color with a nice frothy head. I thoroughly enjoy the nose. Has that distinctive bock nose with the addition of tropical (and not so tropical) fruits. Well I guess the tropics do likely have apples and such, tropical apples! Crisp, clean taste, just what I would expect from a Maibock. Reminiscent of Hofbrau Maiock, which is a compliment. Really smooth, full mouthfeel. I've been a sour trip for my go to summer beers, but I could see this guy creeping in. Overall a solid beer in the Beer Camp lineup, love what the ""tropical fruits"" add to the classic Maibock style."
""
""
"A tasty bock and kind of fun if a little distracting and out of kilter."
"Nice amber with rich, generous head. Nose reveals the fruits right off the bat, perhaps too much so. Makes you anticipate a fruit bomb. Fairly decent balance on the palate though with the fruit being big, but not over the top. Mai bock traditional qualities were muted because of the fruit. Reviewing to style, this one is not a maibock I can get behind. If this was an fruit/vegetable beer, then it deserves a higher score."
""
"O. Another really good beer out of my Beer Camp pack. This is number 5 for me and so far I've enjoyed each and every one. Maibock is one of those German styles we just don't see visited enough here in America with the IPA, stouts, sours, and all things barrel aged craze. But what a nice little beer that SN and CCB have crafted here. It's got very nice balance between hearty and dry (the pale malt and hops are showcased nicely) and the tropical hops and fruit that CCB used really adds some great balance. Very interesting, very classic, and very enjoyable. Who says old styles can't be fun? Great job SN and CCB! Best yet out of the pack."

"Overall, I’m a Cigar City fan and I’m way too excited to try this whole collaboration pack, I think the Beer Camp was extremely well executed this year. 12 different collaborations plus a bonus DIPA if you can find it sold separately, my case was a meager $46 bucks for 2 of each. My buddy wvsabbath is getting half the case so it cost us $23 bucks to try 12 new beers!!!"
""
""
""
"Cigar City and Sierra Nevada nailed it. Tropical Maibock; exactly as described."
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer, a bit boozy, though nothing particularly offensive about it. Not something I have a desire to drink again."
""
""
"O- not a bad beer, nothing outrageously special, and at over $2 a can (12 pack was $26) not sure I'd go out of my way for again, but the mouth feel and body are worth experiencing."
""
""
""
"O: it certainly comes across as juicy and tropical thanks to some special hop strains. A drier, more highly attenuated approach may have helped. It stays very sweet and has that substantial and filling feel as it sits in the mouth and finally rests solidly in the stomach. I guess I had something lighter and more crushable in mind, but this is more of a staunch, big-boned bock. It still works."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer in my opinion. I am ready for another!.... unfortunately I don't have another. Onwards to another Beercamp!"
"O: Was happy with this beer. Despite it being 7.7% it seems like you could knock back a few of these and be happy. Definitely grew in complexity as it warmed which changed it from a nice bock into something a little better."
"Couldn't help but think of cigars when smelling this beer. First, it looks like it was aged in cherry oak barrels-if they existed. Very big head which could have stayed around longer. It's darker than I expected, but sexy because it's exotic (A= 3.75). The aroma was an enchanting mix of tropical spices and fruits. Very spicy and and rich malt, but lively from pineapple (S=4) Good rich malts clash with prickly pineapple, bitter pine, grapefruit. It's sweetness takes after banana phenols. Cinnamon, cloves, and hay round out the palate. F off with the what you think a maibock should taste like; it was delicious and phenomenally flavorful for a lager (T=4.5). Superfine carbonation, velvety smooth, and lots a good amount of alcohol warmth (M=5)."
""
""
""
"Golden amber colored beer with a thin head. Smell is just very boozy and not all the great. Taste is sharp fruitiness , some pina colada flavors, other light fruits and some looming alcohol heat. Some toasty flavors. Overall one of the better and more memorable beers in the beer camp this year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its medium body carries a bready and sweetened taste deep into the session, slow to release but eventually succumbing to the hop spice, minty-warm alcohol and toasted character to give some semblance of crispness."
"Well, dang it. I just don't have the nose for guava, I guess."
"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a crystal clear, caramel coloring, with a dense, foamy, white head. Nose of roasted caramel, tart apple, and hops resin. Interesting. Flavors are very fruity forward, with a blend of pineapple, mango, and melon, all on a bready backbone. Rich sweetness throughout, with a tangy, fruit salad aftertaste. The finish is slick, with a tangy, sweet linger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This is an interesting brew, for sure, because it’s not as brassy and bitter (and certainly not as “noble”) as you’d expect from the style, but obviously Sierra Nevada and Cigar City were going for something different. They ended up with a smooth, full-ish amber beer with some bock characteristics (smooth body, mellow but kinda-sorta full malt presence, not too estery but not neutral) and some AIPA characteristics (tropical hop flavor). In any event, it’s quite good. And, bonus points for that head. Purists might get all in a tizzy, but this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall all this is another very good beer from this unique 12 pack. This is my 500th review."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz. can served in a shaker pint. Pours a dull amber with a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, 1/8th inch off-white head. Nose expresses toffee, spice and fruit (mango and guava?). Consistent with nose, but not a fan - guava jelly and a peppery character. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation just shy of lively and a slight stickiness; perhaps a bit thin. Overall - an interesting concept, but I'm not a fun."
""
""
"Poured into a flute glass like a boss. The beer pours a pretty fluffy off white head that takes a long time to dissipate and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The beer itself is a clear light brown color with very dark orange notes to the point where it looks pretty brown. The smell is a combination of caramel sweetness with bready yeast smell. The smell also has some very light hop notes and tiny bit of alcohol but not much to make a difference. The beer taste is similar to the smell. The taste has the same sweetness and bread taste to it but the hops are much stronger and more tropical fruit. Although, at times, the tropical can be a little too sweet. However, the combination of the notes is fairly unique. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky at the end, but is overall smooth and medium bodied with biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty good collaboration, but it did not do much for me. However, I do recommend getting it."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is full, slightly sticky. Overall, it's not bad. I don't get much of the fruit out of it."
"O - Very different but it works. The alcohol is non-existent and I could drink a few of these."
""
"The second beer I've popped out of the beer camp box, did the two cans first. The color is off the charts, almost like orange Kool Aid. The balance is nice,. but it's called a tropical maibock for a reason. Wow - loads of citrus on top of an oily malt backbone. Like biting into fresh fruit. The cans have both been great... on to the bottles."

"The malt body has a dominating presence, it's sweet and hearty but works in contrast to the tropical hops. A little too sweet for me initially but upon revisiting (another day, another can of this) I found it much more to my liking."
""

""
""
""
""

"12oz can. Pours a semi tranlsucent reddish brown with a half inch of thick head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is a mix of tropical fruits, as expected. Pineapple, guava and mango. Some bready notes as well as hints of earth. The taste is more breadiness than the aroma indicated along with some caramel and earth. A lot more malt flavor than hops. There is some of that tropical fruit flavor but it is very light. Finishes with more malts and earth. Medium bodied. A bit disappointed with this one. I didn't expect it to be an IPA or anything, but by the name I was expecting to get more tropical fruits. It was there in the aroma but very subdued in the taste. Overall, alright."

"12 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 6/4/2014. Pours slightly hazy orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings down on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, mango, guava, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, tropical/floral hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, guava, mango, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast eathiness. Fair amount of earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, guava, mango, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, tropical/floral hops, yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/hop balance with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy maibock style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, tropical hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Not a bad beer but not a favorite by far."

"My first Cigar City beer. I have been wanting to try for a while. This beer was a very good maibock, I have only had two until now, but I will have to say that I do not detect all the flavors expressed on the can. Nevertheless, this is a very good beer, I would buy more of this beer for the style. I would not pay the same price for a 12 pack, but what we are doing is trying different styles in a gimmick, which seems to be the way things are going at the moment in the craft beer world. I did enjoy this beer as much or more than any of the others, I would love to get my hands on other Cigar City beers, maybe one day..."
"O - I am not a fan. Some people may like this one, but I can't take much more. Great carbonation and length of finish, but this isn't for me. Better luck on the next one."

"Overall: This is the beer I was most looking forward to in the 12 pack (besides the Torpedo Pilsner) and it is almost everything it is advertised - a tropical Maibock, although it is bordering on India Pale Lager territory. Maybe it's the association between the two brewers, but this tastes like a cross between Sierra Nevada Torpedo and Cigar City Jai Alai to me, which are two, at times, overly malty IPAs in my opinion. I like this, but if I had to change anything, I would like to see this brewed with paler malts and slightly less final alcohol by volume (and by taste)."
""
""

"O: great beer; has a bit of a zesty bite/smell when it's cold and changes to be more sweet as it warms; nice tropical component which compliments the malts exceptionally well"
""

""

"Orange tinted amber colored to the beer. Gentle pour yielded a fluffy cap. Awesome aroma that streams out of the glass. Best component of the beer. Taste is a good balance of sweet malt with a little hop bite. Weird vegetal note mid palate turned me off this beer. If this beer came in a six pack I doubt I would buy it."
""
""
""
""
"Can from sierra nevada beer camp box. Pour red amber with off white head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is amazing, guava and tropical fruit with pine and sweet malt.  Flavor is sweet with a touch of roast and a slight bitter finish.  Dark fruit is evident.  If collaborations count, this is my second cigar city beer. Very tasty."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but I am not getting any distinct tropical fruit aromas or flavors from this one."

"This pours out a dark copper-amber color with small, very white head atop it. Despite the talk about exotic hops on the label, I don't really get any but the faintest of hop aromas of of this. The nose offers a little caramel malt, but it's pretty faint. The flavor is better, at least: bitterness comes through clearly and cuts some of the sweetness of the malt, which is a little caramel, a little bready. I'm not getting a lot of hop flavor out of this either. It tastes like a generic bock you'd get at a generic brewpub. It's not bad per se, but not an interesting one."

"Overall- Solid, good beer. Maybe even a little better. A nice take on the style. Definitely worth a try."

"This nice beer works. Too bad there is only one per box, but I did buy two boxes (but everything in them has been nicely done)."
""
""
"a nice bock here, but im not sure what makes it tropical. the label suggests fruits in it, but i think thats more tasting notes than an ingredient list, and if im wrong, than the tropical fruit part of this is extremely minimal really. there is a curious zestiness in with the toffee malt sweetness in the middle of this that seems to last a really long time, like both the start and finish are quick, but the middle takes for ever, extended play. i cant readily attribute it to fruit though, and think a funky lager yeast or warmer fermentation temperatures may rather be the cause of this feature. nice dense malt body though made lighter by the lager yeast and the exuberant carbonation. its different than other examples of the style, which i certainly always appreciate, but it lacks a real defining tropical feature for me, and while i liked the beer itself quite a bit, i was looking for a little more with this one. something special and really distinct in terms of flavor, but that never comes. i have seen a lot of the other beers in this box comes under similar criticism, but i think this one deserves it maybe a little more than the others. still delicious on all counts though, and always nice to get something from cigar city in colorado."

"Overall: Even though some unorthodox hopping was used, it I fairly subdued, meaning that this mostly comes across as a standard Maibock with an interesting extra layer. However, it is a damn fine Maibock."

"Overall - Pretty delicious, and a nice twist on the traditional maibock style. One of two cans found in the variety pack, and it's one of the better beers from the pack thus far."

"O - I expected great things from this collaboration, and it delivered. I did not expect how well the traditional German nutty malt compliments the tropical fruit flavors from the hops. Cigar City is the preeminent brewery in the country for this type of hop profile, and this beer is no exception. Wish there was more than one of these in the box!"

"12 ounce can, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a mug, the beer pours a slightly hazy copper color with about a couple inch off-white head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like toffee, caramel, honey, and some tropical fruit. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some dark fruit (cherries, raisins), bready malt, apples and nuttiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. I liked this, it's an interesting take on a Maibock."

"There is an odd sweetness erupting from the dankness of the overripe fruit character and plenty of caramel, barley, and toffee. Seems like there is an alcohol bite. Finishes mildly dry."

"So far I am a huge fan of the Beer Camp Across America by Sierra Nevada and friends. This one was no different. The appearance was a nice golden orange hue with a fizzy head. The smell was a lot of hops with a little bit of creamy sweetness on the nose. The taste was very complex from the hops they use which give a smooth sweetness to the brew. You get flavors of guava and other South American fruits."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pokal a rich deep bronze with a nice tightly formed sticky white head that lasted for almost the duration.Lighter aromas with some light caramel and toast,the tropical fruits were light but were noticable after it warmed.Caramel butteriness mixed with tropical fruitiness stood out most on the palate with some drying and toast in the finish,it never got overly sweet.A pretty good first try of the Beer Camp pack,different in a good way."

"Very interesting beer- ""tropical"" bock is a great description. Beautiful pour, nut brown with a nice head that fades too quickly. Really nice marriage of malty bock with juicy tropical fruit notes and an earthy bitterness at the end. The interplay of pineapple and guava with the malty notes of the bock is nice, and the bitterness really snaps it all back so that the beer doesn't become cloying. I like this one quite a bit."
""
""

"O- I wouldn't have expected it, but this is really nice. A refreshing kind of beer with good balance of acidy hops and sweet tropical fruit."

""
""
""
"Poured a nice clear, deep amber orange with three fingers of fluffy off-white head that receded to a one finger off-white head that stuck around, eventually giving way to a cap of off-white foam that left abundant lacing down the glass. A very nice looking beer. Scents of tropical fruit, including notes of passion fruit, mango, pineapple and hints of guava, hints of lightly toasted malt and caramel with a faint presence of alcohol in the background. A very nice aroma profile, strong in tropical fruit aromas as advertised but with a traditional maibock character present in the background. Very appealing. Flavor begins malty sweet, with bready malt flavors mingling with slight hints of toasted malt, notes of tropical fruit and a slight bit of alcohol and a medium-low bitterness level with slight floral hop flavors. This moves into a middle that rich in bready malt sweetness, with notes of mango and noticeable alcohol presence. Finish is medium-dry with flavors of bready and especially toasted malt balanced by earthy and floral hop flavors and alcohol. Aftertaste is toasted malt and a slight bitterness. A fairly good flavor profile, not as tropical as the aroma but certainly present with a nice balance of sweet malt and earth, floral hops. Quite nice and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and semi-drying with low carbonation. This makes it quite easy to drink. Overall this is a pretty good twist o. The maibock style. The aroma is uniquely tropical with a more traditional maibock flavor that still contains a tropical presence and a mouthfeel that is quite pleasant. A pretty nice offering and worth trying."

"O: Not a bad brew, but nothing mind blowing. Nothing I’d necessarily need to drink again."

"Clear amber pour with an off-white head. Aroma is light malt with tropical fruit. Flavor has a strong malt presence with a slightly astringent bitterness around mid-taste. The fruit gets lost and doesn't really stand out as expected from the description. Finishes dry."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark gold, almost red hazy brew, kicked up about an inch of fluffy white head that dissipated to about a quarter inch, nice retention. Aroma was sweet malt, caramel and toffee, with some spicy hoppy notes. Also got a little bit of mango or something tropical on the back end. The taste was caramel, and sweet bready malt, with just a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel was smooth, nice lingering on the back of the palate. Overall, this a pretty nice beer, although I expected a little more fruitiness, since it was a ""tropical"" Maibock."

"Golden amber with a sticky, craggy foam cap that hangs around. Big chunks of lace. Smells of caramel and mango with a hint of grapefruit. Taste is creamy right off the bat. Lightly mango and citrus pith, there is caramel and biscuit cracker crust. It seems mildly bitter and just a bit sweet at the same time. Very interesting. Great balance. Medium body and as I mentioned a creamy mouthfeel. Excellent brew with a nice complexity of flavor but maintaining that maibock quaffability."
