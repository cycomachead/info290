"Very tasty bock .Nice hop notes for a bock"
""
"Undated bottle into pint glass.  Pours a clear, deep gold with an eggshell white head.  Moderate carbonation.  Malty, slightly bitter - almost a perfect balance between malt and hops - neither dominates.  Medium, smooth mouthfeel.  Really nice, clean finish.  I wish this weren't a seasonal!"

"I'm not a fan of the darker sweeter bock beers, but this one is wonderful."

"The flavor profile is near world class.  It is intense, rather complex and fairly well balanced.  A bit more malt sweetness to balance the hops would yield a world class flavor rating.  It begins with herbal hop flavor over a mild biscuit sweetness.  As the middle approaches, light caramel notes emerge.  The middle brings a mild bitterness over a slight mineral like note.  The finish is a slow fade into biscuit and bitterness over a mineral note that is somewhat dry and crisp."

"O: Cultivator is a good brew which could use a little more careful fermentation to miss that mid-palate fruitiness and this would be superb. As it is, it is still very enjoyable drinking."
""

""
"Very good no bite at all"
""
"D: overall a very tasty helles bock. blond, malty, enough hops to provide presence and bitterness."
""
""
""
"Overall- Outstanding beer and forerunner of a not so common style. Too bad this isn't a year round offering. Great blend of malt/citrus/hops flavors. A must try Spring seasonal here!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is crisp and color is great, smells like a frog pond"
"Mmm . . . Tasty. Not surprised, but always amazed by Troegs. For me, they are one of those breweries that never seem to disappoint. Terrific spring seasonal. Good job guys and keep the new stuff coming."
"Cheers!!"
""
"Overall an excellent Maibock. The fruit, spiciness, light bitterness make the beer very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel. Really good mouth feel. I wouldn't describe it as especially smooth or creamy, but it was more thick than thin and definitely pleasant to drink."
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours deep golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of grassy hops, bready malt and hint of alcohol.  Body is full and crisp.  Taste is of sweet biscuit malt balanced by grassy hops and drying alcohol. Finish is long, dry.  Good warming brew."

"Taste is bready light malts and the hops finally comes through, but a little more bitterness would have been nice. Some sips I got a little hops bite in the back of my throat but not others. Not sure what to really think comparing to other bocks I have had. It's easy-drinking but could use a bit more hops and alcohol to really bring out the flavor. Overall a good session beer but not really a ton of flavor going on. Would be a good breakthrough beer to offer your MillerBudCoors drinking friends."
""
"Pours a nice deep gold, effervescent with a long-lasting fizzy white head. The aroma is mild and malty, with biscuit notes and backed up with hints of earthy hops. The taste is a little bit more robust, with all the aroma factors present but a little more distinct. The body has a nice weight to it and a clean crisp finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delicious Maibock. This may not be the boldest style out there, but this is an excellent beer."
""
"Overall, a very good beer, and one I recommend picking up."
""
""
""
"It finishes clean and dry. An excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"As some others have said you get a lot of pilsner flavor, with some citrus as well, mostly lemon to me.  Solid beer, pretty refreshing for something that has little hop profile."
"O: expected some hop bitterness and a dry finish; very good none the less;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste of fresh baked bread with yeasty undertones up front. Lively carbonation keeps flavors moving. It has a bitter lemon citrus hop middle rounding out with a biscuity malt mouth feel and ends dry with a floral hop bite."

"03/27/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nice & smooth. Slight bitterness. Lacing on the thick side. At the top end of my hop threshold, which is pretty low by today's standards. I like it, but one is enough."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2/6/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep gold color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, toast, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, toast, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, toast, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean flavor profile as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Helles bock! All around great balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth, clean, and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Verdict: A very nice spring lager from Tröegs, quite refreshing and enjoyable. The balance is nice and the hop character, even after a few months since release, is impressively balanced without being too bitter."
""
"When I poured this beer, it has a golden color body with a small head and lacing. The aroma has a floral hop smell to it with a little malt also. The taste has the hops coming first with a lightness floral flavor, then a little maltyness comes to the party. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a really nice, spring beer."
"One of the things that I like about really pale and really dark beers is how well the pseudo-cascade can be seen, thanks to the contrast. The liquid roiled and rolled around and slowly began to settle into around three fingers of dense, slightly rocky bone-white head with great retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = > 5, "

"Overall, this is a nice beer to have on a warm summer evening. 6.9, but very drinkable. I'm not one for bocks, too many other styles I much prefer, but this was enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a style I am starting to enjoy more. You should be able to drink this year round."

"Light copper amber, touches of foam. Mild helles nose, pilsy. Mild lager like taste, bitter layers cascade throughout. Smooth but with residual bitter. Long finish. Balances. Smooth and flavorful."
""
""
"O- solid maibock, crisp refreshing, at 7% you don't notice at all, reslly enjoying this nice spring beer"
""
""
"Overall: this a great interpretation of an German style beer. and a great beer in general. Bravo!"

"Simple beer that is good for its style and hit the spot. Clearish gold body with well-carb'd, fizzy two finger head that dies quick with minor lace patches on top of aroma that is a little bit of soapy, dirty hops and some grainy malts with that bread/cracker edge that seems to be a familiar descriptive term. The basic taste is a dry, cracker-like graininess but the balance is there from some floral hops so this doesn't turn into some American macro crap. The hops give off minor citric and the malts seem to have a touch of sweetness to them. Easy to drink and refreshing and you can't ask for much more."

"O- another winner from troegs. I wish this one would go into the anthology pack in the spring."
""
"This is a nice offering from Troegs. It's ultimately a pretty clean beer, just like most of their beers. Maybe I'm not blown away, but I like it and the craftsmanship is pretty impressive. Good beer."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with great head retention and lacing. Smells of German/Bavarian hops (haven't verified if these were actually used, but the scent reminded me of this), light malts, floral notes and fresh-cut grass. Taste has slight hop bitterness, slightly bready, with a semi-creamy mouthfeel. Mostly clean finish- there's a slight lingering hop presence on the palate. This is really a fantastic well-rounded beer and a great stateside example of the Maibock/Helles Bock style, perfect for spring. I will be searching this out again."
""
""
"Very, very impressed with this beer. This reminds of a good German helles bock, and in fact might be the best domestic version I can ever recall sampling. Absolutely delicios stuff."

"It's good to see another well-made Maibock hit the shelves in the spring, something to fill the gap left behind when Sierra Nevada's Glissade went away."
""
""
""
""
"Clean Helles with a nice malty and European hop feel. Drinks very easily, as it should, without any major off flavors or flaws."
"Pours a light golden color with a soapy white head and lacing. Aroma is very floral and pine like with bready undertones. In the taste, floral and bitter, with a sweet honey baked bread malt flavor. Well balanced and easily approachable, this golden bock is best enjoyed in a warmer climate. The body is on the light side of medium with a solid carbonation. Overall, this hits the spot when you're looking for a easy drinking lager with a firm hoppy finish."
"O: I've only had two of this style before, one was a sample and the other was Dead Guy out of their retail growlers, but that was ages ago before I was actually into beer since it was for a friend who shared some with me. This beer has really surprised me and is very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I haven't had many of the style. It's fairly tame but it grew on me. Glad only got a single, though. Not sure I would really love to put away several of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent Helles Bock! Delicious, full flavored, bready, sweet, robust without a hint of alcohol despite the 6.9% alc./vol. A damn near perfect beer and absolutely perfect for these last bitter cold days of March."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice spring seasonal, fits the changing of seasons perfectly."
""
"Overall a simple easy going beer I would probably get a six pack of but so far have only found cases of it for 34 dollars. Damn Pennsylvania..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I definitely like this beer since it is a nicely drinkable helles bock. It is a good solid tasty brew that I'll return to again and get another case of next year."
""
""
"D - An outstanding lager... I've had several of these and am really impressed by this offering from Troegs... Not just a good Maibock, but also a really outstanding brew regardless of stye... It is proof that beers don't need to be hop bombs nor imperial stouts to be really good beer... I could easily segue from a case of Nugget Nectar into a case of Cultivator to start each year... A very nice and welcome addition to the Troegs portfolio of offerings..."
"Overall this was a solid offering. Clean appearance golden in color. Nose gives off hints of floral hops and touch of lemon, some sweetness. Taste good, would prefer if I saved this for sunny spring day, can taste the floral hops as well as some bready sweetness and a touch of citrus to it. Good spring feeling sort of beer with clean finish and a spicy touch. Smooth mouthfeel. 6.9 where? Would get again. Bring back next year!"

"Troegs has again made a flawless and classic beer."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is another winner from Troegs! A well balanced Mai bock which I will drink again."
""
"Great maibock. Recommended."
"O- A well made beer and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall OK, a bit of a sulfury note, decent hops, malts are pretty nice but not great, lager notes are nice, drinkable but not great."
""
"A real neat and fun beer. Love the bocks from Troegs and this one delivers."
"o. - Very, very good beer. Troegs continues to set a standard."
"...yep, dead-on about this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, really easy to drink with nice flavors. Balanced, each flavor works well, and this has a tremendous light, herbal finish."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some maltiness is present. Taste is malts, some sweetness, a bit of hops as well, easy drinking for the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"I don't quite understand why this is called a Bock or a Maibock. It tastes absolutely nothing like a German Maibock. The hoppiness reminds me of an IPA. It is nonetheless a very good, drinkable beer. However, I think it should be categorized as something else."
"The alcohol was part of that as well. While not a session beer, I could have easily downed another bottle in this sitting. It was nicely hidden and only when I finished this could I feel a slight buzz, in a good way. Like the Nugget Nectar, this beer was made for the transition from winter to spring and would fare well in either season and also like that staple, will only get better as it ages and the accompanying weather outside warms up. Another solid offering from Troegs that fits in with their existing portfolio beautifully. Wholeheartedly recommended."
""
""
"O - A pretty solid maibock all things considered. A bit more hoppy than a traditional example but that was what they were going for here. I will definitely enjoy a few more of these once it warms up some more."
""
""
"O: Troegs has crafted a great helles lager here. It's on the bigger side, but it remains very drinkable and balanced. A great offering that fits well as a spring seasonal. I'd probably be enjoying it more if there wasn't still half a foot of snow on the ground in March."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fluffy and creamy, this beer is delicately smooth in its light body as well as being crisp, firmly so without having to bite too hard."
""
""
"At 6.9% abv, has the character of a larger beer. Way to go Troegs, they do a great bock. The essence of Spring."
"Experience: from the pour this beer reminds me of spring. Light golden color, crisp bread-like lemon smell and taste with a clean sweet floaral finish. I feel this would be great on a warm spiring day, or any day fr that matter."
""
"The nose does seem to scream German beer to me, but the overall taste is a bit thicker in sweetness than I would like."
""
""
""
"O: More substantial than your average bock, this would be perfect for cool spring days. Looking forward to those...still freezing my butt off."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another fine brew from Troegs that is very different than what they normally do. Keep up the good work."
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather sweet, but still just enough hopped and balanced Helles Bock. Due to the thicker body and big sweeter and bready flavors, it is a rather slow drinker all while only at 6.9 % abv."
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable new brew with a nice malt forward flavor. Looking forward to the rest of the series."
""
"O: My second maibock in three days, not a huge hops fan, but these were light enough to where it was enjoyable. Great drinkability."
"O- I really like the balance, the flavor and the drinkability. This one definitely follows the trend of hoppy lagers, but is very nicely done and shows it's bock roots."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very easy drinking and tasty maibock. Would like to get more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty unique and enjoyable helles bock. It is dominated by the floral hops and earthy malts which makes the name and theme of the beer quite fitting. I was excited when I first saw that Troegs was doing another bock, and this did not dissapoint. I'll definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
"This beer is clear bright orange. Great head and retention. Not much scents going on. Almost macro smelling dare I say it. I really like the flavor of this beer. Has a Hells lager flavor profile with a little more sweetness and a little more hop finish than most German contemporaries. This is a fine beer by Troegs. This also is the best Helles Bock I've sampled to date. I will definitely look to buy more of this one."
"Super-crisp, super-refreshing, and well balanced. This is an awesome Maibock that hides the alcohol well."

"Notes:  In 2015, I've also had the Sierra Nevada Hoppy Lager, which is much more hop forward and dank than this brew."
""
"Golden orange body beautifully filtered with a big white head chunky textured billowing above the rim of my pint glass. Aroma has bread yeast, biscuit malt, herbal earthy grass hop notes this is a nice smelling helles bock so far. Cereal grains, honey biscuit malts, grassy herbal hop finish this is a perfect beer borders on the sweetness of other high gravity lagers like malt liquors maybe a touch of green apple, but no residual sticky sweetness at all this is great beer tried and true. This reminds me of a version I had years ago the Penn Maibock on a kick the keg night at Fuel and Fuddle the drafts of Penn Maibock were marked down to 2 dollars and the whole bar was drinking this classic style with big smiles and laughter abound. Everybody had fun even if we were over indulging that night!!! Sugary glazed biscuit malts bring the flavor together with a nutty apple character in the malt department, again I love this beer, carbonation is full on and built into such said beer. Overall this beer brings back memories of a better time in the beer scene when Penn Maibock, Stoudt's Maibock, and Victory St. Boisterous tuned into the beer drinking scene also Sierra Nevada recently d/c'd their famous helles bock that was once a seasonal."
"Overall, a very good representation of the style a little sweeter with a lingering mouthfeel, but the malt and hop mix is very good. Glad Troegs came out with a great maibock."
""
""
"A good representation on the style. Not a phenomenal beer, but still tasty and will be easy to drink once spring officially arrives and some of the snow we have been having waaay too much of this year is gone."
"Overall: Beautiful looking beer which certainly highlights the hops used with a great balance finish. I liked it, and I would buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: I don't know this style well so I can't say if this is a good representation of the style or not. I sure liked it though."
" The taste is as good as the other qualities mentioned above yet there is a smooth grain flavor with light sweet maltiness and gentle German yeast flavor in the middle with floral hop and mild alcohol in the finish which is relatively dry. Overall I consider this a pretty high quality helles bock for the style, very drinkable yet enough strength to hold true with the original ...very drinkable example with nice balance."
""
"Was able to try this before it was officially released. Clear orange-amber body, medium sized white head, sparse lacing. Fresh baked bread, lemon, morning toast, grainy cereals, some DMS in the nose. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, lingering mild sweetness."
