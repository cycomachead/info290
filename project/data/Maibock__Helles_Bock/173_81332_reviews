"One of my favorites while spending time at Hair of the Dog, very fruity and refreshing taste, by far the lightest looking beer I had tried. Tastes of very sweet fruits, a little bit of citrus, and very smooth hiding the alcohol. Goldish cloudy color but brighter and thinner looking than usual. Very satisfying, tried in a flight sampler."

"The toasted grain character on the palate does make this beer unique. Less sweet than most, there's a blend of toffee, grain, honey and toast. The midpalate has a moderate hoppiness, mildly earthy and a touch minty. Mildly sweet on the finish, this beer is outstandingly soft and creamy on the palate. Very nice stuff."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"A nice enough beer, but given the other options at the tasting room, it's kind of hard to imagine ordering this again."

"A very well done Maibock. Easily my favorite I have tried of the style, and something I hope is brewed regularly."
"This was a real tasty maibock. Nice and refreshing with nice depth on both the aromas and feel."

"O - Very different flavors here but they are very very welcoming. Glad I caught this fruity, citrusy one on tap."
"O: Quite the lager, and certainly not what you might expect heading in, even if it is a maibock, particularly where it comes to the heaviness of the beer. There's a really good mesh between the nose and the tongue, and I'm sure this is going to be a regular on my visits to the taproom assuming it's not a one-off."

"What surprised me the most about this beer was how full the body was... after a few Blue-Dots I expected this one to go down like water... it was very full bodied and had a very nice earthiness taste to it... quite unique (as is all HOD beers). I'm no expert in the style but this was excellent! Very glad I got to try/add this one to the database..."
