The transition into the maltier profile is quite pleasant. Don't let the label fool you, this is pretty good.","TheSSG","Nov 04, 2014"

Taste is respectable, clean, light but malty. Could improve on the yeast character, which is very light. I've noticed in general about Dundee's German style beers that they are clean and drinkable but don't have much delicious yeast funk. Mouthfeel is clean. Overall decent and the 12 pack was only $10, so it was very reasonable.","chicagoabbot","Sep 24, 2011"
3.82,12,3,3.5,4,4,4,"The head on this beer was 1 and a half fingers thick in a glass mug. It left long wide strands of lacing. There was a moderate amount of carbonation. The color was amber. I could read the label on the beer through the full mug. It had a nicely ballanced hoppy and malty smell. The mouth feel was somewhat creamy with a sticky afterfeel. There was a slightly sour aftertaste.","BeerBuggy","Sep 16, 2011"
3.57,4.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Yup, another gift from my brother. This one pours a clear jaundiced canary topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises dusty biscuit, light toffee, light orange zest, mild flowers, and grass. The taste picks up the fruit baton and bolts, emphasizing the erstwhile mousy orange and adding some light lemon zest, light melon, and a heaping helping of banana. There's also a decent amount of caramel, lightly buttered biscuits, light black pepper, and even a pinch of clove. It's all a bit much all of a sudden, and it all sorta disappears at the end, but it's not at all bad. The body is a rather light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a nearly drying finish. Overall, not a bad helles bock by any stretch. I'll admit, I'm a bit surprised by it, as it's nothing special to look at and keeps some shady company, but I'll never turn down a beer like this.","TMoney2591","Aug 11, 2011"

Actually this reminds me of a Samuel Adams beer... which to me is a good thing. I can tell this has a thicker and creamy feel to it than their other beers simply because its a lager. This tells me they know how to make a good lager. Get this beer in their mix packs. Dundee again makes some of the cheapest best craft beer I've had.","thebrood1987","Jul 25, 2011"

3.62,6.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Another beer left at my house by someone. This one pours golden with a thin head. A constant stream of tiny bubbles. Nice enough aromas of caramel and toasty malt, a bit on the sweet side. The taste actually starts out quite nice, with more of that caramel and malt flavors, some toastiness, and a somewhat bready sweetness, but it falls off a bit towards the end.

Color was a deep golden-yellow of a shade that would have made Midas envious and with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty sweet, just as advertised. Mouthfeel was big and full with a honey-like taste on the tongue. Finish was silky smooth and even somewhat dry, as though the fermentation had fully converted the available sugars. This was entirely smooth, to the point that half of it was gone and I was barely aware of it. I would not want a steady diet of it, nor would it be very appropriate in the summer, but on a chilly evening in early March with Spring just a few weeks away, it was perfect.","woodychandler","Mar 02, 2011"

Aromas are typical maibock: predominantly sweet, grainy, maybe a hint of caramel, little in the way of hops. First thing I notice is not the taste but the body, which is considerably heftier than I expected. Comes across as medium-full, and this would be a good thing if only the flavors had the strength to keep pace. Unfortunately, the flavors are highly subdued. Tastes of lightly sweet grains with maybe a hint of woodiness; neither note is strong enough to be appreciated or warrant further contemplation.

Head eventually settles into a broken skim with some thin bands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Definitely smells like a Maibock - toasted malt, light fruity esters and a trace of toffee and biscuit notes. Taste is somewhat bland - a little bit of citrus comes across and drowns out the light fruit in the nose. A little bit of malt comes across the backbone, but the toasted quality and biscuity notes drop off. There is a hint of caramel that lingers at the finish, but it ends all too clean.

Aroma has a touch of citrus and some fruity phenols mostly a bit of green apple, with other cereal notes peeking through. Grassy herbal hops in the background pretty muted. Flavor a sweet honey coated biscuit malt profile with some rough graininess and harsh metallic notes. There's a rounded touch of green apple tartness flowing with some of those herbal hops I mentioned. Mouthfeel is medium bodied especially for a lager, carbonation was inoffensive nothing big to report here.

I guess I've just run across too many regional breweries that use the term bock, and then deliver a thin ghost of the style. On the other hand, there is a bit of tradition to that... breweries would often add coloring to their regular lagers in spring and call them bocks. This, however, is nothing like that. It's got a deep amber-orange color at about 12 SRM, and a fairly long-lasting creamy cap off off-white. The nose is caramelish, grainy and bready with a thread of spicy and floral hops in the background. The mouth feel is a dextrinous medium-full, and its moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation leaves it smooth across the palate. The flavor is again, caramelish, grainy, bready, and gently toasty. A stiff bitterness runs through it, appearing at the middle, and balancing it into and through the drying finish. Herbal and spicy hops appear at the swallow, and then help to dry it in the long lingering finish. A very nice example of the helles style. Well-brewed and balanced towards drinkability.

Taste is of some crystal malts, a touch of hop spicyness in the finish, and a lager character throughout. I noticed a surprising amount of alcohol in this brew considering its only 6.2% ABV. In the finish there is a flavor that seems to be a combination of spicy hops and has an overwhelming lager character that I find very unpleasant and the alcohol flavor doesn't help.

Alcohol is well hidden and there's a suggestion of leafy hop in the finish along with a nice balancing bitterness.

Semi-dry aftertaste, with some degree of residual sweetness, but an ample carbonation keeps the medium bodied beer crisp and lively. Finishes toasty and rich with malt flavor and a light apple ester in the background. J.W.

3.21,-5.9,3.5,2.5,3,4,4,"Drinkability is this beers strength, don't really consider a bock taste-wise. The ABV helps to mask some astrigency & sweetness I found annoying in their honey brown., worth a try, just please don't tell me this your favorite bock!?!!!???!","russpowell","Apr 07, 2006"
3.75,10,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"The mouth is a trifle thin but is still manages to be a bit creamy. Easy enough drinker, would be easy to session. Another nice, inexpensive offering from High Falls!","Redrover","Apr 06, 2006"
3.06,-10.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Well, to start with, this ones an attractive beer. Its an extremely clear golden beer with a slight copper accent. Nice head: puffy and white, lasting, and lace-producing. The aroma is a little underwhelming: very faint, lightly toasted malt, and thats about it. Theres none of the multi-dimensional caramel flavors or Munich-malt temptations. Appropriately, theres almost no hop presence. Its got a faint bready sweetness, and a firm, medium-body mouthfeel. It holds together pretty well, but it seems a little dumbed-down in the flavor department. It seemed ordinary and un-interesting.","Suds","Mar 25, 2006"
3.58,5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pale malt scent that is a bit musty. There appears to be some malt sweetness, but it's very little. The taste is good. It has a grainy pale and carapils malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual sweetness. It also has a musty lager yeast aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. This isn't my favorite style, but this is a good drinker despite it.","WesWes","Mar 25, 2006"
4.07,19.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"First experience with this brew and was expecting pretty good results based on past experiences with High Falls. Always nothing extraordinary, a fair to good brew at a great price. This brew was not what I expected; I felt it was a excellent brew and a great price. Brew pours to a clear golden color that has amber highlights in it. Nice sized off-white head that breaks down somewhat slowly leaving a nice sheen of lace along the sides of the glass. The aromas are actually quite complex, rye bread like smell along with slight fruit like esters and a spicy hop scent. The taste is very nice, very similar qualities as expressed in the aromas of the brew. Very rich malt like flavor dominates but then the spiciness cuts through, finishing nicely. A very smooth brew, with the ABV at 6.2 I would imagine that this one could sneak up on you because it is very easy drinking, exceptional offering!","Stimack","Mar 19, 2006"
3.8,11.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I'm not a big fan of the style so truth be known I am biased to some extent! Drinkabilty for a 6+% abv is very good. A sixer may kill joe six pack if he isn't paying attention. Not something I would revisit on purpose but I wouldn't say no to it on tap locally or at a friend's house out of the fridge.","Ego","Mar 11, 2006"
3.68,7.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Tasting it, I find good bit of maltiness. It's sweet, and has a crisp finish. There's a good amount of carbonation that is refreshing as well. A bit sticky in the moutfeel. Perhaps the taste of prunes? Breadiness too. A lot more complicated than I thought was possible in a beer made by the brewers of ""Golden Anniversary"" and ""Genny Cream Ale."" A good surprise, not mind blowing, and as far as maibocks go, I prefer Dead Guy, but this is still satisfying.","Litterbean","Feb 21, 2006"
4.33,27,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Needless to say, I'm sorry I didn't buy a few sixers. It makes me re-think JWD's Pale. THIS is the beer I'll buy while it's available. If this was $6 it would still be a great buy. On the package, they mention a Hefe, IPA , and Scotch Porter are thier seasonals....bring em!","Ricochet","Feb 11, 2006"
4.25,24.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This offering from High Falls is very good. I got it in a sampler with the Amber, Pale Ale and Honey Brown. Beautiful color, a dark gold, with creamy but not excessive off white head. Some lacing. Very smooth and drinkable. The Saaz hops were noticable and to my taste might be a little weak. I really like the Saaz. Anyway, the Hops are there, but this is a malty beer, as it should be, and the balance is probably true to style. This is absolute proof that High Falls knows good beer. Truly enjoyable.","zsk","Jan 25, 2006"
4,17.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Review from notes: Sampled with the brewer and a bunch of BA's in Rochester, NY. This new brew from high falls is really something to appluad, a nic pale heller bock brewed for the masses as a high falls seasonal. I hear an ipa may follow, and than after that who knows!? Big kudos to Dave S for sharing and for brewing up some quality ""micros"" in the ""macro"" world! This one is very plae golden with an eggshell white head of frippy frothy foam that lasts and leaves some nice lacing as well. Aromas are freshly baked bread, bavarian pretzels, and more malt accented flavors as well as a bit of spicy floral German and US hops? Taste is sweet and bready but the sweetness is not overdone and the spicy hops do come in and balance everything nicely. This coupled with the simple medium bodied mouthfeel of this brew make it's drinkability good as well. So solid, it is like a rock, this isn't even my favorite style, but it is nailed here, and quite tasty. Drink up!","francisweizen","Jul 27, 2005"
4.07,19.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Suprisingly saw this on tap at Donnely's Public house in fairport(get it while you can). The bartender didn't really know what it was but i guess it is a test or something. Anyways i loved it. It is certainly pale as it pours a really light gold. The taste is sorta sweet but I think the hops are more dominant. Perfect amount of alcohol. Interesting brew, hopefully we will see it in the stores soon.","kbnooshay","Apr 30, 2005"
4.15,21.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5," As High Falls carries on through tests of this brew, I say ""Yes"" to this possible seasonal, and with any more luck, there's always the chance we'll see it next year!!","chilidog","Apr 01, 2005"
