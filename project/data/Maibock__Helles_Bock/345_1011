It seems highly generic and unlike a true maibock, with less body, sweetness, or strength to the malts. The sweetness that was there is erased and overpowered with bitterness, and ultimately this is a letdown for the style and for the brewery.","TheBrewo","Oct 12, 2011"

While this isn't Victory's best beer, I'll probably give it another go when spring arrives, just to see if it's any better the second time around.

3.47,-9.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The head crests over a finger of some of the loosest foam possible, big bubbles pop and evaporate swiftly, the foam barely coats the surface, zero lacing. No beads, just random huge bubbles, has a clean light golden color of a slight metallic cast. The nose is based in pretzel dough, black pepper, orange marmalade, peach, apricot, green apple fruit scents and caramel, noticeably sweet overall with a moderate hoppiness at most, produces cereal and granola notes as it opens, quite full nostril presence. Full-bodied, its plushness and generally weak carbonation undermines the pepper, grass and straw but it is not wimpy, simply sweeter than may be desired. Displays orange, tangerine to almost pink grapefruit pulp citrus. Layers on the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, sugary and close to dried fruit in nature. Still, feels obligated to add a bitter twist to the end, this in spite of a syrupy mouth texture. Overall, feels and tastes like a “normal” everyday lager sent to finishing school and made from higher quality ingredients.","farrago","Jul 12, 2011"

2.9,-24.5,3,3,2.5,4,3,"Victory St. Boisterous is a very clear yellow beer with a dense, white head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is fruity and a little wooden. It smells a little like Pinesol and spilled beer. There is an almost minty character to it. It's medium bodied and very smooth with a clean, dry finish. There's a little bit of chewiness or grit left on the teeth. It tastes a little boozy and twangy, like a malt liquor or a euro lager. Alcohol, lemon detergent and light grain are there, along with an herbal, wooden bitterness that surfaces at the finish. This just really isn't my thing. It seems like it wants to be refreshing but the alcohol flavor takes away from that.","yesyouam","Jun 30, 2011"
3.84,0,4,5,3,4,4,"I love the beer but when it is 85 degrees it is a bit heavy and a bit boozy. This isn't really what I consider a summer beer, heck even the St. on the bottle has a beard.","JTZimmerman","Jun 01, 2011"
4.2,9.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow - I just found a new go to summer/spring brew. At over 7% alcohol I cant believe how well done this brew is.

4.04,5.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"I swear Bill and Ron (Victory's brewmasters) majored in being German; they've emulated seemingly all German styles to perfection. Bocks are a style really easy to get wrong: they're easy to brew too sweet, too strong, not clean enough, not flavourful enough. You need really high-quality ingredients and a really thorough understanding of what you're doing - neither of which are ever a problem for this brewery. Watch Germany now try to annex Pennsylvania.","biegaman","Beers"

Alcohol in the front and back, just a tad too much for the style as it takes away from the lightness you would expect in a spring or summer beer. Other than the booze, nice hop bitterness that makes the mouthfeel crisp and clean, with a dry finish. Better on the colder side, as the booziness starts to take over as it warms. A little fruitiness in the flavor too, but it's in the background. Good beer though, love Victory and their use of hops.","chodinheaven","May 03, 2011"

The aroma is more grainy than anything else with a malty note thrown in on the side. The body is thin to medium but tolerable. The taste also comes across as grainy with a light but dry hop kick at the end.","puboflyons","Apr 17, 2011"
3.77,-1.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"While I'm not usually a fan of the darker Bock beers, this take on the Maibock or Helles bock is an exceptional substitute for the traditional American Lager. Rather than tailgating with a Budweiser (a name I use simply for reference to lager) I suggest going with a St. Boisterous. But be warned: The name is the truth, drink too many of these in the sun and you will, in fact, become quite Boisterous.","Samtoberfest","Apr 11, 2011"
3.63,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours from the 12oz. bottle a crystal clear light golden hue with a 1/2 finger head that settles into a collar of medium thickness. Carbonation is on the light side, not many bubbles visible. Aroma has a malty sweetness to it with a hint of citrus (lemon) with a hay/grass/straw note. 1st sip brings a dry hints of lemon, grass, a slightly metallic hop note, and some bready, biscuity yeast. Mouthfeel is light & refreshing, and there is little hint of the 7.4% alcohol. These would make a pretty good session beer. Overall, another very good beer from one of my favorite brewers.","CJfromPhilly","Apr 03, 2011"
3.98,3.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: Drinks like a champ. The key with the style is to get it fresh and this was bottles less than two weeks ago. It was almost 80 today so this really hit the spot.","aerozeppl","Apr 01, 2011"
3.68,-4.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Notes: This is my first beer experience form Victory, based in Pa, and I must say that it was a good first impression. I also enjoy the idea of a good Helles Bock, as it represents the coming of spring, and all the beer festivals that take place in Germany around that time. Compared to other Helles Bocks that I've tried such as Rogue Dead Guy and Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary, this stacks up pretty well.","thebeerisgood","Mar 31, 2011"

Crisp in mouthfeel with a good malt base and a passable hop presence but the booze comes across as stale and pestering.","JRed","Feb 04, 2011"

Not to heavy but definitely distinct. Taste adds a moderate bitter hop over a lightly sweet malt (has elements that remind me of honey). Not very good carbonation with lingering sediments which I found odd coming from Victory. Very flat, lacks head and lace.

The nose comprises buttery biscuits, orange zest, caramel, and a light smattering of flowers. The taste strikes a very nice balance between orange-laden citrus on the one hand and buttery bread and caramel on t'other. Good times. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a decidedly nice brew, something to kick back on a lazy autumn day.","TMoney2591","Oct 21, 2010"

A malty fragrance, with touches of bread and cracked grain, finishing with a mild feint scent of grass. Malt, malt and more malt is the dominant flavor, with bread and biscuit flavors. Those flavors last till the back end, when it finishes with a hop bitterness of grass and citrus, did I mention the malt. The consistent medium body lasts all the way through, it leaves a medium dryness at the end. This is really drinkable, the color and aroma are classic for the style. The taste is malty, more malty than I would prefer, but it takes nothing away from the flavor. Overall this is a great beer for spring and the summer heat.","cameraman","Beers"

While the nose is certainly quite mild, I get a lot of different fruit notes sneaking out from underneath the doughy exterior. The taste dials back on this a bit, and ends up being more of a sweet bread-type brew. However, for the style it style has quite a bit of nice flavor. The feel is nice, with a light to medium body that's slightly creamy. Overall, this is a very good American rendition of the style.","Thorpe429","0"

Big, malty flavor upfront, with a nice, creamy body followed by some bitterness on the back end that helps to cut the sweetness of the malt. The finish is lingering and somewhat woody and drinkability is very good. I discovered this on tap at the Tap & Mallet and ended up buying a few 6er's.

Bottle says full bodied and that is not false advertising. More creamy and heavy than I was expecting from this golden bock. Carbonation gives a crisp bite which is unexpected with the creamy mouthfeel. Bitterness is balanced out by the big malts. Drinkable for sure, probabaly not one I would session though.

A pretty balanced beer, although that balance might even mean a little bland. First is some spiciness and a touch of alcohol on the tongue, then the sweeter caramel and honey malt. Hops show up at the end and balance it out a little with an almost watery smoothness. Feel is medium, solid carbonation; maybe a little thin for my taste.

Frankly, I was amazed at the abv., as this beer is very light and drinkable, if not particularly interesting. The flavor became a bit more pronounced as it sat in the glass and warmed up, but utlimately this came across as a light, one dimensional, summer quaffing beer.

Not so much bitter, but tongue curling all the same. Malts are also huge and overly sweet like green grapes and biscuits. Honey-like sticky sweetness on the finish, the mouthfeel is syrupy and heavy.

The flavor starts with rich, bready german malt. More white bread toast than caramel, sweet but not overly so. Remarkably clean and well lagered. Zippy carbonation keeps the heavier body from feeling sluggish. Perhaps a hint of grassy esters. Very faint, if any. Softly hopped in the finish, a little dab of spicy, floral hop zest. Ends off with a crackle of carbonation, bread crumbs and vacant dryness on the tongue. Very good and drinkable, save for a bit of excessive burpiness from the carbonation. Begs for another sip.

Flavor is very focused towards pilsner malt sweetness, with a solid honey sweet maltyness. The toasted notes hit secondarily and this is followed quickly by a very mild bitterness that doesn't hang on very long at all. I think the sweetness is a little much, and the toasted notes could be a little stonger for my flavor. Feel is moderate, with a very mild carbonation. I like this beer.

4.12,7.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Anyway, pours without much of a head, a tawny, deep gold. Nose has a mild earthy twinge of hops but is decidedly sweet and herbal. Smooth and crisp with little carbonation, but with a mellow flavorful malty backbone to balance the grassy, sweet honey flavors. As I said before, the alcohol hides quite well in this one and can sneak up to your brain before you know it. A Spring seasonal indeed, but one that is quite refreshing desite the +7% ABV. An enjoyable sipper all summer long when one tires of the various wheats and lighter lagers.","IrishRedRock","Beers"

Taste follows the aroma with the sweet matiness dominating especially as it warms, there is again a hint of lemoniness and a little crisp-ness in the finish. Light to medium in body and fairly drinakble. I think I prefer this one on the colder side as it is a little more crisp, probably not refrigerator cold but as it warms to room temp the crispness definitely fades.","hoppymeal","0"

I was not prepared for the first sip, I thought I was getting a nice light beer, but the hop juice punched my teeth in as I stumbled back. Wow this is loaded with a great hop charater and is followed nicely with german malted grains with just a touch of alcohol.

Nice and very hellesbockish. Spicy hop edge up front on an otherwise malty sweet taste. Honey and vegetal malt sweetness, with flashes of sugar. Cooked vegetable twang/bitterness in the finish.

I dont know where the bock fits in, but this is a strong and tasty lager. After the initial sweetness, it gives way to bready malts. Not much for hops, but a very ncie beer.

The taste was crisp with sweet malt flavors dominating the front end of each sip. A bitter finish that was slightly floral rounded out the beer.

There was a noticeable acidic bite from the carbonation in the finish, as well as a light, spicy, alcohol warmth. Carbonation was just on the high side, made up of large, fizzy bubbles. Decent body.

A little bit of sweetness in the aroma, much more of a slightly bitter apple core and slushy cinnamon sweetend apple sauce that plays very well. Body is heavier, carbonation is at the low end of the spectrum. Taste is quite malty, viscous with an almost maple syrup sweetness. Hops give a slightly leafy and peppery counterpoint (I kind of like them to pop more in this style), and nicely emphasized in the second half of the flavor profile. Toasted malt impression gets stronger on warming and lingers well into the aftertaste. A slightly too thick brew, nice balance and a pleasant rendition of a strong Helles Bock.","ADR","Sep 01, 2005"

There was a good sweet/malty taste in the mouth and the finish was also sweet, but it reminded me of hay or silage (you'd have to be a farmer or spent time around a farm). There was a mild, lingering bitterness in the mouth as the beer warmed. The longer I went, the more I got a strong flavor of honey.

4.22,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Anytime I see a Victory product on tap I have to try it, they just are always a wonderful balanced representation of their style this maibock definitely delivers for me. Pours amber mild brown with an off white peach colored head. A nice trickled lace forms as the head begins to dwindle. Aroma is full of malt balanced by slighlty floral hops, a breadiness possibly from the yeast, and a touch of plum notes comes through to form one amazing beer aroma. Taste is very nice mellow balanced flavor primarily consists of malt sweet tones with an underlying fruit tone and hop profile tip toeing on my palate followed by a warming rush of aclohol that is not too overbearing just need to give this beer a little kick. Mouthfeel is slightly stickywith a tickling carbonation from this well-consructed medium bodied Victory classic. Drinkability nice spring/summer seasonal that I was pleased to find on tap very nice beer that plan to visit revisit hopefully in Downington.","WVbeergeek","May 25, 2003"

3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Draught @ Victory. This one pours a absolutely clear golden color. There was very little white head on it. The nose was somewhat malty and also had a slight grassiness to it. The taste is a bit of a malty biscuity taste, and was slightly sweet. The medium body belies its 7.4% alcohol. Very Good!","Boto","Apr 19, 2003"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Fruity sweet nose (yeasty). Rose' color with a yellow tint. Sweet taste with some floral notes in the finish (hop). Sweet biscut malt taste in dominant. Medium mouth with lively little bubble action on the tongue. Solid and quite drinkable. Had this at the 4/5 BA event and thanks to the BA's at lunch for the reccomendation... it went well with the pizza!","frank4sail","Apr 07, 2003"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer came to me a crystal clear, nicely carbonated and medium to dark straw colored. The head was white in color and seemed dense and light in nature. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly simple sweet malt, flowers, very light fruit, and some bitter hops. The flavors of the Saint were less simple then the nose. Some hops took the front – bitter, and floral hops – light caramel, great malt, some very light fruit, and a tad alcohol seemed to be present as well. A good balance of malt and hops that seemed to keep each other in balance, with the malt slightly more aggressive which left it with a moderate sweet appeal to it. Medium bodied and good malt balance make this beer pleasant to drink.","Jarod","Feb 13, 2002"
4.15,8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"very good maibock that changes form year to year with varying malts and hops. Sometimes dry other times sweeter, 7.4% alcohol is not noticeable at all and is a fairly smooth maibock. The draft version is usually all that is available anymore some years they bottle it and some they will bottle something different. A must try for maltheads as the malt usually dominates if slightly over the hops.","bierman2000","Beers"
