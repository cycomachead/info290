"Overall: by far the best beer I've had from Capital. Well balanced, highly drinkable, fantastic offering."
"Fresh bread on the nose. Pours brilliant copper tinted gold under a ½” dense white head. Rich malt and well developed melanoidins give it full flavors. Full body and medium carbonation."

"This is an excellent example of the style. Sweet leaning, malty, but with balance, toasty, mildly warming and easily drinkable. A great spring offering!"

"So many Capital bocks, and I'm not complaining... This stuff pours a clear golden-brass topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, light toffeee, light sweet biscuit, and a hint of sweet corn. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a kiss of buttercream and a light layer of sweetgrass. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine maibock, one that may make one look forward to the late Spring, early Summer months."

"It's the end of May and I may be finishing the last of this year's production, but this particular bottle of Capital's Maibock still satisfies. The malt and the lingering hops and yeastiness still make for a worthy treat. Maybe I'll catch one of these earlier next year. (Excuse me, while I finish 'er off....)"

"This really is a nice, malty spring beer with a small alcohol kick to it. Perfect after coming out of this last Winter. A slight grainy smell, not overly impressive. Creamy and carbonated, and a sweet finish? I do just also get a hint of the hops on this one. All-in-all a recommended spring seasonal beer."

"O: A solid maibock that would pair well with food."

"I eagerly await the coming of Maibock season just for this one (And Lakefront's ""Big Easy"")."

"Overall- The lightness and breadiness with complementing hops and perfect carbonation make this my favorite maibock."

"This was a good beer, above average, but it didn't completely change my perceptions, either. With a lack of available maibocks, this is a satisfying spring beer and one I'll go back to."
"Note regarding hops: I think the need for hop presence of maibocks might be overinterpretted by many reviewers. These beers should not have a resounding hop presence; they may be slightly more bitter than other lagers, but they are also slightly more sweet than them. Balance is key, and aroma hops to the degree found in American ale styles seems out of place. I don't care what Rogue and the BA powers that be say, but Dead Guy is NOT a Maibock."
"D: Nice, I do appreciate the refreshing lightness but a bit on the sweet side."
"Maibock is about the best thing Capital is offering outside of their limited edition (and expensive) Blonde Dopplebock and Autumnal Fire brews. I would rate it superior to Sierra Nevada's Glissade, a similar seasonal beer."
"It is a nice orangish color when you pour it; quite interesting. Mouthfeel is nothing special; some carbonation. Tastes somewhat bitter. Alcohol is well hidden, goes down smooth. I bought a six pack recently and have had one a few different times with dinner. With it being a seasonal, I may buy one more six pack before spring winds down or I will just move onto the summer beers that Capital is soon to come out with."
"Overall: It won't blow you away, but Capital has made a nice little seasonal in an underused style."
"Will add more thoughts with next sampling."
"Not a bad beer, medium to light body. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable I would say. I was surprised to see it was 6.2% alcohol as it is pretty light and smooth."
"Very drinkable beer, very good spring seasonal."
"This is worth seeking out, get some!"
"Taste, not a bad spring beer, had enough punch to it without getting away from style, more caramel in the taste than most, but didn't get too heavy. A little less dry though than hoped for. Couldn't figure where all the apple and carbonation was still coming from. A little bit of spice and honey as well. Seemed more complex than most, but not necessarily better or worse."
"pours a clear light copper with a quick dissipating head some clinging lacing...smell is malts toast a little toffee and hops..taste follows the same lots of very good toasty and caramel malts then some noble hops..some earthy taste and some spices ..its a medium mouth feel and easy to drink..try this one"
"i hate to say it but i enjoyed this less the minute i tasted their ""blonde"" doppelbock. but this is certainly the finer of the two, any puzzling similarities aside. this is going to be my best rating in some time"
"A very drinkable beer however I could tell it was a higher ABV beer but it wasn't boozy."
"Overall, another quality lager from the brewery in a sea of American Ales, nice to have this to go to every spring to break from the stouts and porters of winter. Give it a try if you have a chance."
"D - A very drinkable and enjoyable Maibock that I could see myself having quite a few of in a sitting. While I would like to see something fuller, the beer is smooth and easy to drink and affordable for the quality. Most Capital beers that I would consider buying in six packs are extremely expensive, so it's nice to see a solid offering from them without having to fork over a ton."
"Great example of the style. Not overpowering, but a great combination of delicate flavours."
"Short off-white head with no lace. Deep golden color is not quite transparent. I keep getting a whiff of something like banana, but can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe a bit of malt in the aroma, but that's about it. Fairly sweet malt flavor with a kind of earthy sharp butterscotch flavor. Body is full, but not overbearing. The alcohol and dry finish make for a beer that works in the end. It's a bit subdued, but the flavor is solid and this is a well put together beer."
"Not impressed with this one."
"Pours a nice golden/copper color, with a nice dense white head. It kind of sticks around leaving a bit of lacing. This is really a nice looking beer, clear, golden. I'm interested. The smell is nice too. It comes out with some very nice pilsener malt graininess. Very nice graininess. And it has that brilliant lager cleanness. There's a bit of a caramelly, cakey, sticky malt, but not too much sweetness. I can also catch a whiff of some earthy hops, spicy, herbal, but not fruity and floral. Smells nice. The taste is good, too. Crisp and malty. This is what I want, noy as dark and rich as a doppelbock, but quite a bit more malty than any other lager. This is still quite refreshing. There's a nice tone of caramellized sugar, with a distinct barley graininess, with just a finish of some earthy leaves. Nice and sticky as it goes down, with great, big body, and there are no off-fermentation flavors. There's a crisp bite of carbonation. Good. I'm going to give this a good rating for drinkability. I really enjoyed it. It goes down well and I would definitely drink a few of these in a night, though at 6.2, wouldn't turn it into a session lager."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this with my meal, and feel I could drink it as a standalone beer just about any time of the year. It isn't too heavy, isn't too strong for a maibock, and has a wonderful blend of flavor."
"drinkability is good as well - if i had to drink a lager this one would be tops of the list"
"I haven't had too many Maibocks but this is definitely one of the better ones that I have had. Everything I've had from Capital is solid and this is no exception."
"Tastes of zippy bock malt, heavy floral esters with a complicated candy middle of toffee and caramel, ends with very light european hops and more bitter alcohol."
"D - Nice and light with a dry crispness to the finish. An easy drinking spring beer that's of good quality. Nothing amazing, but good."
"A solid Maibock from Capital. So far I've been impressed with their German styles."
"Drinkability: Great tasting from the first sip to the last. It's not very expensive, incredibly drinkable and despite not knowing the style very well, I am definitely interested in trying many more Maibocks. I would love to drink this beer again and likely will."
"D: Oh, quite drinkable indeed. Smooth. I really was impressed by this beer. An excellent domestic Maibock from Capital."
"A nice Maibock a golden color and the head was a bit short lived, very clear beer. The smell and the taste are kind of the same kind of a musty kind of smell and taste which is fitting to a miabock. Also very nice sweet aftertaste. I think that the mouthfeel is great in this beer I wish that the head would have stayed around awhile longer but the mouthfeel was indeed smooth. But with all the maibocks coming out it is definitely spring in wisconsin. And I can't wait to try more."
"Drinkability - Nice beer for the long transition between Winter and Spring in Wisconsin. Not so rich as some high malt beers, but enough alcohol to keep you warm."
"Drinkability: A very nice Maibock indeed, with full flavor and well-disguised alcohol"
"This is a very good maibock and I have yet to be let down by a Capital brew."
"Pours a clear golden color with a small, quickly fading white head. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Has a sweet malt aroma with a touch of noble hops. Has a good flavor of malt with pepper and grassy notes. Just enough hops flavors to keep me interested. Some cloying sweetness on the finish is the only fault I can find in this Maibock. Bitterness is low. Is a bit overcarbonated and harsh on the tongue. At 6.2% ABV the drinkability is hurt a bit. Very good example of the style overall."
"One hell of a Maibock, highly recomended."
"An easy drinking maibock from the folks at Capital."
"Crystal clear golden honey color with lots of carbonation, and a thin white head. Smells like a roasted barley malt blended with honey, and a dash of lemon and hops to round out an enticing nose. First taste is a mellow, rounded malt with some Belgian-esque yeast and honey. Comes to a fairly quick finish where the late hops and citrus bittering linger to round out the experience. Light and balanced the whole way through, but far from the watery-ness you find in some of the more delicate brews gone wrong. Overall a wonderful bock that makes me wish I had purchased more."
"D: Big. This is what I look for in a laid-back beer drinking session. Lower ABV, clean, great balance."
"Even with the malty start, the hops and resin kick in for a balanced finish. Well done and a solid Maibock. Put this on your spring/summer drinking list! It will be on mine."
"It is a very drinkable beer. It has all of the right characteristics for the Maibock style."
"Medium bodied, the carbonation is more subdued than appearances led me to believe. Not a bad beer overall and I feel it is a good representation of the style, although I would have liked a little more hop presence particularly in the finish."
"Mouth feel is great; nice balance of silky, creamy and carbonated characteristics."
"Notes from: 04/10/07."
"D - Very good beer here. This stuff is sweet, but never too sweet, and it's much more complex than I was expecting. easily the best beer that I've tried from Capital Brewery, and it's second only to the outstanding Dead Guy in it's style category."
"Im disappointed in this brew. While well made its not particularly inspired. Drinkable enough, but with its big body and pronounced sweetness, as well as alcohol content this would not be session fare. A good enough beer, just not particlarly exciting. Recommended for fans of the style, hopefully it does more for you than it did for me."
"Overall, this beer is a winner. Quite drinkable."
"Not the best Maibock I've ever had but is still worth mentioning. It is slightly too sweet for my tastes."
"This beer pours a bronze-gold color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of bready malt, noble hops, and a hint of butter. The taste is clean, and very malty. Lots of bread, hints of toffee, and mild noble hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that seems a little low for the style. Overall, this is a decent Miabock. I could drink it again, but there are a lot of better examples of the style out there."
"Capital Maiback poured a very nice amber color, with an orange tinted head, that almost reminded me of orange soda. Smell was a little faint, but fruity and citrus. Taste was crisp, with biscuits and caramel, with hints of citrus in the back. Mouthfeel was good, as well as the drinkability. Not to much experience with this style, but I will say that I liked this beer. Another nice offering from Capital."
"I like this maibock better than others. That's fine and well, except that I hate maibocks. They are too sticky sweet and too much caramel in the taste with a poor hop balance (opinion alert: not a decree). The fact that I like this one may speak for an undesireable quality pertaining to the style of this brew. Either way, Capital is a fine brewery with a distinct ""house flavor""."
"I think this is the best Maibock I've had outside of Germany."
"My pour produced nothing more than some white wisps that quickly dissipated to nothingness. The color was a deep orangish- gold with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a malty sweetness that was in keeping with the style. The mouthfeel was full and almost creamy with a malty sweetness and even a little heat on the tongue. The finish continued to have a lingering sweetness. It was a bit too sweet for my tastes and not as drinkable as some of Capital's other beers."
"Overall a very solid Maibock. Nothing flashy, but it doesn't have to be. Just an all-around good beer."
"Feels really flat, but medium bodied and juicy still. It's refreshing, but not filling in any way. It'd make a good session beer, but I won't have any more."
"This is not a bad offering, and if you see it available give it a try. It would be easy to drink a few. It isn't worth spending time seeking out, though."
"Poured from a cold bottle into my favorite beer glass. Clear dark amber with very little head. Malty sweet smell, maybe with a hint of citrus and raisins. Malty with a slightly bitter finish. Medium carbonation, medium/heavy body. Fairly drinkable, but nothing special here."
"Not the best example of Capital Brewery."
"D- pretty good, blonde is better and they are released together however so ill prolly go with that when looking for a good session lager"
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a light amber, with a medium head. Smell was not very strong at all, faint sweetness. Lightly bitter, lightly sweet, lightly bitter. A very nice mix...right between a bitter ale and a malty bock. Mine seemed a bit too carbonated, not terribly so, but just a tad too much."
"Very tasty beer. Pours with an amber color topped wtih a tannish head. Carbonation bubbles cascade to the top of the surface. Aromas of malt hit the nose. Tastes of biscuity, bready malts and a slight hop presence coast the pallate. A delicious beer that hits the German style on target while reminding us that spring is just around the corner."
"Pours a light reddish amber w/light lacing. Aroma is of toasted malt, soft spice, and rye w/slightly sweet malt. Taste is sour/bitter rye, sour cherry, toast, and light hops throughout. There is also a bit of tart grapefruit in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, with a moderate body and nice carbonation. This brew is smooth and goes down easy."
"The beer pours a brilliant golden color with a thin white head. The aroma is moderately sweet and slightly malty with a hint of spicy hop. The flavor is malty and sweet with a very smooth, silky mouthfeel. The hop bitterness is medium-low and finish leave a bit of toasted malt on the palate. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a tasty, malty, sweet beer with a nice finish."
"Good balance of body and bubbles. Despite the inauspicious beginning, I find this to be a worthy competitor with any of it's transatlantic cohorts. A solid offering for bock lovers."
"Pours a clear amber with a stingy amount of head. Nice to see some real head retention on a lager. Th aroma is a light piney hop with some sugary malts. The firssip is a dry, sweet malt. Reminding me of sweet bread and other malted grains like wheat are noticed in the back of the palate. The mouthfeel is acidic, yet dry. Pretty good maibock brewed in America."
"Like this beer, I think for the price I will pick up some bottles of this seasonal brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer pound down several of throughout the course of an evening. I could see myself drinking quite a few of them if the beer were available in this area."
"drinkability is great. this is an excellent Maibock, not too strong or rich, but with enough boldness and character to make a statement. another exquisite brew from Capital. cheers!"
"D - A tasty Maibock."
"Capital is one of my favorite breweries in the world; I've had only 5-6 of their brews, but all have been class acts... luckily I have 5 more to try/retaste tonight. Thanks again Randy for allowing me to be your first Idaho order."
"Pretty good. Would make a nice summer beer if that artificial flavor note went away. Unfortunately, as it stands, it doesn't do a lot for me."
"Poured amber with a smooth medium head. No lacing. The smell is just lager yeast. I really get nothing else out of it. The beer is somewhat sweet and tangy up front, softer in the back. Nothing special, but pleasant enough. Mouthfeel is slick and creamy and relatively easy to drink. There are better Maibocks out there, but this is pleasant enough and relatively cheap to boot."
"Pours a clear light amber color with a full finger off white head a that fades fairly quickly. Some lacing observed. The smell is a sweet pineapple, cherry and vanilla malt. Light bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated yet singular. The flavor mirrors the smell, but without a lot of body it kinda sits out there. It's an unceremonious version of a celebration."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a nice fluffy one finger off-white head that stays quite well. A bit of stickiness, spotty here and there. Smell is a very light sweet caramel malt with a hint of light citrus fruit odors. Taste is very much of the same. Light sweet caramel notes with a nice mild hop bite towards the end. Aftertaste is a sweet biscuity malt flavor. Very light and smooth mouthfeel, perfect for this style. Capital seems to master the bock styles for sure. Look forward to trying more from Capital Brewery."
"This is a very full, refreshing beer. I can see drinking several of these. Would be very nice with something off the grill in the summer, say grilled sausage and peppers."
"It poured a light dull brown in a pub glass with large dirty looking bubbles. Smell was lightly malty. Flavor was a bit of caramel, but generally very mild and bland. Mouthfeel was fine, but I can't say I feel moved to strongly recommend this beer."
"A spring release I've grown to look forward to, the Maibock is a great sessionable bock. The color is a reddish amber and offers a lightly creamy head with good lacing. Smell is good with no discerning characteristics of offense. Taste is malty and sweet, but hinting a bit at higher alcohol. A decent brew, but I'd prefer a traditional Bavarian bock style."
"Taste is nicely balanced, yeast adds a slight sweet fruitiness and smooths the mouthfeel. Lightly malty, very refreshing. Simplicity and tradition go a long way with this one. Seems very well balanced overall, a great springtime session lager."
"Agreed - here's to Kirby's fine art!"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"The"
"Pours a five finger cream head that fades to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Mostly cloudy amber color - does not look like a maibock Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty/hoppy nose. Starts sweet, brown sugar that is balanced with the hops, malty finish. $1.79 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Tigard, Or."
"This is a nice beer with a mediocre nose and pretty copper color which leaves light lacing around the glass. The taste is all malt with a slight bit of hops in the finish. Very lager-y, crisp, clean and pretty drinkable. There is good mouthfeel, very appropriate to style."
"A very solid maibock."
"Originally reviewed April 9, 2005. On tap at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. Alright, another blond, bland Maibock! Not. Geez, Im getting tired of these things. They have no depth or character. Just sugary, sweet malt with a little bit of hops. This one is especially bland with a light finish of honey. Maybe it was the overwhelming presence of these beers as the Brewfest and this one was later on, but this one is just not interesting, at all."
"Into a point, pours a clear light golden with a decent head shrinking to nothing, and little lacing to speak of. Aroma is a sweet bready malt with hints of vanilla and nuts. Taste is pretty good, nice sweet malts, like caramel, and a tingly mouth of flowery hops with nuts, staying tingly though the end with a twinge of hop bitterness, but mostly syrupy sweet. Mouth is pretty smooth, but well carbonated, and overall its a pretty darn good drink. Basically, one that I'd like to see in another mixer 6'er."
"Capital Maibock is a good version that could use at least one more facet to what is a fairly one-dimensional flavor profile. Maibock lovers will probably love it. The rest of us need something more, something special to keep us coming back spring after spring."
"Pours a bright golden-orange with a skim of white bubbles - hard to get a good pour at a place like this. Nose a balanced mix of light floral hops and brown sugar/biscuity malt. Tastes like Blond Dopplebock Light, smooth grassy hops and sugary caramel malt. Mouthfeel is lighter than their Blonde but still substantial in the mouth. A solid bock but doesn't hold a candle to any of their other seasonal dopples."
"The clerk that I bought this from said it tasted like NB Fat Tire. I have to disagree, I thought it was a lot better."
"D- This beer has nice crisp clean toasted malt flavors that are not complex but very fresh."
"My god is this beer is easy to drink. I could kill a keg myself. Yikes! I have been a fan of Capital for some time but finding fresh products in Council Bluffs, IA was tricky. Not any more. Even at $10 a six-pack I cant say no to this lovely beer. Wow. Highly recommended."
"Exceptionally drinkable beer that seems to taste better as it ages towards the end of the cycle of its release each year. Recommend buying it early, but saving it in the fridge for a month or two."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep straw color with a finger of solid ivory head. A constant cascade of bubbles is present and the beer is as clear as could be. Very nice loking brew. Nose provides notes of toasted bread and light grainyness. A very faint floral hop is there, but not obtrusive at all. I enjoy the big toastyness in this one. Flavor really echos that toastyness. Grainy notes are light to moderate, breaking up the toastyness a bit. I really enjoy the aftertaste. It really carries the toasted notes and draws me back to this one again. I think this one is a solid maibock. Feel is moderate, with a moderate carbonation of tiny bubbles. It makes the brew feel a little more thick than it really is, and I like that with the toasty/bready malt character. This one is nice. It has just enough hop to carry it through, while letting the toasty and bready malt bill carry the weight of the flavor. This one is very enjoyable. I look forward to more time in Wisconsin to have more of the beers from these guys."
"Yet another solid entry by Capital. PROST!!!"
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, Munich, and carapils malts. It's dry with some breadlike notes. The taste is decent. It has a slightly musty flavor that goes down slow and finishes semi- sweet and a bit breadlike. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent drinking maibock. It has good malt content, but it just doesn't blow my hair back. I probably wouldn't buy this again."
"I think I could probably drink a dozen of these no problem if it weren't for the ABV, which must be relatively high. Though it doesn't have a strong or distinctive flavor, it's a very smooth, easy drinking beer that I can't seem to resist."
"malty, smooth, and very drinkable. a nice bready, honey sweetness with a clean fresh finish. light carbonation and a light to medium mouthfeel. needs a little more hop balance but it's a very good beer."
"Pours golden/amber with a poor white head. The smell is sugary and grainy. The taste is light sugary fruity malts, with a tiny hint of hop bite in the aftertaste as well as a bready or yeasty taste that is faint and hard to describe. Mouthfeel is average, medium and slightly sticky. There is not a lot to say about this beer, but I enjoy it a whole lot. It's easy drinkin', clean and basic, but with a little something extra in the flavor and in the ABV. I wish I knew the ABV, I'd guess around 6.5 - 7%."
"Drinkability is very high - just ask Davo he was able to chug and entire pint before running away."
"12 ounce bottle. Capital Maibock has a clear, copper color with a large, white head. Sweet and toasty malt aroma along with spicy hops. Grainy flavor with toasted malt. Spicy hops in the finish. This isn't the most complex beer, but it very clean, with no noticable off flavor. There is some noticable alcohol flavor. Carbonation is slightly higher than average. This is one of the better beers from Capital, and it's very good on tap too."
"Thanks to bditty187 for this sample!"
"Very carbonated Maibock pours brown with a good head. Carbonation holds throughout drinking. Mild Nutty, malty nose. Nothing extraordinary here. Flavor was good- Roasted malts and a mildly hoppy finish. Clean on the pallet. Not too heavy. Easy to drink as a session beer."
" This is a nice spring brew, a compromise between the heavy strength of winter and the delicate craft of summer. This is solid, honest beer and worth a shot if you can find it."
"Mai Bocknope, we call this one Mind Block. This beer sure doesnt seem very strong but a few pints usually leaves my friends and I in a rather bizarre loopy state unakin to normal inebriation. Drinking Capitals Mai Bock, for whatever reason, seems to knock me on my rear like few beers do. The predominant characteristic of this hazy orange brew is its immense sickly sweet fruit forward, slightly alcoholic nose and taste. The strong yeast presence in the beer is typically Capital and very German. Finish is fresh baked baguette and spice. Drinkability is ridiculous and even though I dont really care for the taste, nor style, I keep coming back for more so something must be right here."
"Now this is what a Maibock ought be. Light and refreshing, to be sure, to be sure . . . but there is much more to this beer than that! The nose is like fresh fruit, fallen from the tree. A magical melange of fruity yeast-esters and earthy noble hops. Mmmm. Very pleasant. The taste is exatically what you'd expect from the nose with a round mouthfeel and pleasant carbonation tickling your tongue. Good beer, good times."
"drinkability: enjoyable and drinkable, another solid one from just to the west of here off university ave"
"A good first impression from Capital....looking forward to trying some others."
"Reviewing this simultaneously with Tyranena Fighting Finches Mai Bock, Sprecher Mai Bock, and Rogue Dead Guy Ale. Looks just like the Sprecher, a faintly red-tinted amber color. Pretty much an average of the other three, this beer smells faintly of apples, and tastes pretty balanced, with a slight tilt toward sweetness with a hint of whipped cream. Upholds the Capital Brewery legacy of faithful, solid, and thoroughly unexceptional beers."
"Flavor is where this one gets interesting. Rich mouthfell surrounds toasty malts with a nice sweetness, an easy hop ending that compliments the rest of the flavor. Honey and pear/apple fruits. Quite pleasant and easy to drink. I think this is one of the best Capital Brewery offerings I've had!"
"Beautiful bright copper in color with a thin white head, crystal clear. Malty aroma with spicey yeast. The malt aroma is bready not quite carmelly. The flavor follows the aroma, sweet almost carmel, slight peppery yeast and warming alcohol in the finish. Good malt body and balancing bitterness. This is a fabulous example of the style."
"D - The low carbonation makes the sips slide down smoothly, and that fact combined with the delicious taste makes this one a very easy drinker."
"Color is spot-on for a maibock, a light brown, crystal clear color with a small creamy white head. Smell is big and malty, but not overpowering, this may be served too cold (there's a blizzard outside, of course it's too cold). Taste is at first sweet maltiness, slightly grassy, not overdone or cloying, just delicious. Hops are no where on my radar. Mouthfeel is slick, but a little too thin. Good, but there are better maibock's out there."
"Having pulled this single bottle from the $1 bin in Kansas City, it held up well as a summer treat. My hat is off to the folks in Middleton who have been doing a great job for years."
"Sampled 3/6/04"
"Drinkability: A steady, well-made brew from the good folks at Capital; A good beer to enjoy in a late spring evening after cutting the grass."
"again...cheers to zap and whoever else had a hand in getting this fine wisconsin maibock into my glass!"
"A Spring Thanks to BigHuge for this Maibock."
"I like the thick malt prescence, but wish Capital threw in some more hops!"
"Pretty straightforward, it's hard to knock this beer's drinkability even a bit. The hops aren't really sturdy enough to keep this thing together the whole way through, but it redeems itself in the end with a nice smattering of hop bitterness. Not a terribly remarkable beer -- but sometimes that's a good thing."
"This is my first maibock, and from this beer i am really excited about the style. The alcohol, while unlisted, is there, i would guess about 7% or so."
"These guys have shown they can do very good beers that stick to style, and their uniform label design suggests they want to get placed in the store with the mega beers. Hope they decide to go wild and do something special!"
"Nasty little linger here that does not want to let go...which brings the #'s down.....syrupy impressions."
"Boy you can smell the alcohol in this one...a white fizzy head sits atop a clear, clean, apricot colored beer....some maltiness on the nose...strong malt backbone dominates this beer with a very slight spicy hop finish...I like the flavor profile of this one...very heavy malt with notes of vanilla...maybe not the most complex beer in the world, but an excellent maibock I'd stack up there with the top dozen or so I've tried.."
"Pours a cloudy orangy- yellow. Good frothy head that disapates to lacy coating. Taste is toasty to say the least. Malt and barley. A little hops to balance. Velvetty mouthfeel. Seems to have a pretty good alchohol kick. Overall, a good beer for a warm day."
"Its brilliant orange-amber body and frothy white head make for a beautiful appearance. The head retention is excellent, and it delivers some very nice lacing throughout the glass. Rich malt leaps out at you in the aroma, clean and fresh. It's full bodied, creamy and smooth - luscious in the mouth. The flavor delivers rich, soft malt that's very mildly toasty with a touch of vanilla and a mild note of spicy alcohol. An underlying bitterness balances extremely well, keeping the softly sweet malt from building on the palate. Very nice! And although it's alcohol content will keep you from drinking more than just a few, you'll probably want to!"
"This is a perfectly clear copper color. Not much of a head though. A slight and bubbly collar is apparant and lacing is adequate. Deep malty tones on the nose. Very nice. This just smells bavarian. The body of this beer is damn near full. Feels great in the mouth. The carbonation is just right. The taste is big and malty. I love it. Bready. Doughy. A meal in a bottle. Thick munich malts lay down a fabulous foundation. Hops don't impart much in the bitterness or flavor. Just there for balancing I'm sure. Love this one."
"A little different than other Maibocks I?ve had, but a very enjoyable change from my ordinary Porter, Stout, Brown samplings."
"The beers I've tried from Capital are each part of the Tasting Tour package of eight 12 ounce bottled beers, produced quarterly. I have found their beers to be consistently above average, very drinkable, and lacking qualities of greatness. There is much to be said for a line of beers that can achieve these attributes and be affordable to most beer drinkers. Well done Capital, well done."
"Nice orangy glow with a huge creamy white head, two fingers high and settled slowly to retain a solid haze of bubbles and some large curtains of lace and some spots. Smell is soft of yeast, breadlike dough with hop notes lingering in the back and sweet malt notes as well. Taste is smooth and mild with a small sweet tang and easy bitterness, quite nice. The malt really comes through as it warms which is a nice feature. Feel is a solid medium/light body with a lightly measurable creamyness, an oily sense as well and has a slight zestyness in the finishing hold. One dynamite beer, drinkable stuff for sure, I'd have another in a pinch."
"I found this more enjoyable than most others that have reviewed this, but this is a highly drinkable beer. Aroma is a little light, mostly of malt and rather sweet. Almost a corn like quality, although I'm not accussing the brewer of anything. Brilliant amber color with a medium head that settles rather quickly. Really nice flavor of pleasing malt, alcohol notes and a very clean presence. Slight bitterness twoards the finish leaving a long but not necessarily dry finish. Soft and fluffy, with a medium body and adequate carbonation. Could be a session beer but with that much alcohol it would be a short session. I like this."
"A brilliant orange-amber body with a very minimal and soft white head escapes from the bottle. The aroma has a pleasant malty nose without being cloying, maybe a slight bit of hops as well. The flavor is a mellow maltiness characteristic of the style with a fading hop bit way in the background. Overall a very nice beer and a great harbinger of Spring in Wisconsin."
"12 oz bottle. Plain green label with the Wisconsin Capital. Medium shiny clear orange color. Off white head that doesn't last long. Alcohol noticable on the nose. Toasted malt flavors start the flavors, alcohol brings some heat and thin the body too. Toasted and sweet carmel malt flavors. Alchohol brings a thin light body to it. Almost syrupy at the finish. Definite warming quality to it. A pretty good beer and one of the few I have in the style."
"A nice,smooth Maibock from the great Midwest. Bright orange in color with an ivory head, it smells of a sweet cookie maltiness. It is a smoooooth medium bodied beer that is so drinkable with a backround of alcohol. It is malty sweet with a long,toasty finish. The flavors remind me of cookies and cream for the adult in all of us."
"Cheers"

"Capital Maibock: Ah, spring, and these beers really help to welcome in the season. Good looking brassy beer, not a whole lot of head, but what there was clinged. It smelled fine. The taste was very malty and smooth, creamy smooth, easy to sip and enjoy. Technically, this beer was not that sweet, more of a cracker malt, but very enjoyable. I did like this beer, and I do like this style."
"Thick, effervescent milky head; pale,coppery color.Notes of vanilla, citrus, spice, nuts, cedar. Firm maltines, solid texture. Sweet, tangy, pleasant finish. A little buttery, though. Not the best maibock on the block, but still a solid citizen."
"Crystal clear light copper hue w/ a head that quickly recedes into a thin, but persistant layer that leaves spotty lace.  The aroma is comprised of buttery, toasty Munich and a toffeeish sweetness.  Caramelized fruity melanoidins, although mild, add signature richness for style aromawise.  A floral Mittelfruh hop nose is present at a trace.  Smooth, light caramel malt sweetness is followed by toasty Munich and an odd, dryish black licorice note.  Hop bitterness, although somewhat paltry, adequately balanced superfluous malt sweeetness.  Spot on in body, w/ a dextrinous mouthfeel that helps lend good drinkability.  Capital's maibock, although not particularly complex, is clean, smooth, and well balanced overall .  It's well above the norm for US microbrewed versions.  Tasty!"
"This seasonal brew pours with a golden orange color and a foamy head that wisps away rather quickly.  The aroma is of sweet bready and caramel malt.  The strong sweetness of the flavor from caramel malt is very up-front and joined by a quick moderately bitter hop presence.  A little too sweet for my taste, but not too bad."
"Worth buying if you are in the (Madison) area, otherwise, invest your time and money in more interesting beers"
"Spring seasonal...yeast/malty beginning that subsides but persists until finish...Medium bodied, very golden color.  Just a touch of tang on the tongue and finish.  Nice stuff."
