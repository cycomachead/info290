"Overall: nice and drinkable, but not quite a perfectly formulated light bock. maybe the honey takes away from the overall profile but it also adds some good flavor. good but I won't be reaching for it again."

"This is a very nice, light, bock, and the ABV makes it a good session beer. On those cold winter nights, this is sweet bock to drink. Pun intended."
"All in all, it's a good quaffer."

"It's a stronger pale lager with honey - making it a honey bock."

"Light color, fizzy bone-white head. Smell is some spice (clove), honey, and sweet grain. Taste is malty and sweet like honeycomb, yet light and refreshing enough to session. Very hebal and aromatic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this Wisconsin pale bock. The aroma didn't do much for me but the taste was refreshing and unique. The addition of clover honey really imparts a lot of flavor and turns what would've been a fairly standard lager into something special. Its a very sweet beer so that may divide beer drinkers on this one. There are aspects to it, particularly the finish, that remind me of mead (an alcoholic drink of fermented honey & water, for the layman). I don't think I could drink a lot of this in one sitting but I would recommend giving it a try. Its not amazing or anything but I found it to be a tasty treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, refreshing, sweet and tastey."
""

""
"Overall: This is a fantastic beer. I know most people will try to rate this lower because it's a shelf beer, but if I am honest, this beer is world class for the style and nearly overall. It's not rare, it's not BA and I didn't need to wake up at 4am to get this, but this beer is fan-freaking-tastic."
""

"Overall a simple beer that would fare better with a little more character (more spice, more malt taste or body) to carry the higher alcohol content. I like the kiss of sweetness and taste from the honey."
""
"O - I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the lack of honey scent or really the lack of an scent. Got a small taste of honey. mixes well. this is not a complex brew. easy to drink tho. I don't believe i would buy this again."
""
""
"Wow, this is WAY more awesome than I was expecting. Sweet enough, but not too sweet. I love that touch of honey, too. And, the malt finish is perfect. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel, too!"
"A beer I could see being refreshing and nice hot or cold outside."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent brew for the Maibock style. Light but has an interesting kick of honey."
"Pours yellow with a white head with good retention and decent lacing. Smells and tastes like yeast, grain, honey, and wheat. Thin. watery, and bland taste. Decent carbonation and light bodied. Not much of an aftertaste. Not worth trying again."
""
"Pours a yellow color with an okay looking head. Nose is sweet caramel and some grain hops. Taste starts off with sweet honey, that moves on to a sweet toffee nutty flavor. A minute amount of hops show up on the backend, but the sweetness still holds through. Mouthfeel is full and really smooth. Overall, this is a nice seasonal to add into the rotation with its flavor profile."

"O: I like honey. If you don't, you won't like this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid little bock."
""
""
""
""
"O - An okay refreshing beer but forgettable compared to many others at New Glarus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this is very solid bock. Nice malt profile balanced with the sweetness and the hops bring really bring together a nice beer."
"Beer is eh, a little dry on the finish a little grainy, interesting a fine little lager, I wouldn't have guessed it to be a Maibock though. Probably not a repeat for me."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice white head and a touch of lacing on the way down. The nose carries some faint honey and a bit of light bready malt. The flavor hits the light honey notes again with a touch of breadiness through the finish. Some chewiness and a light-medium body. Good carbonation. This was a fairly-solid brew, but I found the honey to be a distraction."
"O -- Not as bready as I expect most Helles Bocks to be, but also not as cloyingly sweet from the honey that I expected. This beer is pretty drinkable and reminds me a lot of a Helles, just not very bready."
"The beer is light yellow and transparent with a quarter inch of white head. The aroma consists of grain, bready malt, a touch of lemon, and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is grainy, with a prominent lager malt presence. Fruity aftertaste. Light bodied with moderately low carbonation. Overall, this was ok."
""
""
"O- A decent beer, but considering this is my first beer from New Glarus I was disappointed."
""
"D: A bit unpleasantly surprised here...just an okay offering from New Glarus. I don't find myself commenting on the names of beer much, but this one just doesn't seem to fit. It makes me think more of early spring than dead of winter in a cabin."
""
""
"O- this is a fine beer to have 3 or 4 of while watching a football game. A little more floral and clean than high life, but that comparison isn't far fetched. Its an ok beer and accomplishes what it sets out to do."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) While not spectacular, this one has a lot more positives than negatives. A real easy drinker, that I would gladly recommend."
""
"All in all I like this as a session beer. A little lighter than many maibocks, but it's also more well balanced (something New Glarus is amazing at)."
""
"Pours a clear golden amber color with lots of carbonation. Has a dry, malty scent to it. There are some hints of honey in its taste. Quite smooth and refreshing with a great drinking texture. Some cinnamon and clove spice in the after taste. A nice beer for a cold Wisconsin day."
""
"Maybe I don't appreciate the style fully. But if this is a fair representation of it, then people need to stop knocking American Adjunct like it's a POS... cuz this beer really isn't a huge switch from those. It's cleaner all around which is the key difference I'd say."
""
""
""
"Pours out a lovely transparent golden straw color with a single finger of sticky foam collar. Smells very bready and mildly sweet / floral, taste is even milder than the nose presents, lightly carbonated and also light bodied, maintains a honey bread feel and flavor throughout everything, a fun thirst quencher that does make me think about spring for having a sole hopping emphasis on floral tones. Cons : It could stand some flavor amplification."
""
""
""
"Overall-- another solid take on a style by NG. There is a good reason why they are one of the largest breweries in the US-- they competently make good beer."

""
"D: This was a delicate and enjoyable brew. It was maybe bolder fresh, but the scent and taste were still good after 9+ months. The body was nice too, and there was no alcohol noticeable, so it was very easy to drink. Nothing exciting about this beer, but it's still recommended for a nice change of pace."
""
""
""
"Holiday beers should add a bit of sparkle to the season. ""Cabin Fever"" suggests a big-bodied winter warmer, but this beer steers right down the middle of average lane. Nice malt with caramel notes, but overall seemed a bit thin. Some drying aspect toward the finish with moderate lingering bitterness."

"O: Not complex, but overall it's a nice simple refreshing beer."
"Another good beer from New Glarus."
"I had high hopes for this, but, as it turns out, it's merely okay. Not a failure in any way, just not one of New Glarus's finer moments."
"O: Quite enjoyable, especially for the style. Not sure why it doesn't have a better average on BA - I'm guessing some of the reviewers don't understand or appreciate the Maibock / Helles bock style?"
"On the lighter side of maibocks, in a quite enjoyable way."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. This is another New Glarus offering I was fortunate enough to get as an extra. This is another one that poured with virtually zero head. Pours a golden pilsner type color, although a bit clouded. The nose is remniscent to their apple ale. It smells like crisp apples touched with honey. The first taste reminds me of much the same. More lightly tinged apple with a touch of honey. This would be a decent beer to have on a hot day. The mouthfeel is very light and delicate. The faintest taste of apples is left behind. All in all, this isn't too shabby. Nothing incredible. Nothing awful. Wouldn't seek it out, but could put a few back if it's what someone had about."
"Looks great and smells and tastes pretty good. I'm not sure if this is weak for the style in flavor, or if the other Maibocks I've had are overcompensating, but still a fine brew from my favorite brewery."
"Overall it's once again a great brew from New Glarus."
"Overall - Another wonderful beer from New Glarus. I have very limited access to these beers and each time I'm able to get one it's worth the wait!"
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to TATURBO for this one! This beer poured out as a nice clear yellow color. The head was fizzy and leave just a thin film over top of the beer. The smell is kind of on the weak side, not too much going on really besides some sweet malts on the nose. The taste of the beer is malty and has a subtle sweetness to it. The flavor is pretty good overall I found it to go great with my dinner. The mouthfeel had a good almost medium body to it with a good carbonation also. Overall I found this beer to be quite enjoyable."
"There's a lot to like about this maibock. As with most everything from New Glarus, this beer is very well-balanced and flavorful. The flavors don't shout, however: They are smooth and harmonious on the palate. As I'm somewhat averse to honey-flavored anything, and this beer is billed as a honey bock; I was relieved to find that the honey notes actually enhance the overall taste profile. This beer is certainly worth your time, whether it be the dead of winter or the dog days of summer."
"O: not my favorite style but nicely done."
"Future outlook: The first ""meh"" beer I've had from NG...but it is what it is...a decent enough beer in what represents a pretty boring style to me. No matter...an out-of-stater that I won't likely have again soon."
"Drinkability: Far from an in-your-face high-gravity bock, Cabin Fever would definitely be a good choice if I were stuck in a cabin during the late-winter. It offers a tasty and satisfying complexity without providing a serious buzz."
"The CPJ"
"Overall very drinkable, in fact really could not get enough of this one. It's a style I see far too little of as of late, and would relish the chance to touch base with it again."
"Overall – I didn’t think this was bad – it wasn’t “good” but it also wasn’t horrible. The alcohol is pretty well hidden and I could see myself having a few of these on a hot summer day before the honey taste got a bit cloying."
"Small white head tops a medium hazed golden colored brew. Scent is sweet lagered malts, maybe a touch of honey. Pretty bready taste, sweet malt, honey, light hop bitterness, touch of warming alcohol. Medium bodied with a bit of sharpness. Pretty nice brew"
"O- Not bad but certainly not my favorite from New Glarus. I'd be amazed if Leininkugels put out a beer like this but I guess I just have higher standards for New Glarus. Even so, it's still an alright beer that would be a good choice to introduce someone to the Maibock/Helles Bock style."
"Thanks to friend schmittymack for sharing this one with me at our mini (and unintentional) New Glarus fest 2 weeks back. This one poured a nice golden color with a tight white head. Very sweet on the nose, with lots of honey. On the palate, this one was thin bodied, sweet and dry, with flavors of honey and biscuit."
"O- A nice brew, nothing too unique or exceptional here, but well crafted."
"O - Just didn't blow me away and felt the honey was a little too prominent in this one. I've had my eye on trying this for quite some time so I finally did it! Might be inclined to pick it up again if the mood strikes"
"Poured into the trusty pint shaker glass again. Poured a golden yellow color with a nice white head that lingered a bit. Malt and honey on the nose with sweet malt, honey, a touch of citrus, and very little hop bitterness on the tongue. Not too bad but, again, I don't think I'd really pursue this one again."
"O - Very mild and lager-like."
"This is a little sweeter than I would expect for a Maibock, with the honey addition here giving this a bit more of an approachable nature than what I would normally find in the style. This was overall pretty flavorful though and drank rather easily for 6%. This is definitely a good starter for getting someone into Bock beers."
"I was very pleased with this and could easily put back a few before noticing any alcohol notes. Well hidden and just a delicious helles bock."
"I would call it a very interesting lager. Flavorful and refreshing. Maybe I have to start checking out obscure WI breweries. I had a bad experience with obscure IN breweries, good experience with obscure NY breweries. I will need to pay attention to the cheese heads."
"O - I could crush a ton of these."
"Drinkability: Another winner from New Glarus, they consistently impress me with great Wisconsin beers. This one is very tasty and refreshing, and the honey adds an element to the Maibock style that helps it stand apart from others. Will definitely drink this one again."
"This is a very nice spring or fall beer. As I'm drinking it now, I'm thinking about all the light, summery lagers I'll be drinking in the next few months, and how this forms a bridge to them from the porters, stouts, and barleywines of winter. But I could just as easily see it as a last hurrah before settling in for the winter (we midwesterners know about such things). A very good slightly sweet bock."
"Pleasant little bock. Poured a nice light brown. Not a lot of head on it, and what was there was a bright white that quickly disappeared. I really enjoyed this beer. I like to try out most of New Glarus's beers as I see them and sadly I've only gotten to rate a couple of them so far. I only live an hour from the brewery, so this is a poor showing on my part. This beer had a clean finish and was quite refreshing. I could easily drink it for a session. Its a bit on the sweet side, but it seemed just right for me. I'll definitely be drinking it again in the near future."
"Not very impressed by this beer. It was a very non-descript bock and if anything, it was a little too bitter for me. (and not in a good hoppy way but in a tough to drink way) I don't know if having off a tap made a difference as maybe the line was dirty or something but it wasn't until the very end that I got any hint of the honey or other sweet flavors that is supposedly in this beer. I have had it twice at a local establishment only because it is the best craft beer option available there and I don't mind supporting a local brewery. Even just with locally brewed bocks, though, I can think of a few that I would drink before this one."
"At least it is not Bud Light."
"(D)- A milder, yet cleaner and smoother maibock. Almost richer at the same time, but that is probably perceived that way due to its sweetness. Not bad."
"As a Maibock it really doesn't work at all. To me a Maibock should be pretty assertive. The hops should have a good kick and the malt should be bold. I am not a great describer of flavors but bocks have a certain background flavor that I can only describe as ""bocky"" (maybe bready in a beer bread sort of way) and this beer doesn't have it."
"O: Drinks pretty well. The honey adds a nice touch."
"This beer poured a golden color, with a larger head, that lasted through out the beer. There wasnt much in line of a smell. The taste was on the lighter side, but had a full flavor, and a nice taste of honey as well. Nicely carbonated, and easy to drink. Overall a good beer, but a differnt flavor, very unquie but still good."
"I say this is pretty drinkable a bit boring but does nice nice job overall"
"Drinkability: A light, mouthy honey lager. Different that some of the more bitter/dry Maibocks I have tasted. I like it. A nice like brew that is suited to year round consumption...if it were available. Would go great in mid-summer."
"The flavor is a little bit weaker. The malt is buttery and biscuity and the hops don't really show themselves in the flavor like they should. They add flavor but aren't assertive, they do nothing to balance the sweetness. I generally like NG lagers but this one fails in the taste."
"overall, this is a decent beer, I am glad I picked one instead of 6 up"
"D: I could drink many of these in one sitting. All in all, this is a decent bock beer that you should at least try."
"I liked Back 40 so much I went and picked this one up right away. Yup I know this one is a Maibock and B40 is a bock but I like Dead Guy so I thought I would really like this one too. Nope don't really care for it much. I popped it open and quickly poured into a pint. It looked pretty good a golden yellow and a fair sized head. I leaned in and took a good sniff. Right away I thought oh no. It is sweet smelling with a cheap beer smell. The taste is a little better though still mainly a sweet bready taste with maybe a sleight hint of spice. Not much else. It has a thicker feel with a sticky finish that didn't work for me. I'm not really looking forward to finishing this six pack. If any of my opinions change on this beer I'll come back and ad them, but for now I just don't care for this beer."
"Poured an average golden straw color with quite a bit of foamy white head on it. Smell is very faint, a bit of grain. Light honey taste, but mainly just a average beer flavor. Very smooth and easy to drink beer. Not much body to it, but a good light flavor. Not bad if the price is right."
"Another solid beer from New Glarus. Nothing really stands out with this beer, it just has a nice sweet flavor and is really easy to drink. Could be a good beer to introduce craft beers to BMC drinkers."
"Bottle. Poured into a tall Allagash tulip glass a apple juice colored yellow orange with a 2 finger effervescent head of white. Light white fruit like apple and pear in the nose along with a sweetness like honey. Medium/light mouthfeel. Sweet bready flavor along with some fruit type sweetness. Mimimal hop except at the end and even that is fairly subdued. Nothing too spectacular but decent drinking and refreshing."
"I could easily destroy a 6 pack of these in a heartbeat, YUM!"
"d 4+ simple and clean but sufficiently flavorful. a cheerful beer for someone stuck in a snowed-in cabin, indeed. gotta say i'm diggin it, though maybe i'm just in a generous mood (and subconsciously, i'm comparing it to the ""swill"" i just drank)."
"Easy enough to drink and I'd be fine drinking more than one but I doubt I'll pick it up more than a couple of times a year."
"It doesn't drink as well as I would expect for the style. It's not a refreshing beer, and I don't know when I'd feel like drinking it again. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me for free, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to any of my beer friends."
"Pours a slightly richer than pale golden color with a big fluffy white semi loose head that tightens up and becomes fluffy and beautiful and leaves some good lace on the glass. The initial aroma reminds me of the boiling beer on the stovetop when you make bratwurst, not a bad smell at all just not one you usually get from beer prior to bringing it to a boil. This gives way to a the dominant aroma which is bready baguette. All of this is accented with some nice but light floral notes. I really like the way this smells, it's aromatic but simple, it's subtle and clean but has some very definitive characteristics none the less. The flavor is also very clean and has some nice finesse The thing that catches me right away is that the beer is dry, far more dry than the typical product that advertises honey as a definitive ingredient to the beer. The flavor that the honey imparts is not likely sweetness as the bit of that that's in here seems to be covered pretty well by the malt as opposed to any adjunct. There is some spiciness and richness that reminds me a little bit of good honey, but I will admit that if it didn't say honey on the bottle it is not very likely that I would have picked on on much honey flavor. Which is of course ironic because honey flavor seems to be a very definitive characteristic to many pale/heller/mai bock beers. Beyond this whole honey bit there is a nicely subtle hop zing mainly in the herbal vein. The bready maltiness is just slightly toasty and there is just a slight hint of cereal in there as well. This is a damn well balanced & wonderfully crafted lager, the likes of which are some of the most exciting beers that New Glarus makes. The palate is just lightly sharp and the beer is fabulously easy to drink, as evidenced by the fact that as I write this I am finishing the bottle, as opposed to the Barley Wines I have this many notes for after about two oz. I would happily drink pint after pint of this beer."
"Drinkability -- Not too bad. While I've had a better Helles Bock in my time, I still enjoyed it. Pretty reasonable balance for the style and was pretty refreshing. Worth a shot, especially if you're in a lager type of mood."
"Overall, a very standard and refreshingly simple beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but nothing really brings your hand back to the glass for another sip. A decent beer, but lacking in the maibock department."
"D - The first time I had this brew I didn't care for it but the second time I had it had changed my mind. Maybe it was the first bottle but this brew didn't turn out to bad. It is a pretty easy drinker. I will have this brew again!"
"D- This beer wasn't offensive in any way, it just refused to have anything wow me. A good drinker, but I probably wouldn't try this again."
"drinkability is pretty good. fairly balanced. a touch on the sweet side, but nice otherwise."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, goes down easy but isn't very good."
"Atypical, but good and worth a try (at the very least)."
"D-Not a bad beer, but not one I would probably pick up again. Glad to have tried it."
"Well, I am not a fan of this beer, but it is indeed drinkable. Not something I would reach for again."
"Overall- I could see myself enjoying this beer fireside or poolside! It is a fun mix of light and refreshing as it is fresh out of the fridge, with complexity and rich malt character as it warms. As is typical with Maibocks, you cant really tell this is 6% ABV...Warmer or colder, this brew is up there on drinkability and I am happy to have a few more left!"
"Drinkability: A light, not quite crisp honey lager. It is what it is. Drinkable, but not something I would regularly seek out."
"Pours a clear, straw golden color with a yellow tinted off white head, initially fluffy and thick and fades to a cap and film with streaky lacing. Sweet malty aroma, caramel like and prominent honey notes with additional hints of grain. Flavor is fairly sweet, with the honey dominating the flavor with the caramel malt body, not quite as much grain or breadiness in the body as expected. Medium bodied with fine soft carbonation. Overall, fairly boring and one dimensional. For my taste strikes me as more of a crisp, refreshing sweet summer beer than a winter selection."
"This is an unusual beer in that it doesn't really fit a style & it's hard to know what to make of it. In several ways, it is a lot more like a really well brewed malt liquor than a helles bock. The thing that it's missing for any style of bock is that malty richness of Munich malt that at least I associated with all bocks. On the other hand, it's a really clean tasting beer that is remarkably easy to drink for its strength."
"D - first taste from New Glarus and considering its not fruit related, its very quality brew, would pick this up by the 6 pack if I could get it"
"Overall, a very nice beer, you should get some."
"Thanks, ThomasHardy, for the opportunity"
"Full disclosure time; I had a touch of cold left over and I probably shouldn't have been reviewing, but I couldn't resist. Poured a Spotted Cow after this beer and it tasted normal, but wanted to give full disclosure on this one."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some nice spice notes. The taste is sweet, malty, and alittle spicyness. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew, I like it."
"An extremely technically accurate view on the style - nothing at all is off base."
"Drinkability- Uggghhhh... Not New Glarus's best work. It's not horrible but the honey is too much and I don't get much of anything Bock in this. It was literally hard to put down a 12oz bottle. Tone down the sweetness a tad, maybe add of touch of nutty or roasted malt and we might have something."
"Pours a clear and bubbly golden color that is slightly richer and brighter than a BMC, not nearly as dark as I would expect a Maibock. The aroma is almost sickly sweet, the honey is very readily apparent in the taste as well. A little overly sweet for my taste. The sweetness coats the tongue and reminds in the mouth long after the beer is swallowed."
"Drinks well here- no hang ups"
"Taste is like a cream ale. Rather sweet with an over the top mouth feel. Not one of my favorite types but was easy to drink and not bad tasting."
"Overall, it is a solid brew and would be awesome at a cookout on a hot day."
" ~ Overall this is a good Mai-bock. It has nearly everything I look for in a good bock beer. Its easy on the eyes, good malty flavor characteristics and a great feel. The only thing it lacks is the aroma factor. Give this sucker a sweet smell and you've got a true winner. Once again, nice job to my friends in Southern Wisconsin."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a very golden yellow color with a clean white head. The aroma was nice and balanced with clean crisp malt presence and a slight honey sweetness. The taste is quite light compared to a normal bock beer and that is disappointing. There is decent balance and the flavor is a little more sweet than I would expect, but a decent brew. Not likely to buy again, but was ok to try."
"D - Drinkability is high with this brew...I know it eludes to drinking it on cold nights on the label, but it seems to me that this is a beer more suited for the Summer."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty high here also. I haven't had too many Maibocks that I like, but I like this one. This would be the perfect brew to drink while sitting at the pool on a hot summer day. Skal."
"A tight little bock, Oddly I'd prefer to drink this beer on a day like today which reached a sweltering 90*F than in the winter. Either way this is good drinking here."
"drinkability; fine"
"D- Like with many NG beers, this is more of a session beer for the masses. Not too much going on in the way of flavor but won't scare anyone away. If you are looking for a standout NG offering, look elsewhere."
"While this beer is not perfect, it is another solid offering from New Glarus. While a touch more hops may have pushed the beer to top notch status, the beer is excellent for what it is--a refreshing, drinkable lager that is suitable for nearly all palates (other than those that are only tuned to Imperials of this and that)."
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it's a lighter beer but has enough flavor to make it a nice drinking lighter beer. probably not enough flavor for my personal tastes but a good version of the style."
"Overall this falls in the ""good for the style"" category. Very drinkable. I respect New Glarus for brewing good examples of subtle styles rather than doing just high ABV -bal aged stuff."
"D. Do not match with a meal! Drink alone!"
"Mor drinkable than my buddy Lukaski said it was."
"d - This beer was ok. Nothing special, but not bad. Would have liked a little more out of the smell and taste."
"This works as a light spring beer, though it just felt sort of overly simple for it to really stand out."
"Overall, I think they hit what they were attempting to do, which is make a beer a shade shy of a Helles Bock, with some honey added. This beer is well made and a far cry from the Extreme beer craze that we are in the middle of now in the craft beer world and that is a bit refreshing. Is it an A+ in my book? no. But it is a nice beer fitting for springtime. I do feel that a touch more hops would have helped even out the beer a bit more in my opinion though."
"New Glarus has helped me learn to like lagers and other seemingly plain-Jane beers like Spotted Cow and Naked, and can see myself growing to like this one. Two more bottles in the fridge, so will give it another try."
"The beer pours macro yellow with a white head. The aroma is corny with some wheat. The flavor is corn, wheat, some fruit and honey. Not very much hop character in the beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad but nothing special."
"Brand-spankin' new off the shelf. Pours straw-colored with a creamy white head that dissipates quickly. Very clear. Not much of a nose - light malts with a little sweetness. Definately a decent malty taste up front with a decent background honey flavor. Showcases this flavor much better than another Wisconsin honey beer that shall remain unnamed. Crisp with low to medium body. Mild hop flavor on the finish. Very good and refreshing, just not anything outlandish."
"I might take Spotted Cow over this...highly, highly dissapointed..I hate to see standout like Black Wheat go away and things like this replace it."
"Crystal clear bright sun yellow body. Thin and wispy dirtied white froth sits on top. It clings nicely to the walls of my glass as I drink. Aroma is solid. Sweet, malty and honeyish, with malty being the most dominant aroma. The flavor is grainy malt with sweet honey accents. Fairly nondescript. Solid for what it is, but not a lot of depth or richness. Carbonation is fairly prickly and the body is medium. Very even keeled and mellow."
"Flavor is similarly husky and grainy, with a very bare hint of clover honey in the aftertaste. Fairly light and fizzy, it doesn't hold your attention enough to drink much of this. Closer to a macro lager than any bock i've had. Just not enough in the flavor department."
"D: Very good sessionable beer. Would like to drop a few during the hot summer months here in St.Louis."
"This lager pours a brilliantly clear light golden color--one might call it honey colored. The head is clingy and bright white. The aroma is moderately malty--grainy and slightly sweet with a crisp lager-like aroma. The flavor is moderately malty, smooth with a moderate hop bitterness and slightly dry finish, which balances the malt nicely. The carbonation is medium-high with a medium body. Overall this brew is quite delicious--straightforward crisp malt with nice hop bitterness. Makes me start to think of spring!"
"Drinkability - I like most of the stuff produced by New Glarus, but this one's not particularly inspired. I might take it ahead of a Spotted Cow, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Therefore I'll give it a bump on the drinkability scale."
"I am not sure what to think of this beer. Is this going to be the new trend for New Glarus? Dumbed down beers that appeal to masses like a PBR or Honey Weiss, which I consider this beer to be quite similar to. I know times are tough, but this brewery thrived on brewing world class beers. I hope this is just a blip on the map and the new beers that are going to be released this year will be exceptional. New Glarus needs to get back to brewing top notch world class beers and stop worrying about appealing to masses with these beer. People who drink mass produced lagers aren't going to buy this at the price anyway. NG's market is with people who roam this site. I hope things improve throughout the year. Best of luck Dan."
"D - I would have guessed this was an adjunct lager from one of the big brewers with a touch of honey added. Not what I was expecting."
"I really had high expectation for this beer given the original description, but I feel it falls so short and disappoints. I see this beer as the winter version of 'Totally Naked' and a direct competitor to 'Honeyweiss'. This is the full bodied ""winter""equivalent of that beer, and while I see it will please the people who this is targeted to, I find it a travesty that beers such as 'Uff-da bock', 'Black Wheat', 'Coffee Stout' and 'Hop Hearty' had to be shelved to make room for this. Why not just make 'Totally Naked' all year round? It feels like a brewery I know can make some of the best beers I have ever had, is now catering to the least common denominator in order to pay for the new brewery. I really hope the rest of the new beers being introduced this year are not a dumbed down version of styles BA's know New Glarus can hit a home run in if they wanted."
"In summary, NG used more expensive ingredients and a more intensive brewing process but failed to produce anything that is better than a crappy macro."
"Looks really like a clear honey, with a light creme tan head, really tastes like a macro with maybe a hint of honey man this a llight and...to put it blunt a pretty crappy bock. Don't get me wrong it's probably what NG was going for some weak beer that spotted cow people would drink. But I need more flavor."
"D: I can see the reason that this won't be rated very high--it isn't boisterous with enormous flavours, it is subtle and very easy to drink--Not something I am likely to pick up again, but a nice sessionable beer from New Glarus."
"D - Cabin Fever is an average beer with decent drinkability. It's nothing to be proud of but certainly nothing to be ashamed of. I'd have it over Spotted Cow as a session beer."
"D: Exceedingly refreshing! We really enjoyed the subtleties of the natural honey throughout this."
"Pours a deep golden yellow with a bright white head that goes away quickly. Lots of carbonation with no lacing to speak of. Smell is sweet malts and honey with a touch of floral. Really not much to get excited about. It's a sweet beer with the honey and malts. Some grainy corn shows up. Very little hop bitterness. Pretty boring. I was expecting something with much more of a complex flavor. It doesn't have any bad or off flavors, but it doesn't anything great to offer either. They could call this a pale lager and make it a summer seasonal and not miss a beat. It's still ten degrees outside, I need something bigger."
"I'll give this another go sometime, hoping that, right now, either it's off or I am. My present opinion is that it's the worst thing New Glarus has even released."
"Cabin Fever is not overwhelming in any sense of the word. In fact ""craft-brewed macro"" might be an appropriate term for this beer. It has all the hallmarks of a macro brew, which sadly isn't my thing. However, it is quite crisp and refreshing, with a light-medium body making it quite sessionable. I'm surprised this beer rounds out at 6% ABV. It drinks like a 4% ABV beer."
"The feel is super light, but decent drinkability."
"UPDATE: 1/29/10 I distributed this beer to 3 of my beer loving/ judging friends and I've recieved back 2 dissappointing reviews, while the 3rd has yet to try the beer. If I were to review this in the summer months I might give it a solid C rating, but the release time on this one isn't feeling correct to me. I do love most of the NG beers and eagerly await new releases..."
"Overall a super drinkable beer. Not thay this is a surprise considering the source. Keep'em coming NG."
"pours a nice golden tan color with a great fresh head and sticky lacing till the end it looks good and fresh with a pure white ring..the smell is malts and fresh baked bread followed by some floral hops a pleasant springlike clover smell..the taste is malts first and in a good way followed by the floral hops it finishes crisp and clean and a little sweet..its highly drinkable,,very flavorful ..another fine bock from NG that is well balanced with malts and hops and honey nothing overwhelms in this one...recommended"
"Overall a very tasty beer that is very drinkable and has a decent amount of flavor and body. The only downfall is the sweetness and low hop flavor. I am accustomed to a bit more in a maibock, but a good beer all the same. Sadly, this is not the stunner I was expecting to replace Hop Hearty, but it will do for now until I run out."
