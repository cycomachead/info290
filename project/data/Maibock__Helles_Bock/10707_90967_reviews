"Sweet biscuits and floral hops, a deliciously crisp and refreshing beer. Hard to beat the value at only $5.99 for a sixer of this at Trader Joe's. Maibocks are underappreciated in general, I believe, and this one is a pretty good example of style that is highly drinkable and great with most food."
"There's a rich caramel dominant aroma with some dark chocolate roast notes on the back end. A touch of bitterness gives a kick to the caramel and chocolate malt body. I liked this more than I had expected to."
"Feels heavy and filling, but you don't taste the alcohol."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, but it still had some aspects that I found to not be that inline with the style, but they weren't too overpowering so it was still identifiable as a Maibock and in the end I liked it.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, a little on the sweet side, a little crisp, slightly filling and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I think could drink a couple of these but after that the sweetness might start to be too much.  What I like the most about this beer was that the alcohol was well hidden and it was still fairly true to style.  What I like the least about this beer is the appearance, it could use a little work.  I might buy this beer again if I couldn't find the Maibocks that I like more.  I can't say I would recommend this as a great Maibock, but I think it's still worth trying.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, it just had a few things that seemed a little out of place.  This isn't my favorite Trade Joe beer and it's slightly above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a nice Maibock, especially for the price, keep it up."

"Pours a clear caramel color. Smell is all hops, taste is more complex than the smell. The mouthfeel feels like a lager but the rich malt and hop presence make it feel like a red ale. At 7.3% it is a little on the strong side for a lager. It's a good quality beer but too hoppy for my tastes."

"Overall a decent maibock. Not one of the best I've had, but definitely one of the best for this price. I would buy again just based on pricing."

"not a great maibock but a decent beer"

"7.3 ABV, good copper color, lame on the suds but ok on taste, malt, not very hoppy, good carbonation. $6 a six pack, best value for your buck. It's warm on the shelf so I throw it in the freezer as soon as I get home. Trader Joe's is best bang for your buck on avg.-good beers. TJ's saves $$ I assume by not putting the beer into a fridge but it don't last long on their shelves."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a reddish coppery amber with a fine half finger ivory head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is quite bready malt with hint of rye bread, hints of caramel and nuts. Flavor is sweet biscuit and bready malt, grassy German style hops, hay. Nice creamy medium body. A slightly sweet, but overall well balanced malty maibock with tradtional hops that give this a nice finish. A quite well done inexpensive maibock, and possibly my favorite among the Josephs Brau line. Better than expected and something I'd buy again in a pinch."

"Prost is an aggressive Maibock. From the slightly-bolder-than-usual color to the almost-too-malty-for-a-Maibock flavor profile, this beer delivers. I've tried dozens of Maibocks, and have never been particularly impressed by the style. This one delivers. Go out and pick up a bottle."
"O -- I'd like to thank TJ's for bringing Gordon-Biersch beers to the areas where it isn't distributed -- and thank G-B for teaming with TJ's to package and sell their beers at such a bargain. While the alcohol tends this beer to some hotness that is a little distracting, this is yet another terrific German-style beer from G-B and TJ's. Prosit! Indeed."

"O: Average, but not bad for TJ's."
"Well fuck. I had a lengthy review typed out and it got deleted. Maybe later. I am not that familiar with the Maibock beer style, but I definitely would recommend this beer. Beautiful color, great carbonation, nice maltiness, grassy/vaguely piney flavor, interesting floral aroma."
"Oh, for goodness' sake -- who ever has a MINIMUM character requirement? OK, I'll blather on for a bit before I get to the point, namely to say, ""This is the first time I've tasted true maibock since I visited Heidelberg for Prof. zu Putlitz' 70th birthday symposium in (IIRC) 1990!"""

"High C"
"The taste has an intense malty sweetness up front to the point of being a bit over the top with the slightest of low hop bitterness on the tail end. I mean I could drink this again because it does have some interesting characteristics but it really is malt-heavy and malt-forward."
"Overall a nice, big seasonal lager. Big malt, big hops. Criminally cheap at $6/six pack."
""
"GREAT BEER !!! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great brew at an unbelievable price."
"o: A truly nice Bock beer. Enjoyable to drink, and unique enough to trip up palate. This is a great addition to a craft pack, not a beer I could drink several of."
"O: A solid example of the style. The price is really good as it tends to be with Trader Joe's beers. Worth a try for fans of the style."

"Lots of sweet malt. This has an underlying sugary sensation and a peculiar resiny, gunky taste in the back of the mouth. It tastes like some sort of weird candy. Some roast malt with a frozen apple juice concentrate flavor. The initial taste is not bad, but that long candy apple flavor is more than I can take much of."

"12 oz bottle froma 6-pack bought at Trader Joes in Salem. $5.99..claims to be a maibock Pours a bright darker amber colour with a small off white head. Malty toffee,light caramel aromas. Smooth creamy,toffee and cream flavours..slightly bitter in the end. Nice actually. Good thick creamy silk mouthfeel lovely. Nice bock here smooth and strong!"
"""Prost!"""

"The Verdict: Not bad. A decent beer at the typically decent Trader Joe’s price. You won’t confuse it with a genuine German bock, but it won’t disappoint you either."
"At this price and quality I say buy two six packs before it disappears."
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. I am also getting a weird beef jerky aroma as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with metallic and vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with some odd aromas and flavors that make it very tough to force down."

"Clear caramel color under a briefly tall, plush-looking head. Rich toasted malt aromas...slight noble hop spice. Continued toasted malty richness in the mouth. Bready and spicy, finishing on the clean side and leaving some lingering sweetness. Medium-to-full feeling body, some residual sugars, and smooth with fine-bubbled carbonation. Not a bad stab at the style at all."
""
"Overall - a great spring/summer beverage!"
""

"Notes: not bad. Fairly easy to drink."
"Malty with yeast and bread notes. Clean and fresh--small, tight bubbles. My bet is that is well-lagered for a good 6 to 8 weeks.bought from the TJ store in Charlottesville VA in 3/22/13 for $5.99-a great price point-every other craft beer in central VA is on average, $10.00 per six pack. Recommended."

"12 oz bottle. Pours brilliant amber with long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of grassy hops and bready malt. Body is full and crisp. Grassy hops, grain, bready malt and caramel combine on the palate. Finish is long, spicy, hoppy and earthy. Very nice, on a hoppy side, bock."

"Summary - Not bad. Not my favorite brew, but I wouldn't turn one down."
