Sweetness is the predominant flavor, but not candy like by any means. Highly carbonated, largely drinkable, but not much defineable character beyond carbonation and sweet. Not complex by any means.

Smells really sweet with lots of crystal and pale malts showing up, no hops are detected. Tastes almost cloying, and not really pleasurable to me. This beer somewhat reminds me of their Blonde Bock and I'm just not a fan of that one either. I wouldn't mind using this in a marinade or something similar, but I just cant see drinking another in the near future.

(was over poured and served said boo-yah when slamming it onto my coaster). The aroma was very sweet and full of dark fruits and caramel. The taste was along those lines, very sweet, nutty malts and a strong plum and raisin flavor. Not much hop noticed in this brew. The carbonation was moderate and there was a little notice of the alcohol warmth after about half the brew.

The beer smells very malty with sweet apples notes, rising bread, and hints of oxidation like turn wine or bruised fruit (not good). The bock is very sweet with a thick layer of oxidation that lingers on the tongue leaving a clingy almost vegetal after taste.

The taste follows suit, Munich malt joining light fruity esters to create a tasty but slightly cloying baked stonefruit flavor. Medium bodied, sweeter than I'd like and not particularly quaffable or complex, this is decent all the same, possibly the best beer I've had from this brewery.","largadeer","Apr 24, 2009"

3.8,9.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer fares better than most other GB lagers. Bold in its maltiness and subtle in the Pilsner grains, the beer takes on a hearty, bready tone with moderate sweetness.

3.76,8,4,3,4,4,4,"This is not the greatest or most fair review, since I went to the Maibock spring release party tonight and tried this. The beer had a clearish, auburn color with good head and some decent lacings. The smell, to my nose at the time, was mildy hoppy and had nothing else. The taste was very hoppy, while the body was full and filling. A slick passing over the tongue was balanced with a very dry result on the backend. Some earth and grassy notes I must add, and some malts like bread that filled the stomach quickly. This isn't a good review, I reiterate, but I know that this brew was fully enjoyable and I recommend a try to anyone visiting the VB location soon.","clayrock81","May 29, 2007"

The smell was mildly malty with a hint of Munich malt and a note of alcohol. The taste was strongly malty with a touch of Munich malt and a faint bit of caramel. The light malty sweetness was balanced by a nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth and malty with medium body and moderate carbonation. The malt and hops lingered nicely in the finish. This was a nice, American take on a German Maibock.","UncleJimbo","May 26, 2007"

The aroma was a light, thin malty scent with some very faint fruit esthers. Otherwise, there wasn't much there and it was a rather bland aroma. Taste possessed a rich caramel flavor with a spicy hop finish. Not a bad flavor, for sure. Not the best maibock I've had this season, but not the worst tasting one either. The mouthfeel had an almost creamy sensation to it, but that was quickly drowned out by a strong carbonation tang which detracted a bit from the overall tasting. Certainly not a bad beer, but probably not one I'd return to in the future. I'll likely stick with the GB Schwarzbier from now on.","Atlas1","May 06, 2007"

Flavor is surprisingly hoppy, considering the aroma; there is a malty undertone along with a nice bitter bite. Smooth, lively, a delight to drink.","Cyberkedi","Apr 17, 2006"
3.88,11.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: smooth and quenching even though this feels thick on the tongue. Good version of the style worth seeking out on draft.","Gavage","May 16, 2003"
3.5,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On draught at the Columbus brewpub's Maibock Tapping Party. Hazy light amber/orange color with a medium thick off-white head that lasts fairly well. Earthy malt and floral hops aroma. Medium-bodied with a fairly bitter character. Flavors of malt, grain and fruit are counterbalanced by an indistinct bitterness. The finish is fruity and still bitter. Not too bad really, just needs better balance.","Dogbrick","May 07, 2003"
4.05,16.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Sampled on tap in Washington, D.C., this strong springtime lager is dark gold with a creamy white head that leaves nice, web-like lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, musty and fruity--bubblegum and a touch of lemon. The taste is somewhat fruity (orange, lemon) with a deep, full maltiness, yeastiness, and alcoholic warmth balanced with a crisp carbonation edge. I detected no hops in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel was full with perhaps a little too much carbonation for my tastes. Balance is there but drinkability suffers from a bit too heavy maltiness. A fresh-tasting and characterful brew.","Riggo","Apr 27, 2003"
3.75,7.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Aroma is sweet and tart with not much hop presence. Flavor is fruity with definite raisin and orange notes. Finish was much cleaner than something with this much malt dominance might suggest; not syrupy like the stronger big-beer maibocks. Seemed like it would work as a session beer, and it has the taste that may send you springing for the ""outdoors"": porch, balcony or biergarten. Would love to have this with a cheese, bread and fruit picnic.","ecoboy","Beers"
3.58,2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This spring offering is one of the heavier G. Biersch brews and it is a good one. The glass displayed a cloudy apricot colored beer that was topped by a decent white head. This beer laced extremely well. The feel was fullbodied, creamy and smooth. The nose was malty, bready and pleasant. The overall taste was malty and a bit sweet, but also reasonably balanced. The finish was quite nice and followed by a slight and sweet aftertaste.","AtLagerHeads","0"
