"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, raisin, plum, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid maibock style. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Definitely showed some signs of age, but it held up well enough and was enjoyable."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer, but I didn't think it was a good example of a Maibock simply because it lacked the key aspects that make a Maibock different from a regular Bock and the way it stands I found this beer to pretty similar to a Dopplebock, it's not bad, just not what I expected or wanted at the moment. This beer had a nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, a little sticky, rich, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, I think I could drink the whole bottle, but I would rather split it with someone. What I like the most about this beer was the drinkability, I thought it was smooth and the sweetness wasn't too out of control. What I liked the least about this beer was that I found it to be much more Dopplebock like than Maibock like, there's no way I would be able to guess this was a Maibock if I tried it blind. I don't think I would buy this beer again especially if I was in the mood for a Maibock and I wouldn't recommend it as a good Maibock simple because it isn't one. All in all I was let sown with this one, I was expecting a Maibock and instead I got a beer that was very close to being a Dopplebock and it just wasn't fulfilling as a Maibock. It isn't my favorite Maibock and it's one of my least favorite beers from this brewery. Better luck next time guys, I think you need to go back to drawing board with this one."
"O: Great. Cannot complain about that at all."

"Body is more than medium but less than full. Effervescence is lighter, somewhat smooth and, while warming to an extent, refreshing as well. This is a really good beer."

"Pours a firey orange-caramel-golden with a nice white head and constant effervescence. A nice floral, honey, and caramel aroma and complimentary flavor. A creamy, active body to this. Overall, finding that I might be warming to the maibock style. Not really a FCB fan, but did enjoy this one. Would drink again, though might not be rushing to the gates for it."

"Overall a good sipping beer. I drank the whole bottle between dinner and a Knick game. Very enjoyable!!!"
"im not a bock guy, and im loving this one. pours a clean mahogonay color with a foamy tan head. smells like a barleywine at first, but some german malts happening and a molasses sweetness. flavor is a grassy springtime vibe meeting an octoberfest head on. malty and full of seasonal life. i am impressed with the complexity here, not as sweet as the nose, just a touch in the finish. a little boozy as well in the finish. mouthfeel is suitable to the beer, medium to fuller bodied and long lasting at the end. this beer went exceptionally well with fresh ground lamb burgers, packed with red onion, fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, salt, black pepper, and chilli, grilled medium rare with a double slice of swiss cheese and pine nuts, a dollop of whole grain french mustard on dutch crunch bread. bomb! a nice mixing of the seasons"
"Overall - everything seems in line with the way the style should be. Compares favorably to the couple other examples I have had. I would say my major criticism is that it could use more of a pronounced hop presence."
"O – Nicely drinkable and good tasting but not a personal favorite, glad I tried it and I need to drink more of the style before coming back to this 3.5"
"Dr: If they really worked on this, this could be a fantastic beer. I think they used puree for the cherries; real cherries would be much better. Also, aging in cherry wood would be an excellent idea. Quite drinkable and with some good flavours. The above average alcohol never comes through."
"D - I'd have this one again. It could stand to be a bit more balanced (read bitterness), but it's a good example overall."
"Overall, heavy for the style. Alcohol is light, but present."
"Overall: Solid beer with a great flavor."
"Overall an excellent beer."
"Got this bomber at Total Wine & More for $6.99."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of earthy hops, subtle spice and sweet malt. Hints of cinnamon and brown sugar as well as some caramel, nut, biscuit and toffee. Slightly toasted but not burnt, just enough to add complexity. decently balanced and easy to drink. Not bad."
"Poured into a wide mouth chalice. Bright copper/amber hue with a decent head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is of yeasty/bready/malts. The flavor is SWEET malt, caramel, even a burnt grain taste evolves. There is a little bit of hop presence, but like it should does not interfere with the malt. The body is big full malt bomb. not sure of the alcohol, but if I were to guess I would say around 6% (the site here says 6.3%, but not on the label in FL). The alcohol is well hidden. Not my favorite for the style."
"D: This is an OK beer that is drinkable, but wouldn't be my first choice."
"Overall, probably the best beer I've had from Fort Collins. They are truly Masters of all bock styles, they have this down pat. Nicely done."
"D: Good level of drinkability and just right for the start of spring. Solid by example, fans of style would want to check this out."
"Overall: A great beer to start out the Spring season with."
"Not sure if this is an old bottle from last Spring, was on the shelves of a reputable store. No dates on the label."
"D: Oh, how I wish this weren't retired. This is a very tasty bock."
"Overall this was a very well balanced beer with the sweetness of the malts combined with the slight hoppiness. This was my first maibock, but a very smooth tasting version. I did enjoy this version and look forward to trying different versions of maibocks."
"The aroma is malty with prune and fig notes, sweet but not cloying sweet, maibock sweet, and of course caramel. The taste is very nice, caramel up front with a nice touch of dark fruit, and some good German yeast notes in the background, not over-powering by any means (I hate too much yeast taste in my beers). Medium body, a well rounded, complex brew for the style and ABV. So much going on, really enjoy this beer more and more, wish it wasn't almost gone. Thicker tasting than it looks and thicker tasting compared to most Maibocks if that makes sense. I can't say anything bad about this beer, worth the low $ tag and worth seeking out. Prost!"
"Drinks pretty easy, but you can feel the abv creeping up on you. A weak sister compared to prior Bock offerings from FCB, shame, SHAME on on you! I think I see why thse guys aren't making inroads in Kansas, OK or MO they have released great beers & then got chincy/wimpy about following up on success..."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this beer. Hits the spot when looking for a maibock style beer."
"Drinkability? I couldn't find a listing for the abv but what ever it is, it's hidden well. A good drinking brew for me and one that I'd be happy to visit again and I had to set aside my normal review to style route. This one was just too tasty to give it bad scores."
"I'm not overly impressed with this Maibock, as it does not really seem to-style. More like a normal dark bock beer than anything. Not a very persuasive or compelling offering."
"D: This is a nice Maibock overall. It's a little darker than I was expecting for this style, but I was quite happy with the aromas and flavor. A nice compliment to a cool spring night."
"Overall, a decent beer from a new brewery for me. It reminded me more of a regular bock than a maibock. Still it was pretty decent. Glad I got to try this one. Fairly drinkable."
"The Maibock style is my favorite lager beer and I always look forward to trying new ones each spring.Poured a deeb garnet color with a frothy half finger slight off white head,rich caramel with some green apple notes in the nose,very appetizing.Lush,full,almost creamy mouthfeel,its very lush indeed.Warming toasty flavors meld into big caramel and vanilla flavors with a light alcohol sweetness zip hitting in the finish.Wow a killer helles bock here,its warming and rich but still drinkable,one of the better ones I have had.Hell yeah."
"Overall, a good maibock that is middle of the pack in the style for me. Mild recommend if you can easily get. Rotation - not avail here in TX so shipped back from my CO trip. [N;N]"
"Great beer although darker than any maibock I've ever had and against the common standard to my understanding. Poured with a medium off white head and some lace. Color is mahoganey. Aroma is malty and caramel. Flavor is like aroma but big on the caramel and a bit of bittlerness in middle and end. Very good body and carbonation. Super easy drinking. Great finish. Session beer."
"D - This is not a style that I'm very familiar with, but I enjoyed this offering quite a bit. A tasty, malt-centric brew that maintains a nice balance while showcasing some nice flavors An easy drinking beer that I wouldn't mind trying again."
"I get the feeling this is probably trying to emulate the Hofbrau starkbier as it's darker and more caramel-centric than any other maibock around. Still, it's doing a pretty good job at what it's trying to do."
"edit from my 1st review i served this beer too cold and that killed most of the nose/taste - good thing i bought 3 bottles"
"D: Good, nice sweet malty sessionable treat."
"Recommended. A different beer for sure - it may not fit the style, but I enjoyed it."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, a little different for the style, it’s a decent beer and I could drink a couple of them, but I don’t think I go with it for a long time."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy creamy tannish head, very nice islands and sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, prunes, figs, raisins, sweet, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, with a nice touch of dark fruit, and some good caramel tone. Medium body, a well rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, this is an awesome little brew from Ft. Collins, Highly Recommended."
"The body is fairly medium to full with a strong residual caramel sweetness. Carbonation is fairly gentle. Could stand to use a little more of that. Drinkability is good. Would make a great pairing with a desert dish."
"While at first I was surprised at how dark this was for something described as a Spring Bock, as I work my way through this beer it becomes clear to me that it is indeed an apt title. The beer is light up front, akin to the promise of summer, but still rich and satiating at the same time, like the winter just passed. Definitely fits nicely as a spring time brew; it has all the malty goodness of a Bock, yet still strikes a lightness at times on the palate that makes this ever so quaffable."
"Overall, an excellent Maibock. I don't remember tasting any diacetyl-like flavor when I drank the first bottle straight from the brewery, so I didn't deduct it from my score for this bottle. Nonetheless, even with the slight buttered corn flavor, I enjoyed finishing the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a nice big malty body. Fills the mouth nicely. This is a tasty bock that will satisfy the malt craving. I could see myself putting a few of these back without a problem. Yet another tasty brew from the folks at Fort Collins. Thanks to Crosling for the opportunity."
"Overall impression: Very nice bock - definitely a liquid bread. Fort Collins should consider making this one for wider release."
"An excellent brew. Most delicious."
"Fort Collins Brewing has hit this one out of the park. If you're anywhere along the front range, this spring seasonal is a must get. Great beer."
"The body is rich and medium to full body. The carbonation is light but and works for the stronger amount of malt. Overall this is a dark Miabock with a stronger malt characteristic but a good unique flavor."
"Hooray, beer!"
"I'm not sure if this specific bottle came from ZAP or cokes, but either way, thanks fellas."
"Drinkability scores high for me because I love these types of bocks...clean tasting...sweet but not overdone(somer might think so but for a bock I think it is fine)...great nose....again....what a find this was....shit I had never heard of Fort Collins Brewery until I found this and another of their offerings in Eau Claire"
"Bottle obtained in early July 2005 and consumed a couple days later. Pours a beige two finger active head over a mildly cloudy light brown-red liquid. Smells of bock, munich malt (mildly chalky), caramel, with a hint of chocolate. Wet sweet and very enticing, as bock is one of my favorite styles. Tastes wow. Munich malt and caramelly delicious. Not quite the rounded caramel character I recall when drinking bocks over in Germany last year, but pretty close. Munich malt is the primary flavor that persists throughout. Once the munich is established, caramel rises and fades as well as a flatness, like that of bland apple meal. During the swallow, there is a millisecond of gentle alcohol hot accompanied by a more noticable carbonation release. Plus, a tang catches on for a short ride, but then fades as a gentle and smooth chocolatey aftertaste rises. While wet and sweet, the flat of my tongue has a string from miniscule carbonation and my mouth is dry from the 'chalky' of the munich malt. Hop bitter is low such that I can't detect any underneat the carb and alcohol stings. Hops flavor is very mild and present only as a floral aftertaste in the back of my throat. The head has settled to islands of sticky clogs floating on the surface. Medium-thick body and mildly (but sharply) carbonated. Get rid of the tang in the aftertaste and this is a really nice bock."
"And to think....I was pissed when I realized that this was no Maibock."
"maple creme in dark chocolate!"
"And over all good beer for the style. When I think of bocks I dont really think of spring. It had a very dark orange color much like rust. Very big head when poured. Huge lace like a white carpet. There was a very thick lager taste, which I liked. One of the best beers Ive had from them. Bottle says it aged 4 months and thats what it tasted like. A little thick for a spring or summer seasonal but still not bad."
"Overall, I thought it was similar to their Marzen, but not quite as good."
