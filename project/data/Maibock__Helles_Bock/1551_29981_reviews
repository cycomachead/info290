"Overall a decent Maibock. Wouldn't be my first choice from the brewery though."

"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden dark amber color, some carbonation, with a little fizzy off white foamy head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some sweetness. The taste is mostly malty, with some sweetness. Medium body. Overall this would be a way better brew if it was not this old. Some of the SLS SUCK when it comes to getting in fresher brews, because of this you need to look at dates, which I did not do in this case."

"O- easy drinking spring seasonal, this ine can catch up with you fast as the alcohol is hidden very well. Glad to try, but probably won't buy again."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this one!"
""
"Overall Drinkability: I was a bit disappointed in this. I feel like they froze a decent lager and then melted it in order to concentrate the alcohol ala an eisbock. This was a slight miss, but I would drink it again."
""
""
""
"It's lacking in the appearance and smell but the taste is pretty good."
"Cloyingly sweet at the start and finishes mildly hopp. Pretty boring and nothing near as good as past examples of the style I've had."
""
""
""
""
"The caramel and baked apple notes dominated this one. There are some faint hops for balance, but overall, it's sweet, fruity, and sticky. I'll pass in the future."

"Overall: Comes across as messy. Too much yeast driven fruitiness for the style. "
"This was a fairly nice Maibock that certainly held up to the style nicely. The higher ABV was noticeable, but I find that to be nice in spring offerings. Not bad."

"O- A decent beer and it hides the alcohol pretty well. A good attempt, but I don't know that I would make a concerted attempt to try it again. I would have liked just a little bit more balancing bitterness."
"O - Honestly, I really enjoyed this beer. It was probably my favorite of the night out of a few of their offerings. Like another reviewer said, goes great with their garlic fries. I'll have to try this from the bottle and see how it compares. Pretty solid overall with the exception of the light mouthfeel."
"O - I've had this on tap, first time on the bottle. Much better on tap, this is just overly sweet for a maibock. Not my favorite example but I know GB can do better."
"Lighter in body than its appearance would suggest, carbonation is nicely done, very limited hop mouthfeel from this, something very low alpha acid I would expect. Sweetness is the predominant flavor, but not candy like by any means. Highly carbonated, largely drinkable, but not much defineable character beyond carbonation and sweet. Not complex by any means. A little bready downbottle, and the smell turned for the worse. Better when you pair it with their garlic fries, but what isn't?"
"Mouthfeel is definitely light with an average amount of carbonation. Overall, not an impressive brew, just fairly average. A decent summer beer, and it went well with my meal, but didn't make me want to go back for more."
"O: This was the worst beer I had that nice. I won't get this one again."
"Overall, a decent Maibock. Works well for a seasonal, as I will enjoy this sixer well enough, but that will do for a while."
"Medium bodied with a fizzy carbonation and moderate finish. I don't know. I don't really love the beer. It's not fantastic and there's nothing exciting about this beer. Then again I don't hate it either. Just nothing I'd ever buy again. Distributors must've started pushing this beer around here about a year ago. It seemed like every bar or liquor store was getting this stuff."
"GB Maibock, 12oz's into pint. Pours deep golden, almost copper with literally no head whatsoever. Smells really sweet with lots of crystal and pale malts showing up, no hops are detected. Tastes almost cloying, and not really pleasurable to me. This beer somewhat reminds me of their Blonde Bock and I'm just not a fan of that one either. I wouldn't mind using this in a marinade or something similar, but I just cant see drinking another in the near future. Overall, I would recommend someone thats into really sweet offerings to sample this beer, its worth a try but its just not for me I guess. Cheers!"
"Served in a pint glass this brew has a 1 finger off white head that left little lacing and nearly no cap once settled. (was over poured and served said boo-yah when slamming it onto my coaster). The aroma was very sweet and full of dark fruits and caramel. The taste was along those lines, very sweet, nutty malts and a strong plum and raisin flavor. Not much hop noticed in this brew. The carbonation was moderate and there was a little notice of the alcohol warmth after about half the brew. This was an OK beer but nothing to write home about and after getting the tab, don't think it was worth the price- BOO-YAH?"
"The mouthfeel is just alright, it's highly carbonated and seems full-bodied, but somehow just washes right down. The drinkability is OK, it would drink a lot more easily if it weren't so damned sweet. Another letdown from Gordon Biersch. I find that everything they do is just too sweet for my liking. I mean, this is a decently constructed beer"
"O- Overall, not bad but not not great either. This one is right in the middle, a pretty average beer. Not something I would purchase again but not something I would turn down either."
"Drinkability - despite the bitterness at the end, I find this to be a very drinkable brew! Worth a six-pack."
"Clear medium amber color with minimal head. Aroma is pleasant and sweet-smelling with caramel malt and some plum-like fruitiness. Flavor is caramel malt and pale malt along with slight dark fruit notes. Very mild bittering hops come through on the finish. Decent. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Rather flat on the mouthfeel. Overall, well, this is all right. Slight shortcomings on the palate and appearance are made up for by pretty good aroma and flavor for the style."
"The beer pours a reddish amber color with a tan head the quickly devolves to a sparse coating. The beer smells very malty with sweet apples notes, rising bread, and hints of oxidation like turn wine or bruised fruit (not good). The bock is very sweet with a thick layer of oxidation that lingers on the tongue leaving a clingy almost vegetal after taste. The oxidation tastes almost metallic like crushed apples sitting in an aluminum tin for days. I did not enjoy this beer very much and I would not try this again."
"Gordon Biersch does not seem to get too much respect but I have been loving there stuff lately for session beers and this one does quite well. Very easy to drink."
"The mouth is firm. Pretty heavy body for what it is. Carbonation level is decent. The flavors are unlike any other of this style that I have had. This is more like an English Mild Ale, or a weak Old Ale. Dark fruits abound. Some plum and raisins present. Bitterness is moderate. There's a bit of an alcohol burn on the back end. This was an odd offering. I enjoyed their Marzen, but this one, not so much."
"Tried this at the City Paper Brew Festival here in Baltimore. I've only tried a few Maibocks but I really like the style and this was one was a good example of one. Malty, very little hops are present in the taste. Mostly the taste is biscuity with some herbal sweetness present also. Appearance: amber, very little lacing."
"Drinkability is fairly good."
"Pours a light amber with a nice off-white head. The aroma is appropriately malty with notes of caramel, toffee, green apples, bread dough, hay, a little mineraly and minty hops, and some alcohol. The flavor starts out with some bread dough and hay, green apples, toffee, raisin, mineraly hops, alcohol and some chalkiness. Mouthfeel is a little thicker than I expected, and drinkability is pretty good. Overall a solid maibock, but nothing particularly noteworthy."
"This beer had an appropriately thick, rich mouthfeel. I found this beer to be surprising just how nice & rich and enjoyable this was. Nice beer"
"Drinkability: If nothing else, it paired surprisingly well with the cover song ""You Oughta Know"" by the group Das Racist. While (for me at least) none of the bottle Gordon Biersch brews have been exemplary, they've at least been sufficient to get the job done."
"Overall, well, this is all right. Slight shortcomings on the palate and appearance are made up for by pretty good aroma and flavor for the style."
"D = This is perhaps just a bit too strong in the taste department (and ABV) to be something you want to have too much of at one time, but it is a perfect beer on a lazy Spring afternoon."
"Overall, a good beer, worth trying."
"Bottle for a buck at Whole Foods. Clear bronze in the glass, brilliantly clear in fact, with two fingers of white froth topping the body. Looks good, albeit filtered to death. Apricot, peach and Munich malt aromas with hints of more acidic fruit, though it's on the sweet side. The taste follows suit, Munich malt joining light fruity esters to create a tasty but slightly cloying baked stonefruit flavor. Medium bodied, sweeter than I'd like and not particularly quaffable or complex, this is decent all the same, possibly the best beer I've had from this brewery."
"Bubbles fade quickly from this med-heavy lager. I notice this isn't necessarily a 'bloating beer'. Still best enjoyed in moderation."
"D: I could drink this beer all day. Well, at least until I fell on my ass drunk as a skunk!"
"Look is the best feature of this beer. The nose slips as does the flavor but never to a point of damnation. The biggest problems of this beer, in my opinion it's the mouthfeel. Rough on the palate and dryer then I would expect for the style. Each sip seems to be more of a chore then a pleasure. It tastes like a cookie cutter beer and isn't as good as the others in GB year round line up. Worth a try but I'll look forward to the next seasonal."

"Clear, dark copper brown with a creamy light brown head. Some hop aroma with the malty sweetness. Flavor was a bit sweet, pretty well balanced. Very typical of the style. By the end (after it had warmed a bit) there was a alcoholic bite aftertaste. Slightly thin, medium mouthfeel, but you don't want it to be heavy. Good drinkability, too bad time issues would not allow me to try some more."
"D- This beer is a nice sipper with a very smooth flavor for a 7.0%ABV beer, but the muted flavors really leave me wanting more flavor. If they doubled the malt bill it would have a great flavor."
"The beer fares better than most other GB lagers. Bold in its maltiness and subtle in the Pilsner grains, the beer takes on a hearty, bready tone with moderate sweetness. Herbal and grassy hops prove to be bold, but balanced both in flavor and bittering. Spicy and lightly fruity notes help to decorate the beer. Warming in the finish, but allows for smooth texture and easy drinking. Head retention could be better."
"In my glass it is a dark red brown with a creamy light brown head. Slight hop aroma-sweet malt in the initial taste-this malt sweetness stays with you until the last swallow. There is also a alcohol warmth to this beer-mouthfeel is medium, and lucious. Drinkability is good-it needs more hops to balance the malt sweetness-almost too sweet to have more than a few"
"This is not the greatest or most fair review, since I went to the Maibock spring release party tonight and tried this. The beer had a clearish, auburn color with good head and some decent lacings. The smell, to my nose at the time, was mildy hoppy and had nothing else. The taste was very hoppy, while the body was full and filling. A slick passing over the tongue was balanced with a very dry result on the backend. Some earth and grassy notes I must add, and some malts like bread that filled the stomach quickly. This isn't a good review, I reiterate, but I know that this brew was fully enjoyable and I recommend a try to anyone visiting the VB location soon."
"This Maibock poured a hazy, copper color with creamy, white foam that settled and left a thin layer on the surface of the beer. The smell was mildly malty with a hint of Munich malt and a note of alcohol. The taste was strongly malty with a touch of Munich malt and a faint bit of caramel. The light malty sweetness was balanced by a nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth and malty with medium body and moderate carbonation. The malt and hops lingered nicely in the finish. This was a nice, American take on a German Maibock."
"Poured a dense opaque apricot-amber color. A bit lighter orange at the base when held up to the light. It had a decent two-finger head but left no lace. The aroma was a light, thin malty scent with some very faint fruit esthers. Otherwise, there wasn't much there and it was a rather bland aroma. Taste possessed a rich caramel flavor with a spicy hop finish. Not a bad flavor, for sure. Not the best maibock I've had this season, but not the worst tasting one either. The mouthfeel had an almost creamy sensation to it, but that was quickly drowned out by a strong carbonation tang which detracted a bit from the overall tasting. Certainly not a bad beer, but probably not one I'd return to in the future. I'll likely stick with the GB Schwarzbier from now on."
"Color is a lovely deep honey-brown with a nice thick fine-bubbled head. Aroma is weak but pleasant and malty. Flavor is surprisingly hoppy, considering the aroma; there is a malty undertone along with a nice bitter bite. Smooth, lively, a delight to drink."
"Drinkability: smooth and quenching even though this feels thick on the tongue. Good version of the style worth seeking out on draft."
"On draught at the Columbus brewpub's Maibock Tapping Party. Hazy light amber/orange color with a medium thick off-white head that lasts fairly well. Earthy malt and floral hops aroma. Medium-bodied with a fairly bitter character. Flavors of malt, grain and fruit are counterbalanced by an indistinct bitterness. The finish is fruity and still bitter. Not too bad really, just needs better balance."
"Sampled on tap in Washington, D.C., this strong springtime lager is dark gold with a creamy white head that leaves nice, web-like lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, musty and fruity--bubblegum and a touch of lemon. The taste is somewhat fruity (orange, lemon) with a deep, full maltiness, yeastiness, and alcoholic warmth balanced with a crisp carbonation edge. I detected no hops in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel was full with perhaps a little too much carbonation for my tastes. Balance is there but drinkability suffers from a bit too heavy maltiness. A fresh-tasting and characterful brew."
"Aroma is sweet and tart with not much hop presence. Flavor is fruity with definite raisin and orange notes. Finish was much cleaner than something with this much malt dominance might suggest; not syrupy like the stronger big-beer maibocks. Seemed like it would work as a session beer, and it has the taste that may send you springing for the ""outdoors"": porch, balcony or biergarten. Would love to have this with a cheese, bread and fruit picnic."
"This spring offering is one of the heavier G. Biersch brews and it is a good one. The glass displayed a cloudy apricot colored beer that was topped by a decent white head. This beer laced extremely well. The feel was fullbodied, creamy and smooth. The nose was malty, bready and pleasant. The overall taste was malty and a bit sweet, but also reasonably balanced. The finish was quite nice and followed by a slight and sweet aftertaste."
