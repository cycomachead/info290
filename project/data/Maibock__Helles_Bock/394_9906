4.18,10.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a deep dark amber, very clear with lots of streaming carbonation from the bottom of the glass, but no head. Slight amount of lace. Smell was very bready and grain like, with a hint of a slight bitterness, but definatly bread like. The flavor followed suit as it was highly malted and full of grain like flavors. Not much hops to balance, but ever so slightly dry finish. Kinda thin in feel, not enough carbonation to give it that silky smooth feel. Overall this was a decent offering from foothills, and an average representation of the style. The alcohol is very, I mean very well hidden, I could swear this was a 4% beer, was shocked to see it at 8% before my review. Overall definatly give this one a try if you can.","mikesgroove","Jun 29, 2010"

The taste is an interesting blend of crisp sweet malts with a nice hop profile backing it up that leaves an interesting bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence, but still provides the refreshment expected in a Maibock. This one was certainly enjoyable.","atsprings","Beers"

Great head retention that left thick sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Nose is of caramel malts up front, touch of honey and just the slightest hint of citrus hops. Taste is caramel malts up front - definitely sweet! Honey comes in after the caramel, and then is followed by some pale malts that I didn't pick up in the nose. Finish is where you get a touch of citrus hops - I'm picking up grapefruit. This is a medium to lighter body beer, decent carbonation, starts off crisp but has a sticky finish to it, touch of alcohol warms you. This is a nice beer - lower ABV would make it more drinkable, but it is a nice one to sit with.","Jayli","Mar 30, 2009"

I pulled this beer out of my fridge opened it and it foamed up all over my counter. fun fun fun. This beer poors a nice golden blonde color, and it has an interesting sweet malty smell. The taste is sweet, but not too overpoweringly sweet, with a bit of a hoppy bite. The 7% alcohol is well hidden.

4.3,13.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Wasn't sure what to expect, I knew it was a little out of date but the 7% ABV would make it last a little longer. Tastes like a strong Kolsch if I had to describe it... a dark yellow in color with a bite a hint of alcohol in the after finish but not much at all. Very interesting.. listed under the same style as Dead Guy from Rogue which I thought tasted better, but this is a much better deal and for the price it was exceptional.","oriolesfan4","Sep 18, 2008"

Also present are some citrus notes, and a very peppery bite on the end. The beer is quite oily on the tongue and full bodied. There aren't heaps of hops in this beer, but the spices add the bitterness. The hops are in the noble family. The 7% ABV is pretty well hidden. The thick pour and rich consistency makes this a not-every-down type bock. Watery and thin this is not.","albern","Jun 12, 2008"
3,-20.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Dark gold or dark blonde color with light foam head and small active prickle. Mild grain nose with slight malt hints. Clean attack and grain heavy flavor. Some vague hints of of a macrobrew yet some sour notes toward the finish. A passable yet ordinary or average microbrew. I could see some mass appeal and I can easily envision a cooler full of this being a hit at a barbecue.","Ragingbull","Jun 04, 2008"
4.03,6.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Well, they stopped brewing this tasty little gem in May, so I guess I should put my lazy ass in front of the computer and review the beer before the small remaining supply dries up for the year. I have got to say, I likes what Stoudts does. Blondie here pours a brilliant honey-gold and atop sits a nice, tight little creamy head. She's a lass that's easy on the eyes, but can she hold a decent conversation? Before she opens her mouth though, I get a whiff of her perfume. Sweet, sticky malt and more than a hint of the clover honey they use to brew this seasonal. One sip later and I must confess, there is more going on here than just a pretty face. Fat malt sits on the palate, but it isn't too heavy or syrupy. Just big-boned. A dry bitterness runs down the sides of the tongue, lending a superb drinkablility and it all ends in a nice, honeyed finish that slides quickly down the throat. I can safely attest to having too many of these on several occassions, and though no animals were hurt in the events that followed, many a questionable camera phone picture was taken. So yes, I would say it is very quaffable and will cause your better judgement some problems. All in all, she is a fun girl who will take you for a wild ride given the right conditions.","cthulu81","Jun 04, 2008"

4.03,6.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D - this is a really enjoyable beer, especially now that it's warmer outside. It's a bit heavy and strong for a sessionable summer beer, but I could certainly do a few of these sitting in my place with the temperature in the mid-low 70's. Definitely give it a shot. Very inviting and refreshing.","ruckzuck","May 14, 2008"

Bubbles race each other to the top of the glass, get in my belly. Chunky webbing left on the sides of the glass, I love it. Smell is pretty earthy to begin with, but the sweet caramel malt eventually emerges. Some grassy hops and sweet honey tickle the nose as well. Taste is a bit dirty up front with a some pepper and caramel malt. Some buttered biscuits and earthy hops midway that lead to the bready apple aftertaste. Medium body and a chewy feel with a soft carbonation. Very good representation of the style, I really wish more breweries would give maibocks a shot.

The aroma is grass, spicy hops, and biscuity malt. The taste is full of hops up front followed by enough malt to balance out the hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, maibock is one of my favorite styles, and this is certainly a good one. I like its large amounts of both malt and hops. I could happily drink this all spring.","KarlHungus","Apr 28, 2008"

3.8,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4," The 7.0% ABV, as many have noted on here, is only a number. I don't feel it at all as I'm enjoying this, since the mouthfeel and taste more than compensate for it. This isn't the best beer I've had lately, but for this time of the year, it fits well. It's lighter, less malty, and not as burnt/caramel as a regular bock. I have yet to sample a bad beer from Stoudt's and this is no exception. I wouldn't recommend this to the novice beer drinker, but for anyone who's got some ""palate"" under his/her belt, this is a great way to welcome in the warmer weather!","JerzDevl2000","Apr 21, 2008"

3.87,2.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Fairly hoppy for a Maibock, but still a pretty tasty beer. The aroma has a sweet fruity malt note and the flavor focuses on spicy, ground pepper hops with a light malt balance. There's a semi-dry finish with a medium bitterness.

The aroma is a toasted wheat cereal with a grape edge, maybe even some orange, very delectable, unique and intriguing. The flavor is a bit mellower than the aroma, a mild more of a piney hops background with a creamy feel. Very pleasantly surprising for a bock. At the back of your mouth is a very neat flavor that is like rye toast. Really nice, very smooth and easy drinking. Alcohol does not seem to strong but the taste is grand.","Durge","Mar 25, 2008"

It is very light for a 7%. It has a nice light to medium body. I love this stuff and will keep drinking it as long as it is out. I will have to get a case the next time I go up.

2.91,-23,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a light amber with just a collar for a head. The aroma is very sulphurous, although there is some mild Vienna malt backing and a hint of berry fruits. On the palate, brisk carbonation and overpowering sulphur, along with fairly robust acidity, combine for an impression that is, overall, unpleasant. Mouthfeel is big and brash, with nothing in the way of subtlety.

All I did was pour only an ounce or two of this beer and up comes this massive head of white foam from out of nowhere and almost overflowed this tall glass. The retention was too good because I had to wait 4 minutes before I could actually get to the beer itself. In it's aftermath, it left plenty of white sticky lace and white foamy rings around the glass. It had a light aroma of juicy fruits at first and then that drifted away into toasted grains, a touch of caramel, a dash of pepper, and into some crisp floral hops. The smell ended with the floral hops, but the taste began with those floral hops. After that there were some toasted malts, a small touch of juicy fruits, caramel, some spices, a slight drop of alcohol, and then it finished with those floral hops that were in the beginning of the taste. There was also some yeast in there, but of course that was only toward the bottom of the bottle. The mouthfeel was very light with moderate carbonation and with a very mild aftertaste of those floral hops that keep showing up again and again. The beer overall was a very nice light beer that's easily drinkable. I know it says it has 7% ABV, but I don't believe it. Would I drink another one? I wouldn't mind another one.

The taste is malty sweet, heavy on the honey and with some hints of orange and nice hops on the tail end. The body was silky and smooth. It's very easy to drink and is enjoyable the whole way through. In my opinion, it shares a lot in common with Rogue Dead Guy (my all-time favorite, anytime beer) BUT the Blonde Double Maibock can be overly sweet and the alcohol catches up with you pretty quickly if you're enjoying more than one (hence my lower drinkability score).

3.65,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice copper color ...decent initial head...leaves very nice lacing. Smell is malty, fruity with a honey presence. Taste is full with a strong malt presence, honey element are present mainly in the smoothness it gives. Mouthfeel is rounded, chewy and reminds you to sip this offering. Mouthfeel is heavy IMO. A bit oily also, but not in a distarcting way. Light bitterness in the finish. Alchol presence is there too. I'm not a big lager fan...but this was a good brew.","edchicma","May 07, 2004"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Deep amber honey golden hue with a nice creamy texture creamy orange tinted head, leaves intricate even lacing down my glass. Aroma: Rich sweetness with alcohol around the edges. A mild touch of fruitiness but overall there's alot of depth in this brew finishes with a touch of German Noble hops. Taste: Very quaffable big malty layers of reserved fruit and alcohol, but so damn tasty all topped off with a mild dose of semi herbal grassy hop flavoring with low bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and slightly sticky even carbonation no complaints. Drinkability: Great stuff, easily consumed and great flavor profile.","WVbeergeek","May 04, 2004"
4.32,14.3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, fluffy 1/2"" light beige head formed, which although being somewhat short lived, laced ok. Brew is an orangey-copper hue and has an aroma which first brings to mind the alcohol you'd expect from a dopplebock, but in this case it is tempered by a pleasant fruity essence. Taste is remarkably well-balanced for a dopplebock, with the fruitiness adding a nice dimension and the honey smooths the ride. None of the cloying sweetness that some achieve. Very easy drinking, kind of scarily so, largely because of the impressive mouthfeel.","ppoitras","Apr 04, 2004"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is my first real maibock so I may be biased, but I really enjoyed this one a lot. This poured a clear orange-gold with a sticky, frothy white head which left medium lacing down the glass. The smell was sweet caramel malts, dried fruits (pears, raisin) and a touch of floral hops. The taste had a heavy malt base with nice fruit and floral overtones. The mouthfeel was smooth and very clean, but had an assertive bitterness near the end to cleanse the palette. Overall, it was a little ""sticky"" but I liked it -- the alcohol was very warming but hidden extremely well --- I finished a 750ml with no problem and a nice buzz... so yes, very drinkable indeed.","Gasp100","Dec 22, 2003"

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is good. It has a bitter musty smell with the addition of light crystal malts. The taste is great. For a higher abv., it goes down smooth and has good flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a real sessions beer; a good drinker.","WesWes","Oct 29, 2003"
4.25,12.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This is probably the best beer from Stoudt's that I've had. Robust, yet smooth, with terrific complexity to the malt. A perfect beer to usher in summertime and leave winter behind. I'm definitely getting this again next year.","UnionMade","Sep 22, 2003"
3.91,3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This was a beer I anxiously anticipated and I am not disappointed at all...this is a quality beer and a treat..in my opinion it falls short of Capital's classic maibock and blonde doppel bock (which for some reason don't garner a lot of support from east or west coast tasters)..I digress...back to this beer...Very good..tasty...well made...I would definitely buy it again....","ZAP","Sep 02, 2003"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep hazy honey liquid with an impressive lasting creamy head. The aroma is both malty sweet and sharp with hints of caramel and honey. The initial malt flavor is quite raw with a deep, sharp bitter bite and minimum spice. The honey really comes through in the finish through a bitterness that expands through the brew. Very complex and tasty.","beernut7","Jul 02, 2003"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"With or without honey, this is a fine example of the style. I do recommend the larger Stoudts brewed bottles, instead of the 12 oz contract bottles. The little brothers of this never tasted this good.","RonfromJersey","Jul 01, 2003"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Honey double mai bock not as sweet as it once was and more hoppy than in recent years.. still a very drinkable Bock with a malty taste that keps asking for more. The alcohol is not really present until you have had a few and then stand up. Very fresh and balanced bock worth tasting.","bierman2000","Jun 26, 2003"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a crystal clear golden honey color that seemed to be decently carbonated. It produced a decent head of a light beige color, that was creamy, thick, sticky and lasted fairly well, and created some lace on the sides of the glass. Reviewing this beer was done in 2 stages, first pour, which would be straight from the cold, and second pour which allowed it to warm up several degrees. Cold aromas were of caramel, sweet malt, grains. Warm aromas were of caramel, flowers, light hops, sweet malt, grains, some leaf and light fruit. The taste (cold) were of sweet malt, hops (noble), grain, and a slight roasted malt. Warm tastes were of creamy sweet malt, noble hops, grains, alcohol, flowers, and a roasted malt. Aftertaste cold, dry flowers, hops. Aftertaste warm, malt up front mixed with hops in the back, creamy and balanced. Cold this beer was on the dry side, while warm it became creamy and pleasant, also warm produced a nice warming alcohol feeling. Cold, medium bodied, warm, slightly heavier body. A good beer fresh from the fridge, quenched the thirst. A much better beer as it warmed became creamier and filling. Decent for the style. My suggestion is to get the beer, take it out of the fridge, let it warm a few degrees and breath, then drink. You will enjoy.","Jarod","Jun 21, 2003"

3.85,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours with a firm head, white in color, attractive lacing as it subsides over deep golden liquid. The nose is sweet with suggestions of honey amid a firm malty base...nice flowery/grassy notes too. Taste is bittersweet, or sweet-bitter more accurately, with more honeyish tastes mixed with malt sweetness . Then a nice short-lived bitter blast of hoppiness appears to dry things out a bit. Finishes on a clean note...very much the quaffable brew.","beerluvr","0"
