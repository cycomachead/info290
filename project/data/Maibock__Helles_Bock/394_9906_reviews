"O: A pretty good beer. Hoppier than others in the style I have had. Probably not something I would go to all the time, but could see it being nice on a hot day or paired with a salad actually."

"Not among my favorite Mai-Bocks, but still good."
"Poured a deep dark amber, very clear with lots of streaming carbonation from the bottom of the glass, but no head. Slight amount of lace. Smell was very bready and grain like, with a hint of a slight bitterness, but definatly bread like. The flavor followed suit as it was highly malted and full of grain like flavors. Not much hops to balance, but ever so slightly dry finish. Kinda thin in feel, not enough carbonation to give it that silky smooth feel. Overall this was a decent offering from foothills, and an average representation of the style. The alcohol is very, I mean very well hidden, I could swear this was a 4% beer, was shocked to see it at 8% before my review. Overall definatly give this one a try if you can."
"Draft at Flannigan's Boathouse, Conshohocken. Annoying, bad waitress. Medium to dark gold with alot of a fluffy eggshell head. Sweet, hoppy aroma, flavor subtly floral hops, honey, candi sugar. Very well balanced. Enjoyed. Stoudt's seems to do these German styles well."
"M/D - too malty sweet for me to enjoy alot of, good carbonation and medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel"
"While they were successful in nailing down a decent interpretation of the style's trademark flavor, I wasn't really enjoying the boldness of the spice hammering away throughout. Tone it down and you got yourself a great brew."
"M/D - Medium bodied and lively carbonation. Very easy drinking maibock."
"The mouthfeel is light, highly drinkable."
"D - VERY easy to drink, no doubt."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Smooth, not overpowering in any aspect. Easily sessionable, I enjoyed this one."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy/creamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast, caramel/spice notes. The taste is sweet, malty, there's a slight yeast note, caramel and some spice in there. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little Maibock, thanks Mike."
"Body is on the heavier side of medium. Pretty smooth drinker. No alcohol detected, but it's 10 months after the bottle date. A rather inoffensive beer, but there's just not enough to it to make me want to drink more of it."
"D - This is a great spring beer...it was my first of the style and I think it was a pretty good start"
"10oz pour on-tap at The Pit served a crisp light orange with a thin eggshell head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma is a decent amount of crisp malts. The taste is an interesting blend of crisp sweet malts with a nice hop profile backing it up that leaves an interesting bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence, but still provides the refreshment expected in a Maibock. This one was certainly enjoyable."
"This is a very tasty beer I could see myself drinking on hot summer days."
"This beer pours a light hazy copper color. A nice thick, one finger, white foamy head caps off the pour. Great head retention that left thick sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Nose is of caramel malts up front, touch of honey and just the slightest hint of citrus hops. Taste is caramel malts up front - definitely sweet! Honey comes in after the caramel, and then is followed by some pale malts that I didn't pick up in the nose. Finish is where you get a touch of citrus hops - I'm picking up grapefruit. This is a medium to lighter body beer, decent carbonation, starts off crisp but has a sticky finish to it, touch of alcohol warms you. This is a nice beer - lower ABV would make it more drinkable, but it is a nice one to sit with."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, nice kick, very good representation of style, this is a beer that is well-worth drinking for a whole evening."
"D- With the taste and feel I knew this was over 5%, but i'm impressed that Stoudt's got all this flavor with only 7% ABV to show for it. I would not mind to drink three in an evening, it's just that enticing. Come spring time around may this seems like a no brainer and I will grab a 6er or more of fresh bottles."
"Overall: This is absolutely one of the best Maibocks I have ever had and proves why Stoudt's makes some of the best Lagers in the US!"
"I received this beer in a trade from mikereaser. This is the first Blonde double Mai Bock that I have ever tried, so I had no idea what to expect. I pulled this beer out of my fridge opened it and it foamed up all over my counter. fun fun fun. This beer poors a nice golden blonde color, and it has an interesting sweet malty smell. The taste is sweet, but not too overpoweringly sweet, with a bit of a hoppy bite. The 7% alcohol is well hidden. If this beer was available in Arkansas I would drink it quite a bit."
"A nice example of a style which I don't see too often. This is actually last year's bottling. Now that Stoudt's has come to NC I'll be looking for this one in the spring."
"On a side note, this is my first beer review."
"Overall, this is a great beer that I am kicking myself for only picking up one of."
"Drinkability: It's a bit too cloying to be on the same level as Sam Adams Boston Lager or Rogue Dead Guy, but overall this is a decent Maibock, well worth the cost. I'll be buying it again."
"Wasn't sure what to expect, I knew it was a little out of date but the 7% ABV would make it last a little longer. Tastes like a strong Kolsch if I had to describe it... a dark yellow in color with a bite a hint of alcohol in the after finish but not much at all. Very interesting.. listed under the same style as Dead Guy from Rogue which I thought tasted better, but this is a much better deal and for the price it was exceptional."
"D: Excellent brew from one of PA's solid breweries. Definetly one to grab if you can find (even go a bit out of your way to find), the style is pretty unique and this is a great sipping beer to represent. Not quite Dead Guy Ale, but close..."
"A clear golden color with a thin white head. Smells of spices and hops. Tastes of dry earthy hops, with spices mixed in well. The finish is very bitter, not too bad though, still a crisp refreshing beer that doesn't kill the taste bud but packs a big punch. Try it."
"D - I was not impressed by this brew. It seems to have an unbalanced sour/bitterness to it. Its possible I got a bad bottle or drank it past it's prime, but it's not a beer I would seek out again."
"Cheers!"
"The taste is quite sweet in the body, some grainy flavors emerge and there is a slightly vinous grape skin tinge to the beer; and then the biting spices come in on the back end. Also present are some citrus notes, and a very peppery bite on the end. The beer is quite oily on the tongue and full bodied. There aren't heaps of hops in this beer, but the spices add the bitterness. The hops are in the noble family. The 7% ABV is pretty well hidden. The thick pour and rich consistency makes this a not-every-down type bock. Watery and thin this is not."
"Dark gold or dark blonde color with light foam head and small active prickle. Mild grain nose with slight malt hints. Clean attack and grain heavy flavor. Some vague hints of of a macrobrew yet some sour notes toward the finish. A passable yet ordinary or average microbrew. I could see some mass appeal and I can easily envision a cooler full of this being a hit at a barbecue."
"Well, they stopped brewing this tasty little gem in May, so I guess I should put my lazy ass in front of the computer and review the beer before the small remaining supply dries up for the year. I have got to say, I likes what Stoudts does. Blondie here pours a brilliant honey-gold and atop sits a nice, tight little creamy head. She's a lass that's easy on the eyes, but can she hold a decent conversation? Before she opens her mouth though, I get a whiff of her perfume. Sweet, sticky malt and more than a hint of the clover honey they use to brew this seasonal. One sip later and I must confess, there is more going on here than just a pretty face. Fat malt sits on the palate, but it isn't too heavy or syrupy. Just big-boned. A dry bitterness runs down the sides of the tongue, lending a superb drinkablility and it all ends in a nice, honeyed finish that slides quickly down the throat. I can safely attest to having too many of these on several occassions, and though no animals were hurt in the events that followed, many a questionable camera phone picture was taken. So yes, I would say it is very quaffable and will cause your better judgement some problems. All in all, she is a fun girl who will take you for a wild ride given the right conditions."
"D: The sweet and oily is offset nicely by the dry and peppery. Quite malty and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Awesome for a summer beer. Not complex but refreshing enough to drink multiples of."
"Flavor is sweet grainy malt with some caramel and rolls to a spicy hop finish that lingers lightly on my palate. A very nice clean beer that hides the ABV very well and is easy to drink."
"D - this is a really enjoyable beer, especially now that it's warmer outside. It's a bit heavy and strong for a sessionable summer beer, but I could certainly do a few of these sitting in my place with the temperature in the mid-low 70's. Definitely give it a shot. Very inviting and refreshing."
"D - The flavor is full and has the intensity of a substantial Mai bock. The drinkability is good and this is one I would not hesitate to drink more than 1 of. I think I prefer this to the draft version, but both are very nice lagers and are very well made."
"Pours a nice golden color with frothy white head and great carbonation. Aroma is sweet, but not quite like a dopplebock. I get some honey, some malt and a little bit of hops in the aroma. A nice sweet start, very smooth taste with a malty character; a little bit of fruit in there (apples?). It's supposed to be 7 percent ABV, but you would never guess. Overall, a well-balanced beer."
"Very tasty, enjoyable brew that I would certainly have again."
"Worth a shot..."
"Poured into a goblet. Clear golden color with a nice white head. The carbonation is low even though it is a lager. The aroma is not dominant to any one thing. There is a slight scent of honey or wild flowers. The taste is sweet and malty, but overpowering. There is no balance, but I wouldn't expect there to be for a Mai Bock. The body is a bit thin, ut oh so smooth! The alcohol is well hidden. One that I would recommend."
"D - Welcome spring! This is a freah, very well made beer that delivers nice body and flavor while remaining relatively light-tasting."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and perfectly carbonated. I love this style and this is a great example. Stoudts continues to impress me with their German inspired beers. Highly recommended."
"This is actually a very good beer, and we will have it again soon!"
"Pours a very light clear copper hue with a puffy finger and a half off-white head that slowly fades to a thin layer of goodness. Bubbles race each other to the top of the glass, get in my belly. Chunky webbing left on the sides of the glass, I love it. Smell is pretty earthy to begin with, but the sweet caramel malt eventually emerges. Some grassy hops and sweet honey tickle the nose as well. Taste is a bit dirty up front with a some pepper and caramel malt. Some buttered biscuits and earthy hops midway that lead to the bready apple aftertaste. Medium body and a chewy feel with a soft carbonation. Very good representation of the style, I really wish more breweries would give maibocks a shot. Thanks Josh, the Scratch #8 awaits."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. The beer pours copper color with light amber hues. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice lacing. The aroma is grass, spicy hops, and biscuity malt. The taste is full of hops up front followed by enough malt to balance out the hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, maibock is one of my favorite styles, and this is certainly a good one. I like its large amounts of both malt and hops. I could happily drink this all spring."
"People enjoyed the verdant, springy aroma and taste. They thought the beer was a solidly drinkable one, even if some complained that it was ""missing something"" in the way of being a complete success."
"D_This is a nice spring beer when the weather is slightly chilly at night. The toasted malt is a nice effect and cuts through the sweet edge."
"D: Overall drinkability was ok, a tad bit over carbonated and a little coarse around the edges distracts from enjoyment."
" The 7.0% ABV, as many have noted on here, is only a number. I don't feel it at all as I'm enjoying this, since the mouthfeel and taste more than compensate for it. This isn't the best beer I've had lately, but for this time of the year, it fits well. It's lighter, less malty, and not as burnt/caramel as a regular bock. I have yet to sample a bad beer from Stoudt's and this is no exception. I wouldn't recommend this to the novice beer drinker, but for anyone who's got some ""palate"" under his/her belt, this is a great way to welcome in the warmer weather!"
"In the tradition of the Mai Bock, this is a perfect beer to be enjoyed in the spring. The herbal-citrus balance is a welcome prompt that a new season is on the way!"
"Flavors of sour fruit with a medium hopping. Crisp citrus lemon bitterness. Spicy dry finish with a yeasty bread aftertaste."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with creamy white head, good retention and great lacing. Smells of apricots, wheat, honey, spice, grass, and lemon. Tastes of grass mixed with wheat up front with a sweet honey and candied spiced fruit backbone, and a crisp lemon finish. Medium body with good carbonation, sweet and fruity with a nice crisp finish. Flavorful and easy to drink, very refreshing."
"Fairly hoppy for a Maibock, but still a pretty tasty beer. The aroma has a sweet fruity malt note and the flavor focuses on spicy, ground pepper hops with a light malt balance. There's a semi-dry finish with a medium bitterness. The body was on the light side of medium, and paired with moderate carbonation, made this a very drinkable beer. Try this Maibock if you like Euro hops."
"d: The 7% abv is not noticeable. This is certainly sessionable."
"D - Nice maibock with some sticky bitterness and plenty of sweetness to balance. Well done."
"A very unusual and enjoyable brew. A clear golden light amber color with a decent white head and medium lacing. The aroma is a toasted wheat cereal with a grape edge, maybe even some orange, very delectable, unique and intriguing. The flavor is a bit mellower than the aroma, a mild more of a piney hops background with a creamy feel. Very pleasantly surprising for a bock. At the back of your mouth is a very neat flavor that is like rye toast. Really nice, very smooth and easy drinking. Alcohol does not seem to strong but the taste is grand."
"Overall not too bad at all."
"One of my favorite seasonals from Stoudts. Appearance is red copper with a nice head that stays the entire glass. The smell is very sweet with lots of honey being the dominate flavor. The taste is very earthy with lots of honey at the front and the end. Leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. Mouthfeel is very nice. It is very light for a 7%. It has a nice light to medium body. I love this stuff and will keep drinking it as long as it is out. I will have to get a case the next time I go up. I nice light spring to early summer. Delicious!!!"
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. When I drank my first one, I wasn't sure it was really on style. However, it is a Helles Bock; however a bit unconventional. I'll probably drink this one again."
"Pours a light amber with just a collar for a head. The aroma is very sulphurous, although there is some mild Vienna malt backing and a hint of berry fruits. On the palate, brisk carbonation and overpowering sulphur, along with fairly robust acidity, combine for an impression that is, overall, unpleasant. Mouthfeel is big and brash, with nothing in the way of subtlety. Things get a bit softer, but no more interesting or well executed, at higher temperatures, but overall I'd have to pass on this one next time."
"A solid beer."
"I'll have to keep my eye out for more of this stuff, as it was quite tasty. Though, at 7% abv, one shouldn't have more than a few."
"Good beer."
"Cheers"
"D- A good beer from Stoudts. Another beer from them that I am sure would be worlds better fresh ontap at the brewery."
"Overall- Flavor was subdued and just wasn't exciting. Strong alc. content in this."
"D- Drinkable, decent beer overall. The alcohol is undetectable and that makes this a very drinkable brew."
"I'm not sure I ""know"" this beer after two bottles, but I will revisit it many times, and will certainly buy more than two bottles next run. It's a pleasant sipper, light yet surprisingly complex, and along with their Tripel, my favorite Stoudts offering so far."
"Scott"
"Light,smooth,just a slight bit watery,I expected it to have a bit more body. Very easy drinking,could drink a few of these,just not all night. A beer worth a try,would be a good beer for a wine drinker."
"Overall, a decent Maibock, from a brewery that I think makes some great beers, and some relatively poor beers. This one is pretty good. Pretty spot on for the style, I'd say this is definitely worth a try if you're a Helles fan."
"Drinkability - I could drink one or two of these, but no way would I do an entire six pack. The beer itself is solid, but nowhere near my loaf of bread. It's the first time I would call the malt character 'harsh'"
"Good body, and appropriate carbonation. Very easy to drink, flavorful, and enjoyable."
"The mouth is light-bodied, yet offer a nice velvety fruitiness, balanced out by the warm malts and late, mild surge of hops. Very drinkable--a great summertime beer that offers enough flavor to be acceptable. Solid."
"Poured a pale golden color with about a 1.5 inch pillowy, foamy head. Smelled like you just caught a whiff of someone making bread with their window open near the ocean on a warm spring day (no I'm not writing this while drinking). Taste was light and sweet. A bit of caramel flavor to go along with soft maltiness. Body was pretty light, although not watery. Overall, a nice beer but nothing outstanding."
"Really gold and very clear body with a small white head that turns to a patch in the center of the beer.Nice bubbles streaming to the top of the class.Corn smell and a faint hop smell Corny taste with a small hop taste and nothing else really.Mouthful is a bit syrupy but I think that is from the high abv.Quite refreshing and smooth.I like this but I was expecting a darker,more robust beer.It was solid though but nothing I would have again real fast in the future."
"Overall: A nice brew that quenched my thrist for a spring-time offering. Nice flavors and good balance."
"D- Not my cup of tea, but a well balanced beer overall."
"It poured a bright golden honey color that had a massive and I mean massive head of white pillowy foam. All I did was pour only an ounce or two of this beer and up comes this massive head of white foam from out of nowhere and almost overflowed this tall glass. The retention was too good because I had to wait 4 minutes before I could actually get to the beer itself. In it's aftermath, it left plenty of white sticky lace and white foamy rings around the glass. It had a light aroma of juicy fruits at first and then that drifted away into toasted grains, a touch of caramel, a dash of pepper, and into some crisp floral hops. The smell ended with the floral hops, but the taste began with those floral hops. After that there were some toasted malts, a small touch of juicy fruits, caramel, some spices, a slight drop of alcohol, and then it finished with those floral hops that were in the beginning of the taste. There was also some yeast in there, but of course that was only toward the bottom of the bottle. The mouthfeel was very light with moderate carbonation and with a very mild aftertaste of those floral hops that keep showing up again and again. The beer overall was a very nice light beer that's easily drinkable. I know it says it has 7% ABV, but I don't believe it. Would I drink another one? I wouldn't mind another one. I think this beer would make a good choice on a nice warm spring day."
"D: Don't pound this beer, the abv will whoop you quickly. It is, though, a good sipper with a lot going on."
"Drinkability: This hies its alcohol very well. Complexity might make it hard to drink for some."
"Deep golden center with pale gold edges; frothy, cottony, lacy, white head. Sugary malts, biscuits, light fruit, slightly funky hop spiciness. Taste starts out with sweetish, sugary, pear juice and candy. Light alcohol presence precedes an herbal, spicy-bitter hop finish. Pear rinds stick around for a while. Pretty good maibock. Medium body with a moderately syrupy feel. Nice carbonation. Surprisingly good, and I'll have to get more of this!"
"Overall this is a tasty and well-balanced beer. Very drinkable. The seven percent abv is notable but not a hinderance."
"This bock beer poured a clear, golden amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was malty: vinous Munich malt and biscuity malt. The taste was malty with light Munich malt flavor, but with a cereal grain flavor, and with a modest hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with full body and moderate carbonation. Overall it was dry but with a hint of sweetness. The aftertaste was also dry. This was fairly drinkable for its ABV, and the flavor grew on me."
"Mouth: Good mouthfeel of strong carbonation. Flavor is malty and light, very grainy with excellent malt and bread tastes. Nothing like the smell. Warmth comes up on the exhale making this one an okay drink even for cold weather. After taste is like sweet fresh bread plus a slight bitter hop flavor."
"Notes: will have to rerate a fresh batch."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sharp and tingly in the mouth... then subsiding slightly, the mouthfeel lumbers through its motions. Unfortunately this beer doesn't recover from the harshness of just about all of its attributes, and I am shocked at the outcome. Either this came from a bad batch or this beer is not what it was two years ago... horrifically disappointing."
"Cheers!"
"Final Thought: Stoudt's does it again with this refreshing but simple bock."
"If you want to drink higher ABV beers during the summer, maibocks are the way to go and this is a prime example of the style. Delicious!"
"It's not as sweet as it smells, nor as fruity...the combination comes together very nicely!"
"This beer pours a golden color with a slight red hue. Smell is pungent, mostly of malts with hint of alcohol. Taste is very refreshing, mostly with a slight hop flavor. As it goes down the stickyness of the large amount of malts comes through and cancels out the hop, but lingers with a slight zest. The malts linger for about 15 seconds, then slowly dissove with saliva. Mouthfeel is good, very drinkable... you may forget that its 7% and have more than a few!"
"This golden-amber brew happens to be one of the best American-made Maibocks Ive come across. The alcohol is well hidden, its quite smooth, its nicely grainy but dry, and its got that restrained apricot fruitiness that is typical of better German Maibocks. The finish is mild but lengthy. My only complaint is that its not as rich a Maibock can and should be. None the less, highly recommended."
"Pours a strawberry blonde color with a tannish head and some nice head. Smell is very hard to gage... a bit floral and sweet, but not potent. Taste is sweet and malty, a bit of hops, and fruity. Quite fruity. Mouthfeel is a bit sudsy and chewy. Overall mostly drinkable... but a little harsh, like they tried a bit too hard."
"A nice, beefy lager is what this is. Well balanced, well rounded, well done."
"Carbonated apple juice? That's what it looked like, at least - a translucent light brown with a lingering white head. Upon smelling it I noticed a slightly floral/citrus/apple aroma, with a sweet hint of alcohol. I detected appley (sp?) notes in the taste as well. Mostly it was a crisp and clean brew with a slightly hoppy finish that balanced the small hints of alcohol. I want to say it also had hints of ""sweet straw", whatever that means. Suitably carbonated and nice in the mouth, and a good drink. I liked it."
"Drinkability, None too good, unless you like Thick, flat, heavy and well you get it. Slid me a Hofbrau Mai bock. Dang it sounded great, what's with all the Honey?"
"Pours a full golden with a bit of an orange highlight on the sides. A smallish white head comes and goes but leaves a little fizziness. Smell is really sweet and candy like. Lots of honey and some white chocoate cookie sweetness. A touch of grassiness comes but is drowned out. Taste is also overly sweet and syruppy. Tastes almost like I'm drinking honey. This needs more of a dry malt base. The honey and candi corn like taste is a bit overbearing. Hops, yeast, any other malts are lost in translation. Maybe some slight herbal tendacies but they really get stuck in the stickyness of it all. The bubbly carbonation helps a bit. Maybe some styles shouldn't be made doubles?"
"Overall, considering the cost, this isn't a beer I'm liable to purchase again. An interesting variation to break up the day but nothing I'm thrilled about."
"Drinkability was average do the unbalanced nature of the beer. Expected better from these folks."
"Drinkablility: sigh....not that drinkable when you factor in below average taste and high alcohol"
"D: I'm not overly impressed with this beer. Nothing about it is bad, but nothing exemplary either. I'll pass on this again."
"Geez, this beer seemed like a winner until the flavor takes a dive."
"D - It is strong and generally mediocre with a sort of body that doesn't make you come searching for more. The foods I imagine that it would go best with would all go better with a pilsner. I don't think that I will have this again, but it would not be torture if I had to."
"A very surprising a full maibock with a hidden alcohol content. Very balanced brew."
"a go to for me personally. one of carol's best creations... always has been, hopefully always will. recommended."
"A very drinkable maibock. The complex flavor masks the high ABV as well."
"Partnership of very good mouthfeel and bitter finish.Fruity and honeyish and then the noble hops, grassy and it works. Not too comlex, but a delicate and very nice beverage and kudos again to Stoudts.Medium mouthfeel.Pilsner aroma.Appropriate carbonation."
"Finishes fairly quick with some residuals and a light bitterness."
"Overall, this one is fairly good as mentioned, but it's a touch below a ""4" beer. I can't really put my finger on what or why that is...maybe it's just because it's fairly straightforward and safe overall. It's worth a try."
"all and all a good beer but a little over priced here in lansing."
"The taste really lost me on this one. It had limited hops swirling around, even for a maibock. Though it started out as honey filled breadiness, it was quickly lost over to all grains. Mouthfeel wasn't as chewy as expected and came off as thin, little boozy warmth on the end. Finished sweet, but not with the feeling of needing future ones."
"A solid and interesting maibock, perfectly inbetween boring and complex, and enjoyable."
"Well brewed! Nicely balanced and very clean."
"D - very tasty beer, perfect for enjoying on the porch with a warm spring sun and cool breeze. Alcohol is slightly above average but not going to sit you down. Another fine offering from Stoudt's."
"Slàinte!"
"Nice Maibock here. Full of banana and light hop flavor on the back end. Wonderful malty goodness on the front end. Not much smell here but very drinkable. Medium bodied and nice mouthfeel to it. I recommend this one as this style is very hard to find, well maybe not hard to find, but hard to find a great one."
"899"
"It's got some hefty mothfeel to it and as far as drinkability... well ..how do like your bocks this time of year? This is an American classic example of an old world style we don't see enough of of."
"Wasn't too impressed with this one. Pours out to a deep gold color with a lively head of white foam. Broken lines of lace surround the interior of the glass. Very little aroma, but notes of roasted nuts and malts were detected. Flavors of hops and malt dominates, but goes nowhere, with little depth or development in the taste dept. Mouthfeel is crisp, but borders on watery. Drinkability is decent when you consider that this is 7% ABV. I've had better."
"Poured a deep golden color with modest white puffy head. Smell is fruity, bubble gum, malt and absolutely perfect. Taste is somewhat dissapointing. Its almost as if the smell promised me something that the taste just doesn't deliver. A strange metallic taste is at the front and any sweetness to be found is overpowered by a too strong hop bitterness. Very strong alcohol presence also noted. Finishes with very strong alcohol dominating all other tastes. In all the beers that I have reviewed I don't think I have ever had such varying scores for smell the different aspects of the rating. It was difficult to finish this beer. I'm glad I only bought one."
"Low-medium body, not too complex, but complex enough to keep your interest."
"All in all , a decent beer...not one to rave about, but pretty good."
"Clear dark orange with a smallish white bubbly head that leaves a light coating of lace. Sweet and fruity with light notes of honey. Some bready malts were in the aroma as well. Flavor was similar with the sweet fruit and honey over doughy malts. Very light hoppiness. Pretty thick body, almost too much so for this beer. Easy drinking enough I finished the bottle without problems but I dont know if I would come back for seconds."
"Pours out in a pretty golden stream, filling the glass. Results in a thin head that dissipates to a ring. Light lacing. Smells of sweet malt, a little oxidation, nothing outstanding, but ok. Tastes sweet, malty, barely noticeable bitterness. somewhat cloying. Good mouthfeel, not overcarbonated, very smooth. Overall a nice beer, but nothing worth writing home about."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and moderately carbonated."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a warming, crisp, dry finish."
"Drinkability: Interesting flavor profile but that finish is off-putting"
"This was nice, but I don't know quite what to think of it. It looked nice. Deep clear orange with big, fluffy white head and decent retention. Thick lacing. Smell was sweet with a definite yeast presence. There didn't seem to be a whole lot to the taste, although it was very clean and had a smooth finish. This seemed kinda big and had a heavy presence in my mouth. Pleasant, but filling. I dunno. This one was a bit strange being pleasant but void of taste simultaneously. Weird."
"recommended. stoudt's is really impressing me lately with anything i choose by them. maybe its time for a visit to pa."
"A bit thin in the mouth. Not enough going on here to bring me back."
"A solid and very drinkable beer"
"Maibock is not a style I have come across frequently, so I cant speak for the faithfulness of this beer to the claimed style. On its own merit, I found it to be an enjoyable strong lager."
"Prosit!"
"Tasted: 06/04/05"
"Overall Impression: Really enjoyed this beer. Nice full Bock flavor with a great color. Recommended!"
"Nice amber color, decent head when poured into a tulip. Smells clean and malty, maybe like new bread. Taste is big and malty, a nice, middle of the road bock. Some German hops on the finish. I'm not picking up too much of a honey sweetness, but rather the 'biting' sensation you get when eating a spoonful of raw, real honey, you know? (not the clear, processed stuff from the grocery store, but honey with character) Mouthfeel is decent. Drinkability is about one for me, but it's a sipper that goes down very nicely. Not sure of the age of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised."
"A malty, doughy, pastry-like sweet aroma is the first thing that I noticed about this beer. Theres essentially no hops in the aroma, but instead theres a very appealing malt-character, a slight undertone of sulfur, a little butterscotch, and an earthy yeastiness. The beer is a deep amber color, with just a little haze and a beautiful stable head. The lace is intricate, interlocking, and truly beautiful. The flavor is sweet and malty, with very little hops and very little roasted character. The label says that the beer is brewed with honey, but I had a hard time picking it out. Its blended very well with the malt. Considering the ABV and the amount of flavor, the body has a lightness about it. This is a wonderful brew!"
"Pours with a one-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Low carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is malty. Starts with semi-sweet raisins, finishes mellow with just a hint of bitterness, the higher ABV is not noticable. $2.05 for a 12oz bottle from Oliver's Beverage Albany, NY."
"Thanks to santoslhalper for the sample."
"In the glass it's a very nice clear amber brew with a decent orange-tinted head that went away quickly. Leaves a little ring around the top of the beer, and some nice spotty lacing the whole way down the glass. A very sweet smell with a tiny hint of spices and alchohol. Mostly malty. Very good smelling though, draws you right in. A nice and warm tasting beer. Starts off very smooth with a full malt body, hints at honey and fruits. Finshes with a bit of a hop bite, a nice bitter grass flavor. Very well done. So well balanced, it will keep drinking for quite some time. Hides it's 7% ABV very well, so drink carefully. ;-)"
"I can't quite put my finger on the reason(s), but Stoudt's Blonde Double MaiBock impresses me. It isn't great at anything, but it's good at all things. Sort of a 'bock of all trades'. Forget justification, I just like it."
"Taste was interesting, smooth yet heavier than most Mai Bocks I've had. Low carbonation reminiscent of a Barley Wine. Sweet fruits with very little hop character, but a larger alcohol warming in the end. Oily feel wasn't refreshing was a bit over-bearing. I liked it but not enough to buy another."
"This beer looks fantastic with an orangish gold glow and sparkling carbonation, but could use a nicer, longer lasting head. Smell is a sweet fruity malt and a faint earthy hop. Taste is a melting pot of flavors of residual honey sweetness, tangy peach fruit, and earthy but indescrete hop flavor. Following is a warming alcohol burn that is not overpowering. This is comparable in taste and drinkability to a triple, and very enjoyable."
"This arrived as a wonderfully active beer with a lot of carbonation and a thick, white head dotted with bubbles. It was of a beautiful light amber color approaching a golden yellow. I noticed a sweet, honey-like fragrance on the nose. There was a sort of hot mouthfeel on the tongue, but it was neither overpowering nor lingering. It has a sweet bite, not of honey, but of something else that I just cannot put my finger on. There is maltiness evident in the mouth. Finally, the finish is crisp, perfect for a huumid afternoon in PA for someone who does not really like hefeweizens."
"I'll start by saying that I really enjoyed this beer. This style is right up my alley, even with the alleged ""generous amount of honey"" added. It poured a deep amber with a beautiful, pillowy head. The immediate aroma is sweet malts followed by a nice hoppiness. The taste is malty sweet, heavy on the honey and with some hints of orange and nice hops on the tail end. The body was silky and smooth. It's very easy to drink and is enjoyable the whole way through. In my opinion, it shares a lot in common with Rogue Dead Guy (my all-time favorite, anytime beer) BUT the Blonde Double Maibock can be overly sweet and the alcohol catches up with you pretty quickly if you're enjoying more than one (hence my lower drinkability score). Overall, it's a tasty beer that I'll definitely enjoy again and recommend to others."
"Note: My bottle read ""Blonde Double Maibock"" and stated that it was brewed under contract in Fredericksburg, MD for Stoudt's"
"A nice, not your everyday brew to be had here, though it could be. Its appearance is a pure copper clear with mild carbonation that provides a good off-white head that laces well, some sticky rings. The aroma is sweet malt, hints of citrus and honey. The taste is pure caramel malts with a hints of the honey, though not too sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth, and chewy. The beer is so smooth, drinkability is favored. Over-all a suprise, for this was the first for me of this style and this brewer. Good stuff!!"
"Nice copper color ...decent initial head...leaves very nice lacing. Smell is malty, fruity with a honey presence. Taste is full with a strong malt presence, honey element are present mainly in the smoothness it gives. Mouthfeel is rounded, chewy and reminds you to sip this offering. Mouthfeel is heavy IMO. A bit oily also, but not in a distarcting way. Light bitterness in the finish. Alchol presence is there too. I'm not a big lager fan...but this was a good brew."
"Appearance: Deep amber honey golden hue with a nice creamy texture creamy orange tinted head, leaves intricate even lacing down my glass. Aroma: Rich sweetness with alcohol around the edges. A mild touch of fruitiness but overall there's alot of depth in this brew finishes with a touch of German Noble hops. Taste: Very quaffable big malty layers of reserved fruit and alcohol, but so damn tasty all topped off with a mild dose of semi herbal grassy hop flavoring with low bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and slightly sticky even carbonation no complaints. Drinkability: Great stuff, easily consumed and great flavor profile."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, fluffy 1/2"" light beige head formed, which although being somewhat short lived, laced ok. Brew is an orangey-copper hue and has an aroma which first brings to mind the alcohol you'd expect from a dopplebock, but in this case it is tempered by a pleasant fruity essence. Taste is remarkably well-balanced for a dopplebock, with the fruitiness adding a nice dimension and the honey smooths the ride. None of the cloying sweetness that some achieve. Very easy drinking, kind of scarily so, largely because of the impressive mouthfeel."
"This is my first real maibock so I may be biased, but I really enjoyed this one a lot. This poured a clear orange-gold with a sticky, frothy white head which left medium lacing down the glass. The smell was sweet caramel malts, dried fruits (pears, raisin) and a touch of floral hops. The taste had a heavy malt base with nice fruit and floral overtones. The mouthfeel was smooth and very clean, but had an assertive bitterness near the end to cleanse the palette. Overall, it was a little ""sticky"" but I liked it -- the alcohol was very warming but hidden extremely well --- I finished a 750ml with no problem and a nice buzz... so yes, very drinkable indeed."
"EDIT: I went outside and this beer makes a lot more sense."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is good. It has a bitter musty smell with the addition of light crystal malts. The taste is great. For a higher abv., it goes down smooth and has good flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a real sessions beer; a good drinker."
"This is probably the best beer from Stoudt's that I've had. Robust, yet smooth, with terrific complexity to the malt. A perfect beer to usher in summertime and leave winter behind. I'm definitely getting this again next year."
"This was a beer I anxiously anticipated and I am not disappointed at all...this is a quality beer and a treat..in my opinion it falls short of Capital's classic maibock and blonde doppel bock (which for some reason don't garner a lot of support from east or west coast tasters)..I digress...back to this beer...Very good..tasty...well made...I would definitely buy it again...."
"Prost!"
"A bit tangy for me but well done."
"Pours a deep hazy honey liquid with an impressive lasting creamy head. The aroma is both malty sweet and sharp with hints of caramel and honey. The initial malt flavor is quite raw with a deep, sharp bitter bite and minimum spice. The honey really comes through in the finish through a bitterness that expands through the brew. Very complex and tasty."
"With or without honey, this is a fine example of the style. I do recommend the larger Stoudts brewed bottles, instead of the 12 oz contract bottles. The little brothers of this never tasted this good."
"Honey double mai bock not as sweet as it once was and more hoppy than in recent years.. still a very drinkable Bock with a malty taste that keps asking for more. The alcohol is not really present until you have had a few and then stand up. Very fresh and balanced bock worth tasting."
"This beer poured a crystal clear golden honey color that seemed to be decently carbonated. It produced a decent head of a light beige color, that was creamy, thick, sticky and lasted fairly well, and created some lace on the sides of the glass. Reviewing this beer was done in 2 stages, first pour, which would be straight from the cold, and second pour which allowed it to warm up several degrees. Cold aromas were of caramel, sweet malt, grains. Warm aromas were of caramel, flowers, light hops, sweet malt, grains, some leaf and light fruit. The taste (cold) were of sweet malt, hops (noble), grain, and a slight roasted malt. Warm tastes were of creamy sweet malt, noble hops, grains, alcohol, flowers, and a roasted malt. Aftertaste cold, dry flowers, hops. Aftertaste warm, malt up front mixed with hops in the back, creamy and balanced. Cold this beer was on the dry side, while warm it became creamy and pleasant, also warm produced a nice warming alcohol feeling. Cold, medium bodied, warm, slightly heavier body. A good beer fresh from the fridge, quenched the thirst. A much better beer as it warmed became creamier and filling. Decent for the style. My suggestion is to get the beer, take it out of the fridge, let it warm a few degrees and breath, then drink. You will enjoy."
"Very good beer. Thanks Gavage for the recommendation."
"Pours with a firm head, white in color, attractive lacing as it subsides over deep golden liquid. The nose is sweet with suggestions of honey amid a firm malty base...nice flowery/grassy notes too. Taste is bittersweet, or sweet-bitter more accurately, with more honeyish tastes mixed with malt sweetness . Then a nice short-lived bitter blast of hoppiness appears to dry things out a bit. Finishes on a clean note...very much the quaffable brew."
"I havn't had many maibocks, but this is the best i've had, better than dead guy IMO. Great Brew"
"Note: This bottle is clearly labeled as ""Blonde," not Honey, MaiBock. The ABV is also higher than that listed for the Honey labeled MaiBock."
