Possibly but a sweet, caramel malty lager type aroma is what is predominant here. Caramel, and toffee, hints of buttery like notes persisting now as it comes up in temperature. Fades smoothly, leaving a creamy and sweet flavor on the tongue that snaps back with a nice hop bite at the finish.","mikesgroove","Aug 04, 2011"

The nose comprises grasses, wheat, floral hops, and a touch of citrus rind. The taste holds notes of honey, maple syrup, citrus and floral hops, and a touch of sweet corn. The body is a heavy light/light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that borders on crisp. Overall, a nice bit o' lager, one that I would return to if given the chance.","TMoney2591","Jul 24, 2010"

3.65,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Quite drinkable, this is a nice amber lager, though not worth getting too excite about. The aroma promises more malt complexity than the flavor delivers and there isn't much in the way of hop character to make up for it. It is nice to seem more American breweries attempting flavorful lagers; and while this is a good one, it has a little further to go before it catches up to the great, classic lagers of the world.","nickfl","Aug 20, 2009"
3.68,0,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Dark amber color. Mild prickle with no head to speak of after I pour this into a pint glass. Neutral nose that has barely detectable grain and malt presentations. The attack is fresh and clean with an almost sweet presentation and flavor. The finish is pretty clean with a mild malty aftertaste. A seemingly simple beer, but it is very well put together. All the components seem to be in harmony with a little of this and a little of that.","Ragingbull","Aug 20, 2009"

3.8,3.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I love that Full Sail is brewing quality lagers and making them available at a pretty affordable price.

I'll probably pick this up again sometime in the future.","josiahschlender","Jun 27, 2009"

3.65,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Good amber lager with a nice mix of malt and spicy hops. The beer pours a light orange-amber color, a shade lighter than other Amber Lagers that I've come across. The head is white and dissipates fairly rapidly with a moderate amount of lacing. There's a pretty good malt presence, although it isn't terribly interesting, light caramel and a bit of biscuit. The hops are mildly spicy and also not incredible. However, the balance is good, and the aftertaste is also quite pleasant. There is some alcohol presence; it's stronger than your average lager. At any rate, it's a good beer, and hopefully, other American breweries will take note and release more different lagers.","popery","Jun 08, 2009"

3.23,-12.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"When all is said an done this leaves me with the impression of high end malt liquor, which would be decent for warming up in cool months, and only really palatable in small doses, a bottle a sitting. If they'd be willing to tweak this into more of a maibock they'd have a winner, as everything else is in place for that.","IronDjinn","May 31, 2009"
3.78,2.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Overall this beer was very enjoyable, lots of rich malty, cake like flavors, which I did enjoy. Not a strong hop presence in this one, but just enough to make a decent balance and leave you wanting more. Not much to say, but I think this is a solid beer, and better yet it's priced very cheap, 6.99$ a 6pack in CA. For the price & quality Id say seek this one out. Cheers!","PintOHops","May 16, 2009"

3.66,-0.5,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Good flavor on this lager, with an amber malt profile that suggests caramel, biscuit, and a toasted nuttiness. Thankfully the hops are much more evident in the flavor than they were in the aroma, as a spicy punch of Saaz gets delivered the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbonated, with a refreshing and crisp finish. Overall, Ltd#2 is a solid, sessionable lager of which I'm glad I purchased a sixer.","wagenvolks","Apr 19, 2009"
3.36,-8.7,4,3,3,4,4,"12 oz bottle poured into a seidel. Clear light copper color with a small but dense cap of beige foam. Aroma is tangy and malty, toasty and orangey. Flavor is bready with some mild citrus and an almost milky texture. A touch of earthy hops and even a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish. A little light on flavor for the abv. Soft smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. This beer is having an identity crisis. Does it want to be a strong lager? It has the abv but not the flavor. Does it want to be a refreshing, lighter lager? It has the body but too much abv. Decent, but LTD 01 was better.","illidurit","Apr 18, 2009"
3.47,-5.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours amber with no head. Malty and a bit tangy with yeast with the barest bit of earthy hops on the finish. The taste is somewhat grassy and with some malt sweetness, but with none of the yeasty tanginess I like in the style. Fairly one dimensional and simple, and with just enough hops to balance. Smooth, and relatively drinkable, but lacks interest.","Georgiabeer","Apr 15, 2009"
3.69,0.3,2.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Pours a clear, light orange-red with a thin white head that dissappears quickly into a good collar. Nice aroma of malt and hops. Taste is well balanced but simple. Some malt and cereal grains with some hops. A slight bitterness develops in the aftertaste. Beer is thin and light on the tongue. I enjoyed the flavor and since it is light I recommend it as a session beer.","tbeck","Apr 08, 2009"
3.98,8.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a lovely golden brown color with a light, whispy white head and some decent lacing action on the glass. Slight caramelly aroma. Mighty smooth flavor of caramel malt and a slight grassy, herbal hops that hides in the background, and sort of sneaks up at you right on the end. This is one of those beers that certainly isn't a flavor explosion, but really well crafted, very smooth, well balanced, goes well with a lot of food. A real pleasure to drink.","RunDWP","Apr 05, 2009"

Taste is also light, though nevertheless interesting. Light and malty without being too sweet or too watery. Maltiness lingers nicely and gives a nice lasting impression. Alcohol (6.4!? i'd never have guessed!) hidden well. Just a scratch above thin bodied, about right.

4.12,12,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The taste is similar, quite malty, caramelly and a bit sweet with raisins, grain, a light bite of alcohol, hints of grass and grapefruit, a Vienna-like leafy-caramelly grain quality.

4.12,12,4,4.5,4,4,4,"One of my first favorite craft brews. Pours a pale amber-orange with a one and a half finger tan head that recedes fairly quickly. Smells of deep sweet and bready malts, well beyond what you would expect from an ""American"" lager. Caramel and candy aromas are also mixed in. Taste involves a certain biscuity essence which is offset by some creamy banana and then some subtle hops which even things out. This beer resides somewhere between summer and autumn, and heaven and hell, depending on your preference.","stephens101","Sep 04, 2008"

Mouthfeel is medium, it's smooth, has a decent body to it and a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is OK, but it seems a little too un-naturally sweet.

Mouthfeel is quite heavy for the style which I'm still a bit on the fence. I really like the body of the beer but it didn't quite fit with expectations.

It was an attractive medium honey color with thick foamy head that had a variety of bubble sizes and active bubbling in the body. The aroma was mild, and malty with a hint of yeast. The taste is clean, refreshing malty intial flavor with a short lived lightly bitter aftertaste. It was light bodied with relatively dry texture and active carbonation. This is a tasty summer lager that is refreshing an easily drinkable. I would definitely buy it again when in the mood for a lightish beer that is not overly complex.

I get grassy hop in the dry finish. Possibly the only thing keeping this from being a 5 in my mind, now that I see it is an all-malt, is that it is a little hefty on the palate, and lacks the crispness of its brother, Session.

It is pretty sweet and malty, but refreshing and finishes cleanly, and did not was not at all syrupy. Not a lot to say about this one other then it was a pleasant surprise and they go down easy. The mouthfeel was pretty light in spite of the malt, helped by the liveliness of the active carbonation. This was a very drinkable lager, although a bit dangerous at 6.4% ABV.

Sweet and malty lager to begin with then a refreshing zesty hop burst mellows the sweetness out so it doesnt ever reach cloying. Maybe a little tiny bit grainy in the finish, but it goes well.
