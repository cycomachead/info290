review_text
"This is a solid beer in my opinion. There is a balance between the bitterness and sweetness. You can not taste the 7% abv in the beer. I would get this beer over a Heineken beer if your into lagers. Overall this is a good beer smooth and refreshing. This is my first time buying any kind of  Gordon Biersch beer. So far no disappointment from this company. When I'm not in my hoppy mood or dark style kind of beers I would get another six pack of this beer. My review probably doesn't give outsiders a good evaluation but I have not had too many Blonde Bocks and this one is good until proven otherwise."
"Not my favorite style but I liked it better than the first time I had it."
""
"Ok, but wanted a bit more flavor."
"Not a fan of this beer at all. GB has a few good beers...for me this wasn't one I them"

"According to the brewery's website, I should not be able to buy this beer within a hundred miles of where I live, but I actually bought a six pack at Front Street Market in Butte, Montana. It was 7-something a six pack on sale."

"Overall –A bit sweeter and less malty then I was anticipating, but very pleasant none the less. A nice brew for the price."

"The Verdict: Good beer. A solid, well balanced bock offering. Nothing out of the ordinary maybe, but exactly what it’s supposed to be. You really can’t ask for more than that."
""
""
"Overall I would only recommend this beer to someone who likes trying different bock style beers. It did come in a variety 12 pack so I'm hoping there is some gold left in it."

"Overall - If there's one thing Gordon-Biersch does well, it's lagers. This one is no exception. A clean, fairly crisp and well-balanced maibock with nice character. A fine example of a style that's not so common in the U.S."

"GB allows its brewers to perform.It is apparent from the reviews here that some excel and some don't. This GB brewer (Cheektowaga, NY) got it right."

"A mild drink overall without any offensive notes... or redeeming qualities."
""
""
"Nothing special, but paired with some salty snacks it's ok."
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, biscuit, and some fruity notes. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a bit strong but drinkable."
""
""
"Overall- Boring and uninspired. It was drinkable but utterly forgettable."
""
"On tap at Hopmonk, Sebastol location. A decent serviceable blond. Slightly yeasty ""dirty blonde"" flavour which was fine on a 26 degree Fall day. A bit funky as a result, but I was expecting something cleaner and a mild hoppy ale. Significant retained head on light blond body. Carbonation above average."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice blonde color with noticeable carbonation. Smell is malty, a little grainy. Not great, but appropriate. Tastes malty and clean with a smooth feel. An extra kick from the alcohol is nice. Overall I wouldn't say this is a great beer, but it's a pretty good attempt at a Maibock, which unfortunately I don't see much of around these parts."
"This beer pours up a copper color with not much head to speak of and no lacing. Smell is oranges, grass, and bread. Mouthfeel is pretty nice. Just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is sweet and malty on the front giving way to gradual hoppiness on the finish. Not the best beer ever, but a very drinkable one."
""
""
""
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a light orange amber with a thin white head and no lacing. Light bready malt aroma. Light, sweet, bready malt, a hint of hops and some light adjunct flavors. Eh… Not bad a bad beer, but a mediocre bock."

"Overall - A solid summertime beer. This is a good choice for relaxing in warm weather while watching the sun set. Pairs well with spicy and saucy type foods such as barbecued ribs, and has a descent kick with it's 7% ABV."

"This was another solid offering from GB. They seem to take plain old German styles and jump them up a notch. This is a very nice take on another typical Lager style."

"Looking at the other raters, I must have gotten a bad pour or something. To me it was a heavy alcohol bite with a bad finish. Either way, I’ll stay away from this one in the future."
"My pour resulted in two fingers of French-Vanilla colored head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose was malty, but not as pronounced as in their Fest Bier. It had a pleasant malty character without being overwhelming, nor was there a lot of heat evident, which I sometimes get in bocks. Mouthfeel was on the full side, not creamy, but more towards viscous and the sweetness also had a slight metallic tang behind it. Finish was moderately sweet, but not to the point of being cloying. This was a pleasant beer, but I probably would not want a whole lot of it at one time."
""
"Overall a pretty decent beer, not very offensive but not the greatest offering from Gordon Biersch. It's worth the purchase inside the Winter 12 pack, however."
""
""

"O- Solid beer, but probably not something I would recommend or pursue again."
"O - Decent but nothing to scream about. I prefer many of the other Gordon beers over this one but it is not bad."

"Dr: Drinkable but pretty crap. I'll never have it again."

"I was expecting something quite pale and light, given GB's other beers, but this was deeper and richer than I expected"
"Poured a clear bronze color. Flat: almost no carbonation, and certainly no head. I was skeptical, but I picked it up anyway. aroma of grains and sweet malts. Sweet and malty taste, but very light--though still a little more flavorful than an Old E. Very mild and bland for the most part; kinda just tasted like thin malt juice. Light-bodied, and not very drinkable. It's probably just best to play it safe and avoid this one."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of biscuts and malts, a touch of caramel. Taste is also biscuty, some malts, a touch of hops kicks in at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"It has good hoppy aftertaste - subtle and well mannered. The rest of the malt and hops are well balanced. I wonder if it is any better on tap."
"O: It's alright, looked and smelled a lot better than it tasted."
"O-Don't care for it."
"This beer pours a hazy, gold color with no head or lace. The aroma begins with citrus with hints of dough and vanilla as well. The flavor has a malty sweetness with orange, honey, vanilla notes with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Well balanced. It has a medium mouthfeel and is very drinkable. Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock is a refreshing, good beer, highly recommended."
"The CPJ"
"Overall a decent drinkable brew with a sweet sticky metallic aftertaste. Although the moderately high ABV does make it easier to partake after each swallow."
"This is a very good beer in my opinion. The born on date was on January 6 2010 so it is pretty fresh. It has a sweet taste whick is easy to drink. The smell is refreshining and rather fruity and sweet. It's not very hoppy which is fine with me. If you like light beer with a kick and gratifing taste you will like Gordon. It's easy to drink and doesn't leave a bad after taste. Mouthfeel is superb. Chill it."
"Aroma starts out sour, gets bready sweet, and has a light noble hop background. Appearance is light gold with a well maintained white head. Flavor is high caramel malt sweetness forward with moderate bittering but a low noble bittering character. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with a medium high carb texture. Overall, fairly easy drinking, and rich but not complex."
"The mouthfeel is pleasant though, it has a fairly robust body, and a good level of carbonation. The drinkability is a mixed bag. The sweetness does make it a bit hard to drink, but it does mask it's 7% ABV quite well, have to toss it some points there. That said, I wound up having to drain pour a good third of this, it was just way too sweet. A well-done beer, just not quite to my tastes. Those who like their beers sweet should give this a shot."
"Bottomline: IF I wanted to introduce a weakling to bock beer---it is a good beer to ween them."
"O'all - fairly clean, but a fairly bland bock. Rich, but not very exciting."
"One finger cream white head, fairly quick dissipation resulting in broken layer of head, minimal lacing. Deep gold clear body multiple streams of rising carbonation. Nose is sweetish malt, some dry malt for balance, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, blah, pretty non-descript taste profile, minimal hop presence and not a distinctive malt profile. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium decent effervescence. Drinkability inhibited by lack of distinctive taste and noticeable alcohol. Not my favorite GB beer. Pass."
"decent drinkability...although it is 7% abv!"
"D- Nice and well balanced beer. Slightly above average. Nothing to write home about, but better than average."
"Overall a nice beer. It is nothing amazing but it is tasty."
"Pours a clear dark gold with a medium head which dissipates quickly. Smell is very mild sweet malt. Taste is very malty- sweet and a little toasty. Some fruit notes- apples etc. Just a hint of hops in the finish. Nice full bodied mouthfeel and well carbonated. Easily drinkable. Very nice overall."
"In looks and taste, this blurs the lines between bock and maibock, and has a bit of an American wheat/hefe weizen sort of thing, with that banana character (and other tropical fruits). Gordon Biersch isn't exactly the hippest and hype-est amongst beer cognoscenti, but I thought this offering was quite good, which must mean I'm still a newbie."
"While I didn't get too much of the Hallertau spiciness in the nose, it immediately presented itself with the first sips of beer. Along with the spiciness, which was only exacerbated by the fine-bubbled carbonation, it had a bitterly sweet presence that intertwined with grainy malts and a zesty alcoholic bite that warmed me after each swallow. It holds a very solid medium mouthfeel that seemed to press the lighter bitterness into the roof of my mouth while the heavier alcohol and malts slid over my tongue. It was a curious sensation to say the least. My only complaint with this brew is that it leaves quite a sticky bitter, almost sour, aftertaste; but with 7% ABV, it proved itself to be remarkably quaffable once I got going."
"Gordan Biersch reminds me a lot of Sam Adams, always playing it safe to please the masses. It's a good beer overall, very drinkable at 7% ABV but i can't help feeling that GB should put out something that is a little more robust."
"D - Not bad, it's like an average Bock and I liked that it wasn't too sweet like allot of Bocks tend to be. I didn't like that the flavor profile was a bit boring. I could set down with a couple over some food but I won't go out of my way to buy it again. Worth a try I suppose, especially for Bock fans. Cheers!"
"D- a great beer to sit beside the fire with on a cool autumn night, very quaffable"
"Appearance has a nice golden amber with a thin head with no lace. Smell, although somewhat faint is rich in malts, mild fruits and honey. Taste has mild but rich malts that carry a honey note that is mildly hoped. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium with just enough carbonation to make it go down easy. I wouldn't consider it a true for the style, but not bad."
"Overall: This is not bad with a year on it so fresh must be great. I finally found a fresher bottle so i'll do a comparison and update my review accordingly."
"Very great beer overall, because of the contract work and multiple brewpub location they do get shot down in the community, but I think this is a exceptional beer."
"Took a chance on this one as the last 2 six packs had a freshness dating of December 2009. However this is still a very tasty beer with tons of flavour( still tasted fresh ). The beer is hoppy and also slightly sweet though age might have dried it out. I liked the balance of the malt and hops and found it true to the style. Gordon Biersch is turning into one of my most underated breweries as the Hefe is also a great buy"
"Drinkability? It's not a bad beer at all, but I'm not buying it again. I like slightly higher quality beers if I'm going to pay a good amount of money for them."
"D- Great drinker deserves better than a C"
"Overall this is a fine bock. One of Gordon Biersch's best brews. Worth seeking out."
"Notes - I hate to say it, but this is not a very good beer. The hops and malts are muted enough that the alcohol is the dominant flavor, and it's not a pleasant, rounded alcohol flavor, either. It's harsh and medicinal. The malts are trying to balance, but they just don't have the presence they need. Unless you're a Gordon Biersch fan, I recommend you pass on this one."
"D- easy to drink, no bad in any way but lack of character would keep me from returning to it."
"Gordon Biersch makes decent German lagers, I have not been disappointed in any of this breweries beers I have tried. Blonde Bock is no exception and is another good solid beer."
"Not for beer lovers, at all."
"Medium body and medium carbonation. Overall nothing really stands out about this but it is still enjoyable enough to merit having once in a while."
"Overall, a well crafted, good tasting brew. I don't drink many Bock's but GB seems to get these right. I would buy again and would seek out to try on draft."
"Expensive for what it is."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was average as you can tell by my rating. The beer poured a cloudy gold color and had an off white head. Smell was sweet and yeasty. The taste was fruity and rather confusing. I will not buy this again, it was not great."
"Nice, easy drinking beer. Easy to have a few of these, I like it."
"Drinkability: It's sweet, it's smooth and an overall okay blonde bock."
"Notes: I've never had this style before so maybe I just don't care for it, but the two other people drinking this with me agreed. It was not all the pleasant. Not that great of flavors and what was there was not balanced. The flavors seemed much too thin to support such a high alcohol beer. Just seemed out of whack. We all agreed we probably wouldn't drink this again."
"drinkability: solid beer that I would atleast drink, but not a beer lovers beer at all."
"Drinkability- ok I would drink it again, not on the list of ones I need but it's ok"
"Overall: Some complexity and depth to the malt, with a clean finish. I enjoyed this beer, and will look for it again. A local expert (in my opinion) at Five Points Bottle Shop recently shared some beers with the owner and brewer of Gordon Biersch. And from what I understand, the yeasts come from German lines and GB is faithful to the lager styles that they brew."
"Fairly drinkable and a pretty decent take on the Helles Bock style. Not too far off in any direction; accessible and quite tasty."
"Drinkability: decent beer."
"Tastes of light floral notes, with some earthy hops in the back. This beer is very subtle. So suble that its very hard for me to pick out individual flavors. Its good however, Defenite complexity, and the lager finish really works for this beer. It his the abv well, and goes down wuite smoothly. I really like this beer, I don't love it, but i liek it a lot."
"D - I rate this good, it is a drinkable beer, but when fitting to style, not so much."
"Pours a pale dark yellow colored body, with a small whitish color head, small and diminishing. Has a vegetable-y aroma, and some maltiness. Not too bad, somewhat enticing. Has a vegetably taste, some sourness. Malty, not good."
"D- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this beer. There really isn't any complexity at all with this one, and it is pretty much all alcohol. I don't see myself purchasing again in the future."
"An okay bock, a little on the lighter side. Very drinkable though."
"Pours rather translucent with thin white head that disappears. Nose is faint with some some honey, and maybe melon. Palate delivers the expected malt focus, light hops, good carbonation and alcohol warmth. Very drinkable, and a style that is underappreciated, unfortunately."
"It is drinkable, but not a beer I would grab for all the time."
"12 oz. Clear dark gold pour. White head, nearly non-existent, but a little ring does stick around. Aroma is some grapefruit, a little pine, a little Heineken(meh). The flavor has some nice malt with a little citrus and pine. Pretty lively mouthfeel. Unfortunately the over-riding tone to me in this is that ""Heinie"" flavor. Not quite sure I would even classify this as a bock. OK, as far as bocks go anyways. Could drink a few, but will only do so since I bought a sixer. I wouldn't bother trying this more than once. A Heinie clone for comparison sake."
"Beer poured gold with a very long lasting white head. Nose is malt city with some corn lingering in the back. Taste is very sweet with a hint of corn finishing with a decent hop balance. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium bodied, moderately carbonated and somewhat lively on the palate. Drinkability is good. I am surprised at how drinkable this brew is. I would not mind having this again in the future."
"The aroma is malty and hoppy with a nicely done balance. There is also a corn like element to it. The appearance pale gold with a foamy head. The flavor like the aroma with a obvious corn presence. The palate is thin. Overall this is a good beer but not great."
"Drinkability: This doesn't make me want to try any other GB products, as this one is drinkable, but nothing I'd want to session or really try again. But still, it's average if not a bit better I think overall."
"M + D: Moderate carbonation, though body feels a little thin or slightly diluted. The alcohol notes become more apparent as it warms, and give it a touch of harshness. Not really my thing at the end of the day."
"Blonde bock/Mai bock is my favorite lager style and in the spring I look forward to trying new ones.This poured into a .5 liter stein a full rich golden (not blonde) with a fluffy very well defined white head thaat turned into a creamy mass after settling slowly.Aromas were not pleasant,like wet grain with some sort of spoiled corn element,just not good.The flavors didnt show many of the nasty attributes of the smell wich is good,big buttery, caramel sweetness with some sweet alcohol and and toasty grain in a lingering finish.If you take away the bad smell this is a pretty good blond bock,just needs some tweekin."
"The sharp boozy aspect takes some of the joy out of this beer. Give it a pass."
"Drinkability: That aftertaste brings the marks down here - too bad as the beer has a number of commendable elements"
"This beer turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Very tasty and very reasonably priced."
"I really don't know what they were trying to do here, but it's a misfire. This beer is so boozy it's going to be very hard to finish, even fridge-cold. Some styles don't lend themselves to huge ABV's, and this is one of them. This is Dopplebock levels with no malt to back it up. Seems like they used 3 parts corn sugar to one part malt. I can't believe I paid craft prices for Steel Reserve in disguise. Never again!"
"Overall, not one that I enjoyed. Made it thru but barely. I love most of the other Biersch's so gave this one a shot. I'll stick to their awesome Hefe and schwarzbier. Don't recommend unless you are a big bock fan. One and done."
"D) Eh. GB makes a fine beer, but this seems too far from the Bock model, an American Bock, and we already have a Texas Bock muddying the waters. Nothing great, nothing wrong here."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Up front coating dryness, strangely husky and astringent with some fruity apricot sweetness (barely) present beneath. Dry finish with more astringency. Pretty terrible stuff, I couldn't even finish 12 oz of it."
"Pours a bright, golden yellow with a slight, white fluffy head with some lacing on the glass. Couldn't really pick up much aroma, maybe a little caramel malt, a little grassy hops. The taste was more of the same, with a slightly sweet caramel note well balanced with the grassy hops. It's not going to blow you away with flavor, but it's a pretty drinkable brew."
"Poured a lifeless straw-yellow into a pint glass--lifeless, in that no head resulted. Granted the style may not be the paragon of flavor, but this one looked, smelled, and tasted like a bland macro. I got a a little corn, grain, and almost nothing more in the nose. I tasted some malt and bread in the body, but this beer was just dull with some subtle earthy, grainy sweetness. The beer was pretty full-bodied, and it was drinkable, sort of a like a less-carbonated macro. However, the taste definitely didn't make me want to drink it."
"D - At 7%, this is hardly a slamming beer, but it's smooth and pleasant, and before you know it, you had three or four."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer...especially for a beer that has the word ""bock"" written on the side if it is brewed in the USA. If I want to nit-pick, it is a bit hoppy, a little under-represented on the carbonation, and maybe the water could use a bit of adjusting...but that is seriously nit-picking. This is a pretty good beer overall, and I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again...especially over some of the ""Bocks"" available here in Texas."
"Pale styles of beer are less forgiving. This is not a good example of the style."
"Drinkability: A pretty good bock. More colorful than most I've tried, however the flavor isn't something that makes you crave more. Dry alcohol aftertaste is boring."
"D= Well balanced flavor profile and dangerously easy to drink. I really liked this beer and will definitely get back for more. I am glad my local G-B added this to their lineup this Fall!"
"The taste is also very nice, smooth, yet interesting, with bread crust, raisin, with a persistent, smooth alcoholic warmth, bite, and spiceiness. It has firm sweetness bit moves into a finish that has clean, bitter dry leaves and dry grass as well as raisiny spiciness."
"Very weak aroma with some hops. Very clear and pleasant looking beer though with a tough flavor but gentle on the palate. Not a very flavorful or tasy bock. The flavor was just a bit too harsh, which is odd becuase to the palate it is a beer that has a pleasant feel to the mouth."
"D: This beer would be perfect for hot days, as it's very light tasting and more thirst-quenching than I was expecting."
"Poured a deep golden yellow in color with a medium amout of foam and some lace on the side of the glass. The smell of hops and malts filled the nose. The taste was of a tart, bitter sweetness and not really that bad of a typical Blonde Bock. No really dissapointed, but just wish there was something a little extra to the flavor of this Blonde Bock."
" It's a clear yellow brew, looks a little like urine but with a white head that fades gradually. Nose is musty hops and slight sweetness. Taste is mild grassy hops, with European hop qualities. A bit lager-ish, even. Malt sweetness too. Mouthfeel and drinkability both not bad."
"Bottled on date of 10/3/07. Nice light gold color but very little head. Bottle says rich and I would find that an accurate description. Nice, understated malt aroma. Full, (really full) flavor taste. It is such a pleasure to have a such a nice LAGER. Clean mouthfeel. Great beer to have this time of year to break up all the heavy winter ales that I have drinking."
"D- A bit hoppy for me, but it is a 'hele' bock beer so... Very Pilsnery, which I'm generally not crazy about, but this adds a nice bit of sweet malt thus gets a higher score from this BA. If your stuck in a San Francisco airport you could do much, much worse."
"Pours a yellow-copper color with a full, foamy head that stuck around for a decent while. Sweet malty nose, you can smell the high gravity for sure. The taste is extremely malty and you can definitely feel the alcohol. I can drink these all of the time. Only thing I would change is a hint more on the hops side, but other than that it is a good brew."
"On tap at the GB brewpub in Honolulu Harbor. Crystal clear, bright gold. Slight head, no lace. Smelled of honey and floral hops. Slight apricot ester. Very appealing. Bright taste, starts with honey with a hop bite. Creamy mouthfeel with a kick. Along with the Dunkel, I think this is one of the best beers they make."
"Smooth malty mouthfeel that is scrubbed clean with the medium-high carbonation . Overall a decent brew, however it is a little dull/flat/one dimensional in the flavor department making it something I wouldn't spend an evening with."
"I agree with Ding, this is a very good, strong brew. A brilliantly clear straw color with sparkling carbonation (could have better head retention). Strong, sweet pilsner malt aromas have a honey-like sweetness with light earthy-grain flavors. Hops offset the sweetness, but contribute little in the way of flavor or aromas. Spicy from the Saaz and from highter than normal alcohols. A sweet alcohol and evaporative feel, both approach teeth-hurting and warming. Finishes sweet with a light hop bite. Even with a few inconsistencies, it has enough intrigue to win over some taste buds."
"Sampled from 12 oz. bottle, have had on tap before but this review is for the bottle. Pours amber-orange with decent head the hung around for a little while and left trace amounts of lace. Although new to the bock style I enjoyed the taste, strong malts but didnt notice the hops much, malt dominated the taste. Could also tell this was a higher alcohol brew. Medium-heavy mouthfeel due to the malt and low carbonation. Definitely a drinkable beer. From what I recall I enjoyed the tap version better of course."
"Drinkability- PRetty nice. Not outstanding, not to bad. Just about what you would expect from Gordon Biesch."
"A pretty nice easy drinking bock. Not overly interesting, but it's pleasant and well worth the reasonable price of $5.99 for a six pack."
"Pours a light hazy-ish amber with a nice foamy head, good carbonation. Smells of sweet malts, slight alcohols peeking through though. Taste is full of medium bodied creamy malts, slight sweetness. Nice and filling but still refreshing. Only weak point is the alcohols in the taste as in the nose."
"Over all, I would buy this in bottles to stock at my house."
"The carbonation is thinner than many other beers, but it comes out smooth and creamy. This is very easy to drink as a result. I would recommend this to people who like lagers as well as ales. It is certainly refreshing."
"D: Not very bock like. Pretty straight forward but not a big fan of any metallic aftertaste."
"The mouthfeel was good with medium body and good carbonation that was quite cleansing. Overall, very drinkable. I have this beer on a bunch of occasions and consider it a very nice offering for GB."
"Was it worth 6 bucks a six pack? yes, but not much more than that. However, it is a true rep. of the style but not top.(none of GB beers are but they usually hit the spot)"
"finishes just a tad too harsh. the bitterness from the hops imparts an earthy bitterness which interrupts the flavor and drinkability- too much for a blond bock. somewhat waxy after-palate. shame this beer falls short at the end.. it's solid otherwise."
"It's a nice dark blonde color with decent head. Not an amazing aroma, but malty. The flavor is sweet and smooth with malt and a satisfying hop finish. Nothing too complex or memorable, though. Mouthfeel is decent, smooth. This is pretty drinkable and refreshing for a 7.0% ABV beer, nice to have a couple at a BBQ."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a lighter side of medium body. Overall seems a bit thin for the style. An ok beer drink if nothing else is available."
"This is a very drinkable beer, but the sharpness in the flavor gets a bit tiresome. I probably would not have another."
"D - It's a drinkable beer. I probably wouldn't buy this one again however."
"Crisp and tart, the 7+ abv could hurt you, but for a couple this was a pleasurable offering."
"I haven't been terribly impressed by what Gordon Biersch has had to offer, but this was a surprise. The smell is of sweet malts just like traditional german bocks. The taste retains the same sweet malty taste but adds the light presense of bubbles. There is something about the full-mouth flavor that comes with this beer that really makes it enjoyable and different from many beers. Because of this the mouthfeel is pleasant and the drinkability is high."
"drinking six of these should be enjoyable for someone who drinks pale ales with lower alcohol. this one at 7 is very drinkable."
"Its nothing out of this world, but its a very crisp, refreshing beer. Also, with the 7% alcohol content, which you cannot taste until the beer really warms up, itd be an easy to drink, fun session beer to drink with friends."
"Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock isn't really my thing. Lovers of the style might find a good deal to like. However, having such little knowledge of the style, and even less interest, I can't even make that call with any degree of certainty."
"Good drinkability, difficult to identify the unbalance of this bottled beer (better on tap in Palo Alto), and the finish lingers a metallic grapefruit flavor."
"This is certainly drinkable, and I begrudingly recommend it :P"
"I had no clue it was 7% ABV as it is hidden and not detectable at all. A very nice brew and it worked very well on a hot day of brewing. Might have to pick this one up again."
"Thumbs up!"
"It wasn't golden in appearance like the label would indicate. No big deal just odd that its actually more tan than anything. Very heavy wheat taste. Taste's cheap. Carbonation just pummels the palate, overwhelming carbonation that sizzles even in the aftertaste. Medicinal type taste in the middle mixed with grain."
"Tasted: 05/07/05"
"Drinkability- Odd tasting beer. Maybe I snagged a bad one. May have to review this one another time. Although, this is the first ""blonde bock"" I have ever had. Oh well, live and learn."
"Clean golden color, with small amounts of carbonation floating lazily to the top. Small white head doesn't last long, but makes for an overall beautful beer while it's there. Aroma and taste of green apples and pears, but not enough to hide the formidable 7% abv. Light carmel and lemon finish. Not quite enough hops to balance the sugariness. Medium light bodied. An excellent lager for the price, very drinkable, one of my standards."
"Marked by a grainy, even ""juicy"" malt, this beautiful helles bock is a perfect example of the style! It's golden body has a light orangeish tint beneath it's short but very creamy bright-white head. The head retention is quite good given its 7% alcohol content, and it leaves walls of spotty lace about the glass. The nose is clean and fresh with lightly candy-sweet and grainy malt that beckons you to imbibe. A zesty, fine-bubbled carbonation cuts through some of its medium body, leaving it to appear a touch thinner than it is; and awakens the tastebuds before the beer slides smoothly away. Balance is what the flavor is all about, and it's sweetish dose of malt is balanced by a low-lying bitterness and snappy alcoholic bite. As it warms, the richness widens, but it never steps beyond it's bounds. It's not intended to be a complex beer - just a rich one, and it succeeds masterfully. It's masterfully brewed, and despite it's alcohol content, it remains highly drinkable!"
"The taste was very sweet almost too much for my taste. A strong carmel flavor with a hint of bitter in the end. Nothing more really stood out to me."
"Good crisp carbonation for the mouthfeel. Easy drinking beer, but I would prefer something a little more complex."
"Drinkability  This one is a little much to qualify as a session beer (which I think all Bocks should be able to do) but it was drinkable on a limited scale. I wouldnt want more than one round of it, but it wasnt bad."
"Pours a clear golden liquid with a good thick white head. The head disappeared way too quick for me. Very little lace on the glass. Typical pale malt smell, with a touch of earthyness. Malty up front. The malt had some degree of depth to it. Dry at the end, with very little bitterness. Light body, with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall, pretty easy to drink, but not really outstanding."
"And when you do, you may be slightly disappointed -- not because it's bad, but because it's so pretty, you expect it to be better. GBBB is more hoppy than malty, and leaves a very slight metallic aftertaste. And because of its high alcohol content (7.0%) you may not want more than one. Overall, I'd rate it Good, but nowhere close to Great."
"Not bad by any means, pours a solid orange/gold color. A semi white head is decent to the eye, lacing is average. The smell is of syrup and sweet sugar malts, slight hints of molasses. The tase is of apple/caramel and molasses, no real hop to balance out the sweetness, still not powerful, wich is good in a golden bock, still a bit rich."
"for me this was an almost non-existent beer."
"When I went to Biersch in Columbus, I was impressed beyond average with the beers that they'd had there, but this just isn't that great. I'd probably give it a try on draft, but the bottle isn't something that particular impresses me."
"This is a very sessionable beer despite it's 7% abv. The beer poured a clear golden color with a small white head that settled into a small rim of foam and left little lace. The smell was quite grainy and had a nice sweet maltiness to it. The flavor was pretty good with a good sturdy malt backbone, a medium bodied mouthfeel and a hint of spice in the background. A good offering from GB."
"Appearance: Amber blonde with a white fleeting head leaves thin sporadic spots of lace. Aroma: Rich maltiness semi-nutty with alcohol making a strong presence on the nose, a bit one dimensional with a touch of hops. Taste: Grainy offness in each sip high alcohol isn't hidden well at all, semi sweet graininess and off bitter grainy finish not that great. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied strong lager not my cup of tea I've had better German and American brewed versions. Drinkability: Lacks many characteristics to bring a high level of drinkability, getting one down is a job not well constructed a bit harsh with the grainy offness and overbearing alcohol."
"The smell is a little subdued but still hints at the potency at hand. I wasn't much of a fan of the flavor, however. It tastes cheap and overly grainy. It's pretty drinkable considering the contents, but it's not something I really enjoyed."
"A drinkable brew packs a punch too."
"This bock poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled. The smell was very light malt with some sweetness. The taste was lightly malty with minimal hop bitterness. There was a touch of caramel sweetness, a hint of butterscotch and phenols. The alcohol was well hidden. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation. The flavor lingered for a fleeting moment. This beer was OK, though a bit thin for such a high ABV bock."
"Overall, a decent beer that was pretty easy to drink. Nothing earth-shattering about it, but I've had worse in my time."
"Gold color with a nice head. Nothing striking about the aroma, maybe some floral scent not too much though. Taste, refreshing and clean, malty for a blonde but it IS a bock, confused yet? Nice finish with a lil leftover malt on the tongue. I'll definitely have this again."
"Overall: I don't know if this just isn't my type of beer, or it's just not good, be my guest and give it go."
"Above average drinkability an OK beer."
"Golden color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A light to medium bodied ""bock"" beer. Mildly hopped, medium malts. Light flavored beer with a nice malty flavor. Somewhat sweet. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is very malty with not a lot of bitterness."
"There is nothing special about this beer. It has a slightly malty flavor with a little bit of bite at the end. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it. Another mediocre beer from a brewpub chain that specializes in producing mediocre beers."
"Very light straw colored lager, sweet smell with wispy head. The taste is equally sweet, but lack of hop body or cripsness make it feel almost under-fermented. There was a nice creaminess about it though, and it sipped quite well. Did not stand out as a bock against the other lagers."
"Blonde in color with a dark tan, persistent head. Carbonation comes through on the mouth as an acidic tang. A nice sweetness comes through as do some nice grain. A very soft bitterness comes out in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-light. From the downtown Seattle pub."
"Knock this lil bugger down to a 5% and you got yourself a fan!"
"The real thing to ponder with this beer is the overwhelming smoothness of it in the face of 7% alcohol. The fact that this is a very drinkable beer makes it a dangerous bar stool beer."
"The first time Ive tried this beer in almost 3 years, I guess Im way over due. Limpid golden amber color on the pour, head is modest in size, frothy in consistency, tan in color and a nice lace formed to cover the glass. Malt dominated nose, light floral tones, and crisp sweet and quite pleasant to the senses with a malt sweet start and the top middling. Finnish has a perky acidity, big hop spicy bite, light but robust, dry and lingering aftertaste and real top notch bock that does the style proud."
"Had this in a pub in the Phoenix airport... a clear deep gold, with a thin white head. Had to strain my nostrils to get any aroma... just a touch of caramel malt. Flavor is very boring... a bit of caramel malt with just a hint of bitterness and some alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel was thin for a bock. Overall, a very, very boring beer."
"Had this at GB's Burbank location. It' golden with a sticky white head. Both the smell and taste are on the light side, but the alcohol somehow doesn't overwhelm it. Although the lack of a strong alcohol taste and smell makes it more drinkable, the overall experience is nothing special."
"On draught at Frog Bear Wild Boar, and coincidentally not available at the Gordon Bierch two doors down. Dark gold with an orange hue, medium thick off-white head and little lacing. Aroma is alternatingly fruity and malty. Flavor is kind of tangy, without much malt balance. Rather clean finish but I thought this was pretty average. Alcohol level was well hidden."
"Bottle on 12/21/02. Poured with little or no head and little noticable lacing. Amber in color. Aroma was indiscernable. A faint malty, biscity taste. A noticable alcohol finish. Generally, an average, undistinquishable maibock."
"Started well, but in teh end was a big let down, a touch light on flavor and aftertaste for me. One day I will try this on draft and compare notes."
"Draft in San Francisco......Slight orange to amber in color, tight white head, didn't last long. Lots of sweet and inviting malt smells, then the same off smelly stales of their other beers. No noticable hop presence. Despite that the flavor was still good. Smooth, medium body, didn't taste as off as it smelled. Nice with their overpriced garlic fries........."
