"Taste is creamy bread dough and grain, caramelised raisiny sweetness with herbal grassy bitterness to balance.  The feel is creamy yet lively.  It has a nice log finish with lingering aftertaste of all the elements married nicely."
"Overall:  not a bad beer; if the flavor were a bit more like the aroma, though, I think I'd like it a lot better."

""
"Overall: A fairly tidy, sufficient bock."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a cross between a strong Marzen and a typical Euro-bock. Alcohol is not at all hidden. Lingering bready aftertaste with less hops than expected given the ample hop load earlier on."
""
"but then again, not really a full flavored bock."

"Serving type: bottle"

"I like this beer. I wish I bought more than one!"
"Pale yellow with a fizzy, near-white froth. Grain, green grass, hint of lemon and orange to the nose. More flavorful than the aroma would lead you to believe with apple, sugar, grain, and cracker, followed by a subtle hop finish. Light to Medium and interesting for a moment, but mostly forgettable, which might be a testament to the par excellence in good beer these days than to the mediocrity of the beer itself."

"This is very nice. I like the more assertive graininess of the hops, and I love the aroma (easily the best smelling light bock I've had). A good backing of malt to counter it, too."
""
"Hacker-Pschorr did a nice job with Hubertus Bock. It's dry with great balance between sweet and bitter, the finish lingering bitter actually, and the drinkability is sky high. I would purchase this again and, if you like maibocks, recommend you do the same."
""
"Pours a clear light golden-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, fruit, and toffee aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, fruit, and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Swing-top. Pours a pale, bright gold. Very good clarity, which is super important to me. Small to medium white head. Fades rather quickly, leaving just a bit of lacing. Aroma has some rich pilsner malt sweetness, mild grassy hops and some mineral character. Little bit of apple cider. Pears, very light lemons, mild floral note. It's a clean bock with a bit more sweetness than appley sweetness than expected. The taste has more of the same sweet pilsner malt flavor with that sweet apple note. It finishes drier than I would have guessed based on the aroma. Simple sugar. Mild grass hops, again. Mild bitterness in the finish, which could stand to be a bit cleaner. Sweet and simple breadiness. Relatively low carbonation. Round mouthfeel, almost a bit much given the lack of complexity. Fun to see a one-off from Paulaner in the US, but it's still just a decent bock. I can't complain. I'd love to see more German specials around."

"Overall, a solidly executed maibock. It's nothing too out there, but it's good, and that's all it's trying to be."

"we so rarely get these seasonal and special german releases here in the states, especially in colorado, so its real nice to have something like this. even though the beer isnt supreme itself, the experience of drinking it always is from a brewery like this. the color is crystal clear bright golden. visible and aggressive carbonation amassing a sudsy bone white head that sticks around. the nose is sweet, odd for a long and cold fermented lager, but the grain sweetness remains. true in flavor too, oddly sweet for the style, but there arent enough blonde bocks around, so i appreciate this uncommon mix of pale grain and lager yeast, good and sturdy too. lots of body for the style, and well hidden but certainly detectable in buzz alcohol content. not as decisively german as the other stuff these guys make, less intense grains really, but a well made beer. doesnt get here quite as fresh as i wish it did, i think its probably insanely good over where its made, but here there is a slight staleness that hangs over it, lowering it to lower quality beer status. i can see through that though, and like this one a lot. glad i got to have it, and hope to have more of the limited german beers, its a category we just dont get enough of."

"A traditional German maibock can be hard to find,it's great to see this Hacker-Pschorr offering here in my area.Pours into a 1/2 liter stein a full rich golden with a full white crown that never really fully settles.Aromas are on the cleaner side with a bit of toasted pilsner malts and a bit of iron.Smooth as all get out...wow that goes down easy,a medium feel with light carbonation.Mildly sweet with a little honey and sweet dough on the palate,a drying light spiciness in the finish.A damn fine pale bock,not overly sweet and alcoholic and pretty balanced for the style."

"O -- This is a very nice example of a Maibock from one of the old masters. It's rich and flavorful without needing to yell at you that you're drinking beer."

"Pours a clear gold body with two finger head from constant carbonation. Aroma is a mix of good pils malt with touch of sweetness and breadiness and some dry, floral hops. A light, smooth body with a grainy, bready malt base that has some earthy, floral hops to it and bits of sweetness like caramel or honesy and there is a sharp, crisp finish. A simple but extremely enjoyable and refreshing beer."

"500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 8/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of honey, cracker, bread, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of honey, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Light amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Maibock style. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"overall; unique experience, flavors didn't blend too well though. wouldn't buy again."

"O) Solid Spring beer option... Likely better than most American offerings in the style, but that's really just a guess. Worth a try..."
"Overall, an decent bock, but nothing over the top. I feel like schells maifest competes with this at 1/4 of the price."
"Taste is pleasant, malty and smooth with a good dose of grassy noble hops, more than most other Hacker Pschorr brews. Light orange and biscuit notes. Feel is smooth and supple, medium bodied and very drinkable. Lingering grassy hop aftertaste. This is a great bock, only a hint of sweetness, and well balanced with understated hop bitterness. Recommended."
"Flavor is more of the same -- toasty bread, yeast, and caramel malts. A hint of hoppy citrus arrives just around the finish, making this a delightful and well-rounded brew. Superb and well worth finding."

"Overall: An excellent lager. The hop tones add an extra twist which really makes this a memorable brew. A beer you could drink all day long and not get tired of."

"Overall â€“ A rather tasty, quite easy drinking, malty and somewhat sweeter bock. A good one to try."

"Overall: the reality is , is that this beer is good but it is your tastier pilsener...that's not a bad thing it is something more for you're adventurous side."
"O - for 6.8% abv, this goes down really easily. I just wasn't crazy over it."

"What a treat to have on tap. Anxious to drink this again."
"Medium-light in body, the beer is full of pilsner malt weight but yet soft and sweet in texture as a light honey will do. The slight thinning and warmth of alcohol relaxes the taste and allows for a semi-sweet finish of absolute pilsner malt."
"Definitely different than any bock I've had before. The pilsner malt adds a crisp, dry finish, overcoming the typical malt sweetness found in the style. Yet the malt retains interesting complexity."
"Serving type: On tap, which is the only way to do this beer justice. Hard to find, but worth the effort. Has appeared at Roman's Pub in Milwaukee."
"A bready, malty bock with good flavour. A really solid Helles Bock."
"This is another beer I am so glad not to have reviewed years earlier. What I would have failed to appreciate then, and what many people fail to appreciate now, is that this may be simple lager, true, but it's clean and full-flavoured and brewed with the usual German standards of excellence - and that's about the highest standards in existence."
"On draught at Gambrinus. Absolutely transparent sparkling gold, with a billowing cloud of foam, leaving sticky lace. Very biscuity, grassy, a bit spicy like citrus zest, with an alcoholic and doughy malty profile. Sweet, but drying at the same time. Loads of biscuit malt and grassy/hay like hops bitterness with a sting of alcohol. Medium/full bodied, creamy, not an easy drinker, but an enjoyable one."
"D: An easy drinker."
"Pint at The King Edward. Pours a bright golden yellow with a sliver of white froth and spots of lacing on the lager glass. Lots of bubbly carbonation in the body. Smell is sweet and bready malts, huge treacle aroma, prunes, alcohol, white grape skin, yeast esters, fresh cereal grains, and barley. Taste is sweet, sugary, and bready malts, fruity middle imparts red grapes and plums, slight boozy sting precedes an estery and spicy hop finish with some grain husk on the cough. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, foamy and spicy carbonation, drying finish with a vanishing aftertaste. A flavourful, refreshing, and warming maibock, and an appropriate 'transition' beer as we weather the last few snowfalls and anxiously welcome the spring season. Thanks for getting this in Rich!"
"Malt heavy on the tongue, stewed peaches and honey, along with a surprising alcohol kick up front. Light bodied, actually fairly balanced and easy to drink, save for the slight booziness. Drying in the finish with a zesty hop kick that balances some of the initial sweetness. Helles bock tends to be one of my least favorite styles of German beer, but I found this fairly enjoyable - worth a try."
"Hacker-Pschorr Brauerei Munich, Germany --Maibock 6.80% ABV. 20 IBU's. Foamy lacy white head. Clear thin bright light yellow gold color. Bavarian Noble hop front. Sweet stanky thin textured Pale malt crisp rich German Fest body. Dry mild sweet mild hop end. (3.5 / 5.0) Sampled 5 oz. Taster @ Fremont Oktoberfest on 9/25/2010."
"D: Good and drinkable. Might appeal to a large variety of people. Though it's good enough, it's not a beer I'd seek out again."
"Good light brown color with good carbonation. Malty bock character with a malty aroma. In general a good beer but not my favorite."
"Beautiful carbonation one of the more drinkable beers out there"
"It's not a total loser Maibock, but it could use more grace and balance."

"Overall - A very average bock - much too sweet... just about worth a try once..."
