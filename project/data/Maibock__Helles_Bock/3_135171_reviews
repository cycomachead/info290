"Slightly hazy light-golden pour with very little foam. Aroma is strawberry to the max - like a desert cake. Flavors are dominated by sweet strawberry. Itâ€™s a little much. The real drawback is the finish which has a slightly throat-tightening feel."

"This is similar to Abita's Strawberry lager, but this one is richer, and slightly heavier on the palate. Abita always has reasonable bomber prices around $6 which allows people to try all of their specialty beer. This one is a must that you shouldn't pass up if you do happen to stumble upon this delicious treat!"

"A slight toasted biscuit character at first but mainly strawberries.  Clean, crisp finish.  Granted, I drank this out of season but I could see it having an appeal in the hotter months."
"All of the best qualities of Andygator meets all of the best qualities of Strawberry Harvest... An excellent beer!!!!"

"I enjoyed this... whatever it is... but my expectations were thoroughly confused. Not challenged, mind you, but actually confused. I like being challenged. But when I'm confused I just feel... confused."

"When mixing 50/50 on your own, it gives more of the blonde doppelbock flavors of grains and alcohol. This version is more strawberry flavored and I dont think it is as good. It definitely goes down super easy and I would classify this as a fruit beer before I would a doppel or mai bock. Im glad they bottled this and it is definitely buy it again, especially when it is not SHL season."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, the label says it's a Doppelbock, but BA has it has a Maibock and I find it to fit into that category nicely and even though a lot of that Maibock base is covered up by the strawberries and cream it still works since the flavors are so nice.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, very creamy, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I'll have no problem drinking a bottle to myself and I think this would make for a great late spring or summertime beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the strawberry cream aspect it was really nice and the star of the show.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the Maibock base wasn't a little more reconcilable, but in the end it wasn't that big of a deal.  I would buy this beer again, at $4.49 it's a great deal and I could see myself buying more than a few of these during the summer and I would recommend this to anyone interested in a strawberry cream flavored beer.  All in all I was happy with this beer and a little impressed, as I said early I don't have the highest expectations for this brewery, but this turned out to be one tasty beer that I enjoyed. It's now my favorite Abita beer and it's one of the better Strawberry beers I've had.  Good job guys this was one tasty beer, keep up the good work."

"O: This beer is pretty good if you like strawberries if someone one was to ask what style is it I'd say I don't know but it tastes like a strawberry shake.  I don't like Abita beers much but this is surprisingly tasty"

"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 2/18/2015. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lightly tart/juicy strawberry, cracker, bread, honey, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance of strawberry, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of lightly tart/juicy strawberry, wheat, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Moderate herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of strawberry, wheat, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome robustness and balance of strawberry, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Extremely clean flavors as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible fruited Helles bock! All around awesome balance and robustness of strawberry, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"An enjoyable stronger fruity lager!"

"Abita should call this Strawberry Haze or just replace the Purple Haze for this. Most ""strawberry"" tasting beer I've had that's not a lambic or sour. The taste isn't fake but actually tastes like real strawberry. I wish Abita would have came out with this earlier than September so I could have enjoyed it all summer and I'm surprised that the ABV is 8%. Abita has a winner in this beer but I had it very fresh so who knows what this would taste like if its been on the shelf for a few months."
"Overall, impressive mix of two worlds American brewed German style with American harvested Louisiana strawberries blends much better than I thought it was going to.  This will definitely be a crossover beer for someone in the Bud, Miller, Coors segment that thinks craft beer is too heavy and bitter."

"22 oz. bomber poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Nice golden lager with just the tiniest bit of haze (probably from the strawberry puree).  Lacing isn't huge, but it's long-lasting.  Nose is predominantly bready, followed by faint floral/noble hops and strawberry sweetness.  Taste is more of the same, although the sweetness is dominant and bready malt and floral hops take a backseat to the strawberries.  Mouthfeel is roughly the same as AndyGator (between medium and dry).  Fairly carbonated, but not overpoweringly so.  What's really remarkable is how well this beer hides the 8% ABV.  It's unbelievable how well it drinks for such a high gravity beer.  I hate to speak this highly of a fruit beer, but this is actually really good.  This is a case where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.  This is better than AndyGator or Strawberry Harvest, and combines the best of both.  I don't like most of Abita's offerings, but they really got this one right."

"Beautiful golden beer with clearity and a lacing head.  Sweet beer with subtle floral hop notes.  The main taste is strawberry cake and vanilla with a slight candy strawberry taste, starberry pancakes too.  The alcohol is really conceled and the body remains light."
