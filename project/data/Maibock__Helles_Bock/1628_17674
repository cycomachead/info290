A spicey pepper up front on the tongue with a warming caramel sweetness. Dry bready flavor with warm butter taste towards the end. There is a tiny bit of lemon in there too. Creamy medium body with a fluffy carbonatiion. The alcohol is present here and there, but doesn't take away from the overall quality of this fine brew. I love this style, and I love this beer.

Dry lightly roasted grains with a corn syrup sweetness and a slight yeasty twang at the end. Not as sweet as the nose might have indicated. Light body, medium mouthfeel, and moderate carbonation. Finish has some floral hoppy notes, a little grass and some corn syrup sweetness.

The brew also has a light caramel malt taste, honey, a bit bready, not much hops detected. The feel is moderate and sort of creamy for a lager, which is a bit odd but not bad. A very drinkable brew a bit on the sweeter and lighter end for a boch but a good transition from the winter brews to the summer brews. I expected a bit more of a bitter bite.","Gmann","May 09, 2007"

Aroma of sweet malt is overpowering and a bit surprising for a bock. Taste is sweeter then expected and missing some of the nutty malt quality that I was expecting. Body is quite full with some adequate carbonation. Definitely too sweet for the style and not the best from this usually fine brewery.","Phyl21ca","Apr 05, 2007"

This offering from Southampton is delicious even in during this snow storm in March.","Franchise","Feb 02, 2007"
4.3,7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is one hell of a beer! I enjoyed this thoroughly, wished I had a six pack and not just a bomber. Pours a hazy, orangy to copper color. Smells of honey, slight alcohol, and nice grains. Other fruits going on I cannot detect. Not a lot of lacing down the glass, but who cares. Hits you with some nice munich malts upfront, with a decent hoppy back. A balanced beer for sure, and competes with the best, and one of my favorite styles.","bigdeuce","Jan 20, 2007"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy amber/orange color with a small white head. It smells like pears, bread and a little nutty. It mostly tastes like grain/bread, but I can also taste some pears and hops too. The mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick. The drinkability is good, as the beer is very smooth and goes down easy. This is the first Southampton beer I've tried, and I think it's pretty decent. Not a bad choice at all, IMO.","bluejacket74","Jan 06, 2007"
3.81,-5.2,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"This brew pours an amber color with a spongy-looking slightly tan head (3cm) that quickly fizzles to a surface layer. Nothing special, but who says it has to be ""special"" to look at? Aroma is pretty typical of most lagers with maybe a bit more alcohol phenols along with the aroma of Welch's Grape Juice along with a sweet plum (interesting). Sipping reveals a slight grape-juice flavor right up front along with a hint of vanilla that I think lends itself from the alcohol presence. The swallow is taken over by a slight bitter, grainy hops flavor that balances this out a bit, but doesn't suit me as well as hoped due to the grain flavor. A medium body that lets go of some fizzy carbonation right of front much like ginger ale, but not much alcohol present, but a slightly drying finish (just not a finish like most basic lagers). Overall, I found this one a bit too sweet for my liking, but I wouldn't turn another bottle down. Solid showing from S-Hampton.","Fish113d","Dec 31, 2006"

Very easy on the palate and the alcohol is really well hidden for almost a 7% abv, though a warming of the face is present.

A very nice golden / orange / copper color with a mildly heavy consistancy, nice head retention, and evident lacing. The aromas are all malt with a slight earthy hop spiciness. Boldy fruity with peaches, apples, and appricots. A mild bread / yeast character follows up, promising creaminess and richness. The flavors distribute a pleasant blend of amber malts and subtle graininess. Sweet and balanced bittering. Heavier than normal body with follow-up bready richness. Lightly alcoholic and cooling refreshment. Very nice.","BEERchitect","0"

Bready malt flavor, a hint of caramel and nuttiness. Again, floral hop flavor, with a good balance of bitterness. Medium body, with just enough carbonation. Very full of flavor, and easy to drink.","Bierguy5","Aug 20, 2006"

3.71,-7.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22oz. bottle. My first Southampton and it did not disappoint. Poured a clear, light amber-orange color with a large light tan head. Aroma was primarily malt, and some sort of spice. Alcohol peeked through very slightly, and there were no hops around that I could smell. Taste was very well balanced, with sweet malt up front and a nice, mildly hopped finish. The alcohol that I picked up in the scent did not make an appearance in the taste. Medium in body, medium+ carbonation, and mildly drying. A very enjoyable beer, nice balance of malt and hops, and one I would like to have again.","","Aug 01, 2006"

4.65,15.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"22 oz bomber. Pours a solid golden color with a finger of head consisting of mostly large bubbles, that falls quickly to a full coat over top of the beer. A moderate stream of bubbles is working up the sides of my glass and helping to heep the film over top of the beer there for longer than it would otherwise. This beer is crystal clear. The first sniff brings nice light doughy bread along with more bold toasted bread notes. The aroma is very clean, with just a light kiss of underlying malty sweetness. There is very little from the hops coming through in the aroma to me. Sipping this brew, I find this one is all about the melanoidans. Toasted bread dominates. There is an underlying sweetness. It's not caramel, but a doughy sweetness. IT finishes just as it started, with toasted breadyness trailing off, with just the slightest hint of bittering from spicey noble hop on the finish. I think the hop flavor and bitterness, though very subtle, really pulls this one together nicely on the finish. None of the flavors linger strong, but they sit nicely as they fade. Mouthfeel is moderate, with a moderate carbonation. Its not heavy, but still substantial. This beer is really damn good. Of all the lager styles out there, I think that maibock is my top choice, and this particular one is really getting my attention. The flavors are very well put together, and I could probably sit and drink a couple of bombers of this in a sitting. Excellent beer.","kmpitz2","Jul 07, 2006"

The flavor is rich and malty, and it's remarkably well-balanced. There's a delicate caramel edge to the malt, as well as a very subtle toastiness. Floral hops flutter here and there; and a spritz of peppery spice from the otherwiise completely hidden alcohol helps to keep it from getting doughy.

I like Maibocks, but still don't know a lot about the style, so I'm not sure how this would rate against some of the German traditionals, but it's a nice summer brew for hot US climates.

3.47,-13.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This was the first Southampton brew that I was semi-disappointed with, and it still was pretty good. I just had heard a bunch of great things about this one and it didn't live up to my expectations. Again, it's not bad by any means, it just doesn't really stand out from the pack...","SixpointJMH","May 11, 2006"
3.63,-9.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Definitely very drinkable in the easy to quaff sense. Not a whole lot of big flavor to give it that ""Damn I want more"" kind of drinkability.","EStreet20","May 11, 2006"
3.91,-2.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"There's nothing here not to like. It's on point, malty and hoppy as expected, but the truth is, it's a bit thinner than I'd hoped. At the same time, it's especially drinkable because of its relatively light nature. It's certainly no disappointment, even if it doesn't really jump out. I'll finish this, and would have no issue with another.","Foxman","May 08, 2006"
4.36,8.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: perfect. Nothing else to say. This bottle was quaffed rather quickly for the style. Go out and get some, and I'm getting some more !","Gavage","May 03, 2006"
3.95,-1.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Beautiful, golden-copper color and very clear. Extremely small head with average retention. The aroma had a little fruit qualities in it, which didnt really seem to fit the beer (apple). Nice malty front, and just a touch of alcohol in the smell. The beer is a little spicy and drier than I expected. Very low hop presence, but theyre certainly there. Nice balance, and a medium-light body. In my opinion, the beer could have stood for a little more malt sweetness, especially given the style. Its quite drinkable, though, and I did thoroughly enjoy it.","Suds","May 03, 2006"
4.57,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a soft copper and topped with a thick head of small off-tan bubbles with ample divots. The head slowly settles, leaving a few strands of lacing. There are only a handful of carbonation streams present. The smell is lightly malted with some biscuit and crisp, crunchy fruit, and just a touch of alcohol. As it warms the smell undergoes a subtle change to include a distinct apple juice note. The taste is rich and lush with malt, slightly sweet with some fruitiness up front giving way to a nice gentle hop finish that is punctuated with a bit of sugar and a touch of alcohol. The flavors are well meshed. Gets even better as it warms above cellar temp. Medium body with a velvety mouthfeel that is smooth as silk. A wonderful beer and well worth trying.","hopsaplenty","Apr 24, 2006"
4.38,9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ahh, this fine brew is more than refreshing it is an experience. Niicely malted, this maibock pours a beautiful golden color out of the bottle. The head is nice but not long lasting, with a seemingly somewhat low carbonation. The smell is a malty sledge hammer to the nostrils, a very sweet come hither. The taste is pleasantly malty, with only the slightest hint of hops beneath. A very nice beer worth searching out and enjoying. I regret that I did not buy more. Buy some, before I buy them all up!","BadBadger","May 31, 2004"

4.11,2.2,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I expected a light grainy malt presence from the nose, but instead I get a strong roasted malt presence right off the bat, some sweetness up front too which finishes with a bit of grassy hops mixed with a sweet biscuity malt. After the brew leaves my mouth a rich toasted flavor remains encouraging me to take another sip. This is quite an impressive brew and I recommend grabbing some from the pub or anywhere you may see this well crafted beverage.","sulldaddy","May 25, 2004"
4.08,1.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Shared a growler of this seasonal with Greatpondbrewer, and I must say that Southampton has a winner. I'm not a lager drinker for sure, but this could almost convert me. It pours a dark amber, highlighted with reds and golds, and it has a frothy, bubbly cream-colored head; there was very little lacing as the head receded quickly. To the nose, it is sweet and clean, but not terribly distinctive. However, the taste is much better; I noted its sweetness to be sure, but there's some subtle smokiness in the undercarriage and after a while the peanut taste becomes more apparent. Also, I notice cloves, but not in a cloying way. The mouthfeel is thin, and there is virtually no carbonation. Give this a go; frankly, the taste alone is worth it.","longpondbeerman","Beers"
4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"64oz. growler from Half Time. Poured an amber bordering on golden color. Loose, off-white head on top that receded into bubbles and foam. Smell was slightly clovey and banana like with notes of juicy fruit flavors as well. Taste started off with more of those traditional bock characteristics of cloves and sweet autumn spices and banana esters, but half way through the taste it morphs to a more biscuity, toasty flavor and a slight hop bitterness. The taste and mouthfeel with less carbonation, lack the cleaness of a traditional lager beer, but make up for it with an increased complexity. This is the perfect beer to sip on a cooler spring night. Side by side comparison with the smutty Maibock and this one came out the big winner.","GreatPondBrewer","0"
