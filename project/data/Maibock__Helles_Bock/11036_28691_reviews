"Biscuity and bready with a slightly hoppy end.   Can taste the alcohol.  Is slightly above average for the style.  Would not pass this up, but would not rush out to get it."

"Overall: Good beer, will I seek it out again, probably not, unless I see it on sale somewhere or I am at a bar that is running a tap special."

"Overall, for a style I am not particularly fond of I enjoy this beer. It is not too sweet and the alcohol is well hidden. Nice job by Foothills."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, honey-gold coloring with a tall, frothy, foamy, white head and a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. Aromas of baked bread, cut grass, pepper, floral highlights, and subtle mossy notes. Very earthy aromas. Flavors are roasted and sweet forward, with notes of buttered toast, toasted grains, earthy characteristics, oregano, cut grass, and subtle notes of caramel sweetness. Smooth and light in mouth, with an aftertaste that is sweet and has grassy highlights. There is also a slight warmth building as you drink; don't take this brew lightly. The finish has a grassy and slightly hopped linger on an otherwise slick, smooth transition across the palate."

"Clearish copper-hued beer, with a small wispy white head. Aroma of toasted grains and corn sugar. Taste of biscuity malts, toasted grains, corn, lager yeast, light notes of fruity hops, some fusel alcohol. Light-medium body. Decent overall, but nothing really memorable."
"This batch is well done in my opinion."
"This is a rather disappointing beer. The alcohol overpowered the other flavors. The warmth diminished most of the flavor and mouthfeel. And there was a very odd, grainy character throughout that I felt was out of place. Still it's Foothills and I'll try everything from them I can."

"D: A solid, drinkable maibock."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Poured a golden yellow with a minimal off-white head. There was no apparent lacing evident. The aroma was comprised of malt, fruit, and bread. The flavor was of malt, bananas, buiscuit, citrus, and alcohol. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was not a bad brew. The flavor and aroma was of this one were quite complex and enjoyable. If you are a fan of this style of brew, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on it."
"Great beer, but not really aligned with the style due to the sweeter/maltier taste."
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. I had this on draft. This beer pours a clear orange with a white head. The aroma is of wheat and sweet malt. The flavor is predominantly caramel malt with a sweet finish. Pretty decent and a refreshing beer. I thought this was a nice maibock."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and bubbly, but not overly so. Classic Foothills. This beer is hot! Huge alcohol presence that masks most all flavors. I'm getting some faint grainy biscuits, and a slight bitter finish, but this is all booze. The 8% is not hidden well. There's a drying sweetness that coats the mouth at the end as well. This is different and not what I expected. With such high alcohol, this is one and done for me."
"Update, I won't order this again, as it warms the alcohol gets way to be way too much in a harsh way. Down this while its ice cold and call it a night."
"A good effort here from Foothills; I wasn't blown away, but it went very well with a burger."
"Golden pour with nice fluffy head, gives way to thin wispy lace. Pear, green apple and some bubble gum aromas blend with caramel and toffe malts. All the same flavors along with some clove, bannana, and some spicy ethanol. A kiss of honey like flavor lingers on the finish. Hops riding way back, are there just to keep the sweet malts from becomming cloying. Some light ethanol warming felt in the throat by mid glass, other wise the 8% is fairly well integrated here. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing. This is nice easy drinker. Proceed with caution. Well done."
"Pours a golden orange with a medium cream white head and light lacing. Lots of carbonation. Smell is rather light but not offensive. Grains, light tart fruits, hint of earthy hops. The grainy, lager type scent was most apparent. Taste expands on the subtleties I found in the nose. Good fruit flavors with light tartness. A bready dough flavor soaked in toffee and a touch of caramel. Earthy hops and grain with little dryness. Nice mouthfeel, very silky smooth and almost creamy. Clean and a little crisp finish. Overall a pretty good drinker. It's tasty, just doesn't quite compare to the Smutty version I had a couple weeks ago."
"It's good. It's drinkable. It's also a style I'm not familiar with and probably don't fully appreciate."
"After a disappointing sample at the World Beer Fest in April, I hoped to opportunity to try this at Flying Saucer would be a better experience, I was wrong. The beer was served with no head whatsoever. It could have been Iced Tea for all I knew. The aroma was rather weak but present some malts. The taste was just off from what I've come to expect from the style and the alcohol only makes it harder to drink. This one was a huge disappointment and is a far cry from what I expect out of Foothills."
"Now, most would agree that Rogue Dead Guy is the the reigning king of the Maibock style by virtue of sheer ubiquitousness. So the question is, is Gruffmeister better than Dead Guy? I'd have to do more tasting to be sure, but my first impression is: YES. And that's no small feat for an up-and-coming 3 year old brewery from North Carolina. Gruffmeister is a flavorful, rich beer and a superb example of the style which deserves a much wider following. Come to North Carolina and give it a try!"
"Had this on tap at the Melllow Mushroom in Asheville over the weekend, the seasonal foothills still on tap there for Spring. Poured a deep dark amber, very clear with lots of streaming carbonation from the bottom of the glass, but no head. Slight amount of lace. Smell was very bready and grain like, with a hint of a slight bitterness, but definatly bread like. The flavor followed suit as it was highly malted and full of grain like flavors. Not much hops to balance, but ever so slightly dry finish. Kinda thin in feel, not enough carbonation to give it that silky smooth feel. Overall this was a decent offering from foothills, and an average representation of the style. The alcohol is very, I mean very well hidden, I could swear this was a 4% beer, was shocked to see it at 8% before my review. Overall definatly give this one a try if you can."
"Drinkability: Superbly refreshing and very well-balanced; one of the best craft brew takes on a Maibock that I have tasted; really hits the style and avoids some of the phenolic elements that have disappointed me about other craft brewed Maibocks"
"Notes: This is a solid drinkable beer that really shouldn't be consumed in sessions! The only giveaway for me that Gruffmeister was 8% abv (before I saw the official name, that is...) was the slight hints of alchol in the nose. Way too drinkable for 8%! Not that this is a bad thing."
"Extremely drinkable for an 8% brew. Thick and creamy, yet crisp and wonderful. Just don't think too deeply about it and you'll be quite content. Immensely quaffable."
"This beer was a slightly golden amber color. Not much smell. The taste was like a lightly hopped light beer. A little watery in the mouthfeel. The drinkability was the only high point for this beer. It was fairly smooth. I would drink it again but not if there was other choices."
"Clean and crisp. Medium body. A nice beer. Maibock is a unique style that I really enjoy. This one is pretty good compared to others I have had but certainly not the best."
"Nice to drink a good Mai Bock because they are so hard to find,poured a deep bronze with a small but swell sustained white head.Big alcoholic aromas with a apple cider touch,tangy and fruity.This is a true Mai bock by all sences malty fruit steeped in alcohol,sweet but not overly so very smooth going down.A spring bock on the sweeter side but the alcohol warmth comes in handy in nights like tonight in downtown W-S enjoyable and true to form."
