The stuff is possible to drink, just not all that pleasant. The balance is poor and the overall execution is pretty bad. This seems to be a theme in Point beers.","homebrew311","May 07, 2010"

2.56,-26.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Deep honey golden body bright white head forms thick, fine speckled lacing forms as well. These bottles and labels are so generic looking but I had to try it. Nose has a nice biscuit malt sweetness with a touch of honey accents and herbal rolling grassy hops. Mineral water slightly metallic character is lingering as well. Flavor is a bit bland overall, it's a nice mass produced maibock slightly watery. Nice grainy sweetness rides through again biscuit malt and mild honey sweet edges, balance with a low profile herbal, grassy hop kick. Mouthfeel is killed by carbonation levels and cloying sweet sticky textures at times really making this brew hard to love or even like. A regional brew from Wisconsin, this beer probably goes well with cheese. All beer goes pretty good with cheese, they need to take an apprentice ship in PA to learn German styles a bit better if this is their Maibock. It's note horrbile but they could use some pointers.","WVbeergeek","Nov 24, 2009"

3.28,-6,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"On-tap at the Acadia Cafe. $4 for a pint. Appeared crystal clear amber with a short white head. Like most Point beers, this is good and clean, but not great. While it's quite drinkable, it's not a shining example of the style. The flavor with the sweet fruity (apples and cherries) malts are backed by a little whole-grain bread taste, but it's all very thin and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Meh, not really worth trying unless you normally find maibocks too thick.","tempest","Jun 10, 2009"

3.65,4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear, copper/amber color. 1 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, some hints of ginger, and some slight citrus aroma. Fits the style of a Maibock/Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Carbonation has a kick, which is noticeable when compared to the general sweetness. Tastes of a lot of sweet malt up front, yeast characteristics come through next, hop in the background, slight ginger is noticeable along with some bread flavor. Overall, a decent Maibock; not too watery, but not real heavy on body - an easy to drink beer. It's a little heavy on the sweetness for my taste, but the flavors are well blended.","Tone","Beers"

Certainly no shortage of flavor, but somehow just does not have that smooth, balanced touch that makes me want more than one.","twiggamortis420","Feb 20, 2009"

Color is brown, with hues of orange. Smells of wheat, hops and a bit of caramel. Tastes a bit fruity at first, with some more malts and some hops which are very reluctant to show themselves. Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied. This one's easy to drink, and fairly tasty. I could get to a few of these any time.","stephens101","Feb 14, 2009"
3.54,1.4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinks easy enough, not a bad stab at the style, much room for improvement. This would do in a pinch. Too bad the head retention & lacing weren't up to snuff","russpowell","Jan 07, 2009"

3.33,-4.6,3.5,3,3,4,4,"This brew is a distinct Miabock that makes me long for the days when point released thier bock year round. It is light, highly carbonated, straw colored and high is alc. It tatses a bit like sorgum, celery and malt. About what you would expect. It is a good attempt at a maibock...just not mai-scene.","kickapoodude","Dec 11, 2008"
3.36,-3.7,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Honey blonde with a slight, off white head that quickly settles into a thin collar of foam, decent looking lace. Very herbal smelling, somthing I can't put my finger on but not entirely unpleasant. Some roasty caramel aromas. Tastes a little thin for a maibock but good nonetheless, malty sweetness with a touch of hops to balance. Tastes kind of like an import. Medium watery mouthfeel with sharp carbonation. Worth checking out.","biggred1","Aug 02, 2008"

3.42,-2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"There is some interesting stuff happening in this beer. Some striking flavors that could have made this a real winner are tainted a little bit by traces of astringency. If anything it's an invitation for me to try a few more Maibock's to see if anyone else can capture the variety of flavors successfully. Its a bit heavy making it less than easy drinking. My take is that its worth a try, but don't plan on a session with it.","KBomb","Jun 30, 2008"
4.05,16,4,4,4.5,2.5,4,"Overall: A very solid Maibock, especially for the price. I really like the malt/hop balance, which is key for a Helles Bock.

3.53,1.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Stevens Point Einbock (One-bock) is a pleasant surprise. Along with Cascade Pale Ale, this is the best beer that I've had from one of Wisconsin's lesser known breweries. If you're a fan of the style, a six-pack might be in order.","BuckeyeNation","May 27, 2008"

3.38,-3.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Stevens Point has the start of what could be a very good Maibock. Yet they need to make it much bolder and improve the presentation.

3.38,-3.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"poured into a pint glass, a clear golden amber with a somewhat thin head but nice looking carbonation. Light aroma of sweet malt.

The smell is slightly malty sweet with a faint hop pressence. The taste is decently balanced with a slightly toasted maltiness countered by a non-distinct hop bitterness and finishes slightly grainy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Drinkability isn't too bad, but there really isn't anything special about this one.","gmfessen","Feb 29, 2008"
2.24,-35.8,2,3,2,2,2,"I had this after the 2008 Stevens Point Bock Run(3/1/08) instead of gatorade at the brewery. Nice amber color, smelled rather metallic. There was not much taste, and nothing like a bock typically tastes. Mostly metallic tasting but just really watered down and then a strong alcohol after taste which was very unpleasant.
