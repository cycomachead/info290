"Bang-on Maibock,though a little more boring than other maibocks out there"
"light orange with thin offwhite head, not much lacing. Noble hops dominate the nose. Light caramel with strong Hops bitterness. Decent carbonation. Bottle was skunked which is too bad as this is a decent beer."
""
"O: didn't get any pils malt character; would have liked a little more hop profile beyond the bit of bitterness at the finish;"
""
"O – Seems to come in a bit on the sweet side.  Excellent flavor, but a bit out of balance, to a fault."

"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Very clean in flavor as well with very low yeast ester presence. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice maibock style. All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Nice mouthfeel, but for me, a slower drinker. I have to say, overall, this is a nice drop of Mai Bock."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium to dark bronze amber with a healthy three finger ligth khaki head with great retention and pillowy lacing. Full aroma of bready and caramel malt, light grassy hops and  hint of skunk. Flavor follow aroma, rich caramel and bready malt with syrupy toffee and earthy, grassy hops. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess. A full bodied maibock with lots of good, sweet malt flavor and a good touch of hops in the finish. There are hints of skunkiness and a touch of oxidation; this green bottle may have been sitting around a while before sale, but still very tasty and satisfying. Looks and tastes good, I will watch for this again."

"MO -Has a thick creamy feel. Overall a nice beer that comes in a funky bottle."
""

"Overall: This beer was somewhat disappointing. First of all, this beer gave off a stale fruit aroma and flavor. It drinks somewhat harsh, with a unpleasant hoppy/bitter finish. Seeing that Maibocks are seasonal, the year-round hybrid missed the mark."
""
"Starting off sweeter, this light to medium-bodied beer has a light crispness but is quite creamy, and into the finish develops a light dryness to carry it through."
""
""
"Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock has a thin, off-white head, a clear, bubbly, old-gold appearance, and just a film of lacing left behind. The aroma is of sweet bread, but the smell is not strong. Taste is strong, however, and one gets sweet, syrupy malt, some alcohol, rich, medium-roasted bread crust, a hefty hop bitterness, and cloyingness, to an extent. Mouthfeel is medium and prickly, and Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock finishes semi-dry, sweet, rich, and relatively easy drinking. Overall, this is a delicious beer. RJT"

"Poured into a mug. Pours amber red with a small white head. Smells of sweet grain with a tad of earthy hops. Tastes of caramel and nice dark roasted grain. Beer is light/medium body carbonated correctly and goes down great. Overall an above average beer."
""
""
"Overall: A pleasant, deceptively strong German bock-style beer, that will entertain the palates of seasoned beer fans and hobbyists alike. Give it a go!"

""

""
""
"I was surprised of how much malty this beer was. Not my favorite style, but it is a respectful beer."
"This is a great beer one of the better maibocks. It pours a slight reddish golden with a small head that leaves a little lacing. It smells of wonderful roasted malts with hints of nuts. The taste is of roasted malts with a nice balance of bitterness from the hops to round out the taste. It goes down smooth although I like a bit more carbonation than this beer seems to have. A nice beer on a hot afternoon."

"O: Flavours are much clearer and crisper, as well as scents, than Dargunner’s (my first Maibock was Dargunner’s.) Really am privileged to find a beer that Martin Luther remarked about as the best beer in the world. Found this one in Nashville and it has been one of the first on my ‘to find in NA’ list. Here I am drinking it on one of the last days I have in NA before heading to China. First heard of this on ‘Two Guys on Beer’ a show I love but that’s no longer going."

"Hey, not what I was expecting. If you are ever, somehow, in the mood for a malt-weighty, honey-ish, caramel-busty German beer - this is your drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied with low amounts of carbonation, the result is a smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Closes semi-dryly, with slight lingering stickiness across the lips."
"Browned orange, filtered with a finger or so of white head. Mild retention and spotty lace. Nose has sweet malts, light cider and bruised apple notes. Taste has more malt, grainy breads, a little earthy and some prominent hop bitterness. More bruised apple type flavours. Medium body and a bit of bite to the carb. Just another maibock really, nothing to see here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a turbid dark orange with a 1/4 inch foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, toast, caramel, and some slight soy sauce aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and some alcohol on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors even though I think that this is a pretty old bottle."
""
"This beer is known as a beer to be drunk in spring! It's pale orange in colour, with a good off white head. There is a definite toffee malt aroma. You can surely get hints of spice, malt and honeyish tofee. It does have a hoppy finish, which I enjoyed. Loved it with fried fish and chips!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a light, easily drinkable beer with lots of malt flavours. I've got nothing against it but it doesn't do much for me either."
""
""
"Very traditional Maibock here. This beer is not meant to knock your socks off. It is an extremely tasty, easy-to-drink beer that welcomes the spring and makes you happy to be alive."
""
"O: This is a very solid Maibock. Big malty flavors and aromas and a decent amount of alcohol."
""
""
"o: I really enjoyed the malt flavor in this beer - this is definitely not a bland beer! While I thought this beer was enjoyable, there are a couple of items to bring it more into style. Increasing the bitterness by adding additional noble hops at the beginning of the boil would help in increasing the bitterness. Additionally, I would suggest increasing the carbonation as this beer had little carbonation and moderate to moderately-high carbonation is needed to fit in this style."

"D- This is similar to the Hofbrau Maibock. Deeper amber in quality with a higher toffeeish malt balance with minimal hop note. If i hadnt known this was a maibock, id have said it was a normal bock. As a strong malty lager its very good, grading to style perhaps not a classic maibock, nevertheless a very tasty bock!"
"O: A good beer. I probably won't buy it again because it simply isn't really my thing, but it is a good beer. Actually, I would probably buy Dead Guy over this brew. That beer has more hop flavor and simply more character than this. It was strongly recommended to me by the owner of the beer shop where I bought it, and I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't strongly recommend it."
"O-decent beer. Nothing real fancy or unique but has standard maibock characteristics."
"Overall, I think this is a very good maibock. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: Not a typical spring bock, a bit more spicy than the others in the style which makes a more a winterbeer. The alcohol is a bit too present though for my liking (like ethanol)"
"Body is a little thin and could use a little more carbonation. Still it's good and improves as it warms. Drinkability is also good, but would be better with just a little more carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is kind of fizzy at first and its a little thin. This is a very clean and refreshing beer that has some nice flavor going on."
"This one's an orange-red color with a tiny head, decent retention and lacing for style. Aroma is sweet bready malts. This one's big and malty, plenty of sweetness, a bit of breadiness, and just a touch of booziness and sharp hops. The mouthfeel is nice, it's on the heavier side of medium bodied with a spot-on carbonation. The drinkability is about average for the style. Overall, a slightly above average maibock. Not worth seeking out, but not a bad pick-up."
"Overall: Definitely the choice if you are looking for a little sustenance in your beer. Overall, a great flavored Maibock that I would recommend!"
"Must be because it's May but I can't get enough Maibocks right now so why not go with where the style started. Tastes like it smells only better. Sweet toffee malts, fresh bread, cereal, caramel, yeast, brown sugar, candied nuts, earthy hops adding just the right amount of bitterness to balance out the malt sweetness. Carbonation is dead on as well, spritzy and effervescent on the palate. Creamy in the middle and long in the finish. Can't get enough."
"An easier drinker, and full of flavor. If you like bocks, this is a good one."
"Yes, you can taste the alcohol with this beer, which is surprising since it's 6.5% ABV. But, I really think this alcohol character is part of the Maibock style, of which the Einbecker is among the best I've had in terms of flavor."
"Drinkability: Though it was pretty winter-like for April today (it felt more like November), Mai-Ur-Bock cheered me up and gave me a much needed taste of spring. Great stuff."
"This beer poured out a nice crystal clear yellow with a fluffy white head, definitely resembled a true German brew. I had to wait to finish pouring till the head settled a bit. The aroma is very grainy and full of earth or nature. The flavors were good when this was cold from the fridge but as it warmed up it just got nearly unbearable for me to drink. I don't know why but I just didn't like the taste of it after mid-bottle. Mouthfeel was good and all, just the taste really got the best of me."
"Pours a moderately-dark golden color with a long-lasting single-finger white head. A bit of spotty lacing as it does eventually fall. The nose brings some light, grainy malt plus a very faint amount of herbal hops. Some light breadiness in the background. The flavor is slightly bitter and grainy, with the finish bringing an off bitterness that is almost like it has been light struck. Thin with above-normal carbonation as well. Not terribly drinkable."
"Poured into a wide goblet. Deep copper color with little haze. The head is tight and white. There is a great earthy hop aroma up front. The other characteristics are a crisp bitter bite and nice balance of bready malt. The flavor is close to moist cake. The body is full, but refreshing. A good one for the style, but not a style like to drink everyday."
"Ur-bock, eh? As in the first one? Well, German brewing tradition has improved upon that/this first maibock. But the OG version still holds up. If you can get this non-skunked then it'll be even better."
"Iam a sucker for a well made helles bock,this traditional brewery's rendition was a bit lackluster in my opinion.Poured into a becker a rich lighter bronze shade with a well defined one finger white head,German malt aromas are a bit toasty with a tinge of iron,the caramel sweetness is hefty as well.Not alot of complexity on the palate,caramel sweetness with that iron/mineral note,a light herbal,dry hop presence in the finish.Easy to drink for the style but again not overly complex."
"It was so easy drinking, something you could do without thinking all that much"
"Drinkability - At 6.5% ABV this beer could sneak up on you in a hurry. I like this as well or better than most of the German beers I've tried. Not overpowered with hops and well balanced in all categories. I could drink a few of these for one evening no problem."
"D: This was probably too sweet, but I still liked it quite a bit (more than other maibocks, certainly). Pretty nice beer."
"Beer is medium in body and a little sweet. Finish is creamy and nice, the beer fills the palate out well with a balance of sweet and a little dryness at the back. It's pretty good. Einbecker makes a bunch of good beers."
"drinkability; the alcohol could be better hidden but still a nice drink for a session. Goes down quite smooth and crisp."
"This beer pours an attractive dark amber and has notes of tree bark and buckwheat honey in the smell. The head is thin. Honey, licorice, pine needles in the taste; very well balanced. Drinks exceptionally easy, can be a great session beer. Goes very well by itself, or with traditional German foods. A clear winner in its sort."
"D: A real good maibock in a style I'm not a huge fan of. Though the sugar does tend to catch up with me by the end, I still really enjoyed this German effort."
"D: A very refreshing Maibock."
"Overall a very good beer. I like the aromas... lots of pear and apple but still pretty clean. I was interested in this beer because it is fairly difficult to find in my area, so I purchased a 6 of it. It has great carbonation with a really good feel, however, mine had a slight rotten smell when first opening it. Luckily the rotten smell did not translate into a rotten taste. I drank this beer alone with no food and think that it would be great with simple flavors, anything too complex on the food side may spoil the simplicity of the beer. Definitely give it a try."
"Drinkability - I don't notice a whole lot of complexity in this beer, but the general taste is fairly pleasant. Maybe worth coming back to."
"D: This is a nice beer to sip outside on a spring day when you need a touch of alcohol to warm you up. The alcohol is noticeable in both the smell and taste but does not detract from the drinkability."
"A smooth and quite malty lager that hits the spot when you are in the mood for such things."
"D - Would love to session a few of these. A very refreshing beer with great flavors."
"Alittle disappointed, I have liked the other beers from these germans."
"A great little springtime brew that I will be more than happy to seek out in the future."
"D - This is another of many drinkable enjoyable anytime German beers. German beer is good...it's the law."
"One always looks forward to the spring season to enjoy a great maibock. Einbecker fills that desire with a great offering. Big malty and slightly higher ABV offering is sure to get one out of the winter season and ready for spring. Very enjoyable offering."
"A good well-done bock, nice with strong hard cheese."
"This is a nice maibock that isn't overly sweet"
"Fairly middle of the road mai bock, but I'm not that familiar with the style. Enough to chew on, anyway."
"D - the sweetness detracts a few points on the drinkability scale."
"Quite a good one, and a pleasure to find on tap."
"Taste is much like the nose, floral, hoppy and a little bit of a tomato bitterness. Body is light and lingers on the palate with a bitter aftertaste."
"The taste is a bit more thick, full bodied, and grassy hopped than I was expecting. The beer is fairly substantial, is loaded with sweet caramel malts, some ABV is present, grassy and slightly spiced hop, and a touch of drying presence in the finish. There is a slightly perfumed quality to this beer that detracts a bit. This is a decent maibock, very Germanic in style, with some flaws but quite characteristic nevertheless."
"a little less robust and less flavorful than some maibocks i've tried before. Overall not a bad beverage."
"Taste is overall similar to other great maibocks, strong toasty bread, toasted golden raisins, light sweetness with light spicy and faintly herbal bitterness . It is slightly oily."
"Its a good Maibock, one of the more subtle but drinkable German styles."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a darker golden color, not really like a bock. Heavy caramel malt flavor and rather hoppy. When I had it, it was a bit skunked, so it probably took away from what the fresh beer tastes like. Has a dry aftertaste. It is good if it is available..but not good enough to go out and search for it."
"D: Pretty good but sweetness actually gets tiring; also alcohol becomes increasingly evident throughout"
"Easy to drink, but drink it cold. As this one warms up the alcohol takes over and it doesn't taste as good."
"Drinkability: I'd love to sip glass after glass of this all night long."
"Creamy, on the lighter side..but not too light. Drinkable as well"
"My perfect pair for this beer would be cheeses with a little funk, like washed rind cheeses, such as Petit Munster, Livarot and Raclette from France, and Ardrahan from Ireland. This beer can handle it. For those faint of heart, try harder cheeses, such as Manchego, Idiazabal, Landaff, and Piave."
"Pours a honey golden orange color. Very sweet nose, grainy with some caramel and a certain mustiness about it. Sweet in flavor as well, no detectable bitterness to my tongue. Light/medium in body, could have used a bit more carbonation but still went down very easily. An interesting beer for sure, possibly sessionable for the true bock fan."
"Decent to look at, this beer was amber with a thin white head. On the nose, there's a rich, malty character with caramel sweetness and a mild hop character. Fairly clean, though there was a distracting metallic character. On the palate, there's sweet and malty flavors with a blend of honey and brown sugar. Not very complex. Light in body, with moderate carbonation and a decent finish with a mild hoppy bitterness. Definitely not among the better beers I've had of late."
"The German decoction mash creates the depth of the malts in this beer and its hops are top quality with great balance. Great ingredients and great techniques make great beers."
"D: Not very complex, but quite tasty. The alcohol gets a little too much after a while and considering the sweetness I wouldn't want to drink more than one bottle of this on any occasion. This style of beer isn't really my thing."
"33cl bottle. Pours clear amber with a nice off-white head that recedes to leave a lot of lacing. Smells of slightly sweet, grainy malt and some grassiness. A hint of caramel. Pleasant grain taste with a good amount of bittering hops. A bit on the sweet side. Medium-full body, especially considering the style. Really nice beer, all-around."
"Notes: Sweet and caramel flavored with some alcohol hints,a good beer."
"This is a very balanced and drinkable beer. Not too light, but not a heavy bock beer either. Definitely enjoyable during a nice warm day in May."
"Pours clear light gold with a tinge of orange under a lasting cream colored head. Aroma is light cereal grains with a little bit of tart lemoniness and grassy hops. Flavor is caramel and bread up front. Pretty sweet until the hops cut through with a light grassy bitterness. Clean, watery, mineral finish. Rather astringent. Creamy mouthfeel until the weak finish hits. Easy to get tired of this one."
"D -- Drinkability is good, but could be better, I imagine this brew is suffering from shelf-staleness. I'll see about finding a more fresh sample to update."
"Overall this is an eminently drinkable maibock. It is really too bad that I've yet to find any American craft brewers who stand up to the Germans on this underappreciated, yet very enjoyable style of beer. Recommended."
"D: I'm not a bock fan. But one bottle is ok, and the alcohol isn't as present as in many other bocks I've had."
"D - Less hoppy than a typical Maibock I think, but it holds it's own as a great spring beer. Fairly drinkable. Delicious."
"Overall this is a nice, malty beer, though it seems to be a tad on the sweet side. Worth a shot."
"The drink is medium-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation, and is pretty darn drinkable."
"I thought this beer was pretty good, but nothing amazing. Especially if it's the orginal Maibock. It's almost the same as their Pils aside from a deeper maltiness. I'm glad I was able to get a single of it because I would be pissed if I bought on of the $14.99 six packs."
"D: At 6.5% alcohol you could enjoy a few of these, which I did for this review. However, in my area a 6 pack sells for $14 which I feel is overpriced, especially for 11.2 oz bottles! I have tasted better and cheaper examples of this style."
"Another generous offering courtesy of ThirstyBird. Pours caramel in color with minimal head; essentially a cluster of bubbles formed in the corner of the glass. Clarity was somewhat hazy/cloudy. Nose was malty sweet, a sour character, as well as caramel and a bit of skunkiness. Taste was malty sweet and the caramel is much more pronounced - very consistent with the nose. Mouthfeel fell between light-and medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that tickles the middle of the tongue. Nice drinking brew. I haven't had too many Maiboks, but I found this brew quite flavorful, particularly for the abv - a nice seasonal."
"D: This is an easy drinking beer that I really enjoyed. A very nice example of the style."
"11.2 ounce green bottle. I bought it for $1.99. It's got a hazy orange appearance and a moderate off-white head. Smells sweet and malty as hell. It smells kind of like a chewy carmel candy. Maybe buttery, too. It's a pretty thick and chewy beer. Heavy. Sweet and bitter all at once. It's a nice contrast of flavors all in one beer. The heaviness and alcohol make this beer one that you'd limit consumption on. ""Two-then-switch"" rule applies to this beer. I like this style of beer and this is a good example of what the style ought to be. Damn good."
"light body but smooth, with spritzy carbonation."
"D= A very drinkable bock despite the high abv and the obvious presence of the alcohol in the taste and aroma."
"D - A beer that I enjoyed drinking, but it's a little challenging for me. I'm not sure if I too much like the idea of a suped-up helles, but overall everything works together. Fairly balanced flavor, especially considering the relative intensity of both the malt and hop profiles."
"Poured into a pils glass for a light gold body for a two-finger head that left lace sticking to the glass. A wet, grassy smell with hints of smoked veggie and some floral notes. Dryness and floral hops settle in with a citric hop taste yet there are also sweet malt notes like caramel and other sugariness that ride right along with it. This is a thinner, lighter bodied beer that still packs a good taste and the ABV is well hidden with a smooth backbite. A simple beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Pours a clear amber color with 1/2 to 1/3 inch head. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt with a hint of lager. Fits the style well enough. Not really crisp and a chewy feel. Tastes of malt up front. The lager background is readily apparent. Hops bitterness is only faintly noticeable, if at all. Overall, not real great, but not too bad. Worth a try."
"(rated May 17, 2007)"
"This beer poured a reddish brown with a single-finger head that didn't last very long. The smell is mostly sweet malt with some hops. The taste starts off with some toffee/caramel sweetness from the malt that is cut by some mild hops in the middle that gives away to a little bit of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thick with a fair amount of fine carbonation. This is a tasty brew, but it might sit a little heavy to have more than one of at a time."
"Medium bodied. Drinkability is not bad, but I doubt I would have another."
"drinkability - I have had 3 Mai-bocks that i gave good reviews to. This I wasn't too crazy about, it had to much hop bite and not enough malt tast i think. Though i know that is what makes it a ""Mai"" is the hops."
"Full flavored I'm in for one or two though the intense flavor would stop me there."
"D - This is a very good maibock. I had passed it up many times and now I regret it."
"Glad I discovered Maibocks"
"An okay Maibock, not the best I have tried. The alcohol comes through a bit, lowering the drinkability, but that's about par for the style."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured caramel colored with a decent head and nice laccing. Has a very malty, biscuity aroma to start which turns sweeter, almost candied smelling with some spice notes. Finishes bready. Tastes of sweet malt and crisp spices, bready, and with caramel and a nutty finish. The mouthfeel is spicy and crisp. Very nice on-tap. It is hard to pull of the bready richness and still keep everything so crisp. Well done."
"Goes down too quickly. Maibocks are the ale-drinker's lager. I mean, the flavor is unique, the texture is wonderful, most of the German ones are superbly brewed, it's just a nice break from the sweet and crazy ales many of us concentrate on. Probably not for everyone, though. Would be freaking amazing with brats (or Tofurkey's awesome vegan beer-brats, if you swing my way)."
"Tasty malt-driven beer."
"Pours a clear golden with hints of amber with a one-finger white head that dissipated to a ring fairly quickly leaving no lacing. Smell is mainly light sweet malts and grains, mainly wheat. The taste is a little better than the smell with sweet malts still playing the major role, but with a more interesting things going on behind it with some corn and some faint hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium and refreshing with good carbonation. This is definitely a drinkable brew if not the most complex of maibocks I've tasted."
"D: Not a bad Maibock, but the astringent chracter detracts from this brew somewhat. Still not a bad offering in this style."
"Overall, this was an interesting brew, and worth a try."
"D: A good drink, syrupy, sweet and fruity and all you can ask for per style."
"It is medium bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation for the style."
"12oz green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a translucent golden amber body with a quarter inch of short-lived off-white head. Caramel and biscuity malts shine in the aroma with continental hops in the background. Tastes sweet, with caramel malt playing a big role, chocolate notes, and just enough hops to balance the flavor. Just a tinge of alcohol warming is also present. Very tasty and pretty drinkable. I like it - a solid German lager."
"One of the first beers I got on my summer 2008 trip to Germany- was stored in my host family's cellar during a fairly hot day so drank it warm right off the bat. Smells of clean German hops surrounded by a Munich malt aroma. I don't find the alcohol taste so overwhelming but it does affect its drinkability in that it already has such a pronounced, sticky sweet malt presence and then you realize just how much alcohol you're ingesting as well. Overall a very smooth and almost sickenly sweet dessert beer. I enjoyed the 2 I had but I don't know if I could go much beyond that."
"M/D - Crisp, mild bitterness but lots of sweet but not sugary sweet. More of a steady sipper than a gulper."
"Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock pours a medium orange color with a white head from a five liter mini keg. The aroma is very malty. The flavor is a full on blast of malt, it's downright bready. A very intense beer, if malt is your thing, you should give this a try."
"Decent stuff, but nothing above and beyond..."
"Decent but nothing to write home about; definitely more understated than American Mai-Bocks, although the Ur- prefix indicates that this was the first of the style....maybe this is what a Mai-bock should taste like?"
"D - This is an excellent brew! It's not outrageously complex, but that sweet flavor and the thick honey mouthfeel are awesome. This would be an excellent session brew, and I also think that it might be a good beer to introduce to curious BMC drinkers."
"Pours a really nice medium amber light orange color with great clarity and a half inch of just off-white head. Aromas like an amped up lager with a big dose of alcohol. Slightly sweet, candy like, lightly toasted Munich malts, and a little noble hop note. On the palate, starts quite grainy with a dextrinous feel without being sweet, singular malt profile finishing bitter and semi-dry. Hop flavor is low but the bitterness certainly lingers along with a warming sensation. Alcohol is quite noticeable and keeps things really ramped up."
"Drinkability: If you enjoy a malty brew you could drink this all day."
"I sampled this beer out of a 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Poured a dark golden-brown color. Smell is of malt. Did I mention malt? Has some spicy hop undertones. Wow the flavor is great. Definately the sweet malt you expect from the nose with a slight maple flavor. Maybe even some butterscotch notes. Nice bitter hop finish. This is a great tasting bock. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and chewy, very good. I traditionally like extremely hopped IPAs but this malt monster is very good and i will definately drink many more in the future."
"D: An easy drinker... big on the palate, but a reasonably low enough ABV to keep things from getting hairy. Another fine addition to a list of brews to get again."
"Although I'm sure this is a bit past its peak flavor potential, especially considering the rather high average score, I still enjoyed it and will get it again. It was great to have a solid lager after weeks of Christmas ales!"
"This is my first go-round with a beer of this sytle, and it certainly won't be my last; a very enjoyable brew!"
"Drinkability: Enjoyable enough"
"Definitely a high quality beer. Well worth trying."
"This beer has a golden-amber color. The clarity is clear. It has a malty aroma with no hop notes and light caramel scent. The flavor is caramel notes in the front, malty. It has a body that is between medium and full. The head was moderate, but dissipated. This is a nice, drinkable, sweet, but not cloy beer. My favorite Maibock!"
"Pours a lovely, copper honey color with a thin ecru head and constant upward bubbles. Smells of honeyed malts, with a light orange blossom fruitiness and a fishy sulphur note. On the palate, appropriately light in flavor. A flash of balancing hop bitterness hits the tongue first, but it is quickly overtaken by the malts, which somehow maintain the balancing act of tasting sweet and feeling dry at the same time. Rich and delectable, but still light on the palate for a bock, this is one of the better Maibocks that I have had. Excellent."
"Pours out an orange marmalade with almost violently active bubbles at first, but it eventually mellows. Head is thinnish. Spots of lace. Lots of spicy, grassy, and herbal hops in the nose with a fine malty backbone. Very sweet and honeyish aromas. Flavor starts off wonderfully bready with dried and fresh fruits abounding along with some almonds. Not overly sweet and actually starts to dry up a tad in the end. Herbal and floral hops come in at the finish, but the rough bitterness seems a tad out of place. Mouthfeel is solid all around: nice round body and some punchy carbonation. This is definitely one maibock to try."
"drinkability is decent. fans of moderately hoppy brews will take a liking to this one. the citrusy notes lend to a hefeweizen-type taste, but overall, this is defnitely a maibock."
"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a shaker. This bock poured a super clear golden amber color with a big pillowy off-white head that slowly faded. The aroma of this beer was sweet and malty with a touch of lemony citrus. The flavor was of darker caramel along with some citrus and grass. Also a hint of yeasty bread in there. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly carbonated. Very good balance of flavors. A nice one."
"Amber in color with a thick white head. Bready malt aroma with a floral hoppiness to it. The mouthfeel is medium in body. This is a malty maibock. The hops provide a nice bitterness to the malt sweetness. Decent balance. The flavor seems to become more bitter as it warms. The 6.5% alcohol is unnoticeable at first, but becomes more apparent as the beer warms. I would recommend drinking this on the cooler side temperature-wise, as it went down pretty smooth at first, but the beer's bitterness seemed to become a little less inviting as it warmed to room temperatures."
"This brew pours a clear golden-orange color. The head is massive, billowy and white. Lacing is thorough, and sticks to the side of the glass. The aroma is of grass, caramel, and spearmint. The taste is like the aroma, but with more grassy notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of the better maibocks I have had. I would certainly buy this again."
"My first expectations with this beer was very low, but then I heard a lot of praise for it and had to try it. The aroma wasn't that interesting, but the taste is really extraordinary and has qualities one would expect from a beer with much more alcohol. According to style guides the bitterness seems a bit high, but hey, others claim this is the original bock."
"I just had this on tap at Orlando Brewing. I am astounded at how GREAT this beer is on tap! I've had it in the (skunky-green-bottle) in the past and thought it sucked. However, this on-tap beer is a completely different animal! This beer rocks! Why does Germany hate the USA so much that it sends us so many crappy green/skunked bottled beers? Thankfully, Germany must not hate us ""all that much"" since the US also gets some excellent German brew on tap! Seek this stuff out on tap...you won't be sorry!"
"Aftertaste is dry and bitter, finishing with a earthy and herbal hop touch. Mouthfeel is velvet smooth, the small gasbubbles feel really nice on the tongue."
"Very sweet malty presence in the flavor, a step up from most bocks but not up to a doppelbock power. Diacetyl and German hops round out the flavor. Sweet finish, bready and chewy, also notes of lighter grain as well. 6.5% is fairly evident, as usual with the bock style, just a full-bodied brew. Enjoyable bock, recommended for fans of German styles."
"pours a crystal clear light amber with a nice head and lacing. subtle aromas of caramel, biscuits, and toffee with some light floral/vegetal notes. taste is definitely towards the sweet and malty end of the spectrum. starts sweet, then some crispness from the european hops in the background and the lively carbonation mix in with the sweetness without taking it out. mouthfeel is light/medium despite the relatively high abv. very clean flavors as to be expected from this style. the sweetness could become cloying after a while, along with the slightly higher abv this makes the drinkability suffer a bit in my book."
"Poured vigorously into an imperial pint glass this beer begins as a half-head, half-beer mixture up to the top. The aroma instantly pours out as a skunky hopped and slightly malty beer. The head take quite a while to settle and leaves rocky, foamy lacing around the top. The beer is a reddish gold color with medium foam. The taste is surprisingly malty and well balanced. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and rich. This is like a bock with some extra hops. After reading the definition of a maibock, I guess it fits the style. cool."
"This wouldn't be a session beer for me."
"D: The first of several bocks served at the tasting I attended, this maibock from Einbecker was crisp, clean and satisfying. Easy to drink, the epitome of springtime. Recommended."
"Very nice appearance and head--typical of German beers. Transparent and fairly light color for a bock. Smell is wonderful, all noble hops. Taste is lovely....sharp crisp hops with a very solid balanced malt backbone. Leaves a nice clean hop aftertaste. All in all a great beer. Makes me long for good ol' Germany."
"This was a nice surprise. I'm glad I gave it shot."
"Opinion: As I started to mention in the flavor assessment, the water seems to be better suited to this and the Dunkel Ur Bock. The Pilsner comes across a bit harsh where this one is balanced and a bit hard to pin down as it should be. I think that this is a fine example of a MaiBock, and it is one that I will surely drink again as the opportunity presents itself."
"A big, flavorful mai-bock. Just smooth enough to be drinkable while tasty."
"A tasty Maibock even now, in December...although this 65 degree weather seems very appropriate and makes it easy to enjoy."
"D: Tasty, easy drinking, not filling, good representation of style, this beer is good enough to pound down, but seems more like a beer to have with a meal."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"The finish was a little off-dry. Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"Had this one at My Place in Newtown, CT. Once again, Mark gets the real deal on draught. The best Maubock I have ever tasted. Appearance was a nice deep cooper color. The aroma was all about the malt. Taste, bread-like, close to a doppelbock, but a little bit more balanced. Mouthfeel was very smooth with pretty low carbonation. ABV is well concealed, so you can down a bunch, but be careful. A world class offering from Einbecker."
"Very drinkable with a good firm aftertaste, I will always buy some if I see it on my travels, I recommend that you do the same."
"Once again, what is up with these damn green bottles; it really shows a brewer who lacks a fundamental respect for their beer. If it were not for the skunked hops this would be an incredibly nice Bock. It is still quite good though."
"A smooth, delicious brew from start to finish. A classic of the style."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a beautiful clear, light amber with orange tones. Decent size, off-white head. Smell was mainly malt - caramel and molasses. Some hops of the citrus variety came through rather faintly. The taste was sweet at the start, but less so than the aroma would lead you to expect. As you hold the beer, you get alcohol/phenol/medicine taste in the middle. Sprinkled throughout are notes of toast, not quite burnt. The finish brings the hops (gently) and a slight pepper taste. Body was medium, as was the carbonation. The finish was drying, almost to the point of being astringent and there was some alcohol warming going on. Overall, a very interesting beer, but not really to my taste. The alcohol/medicinal flavor really did nothing for the total experience."
"I loved the vibrant bronze color of the pour. The head looked a little like a buzzcut, short and to the point. Nose is sugary caramel toffee. Taste is almost identical but sadly the hops do not come out to play at all. Mouth is rich and creamy, putting a smile on my face. I'm in no hurry to drink this again though. Too many other beers call my name in this too short life."
"Pours a bubbly and crisp looking amber almost light brown. But clear. Coonstant bubbling and a constant foam. The smell was of like sweet and toasty malt with a hint of Spring grass and dew. Flavor has a light hint of brown sugar sweetness mixed with some yams believe it or not. Then of course a clear barley grain texture."
"If you like malty bocks with good ABVs, then this beer is for you."
"First thought: Green bottle? and for a helles? Well, my fears seemed confirmed from a skunky smell. A good head, otherwise average appearance. Luckily, the rest of this beer is well above average. An extremely aggressive taste. Slightly overwhelming. Dry but pronounced. A crazy malt backbone. Abrupt malt aggression - but still, even for a helles bock there is a certain softness. Sounds contradicting, I know, but a fantastic blend. Also, an underlying bitterness and great maltyness that sticks with you in a very pleasant fashion."
"Poured a crystal clear deep golden color with moderate white head that slowly fell to a thin coating. Smell is very light with a slight wsweet maltiness present. Taste is firmly maltly with an alcohol presence also noted. Taste rapidly rapidly dissapears leaving only a vague alcohol taste. Maybe a bit of dryness at the finish. Average at bea=st. there are much better examples to be found."
"A nice malty aroma that gives a small whiff of alcohol. There are also notes of a Czech pilsner with some spicy hop notes detected there also. Pours a beautiful light copper color that gives orange hues when held to the light. A small head forms but dissipates quickly leaving little to no lace. A good dose of hops bitterness hits the palate first then gives way to the malt towards the finish. A good froth in the mouth brings the true Bock to the forefront and the malty backbone is much more present. Surprisingly, I got a taste of tea or tannins that fit nicely with the malty sweetness. Almost a tamer version of Urbock 23 and a touch more drinkable."
"Poured a translucent, copper color with a strong, white colored head. The surface was covered in bubbles and a touch of lacing was left behind in my glass. Aroams of malt, dried fruit, and alcohol. The taste was a cross between malt liquor and a doppelbock with grain/bread unertones. Too sweet and unbalanced to really enjoy again and again. Nice texture with the heavy carbonation, but less than average drinkability."
"An enjoyable beer but some slightly off flavors. Balance suffers a little from the grainy finish but the big innitial malt palate is nice."
"Prost! MK"
"Almost heavy. Malty. Exactly like a maibock should be like (on the other hand, this is THE maibock)!"
"CRUX: EINBECKER MAI-UR-BOCK: GOOD SHIT BY ANY STANDARD, this really is a good beer, and I can't believe I haven't had it before now; the stubby bottle belies and comports a sophisticated brew, and one I shall return to when the mood strikes. The craft and skill that went into creating this brew is obvious. Recommended."
"You cannot complain with this one. Last reviewer said it's a little skunky outta the bottle. That is accurate and is in no way reflective of the way this nice Maibock tastes. Very hoppy on the backend, nice and malty on the front. Nice fruity esthers with the only actual German Maibock I've had that is better, being Hofbrau's."
"Drinkability- Not sure this style is for me, but it wasn't bad. Need to try more to appreciate this style I guess."
"Thanks to RedBaron for the sample."
"The body is medium with a nice crisp carbonation. It may be 6.5% but it still seems to pack a bit of a punch. Still quite drinkable. I'm looking forward to more maibocks coming out this spring."
"Props to MABZ for including 4 of these with a couple of Gose in a trade for two of Avery's The Beast Grand Cru. Sorry The Beast killed your tongue!"
"I found this gritty enough to work for a high malt brew, and would not hesitate to buy again and again when available."
" Medium bodied, carbonation was active."
"Small 11oz green bottle. Pours an orange/straw color with big fluffy head. Lots of malt and some moderate noble hop aroma. Full body mouthfeel is dry with a bit of a sour and alchoholic finish. Taste is malty and rich but the very dry mouthfeel has a kind of metallic aftertaste. This beer wanted to taste really good but for some reason it was off. Maybe it was past its prime or due to the green bottle was a bit light struck. A very nice bock but I have a feeling it could be better. Definately will give this one another try."
"overall, this is a good beer, i guess i expected something a bit more spectacular but it is certainly nothing to pass up if you get the chance to try it."
"My first Maibock. Ah...the memories. So, so smooth. Deep, rich bronze color with apleasant texture that just lingers on the tounge. You know...even for traveling half way around the world and being out of season (it was mid winter), this may quite possibly be the best bottled beer I've ever had. And it's the original! From the last of the great Einbecker breweries."
"Likely the best Mailbock I've had. Poured out to a medium orange color with a full white foamy head. No lacing noted. Medium level of carbonation. Initial aroma is very skunky, but a second sniff brings forth the real smells; fresh grass and mild malt mixed with a ghost hoppiness. Taste is a welcome suprise from what I was expecting after the smell; lots of sweet malt, some grain and hops, with an overall fresh cut grass character. Nice. Mouthfeel was smooth and almost slick. Good drinkability. This would be even better on tap I bet (or at least in a bottle that isn't green). Recommended."
"Serves a dark golden color with a big pillowy head that lasts. This beer is big and malty like a bock should be. Very clean, with a slight toastiness to offset the sweetness from the malt. Just enough hop to offset the sweetness as well. It's so smooth you may not notice the considerable alcoholic strength at first, but after a few youll have no problem recognizing it A very good beer, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: What should be really malty and sweet is more bitter and perfumey, even medicine-like. Not going to wake up and crave this beer."
"Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock is decent. If you like this style, though, I suggest you seek someone else's opinion of its worthiness. Someone who enjoys and appreciates maibocks/helles bocks more than I do. Just about anyone will do."
"I wasn't particularly impressed with this one, but I'm still learning as far as the subtle german beers go. Not sure how old this one was. I think it was from this May. Poured a dark amber, transparent, not too much carbonation. Difficult initially to get a head, but quickly errupted in a half-creamy, half-rocky one. Smell was mostly strong grassy hops. Just a hint of caramel. Very sweet taste, a bit of honey, but a great deal of refreshing hop bite. Smell faded for me quickly. Not too complex, just sweet and refreshing, a little caramel or toffee. Medium-weak mouthfeel. Quite drinkable. Hard to compare to others, so a bit hard to review for the style!"
"A truely awesome brew we have here. I poured it in an oversized thin red wine glass which emphasized its hazy figure and copper hue. Delicious in every regard; some think caramel and some think honey, but I'd say a combination of both to achieve a supremely balanced malty sweetness. I expected more of that signature German skunk quality, which I've grown to like in a way, but this had very little. Very drinkable and very simply good. I'll be getting more of this."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"This beer is a nice amber/orange with a thick fluffy head that reduces to a thin ring after a few sips. Smells like caramel and freshly milled malted barley with a touch of orange and fig. The taste is quite extraordinary -- sweet grains leap out at you, coated with caramel, and rolled in candied pecans. A slight bubbl-gum fruitiness greets you in the middle, and the finish is bitter, drying, and somewhat chalky enough to keep this from being cloying. Some spicy Saaz or other German varietal comes back in the burps. Mouthfeel is as smooth as can be, and drinkability is excellent. There are a couple of other Maibocks I like better because they have a bit more bitterness, but this is a fine, fine example."
"Taste is rich caramel malt. very malty and lightly fruity. Nice hoppy bite for balance in the finish. Mouth is lightly sticky but really refreshing at the same time. Oh so tasty. A pleasant surprise."
"A medium-bodied brew that I found very drinkable, and I highly recommend this rare style to anyone who comes across it."
"Pleasant, and might order another, although with the large tap selection I moved along."
"A nice beer in a neat little bottle that reminds me of a brew kettle. The beer pours a clear golden copper with a persistent white head. The aroma starts out with minerals up front then fades away with bready malt hinting at nutty Munich malt, and a little fruity yeast in the background. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is clean malt bready to caramel to nutty then a lingering sweet finish. The beer has a nice body, and a surprising amount of carbonation which isn't too intrusive. Overall this was a great Maibock, and one I'll look for in stores."
"A very balanced example of this style compared to others I have sampled that are too alcoholic or have nothing to balance out the malt."
"All in all, a good introduction to the style. Recommended."
"330 ml bottles, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet, bestillingsutvalget). I drank the first bottle at cellar temperature, the second one at fridge temp. Extremely powerful mouthfeel in both cases, youd think the beer was much stronger than its 6.5% ABV (in a blind test Id probably say 10-11%). This means that the alcohol dominates, but the malts and hops are evident too. Colour is deep golden / amber, large white head. Moderate aroma of spices, caramel, molasses and hops, some oak and leather too. Moderately sweet with a dry and bitter hoppy finish. I preferred the Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel to this one."
"The color is honey amber with a very good head. The aroma is straight-foward, all inviting caramel malts. The primary taste here is caramel malt which is backed up with a hop bite and herbal flavors. Herbal taste is most pronounced in the finish. Drinkability is high, this is very tasty and almost addictive. Sadly, this is the only true German maibock I've seen in the US. I would really like to try a bunch of different beers in this style for comparison."
"I was excited to try this brew and it did not let me down. Its real strength is the smell, though its taste was wonderful as well."
"Crystal clear bronze color, visible carbonation streams. Grassy malts in the nose, earthy and lightly hopped. Taste is full and thick with grassy malt and alcohol with a sharp shot of hops on the backside. Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonated only as well as it neeeds to be. I like this beer, a good Maibock, with a european flavor that I haven't seen from a maibock before."
"This is my kind of session beer. Malty & clean - unintrusive and friendly. This could easily be my trusty companion while slaving over the charcoal Weber this spring. Would love to have this along side of a German sausage platter- -yum!"
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a fruity, dry yeast aroma. It is sweet and creamy. The taste is good. It has a strong malty flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and bisquit malts. It has a sweet, yet breadlike taste goes down easy and finishes earthy and dry with a slight skunkiness. This is an odd taste, but I like the idea. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation and a bit of warmth. This is a solid beer. It has real malt character and a style all it's own; a good drinker."
"Very clear gold to amber colored beer with a thin white head that settled quickly in the beer. The aroma has a strong crisp hop character (Hallertau?) with a backbone of malt. The malt lends a toffee character to the nose. Very crisp taste caught on the tip of the tongue. Definitely lager style hops lend this to the flavor. A richness and a delicate sweetness follows. This is certainly a crisp Maibock. Nice lace left down the glass as I sip the beer. Very good balance of crisp lager character and bock sweetness. As you would expect, a very taught mouth feel. Good drinkability."
"A decent though not exceptional brew any time,smooth medium mouthfeel, and a bitter aftertaste with a crisp tingling tongue. Golden yellow and a white tan lace and initially very creamy pour. A warm weather ale, and with 11 degrees on January 1st, that was fine."
"I loved this beer, and will try and keep a few on hand whenever I can."
"Drinkability  This is a big but simple hearty bock."
"Its almond beer ! I have had beer that tastes like (but was not made with) blueberries (Old Foghorn on Tap), oranges (Thomas Hardy), grapefruit (any one of a number of Sierras), etc. but this is my first almond surprise. It meets my mark of welcome surprise: you keep on drinking it to continually retest your hypothesis."
"Hmm, I think lucky me was able to sip this one fresh off the boat (it sure tasted that way). I had three of these, and looking at the abv, yeah that's about right. Had this one at 'bones last evening, and it was yummy (heard we weren't supposed to use that adjective, so get ready to see it a lot from now on). The color was Munich amber (go look, see what that could be), topped with a frothy tan head (nice pour!). I even had rings of lace left through-out my glass. The light, brown bready aroma was pleasant. Tingly carbonation was the initial impression, and the malt was slightly sweet, which was nicely kept in check by the crispness of the carbonation. No real bitterness to speak of, but again: no syrupy notes detected either. Spot on, and a bit dangerous for me having three. Very very good."
"The beer is a pretty pale orange-golden color and has a nice, lush off-white head that sends a thin sheet of belgian lace around the glass as it falls. The head is very rocky as well, a good sign. The aroma is a nice solid malt, almost candy like, with a faint hint of hops. This one has a touch of skunkiness - its in a green bottle, I still don't understand why they do that. Anyway it isn't too bad so I rush in and take a sip. I get a full, strong maltiness that is balanced with a touch of hop flavor and a good bitterness to keep the malty sweetness in check. I get a slight hint of caramel as well but that's pretty much it. The beer alcohol level (6.5% by volume) seems pretty well hidden. Awesome!"
"This one poured a lot lighter than I expected. Sort of a deep golden color with a minimal white head that soon dissapates to nothing but a fine covering. Smelled a little bit light struck, but there was a sweet malty aroma as well. Very sweet on the initial taste, but a little bit of spice is present as the brew warms to room temp. A little bit of alcohol is noticable. Mouthfeel is a little sticky. Not a bad beer, just not the best I've ever had. I might revisit this sometime in the future, but nothing is compelling me to buy anymore of this at the moment."
"A good stronger German beer, Gutsy level of hoping results in a noticeably different beer from Germany."
"Pours nice, rich gold with creamy off-white head. German hop nose along with some Munich malt. Sweet up front in the mouth followed by some spicy hops and alcohol. Pleasant, firm bitterness followed by an almost lacto-sweet fruity aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little harsh from rough carbonation. Good body. One of the great maibocks. Right up there with Hofbrau and Ramstein, yes Ramstein."
"Poured a deep gold beer witha finger thick white head which subsided quickly. Aroma was of light toasty malt flavors that finished dry. The flavor began with a noble hop bitterness which was completly covered up with malt flavor soon after. A clean dry light malt flavor is the predominent character of this beer's flavor. The finish is full of lingering hop bitterness that reminds one of a fien German Pils. Body is medium wieh a bit of a carbonic bite. Overall I was not impressed with this brew as it seemed more like an out of balance Pils that a smooth Bock. A bit too much hop for rhe style and too light on the malt flavors as well. It is hard to criticize this beer, as Einbeck is wherer the Bock style originated but I believe that this beer is not a perfect pale bock."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a medium copper color with half a finger of head. There is minimal lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with a good caramel base. Just a touch of hops present. The taste is malty, with a good amount of alcohol coming through. A toffee sweetness and a bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and thick. The drinkability is pretty good too for 6.5%. A decent Maibock."
"A medium bodied beer of good complexity. Very drinkable, oy vey, was it ever drinkable!"
"Thoroughly enjoyable!"
"Probably my 2nd favorite Maibock of the season (after Penn's fantastic offering). A nice hop presence was a nice change of pace after the super honey-sweet offerings of most others. Quite good, and certainly one that I'll have again."
"The beer after separating from the 12 ounce green bottle set in the glass a translucent deep gold color, the head is portly in size, the texture semi-creamy, and the color a very light tan white with the residual lace a thick and clinging sheet to the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp to the senses, start is ambrosial, nice malt presence, the top is middling in its feel. Finish has a brisk acidity with a mild hops presence, very dry and lingering aftertaste, nice mild and drinkable beer"
"Overall, this is nicely drinkable. The occasional, euroskunk aromas probably result from the end bottles in the six pack being lightstruck in their green glass. Very nice representation of the style."
"This is a beer that's worth trying at least once, and it might surprise the taster. Not a top 50 beer by any stretch, but good enough that it's a decent choice if you're at your favorite beer store and having trouble deciding what to get."
"This beer sure looks nice. A deep, caramel tinged golden with an attractive just off white head, is accented by lace that kind of just sits there looking pretty. Aromas are deeply malty with some residual sweetness. This is a mouthfull of beer. Chewy in texture, it is perhaps a tad syrupy, and somewhat cloying, but a very distinct hop bitter is on hand throughout and evens things out to some degree. The beer went very well with homeade pretzels. On its own, without food though, this is a beer that I'll be happy with just one."
"The aroma sucked, but perhaps it was a bit skunked. Otherwise it was extremely smooth and drinkable. I'm turning into a hophead, so I'd prefer something with hops, but this brew is very well refined for the style. I will ding this beer for the smell right now; I'll have to try it again -- but the smell is the only thing I didn't like."
"On the whole, this is not a great standout beer, but a drinkable one nonetheless. Has a nice mouthfeel. Leaves no yeast residues in the green 0.33 liter bottle."
"Drinkability: Doesn't show the 8.5 abv at all. Very drinkable"
"Chill hazed pale golden yellow in color, thin whitish head not withstanding any staying power, thin collar remains and very minimal whispy strings of lace stick. Aroma has a sweetish bread malt tone thats sort of pale or dull, a bit candyish too in its sweetness. Taste is more of the same with a mild subdued presense of pale sweetness, lightly breadish, a bit of an acute bittering with a slight herbalness to its hops. Pleasingly mild taste. Feel is about medium bodied with a light frothy texture and finish that ends a bit dry. A reserved in pale sweetness overall with this Mai-bock makes it a bit bland but its actully quite tasty and becomes better as it warms where some of the breadish tones float in more."
"Drinkability was high but probably dangerous given relatively high ABV."
"I don't reviews beers often, but this beer is not bad. Pours a nice head, but short-lived head. Has a nice malty (if that's a word) smell. A nice smooth flavor. Only a 11. 2 oz. bottle, but at 6.5, kick your butt. You can drink more then one of these and it is worthwhile getting a few bottles when available."
"This beer poured an amber color with basically no head but left lots of lace in the glass. The aroma was of pale malt and I couldn't detect much else. The flavor in this beer comes out and attacks your tastebuds! It is intense. At first it threw me off but I really began to like this one once I got used to it. I can definietly tell this is a german beer with the german malts and it seemed yeasty, earthy hops are strong too but not too bitter. A strong beer that will kick your taste buds ass."
"Pours a solid off white head that holds up pretty well. Hazy, light amber in color. The aroma is a mildly malty, and just a little sweet. Sweet caramel malt in the taste is held in check by smooth spicy hoppiness. The finish is lightly bitter and alcoholic. An interesting, mildly strong beer. Definitely a good beer for a lounging around on a cool sunny breezy day."
"Drinkability: Crisper than the big malt taste and feel would suggest. Very drinkable and consistent (straight marks). A nice bock."
"Overall Impression: Was hoping to educate myself about the Maibock style with this, but never really got a feel for the style. Seemed like any other lager. I’ll keep looking. It did hide the alcohol well."
"poured with a pale orangy color with a nice thick dense head. spicy hop aroma or maybe a little skunky because of teh green bottle. sweet maltyness is poking through in the background. very smooth, balanced mouthfeel with a nice hoppy bite to cut through the malt in the aftertaste. excellent beer, definetly worth trying again."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with very active carbonation. Aromas are sweet, caramel, and grassy. First sip is grassy with a slight metallic finish. Metal fades and gives way to a balanced grain profile and a nice bitter hop finish. This was a medium bodied pale bock with a moderate drinkability."
"Light straw colored bock with lots of hops.. seemed odd for a mai bock.. it is very floral and has a nice appearance with good carbonation and some malt in the finish.. it is fairly smooth and drinkable for thse who enjoy hoppy bocks.. mouthfeel is good just the flavor had me shocked with the hoppiness. Skunky nose to start and remains throughout.. green bottles may be the culprit."
"I was pretty unimpressed with this brew. It was crisp and tingly. The bready malt flavor really overpowered any chance of a nice hop flavor to this brew. It was definitely a good beer and was very drinkable, but it was not what I wanted. Definitely a much different brew than other Maibocks sampled to date."
"Cheers"
"Sweet malt aroma with German hops wafting up. This beer is all about the malt and alcohol - hops play a supporting role - adequate but always at the back of the stage. Malt takes the spotlight with some herbal sweetness. Alcohol flavors are just one step behind, wrestling with the hops for second stage. My bottle was about 7 months beyond the ""best before"" date (didn't think to check until I got got home) but the beer seems to have held up well - no oxidized or sulfur flavors, even in a green bottle."
"Drinkability: High. This beer has more drinkability that its score would lead you to imagine. The sweetness brings the glass back to my lips."
"Initially this brew comes across as a tad unruly with alcohol the dominant presence, both in aroma and taste. By the second, third and forth gulp the hops begin to assert themselves and take center stage. The amber/orange color stands alone in the beer world. I had to keep looking at it and holding it to different lights and upgrading my initial appearance rating. The taste is extremely complex, that too required a raise in points. The ample malt body never achieves a platform of its own. It instead plays a wonderful supporting role to the competing stars. The off white heads performance is marvelous, though brief. Einbecker, by the way, is the inventor of the bock style. Because I was unsure of my ability to accurately rate this unusual style beer with one bottle, I found it necessary drink a second."
"A hefty brew for sure, but not among my Maibock favorites, even considering this bottle was clearly past it's prime."
"I never had a bock with so much structure."
"An average beer. Thin white head that settles fairly quickly. Quite good malty taste. Very nice body in deep copper color. Quite acceptable mouthfeel in my opinion. If you get the chance try it"
"Einbecker Ur-Bock: On tap at the Map Room in Chicago where it is the beer of the month, $3.00 for a pint. Deep copper color, with a heavy aroma of Vienna malts. Not much head, at all. The taste lives up to its aroma, with strong malts that dominate this brew. Not too bad, and very easy to drink and on the wallet."
"Very good, better than the dunkel. Quite a sticky pale malt flavour, with a herbal hoppyness towards the end, quite bitter and salty, i really like this a lot, strong and assertive, yet subtle in its flavour, if that makes any sense."
"The flavor was of malt and a bit of sweetness to it with the grain aspects adding to the sweetness in the finish.  I had this one a bit warmer, and think it would benefit from being colder,  which may mask the alcohol better."
"Dark copper color with an orange cast and light ruby highlights topped by a firm 1"" head that receeds but holds at 1/16"" and leaves an excellent lace as well. The aroma is solidly malty, balanced by a grassy hoppiness. (Also lightly skunky - green bottle!) The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Obviously a full bodied beer! The flavor starts with a solid maltiness - lightly sweet and caramel tinged - which becomes increasingly bitter as it crosses the palate, ending with dry (and unfortunately metallic flavor from oxidation) finish. Obviously an excellent beer, but a damaged bottle. I've had this beer before and remember it without defect. It's a solid one-two punch of malt and hop that expresses itself in slightly different ways throughout the glass (probably because as the malt sugars build in your mouth they retain the bitterness of the hops). And therefore, although it is not complex per se, it is a very interesting and enjoyable beer that keeps your attention."
"Slight metallic spoilt taste, could be due to green bottles or travel. Freshness date not notched on label. Decent cold, but I liked it better warm, as the malts come to forefront. Chewy, slides across the tongue. Delicious bready malts are the crux of this brew. Some slight tangy hoppiness, perfect finish. Small sips are the way to go, and swish it around for a while in your mouth. Wasn't wild about this beer at first swallow; it grows on ya."
"Pours a nice copper-ish color. It has a thin white head, good lace. The aroma is that of malt mainly, toasted light bread maybeIt has a nice full body. Initial taste is alcohol and a sweet malt base, then a nice notes of spicy hops, a little fruitiness as well. There is a tiny bit of warming in the finish. Overall a nice German Bockand also a cool looking green bottle..."
"On Tap @ Redbones. This brew has an amazing lace, thin but simply amazing and seems to stick just about everywhere. Bright tawny golden hue. Quite aromatic with an herbal hop presences and a double sweetness of alcohol and malt. Very clean palate with a bite from the hops as well as the alcohol, malt holds a solid medium bodied base and is sturdy enough to keep things in balance. Real easy to drink and went very well with the jerk beef sandwich."
"partly cloudy dark copper color, pours a rocky head which disappears quickly. soft euro aroma of malt and hops.  taste is exquisite!  sweet caramel and doughy malts with a lemony/honey background on a solid malt backbone.  slick and creamy mouthfeel.  you don't notice the alcohol until.....well... you know that warming feeling!  thanks to ADR for steering me towards this for a compare/contrast lesson in maibocks."

"This beer really suprised me.Clear to amberish in color.Not to much of a nose,but when you get it in your mouth you know they use alot of malts and very little hops when making this lager."
"So I grabbed an individual bottle again  last summer and ""tapped"" it...what a wonderful malty aroma and palate to this Spring Bock.  Its got a ""spring-like"" flavor too, like the soil and the greens hitting your nose.  While I'm an avowed ale guy for the most part, this brought back the memories and the reminders to keep tasting 'em all..."
"Notes: This is a big bock. Try it cold. As it warms, it tends to bring out characteristics that most people may not find enjoyable (in general, the warmer a beer gets, the more pronounced the natural flavours become)."
