"Great Beer!"
""

"Overall- A sweeter beer than I generally prefer and I definitely have some questions regarding the freshness of the beer (L 046 m on the back, not sure what it means).  Regardless, in its current condition it's still a solid beer that I'd gladly give another shot. ( 82/100)."

"Mouthfeel: Medium body medium carbonation. Very smooth mouthfeel."

"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bready malts. Taste is malts, biscuits, some sweetness, alcohol is present as well, just a touch of hops.Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."

"Quite an enjoyable one from Hofbräuhaus despite the fact that there wasn't exactly a whole lot going on with this one other than the balance malts throughout. The beers most appealing aspects were the full bodied and smooth taste as well as how easy it was to sip away at."
"the darker bock/doppelbock styles but this is the first maibock I've had. Without knowing the style, I can just say that I enjoyed this one a lot."
""
""
"Aroma is floral and lightly nutty, with a mineral quality. Flavor reveals more mineral and earthy hops, with a touch of toasted malt and a slightly sour note with a bitter finish. Expected much more malt character. The sour taste is offputting."

"Maibock is one of my favorite styles, with Einbecker Mai-Urbock my first and favorite of the genre. This one is close, but not quite as light....still a super high-quality beer, for those who know quality beer is more about malt, than hops."

"Poured on-tap into a mug. Pours red orange with a small white head. Smells of roasted malt with slight berries. Tastes of slight fruit nice malt, sweet but not too sweet. Beer is lightly carbonated, light bodied, crisp finish. Overall a pretty good beer."

"Overall: One of the best Maibock's I've tried (and I've tried many). I love this style, and this one is a perfect example of it. Well balanced with big flavors and a good ABV to match."
""
""
""
"O: I was impressed! Dark, flavorful, hoppy with fruity notes. A favorite."
"Pours a nice medium amber in color with a about a half finger off-white head. Left some very nice 'spider web like' lacing. The aroma is of malts and hops with NO 'skunky' smell that is very common with brews in green bottle for some reason. The taste is very smooth actually with the malts and hops blended nicely with a very light 'hoppy' finish which wasn't bad and didn't linger at all. Perfect carbonation. Goes down easy."
""

"Sure, this was a bit strong but it never felt it and the old saying of ""the original being the best"" held true here to a large extent. The dry finish ensured that the flavors lingered nicely for a while and this had a pretty easygoing nature to it like a good Maibock should. Great for this time of the year or for anyone unaccustomed to this style. Another solid offering from Hofbrau."
""
""
"First time tasting this beer. Thicker than Hofbraü Original, but still very good. Definitely more hops and a more ""fully bodied"" taste. I don't know if it's better than Original, but still a very good beer and one I would buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall. Better and stronger than original Hofbrau. The noble Hops are stronger but so are the malts. But its perfectly balanced. Has a nice red/amber color. Head retention is great. Lacing is good. Smell and taste are excellent. I would buy this any day. Where has it been hiding? Better than the original."

"O: My first Maibock, and I enjoyed it."

"Poured from a green bottle (!) into an Oktoberfest mug. This lager is an orange-amber color with some off-white to tan foam. Smells exceeding malty, with caramel, toasty, and nutty elements. Body fairly heavy and this brew is quite sweet with a moderate degree of carbonation. Taste is very malt-forward, with caramel and bread crust flavors combining with the buttery mouthfeel to yield a waffles and dark syrup effect, quintessential German malt. There is also a fermented honey sweetness and the hops are more assertive than expected, herbal and minty. I'd rate the flavor higher were it not for traces of a metallic skunked flavor due to the packaging. I feel fortunate though ... This example must have been protected quite well from light, as the skunk was a minor nuisance than did not ruin the entire experience. I can imagine than this would be sublime on tap. Shitty to put such a great malt showcase in a green bottle. Bad call probably based on marketing but do not be dissuaded from trying this if you are a fan of classic German sweet malts. The malts are plenty assertive but the hops also get their licks in ... Well done."
""

""
"First thing I noticed was how the bitterness in this doesn't blend well with the rest of the beer. Ignoring the bitterness the yeast also has a strong flavor that adds to the sharpness in flavor. Its that slight sourness I get from certain lagers but really strong in this one. The very toasty breaded malty flavor does please my buds."

""
"Not a great beer but in the guidelines for style."

"A pleasant little bock beer. It's a bit on the sweet side but has enough malt and hop goodness, tempered with a mild alcohol background, that things just seem to gel into one delicious lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not my favorite style but this one works well for me today, might hurt ya on a hot summer day if you were to session this but one or two would treat you well"
"Overall, a great beer. I've certainly had maibocks that I liked better, but it's a nice, crisp change-up with a fuller body for some heft."
""
"O: I like the full amount of flavor, but not a huge fan of the metal/mineral flavor. Nice and refreshing."
""
""
"o: A top notch brew! I'm more a malt and yeast than hop fan, and this one made me a fan of Hofbrau."
""
""
"O: This seems to be a decent example of a style that isn't a personal favorite, but one that I'm trying to explore. However, this one is more sweet than it should be for style, especially on the finish. Still, not altogether unenjoyable. I wouldn't refuse another, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An agreeable enough maibock, especially considering the higher than average ABV, good and malty, fruity, and not overwhelmed by said booze. Unfortunately, given the strength, this is not really worthy of a session at a spare wooden table, as it were."
""
"Tasty and satisfying. I'd say, stop overlooking this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good, robust lager that I enjoyed, but Hofbrau's green bottles plus the journey to the US don't help in the freshness department. With a trip to Germany in the cards for sometime next year, this is one beer I'll be looking to have on tap."
"O - Simply put, this is a great beer. It has good balance, flavor, and drinkability. The alcohol is masked well and the hop profile lends a wide array of different flavors."
""
"O - This beer is on the sweet side, but it was pretty good. There were enough hops to balance out the finish."
""
""
""
"Hofbräu Maibock pours a clear, copper color. A half-inch of light beige head tops the brew and settles slowly. Caramel and bready malt aromas dominate the nose as lighter hop and yeasty aromas provide some more depth. Bready to begin with, sweeter caramel malt flavors move in with hints of honey and nuts swirling into a slightly hoppy and alcoholic finish. This classic example of the style is moderately carbonated with a medium body."

"O - I normally reach right for the hefeweizen at a German brauhaus, but since this was in-season I gave it a shot - and I'm glad I did. It is slightly sweet, but not cloying at all and very easy to get carried away drinking."
"It's getting warmer, which means it's maibock time, folks! This one pours a clear brass topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises biscuit, light honey, and a decidedly light bit of dry grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with some extra helpings of grass and flowers, and a vague fruitiness pervading the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice maibock, one of the base staples of the style in my eyes."
""
"Would pick this up again. Glad I tried it."

"Overall, a decent beer, pretty average on most account, and probably nothing I would go back to. I haven't had too many maibocks, but I would imagine there'd be better ones out there than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have no experience with Maibocks, but to me this tastes comparable to an oktoberfest with above-average bitterness. Drinkable, but nothing to write home about."
""
"My only advice is to try and drink it slower than I did!"

"Had this on tap at Kaizerhof in Yurakucho, Tokyo. Poured into a glass stein. Whiskey-hued clear brew with a beautiful foamy white head... love the appearance of this beer. Roasted hops dominates the palate in this brew. Delicious but not very layered in flavors or smell. Overall, this is a great drinking beer, but not exactly a complex number worth talking about too much. I enjoyed it and would definitely drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty clear copper with a large head. Nice lacing on the surface. Smell is toasted malt with a little herbal and grassy hops. Fairly standard. Taste is huge toasted malt. Balanced by tons of hops. Herbal and spicy. Smooth and full bodied. Nicely carbonated. Great mouthfeel. This was absolutely great on tap at Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh with German food. So balanced and tasty and drinkable. This is also fast becoming one of my favorite styles- nice strong hoppy german beer for spring time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is malty with caramel and toffee but I do get a bit of spicy and wet grass hops on the finish. The beer actually finishes dry and with just a little bite, which I didnt anticipate from the nose. No real hint of alcohol and a very easy drinking clean beer. Nothing too complex or to get excited over, but certainly enjoyable and not flawed."
""
""
""
"O - This is definitely a staple for Maibocks, having no real weaknesses and is just a solid, all-around, good beer. It packs quite a bit of flavor, yet is still very drinkable and satisfying, especially on this cool, early Spring day. Without a doubt, this is a brew that I'll be enjoying again during next year's Spring season."
"Enjoyed at the East Side Restaurant in New Britain, Connecticut this is a dark amber color with a decent off-white cover and hearty lacing. The aroma is deep nutty malt and woodsy wheat. Very definitive and tasty. The flavor brings out more delicious malt grain with a herbal hop kiss. This is earthy stuff with a beautiful sweet molasses theme that is easy drinking in this medium bodied brew. Carbonation is relatively modest but it has a smooth feel that ends with just a hint of dryness. This is a wonderful malt flavorfest. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall, it is a great beer, that is surprisingly sessionable. However, its high abv makes it unwise to do so! Understandably, it is not a beer you should consume in a sequence."
"Overall this was good and is worth trying, but just a tad bit too sweet for me. Anyone into sweet malt and bready flavor will love this brew."
""
"O: Overall it's great. I'd love to try it at the HB Haus on draft."
""
""
"Overall all pretty good. This one was thin on flavor at times though. The hops seemed rough and didn't seem to pair with the rest of the components. I would drink this again but wouldn't seek it out."
"When will the Euros finally realize Americans aren't fooled by the ""exotic"" green bottles anymore."
""
""
""
"Notes: Dam good inside and out a pleasant dryness on the palate and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and some burnt caramel aromas. Taste is very much the same with a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing too memorable."
""
""
"I'm finding some good things to appreciate in this beer; I'm glad I pick up a bottle, though it might not be the freshest. Worth a shot."
"In my opinion, this is a world-class beer. It's insanely drinkable, yet complex enough to keep you coming back to it over and over. Want a tasty maibock to celebrate the spring or acknowledge your German heritage? This is a really good one. It's not extreme. It's just a good, strong, substantial brew. Nice!"
"a classic german maibock. this one pours a nice amber to indian brown color, with a nice white head to the top of the glass. smells very german malty, sweet but light, perfect for spring. flavor is definitely malt driven, with some caramel undertones and a mild tartness at the end. feel isnt bad, a little flat in my opinion. i think this beer suffers from green bottle syndrome, but who knows. lighter and very drinkable despite its hefty alcohol content. even though this is the standard, i like a lot of the american maibocks better from a mouthfeel standpoint."
""
""
""
"Overall: A-, looking forward to have this again!"
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a little more tolerable and I could do worse, but I am done with this beer."
"This beer pours a clear copper color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small ring of lacing around the edges of the glass. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, and biscuits. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is a lot of complex malty characters in both the taste, and aroma of this beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a good maibock that I would certainly drink again."
"Overall I was somewhat disappointed with this beer. Too much butter and not enough bitterness. I will say that the six pack I bought was marked way down and is probably from last year but nonetheless, it wasn't too great."

""

"O - Hofbrau's Maibock was a good beer for the style that I could only imagine would have been a lot better if wasn't slightly skunked due to the stupid decision of putting it in a green bottle. Even in the green bottle, it is still an enjoyable beer. Would love to try on draft or if I could find it in a brown bottle."
""
""
"O - A very drinkable beer that is recommended."

"O- The darkest and maltiest maibock i have had. Its a tasty malty brew. The majority of beers in this style i have had before are paler and drier in the finish with not such a strong malt presence. I definitely prefer this flavour profile, its more like a normal bock. Satisfying malt backbone with a lager clean finish, too easy to drink. Prost!"
"Overall- This has the makings of a great beer. Can't say I've tasted a lot of maibocks but from what I can read; this one is spot on."
"Yick, green bottles and the singles rack at Kroger, and I knew better too."
"D - Great beer, I can't imagine what it tastes like fresh from the source, hopefully I'll find out one day. Reco."
"p- stellar pairing with bratwurst served with a sweet onion sauce."
"I gave in and tried another one of these and this one wasn't skunked and it is a much better beer, my initial review isn't bad but this is definitely better, a nice caramel / toffee flavor with a bitter after taste, hopefully they change the bottle. I'd change taste on this to 4/5, but I'm going to leave it for now."
"O - What a great, well-crafted, clean beer. After being immersed in the world of crazy american craft brew experimentation, sometimes it's just nice to appreciate something that the majority of people would think of as ""beer""...just plain beer...but so well done."
"I must reitterate if you see this on tap buy a big stein, it is a whole different beer, but I expect HB to get with modern bottle engineering (with a date)."
"O: Refreshing and really drinkable beer, the honey flavor really shines and brings the other flavors together."
"German bock - the best beer makers, making one of the best beers. I highly recommend trying this one."
"overall - sort of disappointed in this one, also made me think about something, why do breweries even bother putting their beer in green bottles anyways? Everytime I have sampled something from a green bottle, it comes out skunked without fail. I'd love to try this fresh or on tap as this beverage was clearly affected by being lightstruck. If you are new to the style, I wouldn't reccommend starting with this one"
"A rich caramel color with a thin white head that fades fast but has nice sea foam lacing. I may have a better review than most since I got it from a fresh tap at the Hofbrau House in Panama City instead of a green bottle. Sweet caramel and honey notes on the nose with a touch of herbal, earthy, noble hops. The taste is on the sweeter side, with rich caramel, honey and toffee notes followed with an earthy, herbal, grassy hop back bite. Very well balanced. My favorite of the Hofbrrau family I tried. Very easy to drink even on the sweet side. Less watery than their other selections. Very easy to drink. Slightly syrupy, but well balanced medium bodied beer."
"I suspect this keg didn't make the journey halfway around the world with all its goodness intact, though it was easy to put away a pint of this beer."
"The Hofbrauhaus Maibock is richly flavored--a mixture of sweetness and malt that lingers, with additional flavors that cut through to prevent the sweetness from becoming cloying. The color, as seen through a liter mug, is like that of goldenrod honey--darker and more orange than clover. I can imagine that there might be better maibocks, but I've never had one, and even if I do, it won't displace this one from my memory."
"Hofbräu Maibock not only provides a definition of the style that's worthy of Webster’s, but it is exactly the kind of beer you serve to people who think lagers are a boring waste of time. It is tremendously rich, subtly complex, deceivingly quaffable and brewed with a stringent level of attention to pertinent detail that really only the Germans are capable of."
"It's decent as far as style is concerned, but not really a masterful palate. The beer just doesn't really interest or impress me."
"Ahh there we go. Nice nutty character with a good dose of earthy, bittering noble hops drying things out quickly on the finish. Toffee and caramel, stale bread, flint, slate, light acidity, walnut, and brown sugar. Carbonation is lively in the middle leaving the palate at attention through the finish."
"Overall, quite ok, sessionable, but the boozy finish will be a constant reminder of how a session is going."
"Heavier than most American beers of the style but by no means heavy. Super flavorful and easy to drink. Lovely stuff."
"The beer is transparent and light orange colored, with a small white head. Pockets of carbonation are visible throughout the beer. The aroma smells of a sweet lager with hints of fruit. The beer has a mild earthiness about it. The flavor brings a distinctive German lager character, with light fruit and a present sweetness. One is plenty for me, as the sweetness slowly becomes cloying. A decent brew and a solid example of the style, I would have it again."
"Round flavor/feel of an ale. Reminds me of a Scotch Ale. Lots of caramel, but the swallow is nicely balanced with a notable hop spice. Interestingly the aftertaste is sweetness (brown sugary). Very rich body, almost like whole milk. Carbonation is also above average, making this a great mouthfeel. Overall, one of the nicest Bocks I've ever had."
"Pours a transparent copper color with a 1 finger white head. Smells of light sweet malts. Taste is Starts with sweet malts, then I get a bit of hoppiness as it gets farther back on my tongue. Mouthfeel is just where it should be, in my opinion, if you don't notice the mouthfeel, it's just right. Overall this is a dang good beer, I thoroughly enjoyed this and would jump at a chance to buy it again."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light bread, flavor is malty bread with hints of sweetness but hops are there. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $1.69 for a 330ml bottle from Kappy's Fine Wine & Spirits Peabody, Ma."
"This bottled version is good, but the HB Maibock was FAR better on-tap in Munich. Zum Wohl!"
"Beer is heavier in body that I expected but tastes nice. The beer leads off with this mild sweetness and a bitterness on the end with a mildly dry finish. Mouthfeel is good and the flavor is nice, if you are looking for a slightly heavier maltier lager that's highly drinkable, here you go. I'd have it again."
"Highly recommended."
"O: A decent bock that could use some more malt complexity but is pleasant and a nice afternoon treat, as long as the ABV doesn't catch up with you."
"overall; not the best Maibock I have ever had but still quality and for the price it can't be beat. I reccomend this gem as a go to example of the style, buy it by the case."
"Notes: The first few sips are heavy on the mineral notes and are bit distracting. Luckily this fades somewhat as it warms and more of the sweetness comes out. Overall I would call this a good average Maibock."
"O - A very refreshing and unexpected splash of flavor. Highly enjoyable and a nice style of beer."
"On tap poured into a 1L stein at Hofbrau Las Vegas. Clear, caramel/amber color with a light tan head. Bready, doughy, malty, caramel, lightly sweet aroma. Nice amount of carbonation helped keep some lacing on top of the beer as I drank it. Lots of malty caramel flavor, bisquit, a bit of bitterness mid palate keeps it in balance. Light mouthfeel, dry finish."
"Served in a Flute glass. Pours a nice light amber color with about an inch of nice foamy white head that dissipates rapidly for the most part. The beer is mostly transparent with a slight cloudiness and a very large amount carbonation bubbles which can be seen bubbling through the beer from the bottom up. These carbonation bubbles help to maintain the small amount of head that lingers at the top of the brew. There is very little lacing (residual foam left on the glass) with this beer, which, as I understand it is typical of the style. The beer has a very nice overall scent of a nice sweetness, possibly similar to dark fruits, and a very slight molasses note. This brew has a very pleasant taste with an initial underlying sweetness similar to grapes and a nice deep malty finish that lingers on the back of the palate. The Hofbrau Maibock, although it is 7.2%, seems to have absolutely no alcohol burn which really makes it easy to drink. The deepness of the brew really helps the overall taste, but does hurt how easily it drinks. Overall, I found it to have a simple taste, smoothness on the palate, and nice depth."
"D - very good drinkability. I am still playing with the taste and want to find out more. Very nice and refreshing one."
"Their hoppy zestiness is right on the money style, but you don't lose the maltiness or breadniess on the tongue. Glad this one comes in 6 packs, fantastic beer if you're in the mood for a classic big bock."
"Pours a moderate copper color that is slightly hazed. Off white head with good retention and some good lacing. Nose is loads of malt with a tiny bit of hop and spice. Taste is malty with some light fruits lingering in the background. A slight yeast character is present as well. Body and carbonation are a little off, but overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Overall: A good beer, shouldn't be off-putting to anyone that drinks it. I would score this higher, but I think the beer is lacking pizazz. A definite step up from BMC."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer with flavor and substance that make it worth drinking for a long time."
"IT has a pretty good drinkability for being 7.2%abv. It has some nice crisp lager flavors, but a little sweet as well, and just a hint of warming booze."
"Hofbräu Maibock hit the spot after a long bike ride on a cool late-summer day. Although not complex or overly-memorable, it is sweet, but not syrupy and has a great finish."
"I grabbed one of these in a mixed six pack the other day at Martys in Newton. The color on this brew is a dark orange, almost amber, with a large crown of frothy white head. Musty nose brings forth butterscotch, fresh grains, brown bread, and something almost egg like. Taste is full of flavors such as white cake, herbs and floral notes, more fresh grain etc. The mouthfeel is much lighter than I would have expected, which jacks up the drinkability by a notch or two. Although this tastes like a sessionable Maibock, the alcohol that is listed makes me think otherwise. I love big lagers like this one."
"Well Done."
"D - Decently refreshing and quaffable. Pleasantly surprised by the experience."
"Pours a clear reddish orange with a big creamy tan head. Spicy clove aroma. Taste is pumpernickel bread up front, with a spicy, herbal hop middle and finish. A hint of alcohol can be tasted. Mouthfeel is rich and chewy, low carbonation. Drinkability is average, one of these per session is good, the flavors get a bit cloying after about 10 oz."
"Hofbrau Maibock poured a copper color that was almost red, with a small white head that bearly lasted. It smells spicey and a little bit hoppy. It has a very smooth and slightly hopy slightly spicey taste. The flavors werent too strong, but still very present. It was very easy to drink, and I could easily drink another. Overall I found it a good beer, very smooth, and just enjoyable."
"Clear amber with a coppery hue and a short, cream coloured cap. Fair head retention with a bit of short-lived lace. Malty aroma, toasted marshmallow, caramel, bread. Slight hop smell, a bit fruity and floral. Low bitterness with strong malty sweetness. Toasted and caramel notes were evident up front, slightly grainy, followed by light hop presence. Alcohol flavour and warmth linger in the finish. Medium bodied with carbonation that was on the creamy side. Light dryness, but with a slightly slick texture. I liked the aroma, but I'm not sold on this beer based on the flavour. It's not that I didn't enjoy it, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to based on the smells I picked up initially."
"If this beer wasn't so high in ABV, it would be excellent in terms of drinkability, especially for a malt lover. However, it does truly limit you. This is an excellent offering from Hofbräu, who usually make good beers. Worth trying in early spring when you're tired of roasted and spiced winter beers but it's still too cold out to break out the golden lemon fizzy stuff."
"Drinkability: A nice malt bomb that that the characteristics I associate with German brews. I could have two or three. A sipper."
"D- I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and will probably buy more in my next stop."
"Once again, the Germans do it right."
"Drinkability: Good. Hofbrau produces a good range of tasty beers and I have yet to be disappointed."
"Imported by Hofbrauhaus of America, Vasser, MI."
"D - Great flavors from this Maibock and one I'd like to drink a few of. It's crisp yet refreshing with no ""off"" flavors."
"This is probably the best beer I have tried from the Hofbräuhaus. That includes the fresh drafts brewed in Pittsburgh and the imported bottles from Germany. I have to say, every Hofbräuhaus beer is infinitely better from a fresh keg than it is bottled, and this beer is definitely not an exception to that rule."
"Not the best Maibock I've ever had, and surely much better tapped at the source. But one that I would always welcome in my glass."
"D: This is a great example of the style. Fresh and flavorful, these go down very easy. The ABV is not detectable at all."
"D: This beer is very easy to consume and highly sessionable. The alcohol is very well masked from the taste."
"O: At first I really liked but, but the hop flavor seemed off on the finish."
"Overall- this brew is pretty damn good. if you come across this pick it up! some basic (staple) german brews i feel like they still have that macro lager taste where the carbonation is alil to much but not this one. a truely solid brew."
"Overall it was a pretty good maibock."
"I bekieve this is the first Maibock I have ever tryed. It had a nice deep coppec color and a thin tan head that faded fairly guickly. a very malty nose that lasted right to the tounge, with a touch of noble hops in the back ground. A heavy carmal sweatness that stayed on the tounge for a long time, a very relaxing beer that I woll by agian."
"drinkability - this style is quickly becoming a personal fav and this beer is one if not the best i have had"
"I had this brew in a Hofbrau Haus in the states. This beer has a beautiful deep cooper color and crystal clear, but overall the flavor isn't as nice as the color. It lacks aroma, but is true to the style with very little hops and lots of caramel. You can feel the warmth from the alcohol, and the finish is sweet. Not a bad beer and a good endeavor for those looking for something more than pale lager. However, it won't inspire those that are used to bolder flavors."
"D: I could sip this all day if I had the time. Love it!"
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable beer and I could easily have another."
"Beer is a bright amber color with a decent head. The aroma reminded me of mostly of roasted nuts. The taste was sweet but clean. The feel was a creamy smooth and went down way too easy. Very drinkable beer, but not too many due to the higher ABV."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass with about an inch of head. Light tan/amber color. Scents of roasted nuts, malty bread-like biscuits. Amazing tastes sweet, smooth lager. Some dry white bread flavors. Malts, and sweet caramel, nutty flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth, be careful the alcohol will sneak up on you."
"On tap, the Hofbräu Maibock is not to be missed, and offers a great degree of complexity and ""liveness"". (From the bottle, I found this beer to be much less complex in aroma and flavor, an a touch less sweet.)"
"Yum!"
"goes down smooth. hints of alcohol don't come in the way of a pretty refreshing and tasty beer. well-balanced between the herbal, spicy hops and the sweet malt."
"D- Great drinkability as a session beer. Enjoyable and a great spring beer."
"Recommended"
"Herbal, looks like spring sunshine in a glass. Perfect beer for spring or summer. Slightly sweet, but not overwhelming. Medium carbonation, very smooth. Hints of malt, nuttiness, lemon and herbs. Would definitely buy again. Pair this with fish/chips, with plenty of malt vinegar, with a dash of horseradish on the side."
"D: Very drinkable indeed."
"A clear amber color pour with a two finger foamy white head , lively carbonation. Aroma is nutty , roasty with hints of caramel and spicy hops. Flavor is crisp and clean like the mouthfeel , bread crust grassy spicy hops with a dry roasted grain finish lightly sweet with a mild bitterness , medium body , a good sessionable drinker and a nice brew."
"And at 7.2 percent ABV, one of these glasses goes a long way. Very good dark golden color, not a lot of aroma but the flavor is excellent. A great way to ease into the lighter german beers of summer."
"Notes: great strong, malty sweet brew a just enough spicy hops for character"
"It's a good beer. Sweet without being overpowering."
"D: A really nice beer and another score for Hofbrau. Great to pair with spicy or gravy-laden dishes and quite satisfying on its own. The alcohol might get to your head quickly if you keep up with them, but it's best enjoyed in moderation anyway, right?"
"Pours a clear, red/copper color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, yeast, pale malt, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, yeast, sweet malt, and pale malt. Overall, a totally different beer on draft than in bottle - very tasty."
"D: This was a nice change of pace from the Weizens and Festbiers that dominated my drinking on this trip. The slight warmth made for good contrast to a cool late summer evening. Of the Hofbrau beers I've had, this is easily my favorite."
"Overall, WOW! My first maibock ever and I'm hooked! This is alot lighter than your average dopple. My favorite part is the overall refreshing qualities this beer has. I can see how this bock was made for the Spring season. Everything in great balance here without sacrificing any complexity."
"Overall - The quick disappearance of the head is the main fault of Hofbräu Maibock. This is not the sort of beer you should introduce to inexperienced drinkers, but enthusiasts will certainly find it enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and creamy in the mouth, the gentle prickle is outstanding and the highlight of this beer's review. If I have the opportunity to sample this again, it will be with a traditional German breakfast or lunch of bratwurst with potato pancakes."
"A lovely beer, too strong for more than one 500mL bottle at a time, but I would definitely cough up the $ to drink this again."
"D - The higher alcohol makes this a little harder to drink than others in the style, but still fairly drinkable."
"Hofbrau Maibock poured a nice amber color, but had no head what so ever, and just ok lacing. The smell was nice with caramel and hints of hops. On lighter side, which lost it some points. Taste was very nice, filled with caramel and brown sugar, and very nice hop back. Mouthfeel was a bit on the sticky side, but was ok. Drinkability was nice. Overall I found this to be a nice beer. I will buy this again."
"12oz. green bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a clear copper with two fingers of off white head. Rich malty aroma, not really caramel, but that distinctive German malt aroma. Also some faint noble hops. The flavor is not as malty as the aroma might suggest, but there is a good malt base. On the lighter side of medium bodied. There is a bit of hop bitterness in the middle. Not sweet at all for all the malt, actually finishes fairly dry. Very drinkable to me. Nice bock."
"I picked this up in one of the PA distributors (yeah, PA--the state with the f*cked up case law) near my job. I got it just as the German season for drinking it is coming to a close, but I feel I got there in time. Just before the Helles Lagers take over for summer!"
"D- Very drinkable, lives up to the Hofbrau standard...good example of the style"
"D- a satisfying brew, malty and quite hoppy, like a german IPA if you will. big grain flavors and hop bitterness is awesome but something just gets out of whack with the MF for me. however it is nice to have a traditional maibock. wish i could find one from the super bestest brewery ayinger."
"Poured a 12 oz (green, why?) bottle into a Sam Adams glass. High but short-lived off-white head on top of a golden-orange brew. Aroma of fresh-baked sweet bread and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is all about a fresh-grain malty goodness. A nutty melanoiding flavor is present, with just enough alcohol and background hop bitterness to keep the finish on the dry side. Seems to be medium bodied, though it probably comes in a little heavier than it seems. All in all a dangerously sessionable beer that shouldn't be sessioned. I was thinking this deserved to be listed as an exemplar of the style by BJCP, and it is."
"D - This is a pretty good maibock. Another quality brew from Hofbrau that I'd like to try fresh on tap in Germany."
"looks the color of tea with a short quickly fading beige head and almost no lace to speak of. sweet aromas of sugar and caramel candy. sweet toasted malt, touch of caramel, hint of fruit, maybe raisin, sweet tea middle ending with a slightly bitter tea. medium body and slightly chewy mouthfeel. very easy beer to drink, hides the 7.20 abv very well this one could sneak up on you very quickly. so far i have had three styles of beer from hofbrau and all have been above average beers."
"EDIT: I've had the bottled Maibock and I'm still not sure it's the same beer. Maybe it's similar, but the draft version is more of a malt bomb, while the bottled version is hoppier. Their dunkel is the same way, but with this brew the difference is a mile wide. On tap this is an absolute delight and one of my Munich favorites. From a bottle it's so-so."
"had this on tap at he breezy point inn on greenwood lake - poured into it's branded 20oz tall fluted glass - one finger head dwindled quickly, and left some good lacing patterns down the glass - color kind of amber-brown - a malty aroma comes up with a sweet fruitiness - taste is smooooth with a creamy ""bock-iness"" that paired nicely with my steak and potatoes - drinkability is good - i could have had another."
"D - Wow, damn good. Exemplary for the style."
"The taste is similar: rich, dark raisiny alcohol and spiciness, rich sweet toasted bread, leaves (faintly tea-like), dried fruit. It has nice full sweetness with a light spicey-leafy bitterness and dried-fruit spiciness. The elements balance nicely and last, maintaining lasting character and it has a full, frothy feel."
"A very enjoyable Maibock, with plenty of sweet caramel. Recommended."
"Has a slightly spicy sweet smell; very inviting. Taste starts off with a malty sweetness that is very rapidly taken over by a hoppy sharpness and finishes dry. The sweet malt flavor is there, but isn't as strong or as persistent as other bocks I have been trying lately. I like it, and feel it is a nice interpretation of the style."
"D -- Not bad, but dangerous at 7.2. The syrupiness could wear heavy after more than a couple."
"Overall- Nice and sweet. Maybe a tad too sweet though. Another good Spring beer."
"Soft but ample carbonation and a medium body. Nice feel. A great beer and an interesting take on the style."
"Quite a wonderful beer. The heft of the malt and cleanliness of the finish would pair well with flavorful pork dishes. Why not have some with your Easter ham?"
"Pours a crystal clear copper orange color with a small white head that dissipates to nothing but a thin ring within seconds of the pour. Rich malts in the nose, husky, with a hint of a fruity hop character. Good balance in flavor, rich, semi sweet malts right away coat and linger in the mouth a brighting hop bite appears just before the finish and hangs out long into the aftertaste. Toffee, a little nutty and a small hint of chocolate, good malt structure here no doubt. This is by far the best bottled beer ive had to date from Hofbräu. Outstanding drinkability, im having a hard time believing that this is 7.2%. Light/medium in body, a bit sticky, mild carbonation. Good beer, almost sessionable, i think the sweetness would become cloying after a few..."
"D: Meh. Nothing unpleasant here, but nothing to write home about. Easy to drink, but I'm not quite impressed with this."
"Very, Very drinkable. I could drink this all night."
"Very solid and drinkable Maibock."
"Straight-ahead with no real surprises - good for cooling day outside...late fall or early spring."
" Refreshing, fairly clean with well hidden alcohol, good drinkability."
"I wish the taste of this beer was like the nose. I wanted the big malts on my tongue instead of the off flavors that interfered with the caramel malts. Other than that, this beer is light and has some decent maltiness."
"drinkability is particularly through the roof considering the (just read it and am astounded) 7.2%. ( is that correct??)"
"D: Very tasty, balance, easy going down...nuff said."
"I'm giving this beer a fairly high score because it is just so exceptionally brewed. It hits every note it's supposed to without having a single off node. It's simultaneously light and heavy, crisp and airy but still complex and flavorful. It's like a good one act play, one that's about a clown or a dog or something (not a writer or a woman who was just raped). You think ""uhh, this is gonna be too much right now, why didn't I just stay home and watch TV"" but then you laugh your ass off and don't get too emotionally involved. But, still, when it's over you're sad. You've been affected. It had a message and you received it. That's what this beer is like."
"Fairly light carbonation and mouthfeel approaches the lighter side. Ridiculously drinkable given the firm alcohol content. One of the better Maibocks I've had and follows the German tradition closely. Recommended with general German dishes. The spicing should allow this beer to hold up to the more assertive dishes as well."
"The taste was toasted caramel, low carbonation, sweet malts, some hop in the finish, very enjoyable, very smooth. This is a solid offering from a very traditional brewhouse in Germany. L'Chaim."
"A complex, nice drinking lager. Would consider buying again."
"D: A nice fruity drink for the hot summer weather."
"Recommended..."
"Regular Hofbräu is my regular beer, but I do like darker stuff also so I was glad my local BevMax started getting this beer."
"A great example of the style. This is a truly enjoyable beer."
"D: I can drink this. You can't notice any alcohol and it is very clean and crisp. This is a lovely beer."
"Pours a clear copper color with an average off-white head. The aroma is of doughy malt and caramel; a bit fruity. The taste is sweet with caramel and honey flavors. There is a big doughy malt that runs throughout and ends with a slight grape note along with a small spicy hop to balance out. The feel is moderate with perfect carbonation, fairly balanced leaning towards the sweet end. This Maibock drinks very well and I was surprised to see the 7.2%ABV as you can't detect it."
"Drinkability: Very nice and also very crisp and clean. You coould have several of these in a sitting and be content. Very nice and a good example of the style. Good beer."
"Notes: This was not an incredible experience,but I buy it when I see it. It is seasonal for the spring and it has it's merits. Not too strong despite the ABV,light and smooth."
"This is a truly super beer, one of my new favorites."
"D- It was tasty enough to easily enjoy more than 1 in a sitting."
"I really enjoyed the fruit aspect of this beer. A definite malt experience, but the hops are strong enough to offer balance and a pleasant dry, spicy bitterness in the finish."
"A bit of heat from the alcohol lowers the drinkability a bit. Good full mouthfeel. Pretty nice."
"D: Not feeling this beer. That's all I've got to say."
"D - The somewhat hot alcohol flavor combines in an unfortunate way with the harsh hop bitterness to create an unpleasant taste that overwhelms the malt characteristics. Not particularly drinkable."
"D: Not a bad brew at all... enough oomph to show it has some attitude, but rather easy for the style."
"Hofbräu Maibock is a bit spicy and bitter, but is quite tasty. The flavor is mostly biscuit with tartness like grapefruit."
"After reading that this beer is a spring release (Maibock duh!) and I bought this in mid February doesn't sound good. Also, at the LHBS this green bottle was stored directly under the lighting... but alas. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear amber-orange color with a fine bubbly, one-finger head. The smell is malty sweet, slight fruitiness and obvious skunking (which I had expected from above). The taste is very much the same, malty backbone - slightly toasted, very skunked and no perceivable hop flavor but there is some perceived bitterness. The mouthfeel is light in body with a minimal amount of mouth-tingling carbonation. Drinkability is still relatively decent because of the light mouthfeel and low carbonation but that doesn't make it desirable. I would love to try this a little fresher, I'm sure it's much MUCH better. Also, for 7.2% it's not really very noticeable - even in full skunk form."
"12 oz bottle, into a mug glass. It pours a light reddish amber with a modest but consistent head. Very light malt aroma with some grassy hops lurking at the edge. Flavor is a bit bland and disappointing. Even for a maibock, the malt is fairly light on the palate. More bitterness might make things a bit more interesting. Does have a nice body and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: nice balance of taste and gentle carbonation makes for easy consumption. I would drink several of these at any one sitting."
"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable! A well balanced beer that shows off both malt and hop."
"Drinkability: Fairly quaffable. Sessionable, surprising to see it's so high in alcohol."
"Taste is very malty and pretty bitter, more bitter than I expected. The malt is biscuity and light caramellic. Again the yeast gives this beer such a great extra boost of balance, every sip is enjoyed. The beer is a bit sticky, but not overly sweet. Drinkability is great, especially for it's 7,2%."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. It is seriously malty, and that is not a bad thing. It leaves me a bit wanting for some floral noble hops to taste. I am not saying that this is out of style, but the Maibock's that I am used to making, I normally have a bit more flavor hops myself...but I am not advocating that a Maibock be hoppy, but I like a mild floral presence to compliment the malt."
"Overall: A good maibock/helles lager, tasty and substantial. Worth a try."
"Pours copper in color with an off-white head. Malty aroma with a hop spiciness to it. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and crisp. Sweet bready maltiness starts things off. The middle has a pleasant hoppiness to it that combines with a slight fruitiness. The finish is mildly dry with some alcohol detected toward the back. Overall all this was a really solid example of the maibock style offered from Hofbräu."
"I have yet to be blown away by a beer from Staatliches Hofbrauhaus (their helles lager and their hefe are decent). I'm sure I'd feel differently if I was able to experience it fresh from the tap in Munchen... ""I'd like to be seated in the beer garden please, it's such a nice day""... but the bottled product doesn't meet my expectations. This is still a worthwhile purchase if you love the style."
"Drinkability: Very nice tasting beer but a tad bit heavy. Not a session beer but definitely worth trying."
"I visited Germany several years ago during the Summer and stopped by the Hofbrau in Munich, but this beer was not on tap. However, I also visted the Chinesischer Turm which also had Hofbrau beers on tap. What really surprised me is that the CT had (this?) Hofbrau bock beer on tap! In my broken German I asked if the bock beer was the Maibock. The server told me it was pretty much the same beer as the Maibock. Accordingly, I will go ahead and review this beer as the Maibock. This brew was incredible! It had all of the ""German maltiness"" you would expect in a German bock beer. It was soooo drinkable, it was crazy. I long for this beer back in the states, but I doubt we'll ever get the real thing."
"Drinkability: A very tasty Maibock with a great play on the taste buds, exellent balance and multideminsional flavor."
"This is a good beer, pure and simple. Poured this from a bottle into a conical pint glass. The appearance is a nice amber color. My only gripe here is that it's hard to get a good head on the beer, although that didn't detract a lot from my rating. Smells ranged from fruity to floral, which matched the ""spring"" characteristics this beer is supposed to have. And they're right, this beer fits right in for drinking in May - I had this relaxing on a late spring day in hot Florida, and it really hit the spot. The real draw here is the taste, which was really good in my opinion. Some people have likened the taste to warm bread, which I tend to disagree with, although I guess I can see where they get it from. There is some bread in the taste, but it was a bit sweeter than I expected. It hits your mouth with an interesting richness and just slides down your throat, leaving a nice sweet aftertaste. The beer is incredibly drinkable, but the alcohol content will slow you down a bit. I had 3 in one sitting, and was really feeling it after, but in a really good way... I'll recommend this beer for anyone looking to unwind after a long hot day, but I'm not sure I'll pick it up again anytime soon, especially out of season."
"dangerously drinkable. balanced very well and alcohol is well hidden."
"2nd Edit: Don't know if the keg from Resi's was different somehow, but 2 tap samples i've tried since then haven't been the same (possibly going downhill with age). More flat and bready, not much apple or fruity notes at all. Oh well...May is over afterall, better luck next year!"
"A nice clear amber beneath a smallish white head. Nothing remarkable. Not worth the high dollar import fee  around $10 a sixer for me."
"I do love this time of year. Appearance was a nice caramel color with a creamy head which quickly turned to nice lace. The smell was a little sweet but not distracting. The mouthfeel had a nice, lightness but with substance. It's great to drink a Mai Bock that tastes like a Mai Bock should."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pilsner glass. The beer pours a deep copper, forming a creamy 1/2 inch head. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is very skunky, with a little bit of malt coming through. The taste is a little better. Light sweet malt flavoring, a hint of citrusy hops, alcohol, but overall, an uneasy wheaty taste. Its hard to describe, but this tastes like all the other beers that I've had that have come in green bottles. If its green, it always seems to have a very skunky smell and taste. Maybe I'm just not used to the styles, but they just dont do it for me."
"Pours a copper/amber color with a small fizzy white head. The aroma is sweet malt and a touch of caramel. The taste starts out smooth with some malt and finishes with a long slightly bitter hoppiness. Light-medium body with a good dose of prickly carbonation on the tongue. Overall, this is a slightly better than average brew that did not blow me away."
"poured a pale amber with a thin white head a slight smell of malt and hops. The head failed quickly all the remained is a thin white ring around the glass. Malty on the nose the finish is hoppy with a little buscuit. Very nice replication of the style except for the carbonation. good but not outstanding. very drinkable"
"Poured with a light tan head and some lace. Most of head faded. So did lace. Lovely clear copper color. Light, malty aroma with some esters. Taste was surprisingly dry and a bit roasty with plenty of malt and a bit of acid from its full carbonation. A bit over carbonated for me. A tad boozy too. Nice body. Drinkable, but maybe too drinkable due to strength. Nice finish."
"Appearance was a sparkling mahogany brown in a dimpled mug with good head formation. Aroma and flavor were both quite sweet. Mouthfeel was slightly sticky. This beer was rather drinkable."
"Foamy and a beige body. Malty and some hoppy aroma. Easy drinking, a light bitter well malted. Understated carbonation though present. A good example of the style, and while good does not blow me away. Picked up at Eagle Provisions. Better than average a bit."
"It's nice going down and I think I'll have another."
"This is a nice maibock - will get more of this in the Spring. Tasty, though gets to be too sweet after a while. A classic maibock."
"D - Give me more! This could become a regular in the fridge! Come spring I'll be buying more of this wonderful stuff."
"Medium to full bodied, not super exciting, but fairly drinkable."
"Pours a slightly hazed honey color with a thin head that fizzles out, leaving tiny blotches of lacing. Smell is malty, bready, and nutty, with hints of sulphur. Mild hop presence. Taste tons of bready, sweet malts with dried fruits and floral hops. Some roasty and toasty flavors linger on as well. Alcohol is not even detectable. Clean and not cloying considering its sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty ideal: sturdy, not too viscous, and with sufficient carbonation that pricks lightly but doesn't overwhelm. Highly drinkable."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber/copper color with a sizeable head that dissipates fairly quickly. Nose is odd, to me almost musty to non-existent. Nice malty start with a hoppy ending, but well balanced. Medium to full bodied, it goes down smooth enough, but for my taste - I'd rather have a Dead Guy."
"Decent off-yellow hue, 1/2 inch white bubbly head, maintains it's presence throughout. Caramel everything on the nose; also some notes of green apple and Saaz hops. A rather impressive front. Toasty and oily malts; some charcoal notes come through as well (?). Large carbonation and a near rib-sticking affect. The body rounds off nicely; the aformentioned Saaz hops turn sweet and aromatic. Kisses of alcohol are noted near the end with sweet bready-like malt offerings. Clearly one of the best maibocks out there."
"Drinkability/notes: A well-crafted example of the style."
"Nice burnt amber color with a creamy head atop. Smell is a touch too spicy and acidic but the deep caramel intenseness and fruity esters make up for it. Taste is similar. Just a great fresh off the tap maltiness. Sweet but the yeasty flavors add a dry fruityness. Finish gets a touch too alcohol spicy, but it helped me restrain from drinking this too fast and not enjoying it completely. Mouthfeel is the best I've ever had for a Maibock. Big, robust, full yet creamy. Sweetness and spice with a dry overall feel. I could see this losing a lot when translated to the bottle. Try to get it on tap."
"Taste- Pretty clean malt palate. The color and the flavor make me think about ambrosia for some reason. A medium bodied amber malt with equally medium sugar. Makes me think of a lightly glazed carrot."
"Drinks okay, just not complex enough to get excited about"
"Comments: I liked this marzen better than others I've had. Nicely balances between solid malt profile & slight hop finish. Clean, crisp feeling makes this very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, somewhat cloying. It reduces the drinkability a bit but it is what I expect from a maibock and it is a nice rich delicious beer. Definitely buying more, and soon."
"Poured an orange-rust color with an inch-thick off-white colored head. The surface was laiden with different sized bubbles. Aromas of honey, alcohol, and ripe fruit. The taste was sweet with strong fruit undertones. A bitter finish with a creamy and refreshing texture. A bit too dry and overly sweet as I neared the bottom of my glass. Overall, this is a flavorful beer with hints of spice and fruit surrounding a sweet, alcohol-enriched core."
"From what I have read it pretty much defines a maibock but I prefer a hoppier beer."
"It's quality and I enjoy it!"
"Zum Wohl! MK"
"Well done."
"Musings: A nice Maibock indeed. Different approach than others with the over the top malt character - but it still tends to be highly drinkable."
"An interesting, but not totally satisfying example of the style."
"Medium light body with a light carbonation effect of foaming the beer in the mouth, letting it release its bouquet of flavors easily. Moderately dry finish, crisp and full on the palate. This comes across, to me, as a lighter (but still malty) and hoppier doppelbock, a good transition from the doppels I was drinking earlier in spring to the warmer weather beers I'll be drinking shortly."
"Medium body, with some alcohol and low carbonation give a smooth, watery mouthfeel. Easy to drink, nice malt flavor, it's worth a try."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: An unimpressed Benjie left the brew on it's own. Peaches was intrigued with the odd complexity, and happily comsumed her and her brother's portion."
"Drinkabilty - this goes done with some difficulty for me, and I would avoid this."
"This beer poured a bright, clear copper color with a fluffy off-white head. The head didnt last all that long, but there was a nice display of champagne bubbles rising to renew it. The nose is dominated by caramel malt. Light notes of toffee come across in the middle of the nose. The finish has just a little citrus and floral hop. The flavor is again dominated by malt. Caramel, toffee, and figs abound throughout the entire flavor, but the hops show through. More of just a mild bitterness than anything else although there is just a bit of mild floral hops. Nice smooth mouth feel. Extremely drinkable beer."
"Poured an a very light orange/copper color. Almost bordering on gold. Very thick, fluffy white head. Clarity was exceptional - I have not seen a beer this clear. Smell had some mild floral aroma. Taste had some slight bitterness to it. Taste reminded me of Genesee, but in a good way. That is not a bust on this beer but a complement. I think it has something to do with the carbonation. Had a medium body feel and some dryness. Drinkability was pretty good, but not great. Overall a very good beer that I would recommend."
"Half liter bottle. Pours a soid ambered dark tea brown color . A finger of off-white head falls to a healthy coat over top. Clarity is excellent and a moderate cascade of bubbles keeps the head maintained. Nose is nicely rounded with melanoidan toastyness with very light hints of raisin and a very light butteryness. Flavor is definately more raisiney than the nose. Toasty notes are there, but hidden well behind the raisin. There is almost a bit to the fruityness that takes a little away from this one. There is also a touch of metallic on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the light end of moderate with a light carbonation that matches well. This is an okay beer. I think it is a little too fruity and not enouth of the toastyness. Fruityness is more in line with one of the bigger members of the bock family. That being said, its tasty and is worth a look. Enjoyable spring brew."
"Drinkability: To me this had session beer written all over it. Light, flavorful, and somewhat cheap. A top notch German beer!"
"I enjoyed this beer for what it was - an authentic representation of perhaps the world's oldest seasonal beer."
"The taste is fantastic! great balance of Munich malt tempered with a slight hop finnish.You could find maibocks with thinner mouthfeel, but...why bother, Hofbrau probably was one of the first breweries to produce maibock, and you'd be hard pressed to find better versions. Which begs the question, why is this the first time I've ever seen it in the US."
"D: 1 Litre... damn!"
"A really good maibock, maybe my favorite. At $0.99 per 0.5L bottle (on sale at Kenny Road Market in Columbus) this beer is a really good value too. I completely recommend it."
"Very malty, then hoppy kickback. This beer has to be what dead guy ale was aiming for, even though this beer is quite different. I feel that the Hofbrau was a little smoother, though has a little more kick, and it is noticeable. But, an excellent brew overall. Meaty body, rich and dark. Nice initial head, fruity esthery malts and an outstanding maibock. I recommend this beer and it is moderately priced."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"This is a wonderful beer, but it would be even better without the alcoholic blast in the middle. More enjoyable as it warms. Not as overwhelming as a dopplebock might be, but quite rich and satisfying. Reccomended"
"Somewhat hard to finish...with no freshness dating I have no idea if I have a bad example or i'm just not privy to this. I will try this again thought as everything else i've had from this brewery has been basically masterful..."
"Overall impression: Even in the time of Oktoberfest, this is a tasty beer. Well balanced and very drinkable."
".5 L. Great deal for about $2. Pours out darkish red with a small head. Sweet, malty aroma. This beer has a slighty nutty malt flavor that I associate with Maibocks. Bitter hops in the finish, combined with a nice spiciness. Full mouthfeel. The alcohol is very noticable. I don't think it's as well hidden as some people think. Pretty good drinkability. This is a pretty interesting beer."
"Looks brightly golden and straw. Active carbonation forms a white head that faded to a trace, but laced nicely. Smells sweet malty. Spiciness and lightly fruity. A bit grainy and yeasty to the nose. Tastes sweeter than expected. Sweet fruits of pears and plumbs arise. Spiciness or coriander and ginger hide behind. Thin, resinous sweetness of honey and powder sugar remain throughout. Firm, consistent body holds mild hop flavor and round mild textures. Finishes clean and slick. Alcohol persists in the aftertaste."
"Pours an amber color with nice bright white foam that settles fairly quickly, leaving a little lacework. There's a light floral aroma punctuated by biscuity malt smell. This beer is smooth and firm bodied. I love how the honeyish malt flavors mingle with the bittering hops towards the finish, which is just slightly tawny, assuring that you are drink a bock beer."
"Clear bright amber-copper color with a nice foamy lasting off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Has a sweet fruity and nutty aroma. Sweet and malty roasty caramel, honey flavors that has a sweet lasting finish, medium body with a slick and smooth mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, very nice."
"Very drinkable Bock beer. Tasty and non-tiring. Flavorful without any soy sauce taste or other defects that can appear in high malt beer styles."
"Overall: A very tasty and exceptionally easy drinking Maibock. I will pick up more of these. Highly Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is relatively light with a fairly good drinkability for the ABV. Nice stab at it."
"Maibock isn't one of my favorite stles, but hey, it's May still, so let's try one. And overall, it's pretty nice."
"Pours a lovely clear amber, little in the way of fizz, a one finger white head that dissipates in about a minute. Nose is very sweet, carmel and honey with ethers, reminds me of Samichlaus. Tast is amazingly complex, all of that sweetness and honey that the aroma promised, well supported by herbal hops and a nice spiciness. Some alcohol is detectable but that's not surprising considering the high abv. The feel is crisp, which is great considering its medium to heavy weight. Finish is long and sweet."
"805"
"Here's a winner. Poured into a flute from a 500 ml bottle. Dark golden yellow, with a foamy off-white head. Big bubbles in the foam with a half-dozen active columns of bubbles. Some lacing after the head dissipates. Nose is mild, slightly malty and bready. This starts off crisp and smooth with some fine malty bubbles on the tongue. Finish has some bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with a full coating of flavors. This goes down smooth and has a lot of interest for the palate. Having a couple of these would make for a nice spring evening."
"This is seriously one of the best Bocks I have ever had. What makes it so exceptional is that it so rich, with such a robust and delicious flavor BUT, at the same time, it is so unbelievably smooth and drinkable! This one is a real treat!!!!"
"Pours a copper color, that is highlighted by brilliant red tints. Head is about 1", with good retention. Smell is slightly grassy, with brown sugar and roasted malts.Flavor is very malty, with a tiny hops finish. Liquor is noticable, but it only adds to the experience of this fine beer. Good mouthfeel and drinkability."
"this beer came in a 16.9oz brown bottle. apearence is a medium amber with a nice rocky head that falls to patchy cloud-like forms. smell is sweet and malty. taste is all malt with an alcohol note. also something slightly bitter and mediciney that is taking away from the experience. alright overall. mouthfeel is slightly heavy and thick which is appealing. drinkabilty is ok if you can get over the medicine/bandaid flavor. not bad but would pass up next time. maybe if i saw it on tap i'd give it another try."
"Drinkability: a very nice Maibock"
"I can only imagine how amazing a beer like this must be when it is on tap in Germany. Unless I read it I would have never known it was 7.20%."
"""Germany's oldest Maibock"" exclaimed the label, so I had t try it. Amber color, slight head. Semi-sweet, no bitterness. Thin, yes thin, but not weak. Pleasant going down but not exciting. I could barely taste the ABV. No noticeable side tastes. A pleasant beer, but not spectacular."
"The first and only time I've seen this particular bier, at Marikka's German Restaurant and Beer Bar, in Lexington, Ky, where it was a perfect compliment to curried wurst and German cucumber salad, following a Kostritzer shwarzbier on tap. Nicely balanced and very tasty Maibock that would be very enjoyable on its own."
"Great bronze colored beer with a wonderful orange glow. The head was fairly creamy and there was a nice amount of carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass. Nice malty and sugary aroma. Without even taking a sip you can tell it is going to be sweet tasting. There is a burnt sugar taste and a pretty dry finish. This is a solid brew that comes in a nice pint-sized bottle."
"Drinking this beer is like smelling fresh earth in the morning and noticing there's a licorice plant hundreds of feet away wafting its aroma to you. Grassy, earthy, almost like a bitter, but with that ""I'm bock"" assertiveness."
"Thanks to the Man from Fargo...Budgood#1."
".5 litre bottle, pours light amber and clear. Crisp nose of fruit, cherry, and popcorn. Clean malty backbone, lots of fruity notes. Malty, bready, moderatly hopped, great mouthfeel, adds to high drinkability. Very pleasant summer quaffer. Toss a few brats on the barbie and enjoy"
"Notes: This is one yummy Maibock, a ton of flavor packed into each sip."
"Big giant thanks to Budgood1 for this top notch Maibock experience.."
"Supposedly, this is a taste of an original style from 1614. Nice!"
"This maibock poured a clear, red-amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was modest but a bit of mild malt aroma could be detected. The taste was very nice: bread, biscuit, slightly sweet malt, with a bit of Munich malt in the middle, and mild hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and malty with medium body and good carbonation. The aftertaste was pleasantly malty. This was a very nice maibock, and made me want to have another."
"Had this on tap at Redbones last night, and it was so tasty, I had two. Medium clear amber when served, no head. Sweet, very pleasant biscuity aroma. Mouthfeel is outstanding: medium to full, with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is slightly sweet form the malt, and you get this nice little hop bite in the finish. Very good, I had two in a row and would get again."
"The transition to the aftertaste is what made this quite a nice brew - the hops are incredibly well balanced and left a fantastic taste lingering in my mouth. The 7.2% ABV was easily noticed, however, taking away from some of the beer's drinkability."
"Classic amber color and a good creamy head that can be coaxed up at a seconds notice. The aroma is as it should be-malt, malt and theraputic more malt-ahhhh Germany, makes me think of the coming of Spring, and spirits happy thoughts into my very being. Creamy and full in the mouth, while not too heavy and not a lightweight, again just as it should be, as a trasitional brew celebrating both Winter and Spring in one big gulp. Flavors are rich, malty, and very clean. The beer finishes long and malty with a tad of bitter. Where is that plate of German grub when you need it!"
"pours out a clear and dark amber colour, with a fine off-white head. the rings of lace are quite sticky and clinging. the aroma is sublime; thick luscious caramel malts, the sweet smelling maltiness almost bordering on maple syrup and brown sugar. the flavour of this maibock supports all the previous sensory delights by providing a sticky sweet malty joyride of caramel and molasses. the alcohol bite melds well into the slight flowery and spicy hop bitterness to provide a nice dryish finish. while ample bodied, the mouthfeel seems a bit thin for some reason...maybe because it's so smooth and creamy and slides down my throat so easily despite the obvious ABV. this is a well crafted brew and incredibly drinkable. as it warms a bit, the flavours really explode on the tastebuds...apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, etc. incredible. a nice treat for the early days of march. a fine, hearty well lagered german masterpiece."
"Hofbrau Maibock; In thick brown half liter bottle. Pours a deep, deep amber. Nice thick head, with plenty of staying power. Very clear. Woo wee, damn this is a tasty brew. Very sweet and malty, plenty of (almost molasses) flavors right from the first sip, with nice bready malt tastes as well. This beer has an impressive smooth mouthfeel, almost like a barleywine. It does have a bit of an alcohol bite, which is not unpleasant at all. Very nice. Thank the lord for Spring!"
"Appearance: Crystal clear amber hue with a nice sized cream colored head leaves specks of lacing. Aroma: Caramel tinge to it with herbal clove like hop profile nice sweet bready tone. Taste: Clean tasting with a caramel sweet malt profile and bitey hope profile classic maibock in my opinion. Mouthfeel: My one complaint is the body is a bit thin, leaves me wanting more texture carbonation is solid though. Drinkability: A definite treat for any fans of the maibock style solid, but next time I hope to try this on tap from a biergarten in Munich."
"Not a bad beer, but I wonder if I have a slightly older bottle."
"F"
"This bottle reads ""Product of Germany"" but it is in English so I assume this is the beer. Pours a brownish-amber color with a medium light beige head. Fair lacing. Aroma of lightly roasted malt. Light to medium-bodied and rather smooth, it has a tart flavor with a strong malt backbone. The finish is a toasty and hoppy. Overall an easy-drinking beer but an average one."
"This is a good looking amber brew with a nice off-white head that lingers well and laces with some gusto. The nose is of light hops and bready roasted malt. The feel is mediut-bodied and give a nice creamy sense to the palate. Tangy hop notes linger in the finish. This a very flavorful Maibock that is a bit too alcoholic to be greatly drinkable."
"This beer has a small initial head that is off-white in color with good lacing. The body is a clear amber color. It initially tasted light then built to a small bitterness, something I don't particularly like in my beers. But then I am spoiled by Andechs! Im Himmel gibt es Keine bier darum trinken vir es hier! (In heaven there is no beer that is why we drink it here!)"
"At 7.2%, I don't know how many liters you can expect to salt away. I stopped at one and made a note to myself to try the Dunkel while I could still write. I tried it, but the taste buds were too dulled out to make it worth reviewing. Guess I'll be doing the Dunkel first next time!"
"The color of pennies with the reddish glow of maple syrup in the light. Thin head dissipates quickly but leaves some bubbling and lace around the edges of the glass. A very earthy aroma of bread, weeds, and natural sweetness -- musty. The taste is largely the same with the malt flavor heavy and obvious, especially up front. The end is just a tiny bit of hops with a moist bread flavor. Straightforward malty and simple but deliciously so."
"This beautiful beer fills my .5L Munich Pils glass perfectly! Deep amber color sparkles like a fine gemstone. It's topped by a cream colored rocky head that shows great staying power. Nice lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is very clean, with a touch of sweetness and a crisp grassy hop note. The taste is crisp, with a roasted caramel flavor that is quickly replaced by a smotthly assertive hop prescence, only to reappear just before the finish. The finish reveals a good bitterness, with just a touch of the roasted flavor intermingling with the hops on the aftertaste. A faint alcohol note is also present. The mouthfeel is solid, peppered with lively carbonation. The drinkability is very good. I feel like I robbed the store I bought this from, because at $1.79 a bottle, this is a great bargain. Should have bought much more of this."
"Brilliant copper with swelling head that disappears. Leathery aroma with tantalizing spices and earthiness. A creamy malt delight, quite sweet and biscuity but a dynamite dryness enters midway and follows through. Lingering wetness and caramel flavors. The hop spiciness is just right, hints of grass, mint, pepper, and a raw earthy quality that combines perfectly with the toffee sweetness from the malts. Huge alcohol content is invisible. I am getting all kinds of hidden flavors here, I suspect my mind is recalling previous tastes; I have to thank this beer for being so evocative. This is a pleasurable, lighter alternative to a doppel, may even be a neat substitute for your basic bitter or pale ale. I got this for a really low price which I thought was the cashier's mistake; after reading one of the reviews below, I will have to go back and double check. Either way I will buy more of this. Only the 2nd genuine German maibock I have had (after Einbeck)."
"Clear amber pour with a floor of bigger-than-usual bubbles that slowly work their way to the thick, off-white head. Active carbonation persists. Sweet, malty notes and breadiness dominate the nose. Malty taste and medium body at the onset. Dries to a warm, spicy finish. A nicely balanced, drinkable bock; worth a return trip."
"It's brilliant clear copper in color with a very large but quickly shrinking fluffy head. A pleasant malty aroma greets along with a touch of alcohol. Sweet maltiness is prevalent and enjoyable in this medium bodied brew. A spicy hop kick comes through in the finish and is masked by the alcohol, leaving the impression of strong maltiness and alcohol. I enjoyed it very much, and with the wonderful single bottle selection I have in Chicago, I will be buying this again at the very cheap price it goes for....definitely a seeker."
"One of my favorite mai-bocks,poures a nice reddish/copper color with great blooming head.Nice malty aroma and nutty flavor and somewhat spicey.Alcohol is prevelant but not overpowering,great spring time beer,I get this when ever I can find it,wich is not often enough."
"Edit: Wow, thought it was lower ABV than it was. Talk about well hidden!"
"Pours an amber hue with a thick ivory colored head. The head disappates to a thin layer leaving a thick clinging lace. Deep roasted malts on the nose with hints of mollasses and honey. Sweet maltiness on the tounge as well. Slight nice bitterness on the finish. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"Very, very tasty.   One of the better Maibocks I've had."
"I am really not a fan of Mai Bocks, so I ventured into this knowing it would not be my favorite.  Very sweet, with a tang, that sort of threw me off.  Fruity and smooth.  Yet, the overall pciture wasn't too bad; I really enjoyed it.  I just cannot imagine myself drinking more of them."
"Mild, slightly floral hops up front, which was fairly sweet. Finished on the slightly bitter-sweet side.  Another easy-drinking offering from this brewpub, and a nice accompanyment with dinner."
