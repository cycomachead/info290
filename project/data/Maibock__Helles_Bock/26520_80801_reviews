"Very nice beer. Slightly cloudy when poured. Amazing nose with bready German malt qualities. True to type and could be a clone of a great German helles bock."
"Poured into a half liter stein a clear lighter golden with a thinner than expected white head atop.Caramel and toast in the nose with a faint smattering of spicy hops.A little lighter in the feel than most of the style I have come across.Tastes of caramel and German malts with a decent shot of drying sharp hops in the finish.Pretty dry for the style but lacks something to put over the top."

"Taste is lightly sweet to start, balanced through the middle, lightly prickly, moderately bitter to the close. Smooth mouthfeel, and drinkability is awesome. Pretty close to what I would expect from a rep of the style in its original land."

"Pure bourbon nose. Strong whiskey flavor like a barley wine."

"Overall certainly a great representation of the style. A nice malt profile that doesnt overpower and a hop compliment. Can always trust Jacks Abby to brew up a good lager."

"The taste is great- lover the way the malt and hop flavors express themselves and unfold simultaneously with subtle peppery taste from the yeast with gentle alcohol giving a nice amount of balance to the flavor w/ mild malt sweetness adding to the complexity and toasted pilsner malt character with mild breadiness and light floral hop accents adding to the taste. Overall a very good and traditional take- practically flawless with excellent drinkability. I really enjoy this interpretation of the style: wonderful."
"MORE!"
"O. Just Ok. Wouldn't seek it out, but then perhaps this just isn't my style."

"O - Insanely drinkable. I could easily put down a growler of this and it reminded me a little of the Sunny Ridge pilsner that I had recently. Highly recommended, but if you want something comparable in flavor grab a growler of the pilsner. These were only available in bottles at the time of purchase."

"If I hadn't read the label I would say it was a pilsner. Looks, smells, and even tastes like one. Can really smell and taste the sweet malt grain. Smells a little adjunct like- close to a Miller Lite. Taste a lot better than the aroma. A little tart with a slightly hoppy bitter finish. Crisp, very easy drinker. Good solid lager throughout."

"Another winner from Jack's Abby, this one shows some nice restraint."

"Well I just found another Jacks Abbey beer that I will have to stock up on. Eminently quaffable. Great taste, need to fill me up some more of this beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, golden coloring with a filmy, bright white, clingy head. Aromas of fruit sweetness, roasted notes, and wine-like characteristics. The sweetness does have a grape quality to it. Flavors of toasted grains on the forward tongue, with floral highlights and a subtle fruit sweetness. Tangy sweetness slowly builds as you drink. Smooth, mid-bodied brew that is pretty easy to drink. The aftertaste is roasted, and starts to develop a grassy, floral hops character. Smooth, clean finish. Tasty brew."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style. This is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Pours a fairly clear deep golden color with a decent sized creamy white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of sweet bready malty with hint of spice and fruit with a light spicy earthy hop aroma to round it all out. The flavor holds a creamy bready malty taste with lots of spicy earthy hops to balance it out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. Another great brew from Jack's, but not one I would seek out again."

"This brewery can do no wrong and I can't wait to try more of their offerings."
""
"Anyhow, this is every goddamn thing I look for in a Helles. It tastes like light. There are dandelion bits floating in it. Dry, sweet barleycorn mixed with weedy yellow hops and all kinds of weird verdant nodes so--to exhaust a descriptor I've been using dumbly for almost a decade--it tastes like a walk through a field at sunset. It's not quite as out-there pollen-y as New Glarus' dead, gorgeous Zwickle, but it's easily one of the very best American-made examples of its style that I've ever had."

"Overall: I wasn't sure at first because of the aroma's subtlety, but this beer is quite delicious and really grew on me. Recommended."
"Notes: Another tasty Lager from Jack's Abby very true to the style and very drinkable. Cheers."
"Overall, this took some patience. First impression was not the one to go by - grew on me as I drank it. Interesting how the flavor profile works - bitter spike that cascades down slowly to be replaced by the sweetness and grape-like flavors."
"This beer reminds me of a German import. Very tasty and a good example of the style."
"O: Not quite as polished as the truly great examples of the style, but certainly a worthy attempt."

"Mildly sweet with a creamy touch. The finish has some hop appear as a spice. The aftertaste features more lactose taste. The body is surprisingly rich; the carbonation muted. A superbly refreshing beer that reminds me more of a Kölsch than a Maibock."
"500ml bottle served in a pilsener glass. Pours a translucent gold with a 2.5 inch, rocky, bright white head that collapses into a solid 1/8th inch cap. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution. Nose expresses grains and a hint of grapes. Taste reveals light malts, some fruity esters, sour mash, a strong noble hops presence and a light, lingering skunky quality at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a slight oiliness and an even carbonation that falls just short of lively. Overall, not my favorite offering from these guys - hops are too forward and fruit is too much in the background, in my opinion, for the style."
""
"Overall - Clean and flavorful, but it's a maibock, so it's really never going to be that interesting."

"Overall, this is very nice beer, and excellent summer fare, the lightness and crispness of the fruits mixing well with the breads and citrusy notes. The aftertaste is a bit heavy on grape and grapefruit, the tartness a bit unexpected and clashing with the main mouthful, but this is easily fixed with another sip."

"Wonderful beer. It's important to use good glassware to appreciate this style: a stein enhances the flavor and brings the best quality of the beer. Serve colder: 45F."

"O/D-Didn't expect to love this due to the style. Yet, I will try any and all things from my favorite MA brewery. Obviously well crafted but not my suit."

"Overall: A nice sessionable lager thatis great for the price. I have had better maibocks and better from Jack's Abbey but I would look for this one again"
""
""
"O Another nice lager put out by Jack's Abby. Perfect drink for spring/late summer."
""
"Update: drank another bottle dated 4/10/13 on 5/7/13 and it's just as good as I remember! Fantastic German lager flavor, super fresh, and crisp and clean as expected. Top notch for the style, especially from an American brewer."
""
"In terms of flavor profile, this beer should be highly accessible to anyone. Is delicious and simple. Above average lager. Proud that its brewed here in Massachusetts."
""
"Dry for the style, & I love it. :D"
""
"Fads in beer brewing are easy to spot: three years ago everyone began selling overloaded, over-hyped, over-hopped beer; two years ago everyone was screaming about beer in cans; last year began the sticky march of fruity beer; this year it appears that lagers are the target. I like a really good lager, especially a nice clean maibock, but I'm not sure this one qualifies as ""really good."" It's decent but it seems like it's trying to be an ale: the body, aroma and taste are all very dense; it's rather flatly carbonated and has a yeasty, bready, doughy grip that just doesn't have much of a lager lean to it. Thinning it out a bit and jettisoning some of that yeasty freight would make it much more attractive."
"Flavorful and unique, has a great hop and yeasty mix. Liking this brewery more and more by the brew, good local lagers."

"M: Light to medium."
"Mouthfeel is also fantastic- medium light body with moderate carbonation. This one's a keeper. Nothing to say but good things about Jack's Abby."

"Pours a hazy golden color with a small airy head. Very effervescent. Nose is quite sweet and filled with honey notes, biscuits, pancakes w/syrup. Palate is full and thick with a heavy coating on the tongue. Flavors of light grape skins, honey, grassy hops."

"O: A simple yet tasty and very drinkable brew. It pretty much craps on every other maibock I've tried before (included dead guy ale). That's saying something."
"This is slowly becoming one of my favorite local breweries."
"Overall not their best, seems a bit of a mess and they weren't sure where to go with it, booze and bitterness seem more than they should be, lager isn't bad but malts go a bit in the wrong direction, but all things considered still a pretty decent beer."
""
"JA is an all lager brewery, and for the most part they've been brewing a lot of EXTREME beers that just happen to be made with lager yeast, this however.... is as traditional a German lager as it gets. I'd say it's like their Jabby Brau, but it's not, it's so much closer to the traditional pure German Maibock/Helles style. If I didn't know better I'd say I was sitting in Germany drinking a fresh brau in a liter stine or something. Just a solid, solid, Maibock."
