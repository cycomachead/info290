3.16,-19.8,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color helles with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of solid floral malt notes with light sugar notes and some light buttery notes. Taste is also a mix between some floral malt with quite sweet malt backbone with light buttery notes which are more or less pleasant. Body is full with somewhat of an oily texture with good carbonation. Interesting and easily drinkable though not sure such alcohol level is required and the buttery notes are a bit strong for my taste buds.","Phyl21ca","Jun 10, 2012"

3.98,1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Thanks to Thirstybird for the opportunity to try this one. 500ml bottle served at 49 degrees in a pilsener glass. 02 05 12 indicated on the back label (I'm assuming this is a consume before date). Pours a translucent yellow-gold with a creamy, one inch bright white head. Tiny bubbles present in-solution effervesce to the underside of the cap. Head eventually disperses into a semi-conisstent skim - some spots of lacing, but no legs. Nose expresses fruity esters, a light grassiness and the merest suggestion of yeast. Taste follows nose - flavor profile is not at all cloying like some Maibocks in my experience. There's a really pleasant balance in the malt profile, light fruitiness and a crisp, unassuming hops character. Mouthfeel is light in body with an even and consistent carbonation and a kiss of acidity at the finish to cleanse the palate. Overall, a really solid brew - perhaps a little past its prime; perhaps not. That said, very pleasant and balanced without asserting itself too much. I'd love to try this beer on-draft.","Jwale73","Mar 01, 2012"

3.87,-1.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a good beer that doesn't quite fit into any style category. I think the closest match is a modern, Munich style Oktoberfestbier, although it is a little too strong.

A bit of a light head around the edges. Nose is some mild grain with a bit of light fruit and cream. Flavor is slight grain and some very mild brown. A tiny bit of toffee. Light feel with low to medium carbonation. Drinks pretty well, especially considering the 6.9% ABV.","Thorpe429","Oct 20, 2010"

The beer tastes fresh and clean. The flavors are very well-balanced. There is an underlying sweetness present in the aroma as well as throughout the taste, though it is well done and certainly not of the cloying nature. This is a very tasty beer and a solid example of the style. If you enjoy German lagers, Klosterbrauerei Andechs brews some of the best around.","Huhzubendah","Beers"

4.18,6.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor is most excellent. It's a helles bier with balls, basically. A fuller mouthfeel, thanks to the higher amount of malts, and an elevated hop bitterness make this one a keeper for me. It's a great beer to have when you want something stronger and more satisfying than a pils, but not something too heavy, such as doppelbock or stout. That said, this stuff is still pretty malt-forward and doughy.Touch of alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel has fine, medium carbonation. Very tasty.","dasenebler","Apr 09, 2008"
3.85,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear gold with a white head of large bubbles. The aroma reminds me of their doppelbock for the smokey character. Other than the smoke, the aroma is a bit subdued with an odd peppermint-like note in the background of the slightly fruity malts. The flavor has a sweet applesauce ester character of the lightly toasted malts. The aftertaste has a pepery hop bite, but nothing too big or bad. I may have had better maibocks, but this one is certainly different and interesting.","tempest","Apr 05, 2008"

The smell was malty and sweet, and the flavor followed suit. There was a thickness to the mouthfeel which was unexpected, leaving the sweet wort flavors coated on the tongue. Easily drinkable, you cannot tell it's almost 7%. Excellent beer, and highly recommended.","TurdFurgison","Dec 06, 2006"
3.85,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is very malty with a good bitter and some liquorice. It is all very clean and relies more on the big maltiness and bitter. The light caramalt gives an aftertaste of vanilla and honey. Mouthfeel is very smooth.","Absumaster","Oct 08, 2006"
3.77,-4.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D- drinkable enough, but not sure if i really like the idea of helles bock, id rather go the full hog and drink a doppelbock, or the other way and have a munich helles lager. Will need to drink more helles bock, as not overly familiar with the style. Also this bottle im suspecting may be stale for some reason, will need to get another to compare.

3.68,-6.6,4,3.5,4,4,3,"M&D: overall the body is mellow and soothing, while the soft carbonation makes a perfect mouthfeel for one to fully enjoy this high-gravity beer easily. But, since this is only my second time to try this beer style (the first being Rogue Dead Guy Ale that is way too hoppy by German standards, I believe), it's beyond my ability to appreciate its ""greatness", if there's any. To me, it's a rather simple, deeply grainy lager crying for hops to salvage its biased performance. Perhaps it's meant to be like that, and the beer as it is is still well-crafted, evinced by the overall balance and mellow body shown in my glass and on my tongue. But still it's not my cup of tea--or is the under-performance to do with the expiry issue? I'll never know.","wl0307","Jan 16, 2006"

4.63,17.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,".5 litre bottle dated 10/03/03 - probably just over a month old. Brought back from a trip to Germany. Very fresh. Pours a brilliantly clear - almost glowing - golden body topped by a frothy bright white head that holds extremely well. Averaged size bubbles slowly stream to the surface completing the picture perfect appearance. The aroma of clean, sweet malt and mellow grassy hops greets you as the beer is poured. It's full bodied with a moderate carbonation that gives it a mouthfeel that's almost chewy, quite creamy, and rather smooth - definitely adding to the drinkability in such a big, sweetish beer. The flavor is outstandingly rich with clean, sweet, grainy malt (offering no defects whatsoever), and infused with softly grassy hop flavors. The bitterness is limited to simply balancing the sweet malt, but the hop flavors are surprisingly bright (which may have do do with this samples freshness). The alcohol is extremely well hidden, and only becomes remotely apparent in the taste somewhere past the middle of the serving - although you can feel it a little bit before that. The sweet maltiness never becomes cloying, and I'm guessing that in addition to the supportive bitterness, the high level of alcohol helps with that. A very rich but easy to drink beer that's extremely well brewed. A perfect example of the style.","NeroFiddled","0"
