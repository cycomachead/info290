"D:  Light and refreshing.  Easily drinkable.  Nice spring brew.  Decent complexity, especially for style."

"Glad I had a chance to try a beer from this brewer which I doubt I will see for a long time if ever.  Would love to try more."

"Poured from a cork and cage into a weisse vase, the beer is a bright, vibrant maize gold coloring with a ton of carbonation throughout the body. A ton of carbonation, in a furious flow up the glass, constantly feeding a bubbly, white head that doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of toasted grains, subtle hints of honey and caramel, floral highlights, and a subtle hops bitterness. Flavors are tangy sweet forward, almost sugary to start, with a rich honey and extremely bitter vegetal/grassy blend, which lays on top of a bready and heavy backbone. You get layers more along the Belgian line, with heavy banana and a blend of clove and nutmeg spicing. This is a big beer, despite the lower ABV and abundance of carbonation. The aftertaste is more of the richly sweet and heavy fruit and bread notes, leading into a smooth, crisp, clean finish. This is a tasty beer. Give the carbonation time to settle out and you will see the drinkability increase greatly, as well as the layers of flavor develop for you."

"Reminiscent of the lager you might have had with your dad back in the day but 10 times better, tastier and more complex. A great example of how good a lager beer can be. It kinda reconciled me with the style. I wish i would see more local craft brewers do good lagers like this. This is a perfect intro beer for people new to craft beer and will please beer connoisseur aswell. I will buy again. Highly recommanded. 8.3/10 (overall) - 9.5/10 (lager)"

"Clear yellow in appearance.  One finger of head with good retention. Some mild noble hop aroma coupled with honey like malt grace the nose. Sweet on the palate. Once again honey comes to mind. No real off flavors and pretty clean although alcohol is slightly noticeable. Well crafted quality product."

"Probably would opt for one of their other beers; same if I was looking to try this."

"Part of my north-of-the-border haul, purchased at La Halte A Malt in the picturesque village of L'Assomption, Quebec. Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into Spaten mug. One word: gorgeous! From the head to the aroma, from the color to the taste, a beautiful beer; three fingers of vibrant white mousse; grainy aroma with hop highlights; medium-plus mouthfeel reveals full-bodied flavor;terrific finish leaves me wanting more; even the bottle is a beauty; this one's worth the 300-mile drive alone."
"Decent overall, but doesn't stand out from the pack. Manages its alcohol well, most tasty than boozy. Easy drinking."
"Despite noticeable alcohol this is actually pretty easy drinking for the strength, though I couldn't do more than a bomber."
"As is typical for the style, Les Trois Mousquetaires Maibock is a beer that leaves out all details save for the most practical. While it offers only the bare essentials, these are not only among the finest quality but also apportioned very generously. It's a good thing this brewer has a penchant for German styles because his beers epitomize those traditions masterfully."

"O: This is a great maibock with great flavours."

"O - A fantastic brew, light and refreshing yet surprisingly bold for the style. Flavours are pronounced and are certainly a great way to ring in the spring. Well worth a try and I will snatch up a few extra bottles before they disappear."
""
"Very nice brew for this time of year, like a pale spring morning still clinging to winter's chill. There's sweetness and bitterness working together. Might get another bottle or two."

"Hazy pale yellow body. Large eggshell head, moderate retention, patchy lace. Looks like a weissbier with less foam. Floral and yeasty bread dough aroma, like an amped up pilsner or helles, with a hint of honey. Mildly sweet with doughy and cereal flavours up front, and lemon zest, then a spicy/herbal finish. Moderate bitterness. It drinks like a stronger, more flavourful helles, or even pilsner on the lower side of bitterness. Medium bodied with relatively low carbonation. Rich, substantial mouthfeel, but not heavy or thick. No alcohol heat. Full-flavoured but approachable and very familiar."

"An unobtrusive beer that seems off for the style. Nothing special at all. I was wondering if the bottle was old, but it was undated, alas."
"M -Medium body with a bit of chew and light to moderate carbonation."
"D: Drinkable and would probably buy this again, but not before trying other offerings from this brewer which come more highly recommended. Overall this offerings a bit too focused on the sweet side for me, but nonetheless worth a try."
"I have to say that I was let down by this beer as all the other offerings from these guys were complex and very drinkable. This beer was too boozy and one dimensional plus the nose and taste was a little bit cardboardy which is not good considering the ABV. Mouthfeel was on the thick side and made finishing a bottle tough."
"Pours a nice light blond colour with little to no head to speak of. The nose has a sweet hop to it with a nice malt presence, very balanced nose. The taste is very clean, slightly hoppy, boozy with a long sweet finish. Nice medium mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired. Drinkable but would have to split a 750ml couldn't do it on my own"
"D - Good but not great. Not the greatest offering from these guys. I couldn't handle too much of this stuff so splitting the bottle was a good idea."
"A good beer to bridge the Summer/Winter divide. A bit strong to be thoroughly quenchable but more refreshing than your average big beer."
"Drink - Not one my favourite beers from this brewer; but still worth a try nonetheless. The alcohol is extremely well hidden."
"D - very impressed, a nice mix of light hop and grain/corn flavours, the alcohol is present but not a distraction, a very drinkable 8%"
"The body carries a moderate weight with with an equal, perhaps even light, degree of carbonation. Well balanced and the alcohol, whilst notable, is soft given the abv."
"A very tasty beer. Plenty going on and it isn't over the top."
"Another highly drinkable offering from one of Canada's best breweries. I don't hesitate to buy from these guys anymore - I've had about a dozen of their brews and only one has disappointed. They remind me a little of Great Lakes with their take on the German styles...it would be interesting to do some side-by-sides."
"D: A good drinker."
"750mL corked bottle. Pours a clear golden color, with a foamy white that doesn't last long. Has a Pilsner-like hop aroma, with some alcohol and sweetness. The taste is overly sweet with some honey and earthiness, and very alcoholic. Some light bitterness and lots of alcohol in the aftertaste. I wasn't a fan of this, and was barely able to finish one glass. The harsh alcohol in this ruins it. I usually like Les Trois Mousquetaires, but this is their weakest offering I've tried so far."
"Too bad... this is a promising heller bock...just a tad thin and not enough body and bulk to cover the omni-present boozy taste...almost comes off like those cheap adjunct euro malt liquors...a tad rough and unfinished. Perhaps less sugar, some more malts and toasted wheat will take care of this in a future brewing?"
"Rogue Dead Guy is the only other Maibock I've had. If this is also a Maibock, then I'm not even sure what a Maibock is. I thought I knew, but this has nothing in common with Dead Guy. I'm having trouble finishing this glass, never mind the 750ml bottle (about half the bottle was eventually poured down the drain). How can this same brewery be responsible for the Porter Baltique?? Worst Trois Mousquetaires Serie Signature I've had. Not recommended."
"drinkability is pretty good. the alcohol is a little too present, especially as it warms, but otherwise fairly well balanced. a nice bock."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Some warmth going down but pretty clean. Maybe not very standard but a tasty and drinkable beer."
"This is the second time I've had this beer, and the first time I was very impressed. The first time I had this after the Baltic Porter, so my perception of the booziness was likely dulled. On its own I find this one to suffer a little from trying to be too big for the style."
"D- There's no way I could have another. I find it to be just a bit to sweet and to boozy, it just seems out of balance."
"This was quite the eye-opener after the Dead Guy Ale, the commonality in category a bit hard to see. The alcohol pretty much overwhelms the decent cereal and herbal hoppiness of this offering."
"D: Not that easy to drink. The alcohol is quite present and its big nature doesn't help too."
"you can only get this in the gift pack in Alberta and to be honest I don't really like Maibock but this is a pretty good one"
"Interesting lager, not a light beer, but quite welcome on a Friday night."
