3.44,-5.5,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is medium to medium-light in weight, with medium-low levels of carbonation, enough to just create a mildly fizzy, modestly foamy mouthfeel as this travels across the palate. Finishes dry, as one might expect from the bittering hop and ethanol content of the beer, with modest residual stickiness across the palate. A very pleasant and satisfactory mouthfeel, overall.","falloutsnow","Dec 17, 2012"
3.83,5.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The color was a nice clear golden yellow with a reddish hue. There was very little white foam and not much lace on the side of the glass. The smell had a strong aroma of Saaz hops with a hint of citrus. The taste was of hops, with a citrus bitterness, but also, a citrus sweetness. A little bitter on the palate and aftertaste, but, not overly bitter. Overall, a nice balance for this Maibock.","BeerManDan","Dec 03, 2012"

I get a mild caramel hint of sweetness which rounds out the flavor. It’s honeyed and mellow and exceptionally smooth, with a nice rounded finish.

The aroma has Sweet grainy malt, and a subtle fruity notes. The taste is similar and rich, well-rounded and some nice character. It has strong toasty grain, and somewhat a dry finish. I felt a touch of alcohol right on the finish. I'm surprised this rates so poorly on RateBeer, and Rates pretty decent on BeerAdvocate. Well, I'm with BA on this one....I liked it.","beergod1","Jun 27, 2011"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a semi-clear copper color with a good amount of carbonation for a good head. Scent has some malts standing out giving it that obvious bock smell. The taste is mild with an almost nutty flavor to it. A very long lasting taste that is smooth and hits the taste buds just right. A great beer to go with a sandwitch.","Lemke10","Jun 06, 2011"
3.98,9.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, light amber. Bubbles swirl inside the glass while a thick, off-white head head clings very well. Smell is a sharp-tipped (alcohol), sugary malt. Taste is an explosion of sweet, dark-fruit malts and a lot of pithy bitters. An overload of ingredients in fact, but they balance out nicely. Has a rich, bready body, while the end is hoppily bitter and dry. An alcohol feel is present too. Except for a scad of alcohol burn, everything is good here. All in all, a fine example of a maibock imo, and something well worth picking up for $2.00!","sixerofelixir","Jun 02, 2011"

The label boasts of its award as the "World's Best Lager", while I don't know about all that I will say it's pretty dang good and interesting.

The higher alcohol is masked almost completely which makes it a dangerous beer because you may be tempted to drink it quickly. I'm sad to see all of the hating going on against this beer and Primátor's Doppelbock. This beer was awarded Best Lager in the World 2008 by Beers of the World magazine and I believe it is a very well-made, deserving beer. And at a very low price for a 500ml bottle, I wouldn't complain even if it was half as good as it was.","Gorgoroth","Jan 17, 2011"

3.18,-12.6,3,2.5,3,4,4,"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its mouthfeel. Although the carbonation is perceivably overwhelming, the thicker characteristics and creaminess certainly make up for it. As for flavoring, there was a disproportionate level of sourness which, if curbed, might have let some other flavors shine, while ultimately making the beer stronger in quality.","TheBrewo","Dec 03, 2010"

The overwhelming taste is of sweet fruitiness (kind of a combo of apples, bananas, and peaches) mixed with some caramel. Despite the higher ABV, it's pretty refreshing. I didn't know about this one after the first drink, but it really grew on me. As far as the hops, I didn't get any in the taste. However, there were some flowery hops in the nose.

The flavor begins with a mild pale malt character with some nice grain flavors, then the hops kick into a full hops bitterness that is a bit floral but also quite astringent and surprisingly harsh on the palate.

First taste reminded me a lot of my local gem, Capital Blonde Dopplebock - robust with sweet caramel malts and grassy notes - but sadly picks up some astringent, medicinal, bitter notes that give the tongue a little twitch and detract from the overall drinkability, though the 7% is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is rich and full. This is a solid dopplebock, but I guess I'm spoiled with Capital in town. Worth a try as it's still not a bad light dopplebock.","Golden2wenty1","Nov 07, 2005"

The taste reminded me of caramel candy without quite as much sugar, it has a sharp start and sharp finish, not quite harsh. Hope lingered throughout but I didn't get a strong hoppy feel as other reviews seem to have. I wouldn't call it spicy but there was a slight burning sensation after a while. The carbonation was suffiicient, felt reasonably well in the mouth and was quite drinkable for a heavier beer. It's a beer I'll have again along with their double bock.","packetknife","Feb 07, 2004"
3.65,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Mmm. Went well with my burgers made on toasted rye bread with a little German flair. Not bad. Clear golden color with a small head that fades rapidly. Nothing too exciting or exceptional. Likewise, the aromas are non-descript -- a melding of grassy, subdued malts, understated hops, and mild alcohol sweetness. Similarly flavored with just the most mild fruity character -- perhaps mostly just the alcohol being its normal sweet self. Finishes with a very mild but balancing hop presence. Certainly appropriate for the style, but not exceptional.","marburg","Jan 12, 2004"
