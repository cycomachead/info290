Apparently, this varietal is actually a special seasonal, but couldn't really pick that up from the label nor the taste. This came in a regular variety pack along with the northern lights, red ale and imperial stout. By the time I got to this one I didn't holdout much hope. In addition to the I don't think Maibocks bring much to the table in general. It was surprisingly light, with a sweet finish. The website states that is uses munich malts helping pacify my taste buds into thinking this is a german original. Seemed like a typical lager. Descent beer, best of the mixed case.","Ryanm1","Dec 27, 2012"

The flavor profile is light with notes of bread, a subtle fruity-honey sweetness, a bit of dough, and a slight earthiness. Not much in the way of bitterness. Medium to rich body that coats the mouth.

2.8,-20.5,3,3,2.5,3,3,"12 oz. twist-off longneck with clearly marked freshness date. Brewed with two-row, Munich, pilsner and caramel malts; hopped to 25 IBUs with Hallertau, and fermented with German lager yeast. Pours a nice amber color, fairly clear, with lots of carbonation and an off-white head that reduces to a dense cap and leaves a bit of lacing. Smells malty and toasty, with a few hop notes and yeast artifacts, and some distracting DMS. The flavor follows through, lightly sweet and bitter, with a breath of ethanol and some vegetal tones on top of a dry, highly-carbonated, moreish body. Definitely some off flavors on this one. It's a few months past the best-by date, but it isn't even a year old, and a beer like this should last at least as long fairly intact. However, the sulfury flavors don't necessarily develop during aging so it may have tasted like this from the get-go. I'd pass on this one.","mmmbeer","Jan 09, 2011"

4.3,22.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A helles bock is probably my favorite lager style of beer,and this beer is everything I like in the style.Pours a clear lighter bronze color with a nice lacey,tight white head that settles slowly.Alcohol infused fruit,toasted grain,and a sharp spice comes through in the nose.Really nice flaovrs going on,somewhat sweet up front with some caramel and sweetish alcohol infused white grape flavors,melding into a crisp cracker-like finish.A decent amount of hops are used for the style and it gives it a nice finish.In my opinion easily Starr Hill's best brew,not overly heavy and or sweet,a good warming winter brew.","oberon","Feb 09, 2009"

Nice color with a great beer scent and just right on hops and malt. I would drink it more if it were available in Mississippi. Solid. Golden color, great aroma, and very good taste. Nice beer.","soupermirl","Dec 07, 2008"

3.93,11.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: This beer doesn't try to be anything that it's not, and in so doing succeeds at being precisely what it is and then some. Right up there with the Pale Ale as being my favorite Starr Hill brew, this one's simply a well-crafted, malty, winter brew that I could easily toss back a sixer of around the fire with family or friends. Cheers Starr Hill.","CrellMoset","Beers"
