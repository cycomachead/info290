Nose of light bread, caramel malts, nuts, grains, and sweet malts.  flavors follow the nose with sweet breaded malts notes up front and on the sides, a nutty character blends with light breaded malts as well as a moderate grain flavor.  Lightly sweet aftertaste mixed with a grain note.  Moderate alcohol in the finish.  Smooth and wet, lightly dry on the finish.  A decent bock.","Brutaltruth","Mar 21, 2015"

Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, grape, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and fruity ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, cracker, apple, pear, floral, grass, bread, toast, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, floral, grass, bread, toast, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Good balance of malt, hop, and ester flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Overall this is a very solid maibock. Good balance of all flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, only now things are brighter, more expressive, and a bit heavier on the greens (but not by too much more). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel.

Finish was semi-dry as there was some inherent sweetness in it, but nothing like the nose had led me to expect. Highly drinkable, but be careful.","woodychandler","May 29, 2012"

This brew poured a clear amber color, produced a thick clingy head, featured excellent retention and excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of malted barley and earth. Medium in body, this Maibock featured a malted grain backbone, some notes of caramel, fresh baked bread and sweet malt. Fruity esters from the yeast were also present. Balanced nicely with spicy hops, this is a nice session beer- excellent example of an American Craft version of a german classic. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Apr 06, 2012"

The taste of slightly sweet malts immediately comes in on the first sip. This is balanced with some hop spiciness and bitterness. The flavor is fairly rich, but also very clean. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is very adequate. I picked this up in the Abita Party Pack and I have to say I'm pleased with this effort overall. I would pick this up as a six-pack.

It does drink fairly okay, but needs more malts for the style and abv.

Clean drinking experience with some mineral water adding to the complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but never ways heavy on my palate, excellent quaffable bock from the bayou.

Overall this was a nice clean and crisp beer, with a refreshing flavor and good body. It's a well constructed brew that was quite easy to drink, and was definitely enjoyable.

Aroma is pretty non-descript, with minimal pale malt and hops components, and a bit of fruitiness. Taste is upfront with the malty bitterness, and a sort of "off" fruitiness that kind of wrecks it for me. Aftertaste doesn't do it for me either. Have to appreciate the creamy mouthfeel here, even if I wasn't enamored by the flavors, and drinkability is reasonable if the tastes are your bag, I guess. Had better Maibocks recently, so this has probably jaded me for awhile.","ppoitras","Jun 01, 2005"

2.91,-15.2,3,2,3.5,3.5,2.5,"not too drinkable though- the bitter edge gets annoying after half a bottle's worth is done and there is no overall hop mouthfeel or anything to match.","goodbyeohio","Mar 23, 2005"
3.91,14,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear amber color with a small head that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma has some faint caramel and some apple. Taste is nice for a bock, crisp and clean with hints of caramel, apple, and lightly toasted malts. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a hint of spicyness on the tongue. Extremely drinkable. One of Abita's better ales.","kosmoraios","Mar 15, 2005"
3.6,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Abita Bock is amber-orange in color with decent head. The aroma is invitingly malty, but nothing outstanding. The taste is malty, primarily caramel, not very strong or complex. A slight rawness is a little bit annoying, perhaps it is actually the metallic taste I've be reading about. Nonetheless, I found this enjoyable in the same way I find most other Abita beers enjoyable; as above-average, easy-to-drink beers.","Gagnonsux","Jan 13, 2005"
4.32,25.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"P.S. I have noticed that some people have detected metallic or musty flavors or aromas in the beer and I can only say that I was lucky to get this beer super fresh. There were no off flavors at all and I can only hope that more people will see how great a bock this is when they get to try it fresh. I dont know why everybody keeps talking about a golden color, mine was dark amber, thats weird, maybe they changed the recipe.","etaggie09","Dec 23, 2004"
3.65,6.4,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Clear, gold in color, I was expecting a more vivid color; this is dull even for a Pale Bock. A head of one finger in height topped off the beer. The head retention was fair, after a few moments it faded to a small cap and then a soapy collar, sparse in the middle. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is bland. The nose is sweet and grainy but clean and fruity. Lightly toasty at the back, with a musty undercurrent that reminds me of every Millstream beer. Not a pleasant reminder. The potency is moderate, while I canÂ’t call the bouquet inviting I wouldnÂ’t call it offensive either. The palate is tasty; there is no getting around that. It is much better than the nose indicated. The sweetness is ideal and it is not weak or wavering, rather firm actually. The toastiness is faint but noticeable. There is a bit of spiciness in the middle that is pleasantly coupled with some fruity flavors. There are no distinct fruits, just a nice marmalade. The finish is the home of the hops, light hints of Saaz I think, and just the slightest taste of alcohol. I actually got a little belly warmth out of this beer. Cool. I mean warm. I meanÂ… whatever. The aftertaste is long but clean, something to be expected (or at least desired for the style). Medium/medium-light in body, low carbonation but the mouthfeel is pleasant but ordinary. I havenÂ’t had many Abita beers but this dandy is the best thus far. I would buy a six-pack of this if it were found locally. But it is not. Thanks Morris729 for the bottle!","bditty187","Aug 05, 2004"
2.94,-14.3,4.5,3,3,3.5,2,"Not quite sure what to make of this. It's kinda between a Kolsch in it's carbonation, mouthfeel, and dryness, and kinda like a Helles or Dortmunder otherwise. Either way, it's not very impressive. One is plenty enough for me. Would probably be better ice-cold.","Mitchster","Jul 04, 2004"

3.86,12.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer I would put in the top three of the Abita offerings, behind Turbodog, and their Amber Ale. This beer is an excellent example of the style, has a great malty nose, followed up by a clean malty flavor. I had the priveledge of drinking a couple of pints at the Abita Springs Brewpub and would highly recommend making the trip if you are ever in the New Orleans area.","schoolcb","May 01, 2004"
2.23,-35,2.5,2,2,3,2.5,"Pours with a thick head, but very thin lacing and almost no head retention. Golden color. Heavy carbination, but not too much. Very light aroma, hint of champagne in the scent, and there is an almost sweet champagne taste in there too somewhere. Maybe it is apple juice -sparkling cider? Slight bite in there, light bitterness that is left in your mouth afterwards. Light tasting beer, smooth, would be good for hot days in the sun. Goes down easy. One of the better of the Abita's.","shapudding","Apr 16, 2004"
3.65,6.4,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Abita Bock: a nice tasting MaiBock from Abita, in fact this is probably my favorite Abita beer. Pours a deep golden, with just a hint of red around the edges. Not much head, but what it had was a wee bit sticky. The taste is very nice, rich hearty malty Mai-Bock flavors. Sweet and slightly fruity, with mild tastes of red apples. Very nice, and worth picking up if you see it.","jackndan","Mar 19, 2004"
2.58,-24.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"The beer pours a gold color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is sub-average. It boasts of pale malts and a musty stench. It has a lager yeast aroma as well. The taste is average. It is light with a slight grainy malt flavor. It finishes dry with a musty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little more than average carbonation. It drinks fair. I don't care for this beer. It's one and done for me.","WesWes","Feb 23, 2004"

3.23,-5.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Beer is an appetizing ruby brown. Metallic, old malt, semi-syrupy sweet, with a little bit of bite. The metallic taste really bothers me. The body of the beer is quite thin, but I guess this is a Maibock at the same time, this quality adds to its drink ability.","Starchild","Dec 09, 2003"
3.35,-2.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a light brownish-orange with a thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Light malt aroma. Thin to medium-bodied with a clean malt flavor. Smooth and a little watery though. The finish is a little spicy and malty. Overall not bad, it just felt like there could have been more to this.","Dogbrick","Jun 27, 2003"
2.7,-21.3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"This started out looking pretty good, then faded fast. The nice golden tan head vanished nearly instantly and there was absolutely no lacing. The color was light amber or very dark gold. The initial taste was pure malt, but followed by a decent amount hop bitterness in the back. Along the way there was also light fruit sense. Fairly nice flavoring but points off for the feel which was overly astringent and peppery. Insignificant caramel malt aromas.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 15, 2003"
2.06,-39.9,3.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,"Pours clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head. The smell of an earthy grain and lightly sweet malt with a bit of spicy hops shining through. After first taste, this reminds me of a bolder version of Miller High Life with a sweet corn taste. Adjuncts? IÂ’m not sure about that, but from the taste I wouldnÂ’t be surprised. It also contains a perfumey fake finish that doesnÂ’t settle well. It is a light bodied brew and finishes with a headache. This is not a good brew! So far, so bad with my Abita journey, and this one is the worst! IÂ’m not impressed. This seems to be a brewery that makes shortcuts on their brews IMO. Cheers anyways!","BeerAngel","Apr 09, 2003"
3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a golden orange color with a creamy white head that fades into a good amount of lace, but the head can easily be fully resurrected by swirling the glass. Nose is sweet malts with a touch of stale and musty grains. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts with a bit of fruit and some grassy notes followed by a mildly bitter hop bite. This was a pretty enjoyable brew, but itÂ’s not one I would buy all that often.","Morris729","Mar 20, 2003"
3.85,12.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The smell is toasty nutty with a little bit of fruit. The beer starts sweetish and lagery, giving way to a roasty nutty middle. Quite full-bodied. The finish is German bitter, a little metallic, some alcohol evident. This is quite a surprising beer. Interesting.","kbub6f","Feb 28, 2003"
4,16.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This is one of the better Abita brews. The beer pours quite golden for a Bock. The head is weak and short lived. The nose is also quite weak and only hints at malt. On the inverse - the flavors do not match the nose. There is a very strong malt and hop flavor that stands out in contrast. The flavors are a bit out of balance and the hop finish is quite bitter. This has a medium to light mouthfeel with no unique texture. This is really more like an IPA than a Bock.","AtrumAnimus","Feb 26, 2003"
3.43,0,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The flavor of this beer is fairly good. It is pretty fruity and sweet, like caramel and sweet black cherries. There are not a lot of dark and roasty malts like I would have expected out of a "bock". I had expected a darker beer, but it did not hurt this brew that it was fairly light and light-bodied. It was very easy to drink, but I think if you came accross this during the summer, it would end up being a fine selection to quench the hard hours of labor.","ElGuapo","Feb 16, 2003"
3.21,-6.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"An slightly above-average beer all in all. Abita suggests that it goes well with Mardi Gras... Considering the deceptive alcohol, a few of these would ensure that the drinker either gave or received large volumes of beadsÂ…","TXHops","Feb 07, 2003"
2.85,-16.9,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Golden in color, weak small head, malty, musty aroma, sweet malty caremel flavors, very sweet at first finishes sour, bad aftertaste.I would not wan't to drink more than one, not a very good bock, I don't care for it.","maxpower","Dec 01, 2002"
3.87,12.8,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The nose is a beautiful push of brown sugar and honey. On the palate it briefly offers more of the same before it succumbs to a watery tasting mix of hops, caramel and kids cereal. A nice effort and quite drinkable.","putnam","Oct 13, 2002"
4.19,22.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The body is hazy and orangish-gold in color topped by a frothy white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a decent collar and whispy surface foam. The aroma is quite nice with a slightly fruity and richly malty Munich malt character that's gently toasty and sweetish; backed by some bright, sharp, spicy hops. The body is medium with a very fine, standard level of carbonation that gives it a lightly crisp but smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is as the aroma suggests with a slightly fruity, rich, toasted malt that's supported by an underlying bitterness. It's a "juicy" malt that also has some decent hop flavor present - spicy Saaz and floral Hallertauer. It finishes semi-dry with a lingering sweet maltiness as well as some clear alcohol. Easily, and without question, my favorite beer from Abita! Although this Bock offers some rich malt & hop character, it's not real filling and the alcohol is fairly well-masked making it quite drinkable. Very well done and definitely worth trying. I'd love to get a hold of this fresh, and on tap!","NeroFiddled","Oct 12, 2002"

3.86,12.5,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Notes: A damn nice stab at the Maibock style. A bit one-dimensional if compared to traditional Maibocks, but if not compared, this is a pretty tasty offering. Personally I enjoyed it. Drinkable, flavourful and sturdy.","Todd","Apr 11, 2002"
4.15,21,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Abita's bock shares a slightly astringent tartness that I find in all of their beers.  In the bock, it is well integrated with a mellow maltyness.  Mouthfeel is fairly light, but this is a very drinkable brew, and would go along happily with about any food you want to pair.  Their Turbodog gets the most attention (probably because of the name), but the bock is something of a sleeper from the brewery.","Brent","Mar 16, 2002"
