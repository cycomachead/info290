review_text
"Interesting beer. It pours, smells and tastes a lot lighter than a high gravity 8% ABV doppelbock. In my opinion the style and labeling is misleading, but not necessarily in a bad way. It is still a very enjoyable beer. If I was blind folded and had no preconceived ideas I probably would have rated this beer higher. It was definitely a well crafted beer. I would never turn this beer down, but probably won't go out of my way to buy it again. Only because there are so many other beers to try. This one's not bad at all, but there's not much about it that makes it stand out either."

"I think the reviews are generally too low on this one. It's very smooth, especially for 8%. One of my favorites by Abita."

"-overall  a good beer, smooth and balanced slight malt sweetness, slow onset dry finish, good dopplebock but nothing that stands out."

"From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Clear golden orange with little precipitating carbonation.  Vigorous pour produces nice thick head with sticky lacing and nice clumpy head.  (Less vigorous pour leaves an anemic head with thin collar and scattered cap.)  Nose of sweet malts and vague fruit-like character.  Malt forward in the mouth with lightly tart hoppy finish.  Good in mouth; crispiness belies the lack of apparent carbonation.  Smooth and slightly chewy.  Is this a doppelbock?  Perhaps.  Whatever it is, it's certainly a fine beer though nothing incredible.  Would try again."
""
"It didn't look like a dopplebock, more like a regular Hellas.  Was a tasty beer though."
""
""
""
"Love this beer in the summer"
""
"650ml bottle. Pale gold colour, decent slightly off-white head  which reduced to a ring, traces of lacing. Very gentle aroma, honeydew? Lightly sweet taste. Medium-full body. Smooth, slick texture. Fizzy carbonation and a little alcohol warmth. Not as assertive as your typical Doppelbock but decent enough in its own right. 6."

"Bottle of andygator beer drank"
"Great tasting IPA from my favorite brewery!"
""
""
""
""
"Not the best beer but my personal fav."
""
"Good stuff. Sweet malty profile, without being cloying, heavy, or otherwise unapproachable. A very nice pale version of a doppelbock. A slightly crisp finish in taste, but a medium-heavy body that is fulfilling and rich. not much on the smell, but i never get much nose on lagers anyway. Alcohol completely hidden, and the 25 IBUs balance it nicely. I may want to brew something like this!"

"This was a doppelbock? It looked and tasted like a belgian golden, maybe. Some grape and raisin flavors. Poured a nice deep orange color. Slight alcohol. On tap at Depeaux, the new spot in the Decatur train station. The setting was better than the beer. A little disappointing and definitely not reminiscient of a doppelbock to me."
"It's an interesting brew which may not be traditional to style but is a good beer none the less"
""
""
""
""
"Lite head dissapates in seconds no lacing of note / crisp nondescript nose / great low hops taste crisp and clean / not like traditional doppelbock but what the heck this is a good beer / would recommend to anyone would wants a safe 8.0  - pair with BBQ & get a ride home"
"pours clear golden amber little head, smells malty of slight yeast and bitterness, tastes of bitter yeat and malts, smooth feel and finish."
""
""
"Extremely smooth and drinkable for what it is, a 8% doublebock. Great beer by a great brewery. 4.7"
""
""
"Slight hop with a good malt flavor.  Very drinkable beer."
""
"Overall - super offering by Abita. My fave by them thus far but you can't go wrong with them. They go for a little drinkability in their beers, so they probably won't blow away all the beer snobs. Cheers!"
"A solid beer to sip on. Actually much better when mixed with Abita Turbidog (terminator) or Abita purple haze (barney). Its pretty amazing how well this beer mixes with others."
""
""
""
"Just like Spaten Optimator, but light in color"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When I took my first sip of this I couldn't believe that it was 8.00% ABV. There's one word to describe this beer: smooth. It's one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had. There aren't any flavors that jump out and punch you in palate and I think that's the point."

"Now sold in regular 12oz. bottles, this beer is now served (don't hate it until you've tried it) in mixed form with Abita's Purple Haze and Strawberry beers throughout many bars in Louisiana. Poured correctly from a tap this beer, in combination with either of the others mentioned above, is quite delicious (even smoother with a distinct taste of the fruit that was used, strawberry or raspberry) . Try it for yourself, remember to sip as it's still potent, and post for yourself."
""
""
"Overall:  it doesn't blow me away, but it's a reasonable doppelbock."
""
""
""
"Aroma is yeasty, with a touch of Belgian character to it, green apple, and a metallic note. Hints of peach surface. Flavor reveals an overly sweet caramel malt base, toasted notes, and muted peach and apple skin character. Could use some sharp notes to clean up the flab."
""
""
"I hadn't had an Andygator in at least four, and maybe six years—and it may very well have been the first doppelbock I knowingly tried—but I'm reminded that, despite its ubitquity in stores, it's meant to be a very fine beer, and a nice, clean take on a style that, at first, one might be skeptical could successfully originate from the deep-south swamps."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Smells odd but tastes pretty good, easy drinking, akin to a very strong lager - light and quite intoxicating (be careful!)"
"Sorry, but the aroma and the aftertaste of this brew was not pleasant, so only gets a 3.  Maybe it was an old bottle on a ""pick 6"" .  I just might have to try another one before i cast it aside."
""
"A lighter beer than I thought it would be. Still delicious, and very drinkable."
""
"Had my first at the original Doe's Eat Place in Greenville MS."
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy yellow. Smells like a pilsner. Sure as hell stronger than one though. Malty and a tiny touch of fruit maybe. I guess it is pretty good for a doppelbock."

"Tap at Lazy Dog Macon. Pours transparent orange with white head. Aroa of malts. Tastes of malt, caramel and toffee. Medium-bodied. Not that great."
""
""
""
""
"It felt to me like an Imperial Pilsner with alcohol and malts predominating too much over hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth and creamy medium full bodied beer with just below medium carbonation. Warming."
""
"Overall:  This is a very good beer.  Good, malty and sweet flavors wrapped up in a very smooth, creamy quaff.  Delicious!"

"Great beer!"

"Poured from an ice cold bottle into a glass. It pours a yellow color with some nice carbonation. I gave it an aggressive pour and it had an impressive 2 finger head. It smells fresh and fruity. It has a balanced mouth feel not thin and not thick, balanced and not bitter at all. This might be my first Helles Doppelbock, I'm impressed very nice and with an ABV of 8% it can bite ya. It is smooth and well balanced, hints of fruit and just a slight bitterness I must say. I do believe this is my first Abita beer and I am impressed and will try some more."
""
""
"O: Abita makes some very under appreciated lagers. This is one of my favorites from them. Very technically sound, though perhaps a bit more well-hopped than most of the German doppelbocks I've had. You won't find me complaining though. Maybe its recent GABF medal win will get people to take more notice. If not, more for me I guess."

"An excellent, affordable doppelbock.  I strongly recommend."

"Trying the abita abductors at the Pie Factory in Florance, AL. The beer poured a clear golden with white head that left a lace. The scent was faint with hints of grass and biscuit. The taste was very strong leaning toward grassy peat bread. The m outhfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall the beer didn't hit the mark for me."
""
""
"O -- A surprisingly nice take on the style. Goes to show that breweries can surprise you out of the blue. Anyone who likes German-style beers should try this one."

"My least favorite abita. Had a good aroma. Did not like the thick almost slimy feel. The taste was almost a strong bitter amber , almost that  this brew was crafted just for the strong alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice helles dopplebock from Abita. Pours a thick yellow straw color with a huge rocky head of white, dying down to a thin foam layer with excellent clinging lacing. Smells of fresh apples, pears, and sweet light malts. Excellent mouthfeel, well carbonated, with light caramel and slight bittering hops on the back. Not a lot of dimension, but not bad at all. I would compare it to a lot of the Russian beers, yet smoother and not as abrasive to the novice beer drinker. Also would love to have it side by side to the hop gator which I have had and liked a bit more. This beer at one time to my recollection was a ""barley wine"" by name sold in small Little Kings sized bottles (a bottle style many I know referred to as stop sign smashers). Still, a very nice beer indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After being on a barrage of hopped beer, it's a pleasant change to come back to something sweet and malty. Andygator is one of its many useful cures."

"Sampled this at a tasting and even though it's no dopplebock ended up getting a bottle and it pours a crystal golden hue with a creamy one finger head and lacing here and there,the aroma is very sweet and malty with a subtle background aroma of herbal earthy hops,the feel is medium bodied with soft carbonation and the tastes are pretty much what you smell it's a big malty sweet drop but finishes evened out with a soft bitterness from the herbal earthy hops and overall if your after a true dopplebock it's not for you as it screams more otcoberfest/helles to me but if your after a sessionable malty golden lightly hopped ale with a decent ABV then yeah give it a crack cheers."
""
""
"A very significant pale white head on the initial pour. The initial aroma was surprisingly intense with a sweet, fruity, floral character. It didn't strike me as a typical Helles Doppelbock, but I very much enjoyed this beer. While I am more of an IPA hop-head, this is a nice, light summer beer that I will buy again. After I finished the beer, I noticed it was 8.0% ABV which came as a big surprise. It drank more like a nice 5.0% session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a little too sweet for me, interesting though."
""
""
"O: This does one thing really well: it drinks easier than an 8% beer should. But apart from a mild booze presence, it tastes lighter than an 8% beer should. Even worse, it doesn't seem fully in balance. I'd never refuse one, I just wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"I had heard a lot about this one, and wanted to try it because I love doppelbocks, but this doesn't do anything for me at all...."
""
""
"O-really liked it. Drank a draft out on a river bank before dinner which multiplied my feelings of relaxation and pleasure"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a deep, clear gold with a fizzier white head. The head has good-great retention and leaves some sticky lacing. The aroma is a little undefined, with some slight bready notes and a hint of noble hops. The taste is a close match. It has a nice weight to the body, crisp but not fizzy. If the flavors were a little more robust, this would be a great beer. It's certainly not bad."
"The aftertaste is fresh spring. This is a great example of the style that you should try. Well done, mes ami."
""

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of grassy hops, bready malt and hint of citrus fruit. Body is full and slightly crisp. Taste is of sweet biscuit malt partially balanced by grassy hops and alcohol. Alcohol is noticable. Finish is long, semi-dry. Somewhat sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bomber: This one pours a clear yellow color. There was a bit of a white foamy head on it that leaves some lacing. The aroma is OK. A bit of sweetness to it, with some breadiness. Maybe some faint banana in there. The taste is pretty good. A bit of dryness and no sweetness. A touch thin for an 8% beer. Some malts, a hint of spices. OK, but I expect more in an 8% beer."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is also rather biscuit and bready-like with a clean crisp hop finish. It is 8% ABV but you wouldn't know it."
""
""
""
"O - decent but unspectacular."
""
""
"O - A good get drunk. However, this camp will still rely on Side Pocket for that."
""
""

"Picked this up without knowing anything about it because I needed a 4th to get the 10% bottle discount. Pretty average all around beer, nothing special in appearance, smell, but taste is pretty good but not special. Overall the beer gets bonus points because it is easy to drink for 8% and presents a good value. The more I drank it the more I liked it, probably because of the 8%, but I would buy again."
""
""
""
"A respectable helles doppelbock. Decent balance of malt taste and sweetness with a fairly intense hop bitterness. The 8.0% ABV is noticeable but in a subdued way and doesn't overpower things. Taste and feel may seem a little coarse in some ways, yet it still fits the bill for a heavy-duty lager styled beer with good character."
"Served in a cold mug at the acme oyster house for the first time and it was very good. Nice aroma and taste, and a nice little extra pop. Very surprised at the quality but decided to try at the bar. I will have this brew again in the near future, probably at the same place."
"Interesting, but I wouldn't have one again."
""
""
"For some reason, the bottle says it is a doppelbock, but this site has it listed as a Maibock. So I won't rate this as a doppelbock, because if I did, it would be a poor doppelock- not heavy on the malt and dark to be sure. Overall, it is a great Maibock, actually one of the best I've had. I drank it a bit colder than room temp and it is very fruity and golden in color, just like a tripel. It is a good summer beer with lots of alcohol- beautiful golden color and tasty. Not zay doppel, to be sure"

"Overall, I liked it but didn't love it. I found many of the individual characteristics to be attractive, but the sum total seemed just slightly above average. I'm sure I'll buy Andygator again, as it's a good value, but it won't be a regular."

"Served in a big, frosty litre mug at my local watering hole - The Baltic... my kinda beer, not too hoppy, sweet but not too sweet and enough but not too much aroma to keel you over the next day. ... a huge kick, too.... yummy....If you're in the East Bay and wanna good beer at a reasonable price.... Try The Baltic for happy hour..."

"Andygator, like all good examples of the style, is very lean but very muscular. It doesn't hit a ton of notes but the ones it does are sung loud and held long. Given the naturally understated qualities of helles bocks I'm not surprised it has failed to impress others, but bock lovers will certainly recognize and appreciate its quality, composure, and authenticity. Good job!"
"Overall: I pretty much liked everything about this except the taste. And the ABV really comes out."
""
""
"O - While Abita calls Andygator a helles doppelbock, it's hoppiness and crisp, clean malt profile lean pretty closely to the maibock style or at least a crossover of the two. Sweet and fruity, the bready malt base of this beer make it just as satisfying as the German ""liquid bread"" doppels, though finished with a touch of spicy hop character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was an enjoyable experience. It's very crisp and refreshing. Well crafted. I would enjoy something like this in the summer."
""
""
"Relying on a simple malt driven profile ,this beer is very clean. Bread-like notes akin to crystal malts overwhelm the entirety of this beer, with honey and light piney notes in the background. Overall it’s cheap and pretty easy to drink with a smooth profile."
""
""
""
"After Thought: I guess I would drink this over apple juice..."
""
""
""
""
"O: Sweet smooth and simple. Goes down decently well but a bit too sweet for me to want to drink a lot of."

"Pours out to a thick white head that is creamy and lasting with moderate lacing. Color is golden amber. Aroma is grainy and boozy with a touch of noble hop aroma. There is not much complexity to hide the 8 % abv. Flavor is sweet malt, sweet alcohol and a hint of noble hops. There is an imbalance toward sweet flavors, but for such a high gravity this is expected for the style. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. Overall, this is a boozy, easy-sipping, high falutin' malt liquor with no off flavors or roughness. It does lack complexity but I like it."
"Really like this beer year round. It has a sweetness, with medium body taste, but has an easy drinkability snap. Pairs really well with hearty meats and strong cheeses, and pickled vegetables. The appearance is cloudy wheat color with a nice head. One of our favorite beers from Abita."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"American Double / Imperial Pilsner"
""
""
"Overall: This is a very a good brew. With 8% ABV, the alcohol does protrude through the beer. This is a good bold larger with a sweet, spicy flavor. It finishes with the perfect hoppiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"If this is a big bad boy from the bayou, I am not seeing it! I felt that the 8.0 ABV was surprisingly well hidden (which it a plus). This beer was not as advertised but still comes across as a decent lager for me."
""
""
""
"Fuller bodied than I expected, pushing above medium. Effervescence is restrained. Some warming from the alcohol crops up some several seconds after the swallow. A cloying film also develops, sadly, on the palate and, to a lesser extent, the tongue. All told, a decent brew but just that."
"O - I bought this on a whim. I was on travel and hadn't seen it before, so I wasn't really expecting anything. It's probably not something I would buy again, but it wasn't bad. I think if it had been a little sweeter in taste with a bit more flavor I would have liked it much better. As is, it just seems like an overly alcoholic lager."
""
""
""
"Comparable to Ayinger and Hofbrau Maibock, this one is pretty tasty. Textbook Helles Bock/Mai Bock. Pleasantly surprised from Abita, who I think generally makes pretty lackluster brews. I would buy it again when in the mood."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brilliant gold in color with great clarity and moderate carbonation. A light wisp of foam rests on top of the beer. I get a lot of light biscuity malt and lager yeast. The mouthfeel is smooth and brisk. The flavor is more light malt and biscuit like flavor."

""
""
""
""
""

"This is a big bad boy from the bayou. Abita has produced some lack luster brews in the past, but this one is really good. As far as bocks go this follows all the rules. Nice carbonation, good yeast back, clean finish. Strong ABV but well hidden. Had mine in a 22 oz bottle, uhm take two and call me in the morning. Had mine with a couple nice roasted chicken breast the wife had waiting on me when I got home from work."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some biscuit, a touch of sweetness. Taste is no so mild, biscuits, alcohol, malts, some sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid and enjoyable beer."

"This was certainly a smooth brew with a very thin consistency. It was rather light on the palate and had slightly more character than a high gravity malt liquor like St. Ides or a Steel Reserve."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Ok brew. A bit sweet, could find many better examples of the style. With a few tweaks, not too far off from being a contender in the imperial helles category. As it is, more like a clean malt liquor."

"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 5/5/2013. Slight gusher upon opening. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apple, raisin, grape, biscuit, cracker, light pepper, herbal, and floral hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of fruity ester, bready malt, and hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of apple, pear, grape, biscuit, cracker, light pepper, herbal, grass, and floral hops. Lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, cracker, light pepper, herbal, and floral hops on the finish for a bit. Good balance of fruity ester, bready malt, and hop flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly slick, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good Helles Bock. Good balance of malt, hop, and fruity ester notes; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours a transparent straw color with a respectable white head that recedes to a level that just qualifies as full surface coverage. Aroma is mild, smelling of honey, hay, and a faint, tropical fruitiness. I have no idea what a Helles bock should taste like, but it's much milder than I expected. There's a gentle, bready, honeyed malt flavor with enough earthy, herbal hops to balance it out. Some pepper is evident as well. The aftertaste is slightly medicinal, but mostly dry. The hops become a bit more aggressive as it warms. I must say that the alcohol is adeptly concealed, as I never would have suspected its 8% ABV. Present, tingly carbonation lends a lively mouthfeel that complements the flavor profile nicely. Despite the highly generic presentation and mild aroma, this brew was a pleasant surprise, yielding a drinkable, balanced character that belies its weight. Not exactly my favorite style, but a pretty quality offering nonetheless."
""

""
""
""

"Don't waste your money on this one. Abita usually makes a good quality beer, but this one is truly disappointing. Sent back, waiter told me I wasn't the first. Beer has a nasty smell and tastes as if the beer is still wort. Had three friends with me try it as well, and all agreed it's the worst beer they have ever tasted. Do not recommend."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is much improved by adding a half ounce of Woodford Reserve. The whisky rounds out the less attractive edges and adds the pleasing characteristics of bourbon -- a surprisingly balanced cocktail. Also surprising is the disappearance of the off-putting nose."

"O – Abita has done it again this thing is tremendous and really has set the bar high for Doppelbocks domestic and imported alike. This is much much better than the Celebrator from Ayinger which is rated as the top Doppelbock in the world. Definitely tasty and if you go slow it smooths out and leaves you with a very subtle bit of fruit that gives this tremendous drinkability."

"Enjoyed while in New Orleans for Cantillon Zwanze Day! Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, corn, grain, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, floral, wheat, grain, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. I really wasn’t impressed with this one that much if I am honest. However, this was about the only thing that was listed on the menu that I had not had before while we were grabbing food after the Zwanze Day festivities. There was just too much of a spicy and wheat aspect going on here. The aroma kind of reminded me of an adjunct lager in a way with the corn aspect going on. Really glad it didn’t carry over. Still not that great unfortunately."

"Overall, not too bad, but nothing special. It IS easy to drink, which seems to be the point (now that I read the back of the bottle.) If that's your joint, then maybe this is for you, but I like higher ABV's to demand a little respect. I probably won't be seeking this out again, sadly. I would add that most of the Abita that I've had as been great."

"It really tastes like a strong, peppery pilsner beer. Nothing strikes me as German, but ultimately, it's just too much spice to be a good beer. Has some good characteristics, but the mouthfeel just kills it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little too much alcohol is detectable in this beer for me and I do not feel like there is a good balance between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops."
"O: This beer isn't that difficult to drink for the style because the alcohol isn't that prominent in the taste."

"I found this to be an average beer , ok so Im a hillbilly from Arkansas , not sure how that lowers my rating ability , but this just didnt do it for me , the smell , the taste , the fullness of the beer just wasnt there for me. I like a lot of the beers out of LA, love all of the bayou tech stuff Ive tried , and most of the Abita , this one just wasnt special enough for 5 dollars for a 22oz bottle , and I also had to drive to Memphis to get it , so maybe that didnt help any , I mean I didnt drive over just for this , but picked it up with a batch of beers I wanted to try. Its ok , just not great"
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, sugar, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and easy to drink."

"The flavour was a surprise as well. Not incredibly sweet by any stretch. Surprisingly light. Thankfully, not overly hoppy at all. Perfect amount of hops here. Despite the lightness of it all, alcohol is incredibly subdued for 8%, but thankfully still discernible. But man, I could probably chug this down if I wanted to. Both due to the light, crisp flavour and the seemingly magically hidden alcohol content. This is not what I was expecting at all, but it's really quite good nonetheless. The only other thing I've encountered that claimed to be a ""Helles doppelbock"" was made by Samichlaus. That was 14% alcohol and a thick, sweet concoction. Amazing, of course, but in no way related to this. This is a totally different approach. I'm pretty sure I even taste wheat in this. This is far more on the Helles side, not so much on the doppelbock side, but in all the right ways. It's less bitter and a tad more sweet than most helles bocks and of course, it's got that doppelbock level of alcohol. Good stuff."

"This comes across a bit grainy to me. It's also a bit warm with an excessive alcohol warmth. The drinkability would be improved a great deal if it were toned down slightly. The flavor and body are mediocre. I would expect more from a Maibock."

"I think I saw this one first on the show ""True Blood"". Caught an $8 growler sale on this 8%ABV beer and had to give it a try. Light colored with a massive white head that left plenty of lacing. A floral, belgian aroma. The alcohol was well hidden and the beer was very easy to drink- almost too easy."

"It's a pretty tasty beer overall, and a solid maibock."

"O - A fine, refreshing, high ABV dobblebock that drinks more like an imperial pils. 3.75"
""
"O: A very different Abita offering. One of those ""cutting the grass"" session beers. Will do well in Mississippi when they bring it in July. This gator nibbles at your taste buds, then puts the chomp down for a decent Helles Bock. I bet it's even better on tap."

"Appearance is bright yellow with a finger of off-white head. Its` nose has lemon, sugar, a sweet smell. The taste is a little bitter, sweet, more lemon Mouthfeel is medium, clean finish. A very average tasting helles bock, but one that is nonetheless still refreshing on a warm day."
"Deceptively drinkable. Wish it had a somewhat bolder flavor, though."
"O - This lager isn't one to bring lots of complexity or stand out from the pack, but with it's crisp, lighter body, it's certainly an easy beer to drink. The mouthfeel was the strongest point of the beer for me, and while a little light for the style, it still seemed to work pretty well. Overall, there are plenty of nice Maibocks out there to choose from, but this offering is a solid choice when in the mood for a lighter, crisper option."

"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours clear orange gold with a large white head. There are plenty of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. This appears to be well carbonated. Some lacing is left on the glass during consumption and the bubbles later become tiny. There are aromas of sweet malts, hops, and fruits. There are flavors of sweet malts, mild hop bitterness, and some fruit like apple or pear. It's bready. There is also some faintly perceptible alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is light to medium. The finish is crisp and dry. The carbonation is adequate. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. It is not the best of Abita's big beers, but it is certainly very good good beer in its own right. I feel Abita accomplished what it set out to do here."

"Poured from tap into pint glass at Portico in Monroe, LA. Pours a crisp golden color with some good sticky lacing. Smells of sweet malts and a bit of hops. Taste is slightly sweet and boozey malts. Slight bitter hop taste but its deff a helles. Nice straw flavor as well. Overall, really not a bad brew and neat to see a helles with a bit of bite."

"I have to say that I was very surprised to see such a low rating for this beer. I drank it on a sober pallet. Andygator poured a vibrant gold with a perfect two finger head. Although the head dissipated after two minutes to about a quarter inch, I did notice it had extraordinary lacing. The aroma was sweet and slightly hoppy with a hint of malt. Not too overpowering though. After the first taste I was very impressed. Floral, sweet, and smooth all the way to the end. There was a slight taste of hops left in the back of my throat. The medium body and crisp carbonation complement the taste perfectly. I will admit that this was my first doppelbock, thus I have nothing to compare it to. However, overall I would say this is certainly a new favorite beer."
""
""
"O - I like what Abita has done here. The idea of a helles doppelbock seemed interesting and the Andygator does a great job of being a drinkable and enjoyable beer. This isn't pretentious at all and is well worth your time if you want a hearty, sessionable imperial-style lager."

"O - This is a nice bock from Abita. Good value at less than $5 for a bomber."

"It was a pretty pale, straw yellow with a finger head. The smell was pretty much just sweet, alcohol and citrus. The taste was pretty much right on with the smell. The sweet was overpowering, almost saccharine and the citurs flavors were pretty mild. I emphasize how sweet, in a bad way, that this beer was. The mouthfeel was pretty average, mild carbonation and fairly drinkable. Overall this beer was pretty dismal. I'm normally pretty comfortable around Abita, but this one may have changed my mind. Like I said, I thought it was something along the lines of a Hefe, mainly from the citrus flavors and sweetness and the fact that I almost never ever like wheat beers."

"Overall: I'll admit, this is a go to beer for me. I love the higher ABV, hides it exceptionally well. Smooth beer, really good to get a pitcher of it at one of my favorite restaurants and share a pitcher or two with someone. Really well balanced beer, and I'm on Abitas side, great beers. I've had this on draft, in a growler, and in bottles. I keep plenty on stock for when I want to do some session drinking, and this is my main stay!"
"Overall, you're better off saving money and just buying malt liquor. This is a terrible beer. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bud Light Platinum is basically the same beer as Andygator, only better. Better."

"O: Overall a very good beer. Served on tap at a Jacksonville Pizza restaurant, and I was very pleased. Others at the table enjoyed it as well. Served in smaller glasses, which was a benefit since it's stronger than it tastes."

"Looks honey golden in color, I accidentally chill-hazed it a bit, so I let it breathe a while in the tulip glass to warm up. Two fingers of foam that falls apart in less than a minute, no lacing left behind. Medium body with really nice carbonation, just a touch of stickiness to the body. Nice floral scent overlaid with mild generic fruit esters, some caramel malt appears in the nose once it gets good and warmed up to room temperature. Taste is semi-sweet, the generic esters on the nose come into focus as restrained pear tones garnished with herbal hopping notes. Overall a nice, tasty Maibock, hides the alcohol rather well, nothing really wrong with it, but not really very distinctive from similar offerings either. (maybe the high ABV counts as being distinctive?)"
"Serving type: bottle poured into perfect pint 6.99 1pt6oz"
"Overall this is a very solid Imperial Helles lager (in my eyes) with sweet dopplebock tones. Most affordable at only 5 dollars so give it a try!"
"Drinkability is okay, it's smooth and goes down with ease. The diacetyl is an obvious flaw, but it actual provides some otherwise absent complexity."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a thick foamy white head. It smells of apple and caramel, slightly tart, with hints of citrus and honey. The taste is sweet and fruity with pear and apple. There is a hint of honey, alcohol and bready malt. It's medium bodied and smooth with low carbonation and a slightly dry finish, This is an interesting dopplebock, it's fruity and not as malt driven as others but it is an enjoyable brew."
"I remember ""back in the day"" when this beer came out, once again, Abita was an innovator in the Micro-brew industry (that wasn't even an industry yet back then, lol). I still love it and am glad I can now find it on the West Coast! It has a nice golden/amber color and is both malty and hoppy in flavor, but not overpowering on either account. Very well balanced. It is very easy to drink for a high alcohol beer!"
"Overall I feel like I paid five bucks for an Old English... boo hiss"
"Pretty unmemorable overall but not bad."
"Well-textured with a medium consistency and a medium to high level of carbonation. This could benefit from a little time to mellow. A solid offering, though I would pick up a 4-pack of Celebrator before springing for another bomber here."
"Drinkability: For a high ABV beer (8%) there's no strong alcohol flavor. The light and fruity flavors make it a unique Helles Bock, and one that is very easy to session with. I will be grabbing more of this to take along on vacation with me soon. A perfect brew to enjoy around a campfire or on the deck with friends (friends who enjoy good beer!)."
"nice floral rose finish after a very tart beginning... this beer could definitely get another sitting..."
"Overall Drinkability - Good. Actually really good. Surprisingly."
"overall, a good beer, but chill it first."
"Taste-Sweet malt, peach, lemongrass, hint of honeyed bread. Very smooth and drinkable for the strength. A refreshing sipper served cold on a warm summer afternoon."
"O: This is a bit strange but at least it goes down easy for such a strong brew."
"Overall, not bad at all. Hides the 8% abv really well and is a nice refreshing beer."
"O - This was an amazingly easy drinker that hid it's abv extremely well. I would definitely tell others to give this a try and hope Abita continues to push style boundaries"
"D: Pretty nice little beer here... one was good with me but the 8% really never hit me.... It hide the 8% pretty good.. I had never seen the Abita so I took a chance and found another good brew from our friends at Abita.."
"Pours a clear, sparkly gold. A white head rears back, but coats the glass. Smell is floral and herbal and hoppy; nicely unexpected from a beefy helles. Taste quickly morphs into the nutty, bitter, and slightly pungent bock character. Finishes straight boozy, although this might be exaggerated by the inherent feel of the doppelbock. Very big contrast smell-to-taste, imo. A unique offering, I'm pleased once again with the experimentation of Abita."
"I like this one.. not to heavy..but with enough weight to carry its own....some bite..but not enough to run you away....the sweetness entices you ...would be a great beer for Thai food!"
"It poured yellow to light orange color, It has a small white foaming head. I smelled hints of citrus, herbs, floral, and grassy notes. I tasted a bit of fruitiness and hop, with a malty finish. I tasted it on tap before they ever bottled it and I felt that at the time it felt heavier than in the bottle. i need to pass by the brewery pub to taste again."
"From my weekend notes: Poured from the bottle to a pint glass. Clear golden pour with a small off-white head. Nose is grassey, floral, and lightly sweet. Tastes of grass, florals, apple juice, and yeast. Sweet enough to balance the grass and florals, but not overly fruity or estery. The big draw of this beer is the ABV, and turned out to be an ok brew."
"This beer surprised me. I was little skeptical at first it being a double bock and helles hybrid. I found it to have very pleasing aroma. It was not as rich as a bock but not as fruity as a helles in both the flavor and the taste. It has the caramel and roastyness of a bock. It also has the grass/grainy and citrus flavor of the helles. The body is medium. Two styles combined into a great marriage."
"The beer I know won't let me down when there's nothing wildly interesting on tap."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Color was pretty with a yellowish base and a golden hue. Head was healthy, white, and about one and a half fingers strong. Little lacing. Smell was initially grassy with some florals. Taste has a bit more malt to it, with the florals taking more of a back seat. Feel is smooth and enjoyable with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable beer. Great flavor, smell and feel."
"D: A really easy drinker for its weight. Well-crafted."
"Bought a 22 of this while I was in california and brought it home to Oregon. I poured this into a coke glass (think perfect pint-ish) Which resulted in a thick white head on top of the rich golden color beer. The head retention was impressive, it reversed very slowly. Smell is of sweet malts and some citrus hops, seems inviting. Taste starts with light malts, some interesting sweet and fruit flavors. Hops come in toward the end to help finish the sip with a little bitterness. Mouthfeel was just a touch thick for my preferences. Overall I don't know if I was able to fully appreciate this beer, I'd like to try it again next time I visit CA."
" Starts out fine, ends a bit boring but if this is your style it's easier to look beyond."
"That said, there is something deficient on the taste. I like the direction, but it seems a little thin. I dunno..."
"O - very good; almost too easy to drink;"
"Drinkability: A very interesting beer, the lovely grape flavours were surprisingly good but different. I fear this may be a little too complex for my developing palette - I must try this one again at a later time. Regardless, I will be enjoying this brew to the last drop."
"1325"
"Altogether I think if you get rid of the residual yeast, this brew would hold its own against any German made Maibock."
"Overall - Enjoyable, but the abv can sneak up on you."
"Served on-tap at Mellow Mushroom in Jacksonville, FL. The beer was poured in a pint glass, and presented a crystal clear straw-gold coloring with a thin, white film of head. Fruity, malty aromas, with light hints of grain. The beer has tangy, fruity flavors, with round, bold, malty notes and a grainy ending. The beer is extremely light and crisp in mouth, with a slightly sour fruit aftertaste. The finish is filmy in mouth, and the lingering sour changes to a musty flavor."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice clean golden yellow color with a small pure white head. The aroma is very yeasty and full of fresh fruits including strong citrus and raisin. The taste has a distinct sweetness with a strong malt finish and a warm alcohol affect. Stronger carbonation in this lighter brew, seems to carry a lot of Helles characteristics was a nice touch. Of all the Abita I had in NO LA this was a good one to bring back and share."
" ~ I would suggest this brew to a friend. This is something that would be served well at a weekend lunch. The complexity isn't overwelming with would make it a nice mid-day beverage."
"Overall - Although not terribly memorable, it is refreshing. Mild aroma, taste, and aftertaste make it easily sessionable (even at 8% ABV)."
"Flavor is very clean, light, has a smooth-buttery feel, it's malts aren't too prominent but that is not a negative. The 8% alcohol is more noticeable with such a light beer but it's not distracting to me. After an evident but not significant bready flavor there is little-to-no hint of hops which I expected more of given the style. There is a bit of sweetness to it as well. Overall I'd say Andygator is a refreshing beer that is clean and flavorful enough to satisfy. It's not great but it's simply a good beer."
"Big malt presence here. I would have like some more hops but carbonation helps out a little with balance. A Helles /Dopplebock seems weird. Maybe they were going for an Imperial Helles Bock."
"has great drink ability...but the abv will catch up to you"
"Overall very enjoyable, medium carbonation with a nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable; even sessionable at this high abv."
"D - May give this one another shot as I did buy the last bottle that was on the self at the time so I may have had an older bottle but can't say that I was blown away by this beer...this review will be subject to edit if and when I get another."
"D - Pleasantly surprised, this being the first of the style I recall having. Can see this as an entry beer for those who drink fruity white wines and wine coolers but dislike the ""beer"" taste of real beers. Sweetness would stop me from drinking more than one or two, but hey, that's me."
"This is a great sipper, hides it's strength well. Despite the strength, was tempted to risk sessioning this. I'd definitely have it again."
"D: I won't buy another bottle, but I won't turn down a glass. I will try on tap if ever found as I feel this is a style that is not best suited to bottling."
"Picked up a bomber of this one the other day, primarily because I had enjoy Save our Shores, but also because $5 seemed like such a small risk. Probably wouldn't buy it again, but the bottle was enjoyable enough. Poured a hazy golden color, with a small white head. Sweet and full bodied, with bready malts, caramel and a little honey. Good, but kind of forgettable."
"Drinkability- smooth mouthfeel makes this beer."
"The Andygator pours a deep yellow to orange color. A pure white head sits on top with a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are very subtle but some malts, breads, and little floral notes. Taste is pretty smooth. Not too complex but nice malts, grains, and hops make up the quaff. A very sessionable beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth."
"So far, this is my least favorite Abita beer and I have had a good number of them. Pours a pretty golden yellow color with a thick luxurious white head and tons of lacing. Smells of strong hop aroma and some malts. A blitz of hop bitterness is up front but then mellows out towards the end leaving some malty sweetness and a little citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"D: Should not be as easy drinking as it is. Cannot tell as all that is a 8% beer."
"D- Considering the high abv, this one is pretty damn drinkable. Its a bit on the thicker but not overbearing."
"D- Good balance between the malts and hops with subtle hints of different spices. I easily drank this one."
"Drinkability: I can see that this beer actually does really fit with the bottle description (Helles doppelbock) in that it is an helles bock with extra ""oomph"" to strengthen the alcohol. That said I've not become a fan of this beer. It lacks some of the subtle complexity I like to find in an helles bock. It was ok to try it but I'll probably not revisit this one. ( I thought this one better on tap.)"
"Overall, avoid."
"When I ordered this beer my brother, who is from Louisiana, said ""that's what we order at the bar when we just want to get wasted."" I ordered it anyway, but after having one I am inclined to agree with him. It is big, malty, boozy, and tastes more like an Old English than a craft beer (although big lagers an pilsners tend to have that quality)."
"Good drink ability, doesn't chase you away from the alcohol, and has flavor. will have to try again to see if it holds up"
"Pours a two finger light cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear light amber/yellow color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light grassy nose. Flavor is malty sweet, hints of grass. $3.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT. Best by May 2011."
"I appreciate experimentation with imperial styles, but this one just doesn't work that well for me. I don't think the beer is poorly conceived. But I don't think that it really works as a style. Nice try but just not my cup of tea."
"Overall, this goes high on the list of brews that I want a lot more of."
"SkÅL!"
"Opinion: Overall, this is a pretty decent beer. It is obviously intended to be the style that it says it is, which is a good thing for an American version of a German beer (that often isn't the case...""Bock"" for example). That said, it lacks the richness that you get from most German beers. There is plenty of malt there, but it lacks dimension. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer again, but I don't know how much I will be seeking it out. I would certainly like to try it on tap, especially at the brewery, but for now I am left with the aftertaste of a decent beer. Cheers!"
"So, they are calling this a Helles Dopplebock. I assume that means a dopplebock brewed without the more highly roasted malts. In any event....Pours a crisp and brilliant pale amber. So clear you can read your fB page through it. Aroma carries some two-row malt and not much else. Vibrantly carbonated and gives huge head, that actually settles into a nice comforter like layer of foam, with decent lacing. I'm already impressed from what is usually a sub-par brewer. This is like Baroness' ""Blue Record", to continue that thought...Ouch, wtf am I drinking? Lots of cinnamon and other stuff, like coriander, right up front in the flavor. This is truly unique, no doubt about it...But is it good? Crazy stuff going on, and a hop bitterness I can't quite place which ends the beer both sharply and with a certain roundness. It's actually well-balanced, but so wacky are these flavors they clash with each other. Hmmm...I'd have to say it's a good beer just out of uniqueness, and I like the spciy flavors...Worth trying folks. Color me a very Baroness-level surprised..."
"Poured into a pint glass. I was looking forward to a this, as the bottle called it a ""Dopplebock," and Abita's beer have been decent. Once I poured it and smelled it, the Andygaror was clearly not a dopplebock. The alcohol smell came through right away along with a strong and very unappealing grass odor. Carbonation was minimal. The taste was very unappealing: overly sweet and loaded with rice. An extremely sour aftertaste lasted for some time, and I continued to smell what seemed like old celery. Malt liquor qualities throughout, as it reminded me of a Milwaukee's Best but with twice the ABV."
"All in all however, it's a good, not great beer. Definitely my favorite selection that I've had from Abita so far."
"D- this isn't a bad beer. But abita is right. It is a beast, one that could use some domestication and refining. I probably would drink it again, but at the price point it's at, probably not."
"Drinkability is good and honestly I could drink a few of these even with it higher ABV. While obviously not a session beer, it is great for those hot Houston afternoons!"
"Pours a clear, light golden color. 6/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, pale malt, slight grain, wheat, hint of citrus, and sweet malt. Fits the style of Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of wheat, hops, hint of pale malt, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend."
"Overall: Nice beer, however, not Abita's best. Yet, for 4.99 this is a decent dinner size beer. It is perfect for hot terrible weather, the kind Maryland has been seeing for most of this summer."
"D - This is a nice hellesbock with a pleasant malt character. The hops, in the finish especially, seem a bit stronger than average for the style, but it helps to cut the malt and makes for a more drinkable than average beer."
"Oh well."
"Pours clear orange body with white frothy head on top. Aroma of sweet corn, grains, floral notes, and wheat. Strong flavors of stale light fruit, grains, old wheat, slight honey, and artificial sugar. Light in body which makes the unpleasant flavors stand out on the palate. Light in carbonation so you can really soak in the off flavors in this brew. This beer reminds me of the line from the movie ""300", ""You will not enjoy this. This will not be over quickly."""
"Abita Andy Gator....WOW....Yellow and crystal clear! It looks like there is very little carbonation because it had a small thin white head. It quickly dissipated to just a slight film over the top of this beer. I get a a lot of banana in the nose like some hefeweizen. A bit of skunkiness on the palate with more banana. This beer is light and easy to drink. A little bit of alcohol heat is on the finish. It seems like there is too much going on at once in this beer. It is a wonderful change from Abita's other beers."
"D- Being in Gainesville, it's nearly my namesake, too bad it's not the best example of the helles dopple... If it's offered to me, I won't turn it down, but it's certainly not something I will seek out..."
"Maybe I'm not hip to this angle yet."
"Supposed to be a Helles Doppelbock, but not really sure if it is even between those styles. That spicy German hop character comes out a bit in the aftertaste, but it doesn't have that sweet malt flavor - the sweetness in a way seems almost artificial. Fun to try, but I doubt I'll be picking this up again."
"I don't usually like abitas stuff but this one is pretty damn good."
"D - this wasnt what i ordered but was given by mistake (albeit for free). i'm never one to turn down a free beverage but about 3/4 of the way through i had enough, not because i overly disliked it, just because it became a bit boring."
"D - Definitely a must try. Great for a muggy summer night when you don't want something heavy but can't settle for something light. Just watch out for the 8% - it will sneak up on you."
"Seems like a confusion of styles more than a hybrid. Decent brew for the cash, though. Could definitely see getting into trouble with this on a hot day as the 8% is hidden really well."
"D: OK drink-ability, the alcohol was pretty noticeable but the other flavors were pretty good."
"Very clean and drinkable. Seems like one of their better releases too. Definitely worth picking up."
"Drinkability: I don't really see the ""Doppelbock"" part of this beer. Flavorful and fine to drink, but I certainly wouldn't put this in the Doppelbock category."
"Abita Andygator Helle Doppelbock pours a finger of creamy white foam over a clear deep gold brew. Carbonation is brisk, and the nose is as fruity as the bottle suggests- though there are notes of barley husk and alcohol tang too. Sweet light malt is the flavor up front- there are bubblegum notes too, balanced by mild herbal, slightly metallic hops off the back. Mouthfeel is round and smooth with a bit of a tingle from the carbonation and alcohol- a not inconsiderable 8%ABV. If you like a dry, assertive lagers this may not be for you, but altogether it's a pretty tasty way to take the edge off."
"You know, this is a much better brew than the $4 price tag indicates. It blows away the $3 #9s we have here in the bang for your buck department. Honestly, I would still be pleased paying Stone prices. This was a surprisingly crisp and refreshing brew."
"I'm not a huge fan of dopplebocks, so I've stayed away from this one for a while now. While visiting NOLA, I finally broke down and bought it, since it was only $4, rather than the $9 at home. I was pleasantly surprised that it was less of a dopplebock, and more of a strong Helles. Kind of reminded me of Leffe Blonde. Head was super thick, lasted a good while, then to a thin lacing. Smell was malty up front with a slight fruit on the rear. Taste was big malt up front and slight tinge of fruit and alcohol on the finish. Again, the taste reminded me a lot of Leffe Blonde, rather than the dopples I'm used to. It was light, but packed a strong blow with the 8%. Definitely glad I gave it a shot and will get it again back at home."
"So the mouthfeel is the biggest asset, followed by a fairly cool bottle. And what does all that mean? I'm not sure, but it doesn't say, hey, how good is this beer? Nah, it's just a good idea that fell short in execution. And it's a classic case of not bothering to justify facing the shifty ABV. This isn't so much a beast as some poor life-form that got shaken and stirred in the transporter beam."
"3.5/3/2.5/3/2.5"
"This is a hells dopplebock and it is very fruity on the nose. I poured it into the new New Belgium snifter I just got, and the head fell away with great lace beautifully. Fresh and crisp on the nose. Sweet low hops and fruity on the palet and finishes sweet and wet. The body is at a medium. A good pair with some dirty rice and a warm day."
"D: A pretty good little bock with decent long term drinkability"
"Pours vivid yellow with a big fluffy head. The aroma is corny and musky, with a coriander spice. Flavor is musky and citrusy, with coriander, an edge of hominy and ground cornmeal. There is a faint phenolic bite in the yeast. There is a feeling of a rich artisnal bread. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy."
"Drinkability - It's a tasty beer. Maybe not the best example of a doppelbock. 3.0/5.0"
"Well this beer reminded me of a friend of mine that is a huge UF fan and has a dog by the name of Andy. I had to buy the beer and review it for her even though she isn't a fan of beer at all. OK so sentimental crap aside, once again I feel like Abita is relying too much on their water for their beers. It is smooth yes but the flavor is so subtle and weak it doesn't stick out well. Yes it is smooth to drink but nothing crazy flavor wise. Since it is a ""Gator"" beer I can easily compare it to Tim Tebow. While the label says dopplebock I really sorta get a standard lager. Just like they say Tebow is going to be a QB but really he is more of a FB. Listen, the kid is great, just like the beer is smooth to drink, but they both FAIL epically in my book."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, syrupy, and sticky sweet."
"Thanks for trying something new Abita."
"Hides the abv extremely well and slides down surprisingly quickly."
"Taste was similar. More of a malt focus with only a bit of hop character. I would have never guessed this was an 8%abv beer. Very smooth & easy to drink. I didn't find this beer to have a lot of character, but it wasn't bad or flawed in any way. Just not as interesting as I had hoped."
"Overall, a decent showing from Abita. I will continue to enjoy an Andygator from time to time, especially on visits to the brewery."
"Overall, I'm not sure what to compare this to... so I won't. i'll just take it for what it is: a very sweet high-alcohol bock which means it won't fair that well."
"D- Easy drinking beer because of the big flavors. I warn you, this one will creep up on you!"
"I'd consider buying this again at this price. Especially as spring and summer approach. It was a good experience as I watched Survivor with the wife. It was nothing overwhelming impressive while I felt it did a good job with the style. HOWEVER, I really don't know much about the style aside from it being higher ABV and sweeter. So..."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Poured a clear golden yellow with a big pillowy white head that quickly goes into a thin film with minor lacing. Doughy malty aroma. Very sweet toffee and apples (?) taste. A bit of a spicy aftertaste. This beer is very smooth and too easy to drink for it's high AVB which it hides very well. Thought this was a good attempt at a helles dopplebock."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability overall, I'm enjoying the first couple 22 ounce portioned big beers to come out of Louisiana, solid to style yet trademarked with Abita must be the yeast and water their brewing with. Whatever it's a solid brew, I will revisit especially since I hear it's been on tap in the Pittsburgh market lately. Priced great to boot."
"RJT"
"Pours amber and clear. Aroma is light, fruity, malty. Taste is sweet also. There's a good malty presence, with flavors of honey and bread fresh from the oven. Hop presence is mild. Tastes like a doppelbock alright. There's some heft to the mouthfeel without being thick or syrupy. Finishes sweet, and was a good contrast to the prime rib. Oh baby!"
"D: Though it is a Helles Doppelbock the beer seems not to have the signature qualities of either style varieties and becomes sort of lost in its mix. The flavors are not too complex which make it too drinkable for an 8% A.B.V. Yet, its worth trying because I found it does produce an interesting experience that only adds to ones repertoire."
"I am not terribly knowledgeable of the style, but I would have to say this is one of the better Abita beers. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with low carbonation."
"I'll give this a 4 for drinkability. It's a delicious brew for sure, but very rich and fairly thick. I do really like it, but I'm afraid It will just be one."
"Out of the bomber I choked down about half a pint before drainpouring the rest. A hideous beer."
"I have to mention that I didn't get the first whiff or taste of the 8% in this one either.. No booziness at all which seems to be different that what everyone else got out of this.. At any rate, I wound up liking this one...."
"This stuff is spot on for the style with the exception of color. Slow drinking but very good. I am usually skeptical of Abita brews, but I'd highly recommend this as it is high quality and tasty."
"Aroma is slightly odd but other than that a tasty beer."
"I dont love it but it doesnt suck either, nice, clean simple beer."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice golden color and poured a beautiful blond head. The beer has a fruity smell and a fruity taste. The beer had a bit of a alcohol burn to it which I did not care for. I will not buy this beer again."
"Taste is rich and malty but it's a bit too boozy. It has a nice toastiness to it as well as a rich breadiness. It's creamy and easy drinking with a full mouthfeel."
"Taste is a little on the sweet side, light raisiny spiciness, grain, unbaked dough, apple, hint of raisin, finish of light apple and peach before a sweet, fruity-grain aftertaste. Feel is solid, slightly oily, a bit frothy, and quite nice."
"I'd highly recommend this to someone who is looking for a pleasant surprise."
"D - Not my favorite style of beer so I am probably a little biased...but not bad."
"D- better than i was expecting, especially at that price. i havnt had the best of luck with other abita products. this on is probably my favorite. if i see it for that price again ill probably pick another one up."
"Overall, a decent beer worth trying, I'll go back and try it again and adjust my review if needed."
"I usually like Abita's beers, especially for the climate...but this one didn't do it for me."
"A souped-up lager basically--assertive flavor, sweetness and alcohol level, none of it cloying. ""Helles Doppelbock""? I don't know...how about just Big Sweet Lager? It's not bad at all, certainly interesting...or maybe ""enigmatic"" is the better word."
"D-Solid beer for the style. Not the most flavourful, yet enjoyable. Alcohol is kept in check (barely noticeable). Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: while drinking this beer, I kept saying to myself that it was a Helles Doppelbock, but another side of me kept on saying that it's not a good Doppelbock because there wasn't much going for this beer taste and smell wise. The color of the beer was pretty damn good though. If I buy a beer to look at, this would be one of first choices. If I bought a beer to smell and taste, I would go somewhere else for that. If you ever want to try a Helles Dopppelbock, there are better and cheaper ones out there."
"I think this beer is grossly mis-categorized and has a lot lower rating than this beer should deserve. If I tried this beer for the first time with a blindfold on I would probably have guessed a Belgian triple due to the esters, sugars, and aftertaste combo....definitely not a dopplebock."
"I'll have to eventually compared andygator to other doppelbocks, but i'd say its a decent beer."
"Not bad and pretty easy drinking despite the ABV, but certainly not what I expected."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this bier and do recommend this to anyone. The helles doppel is a different style for me, but one I will go back to without complaint. Have one for me. Prosit!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a cool gator printed Andygator pint glass for me to keep a crisp pale orange (this is a doppelbock?) with a frothy eggshell head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet malts with a hint of hops. The taste is surprisingly remincent of a darker doppelbock; burnt caramel, molasses and slight dried fruit. The beer is on the heavy side with a decent amount of present alcohol. This is certainly an interesting brew, likely the best I've had yet from Abita."
"The drinkability for a 8%, was surprising smooth and easy. It would be easy to knock a few of these back."
"D: Very drinkable. Not much of a memorable one though... but still good."
"Finally got one of these after eyeballing it for so long. Deep golden in color. Smells like sweet, pale malts. Slightly bready. Tastes similar, quite sweet though. I think I just prefer the standard doppels to these helles ones, maybe that much pale malt is just a little overpowering to me. Can't taste too much hops, outside of what is probably a little noble flavor (saaz?). Not bad but I probably won't ever get this again."
"While the 8.0%abv is noticed, it's not overpowering. This is an easy, inoffensive, drinker. Personally, I like my beers to challenge me a little bit more."
"Overall a very nice beer, well executed. I'm not sure about the idea of a ""helles doppelbock"" but it works very well as a strongish maibock. Shows a good expression of pilsner malt. Drinkable for a beer of it's strength but with just enough complexity and warmth to demand substantially more consideration than the average fizzy yellow beer."
"Drinkability: This is refreshingly different for a dopplebock. Similar to other Abita beers it is light for the style and surprisingly very drinkable. I tasted a small bite, but not a huge gator bite. I did not get a huge alcohol taste. This is a nice and relaxed sipper. Possibly Abita's best."
"Drinkability - It's tough to rate ""to style"" a Helles Doppelbock as I've never really heard of it before, but my idea was to take the helles bock and expect a bit more booze and to this end the beer delivers. I guess it's kind of the German equivalent of American malt liquor and if that's the case then this is the finest ML I've ever had. Those with a more refined beer palate may find themselves quick to dismiss this Abita offering, but I would suggest considering what the goal is here because for me this was a terrific brew especially (I would imagine) when enjoyed in the Louisiana summer."
"Lush full mouthfeel, but not as full as could be expected of an 8% beer. Some have compared this to a macro brewed malt liquor with slightly more complexity and would tend to slightly agree."
"Drinkability - I had this thing sitting in my fridge forever, never really calling me to finally open it up, but now that I have, I wish I would have done it sooner. This is very drinkable and solid, good stuff."
"Verdict: Basically a souped-up Helles, Andygator may not be a true Doppelbock, but it is a serviceable and solid enough brew. An interesting hybrid style, I'd like to see some other brewers have a shot at it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the clear golden amber brew. Head falls gradually, with ample sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet and kind of boozy. Taste also starts sweet, is creamy in the middle, but then hits a bit harshly with the alcohol. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, but quashed by the harsh fusels or something, with drinkability being ok. Could have been better."
"D: A nice effort by Abita, I've been impressed by the Harvest series and this brew. Would seek this brew out again."
"overall this hybrid is fantastic - reminds me of capital's blonde dopplebock but with the add in flavors of a helles lager - this is my first abita beer and i was blown away"
"Thinner than most doppelbocks, but the brew has the classic malty (quite dry) presence with a warming alcohol burn in the swallow. There is a light hop touch to the back end of the taste. Not much of an aftertaste. The earthiness is not present in the taste. Overall, an easy, if light, introduction to the world of bocks."
"Our local expert's mailing list indicated that the Andygator was an ideal change of pace for serious doppelbock fans. I agree wholeheartedly and believe that the similarities are outstanding but the slightly lighter (though no less deep and refined) characteristics make it a great choice."
"i could go on about the intricicies of the taste, smell, head etc..but ill just be very straightforward and honest instead. theres really nothing 'dopplebock' about this. i know its a 'helles'. but to be frank its very similar in appearance, smell and taste to corona or tecate. that said, its not a bad beer at all and better and more potent than either of those. it has a citrusy presence that they dont. but other than that, its basically a more potent corona."
"nice brew"
"D: Vaguely recall tasting this one on-tap at the pub 3+ years ago...found it 'good' then, assessment is the same now (though the subtleties are appreciated more). A big beer but a drinkable one, well-made and worth endorsing. Look for the bombers if you're in SE Louisiana; I'd grab more if I could."
"D-Definately drinkable, it went down really well with the pizza."
"Pours a clear gold with an exceptionally frothy and beautiful white head that lasts a long time and laces the glass. Andygator smells of sugary grains and alcohol, a bit too simple for its style. Taste is cloying, very disappointing. The nutrasweety flavor made it impossible for me to enjoy it. Pass."
"Taste is very appealing with a nice balanced approach of hops and a hint of citrus. Yeast comes through as well. This is a very smooth drinking wheat beer to put it in a nutshell. A hop bitterness in the finish. Mouth feel is very nice with carbonation and then a nice slick finish. Alcohol is not very apparent, but the label says it is there. A very drinkable beer."
"What a wonderful beer. Andy Gator purchased at a local beer shop in a 22 oz. bomber, served in a St. Bernadus goblet. This beer was light and clear (cleared up once it warmed a little). Medium carbonation and a decent head. A great aroma, hard to describe but the smell was very familiar, not really hop based though. This beer was amazingly smooth to drink. Nice medium to full mouthfeel and a very little aftertaste. A great example of a Helles. I am becoming more impressed with the makers of Purple Haze, did not see that coming."
"Bomber, no freshness info to be had. Pours clear lighter amber, off white head and nice fine webs of that lacey stuff. Bread and alcohol in the nose. Malt bomb, sweet, alcohol present. Malt, and more malt. Not my favorite style.Not really my cup of tea, one and done on this one."
"Drinkability: this goes down very easily."
"I definitely won't be buying this again as Abita has better beers in their lineup."
"Okay, this is no dopplebock. It's more like a lager or a weiss than anything. Lightly colored with a medium head. Head retention was fair but not thick as one might expect. I found it disappointing in the fruitiness. Way too sweet with little backbone. Slightly malty with not much in the way of hop flavor. I was excited to try, but mostly disappointed with the end result. The mouthfeel is a little light, not even really coating the tounge very well. Probably not a beer i would order again. Although, I probably will give it at least one more go just to be fair."
"Sweet and malty with a surprising amount of hoppy bitterness. Husky graininess with a bit too much alcohol abrasiveness. Still, it is fairly smooth and basically a malty treat to drink while not thinking about the beer too much. Biscuity flavor as it warms, one of Abita's better brews."
"What a pleasant surprise. When poured, the color was a clear medium golden yellow, with a medium amount of white foam and nice lace retention. The smell of sweetness filled the nose of mild hops and mild malts. The taste was a rich, sweet fruitness of roasted walt and whole hop. But, not like most doppelbocks, this one did NOT have a semi-dry finish, but, a sweet finish instead."
"Overall impression: A big, light, bold Maibock. Immensely drinkable but dangerous due to the alcohol. Nicely done."
"D: Pretty decently drinkable beer, not my favorite but nothing wrong with it either."
"Drinkability - flavorful and interesting; no problem working through the bomber."
"So much hope from the appearance and smell, but the rest of the beer just couldn't deliver."
"The color was very light and golden. Lighter that I had expected, almost what you would expect from a blonde. The aroma was also very light an mildly sweet. This is a nice, smooth and refreshing and slight sweet beer. There is a mild hop finish on the tongue, but what struck me was the absence of an alcohol taste. At 8% abv I expected to taste a little. This one could definitely sneak up on you."
"Probably not a bullseye on style but a good beer nonetheless."
"An unpleasant beer. Abita has turned out some decent beers in recent years, like their anniversary pils. This is a distinct step backwards, though."
"It's just average."
"Abita Andygator should appeal to anyone who likes big bocks. Even though it's short on pizzazz and is as deep as the kiddy pool, it does what it was designed to do. Whether that's enough to warrant a purchase is up to you. It is a bit of a toothy bastard, so respect the ABV and sip accordingly."
"This is an enjoyable beer. I've never had one like it, so I cannot really compare it to anything but regular doppelbocks, which are still rather different."
"Drinkability: Smooth drinking for a hot day. Spicy yet smooth."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while but there are other beers of its kind that I would pick first."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer, though it's a little short of doppelbock characteristics."
"The head brewer at Abita must have a very different taste preference than me because this, like most Abita's I've tried, just isn't very good (obviously in my opinion). I feel bad bashing Abita, but given their distributorship why can't they produce better beer? This one's boring, not well balanced, and lacking in flavor. Sorry."
"Poured a light gold color with two-finger head that quickly died. A malty smell with some sweetness but no real hops at all picked up. Goes down easy but bland as there is some minor caramelized malt sweetness and faint, veggie-like hop presence, but this is not a good DB. Passes over easy and has sweetness, but other than that there is no complexity or oomph in this beer. Maybe it's made for beginner's in mind."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a fluffy white head. Nice lacing down the glass. A sweet yeast/malt, clove, hop aroma. There are some fruit notes in the aroma also. The taste is sweet, somewhat toffee malts with a warming alcohol flavor and feel. There are slight earthy hops and bitterness in the finish. The bitterness lasts quite a while. A little bit of peppery spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thick and drinkability is ok."
"D - This is the first ""helles doppelbock"" I've had, and I wasn't very impressed. I think I'll stick to the more traditional doppels. This one just didn't do it for me."
"The body is way too light for the style. As far as drinkability, I didn't have much desire to finish my glass. I'm no expert on German lagers, but based simply on the BA style description of Dopplebocks... well, this isn't one. And it's really not a great beer either. It's not like it's disgusting, but not I would not drink it again."
"Not a bad beer but one that leaves me thinking there was something here that I just didn't get. It is OK but somehow I expected more from this beer. It is OK."
"Soft foamy head of about one finger, mix of all bubble sizes, close to bone white, very credible lacing. Bronze orange to a light brown in color, distorts light easily. Sweetly florid nose with a whole bunch of orange, lemon juice in addition to roasted nuttiness, corn, honeyed bread, sweetened cereal, crunchy apple, pear and peach scents, while thick overall does achieve a little lift. Full-bodied, creamy in feel with not a rough patch in sight, rubs gently into the palate. Lemon, orange and grapefruit citrus dominant here too, juicy and friendly with minimal bite. Malt, corn, granola, cinnamon, dehydrated apple and pear fruit starting to concentrate, some banana. Hint of caramel, toffee. Hard to pick out any keenly edged hoppy components. Stays fluffy and carbonated through the finish, No alcoholic heat but ""heady"" in a boozy way. Very affable, the John Candy of beers."
" Overall- This is an easy drinking beer. Perfect for style but nothing breathtaking. I would still recommend but would not go out of my way to get some."
"D - Very easy drinking beer. Mild and smooth."
"Uhh, not my bag baby. Poured clear gold with a frothy white head. Nice lacing. Sweet, perfume aroma laden with spun sugar, lemon, and malt. Sparkling mouthfeel, kept the feel light. Taste started off good, but got sickening towards the end of the glass. Lots of corn and crystal malt int he beginning, very nice. Light fruitiness, light sweetness that kept in check. Somehow, it seemed to build up in your mouth, though. Soon, the taste turned into a grape-candy and straw disaster. Its was like the Sam Adams Longshot Grape beer on steroids. The finish was long and sticky, and very unpleasant. If it remained constant in the beginning, I would have really liked this beer. But as it is, no way."
"Not quite sure what a ""Helles Doppelbock"" should taste like, but this lager bastardization works. Peppery, citric hops follow a sweet corn husk & pale malt profile, biting the back of the palate with a hint of booze and fruitiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, perhaps a bit over-carbonated, and without the signature chewiness of a good Doppelbock. A bit harsh on the finish. Still, Andygator is probably the best tasting beer I've yet had from Abita, and for that reason I'll look forward to trying their other bombers."
"This big beer is medium yellow in color and clear with a nice frothy head that fell to about 1/4"" after a minute. It appears to be medium in carbonation. The nose on this beer is of malt, alcohol, and possibly vanilla. The taste is of malt and a moderate amount alcohol. Initial body impression is light, but there is a little more to it than that. I'd say it's a light to medium bodied beer. The malt, alcohol and hint of vanilla flavoring are nice for this awesome brutish blond brew which I believe is worthy of it's name."
"This poured a clear light gold with white head. It smelled like bready yeast and lemon, with a hint of spices. It tasted like sweet honey malt and bready yeast and fresh wheat, with light orange and lemon hops and a bit of spice. It was fairly thick with mild carbonation, and had a light malty aftertaste. Overall this didn't have as big or bold of a flavor as I was expecting. It was still pretty crisp and tasty, and had a nice fully body. It hid the alcohol well too, so it was pretty easy to drink. But it could definitely use more malty sweetness and overall flavor. As it is, this beer was pretty bland and forgettable. Abita's Mardi Gras Bock might even have bigger flavor (although a bit less complex)."
"I can see where they were going - a souped-up helles bringing it to ""doppelbock"" category. Could be Imperial Helles, if there were such a style. A doppelbock, being a ""big"" lager, and this being a big helles-style, fits well enough. It is a bit boozy, not unexpected. The only real drawback I have is the slightly soapy aftertaste. Also, if you are having it alone, I suggest keeping it refrigerated between pours, as it doesn't exactly improve with warming (also not unexpected for what it is). It does have a nice sweetish nutty-ish, grainy presence and some fruity balance. An interesting ""sipper""."
"Overall I'm having trouble saying much of anything about this beer. It is boring and average. It's surprising that it is 8% ABV because frankly it has more in common than a standard American macro lager than it does with any kind of ""extreme"" beer, which the label seems to talk it up as."
"It's totally drinkable, and is actually a tasty beer. It doesn't fail as a beverage at all ... but as a doppelbock, it falls flat."
"Drinkability: Sorry, but I just didn't find this one to be a pleasure to drink nor is it agreeable in large quantities -- the completion of the sixteen ounces dragged on into the second shift at Taco Mac."
"At the time of this writing the top two reviews claim this is not a Helles Doppelbock (as per the label) but instead a 1. malt liquor, or 2. imperial pilsner. I disagree. I admit, I did buy this bottle because I was intrigued by the gimmicky alligator design and ""Helles Doppelbock"" sounds like a legit style to attempt. This has the right general idea, it's just not that good to drink. If you're expecting Optimator you'll be disappointed."
"D- The sweetness limits the drinkability for me but it is a decent beer that is worth a shot."
"I'm digging this one. After tasting a glass, decided to pair it with grilled sausages and veggies... which worked beautifully. Drinkability is pretty good for something with a higher abv. I'm still intrigued as to what this one really is... more of an imperial helles lager than a dopplebock, however contradictory ""imperial helles"" is. Either way, it's a deliciously surprising brew that I'd definitely pick up again."
"D: Kind of a weird mishmash between an imperial pilsner, a doppelbock, and a malt liquor. It drinks fairly well and is kind of interesting as a change of pace, but overall it lacks a bit of focus."
"Brew was malty, with low hop pressence. Warm alcohol gave a sharpness/bite that balanced well with the sweeter, malty side... making this beer extremely drinkable... and at 8% you have to exercise some caution!"
"Purchased in 22 oz bottle. Poured correct color. No head. Smell of sweet malts and nuts. Taste was what you would expect from a hellesbock. Warming alcohols, slick maltiness, and a mild hop bitterness. Better out of the bottle than a glass. Seems to be smoother with less smell involved using a bottle."
"D: I found to be limiting. Its not one I would bother to drink again , much less in multiples. It had flashes of some good flavor from now and then but just not enough to justify this as a good recommend. Worthy of a try, maybe, but never made me look forward to the next sip and was average at best in most regards."
"The aroma is sweet and fruity with yeast and malt. The appearance is copper with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is average for the style. Overall it's alright but that's all. This is easy to drink but rather underwhelming. Worth a try."
"Drinks alright, but one bomber has me sleepy. not bad, just to fruitty for the style"
"D - Not so much. Strong in a bad buzz way. I would imagine that too much of this would lead to one hell of a hangover."
"Not a big fan of this one. Cant see myself having again."
"I've been looking forward to trying this big bottle from Abita. It is good, not great. Wouldn't turn it down though."
"FYI - I would give this a pretty good review if it was listed as a Malt Liquor. It's an excellent example of a malt liquor an it would be a solid B+ or so if I was to review it in that context."
"D: Super drinkable. Granted I enjoy both styles being melded here. For the price and the unique experience this is something that I would have to recommend."
"Not bad at all. I don't know what to call this. This is not a dopplebock at all though. If anything this is a helles lager. Still, something that is worth a try."
"I'm not really seeing the doppelbock, but it does alright as a helles."
"Drinkability - I am impressed with this one, and able to put aside the ""bock"" reference on this one. This could replace my everyday adjuncts with ease. I could see myself enjoying the shit out of this after cutting the lawn. I would purchase this again."
"D: Well this beer is not bad at all, but for the style its way off. I am getting almost zero qualities of a doppelbock here. I mean the malt is not even rich and complex. This is by far more in the Helles area and I don't damn it because that is half the name. I just feel they should have left the doppelbock out of it. Maybe an Imperial Helles. That would be a better title. It is pretty drinkable once you get past its downfalls. Its clean and refreshing. Would be a decent, bigger warm weather beer. Just stop calling it a doppelbock. Pisses me off a bit."
"Pours a the perfect pilsner color of golden straw. Theres a few bubbles and a very nice two finger head to start,but leads to nothingness eventually. Pretty nice, simple and straight forward sweet malty hay, some earth and a little alcoholic warmth. Pretty simple, mildy sweet malty flavor that gets some help from the alchol. But then the alcohol gets its own show nd slows covers up the mild malts and vry faint earthy hop flavors. Sweet, then warm, then alcoholic palate. Glad I tried this beer, but will probably never buy again."
"A pale golden color, with a very thick head, three inches, white in color. A bready scent at first sniff, with touchesof yeasty twng. It finishes with a mild grassy fragrance. The malt is right out there and attacks the palate with bready and biscuity flavors. A mild hoppy bitterness, grassy in flavor, with touches of grapefruit at the end. A medium bodied feel, with the crispness that one expects from a lager. It does heavier texture at the back of the palate. This beer is a string lager, a maltiness that is strong. I am a confessed hop head, and I truly appreciate what this brings to the table."
"Pours beautiful golden color with contrasting white head that is very creamy. Nose is faint, but has a macro-malty, lemony boozy quality to it. Palate has a sharp character, alcohol easily noticed right away, modest malt flavor, and nothing much positive for the mind to latch onto."
"The taste settles on the palate heavily, and combined with the ABV make this a slow sipper of which you would not want to have more than one."
"As mentioned, to me it's more of a ""helles"" than a ""dopplebock."" Interesting effort and I am grateful for the opportunity to try the Abita special release series. This one is slightly messy...definitely drinkable but a tweener in terms of style. I am impressed with their hiding of the 8% ABV...defintely!"
"It's really not too bad, and pretty interesting. Helles doppelbock seems an interesting style to aim for, given that even a geeky audience hardly has a frame of reference for it. A little different marketing for this (see: Carlsberg Elephant) might have made Andygator more along the lines the consumer is hoping to see. I like the experimental nature of this brew, and if Abita feels like throwing out a few more high-gravity boys I will be sure to try them out, but this one was quite a ways from my wheelhouse."
"D - This is perfectly drinkable and would be nice to serve at a party where some of your guests enjoy beer, but don't take it too seriously."
"The one thing the beer has going for it is that carbonation is in the right place. The beer is bready and nutty, a thin watery midbody quickly gives way to a spicey, zesty aftertaste with a kick like the smell. To me, it's sour in a bad way. This flavor just lingers. No depth or bearing at all in the mouthfeel, it's like a light-beer. It's got too much watery lager in it to be a quality beer in my opinion, and what else is left is that semi-rancid kick in the teeth. It's like it's strong in the wrong places, and weak in the wrong places alike for the style. Drinkability is inoffensive save for what I've already mentioned. I definitely won't be seeking this out. Tastes like a weak lager, not a malty doppelbock."
"M + D: A little bit of stickiness, but again, not as rich as many others. It's got a good feel of carbonation and a slight, albeit delayed dryness on the finish. Not a bad beer at all, though I'd lean more towards enjoying it as its own thing rather than trying to pile it into the style, as I'd be more likely to lean towards other doppelbocks. Worth a try, though, and I had found it at a reasonably good price."
"Pours a very clear pale yellow color body, with a huge white creamy head, diminishing. Very sweet fruity aroma, like a fruit cocktail. Some nuttiness too. Some light apples and grapes, light fruit aromas. Effervescent. Some nuts too, like hazelnut or something. Carbonated slightly nutty taste, some alcohol. Lots of light fruit. Some maltiness and nuttiness present. Lots of flavor. Not too bad tasting. Banana taste. A little too sweet for my taste. Hotter as it warms up."
"Taste is rather unexciting. Sweet grains and dry malts. That's about it. Has a rather unpleasant hint of corn. Tastes like an amped up malt liquor. What in the world makes this a dopplebock? Watery feel. This one is a struggle to finish."
"D- This beer has a smooth great flavor with a great freshness to the grain and a good balance between the malt and hops. This beer drinks very easy."
"D - Great overall. Very easy drinking for an imperialish helles, yet complex enough for the beer connoisseur. Never had anything like this brew."
"Interesting and successful take on the style that is very crisp, drinkable, and packs plenty of flavor. Lacks the malt flavor that other examples have but the flavors that are present really shine. Well balanced and delicious."
"Overall, good interpretation of a blond doppelbock. Not remarkable. But would definitely buy again."
"Drinkability: I just finished the 22 oz bottle, and at 8%, I don't think I'll open another one. It's decent, but it doesn't seem like a Doppelbock."
"Comes out of the tap a nice clear amber with a decent white head. Aroma is mainly malty with a strong hoppy undertone and a sharp hint of apple, like hard cider. Flavor is malty and ciderish with a strong but not overwhelming alcohol nip and just a touch of honey sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and it fairly dances on the way down."
"Good job, Abita."
"D: This is a really nice strong lager, not overly alcoholic at all. Harkens to the Eastern European strong lager, a style that is drinkable and high gravity, good job by Abita."
"Taste like a very light dopplebock. Clean smooth taste with a bubbly finish. You can barely taste the alcohol. Good balance between the malt and hops."
"Medium carbonation but this seemed fairly watered down. Didn't feel like 8% at first but the more I drank, the more of an alcoholic bite I could feel developing in the background. I should probably try the bottled version but I've never had a good enough experience with this on tap to even want to bother. The bottled Abbey Ale was good so maybe I'll give Andy another shot sometime. I'm think I'm done with this on draft though."
"Really good atmosphere. Pleasant but not overpowering nose. Complex, balanced flavor. Hefty feel, but not overwhelming. Really solid quaff."
"The drinkability belies the 8% abv listed on the bottle. A bit of a velvet hammer. Stylish beer. Smooth, dirnkable and satisfying - if not overly flavorful."
"Overall a pretty good beer, but it should be defined as an imperial pilsner and not a helles dopplebock."
"I think some of the dislike of this one comes from the confusion around which style it actually is. It's not a Doppelbock, that's for sure. I'd say it's a strong Maibock. Not the best, but it's not a bad beer at all. Crisp malts and a dab of assertive hops. Worth a try."
"This poured out to be quite a good looking beer, with pale golden body, three finger thick head, and excellent clarity. That being said, it looked nothing like a typical Dopplebock, but since it's a Helles version of it, I'd let that slide. The smell was sweet honey, banana, bubblegum. and aged Cheddar like hops, in other words, far more typical of a Belgian Pale Ale than a bock. The taste was delicate, sweet, and well balanced. I could detect fruits in the form of banana, pear, and pineapple, but they were mostly fleeting in nature. I was most surprised by the spicy and relatively aggressive hop character. This is something that one would not expect in a Dopplebock, much less in one from Abita. This was certainly not liquid bread for lent, but it was deliciously made, so I overlooked all the non traditional aspects of the taste. Light and runny on the palette, and not much heft to indicate the potency of this beer. If you can cope with something unexpected, and take it how effective it is versus what you expected it to be, this beer might do it for you."
"Needs more pizzazz."
"Overall there's nothing overly exciting about this beer, but it goes down easily - a middle-of-the-road beer from Abita."
"We soon went by the Bulldog on Magazine in New Orleans. I had the Andygator on draft, my what a killer brew. Great taste, beautiful color. Lovely, just lovely."
"D - I was no fan of this on tap, nor am I a fan of this in the bottle. There is only one characteristic that tells me that this is not malt liquor, and I can get blazed with something much better, although this was relatively cheap (again, malt liquor-like)"
"Drinkability: really got tired of the beer quickly, and I rarely want more than one pint."
"Notes from and tasted on 1/08/08."
"Rumor has it Abita will be bottling this beer for the first time ever shortly."
"Overall I am not sure how this one is a barley wine. It is way too light as far as I am concerned, but thats fine, still though it was nice to try it and thats about all."
"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear gold with a two-finger white head. Decent retention and fairly nice lacing. Smells sugary sweet, grainy and a hint of alcohol. Off-putting. Taste is similar; sweetness that's really unmatched by anything else in the brew, making it fairly unbalanced. Grainy malt again, with some citric notes and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side, but not horrible. It's like all of the negative characteristics that one can find in a cheap lager have been cranked up to 11. The worst beer Abita makes."
"Overall- Actually quite easy to drink an tasty. I can't really see it being a barleywine though. Regardless tasty and refreshing while I attemt to frame my basement. (Thanks Jason!)"
"i hope the guy i send it to digs it as i did."
"I ordered this at the Abita Brew Pub. It has a golden appearance with a thin white head. The smell is a little sweet, faint hops. It tastes somewhat spicy with hops and grains. There is a certain bite to it--likely because of the relatively high ABV--dry with a lot of carbonation, watery. Overall, not that drinkable. I'll order something else the next time I'm in Abita."
"This is lighter in body than I expected and as long as it is cold, has decent mouthfeel. Andy Gator is a simple beer, dry finished and honestly, perfect for those high humidity Louisiana summer days!"
"Overall, it's a good beer and worth a shot if you ever have the chance."
"Still not sure what I drank. Looks like there is speculation of either doppel or barleywine. I didnt get the impression that it was either. A rather dissapointing beer from Abita."
"D: It doesn't seem to be very high in ABV and it has decent mouthfeel but the taste is just not right. I won't be having another one."
"Served to me as clear, orange-ish, with a 1-finger head. The smell was faint, but pleasant. I could get plenty of sweet smells, sugar and fruit. It almost smelled like apple juice. I found the the taste to be complex, but light on the tongue and subtle. There was definately the fruit and sugar, but it also had some floral and grassy hops and a slight presence of the malts. The beer finished with a tiny bitter buzz that still left the palate wet. Amazingly, even though the overall taste was quite subtle, I could taste no trace of alcohol in this 8% beverage: very impressive. The beer was well carbonated with a thin mouthfeel. Overall, I was quite pleased with this beer. It was refreshing, like drinking a tall, cool glass of well-flavored water. It was as thin and easy to drink as a session beer, but it quickly leaves you lightheaded."
"Had it on tap at the Chimes. Nice light gold color with not much of a head. Smell was flowery and sweet. Taste was malty and finished salty. Almost overpowering taste that got better as I drank more. Mouthfeel was nice, not too runny, not to thick. A nice drinking beer. I will definitely have another."
"Comment: A solid beer that I would enjoy trying again. To date I believe it is only available in kegs....I hope Abita bottles this little gem. I do agree that I would not class it as a doppelbock. It has characteristics of a Belgium pale ale."
"Had on draft at the Brewpub in Abita Springs, LA. Abita calls this a barleywine and not a doppelbock that it is listed as on this site. Nice smooth taste and dry finish. Seemed to hide its alcohol content very well. Not the best Abita beer that I've had, wouldnt go out of my way to seek it out, but not bad."
"Drinkability- It wasn't bad. I guess it doesn't travel well after reading the other reviews."
"Came to me on tap from the Greenroom (formerly Froggy's [RIP]) in a translucent plastic cup. Lights were kind of low, but it poured a sickly malt liquorish brassed-orange body with no head. Nose is all grain, sugar and alcohol. There is some weird estery thing going on too. The nose is really the same in the flavor here, but the sweetness ended up being much worse than I had expected. The phenols or esters or whatever the hell was going on with this beer come out way too much also. Lots of medicinal alcohol. Mouthfeel is slick, syrupy, prickly, and tongue-coating. I finished the cup, but only because I'm cheap."
"This beer poured a a clear straw color with a quickly diminishing head. The smell is sweet and a bit floral. The taste is sweet and floral. It is very well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth and full but not heavy. These characteristics hide the hight alcohol content of this beer  which is very drinkable."
"First off this is not a doppelbock in any way shape or form not even close its a strong malt liquor beer that will kick you in the teeth.Poured a dull light golden with a thinner white head that doesnt last to long,whoo the alcohol is there in the nose for sure along with some toasted malt but the sweet alcohol is more prevelant than anything.Just not in to the flavors of this malt licka starts out pretty sweet the somewhat watery mouthfeel does not hold up to the big sweetness at the start of this beer melding into a grainy,alcoholic burn into the finish.Eh the flavors are just to wicked for me to sweet and to much of a burn,I guess for malt licka its ok but I stay away from that shite."
"As mentioned this one is easy to drink, it's just not overly drinkable. It's not bad, but it just can't decide what it wants to be or where it wants to go."
"Recommended."
"Not sure why this is listed as retired - I had it on tap at a place in Destin, FL. Also not sure why it is listed as a doppel - if anything it is a bock. Poured a amber-chestnut with nominal head. Mildly malty and nutty, with some sugary notes wafting in toward the end. Alcohol added a touch of pepper, but overall the beer was wanting in the flavor department - needed some punch somewhere in the flavor profile that never came through."
"This beer is listed on BA as a dopple, above the bar at the Abita Brewpub as a barleywine, and in the Abita Brewpub's menu as a ""continental malt liquor"". So really what is this? Served in a small chalice. The color is light golden, head is very small. The aroma is sweet and beery. Pretty much a richer version of the smell in a standard malt liquor. The taste is most reminiscent of a malt liquor, I really can't see this being classified as a barley wine or a dopplebock. A flavorful light malt taste is backed by subtle hops. A mild taste of alcohol is in the finish. Basically, I'd consider this a craft beer version of malt liquor. I'd drink this again, but Abita has plenty of beers I'd rather have."
"Surprisingly pale gold with not a lot of head at all. A faint bit of apples in the aroma and a bit of sweetened straw malt. The flavor is low on bitterness, lightly sweet with a little malt character and that apple flavor. Its really a boring beer and far from the best doppelbocks available."
"I had this on tap at the Abita Brew Pub in Abita springs. The bar wench called this a barleywine, but by appearances and taste I would say it's closer in style to a Strong Belgian Ale. It's not a bad beer, but when you have your mouth set on Barleywine, it's a shock when you take your first drink."
"This can't be a dopplebock. The bar listed it as a barleywine, but it's barely anything at all. A light honey yellowish color with a fine, light fizzy head that disappears quickly. There is absolutely no aroma, and the flavor is ever so faint. Flavor is mostly sweet apple and pear, a bit of an alcohol sweetness, and some lingering fruit in the finish. That is it. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, a little fizzy tingle in the finish. Pretty disappointing."
"I just was not impressed by this beer."
"It's supposed to be between 8% and 11% ABV"
"Very smooth mouthfeel which is again a testimony to the brewer. Nice beer and much better than most offerings in the Crescent City."
