"This isn't as bad as I was expecting. Had they gone with the ""Maibock"" moniker, I could have avoided such dread!  It's hoppier on the front, but has nice maltiness behind it all.  The transition into the maltier profile is quite pleasant. Don't let the label fool you, this is pretty good."

"Pours a light gold color. White fuzzy head retains decently well. Aroma of sweet malts and a distant bready note. In the taste, sweet malt and honey like notes. Reminiscent of a blonde, stronger honey brown lager. Medium bodied, well carbonated brew. Overall, not a bad golden bock here. Quite drinkable."

"A light and delicate bock with emphasis on the malt flavors. Mostly light bread/biscuit flavors with a barely perceptible hop presence in the nose. Hops do peak out near the finish. Doesn't seem to meet the maibock description as far as hop presence goes, but still easily drinkable and pleasant."

"O: has an excellent sweet malty flavor but lacks in other areas, good domestic example of the style"

"O: an average quality lager, albeit with more flavor and alcohol."

"O: not a bad beer, I think I might have this again."
"o - decent beer but very malt forward and missing some key style elements, mainly the hops and noticeable alcohol content. totally worth the $.91 i paid for it."
""
"The body was OK, full and smooth, not heavy, but a bit sticky. Drinkability was OK, the stickiness and alcohol taste were a bit off-putting. Overall, an average example, not great, not terrible. Try it or don't."
"Nice taste. smooth on the finish.. A nice taste all the way through. Just came off the beach.. and this fit perfect. Lots of flavor for such a light color brew. I was very impressed with the Bock. I will definitey try again. I'm actually washing down some snyders Hot Buffalo Wing pretzels with it.. and it is perfect!! Cheers!"
"3.58/5.00"

"O- I was pleasantly surprised by this one."
"Medium bodied, very smooth and slightly dry. Some nice biscuit and toast that is balanced out by a peppery spice flavor that works very well with the crisp semi-dry mouthfeel. A good execution of the style and a refreshing beer."
""

"D: A nice balanced lager. Nothing bold or complex, but tasty enough. Very approachable & carries its abv extremely well. It seems more like a 5% beer. Way nicer than the usual macro swill & excellent for the price point."

"O- this beer is cheap, which makes it a decent bargain. Still, nothing special at all."
"12 oz bottle as part of a Dundee sampler 12 pack...decent light brown color. Fairly well balanced to the hop tilt in the nose...good for the style. Taste is respectable, clean, light but malty. Could improve on the yeast character, which is very light. I've noticed in general about Dundee's German style beers that they are clean and drinkable but don't have much delicious yeast funk. Mouthfeel is clean. Overall decent and the 12 pack was only $10, so it was very reasonable."
"The head on this beer was 1 and a half fingers thick in a glass mug. It left long wide strands of lacing. There was a moderate amount of carbonation. The color was amber. I could read the label on the beer through the full mug. It had a nicely ballanced hoppy and malty smell. The mouth feel was somewhat creamy with a sticky afterfeel. There was a slightly sour aftertaste."
"Yup, another gift from my brother. This one pours a clear jaundiced canary topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises dusty biscuit, light toffee, light orange zest, mild flowers, and grass. The taste picks up the fruit baton and bolts, emphasizing the erstwhile mousy orange and adding some light lemon zest, light melon, and a heaping helping of banana. There's also a decent amount of caramel, lightly buttered biscuits, light black pepper, and even a pinch of clove. It's all a bit much all of a sudden, and it all sorta disappears at the end, but it's not at all bad. The body is a rather light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a nearly drying finish. Overall, not a bad helles bock by any stretch. I'll admit, I'm a bit surprised by it, as it's nothing special to look at and keeps some shady company, but I'll never turn down a beer like this."
"Smooth mouthfeel, and a way better than the mainstream lagers, I would get this one again without reservation. It's not from Belgium or brewed in a castle but it sure is an excellent choice on a hot summer day."
"Its an earthy floral type of hop taste as well like one you'd get in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Actually this reminds me of a Samuel Adams beer... which to me is a good thing. I can tell this has a thicker and creamy feel to it than their other beers simply because its a lager. This tells me they know how to make a good lager. Get this beer in their mix packs. Dundee again makes some of the cheapest best craft beer I've had."
"O: Fits the maibock bill, but doesn't excel anywhere. I'd rather have a Boss Tom's from local brewer Boulevard, but that's a seasonal."
"It is good and definitely worth trying, but don't expect anything off the charts. in terms of the overall blending, it tastes alright, but certain aspects of the beer's composition, flavor, and body could be better."
"This beer poured out as a nice golden color, the head was fizzy and white but not too bad. The smell of the beer has a nice aroma of malts and caramel. The taste of the beer is toasted and has plenty of malts. The mouthfeel is pretty good, nice body and a carbonation. Overall not a bad beer at all really. Pretty surprising."
"Another beer left at my house by someone. This one pours golden with a thin head. A constant stream of tiny bubbles. Nice enough aromas of caramel and toasty malt, a bit on the sweet side. The taste actually starts out quite nice, with more of that caramel and malt flavors, some toastiness, and a somewhat bready sweetness, but it falls off a bit towards the end. Nicely carbonated, but a bit too sweet. Not bad."
"Overall- This is an easy drinker and tastes like its <5% ABV but the 6.2% really sneaks up on you. I recommend giving this a try. Its not the greatest beer by any means but it is different, drinkable and worth the effort."
"O-this is a fairly harsh beer. definitely is not something i'll be wanting again. this one really has nothing going on for it. its not completely disgusting though."
"Again a generally malt flavor, semi-sweet, some carmel is hinted at, but its not cloying. Hopped enough to give good balance and improve its overall feel. Nice clean finish."
"It's a refreshing beer and one of those that would be great while eating with your favorite food."
"Pours a clear, lite-golden. A small, white head patches the glass. Many slow carb trailers. Looks good. Smell is a clean, honey-biscuity malt. Smells good. Taste is a smooth, toasted malt with a carbonated, bitter finish. A bit of mineral as well. Definitely balanced more toward the malts, though. Reminiscent of a marzen. A decent drinker, my 2nd favorite of the craft sampler."
"Overall - Pale in color, but it delivers in flavor. I like it."
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this. I got the sampler pack and by far this was the best one of the bunch."
"The two fingers' worth of head looked like a French Vanilla ice cream cone. It was big, rocky and with excellent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow of a shade that would have made Midas envious and with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty sweet, just as advertised. Mouthfeel was big and full with a honey-like taste on the tongue. Finish was silky smooth and even somewhat dry, as though the fermentation had fully converted the available sugars. This was entirely smooth, to the point that half of it was gone and I was barely aware of it. I would not want a steady diet of it, nor would it be very appropriate in the summer, but on a chilly evening in early March with Spring just a few weeks away, it was perfect."
"Pours a clear copper with one finger of white foam with good retention. Aromas are typical maibock: predominantly sweet, grainy, maybe a hint of caramel, little in the way of hops. First thing I notice is not the taste but the body, which is considerably heftier than I expected. Comes across as medium-full, and this would be a good thing if only the flavors had the strength to keep pace. Unfortunately, the flavors are highly subdued. Tastes of lightly sweet grains with maybe a hint of woodiness; neither note is strong enough to be appreciated or warrant further contemplation. Overall: not bad but uninteresting."
"D - I like Bocks, and this one rocks (I was a poet and didn't know it!) Yet another highly drinkable beer from Dundee. For the money, this is very impressive. I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the Dundee brews I've tried, and this is no exception."
"D: A very nice beer, very drinkable, either for a one-beer night or as a session beer. Plus, the price is pretty good, which is also appealing."
"I'm very impressed and mildly surprised by this 89 cent brewski."
"I was impressed with this one, it's light but full of flavor."
"impressed for a dundee brew others besides the flagship honey brown have failed to get my jollies off"
"A solid beer at a great price. Hopefully I'll enjoy the rest of my mixed 12 pack from Dundee."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild,malty, a touch sweet. Taste is good, malts with a touch of hops, not overly flavorful but tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall a good quality beer."
"Started out great and kind of fizzled towards the end, but for Genesee Breweing Co. a step in the right direction. Since Dundee is a brand that many trust, due to Honey Brown fame, and with this new profile of craft-style brews could act similar to Sam Adams in converting BMCers to craftdom."
"D - Highly drinkable; year round."
" ~ This is a brew that holds up fine in all character aspects. It doesn't have an overwhelming greatness in any aspect but it is certainly a drinkable brew. This is one built for sessions."
"This was a well balanced beer that I felt was a good example of the style. It was balanced, refreshing, and had a nice crisp taste to it. Not much aftertaste to it, and went down pretty easily, could have easily had a couple of these in an evening. It was a thirst-quencher for sure."
"D- Very easy to drink, just boring."
"D - I'm not a fan of either the nose or the flavor, but it drinks like a 4%, not a 6% so I have to give it credit for that. Not something I'll drink again, but it is not undrinkable."
"Nice head retention in this maibock. Not enough maibocks out there these days and that's a shame. Good biscuity flavor with a very dry finish. The copper color is a treat to the eye, for sure. I think the one thing this beer comes down to is the hops. It's a very hoppy beer, with a warm finish. It's a pale, so it's naturally a little bitter. If you like them hoppy, this is a clean, dry beer that you could really make an evening out of."
"Good two finger head over a slightly cloudy brew that equates to a 7 in color on the SRM beer color chart. Impressive clinging lace with a tight cling. Aroma of apple, caramel, orange, peach, cinnamon, and malt. Flavors of green apple, orange and lime peal, caramel, green tea, and mild hops. Sort of patchy feeling in my mouth. Not bad at all, good for another round and to share with friends."
"D: It's not bad, but it isn't really anything more than a pale shadow of a great German lager."
"Overall, this is an inoffensive but not outstanding beer."
"A very tastey brew with a nice hops finish. Plenty of foam from the pour from the bottle to the pint glass. Drinkability and flavor rate real high. Goldenrod in color with a slight haziness. Mouthfeel was on the lighter side and the smell of pale roasty malts. Very good brew, I liked it the best out of the gift pack."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is very fruity. I also get a lot of wheat and bubblegum notes in the aroma. The flavor is grapes, fruit and caramel malt. Not bad overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the better Dundee beers I have tried."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Refreshing like most lagers and sweet."
"Drinks nicely and offers just enough flavor to keep interest. I could enjoy a couple of these with ease. A nice brew."
"In my opinion, brewery wise, this is one of the best dundee beers iive tried"
"It has a great bronze body with about a finger and a half of nice white froth head. The head and lace both have some nice staying power. The aroma malty with some secondary hops aromas emitting. It has a traditional taste. This beer is mildly hopped, malty and roasted. It has a mouthfeel that is on the upper end of light."
"D- Dundee is a home run for their ""teachable moment"" of craft brews. Pale Bock Lager is so tasty. I highly recommend it"
"Middle of the above average road. Delicious if your used to budweiser, but not follwing a dfh ipa."
"D: Interesting beer, nothing fancy, just a bit too sweet. Still worth a try."
"Nothing complex, nothing for the über beer snobs, but this is one damn good Maibock. This could easily be a mainstay on our beer fridge year-round."
"I say about this beer what I'll say about all of Dundee's beers: If you want to teach someone about beer, by some Dundee styles and train them on what are simple examples of the various styles. This beer reminds me of a ""dumbed"" down Shiner Bock."
"All in all, not a bad beer. One of the better ones out of the variety pack I bought."
"D: Nice, clean yet with complex and deep flavors."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a very light, translucent copper with a loose, one inch bright white head - a little light-colored for the style. Head eventually settles into a broken skim with some thin bands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Definitely smells like a Maibock - toasted malt, light fruity esters and a trace of toffee and biscuit notes. Taste is somewhat bland - a little bit of citrus comes across and drowns out the light fruit in the nose. A little bit of malt comes across the backbone, but the toasted quality and biscuity notes drop off. There is a hint of caramel that lingers at the finish, but it ends all too clean. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to the light side of the spectrum) with a crisp carbonation. Goes down easy, but there are definitely betters examples of the style."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and not much lacing. Aroma of caramel malt is quiet simple though pleasant. Taste is dominated by balanced caramel malt with good sweetness level. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad though not much in terms of complexity."
"Good flavor, good alcohol, I could go for another."
"D: Nothing offensive and it goes down easily. Again, like the Kolsch, nothing particularly impresses me about it."
"D - Well I have a few more and it wasn't that bad. Definitely drinkable and good tasting."
"Calm and clear golden colored brew. Small white head tops it off. Some lace. Clean lagered malt scent. Light pale malt, some bittering hop. Pretty clean bodied, somewhat acidic but not too much. This certainly isnt a bad beer, its a nice refreshing light beer."
"pours a transparent copper color with good white head that recedes very quickly. good lacing, and soft carbonation. caramel malty smell, and taste is the same with slight lemon hints. light body and thin texture. short flavor duration. moderately bitter and finish the same way. decent brew."
"Grainy sweet with a decent creamy body and a hint of caramel. Hops are vacant in the flavor as well, making this pretty one dimensional...but actually manages to be one of the better Dundee series beers. Not much toast compared to most golden bocks. Mouthfeel is ample, if unremarkable. Not mind blowing in any way, but a decent summer slurper."
"Taste is light and crisp, assertive carbonation, all sweet malt with this one, not much flavor but considering it's over 6%, not a bad beer for a day in the summer, just don't expect much though."
"A touch of sweetness up front. Rather dry at the swallow where some bittering hop shows up. The aftertaste dies off faster than one would expect. The body is as expected."
"D: A nice and easy drinking beer, but the flavors do not call back for more."
"D: I could actually take down about 2-3 of these. Not much more. Depends on what is going on. I would drink this while doing yard work...or possibly while viewing Beer Advocate!"
"I guess some may like this simly because it won't offend the masses, but to me this is seriously lacking in the flavor department."
"Clear golden color with a very thin white head. There's not a lot going on in the scent. Some grainy sweetness and a touch of caramel and peanut butter. Has a buttery taste, kinda like toast slathered in butter. There's also some grassy notes. Pretty carbonated, but it's not biting. I really like the feel, but the taste just rubs me the wrong way. Realize, however, that this is not one of may favorite styles."
"D - Well another let down from Dundee to me. I wouldn't drink another, so to me, I don't think it's drinkable, mainly because Ive had many of the Dundee beers, and again again I get these nasty medicinal tasting, ugly colored, fizzy feel beers! Not recommended."
"Big and Malty, not so much really. Compared to Bud Light, sure."
"this one is one of my least favorite out of the variety 12 pack. i never was really a fan of bock beers to begin with, there are a couple good ones i enjoy, but this is far from one of them. its just too bland. its easy to drink and session, but i wouldnt want to. nor would i ever really want to drink this again. avoid it, avoid dundee all together."
"Cheers!"
"Another pleasant surprise from Genesee. Part of a $10 12 pack. Poured a medium copper with a small head. Smell was mainly malt. Taste exceeded smell...rich smooth maltiness that was very drinkable. Mouthfeel was rich and satisfying. Could easily quaff more than one. Once again, a very pleasant surprise...excellent value."
"Nothing really to complain about, although I would like a wee bit more hoppiness in there. If you're just getting into craft beer, or weening someone off BMC, this is a good beer to start with."
"Poured from the bottle this had a large head with no lacing, it was a very clear light amber color and looked dead. The smell was pretty boring however I could pick up some of the malts. This beer had very little flavor, no balance and no finish. The mouthfeel was off, I think it was too carbonated. Overall it was not impressive and not something I would buy again."
"D- too sweet for me to have more than one of. there are also plenty of better and more interesting versions of this style out there. i probably wont be going back to it."
"This ties with Dundee's Porter for best beer in their multi-pack."
"Good drinkability. I have to think quick and write fast because the beer is disappearing quicker than I can review it."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Poured a slightly rusted gold with a inch's worth of eggshell-white head. Retained fairly well; left little lace. Scents of honey, biscuits, grits, and a touch of floral hops. The body was crisp and sharp. Carbonation level was a bit high. Nice mellow bready flavors in this. Some mild bitterness; finished sweet and oh-so malty. This was a surprise. Probably my favorite Dundee beer to-date."
"Decent atmosphere. Appearance is okay, but nothing to write home about. Nose is a really nice combination of tones. Flavor has a nice combination of sweet and bitter components. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
"Overall-I dig this beer, it's a little different but the flavors work and I'd have another. Good to see this departure from the nrm."
"Value: Excellent. I paid less than $11.00 for a 12-pack sampler which included an IPA, a Porter, a wheat beer and a few others. For that price, why not?"
" Never had a pale bock before so I can't draw comparisons to anything there but it's a fairly drinkable, basic lager that I'd gladly choose over more common read ""macro"" brews."
"Pours a clear orange color with 2 fingers of yellowish head. As the bubbles crack and pop, the head receeds and is already lacing. Nose is slightly hoppy and sulfuric with the malt. Tate is all malt with a grainy/biscuit taste but is clean and crisp. Picking up on some buttery notes in the finish. Overall it is worthwhile, but nothing outstanding. I proceed this review with caution because of the vast differences in brewer interpretation on the style of maibock so take it for what it's worth: ""pale bock"""
"As I mentioned, this is quite decidedly a lager, and it's one of the better entries in the Dundee sampler pack from which it seems most people have gained access to their beers."
"Economical beer, good cross-over."
"just drank it but forgot to take notes. all around, well above average. bock is a favorite for me (aside from hopbombs) so this was no exception. crisp golden color, nice malty nose, taste stays consistent with everything else. actually tastes better after about 5 minutes of warming up (on this cool october day....i'd keep it cold in warmer times)...good carbonation. definitely a session drinker as most of this variety 12-pack delivers. except for the honey brown..."
"Id have to say it an all around good beer"
"Poured into a tall pilsner glass. Very high 2"" head. Color was a yellowy-orange. Smells of grass and malt. Taste of cedar and woodsy flavor. Detect notes of pine and florals. Definitely above-average drinkability. Very good session beer. Would go great with chicken or pork."
"Overall, this beer is pretty drinkable. Its not my favorite bock, but things seem to have a decent enough balance to keep me interested."
"Overall: Definitely not a bland beer"
"pours a honey color with little over a finger off white head. fades quickly to a ring on the glass sparse little spots of lace. smells sweet, light caramel and slight metalic note to it. taste is sweet a little to sweet for me. mostly all malt no hop bite to balance it out. light mouthfeel and light carbonation. a long way from my first pick at the beer store."
"Ok so... hits with a big malty sweet character that is a little too sweet and cloying so far. A slight bitterness that was hiding in the nose makes up a decent amount of tail end of this. This is good but average, but at the price, this can still be a sound buy."
"The best part about this brew would have to be the price factor. You can get it for abou 5.99 to 6.99 a six. That and the fact that it is a decent helles bock. Pours bright straw colored golden with bright white creamy textured head, leaves behind specks of scattered lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma has a touch of citrus and some fruity phenols mostly a bit of green apple, with other cereal notes peeking through. Grassy herbal hops in the background pretty muted. Flavor a sweet honey coated biscuit malt profile with some rough graininess and harsh metallic notes. There's a rounded touch of green apple tartness flowing with some of those herbal hops I mentioned. Mouthfeel is medium bodied especially for a lager, carbonation was inoffensive nothing big to report here. Definitely more balanced nothing cloyingly sweet, overall impression is that it's a decent regional brewed bock bier that I have no plans of drinking regularly. I remember enjoying this more when I bought a sampler of the Dundee with the new labels."
"these beers aren't bad, but most are missing that extra kick that would make it really good beer. the bottle advertised itself as big and malty, but not so much. pretty unassertive and average across the board."
"D- If i could ever have this without the rust flavor I think this would be a better beer. Actually I think Dundee if they upped their game a little would be a not bad brewery to drink a little better than average beers from. But hey we can't wish for everything right?"
"Unfortunately, Pale Bock Lager is par for the Dundee course. On a positive note, it favors the upper end of the GBC range in terms of quality. Fans of the style might want to give it a look, but this single bottle is enough for me."
"D - Once again, another decent beer from Dundee. Nothing crazy or worth seeking out, but not disapointing."
"Drinkability: Far from my favorite style, Dundee has done a surprisingly nice job here"
"Overall - this dundee 12 pack is seeming more and more average every time. Kind of unfortunate, really."
"Note: I bought a variety pack (12 pack/2 of 6 varieties) of these Dundee beers and besides the Porter and maybe the Honey Brown there was little difference in taste and smell. While not bad, they are definitely nothing special and I was dissappointed in the fact that there was little defining characteristics between the types."
"Drinkability: Drinkable in mass quantities and if you like soda water"
"This is actually a very good Helles Bock. Light and drinkable with all the qualities of the style."
"A surprisingly delicate, well-crafted Heller Bock that nails the style right on the head. Quite quaffable and very tasty. A wonderful addition to the Dundee craft pack, and a superb American interpretation of this wonderful German seasonal specialty."
"I didn't know Dundee made a bock lager, so I gave it a try. It poured into the glass to reveal a light honey color. The aroma was quite mild and malty sweet. The taste was also mildly sweet with a hint of honey and consistent throughout. The mouthfeel was thicker than the appearance suggested."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of light bready malt, light caramel, and moderate spicy noble hops. It is a very nice aroma, but a little too faint. If it had just a little more pizazz to it I would be mighty impressed. As is it is okay. The taste is a little more malty than the aroma, and the breadiness is gone. There is more caramel. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is an alright beer. I could drink it again, but I would put it on the top of my list."
"D - It's not bad for a hellesbock. I think by calling it ""Big and Malty"" they set themselves up for disappointed drinkers because it falls short of the tag line; however, I'm pleased to say that for a ""cheaper bock", I could drink it all night."
"D - Extremely good beer to sit down and enjoy. If it wasn't for the high alcohol content, I'd go as far to say as sessionable."
"Update 6-19-09: Went back to Yankee, Pale Bock Lager was GONE, and they'd had a whole stack of 24-btl cases. Someone out there knew a good thing..."
"drinkability is ok - again these beers are not mind blowing but a step in the right direction for those wanting more then macro lights"
"D: This is an easy drinking brew, but not very flavorful. I was suprised to taste a beer so light with a relatively high ABV. Not bad, but there are certainly better maibocks out there."
"D: Pretty good."
"Don't drink and review."
"drinkability: okay. I didn't regret having it, but not one I'll be coming back to soon."
"Pours a rather yellowish color with a good dolup of carbonation. No head on this mother and it also is a little light in the nose department. Overall this beer seems to be slightly light, there is not a great deal of visual, nasal, or taste bud stimulation going on. Not terrible, but not something that I would ever buy and truly enjoy drinking."
"This is my first Helles Bock. While not my favorite style it is worth a visit or two!"
"I'm not that familiar with pale bocks, but this had a nice grainy taste to it, average body with a bit of sweetness to it. Has a heavyness to it from an alcohol standpoint. Very solid."
"would actually better serve as an American Blonde Lager???"
"Overall, I didn't hate the beer, I thought it went down very smooth and had a good drinkability factor but didn't do much for me."
"Overall: A good beer, but I was expecting more from a Bock."
"Dr. It's flavorful, easy, mild, and could go again and again."
"Drink is better than average I was kind of suprised by the 6.2% ABV. As it did not taste even that heavy."
"Medium bodied, fairly smooth and drinkable. Worth a try."
"Taste follows the nose with a malty start and a brief lingering finish of malt, spice and a bit of hops. Decent tingly carbonation fits the beer well. Drinkability is hindered a bit by the finish which is both drying initially and a bit simple sweet in the homestretch. A decent brew and an interesting style that delivers that bock flavor without the rich malt body and structure."
"Has the guts to be a maibock but misses the mark on several points with it's flaws."
"From bottle no.4123315081508 and sampled on Feb. 21, 2009. Th pour is a clear golden-yellow with a decent off-white head that shrinks in a few minutes but never quite goes away. The first sensation on the nose is alcohol followed by the malts. But with the taste it is the other way around with malty elements followed by a sour alcohol chase. But altogether a fairly nice brew."
"Would be a good beer for a outdoor spring bbq"
"Pours to a thin white head and crystal-clear dark gold color. Aroma is sweet and malty with hints of hops and alcohol. Flavor is a very smooth combination of pale malts and a bit of hop flavor and bitterness. Barely enough bitter to offset the sweet. Finishes sweet and a bit sticky but it is not unpleasant or cloying, oddly enough. Mouthfeel is reminiscent of cream ale. I personally enjoyed this beer but it is not a technical masterpiece. Great price, too."
"I'm not sure if this is a style I don't really understand or if there's something off about this batch, but this is the weakest of the otherwise perfectly drinkable brews in the Dundee pack. I drank it down, hoping it would start to taste better, and it wasn't hard to glug down the last few ounces when I wasn't paying as much attention. Like most macros, not hard to get down when it goes from glass to stomach in just a second or two. Maybe next time I save this for last instead of starting with it."
"Hmm. Not sure what happened on this one. Nice color, smelled OK but got some off taste I couldn't place. Definitely malty. Mouthfeel was OK and drinkability rated low for me since I wasn't too into the taste. Might have to try another one to see what happened. I usually like Dundee so maybe I just got a bad one."
"Basically, this is a slightly off being great Maibock. It could be great, but it's not. But it's also not terrible. So I'll keep drinking it."
"This bock lost some of its head when I opened the bottle, totally my fault. The pour was clear and golden. Seemed to have a good balance of maltiness and hoppiness without a bitter finish. The body seemed seemed a bit light on the palate to me. Before I complain that the beer is not very complex and a bit light for a bock, I need to remember that this craft pack scores at under a dolla a bottle. Maybe this beer needs to move up on some value rating."
"Overall an excellent beer. Reminds me a lot of Shiner Bock. If you are a fan of Shiner Bock I definitely recommend this beer."
"D: I'd have more then one."
"i liked this...it was simple but tasty. i wish breweries had a way to make bocks along these lines for the masses (canned) at a reasonable price."
"The taste is too average for me to want much of this. It would be good with spicey food, but by itself it's pretty average."
"This beer poured a copper color with a single-finger head. The smell is sweet malt, with some caramel. The taste starts off with some sweet biscuity malt that gives way to some pretty unagressive hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with slight carbonation. Not a bad beer, but not what I'd consider a great example of the style."
"I don't know that I sit down with a session of these, but I wouldn't be upset if I had to."
"Drinkability: I though this was a tasty beer that had it's good qualities and some not so good qualities. The color of this one throws me off, almost looks like a light beer. And the thickness for such a malty brew is too wet, besides that, this is a pretty robust bock that I wouldn't mind having again."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall- Mild and light on flavor. Alc. is very present for a %6?! A decent offering."
"Pours a clear, light amber color. 1/2 inch head with good retention and slight lacing. Smells of fruit, sweet malt, and some hops. I guess it fits the style, though pale bock is an odd nomenclature. Tastes of hops up front with the strong lager background. The aftertaste is of some sweet malts. Fairly smooth with low carbonation. Mostly hops and strong lager taste overall. Not a bad beer, but not a stand out either."
"A pretty average Helles Bock with a few pleasantries and flaws. Not one I'll go back to; however, better than expected from what I remember of the JW Dundees family."
"D: Not bad for a social event. Not something I'd seek out."
"(rated Jul 22, 2008)"
"Not a bad beer this is one that I could see myself drinking in the future as far as it goes, my second time with Dundee beers. I had the Honey wheat beer, and was not that impressed with it. I did try to get the sampler pack but it broke on the way out of the store."
"D: If you are looking for a high quality micro-brew then you will be disappointed, but it is better than average at its price-range. A good football game beer."
"Deep golden with a big fizzy white head. Smell some sweet grain with a hint of floral and spicy hops not alot of hops but some there. Taste isn't as malty as I thought. Bread/grain flavor with some slight toasted malt. Some residual sweetness hangs on the tongue. Mouthfeel was light to medium with good drinkability. I like this one as well as all the others in the mixed 12. Solid beers for a very reasonable price."
"Out of mixed six came this beer which was a honey gold color with an off-white head. Moderate retention and some broken bands of lacing. The aroma was an interesting blend of pale malt, lager malt and some hints of hops all with a slight mustiness. The flavors were at first all pale malt and rather buttery with hints of caramel sweetness but this then got grainy, bready and dry in the middle. The finish was a little off for me, the musty and bitter note, and it stuck to the tongue. Not a highlight. The body was medium but the carbonation slightly prickly at first. This mellowed out as I drank it, however. An interesting beer but not one I would seek out again."
"Drinkable beer."
"D: If I was just throwing back bottles to get drunk, then sure this is great. For the taste and overall drinkability, find yourself a better beer."
"D - Pretty damn good for a cheaper beer and pleasantly surprising after my poor experience with Dundee Pale Ale. I went through this one pretty quickly and could drink a few of these in a night. If the rest of the Craft Pack is this good, I would definitely consider buying it again and pawning off the Pale Ales on my Brothers. A very straightforward, yet good bock"
"D: Eh, this one is kind of bland. Nothing wrong with it, but also nothing to really recommend it."
"Pours a dark gold, even orangish body with a two-finger head that died really quickly. Light malt smell with airy hops. Light-bodied and watery, with minimal malts and some sour hops. Not enough hopiness to qualify as a maibock in my opinion nor do the hops come shining through. I don't really think I'll be having this again."
"Overall, not bad -- but nothing I'd seek out. A real one-trick pony, but compared to the rest of Dundee's brews, it is the champ of the mixed pack."
"D - Not horrible but could be a lot better. Better than most other Dundee I've had but still not to be sought out"
"Part of a mixed 12 pack purchased at Total Wine in Greenville, SC for $7.99. Pours a clear golden copper color with a medium head and some sticky lacing. Sweet malty aroma. The taste is of biscuity malt with some caramel malt and just a faint hint of hops. The alcohol is well hidden. A very drinkable beer at a great price. Too bad there are only two in the 12 pack."
"I was quite surprised at how much body and flavor the Dundee Pale Bock Lager has. I guess I've just run across too many regional breweries that use the term bock, and then deliver a thin ghost of the style. On the other hand, there is a bit of tradition to that... breweries would often add coloring to their regular lagers in spring and call them bocks. This, however, is nothing like that. It's got a deep amber-orange color at about 12 SRM, and a fairly long-lasting creamy cap off off-white. The nose is caramelish, grainy and bready with a thread of spicy and floral hops in the background. The mouth feel is a dextrinous medium-full, and its moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation leaves it smooth across the palate. The flavor is again, caramelish, grainy, bready, and gently toasty. A stiff bitterness runs through it, appearing at the middle, and balancing it into and through the drying finish. Herbal and spicy hops appear at the swallow, and then help to dry it in the long lingering finish. A very nice example of the helles style. Well-brewed and balanced towards drinkability. Worth trying!"
"D - Nothing too special in a lager...but I could drink this more than once"
"D - One of the better brews IMO from this brewery. Nice flavor. Slightly higher alcohol level may prevernt this from being an all-night drinker, but definitely worth having at least one."
"Overall, this should have been called ""Pale Bock Blaah", not impressed. No thanks. Boring, even for it's style. I liked the label on the bottle more than the beer itself."
"From the relatively inexpensive ($9.99) 12-pack sampler. I had tried the Honey Brown, but that's the only Dundee (or J.W. Dundees) product I knew. This one looked a lot like the Pale Ale in the glass (clear amber) with a nice head of foam that disappeared quickly but left a nice bit of lacing. Almost imperceptible malt in the nose and somewhat more in the taste. An odd bitterness (hops?) was the only other flavor. Not quite as drinkable as I had hoped. Little carbonation with a tiny bit of alcohol in the aftertaste."
"Poured a golden brown into a goblet with a nice 1.5 finger head, receded to a cap which lingered for the duration of the drink leaving scant lacing. Aroma is malt, caramel, with a bit of hops. Mouthfeel is good with a little heaviness, great carbonation which balances well. Taste is like the nose, with a bunch of malt, caramel, and a slightly bitter hop finish. Drinkability is high due to the relatively low ABV and the good balance of taste. I could see myself picking up a sixer sometime if the price is right."
"mouthfeel is light and spicy, slight bitterness, quite drinkable indeed - another nice offering from highfalls' dundee."
"This was an interesting flavor and I really enjoyed the smell. So far it is one of the better beers out of the mix pack."
"D - You could have more then one due to its light nature and low hoppiness. But it feels like a lot of other mass produced beers. One is enough for me period."
"This one was suprisingly decent. Deep gold in with a big fizzy white head. Smell some sweet grain and floral and spicy hops. Not alot of hops but some there. Taste isn't as malty as I thought. Bread/grain flavor with some slight toasted malt. Some residual sweetness hangs on the tongue. Mouthfeel was light to medium with good drinkability. I like this one as well as all the others in the mixed 12. Solid beers for a very reasonable price."
"There has to be one bad beer in a sampler pack right? I tried this 4 times and was only able to drink the entire beer once. I don't have many drain pours but this is one of them. Just way too strong of an alcohol taste and the beer is just not smooth at all. Way too many astringent tastes going on. Really, not a good beer at all."
"Pours an Orange golden, with fluffy head and lots of carbonation, giving off a light malty aroma. It has a pleasant malty taste with slight hop bitterness and hints of Lemon, a sourdough breadiness. The mouthfeel is strangely grainy, with a sting of carbonation and a little spiciness clinging to the tongue."
"The pour reveals a clear cpper wth straw highlights and a nice column of bubbles risin to the top of the brew. The hed is about one fingers width, but recedes to an island of foam. Crystal sweet white breads hit the nostrils with some faint, spicey hops to boot. lavors of mild toasted malts meld with syrupy fruit juices in this pale malt blast of a bock. Some autumn like spces also make themselves known in the palate of this beer. The palate is a bit syrupy with the concentrated malt flavors and pumkin pie spices. Just a touch too much for a regular drinking bock."
"A clean carbonation cuts the heavy malt flavor and lightens the overall body of the beer. Nice combination to make a completely enjoyable beer drinking experience. Very worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, good level of carbonation, medium body. Drinkability would be better if it wasn't so sweet."
"Drinkability: Well, it's okay, though it lacks the depth of character to continue my interest beyond the single 12 oz. bottle."
"If you were looking at the title of the beer it is definitely more 'pale' than 'bock'. But it works well together."
"The feel is thick but also smooth. A bit prickly at the swallow. Not bad at all. Overall, it's a nice, substantial but darkly drinkable brew."
"One of the better Dundee offerings. Still, nothing to write home about."
"If you were hard pressed for a bock and this was all that was available, you could do a lot worse (re: Michelob Amber Bock). But still, Dundee needs to take a good look at what it's trying to do with these scrutinized styles. I know the beer runs cheaper, but it doesn't have to be so obvious why in the taste."
"Best offering from JW Dundee's yet, although that doesn't mean it's great. Little aroma, but I was able to detect some solid maltiness. Pour is a light to medium copper color with an impressive white head and good lacing. Full mouthfeel bordering on the creamy side, nice clean finsih with an alcohol kick. Flavor is solid, has that strong malt content that a bock should clearly have, this one is more on the calmer blander side for this style but it is enjoyable. The alcohol kick is there in the taste as well which I have always liked in a brew, decent beer to knock back a couple quick ones on. Overall enjoyable but still not impressive from a mediocre brewery."
"pours a decent golden color, deffinitely something with some carmelization in the color... but the head dissapears a bit too quickly. the aroma doesn't have a lot going on but a little roasted malt's deffinitely there. much the same with the taste, it's got a nice bit of malt and not a lot else. a bit more than medium in body, but still pretty drinkable."
"D: Again, about as average as a beer can get. Wouldn't be opposed to drinking again but won't seek out. I have been pretty disappointed by the Dundee brews."
"D: Like with other Dundee beers I've had, I'm torn. A nice beer in and of itself. But not that great an example of the style."
"Pours a dull gold with a three finger tall head that disipates rapidly leaving some spotty lace as it drops.The smell is slightly sweet with a bit of a staleness on the backside.The taste are pretty average for the style,bready and lightly roasted malts upfront followed closly by some spicy/herbal flavors,nice bit of solid hops do this one a lot of good.Smoothe drinking,medium body,drying finish.Nice brew from Dundees,not somthing to pass up if offered,not one to seek out either."
"Pours a golden honey color with an average white head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The smell is doughy with a slight spiciness to it, some honey as well. The taste starts off with a honey bready malt, very slight hints on Munich malt which is followed by a metallic and stale grass hop. The feel is light with fizzy carbonation, finishes neutral between the sweet malt and bitter hop. Definitely an easy drinker. Doesn't really stand up with the other Maibocks out there but its still solid."
"D - This is a pretty good maibock. A solid offering from JW Dundee's"
"Clear golden body with soft bubbles and a white, pillowy, extra-creamy two-finger head in a pokel--uneven tracings... thin, metallic hints of malt; crisp and a bit buttery... thin going in, but a bit of an annoyance on the throat... creamy and weak-bodied... somewhat malty--more pilsner than bock?--but the taste boldens late... stronger, but still basically a light lager with some sweetness...pleasant and rather nondescript--giving this beer the benefit, it may just be a misnomer (can't imagine this holding up to an actual bock), and without expectations, it is drinkable."
"Drinkability: best of their offering. Decent beer"
"Notes: Over all I would say that it is an average beer that is easy to drink with a simple clean flavor."
"Overall it's drinkable, but nothing to write home about."
"overall, i enjoyed this brew"
":)"
"D: One of the better offerings from JW Dundee."
"Not an impressive looking beer by any stretch of the imagination--this JW Dundee craft pack offering pours a light orange/copper with little to no head, leaving a very slight lacing along the glass as you finish. The smell is thin; just basic, faint hings of malt. The taste is crisp and light, which makes this a pretty easy beer to drink and would go well with chicken/poultry."
"D: Drank like a macro, pretty boring, bland, uneventful."
"Weak head quickly turns to a thin cover. It was tan over a copperish beer. The nose has some sweet malts and not much else. Again a subtle sweetness that is light but balanced. I guess its hard to make something thats out of balance considering what they put into it. Average body. Too light considering my idea of a good bock."
"D - it's ok, but I wouldn't drink it all night."
"Pours a clear yellow orange, fast fading white head, decent lacing. Smell: very little hops, almost all malt. Taste: grassy and spicy hops, pale malts. Mouthfeel: thin bodied, a bit grainy and thin with high carbonation. This is an ok Maibock, but a bit less hops that the others I've tried."
"I thought this wasn't a bad stab at the style. Could it use some work? Sure, but there's nothing to complain about here as being bad. In fact, it leans more toward the positive than anything negative. A easy, basic drinker, but a good brew overall."
"Pours a five-finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Slight malty nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is malty, some sweetness, hops are balancing. $1.08 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Drinkability isn't strong due to the mild flavors - you don't really have a reason to finish this brew. I could knock them back but didn't enjoy it too much so I decided to pour it out and go find another beer that I'd enjoy more. Why waste your flavor buds? Drink what you like."
"An overall average beer reminding me of domestic macro brews but with a kick as are most of their beers. Poured a dark golden color with a smell that seems all to malty and a taste that agrees. Easy to drink and good value but probably wouldn't pick this bock again."
"Smooth on the pallet and smooth going down with no discernable after taste"
"D - Good drinkability. Another very good value from High Falls."
"A bit too sweet and a pretty weak body - well - it does reach medium body, but has little depth - for abv lets a bit too much of pepper come through. Overall, not bad though - just mediocre, that's all."
"Rich honey colored pour with a little bit of white head. Smell was similar to a hefeweizen actually. Taste was a bit malty, a touch tart, light and watery with an almost hef spiced aftertaste and sort of a dull, tart apple juice flavor. Maybe it was a bit past its prime as I got it in a mix pack, but it's hard to say. Either way, nothing impressive."
"Eric"
"D - Not an altogether bad beer, but I'd pass this by in a heartbeat for something a little better. This isn't very ""too style"" either. This is so sweet and thick that it's really almost a drain pour. I hate to be so critical, but I really don't like this at all."
"Pours a clear yellow orange color with a medium white head that has some lacing. Very sweet malty smell that a bock is sposed to have. The taste is of very sweet malts and some light hops, but not much. It is a very sweet beer, like a bock should be. The mouthfeel is good and it is a fairly drinkable beer."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer. I could have a couple of these."
"Pours golden with a thin white head.Decent retention,and some lacing. Aroma is malty,but weak. Body is medium,with a bit of carbonation. Taste is malty with a bit of honey. Little bit of hops in the finish. Nice but on the weak side.Worth a try for sure."
"D - Meh, leaves me underwhelmed. I'm not sure where the brewer was going with this. It's unoffensive, and I'm sure very approachable. If it was selling for less then a buck a bottle, I would by it for non-beer geek friends."
"D - This is a pretty good beer one that I could drink all night"
"Thanks Dad."
"D- I could drink these all the time. But with the higher alcohol content (which was evident), you would have to be careful"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw in color with about a half finger of white head that has decent retention. Aroma is almost non-existent. There are faint aromas of sweet crystal malts and lightly spicy hops as well as a distinctly lager yeast aroma. Taste is of some crystal malts, a touch of hop spicyness in the finish, and a lager character throughout. I noticed a surprising amount of alcohol in this brew considering its only 6.2% ABV. In the finish there is a flavor that seems to be a combination of spicy hops and has an overwhelming lager character that I find very unpleasant and the alcohol flavor doesn't help. Mouthfeel is average at best, medium-light body and moderate-low carbonation. Drinkability is fairly low. I simply didn't enjoy this at all. I would not recommend this beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear golden color with a lot of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass to a rice crispies crackling head. The smell is rather non-descript, grainy malt is really all that is going on here. The initial taste is a slight sweetness, quickly countered by a bitterness from the hops which gives a smooth, dry finish. Nothing too complex, just a decent tasting beer. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a bubbly, slightly viscous carbonation. Overall, a decently drinkable beer - nothing offensive about it, but nothing really impressive either."
"D - Well not the most drinkable maibock I've tried, still not bad and fairly fit ""to style""."
"D - Nice and drinkable, but.... I might consider it a little heavy for the style. It has just a bit too much hop flavor and not enought malt for a real Maibock."
"Last one of the Craft Pack. Poured gold into a nonic, with a half inch of creamy foam. The smell was sweet, and fruity. It was unfortunately, accompanied with some slight ester notes. The taste was pleasantly fruity and spiced, with slight earthy hop notes. Moderate carbonation danced through this thick and creamy beer. The heavy brew finished dry. This was by far, the most surprising brew in the Craft Pack. One I would definitely drink again, but not for some time."
"The problem is with the metallic taste upfront. It just hits too hard. It's an interesting take on the style but I believe I've had better versions of a helles bock/maibock. ."
"I was surprised by this one, and I didn't think it was too bad. I would definately have another. It isn't entirely true to form, but it is still a good beer. Definately worth a try."
"Drinkability - way to go, High Falls. I'm a fan of this one as I find myself drawn more to the bock categories of late. Well done."
"Golden colored beer with a almost macro-lager like aroma.Taste is dominated by sweet malt.This is the sixth and final beer in the JW Dundee craft case and I scored each one as a thumbs up.Good job by High Falls Brewery!! As for this one specifically it is something I would buy again but would not go out of my way to get it!!"
"the next was the pale bock ; pours a deep, clear, golden color w/ a white head which dissapates quickly, some lacing ; not much for aroma, a kinda ""ricey"" nose to it, some caramely malt undertones present ; the flavor is actually reminicent of the US "" 40 "" malt liqours, but sweeter & more hops ; a little to thin here, too, much too light for the style, too much carbonation as well ; not a bad beer , but nothing spectacular either...."
"The taste has caramel malt, some roasted malt flavour, some fruitiness(cherry, citrus) and a slight alcohol flavour. Hmm..there's not much harmony going on with the flavours here and I'm finding it kind of difficult to take more sips. Nope. This one is not for me."
"Pours out a nice marmalade with a fluffy little head and some spotty lacing. A handful of streams of bubbles lazily make their way to the head. Smell is pretty lackluster, with an overall vague sweetness taking over. Malt is pushed to the back along with a note of alcohol. Little bit of vegetable smell as well as an odd hint of stinkbug. Flavor isn't as sweet as the nose would suggest and the malt comes a few steps closer to the fore (but accompanied by some graininess). Alcohol is well hidden and there's a suggestion of leafy hop in the finish along with a nice balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel isn't too syrupy (which can be the case with some maibocks) and the carbonation is a *good* lively. Overall, this is a solid beer. Can't complain of it being full of defects or anything, just this isn't the most impressive helles bock around."
"drinkability is ok. i'd rather sit and smell it though."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-once brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tapglass."
"D: Very easy to drink and sessionable. For $8/12pack, this is without a doubt worth a shot. Especially if your thirsty."
"Poured a dark golden color w/ 2 finger head. Smell was slight floral with a sweet fruity presence. Taste was surprisingly good! I've had many of J.W's brews before, but this was really descent. Fruity flavor, maybe a plum or raison, with a sugar cookie taste that lingers, not much in the hop department, but caramel malt was nice. Mouthfeel was malty and pleasant, but carbonation was a bit too much for a great balance. Drinkability was nice, but not the greatest. Overall, an above par brew."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the sample"
"D - Overall, better than expected but I wouldn't want too many of these in a row. Substantial."
"Final Thought: This is like a jacked up PBR that tastes better and hits you harder... I wish I would have bought a case worth at $12!"
"WHAT A SURPRISE!!! Just bought a Brewmaster's Sampler, and never even heard of this one. Pours a beautiful Amber/brown color....the head is perfect, and stayed the whole time! Lacing was impressive too. And the flavor. Oh yes, the flavor! Isn't that why we drink the stuff?!?! It was SOOO smooth and very malty. A tiny hop bite, but oh, so tiny. Just a perfect balance of hop and malt...but more malt than hop, which I personally like. Nice beer for the autumn, I think. Really liked this, and I still can't believe that it was only $19.99 for a case of this stuff!!! Hell, a few isles away there were beers going for $200 a CASE!!! This is a quality beer, in my opinion, but try for yourself. If you're a ""beer geek"" what the hell is $20 to you?!?! AND, in the Brewmaster's case, you get SIX DIFFERENT BEERS from J.W. Dundee's!!! SIX BEERS!!! I think that's great. Props to you, my friends at High Falls. Keep them prices low and that flavor/quality high!!! Very comparible with the expensive micros, I think. A secret ""gem"" in the beer world! SAAALUTE my BA FRIENDS!!!"
"Overall-Another veritble bargain from High Falls. There beers can be hit or miss, but when you find the hit (like this one) the price to flavor ratio just can't be beat."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was lager colored with a tam creamy head that lasted a little while. The taste was slighly sweet with a touch of hoppiness that was just right for me. Not to hoppy. I liked the beer and will buy again."
"High Falls has scored a very good beer again. Their ""specialty"" brews have been quite solid lately (e.g. Porter) and have turned me on to these guys, especially given the price point. They and Saranac are my 2 fave high value Northeastern brewers."
"12oz bottle from a multi-pack. Amber body with a thin off-white head. Smell is feint, but hints at malty sweetness. Tastes malty sweet with hints of grain bitterness toward the finish. Lighter-bodied making this a pretty drinkable beer. Not overly complex or wow-ing, but a solid drinkable beer, and one of their better offerings IMO."
"Overall a pretty good bock. Good effort from Dundee's."
"Update on 8/5/2008: Much better than previously. It has very good head retention, a more malty aroma, and a tasty malt character with munich you can taste now. Not fabulous, but a solid beer."
"A pretty decent session beer, and one of the better from JW Dundee, though that doesnt take much."
"DA: This one is going down pretty easy on this 95 degree day (6/27/07) but the sickly-sweet malt proves to be too big for another."
"I really like this beer. I actually think it is better than some of the German examples -- especially when I figure in the price different (small though it may be)."
"Drinkability - The beer is just too bitter and malty for my liking, so I would not buy this again. Had trouble finishing the four bottles that came with the variety 12-pack."
"I was not a fan of this brew, tasted more like a decent macro lager than a German inspired Maibock. A DMS smell overtook the nose. It also contributed to the taste, along with some smokiness and sweet breadiness. Went down easy and clung to the mouth well with a slight alcohol warmth. But not something I would enjoy very often."
"Pours an extra pale gold hue with brilliant clariy. Soapy three finger head shows good retention and spotty lacing. Clean nose, some meek toasted pale notes and whiff of ester but not much aroma. The first sip is a mellow blend of biscuity pale malt, some toasty dextrin, and a pinch of sharp pilsener malts. The accompaning cider taste is non-offensive and feels appropriate; as does the mild but balanced bitterness and clean german hop flavor. Semi-dry aftertaste, with some degree of residual sweetness, but an ample carbonation keeps the medium bodied beer crisp and lively. Finishes toasty and rich with malt flavor and a light apple ester in the background. J.W. Dundee's does not seem the type that pushes the boundaries, rather they profess at making solid beers of medium strength with respectable flavor and complexity that have terrific drinkability and represent the given style accurately; and this one is no different."
"An overall average beer reminding me of domestic macro brews but with a kick. The apperance is a dark golden color with a smell that seems all to malty and a taste that agrees. Easy to drink and good value but probably wouldn't pick this bock again."
"Yellow color, and fizzy, but a good golden tint to it, and the head is decent enough. Sweet malted grain in the nose, quite weak. The flavor is a little thin, kind of takes the complexity away from the bock style. Some hop bitterness makes the whole thing reasonably tasty. I favor ales normally and this helles bock is a little light for my pleasure. Great price, very chiefable. Finish is somewhat dry."
"Not my favorite but I would recommend this for people who like a malty alcohol tasting beer. This bock has a nice depth of taste with a strong alcohol taste so you know your drinking a beer!"
"Not really the best example of a bock, frankly, and certainly not the most fantastic beer I've tried: the alcohol is a little on the rough side, its kind of watery for a bock, and its just sort of unremarkable. But, it does have some bright points: it pours a beautiful golden amber, theres a fairly tasty grainy maltiness, it features a nice fruity sweetness and its pretty drinkable. All in all, I would say it was worth it, JWDs brews are irresistibly priced and you probably wont mind finishing off three bottles of this beer if you got them in one of their nifty variety twelve-packs like I did. Recommended."
"I've never had a 'Pale Bock' before, but this Maibock is probably brewed to appeal to a broad audience. It's a very drinkable beer, and at 7.5% you get a lot of bang for your buck (I paid $5.49 for a six-pack.)"
"Taste is rich, bright, pale malt. Sweetish and lightly fruity. Hints of green apple. Some muted hops in the finish. Strangely, a bit dry up front, with a sweetish but clean finish. Really tasty. This stuff is money. And it's a great beer for the money. Check out a six-pack (it may take a full six-pack to get this beer), hell, it's cheap!"
"D - highly drinkable, as with all other JW Dundee's, a quality beer with a party type feel, great at a party to satisfy the macro drinkers and not offend your palate"
"Given that I like this style and this is the highest rated beer from High Falls, I had high hopes for this beer. Im thinking my expectations may have been over-inflated. While I can honestly say that this is the best beer that Ive had from this company, its nowhere near the quality of other beers that Ive had from this style."
"Really enjoyable, and considering I hate J.W. Dundee's Honey Brown, I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this was. As others have noted, $4.99 a six-pack for something this good is a nice supermarket find. Will be certainly enjoying the other five."
"Poured clear medium golden with a nice forming one finger white head but it seemed to leave as quick as it came leaving no lace behind,aromas are buttery and somewhat toasted with lighter cooked veggie elemant as well.Quite buttery tasting up front with some caramel intertwined in there I noticed a mineral-like quality more as it warmed a little hops come thru late in herbal.spiciness.Hey $4.99 a sixer and pretty quaffable if a little lighter in flavor and body, I am gonna offer to my German father in law and see what he thinks."
"JW Dundee's Pale Bock pours a clear golden color with a medium white head. Aroma is bready and malty with a hint of floral hops. Taste is malty and very smooth, with a medium body and a slightly off-dry finish. An very drinkable bock, and at $4.50/six pack it is very easy on the wallet as well."
"Poured a deep golden color with massive white puffy head. Nice lacing as the head slowly fell to a thin coating. Smell is fruity, malty, and sweet. Taste greatly differs from the dmell with a strong hop bitterness dominating over the malt. Finished more dry than sweet with a nice creamt mouthfeel. A nice beer with good drinkability."
"Drinkability  This went down well and was appreciated by some of the non-beer drinkers attending skyhands Broken Fridge party."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable and well made - quite impressive especially considering the low price."
"Maybe not a beer that will wow the geeks, but at around $ 4.50 a sixer a solid economical choice, and a tasty alternative to a BMCer looking to branch out a little. Not a bad little big beer."
"Drinkability is this beers strength, don't really consider a bock taste-wise. The ABV helps to mask some astrigency & sweetness I found annoying in their honey brown., worth a try, just please don't tell me this your favorite bock!?!!!???!"
"The mouth is a trifle thin but is still manages to be a bit creamy. Easy enough drinker, would be easy to session. Another nice, inexpensive offering from High Falls!"
"Well, to start with, this ones an attractive beer. Its an extremely clear golden beer with a slight copper accent. Nice head: puffy and white, lasting, and lace-producing. The aroma is a little underwhelming: very faint, lightly toasted malt, and thats about it. Theres none of the multi-dimensional caramel flavors or Munich-malt temptations. Appropriately, theres almost no hop presence. Its got a faint bready sweetness, and a firm, medium-body mouthfeel. It holds together pretty well, but it seems a little dumbed-down in the flavor department. It seemed ordinary and un-interesting."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pale malt scent that is a bit musty. There appears to be some malt sweetness, but it's very little. The taste is good. It has a grainy pale and carapils malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual sweetness. It also has a musty lager yeast aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. This isn't my favorite style, but this is a good drinker despite it."
"First experience with this brew and was expecting pretty good results based on past experiences with High Falls. Always nothing extraordinary, a fair to good brew at a great price. This brew was not what I expected; I felt it was a excellent brew and a great price. Brew pours to a clear golden color that has amber highlights in it. Nice sized off-white head that breaks down somewhat slowly leaving a nice sheen of lace along the sides of the glass. The aromas are actually quite complex, rye bread like smell along with slight fruit like esters and a spicy hop scent. The taste is very nice, very similar qualities as expressed in the aromas of the brew. Very rich malt like flavor dominates but then the spiciness cuts through, finishing nicely. A very smooth brew, with the ABV at 6.2 I would imagine that this one could sneak up on you because it is very easy drinking, exceptional offering!"
"I'm not a big fan of the style so truth be known I am biased to some extent! Drinkabilty for a 6+% abv is very good. A sixer may kill joe six pack if he isn't paying attention. Not something I would revisit on purpose but I wouldn't say no to it on tap locally or at a friend's house out of the fridge."
"Tasting it, I find good bit of maltiness. It's sweet, and has a crisp finish. There's a good amount of carbonation that is refreshing as well. A bit sticky in the moutfeel. Perhaps the taste of prunes? Breadiness too. A lot more complicated than I thought was possible in a beer made by the brewers of ""Golden Anniversary"" and ""Genny Cream Ale."" A good surprise, not mind blowing, and as far as maibocks go, I prefer Dead Guy, but this is still satisfying."
"Needless to say, I'm sorry I didn't buy a few sixers. It makes me re-think JWD's Pale. THIS is the beer I'll buy while it's available. If this was $6 it would still be a great buy. On the package, they mention a Hefe, IPA , and Scotch Porter are thier seasonals....bring em!"
"This offering from High Falls is very good. I got it in a sampler with the Amber, Pale Ale and Honey Brown. Beautiful color, a dark gold, with creamy but not excessive off white head. Some lacing. Very smooth and drinkable. The Saaz hops were noticable and to my taste might be a little weak. I really like the Saaz. Anyway, the Hops are there, but this is a malty beer, as it should be, and the balance is probably true to style. This is absolute proof that High Falls knows good beer. Truly enjoyable."
"Review from notes: Sampled with the brewer and a bunch of BA's in Rochester, NY. This new brew from high falls is really something to appluad, a nic pale heller bock brewed for the masses as a high falls seasonal. I hear an ipa may follow, and than after that who knows!? Big kudos to Dave S for sharing and for brewing up some quality ""micros"" in the ""macro"" world! This one is very plae golden with an eggshell white head of frippy frothy foam that lasts and leaves some nice lacing as well. Aromas are freshly baked bread, bavarian pretzels, and more malt accented flavors as well as a bit of spicy floral German and US hops? Taste is sweet and bready but the sweetness is not overdone and the spicy hops do come in and balance everything nicely. This coupled with the simple medium bodied mouthfeel of this brew make it's drinkability good as well. So solid, it is like a rock, this isn't even my favorite style, but it is nailed here, and quite tasty. Drink up!"
"Suprisingly saw this on tap at Donnely's Public house in fairport(get it while you can). The bartender didn't really know what it was but i guess it is a test or something. Anyways i loved it. It is certainly pale as it pours a really light gold. The taste is sorta sweet but I think the hops are more dominant. Perfect amount of alcohol. Interesting brew, hopefully we will see it in the stores soon."
" As High Falls carries on through tests of this brew, I say ""Yes"" to this possible seasonal, and with any more luck, there's always the chance we'll see it next year!!"
"All in all it's a satisfying brew."
"Cheers to Dave at HF for taking on this underrated and underappreciated style and nailing it."
