It pours brilliant pale gold with a very light copper tint under a thin white head that quickly dissipates to nothing. A palate of light grains lightly seasoned with caramel and a hint of hops could benefit from a soft creamy carbonation. Medium bodied but nearly flat and the absence of a creamy head is disappointing. This beer could use more cowbell.","pat61","Nov 21, 2014"

Not impressed but not sent screaming from the glass either---smooth drinker for being slightly over 6% abv. Needs either a different hop variety or more of same. Perhaps a second malt of rye would also help relieve the "blandness". Just slightly better than OK. A Disappointment from Boulevard, who brew the outstanding "Smokestack" series.","Murphious","Beers"

I would like to see some more hops in this, even for a bock, its out of balance. it also doesn't have the grain depth and complexity of the better bocks around. this is clearly a mass appeal dumbing down of the style. not particularly interesting, but its very easy drinking. super clean feel, despite the sugar, and good enough carbonation. this might be my least favorite beer from these guys, who usually go above and beyond, this one underwhelms.","StonedTrippin","Jun 12, 2013"

Light bock aroma, sweet malts and light hops, pleasant, but low key. Mild sweet and caramel malt, light hops. maibock flavors to style, but too understated. An satisfactory dinner beer, but too mild to be interesting. The caramel malt aftertaste grew on me as I drank this bock.","LiquidAmber","Mar 02, 2012"

Earthy, husky smell is very appetizing. Nice full body balanced by the carbonation. Finish is slick and abrupt. It's very easy to drink, even at 6.1%.","mikeborglum","Mar 23, 2010"
3.98,13.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I like it. First time I found it on the shelves here in Iowa. Since it's 6.10% I'm wondering if this is a brand new beer or one they just never sent before. Will definitely drink it again.","beragg","Mar 23, 2010"
3.93,11.6,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"D - Easy drinking. Not filling, despite its carbonation. Flavors are smooth and well managed. ABV is up there, but not outrageous.","katan","Mar 20, 2010"
3.87,9.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"This is a darn solid maibock and a great session candidate. The name is the best name in beer this year. This is a fitting tribute to a significant figure in Kansas City history.","Reaper16","Mar 20, 2010"
3.72,5.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Drink: This beer tastes pretty good, and with the low abv would make for a really easy session beer.","turamarth","Mar 20, 2010"
4.13,17.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is nicely done. As with many clean lagers, the "eleventy jillion percent, infinity IBU or it sucks" crowd will pooh-pooh it, but it is a well made maibock. Worthy addition to the seasonal lineup, and worth seeking out.","jokelahoma","Mar 20, 2010"
3.51,-0.3,2.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"M&D-medium body and a little over carbonated. Easy to drink and I could see using this as a very easy path into craft beer from macros I'll use it next time I'm easing someone in","SpecialK088","Beers"
4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"D - This is a really good Maibock. I'm glad Boulevard made a style that is relatively rare and they've done a great job with it.","zeff80","0"

3.73,6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel has a light/medium body. A little heavier than the Pilsener, but still crisp. Very smooth and refreshing, this would be great with a heavy meal.","bort11","0"
