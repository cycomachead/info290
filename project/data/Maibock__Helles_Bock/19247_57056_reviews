"Wow! Very nice and clean. Pleasantly surprised. Drinks like a more complex pilsner."

"O: Very enjoyable and very nice example of the style by an American brewery (I have been fortunate to live in states with breweries that do great example of the classic German styles twice now). Easy to drink and definitely one to grab again."
"On tap at the brewery on its 2015 release day.  Very bright looking with just a finger width of head.  Smells bready sweet.  Tastes great.  Sweet and slightly grassy.  Nice biscuity flavor.  Faint hops but just enough.  Slightly dry finish.  Very clean.  Well done and on point for the style."

"O - This beer would be fantastic on a hot summer day! It reminds me of a pilsner, but with more complexity. I'm glad I had the chance to try this. Per the BA's request, I was to drink it with spicy food, but I was curious and it was almost time to hit the bed. Solid offering!"

"On tap at Carolina Beer Company in the Charlotte airport. Pours clear gold with a white head that disappears quickly, leaving a bit of lacing. Malty, bready with some grass. That carries over into the taste, but there's some really nice fruit and sweetness that comes through. Medium mouth. First of this style for me, so maybe I'm over-estimating this one, but it's really nice."
"Gold color with a slight head. Very little lacing on the glass. Toasted malt aroma with a pilsner quality to it. Light peppery hop aroma. Some spiciness in the flavor. Dry mouthful but extremely drinkable. Overall, a good block that is on point for the style. Nice to see more American breweries attempting this style."

"Exactly one month old today,bottled on 4/17/13.Poured into a half liter stein a clear light to medium golden with a great looking blooming white crown,almost specially made for the glassware used.The aromas are a little different than what Iam used to when it comes to a maibock,no big sweet doughy notes but a crispness with mild caramel notes underneath,it's malty but not alcoholic.Flavors of wet grain and some caramel sweetness,again the crispness is what stands out most to me.Not what Iam used to in a maibock...but it's well made and the crispness is a nice change of pace.A lighter maibock but it goes down easy."

"O: True to style if a shade light on the hops; well-crafted, clean and refreshing."
""
"A very good lighter lager with great flavor, would definitely have this again."
"O: A solid beer overall. Nice, clean flavors and aromas with a light hoppiness."

"Served from tap into a Sierra Nevada shaker. Poured a golden pale yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, subtle banana, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, wheat, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty average brew. This one was quite refreshing and easy to drink but as far as the style goes it was in the middle of the road in my opinion. It did have a lot of nice things going for it, but it was close to all of the brews in this style and didn’t stand out at all unfortunately. I would suggest this one to non-craft drinkers or fans of the style without a doubt, but I would hesitate to recommend it to a hardcore enthusiast."

"Had on tap at Mac's Speedshop. Pours a really nice golden color with a solid two fingers worth of head. The nose is clean and lightly floral with hints of apricot. Mouthfeel is light with a nice effervescent carbonation. Taste is bright and clean and finishes slightly sweet. Overall a really refreshing spring seasonal from a great local brewery."

"O - Awesome across the board, Früh Bock is perfect for spring and summer and would easily convert BMC drinkers to craft. A delicious gateway beer if I may..."

"O: A very nice flavorful maibock."
"Overall a refreshing, clean, easy-drinking spring bock from OMB -- well done!"
"Fruehbock pours golden clear and has nice foamy head. There is a very heavy malt flavor. I taste a little more sweetness than I prefer, but there is a nice bitter bite...maybe some herbal and dirty aspects. I taste a little more booze than in other OMB offerings. This is a solid spring seasonal."
"Lovin this beer a lot, a well rounded helles bock ... more proof that OMB is one of the best breweries in the USA IMO."
"Pours a very clear golden color with a big thick yellowish white head with a ton of lacing. Smells of sweet malts, yeast bread, a little hops. Tastes very sweet and grainy almost fruity. Mouthfeel is great, Olde Meck are the masters of this, and drinkability is pretty good. Good for a style I do not often care for."
"I don't know what was going on with that butterscotch effect in the nose (maybe something with the diacetyl developed from being stored in the growler) but for the most part this was a tasty, crisp, and easy drinking take on the Maibock. Another good effort here from the OMB."
"This is just good beer. Not as refined and delicious as the Copper, maybe, but better than the Dunkel and a good example of an under-brewed style. Highly recommended; most non-craft brewers seem to dig this just fine."
"Yet another outstanding beer by Olde Meck.... This one is just so drinkable. Big frothy head, lots of lace left on the glass. Very well balanced, sweet, but with the noble hop bitter undertone of this style. A lovely bread aftertaste--like most all good German beers. These guys are 1st Class all the way..."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I am finding that nearly anything that I try when I am at Olde Meck, I will not be disappointed."
