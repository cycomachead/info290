This was very interesting and I enjoyed it quite a bit – my expectations were low for a bock/maibock collaboration from a can but this shocked me with really good flavor and pretty peculiar qualities that made for a tasty beer experience.

4.26,13.3,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Had this beer on tap yesterday (12/24/14) at the Green Onion Pub in Utica, NY.  I wanted to review it because a previous rating narrative described Yonder Bock as cloyingly sweet.  I find that description peculiar in that I found the taste to be exceptionally dry, showing that it was effectively fermented.  Maybe I got an old batch, perhaps it was a mistake batch, or maybe my sense of taste is beginning to wane.  The fact is, this beer was dry, almost as if it had a touch of brett in the ferment, though it didn't.  Anyway, easy drinking at 7.7, great hop content for a lager, that kind of took it out of the Maibock range, but who cares, adhering to beer style "rules" is a thing of the past.  US brewers are making the best beer in the world right now by breaking the "rules", and have been for years.   We just want great beer, and man it is out there like crazy.  Nice job Sierra-Cigar City.","mirp1","Dec 19, 2014"

Tons of lace is left behind as it fades.  Nose is both spicy and musky fragrant.  Which is not what I expected from this version of the style.  Flavor is spearheaded by a balance of tropical hops and sweet malts.  There is just enough spice to this brew that balance things out and really makes this brew interesting.  Overall I was expecting a brew a bit sweeter but I was pleasantly surprised.","SPLITGRIN","Sep 14, 2014"

Once settled there is a full even lacing and slight collar...  The color is a pale warm inviting caramel color...  A light to moderate bit of slow to moderate paced carbonation rises throughout...  Overall a pretty nice looking brew...  A very nice nose...  The malty goodness is at the forefront in terms of gooey caramel and toffee...  Next rises a warm sweet fruity component that was lingering a bit beneath the surface...  Lots of warm doughy bread notes...  The flavor profile is dialed up in intensity from the aroma, but all of the expected players are present...  Lots of caramel, toasted malts and warm bread notes...  Overly ripened fruit with a slight hint of citrusy hops...  Simple, straight-forward and quite effective...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Viscous, chewy and perhaps even a bit sludgy...  Limited carbonation...  Coats the mouth fully...  After starting a bit lush, the finish has a touch of dryness and is somewhat chalky...

The smell is slightly fruity but also piney and floral. Mouthfeel is very nice with some bitterness. Taste is not what i expected at all the fruit flavor is very subtle, I've had west coast and DIPA that possessed greater fruit flavor on the first taste. The mango and passionfruit come through ever so slightly while the star of the show would be the malt bill that is equal parts smooth and intricate, while also possessing some bread characteristics. The beer finishes very clean. Really nice brew.","jkeefe1800","Aug 13, 2014"

Flavor is moderately malty sweet with a mild fruit tone that definitely leans towards tropical (mission accomplished on that aspect).

3.92,4.3,4,3.75,4,3.75,4," This is very tasty and tangy with tropical flavor like fruit salad with mixed taste of light toasted grain and gentle woody hops in the background with slight caramel flavor mid palate. The taste has a gentle astringency level with some fruity tangy character coming through with mild yeast adding to the complexity and grainy malt carrying a supplimentary flavor into the semi-dry finish with a little alcohol noticeable in the taste. I really liked this bock..it is a good lager with fruity hop accent complimenting the base yet a bit sweet which is the only thing holding this back -hoppy and bock can be good.","Slatetank","0"

Feel is again a bit thin with regards to what the color/flavor/style might suggest. Overall an easy drinking brew, rather hoppy and dry for the style and with a body that doesn't quite define itself in a traditional sense. ABV is hinted at but never obvious nonetheless. A nice take on the style and reminds me of Weihenstephaner's Festbier in a sense. Atypical yet perhaps more to my liking as for lack of buttery sweetness.","HalfFull","Aug 03, 2014"

Interesting aroma of melon and berry tropical fruit, apricot light bready malt, a bit spicy, light grassy hops; really unique. Flavor is mixed mildly carmal and biscuit malt, sweet tropical fruit leaning towards pineapple, grassy hops. Finishes with a quite pleasant tropical fruit / grassy hop taste that lingered with floral fruit flavors for a while. Light to medium bodied. This ain't your granpappy's maibock. However the basic maibock profile is there, but nicely spiced and modified by the unusual fruit flavors. I was slightly disappointed in the initial flavor after the very interesting aroma, but this really grew on me as I drank it. Interesting and flavorul. The tropical flavors mesh nicely with the maibock base. Now 6/12 on the pack and still really enjoying it.","LiquidAmber","Aug 01, 2014"

Again, I'm not getting big hop flavor or aroma in this as I would have expected from the description. Solid maibock, though. Mouthfeel is moderate to full, with a bit of slickness. Carbonation is tame. This is a pretty good maibock, but I was expecting more hop flavor and aroma and those tropical fruits I was promised.

Well I guess the tropics do likely have apples and such, tropical apples! Crisp, clean taste, just what I would expect from a Maibock. Reminiscent of Hofbrau Maiock, which is a compliment. Really smooth, full mouthfeel. I've been a sour trip for my go to summer beers, but I could see this guy creeping in.

Maibock is one of those German styles we just don't see visited enough here in America with the IPA, stouts, sours, and all things barrel aged craze. But what a nice little beer that SN and CCB have crafted here. It's got very nice balance between hearty and dry (the pale malt and hops are showcased nicely) and the tropical hops and fruit that CCB used really adds some great balance. Very interesting, very classic, and very enjoyable. Who says old styles can't be fun? Great job SN and CCB! Best yet out of the pack.","siege06nd","Jul 29, 2014"

Very spicy and and rich malt, but lively from pineapple (S=4) Good rich malts clash with prickly pineapple, bitter pine, grapefruit. It's sweetness takes after banana phenols. Cinnamon, cloves, and hay round out the palate. F off with the what you think a maibock should taste like; it was delicious and phenomenally flavorful for a lager (T=4.5).

They ended up with a smooth, full-ish amber beer with some bock characteristics (smooth body, mellow but kinda-sorta full malt presence, not too estery but not neutral) and some AIPA characteristics (tropical hop flavor). In any event, it’s quite good. And, bonus points for that head. Purists might get all in a tizzy, but this is a very enjoyable beer.","fmccormi","Jul 27, 2014"

The beer itself is a clear light brown color with very dark orange notes to the point where it looks pretty brown. The smell is a combination of caramel sweetness with bready yeast smell. The smell also has some very light hop notes and tiny bit of alcohol but not much to make a difference. The beer taste is similar to the smell. The taste has the same sweetness and bread taste to it but the hops are much stronger and more tropical fruit. Although, at times, the tropical can be a little too sweet. However, the combination of the notes is fairly unique. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky at the end, but is overall smooth and medium bodied with biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty good collaboration, but it did not do much for me. However, I do recommend getting it.","HattedClassic","Jul 27, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings down on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, mango, guava, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, tropical/floral hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, guava, mango, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast eathiness. Fair amount of earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, guava, mango, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, tropical/floral hops, yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/hop balance with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy maibock style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, tropical hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV.

Maybe it's the association between the two brewers, but this tastes like a cross between Sierra Nevada Torpedo and Cigar City Jai Alai to me, which are two, at times, overly malty IPAs in my opinion. I like this, but if I had to change anything, I would like to see this brewed with paler malts and slightly less final alcohol by volume (and by taste).","JednoPivoProsim","Jul 25, 2014"

Flavor is sweet with a touch of roast and a slight bitter finish.  Dark fruit is evident.  If collaborations count, this is my second cigar city beer. Very tasty.","crankdatank","Jul 24, 2014"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but I am not getting any distinct tropical fruit aromas or flavors from this one.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 23, 2014"

Despite the talk about exotic hops on the label, I don't really get any but the faintest of hop aromas of of this. The nose offers a little caramel malt, but it's pretty faint. The flavor is better, at least: bitterness comes through clearly and cuts some of the sweetness of the malt, which is a little caramel, a little bready. I'm not getting a lot of hop flavor out of this either. It tastes like a generic bock you'd get at a generic brewpub. It's not bad per se, but not an interesting one.","allengarvin","Jul 22, 2014"

Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like toffee, caramel, honey, and some tropical fruit. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some dark fruit (cherries, raisins), bready malt, apples and nuttiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. I liked this, it's an interesting take on a Maibock.","bluejacket74","Jul 20, 2014"

A very nice looking beer. Scents of tropical fruit, including notes of passion fruit, mango, pineapple and hints of guava, hints of lightly toasted malt and caramel with a faint presence of alcohol in the background. A very nice aroma profile, strong in tropical fruit aromas as advertised but with a traditional maibock character present in the background. Very appealing. Flavor begins malty sweet, with bready malt flavors mingling with slight hints of toasted malt, notes of tropical fruit and a slight bit of alcohol and a medium-low bitterness level with slight floral hop flavors. This moves into a middle that rich in bready malt sweetness, with notes of mango and noticeable alcohol presence. Finish is medium-dry with flavors of bready and especially toasted malt balanced by earthy and floral hop flavors and alcohol. Aftertaste is toasted malt and a slight bitterness. A fairly good flavor profile, not as tropical as the aroma but certainly present with a nice balance of sweet malt and earth, floral hops. Quite nice and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and semi-drying with low carbonation. This makes it quite easy to drink. Overall this is a pretty good twist o. The maibock style. The aroma is uniquely tropical with a more traditional maibock flavor that still contains a tropical presence and a mouthfeel that is quite pleasant. A pretty nice offering and worth trying.","Auraan","Jul 17, 2014"

4.32,14.9,4.25,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Golden amber with a sticky, craggy foam cap that hangs around. Big chunks of lace. Smells of caramel and mango with a hint of grapefruit. Taste is creamy right off the bat. Lightly mango and citrus pith, there is caramel and biscuit cracker crust. It seems mildly bitter and just a bit sweet at the same time. Very interesting. Great balance. Medium body and as I mentioned a creamy mouthfeel. Excellent brew with a nice complexity of flavor but maintaining that maibock quaffability.","JackieTH","Jul 15, 2014"
