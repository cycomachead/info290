3.77,-1,,,,,,"Fairly hazy, peachy copper with a foamy cream head. Aroma is herbal and sweet, with caramel malt dominating, and a surprisingly strong whiskey and vanilla character. Flavor is also sweet and malty, with said whiskey and vanilla adding complexity, and a lightly bitter, oaky, toasted finish. There's a bit of a tangy character that's slightly offputting. Not sure if it's barrel-derived, but that wouldn't surprise me. Still retains a bit of alcohol warmth.","barczar","Aug 11, 2014"

Color is a clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is the best part here and is malt, whiskey, hop and aromatic. Flavor doesn't have mujch of the whiskey, but lots of malt and some hop comes through. It's also fairly dry with carbonic tang balanced nicely with the bitter and the slight sweet to take the edge off. Body is also excellent and is soft, but not overly and great carbonation.

It does somewhat detract from the hop profile, however, and in my opinion the brew becomes a little to overpowering in the whiskey area as it sits on the tongue and melds into the aftertaste. I also wanted for a stronger sugar base, feeling that the malty notes could have been stronger to better combat the whiskey flavors and give the beer more punch. Still, this is a good bottle, and worth trying.","jondeelee","Mar 18, 2012"

That said, now you mix this with some bold barrel flavors that don't really seem intended to be there, so the whole thing falls apart. If barrel aged beers are your thing, which I really enjoy them myself, this may be a good one to try so that you can get another review.

4.77,25.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Bought a bottle of this at Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a tulip, it poured golden-orange, with a high degree of carbonation, two fingers of off-white head, and great retention and lacing. The nose revealed citrus, honey, caramel, oak, cherry, and vanilla. The taste was a beautiful blend of the aforementioned flavors at first, then dissolving to a more pronounced malty cherry-vanilla flavor on the finish, with only a slight hint of the alcohol content. Dry warmth afterwards, which further reinforced the mental association with whiskey. With the great head retention, it felt creamy smooth, as less carbonation was evident in the feel than in the appearance. Medium thickness. Awesome sessioning beer, with the standout feature being the balance. I respectfully disagree with some of the earlier reviews that claim that the taste doesn't live up to the nose, or that whiskey dominates; I truly believe that this beer has an excellently blended flavor profile resulting from the barrel aging. If I may make the analogy, it tasted like a Nugget Nectar, which further morphed into cherry vanilla goodness...if that makes any sense to you. Oh, and by the way, in my humble opinion, of the three John John Ales that Rogue has released (and I have tried), I find this offering to be by far their most complex...and best.","donniecuffs","Dec 16, 2010"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Was quite pleasantly surprised to find this on a recent excursion to Lawrence. Pours a rather vibrant ruby red to rust ornage with a high level of carbonation and a large billowing head that's a full inch high. The nose is very fruity and floral; though there is some woody notes likely due to the barrel aging. The hops accentuate the floral notes, this beer makes my mouth water. Light mouthfeel from such a complex beer, I was expecting it to be somewhat syrupy but it's not nearly that heavy. Kind of disappointing, actually. The first thing you notice about the beer is the finish. Up front it has all the qualities of a nice pale ale. There's some fruity hop things going on giving way to malt sweetness. But the finish to this beer is almost mind blowing. There's this terrific flowered wood finish that reminds me of a creek in spring, or something similar. I don't really care for the minor alcohol notes, most likely from the aging process, but that's to be expected given this style of beer. As the beer opens up it gives you a lot more from the flavor profile. The hops are floral. I get lavendar, marigold, maybe even lillies. Quite lovely. These accent the sweet caramel malt, finally leading into that wonderful finish. It's a very circular flavor, if that makes sense. There's not a lot of breadiness or biscuit qualities to this beer, it's very light on the palate and quite delacte. This wasn't what I was expecting from this beer at all, but it's enjoyable and delicious, a perfect compliment to the end of another day in a neverending hot summer.","eclaycamp","Aug 14, 2010"

4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D - Interesting, the barrel aged character is much more prevalent in the flavor than it is in the aroma, though there is a definite uptick in complexity of the aroma, compared to regular Dead Guy, that would have to be due to the time spent in the barrel. The woody character in the flavor seems a little thin to me as compared to what I am used to from most barrel aged beers. This may be because the average barrel aged beer consists of a stronger base beer, or it may be due to the characteristics of the barrel. Either way, while this is an interesting experiment, it comes off a little flat and seems to need something more to make it really pop. In the end I don't know what to think about this one. On one hand it is lacking and weak, with flavors that need more force to back them up, but it is something more interesting and flavorful than the base beer, so I can't quite say that it was a waste of a barrel. I don't regret the opportunity to try this, but next time they might be better off using double dead guy when they have the itch to put something in a barrel.","nickfl","Jun 05, 2010"

Again, notes of vanilla flavor that seem separate from other flavors. There are also some woody flavors that do better job blending with the original beer. All the different things going on leaves the buds guess each time, but not confusing them. Definitely could use a little more focus, or could it? Huge points for making a barrel aged beer out of something so 'non-imperial' as Dead Guy. Definitely something on the original end of the spectrum. Somehow the beer makes sense.

Appears a pale copper hue with a bright off white beige head, forms thick lacing scattered on the sides of my laced ridden imperial nonic pint glass. Aroma hits with the smoked vanilla and bourbon barrel aging going on that's what comes through in the beer not the underlying dead guy ale. It opens up the nares and eyes with alcohol vapors, what a beer indeed. More malt ridden alcohol, vanilla, bourbon aged light bodied presence with a hars oak after taste is left on the palate making this one nearly impossible to finish with a smile on your face. I'm one of the biggest fans of Rogue beer but keep your whiskey seperate from your bread winning Dead Guy, these two creations have no place joining as one. It's hot with alcohol on the palate, carbonation is soft and mellow the body is medium but soaked with alcohol.

I can pick up some whiskey and oak in the nose. There is a little bit of sweet malt hidden behind the barrel aging aromas. I can taste orange citrus and sweet caramel malts up front. As I swallow, I pick up the whiskey, but without any burning feeling. The finish is almost a bit funky. It's interesting. This aging complements the already great Dead Guy. The beer has a heavy body. I can really feel the carbonation in each swallow. It also feels a bit creamy. A thin coat is left behind. My glass of this beer is pretty drinkable, but the brew isn't as suited for multiple rounds like the regular Dead Guy is.

It has a nice oak barrel sourness and whiskey flavor, followed by a general malt sweetness, with vanilla to boot. I can't say that I can pick up any specific malt flavor, the whiskey seems to neutralize that, but it does a good job balances the barrel flavors. The feel is on the light side with nice carbonation, drinks well, fairly crisp. For a whiskey barrel aged brew, this drinks incredibly awesome.

Oranges and tea come through in the flavor, on a medium toasted malt body. Whiskey is subtle but evident in the toasted oak undertones. Upfront sweetness fades to a semi dry finish with lingering oily hops, toasty caramel and oak. This beer comes to life as it warms. Balanced and subtle, with some really nice flavors to be found if you look hard enough.","bcm119","Feb 19, 2010"

Can't really scent anything from the Helles Bock. The taste is very interesting. The regular dead guy is there, but there are strong whiskey flavor up front that mellows out to a very strong vanilla note. There is also an odd flavor, it's almost like an artificial peach flavor.

Taste is a delicious, mild, yet well blended concoction of toasted grains, sweet carmel, vanilla, oak, whiskey, tropical fruit and coconut. Great smooth body, light carbonation, not sticky and no aftertaste. Very good beer... the coconut was a big suprise and the toned down whiskey heat is very welcomed after too many barrel aged beers going overboard.","rfgetz","Feb 13, 2010"
4.03,5.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear copper, medium aber color with good bubbling. The head dissipates pretty quick, but leaves some nice filmy foamy film on the top. The aroma is a toasty caramel malt snuff, but lets not forget the hint of vanilla and oak whiskey that gives you a little suffle of interest towards the end of each sniff. The taste starts with wet, toasted bread with a little unsalted butter on it. The middle has a more caramel and toasted grain flavor with just a splash of mellow whiskey. The finish is amost creamy in texture with some vanilla and even more mellow whiskey flavors. But added t that comes the very faintly roasted oak barrels that the whiskey was aged in. This is a nice alternative to the original Dead Guy ale. This is sessionable, but since it an oak aged, whiskey barrel maibock, it seems almost a little too specia for a session beer.","scruffwhor","Feb 13, 2010"

3.47,-8.9,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Close to two finger head of off-white foam, densely whipped with a puddle of larger bubbles in the center, dissipates easily without much lacing left behind. Good degree of transparency to the copper to amber color, drops off to a pumpkin orange at the rims, very loosely dispersed bubbles within. The oak vanilla, butterscotch, honey notes extremely clear in the nose, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple fruit next, quick burst of pink grapefruit, however, nothing really "edgy," some cocoa and solid cloves, the indistinct hoppiness gives it lift before vacating your nostrils. Medium-bodied, sort of a flat mouth feel, the carbonation seems half-hearted. Given the lack of zip, the vanilla, butterscotch, maple, caramel oak sinks in even deeper. Kinda nutty at times. Twigs, wood and bark more than grassiness, not that much citrus here, white grapefruit. At times comes close to a coffee rind bitterness. The apricot, cherry, peach, pear fruit not really enunciating loudly. Creamy texture makes it harder to discern individual flavors. If you like the first sip, you'll like them all. If not, it's a monochrome, homogeneous glass of beer.","farrago","Feb 12, 2010"

I didn't really feel as though the whiskey could be smelled and the taste had a hint of it at best. I also didn't think it taste quite like dead guy, but on the upside it had a very nice vanilla/malty taste that made it very smooth and easy to drink.

I pick up some faint oak but its really hidden. Taste is sweet with honey, toffee and caramel up front. I get the whiskey, vanilla, and oak next. Then a stinging higher alcohol that's almost vodka like and hop bitterness in the finish. Thick sticky mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation, medium body. I tried to enjoy this one, but its not for me. I don't think the flavors meld very well and the alcohol burn kills it for me.","johnnnniee","Feb 10, 2010"

Apparently aging it in whiskey barrels makes it a great beer. The harsh whiskey note is exactly what it needs, given that my main complaint about Dead Guy is that it's too bland and sweet. The whiskey barrel aging gives character to the sweetness and boldness to the flavor (and aroma) as a whole.","Pahn","Feb 03, 2010"

The nose has components of sweet bready malt, light vanilla and faint wood/smoke. Tasty malted up ale, notes of rum, more vanilla, a light woodyness that delicatly interweaves itself through this beer, thoroughly enjoyable and nicely crafted.

Standard Dead Guy aroma of bready yeast, light hoppiness, but there's another woody/vanilla dimension that adds a nice touch. Flavor is dead on what I expected. Dead Guy with a touch of vanilla and wood but very light on the actual whiskey flavor. However, everything is well-integrated in this beer. I never thought this would be a great candidate for wood aging, but Rogue proved me wrong. I like Dead Guy Ale, and I thought this was a great version of it.","KeefD","Jan 29, 2010"
