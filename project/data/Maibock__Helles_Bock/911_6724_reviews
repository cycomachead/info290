"O: A decent bock, anyone expecting layer upon later might be disappointed, but this is what a Helles Bock should taste like."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty high carbonation, but it's quite smooth and has no alch. presence at nearly 7%. This wasn't to my tastes but refreshing in a way for it's maltiness."
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"Overall a pretty nice beer, strength nicely toned down and very drinkable."
"I am neither a big fan nor an expert in the field of Helles Bockbier, but I enjoy the clean taste of this and the fact that the alcohol is so well hidden. It tastes like a Munich Helles with elevated malt sweetness and abv, but I guess this is just what the style is about. I will keep researching this style."
"O: Well, it looked kind of crappy, but then it turned and my high expectations came true. A very nice Maibock."
""
""
"This is the first Maibock I've tried and it came as a complete surprise - I was expecting a variation on a normal Helles, but this really is an altogether different beer. It's the perfect blonde lager for anyone who loves Doppelbocks."
""
""
"A slightly above average maibock, but its lack of availability is nothing to be concerned about - some locally available beers are comparable or more satisfying."
"Overall - Mouthfeel needs some work but the beer has a nice flavour. The highlight is probably the scent. Good for the style but not something I'd be on the look out for in the future."
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color helles with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of solid floral malt notes with light sugar notes and some light buttery notes. Taste is also a mix between some floral malt with quite sweet malt backbone with light buttery notes which are more or less pleasant. Body is full with somewhat of an oily texture with good carbonation. Interesting and easily drinkable though not sure such alcohol level is required and the buttery notes are a bit strong for my taste buds."

"Thanks to Thirstybird for the opportunity to try this one. 500ml bottle served at 49 degrees in a pilsener glass. 02 05 12 indicated on the back label (I'm assuming this is a consume before date). Pours a translucent yellow-gold with a creamy, one inch bright white head. Tiny bubbles present in-solution effervesce to the underside of the cap. Head eventually disperses into a semi-conisstent skim - some spots of lacing, but no legs. Nose expresses fruity esters, a light grassiness and the merest suggestion of yeast. Taste follows nose - flavor profile is not at all cloying like some Maibocks in my experience. There's a really pleasant balance in the malt profile, light fruitiness and a crisp, unassuming hops character. Mouthfeel is light in body with an even and consistent carbonation and a kiss of acidity at the finish to cleanse the palate. Overall, a really solid brew - perhaps a little past its prime; perhaps not. That said, very pleasant and balanced without asserting itself too much. I'd love to try this beer on-draft."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the German style Hells Bock."

"Overall: All around top notch beer for it's style. Having tried all of the Andechs beers I can guarantee you that any of their styles will not stray far from exemplary. I did not happen to see this one on tap when I was there though. Regardless, the Kloster Andechs is a beer connoisseurs Mecca!!! Prosit!!!"
"O- Highly refreshing for the ABV and an easy drinker. There is no complexity at all though"
"D - Very drinkable and a recommended brew"
"Pours a golden yellow with medium, long-lasting head. Aroma is moderate with hints of grassy hops, bread, and lemon. Taste is dominated by the sweet malts with a touch of citrus, bread, and a slight grassy hop on the end. Bitterness is minimal but noticable. Finishing is very sweet."
"This is a good beer that doesn't quite fit into any style category. I think the closest match is a modern, Munich style Oktoberfestbier, although it is a little too strong. Calls itself a bock, but it's too light to be even a Maibock and is as strong as some doppelbocks. Regardless, a top quality, drinkable if unexciting strong lager."
"Prost!"
"Pours golden with a bit of an orange tint to it. The initial head was quite a few fingers high, though it died down somewhat quickly without really leaving any lacing. A bit of a light head around the edges. Nose is some mild grain with a bit of light fruit and cream. Flavor is slight grain and some very mild brown. A tiny bit of toffee. Light feel with low to medium carbonation. Drinks pretty well, especially considering the 6.9% ABV."
"This beer appears clear and yellow in color. There is a small head that leaves just a hint of lacing. The aroma is very pleasant and distinctly German in style. The beer tastes fresh and clean. The flavors are very well-balanced. There is an underlying sweetness present in the aroma as well as throughout the taste, though it is well done and certainly not of the cloying nature. This is a very tasty beer and a solid example of the style. If you enjoy German lagers, Klosterbrauerei Andechs brews some of the best around."
"Beer is light in body with moderate carbonation on the palate. It seems to get thicker as I drink more. Minimal sweetness and a nice clean finish with only minimal bitterness on the backend. Its not as good as the doppelbock IMO but its a great lighter pilsner without being watery or thin. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is fairly simple. I get notes of grain and grassy hops but not too much else. The flavor is better. I get grain, apples and grapes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability - I could drink this beer all day and double on Sunday. Although the alcohol content may be higher than some, you won't notice it because you'll be enjoying the taste so much. For a brewery that has existed since the Middle Ages, they have definitely kept up with the tastes and flavors of present day. If you can find anything from Andechs, buy it and enjoy it with zeal!"
"Notes: Pretty good beer. A little sweet and grainy, but it isn't bad. All around a pretty good beer."
"Yet again, another surprisingly good beer in a style that is normally not my favorite. This is really a world apart from Dead Guy in hop profile and sweetness. It really continues to amaze me what two brewers can produce within the same style. Cheers and here's to an early Spring!"
"D: Good. Despite the 6.9% ABV."
"This is a pale, strong lager which is generally decent. Unfortunately, it lacks the x-factor that would make this beer great."
"The mouthfeel is smashing and drinkability is very high since alcohol is barely noticeable"
"not much head on pour. Aroma nice and clean, malty, perhaps a tad of alcohol in addition to heavy malt. Flavor is good, again clean and malty, a touch spicy (maybe cinnamon, just a faint hint, from hops perhaps (some noble hop types are described as having a cinnamon note?). Overall quite nice!"
"The taste is very good, making up for the poor showing with head. The mouthfeel is just right to drink many of these. I like this beer, and have had it after having their doppelbock. I would definitely go for the doppelbock over this, but this is nothing to scoff at. This is quite the treat! Light (not boozy tasting), but still a fairly heavy (boozy) beer."
"Not quite as good as the doppelbock to me as I prefer the darker bock flavors, but this is one of the best pale bocks I've ever had."
"This actually feels a bit on the fuller bodied side. Bergbock Hell is definitely a beer to be enjoyed thoroughly and thoughtfully."
"Then the glasses were empty, and we cried - again..."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth with moderate carbonation and a medium-to-heavy body."
"Overall, this is a beer worth trying. I haven't had many bocks yet, so it's hard for me to compare it to anything. It's definitely a good beer though."
"Flavor is most excellent. It's a helles bier with balls, basically. A fuller mouthfeel, thanks to the higher amount of malts, and an elevated hop bitterness make this one a keeper for me. It's a great beer to have when you want something stronger and more satisfying than a pils, but not something too heavy, such as doppelbock or stout. That said, this stuff is still pretty malt-forward and doughy.Touch of alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel has fine, medium carbonation. Very tasty."
"Pours a clear gold with a white head of large bubbles. The aroma reminds me of their doppelbock for the smokey character. Other than the smoke, the aroma is a bit subdued with an odd peppermint-like note in the background of the slightly fruity malts. The flavor has a sweet applesauce ester character of the lightly toasted malts. The aftertaste has a pepery hop bite, but nothing too big or bad. I may have had better maibocks, but this one is certainly different and interesting."
"Either this beer is off or it just sucks. I was hoping for more from Andescher."
"Bottle purchased at Delirium in Brussels. After trying the doppelbock, I had to try some of their other beers. The beer poured a golden color with a thick off white head. The nose and the taste were a bit earthy and hoppy and also had caramel notes to round out the beer. Nice mouthfeel and pretty easy to drink."
"Not quite a session beer because of its ABV content, but this one feels very drinkable."
"Had on tap at the Klosterbrauerei Andechs, served in a 0.5L glass along with dinner. The beer was clear yellow with a thick and creamy head. The smell was malty and sweet, and the flavor followed suit. There was a thickness to the mouthfeel which was unexpected, leaving the sweet wort flavors coated on the tongue. Easily drinkable, you cannot tell it's almost 7%. Excellent beer, and highly recommended."
"Taste is very malty with a good bitter and some liquorice. It is all very clean and relies more on the big maltiness and bitter. The light caramalt gives an aftertaste of vanilla and honey. Mouthfeel is very smooth."
"D- drinkable enough, but not sure if i really like the idea of helles bock, id rather go the full hog and drink a doppelbock, or the other way and have a munich helles lager. Will need to drink more helles bock, as not overly familiar with the style. Also this bottle im suspecting may be stale for some reason, will need to get another to compare. A nice enough beer in its own right."

"D - Very easy drinker considering the strength. I'm not particularly familiar with the style, but this was very tasty."
"Very clean and easy drinking Maibock. This particualr bottle hasn't left my fridge since returning from Germany last year, but tastes just like it did when I sampled a bottle there. Review combined from notes taken when fresh, and my most current assesment, score taken from notes."
"M&D: overall the body is mellow and soothing, while the soft carbonation makes a perfect mouthfeel for one to fully enjoy this high-gravity beer easily. But, since this is only my second time to try this beer style (the first being Rogue Dead Guy Ale that is way too hoppy by German standards, I believe), it's beyond my ability to appreciate its ""greatness", if there's any. To me, it's a rather simple, deeply grainy lager crying for hops to salvage its biased performance. Perhaps it's meant to be like that, and the beer as it is is still well-crafted, evinced by the overall balance and mellow body shown in my glass and on my tongue. But still it's not my cup of tea--or is the under-performance to do with the expiry issue? I'll never know."
"D: Could be trouble!"
"Sweet aftertaste, malt again, and honey, and some finishing hop."
"Bham UK"
"Very creamy head, otherwise light yellow to look at, with carbonation bubbles. Middling mouthfeel, smooth but also above average carbonation. Bitter initially, grassy, and alcohol presence. satisfying clean and malty finish. Butter oil and malt aftertaste. Fresh aroma. Thanks Mr. Madsberg."
"Nice long mildly bitter aftertaste. The alcohol is completely masked -- dangerously easy to drink."
"D - This is really easy to drink dispite its sweetness and high alcohol, neither of which are over done and both of which are wonderfully integrated."
"Good poorout with nice head and beautifull and cristal clear goldenbronze beercolor. Nose is very delicate with sweetmaltarome and delicate hopnote; probably of a good Halletau hop. Alltogether make it a fresh and fruity nose of grape/strawberry with good cornarome around it. Taste is fine too being very sweetmalty and drinking as a strong Maerzen. Enough but only litle hops make it a very balanced brew with a very enjoyable mouthfeel and aftertaste. Great brew IMHO."
"Drinkability: I must admit, if my memory serves me correctly, this is the first Miabock I've had. So I don't have anything to compare it to. However, I find it to be a recommendable beer. It has a big flavor, but is not overpowering."
"This bock poured a clear, gold color with tall, white foam that lingered and clung to the glass. There was a good, steady stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was malty with a light sweetness. The taste was malty with a light sweetness yet with a good hoppiness. There was a hint of floral hops following the touch of Munich malt up front. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry overall with medium body and good carbonation. The maltiness and light hoppiness lingered pleasantly in the aftertaste. This was a very nice bock, one of the better bockbiers I have sampled in Bamberg."
"A golden orange color with a nice head. I couldn't notice anything in the smell. A very enjoyable mouthfeel. The taste is grainy and fruity, with peaches and lemon. A deep flour (maybe leaven) aspect in the taste, that I found very interesting. Smooth. Great. The hops are well hidden, and the beer has a great drinkability. I would go for this beer again."
"Gotta thank Senior Shit and his wife, Mrs. Shit for the fine brew."
".5 litre bottle dated 10/03/03 - probably just over a month old. Brought back from a trip to Germany. Very fresh. Pours a brilliantly clear - almost glowing - golden body topped by a frothy bright white head that holds extremely well. Averaged size bubbles slowly stream to the surface completing the picture perfect appearance. The aroma of clean, sweet malt and mellow grassy hops greets you as the beer is poured. It's full bodied with a moderate carbonation that gives it a mouthfeel that's almost chewy, quite creamy, and rather smooth - definitely adding to the drinkability in such a big, sweetish beer. The flavor is outstandingly rich with clean, sweet, grainy malt (offering no defects whatsoever), and infused with softly grassy hop flavors. The bitterness is limited to simply balancing the sweet malt, but the hop flavors are surprisingly bright (which may have do do with this samples freshness). The alcohol is extremely well hidden, and only becomes remotely apparent in the taste somewhere past the middle of the serving - although you can feel it a little bit before that. The sweet maltiness never becomes cloying, and I'm guessing that in addition to the supportive bitterness, the high level of alcohol helps with that. A very rich but easy to drink beer that's extremely well brewed. A perfect example of the style."
