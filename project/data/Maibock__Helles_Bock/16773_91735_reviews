"Pour is dark golden amber with lots of white head and some larger bubbles with a fair bit of lace.  Nose is heavily malted and a bit stale, lots of caramel malts, overly toasted, lots of sugar.  Taste follows suit, a little less stale, way too much sugar, lots of caramel malts and toasted grains, very little hop profile and no clean grains.  Syrupy feel, soft carb, too big and full."

"Overall: Decent, drinkable fare."

"Overall: The malt body is leading the way no doubt.  I would love that dialed back a touch so the hops could shine through a little brighter.  An interesting interpretation on the style but I can dig it."

"Very good lager. Slight sweetness to it."
"A nice light lager with a bit of taste.  Very smooth mouth feel and slightly sweet, with a bitter aftertaste."

"This pours a golden amber color with an average head. The aroma is mild with hops and yeast. The taste is unique and not what I was expecting. Certainly there is room for improvement but this is fairly decent and worth a try especially from a brewery you don't hear a whole lot about."

"My first Local Option beer.Pours into a half liter stein a chill hazed honey tinged golden with a large quick to fade crown atop.Aromas of sweet pizza dough and caramel with a tinge of alcohol,on the sweeter side for sure.Pretty sweet on the palate as well really with caramel malts and mild butteriness,light drying in the finish with a hint of sourness.I search out maibocks and love to find a good one,this is ok but to sweet for the style to be really good in my opinion."

"500 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced earthy hop, bready malt, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, honey, toast, biscuit, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of earthy hops, bready malts, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good maibock. Robust and well balanced earthy hop, bready malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"I liked this beer overall because it was a decent lager and had some really nice bready, malty qualities, however, it was too hoppy for a traditional German-style bock bier. The alcohol level was decent for the style."

"First impression is of the carbonation which runs very high. Slightly soured pale malt flavor with a hop bitterness as a counterpoint. Easy to drink. No signs of alcohol."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, lemon and a tart vegetal element. Flavor of biscuit and mildly bready malt, wheat, lightly tart lemon and apple juice, finishing with biscuit and European hop flavor and bitterness. Medium bodied. An interesting take on a bock style beer, more similar in profile to a biscuity lager, but with light German bock flavors woven into the taste. At first the lagerish malt and hops are unexpected from a bock, somewhat drier, but the flavor is intriguing and pleasant. Although it is not really to style, this beer has suggestions towards the original maibock while presenting its own malty flavors. Drier and less sweet than a typical maibock, but an enjoyable beer. As the beer opened up in the glass, a pleasant floral element developed in the hop finish."

"this is everything a bright bock should be, grain driven, clear pale golden in color, heady, dense, clean finishing, and bready as the authentic german editions, but it is also some things it shouldn't be, semisweet, overly filling, and expensive. lager yeast marries well with robust grain, maybe some wheat, but definitely german pale malt, and the result is a decidedly malty and heavy light beer, carbonated like its namesake literally demands, but still filling and heavy to drink a lot of. not as clean finishing as others, and while the lager yeast tries its hardest, the residual sugar is still there in enough concentration to make this even more filling. i like american made bocks, and this is a pretty good one as they go, with a nice nod to tradition, but its not quite as clean as it should be, and its rather pricey at 9 bucks a go."

" The taste is very good, nice crisp malt with white grape and peppery hop flavor with toasted notes and mild hints of raw almond and bread crumb flavors with nice grainy taste adding toasted accent with some hop spice lingering and a low amount of alcohol in the finish. Overall I really loved the taste, complexity and shear ease of drinkability."
"A nice looking beer that doesn't quite follow-up with taste, aroma, or feel. There is just there barest hint of toasted malt, but it's strongly overshadowed with a brazen bitterness. The mouthfeel comes across coarsely. Drinkable (barely) but definitely unbalanced and unrefined."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like bready/grainy malt, floral hops, toffee, and some fruitiness. I think this taste is mostly like the aroma, but there's also some honey, nuts and light citrus flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, smooth and easy enough to drink. It's also well carbonated. I liked this brew, I'd buy it again in the future. $5.99 a bottle."
"O - It is what it is, nothing earth shattering or blind blowing."
"O-A Maibock review in November...oh well. As I mentioned above, this brew has a slightly odd and random assortment of flavors, some of which fit the traditional profile for the style, and some of which don't. There is potential here for a nice, interesting, drinkable Maibock, and this brew was worth a try, but Voku Hila isn't quite where it needs to be for mass consumption."
"O: It was listed as a strong lager there. Not bad."

"If I ever own goats, I'm gonna make sure they have mohawks... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy sunset brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises dry wheat, mild grass, flowers, light honey, and a touch of sweet oatmeal. Honestly, there are certain sniffs that elicit memories of Honey Nut Cheerios (only positively, considering I dislike the cereal). The taste brings in more of the same, along with candied orange peel, light powdered sugar, and a light kiss of red apple skin. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying-ish finish. Overall, a solid, enjoyable helles bock, one that follows tradition to a point, then proceeds down its own path. We need more of that in our beer lives..."

"O: As with most Local Option beers, I'm sure this beer is supposed to be a recreation of some long lost style or recipe. However, while this beer is drinkable, its not particularly enjoyable and probably should have been left to the ages."
"O: Much more beer than I expected to come from this bottle; an imperial lager if there ever was one. Thankfully, it turned out to be a great example of a bold helles lager. I have a hard time comparing this to any other beers I’ve ever tried – maybe that’s one of the reasons I like it so much."

"Wow, this is a bad lager. Basically everything is wrong. I don't know what they were thinking when making this? Avoid."
"O: This beer seems easy to drink compared to other maibocks because it seems lighter-bodied compared to other beers in the style."
"It does taste quite authentic however. I've had much worse American lager attempts."
""
""
"Where the beer lacks the authentic taste of Bavaria, it seems rather inspired by those brewing traditions, but uses common grains and techniques that are known to U.S. microbreweries. But regardless of its authenticity, it's a welcome taste in my glass to usher in spring. Now bring on warmer weather!"
