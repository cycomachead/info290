The hops are a bit forward in the flavor and the yeast adds some flavor with spiciness accentuated by the moderately high alcohol in the taste. The malt is toasty and slightly thick with low sweetness and generally grainy when combined with the yeast drying alcohol and hops. Overal this is decent but there are better examples of this style from East Coast brewers or Midwest breweries, but for the price it is a better than average pale bock.","Slatetank","Apr 16, 2013"

My my my. Nose had an unexpected earthiness accompanied by a caramel maltiness. Curiouser and curiouser. "Drink Me!" it cried to me. What sort of host would I be not to comply with the wishes of an invited guest? Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness, and I got a bit of heat from it as I swirled it on my tongue. The taste was very earthy with a flavor that I imagine standing in a field of barley in central Canada in the summer would be like. I have been getting smarter about distillation and I would bet that this recipe in a still would create a great single malt whiskey.

It has a great appearance and an easy-drinking mouthfeel, but its taste leaves something to be desired. For one, it's too hoppy for a Pale Bock. Full Sail lists this beer as having 45 IBUs, which is just too high for the Bock style (which should be around 20-30 IBUs). If youre a hop-head, you'll like this rendition of the Bock style, but it's just too hoppy for me. Secondly, I get pronounced hits of butter/diacetyl flavors that just dont belong in this beer.

An odd flavor combination, but kind of grew on me as I drank this. Medium bodied. An interesting malty ale.

Clean and dry malty nose that leans more toward fresh-baked bread with a spicy, woody hoppiness to round it out. Not lacking in crispness, it refreshes the palate with each sip. Hops run at the palate in a bold manner, yet leave more than enough wiggle room for the malt to plant a thick grainy flavor. Alcohol does not pass by without notice; warmth meshes with the spiciness of the hops. Bitter, dry finish.

Dry bready malts dominate the front of the aroma, some sweetish malt in the middle packed up by floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, a bit sweet but not an adjunct corn taste ala BMCs, a surprising amount of bitterness on the back end which got more aggressive as it warmed. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, decent effervescence. A bit hoppy for the style, which is good.

This is different than most American style pale lagers I have had, so it is a fun a d different change from a cool local brewery. All I can say is that I wish I had jumped on the LTD train earlier. This pours an amber color with a 1" white head that slowly dissipates, leaving some lacing. Smell is of grain and some hops. Taste is primarily a light sweetish malt followed by those wilamette hops. I am especially impressed that this was made using only one kind of malt and one variety of hops. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation.
