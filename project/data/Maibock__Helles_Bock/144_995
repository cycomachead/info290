3.71,-1.6,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a hazy deep gold/pale amber producing 2+ fingers of eggshell, finely bubbled foamy & somewhat lasting head that leaves a beautiful coating of lacing. Aroma is malty, white bread, toast, caramel, honey, slight floral & grass hops. Taste is similar but more robust. Bread, butter & something similar to a candied fruit are in the lead through mid-sip with the hops manifesting nicely in the finish & aftertaste. Nicely bitter in the finish that follows through & increases in the aftertaste. Like Mendocino Spring Seasonal Bock Beer this brew is reminiscent of an English Pale Ale, especially the buttery character. And also as with Mendocino Bock Beer, there is a metallic note, from mid-sip through finish that intensifies in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, oily, slick & coating on the tongue.","mothmanscott","Dec 03, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, pepper, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, pepper, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with good complexity; good amount of robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice maibock! Very nice balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; and great example of the style.","superspak","Feb 06, 2013"

The nose was pears and floral. Mouthfeel was a bit average. Taste was a surprise to me. The front end was very sweet with a honey like flavor and the finish had a respectable hoppy bite which was well balanced.

Pretty drinkable with some brown sugar sweetness mixed in with the sour malt, almost a vague brandy sort of hint going on. It's also got some dry grass hop notable at the finish.

2.56,-32.1,3,2,3,3,2,"Pours dark golden, heavy carbonation, real nice lacing on this. No real head to speak of. This has a really malty scent, almost sickly sweet smell to it. Not really my thing. I always thought I really liked Mai Bocks, but I think it's the season I like more than the beer. Way too sweet for me and no hop taste to speak of. It's not Sprecher's fault, just more my evolving tastes in what I enjoy. Definitely tastes better as it warms. Mouthfeel isn't anything special, it's a little heavy. 6% ABV, but feels like it has a little more kick to it. Definitely high drinkability, but not for me.

Smell is very sweet and malty, caramel covered apples, iron, bread, citrus, touch of spice, more apple, hint of alcohol, interesting. Taste is similar, caramel and apples, buttery, bread, some spice, slightly metallic and a bit medicinal in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not very bock like, flavours are kind of muddy and not clean.","Viggo","Sep 01, 2007"

4.25,12.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Served chilled, in a nonic. Medium pour produces a two-fingered, pale tan head of good duration and moderate lacing. Golden-copper in color, and brilliant. The nose is very expressive, with plenty of piney hops, light spice (clove?) and honeydew melon. Bright, crisp, and mildly sweet on the first sip. The dry hopping does seem to be evident, with the hops full of spicy, perfumey lupulin charm. Malt profile is easy-going yet equally as chatty as the hops, with a round feel, biscuity notes, light caramel, and overall not-quite sweet. Fairly mild bitterness, although the character of the hop really stays with you more than the bitterness itself. Notes of fruit are light but pleasant, with citrus (grapefruit), golden apple, and melon. Fairly dry in the finish, and yeah, I can even taste the hops when I burp! Medium bodied but rather light on the palate altogether. Readily sessionable. This is a fresh batch, and it really comes across this way by way of its taste and crisp, expressive hop qualities. I'm happy to see Sprecher beers back in the Twin Cities area.","Chaz","Aug 11, 2006"

Taste is malts and sour apple, with a mildly sweet aftertaste dotted with cherries. While it has a lot of sweet flavors, none of them are overwhelming and the little bits of sourness and malts help to balance things. Nice mouthfeel and carbonation.

This beer has a nice sweet grain nutty taste as well as some buttery biscuity characters. Not much hop bitterness to this at all, but that doesn't seem to be the purpose of this beer.

Nice and sweet upfront with caramel flavors, cleansing middle, and a very prolonged bitterness at the end. Alcohol flavors were noticeable, but mixed well with the malt flavors and hop bitterness.

Honey, tropical fruit, caramel and an herbal hop finish are most notable in the taste department. Mouthfeel is fairly full and not overly fizzy. This is satisfying and quite drinkable.

Hops immediately balance the good malt early and dominate the finish and aftertaste as well. The predominant sweet counterpoint is a sense of buttered toast with confectioner's sugar, quite nice.
