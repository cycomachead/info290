"Another OK beer in a tall can. This is obviously mass produced Bock, intended to be consumed in substantial quantities. The high alcohol content is well hidden, so this would be a dandy beer for an Octoberfest Oom Pa Pa."

"Overall - Definitely not terrible and the alcohol is virtually imperceptible (when cold) but otherwise not terribly exciting."

"Starts off neutral, mostly pale malt. There's a creaminess to the flavor. The swallow sours a bit and the aftertaste is brief. I note a brief spice of hop just after the swallow. The body is proper; the carbonation tilts toward the higher side."

"Pale blonde/orange colour, one finger of white head with some retention and no lace to speak of. Smell is malty and bready, sweet candy like notes, some fruits come across as well, light hint of corn and some alcohol. Taste is malty and fairly sweet, some green apple flavours as well, light alcohol heat, some grassy notes come off as well, lightly bitter, malty-sweet finish. Light carb, med-full body, decent weight. This is a fairly average beer and in all respects isn't very good however, there is something I really enjoy about this beer and I will still buy this as my staple ""one for the road"" beer."

"O- I'm not appalled by this beer, it is just a hefty adjunct lager in my opinion and not worthy of my glass lol..."
"O - I will check this off on my bucket list - no need to ""experience"" this one again."

"overall, its not a beer i will remember that much. but for now, it works before lunch time."
"Overall – The taste seemed little bit harsh at times, but for the most part it's a fairly enjoyable above average beer. Not something I'd ever buy again but it wasn't a waste of money."
"Overall, this definitely tastes like a maibock and not just a strong lager, but it isn't the best representation of the style."
"Holsten Maibock started off as a Seinfeld episode – a beer about nothing – but became more like a David Lynch film: pretty strange, hard to assess and even harder to tell if I liked it. I'm not sure what to think – I love the style but it is inherently a pale, strong lager which means that, if done poorly, it constitutionally becomes a “malt liquor”. That confusion doesn't happen with the style's best examples. With this one, however, it’s up to interpretation."
"Final Grade: 2.88, a C grade."
"500mL can from the LCBO. Pours a golden yellow colour with a finger of thick white head. The head dissipates leaving some patches on top of the beer. Smells quite grainy with a very faint grassy aroma. Almost no bitterness, very sweet though. Flavour is fairly clean and for a cheap high alcohol beer, I can see the appeal in this. I think it tastes better than macro lagers and it certainly punches higher at 7% alcohol."
"Poured a golden yellow, less than a finger of white head. A collar retains throughout; filtered body. Nose of light sweet malts, light cereals, some sweet pale candy and some grain. Taste follows with a general sweetness, some honey-like sweetness, cracker and some graininess in the finish. Medium-high carbonation, with a decent mouthfeel. Decent drinkability, but overall does the trick if your looking to warm up just a bit (like I was)."
"it poured a clear golden colour with a 2 finger head that left some pretty decent lacing. It smells fairly sweet with a little floral hop smell and some grassy tones. It tastes very similar to what the smell is like more malt forward with a little tangy taste of hops at the end fairly light in flavour and body but for 7% abv it is pretty easy drinking but as it warmed up to room temperature the alcohol became very pronounced but not to overbearing."
"An adequately drinkable, and certainly affordable Maibock, in the guise of a Euro strong lager, and less boozy than many Continental bocks that I've sampled. Just the thing to hit the spot as the weather unsurprisingly turns, heh, south - and it seems to work as a suitable pairing to the spicy-ass Rogan Josh that is imminently arriving to my dinner table."
"Medeum body and carbonation. A little sweet for a big session. A 500ml can of 7% is not to be taken lightly. One of my fave winter brews though."
"D- Pretty good for a getting drunk cheap beer. Not impressive tastewise though. The alcohol isn't too noticable, but it's noticable enough to take away from what could have been good."
"D - relatively easy drinking like most of the German offerings you will find in a Canadian liquor store, but the higher ABV and the metallic flavours start to build up to make the experience less enjoyable"
"D- Once I'm done this can I think I'll keep it at that. This isn't like the Festbock, which is good IMO. There isn't enough of a balance for me to want to drink this more. Might be good for a beer can chicken though, once the booze burns off, as the sweetness could liven up the meat..."
"Pours a clear light copper color, with a thin fizzy head that quickly disappears. Aroma of malt, apples, light hops, and alcohol. The taste is overly sweet and dominated by the alcohol, and very little hops in this. Gets worse as the beer warms up. Not very good.. I wasn't able to finish this, and I won't be buying this again anytime soon."
"Deep gold in colour with a poorly retained fizzy white head. Faint pale malt and alcohol aroma. It tastes like a severely under-attenuated and under-hopped pilsner. A little bit of white bread with very little hop flavour or bitterness to offset it's honeyed sweetness. Alcohol isn't hot, but still feels harsh. Everything else is so mute that booze really is the dominant flavour in this beer. Booze and sugar. Light bodied with low carbonation, it feels both thin and syrupy. Terrible beer. This must be Germanys answer to malt liqour."
"Looks like another tall boy can in the icebox, so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a pungent head shop clove smell. Pours to a golden colour with a creamy white head. Taste is a weighty funky almost skunky mix. The first thing that hits you is a dubbel-like maltiness and sweetness followed by a large and in charge hoppiness made up of noble hops. This seems like something to be imbibed in the biergarten out a 2 liter mug no less. Das ist gut, excepting for the funky twang on the aftertaste, otherwise the early workings of a belgian. Not too chabby."
"not a bad beer but not worth looking for, I doubt I'll be drinking this again soon unless I'm broke and want to wash some worries away"
"I can drink it, but I don't like it."
"Alcohol character made it feel somewhat heavy for me. One or two of these might be drinkable, but I don't think it is very favorable for a longer session."
"Overall this is just bland and inoffensive, and yet I'm having a hard time choking it down."
"Drinkable, but nothing to write home about. Probably won't pick this one up again, although for the price, it's not bad."
"D - Looks & smells ok but once it's in my mouth it loses some of its appeal. One is enough. Not as good as some of Holsten's other beers."
"Try it if you have experience with bock beers, as this may turn you off or turn you on to that type of beer. It's literally a love it or hate it kind of beer."
"D: One is enough."
"Final Thoughts - The main reason I bought this beer, was because I had a good experience with the festbock. This one however, is nowhere near as good an offering. One beer was enough of this stuff. Anymore then one, I think it would outstay it's welcome."
"1 and done for me. Someone mentioned it needs more hop to balance it out. Very 1 dimensional."
"Taste - pretty bad, all things considered. Sticky sweet, slight grainy pils malt character. Something vegetal in there. It does have a sort of 'cheap-malt-liquor' flavour to it, that's hard to explain. Finishes softly malty - the finish is actually quite nice. Does have some 'lowenbrau-like' highlights. Leaves some alcohol warming. Not sure I'll be able to finish this can, or end up pouring it out. Boil it down a bit, and pour it on pancakes might be ok..."
"CAN you get excited over a beer? I love watching the head approach the top of the glass as I hang out on somebody's C/S couch. This got a finger's worth of weak, bone-white heas with low retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a definite lager-sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a really sugary taste on the tongue. Finish was syrupy-sweet. Man, it just needed to be toned down a wee tad. A steady diet of this would make me a diabetic."
"Poured a hazy orange/yellow with one finger of head that idssipated very quicly, leaving no lacing on the glass. Smelled mildly grassy, a little grainy. Grassy taste, some more mellow bitter hops notes. Alcohol comes through as the beer warms. No real discernable malt tastes. Fairly strong carbonation bites the tongue, low-medium body. Bitter taste clings to the tongue for some time afterwards. Not an unpleasant brew, but the alcohol hits you pretty strongly."
"I tried this beer on March 18, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent orangy-gold colour with a generous white fluffy head that disappeared quite quickly. The aroma was very grassy with very little other discernable aromas. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, ample carbonation, with a little bitterness. The flavour was again a lot of grass with a little bit of hoppy bitterness. When it comes to Holsten brews, this is not as good as the Festbock, but better than the Premium."
"Taste? Well, aspirin. This beer was so astringent that I could barely make out anything else for around 10 minutes. Then I noticed some honey sweetness. Obviously, it's hoppy, but it's far too astringent to be enjoyable. However, you couldn't detect the higher alcohol content. I'm not sure if that's a plus or not."
"Anyone whos ever drank Lowenbrau (the stuff that's actually made in europe) will recognise the flavours of this beer. It almost seems like Holsten stole the Lowenbrau recipe and fortified it a bit."
"I'm not a fan."
"this beer is drinkable but i would much rather have somthing else."
"D - Great drinkablility, and very refreshing. Not too strong or powerful to be hindering on the drinkability."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable given the strength of the beer and its odd flavours."
"Overall this is the last Holsten beer im ever having, maybe i got a bad one or something"
"Sadly, the taste didn't offer much in the way of thrills. It was malty and a bit fruity with only faint hops leading to a dry finish. Thin and watery mouthfeel. This may be a bit of a crazy observation, but it almost tasted like a watered-down Belgian tripel to me."
"This may have set me off Holsten for life."
"Crisp hop bitterness hits the palate with a decent malt body but it tasted like the can somewhat. No alcohol was detected whilst it was cold. A good froth in the mouth sweetens it up and releases the alcohol presence. A good smooth beer but still feels like a european macro with a higher alcohol content. As it warms up the alcohol is more present on the palate. Not bad, but all the while I still felt like this was a Heineken with a higher grain bill."
"I could see myself drinking this in the future, if only to supplement the festbock. Although the smell is not very nice, you get used to it after a couple sips."
"D: Have one, then move on to something else that will challenge your tastebuds."
"Pours a medium piss yellow with almost no head. Smell is nearly non-existant, with a bit of slightly rotten grain and perhaps a touch of hops. Taste is medicinal, with piles of phenol and corn, and very little hoppiness or anything of any interest. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but still with some crisp carbonation, and drinkability is decent. Disappointing."
"Poured a dark orange with a little head, not too bad to look at. Smell is nothing special, a little metallic actually. Taste is rather sour with offensive bitterness and skunkyness reminiscent of a bad malt liquor. It however does not leave much of a lingering aftertaste which is not too bad, and it is somewhat bearable. I don't expect I'll be revisiting this one any time soon."
"D - A bit strong for a session beer, but quite tasty IMO. Starts off like a tripel but finishes like a vienna lager? or a pils maybe. I like it."
"Overall this is an okay beer, but taste wise there are better beers out there."
"Skip it."
"The head on my Holsten maibock started wispy and quickly disappeared. The beer's colour is golden and nothing out of the ordinary. I enjoyed the sweet maltiness of the taste. The relatively high ABV isn't driven to the fore.Not imbibing in many bocks, I can't fairly compare this beer to others of its type. I did like it, though, and would try it again."
"Can: Poured a golden color beer with below average head. Aroma is quite weak for a bock and only faint malt can be detected. Taste is very disappointing, kind of like a foul lager. Body is bit thin with some alcohol burn. Total lack of complexity in this beer."
"Pours out to a bright, golden, lager-like color in the glass with a slight head. Aroma is that or caramel and bread dough. The taste is excellent and in my opinion, very underrated here. There is a malt sweetness that isn't cloying, yet balanced on the swallow. I would drink this again without hesitation. A bit high ABV for a session beer, but I think I could handle the session... ;-)"
"It's so rare that you come accross a maibock on the shelf, let alone in January. This one poured a golden yellow color with a thin head that left some lacing. Nice yeasty bock aroma with some good malt and little or no hops. The flavor is good, bitter then breadlike maltiness, and then an odd finish, dry and corn bread like. Overall, this is a nice surprise, even if it doesn't pack the maltiness of other maibocks that I've tried."
"Pours a golden with a big whispy near white head that becomes a foam ring quite quickly. The aroma is of bready, slightly fruity, toasty malts and wiffs of hops and corn. The taste is very thin with a prominent alcohol feel. Theres a little bit of husky grain and a lager yeast crispness. The hops are overpowered by rubbing alcohol alcohol flavors. Maybe this beer was too thoroughly fermented, its body is thinnish and it lacks depth in its malt profile. The mouthfeel is watery and unevenly carbonated. Theres a sweet slightly vegetal finish. This beer could really use some more body to mask its 7% abv, as it is I wouldnt try it again."
"I don't know, I keep thinking I got a bad can. It literally got worse and worse as I struggled through it. It poured rather well for a can, clear, golden yellow with a nice white head. Smell, why do I smell rum? Taste, ack! It's like there is a shot of rum in this! The ABV is not hidden at all. It's like boilmaker, to be chugged, not savoured. Sorry folks, I tried but this one was most unpleasent..."
"500 mL can with a clearly marked freshness date on the bottom."
"Strong malt in the nose that almost drowns out any hop. Sweet malt and a chewy finish dominated by the toffee like sweet malt. Gold pour with a white head and a steady stream of carbonation. This is a quite thin and boring Maibock. Rather sweet and bland."
"I don't dislike this beer eventhough it is a poor Maibock. The taste is fairly malty with a decent sweetness. This is much better than the straight pilsner that they make. It is drinkable and better than a crap NA macro but when you taste a superior maibock such as Paulener or Ayinger it does pale in comparison."
"If you want to get gooned on GOOD Euro strong beer buy an Okocim Mocne...leave this Teutonic urine sample on the shelf."
"Appearance: Can't be a true maibock, golden tone thin white head disappears in seconds, lacing yeah right. Aroma: Touch of hallertau grainy sweetness, this seems disappointingly bland. Taste: Alcohol is evident and overbearing on the grainy cloying sweetness malt liquor like flavor, this sucks. Mouthfeel: Thin watery undercarbonated. Drinkability: Wow, I only paid about a dollar for it the date was good, I had to pour this one down the drain it was horrible."
"Not the best of Holsten. This is just a bland, nothing special, high alcohol, beer. It pours out a very light amber with no head to speak of. Nose is of some hops, alcohol, and something I didn't quite get nor was I interested enough to do so. Not much of an inviting taste - sweet malt (can malt be sweet?). The other Holstens are better."
"From a 500ml can with a freshness date on the bottom, and the ingredients on the back in around 11 different languages. It's a clear amber colour, hardly any head to it at all, and that disappears the moment you blink. The aroma is sweet and boozy, but nothing really more distinct than that. The flavour can only be described as when you accidently drink La Fin Du Monde out of the bottle, and even that is being very generous (at least Monde has some character either way). The farther down the glass I go (why am I doing this to myself?) the more cidery it starts to taste. I would actually rather drink a domestic macro than this stuff."
"Clear golden/orange pour. The head fades fast. Not much is detectable in the nose, maybe some malt and hints of caramel. Malty on the way down with an odd sweetness, again, maybe caramel (?) but not distinct. Also seems very grainy with an obvious alcohol finish. Not a great beer as far as Maibocks go."
"The high ABV is very evident in the taste of this brew which is highly malted and sweet. Nothing to get excited about here, think I will introduce this brew to my sink and avoid tomorrow's headache."
"I could see drinking a lot of these only with the distinct goal of getting drunk fast. Its like sometimes when things aren't happening fast enough you add a couple of these to the mix in between your regular 5% beers to really get the party hopping."
"This is my first beer from the Holsten Family. The beer poured with almost no head at all and looked almost flat. The smell was nothing to write home about. The first initial tastes were pretty unimpressive. After a while I 'got used' to the taste. To me this just seemed like an average beer."
