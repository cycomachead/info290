"Fairly hazy, peachy copper with a foamy cream head. Aroma is herbal and sweet, with caramel malt dominating, and a surprisingly strong whiskey and vanilla character. Flavor is also sweet and malty, with said whiskey and vanilla adding complexity, and a lightly bitter, oaky, toasted finish. There's a bit of a tangy character that's slightly offputting. Not sure if it's barrel-derived, but that wouldn't surprise me. Still retains a bit of alcohol warmth."

"Overall, not much difference from Double Dead Guy here. Maybe I should try them side-by-side but eh well. Still tasty!"

"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer. Reminds me of Innis and Gunn in the old days, before demand forced them to change how they aged their beers. However, I&G never featured taste collages like these. Excellent balance on almost every level and just an all-around fantastic beer. Recommended."

"I've had a few other Rogue brews and while I'm not an avid fan, they do make a few decent beers (Old Crustacean). ..but this one???OH man If I could get a refund, I would be all over that."

"O- for the style, its pretty flavorful. Was a bit dissapointed in the lack if whiskey character, but overall nice and malty with an oak kick"
""
""
""
"O- This beer has some nice oak flavors but the sweetness really grows too sweet and the bitterness that tries to balance it is too harsh and abrasive. There is balance but both of the dominate flavors are too over the top to really enjoy."

"O-a decent barrel-aged ale, flavors work pretty well together"
""
"Lovely beer. And worth the money for one who wants to try something once. Having it with some nice Bleu d'Avergne which works wonders."

"I drank the first half of the bottle just under room temperature while the second half chilled in the freezer. The first half was wonderful. The whiskey notes were prominent but not overwhelming. I can't really put my finger on the taste, but there is a mellow sweetness that follows the initial whiskey flavor. The second half tasted like a slightly hoppy Blue Moon. I regretted letting it chill! Really interesting aroma. Misleadingly herbal. Overall good beer. I prefer it to regular dead guy."

"O: A rich and complex ale I enjoyed quite a bit despite having no particular fondness for whiskey. The whiskey barrel aging adds a good level of wood and whiskey to the aroma and flavor, and probably contributes to the fine mouthfeel. Improved with warming."

"Rogue John John Dead Guy Ale ---4/5."

"O- very interesting take on a hells Bock. Dead Guy is a phenomenal ale.... this really highlights it on a slight Bourbon barrel feel... they really did well with timing on the aging of this beer on the wood. If anything longer this would of been a mess"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer! Poured at a good temperature wilth a decent size, light tan, foamy, frothy head that soon settled and some lace. Color is a clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is the best part here and is malt, whiskey, hop and aromatic. Flavor doesn't have mujch of the whiskey, but lots of malt and some hop comes through. It's also fairly dry with carbonic tang balanced nicely with the bitter and the slight sweet to take the edge off. Body is also excellent and is soft, but not overly and great carbonation. Finish is like flavor, good burps, a little boozy, the whiskey flavor finally comes through, and a bit on the long side."
""
"O - Decent barrel aged ale that I would really like to try on draft."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Unfortunately there are no dates on this, but this bottle isn't more than 6 months out from being sold. Mild in the nose and taste, and the barrels are boring at best. I guess they decided to just put an unimpressive beer into unimpressive barrels. The feel sucks as well. This is a boring beer I'd hope they'd forget about making again. I've had better from Rogue. Thanks again for the beers dad. Always appreciate you thinking of me while you're lapping up the sun."
""
"O- This whiskey/barrel flavor is very subtle. I really like the beer because dead guy is one of my go to beers and will still get this beer on occasionally in the future, but would have liked a little more of the barrel flavor."
""
""
"This is an already decent beer that has been barrel aged to add some subtle complexity. Not at all overpowering in the whiskey department. Very nice."
"This was OK but overall, the base Dead Guy just doesn’t seem burly enough to hold up to the strength of the barrel at times, with a lot of oak, vanilla and burnt character really starting to emerge as this warmed up. This wasn’t bad to me or anything but just seemed like it needed a little more balance between the base and barrel."

"Pours a hazy orange color with a thin lie of bubbles on top. Sweet honey and caramel malt aroma with a touch of alcohol and fruity esters. Sweet caramel malt and fruity esters mix with a vanilla and oak flavor. There is a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish to balance it out. Medium body and the feel is peppery from the carbonation with a lingering bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall they had the barrel thing down but used too low of an ABV beer that wasn't even too complex to begin with. Now if they aged double mocha porter like this is would be world class. Worth picking up for 5 bucks I guess."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aromas of whisky notes are quite dominant with some light caramel malt notes also noticeable. Taste is a good mix between the caramelized sugars from the malt backbone with some nice whisky notes that are not too boozy. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing earth shattering here but very nice nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you want a beer that is going to slam you with whiskey, this is not your beer. The oak and whiskey are light and subtle, but present enough that you certainly notice them. Very solid beer and barrel-aging job here by Rogue"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer that has grains of barrel aging and pulls it off. Outrageously overpriced so this is a one and done."
""
""
""

"On tap. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on may´12. Bright orange color. Off-white, creamy, lasting crown. Floral hop, moderate caramel malt & yeasty with apple touch. Maltiness dominates flavors, eventhough they are well rounded by low bitterness. Ripe fruit -apricot & peach- hints. Whiskey malt notes in the middle, slightly wood-cask too, give a very kind warm touch to such an smooth mouthfeel. Medium body, soft carbonation. Subtle astringency. Don´t like Helles Bock style?. Try, this. Refreshing & flavorful."
""
"After just having a deadguy ale, this is an interesting counterpoint. It is clearly a similar beer, but is also smoother, more rounded, dynamic, and interesting. The appearance has the same amber hue and white head. The smell, though, has a rounded complexity...wood, sweetness, brandy-like vinous scents, and some smokey notes. The taste is also smoother, and more blended. Sweet, but very drinkable. Full in body. Great."
""
""
"O- Would be great to try this side by side with a regular Dead Guy, but we love it just fine on its own. Another great Rogue offering."
""
"O- Having tried Dead Guy and Double Dead Guy, I can now say this is my favorite member of the death's family tree. I haven't tried many barrel aged beers but I can confidently say it works wonders on this classic brew. Get some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting, somewhat complex beer, but very approachable. A nice spin on an already solid beer."
"O: $8 for a bottle, which I was happy to buy and share. I suggest you do the same as drinking a whole bottle might be too much. The whiskey isn't there enough, and the base beer isn't strong enough to carry it through."
""
""
"O: a very good brew, very well rounded and gives a very nice whisky and barrel profile... A mucho quaffable whisky barrel brew."
""
""
"How disappointing! And I hate giving this beer such poor ratings. However I would love to try this one again, as I think I simply just got a bad bottle."
""
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to red color with a small white to no head. In the aroma, a nice abrasive hop and a caramel like malt. In the taste, an abrasive pine hop and backed up with a caramel like malt underneath. A small hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small caramel and note of hops in the aftertaste. No nose really, eh! whatev's!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is great beer, and the whiskey-barrel aging has given the normally hoppy Dead Guy ale a nice earthy, oak texture. It does somewhat detract from the hop profile, however, and in my opinion the brew becomes a little to overpowering in the whiskey area as it sits on the tongue and melds into the aftertaste. I also wanted for a stronger sugar base, feeling that the malty notes could have been stronger to better combat the whiskey flavors and give the beer more punch. Still, this is a good bottle, and worth trying."
""
""
"Review from 6/2011 notes. Two year old refrigerated bottle, poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy medium orange amber. One finger white dissipating head leaving a ring, little lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, vanilla, light whiskey. Starts with caramel and transitions into whiskey, wood and vanilla. Whiskey, vanilla, coconut finish. Hint of hops. This is a two year old refrigerated bottle. I think the hops have faded, the the balance is still well balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
"O. A decent beer, but ultimately a letdown. Not worth the price of admission and not as good as Dead Guy, I don't think and especially not Double Dead Guy (overpriced though it is). The worst part: where's the whisky barrel taste?! That's part of what sold me on this to begin with."
""
"Overall – This was an interesting beer. It had a rather odd flavor profile in my opinion, kind of random, but nothing was really all that off. Although I don’t think I would drink this beer on frequent occasion, it is worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: If a beer is to be flawed, then it would do well to do so in flamboyant and memorable fashion. This beer is able to pull that off at least, defying categorization and being simultaneously hard to really like but impossible to walk away from. A very unique beer experience."
"A strange beer, it really makes me think that rogue's whiskey must be strange as well."
"Overall, an unusual take on a maibock. Flavorful and interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was a very enjoyable beer. Lots of different flavors, I'm usually not a fan of barrel aged ales because the alcohol is usually more potent, but it was hid very well in this beer. However I do wish there was more of a crisp feeling from the carbonation, it's the only thing in this beer that seemed rather plain."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, golden orange pour with a slight white head. The aroma is fruity, alcohol. The taste is very similar to the smell, nothing really stands out. Body is medium, good carbonation, slight alcohol. Nothing really stands out, like the idea of aging a maibock in barrels, didn't work. Not sure if it needed more or less time in the barrel."
""
""
""
"M: Creamy, a lot more than I thought it'd be. Also, a little hot from the booze."
"O: The whiskey barrel aging makes the aroma and flavors slightly more interesting compared to other beers in the style."
"O: Better than I expected and not as much alcohol warming as some beers that have been stored in spirits barrels. You can easily detect the taste from the whiskey barrels. This beer would warm you nicely if you were drinking it on a cool spring day."
""
"O: I got it on draft for $3 and was not impressed. I'm a big fan of barrel aged beers, but this one didn't gain many interesting characteristics from the barrels it was stored in. Don't go out of your way for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"I bought this brew for a day off and something new. Pours as almost a summer beer, gold with a hint of copper pour. When you popped the top the smell was immediately noticeable. The gin barrel aging is great, you get all the flavor of gin without the necessary lime and tonic mess (sorry im a beer guy) a great beer, I just wish i didn't have to pay $5.99 for 22 oz of the stuff. Still, I would recommend to a G&T lover that occasionally drinks beer. It might turn them to the lighter side of drinking"
""
""
""
""
""
"Opinion: I don't know. This beer misses the mark for me on a number of levels. I think that it starts out by calling the Dead Guy a Maibock as it is a really hopped up version of that beer, if you can even call it one. That said, now you mix this with some bold barrel flavors that don't really seem intended to be there, so the whole thing falls apart. If barrel aged beers are your thing, which I really enjoy them myself, this may be a good one to try so that you can get another review. Otherwise, I doubt that aging this beer will bring it together, so I would steer clear if I were you."
""
""
"O - I was very disappointed with this beer this is what you get when barrel aging doesn't work the barrel added nothing to this instead it hurt it don't bother with this if you see it save your money and buy something good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - the hops come across a little tangental to the rest of the beer. Maybe a fruitier variety or just less of them would have made a more concise flavor profile, but I like the beer apart from that."
""
""
"O: This is an extremely nice barrel-aged ale that does not lose the character of the regular Dead Guy Ale. As I am a huge fan of the regular version of this beer, I cannot help but view this as a richer, more complex version of it. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very unique beer, nothing like I've ever had. I guess I am still drinking it and enjoying it so I'll call good, even though at first it seems real unexpected, wish there was a bigger malt backbone on this but there ya have it."
""

"This is a strong beer and must be quaffed with respect! I enjoyed it."

"This twist of dead guy ale, aged in dead guy whiskey barrels is an amazing beer. Pours a dark amber with a tiny white head. Smells of light vanilla. The classic dead guy ale taste has completely changed. It's there but with a smoother, oaky, sweet vanilla whiskey flavor ending with a slight bitterness comparable to the original ale. I'm a big fan of the classic dead guy ale but I'd choose this over that any day. I love the complexity."
"Pours a cloudy orangish-amber color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is somewhat tart, with some sweet whiskey. Hints of vanilla and almond. Caramel. Taste is surprisingly tart...wasn't expecting this, but REALLY like it. Tart oak flavors blended with whiskey and vanilla. More oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied, tart, and crisp. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I'm pretty positive this beer isn't meant to be tart or sour... so it's probably infected. However, I absolutely LOVE it! Awesome tasting beer."

"Pours a hazy pumpkin orange with a decent head. Aroma has a lot of vanilla notes with some caramel chew and oak smell. Initial taste is uber tangy and tart. Body has a lot of vanilla flavoring but doesn't last too long. Finish is typical Dead Guy Ale but has a tartness that lasts awhile. Overall, I really liked this Ale and thumbs up to the Rogue Guys for always pushing the envelope."
"D- dead guy was one of my gateway beers that brought me from the world of BMC over to this planet, along with sam adams and shiner bock. i'm happy to have this one with such pronounced whiskey barrel character and i believe (as i'm sure john and john do) that dead was the perfect guy for the job. this is a good one to swirl and sniff before a sip because the aroma is that nice. taste is a little too sweet but i can live with that. nothing about this beer really fits the maibock category for me but i'm not judging it on style guidelines, just on the beer itself."
"O: Very good. I'd have again; recommended."
"O: I love the concept and I like the beer. Recommended, drinkable, interesting, and compelling. Would have again."
"This is a slightly above average brew, The beer poured out as a light orange color with a thin white head on top. The smell of this beer wasn't too bad. There was a noticable amount of barrel aromas in there along with the malts and some faint hops in the distance. The taste was really good on the first sip, there was a good amount of barrel aged flavors but as I drank more it seems to fade away. The beer starts to taste like a normal Dead Guy ale to me by mid glass. The mouthfeel of the beer was again a little on the thin side which bugs the hell out of me... Overall I've had much better barrel aged beers in the passed. I wouldn't buy this one again."
"O: On the whole, this is a solid, enjoyable beer. An interesting take on the style."
"D - drinkable but not blown away. I'd much rather enjoy a regular dead guy for half the price."
"The beer pours a deep dark golden orange, with an aggrasive pour it forms a finger head that fades quickly and eventually dissapears. The smell is alcohol, whiskey, yeast, hops, oak. A lot of smell follows in the taste with whiskey, caramel, hops, grass, and a slight tast that reminds me a little of coca cola in the back. Mouthful is a syrup slick that lingers around with pretty low carbonation. Its a good beer that I think hit what they intended to do and would gladly drink it again."
"Pours a hazed light copper, little to no head and minimal lace. Aroma is interesting, alittle malt sweetness, hint of whiskey. The flavor follows suit with a firm maltyness, a touch of Rogue Pacman yeast which imparts a light tartness. Then the rest is oaky tannins, good whiskey flavor, wood, soft vanilla. The mouthfeel is mild, medium to light bodied and carbonation low. Overall, I like how this relatively simple brew picked up alot of barrel notes. Pretty nice."
"O: Definitly drink this one again and will search out another this one was about a year and a half aged and was rather good !"
"PP (Price Point) -- This is actually going to be one of the toughest PP Ratings I have ever had to argue with myself over. The Price Point on this is $8.99 for a 22oz bomber.75-80% of myself agrees that this is indeed fair, but the other remaining portion of my brain says that this SHOULD have been kicked up an additional 2% of ABV, its roughly a 6.5% and should be closer to 8%, preferably 9% for that price. overall a nice beer!"
"However, I still enjoyed this beer as it's refreshing change from the usual IPAs I drink. I can see myself drinking this again when I come back to Oregon visiting my family."
"O: My gut says that this bottle may have been sitting for too long because i'm pretty disappointed with the experience, too much Diacetyl, whether from the brewery or from further maturation. It is, however, a beautiful beer to look at."
"Overall this is a great slightly woody, amber, fall-weather beer that I could drink all day/night, and in large qualtities. I must have had 3 or 4 20 oz drafts while shooting pool. Worth seeking out of you like the original Dead Guy and want to try something new. Much better on draft than from a fresh bottle as I have sampled both."
"O: This beer constantly leaves me wishing for just a bit more. It's not a bad beer, but it could have a little more panache."
"O- Lost the Dead Guy taste, but it is a great drinking beer."
"Taste: exceptional. At first you get the flavor of a dead guy. The back finish is unbelievable. Smoke, wood, whiskey. Everything it promises. I was not expecting much from this beer. I have had other ""john john"" Rogue beers, and this is by far the best. This will join the shelf in my garage with the other top 20's. I will gladly pay the meager 6.50 asked for this beer again and again."
"A truly complex beer. Not much of an improvement over the original, but definitely good. The whiskey aging is noticeable and good. The price makes it worth a try, especially for a limited release."
"Definitely better than regular dead guy. Nothing stellar, but rather enjoyable."
"D-overall this was a nice maibock. Nothing to outstanding but flavorfull and refreshing. Wouldn't pay 5.75 again for it but would pay 3 or soo."
"O- a good brew and I reccommend it."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange. Helluva head on this one. An inch and a half of off white fluffiness that stays around pretty much the whole way through the beer. Nose smells of oranges, maybe a tad apple, and just slight whiskey notes. Kind of disappointed in the taste, although it is good, I wish it had more whiskey in the flavors. Oranges, malt, just a slight bit of whiskey. Whiskey gets more prevalent as I drink more. Nice full mouth feel. I did like this beer, but I thought a bit more whiskey on the pallet would've made this a fantastic beer."
"An incredibly slick and very buttery, oaky brew. Did I enjoy it? Not especially. Was it memorable? Oh, hell yes. This is a beer that will stick in my mind for a very long time, and that's something to appreciate."
"Overall, this is a very worthy brew. It beats the hell outta John John Hazel Nut. If you like Dead Guy (as I do) then you'll really appreciate this beer. It is unique and still great - two of my favorite qualities."
"Final thought - if you haven't had this, you need to try it"
"I don't remember trying the base beer for this one so I can't make the comparison. Not cheap at 11$ a bottle but I'm not mad I tried it but I doubt I'll be buying more for casual drinking"
"Not a big fan of the Dead Guy Whiskey (waaaay too sweet for a Whiskey), still fond of the original Dead Guy, I can't honestly say that the barrel-aging, no matter how akin it was when connecting the dots, actually enhanced the final product over a regular bottle of Dead Guy. I've said it before, an interesting and fundamentally obvious experiment for Rogue to do with their own products, but I'd rather spend less money and enjoy the original version far more if given the option."
"O- I enjoyed it but again it's fairly one-note. It's a well designed beer but just one note. This is the second of the John-John series and both have been underwhelming in that regard. I really enjoy this one better than the Rum aged one I had but I don't know if it's worth the cost for enjoyment."
"Aroma didn’t offer up anything new that I could trace. There are some great flavors in there but you have to work past the overall biting feel and flavor and you get only a hint of it in the finish. Good, but I’m not totally convinced it’s worth it."
"O - the barrel aging is a subtle compliment to the brew, very balanced and flavourful, a nice twist on an already solid brew"
"O - Overall, I was very impressed with this offering and it is by far the best of the John John series to date. The oaked whiskey flavours are complementary to the earthy hops and burnt sugar notes of the traditional Dead Guy Ale. Although a tad pricey @ $10/bomber, I would venture out to grab another bottle on occasion."
"O - i have never given the majority of a beer to the drain at a bar, i kept trying and i just gave up after about 6 of the 16 oz. couldn't do it. take this for what you will but i will never forget this brew...in the beers defense this was the first time ive experienced John John Dead Guy Ale so i can say i'll give it another shot, but not anytime soon. maybe this should be called ""The John aka the Shitter"""
"Interesting beer. It's good but not great."
"Drinkability is OK. Not a bad beer but the whiskey barrel novelty wears off quickly."
"This beer pours an orange amber color with a finger of white head that leaves only a little lacing and hardly any retention. The aroma is strong with caramel notes and the taste follows along... With the usual Rogue signature sour notes. The mouthfeel is smooth with a slightly overcarbonated aftertaste. Overall worth a try."
"If there's such a thing as a barrel-aged summer ale, this could be it. John John Dead Guy Ale is refreshing, low in alcohol, and tasty."
"An enjoyable whiskey influenced beer - the subtleties of the base bock overridden by the barrel. That's not to say that this is over the top, just that it's nicely augmented by the extra flavours."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, continuing Dead Guy Ale or Lager argument aside it's a good representation of style, although this is a case in my opinion where barrel aging does not really improve a good beer, this is version is still worth drinking for a long time."
"Overall it's ok. I think I would rather have regular dead guy. Worth a try though"
"mouth - still much bourbon..hops...woodiness...makes me wanna try their bourbon spirits!....some vanilla...this is a HANDSOME beer!....i never was a fan of dead guy but..this offering...wow!...an easy drinker...40 ibu...danger!"
"Overall, very complex and delicious!"
"Unique and enjoyable although not necessarily something I'll buy very often. Like the vanilla and malty tones."
"D: I split the bottle and was glad I did at the end of my glass."
"Pours thin with an orange - caramel color. Very thin light head. Liight and somewhat citrusy nose - similar to just the standard Dead Guy. Taste is malt which is quickly dominated by bourbon. Very strong, but not unpleasant bourbon flavor. It is a little overwhelming however. Surprisingly clean finish."
"All and all, a very nice helles and an interesting barrel aged beer. Glad I got to give it a try."
"Medium bodied with a very prominent whiskey barrel flavor that overpowers most of the other characteristics and lingers into a slightly hot, dry finish. Lots of whiskey flavor without being overly hot with hints of toasted, earthy oak, vanilla and toasted coconut. The base beer is overpowered but underneath there are still hints of pale malt, caramel, toffee and biscuit. It's still pretty good, and at the relatively low ABV, pretty easy to drink but it could stand to be more balanced and have a little less one-dimensional whiskey barrel flavor."
"D- 4 Overall I find this beer quite drinkable. It has something about it that keeps me lifting my glass. The flavor was more balanced than I anticipated from the smell. It is on the sweet side for me, but in a good way. I could enjoy several of these in a sitting. It's definitely worth trying for those that enjoy the original Dead Guy; it's a nice twist."
"D- This was a bit of a let down. It really was not anything of an improvement on regular Dead Guy. That being said, if the price was lower, I would have no problem drinking this all night. It's an ok beer, but it just failed to impress."
"D: I was expecting a little more from this beer, but I still enjoyed it."
"- Much more drinkable than even the flagship dead guy.. like a slightly sweet cream soda of beers... rather flavorful, well thought out, and made."
"Started strong, but the middle kind of fell out. Disappointing. A cool beer conceptually, & it definitely wasn't unpleasant, but just really lacked something. Didn't hold up to the promise of the smell."
"an easy drinker and a growler to the head in one night shouldnt be a problem, but i expected a little more. not really worth the $17.99 growler fill. i havent had the original dead guy in quite awhile to compare, so i didnt really know what to expect."
"Certainly will pick up more from this brewery,"
"I found this beer quite drinkable, I believe due to its lightness. It has the flavors and nose without the palate destroying components. Quite drinkable and worth a shot if you can get your hands on it. I would be curious to see what it was like out of the tap."
"D - Ok, but not great. The taste and booze didn't keep me coming back."
"It doesn't matter what yeast was used. It's an American beer for god's sake; American yeast makes sense. No harm in that. While one may criticize the manner in which this beer does not fit the mold of a Maibock, I don't give that one thought. It fits the mold of a tasty beer."
"How can a maibock or hellesbock be fermented with the standard traditional pacman yeast? I know this is their standard yeast but you cant brew world class offerings from other styles that have nothing to do with an american yeast. For this reason, this beer is complete garbage and cant even be reviewed in the category its classified. It makes no sense. It lacks the complexity that any hellesbock should have by what is imparted throught he yeast and just ends up being a bland malty slightly sweet offering with back notes of straw. complete garbage for the style. a decent matly beer if you have no other choices. not recommended against the style and certainly not for the price. this is a problem for rogue with more than just this beer."
"Bought a bottle of this at Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a tulip, it poured golden-orange, with a high degree of carbonation, two fingers of off-white head, and great retention and lacing. The nose revealed citrus, honey, caramel, oak, cherry, and vanilla. The taste was a beautiful blend of the aforementioned flavors at first, then dissolving to a more pronounced malty cherry-vanilla flavor on the finish, with only a slight hint of the alcohol content. Dry warmth afterwards, which further reinforced the mental association with whiskey. With the great head retention, it felt creamy smooth, as less carbonation was evident in the feel than in the appearance. Medium thickness. Awesome sessioning beer, with the standout feature being the balance. I respectfully disagree with some of the earlier reviews that claim that the taste doesn't live up to the nose, or that whiskey dominates; I truly believe that this beer has an excellently blended flavor profile resulting from the barrel aging. If I may make the analogy, it tasted like a Nugget Nectar, which further morphed into cherry vanilla goodness...if that makes any sense to you. Oh, and by the way, in my humble opinion, of the three John John Ales that Rogue has released (and I have tried), I find this offering to be by far their most complex...and best."
"Reviewed on 4/3/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear ruby orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt, bready malt, honey, and floral hops. Flavor of whiskey plus the Dead guy malt. Wow, the whiskey does NOT go well with the malt base! What was Rogue thinking? This was pretty disgusting flavor-wise."
"M, D- Medium bodied, very drinkable, ideal CO2, imperceptible ABV."
"In the end, John John Dead Guy is probably my favorite in this series, barely edging out John John Spruce Gin. I'll still take Rogue's regular offerings every day of the week and twice on Sunday."
"I don't really enjoy whiskey, but I enjoy this beer. The whiskey isn't overwhelming; it's warming but never cloying. The mouthfeel is still pretty light. Overall, I enjoy it, although I miss Dead Guy's hop presence."
"Taste follows the nose, moderately malty upfront, a peek of fruitiness, and then a dollop of whiskey to close. Everything seems to flow together easily. Mouthfeel is small-bubbled and smooth, with excellent drinkability. Loving this one, and best carbonated barrel-aged brew I've seen in a long time."
"John John Ale is not Rogue's finest moment. It's alright, but seems a little too convoluted to work well. The nose is weak, the hop flavor seems too bold, and the body's too thin. All in all, it's merely okay. Rogue has released far better beers. Worth a try? Eh. Maybe. Stick to a single bottle if you're intrigued."
"ah, well, life goes on and beer is good."
"An interesting beer, perhaps a bit simplistic, but I am actually enjoying this more than I thought I would. The base beer is definitely thoroughly dominated by the barrel character, but I like that such a ""light"" beer is able to not let this get too out of control. You definitely will have to enjoy Whiskey-barrel aged beers to like this and I like that this is not hot and that the Whiskey character is so smooth."
"This bottle will be all I want and then some. Maybe make a 4 pack of this in 12 oz bottles? I mean if you like it 12 oz is more than enough. If you don't like it you won't even consider them. Oh wait...this is rogue. They're fine with their beers just sitting on shelves for months/years."
"Pours a robust amber with a sticky head. The aroma is slight and malty. The flavor is heavy and anise-like, with a deep, chicory malt and a spicy burn on the finish. The malt spice gives it a lovely bitterness. Delicious - although not strictly an Ocktoberfest, this is a lovely fall beer."
"D: This was an interesting barrel aged ale (non-stout), but not the most delicious. The scent and taste were enjoyable but not great, and the body was a bit thin. It was fairly easy to drink, with a clean finish and low ABV. But in the end, this was only worth trying once as a gimmick."
"O: Solid, good whiskey/beer balance, great spice/juniper character"
"Was quite pleasantly surprised to find this on a recent excursion to Lawrence. Pours a rather vibrant ruby red to rust ornage with a high level of carbonation and a large billowing head that's a full inch high. The nose is very fruity and floral; though there is some woody notes likely due to the barrel aging. The hops accentuate the floral notes, this beer makes my mouth water. Light mouthfeel from such a complex beer, I was expecting it to be somewhat syrupy but it's not nearly that heavy. Kind of disappointing, actually. The first thing you notice about the beer is the finish. Up front it has all the qualities of a nice pale ale. There's some fruity hop things going on giving way to malt sweetness. But the finish to this beer is almost mind blowing. There's this terrific flowered wood finish that reminds me of a creek in spring, or something similar. I don't really care for the minor alcohol notes, most likely from the aging process, but that's to be expected given this style of beer. As the beer opens up it gives you a lot more from the flavor profile. The hops are floral. I get lavendar, marigold, maybe even lillies. Quite lovely. These accent the sweet caramel malt, finally leading into that wonderful finish. It's a very circular flavor, if that makes sense. There's not a lot of breadiness or biscuit qualities to this beer, it's very light on the palate and quite delacte. This wasn't what I was expecting from this beer at all, but it's enjoyable and delicious, a perfect compliment to the end of another day in a neverending hot summer."
"Atmosphere is excellent. A deep, rich appearance lends its way to a beautiful creamy towering head which insulates your precious brew throughout the entire experience. The nose is just loaded. The only possible downside.... almost too many components. My olfactory senses went all haywire. Flavor is similar in output to the nose. Lots of stuff going on here, but nothing is going to overwhelm and offput you. Everything seems to marry together well. In the end, this is a great quaff."
"I found this to be quite enjoyable. An interesting blend, but it works."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a cloudy amber/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is nice and malty, it smells like oak, whiskey, vanilla, caramel and a bit of spice. It tastes like whiskey, oak, caramel malt, vanilla, and a bit of apple and spice. The whiskey/oak flavors aren't overpowering at all, I thought it would be somewhat stronger in the taste since the whiskey/oak aromas were stronger. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit oily and creamy, and also has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's certainly not hard to drink. Not a bad brew overall, I think it's worth trying."
"A nice enough beer, though I really don't think it's all that different from the regular dead guy ale."
"Creamy and smooth, medium body mouthfeel. High carbonation, and a very small booze burn. Not hoppy enough compared to dead guy or DDG....perhaps the whiskey barrel aging mellowed it out? A dominate yeast and malty mouth presence lingers...but keeps you wanting more hops. A little dissapointing, but a good drinker and not bad by any means."
"A refreshing brew, I'm glad I saved this one for summer. Pretty drinkable if you like a bitter beer."
"Prickly with carbonation and a bit powdery, as is typical with Rogue beers... A little warm in the finish and leaves the palate dry."
"Rogue Ales--Oregon Brewing Company--John John Ale--Dead Guy Ale Aged in Dead Guy Whiskey Barrels--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 40 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Maibock Ale--Whiskey. Rich lacy dense foamy off white head. Clear bright light amber orange color. Bottle Conditioned, but no sediment. Hazes at end. Mild vanilla hop whiskey aroma. Mellow sweet fruit ester oak hint mild caramel Maibock Ale body. Smooth mild whiskey balanced hop spice end. Easy whiskey barrel aged brew. Sampled 7/9/2010. 2 @ $9.99 Each."
"Notes: The oak whiskey barrel aging (I think that is what they did....) really works for this beer. I am very impressed with the taste of this beer that I was not sure that I would like. Recommended for sure!"
"I am a huge fan of Dead Guy, Double Dead Guy and St. Rogue Red, so I figure this must be good. Bought 3 bottles and took them out camping for a hot late May adventure. I am not much of a whiskey drinker but the combination is suburb, it actually improves the drinkability and and as the bottle warms up the transition of flavors is incredible. Next on my Radar is the John John Juniper ale."
"Not a bad beer, very easy drinking. This is my first Maibock, very interested in the other Maibock that Rouge puts out, it seems to get good reviews."
"22oz bomber into a Duvel tulip pours a somewhat hazy orange with a nice frothy off-white head that lasts and leaves nice rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of caramel malts and oaked vanilla. The taste is a very enjoyable blend of crisp caramel malts against a nice oak profile that leaves an intriguing whiskey-like finish, quite tasty. The beer is somewhat light with a decent carbonation. This is certainly a beer worth trying, especially since Dead Guy Ale was THE gateway beer to craft beer for me and remains one of my regular favorites."
" Very spunky stuff, unique all the way, from the hops to the yeast and aged malty flavor's."
"D - Interesting, the barrel aged character is much more prevalent in the flavor than it is in the aroma, though there is a definite uptick in complexity of the aroma, compared to regular Dead Guy, that would have to be due to the time spent in the barrel. The woody character in the flavor seems a little thin to me as compared to what I am used to from most barrel aged beers. This may be because the average barrel aged beer consists of a stronger base beer, or it may be due to the characteristics of the barrel. Either way, while this is an interesting experiment, it comes off a little flat and seems to need something more to make it really pop. In the end I don't know what to think about this one. On one hand it is lacking and weak, with flavors that need more force to back them up, but it is something more interesting and flavorful than the base beer, so I can't quite say that it was a waste of a barrel. I don't regret the opportunity to try this, but next time they might be better off using double dead guy when they have the itch to put something in a barrel."
"Was pretty excited to try this one; kind of a letdown. Pours a somewhat cloudy amber color with a bit of off-white head. Aromas of whiskey and sweet malt. Flavors of sweet malt, caramel, vanilla and some charred oak. Not nearly as impressive as I'd hoped. Leaves me somewhat less than excited to try the others in this series."
"Pours a hazy gold/amber hue with a cream white head. Decent amount of carbonations just from looking at all them bubbles rising to the top. Nice crisp malty aromas with some hints of vanilla added in there, probably from the barrel. Definitely tastes like Dead Guy for sure. Burnt malt yet very clean in execution. Again, notes of vanilla flavor that seem separate from other flavors. There are also some woody flavors that do better job blending with the original beer. All the different things going on leaves the buds guess each time, but not confusing them. Definitely could use a little more focus, or could it? Huge points for making a barrel aged beer out of something so 'non-imperial' as Dead Guy. Definitely something on the original end of the spectrum. Somehow the beer makes sense. The vanilla does compliment the wood and malt notes very well. If Dead Guy was a hamburger, putting this beer in a whiskey barrel is like adding cheese and bacon to the burger."
"Drinkability: very drinkable - not overly rich with fruit or flavor like some maibocks. very enjoyable."
"Interesting beer. Oak/bourbon was TOO apparent and the beer seemed very floral."
"M/D- Moutuhfeel is light and creamy. In terms of drinkability, dead guy just isn't the type of beer that needs to be whiskey aged. Dead Guy just doesn't hold up to the flavor. However, it is an interesting and enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is thick but gritty. Probably would have been smoother if I had left a half inch or so in the bottom of the bottle. Very drinkable."
"All in all this tastes very weird, & though not unpleasant, the barrel & bock doesn't work here. Nice effort, but not up to Rogue's usual snuff. But here's a tip-o-the-hate to further experimentation."
"I was at a Rogue tasting when I picked up this growler, and did so because it stood out the most among the 6 different Rogue brews I was able to sample. I am second-guessing that pick now -- this stuff is good, but not great. I have certainly had better barrel-aged brews. Still, I would have this again, and look forward to drinking and sharing this growler."
"D--this actually became much tougher to drink towards the end, too overpowering alchohol and whiskey flavor"
"extreme flavor. The mouthfeel is light and playful,almost refreshing. One of the better recent Rogue beers. Wasn't into them for a long time, but I think they're coming back!"
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with adequate zippy carbonation. Not one I would seek out again, but if you really like whiskey, this is your beer."
"F: Gets somewhat bitter on the finish. Not really much of a hop flavor but bitter. A touch of grassy hops though. Some sticky sweetness and more sweet malt lager flavors lingering. A little hay flavor and wheat."
"Overall, nothing like I expected, but still worth a try."
"D- I am a little dubious of the supposed alcohol content of this beer, but is is rather drinkable."
"Its an interesting one to try, but I can't see myself buying this one again."
"I nearly thought this was a letdown, for the first few sips, and had I written this review at the beginning of the bottle I probably would have given the taste a 4.5. Thing was, it seemed a little light to cost as much as it did. But I can't hold that against this, as it's not supposed to be a big beer. It's supposed to be balanced, smooth, drinkable, and wonderfully variegated, and it's all of those with spades."
"One of the better whisky barrel aged beers I've had. Well-balanced."
"Drinkability: This was odd, but interesting. I was happy to try it once, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
" It was light but had a good flavor. I am glad I tried it. I wouldn't kick it out of bed."
"Thanks richbrew! Poured from 22oz bomber into snifter on 3/29. Pours the color of honey just like the bottle says! 2 finger white head quickly dissapates. Smells of fruit, malt, little hops, and apple juice?! I get the same tastes with wood, sweet honey, and a slight alcohol finish. light to medium body and lightly carbed. Drinkability is so-so. A whole bomber is almost too much."
"I've loved plenty of John Maier's offerings but this one explodes with the malts and whiskey barrel aged effects. Appears a pale copper hue with a bright off white beige head, forms thick lacing scattered on the sides of my laced ridden imperial nonic pint glass. Aroma hits with the smoked vanilla and bourbon barrel aging going on that's what comes through in the beer not the underlying dead guy ale. It opens up the nares and eyes with alcohol vapors, what a beer indeed. More malt ridden alcohol, vanilla, bourbon aged light bodied presence with a hars oak after taste is left on the palate making this one nearly impossible to finish with a smile on your face. I'm one of the biggest fans of Rogue beer but keep your whiskey seperate from your bread winning Dead Guy, these two creations have no place joining as one. It's hot with alcohol on the palate, carbonation is soft and mellow the body is medium but soaked with alcohol. Drinkability overall is pretty freakin' poor, not a beer I would ideally indulge in if I knew that it was soaked in alchoolic oak barrels of whiskey."
"Pours a hazy orange color with an off white head. Smell is caramel malts, toffee, oak, and vanilla. Taste is caramel malts, toffee, vanilla, with some whiskey notes. Creamy medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Overall I really enjoyed this one."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, oaky, smooth, and hot of the booze via barrel aging."
"Hazy and pale. Reminds me of Victory St Boisterous in appearance. Musty and smoky aroma. Flavors are akin to a very mellow whiskey drink, maybe a ginger ale with Canadian whiskey but very watered down with ice. Tons of vanilla. A very well-crafted beer that I wouldn't change a bit."
"Overall The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. This is a descent beer. has a lot of characteristic of the dead guy but a little more woody. Not a bad beer, enjoyed drinking it."
"D: this could be a pour, its easy to drink just not much new in the taste department. not the best greatest but not the worst..."
"D: A disapoitment for sure, but it still is a an easy drinkin' beer and easy to enjoy. Perhaps I would have liked this more if I had less expectations and less experience with Rogue and barrel aged beers. But still, the concept screams out to be bold, but it holds back, settling for safe instead of great."
"Redneck Grade: Slap your momma, your sister, and your wife!"
"Not as far away from regular dead guy as I was expecting, decent but not exceptional."
"Drinkability - This is an amazing harmony of a spirit and beer, would definitely get this one again. 4.0/5.0"
"I'm not a huge Rogue fan, but I really thought that this might be the one to win me over. No such luck. It's okay, but that's about as good as I can say about it. I'd reach for quite a few other beers before this one....barrel-aged or not."
"Pours a deep caramel color and look a bit on the thicker side. The aroma isn't much there, maybe the beer could of been a little bit warmer then when it was served? At the initial taste it has a bit of caramel taste to it, but much less then the standard Dead Guy Ale. The whiskey flavor is much less then you would hope for. This was an easy to drink beer, but nothing all that special... like I said, going after Curieux is a tough job. give this one a 3.5"
"Drinkability is good here despite the slight flatness."
"D - the flavors just didn't jive well together. While I like some whiskey and I like a good dead guy ale this combo just didn't work for me at all."
"D. This is an interesting beer. Many subtle flavor nuances that make this unique. Drinks very easy."
"Barrel aging is subtle and it works very well here. Just a bit edgier than the regular Dead Guy."
"This is an easy-to-drink bock with a greater level of hops on the tongue--the kind of bock I like best."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. The oakiness was very pronounced, and I enjoyed this. I do notice though that it overshadowed some of the subtler aspects of the beer, and I would have rated it higher if it had a bit more of a malt characteristic."
"Drinkability: Uncomfortably unbalanced. Honestly, it's a bit tough to finish off. An accompanying glass of water was immediately requested. If someone had asked me what I thought would be the top ten best candidates for barrel-aging of any kind from the Rogue stable, DGA would have been absent from the list."
"Very interesting beer. The appearance is amber with a good head. The smell is a strong whiskey tinged scent. The taste is good. It doesn't remind me of a maibock, more of a strong amber ale, and the whiskey really comes through nicely. I'm not a storng amber ale advocate, but this balance of flavors is good. One of the best beers I've had by Rogue for a while. The afterttaste is not that great as it rounds out overwhelming maltness without much hop flavor, but it isn't bad. The beer is best while it's in your mouth. It is fairly drinkable although the unique flavor makes me not really want to drink too much of this in one sitting."
"I like it."
"Pours a nice clear bittersweet orange with a fairly thick orangy-beige head that does not hang around too long. Aroma is yeasty and woody, slightly malty with a hint of smoke. Flavor is rich, malty, woody and a little yeasty with hints of smoke and sweetness. Texture is silky smooth and fairly fizzy, leaving a pleasantly woody finish."
"drinkability: nice beer, great for a whiskey beer for me."
"Drinks fairly easy, not a traditional Maibock, but tasty enough, I like where Rogue took this, one the better ""barrel bocks"" I've had"
"I LOVE the concept behind this beer. Age Dead Guy Ale in Dead Guy Whiskey barrels which itself is made from Dead Guy Ale's malt bill. It is totally cute. Unfortunately the execution doesn't match the quality of the idea. Its still a good beer though; give it a try."
"1/2 finger white head tiny bubbles, pretty fast dissipation with minimal lacing. Orange amber clear body, very little visible carbonation. The nose is very boozy, really took on a new character after barrel aging, hops overwhelmed by the vanilla, oak elements. Taste is reflective of nose, oak, some vanilla, quite boozy, the hops are pushed aside. Medium mouthfeel, smooth, a bit sticky. Too boozy tasting to be drinkable, needs some cellaring to calm down the hot alcohol character, I'm going to sit on the bottled version for a while. Interesting, but too bourbony for me."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer is opaque with an orange/copper color. There is one finger of off-white foam that is slow to settle. It leaves some lace behind. I can pick up some whiskey and oak in the nose. There is a little bit of sweet malt hidden behind the barrel aging aromas. I can taste orange citrus and sweet caramel malts up front. As I swallow, I pick up the whiskey, but without any burning feeling. The finish is almost a bit funky. It's interesting. This aging complements the already great Dead Guy. The beer has a heavy body. I can really feel the carbonation in each swallow. It also feels a bit creamy. A thin coat is left behind. My glass of this beer is pretty drinkable, but the brew isn't as suited for multiple rounds like the regular Dead Guy is. I can see the whiskey notes being off-putting to some drinkers."
"Very good."
"I'm not convinced this one is any better than the original as I don't know if the original beer is big enough to hold up to barrel aging."
"Overall, this was a neat experiment and an alright drinker. Nothing amazing though."
"Why age Dead Guy and not something better? Old Crusty, Imperial Stout, or even Double Dead Guy?"
"D: Very one-dimensional with nothing to offer except whiskey flavor. The Dead Guy just doesn't hold its own against the barrels."
"Sort of disappointing here... Won't be getting this one again.."
"Highly drinkable, and thinking back on this beer, I would definitely enjoy it if offered again. Not terribly exciting for a -bal aged beer overall, but really great for a heller bock."
"22oz. brown bottle served in a Duvel Tulip. Poured a hazy, reddish gold with two fingers of off white head. Toffee in the aroma. Mild noble hop aroma. Oak really starts to come out in the nose as it warms. Medium bodied. Nice oak character with plenty of vanilla. Also a lot of butterscotch/toffee. Mild hop bitterness. Lots of whiskey character if you like that sort of thing (and I do). I really enjoyed this beer."
"drinkability: fine"
"Poured a deep orange color with excellent carbonation and billowing dirty white head. Nose is pretty faint on this one. Some whiskey but man it was not there for me. taste is very good. Dead Guy with vanilla, oak, bourbo, caramel, toffee and butterscoych. Mouthfeel is sweet, syrup, a little booze with a big sticky vanilla, oak presence on the back end with some hop bite and nice booze tingle. I like this beer!"
"T - The barrel aging gives vanilla and coconut accents to this toasty malt flavored ale. The finish crisp and bitter and lingers."
"This was a bit of a moderately heavy sipper for me. If your into the oak aged thang then this is a must try."
"Had the John John Ale without really having tried the normal Dead Guy Ale, also my first Mailbock I believe. It pours a great caramel color, with nice head that laces the glass. There's a hint of caramel/bourbon in the smell. Hint of the hops in the smell as well. Taste is a little sweet, but like a stronger alcohol at the same time. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, but tolerable. A must for BA's."
"My first barrel-aged maibock, so nothing to compare it to, but I found the overall quality to be solid - just not sure it's worth more than $8 a bottle."
"D - I like the idea but the whiskey/barrel combo is slightly over powering."
"Nice copper pour with some sediment, beige foamy head that settles, but is brought back with a bit of a swirl. Nose is malty sweetness, carmel, not much alcohol - faint whiskey notes. Taste is sweeter than I remember Dead Guy tasting, with a bitter finish - a nice addition which keeps it from being cloying. Faint edges of whiskey and vanilla. I am glad to see that the whiskey presence in this is so subtle. I have had some bourbon barrel aged beers that come off like boiler makers. Smooth body, light carbonation, easy sipper. Alcohol in not noticeable. Nice drinkability. If I had another, I would have killed it too."
"This was very good overall. I really liked this beer and would love to get my hands on another bottle. If you like Dead Guy, this is definitely worth a try."
"This one is pretty much as advertised. It tastes like a Dead Guy ale with a good whiskey presence. Not my favorite beer from Rogue, but another solid offering."
"A: Solid inch and a half of head from a hard pour, foam is quite craggy and drops to show spots along the inside of the glass, color is a dark gold to copper - 4.00, S: The nose is tough to decipher with the exception of the whiskey that is quite evident and really conceals a lot else that might be going on, I do pick up a sweet bready aroma and possibly some slight earthiness - 4.00, T: The whisky certainly makes a showing on the palate, a smooth butterscotch pudding sweetness pervades, some vanilla and oak, there's also a significant hop bite which comes through with a touch of spice and some definite earthiness - 4.25, M: Quite smooth and creamy - 4.25, D: All around a very pleasing beer, I was quite surprised how well a Maibock came out of a whisky barrel, I would drink this again - 4.50"
"D - smooth and easy drinkin'"
"4/3.5/3.5/4/3"
"I am happy to see this experiment with the Rogue-on-Rogue barrel aging. While this beer finishes on the sweeter, stickier side I stand my their efforts."
"D: This is a delightful effort from Rogue. I'm not the biggest Rogue fanboy so I'm glad to try a brew this good from them. A little expensive, but it's nice to try something different."
"D - I don't think I could drink a whole lot of this but I wasn't of the regular Dead guy Ale."
"Very slight haze to this orange to pale amber beer. Not much head, even with vigorous pour. Nose has some peach skin fruity aromas. On the palate there's the immediately noticeable high abv, honey-malty flavors, some cough drop flavors, and then finishes with more malty sweet and alcohol warmth."
"Really like this twist on Rogue Dead Guy, a bit expensive for a 22oz beer, but all things considered a good and worthwhile beer to seek and experience."
"Interesting take, not a great beer. Fun enough, but one is, also, enough."
"Curiously, the flavor is no different. The beer had really taken on the essence of the whiskey, with a soft, woodsy, peaty flavor like a Scotch rather than a bourbon sweetness. The whiskey is certainly not overpowering, though, with the flavors being quite soft, and I wouldn't call this one boozy. There is a bit of lingering earthy hop bitterness, and the mouthfeel is more like the beer I expected, with a resinous, almost buttery texture that is substantial but not too heavy. Overall, this beer is not a remarkable experiment, but it is interesting, surprising, and pleasant, and I would drink it again."
"D: This is very easy to drink but my impression is a bit on the meh side. Its ok and with ok you get an easy drinking beer. Its nothing to big and its absolutely not complex or challenging. Its not going to be a problem to kill this bomber but its just a bit of a let down for me. It could be much more but this beer seems a bit rushed and it didn't seem to get very much attention (unless they were going after UBER subtlety). Its ok. thats the best I can say."
"D: Interesting beer and a lot lighter on the barrel character than I would have ever anticipated, which in a way is nice, sometimes it's nice to let the beer do most of the talking and the barrel compliment everything else that is going on, but there is still a lot to be desired here."
"D: I liked this beer but it is missing something. I am not a big dead guy fan but this worked for me. It is rare for such a small beer to be barrel aged and I think more brewers should take a chance. For the price however I will grab something else."
"Pours a pretty dark gold with a medium sized persistent head. Smell is mild toasted malt with a noticeable whiskey note. Taste is balanced. Some caramel malt. Some herbal hops. Again a touch of whiskey and oak is present and goes with this beer nicely. Not overpowering or gimmicky at all. Smooth well rounded mouthfeel. Easily drinkable. Overall this is quite good."
"M & D - A nice light body but with nice depth in flavors. Drinkability is high with good flavor and nice ABV level."
"Pours a hazy reddish-orange and topped with a two-finger fluffy tan head that lingers a while before breaking up and leaving some thin stripes of lace behind. Not much in the nose; maybe some caramel malts and distant hops. Tastes sweet up front with a slight hop bite in the middle and a slightly oaky finish. Fairly smooth and medium bodied. Not as bold as I had hoped for, but not bad."
"Drinkability: this beer was flavorful and satisfying. More than one big bottle can be enjoyed in a session."
"CHEERS!!"
"D: Tasty and not a high ABV, but the amount of oak and smokey flavors get to be a chore after a while. Not something I'd want more than one of."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is a bit high. Drinkability is good. Very balanced beer and solid through out."
"Overall a very refreshing and drinkable ale"
"Drinkability: A good beer only if you like the oak taste. I think this one may be overly oaked and it looses some of the flavors that make the original so tasty. I would pick this one up if I needed an oak fix, but otherwise would pass."
"For a beer with such a nice balance of robust flavors, the John John Ale doesn't smell like much. The taste is bold, but in no way overbearing, with caramel, vanilla, and bourbon, which gives way to a hoppy finish with hints of dark fruit and honey, and a lingering whiskey and oak flavor. This is a delicious beer."
"Smoothness and drinkability are exceptional, especially at 6.4% abv."
"This beer is very drinkable, offering a lot of flavor with a modest amount of alcohol. A good beer for night sessioning."
"The original dead guy is a classic, but I really just dont think this treatment worked as well as it could have, dont think I will buy a bottle of this one."
"D: Quite drinkable and enjoyable. Another quality brew from Rogue."
"Notes: Certainly worse than their Dead Guy Ale, which albeit not extraordinary is a pretty OK brew. Here it feels like they messed it up for the sake of it with the barrels, and the results are subpar. The design is not necessarily horrid but lingers on a label that a couple of guys on a brewing session would have taken and slapped on the bottle lazily. Good for them but something that I would not encourage using on a label... But this would be somewhat irrelevant if at least the brew inside were truly worthy. But put this brew together with this presentation and sure you got something else in your hands..."
"Worth a shot."
"Decent body and a nice, easy drinker."
"Candy sweetness on the palate, but not cloyingly so, as the crisp carbonation level and whiskey-aging add a zippy spice profile to the back of the tongue. Fruity notes of pineapple and mandarin orange throughout. Medium mouthfeel is peppery with carbonation and easy to drink. Whiskey warms the stomach halfway through the beer. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting too much given Rogue's recent track record, but this is a tasty, unique take on the barrel-aging phenomenon. Kudos to Rogue Nation!"
"Pours a cloudy honey brown color with a smallish tan head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is bready with an oaky/whiskey twang. Very subtle aromas nothing crazy. Taste is that of a whiskey spritzer, which is quite ok. Nice whiskey flavor but in good proportion to the style. It has a nice oak barrel sourness and whiskey flavor, followed by a general malt sweetness, with vanilla to boot. I can't say that I can pick up any specific malt flavor, the whiskey seems to neutralize that, but it does a good job balances the barrel flavors. The feel is on the light side with nice carbonation, drinks well, fairly crisp. For a whiskey barrel aged brew, this drinks incredibly awesome. The barrel flavors are perfect for the malt body, it drinks light, but as real nice flavors. Very tasty, give this sucka a try."
"D: Good, the hops seem a little out of place to me, but it is still tasty. For the price though I don't think this is something I will be grabbing again, it seems like there are comparable beers for less."
"drinkability is not good and i would never buy this again"
"In my pilsner glass, this was a really attractive beer. Copper-colored, thick white head resembling whipped cream, some lacing. Nice caramel malt aroma, a bit of whiskey. Caramel taste, some whiskey, and late hoppiness. A good maibock. I hope Rogue does some more barrel aging."
"D- I found this to be surprisingly drinkable. A lot of the whiskey barrel aged beers seem to have a stronger flavor than this one, but I think it works here. I'll pick up another if I get the opportunity."
"More please. Great flavor, great value. Very drinkable."
"Worth a try I guess but don't buy too many of these. I'm really interested in trying the Rum Barrel Brown Ale now...hopefully it's a bit better."
"I am not a fan of Dead Guy but I enjoyed this a lot. It's worth your time."
"taste is creamy, malt, butterscotch, a tad sweet, caramel, and hops found in the back, ends smooth, and a little dry."
"D - highly drinkable. So tasty."
"Rather light body with a very dry finish. This is in interesting barrel aged beer. Like a good whiskey without any of the alcohol heat. Definitely a beer for whiskey lovers, I enjoyed the smoky and oak qualities of it."
"A ale or maibock?Who knows,but I have always kinda liked the Dead Guy,oak aging it left me skeptical but I liked it.Poured into a .5 liter stein a hazed burnt orange with a craterous one finger head atop.Toasty caramel aromas with some of that vanilla tinged oak,a slight leafy hop presence shows thru as well.Flavors are toasty and warming,I picked up a hint of melon and leafy hop as well.I like the toasty warming finish,solid and not overdone."
"Hazy amber orange, minimal head. Aroma is slightly boozy, mandarin-like, tea, citric hops and overtones of whiskey. Hoppy in a passive aggressive sort of way. Oranges and tea come through in the flavor, on a medium toasted malt body. Whiskey is subtle but evident in the toasted oak undertones. Upfront sweetness fades to a semi dry finish with lingering oily hops, toasty caramel and oak. This beer comes to life as it warms. Balanced and subtle, with some really nice flavors to be found if you look hard enough."
"D- An interesting brew to say the least...Drinkable, yes...Yet not my favorite by any means...If you're a fan of 'Dead Guy' you may or may not like this beer...It's sort of hit or miss in my opinion, worth a try, but probably not a revisit..."
"Poured into a New Belgium goblet orange/amber color with a two finger white head. Minimal lacing. The nose is very strong of vanilla and whiskey. Can't really scent anything from the Helles Bock. The taste is very interesting. The regular dead guy is there, but there are strong whiskey flavor up front that mellows out to a very strong vanilla note. There is also an odd flavor, it's almost like an artificial peach flavor. The mouthfeel is rather light, no alcohol burn from the bock or from the whiskey flavor."
"Good malty aroma and flavor. Great dark color and a lot of character for a beer this low in alcohol."
"D: not very high for me as this beer is very woody for my palate."
"This could be more epic had they aged double dead instead to bring more body and depth, along with aging potential."
"D: A dangerous sipper indeed. I honestly felt like I was sipping a whiskey high ball. The wood-aged character and flavor is so pronounced and makes this 6.4% ABV bock one smooth criminal. I could easily have had a few - before during and after dinner. Nice work, Rogue."
"The vanilla and bourbon make the beer seem boozier than it is. The beer is medium bodied and crisp, which is definitely different from most barrel-aged bourbon tasting beers I have tried. This is an interesting beer that I am glad I tried, but not one of my favorites."
"If anything, this is just a little too easy to drink. Very, very nice indeed."
"Drinks so easily and so well. I will have no problem putting 22 oz. of this down. An all around well crafted beer that is so unique for this style. I will have to pick up some more of this one."
"Given its lovely whiskey taste, decent hop profile and lightness, I'd be drinking this often."
"Pretty good drinkability. Not overly exciting, but fun to try. I could have enjoyed a stronger oak, or a stronger likeness to Dead Guy... instead it is kind of halfway in between the two with nether a clear leader/focus or a congruent balance."
"Pours a clear orangy light-brown color with minimal head. Smell is of carmel with a touch of toasted grain and vanilla - faint hints of whiskey, coconut, tropical fruit. Taste is a delicious, mild, yet well blended concoction of toasted grains, sweet carmel, vanilla, oak, whiskey, tropical fruit and coconut. Great smooth body, light carbonation, not sticky and no aftertaste. Very good beer... the coconut was a big suprise and the toned down whiskey heat is very welcomed after too many barrel aged beers going overboard."
"Pours a clear copper, medium aber color with good bubbling. The head dissipates pretty quick, but leaves some nice filmy foamy film on the top. The aroma is a toasty caramel malt snuff, but lets not forget the hint of vanilla and oak whiskey that gives you a little suffle of interest towards the end of each sniff. The taste starts with wet, toasted bread with a little unsalted butter on it. The middle has a more caramel and toasted grain flavor with just a splash of mellow whiskey. The finish is amost creamy in texture with some vanilla and even more mellow whiskey flavors. But added t that comes the very faintly roasted oak barrels that the whiskey was aged in. This is a nice alternative to the original Dead Guy ale. This is sessionable, but since it an oak aged, whiskey barrel maibock, it seems almost a little too specia for a session beer."
"D - Tastes good, alcohol is hidden. It's very drinkable...just not what I was expecting."
"Close to two finger head of off-white foam, densely whipped with a puddle of larger bubbles in the center, dissipates easily without much lacing left behind. Good degree of transparency to the copper to amber color, drops off to a pumpkin orange at the rims, very loosely dispersed bubbles within. The oak vanilla, butterscotch, honey notes extremely clear in the nose, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple fruit next, quick burst of pink grapefruit, however, nothing really ""edgy," some cocoa and solid cloves, the indistinct hoppiness gives it lift before vacating your nostrils. Medium-bodied, sort of a flat mouth feel, the carbonation seems half-hearted. Given the lack of zip, the vanilla, butterscotch, maple, caramel oak sinks in even deeper. Kinda nutty at times. Twigs, wood and bark more than grassiness, not that much citrus here, white grapefruit. At times comes close to a coffee rind bitterness. The apricot, cherry, peach, pear fruit not really enunciating loudly. Creamy texture makes it harder to discern individual flavors. If you like the first sip, you'll like them all. If not, it's a monochrome, homogeneous glass of beer."
"M - Medium/thin bodied, not a ton of carbonation. Meh."
"I loved this beer. Just enough sweetness to delight, with some bite. I would definitely buy again."
"Overall - Good beer - I thought that it was a very well thought out and the oak barrel taste was delicious and not overwhelmingly alocholy."
"d - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, but it was not what I was expecting at all. I didn't really feel as though the whiskey could be smelled and the taste had a hint of it at best. I also didn't think it taste quite like dead guy, but on the upside it had a very nice vanilla/malty taste that made it very smooth and easy to drink. It was very enjoyable just not what I was expecting. I would definitely be willing to try it again for less, but would not spend $9 for another bomber."
"Pours a golden orange color with a huge frothy white head that sticks around for a bit. Smells of sweet malt with a some bread, vanilla, and some toffee. I pick up some faint oak but its really hidden. Taste is sweet with honey, toffee and caramel up front. I get the whiskey, vanilla, and oak next. Then a stinging higher alcohol that's almost vodka like and hop bitterness in the finish. Thick sticky mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation, medium body. I tried to enjoy this one, but its not for me. I don't think the flavors meld very well and the alcohol burn kills it for me."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a medium body very smooth. I get the sensation of far more booze than the 6% of this beer should be giving me. Its almost a bit too much booze but only almost. The drinkability suffers a little due to the boozey nature this still isnt bad. Maybe the barrels would have been a better pairing with a bigger beer?"
"Good drinkability, average beer."
"I feel like this beer does everything good, but nothing well."
"Overall, this beer was simply odd. It didn't have a lot going on. I didn't pick up too much of the base beer in the flavor. I really don't expect a lot of this to sell at the price of near $9 a bomber. This beer just didn't taste anything like I expected."
"Over all I enjoyed it, though it smelled and tasted boozier than the 6.4% would indicate."
"D: Whiskey barrels smooth the brew out and enhances its subtleties."
"Drinkability: Pretty smooth and drinkable. A bit dissapointed, as I am with most Rogue brews. Was looking for something a little more adventurous I guess. A little too pricey for what it is."
"Medium body. A suggestion of alcohol. Pretty nice beer, although not a real whiskey presence."
"Not much whiskey notes but a toasty oak really shines and leaves a tannic finish.toffee and caramel with a slight nutty quality. A malt sweetness cleans things up nicely."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber/honey with a giant tan frothy head. The head is huge and lasts forever. The smell is pungent with bread yeast and roasted malt. Not bad but not too strong. The taste is full flavored with roasted malt,brown sugar,bread yeast,whiskey,and carmel. Not a bad taste,just a little different. the m/f is medium with the many flavors mixing well. This is a tasty beer that should be tried."
"Pours golden orange with a white head. The aroma is fruit with some whiskey and vanilla. The flavor is whiskey and oak with some vanilla and fruit. The oaked character of the beer really comes through in the flavor. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and carbonation."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but the whiskey was the main flavor in this one so you'd better like Dead Guy Whiskey. Overall a really cool idea and I liked how it came out."
"Honestly, before this beer I've never been impressed by Dead Guy Ale, or anything I've tried from Rogue. Dead Guy isn't a bad beer, it's just not a great beer. Apparently aging it in whiskey barrels makes it a great beer. The harsh whiskey note is exactly what it needs, given that my main complaint about Dead Guy is that it's too bland and sweet. The whiskey barrel aging gives character to the sweetness and boldness to the flavor (and aroma) as a whole."
"$10.99 for a bomber at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. No freshness info..pours medium brown, honey amber, puffy light tan head, retains about 3/4 inch of a head and slowly fades, leaves better then average, quality lace behind. The nose has components of sweet bready malt, light vanilla and faint wood/smoke. Tasty malted up ale, notes of rum, more vanilla, a light woodyness that delicatly interweaves itself through this beer, thoroughly enjoyable and nicely crafted. I'd buy it again."
"While I do enjoy the majority of Rogue's ales, I've never been a big fan of Dead Guy Ale. The aging in whiskey barrels, however, makes for a great improvement on this ale in my opinion."
"NOTE: This beer is classified here as a Maibock/Helles Bock... and I don't see how that classification works with Ale yeast..."
"First couple sips, I wasn't that crazy about this, but it's been a grower. There's something about that toasted coconut taste that keeps me coming back for more, not to mention the creamy smoothness that could keep me drinking this all night. I was kinda prepared to scream ""gimmick"" with this one, but I find that I can't. Good stuff, surprisingly good."
"Very drinkable and certainly not strong as I had thought. The bourbon is muted enough to make it accessible to people. Very well done. I'd buy it again."
"Had this on tap at Stub's. Pours a lovely amber orange color with a large white head that left some solid lacing on the goblet. Standard Dead Guy aroma of bready yeast, light hoppiness, but there's another woody/vanilla dimension that adds a nice touch. Flavor is dead on what I expected. Dead Guy with a touch of vanilla and wood but very light on the actual whiskey flavor. However, everything is well-integrated in this beer. I never thought this would be a great candidate for wood aging, but Rogue proved me wrong. I like Dead Guy Ale, and I thought this was a great version of it."
"Smooth and drinkable. A nice beer - I enjoyed this and may pick up another. Not one I see aging adding anything to, and I think it could have picked up a touch more wood, but a nice beer from Rogue - probably the best thing I've had from them in a few years."
"Would I buy more of it? - I plan on buying more tomorrow to share with some friends as it seems like this release is hard to come by."
"D- Much like the regular Dead Guy, this goes down really easy with a lot of flavor. If this came in decently priced sixers, I would buy this for a session. Not my favorite style, but nonetheless, awesome."
"I couldn't drink many of these. It's just too vanilla sweet. I'll stick with good ol' Dead Guy Ale."
"D: Its good for a sitting, but certainly not quaffable. I would probably get this one again on tap, but wouldn't seek out a sixer or bomber. Recommended for a one time tasting, but not a go-to beer by any means."
"D: Nice one-off from Rogue. I love beer and I love whiskey, so I'm glad I had a chance to try this. Looking forward to trying Rogue's other recent brewmaster/spirits master combos."
"It is a very enjoyable beer, and although I felt it was a bit heavy on the sweet side, as I was expecting a bit more of the whiskey to come through it was still very nicely balanced and very drinkable."
"I think a bit more time in the barells would have been nice, and maybe doing this with double dead guy. Just an idea, but that would have added quite a bit more time to production. Possibly a future venture?"
"D: For 6.4% this is slightly less drinkable than you would expect. The heavy malt body with the vanilla and booze make it just a bit less drinkable than regular dead guy, but still very nice. Enjoyed this beer, a little steep in price for what you get, but good."
