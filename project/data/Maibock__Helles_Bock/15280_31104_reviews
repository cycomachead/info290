"Overall, it is better than I anticipated, but not something I'd be likely to try again."
""
"Overall – A decent maibock. Nothing too exceptional, but a nice go to when looking for something malty and chewy."

"I popped the cap and before I could make the pour, I had a small cap of head sneaking its way up through the neck of the bottle! Being that it was that carbonated, I employed a more gentle pour than I might have otherwise. The dense two-finger cap of French Vanilla-colored head looked like the top of an ice cream float, perfect for the approach of summer. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose smelled strongly of Saaz hops, kind of skunky, catty, you get the idea. Mouthfeel was thick and viscous and the taste of the hops was a) off and b) much too heavy for the style. Finish retained a sharpness from the hops that rendered it fairly unpleasant in total. Another swing and a miss for this brewery."

"I am going to prefice that I am having this out in the shed with a pipe of Massanutten. So now down to business, I enjoyed the initial sensation of taste with the Black Keys killing it to Little Black Submarines. It was refreshing for a 7.5%. The nose was lacking for me, but the back door caused the score, with a bit of Floyd playing, I liked it's finish. Cheers."

"If only the beer could taste like the smell and late finish. It smelled sweet and balanced with a nice noble hop presence, but in all actuality, its just a jumbled mess."

"Really surprised to see the low ratings for this beer. Really a strong showing for an american maibock."

"To date, Atwater Maibock is my favorite Atwater brew – worth a try if you like the style."

"Dirty orange in color with yellowish hues on the edge of the glass. Very murky. Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a solid white cap. Toasted and biscuit malt flavors with light earthy hop and buttery notes. Medium bodied, a creamy feel through the middle with rich carbonation and a clean finish. Toasted and biscuit malt flavors up front. Bitter flavors build through the middle to the end, but the hop flavor lacks character. Finishes clean and semi-dry with a lingering dull bitterness."
"Picked up a six pack on sale for $6.99. Poured into a Brit style pint glass. Bottled in March 2012. Bright yellow orange color. Good lacing on the glass. Clear body with good carbonation. Smell had a hint of grapefruit and musty hay. Taste was good, as I liked the really malty flavor. Mouthfeel was a bit on the sticky side, though. I found this maibock to be a pretty smooth beer to drink considering the well hidden abv. Not a bad find for the price and with that strength, it held up pretty well over the course of spring into summer."

"D - This isn't very good, even for a style that I'm lukewarm about to begin with. The main redeeming element is the well-hidden alcohol."
"O - Not a bad beer, but this is a style I like quite a bit, and this one doesn't really stand out. Also, the metallic aspect really knocks it down a notch."
""
"O: Not quite what I was expecting. Nose teases you about a sweetness that never really shows. Def interesting with the breadiness though. I still can't place it other then the two pastries I mentioned above. Curious what other thought of this. Also very interested in trying some other Maibocks to compare. Will def keep an eye open from now on."
"Overall I have to say that I was pretty surprised with this beer and I ended up really liking it and I thought it was a pretty damn good Maibock, I don't have any experience with this style but I really like the fact that it is suppose to be a drinkable spring beer, flavorful but light enough to enjoy a few during the day while chilling outside, this beer has inspired me to seek out more of this style and try some traditional Maibocks. This beer was super drinkable, it never lasts long in my glass and goes great with some grilling outside and it paired great with some beer brats, I could drink a six pack of this throughout the day if I wanted to, as far as Bocks go I don't think they get much more drinkable then this. What I liked most about this beer was everything, this beer was firing on all cylinders and I thought every aspect was well done. There wasn't anything I didn't like about this beer, I couldn't find anything at all that was wrong with it, which isn't all that common. I will be buying more of this and have already got another six pack, I think everyone should give this beer a try, even my mom liked it and that doesn't happen often. I was really impressed with this beer, Atwater has a way of disappointing me a couple times in a row and just when I start to lower my expectations they come out of nowhere with an unexpectedly great beer, and that was the case with this beer, a very pleasant surprise. I can't say enough good things about this beer, and I am glad I took a chance on it, good job guys, this may be my choice beverage of the spring. So far this is my favorite Maibock, and one of my favorite beers from Atwater. All in all a great beer"
"Poured one and a half bottles into a half liter stein with a full golden/brass color with a blooming one and a half finger white head atop.Toasted grain sweetish alcohol in the nose,a faint iron note as well.Not as full and sweet as alot of maibocks but it's got a nice firm toastiness and a tinge of anise,it misses on some character traits but hits on a few others.Not as full as I would have liked in the mouthfeel but I think it's a little better than the ratings may suggest,not top tier but ok..."
""
"Overall: Looking over the reviews, this beer may have improved over the last few years but it is still not anywhere near the top of list for the style"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1 inch head, considerable lacing throughout. Smell is full of malts, somewhat sweet. Taste is also malty, sweet, some hops are present, good flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Very drinkable with a nice balance that is malt centric and showed no signs of the 7.5% ABV. Overall a good beer."
"D: Pretty high, especially for 7% ABV. Worth a try."
"Poured decently from the tap, not much head, so it just looks like a fuller glass, yay. Golden in color, cloudy in transparency. No smell that I can detect. Tastes sweet and bready, maybe yeasty, with a decent feel to it. Smooth and easy, a carbonation level to my preference, more moderate to low from this experience. I could barely believe the %ABV on this one because it was a very easy drink. It seems a very average beer, but there's an easiness to it that'l' have me order it again next time I see it, or pick it up if I see it in a bottle. This beer is very much worth a try."
"drinkability is good and would seek out this maibock next year"
"D- decent drinkability... It is on the light side, so it goes down easy, but the flavor is only interesting for one or two beers. After that I would get sick of it"
"Clear dark brass with a fine tan head that leaves sliding lace on the glass. Green apple skin and creamed corn in the nose. Thankfully this brew tastes way better than it smells. Untoasted grainy flavors with citric and floral hop notes in the finish. Light bodied with mild carbonation. Pretty easy drinking for a relatively strong Maibock."
"D- Not terrible, but not something I would seek out again. Drinks alright for the ABV."
"Notes: a good strong, malty lager with a bit of spicy flavor from hops"
"Cheers."
"Other than that strange taste I detected, nothing too particularly memorable about this beer. Pretty easy drinking and I managed to enjoy the overall experience. Not sure that I would purchase again."
"Notes from 5/24/07"
"Quite a tasty little brew. There are a lot of very sweet fruit flavors: pears, peaches, apples, and appricots. Very candied with confectionate sugars. The nose suggests that this beer is too sweet to enjoy, but the delicate candied malts and fruits prove otherwise. The appearance worried me at first with an over-carbonated pour that led me to think that an infection may have occured, but this was not the case. A bold, white, loose-knit head formation reminded me a bit of Duvel, but the retention proved to be merely mortal. The beer feels a bit syrupy sweet, leaving it not well attenuated so the mouthfeel gives up what the rich flavors gain. I get only a subtle corn taste late that most BA's describe as dominant- perhaps the 6 months+ age has helped out. Finishes sweet, a bit tacky, and... well fruity-- makes me wonder the temperature or yeast that they used for fermentation. If you like sweet, low-hopped ales, this may be up your alley."
"I'm flabbergasted that Atwater Block continues to keep their doors open. Mai-Bock is my seventh brew from this brewery and is the worst of a very nasty lot. What are the odds that I've gotten ahold of seven (seven!) bad bottles... from three different stores... in two different states... at two separate times? Since Cold Spring (formerly Gluek) has improved some of their products, I hereby nominate these guys for America's worst microbrewery. Gack!"
"Not sure what I was expecting with this beer. Atwater has let me down in the past, but this beer is different. It's not bad by any means. The golden color is offset by the huge white head that sticks around forever - it took me at least an hour to drink this and the head never faded. There is plenty of carbonation, but that is subdued with time. Tropical fruit is on the nose - pineapple and maybe some banana. The taste is harder to place with nondescript flavors that are kind of mashed together, but it is distinctly sweet with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is fine - a little syrupy, but nothing great. It took me a while to finish this one and not because it's a sipper necessarily. The ABV is 7.5%, which is big enough to warrant sipping, but this beer does not get much better as it warms. A decent offering. Mild recommendation."
"As Maibocks go, this is ok. Not the best, but come on...it is not an F. You MN boys must have had a 6 pack that was over exposed to light or something...I know the Atwater folks well, and they make decent beer. Not anything worthy of an F."
"Golden body. Very hazy. LOTS of CO2 bubbles apparant. Big frothy rocky white head. (All signs that maybe this is a bit too carbonated.) Chemical smell of sulfur and of an electrical fire. Awful aroma. Carbonation is too high. The electrical fire aroma translates nicely over to the palate (or not nicely in this case). This beer is highly flawed. This is the first beer I will actually pour down the drain in years."
"This tastes nothing like a maibock or lager and tossing out the category this just doesn't appeal to me."
"There are big elements of this that I don't like at all. Some of it is my fault with my neuroses and biases, but the majority of the blame falls on the beer."
"drinkability: fine"
"I dont think I would be able to drink to many of these in a sitting due to the sourness."
"Pours out to a bright and dense yellow in the glass with a good-sized head. The aroma is slightly sweet, with a faint hint of marshmallows coming to the forefront. The taste is very good, with a slight sweetness on the sip giving way to a nice dose of hops on the swallow that turn off that sweetness. This tastes like a fully loaded lager. I dig it. Nicely done."
"I would definately recommend this brew. I may have received a bad bottle, but the taste is good. I just have to get past the first few sniffs."
"Scott"
"A little sweeter and hoppier than typical bocks. Lighter in color as well. It's got a fruity-like aftertaste. This beer is not as harsh or muddy as some seven-and-a-half percent alcohol beers. I like it. I like it quite a bit. I'm going to open another right now and support our struggling Detroit economy."
"Appears a crystal clear honey golden forms a large beige head forms leaves light sparse lace chunks as the head dwindles down. Aroma has a doughy sweetness light lemongrass sweetness herbal hops distinct biscuit malt tartness in there as well, fruity components bring some green apple and mild apricot tones. Flavor not so smooth a rough graininess that I usually detect in Atwater Block bottle openings kinda rough bitterness with leafy flavors doesn't meld so well a sour grainy finish with some traces of malty fruit tones. Mouthfeel is medium bodied again carbonation issues from this Atwater offering a bit higher than I would like. Drinkability is decent but by no means as clean and crips as a well made maibock should be kinda disappointing froma seasonal bottled offering from any micro."
"Drinkabiltiy is good, although it's definately on the sweet side. A good lager with lots of flavor, good for summertime."
"Sweet,clean, and crisp, all in all a very good beer to sit and enjoy any time of the year. get it if you are in the mood for something drinkable and flavor filled"
"D - Nearly perfect. An excellent spring sipper! I'll most likely be picking up a six of this soon."
"D - Sweet, and relatively well hopped, worth a second chance, but not an impressive Mai-bock considering it was not full bodied or very flavorful in any respect."
"On the whole this is not a great beer. Tartness is out of place, leading to my feeling that this may have been out of date. Lack of balance is also a drawback."
"Slight haze suspended in a peachy gold body. Small, gauzey, cotton-white head, with nice lacing. Don't know about the haze though (it's not chill haze). Caramel and butterscotch malt sweetness mixes with cooked vegetables, vegetal hops, and sweetish brandy alcohol. Taste is blech. Sour bandaid infection is awful. Sorry Atwater but this is the second different beer I've had that has been a totally infected mess! Leave the wild fermentation to Jolly Pumpkin, eh? Drain pour."
"Crystal-clear yellow with a thing slightly off-white head. Spicy hop is most prevelant on the nose, all bu hiding a candy-sweet malt note. Light sweet malt is accompanied by a hint of champagne-like esthers. Perhaps this is still a little young?, it tastes slightly acedylhyde-like. Hops are spicy and pleasantly bitter. Lightish body, pleasantly active carbonation makes for a very refreshing brew. Very drinkable, perhaps this needs handling differently. or perhaps the bottle was ""off"" but minus the champagne/acetylhyde, this would have been spectacular!"
"Overall a very nice helles bock. I love how the finish is dry and everything leading up to the finish is sweet and delicate. Quite a beautifully balanced spot-on domestic rendition of a hard-to-nail style. Excellent for sure!"
"from the bottle. poured a honey with a white head that didnt stay around very long but left some lacing. aroma sugar, yeast, light fruits like pears, apples. flavor, almost a cotton candy type of sweetness, malts, wow is this beer sweet, almost to the point of being too sweet."
