3.22,6.6,3,3.5,3.5,2,3,"O - Overall, I have no idea what to make of this beer. Its so bizarre. Its not really bad, but this isnt somethign I'd want to drink all day. Seems sweeter that a can of soda. Rot your teeth out sweet. Intense.","rudzud","Oct 23, 2011"

3.17,5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, extremely mild kick, good representation of style, it’s very different from any other kind of beer but on-target for the style which makes it a good low-ABV choice you’re looking for the sweetness that the style provides.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 03, 2011"

3.42,13.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: I was truly surprised to find this gone so quickly. The murky fruit and latent tartness grew on me, and the ample breadiness covered well. An easy drinker that I enjoyed quite a bit. Thanks to Woody, I have a couple more versions to compare... but I kinda like where this might be going.","msubulldog25","Mar 29, 2011"
2.93,-3,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Thanks to woodychandler for introducing me to the world of Kvass. Poured from a can, I was unable to decifer the Russian script to determine ounces. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet molasses, some malts. Taste is of sweet molasses, some malts and considerably sweet. Feels syrupy in the mouth and overall is not something I would want on a regular basis.","tone77","Mar 27, 2011"
3.83,26.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this is a very well made kvas that offers a great, dark maltiness. It's superbly balanced with the malt appearing upfront, the fruit making a secondary appearance, and then smoothly transitioning back into malt. Additionally, it finishes quite smooth, whereas many examples become sticky sweet and astringent. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Jan 25, 2011"
1.62,-46.4,4,2,1,2,1.5,"The Crack went off without a hitch and the Glug created a foamy finger off deep-tan/light-brown head with lousy retention. Hey, I took a shower yesterday! There's no need to run off and hide like that. Color was a deep-brown with garnet highlights. If this were a woman, I'd be swooning. Nose was a bit more sour than the others that I have had to date, fermented, but not in a good way. It had a raisin/date/prune odor, but accompanied by an odd sourness. Oof. Mouthfeel was thin with an immediate taste of medicine on the tongue. This tasted like old time cough syrup, the brown shit that you had to hold your nose to swallow. Man, I was not digging this one! Finish left me thinking that I might need to open a beer. I CANteplated a drain pour, but the ethics department of The KanKwest (TM) strictly forbids such things. Working through it, I got a lot of off flavors - the garlicky sourness noted by others, the taste of dried fruit that was not quite right, tobacco. Ugh. This was like what I imagine the bar drink that consists of the bartender pouring the mat in the well into your glass at the end of a long shift, but filtered through an ashtray would taste like. This would be for the most hardcore of KvassKwesters and even then ...","woodychandler","Dec 29, 2010"

2.86,-5.3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"The Kvass Kick has merged with brewing day today. This one pours a dark auburn-cola topped by about a finger or so of dark-ish ecru foam. The nose comprises pretzels, sweat, pumpernickel, and toasted rye bread. The taste holds notes of cola, root beer, dry rye bread, fennel, and garlic. The body is a definite medium, with a light fizzy carbonation and a light syrupy feel. Overall, I feel this whole kvass thing will kill me. That said, this one was a decent example of the style as I'm beginning to understand it, but it had a strange salty-sour quality (the sweat in the smell, the garlic in the taste) that really detracted from the whole experience.","TMoney2591","Aug 04, 2010"
2.84,-6,4,2.5,3,2,3,"This beer looks a cola brown with a fast fading appearance that is rather nice. The smell is of sweaty ball sack. This is sour and root like. The taste is oddly sweet with a pumpernickel spice flavor. This is a little too syrupy for my liking. I need to cut it with ice. It is drinkable when doctored with ice, but honestly it's not the worst kvass I've tasted.","Vdubb86","Jul 29, 2010"
3.01,-0.3,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Drinkability: a bit too sweet to just start slamming, this is still an interesting and refreshing beer. I bet it really punches the ticket on a hot day.","flagmantho","Beers"
3.68,21.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy red-brown color with a tan head. The aroma is bready malt with some honey. The flavor is heavy on the honey with some raisins and toffee notes. The beer is fairly sweet overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation","Mora2000","0"
