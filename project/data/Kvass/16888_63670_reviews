"O- My first stab at this style. It's like a malty iced tea with raisins and soft carbonation. I'm enjoying it, but I imagine it could get sickening in larger quantities."

"Overall: a tasty kvass, but I like a little bit more effervescence. This would help it a great deal, I think."
"Pours a cola-like brown with a bubbly, fizzy tan head. The body sits a fairly still dark brown with no lace anywhere. The nose is fairly sweet brown sugar, rye, dark malt...kind of a pumpernickle/brown bread presence. On the palate, sugary cola-like sweetness, with rye, dark malt, and brown bread. The taste is a little off-putting at first. Think carbonated wort. The feel is exactly what you think carbonated wort would taste like. Sweet sugary malts and mild carbonation. Medium body and syrup. I think this bottle was a little old, as the carbonation has fallen a bit. This was worth the tick, but probably not something I need to have again."
"It isn't too offensive. It less of a traditional kvas than most."
"The first glass disappeared in minutes, it's refreshing if nothing else, but sugary."
"Pours a clear darkish iced tea color with a fizzy 1 inch beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing whatsoever either. Smell is of rye bread, raisins, grapes, figs, and maybe some prunes. Very big dark dried fruit aromas. Taste is of bread, raisins, prunes, and some brown sugar to boot. Very much like a raisin bread in liquid form. I am pleasantly surprised by this to be quite honest. Pouring this out was quite fizzy but the mouthfeel is a tiny bit flat with some small carbonation bubbles on the tongue. This is my first kvass ever and I must say I think that this is a good ""beer"" coming out of Ukraine. I was expecting something disgustingly gross but I actually really enjoy drinking this one. I will be on the lookout for more kvass to do some comparisons."
"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another Kvass for me to try. Poured from a brown plastic 70 oz. !!! bottle. Has a cola like color with lots of carbonation and no head at all. Smell is of dark breads and molasses. Taste is very sweet, malts, molasses, a touch of spice. Feels syrupy in the mouth and overall is just a bit to sweet for my liking."
"Right off the bat, this is far more carbonated than most representatives of the style. The head even sticks around a bit as a ring, and you can see the bubbles streaming upward throughout the time it takes to empty the glass. It pours a chestnut brown, about normal for the style. Smells thin, and somewhat sour, even acetic a bit. I wouldn't call that exactly pleasant. Luckily, there is only a smidgen of the tang in the taste, and mostly at the finish. Mostly, you get some light sweetness up front, followed by some almost crackery breadiness, and then the sour kicks in. Somewhat refreshing, but a bit off balance."
"I just sliced off a piece of Kulich (Easter bread) and it goes REALLY well with this version of Kvass. Man, I need a Russian mail-order bride at this rate."
"Overall, it's well made and fairly drinkable but it lacks the character of some of the better examples of the style."
"The Kvass Kick continues, baby! This one pours a clear garnet-brown (heavy on the garnet) topped by a short-lived bit o' ecru soda fizz. The nose comprises pumpernickel, maple syrup, fennel, and a touch of light roasted malts. The taste isn't too different, though whatever roast character dwelled within the nose has escaped so that it may avoid the gullet altogether. The body is a light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a light syrupy feel. Overall, a decent kvass, but this one's a bit more fizzy and soda-like than the others thus far. Can't say that that endears it to me very much."
