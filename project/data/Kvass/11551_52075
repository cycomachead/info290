3.61,11.1,4,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"It was flat upon pouring, but I will take the hit on that. I shared some with a buddy on Saturday night and the remainder is going to tone77, so repeated opening and closing of the bottle was probably a contributor. It is not that anyone in my circle dislikes Kvass, per se, but it can be very filling. I felt like I had eaten a loaf of rye bread by the time we finished on Saturday. Color was a deep, dark brown with limited light penetration. Nose smelled of bready chocolate, very pleasant indeed. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was unique to Kvass. It had a sort of milk chocolatiness, but along with a rye bite, not exactly sour, but close to it. Finish was semi-sweet and quite tasty. I can understand why it is drank as a thirst quencher and also why so many of us only need a half a glass or so. It is one of those drinks where a little can go a long way.","woodychandler","Apr 16, 2012"
3.15,-3.1,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"This poured out as a root beer colored beer. There was a thin quick fading head, no lacing or retention. The smell is earthy with some dried fruits, brown sugar and molasses. The mouthfeel was a little on the flat side... Not as much bubble as I was hoping for. Overall a decent Kvass.","Knapp85","Oct 07, 2011"
3.1,-4.6,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall: a mediocre kvass. I would have liked a bit less sweetness and a bit more carbonation, although the smell is good and it mostly has the right balance of flavors.","flagmantho","May 24, 2011"

3.83,17.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"With all of that said, it shouldn't be surprising that Nikola is a well-made and very clean, mainstream-style kvass. It's got just a light touch of carbonation to it; and it balances its dark-malt & molasses breadiness perfectly, leaving it flavorful and traditional tasting, but still refreshing (there's little stickiness left behind in the mouth). In additional versions it's blended with fruit juice or added flavors in a variety of flavors.","NeroFiddled","Apr 02, 2011"
2.58,-20.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pretty average kvass at best. Typical cola brown color with no head and virtually no carbonation in this case. Just a touch of carbonation really helps a kvass, and this one could use one. Thin, sour, with a little too little breadiness, and too much fruitiness as well as a somewhat thin metallic finish. I don't really care for this particular take on the style.","Georgiabeer","Dec 18, 2010"
3.42,5.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"2 liter plastic bottle, best by date of 15/08/11. Served in a pint glass, the brew pours a dark ruby red/brown color that you can see through when held up to the light. Not much of any head at all, but what head is there is a tan color. Not much lacing either. Aroma is very sweet, it smells like molasses, dark bread, dark fruit, and some toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark bread, molasses, cola, dark fruit (raisins), and some caramel. Like the aroma, it tastes very sweet. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit thin but it's also slick with low carbonation. If you like sweet beers, then you'll probably like this. Not a bad overall brew, but it took a little while to finish the bottle myself because of the sweetness. Worth a try, it's certainly different.","bluejacket74","Dec 13, 2010"
3.05,-6.2,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Despite the best by date of next year, it smells like oxidation (wet cardboard) and sweet caramelized sugar. Tastes like caramel raisin prune juice, some malty presence, rye bread is distinguishable. Some astringency, and dry in the finish. Loses carbonation quickly, and is a bit too sweet in general. Fairly easily quaffed like soda. Pretty average, probably won't seek this out again.","emerge077","Aug 14, 2010"
3.35,3.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The Kvass Kick moves back into Mother Russia. This offering pours a clear amber-ruby topped by some tall, fizzy ecru foam. Frankly, this has one of the most steadfast heads I've yet seen on a kvass, despite its fizziness. The nose comprises rye toast, fennel, light maple syrup, pumpernickel, and a touch of burnt caramel. The taste holds notes of pumpernickel, smoky toffee, caraway seeds, black pepper, and rye bread. The body is a straight medium, with a lightly fizzy carbonation and a feel akin to Jell-O sliding through the lips (shooter-style, baby!). Overall, one of the better examples of plastic-bottle kvass I've encountered so far, but the nearly slimy feel ruins what could have been a decent drink.","TMoney2591","Jun 26, 2010"
3.32,2.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"M + D: Sparkling and even dry. It isn't quite as refreshing as I hoped, but alright. I'd wouldn't reject a revisit.","Proteus93","Jun 26, 2010"
3.5,7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights. There is no head but there are a few white bubbles on the surface. The aroma is a lot of sugar along with bread. The flavor has notes of rye bread, raisins, honey, sugar and Coca-Cola. A person I was drinking the beer with said it tasted like someone poured flat Coca-Cola on top of a bowl of Raisin Bran. I agree. The beer is very sweet. Low carbonation that borders on being flat and a medium mouthfeel.","Mora2000","May 01, 2010"
3.52,8.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a dark brown with a decent looking tan had and no lacing. Smell is a good amount of sweetness with a bit of molasses and brown sugar. Taste is similar with a bit of rye. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with okay carbonation. Drinkability is on the lower side. A bit cloying and quite strange.","Thorpe429","Beers"
