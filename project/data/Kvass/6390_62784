2.91,-8.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Beer is thin and sweet, still on the palate, finish is grainy and bitter. It is like flat soda with a grainy aftertaste. Not a repeat but not the worst kvas I've had.","drabmuh","Oct 16, 2011"
2.83,-11,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Pours a dark brown. Reddish tint. A touch of wie hed on the rim of the glass. Looks decent. Smells oxidized and malty. Lots of raisony charcteristics. Tastes sweet and malty. Lote of dark fruits. A bit watery. Bt surprisingly carbonated. Overall not that exciting but solid.","Urbancaver","Oct 14, 2011"

3.44,8.2,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"So, I used to work at a discount food store and one day a pallet of this stuff showed up. So I bought a plastic bottle of it for 75 cents and gave it a shot. Later I learned I should have bought more; it’s made in the same town my gf is from (Penza) and she loves it. Who knew? Crazy Russians. Anyway, out of the plastic bottle this ‘beer’ was brown like a Coca Cola with a short lived head that quickly fizzled out to nothing. Very little lacing was present. The aroma was sweet and malty with notes of molasses, brown sugar, rye bread and yeast. The flavors were similar to a soda with a pungent note of fermentation at the very end. Lot of rye, molasses, raisins and a bit of caramel followed by a sour yeasty finish. Pleasant, but more like a soda than a beer. The body was light, the carbonation light and the mouthfeel thin. Very odd, but I’m glad I finally know what she was talking about when she said they’d drink Kvass all summer…","thekevlarkid","May 27, 2011"
3.35,5.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it's one of the cleaner and more balanced kvass I've tasted. That's good in that it's relatively accessible, but I personally prefer kvas that has a little more character.","NeroFiddled","May 19, 2011"
3.27,2.8,3.5,4,3,3,3,"This ""beer"" glugs from its plastic bottle into the pint glass with a brown cola like appearance to it. Taupe foam is not long lasting in the slightest. The aroma smells like cracked wheat bread or perhaps pumpernickel, either way it smells like tasty bread. However...it's is disgustingly sweet to the taste. The bread comes through tasting like it was covered in corn syrup. For a kvass it's actually not all that bad. For a beer, its disgusting. I could have used some carbonation on this one to help out the mouthfeel and the super sticky sweetness. Overall this was an average kvass, nothing exceptional about it. I still don't like these beers, but I can tolerate them...when cut by water or ice cubes...whatever is on hand.","Vdubb86","Oct 20, 2010"
3.29,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"After too long o' delay, the Original Kvass Kick returns to the Original Kvass-Land. I've been itchin' for a new kvass for a couple weeks now, so let's dive in. It pours a clear dark garnet with no real head to speak of. Even some effort in pouring didn't yield much more than a few sparse bubbles on the surface. Sad, really. The nose comprises rye crust, fennel, honey, cola, mild roasted malts, and some even milder, lighter, airier cocoa in the back. The taste follows this formula, emphasizing the fennel and cola over the others without smothering them out altogether. A slice of sourdough and lightly tart berry cuts in near the finish to round things out. The body is a weak medium, with a lightly fizzy carbonation and a limply syrupy feel. Overall, not a bad kvass, really. Things are just bready enough to not be confused with root beer, but the feel was a little on the sad side for me.","TMoney2591","Beers"
4.12,29.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: This is an interesting beverage. I'm really unsure as to whether I would even consider Kvass to be beer (though, admittedly, this is the only one I've tried), but it's still an enjoyable drink. This could make a good summer refresher, and is a good change of pace from typical colas (more refreshing, as well, as it doesn't leave you thirsty afterwards). A unique drink certainly worth trying once- personally, I doubt I'll have this much, but it can be good from time-to-time.","Mosstrooper","0"
