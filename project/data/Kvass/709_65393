2.75,-19.4,3,3,2.75,2.5,2.5,"Overall- It's good for what it is and it seems to be fairly representative of the style. I would not classify it as beer though. It's not even considered an alcoholic beverage in Russia. Give it a try. I was a bit apprehensive but I definitely have had worse “supposedly great” beers. I wouldn't repurchase this but I might try others of its style- especially American interpretations.","artoolemomo","Apr 02, 2013"

3.39,-0.6,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,"O - It's like drinking a really sweet, flat cola. I think more carbonation would help. This is my first dalliance with this style. I would like to try some others for comparison.","buschbeer","Nov 30, 2012"
2.58,-24.3,3,2.5,2.5,2,3,"Poured this one out among the family yesterday at our annual Christmas party. The for many of them it was their first time trying Kvass. Basically I sold it to them as a "Russian Soda". Many didn't like it and found it hard to drink a 2/3 full glass of it. Either way it pours out as a clear looking reddish brown color. There is a thin and quick fading head on top. The smell of the beer is sweet, it's got a boat load of molasses on the nose as well as plenty of bread-like aromas as well. The taste is sweet for the most part, there is the main flavor of molasses and bread followed by what I thought tasted like grapes in the finish. The mouthfeel of this was much like a soda, watered down and carbonated... not much complexity at all. Overall it's a pretty traditional Kvass, not much else to say... It's a decent drink but not something I would rush out to buy more of.","Knapp85","Oct 07, 2011"
3.6,5.6,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Tastes tangy and full of raisins, bready rye and barley linger, not overly sweet and only moderately so. Finishes sort of dry, must be the sugar though. Thin and watery, as commercial Kvas often is, though not always. Very drinkable though, in small part due to the lower carbonation. Distinct rye bread aftertaste after a bigger quaff. Overall not bad, a warm weather beverage to pair with hearty food.","emerge077","May 03, 2011"

3.31,-2.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a brown plastic 1 liter bottle. Has a dark brown color, no head whatsoever. Smell is rather mild, some molasses. Taste is good, lots of dark bread, some molasses, a touch of spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decnet brew.","tone77","Apr 24, 2011"
4.14,21.4,4,5,4,3,4,"This one also evidenced a little bit of carbonation, enough to produce some wisps when I finished the pour. Color was a mahogany-brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose was, as a previous reviewer mentioned, VERY bready. It was like sniffing a dark rye bread fresh out of the oven, along with notes of dried dark fruit, like raisins and/or prunes. Mouthfeel was slightly on the thin side, not quite watery, but close. The taste was quite unusual with an initial fruity sourness followed by a caramel sweetness. This was probably as close to liquid bread as I have tried thus far. Finish lingered with the caramel sweetness noted in the mouth. I would definitely drink this one again.","woodychandler","Apr 16, 2011"
3.97,16.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"One of the better Kvass's I've had, with a deep breadiness balaced nicely by yeasty notes and a bit of fruitiness. In addition, there is a nice carbonation to the bottle I drank. It starts with a reasonable head that fades immediately, but the carbonation stays. Pours a slightly cloudy brown with a touch of orange. Smells nicely of pumpernickel bread, rye, honey, and jammy fruit as well as yeast. The taste is similar with a nice balance between the flavors and the bready notes being most prominent. What I like best about this Kvass is that it is not too sour, and not too sweet. I also like the yeastiness and the nice breadiness too it. Quite drinkable.","Georgiabeer","Mar 28, 2011"
3.86,13.2,3,4.5,4,3,3.5,"This is a very unique style of drink. The first time I tried Kvass was while visiting Kyiv, Ukraine and I really disliked it. I think now that my palate has become accustomed to a wide variety of different beers, I can appreciate this for what it is. While I don't see myself reaching for a kvass very often at the store, I did enjoy this and would have more in the future.","sommersb","Jan 17, 2011"

2.77,-18.8,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,"The Kvass Kick is back in gear and headed back into Ukraine! And to think I agreed with the assessment that Ukraine was weak... Anyway, this thing pours a clear russet-garnet with a sad excuse for a dirty white head. The nose comprises rye bread, wheat, sourdough, white bread (yeah, I said it...this is really bready, folks!), wet cardboard, and fennel. It's nice to have an actually bready-smelling kvass, but it goes too far with the idea and adds some slightly unsavory notes to boot. Hrm. The taste hols notes of fennel, rye bread, raisins, red grapes (the small ones that end up being slightly sour when you bite into them, evoking a subdued wince and a strong sense of disappointment), and old, flat root beer. The body is a rather light medium, with a lightly fizzy carbonation and a slightly watery, slightly syrupy feel. Overall, I was decidedly underwhelmed with this kvass, especially with its slightly oddball flavoring. I mean, I expect a mild sourness, but not one that leans toward the fruity side of taste. Right? Right.","TMoney2591","0"
