"Exceptionally flavorful and well balanced with a medium hop bitterness and Pils malt softness dominating. The finish is off dry. An overall crisp and refreshing beer and a great example of the style."

"Pours a clear, straw color with a small white foam head that dissipates quickly. Leaves a little bit of lacing. Not too much going on the aroma. Wheat with faint spices and orange and lemon zest. The taste is so incredibly wonderfully balanced-- something NG has mastered. Some of their beers may be a little more subtle, but man do they do it well. Some really pleasant wheat. A little bit of grassiness, and some nice orange and lemon notes. A small amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. Really easy to drink. Crisp and refreshing, perfect drink for the end of the summer. Well carbonated. Overall another excellent entry by New Glarus."

"may need to update this later, but so far this beer is living up to expectations, with lots of clean grassy hop aroma, a buttload of crispness, and the right amount of grassy/citrusy/herbal flavor and bitterness on the back end.  the extremely pale yellow color might put some off, but that would be a shame.  too bad they did not release this earlier in the summer (at least i didn't notice until september), for it would make an ideal warm afternoon quencher."

"A very well-done, true-to-style German-style pils.  Very enjoyable and easy-to-drink!"
"Overall: It is incredible to me how New Glarus can make some many lagers that carry a familiar yeast profile yet the surrounding characters are so different and complex and create completely different beers.  Certainly the king of lagering in the Midwest and in my opinion in the running against anyone anywhere.  They execute their styles so masterfully, well done Dan!"
"WOW I love this beer I have always looked forward to the release of this this is the 2nd or 3rd release I have had and man this always lets me know what a American brewery can do with a Pilsner!"

"Mouthfeel is crisp refreshing and light. A fair amount of hop oils and resin balance the body."

"O- This is well done and I'm happy to be a Wisconsin resident for easy access to beers like this."

"O: Pretty typical German style lager. The hops are the star which is standard for the style. Nothing mind blowing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not really big on pilsners, but I could drink this all day. Really well balanced and just plain enjoyable"
"Overall - This is a damn fine beer and mad drinkable to boot."
""
""
""
"O-	I am not much of a Pilsner connoisseur but I would have to say that this take is the most balanced, and delicious take on the style I have had to date. Extremely well balanced. A delicious bready pilsner featuring sweet malt flavors and an excellent hop backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty nicely done take on a Pilsner. Nice bready Pils taste with a solid hop backing."
"O- excellent, well bittered pilsner, but still with a ""backbone"" of malt, as the bottle says. A great, relaxed drinker from New Glarus."
"Pours a golden yellow stalk like color. Nose is sweet cereal malts with a nice caramel malts and a bit of grassy hops. Taste starts off with citrus lemon. These move on to a grainy malt flavor and are finished off by some spicy, grassy hops. Like most of their beers, really soft mouthfeel, smooth and full taboot. Overall, this is a nice, lightly hopped pilsner. Props to NG for brewing a really nice pilsner."
""
""
"Pours gold, fizzy, bubbles, thick white head. Active. Translucent. Retention and lacing. Big pilsy smell. Quite german, and minerals too. Crisp taste, light lemon. Balanced hop. Refreshing. Great pils, nails the style. Bursts with flavor, but simple and drinkable. Spot on."
""
"Picked up a single at Casanova in Hudson, WI. It's dry, crisp, and hoppy, what a nice example of a German pilsner. The aroma is a little hoppier than a beer straight from the motherland, but that's by no means a bad thing. The hops are herbal and grassy upfront with mild kicks of lemon and grapefruit. The malt jumps out from behind the hops, with mix of doughy and toasty bread notes. A delicious beer, it reminds me of a more traditional (and more drinkable) version of Victory's Prima Pils. The finish is biting and a little rough, like you'd expect from a healthy helping of Euro hops. I'd have another."

"3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5"

"Hometown Blonde pours a clear golden color with a nice size had. The smell is a bit weak, but has a bit of a malty sweetness. The taste is full, has a crisp malty flavor, that finishes a bit sweet, and has a grain like flavor. Good full flavor. Overall a very solid and full bodied pils."
"O: Even better than Victory Prima Pils. My new favorite in this style class."
""
"I love this. I buy this on purpose. I pass up buying hop bombs, IPAs, Pale Ales, and all sorts of elaborate brews to take this home. And, it still never disappoints."
"This beer is truly impressive. I'm not thrilled with the taste, but everything else about it is darn good. And the mouthfeel is about the best I've encountered in any beer, any style. Just like that, it's gone. I plan to drink a whole lot of this come next summer."
""
""
"This is a great fall beer for me and a reminder of how much the style has to offer when it’s done right."
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Overall, its always great to be able to depend on a brewery like New Glarus to deliver a solid to great beer. Highly drinkable and sessionable while still providing good flavors and smoothness."
"o - Overall a slightly above average pilsner. Not bad at all, but not a ton going on to be honest; kind of surprised by the high score. Easy drinking and better than most light beers, but otherwise nothing special. Probably my least favorite NG beer to date."
""
"Overall, I like this beer. It is a very solid example of American micro pilsener. The bottle says ""German-style brew", but there is nothing in Germany even close to this. The ample addition of caramel malts is the first problem, the use of dry hopping the second. The cloying mouthfeel and the aromatic hop oil aftertaste scream American micro. If you like Samuel Adam´s Noble PIls or Victory`s Prima Pils, you will like this one. If you like Bitburger and Warsteiner, you will not."
""
""
"Overall a fantastic pils, I've learned to expect only great things from New Glarus"
"Spot on, I would not expect anything less from New Glarus though even with that said ... they really nailed it here. Close to perfection for the style. Puts many of the imported counterparts to shame."
""
"This beer poured out as a clear looking yellow color with a foamy white head on top. The head retention was pretty strong on this from start to finish. The lacing wasn't much to look at other than a few scattered clumps on the glass. The smell of the beer was of fresh grains and yeast. The taste of the beer is very mild, it's slightly grassy but mostly grainy with a subtle hop spark in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was clean, light bodied, moderately refreshing and dry in the finish. Overall this beer was pretty good for what it is. It's not something I am all that into but it's a good beer that fits the style I think. Definitely worth trying."
"a solid beer again by new glarus! such a simple beer style, i didn't they could get this good."

"There is nothing better than waking up and finding out there is a new New Glarus beer on the market. This is a great, unique add to their already stellar line up of brews. I’m sure not many will find this to be their new favorite, but it is a nice transition from Totally Naked to Home Town Blonde. In the German tradition, here’s Prost!"

""
"I'm not a huge pilsener guy, but this was simple and quite refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great appearance. I'm disappointed in the condition of the beer although it wasn't completely ruined. Flavor wise the green bottle character somewhat mimicked, to an extent, the hops."
"O: great beer this is what a Pilsener should be! I could drink this all day long"
""
""
"New Glarus' version of a pilsener pours a clear dark golden color with just a wisp of white foam. Bready malt mixed with herbal spice in the aroma. Smooth and light on the palate with just the right lift of carbonation. The cracker malt quickly gives way to a spicy herbal bitter finish. The bitterness lingers on the palate and this is a good thing. Wanting more, I drain the bottle and regret the purchase of just one. The bottle claims that this is an old word pilsener and I cannot dispute their claim. I put this beer in a very select group of top-notch American made German-style pilseners."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is exquisite. Light and ideally carbonated with a low abv, this is a treat. While pilsners are the Rodney Dangerfield of the big beer world, this offering from New Glarus should not be overlooked. Another really solid offering from Mr. Carey and crew."
""
""
"D/O- Easily one of the most quaffable pilsners I've had. The refreshing, clean aftertaste is my favorite characteristic of Home Town Blonde. Another hit from up north."
"This is a very well made German Pils. I highly recommend giving it a try."
"Overall: It a good german pilsner. It honestly tastes like staghorn and two women lager blended together. Great summer beer that offers craft beer drinkers something that has more flavor than your average light beer, but you can still drink a 6 pack on a really hot day."
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, this Pils pours brilliantly clear deep golden/light copper color with a moderate bright white head that lasts nicely and leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is a burst of spicy, floral hops and bready malt, a perfect marriage of malt and hops...a very welcoming nose. The flavor is sweet, bready malt and spicy hop flavor. The bitterness is moderate and helps to dry the finish slightly, perfectly balancing the sweetness from the malt. A long lasting subtle malt/hop tango lasts on the sides and back of the tongue. The body is medium and carbonation appropriately medium/medium-high. Overall a very well made beer; it shines from the initial pouring to after the last swallow is gone."
""
""
""
"O. This is a top-notch Pilsener that is so damn drinkable - maybe the best I have had from an American producer. Not a style I go out of my way to purchase but this will be in my fridge until the snow flies."
"O - It shouldn't come as a surprise that New Glarus' remarkable take on a classic German Pilsner is but a few shades away from pure perfection; after all, brewer Dan Carey DID serve his brewing apprenticeship just outside of Munich, Germany. This golden beauty is loaded with German noble hops for a floral and bitter balance to the crisp and extremely drinkable medium-light bodied beer. It's a shame lagers are under-appreciated; this is one damn fine tasting beer I wish I had my hands on all summer!"
""
""
"O) Thanks for bringing this one back NG. A top notch pilsner for sure. If you have access to this brew, you should definitely try it. The more I drink this, the more impressed I have become. Glad to recommend...."
"O -- A wonderful drinker for those looking for a US-brewed, German-style beer. A great take on the style, glad it was brought back."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" white head over the cloudy golden amber brew. Head is quickly down to a skim of teensy bubbles, with average slow-falling lace. Aroma is minimal, with pale malt sweetness trying to take a stand. Taste starts with the pale malts, goes a touch fruity in the middle, and then closes with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and definitely sedate, and drinkability is not bad either. This beer seems to be trying to fly under the radar, not too much standout, but nothing bad either."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent head the recedes quickly leaving no lace as I sip away. Smell is slightly sweet with grainy malts and light hops character. Taste is on par with the aroma. Grainy, malty, slightly bitter finish. Medium bodied, with good carbonation. Very light and easy to drink. Perfect for the summer!"
"Taste is lightly spicy off the top with a peppery note, then some more floral sweetness, then some nutty malt and a lemon sourness. There's a surprisingly hoppy bitterness here, and it's welcoming and flavorful. This is a very tasty pilsner, and very dry, it keeps you wanting more. Carbonation is just zippy enough, and the body is medium-light. Great all around flavourful pilsner."
"Pours rich golden into a pilsner glass with a nice bubbly and foamy white head giving good lacing. Smell is nice light malt, a bit lemony, tangy yeast and nice fresh breadiness. Taste is a touch thin, but nicely crisp, a hint lemony and very refreshing with a nice neutral bitterness. Easy to drink with no off flavors and a uniqueness to it. Simple but nice."
"I was disappointed with this one. There are a lot of stylistic errors here, but it's a decent drink. Though not one I would seek out again."
"I really enjoy this beer as its so hard to find a good light (as in color) beer. This one is spot on, nice work New Glarus!"
"D - Good beer with a complex flavor that keeps you drinking and wondering what is that taste, in a good way."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew for a nice hot summer day, but i dont think ill buy it this late in the year again"
"This was a good pilsner and could be consumed in quantity. It would be a real good beverage to sit down with on warmer days when you could probably pick up different nuances. This one is also enjoyable through the colder days as it could remind you of the warmer days although it could be après ski also. What the heck, I guess you could drink this all year and be happy."
"Almost hazy golden lemon body with a small, gauzy, off-white head. Honey and biscuit malt with peppery, spicy, Saaz-y hops. Nice. A flash of noble hop bitterness gives quickly gives way to honey-dipped biscuit malt and cookie dough. Spicy, herbal bitter hops in the finish. Moderate body with a smooth, soft feel. An excellent German-style pilsener."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and easily drinkable with a nice creaminess to it as well. Very refreshing, this is just a perfect example of what a pilsner should be and I wish I would've picked up more of this. This one stacks up with the best of 'em. Another wonderfully brewed beer from New Glarus! Grab some if you still can."
"D - I have gone through a case already this summer. It seems to loose a little of the hops as the summer passed but a tasty everyday drinker none the less."
"Very drinkable. It's not my prefered style of beer, but if this was the only craft brew in the joint then you won't find me complaining. Its nice to have a beer that does its style well, een if its not your favorite."
" ~ For a lighter beer the flavor is well established and firm. The character of this beer is impressive."
"Classic Pilsner. Clean, clear, bright light gold with loads of carbonation and a thin white, bubbly head. Aroma of noble hops, grass, floral perfume, and light malts. Herbal and grassy flavor with nice lightly spiced floral hops in the finish. Initially damp and sweet flavor gives way to a lingering dry, hoppy finish in each sip. Light to medium bodied. Very representative of the style. Well done and definitely drinkable."
"The taste is even better, lots of noble hops again here, more spices, has a bit of a bite to it even, a nice bit of bittering here, much appreciated, always riding on top. On the understated side, again some grainy, slightly caramel malt sticks to its thing. The medium body is smooth but well carbonated ride right through to the end. Not normally a pilsner fan, I must say, this is one that I definitely like. A lot."
"Wish I had a case of this..."
"A great summer brew with its pronounced crisp, clean, and refreshing character. Light body makes for a very drinkable and sessionable brew. Bold Noble hop character may reduce its approachability, but this is simply another great lager from NG."
"Got in trade with jeffkrenner - thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dates by notches on label. The color was a slightly cloudly golden yellow. It had a couple fingers of white head that slowly settled to a constant film. Decent lacing. The smell was typical pilsener - wet grass clippings and noble hops. The taste was good but pils is not one of my favorite styles. Not bad but they have an aftertaste that is very off-putting. Overall a decent beer and worth trying if you can easily get your hands on. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Full-bodied with the perfect refreshing twang at the end. Very drinkable and a nice offering from New Glarus."
"Bottle courtesy from Monger: Poured a bright gold yellow color beer with a nice big pure white foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of floral malt with some dry crisp hops is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by some floral malt with some light sweet notes and a medium dry crisp finish which is quite enjoyable. Body is full for the style with some good carbonation. Another very good beer from a great brewer from a style that produce too much crap IMO."
"D: Not bad. Not a huge fan of the flavor that my wife likes to refer to as the yuck, coins flavor."
"Great drinkability. Medium-light body, tasty, enough hop character to make it interesting, smoother on the finish. Need to find this on tap somewhere."
"12 oz bottle. This brew pours a slightly oranged yellow color with a half finger of loosely packed bubbles over top that is maintained by a healthy stream of carbonation through the column of very clear liquid. The aroma is lightly honey-sweet, with a mild and crisp grain character bolstered by the spiceyness of a healthy dose of noble hopping. This one really smells nice with the contrasts between the light sweet and crisp hop and grain. The flavor hits with a grassy hop and moderate bitterness initially. This moves to a more grainy roughness that is polished with the sweetness I associate with pilsner malt. It finishes with a second wave of moderate bitterness that maintains itself on the sides of my tongue and spicey and slightly herbal hop notes. This one seems to be showcasing noble hops, with a bit of the grainy and sweet hop character sandwiched in between. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles. I like the somewhat heavier-than-expected quality of this one, as it really makes me want to slow down a bit while drinking it. I find this brew to be very approachable. The hops are prevalent, but not obtrusive. This is one to sit down and savor on a warm day as a refresher, in my opinion."
"all in all, this is a good german pilsener. for drinkers that like this style, this one would make for a good try."
"drinkability: very high"
"Pours a clear golden color with a slightly orange hue; frothy white head that retains well and leaves good lacing. Smell is of faint grass, spicy hops, and I get a little lemon and honey in there as well. Biscuity upfront, hints of honeycomb, hops are slightly spicy, but not overdone, a nice lemon zest too. Both body and carbonation are probably around medium levels, but very soft and refreshing on the tongue, quenching your thirst, but encouraging you to take another. Excellent beer; I plan on drinking copious amounts of this over the summer. Updated on July 17, 2007. Original smell was 4.5, taste was 5. Having had this plenty of times, I still rather enjoy it, but prefer Yokel or Edel-Pils to this one."
"An American take on a German Pilsner, New Glarus Brewing's Home Town Blonde is a big step up from the standard Joe-six-pack pilsner. Pours a golden amber with a light foam head and no lace. Smells lightly hoppy with a hint of fresh figs. Nice sweet taste that finishes to a slight hop bitterness. Very well balanced and moreish. Substantial mouthfeel and highly drinkable. Great as a marinade with steak, bratwurst."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow with big white head that's fairly thin, but laces well. Smells very bready some fruity notes and fruits. Tastes very good, yum. Bery bready, malty characteristics, but with an interesting sweetness to it. Some fruits noted in the taste as well, with great hoppy smoothness. This brew has medium ammount of carbonation and it feels great going down. An easier drinking beer with a huge ammount of taste, this is a pretty good brew. Great beer overall."
"Very mellow, but plenty of taste where is counts, nothing too light or too heavy, this beer just floats around your mouth with the greatest of ease. I'm hoping for this to be around in summer, it shall make a great afternoon beer. Easier to drink than water, carbonation is light and easy to take on; 6-packs are an insult, I would buy this by the case."
"Color is a cloudy pale yellow with a nice medium strength white head that stays kinda puffy thick eventually settling to a skim always present and very tiny spots of lace. Smell is quite unique, smells like fruity pebbles, with nice light fruits of berrys and a light dried bread or cracker-like backing with a trace of hops that lends some notes of mustyness and herbal quality. Taste is quite complex and very interestingly yummy. Straight up easy and soft bready malts up front, so smooth and soft its just a pleasure to let it touch the tongue. Oh so very nice. A touch of fruitish berries hinting with very light grains of wheat and the hops are so pleasingly balanced in with nice even herbal/grassy notions thats very nice on the palette. Very steady and mellow balance with a super nice finish that is a bit like saltine crackers with a light drying with a dash of bread salts like that of dry pretzels. One excellent taste'n Pils!! Feel is a solid medium body with a small kick in the middle, mellowing smooth, lightly crisp and drying finish with lingering saltish drying that sticks around on the sides of the cheeks. Yum, yum,yum, Home Town Blonde in my tum. One very fine German Pils. Another keeper by N.G.!"
"Pours clear golden in color with an airy white head that practically melts away to nothing. Hops really pop on the nose of this one, in addition to a bready aroma. Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp. The four style of hops that are utilized are really featured in the flavor of this classic German-styled lager. The hop bitterness hits midway across the tongue and remains throughout the finish. As the beer warms a bit, the malt backbone becomes more prominent. I dropped the drinkability a little, because this just seems to be a filling beer for some reason. Otherwise, though, truly an enjoyable German-style Pilsner."
"I am somewhat surprised to admit that this is one of New Glarus' best offerings (and maybe their best ""regular"" year-round product)."
"This isn't my type of beer, but tastes pretty close to what I envisioned a beer billed as a german style pilsner to taste like.."
"There's a nice pilsner malt backbone.  Good take on a German-style Pilsner."
