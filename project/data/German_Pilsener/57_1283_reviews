"A little bit of cocoa in the flavor, otherwise a straightforward lager. Overall, it’s pretty good."
""
"Solid pils. Nothing outstanding, but very solid and much better than plenty of other choices out there. Would get again."
""
"Good shit bro, awesome beer"

"This is a proper representation of the style. A truely great drinking experience. Another good beer from this brewery makes them, in my opinion, the best brewery in Mexico. Grupo Modelo/Corona is a distant second with their meager offerings compared to a brewery that produces Noche Buena and the Bohemia series."
""

"Overall- A pretty enjoyable brew, great with food."
"The best beer our great neighbors from the south have provided. I once went to a Mexican restaurant and the stuck a lime on the top of the bottle... I flicked that stupid lime in a second and informed the waiter,  this is Bohemia a real beer #nolimerequired."
"This is the best beer you can get at a Mexican mini super, it´s very good in comparison with all other beers in the local fridge."
"I like how this beer quenches my thirst but makes me want another drink too. Goes great with food."
"I like Mexican beers alright. This one is one of my favorites. Nice and crisp."
"This is a very good beer one  of my favorite mexican beers"

"Pours golden with good clarity and lots of shine.  Fat head of off white foam that lasts well but does not leave lace.  Nose is a perfect clean grain scent with a shy bit of sweetness.  No esters from yeast and no hop scents on the nose. Smells like bread from the bakery.  Admirable.  Taste is good. Creamy body with a slight carbonation. Deep but not rich grain and some a faint sweetness.  The beer finishes clean crisp and with a bit of lemon.  Very very good. Drinks so easily. Too easily."

"Drinkability – A very drinkable beer; I always finish the bottle too quickly. This has become one of my favorite session beers. Definitely the best beer I’ve had from Mexico."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's crisp, light-bodied but not watery, and fairly smooth; all said, pretty refreshing. The grains do keep it from being completely clean."

"Overall - Super clean, lightly sweet, bready malt: light grassy/floral hops: Crisp, effervescent carbonation, light body, smooth. Just a super refreshing, subtle, clean lager. Nothing fancy, but no off notes here to speak of; highly drinkable."

"O - A drinkable beer. Would go good with a spicy dish that requires a lot of drinking! The beer is flavorful."
""
""

"This is a good beer. I drank three of these watching Mexican League Soccer and eating at my local Mexican restaurant, El Toro in Springfield, OH. Fajitas are fantastic and the beer is cold, the football high level. Lot of emotion. This is a good European Lager made in Mexico. Thank Emporer Maximillian for this, he brought the Austrian and German brewers with him long ago. In the bottle there is gold top and silver top. The silver is a dark and tasty brew if you can find it. Good beer."

""

"The best Mexican cheap lager out there for sure. Would pair incredibly well with Mexican food."
""
""

"O: My goto Mexican lager. Drinks easily with enough hoppiness to pair with the spicier dishes."
""
"If you're looking for a North American Pilsener as an alternative to the 'monster brews' flooding the market under the guise of 'IPAs' (or double, triple IPAs) look no further. Bohemia is hoppy and crisp but really blossoms when the cold edge softens. I wouldn't start it at room temp, but it rounds out as it warms up for sure. The mouthfeel is on the light side but the taste packs a nice hoppy punch. It's well balanced too, but definitely hop-forward."

"Highlight here is mouthfeel - very crisp, above-average carbonation while retaining flavor throughout. Very pleasant and almost nothing I'd rather drink on a beach."

"I am by no means and expert but I have been telling and serving people this beer for years. I first came across it in Mc Allen TX and then in Juarez. MX and I was hooked when the served it the 2nd time. I could not believe that a border beer could be this good. So forget all the floral and spicy stuff just sit back sip and enjoy."

"Really a drinkable beer and I'm glad to have had it, but it's nothing to seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
"A foundation of sweet malted grain makes for a nice balance with the spicy hops. Well balanced and has some flavor. Not a bad choice if your looking for a Mexican beer to pair with some spicy food."
""
"O- By far the best Mexican option IMO. A really nice effort on a German Pils. Will be my go to beer when I am eating spicy Mexican food. The sweetness of this beer really suits well with the spice."
""
""
"has recently (2015) become my go-to 'cheap' beer when I don't want to spend more than $25/case .  hits all the right notes in my mouth and won't crunkify you too much even if you have a couple too many ... ( can you say session beer ? )"

"somewhere above the median on the Mexican beer spectrum. the one pours a real light clear watery wheat color, with a short lived white head. the nose is very generic and light, crystal and pale malts, not as pilsener as indicated, but not offensively cornmeal adjuncty like a sol or a corona, although the flavor of this is only mildly better than either of those. it honestly doesn't really taste like much, which is actually an improvement over the metallic and rancid flavors of some of its competition. very crisp finish too without the sweet weirdness. also improved with a lime wedge, as infrequently as I say that, it applies here. ultra light mouthfeel and pretty good carbonation. I would take this over most other Mexican beers ive had, save pacifico. this does not approach a good quality brew, but in a hot summer setting when the alternatives are mich ultra and coronoa light, this is my horse."
""
""
"O: This isn't just good for a Mexican lager - it's a legitimately good beer, period. Merely drinking this makes me think about 78F sunny days laying on the patio without a care in the world. This beer has just given me A) a go-to in Mexican restaurants, B) something to buy for non-beer-drinking guests when hosting a party, and C) something to actually enjoy besides margaritas should I ever end up vacationing in Cabo San Lucas."
""
""
"Overall a solid beer, especially when compared to other Mexican beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste begins with moderate malts and a low to moderate hop bitterness that lingers briefly at the end. I found it to be pretty decent for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I didn't know I would be drinking a pils, but if I had to reach for one at a Mexican restaurant. I would choose this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall about what you would expect from a Mexican beer, it's better than Corona but that's not saying much."
""
"O - A solid mexican beer I gotta say they could have used a little more bitterness and a little bit more hops and a lot more grains but overall it a pretty good beer. Gotta say this is hands down the best mexican beer i've ever had."
"Pours out crystal clear with a nice white head that thins out into a layer of bubbles corralled by very little lacing. The body is a light golden color and is filled with some mild carbonation. Mild wheat and some malts come through, very mild citrus zest as well but not much else-very light floral notes. Its light –to- medium bodied and you can feel the carbonation-Malts and hops are present along with some spices, semi-sweet overall and dry. There is a hint of floral flavors in this one, overall not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice beer, a bit light for my taste and maybe a bit on the simple side. This would be a beer with a good spicy meal though"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a decent example of a german pils, but not on the top of my list. Something i could easily have a 6 pack though on a night of beer drinking. Something to check out if you have a chance, it wont dissapoint, but it wont be something youll write home about either."

"O/D-Better than expected. Blows other Mexi-brews away. Still, far from anything I would by again (as I only purchased a single). But hey, turns out it was worth trying."

"Notes: If I had one suggestion to offer it would be to add some additional hops flavor to more closely match the aroma. Also, it could be more prickly (hops!). That being said, Bohemia is one of the best beers out of Mexico, and among my top 3 choices when eating at a Mexican restaurant. In many ways it's much like a Munich Helles lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a cut above most other standard Mexican lagers and is relatively easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Your better-than-average mexican lager."
"There’s a light crisp flavor to this, sans any expected (hopefully anticipated?) hoppiness. Not much aftertaste either. It finishes clean and clear, unlike my experience with other adjunct lagers. This is what it is and it does what it does. I didn’t expect much and it didn’t disappoint my expectations. You could do a lot worse in a mass-produced import."

"If in Mexico, look only for this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I don't know if this was the result of a dulled palette from drinking flavourless beers on the resort, but this Mexican brew actually boasts some flavourful hop characteristics. Easy drinking and mild enough on the palette to enjoy in the intense Mexican heat. The best option in Mexico IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer overall I tried one in a Mexican restaurant. It goes well with those dishes and has a pretty good taste. I'm more into heavy or darker beer soo this one was just ok. I would try it again if I had the chance depending on the atmosphere I'm in"
""
""
"O - For a Mexican beer Bohemia is a very flavorful choice. Though it does not equal other beers of the Pilsner style it does shine in its environment. I travel to Mexico frequently and in the unrelenting heat of Merida, Bohemia is blessed not so bad sanctuary."
""
""
"My favorite Mexican beer. Pleasantly surprised and I recommend for a hot day or with a nice spicy meal."
""
""
"Lovely beer. Certainly not your typical insepid, skunky, flavorless Mexican brew. Bohemia is a crisp, fresh tasting pilsner. Yes, pilsner. Nice malt and bitter hop balance. A touch of sweetness and a terrific citrusy aftertaste. This has become one of my go to beers. Excellent with food or to quench that desire for a cold brew. If you can find it locally, try it. And please, no lime."

"This is like a muted pilsner - it has all the right elements, but with the volume turned down. Those elements set it apart from a lot of other Mexican beers, but it doesn't measure up so well against other versions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: I like this beer, but I wouldn't try to compare it to the classic German Pilseners, as it would fall far short. As a all malt lager however it does well, and beats out almost every adjunct lager around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don'know if it's because I've been in Mexico for two weeks and limited to a choice between Corona, Dos Equis, or Modelo, but, this Bohemia was like Flamenco Dancers prancing about on my tongue - castanets nipping at my palate. In comparison to beer from Plzen, the Czech Republic, it is more than a respectable effort! Solid in all its attributes...a FINE pilsner! My favorite latino brew to date!"
""
""
""
""
"Nothing special, this does not stand out from a crowded pack. Pass."
"My new favorite Mexican beer aside from Negra Modelo. Pours a cloudy straw gold color. Hops are abundant in the nose. Taste is like that of a German pilsener. Hop bitterness shows its head towards the back of the throat. The beer leaves excellent lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer is also fairly carbonated, and there is a steady stream of bubbles issuing from the bottom of the glass. This and Negra Modelo are my two favorite Mexican beers."
"Overall, this is the best Vienna-Style/Pilsner (whatever you want to call it) Mexico offers. Clean, refreshing, sessionable, versatile enough to match most every flavor profile on our menu, and one that actually has some complexity to it."
"Overall it's a decent, highly drinkable, but not really exceptional beer."
" This is a pretty tasty lager with some malt sweetness and a hint of fruitines with tinges of floral notes from the hops which are pleasant. This has the kind of sweetness that reminds you of adjuncts but doesn't go too far and is nice in relation to the highly carbonated almost spicy profile. I enjoyed this thoroughly and will probably get some for times when I want a refreshing beer or something to scrub the palate when I am enjoying ribs or refried beans. I would recommend this to anyone who happens upon it at their local mexican restaurant like I did."
"This is surprisingly smooth and well blended. This is more than I was expecting."
"Thus far my favorite Mexican lager... we'll see if I can find a better one."
"Very good for a Mexican made Pilsner."
"German Pils? Yeah right! Bohemia's probably a Mexican Adjunct Lager, but a damn good one at that. Will accompany many a carnitas in my future."
"I had this for the first time at a hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised and will drink this each time I enjoy Mexican cousine."
"This pours a clear yellow color with a white head which quickly goes away. The smell is of sweet malt and floral hops. The mouth feel is light and crisp. The taste is good there is a slight sweet taste up front with some hoppy tastes on the way down, very crisp, the bottle I had also has a weird metallic after taste, almost like a Heineken. Overall this beer isn't bad there's just not a whole lot going on. Its not one I'd ever keep at my house, when there's nothing else I love on the menu though, I'll order it."
"Pours a clear yelllow with a 1 inch white head that fades to nothing. Little spots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grain, some grass, and citrus zest. Taste is the same as the smell with the grains and citrus zest being most apparent. This beer has good carbonation and is crisp and clean in the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and one of the better offerings from Mexico in my opinion."
"Nice, bright yellow color with good carbonation. Smells malty with mildly floral hops. The taste is among the best of Mexican beers I've had - a gentle integration of hops and malt, but far more interesting than a Modelo or Corona. As a German Pilsener, it does well for the style, with a thin and refreshing mouthfeel. Overall, this is a beer that complements food very nicely. Recommended!"
"By far my favorite Mexican beer. A good hop bitterness, smell and taste that you enjoy through the entire drink. It has nice malt character and is very easy to drink. Not much head on this beer and what is there disappears very quickly. If you want to barbeque or hang out by the pool this is a great choice. Do not put fruit on this beer! I have to be very adamant about it everytime I order it at a Mexican restaurant. Servers think if it's made in Mexico it gets a lime. If we rated by the price this beer would deserve an A+. Not very expensive."
"Slainte and bueno."
"O: One of my favorite Mexican beers. Most of my favorites are from the Bohemia line in fact. This one is easy drinking with a slight hop presence and a nice malt backbone."
"The smell is good. The taste is unique...a hint of potency, and a hint of sweet. Similar to Negra Modelo, but has its own style for sure. I always look twice in the stores just to make sure I didn't pass it up. I really enjoy Bohemia, there is no doubt about it."
"A decent Pils. Not as robust as many but good stuff from South of the Border."
"Overall - not a bad brew, although I'm not a huge fan of Pilseners."
"Little over a finger of pure, blinding white foam, lacks density and with a good portion of larger bubbles resolves down to the surface rapidly, you get a little residual concentration along the glass sides, the lacing is minimal but not nonexistent. Golden colored liquid of credible depth and solid throughout, even darker when peering down into the glass, the small bubbles well dispersed. Straw, sweet grains and corn make up a good portion of the nose, however, it’s not simple nor obvious, has a fine quality which slowly draws out pepper, orange peel as well as peach, apple, pear scents, not that sweet while also avoiding any bitter greenness. Light-bodied with a steady, refreshing carbonation which scrubs the palate. The orange, lemon citrus plays to this nicely, as does the pepper to light clove spice and pressed flowers. Shade of natural country bread but not yeasty, more crunchy in feel. The apricot, peach, apple fruit close to evanescent. Maybe, just maybe, a dollop of honey. Again, more humbly constructed than simple, just a beer trying to be a beer."
"O: It's been a long time since I've had this beer and I was very pleasantly surprised by it. Quite an enjoyable beverage."
"Pours a straw yellow hue with ample carbonation and a pencil thin soft white head. The smell is crisp and grassy with mild hop presence and a moderate malt backbone. The taste is ver refreshing and quite crisp, with a slight pleasent grassyness and faint hop bitterness. Overall, Im loving this beer."
"I guess after a day mowing the lawn in 90 degree heat it might suffice but I'll pass. NOT offensive but little there."
""
"Overall this is a nice pilsner. Easy to drink and not a bad choice for a session beer"
"For a German Pilsner I felt that this wasn't too bad. With not being a huge fan of Pilsners I wasn't expecting to enjoy this at all. The beer is a moderately good with some good hop and malts on the nose. The Color is a typical yellow with a white white that fades off within a few sips. The mouthfeel is decent with some good carbonation keeping it real and lighter bodied to keep is refreshing. Not too bad of a beer."
"There seems to be a noticeable effort put into this beer that isn't present in most bland Mexican lagers. But it's not enough for me not to lump this in with all the others as uninspiring, insipid swill."
"Translucent gold with a thin layer of foam on the top of your glass in the same fashion some of the European lagers this beer can be associated with, the smell and taste are gentle and perhaps faint for some tastes yet the the sensation is what stads out: It is quite soft as it goes down and it is quite refreshing served cold on an iced pint on a very hot day, and it pretty much goes with any spicy food or meat dish."
"Clear bubbly yellow with a frothy white head that fades fast and leaves descent lace. It smells of floral and fruity hops, hints of citrus and mild biscuit malts. Very mild with nice touch of floral hops. Very mild and medium bodied. Very easy to drink, but just above average."
"Thin white head. Sickly pale straw body. Corn and nut smell. Tastes, in order of intensity, like Crayon, tobacco, and wet paper. Not refreshing in any way. The flavors are not pleasant. Perhaps I just got a bad bottle. I'll give it another shot some day because I really feel this is very unenjoyable. The first thing that came to my mind was ""Is this just supposed to be the style?"""
"Regular company for my ""normal"" day food."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2001): Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours medium yellow with small bubbly white head, nicely chasing bubbles. Nose is sharp clean hops and slightly acrid malt. The flavor begins with a mild vegetal hops bite that segues into a slightly acrid bitterness. Rather thin mouthfeel. Not a bad beer at all."
"This is a nice pilsener-style beer from Mexico which pours a nice golden straw color that you can easily see through. The head vanished pretty quickly. Very slight fruity aroma, with a very clean taste. I enjoyed it, and will even buy it again. An extremely drinkable beer."
"RJT"
"D: Very tasty, and much better than a Corona or Dos Equis. Definitely a very drinkable beer. I would buy this again, most likely to pair with Mexican food."
"D: avg beer taste, nothing special. tasted much better ice cold, but again nothing special"
"D: Taste didn't improve with warmth, would probably go great with mexican food."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer. I would love this for barbecues. Holds up nice and easy to drink. A great all around social beer."
"Drinkability: This is an incredibly drinkable beer. It goes down easy. I think it is one of the best Mexican beers and I really appreciate it doing a good job in the Czech style. I will buy it for hanging out or for washing down dinner."
"This beer is probally one of the most fine beers of all of mexico. when you go to mexico, locals dont drink corona ..etc .. they drink bohemia and indio .. these are from the finest brewery in mexico. Ive had the opportunity to tour the facility and it is exceptional and i urge you to try this beer !!"
"Drinkability: It could definitely be a session beer, though I wouldn't want it to be my session beer. As usual, I'm glad I tried it, though it wouldn't end up in my crate."
"Pours with a clear golden straw color and a thin white head that vanishes quickly after the pour. There is no lacing happening at all. Smell is good. Lots of earth tones Picking up floral hops and grainy malts smells a little bit bitter. Reminds me up apple juice. Maybe semi sweet white wine and club soda considering the high carbonation. Although in between these flavors there's floral earthy notes. It goes from sweet to earthy and then finishes a bitter clean and dry. This is quite drinkable. The flavors are balanced well. No flavor is too overpowering. ABV is low. This is a good session for me. This is one of my go to beers when there isnt anything better. Every now and then ill pick up a six pack if i dont feel like going out of my way to my local beer store."
"Drinkability - I was happily surprised by this beer. Not bad at all. This beer would be perfect for Summer in my opiniion. A thirst quencher. It left the glass very quickly and I found myself wanting another. The apppearance was the only thing that hurt the score because of the lack of head and head retention. Cool little bottle too!!!!"
"This beer has a champagne clean look with a nice bubbly carbonation. Medium head w/med. retention. A citrus smell orange, lemon or both. Taste is good kind of a fuzzy orange. Feels good while drinking and nice and lively. Slight aftertaste. I prefer this beer cold and would drink it in hot or cold weather."
"Pleasantly surprised with this. Up until tonight, I thought Negra Modelo was the best Mexican macro beer. I found a better one."
"Wasn't expecting this beer to be especially good, but it's a step above the standard Mexican lagers. Quite tasty, pairs well with food, but you could enjoy it alone too."
"Clear golden with a dense white head that leaves some decent looking lace on the glass. Slightly above average aroma with untoasted grain, mild noble hops and a faint soapiness. Pretty damn good for a Mexican Pils, creamy and mildly bready with brash hop flavor that sets this apart from standard Mexican fare, must be the dark brown bottle. Smooth and medium bodied with soft carbonation. A nice beer to wash down some enchiladas for sure."
"Not a bad drinkable beer, but not something I'd stick with for an evening."
"Golden color, nice head after the pour with thin retention. The smell is fresh, clean, fruit, vanilla. The flavor is good, solid, and refreshing. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation is thin but has the right amount of sharpness. I get vanilla and clean light fruit flavors, and it is true its German heritage. But for all it's strengths, it lacks something vital in the aftertaste department. Yup, that's it: the problem is a bit of papery flavor and a slightly chalky, dry aftertaste. It's like they added some stale hops to an otherwise great beer. It tastes good, but then lets you down a bit in the end. Good beer, not great beer."
"This is a good session lager that also contains some good flavor. It is very easy to drink. There is not a lingering aftertaste or real bitterness. It is neutral in that respect. I'd think of it as a weak IPA."
"M/D: average mouthfeel, a bit lighter body than I wanted. The drink-ability is good. But I'll only have one of these with some Mexican food or perhaps a day at the beach."
"I would drink it again for sure."
"Cool bottle. Forgettable contents."
"This is a good Mexican beer and a nice example of a German pilsener. I will have no trouble finishing the other 5 bottles."
"As far as beer I can find at Mexican restaurants, I would definitely order this again. It went great with my meal and was very refreshing."
"Drinkability: A crisp, highly drinkable lager with just enough class to be interesting."
"D: Good drinkability, but heavy enough that you aren't going to down 4 of these in a row - and that isn't the point. For a beer you would pair with a meal, this is as good as it needs to be."
"D- A pretty drinkable pilsner. Near the upper end of mexican beers."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. Better than most Mexican beers out there. I definitely recommend it if you're at a local Mexican joint and want a cerveza to accompany your meal. It's full enough to have with a meal, yet light enough to drink quite a few of. Skip the Sols and Tecates and Coronas, and have a Bohemia instead."
"Overall, this is one excellent Mexican beer, my favorite out of the country by far."
"For the style (which I'm not a big fan of I must say), this is not terribly bad."
"Drinkability - I like it. It has a good flavor for the type of beer it is."
"Overall it washed down the spicy mexican cuisine fairly good and it was hot and humid so it was a nice thirst quencher. So technically it did it's job."
"Poured a golden yellow with a light foamy head that dissipated quickly. Bready, light malty aroma, nothing noteworthy. Smooth malty feel and flavor, maybe some breaady flavors with a very faint citrusy finish. Easy to drink but certainly nothing spectacular. If you're looking for Mexican brew it's a nice change from Corona."
"Okay representation of the style goes well with Mexican food."
"d - Went well with Mexican food, and I prefer it to something like Corona, but not something I would go for at the store."
"You don't usually taste any hops in these beers, but they are present in Bohemia."
"D: Quite a good, refreshing brew, which was very surprising since I'm not usually a fan of Mexican beers. It was definitely the best part of an otherwise lackluster dinner (some type of combination pork dish, if I remember correctly) that I had at Matador Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix, AZ."
"pours a clear golden color one finger foamy white head that disappeared almost as soon as it was poured with no lace. clean smell of fruit and grain. corn and malt taste slight hop note dry light mouth feel carbonation was ok. claims of roasted barley cocoa like bitterness and hints of vanilla were not there as claimed on the cardboard carrier not something i would buy again."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear pale golden color with a short white big bubbled head that quickly goes into a thin ring with no lacing. Very grainy aroma with a bit of hops too. Tangy flavor up front and a sweetish finish. This so far is my favorite Mexican beer in this style. Very drinkable and a good session beer."
"Day 12 , This one is a treat like its darker brother Obscura, it has a good deal of flavor and that nice thick foamy goodness,mmm. You dont see much of a head on to many beers down here, this one is nice tastes of light hops, corn and should be drank ice cold they tell me.I had 2 with my Pascada (Fish) and they went very well together."
"Best Mexican beer I've had, even though it's a distinctly German-style brew. Or Vienna. Or whatever it is."
"D- Easy to drink, great for quick consumption, very safe for any food situation"
"cheers!!"
"12oz bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a crystal-clear straw-yellow body with a quarter inch of short-lived head. Biscuit and caramel malts and a touch of hops comprise the very hard-to-detect aroma. Biscuit with a touch of caramel, a slight cooked corn flavor, and just a hint of hops hits the palate initially, but goes away rather suddenly. Aqueous with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Inoffensive and quaffable, definitely good for a hot day, as it goes down easy and is thirst-quenching. Not sure I'd classify it as a German Pils, since it doesn't quite have the hop presence for it, but as a Bohemian Pils or even and American one, this one passes with flying colors."
"A great German Style Beer that goes amazingly well with Mexican Food especially with a bit of spice in it. It is not too strong nor too light, just perfect and has a nice smooth hoppy flavour and satifies well. I also love the appereance with its dark brown bottle and golden wrapper. A favourite of mine."
"Drinkability: Very light, easy drinking Pilsner. Not very exciting, but it does what it does quite well. Could drink a lot of these."
"Overall ehh. It was not terrible, but was really rather lackluster. I did not have a huge issue with it per se, but I needed more. For a macro like lager though it came off fairly well."
"Drink this beer staight from the bottle. It was not intended to be poured into a glass. Also, do not add lime or salt to it. That will ruin it. Drink it right from the bottle, and you will get the Vienna-style goodness that these guys intended you to get. A very worthy brew."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"This beer pours a mildly hazy pale golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of pale malt, caramel, and a hint of noble hops. The taste is like the aroma, but a bit milder. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer that I could drink in a pinch, but would otherwise."
"Bohemia Clasica was a clear yellow color with a tiny white head that disappear as soon a possible. The aroma was a sweet, grainy smell. The taste was a light lemony, grassy flavor. A pretty good balance between malt and hops. The mouth feel was medium bodied with little carbonation. The drinkability was good; ABV, taste and price all reasonable. This was the best beer that I've ever had out of Mexico, which is not saying much, unfortunately."
"A clear pale yellow color with a one finger short lasting fizzy white head , no lacing , medium carbonation. Aroma is light toasted grain and a bit of floral hops , with a hint of lemon zest . Flavor is lightly sweet , a faint bitterness and some light floral hop notes , short hoppy finish much like a Euro lager . Quite sessionable I would guess ( I am only trying one ) Nothing wrong with this beer , just very average in all aspects , meah >"
"Very quaffable beverage. Nice initial crisp flavor with an a nice subtle bite. Hint of honey, and the toasted grains are present, with an almost ""invisible"" floral aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, and when poured doesn't get too much head. The smell is grainy and malty, but after letting the beer breathe, more scents come through, slightly citrusy. One of the better beers Mexico has to offer."
"This is one of those beers that give off a bad first impression, but then, the magic shines. Smell is a balanced hoppiness with some bready malts. We can also add some vanilla and fruitiness when it comes to taste. Mouthfeel is very crisp, and it is a very sessionable beer. One of my favourite Mexican beers"
"D: The highlight of the night, a clean pils that doesn't shy away from the hops."
"This is a very drinkable beer. One of the better Mexican beers out there and one that I will purchase in the future."
"Drinkability- It's ok when drinking it while eating mexican food but it's not really my type of beer."
"The mouthfeel seems right for a lager, not too heavy or thin. I can drink this all night long. My favorite Mexican beer."
"It could be cleaner, but I have to say this one caught me off guard. Well done."
"Whatever the complexities, they play nice throughout the bottle. Amounts to good drinkability. This is a favorite with Mexican food, along with Negra Modelo."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is of malts, somewhat sweet. Taste is also sweet, malts with some hops, rather refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fairly decent brew."
"The palest of gold colors did this beer emit. The head was was white and pillowy. The aroma was very light exuding mostly malty notes with some ""off"" signals. On the palate, this particular ice-cold specimen, had little to offer. A bland malty profile finished off by an even blander hop offering. I didn't not find any of the flavors to be off-putting, but I felt that it was watered-down."
"D: The best mexican pilsener and accompanies very well every meal."
"nicely drinkable, a well made mass produced beer."
"I'd never have this to have it in US, but I would recommend searching this out in Mexico."
"D-Even with the fuller flavor, the beer still seems refreshing and highly drinkable, even compared to its lighter Mexican bretheren."
"It is crisp on the pallet and the head is thin like most lagers."
"bought a single of this one pour a golden brown color with a thin head a little lacing i smell malt and grass and some hops..the taste is crisp and malty a little hops some spices i dont know..overall its a thin mouth feel not real robust but ok and easy to drink ill try this one again when at a Mexican restaurant instead of a modelo or dos equis"
"This is an extremely drinkable lager, outclassing Corona by leaps and bounds. Drinking several of these on a hot summer day, or with some spicy south of the border fare would be easy and very enjoyable."
"(Bottle poured into pint glass) A rather drinkable beer, a little more body than the old standby Corona. Color was amber to golden, but the taste was a tad watered down from what I was expecting given the color. A suitable choice, great compliment to my spicy dinner. Not sure why some servers think there is a need to add lime to ALL Mexican beers though!"
"This was a very very nice surprise....I was expecting a typical macro brew but this was really quite surprising and is probably my new favorite Mexican brew..."
"pretty good but not one that you would have a craving for.i'd definitely drink it again"
"Has a pale gold appearance. Pours with a moderate head that quickly dissipates. Has a faint but agreeable hops aroma. Taste is actually very good, with malt character and a restrained hops presence. Good mouthfeel, with nice carbonation. I think this is a surprisingly good beer, and very drinkable. Also, some extra credit for a really attractive bottle. Distinctive squat brown with gold foil, and a warrior in full headress. One of my favorites."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is crisp. The body of the beer is light and the finish is light. Everything about this beer is right on the mark for a German pils."
"D - A decent beer for what it is. Smooth, light, and drinkable, certainly better than a lot of the macros out there. Not my first choice, but far from the worst."
"D- it would probably be pretty easy to throw back a few of these after a long day but I don't know I'd want to. I'm just not very impressed with this brew."
"I'll take this brew over a Corona on Cinco De Mayo everytime."
"Pours a clear golden with a medium white head. Smells slightly of grain. Taste is malty, with a hint of fresh corn. A hint of saltyness as well. Finish is sweet with a nice floral hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is average, high carbonation. Drinkability is good, refreshing, but good flavor. One of the best mexican lagers I've had."
"D - this is a beer that i will return too often. my wife cooks a lot of el salvadorian food, and this will pair perfectly. it doesn't get disgusting at warmer temps (like most of it's Mexican peers), which is nice. It's a sold mexican brew, great for summer, or paired with hispanic cuisine. not quite as full flavored as i hoped, but goes down effortlessly."
"D- A decent brew that makes for an ok session beer."
"D: Very nice lighter beer, could drink this for days."
"Mild texture with a light feel just like a good pils. Flavor has good substance, and the beer is incredibly refreshing. If you can't drink the water, this is the best option."
"Overall an excellent beer for nice days outdoors."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Typical pale straw gold color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is faint grains and corn. Flavor is actually not too bad. Grainy, low on the awful corn syrup flavor that most pale lagers have, might even be a touch of hops with a light fruity note. Thin and refreshing, definitely the best choice if you're at a taqueria."
"Overall it was ok, I would drink it again but, I don't think I would recommend since there a better pilsners out there."
"D: A good beer with spicy foods. One of the better Mexican beers out there."
"So many beers in the macro market make puny attempts to brew Pilsners, and end up with cheap imitations. Bohemia nailed it just right. It is a very nice beer, and I highly recommend it, whether you're pairing with some food or just cooling yourself in a hot day."
"D- very drinkable- this could be a great session beer"
"Drinkability is extremely high. This is a quality pils, and it beats the shit out of most other Mexican beers. I could definitely see myself buying a sixer (only $7.99, which is damn good) to consume on a hot-ass summer day."
"pour is golden yellow, almost a mild green. with a smell white head. nose is a neutral bitter hops and apple honey. pretty much the taste too. i didn't know i the quality are that much different but the 'mexican pilz' seems to be a bit more malt oriented that the german. but not malt forward the same time. i did get a solid lilac floral quality though."
"Deceiving in its name, which suggests Pilsner status, and mislabeled as a German Pils, this bright, rich, malty brew sits firmly in amongst some of the better Helles lagers out there. Along with the Vienna and Dunkel lagers brewed by Dos Equis and Modelo, this addition to Mexican brewing fits in well with those brews of Germanic origins, and is a nice throwback to the brews of the Austrian immigrants who once took their places in Mexico, as well as a great, refreshing and flavorful quaff for Cinco de Mayo."
"overall i think this will might be my go to beer at mexican restaurants but i need to try more"
"all in all, this one is pleasantly drinkable and surprisingly enjoyable. I didn't have high hopes, but this one far surpasses. flavors and aroma are beautiful. If only there was a bit more character to the hue and any hint of lacing... but all in all, not a bad brew at all."
"In a pinch this could be my pils fix."
"Drinkable only in the sense that it really doesn't taste like much. This beer almost has to be drank with something else as there is little flavor. Only a dedicated Bud drinker would consider this a ""clasica"" import."
"I could drink quite a few of these, lots of flavor for a macro, and pairs well with spicy food. Good beer, I was pleasantly surprised."
"Conclusion: very nice beer for a macro. Beats the piss outta Corona or Tecate, that's for sure. I will order this at any Mexican restaurant or the next time I'm on vacation in the beautiful county of Mexico. Ole!"
"It's not a bad example of the style, and I will probably try it again. I just can't see keeping it on hand."
"D - A very enjoyable cerveza. Certainly nothing to get excited about, but it's hands-down the best of the Mexican beers. This is always my first pick when I go out to a Mexican restaurant with a mediocre beer selection."
"Would go excellent with spicy food."
"An excellent beer. Could pound it all day. Good balance and the fact this beer isn't heavy make this a good choice. This is and Negra Modelo are my favorite Mexican beers. Unless I go to Guadalajara where everybody drinks Estrella - then I gotta say what everybody says ""Aqui Estrella es la cerveza que rifa!"""
"This is a good beer worth trying and drinking on hot days or pairing with the above mentioned food."
"I forgot how much I paid for this, but if its cheap, I could see myself drinking some of these on a hot summer day."
"My favorite Mexican beer by far. If you have this and Negra Modelo available, you can pretty much skip the other common Mexican beers."
"This beer poured yellow with a thin head and a decent amount of visible carbonation. The smell is sweet malt with a tiny bit of hops. The taste is sweet malt with a bit of graininess and that gives way to a pretty small amount of hops and clean finish. The mouthfeel is a pretty watery with a decent amount of carbonation. Where this beer excels is in drinkability, and it is a particularly good companion to spicy food."
"This is a real treat from Mexico. I do believe this is the best export our neighbors to the south have to offer."
"Atmosphere is okay. Not a bad flavor, feel leaves a little to be desired. Pretty good drinkability, though. Serviceable quaff."
"Drinkability is quite good."
"Drinkability: Great with mexican food; although I prefer Dos Equis Amber"
" Medium mouthfeel and moderate carbonation make this extremely drinkable. No bitter bites or off flavors. Terrific rep of the style. I'll be getting this again, probably more for the summer."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a small bubbly white head that left little lacing. Aroma of husky grains a nice floral hoppiness. Flavor has a nice hop bite at the beginning, grassy, lightly sweet pale malts in the middle and finishes bone dry. I was quite impressed with the hop flavor coming from a Mexican beer. Light to medium bodied, crisp clean finish. This was a pretty good beer and quite drinkable. Probably the best beer you'll find from south of the border."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. No head, no retention, and no lacing. Smells of a clean lager without the strong adjunct aroma. At this point I became intrigued. Doesn't really seem to fit the style with the lack of hops or head, but it does have the slightly fruity aroma. It's crisp and smooth with low carbonation. Tastes of a clean lager without the strong adjunct association. Some of the flavor is masked by the fruitiness. Overall, very drinkable despite the initial appearance. Worth a try."
"Taste: Taste is similarly hoppy with the taste of oranges."
"Notes from 11/30/04"
"Very unimpressive beer. No real body to it. Pours clear brown with a short-lived off-white head. Moderate lacing. Grainy, straw aroma with a handful of corn. Watery, bubbly mouthfeel. More hay and grain in the taste, and a metallic aftertaste. Bland."
"Notes:For a beer so mass produced it was pretty good."
"D- Very high"
"D- This has just enough citrus spice to cut through mexican food. Definitely a top choice at local Mexican joints."
"D - This is a pretty good vienna lager. Really one of the best commonly available Mexican beers."
"You must seek this beer out! You cannot go wrong with this beer."
"Of the readily available German style pilseners in my neck of the woods, this one is certainly right up there as a first choice."
"A pretty good beer from Mexico. Definitely better than most beers widely available here in the states. You can trace its European ancestry with its use of hops and malted barley. However, neither is very prominent, as the beer is medium-light in taste and profile. It fits very well with Mexican food. Another thing of note is that if the beer is made with the use of adjuncts (corn or rice), it is done with a rather deft hand, as it does not taste like it. Again, the taste is of a pleasant light maltiness with subdued influences from the hops on the finish. Good food beer. I could put quite a few of these away."
"I was very surprised by this and I'm glad. I always saw these Mexican beers at the store and figured they were all Corona-type ones, but this is a solid beer for sure. Nice attractive look to it with some good ascending bubbles. Taste is mild but crisp and refreshing. There's a lot more taste than you would expect from the appearance which is good. A nice solid beer, would have it again in a pinch."
"D: I'm still searching for a good beer from a Latin American country. This isn't one of them. It's a pretty ordinary brew all around."
"I don't generally drink Mexican beers, and this was the first time I tried this brand and beer. I was quite surprised at how pleasant it was. This seemed like a light lager by appearance and taste, though the head was a little lacking. Consequently, the body was found to be light, yet the beer was flavorful, with a nice, almost malty, finish. The mouthfeel was similar to what one would find in most of the American large brew beers. Very drinkable and enjoyable!"
"This is a very good Mexican Lager. Blows almost everything else I have had from that country away as far as beer goes."
"Drinkablity: Very tasty. Interesting balance between hops and malt results in a very refreshing beer."
"D - this was a very enjoyable beer. It's drinkable yet complex enough to make you pay attention as you drink it. the faint sweetness tempts you to figure out what you are tasting. You can also just relax and put a few away because it's light and smooth. Another example of not judging a book by it's cover."
"A solid Mexican beer. Wrapped in foil, like champagne, in a short stocky bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Not much to the appearance, or the aroma, a little grainy I guess. The rest is better though. Very smooth, refreshing and light-bodied. Semi-sweet notes with a little more flavor than others of the same category. I must say this goes quite well with Mexican food and they are very easy to drink."
"My absolute favorite Mexican beer! The pour is a nice medium gold color that leaves great lace on the glass. The smell has slight citrus notes with a crisp malt scent that is very inviting. Flavor is out of the park with a nice mild hop bite in the front followed by a excelent subtle malt sweetness mixed with perfect carbonation levels in the finish. Perfect pairing with any spicy food or if you need a refreshing beverage on a warm day, look no further!"
"D: Very high, this is a session beer"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Great carbonation and a sweet hoppy bitterness. I will drink this one again."
"brewed by the same brewer as Tecate, my favorite beer, so i had to try it. similar to negra modelo, which i feel is better, but thats just me. this is also a great beer, if the didn't have negra modelo i would probably pick this up. i would recommend this to anyone who likes to explore new beers"
"This is quite a good Mexican beer. I don't know if I'd call it my favorite, but it's definately in my upper echelon with respect to what's available. There isn't really any type of flavor that sticks out too much, but it goes down very easily and would make a GREAT companion on a hot day. Try it if you haven't already."
"There's something about this beer, maybe it reminds of the days of seeing who could pound the most beers, but this is a lot better than the beers we used to pound (shudder). If I were to go to a Mexican restaurant, this would be my first choice at this time."
"This beer is unlike any other, for one. It has a vanilla/pilsner feel to it. I think I could actually sip on this beer all day and not get sick of it. Slightly pale and a very pleasing aroma. Maintains flavor throughout the bottle. Definetley one to remember"
"Pretty nice little vienna. Bonus points for being probably the best brew from Mexico that I have tried. Great summer/beach/anytime sessioner."
"Had this at a Mexican restaurant in Kittery. Pale yellow color with a very small head. Poured the second bottle more aggressively, still a small head. Little aroma, some sweet corn. The taste was faint malt with a tiny hops presence. Thin mouthfeel. It did, however, pair well with my enchiladas verde."
"Overall a refreshing pilsner. Due to the cornyness, I'd call the beer a Classic American Pilsner rather than a Vienna Lager. More hop aroma and flavor would help adjust the balance and increase this beer's drinkability. I'd finish my first pint but probably move on to a different beer for number 2."
"D - Goes fine with most Mex food but not my first choice."
"thers nothing speichal about this one, its golden and smels of corn with verry little hops, this one is comparable to budwiser. this is middle of the road for taste, and watery. its not the worst thing i've had and its no ware close to the top of my list. its just average."
"Not bad..."
"D: Quite a good Mexican beer at a Mexican restaurant, would defintely have again if I was in that situation."
"D-This is a winner. An enjoyable lighter colored beer from Mexico. Would seem to pair nicely with spicy foods...not the worlds greatest Bohemian Pilsner but this is good."
"One Mexican I hadn't tried, so I ordered one with my combo plate at the new Plazuelas restaurant in E-Burg. What a pleasant surprise. Nice pale color in the glass, with quite a bit of white foam that lasted for the first few sips. Icould tell from the pour that the mouthfeel (body, carbonation) would be better than I expected. Not much smell to speak of (though perhaps that is a good thing sometimes). Taste was, up front, malt... with a hint of floral hops. No off-tastes, no metallic or adjunct flavors to speak of; just a very nice, refreshing beer with a tiny bit of hops bitterness at the end of the swallor to keep you wanting to raise the glass. Great change of pace from the usual Mexican beers--and the food was good too. Nice all the way around."
"Taste is lightly malty-sweet and a little spicy with herbal, grassy hops and a nice bitter finish. Tiny lingering syrupy sweetness, otherwise nice and clean, crisp and refreshing, with drinkability unequaled by anything else I've enjoyed from south of the border."
"Poured an insanely clear straw golden color with a foamy light head that hung around for a minute or 2. The aroma is clean and malty, lightly fruity with a hint of hops. The taste is so much cleaner than I would have expected from a shitty mexican brewery. The hops don't play a big part here but from what you can taste its nice. The graininess and malty sweetness dominates. There is a corny hint to it which bothers me a tad. Decent bitterness. Light in the feel but not too bad. If i were eating mexican food and had to have a mexican beer it would certainly be this. I would do a few of this but the grain and corny sweetness might get obnoxious."
"Conclusion: While I was at dinner in Old Town, I wanted to taste something new. I had never heard of this brew when I saw it on the menu, I had to see if it was any good -- most major Mexican brewers have disappointed. But this one blew my socks off. It was actually good and worth the price of admission. It was so good that even the wife like it and recommended I pick up some at a later date. Nice brew. Definitely recommended!"
"M/D - Light bodied and very crisp. A very refreshing beer and very drinkable."
"D-this was a nice suprise,I will be having this again soon,paired with fajitas these would go down easier than a ten dollar w#@*e"
"Drinkability: An easy drinking beer. I could session with this. Had one previous to review with with some lightly spicy Mexican food, it paired nicely with it. If I have to have a Mexican beer, this one (while not my first or second choice) would do in a pinch. Seems macro lagerish, but is just a step above. Yet, its not quite a full on Vienna Lager IMO. Not sure where to go with this."
"Pours a clear straw color with a small diappointing head, also there are some unidentifiable objects floating around. The aroma is faint but does have some slight notes of maltiness. The taste is of bready malt and not much else. It's not grainy or adjuncty, just bland. The feel is light and nicely carbonated, finishes neutral. Drinkability is good, no off-putting flavors. Bland for the most part, just a hint of malt. I believe this brew has its place. It good for when you want something light and you don't need to serve it ice cold to drink it."
"D: Perfect with spicy food. I will order this one again. Hopefully I'll be able to track it down on tap."
"Drinkability: When surrounded by Mexican lagers, it would be certainly be more desirable than say, a Corona Light. Surely it would go great with Combo #14, 8, and 12 at your local Mexican eatery."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a nice beer to have with any Mexican dish, like my Sante Fe burrito, or just for drinks with some of your amigos. Negra Modelo is still superior, in my mind, but Bohemia is a good call too."
"Crystal clear, bright yellow with small white head that dissipated quickly. Not much noticeable carbonation bubbling. Really no detectable aroma. A little sweet malt taste initially with a little hop finish. Very crisp and refreshing. Nice summer brew after mowing the lawn on a hot day. Light/medium carbonation and body. Very drinkable."
"I've had only three Mexican beers in my life. The first two were Corona and Dos Equis; Bohemia is by far the best of the three."
"It does have the overly carbonated mouthfeel endemic to south of the border breweries, however."
"Overall- OK, I was out to eat with my g/f and I asked for a Sweetwater and they brought me a Dasini...so I was forced to stray from the Corona, Corona Light, and XX. It wasn't too bad though."
"This is one of the better Mexican lagers out there. It poured lighter than one would expect from the style, but it was a slightly darker shade of straw than most macro lagers. It had a pretty typical ""beer"" smell, that is to say some malt, adjunct, and a touch of skunk, but it was pleasing. The taste was surprising. While there were corn adjuncts floating around in the background, it had a pleasing light malt taste, with a very mild, but actually present hop profile. It went down easy and I was ready for another. This might now be my go to Mexican beer."
"D: This would make for a great beach type beer and was moderately good."
"Pours a clear light yellow with foamy head. Little retention and spotty lacing. Smell: spicy hopping with a sweet toasted malt graininess. Taste: sweet graininess, hints of white grape juice / white nectarine. Spicy and mildly earthy hopping. Balanced. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. Great session beer from Mexico."
"Pours out a polished brass with little head that doesn't have very good retention. Smells of bready, crackery malts with a hint of graininess. Sweetish honey aroma. Lots of floral hops in the nose. Malt is rather light and unobtrusive in the flavor, but makes way for a bright fruitiness and loads of jasmine. Tastes almost like a mix of a helles lager and some iced jasmine tea. Just a touch of bitterness in the finish (slightly more than, say, a Coors Banquet). Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Excellent drinkability. Refreshing and full of my favorite kind of hop presence: a floral one. Best Mexican beer I've ever had, for sure. Does not need a lime."
"This is a pleasant surprise from Mexico. Sure beats the other Mexican beers of the same/similar style that I've had (by far). A good example of a Vienna Lager. I would say I liked it a bit more than the score reflects. A good brew to pair with Mexican (or any spicy) food, or as a ""session"" brew on its own."
"Overall this one and Negra modelo are my favorite beers to drink. They are very good beers, tried this one for the first time in Quero Terro Mexico, in 2002. I was at a little pub enjoying some acoustic music. This was the most expensive beer they had at a dollar fifty."
"I had this beer at a Mexican restaurant. It really went well with my spicy beef burrito. It poured out with very little head, but plenty of carbonation. It wasn't overly hoppy, but there was something about it that worked perfectly with spicy food. It also wasn't too heavy, which made it good for a dinner beer. Not a bad session beer, but not something i would go out of the way for either."
"Drinkability was pretty high, cause it's like sugar water with a touch of booze, very neutral. Washed down a big ol' burrito like nobody's business."
"Uno cervesa es muy bueno! My personal favorite bottles brew from Mexico. Nice 1/2"" head when poured, setttles into an attractive lacing, smooth over the palate, nice pale amber hue, hints of vanilla and honey. NO BS & NO lime wedge needed here. DON""T FRUIT THE BEER!"
"D - Nice and smooth with a slight hop bite...wonderful for a Mexican macro. Certainly the only beer I actually look for when in the country! One has to put what you are drinking into perspective."
"Drinkability - Different, but not a good different. I would turn down another of these. I'm pretty sure, also, that this is not a Vienna Lager probably a Pilsner."
"Could drink a lot of these if scarfing down some rice and beans along with it"
"I had this before I became a beer connisseur and thought this wasn't bad. Had it again recently and I can't say that I was impressed. Better than most Mexican-brewed beer which is usually similar to a US-macro. More hops evident than in the usual standard Mexican fare. Pretty smooth and drinkable, but no real distinguishable characteristic. Not offensive."
"I recently vacationed in Mexico and while I'd had this beer before in the US, I don't recall it being as tasty as I found it in Mexico! The beer poured a pleasant amber color with a lot of carbonation in the mouthfeel. There was a rather mild but nonetheless pleasing sweet maltiness in the beer, but not a discernible hop presence. This and Modelo Especial were the two beers I consumed most during my Mexican vacation."
"Overall, Bohemia was a surprise for me. I ordered it randomly at a Mexican restaurant, thinking it would be the usual Mexican beer, but for me it is probably the best beer I have had coming from south of the border."
"Paired two of these with a ""Puerco en Mole"" dish."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent representation of style, I could drink a few of these but I think it would be better with food and there are better beers in the style."
"Slight hop aroma, but nice hop flavor. Didn't quite expect it, but I'd say it is like a Sam Adams of Mexico. I didn't think they used hops for flavor in Mexico, but apparently they do. Nice citrusy flavor that would go great with any Mexican meal. It is very clear with a small head, but some lacing. Overall, a great beer for a warm day."
"D - Good with Mexican cuisine or when baking yourself out by the pool. Not very interesting, but worlds better than any other Mexican lager I've had."
"Bought this one in Cozumel, Mexico at a street vendor. I wasn't expecting much out of any mexican beer, but this one ended up being rather decent. The smell and flavor was what made it good for me. Although it was thin and fizzy, like all hot weather beers seem to be, it had an all-malt taste. It almost had a hint of caramel in it as it went down. It was short-lived after the watery taste bled through, but it was better than drinking more corona or a sugar-filled daquari."
"Oh, and if you're ever in a Mexican bordertown, stay away from the nachos. Eeesh."
"I added a lime to give it a little extra zing, and this really worked."
"The best beer I've found in Cancun, it even has bitterness. I don't know about the vienna lager label on BA. This looks and tastes like a pilsner, say, one from Bohemia. It also reminded me of a less bold version of the Sly Fox Pils. It has a slightly bready flavor with grassy and floral hops. Drinks very crisp and it great for washing down food or just relaxing. Two bottles of this helped me put down 27 jumbo shrimp. Any beer that can do that and taste good is alright in my eyes. Not the best pils, but its in a brown bottle and a good choice is vacationing in Mexico"
"One of the better Mexican beers, but still, nothing to rave about. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a clear yellow, forming a thin 1 inch head, with lots of carbonation. Thin rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is slightly skunky, along with a little corn smell. The taste isnt bad, but its not really good either. Very little flavor, mostly a slight grain flavor, but mostly just like water. Light mouthfeel. Overall, not bad, but this isnt a beer I would drink more than one of."
"Tastes alright, fairly simple and light. Best as food accompaniment, I used chips and salsa. This brew goes well with spicy food. Becomes hard to drink when it starts warming though."
"This was the first beer from a 12-beer sampler pack assembled by my (awesome) father in law as a birthday gift from the Blue Max (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1287/?view=beerfly). Many obscure, enticing porters and pub ales to explore. I'm glad this one is out of the way."
"An average Mexican lager: average all around. Could be a bit tastier, but for this type of beer it's perfectly acceptable. Not something I'd seek out, but not something I'd reject."
"It's a pale straw color, that pours a nice head, but shrinks considerably after a minute. It has a a nice hop aroma that doesn't leave you gasping for air with caramel notes in the back. The beer's slightly sweet, with a hoppy profile, but not bitter. It's very refreshing and easy to drink, making it a good choice when one is thirsty and doesn't want to drink water. Remember, this is a Mexican beer that's built for easy comsumption. But more importantly, it tastes pretty darn good, and that characteristic puts it above other Mexi-Lagers."
"Drinkability: There's not much going on in this one, but what is present is a flavor that I'll be happy to pass on next time I see it."
"A clean,light mouthfeel,pleasing and refreshing,very drinkable.A good Mexican session beer very enjoyable citrus bite really adds to drinkability. A forum post said this was the Best Mexician beer, made me give it a try. I'd have to agree with this."
"D: Not my favorite Mexican lager but not bad. The lime helped."
"with my only other mexican beer expierence being corona and dos equis. i found this beer to be nicely suprising. pours a very lear light gold. tons of bubbles, looks refreshing. the smell is a cross between grainyness with slight hops and spicy grass. overall pleasnt. very nice taste, touch of hop flavor, no offensive tones. goes down real smooth for little aftertaste. could definitly see drinking a few of these. definitly my favorite mexican beer."
"Actually a nicely quaffable little brew. Really surprisingly good."
"This beer pours a golden color that is akin to urine with no darkness or haze to it. The smell is unfortunately the same, with just a hint of wheat behind it. The taste is very light, much like an American macro-lager. A bit of carbonation as well keeps this beer from lingering on the tongue too long, but still is not able to get the taste down in enough time. I imagine the only reason youd drink this beer is if you were in Mexico and you wanted some local flavor, but its definitely not something youd seek out otherwise."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with very little head and it vanishes quickly. Smells like a beer, tastes like a beer. Not really bad, and better than a lot of brews I've had of late. Well-balanced and easy drinking, I could easily put a few of these away."
"All and all, not a bad brew. Could whack quite a few back. Would make a decent session brew.This is a good beer for the masses. While not what I would expect in a Vienna Lager, this is a decent beer."
"Overall. One of only a small handful of mexican beers i like to drink. No big frills here, but is good enough to enjoy with mexican, or even a six pack at home."
"This brew pours to a light yellow color with a small white head that breaks down quickly leaving a slight film on the top. The aroma is sweet with some actual hops that is noticeable. Also a slight skunky aroma but not over whelming, and in truth does not impact the brew too much. Noticeable grain like flavors with a fair amount of malt, which finishes with a slight, but nice and noticeable hop taste. This brew is not bad; it was the first one that I came across where I could actually pick up a noticeable hop flavor. For the brews that I have had while in Mexico I would say that this was middle of the pack. Possible something that I would get while at a Mexican restaurant but have some others that I like a bit better."
"I'm not a fan of putting lemons or limes in a beer, and I don't think any kind of citrus fruit could have rescued it."
"I think the taste was very clean and crisp, the mouthfeel was very nice. It was a little softer than a lot of lagers, but very nice. I rate this pretty high on drinkability. (My standard of drinkability is rating it by how well I think I could drink a brew all night). I could drink this one all night."
"An awesome Mexican beer, and a wonderful exmple of the Vienna Lager style as well. This was tasty, and I recommended it."
"UPDATE: Mexico is now getting more serious about craft beers so I may have to retract my ""best Mexican beer, period"" statement. But, it is still the best mass produced Mexican beer."
"The taste here is a bit tangy, (no I didn't put the lime in) something I look for more in a mexican lager than vienna but I'm not splitting hairs. The brew is light and sweet, slick and springy on the tounge, and goes down smooth."
"Overall, one of the better Mexican lagers I have had."
"D - Goes down smooth due to wateriness, but I won't be grabbing another even if it's free."
"Overall, Bohemia is a very nicely done, well-refined European-style lager that easily stands up to its predecessors, and deserves more attention than it gets."
"Bohemia pours a light yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Grainy and banana like aromas are present (I don't think there's supposed to be banana like aromas!). Banana like flavors are also present in the taste. After the beer aired out briefly, I can no longer taste banana or smell it. Grainy flavors dominate, a little bit of a citrus twang too. Actually, not too bad for a Mexican offering. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: This is an easy drinker. It's a little complex but not much. It's a good bad porch drinkin' beer. It vaguely reminds me of Sam Adams but still doesn't come close. Still it serves a different purspose I suppose."
"D: This is not something I would drink regularly, but definatly what I'll be ordering the next time I go out for mexican food. I recommend drinking it with OUT adding lime."
"Many mexican restaurants in Texas will carry this beer. One warning, since this beer is not as well known as other mexican brews, it may have been sitting in the storage room for a while. Like all beers, if it's old it may start to get a bit skunky. If you get a bottle from a fresh batch, you will not regret trying it."
"Light body with a pleasant mouthfeel, this beer can be heavily consumed in hot weather and accompanies a good Mexican dish like no other. This is still my all-around favorite Mexican beer to date. Cheers!"
"Bottom line: A good Vienna Lager that's worth trying and even buying from time to time."
"Good beer, and rivals Negra Modelo as my favorite from south-of-the-border."
"Between this and a diet Pepsi, I'd take the Pepsi. Between this and a Bud light, it's be a real tought call and I'd hem and haw a little, but I guess I'd settle for this."
"Overall a very tasty and hoppy lager. Likely the best offering from south of the border."
"Delicate but tasty, this might just edge out Negra Modelo next time I go for mexican food."
"This beer is pretty light for a darfker tasting beer. I loved the smell, the taste, everrything about this beer except for the colr. The color isn't as full as it could be. However, I still think this is a great tasting beer that is pleasing to the nose after a sip. I would recommend it to anyone. If you're ever at a mexican restaurant ask your waiter to get you one of these."
"Note: I didn't detect any sourness or skunkiness in the aroma or flavor as some other reviewers have noted."
"What a great beer to have with a Mexican dinner. Rather than grabbing a domestic American Beer, this beer is a wise choice. Not a strong brew, it has light malty taste, that tickles the senses. Try it with a chicken burrito, makes for a great dinner!"
"Here's a crisp, clean, Mexican lager that might actually have something to offer. While the nose is quite faint -- bordering on non-existent -- there is a crisp bitterness that establishes itself early on in the palate and lingers on well into the finish. Along the way an easy malty sweetness is noticeable, but it is this well-placed, albeit mild, bitterness that causes Bohemia to stand out from most of the other mainstream Mexican lagers."
"drinkability: This would make a fine summer brew, something to quench your thirst with and little else. Not terribly complex, but then that's not always a bad thing."
"A good, tasty Vienna lager treat."
"Opinion: I was surprised by this beer. It is really light, but manages to retain a significant maltiness. It has enough presence from the Vienna malt that I truly believe that this is a representation of the Vienna style. I thought that it was a bit lacking in dextrines and just all-around chewyness, but still an approachable beer."
"Probably one of the best beers from Mexico; I invite people to try Bohemia."
"Pours a pale, transparent corn yellow with a fizzy, white head. Nose is a little astringent with some skunked malt. Tastes like a sweet malt liquor - skunky, sugary corn, favorably less skunked than Corona. Better than I remembered it last Spring Break in Lake Havasu CIty, AZ before I became enlightened and was on a Mexican beer binge, but certainly doesn't compare well to the Sam Adams Boston Lager I had earlier in the night. Thin and bubbly mouthfeel. The best of Mexican macro lagers I've had thus far though, if that's any consolation..."
"beer Mexican, that widely remembers the birthplace of the brewmaster who create it, very Czechoslovakian in its flavor, a pleasing aroma and flavor to Czech lupulos, with ambar dark a bottle, in presentation of 12 ounces, with its pico de oro (gold tip), done by cerveceria cuauhtemoc of mexico, excellent in its presentation is one of the most expensive by bottle domestic beers in my country"
"I do not know why this beer is cataloged as not reccomended, but I do reccomend it. PErhaps one of the best MExican beers, or one of the less awfull. It has a bitter tatse but a sense of it is dark remains until you see it, it is clear. The problme is that is considered a craft beer and it is not."
" Nothing special but a decent refreshing beer for hot weather."
"Pours clear pale yellow, with a bubbly white head. Two fingers slowly become a ring of foam that doesn't leave much lacing. You can smell the sweet malt and noble hop after the pour, but aroma becomes bland once the beer has settled. The pale, toasted malt flavor seems more influenced by Pilsner and Munich malts than Vienna. The hops are unbalanced enough to leave traces of skunk in the aftertaste. It's surprising that a Mexican style Vienna would appear more like the original german. Light in body and carbonation, it is fairly drinkable, but lacks the residual sweetness and roasted flavor key to the Vienna style."
"From 12 oz. bottle, pours golden clear with a thick, very white head that fades rather quickly. Cinnamon/apple/wheat nose. Wheatish, neutral flavor, rather unimpressive. Watery, bubbly mouth. Good drinkability, with a slightly metallic finish that detracts. A typical Mexican beer."
"You can't judge a beer by it's color, I guess. One of the tastiest brews I've had in a while."
"I liked this beer, much better than other common mexican lagers"
"I'm rating this as a pale lager. Straw yellow in color with a good white head, I left the lime the waitress brought out. Mild malt aromas of light bread and lighter biscuit, the faintest of hop aromas. Flavor is clean and balanced yet leanng toward the bitter side. The beer is crisp and refreshing, but could do with a little more body. A good beer overall, especially on a hot summer day."
"Drinkable: Drinkable in the way water is drinkable. Hey, if you are the type of BA who thinks this kind of beer has its place after mowing the lawn-this is for you. I would recommend water in its stead."
"My favorite brew outo f Mexico for sure."
"Knocked back a few of these at On The Border in Charleston, SC while visiting friends. I can't believe I have not reviewed this beer yet since it is my go to beer when traveling in Mexico. Pours a nice golden yellow color with a thin white head and some lacing. Good, earthy hop aroma with faint grainy malts in the background. Very clean and flavorful. Perfect accompliment to go with my burritos."
"poured a pale yellow color with slight white head that fell to a very slight white ring. Smell is very light and almost non-existent. Tsste is very light with a slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is very light and not much to describe. Easy to drink, but not much else."
"I wish to apologize to the good folks at Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma for the 'poor brewery' crack at the outset. The Bohemian/Bohemia Rhapsody play on words was just too good to pass up. Truth is, Bohemia is one fine Vienna lager and is a damn sight better than either Dos Equis or Carta Blanca. Looks like I have a new favorite Mexican beer. Salud!"
"Taste is light malty sweet and having light/moderate bitterness. Quiet empty mouthfeel, makes this brew a dinkable beer but no highflyer."
"Much better than you standard Mexican lager. Not quite as bland as corona but still not much too it. I wouldnt hesitate having this one again if I were in a Mexican mood."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating observed. Pours very light straw, slight chill haze, slight white head, leaving just a tad of lacing. Just a few lazy bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Nose is corn/rice like. Just a typical macro lager going on here, lawn mower brew, or ice cold with some spicy mexican food. Besides that, pass this one by."
"Light bodied, crisp carbonation, very drinkable and pairs well with the lighter Mexican foods or seafood."
"Poored first one into a 16oz mug , drank second one out of the bottle . The packaging was nice and that was about it while not a offensive tasting beer I felt ripped off after drinking the first bottle no head and very flat.If I had a do over I would take High life or Oldstyle over this."
"¡Salud!"
"Bottom line: eh, pretty good, better than most Mexican beers Ive had."
"High life light light yellow, sweet grainy aroma, and a nice clean palate flavor, like some Japaneese beers I can recall. Negra Modello used to be my old stand by at most cocinas around, but a bad batch of those led me to try other offerings. If you get the chance, try this with your local favorite mexican establishment. Dig the label: I would love that as a t-shirt."
"Medium yellow straw; clean, with a finger of dense, off-white head. Smells of lightly toasted, sweetbread malts, with a dose of spicy, almost citrusy hop backing. Not bad. Bubbly, acidic and bitter up front. Turns mid-palate toward lightly sweetened, grainy malt. Finish is dry and bitter with a hint of clean malt. Light to medium bodied, with a crisp, refreshing feel. Surprisingly good."
"Tasted: 01/11/05"
"Clear medium gold, darker than straw with a thinnish pale head. Simple laces on the glass. Scant aroma, slightly bready with a bit of tanginess. Light mouthfeel with lively but not overbearing carbonation. Starts with brown sugar flavors and a slightly grainy texture, dries a bit by mid mouth with just the mildest hops. Finish is quite clean, some of the earlier texture remains but much of the flavor has passed you by. Actually a fairly drinkable brew, if pretty unremarkable in most categories."
"Snow white head over predictably extremely pale yellow liquid. The nose is so faint as to be practcally non existant. That which does exist is a very light, faint malt character. The taste is very light bodied with a surprising leafy hop twang...almost akin to a Ballantine xxx ale. It dries out a bit as you swallow, other than that it's a one trick pony here. Good hot weather beer."
"Crisp carbonation that seems well suited to this beer. The brewer has this part down. While the flavor is just average, this is a very easy drinking beer. I would have no problem ordering this one again."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. The first of about 10 Mexican beers I am going to review from notes just back from a week trip to Cancun. Plus I have another 5 to rate that I brought back. OK...Smelled decent. Had a few hops lingering around. Maybe a sweet flowery fruity flavor hiding in the background? Poured with a small head and a bit of lacing. Light yellow coloring. Tasted pretty good for a beer from Mexico. Maybe a cross between a pilsner and a lager? Good carbonation. A few light hops in there too. Maybe the third best beer I had back there. Refreshing, but would take another beer I like over it anytime. Worth a try."
"The overall feel of this one was very American macro crap to me. I just didn't care for it at all. Even though it was refreshing, if I wanted refreshing I'd buy Aquafina not beer. The water is cheaper!"
"Sinkability  This one lacks substance and winded up in the pipes."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that leaves a some lace. Clear pale amber color. Light bodied and light carbonation. Slightly hoppy nose. Starts slightly on the sweet side and the finish is clean, with no lingering aftertaste. Good session beer. $1.30 for a 12oz. bottle from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY."
"Just about the only drinkable beer on the strip in Acapulco last year. Man, that place is _owned_ by Corona. Picked up a bottle when I got home to confirm my impressions. The head is big, white, fizzy and the beer is a clear, clear, pale gold. Spoonky nose, crackers, a little fruit. The front is a little spicy (interesting) with a touch of corn syrup. Fruity, sweetish middle and lightly nutty finish with some nice hops. It's a nice, light, fresh lager."
"Medium gold, small head raises and falls very fast. Skunks grassy malt smell. Flavor has a lot of skunky malt, but also hides a hefe-like banana and clove flavor, also a little metallic. Body is very thin, i could see this crap getting annoying very quickly."
"Bohemia is one of the better south-of-the-border brews availiable almost anywhere around in Houston and probably the U.S. Appearance is a decent golden, head is fairly small. Smell is rather weak, but clean, mild sweetness is noticible. Taste is pretty good, maybe a little too light, but the balance is just about right. Complemented my enchiladas nicely. This is easily better than the Tecates and Coronas of Mexico, and is something I could drink quite a lot of in the future. Probably the only Mexican beer that I'd rather have is Negra Modelo."
"Interesting beer from Mexico. Mildly bitter after taste with overtones of roasted hops and barley, and just a touch of oats flavor. Medium to high carbonation, with a medium white head. I would choose this over many other Mexican brews, for which i think this is probably the best beer Mexico has sent across the boarder."
"beer poured a pale golden color. the head was present during the pour but ceased to be after the beer was in the glass. nose was grainy, with a wee bit of a sweet smell. Taste was rather grassy. tastes like corn and biscuits much like other mexican brews. had a hoppy taste to it towards the end of the beer. mouthfeel was thin, thinner than i like, but it was good for this beer. left my mouth feeling a bit oily, just a bit. not a bad brew, nothing to get excited about in my opinion but a good brew none-the-less. Surely one of the better brews from mexico."
"looks like Vernor's ginger ale, darker gold to copper, filled with carbonation and no head to speak of. Sweet malty aroma that does not smell like corn (surprisingly). Wow, I think there may be some hops in this (well maybe) Seems to finish with somewhat of a hop bite, maybe hop bitterness and maybe even some even indescernable flavoring hops. Starts crisp and light, little bif of aftertaste. When I first tried this, I though it was great. I'm glad I waited until my second try to rate it. Now it's just ok. Modelo Especial beats this."
"Overall a good mass-produced Mexican lager. I'm impressed with it's solid yet gentle qualities which usually fall prey to money hungry beer giants. Nice job keeping it real."
"Impressive but thin."
"I had this while eating at Don Pablo's. It's a little odd that this is a Mexican beer given it's name, but it didn't taste like most Mexican beers either. Meaning it was actually good! The pour left a pale bronze color with a small to medium head. Moderate lacing. The smell was a combination of sweet and spicy with the malts, hops, and yeast all working together. The taste began with a grainy flavor but I didn't get much of the huskiness I get in other Mexican beers. The hops are definitely a spicier flavor and balance out the grain malts really well. The body on this beer is thicker than most lagers and the finish is very thirst quenching. It matched my fajitas really well."
"Drinkability: all around a fine pilsner, actually very close to greatness had it tasted like it smelled!"
"There is definitely some of the corn grain taste in there, but it's not too bad. It finishes like a relatively classy lager. It feels nice in the mouth and is really drinkable, especially in warm and hot weather."
"The beer poured a nice, clear golden pale with a white head that faded quickly and leaves no lace. The carbonation was up that provides a fiz to it. The aroma wasn't strong but a sweet-corn grain could be noticed. The taste starts out sweet, grain, grass with a touch of corn. Malt and hop are mild. Very drinkable, leaveing the mouth a slight dry feel."
"The taste was very enjoyable, very sweet, with lime and ginger (a very light hint of caramel too, maybe...). The maltiness is pretty much hidden, but still noticeable, which I found interesting for a Mexican beer. The hops leave a very clean mouthfeel, with no bitterness. This beer is so drinkable. It was perfect with Mexican food. It's a good session beer, refreshing, clean, enjoyable. I got more than I expected."
"This is a staple for me whenever I go to any mexican restaurant. It is actually one of my favorite session beers. It pours a nice clean pale golden color white a white foam head. Smell is very clean as is the taste. The taste is complex by any means but I love the sweetish clean flavor of this beer, very inoffensive. Mouthfeel is decent as is drinkability. This is certainly not a top 50 brew but I'd never turn this down. One my of guilty pleasures."
"Super drinkable brew, sad that I avoided tasting this for a long time just because it is a Mexican beer."
"Poured a very pale yellow with a fizzy, white head composed of very large bubbles. Smell was off- it seemed sour, stale,and like something unpleasant had been burning (not sure what it was). The taste was harsh and very bitter. I can't tell exactly what was in the taste, but it clashed. No real things I could identify as hops or malt or such. Is it this bad or is this one skunked?"
"pours a respectable gold with a fizzy white head that diminishes almost immediatly. smells grainy, a bit of citrus, a little skunky. taste? pretty simple...clean, touch of corn, light bitterness matched with a light sweetness. pretty bland but not bad. decent mouthfeel, a bit thin, but when matched with the simple flavor it is refreshing. i imagine it would be good with spicey food or as a football beer. its alright in my book."
"I don't know what it is about Mexico that they think they make a descent beer. This beer poured out very light in color. It didn't produce much of a head which is not what I would expect from a lager. Unfortunatly, the flavor of this beer was as unimpressive as its coloring. I've read that when eating spicy foods, you should drink beer that has a high ABV because the alcohol is what cuts the heat. The article also said that water won't rescue you from the fire. I've never been to Mexico but you know what they say, ""Don't drink the Bohemia, I mean, water""."
"Had this last night at El Norte's a very good Mexican eatery in Middletown NY. This was a good brew better than Corona and XX. Pours out yellow almost amber but not quite with a thick white head that thins out and leaves a very fine layer on the top. Smell was straight up hops and corn. Taste was pretty much the same as the smell except for a bit of a sweet taste thrown in. Very drinkable as I had 4 while eating my chicken enchilladas, of all the beers from Mexico I've tried this IMO is one of the better ones."
"Had this right after a Dos Equis Special Amber and a Modelo Dark Ale -- and this beer blew the XX away -- and was definitely better than the Modelo. Try this beer out. You'll be very impressed."
"Perhaps the finest Mexican pilsner-type beer. Straw color. Pours with a white head that quickly dissipates to a thin collar of foam. Starts just a bit sweet but ends with a nice dash of spicy hops and a respectable amount of bitterness. Low marks for appearance -- at least if this supposed to be a Vienna-style lager -- which it clearly is not. Perhaps I'm reviewing the wrong beer?"
"A very nice and drinkable lager from Mexico..i would have this again."
"A small white head with fine-large bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was clear with carbonation observed.This beer's hue was yellow-gold and the nose was malty.The flavor was somewhat bitter and lightly hoppy.Its mouthfeel was tingly, thin and light bodied.There was very little lacing with this beer.In my opinion there is nothing that really stood out with this beer and it was rather a boring beer to drink and rate."
"ng"
"Anything is better than Corona. This is maltier than typical lagers. Tastes like it could be a vienna style, but isn't quite as sweet, dark, or malted as many of those brews. Fast fading head. Faintly sweet nose and flavor. A bit grainy. A bit more beer-like taste than the other 15 or so that I sampled in mexico."
"Overall, a decent brew to have on hand when eating some spicy Mexican food but I'm not going to have it taking up space in my fridge otherwise."
"It has a nice strong body for how weak this beer looks. A nice powerful feel in the mouth. I recommend this beer when having food and when your favorite is just not what a person is looking for at the time. Very enjoyable."
"Lt gold color. WIth a foamy medium head. Aroma is sweet . A Light taste lager.It's slightly hoppy. Crisp taste. Full and smooth. Mouthfeel. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. A typical Mexican/South American Lager. Lighter tasting beer, not a lot of flavor, but it is light and refreshing."
"A solid beer to turn to with Mexican food. In fact, pretty darn good all on its own. This blows away all that ""popular"" Mexican swill out there. This one has some personality and doesn't need a lemon to kick it up a notch. Pleasant malt flavors with a little sweet bread dough and just enough bitterness too keep it interesting. A safe bet for your fiesta."
"Color and style expectations aside, this beer was much better flavorwise than I expected. I found no off-flavors from corn, rice, grain husks, etc. in here. Easy to drink. Altogether, probably one of the best non-dark beers from Mexico."
"Mouthfeel and taste average. Pretty average beer. Just once I'd like a mexican beer to blow me away."
"I went to a local Mexican restaurant and decided to try this beer with my meal. It poured a very light straw with a minimal head. The head evaporated almost instantly and the beer looked flat about halfway through the glass. The beer had just enough maltiness in the aroma and the taste to let me know I was drinking a beer and not a glass of water. The mouthfeel was very light and low carbonation. This made an okay beer for a Mexican food place or maybe watching a ballgame. It could make a good session beer."
"12 oz botttle. Gold foil covers the cap and neck. Clear pale golden in appearance with an airy white head. Light aroma consists of sour grain. Thin mouthfeel with a crispness from the carbonation. I don't know if my taste buds were off or what, but the flavor exhibited an unexpected fruitiness to it. Light malt and grain flavors lead into a somewhat dry finish. Overall pretty bland. I expected a little more here. Pales in comparison to Dos Equis Amber."
"Cheers"
"The brewer should shout the origin on the label; this is a decently put together brew worthy of its name. A good food beer, it would range through the spice spectrum quite well."
"Color is golden yellow and a bit pale with a white head that went out fast leaving some patchy lace. Smells of lightly done malt with faint hop. Taste is mostly sweet malt, very clean with barely a hop noticed. Feel is medium bodied and easy, smooth and refreshing. This is a better Mexican lager then most."
"Medium golden color with a small white head which disappears in seconds, good lace, and lots of fizzy carbonation. Aroma has just a hint of skunk, slight malt, and mild floral hops. Taste begins with slightly sweet bread malts, which are quickly subsumed by earthy/medicinal hop flavors that linger past the end of the taste. Finish is crisp nd dry. Mouthfeel is quite good for the style. This beer pairs very well with spicy foods and is quite refreshing in and of itself. Among the better of classical Mexican beers."
"I don't particularly like this style of beer so I probably won't be buying it again, but I would definitely not have a problem drinking another one if it was available. Overall this would be an easy to drink beer for even the pickiest of beer advocates."
"This is your average Mexican beer, but at the same time it's not, if that makes any sense. I have had this on numerous occasions and I still enjoy it as much as the first time I had it. It has a light initial taste, but finishes off with a semi-stouty taste. It's darker than most Mexican beers, so it has some body to it and doesn't need a fruit to make it good. My good friends from college, the Coastas, named so because they were from Coasta Rica, brought me to it. They also gave me a cool little recipe that they use in Costa Rica w/ Bohemia. Take one bottle of it, mix it with a couple dashes of hot sauce and a couple dashes of lime juice. You have to trust me on this one. It'll make you sweat, but you just want even more. The tastes mix together wonderfully. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
"By far, this is the best beer from Mexico that I have ever had, it actually tastes like beer. Shame on you Corona, et al!"
"This beer is not going to tax your tastebuds but it is a decent drink.  I bet is would go good with spicy foods."
"Bright gold color. Sudsy falling head. Aromas of clear grain and well-judged hops and husk. The palate features a nice balance of creamy, fine, fizzy texture, malty, medium body and, again, well-judged bitterness. Bright lemon battles with wet earth. Finishes clean and dry. Certainly the best Mexican light lager I can easily get my hands on, and in the more general Austalasian/Helles/Lager category one of the best as well."
"Not nearly as bad as I was expecting. As far as the Mexican beers I have tried so far, it is not quite as good as Negro Modelo, but is mucho better than Corona, Tecate, etc. Light malt flavor. Aroma is hard to comment on because all I could smell was the lime. All in all I would probably try this again as it went with my enchiladas fairly well."
"Pours a clear gold, the head white, minimal, the lace is adequate. Nose is malt, clean and crisp. Front is malt, lightly sweet, top is light, the finish is quite acidic, dry, and nicely hopped. The second beer I had in Warez, Mexico, on my first weekend at my new posting to Fort Bliss. Ranks #937 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"This is my top pale Mexican beer without a doubt."
"Pours an extremely clear pale yellow. So pale it resembles white wine. The 1 1/2 finger head dissipates very quickly. The smell as well as the taste is that of a very faint sweetness. It finishes almost in a disappointing way....leaves you high and dry ""so to speak"". The mouthfeel is barely more refined than water. I feel like I could drink alot of these, but could a stand repeated ""high and dry"" episodes is the big question. It went okay with the food, but the food outdid the beer. Think I'll try the Dos XX next. Salud!"
"Notes: Before anyone says anything ... yes, this is a Vienna-Style Lager. There are quite a few Mexican lagers that are, but that's a history lesson within itself. Back to the beer ... without a doubt one of the best mass-produced Mexican lagers available. Just had one of these with a rice, bean and cheese burrito covered in peppermash salsa. It quenched, quelled and complemented quite nicely."
"Typical pilsner appearance.  Straw hue and perfectly clear.  Lemony and floral hop nose perhaps from Tettanger.  Malt notes are surpsingly absent in the aroma.  Light in carbonation for a pilsner.  Hop bitterness is mild and malt sweetness thus dominates.  Lemon zest hop flavor followed by a hint of graininess.  Nothing outstanding in flavor, but the lack of flaws and clean finish to this beer make it innocuous and drinkable. It's not a beer to savor by itself... it needs greasy food."
"Lighter malt aroma that adds nicely to the drink.  Nice full head.  Clear light gold color.  Taste is a little drier than many in style, but not sharp or bitter, which I think is why it goes so well with many foods.  Good mouth feel, without excessive carbonation.  A satisfying lager."
"slightly hazy golden hue with a thin head.  foam dies quickly and doesn't leave any lace.  earthy hops in the nose, and a medium body and fairly full mouthfeel. tastes great with some actual hop assertiveness.  solid and unspectacular.  too bad american mass producers can't come up with something similar to this pilsener, it would kick the crap out of our current options for quality lager."
"My favorite Mexican beer, although I only had a few. Better then Dos Equis and it smashes Corona. I thought it was very crisp & it had clean finish. It went very well w/ my prime rib steak & chili."
"This is my favorite Mexican beer. When we first started road-tripping to Mexico as youngsters, we drank Corona because it was everywhere. Once I discovered Bohemia, I never went back. It tastes great icy cold on the beach or with carne asada for dinner."
"You can actually tase hops in this beer.  My second favorite Mexican, behind Negro Madelo."
"Pretty good south of the border beer.  Nothing special, but decent body and sufficient hops to do the job."
