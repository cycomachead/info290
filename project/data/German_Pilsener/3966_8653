3.65,9.3,4,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"i believe this beer gets underrated. Granted it is not the best example of a German pils, but because it is easy to find at my local Aldi, only 6.00 a six pack, it makes it a go to beer for me. Pours clear golden color with a slight head, some lacing. It has an initial bite and slight bitterness on the back of tongue. But, it gets smoother the more you drink. (dont they all) Also, because it is not a high alcohol content, makes a decent session beer. Paired with a grilled smithfield pork sirloin, some spaetlze or some potato gnocchi and a spinach and tomato salad very nice. Good served ice cold on a hot day. (I know some people say germans drink beer ""warm"" this is absolutely false, they just dont chill beer as cold as americans. Brits drink beer a bit warmer.) Wernesgruner is nice beer for the price.","El-Heffe","Dec 24, 2014"

Poppingthe top I get a nice full bottle with a malty and barley malt smell. No adjuncts here. On the pour into my SAPP I get a clear lightly golden color with a thick foamy two finger head. On the taste this brew is delightfully crisp and clean with a nice sharp hoppiness that is semi bitter right along side a sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel is thin but that is the norm for this style so no down-grade. Very refreshing and a great brew for a hot summer day. I would buy again.","mooseisloose","Jul 14, 2013"

3.62,8.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Canned sample. Light gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Fairly rich malty aroma from this one with some milder grassy hop notes. Very crisp mouthfeel, with flavor notes of light malt, clean grassy hops, and a very slight touch of citrus. Very satisfying indeed. A good example of the classic German pilsner style.","fisherman34","Apr 29, 2005"
2.7,-19.2,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,2.5,"Pours a clear golden yellow, big fluffy white head, decent lacing. Smell is sweet, kind of a grainy malt smell, honey, little bit of discernible hops. Taste is very sweet, not very pleasant, it tastes almost skunked except its in a can. Honey sweetness, almost cloying, no hops to be found. Smooth carbonation, light mouthfeel, and not pleasant.","Viggo","Apr 28, 2005"
3.19,-4.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a golden yellow color with a small sized white head. It doesn't seem to have much carbonation, little to no fizziness. The smell is of nice sweet hops. It really doesnt have that skunky bitter smell that I notice in a lot of German pilsners. The taste is very subtle at first, almost like a light beer. There is a hop bitterness midway through, and the beer finishes with bready tastes. The mouthfeel is not bad for the style of beer, and it goes down pretty well. Overall, its not a bad beer, but it seems to lack any outstanding or unique qualities.","jasonpeckins32","Apr 07, 2005"
3.89,16.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"As a Pils hound my palate is over worked with the expected Bohemian/Czech profile pils... Im beginning to be more partial to the Northern German Pilsners...this one did not disappoint....good biscuity malt spine balanced with the marvelous blend of herbal German hop varieties one would expect in a rich Marzen...I like the mix...this is a very good, and well made, Pilsner...fresh refreshing slightly dry but with enormous taste.","pootz","Feb 04, 2005"
3.96,18.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a classic clear gold under a two finger white head with lovely contour, great retention and a nice network of lace down the glass. Yup, this is what a Pils should look like. The nose is very malty, smooth but lacking any hop spice to balance. The mouth is medium carbonated and slightly sticky, although light in body. Good smooth bready malt taste with a decent hop bitterness in the background. The hops are floral in nature, not at all skunky. The finish is more malt sweet than hops bitter, while the aftertaste maintains a bit of both. Nice, solid if unspectacular product.","Globetrotter","Feb 03, 2005"

It is drinkable, but as far as pilseners go there are many other things that I would prefer.","tatterdash","Sep 10, 2003"
