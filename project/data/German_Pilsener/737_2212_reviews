"Overall: Meh. Pilsners aren't really my style and by the standards of other German beers this one really doesn't have much going for it. Still a cut above the usual macro suspects but still nothing special."
""
"A mediocre pilsener I tried in Germany"
"Enjoy"
"Easy drinking. Nothing interesting about this beer. Inoffensive."
""
"I found this one to be quite a poor beer when I tried it again here, it was actually terrible in places with far too much bitterness coming through and a really dry feel that didn't help matters at all. The body was a thin one but this wasn't anything too serious, it was the taste that was the real problem here with very little to it at all. I don’t think this one will be a beer I go for again."
""
"The quintessential, refreshing, hoppy Northern German Pilsener. One of the best beers in the world."
""
"Can: Poured a bright yellow color lager with a large pure white color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light cereal notes is not really noteworthy. Taste is also dominated by light cereal notes with some residual sugar notes with light dry hoppy notes. Body is light with good carbonation. OK pilsner bit nothing to write home about."

"Overall - a good solid dry pilsner that's tasty, thirst quenching and just damn good. Recommended."

"I was at hopleaf in Chicago and asked for a good pilsner, this was what I got and couldn't have been happier.  Solid and not overdone for the sake of just overdoing it like some many."

"05/02/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Crisp & clean. Just a hint of hops. Good stuff."

""
"Good beer, tasty"
""
"Clear straw gold with an impressive head settling to a decent cap and lots of lace. Looks good, smells and tastes good."
"Crisp, clean, well carbonated.  Nice bite, not too bitter. My bottle shop always keeps them in the case box to avoid the light. Solid German Pilsner and great representative of the style."

"o: a really bitter but great pilsener. i don't usually drink lagers but i enjoyed this"
""

"Final Grade: 3.57, a B grade. Jever Pilsener is refreshing, inoffensive, and highly sessionable - in essence, a prototypical German pils. An otherwise unremarkable beer, but like most German pilseners imported into this province, it's still pretty good value for the price point. That reason alone means I will probably return to it in the future. A middle-of-the-road lager that shouldn't ruffle too many feathers."

""
""
"This was one was just ok- had some good elements up front- the hop flavors- but finished weak, with clearly old malt flavors and some skunkiness."
""
""
""

""
""

"O- aside from being light struck, it wasn't bad."

"DATE TASTED: April 26, 2014... GLASSWARE: Jever pokal... OCCASION: revisiting an old favorite... APPEARANCE: misty, murky golden yellow body; rocky, sporadic white head laces with wispy tentacles; medium effervescence... AROMA: holy Hallertau! metallic iron hammer a la Thor or a nine-iron to the nostrils--subtler hints of fragrant apple and pear with a bit of dough...a stronger, more forceful pilsner... PALATE: medium-bodied, crisp, almost biting mouthfeel--softens at the finish; highly drinkable, with a more lagerish body than expected...TASTE: apple/pear and good ol' Hallertau; a rather simple formula that also gives off fragrant waves of other fruits... OVERALL: a pleasant variation on the Bavarian theme--a pilsner that is a bit less clean and crisp, but retains enough of its style to cleanse and pucker; refreshing yet substantial..."
""
"Overall: Easy drinking and traditional pilsner. A little more skunkiness than I would like, but still and enjoyable beer."

"All too often unfortunately, the conclusion is to go ahead with it even despite the well-known fact that green glass can have awful consequences for delicate, light-bodied lagers. Sadly enough there's a good percentage of the population who, having only tried industrial import, actually perceive this skunkiness as a sign of quality! It's not. And Jever should know better."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Always been a better Pilsner than most, especially if you prefer a dry taste compared to some of the slightly sweeter ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Overall, I like it. I'm going to have to follow through on this half-assed plan to try more pilsners and see what they're all about."
""
""
""
"Taste is great. I love ti . it's coarse, it's established. It's bot some herbal and some grass and only a light touch of grain sweetness on a truly light and crisp body. This is clean. Flows like water and it should. It's a pils. It goes in a big pitcher on the table. To fill you glass again and again. it's not heavy. It's a bit leafy a bit coarse a bit earthy and it is semi astringent in the dry finish. I love this beer because it drinks like it should. Easily with plenty to engage the palate and no thing heavy or out of place. Leafy. Crisp."

"Jever is not and if you like prima pils from Victory you will like Jever's pils beacause it has a similar taste."
""
""
""
"Straw yellow in color, very clear, with a medium white head. Slight lacing on the glass. Mild aroma with light floral hops. Crisp flavor, medium-dry finish, and light bodied. Did not pack the bitterness or flavor that I crave from a good pilsner. Nothing wrong with the beer, there are just way better versions of the style out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: Had this on tap recently and I recommend to try it too if you find it."
""
"Very sessionable and refreshing beer. A bit too light, but with clear hops notes that gives a nice dryness and bitterness."
""
""
""
"O- Bad. The malt tastes stale. The finish of this beer is not pleasant, and it only makes me want to chug this down in a flash to never deal with the bitterness. Maybe that's why they chug it down in the nightclubs all over Germany. I couldn't finish this beer."
""

"I'm guessing this is actually a pretty decent German pils on tap, or closer to the source. The BB date is early next year, so, well, I'm not one to point fingers (hah!), but this record is getting pretty old and dated. This is just all right in its present incarnation, something to drink when the lawnmowin's all done, and the thinkin's not yet begun."
""
""
"Pour is pale straw yellow with white head. Nose has strong malt aroma, doughy and some light bread crust, caramel, and grassy hop behind. Taste is more doughy, caramel, maybe diacetyl, faint grassy hop. Light body and soft carbonation, very creamy on the palate."
""
""
""
"Golden yellow body with a thin lace on the glass that lingers but no head to speak of. Smells like a German Pilsner. Grassy and clean, lots of hops and spices. There's a bitter smell that almost leaves a sense of coffee. Smells pretty good. Taste is that of a normal pilsner, which I like, but there's not much to write home about. Heavy on the hops bitterness that sits on your tongue for a good while. A very fresh and clean taste. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, but overly carbonated in my opinion. None the less it goes down nicely and would make a fine session pilsner. Worth a go."
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
"O: Hmm. In some ways this is a typical lager but on the other hand there are dry and bitter flavors that give it some character. Worthy of try but nothing I would grab again."

""
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, well carbonated, dry and crisp on the tongue. This drinks fine but there's definitely more expressive, interesting pilseners readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitterness that is this beer's reputation is certainly there - straight IBUs over any Noble spice (Hallertau and Tettnang here) which is unusual in Germany. Surprised by how soft it is, though, and with some residual sweetness it's just missing a certain snap . A top pils, but not the original version of Prima Pils, which is what I was hoping for."

"O: Easy drinking beer. Good session German Lager beer. Recommended"

""
"o - Overall an average pilsener. Not much going on in the nose or taste, though neither are bad. Probably wouldn't seek it out again."
""
"O: Was hoping for more, but for me this is just and average Pilsener."
""
"O/D-Better than most Pils. Its like a poor man's Prima Pils. I enjoyed it but I don't love it. Worth a try however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- Overall, this is a good Pils -- not a great one. EKU has a great one and Trumer's US brewed rendition is great to style. The Trumer may prove a divide between imported and domestic-brewed beers; showing that a Pasteurized import may just lose some of the smoother characters you'd get at the source. Nonetheless, the Jever also proves that light lagers don't have to be bland and characterless."
""
""
"O- A good pilsner. Easy drinking and flavorful. Perfect summer Pilsner. I wonder what it taste like straight from the brewery! Hmm"
""
"O-a decent, refreshing pils"
"Refreshing and drinkable pils. Probably won't get it again but it was certainly worth trying."
"D: had a few complaints, as i stated above, but overall a highly refreshing pils."
"Overall; Was crisp and clean and went well with lemon custard."
""
"Jever is a serious pilsner for those who enjoy crisp and well hopped pilsners. This is super dry and very hoppy, it's just awesome. A great session beer with plenty of carbonation and hoppy zip. I think this was prima pils inspiration...., ...,.A must try!"
""
"D-A very enjoyable beer, easy to drink, sessionable brew."
""
""
""
"Overall, a quite nice beer!"
""
""
"O-I like a pilsner with some hop bite and Jever delivers. Very drinkable at 4.9 abv."
""

""
""
"overall; a nicely done Pils, very clean and a joy to knock down after work."
"Jever Pilsener is a crystal clear, pale golden lager with a soft, fluffy, white head that has outstanding retention. It has a pilsner malt aroma. It smells light, fruity and grainy. In the mouth, it's light bodied and smooth. The finish is clean and dry. It has a light, clean pilsner malt flavor. It has a decent bitterness at the finish to zip up the taste and keep me thirsty for more. It tastes a little doughy and a little fruity. The bitterness is a little wooden and peppery with maybe a hint of juniper. I'm not much of a pilsner guy, but I found this to be quite pleasing and very refreshing. It's also nice to drink something from a green bottle that's not skunky. I would drink this on purpose in the summer."
""
""
""
""
"Would recommend Jever if a pilsner fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a real good pils IMO. Too much skunk covering up and real aromas and flavors. COnsidering this was on draft, i'm surprised at said skunkiness."
""
"Final-Fairly easy drinking though much sweeter than I expected. Though very good, the sweetness makes it not quite as crisp as I’m used to for the style and a little bit heavy. The alcohol is actually slightly noticeable, but it is good overall. It’s just a little bit unbalanced IMO, though not too distracting"
"O - Reasonably satisfying pilsener. Nothing exceptional here though."
"visit my website at selfhatinghister.com for more beer reviews, music, books and more"
"D: I don't think this is anything too special, but at least the flavors are very clean."
"Green bottle, medium to lighter yellow. Has a nice noble hop aroma, grassy and slightly spicy, taste is the same, starting rather light and finishing a bit heavier with the pronounced earthy/spicy hop bite. A nice full flavored pilsner. Pretty well done."
"Honey and butter crackers from the pale malt, grassy bitterness from a noble hop presence. Body is crisp but a little watery. Loses a bit of carbonation towards the end. Ok, not great. More bitter than many German Pils, but as skunky as Heineken. Go with the draft or minikeg version..."
"Jever is not a beginner's pilsner. If bitterness is your quest, then Jever should fullfill that. While sometimes a little too much, I did enjoy the bitterness in general."
"O: A classic Pilsener, I expected something crisp and delicious, but the dryness and all the grainy flavours made it a bit harsh. The price is good, though, it's still a pretty tasty lager, and I think it would do well with tasty home cooking."
"O: Very nice Pils. They seem to use very good ingredients and water along with a quality brewing process."
"O: This is an unmemorable, mass-produced beer with little to recommend it."
"Taste-Cracker, pilsner malt,short hop bite, very crisp, rather dry, light, quick finish. Crisp, light and refreshing. A fine example of the style."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 2 inch white head that fades to a thin cap. Foamy splotches of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, grass, and very slight skunk. Taste is of grains, grassy notes, with a bitter hop kick on the finish. There is an astringent bitterness on the palate that lingers after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pilsner with a very refreshing and authentic taste."
"The taste is crisp, subtle malt character with a heavy hand of hops. Quite tasty thoughout and finishes dry. There is a nice amount of spice but something just seems a bit muddied or rough. There really isn't anything wrong that I can point out as much as this isn't a great German Pils. Still a nice pilsener."
"Overall, a good hot summer beer, thanks to the dry finish. Not something I'd particularly crave or seek out again. Perhaps this tastes better closer to the source."
"Poured into a pilsner glass a crystal clear light yellow, foamy white 2 and half head. Lots of carbonation. Smells that ‘kinda skunk-like’ smell found a lot in import pilsners at first, that goes away (my wife smelled it across the room and said that). Taste reminded me of Stella; dry weak bitter taste and mouthfeel. I like this german pilsner. Great for hot summer months."
"Overall: Very dry and hoppy for the style. Different, but nice!"
"O - I would really like to try this beer again on tap or from a can to experience it flaw free regardless its still pretty easy drinking and worth trying if you like pilsners"
"Pours a very light clear yellow color. Fizzy white head that dissipates after a minute or two. Herbal, grassy very assertive Saaz hop aroma, as others have said it has a very typical generic ""Pilsner"" aroma. Nice and clean with a very hop forward flavor, but a bit one note. Not the best German Pils out there but a nice reminder to branch out and try some other ones."
"Overall it's an ok Lager. Not like the other German ones around but more like heinekin or something."
"D: Very nice pilsener fits the style to a tee. Pils from the homeland."
"Good pilsner, but certainly not one I'd choose over others like Herren, Augustiner, or the Rathaus beers."
"Overall: A very boring pils. It lacks flavor and body I would not recommend this beer"
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Nice fluffy white foamy head with a clear light straw/gold color. the carbonation is high as is expected. The aroma of spicy grassy hops is all over this one. There is bit of cereal grains that give off some good notes as well. The taste follows the nose. Nice spicy bitterness throughout the entire brew and the grains show through as well. The brew is mild and is ideal for a hot summer/spring day. A great German pilsner."
"Overall - Though no one area was exceptional, and most were merely average, I really enjoyed drinking the Jever. It is plenty tasty and quite satisfying. I would certainly buy this one again. 4 of 5"
"Just can't get into these pilsners, the look of the beer isn't too bad. It looks like a a yellow bodied beer with a foamy white head that has light carbonation bubbles rising from the glass. The smell to me is not pleasent, makes me feel like it's gone bad or something. The taste is grassy, very much like fresh cut grass. Some earth and leafs may be in there too. The mouthfeel was light and easy to drink thankfully. I don't ever need to have this one again."
"this one pours into the glass a nice golden hay color with a huge head of nearly three inches that never seems to let itself go down coating the sides with some nice lacing and tons of carbonation. Aroma is light grains, bready notes, hints of l;ight clove maybe and a touch of some earthy grass notes. Nothing crazy but it does the job. Very light and clean flavor, crisp, refreshing nothing out the ordinary in any way. Was easy to throw down with a clean and refreshing aftertaste, overall not bad at all could easily but down two or three."
"Everything else about this brew is well balanced. It might be a little weak on bubbles - flattening out easily. A very mild taste. Light easy drinking. But aromatic out the wazoo. It's a good buy for that. I want to buy it to drink one warm."
"Overall a great Pils. Get it and if you don't enjoy it, consider that your palate might need some training."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's not as heavily carbonated or as drying as the style can sometimes be, and the drinkability is quite good. A solid pilsner that doesn't stand out as anything special, but still an enjoyable beer."
"O: Not a bad beer but not as substantial as Konig"
"D - This is the type beer they all want to be. Who? BMC, that's who. But they'll never come close to this..."
"Overall- Excellent example of the style and a great beer overall. Very refreshing. I see myself drinking lots more of this in the future."
"Dr: A bit shite for Berlin prices."
"Overall - I'm a big fan of pilseners and although I've been somewhat critical in my review, its still a good beer and worthy of a sampling or revisit. Of the premium pilseners I've sampled, its probably in my top 10 somewhere but not top 2 or 3."
"Drinkability - This isn't traditional but was very tasty, more like a Czech pils than a German one."
"Poured it high into a pint glass, finding a good sturdy head that dissipated quickly, leaving a thin ring of foam at top. Beautiful straw blond color, delicious yeasty hoppy malty aroma. The Hallertau hops in there sing a gorgeous bitter floral chorus. Again, I usually prefer a bouquet of different hops, but this one variety can stand up for a gorgeous solo so rich you'd think it was a chorus. Taste is crisp, transparent, the malt and yeast so perfectly balanced with the hops that you have to imagine there's something really special about even just the water in this beverage. Mouthfeel is bracing, a bite just sharp enough, makes you want a liverwurst onion sandwich on pumpernickel with hot mustard and horseradish. Do both, if you can! The aftertaste lets the hops hang on so delicately, and yet with bitter authority, that you have to wish these little bottles were twice as big. Such a good beer, this! I found it disappeared faster than the usual brew, leaving no lacing on glass, a lack I'd usually deplore if it hadn't tasted so good. So easy to swallow! I find local beers much more politically correct, but again I have to make an exception for this stupid little glass container hauled all the way here to Upstate NY from Germany: it's worth it! Well, it's worth getting your friend to give it to you, anyway. My ""drinkability"" index usually depends on whether I can afford to drink it; after all, if I'm not ""able"" to purchase the stuff, I'm not able to drink much, either. As I don't know what a 6-pack costs, I'd say I'd gladly pay up to $9 for 6 tiny bottles of a beer this good."
"Wouldn't buy it in a bottle again though, it's pedestrian at best there. Might as well get a Bitburg."
"D: The beer is quite easy to drink and really opens up your palate."
"The palate opens quite significantly hoppy, lemony, zesty, resiny and coating my palate with its wondrousness. Sharp, herbal and intense, it's almost mineral-like in some ways. All of this nearly whelms the malt backbone, which is pretty light but still complex and different enough to appear behind the hops, cracker-like and mildly biscuity. The intensity and character of the hops make me think of a dry, sharp cheddar in some ways. Drying and crisp on the finish with a resiny hops, there's lemon zest and herbal character present. Highly carbonated, this is an effortless drinker. I will have to seek this out on tap."
"Had this on tap last night at the best German bar in Philly, Brauhaus Schmitz. Had a liter served in a giant sized glass mug. A very nice, clean drinking German pils. So good that my wife made me switch beers and she finished the liter for me. (I was left drinking Hofbrau Dunkel.). Would consider having this again."
"D: I'm surprised to see the ratings for this beer. Easily one of the best pilsners I've ever had."
"This is a typical German pilsener, complete with the typical look, smell, taste. This is not the best beer of this type I have had, but it does well. All 5 ratings slightly above average, beer has a very clean and crisp taste. This is definitely worth giving a try."
"Jever Pilsner should be enjoyed chilled or cold, and this is beer that complements your warm summer night.."
"Pours a pale golden with a bubbly white short lived head. Aroma of sweet malt, light fruitiness. Taste is sweet malts, corn, light cereal, and some light citrus hops. Palate is light to med body. good carbonation, and crisp mouth feel. Finish is sweet malt, cereal, ending with some good bittering hops. Overall a nice Pils, crisp, clean and refreshing."
"This might be my new favorite German Pilsner. How did I ever forget about Jever? Dry, no-nonsense beer here."
"Rather drinkable, with a little more hop presence than a lot of less characterfull pilseners. If it was a little cheaper, I'd drink a lot of this. As it is, I'm happy to find that my memories of this beer were not too terribly diminished by the taste of reality."
"Well done, but boring. Like a burger with no fixin's."
"Pours a clean yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, a small dryness to nothing at all. In the taste, small dry, light malt, and really nothing at all. A smooth, light, and water bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry malt in the aftertaste. Watery, lack of taste and smell."
"Notes of fresh grass, hay, lemon zest and green pepper. There is nothing malty about it - it's all about freshness, green grass and dry finish."
"Overall the glass is empty before I realized it. really good, light, and refreshing."
"An excellent German Pilsner. We've got a customer who has bought nearly 10 cases of this this year and I can see why!"
"High drinkability for those who like pilsners; not my style, so I wasn't impressed enough to really enjoy this beer as it didn't separate itself from any other German pilsner. It went down very easy, but was just very basic to me."
"D: This is a really nice German Pilsener. Rich bitterness balanced with malt - really, really nice."
"A staple at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Bright and clear gold with a dense white cap, this is a great looking beer. It smells great too, spicy and grassy noble hops at the forefront with a clean lager yeast character beneath. The hops smell bold and fresh, nearly overwhelming the light pilsner malt backbone. Dry and sharp on the palate, zesty and spicy hop flavors are prominent. There's a sturdy but extremely dry and clean malt profile; in fact, this is a remarkably clean beer in general. The finish is long and very bitter and sharp, showing just enough restrain to make it quaffable and refreshing."
"Wow, this beer really impressed me. Excellent for the style. Supremely drinkable."
"D: see above, even better that it's under 5% abv."
"Pours a pretty clear golden yellow with a decent white head. Malty aroma has firm fruity tone that is mainly apple and banana and just a bit sweet. Malty, slightly fruity-sweet flavor is rather pleasing. Smooth, somewhat tingly texture leaves a fruity, subtly sweet finish."
"I find the drinkability to be good. All in all, it may not exhibit astounding qualities but there is enough complexity & interesting things going on to make this quite an enjoyable beer. I would not at all mind having it again."
"O: Easy, nothing special but nice to drink."
"The beer pours a very light yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is corn, wheat, skunk and grassy hops. The flavor is wheat, pilsener malt and grass. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The beer smelled a lot more skunked than it tastes, but it was still very disappointing overall."
"Drinkability is really good. I've been drinking a lot more lagers than I'm used to recently, but I have to say that this beer adds, rather than detracts from the experience. I would definitely get this again."
"Notes: This isn't the most impressive German pilsener I've ever had, however it is one of the purest, and maybe most authentic to history. It was supposed to showcase a very pale light clean beer. Well this is it."
"nb-this review was written with the beer served very cold."
"The body was typical and drinkability would have been decent if not skunked. In all honesty, I would need to try this fresh to be fair to it. As it is, if you see it, avoid it."
"As with most of the European imports, I'd like to try one fresh from the brewery. I feel that the transport has probably affected this brew in some ways."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I thought it was good for a lighter beer"
"Despite the cons, it's actually quite drinkable and I'm hoping that the past-due-itude and maybe light infiltration has to do with the funk. I'll gladly try it again."
"D - Very nice pilsener that would be welcome at any backyard barbecue. A tad shy on character, but that's what adds to the drinkability."
"Easily the least offensive ""green glass"" German Pilsener I have had in a long time...perhaps ever."
"Jever seems to be a typical Northen German beer. Primarily a local/regional pub beer."
"D: this is a great example of a pilsner, and I am shocked that it has such a low score. It is flavorful and well balanced, and worthy of more attention. If someone doesn't like pilsners as a whole, then they shouldn't be reviewing the beer at all."
"Poured a pee yellow with good carbonation and a light wite head. Nose is grains, sknuky. Taste is very much unappealing. Notes grains, thin feel. Mouthfeel is rather thin, rough around the edges, skunky and not so good. Bitter hops leave an aftertaste. Not one I would drink again or recommend."
"refreshing, minty-hop bite with a lingering finish of yeast, malt. nice. stealthily shifts to a dry aftertaste. interesting. not complex, but not simple either. at first i thought the sweetness would stick around cloyingly, but not at all. loving the bitter afterburn. a nice change from the american 'pils' from victory and sam adams (simply different breeds, of course). crisp yet smooth without a sense of thinness (despite the light color and general 'un-heaviness' it sugests). a very nice pils. very quaffable. in quantites. but best with food i bet."
"Definitely a sessionable brew."
"Not recommended, even as change of pace beer."
"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a combination of sweetness and skunky. Taste is crisp, slightly sweet, finishing a tad bitter. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre beer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, there are others in the style that I would pick first but this is still a decent beer to drink for a while."
"i had this at a bar before attending a wine event. I felt I needed a beer before a night of wine. I was not familiar with this beer and overall not impressed. However, one thing that was interesting was the uniquely fruity aroma and flavor that was more reminiscent of a kolsch than a pilsner. I would try it again but not sure how many times after that."
"A basic pilsner; the crispness & refreshment factors are there, but flavor a bit basic and in the end, no different than the hundreds of other German & Czech pilsners on the market."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Very clear pale yellow in color with a decent head and laced OK. The aroma says German pilsner but I found this to be a very dry and bland tasting beer. I had picked it up from seeing it in the '300 beers to drink' book but I really think there are a lot better brews out there than this one. It was drinkable."
"Great pairing to a delicious beef carpaccio with spargel and swiss cheese. One of the spargel specials - and pilsener is great with spargel."
"Very solidly drinkable--I would love to try it fresh on tap, but the bottle is for sure my stand-by on late nights in Berlin."
"Overall, very easy to drink alone or pair with food. A good pilsener, but not a great one. Worth a try for the dry twist in the style."
"D: Overall, fair. I was hoping for amazing greatness, but such things are elusive here. Still, a nice pilsener that is something beyond the everyday. I see this great with roasted peanuts, light summer fare, or cheese pizza. I'm not going to run out and get more of this right now, but if I were looking for an easy pilsener I'd have it again without thinking twice."
"The feel is quite crisp and the body is light."
"Pale straw color with an off-white, bubbly head that hangs around in a small layer for a long time. The aroma is musty but pleasant, a hint of malt but mostly a faint hoppy aroma. Tastes surprisingly nice given it's so-so aroma. The hops are great and are blended nicely with the malty flavor. Crisp, dry, and very refreshing with a respectable bready body to it. All I could think about was how great this would be with a salmon steak. Perfect for seafood."
"Overall a classic German Pils which must be the benchmark for the 'dry' example. Hops are masterfully used not only in the scent & flavor, but the texture as well. Possibly one of the finest examples of subtle hop utilization I've ever tried. World Classic."
"D: This beer is fantastic, glad I finally saw it show up in CA, I should have bought more than the one single. It could give the legendary Reality Czeck a run for its money, and that's saying something. A great surprise. The preeminent example of the German style."
"Drank from the bottle on the porch on a warm afternoon. Crisp and clean traditional pils style, pours golden and light, minimal head. Was told by a few German friends that this beer is BIG in Germany, right up there with Warsteiner for the locals. Easy, drinkable and classic. Not much complexity, but it's a German Pilsnser and will be continued to be consumed by this advocate."
"The taste is light and clean with a nice bitterness from the hops. Seems very balanced. A great ""lighter"" beer! I could see myself drinking these in multiples. I wish I had picked up more than just one!"
"Good Pils...Friesland is special to me. My uncle's name beings with Fries... (he was also born in Deutschland...US Army Parents.)"
"D: Overall a very solid german pils. A solid, refreshing beer for a nice warm day. Not as complex as what the american craft brewers have been pulling off with this style, but a good find nonetheless."
"Pours a light golden with a thin, pure, white head that leaves some scant lacing. Smells fresh, slightly grainy and with a nice bitter snap. The taste is also crisp and bitter with a nice snap. If anything the tight bitterness grows on the finish. Extremely refreshing and less soft than I remember this being on tap. Really a lovely porch beer on a hot day. excellent use of hops married to a crisp pilsner, with none of the softness of the Czech style. Excellent."
"D Not terrible, but I had to force myself to finish my pint, worth trying but I won't have it again"
"I had this beer a long time ago, and didn't enjoy it so much. Now with a more mature palate, I can say this is a good example of the German Pils variety."
"D: If those ShamWow commercials taught me anything, it's that the Germans always make good stuff. This isn't the best pils I've ever had, but it's a fine example regardless."
"D - Very easy to drink several of these, would make for a good lawn mowing beer. A very decent Pilsener, much better than any of the American Macro's."
"golden pour with a nice tight head that eventually dissipates. mild pilsner, grass, straw. quite musky. that is the headline of the beer. a nice straw musk that seems to make the beer. give it an earthy quality. a nice bitter finish. well balanced... mild apple malt, honey. peppery pilsner with an earthy quality to it. dry. good carbonation. would like to see a bit more minty quality."
"A worthwhile beer, but one that needs a lot more malt for balance and drinkability."
"Had this on tap at the Capital Ale House in Richmond Downtown. Pours a nice golden color in a pilsner glass. It had a soft hoppy floral smell. Quite soft in the taste and ends with a nice crispiness. Got the same floral tase in the finish with a good amount of dryness. Quite easy to drink. A pretty good example of the German pilsner style. Will try again."
"Drinkability: It could be a bit fresher and would probably be much better on tap, though this still was fairly solid."
"Tastes is full of those hops in the German use of the plant, not the American overwhelming destroyer hops. An easy drinker and fizzy light mouthfeel. Some interesting soft floral tones add complexity. Slightly musty. Likely better fresh from the tap, but not too bad from the bottle."
"The taste is soft, light flavour with a faint bready-honey malt base under very dominant hops, withherbal-floral hop flavour being light and airy again but without much competition from the malt. The hop bitterness is not truly strong but again has little competition and the herbal-grassy, almost medicinal, bitterness (with faint hint of lemon rind) sticks all around the mouth, dominating from start to finish and lingering stuck to the sides of the toungue and cheek. In the right circumstances, it could be very satisfying but overall is too light in character and the bitterness, though not strong, is too insistent."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. One inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, very slight hops, and some pale malt. Fits the style of a German Pilsener. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast cleanliness, and a slight metallic flavor. Overall, nothing I would try again, and not a good example of a German Pilsener."
"Drinkability: A nice, refreshing drinkable pils with no discernable faults and some pleasant virtues. I could easily have several servings of this one. A nice clean well made pilsner style beer."
"I first became aware of Jever through Michael Jackson's book and I have sought this beer for years."
"The beer poured a light yellow with a two-finger head and lots of visible carbonation. The nose is kind of similar to a macro, with a bit of hops. The taste is a tiny bit of malt followed by a surprising amount of fairly bitter hops with some floral and citrus notes. The mouthfeel is a a little thin with a decent amount of carbonation. This is a pretty average beer, worth a try if you can get it for cheap."
"Thus the score above. After purchasing a $12 six-pack of this beer to compare to other pilseners in a tasting, this was rated the worst beer out of 14; all because it was horribly skunked."
"Poured from the bottle a reddish golden with thin white head that lasted for much of the glass and left good lacing. Nose is grainy, similar to a macro, and the mouthfeel of this medium bodied beer is somewhat tingly. Flavor is an odd mix of grain, chocolate and tobacco, all of which led to a short dry finish"
"This beer is can be identified by it's extremely herbal smell and taste. It has a nice golden color with a white head. The extremely herbal taste causes for a very bitter reaction. In order to maximize the taste from this beer it is strongly recommended that it be poured into a tulip or pilsener style glass."
"Notes: A decent brew. I could have a few on a really hot day,but nothing special going on here."
"Recent discovery as I move thru the thousands of world beers. Found it at our local Consumer Beverages Beer store in WNY. This is a local establishment that has LOTS of international and microbrew beers available for retail sale.. Pleasant Taste, little hoppy, short head foam, maybe I'll find it at Ocktoberfest in Munich next year...as usual, if it tastes good, I drink it.."
"D: The finish just seems a little off. Not that the bitterness is wrong necessarily, but just not quite balanced in my opinion. It's crisp and refreshing, but not all that delicious honestly."
"Taste wise, one of the best german pils I have had. It is very unique, which is hard to achieve in pils. Very clean, easy drinking, with great lingering flavours."
"Not a bad German Pilsner. I would like to see the beer get shipped in a brown bottle so when it sits on the shelf it's a little more protected from the light."
"A very drinkable German pils."
"I am not sure how many IBU's Jever has, but it is substancial for a Pilsner I would imagine. The mouthfeel leaves something to be desired, but in summation this beer is light refreshing and goes great with seafood. I would recommend this one in the spring or summer if you wanted to cool down."
"Bright golden in appearance more lively caronation from German Pilseners tonigth oh yeah. Jever is one of those brews I've been meaning to try for a long time since early on in my beer drinking however I now see green bottled industrial Euro pils versus handcrafted small brewery that I have dreamt of. Head forms thick after a vigorous pour fine even lacing just completely sticks to the sides of pint. Aroma is full of moderate sweet cereal grains pale biscuit and slight honey tones come through with a dry heaping load of hop bitterness in their as well, much more Saaz in this situatino. Flavor is full of bitter skunked hop flavor damn green bottles, I wouldn't fear this bottle as much if it weren't for the damn green bottle. I see on the website they make this in cans, that would be ideal for a round of golf or summer concert. Mouthfeel is full of more dryness and spicy hop character with clean crisp carbonation providing burps in my direction. Drinkability is solid all around not the best version of a German pils but I can see why it's looked up to in many folks journey to find fantastic beer."
"On tap. Good lacing. Neutral aroma and appearance. a little yellow,drying.Below average mouthfeel. Nothing to write home about. Tad of hops, lawnmower.Wasn't horrible but flavour is minimal and not too drinkable. I wasn't getting much here, maybe on a different night."
"Recommended..."
"D: Wouldn't be bad to put down with some food. The carbonation is a little insane, but it's drinkable."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable, though perhaps not more so than average for the style. I've had better pilseners, and considering this is a style that has a very definite place and time, it's probably not one I'd seek out again, but I don't regret buying it once."
"This is one of my favorite beers! When you get tired of IPAs, DIPAs, IS, Trappist and all that - you can always go to Jever."
"I've had better pils and doubt I would pick up Jever again given there are other offerings readily available in my area."
"D-any number of these would be wonderful at any given time or place,solid light German brew"
"Drinkability - a good summer pick, right tasty on-tap, and a nice change of pace from all the OFest style beers."
"Pours a brilliantly clear light to medium straw color with plenty of dense, moussey white head. Aromas of fresh grain, graham cracker, a little sulfur, floral Hallertau hops (though muted). On the palate, the light pils malt presence dominates while a firm bitterness, medium floral hop flavor and a very dry finish. A very refreshing beer, perhaps a little old, not nearly as good as some domestic examples (Prima Pils and Brooklyn)."
"D: It's odd that while I don't find this beer to be exceptional in any way, I can easily see myself drinking this beer any time I wanted a Pils. It was very easy to drink and I liked it enough that I would return for another."
"drinkability is good. there is decent flavor here, with mildly impressive compexity despite a very simple palate."
"A crisp but certainly not clean feel along with a starchy character that leans toward dry. I suppose more husky than normal dry, but you get the picture (maybe). An odd buttery texture kind of lingers. The drinkability is decent I guess with an ABV just under 5%, but trust me I doubt I'll be drinking another one any time soon."
"Jever poured straight from a tap comes out an almost transparent gold with a one finger white head straight into a Jever glass. The hops and wheat aromas were present. Lemon, lime, and other citrus flavors pulled through with a hoppy after note. It was a refreshing beer and very easy to drink. Great for a session beer."
"A very nice pilsener. Probably one of the more bitter pilseners I've had, but nothing short of delicious."
"Hmmmm. This wasn't a terrible Pils but everything just seemed kind of subdued at times. I'd definitely like to revisit this in a keg sometimes, as I don't think the green bottle did it any favors."
"The green bottle of Jever Original Friesland Pilsner dons a simple yet attractive green and gold label. The beer pours a clear pale golden color. The aroma is a balanced mixture of grassy hops and pale malt with a slight twist of lemon. The beer is light and highlights a bitter dryness throughout. A slight hint of breadiness provides some balance as the beer finishes quick and dry. Overall, I think it would be refreshing on hot summer day."
"D: Disappointing and not very drinkable, bland flavor. overall less then average in every category."
"D - Would definitely like to try this again. I think this one was tapped at the end of the keg. However, I didn't get charged for the beer, which was nice!"
"I've been looking to try this on-tap (no green bottles allowed) and was quite pleased. It looked a clear gold with a little white lacing and had a mild, sweet grainy aroma that reminded more of a Czech pils like Budvar. But then in the taste there was a relative hops explosion, or at least a bitterness on par with SNPA. It was big, grassy, herbal hops malted with a balancing light caramel malt - very tasty. There was a very pleasant lingering bitterness you can't usually find in mass-produced pilsners, but damn, there it was. Al in all a winner. One of the better pilsners I've tried."
"M + D: Moderate carbonation, a bit of zing... I've had this before and recall it being a bit sweeter & smoother. This particular bottle seemed like it may have been rather skunked. I look forward to re-reviewing it in the near future, but this one ended up being the first beer (other than notable, poor quality macros) that I have poured half-through. Unfortunate."
"An excellent example of a german pilsner; unfortunately, I don't think this beer travels well in a green bottle. It would have been better to taste this one from a brown bottle."
"bright gold with a fluffy white head that held fairly well and left some nice lace. nose was hoppy. kind of funky and stinky and musty with a mildly sweet malt backbone. taste was the same. hops played the main role with a mild malty thing happening. nice dry, bitter finish. on the heavy side of light bodied. very food friendly and a great refresher."
"D - Not my first choice of Pilsener, but for my first taste this wasn't too bad. I would like less acidity in the hop flavor. I could drink several of these in a session, since they are not overly malty the hop flavor gives a certain dryness that makes it better than average drinkability wise."
"Review translated from french 5-27-2008."
"A nice easy to drink beer that went well with our meal selsection"
"A decent beer (for a pilsner). It has the light vegetable, light malt, light straw color that you'd expect. Mainly a clean brew with slight noble hop character. Not skunked. Perhapse a bit of graininess, acidity, and sulfer-like aromas. Flavors are pretty mellow and viscous for a pils. A good beer to enjoy with a pizza or a hot dog."
"D: Easy to drink as it has not real character, but it would only really be good as a bar or party drink not a beer for enjoying by itself."
"Overall - A pretty good Pils... worth a try..."
"Lay this one on your boring lager drinking buddies and they won't know what hit them. Jever pilsener is, to my mind, one of the classic interpretations of the German style."
"A good solid pils that I'm likely to return to again."
"Overall a very good Pils. Very spicy and easy to drink."
"d: Unbalanced and clumsy"
"Crystal clear straw yellow with a fluffy, frothy white head. Aromas of zesty, grassy noble hops, graham cracker malts, and subtle honey. Crisp and clean, light bodied and refreshing. Dry, bitter hoppiness supported by a nice, solid grainy sweetness. Good Pils."
"The body is fairly light. A small bit sweet up front but finishes quite dry. Crisp carbonation lends a hand to the bitter hops flavor. Good balance between hops and malts, if not a bit skewed towards the hops. Very easy to drink. I could easily drink a six pack of this on a hot summer's day (and tomorrow is officially the first day of summer here, so I might have to pick up a whole sixer)."
"Pours a pale golden color with a fantastic pillowy white head that left plenty of lacing on the glass. I could smell the cracker like malt and grassy/hay-like hops from the pour. I could almost smell how dry this brew will be. The taste is of dry malt and grassy hops, has an almost skunky taste to it. The feel is dry and crisp. While it's dry it isn't astringent, leaves a little bitter taste on the tongue. A fine example of a dry and grassy pilsner and one worth trying, though not sure I could drink too many of these in a sitting."
"This is one kick ass Pilsner, probably the best one Ive come across yet. A hophead's Pils."
"The beer begins with the fear that the green bottle has given way to the power of the sun and wants to serve up skunk ass statt hops. Fortunately my fears were quickly calmed by a beautiful straw colored Pils topped by soft fine bubbled head. The head was my partner through the beer test as it stayed until the last drop to make sure I had smile on face.and I did. The aroma and flavor are unmistakably Friesisch-herb. The hops are very herbal, part spearmint and part floral. This pairs nicely to a brisk malt aroma. The flavor profile follows the aroma like its twin. Upfront is a burst of hop bitterness and flavor that is neither mild nor overwhelming. I guess that means nicely down the middle. This beer is Northern German and this means two things in comparison to the Pils in the pretty part of Germany (The south ;).ein Witz). Much drier and more bitter. (General Guidelines of course) The malt plays a background role but plays its part nicely and adds support to a beer that would be one dimensional without the support. This beer is all about hops; even the aftertaste is a dry hop flavor that urges you to drink more to quench your thirst. Unfortunately this becomes a vicious cycle and before you know it the Kister is empty. Not the best Pils in the country (not even close actually) but lives up to its reputation. I hope this beer in the green bottle is able to find you in good shape. (I mean both you and the bottle.) Zum Wohl!"
"Pours a clear pale straw color with a medium thick and fizzy white head that burns away rapidly. Patchy lacing. Aroma of mild hops and hay. Light-bodied and effervescent with a dry mouthfeel. Lightly bitter hops and sour fruit flavors are pretty much the only flavors. The finish is dry and hoppy with some sweetness coming through. Not as easy to drink as most Pilseners. Fairly average all around."
"Drinkability was moderate. This beer was light, refreshing and could pair perfectly with a variety of dishes, yet the intensely dry and bitter finish was a bit overwhelming."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear golden yellow color, with a small white head which goes away very quickly. The aroma is very grainy, with some skunkiness. It tastes sour, and like grain, metal, skunk, and a bit of grassy hops. Not very impressive at all. Mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation. Drinkability isn't good at all, too much skunkiness. I'll have to revisit this in the future, but this bottle wasn't good at all. And this was even after having drank a few other beers tonight. Not recommended."
"This is an unusual pilsner, one worth trying."
"Crisp. That one word sums up the best qualities of Jever. I've rarely had a beer as crisp and satisfying as this. The beer pours a clear yellow gold with a snow white head. The aroma is typical pilsener. There's a noticable hop bite at first, pleasant but not overpowering. After the initial hop sensation, there's a pleasant maltiness that's enough to give flavor but not enough to cloy. The taste ends with a crisp dryness, setting you up for the next pleasing sip. The drinkability is off the charts with this one. I sat down with one Jever to drink as I wrote my review; I had finished 4 before I finsihed the review. If you're looking for a Pilsener, look no further."
"Drinkability: Very good beer to have on a cold and/or damp day. Not a quenching beer you'd want after, say, jogging, but more of a beer to reflect on and take away the chill in the air. This beer is one of the more expensive German sixers you'll buy, and consequently the turnover rate may not be too high. Therefore, the freshness may be questionable. (Mine tasted a bit past its peak, but still very good). That said, this is an excellent beer, and even better on draught at a good German bierstube. Worth seeking out!"
"Rerated from green bottle: Poured golden and pure, with a solid white foam head. Verrry pilsner-hoppy aroma with a big starch undertow. Smooth with that uniquely German yellow-beer starchiness ... its not off-putting necessarily, but its clearly something that for some reason surfaces only in mass-produced beers. Ive downgraded this over my original rating, but this still stands as a good example of a northern German pils, nicely bittered with a solid sweet starchy current beneath it. My original rating (I was much less verbose whenever this was!): Import on draft: golden and still with a solid head. Solid consistency and vaguely bittered, smooth and nice finish."
"Pours a nice clear golden color with a 1"" off-white fluffy head, some sticky lacing and decent retention. Smell is hoppy and bitter. Taste is bitter noble hops up front, finishing smooth with nicely balanced malt backbone. Grainy taste as well, with a bit of a burnt taste, which gives it a bit of a skunky quality, although I think that is intentional so I'm not going to detract for it. Leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but is smooth and crisp on the palate. Not a bad German pilsener but not my favorite."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. It's not terribly observant of style -- it leaves other German pilsners in the dust in terms of bitterness and power -- but it is, to mangle a phrase, its own beer. Unique, confident, and daring you to like it. Wonderful."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Extremely light in body, the effervescence gives just enough tingle to keep this from being just average. It's a damn easy beer to session, with enough of a bite to warrant the next sip. This is a beer that calls for ""less geekin and more dreenkin!"""
"A nice hoppy lager overall. Hard to say how much the potential oxidation was hurting, or if it was just exceptionally bitter. In any case, a bit harsh for a session beer."
"Not impressed with this one. I should know, ""never drink anything in a green bottle"". It let's light through and ruins the beer making it skunky. This one was skunky, very light, and left a Heinekenesk aftertaste. Probably had good ingredients, but couldn't taste them. Straw color but poured not a head, like a beck's or heineken. Tasted of some malts, few hops but very skunky bitter. Not recommended."
"I'm very disappointed that this wonderful Pilsener is not available here in Ontario. This is one of those brews that I would say to get if it is available to you as it is quite good. Highly recommended."
"Originally reviwed September 23, 2005. Thin lemon yellow pour, with lots of carbonation and nice super white crisp creamy head. Plain wheaty malt aroma with so depth, but strong. Flavor is more plain malt, with lots of good texture and a few subtle nuances, but no real depth. Some smack of whole grain crackers. Palate is a little dry. Finishes smooth and clean. A little hoppy metallic taste that makes this beer a tinge off."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a modest head that lingers well. Malt and hops evident in the smell. Taste is crisp and clean with mellow hops and a very smooth finish. A very drinkable brew that is well balanced and quite enjoyable. Not quite on a par with Prima Pils, but quite good."
"Drinkability - a hot weather beer. No more, no less."
"Below average. No complexity. Thin weak body and mouthfeel. Again hints of lemongrass, but lacking any substance. More of the saaz in the mouth and malt would have been welcoming and spiced things up a little."
" Wavz"
"Aftertaste long, bitter, pleasant. Probably an unbalanced beer, but an enjoyable and very drinkable one. Recommended!"
"M&D: as crisp and clean as anyone could hope for, this is a medium-bodied and undoubtedly the most dry and bitter pilsener I've tried. As a convert to much hoppier and aromatic Czech Pils myself, surprisingly I find this beer very enjoyable. And I'm sure the draught version could well become one of my favourites for this style!"
"Jever Pilsener isn't world-class, but neither does it deserve to be overlooked. It's solid across the board and is a worthy purchase for those looking for a clean, crisp, noble hoppy pils from a venerable German brewery."
"If you like hoppy pilsner, this beer is for you!"
"I liked it - and if it were more widely available here, I would gladly take it over some of the more common German lagers like Beck's, Krombacher, Warsteiner, Bitburger."
"This is a good example of a pilsner, though nothing extraordinary. It poured a straw-yellow with a decent head. It had a moderate to heavy carbonation. It tasted very grainy (grassy) and somewhat hoppy. Overall, it had a refreshing taste. One of the better pilsners from Germany, IMO."
"I have no problems drinking this, but just an average pils overall."
"Green 12 oz bottle. Poured into a pilsner glass. The beer is an incredibly clear light straw color with a finger of white head that falls to a full coat over top. A very active carbonation boils from the bottom of the glass, helping maintain the head. As the head receded to a light coat, it left a good bit of solid lacing on the glass. Initailly the nose was big in the green bottle mercaptain skunkyness. After letting it sit, I find solid grainy character from the pilsner malt with just a touch of honey sweetness. There is a touch of herbal noble hop in there, but the pilsner malt is dominant. Flavor is definately dominated with grainyness. This is followed by a light herbal hop and a mild biterness and a light metallic flavor on the finish. I'd like the hop flavor to be more prevalent in this. The feel is light with a moderate carbonation. This one is an okay pilsner. I don't think I would go out of m way for it again, but I wouldn't turn it down."
"This, to me, is one of the better German pilsners I've had in a while. I'd do a case of this anytime."
"Mouthfeel is light and a bit dry with plentiful bubbles throughout. Goes down smooth and has a nice body for a pilsener. The metallic twang leaves me not wanting another. I was happy to try it, but it's not something I'd personally seek out again. Thanks to kmpitz2 for tossing me this one."
"Pours with a three-finger white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is hoppy/skunky. Starts hoppy and bitter, stays that way at the finish and leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. $1.95 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"a long while back this brew used to be sold in 33cl bottles at the discount shop on the corner ... it used to be my favorite back then, light straw colour, great taste, and especially the long lasting rough tingling dryness on the tongue .... meanwhile I only get it in the specialised shop (Drinks of the World) which is also described on this site and where I have to get special brews at a less moderate price these days ..."
"The taste is very crisp, hop accented, malt at first just a shadow, but eventually a bready, grainy malt emerges. The herbal, bitter hops remains the feature of this pils. Light bodied, sharp and tangy. It finshes dry. A fine thirst quencher."
"A good pils but not a great one."
"Jever would be a reasonable summer beer if the skunk didnt ruin the picnic."
"I had mixed expectations about this brew, but found it to be solidly refreshing and enjoyable. It pours a deep gold color: exceedingly clear, with a brilliant white head. The aroma is full of bready malts, mixed with floral, herbal hops. Slightly grassy, and just a hint of earthy, sulfury, mustiness. The taste is malty, and full of bread-like character. This quickly subsides into a brisk, abrupt hop kick. Finishes with a decidedly bitter snap. Refreshing and solid. I enjoy a good German Pilsner, and this one is worth trying again."
"Poured out a light golden color with a huge white foamy head. Smell consisted of hops, grass, some light oranges, and a very, very faint skunky smell, but didn't affect anything. Taste was alright. Started out quite bitter, good for a pils. Grassy hops in the beginning, with some grains and malts mixing in the middle, and ends with some spicy hops. Quite good. Mouthfeel was light-medium and slighty overcarbonated. Not bad. This beer has to be fresh though."
"This is a very drinkable pilsner. One of my favorites, and I love the signature glass."
"In the aftertaste the hop again, strong and persistent."
"Mouthfeel. Prickley carbonation is great. Makes the beer very drinkable and smooth with food. Drinkability is good. I would not drink this all night.. well maybe. The hops in this are very distinct and spicy floral.. good stuff all around"
"Blinding sun-yellow, grainy and biscuit nose, tiny and stringy carbonation. An initial blast of Hallertau (German) hops that become a bit bitter. Very dry and thirst-quenching. Some oats and biscuit-like offerings marry well with the hops. Finish is dry, slightly metallic, creamy and lip-smacking good! An outstanding pilsner, highly drinkable."
"It is what it is."
"Now for the taste... the mild sweet flavor is helped greatly by a spicey hop finish. Much more crisp and flavorful than most pilsners, and maybe even a little too bitter for me for this style (but I'd take overly bitter with flavor over lack of flavor any day). The carbonation is just right, and the beer pairs nicely with burgers & sausages. Of course, I'm reviewing this in the middle of winter... I'd might just rate it higher if I was enjoying this brew at a mid-summer BBQ..."
"This one seems to be unique for its color and the readily apparent hops."
"Light gold in color with a snow-white, fairly long lasting head and some sticky lace. The aroma of fresh cut hay with a herb garden smells. Fresh hop, a faint sulfuric smell and a faint maltiness. The malt body is somewhat light and has a clean herbal and slightly grainy character. The abundantly applied Hallertau hops are spicy, lightly citrusy and a bit metallic, creating a bit of a back of the throat edginess and bite. The taste of hard water adds to the intense bitterness."
"This is the other hipster-du-jour beer in Brooklyn, along with PBR. Everybody drinks it thinking they are drinking something exotic, but they are really just drinking Heineken with a cool sounding name and matching glassware. Clean, clear golden-yellow color. Classic pilsener nose: slightly skunky, cat-pee, herbal, and floral. Taste differs very little from the aroma. Heavy on the skunkiness, like a Heineken, but with a bit more character. Clean, crisp, lively finish, pretty decent German hops profile. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated with a bit more body than one might expect. Could be a good session brew if you're into this sort of thing, but it's best paired with some spicy food or sausages. Average in every way."
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a 1"" white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a slightly grainy pale malt scent with a dry yeast finish and a bit of skunkiness. The taste is awful. It has a watery pale malt flavor with a little bitterness and a dry finish. It goes down cleanly, but has a horrible aftertaste. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average pilsner. It lacks flavor and mouthfeel. It's one and done for me."
"Pours a light gold with with a pretty large head that settled pretty quickly into a soapy like top,a nice fresh aroma of grass and ""green"" herbs along with a slight iron note but its very slight.Taste is quite bitter and herbal a big dose of hops in this pilsner just lightly sweet after awhile but the hops are most prevalent in this brew thats for sure.A interesting pilsner quite bitter but a real quaffer would go down real easy on summer day the bitterness is quite refreshing,a nice beer."
"Extremely light yellow with good carbonation...nice white head tops this offering. Smell is lightly hoppy. Taste is lightly sweet initially then finishes in a sharp bitter hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slight creaminess. Drinkability is what you woul dtypically expect in a Pils...crisp....good for a hot day."
"Another nose of cereal, hamster cereal, dried and compressed bitter greens formed into a ring then thrown into a box with oats and millet and squash seeds. It's resinous--like the smell on your fingers after stemming and seeding a bag of purple shorthair--until it warms up a bit and a mellow natural sugar bases the bitter vein of iron that extends half an hour beyond the last sip. A quality pils along the lines of Veltin's and EKU."
"This is one I'd been looking forward to giving a try, mostly since everyone said this was the hop pils to give a try. Well, now that I've had it, it's certainly good, with a better-than-average hop bite to it. Though it doesn't quite reach the level of the great American pilsners, this is still a damn enjoyable beer, one that I'd have again, and proof that something good can come in a green bottle!"
"Had this in the bottle while in Germany, and gave it a 3.5%. This rating is for the on-tap version, which I recently enjoyed at Redbones...hmm, I do like beers on-tap. Anyway, no surprise at the color, clear golden yellow when served, I was able to enjoy watching the slowly rising carbonation. I also liked the perfumey hop aroma it came with. Medium bodied, I found slight crispness and some sweetness from the malt. I also have written in my notes a bit of a woody note...over-all, more enjoyable on tap here in the US."
"12 ounce bottle, with best before dating on the label.. Pours very light golden, crystal clear, white medium bubble head, leaves moderate lacing. Nose is grassy, lemony, almost a hint of mint. Crisp, snappy and clean, as expected from any decent pilsner. Finishes with a nice smooth hoppy crispness. All together a decent, if not amazing lager. Enjoyable with some spicy summery fare."
"Crisp, goes down easy with mild malt presence at the end, but overall bland and unflavorful. Not worth the effort of a return visit."
" Not something I would go out of my way to get, but decent."
"Pours your average pils color with a typical white head. Big fresh, hoppy nose of the Hallertau variety. Dimethyl sulfide evident but not offly so. Dry and spicy hop profile paired with sweet malts, but not too sweet. Very distinguished. Wickedly drinkable. What Czechvar is to the Saaz, Jever is to the Hallertau. Wish it was available in my area."
"Beer is good. Happy pilsener beering."
"Nice soft mouthfeel lets the malt do its best to balance the hops. Quite drinkable, and refreshingly bitter."
"Poured an ultra clear and light yellow-straw color. Bright with a decent amount of carbonation. Creamy head of white foam topped this beer off. Yes! The aroma is pure and good. Bitter graininess and super sharp. Hints of breadiness and citrus fruit. The taste is very clean and sharp with a very crisp finish. I love the simple Pilsner and this is a near perfect example of the style. Somewhat buttery on the tongue with a sharp but pleasant hop bite. This is liquid bread. An excellent Pilsner that I need to buy more often. I can only hope my homebrew comes out nearly as good as this."
"As previously mentioned, this is a very interesting pilsener. Unlike most pilseners I don't think I could partake in a session with this brew. Even though the ABV% is average for the style, this one deserves a bit of contemplation. It affects the drinkabilty somewhat, but this is a brew that should be sampled by all at least once even if lagers are not your thing. Serving this from a brown bottle or (even-better) on tap would improve this tenfold. A good brew that has the potential to be even better."
"The thing that struck me most was the bitterness, both at the front and the back of the mouth, and it remained all the way through. This is too bitter to be a session beer, and struck me as heineiken on steroids. The hop taste is extreme, and very german/chech, although i cannot quite place it by name. A good beer, but not for everybody."
"The mouthfeel was clean and very crisp, and had a super clean finish. No aftertaste at all. This beer is extremely drinkable and was paired perfectly with the potato pancakes I was eating."
"One of my favorite pilsners, this beer is a revelation to the drinker who's grown accustomed to bland, anonymous lagers. Highly recommended."
"In reading the other reviews of this beer I'm hoping that the Jever I was in some way a bad bottle. It poured with a nice foamy head that slowly faded away. The color was a dark yellow and it smelled very dry. I don't know what to say about the flavor other than I thought it was awful. It was the only beer in my sample case that I had to pour our. I know others have said that they liked this beer in reviews but all of the memers in my beer club agreed that we disagree with the reviews on Beer Advocate."
"The most interesting and satisfying German pilsner I have had."
"Pours a light golden color with a really fluffy white head. Smells like a little bit of grain and a hint of skunk. The taste is nice, biscuity maltiness, and a little hopiness with a tiny hint of skunkiness. A free beer given tome by a co-worker, who received it from her sister who received it from a German client."
"Clear gold with just the slightist green tint, under a white one fingered head that lacks real Pils body, but lingers well down the glass and leaves some excellent lacing. The nose is strong, but seems skunky to me - definitely a sour cabbage tone to it. The mouth is very prickly, but carries a decent amount of body. The taste? Yup, there are hops here. Good strong floral hops, with some breadiness for balance. But the bread fades long before the bitter, leaving a wonderful hoppy bite at the back of the jaw. The aftertaste is pure bitter, which definitely appeals to me. Yes, my tastes have changed, and Jever will no longer get the snub from me!"
"This pils poured a clear, yellow color with creamy, white foam that persisted but eventually settled and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was modest: bready malt with a touch of grain. The taste was sweetish malt with floral and bitter hops and a light touch of bread and grain. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a decent pils, though a tad too sweet."
"A friend brought me back a non-widget pint can of this upon his return from his homeland of Germany. It pours a yellow/light golf color with a nice, large white head and it leaves a little lacing on the glass - Very clear body on this one. The aroma is of hay/corn husks, light malts and pleasing hops. Great smelling for a German Pils - no skunkiness here. The flavor is very clean and smooth. It has a nice strong taste upfront that leaves the palate completely bare after a second - very interesting - makes it sooo easy to drink. The upfront taste is filled with soft malts and some slightly spicy hops as well - I detected a nutty taste as well - possibly almonds. Great beer!"
"One of the few choices widely available in Köln for someone who does not want a Kölsch."
"606"
"11.2 oz green bottle, pours pale yellow color with a nice white head that clings to the sides of the glass. Some grassy flowery hop aromas, has a light bready dry hoppy flavor, light to medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel, finishes dry and bitter, a very good pilsner."
"To me this is a good beer to drink on a hot summer day when you do not want anything too heavy. It has that nice German crispness upfront, that leads to a nice dry taste and texture. Not much in the way of color or smell, I found this beer to be a bit on the thin side, but with enough character to warrent a decent rating. It has sort of a tangy and slighty bitter appeal, and certainly goes with all kinds of food. A good session beer, but not great- in my opinion."
"Poured a bright yellow pils color, very little film of a head, and a little film for lace. Not much of a nose, just a trace of hallertauer scents and some toned down florals. Taste was definite Hallertauer and other hops and a little drop of sugar. Had a very thinned out malt and fairly long dry finish. Slid down easy like water. A plain old pilsener but luckily not as bad as an american one, but no czechvar either. Taste and finish weren't that appealing to me."
"Straw gold, good fluffy white head and plenty of condition. Good level of hop aroma with a faint hint of celery, nicely malt sweet with balancing hop flavour and an intensly hop bitter finish that is slightly chalky. In a world of pilseners that all taste the same, this beer is one of the best of its style."
"Its a drinkable pilsner, but the dryness is a little rough in most aspects throughout the taste and feel, and some may be put off by it."
"A very hoppy beer but a beer with balance nonetheless and an unusually deep, solid mouthfeel for a pilsener. The brewing here is a real lesson in how to incorporate a high-hop/bitter element into a brew without that element sort of floating free from the rest of the beer in an ""untamed"" way and coming off as astringent. Really an exceptional beer that you don't see too often in America (at least not often enough) and one that sets a standard for pilseners the world over."
"A pale yellow in color that is crystal clear. Big chunky head that leaves a nice lace to the bottom of the glass. Not much for aroma though. Nice taste that was crisp and clean with a dry hoppy aftertaste. Certainly not the best pilsner but definitely not the worst."
"I prefer this to most others pilseners. When I can find it fresh and not light-struck it's a real treat."
"Used this beer to wash down my plate Königsberger Klopse ..."
"My friend brought me two bottles from Germany. This was one of my favorite beers when I was there 10 years ago. Expires Feb. 5, 2003, printed on the front label...easy to read. Upon breaking the seal, the room fills with an intense smell of sticky hops. There is a beautiful honey, burned suger and nougat maltiness coursing underneath, but from nose to tail this beer is all about the noble bud. ""That's dry."" Bitter, dry, but not out of balance. On the back are the words ""Zutaten: Wasser, Gerstenmalz, Hopfenextrakt, Hopfen."" I'm struggling with my own dogma. Is it OK to add hop extract? It seems like a manipulation. And in fact, the hoppiness, while very entertaining, seems a bit exaggerated, almost cartoonish. I would complain more if I thought they were hiding something, but it seems clear that the other components are very well done. My conclusion is that they are shooting for an extremely hoppy style, which, if they used fresh, or at least whole hops, would be prohibitively expensive. I give this beer high marks for uniqueness and personal sentiment."
"Although this review is for draft, I wanted to point out that the word ""herb"" on the bottled product means ""dry"" or ""bitter"" and is indicative of this North German pilsner's very dry style. Crystal clear and bright golden in color with a bright white head that holds fairly well. Very nice appearance. The aroma is quite hoppy as pilsners go - very noble, lightly grassy and highly floral. Some light, grainy malt aroma is present as well. The body is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. The flavor starts dry with a burst of hop bitterness, warming as it crosses the palate to reveal a firm grainy maltiness, and finishes long and bitter. The emphasis is definitely on hop bitterness with around 45 IBU's! Very one sided in many ways, but also with quite alot of finesse! A somewhat unique, refreshing and enjoyable pils. Very drinkable."
"This is a very good German bier. A very light and crisp looking brew out of the bottle. Nice and effervescent. The smell is not as wheaty as say some, but still very good aroma. The first sip is indicative of things to come. This is what a German Pilsener should be. It brings plenty of flavor and aromatics to the party. One of my favorites. Prost!"
"A mainstay on tap at MacGregor's (my local) for some time. I thought, since I recently visited Germany and had a sort of personal renaissance of German pils/lagers that I would give it a try. As it turned out, it was a perfect way to start out the night before moving on to something a bit more substantial (there's too many choices here to lock into one beer). Light, biscuity grain beneath a lively but reserved hop. Well done and a prime example of the style."
"Notes: Definitely a thirst quencher pils, light enough to suck down on a very hot day while sweating at the bbq grilling some turkey sausages to pair with the next Jever."
"Very good German pils, its bitterness makes up for anything it lacks in its taste, an underated German pils."
