"This is one of those beers made in Austin that just fits with the local climate and tastes. Kudos to ABW."

"O: only had the one pint, so all of this is a first-blush look at the brew, but it's very, very good ... looking forward to trying many more"

"M: You can definitely taste the carbonation which is a little disappointing, but definitely not something to push you away."

"o - overall, another great gateway beer when trying to convert a macro drinker. i just had the kelso pils a bit earlier tonight and that one had a great sweetness that this one is missing. although true to style and leans towards the classic german pils, i find the german pils to be imperfect for my tastes. solid pils, but not something i'll be hunting or stocking."

"'Three' is how many Pearl Snap Pils the brewery says I can drink before I start trying that annoying accent. 'One' is how many it took to make me a huge fan of theirs. Not only can these guys evidently brew, but they're also extremely cool and clever marketers."

"O/D - A nice easy drinker on a cool day. Not much about it that distinguishes it from the rest. Is well done for the style of course. A bit filling at times, abv is right in line."
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink. This works really well as both a warm weather, lawnmower beer, and for spicy foods like Indian or Mexican due to the slight sweetness and crispness."
""
""
"Slightly hazy pale golden color body. Very clean nose. Saaz is apparent. I enjoy the bready flavors and the overall hoppiness, but there's a toastiness that I'm just not feeling. Almost like this was brewed by New Belgium. Mouthfeel is bubbly and full; solid. This would be a pretty solid go-to beer if not for the toastiness. Kinda kills it for me. Solid otherwise."

"As a local Austinite my review seems relevant. I have savored a lot of local beers and Austin Pearl Snap is one of my favorites. Normally I am a fan of IPAs the Austing Pearl Snap is a great Pils but actually tastes very similar to an IPA. Please note that I am not a beer expert, just a regular beer customer."

"Poured on tap, this pours a crystal clear light yellow with a short lived white head. The smells are of grass hops, crisp earthy tones, some malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is good, a nice bitter amount of noble hops along with some clean earthy flavors."

"O - Overall this isnt a bad German Pilsner. On the nose and mouth, the hops are a bit too prominent. The taste though, the hops are a bit faded."
"wonderful take on a classic Pilsner style lager. Best I've had from Texas. Saaz hoppiness rings true and clear. Clean finish, good astringency here. Nice off white head that quickly dissipates. Light straw color and light lace down the glass. Yum! Will buy again."

"O: This is a decent pilsner, but it's not spectacular. It's a bit too bitter in the finish for my liking. I'm pleased to have tried it, but I don't think I;d seek this beer out if it were available in my area."
""
""
""
"This is definitely a drinkable beer. Light on the stomach amd the mouthfeel. Definitely something I could drink 3 or 4 glasses of without realizing it."
""
"Well balanced, easy to drink."

"D ~ Would certainly buy this again. Not a session pils, as I enjoyed sipping this one. One to enjoy. Thanks Reed!"
"Got this in a trade with a friend. 12 ounce can into pilsener glass; no canning date, but I got it recently. Pours almost crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clinging the glass, and plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, grass, floral hops, pepper, herbs, and a bit of biscuit. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of big lemon, biscuit, floral, pepper, herb, grass, and spiciness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, biscuit, herb, pepper, and spiciness on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and very nice mouthfeel that is not thin at all. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish as expected, and very drinkable. Overall this is a highly excellent pilsener, with a ton of nice well balanced flavor. One of the best ones I have had for sure."
""
"O: All in all, I really enjoyed this beer. It would go wonderful with a nice beach or pool. Very good blend from sweet to skunk. A nice job and good impression by Austin Beerworks with this one."
""
""
"O: This one is a winner. It's bang on for the style (IMHO), flavorful and refreshing. I wish the nose were a bit more distinctive, but it's a small complaint."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is another feather in Austin Beerworks cap. It is crisp and dry with a light carbonated bite. I am a big fan of this beer. To me there is nothing better then a simple yet flavorful beer. Combine the fact that it's canned and easy to take with you to the beach or lake and you have my new favorite summer beer!"
"Overall a pretty good example for the style. Very happy to a local Austin brewery produce a quality craft brew. Lookin forward to trying the other styles as well."

"Pours a clear sunny orange color with a nice white head. Lightly sweet aroma of crackers and bread crust, with slight notes of citrus and floral hop notes. Slightly sweeter bread notes on the taste, with a clean, crisp light hop bite on the finish: floral and citrusy. Body is light, with a slight creamy texture, smooth balance and excellent drinkability. Definitely a refreshing and tasty pils."
"""Bread crust and saltine crackers!"" shout the malt. ""Pine sap and minty earth!"" scream the hops, eventually the louder of the two parties. Mineral water and sulfur-y yeastiness lingers in the finish; this pilsener could hang with the best of German offerings. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, light-bodied, dry on the back end, and ultimately drinkable. A fantastic pils to make you fall in love with the style all over again."

"I'm quite happy that the taste departed from the smell significantly. This isn't a style I often spring for, and I haven't found many American versions that I enjoy, but this is solid."
"Oh yea, it is about damn time a Texas brewery nailed a good pilsner, especially considering all the German immigrant heritage near the Hill Country. This one can hang right up there with the best of the Pennsylvania pilsners. Snappy, sharp and crisp with lots of hop flavor and character. Goes down smooth and fast, I am very impressed."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a nice-sized white head. The aroma is a mix of grain and grass with a little bit of citrus mixed in. A very nice smelling beer. The flavor is a mix of grain and bready malt, with some grassy and citrus hops mixed in. I also get a little bit of toffee in the flavor. The bitterness is pretty high for a pilsner but goes with the flavors very well. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer."
"Overall this is a solid Pilsner, much like some of the better Pilsners up here in lake country. If I lived in the Austin area I might buy this regularly. So if you do live in the Austin area I would advise giving this a try. Cheers!"
"I am not a fan of the style but this one completely won me over. Really digging ABW offerings."
"This is really, a good choice to pick up. Hopefully I'll be seeing it more of it, and other ABW beers, more widely available in the upcoming weeks."
"Mouthfeel - Light and snappy with a good crisp feeling."
"O: A pretty nice, easy to drink pils. Good flavor and aroma."
"O: Definitely not what I was expecting from a ""German Pilsner", but I still really enjoyed it."
"There was not any problems with the mouthfeel or the aftertaste. It was quite crispy, and it is definitely something i will want to take with me when I go disc golfing or even tubing down the Guadalupe River! (This along with Peacemaker) I think it's what makes Austin Beerworks appealing for me, and it's the fact that they are selling beers in cans. I don't think there's any local breweries that does this? It's nice to have that option to choose from."
"Overall, a supremely drinkable, crisp, dry and hoppy session beer. One of the best craft pilseners I have tried."
"Overall: It'd rate higher if there was a little more pronounced hop flavor to balance the hop bitterness, or if there was more noticeable malt flavor. It feels good to drink and is certainly refreshing."
"An excellent Pilsener and a welcome addition to the Texas beer scene. Something I will be drinking a lot more of, and would highly recommend. Up there with Stoudts as one of the best Pilseners I have had (though very different interpretations of the style)."
"I really enjoyed it."
"The taste is not nearly as sweet. Hop dominated from the get go. Almost like a lager version of an English IPA... but still distinctly pils. Dry, crisp finish. Much thinner than the Live Oak Pilz, but that fits the beer. Pretty drinkable, but also jolting and interesting. Love ABW's debut so far. Hope I can get their cans in DFW."
"Really happy to have great canned beer from a local brewery!"
"I'll revisit this review on your next batch."
