4.32,13.4,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,"Overall: I'm trying to think when I last had beer from a can and I honestly can't remember. What I do know is that it wasn't nearly as good as this. Cans seem to be making a comeback and if this is typical of a canned craft beer then bring it on. Calling this a proper pils is probably wide of the mark, but as an American interpretation of same it more than stands on its own merits. Well worth tracking down - it'd make a superb summer drink.","interzen","Dec 30, 2014"

(Philadelphia Brewing's Kenziger strikes me as another example of this.) I would not posit this as my go-to for the style, but it ain't bad at all, and I think would session extremely well. Also a good pick to introduce a conservative friend to craft beer -- shouldn't be that far out of anyone's comfort zone. Mildly recommendable.","dougbassett","Aug 17, 2013"

4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"12oz. can courtesy of Soonami. Served in my SA Noble Hops Pilsener glass. Pours the color of straw with a translucent clarity and a creamy 1.5 inch, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid, 1/8th inch skim with textured clumps of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Great nose - clean, grassy and a trace of cereal grain sweetness. Taste expresses noble hops, citrus, cereal grains, a bit of skunk and a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a crisp carbonation and a light acidity from sip to swallow. All and all, a solid Pilsener in my humble opinion. Generally not a go to style for me, but I would drink this regularly if I had regular access.","Jwale73","Aug 12, 2011"

Smell was light, but had nice aroma of lemon citrus and grass hop flavors. The taste was just very good, smooth, and refreshing. Actually had lots of hop character, slight pine and grapefruit. Dry, clean finish. Very good example of this classic german style.

Sharp, drying finish leaves bitter grass notes on the back of the palate. Overall, a tasty beer from Sly Fox and one I would gladly reach for again if given the chance.","wagenvolks","Mar 06, 2011"

A bit of graininess exists, along with some orange peel. This tasty brew is dry on the edges and creamy in the middle which makes for some kickass drinking.

This seems to be a very hoppy pilsener from the aroma. And so it is in flavor as well. All 44 IBUs can be tasted. Very herbal and grassy that made the first sip a bit of a surprise. It seems to get tamer the deeper in the glass I get. The malt is dry and cracker like. Light body with abundant carbonation that stops short of being harsh. Just like a pilsener should be. A light, dry pilsner that has more hops than just about any other beer of this style I have encountered.","morimech","Sep 16, 2010"

Malts are very light and I would not be surprised to learn that no specialty malts were used in this beer. Hop bitterness and flavor are about equal and the finish is quite dry. Good pilsner, PA folks are lucky to have so many.","twiggamortis420","May 01, 2010"

The color is a clear and light orange and only slight carbonation. The smell initially reminded me of the BMCs, but after the head subsided I was able to get a whiff of pleasant malt and some sweetness. Slightly bitter, I taste none of the malt and sweetness that I got from the smell, just the bitterness. very thin on the palate and almost no aftertaste this beer is only slightly a cut above a Miller Genuine draft.

The aroma is of pale malts, a bit bready, and light grassy hops, a touch sweeter than expected. The taste seems to be spot on for a German Pils. A light cracker like malt, with some bitter stale grassy noble hops, a bit metallic and hints of honey. Seems to be more bitter than most Pils and dry, perhaps this is a take on the Northern German Pils, like Jever. A solid body, holds well on the palate, very dry with a bitter finish; typical pils.

The smell is typical of a pilsner ( a little malt and a sulphury smell) but it has a noticeable hop presence that is very nice. The taste is just right. You get a nice bit of the traditional sulphury pilsner taste down the middle of the palate and then sweet malt, corn and flavorful hops on the side. Its actually even got a nice mouthfeel for a pils.

Nice light lemon and grass flavors, with a hint of yeast and grain. The taste was just great, smooth, big carbonation made it very refreshing. Very very hoppy for a pilsner with a nice pine resin flavor and hints of grapefruit, and pineapple and lemon. Big dry finish that was nice and bitter.

The taste is decent as well. It's got a wonderful hop bitterness along with a solid malt bill. My problem is that it's too hoppy and malty. I like a lighter pils.

Brew poured from the can to a clear light golden color, maybe more yellow with a medium sized white head that had some retention which left some lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma is very nice, has a snap to it which I would imagine come from Saaz hops. While the hop note is the most noticeable I am also able to pick up a doughy/biscuit sweet scent. The taste is nice, very fresh feel, highlighting grass, slightly citrus with a biscuit malt taste, though that seemed to be more evident in the aroma. Over all this is a very nice Pils, one that I will get again during the summer months. I think it is a bonus that it is in a can since it is such a good drinking beer, will be great for those summer excursions.","Stimack","Mar 12, 2007"

Light soft lemony sweetness hits up front in the taste, a rubber and grassy bitter hoppiness comes in midway and lingers into the dry finish. Light to medium in body, not extremely crisp, but a small amount of pepperiness and a good sized dryness in the finish.

4.38,15,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- A bit more hoppy than the usual pils I like, but this is one of the most flavorful ones I have had. Very tasty and quenching. I was a bit hesitant going into this after my fist beer from Sly Fox (Pale Ale...bleach!), but this one impressed me.","GClarkage","Jan 15, 2007"
3.91,2.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Into a pint glass, pours a very hazy grassy yellow, waaay too much head, but man it was lovely, fades away after quite a while, lacing in mounds, sheets, heaps, and traces, all kinds of stuff going on. Aroma is full of grassy, herbal Noble hops, a little bit of malt, pretty decent. Taste is better, the Noble hops are done better, balance is better, citrus is nicer, grassy herbal hop tones are nice, but also a little metallic twang to it that was a little distracting. Mouth is good and carbonation is high, and overall, its just a pretty good and drinkable beer.","objectivemonkey","Dec 24, 2006"

3.6,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Thanks Dr.Jay for bringing up.Good small head on lighter yellow. A nice bitterness and drinkability at 44 IBU. Clean and fresh and refreshing. Unfiltered gives it a cloudiness and a tad complexity to the aroma more than the flavour.Carbonation about right.","Sammy","Dec 14, 2006"
3.4,-10.8,4,4,3,4,3,"drinkability is affected negatively by the taste bud mugging, but it's light and fizzy enough to create a party in the oral cavity. not one of their worst beers by any means, but not something i'll bust my ass to get. glad i tried it.","goodbyeohio","Dec 14, 2006"

4.33,13.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This pils poured a clear, gold color with white foam that settled and coated the inside of the glass. The smell was bready malt with noble hops, a very German pils aroma. The taste was bready malt and noble floral hops with mild hop bitterness. A good lager flavor overall. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The hops lingered nicely in the aftertaste. This was a very, very good and enjoyable German pils.","UncleJimbo","0"
4.06,6.6,5,4,4,4,4,"I've heard people recommend this to beer noobs, but I dont think I'd do the same. The flavor is really all in the bitterness, so if you're not into that, tough.","tempest","Oct 19, 2006"
3.25,-14.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 3/4"" eggshell head over the slightly cloudy light golden (yellow?) brew. Head froths down at a reasonable rate, with ample delicate lacing. Aroma is sweet pale, maybe a bit chalky, with a bit of a hops tinge. Flavor is also sweet to start, but mostly defined by an amorphous bitterness that fills the mouth, and closes chalky. Mouthfeel doesn't do much for me, but there's not much debate that if you like it, you could keep on drinking it. Still a better can option than swill, easily.","ppoitras","Oct 05, 2006"
3.6,-5.5,3,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Light wheat color, with a slight head, white with a touch of lacing. Some spicy malt (marzen) in the nose, tiny little bit of green hops as well. The taste is totally hop forward, not IPA huge, but still announcing its presence with authority. Finishes slightly bitter and lingering, but also really refreshing. Good session beer.","dherling","Oct 03, 2006"
3.82,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Nice blonde color, a little hazy, but not much head retention, although not bad for a pilsner. Light smell of clean German hops, nothing outstanding or overpowering but very nice in a subdued way. Taste is a mix of citrusy hops, with a twinge of honey sweetness. Tart, lip-smacking bitterness. I could probably have quite a few of these. I'm not an expert on Pils, but this is a very nice, refreshing little beverage.","malthead","Sep 29, 2006"

3.92,2.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This poured with a huge, fluffy, off-white head that threatened to spill over the sides of the glass before settlling back down. The color was a slightly cloudy lemon-yellow and the nose was absolutely fragrant with Saaz hops. The mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant bitterness on the palate. On the finish, I noticed a brief malt sweetness, followed closely by the return of the same bitterness noted before. It was the hops that really lingered. The relatively low ABV makes it a highly drinkable beer, especially as an alternative to hefeweizens on a hot day.","woodychandler","Jul 24, 2006"

4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Clearly labeled on the can that this was produced and canned at the Royersford locale so here it goes after stopping in at Mad Mex looking for some Sly Fox draft products I saw the beer list that said Sly Fox cans ""New"" and I was like I take one of each for eight bucks...ouch!!! I wanted to taste the can product before diving into a case so here it goes...appears a crystal clear pale golden hue forms a rocky large white head leaves magnificant fine even layers of lacing done my pint glass. Aroma is full of noble Saaz galore...very hoppy aromatic herbally goodness with biscuit mineral malt character very nice mix of tones coming to my senses. Taste is slightly grassy with a mix of citrus peels in there as well mineral water with all of the herbal hops and light toasted malts bring a biscuit crisp mild sweetness but overall this canned product finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is light bodied by no means though is this one thin or watery crisp carbonation capable of tickling the back of the throat but not overly bitey very smooth on the palate. Drinkability...what can be said some one has brewed an incredibly tasty and drinkable pils and offered in cans thank the beer gods for those guys out in the philly suburbs. Oh yeah and if your interested and I went along and picked up a case for 25 bucks great investment you'll love the packaging little mini cases each with 12 cans...cute.","WVbeergeek","Beers"
