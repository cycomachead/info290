"picked up because I love the style and knew it came from an area that I know I like the beer. a finger head and golden color. smell is a bit skunky. the taste is clean, crisp, refreshing, maybe a very tiny bit skunky but in a good way. on the same level as Becks for me. if I wanted this style, I'd go to this or Becks. good beer."

"Great bitter beer with a smooth finish"

"Great outside summer beer. Ive been drinking this, brew for along time, its my go to outside/ work beer. If you like skunky German lagers you'll enjoy this."

"Not interested in this style"

"A light lager, easy drinking.  Not much complexity but that is the point."
"Not a really bad beer just a little light for me"

"Poured into a pint glass and the color reminded me much of that of Miller Lite. Golden in color with a head that does not last more than a few seconds. I personally enjoyed the taste of this beer as it goes down smooth and very drinkable. Taste was good, not great but good. I bought a 12 pack and shared them with the guys and they thought it was quite good as well. Feel- smooth. Overall i was happy with the beer and enjoy how easy it is to drink."
"It had a way better taste than its smell."

"Very smooth drinking beer with a good taste. I think it fills that niche well. I'd recommend it. Think Stella Artois or Pilsner Urquell"

"Bad smells bad really bitter. Taste"

"This is one of my favorite beers!"

"DATE TASTED: December 14, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstephan pilsener... OCCASION: drinking off and away Johnny Football's forgettable first start... APPEARANCE: transparent, sallow yellow body; off-white head begins well but flattens to a casual smear... AROMA: beefy, doughy, buttery fragrance associated with cheaper, imported, green-bottled lagers... PALATE: drinkably nondescript--light and refreshing but so liquid, the only thing left is a small biscuity aftertaste...TASTE: thin, sweet and syrupy flavors dominate a rather weak profile... OVERALL: tough to slam a beer that is as happily drinkable as SPG, so I will instead suggest that in the right circumstance, this beer could compliment the standard party fair...but it doesn't distinguish itself much from the other green-bottled brethren..."

"A good lager. better than most mass produced stuff.  less hops more malt than many of craft beers.   Pretty smooth overall. nose isn't great."

"A good German style lager beer.  Not overloaded with hops that seems to be the current style with so many ales.  Has that German beer taste.  Reminds me of my days in Germany while in the army."
"Pours a very pale yellow with not a lot of head. The smell was a bit skunky. The taste turned out to be very mild in the beginning leading to a skunky aftertaste. Checked the dates just to be sure but it must be either the green bottle or just the beer that is not very appetizing to me."

"Relatively malty aroma is a little more appealing than the more hoppy flavor. Grassy hops linger on and on in the mildly bitter aftertaste."
"Overall, just another bad example of how to package beer."

"some people may not even be familiar with the differences, but these import lagers ive tried in both green and brown bottles, they always taste better in the brown bottle, and its easily noticeable. The green bottle gives the beer an almost sour sweetness, and the brown bottle has a more natural grainy tasting sweetness without the sour flavor which is also referred to as a skunky flavor. The thing ive noticed, is that when i purchase a 12 pack package of this st. pauli girl beer, since the beer is not exposed to light, the beer taste more like it should taste without that certain skunky sweetness. i pour it into a glass from a distance to get rid of the extra carbonation put in it, and it taste absolutely awesome over a 6 beer drinking session. I just suggest to get it in the 12 pack package so that the beer has not been effected by light."

"This beer is just OK for me. I consider this a lady's beer because my wife really likes it and so do most of the women who drink beer. I can't imagine going to the corner bar and ordering one of these. It taste best on a hot summer day. For a 4.6% ABV it has great flavor. For those who like hoppy and an ABV of 7% or more, this is not to your liking."

"The flavor also has those pale, toasted malts but there is also a delicate sweetness that introduces itself to the mix and a clean, dryish finish. Everyone remembers their first Girl right? Well it's not my first so I remember my last."

"Overall â€“ Nothing really special here. A dry lager that, unfortunately due to the desire to put in a green bottle, has a slightly skunky flavor with a big skunk aroma. Nothing too special, but not insanely offensive either."

"overall for an imported German brew i was not disappointed, however it is better in a 12 pack. the green bottles let in light. 6 packs let in lots of light. 12 packs dont. F.Y.I"

"Overall, this beer is ok but just lacks the refinement of some other German pilsners. While the price is good, I would take a Bitburger over this any day."

"O: 2.50 . It's just not that great. It's not horrible like budweiser or miller lite. But it is a sub-par beer with Heineken *somehow* being better than this! Comon local party store, stock some quality authentic German lager!! Not this stuff!! ;)"

"Pours a clear pale yellow in color with a very thin white head. Some lacing was seen which each sip.. Lots of streaming bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass but good carbonation. The aroma is on the strong side and just of grains. The taste is crisp and clean and is of grain. Goes down pretty easy. Overall, it's not too bad."
""
"I really like this beer. Traveled Europe, Canada and SA for work and have had several hundred types. Yes, it is like Heineken but more everything! Listen, people rated Mirror Pond and Sierra Nevada - for it's high alcohol content. People tend to like to get a kick, especially when you drink lots. I'm a PHD and know that from all the alcoholics I see. This is a great tasting beer!"

"O: Nothing special here and since they use green glass bottles, it suffers the fate of the skunk. Not a lot of flavor in this beer so I will not likely be picking it up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a subtle but well crafted beer. True to style but with quality. Easy to underestimate this one. People who compare this to Bud or American macros are way off. Only water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. Drink a few and actually taste it."

"I was glad to see it has the German Purity Decree stated on the bottle. I am looking for a beer with no sugar (not top-fermenting) that is the straight 3 ingredients. However, I am also looking for organic. St Pauli Girl has too much carbonation and could not get the taste of metal from the bottle cap out of my mouth."

"The taste and feel are light crisp and refreshing with tons of grain and cereal malt. Very easy on the palate and stomach it's an easy drinking brew with a lot of flavor even if that flavor is rather one dimensional."

""
""
""
""

"This beer is seriously mediocre. I bought it cause I was like, oh, German beers abide by the Bavarian purity law so this probably has less weird chemicals in it than American beers. But yeah, it tastes just like Bud or Natty. Not worth the money for such a low alcohol content--though it did start to taste better after I'd had a few :)"

"O - Overall, It was a decent Pils, and a great palate washer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a truly wonderful beer. I believe it is a wheat beer style which is comparable to Heinekin in taste, it pours a clear see-through golden yellow with little acrid aroma and no head- although I did pour it at an angle so that it wouldn't lose too much carbonation into a regular glass as I have yet to get some good beer glasses! It has a wonderful taste and when you inhale upon drinking an aroma to match. It is a very good cheap beer, I believe I paid 3$ with tax for a pint. I also believe this has a faint after-taste of red apple, although it is barely noticeable."
"As far as lighter beers go, this is one if the better ones I've had in recent memory. Granted, those have mostly American lights."

"Pours a clear, straw color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight hops, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of sulfur. Fits the style of a German Pilsner. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong pale malt, hint of metallic, slight hops, hint of sweet malt, hint of sulfur, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, but aroma and body are hurt by hint of sulfur and metallic notes."

"I try as many different beers as anybody and this is one I keep comming back to. I agree with the reviewer about freshness. It really does make a difference. I don't care what anyone says this is a great refreshing beer and one of my all time favorites. German lagers must be my taste preference. Enjoy!"

"This is a pretty typical euro lager. It's musty, skunky, comes in a green bottle, and has a rather simplistic flavor. Nothing special to report here. I'll avoid in the future."

""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear golden yellow with a foamy 1/2 inch beige head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip down the glass on the drink down. Smell is very skunky up front but this gives way to some grain and slightly vegetal aromas. Taste is mainly of grain with some vegetal and slightly skunky flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer but the smell is quite skunky."

""

""

"Pretty much what I expected. Drinks better than most American light beers but still not very flavorful or satisfying."
""
""
""

"This is my first trying of this beer and I was completely underwhelmed. I expected more from a German import. I do not recommend this beer."

"I really do not like this one. From the standard green bottle, poured into clear dixie cup. Golden pour with decent fluffy white head. Aroma is skunk and light hay, no sweetness, a bit of dryness. Taste is like sucking on a skunk's ass. Why do breweries continue to use the green bottles. I have had this multiple times and no improvement. I tend to prefer the standard macros like Bud Light to this one."
"Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is light on the tongue and easily swallowed. The body is easy drinking and refreshing. The carbonation is not overly noticeable and really assists in the finish."
"Overall: This just doesn't have enough flavor or presence to keep my interest. I couldn't even buy it to get sloshed because it's another ridiculously priced import."
""
""
""
""
""
"I picked this beer up at a super market one night just sampling and it had an attractive bottle. It kind of has a cheaper German pilsner taste with thin head. I wouldn't want to drink this beer in public it looks kind of girly. I'm not saying this is a terrible beer it's just not for me."
""
""
"Overall not as bad as I thought. The metallic flavor on the finish is the real downfall, but not really skunked, and not a huge mess either. I'm glad I tried this again, and did a full review. Perhaps I should give other piss beers a try again. This I would say is worlds better than the macro swill of U.S., and to tell the truth, I'm a little glad it surprised me in a good way. And hell, at least I got some entertainment out of writing this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would risk the purchase (due to the green bottle) again. This is a winner."

"O: Its not a bad beer but could definately be better. I heard bad things about it but I wouldn't say its horrible."
""
""
""
""
"o: Not so much of a crisp, refreshing beer like a German Pilsner should be. The skunkiness aroma is just so overwhelming that it dominates the beer. Would recommend ditching the green glass to avoid the skunkiness."

""
""

"Overall, the smell threw me. It smelled like it had gone bad. But other than the smell, it's a decent beer. By no means one to race out and buy, but good enough."

"Overall - A pretty good beer. Nice and refreshing."
"Overall this is a great beer that I would purchase again."
"I would drink it again."
"Overall â€“ Not something I would ever seek out again. It might work well as a camping beer, but even then, there are better/cheaper options."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking golden yellow color, the head was white and fluffy. The smell of the beer had the typical German Lager aroma of some fresh grass and some aging in there too. The taste of the beer is a little grassy also and finished with a crisp clean flavor though. The mouthfeel of this one is light, crisp and clean also. Overall this brew isn't bad but I prefer the Dark Lager over this one personally."
"O) Perhaps this is the curse of the green bottle. I can't recall a time I've had a Pauli Girl that wasn't a bit skunky. This beer isn't terrible. Ice cold out of the cooler, you could do worse."
"Pours a clear gold color with nice carbonation and good white head. Smells a little almond-like, maybe a little grainy, with some definite bready characteristics. Tastes mostly clean with a sweet tasting finish. Mouthfeel is light with a slightly bitter finish. No real hop character to speak of. Overall, a decent beer. A good German brew at an affordable price. And you can't beat the iconic label art."
"Overall - This a very decent German Pilsner in my book. Not sure why this one isn't more highly rated by others, as its got many good German Pilsner characteristics and also has some flavor punch to it (not bland by anymeans)."
"However, it does get me hammered quite efficiently. Though I regret the decision to buy it at the halfway mark, it is at that point that I stop caring."
"The beer pours a light clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is exactly what I expected from an imported beer in a green bottle: skunked grain and nothing else. I am holding it against the brewer in my rating since it was their choice to use a green bottle. The flavor has a little bit of skunk, but not as much as in the aroma. I also get some grain and grass notes from the hops. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: Thereâ€™s nothing interesting about this beer that would want me want to try it again; the taste is very bland for the style."
"Overall: This is a fairly good beer. Had great smell and appearance, along with a surprisingly good taste. The dry finish is the only downside to this import"
"Prosit!"
"Overall an ok pils. Would rather have many others of the style. Not bad but probably won't buy again."
"You can pass on this one and not regret it."
"Poured a 1.5"" white soap suds head. Clear and quite light straw yellow in color. Smell from the moment opened and from arms length was substantially skunked. Taste was a pretty standard BMC style, rather watery, and had a mild but bitter finish. Really the only redeeming quality of this sample was the buxom blond St Pauli Girl on the label."
"Overall, not a beer to ""savor"" but just a thirst quencher with a bite. Won't be back for another."
"First thing that comes to mind is people going: ""Wooo!"" Pours nicely into a red Solo cup, a clear, watery, straw-yellow, with fizzy bubbles and a small head that recedes to practically nothing. Weak scents of light grains and green-bottle skunk. Pretty much the same in the taste, grains, rotten hay, skunk, with faint hints of something that could be hops. Light mouthfeel, and not very drinkable at all unless you're drunk already."
"O-I will probably not drink this again. it was not anything special. very dissappointing. I have heard good and bad things about this one and really just wanted to see for myself. definitly not the worst beer I have ever tried. but something I will do my best to avoid in the future."
"Overall: a simple beer that can be drank easily for a night of heavy drinking"
"On a hot day I can pound these back, though I can think of a few other session brews that I dig a lot more. Not bad, not great."
"Simple taste with this beer. No overpowering aftertaste either, which is always a plus. Not too filling, which is great for those nights you just want to enjoy a beer. Also, a decent starting lager if you haven't tried one before (I have, but I still enjoy it). Overall, a good choice if you are indecisive about what you would like to drink."
"Overall: It's worth a try if you're just getting into European beers, but don't expect anything great. This is just a typical Euro lager, although its light body and crisp flavors lend itself to refreshment.. Also beware of the high possibility of getting a slightly skunked bottle."
"I've never bothered pouring it out of a bottle, but I recall seeing someone do it- not surprisingly, the beer is a translucent golden color. Smell is rather bland, consisting of mostly grapefruit and skunk. The taste is the same as the smell and tastes like watered-down skunky grapefruit with some hay or grass or something- but it's actually pretty drinkable. It's better than a run-of-the-mill Bud Light or Keystone, but not much."
"It is not a filling and does not leave a bad after taste./"
"I'm not impressed but it's still drinkable."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Pours pale yellow with a nice white fluffy head. Few lacings. Fruity, floral aroma. Taste is delicate, floral, some bitter hops in finish. One of the better light beers in the world. Very nice if stored properly. A nice transition beer. Probably too bitter for the macro crowd."
"In summary, perhaps the big German exports here are no longer skunky and uncared for. If so, I'll be a customer again. This was a good start."
"Nothing really special, just your typical Euro Lager."
" Not a bad go-to if your choices are limited."
"Lets not forget you review the beer for the style and this is a good example."
"Solid and representative of the typical German lager. Actually tasty and drinkable, though not all that distinctive."
"Notes: It's an acquired taste, as is all beers, but this is not one that one can drink on his or her ""first beer"". Let's set the standards on beer with something a little more ""worth while"""
"Clear and golden, with a nice head present that recedes to a thin layering with some decent lacing in my pint glass. Smells pretty sweet, with a definite hop aroma noticeable, some slight citrus and grassy notes come through, but are very faint. Taste is mild and smooth, starts out fairly sweet and malty, but not overwhelming, with some light grainy characteristics, and leads into a nice bittering hop presence that mingles nicely on the tongue. Mouthfeel is fairly light with some pretty intense carbonation. This beer finishes a bit dry, but overall is a decent and easy drinking pils."
"D- I poured it out it was so skunky."
"Pours a pale straw, quick rush of white head, diminishing into nothing quickly. Very pale scent with hints of fresh grain and earthy hops. Very pale taste, sollows scent with light fresh dried grains and earthy hops. no off charachteristics, just light, weak and watery with highly active carbonation."
"very forgettable beer. do not like that skunky aftertaste and dry finish. I used to think that I just don't like Pilseners but I am a huge fan of the Prima Pils. Oh well, won't be going back to ""the girl"" anytime soon."
"Notes: I remember when St Pauli Girl used to be a fairly respectable beer. Either my tastes have changed or this beer is now trying to compete with American adjunct beers."
"This is the second time I've tried this beer but the first time reviewing it for BA. I didn't care for it the first time I tried it but this time and I think I may have gotten a fresher bottle because it is fairly decent for a pilsener. I wouldn't particularly recommend it but it isn't bad. May be worth a try."
"RJT"
"Oh St. Pauli Girl...had a friend come back to the states from germany swearing by this as his party beer(as it is a pilsner I figured u could knock back enough to get cheerful) so I crack the bottle and and St Pauli girl mustve opened her legs lol pretty skunky/sulfury but wasn't a bad brew I could drink it had a decent taste not what I expected from such a strong smelling beer. It was decently crisp and left ur mouth dry so a decent not great beer....id drink it again"
"American Lagers and Pilsners, but with more of a grainy nose and taste. Would pair well with a real hot day. Could be rather thirst quenching. Probably wouldn't seek this out, but I could see how this beer could be good for someone making the jump to craftbeer."
"D - all in all average to below. Better than some things out there but there is an awfully lot of better beers than this. And the dark version of St. Pauli is much better than this."
"Taste is of not as much as I hoped. A bit of hops and otherwise follows the nose but less than I expected. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy."
"Overall: Definitely comes off as a cheaper German import. Stronger/more unbalanced/harsher than Beck's."
"d- too weak for my taste. not worth it."
"Pours a light straw color with a white head that has some decent retention though not much lacing. The nose brings some light grain and corn. The taste is corn, straw, grain, and some very faint hops. Light feel with pretty strong carbonation. Not really tasty and really nothing going for it."
"Poured this fine brew into my pub glass and it gave me a one finger head of thick white foam. The color is medium yellow, rating a 5 on the SRM beer color chart. I like the smell, blending of orange and other citrus smells with malt. The flavor is a medium well blended taste of baked wheat, rye, barley, corn and a hint of hops. Full bodied feeling in my mouth, good amount of carbonation with a feeling of pudding. I like this beer, even though it is a little pricey."
"D - Named in honor of a hooker or hookers, for export to the US. Way to go! Shows what they think of us in America."
"An ok brew with very few differences within the style to make it noteworthy."
"but if you like beers that taste like slighty gamey boiled eggs i would say try it but if not with all do respect run for the hills!!!"
"Drinkability: Poor. It looks and smells ok but the flavor is simply bad."
"Beer is grainy and oddly bitter with a sulfurish aftertaste, its mildly sweet up front but carbonation in the mouth is minimal. This is a train wreck of a beer, if possible the NA version of this beer is actually better."
"D -- Very nice. 4.9%, good malt & hop balance without being macro bland -- very nice considering the rep its garnered."
"overall not the best, never will be but for what it is, it works, word order it in a pinch over 95 percent of this list."
"Let's be honest, this isn't the best Germany has to offer. It's highly drinkable though for a person who just wants to mindlessly put a few back."
"Despite its lack of outstanding characteristics, this beer has always been highly drinkable, and still is."
"Poured a transparent golden color with about a 1/2"" head that quickly dissipated. Not a ton of smell, but it was a faint hoppy lager smell. Taste was malty with a little bit of hops. It was nicely carbonated and was thin/light. Overall, it would be okay on a hot summer day, but the taste isn't really hitting the spot for me. It would be sessionable and maybe a good way to ween your friends off budwiser and miller-coors (although it is still owned by AB) and get them onto the path of righteous craft brews."
"Drinkability is good. Not an impressive beer by any means, but easy enough to drink."
"Crystal clear bright gold with a collar of fine white foam and a smattering of soapy bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Sticky lace clung to the glass as the initial head fell after the pour. There was a sharp sulfury hop aroma immediately after popping the cap, but this dissipated quickly and left a faint maltiness and floral/spicy hoppiness behind. Didn't like the flavour so much. It started with a dirty malt character, musty, with acrid spicy hops mid-palate. The finish felt watery and all that was left was a sulfury mess. Dry and light bodied, average carbonation for the style. I thought this had promise at first, but as I had more of it I liked it less."
"Overall bland. Goes down easy and not bad for the reasonable price."
"At the outset, another skunky Euro-lager, but that particular beast's usual aspects are suppressed in the middle, long enough to make this drinkable when there is distracting sun, or television or soccer, or well, you get the idea."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A very clear beer, dark yellow to slightly orange. Head poured a little thin and lacy, but not bad. Very easy drinking beer. Could easily see it being a session beer. Neither very hoppy nor very malty, but with a slightly thin mouthfeel."
"D- This isn't a terrible beer. In fact, held up to becks, heinikin, etc., it's solid. The nature of shipping and skunking just leaves this beer a little off though."
"The body was typical for the style and drinkability would have been excellent, except for the skunk. I'd like to try this closer to the source sometime."
"It is worth spending the few extra dollars to drink this instead of the typical American corn and rice garbage."
"Tastes skunked. Nice pils bitter character to the finish. More of a czech pils than a german pils, but there is some supporting malt. Hop flavor (aside from the skunky) is metalic and oranges. Quite dry and really spicy hop zip in the end. Aftertaste is lingering metalic with skunk as the predominant."
"I drank this from a 12 oz bottle into a mug...Light clear gold, decent head, lots of carbonation, super clear....The aroma and taste are both light hops, at least there is no skunk, typical macro pilsner smell there too. It tastes ok, nothing special, but very crisp and easy to drink...I'd drink this over any american macro but a lot better choices out there."
"The skunkiness does get old fast, but it actually isn't bad, per se."
"Note that by above average i mean it's good but not what i would consider a great beer. It surpassed my expectations but only because they were low from the start. A good beer in it's class and something I would drink again but nothing spectacular here."
"This beer really lacks the crisp, freshness that one expects in a German Pils."
"D-Once again, decent. It's not a terrible beer, but it's also not that good. Glad I only bought one bottle. Now I can move on to something better."
"Reminds me more of a pilsner, but still nicely drinkable. Nice body and decently flavored which would make this a fair session beer."
"Notes: Very skunky beer. Not one I suggest getting, but I know a person or two that like it. A bit more grain and malt than some lagers/Pilseners, but not a great beer."
"D: Very drinkable not to heavy and not to light basic middle of the road."
"Pours a thin pale yellow with minimal head. Smell of alcohol and bacteria. Taste is horrible. Just don't bother. Skunky notes overshadow a wimpy malt that tries to make your tongue die. Too carbonated and yuk,yuk, yuk."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes within thirty seconds into almost no lacing. The aroma is of...um...well nothing I guess. It's not the worst aroma I've come across in a beer, but that is only because it isn't an aroma. The taste has some faint bready malt that is actually quite pleasant. No hops are detected. The mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, but not too high. Overall, it has been six or seven years since I last had this beer, and honestly it is better than I remember it. That is not saying much though. It is palatable, but nothing special."
"D/O- This calls for a 6 pack night as an alternative to any major corporate beer."
"Notes: If you are a fan of that green bottle import beer (which I am not) you may like this beer. However, even I like other green bottle imports better. Definitely a below average beer."
"D - pretty drinkable due to the blandness"
"Drinkability: It's one of those beers that's instantly forgettable. If nothing else, at least this bottle wasn't riddled with skunk!"
"Drinkability - I always find myself grabbing for this beer when im in the mood for a nice german pilsner ( Even though they dont sell this in germany. )"
"D: Very drinkable since there isn't much taste to it. So long as it's not skunked it's a decently drinkable beer."
"a just descent passable beer not terrible but certainly not good"
"Body was thin and wet. Flavors of buttered bread and corn. This is what I expected it to be. Refreshing and slick, this is an easy drinker. There's better lagers out there, no doubt, but this would be alright to drink with some grilled fare."
"It could be worse, that being said it doesn't have alot going for it. Taste is grainy with a hint of molasses at the finish. Color is yellowish with a white head. Smell is almost not noticeable. I would not drink this ever really if it wasn't one of my dad's beers"
"Drinkability: a nice little Pilsner. St. Pauli Girl has earned a place as one of my band's regular session beers."
"Pretty average beer, certainly not bad, and considering this is what my dad has stocked for the Christmas party when I got back from college, I'll be drinking some more of these. I certainly won't complain, it's a decent beer, but nothing extremely noteworthy, either."
"Another beer that I had not touched in almost a quarter of a century. The marketing slogan used to be, ""You never forget your first Girl", and that was certainly the case for me. She was a skunky mess that quickly became a drain pour, despite the fact that I was underage and had really worked to score that beer. Big, foamy, two fingers worth of bone white head. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a Saaz hops bitterness to it. Mouthfeel was medium with a real Saaz bite on the tongue. The label identified it as ""Lager", but I would put it as a Pilsner. This was really quite good. Finish had a pleasantly lingering hopiness. This was a real eye-opener."
"To be honest I'm a little disappointed. Well, at least I'm nice and hydrated for my next review."
"St Pauli another Euro lager, possibly the most famous German import. Who knows where this is brewed today? Appears pale fizzy yellow golden with a bright white head that fades quickly with minimal lacing. Aroma has cooked veggies with rough slightly skunked herbal hops, this green bottled lager was straight from a 12 pack so no light exposure yet. Flavor is really minimal, slight sweetness mineral water tone, with harsh herbal hop bitterness and a tad of that skunk note. Mouthfeel is light bodied much like carbonated water, bad finish with those harsh hop oils. Drinkability is what it is a beer that will continue to be solid in every grocery store across the country when so much better options are available."
"A very grainy, corny taste to this one with a foul twinge on the backend. I presume those were hops. Skunky smell and very fizzy yellow, although a bit of head forms. Some German Pilsner qualities, pretty easy to drink, believe it or not. Cheaply priced, as compared to say, 20 years ago. I think if this were in a brown bottle, it may not be as skunked and may be a decent brew."
"D: Actually a pretty easy to drink beer, but not incredibly flavorful. Decent, and definitely something I would drink if put in the situation where there was nothing else that sounded appealing. Get rid of the damn green bottles!"
"i had two of these, both of which were skunked. quite a disgusting beer. a friend had to finish both for me."
"The mouthfeel actually has a decent body to it -very clean - and the drinkability is good. Really good. I'm talking mini keg to your self good."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down easily since it's pretty light, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, there are a lot of other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"D-I like this lager, if it was priced right i would buy it again, it would be a good beer to go with lamb or rabbit. the crispness and bubbly feeling on the tongue reminds me of drinking a soda so it could also be a nice refreshing beer on a hot day."
"D: Don't like the way it goes down, it is a little rough."
"PS- Google: Katarina Van Derham (St. Pauli's Girl 2009 Spokesmodel) and if you have already rated this beer, then re-rate. You may just find your new overall score to be a point or two higher! ~"
"Aroma is of green apple peel, sugar and pear. Taste is light with a thin, sharp crispness that I'm not a fan of. Sudden and fleeting noble hop cry for help in back. Fairly flavorful light grain, and pear. Even bad German lagers aren't that bad."
"Good drinkability, definitely a session beer. Low abv with decent flavor. Not the tastiest lager around but not bad either."
"From a green 24 oz. bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is quite skunky and a bit offensive. Taste is crisp and finishes bitter, not a whole lot of flavor. Feels a bit bitter in the mouth. This beer does go down pretty smooth. Overall an average beer."
"Appearance is light golden in color with a thin crisp head. Smell has a light clean aroma of grain and hops. Taste is malty with light hop bite. Mouthfeel has good carbonation and light body. Overall a good brew, a bit bitter as a session for me, but not bad."
"Drinkability: I think this is a pretty good beer. It's not the best thing I've ever had, but I could drink it again."
"D - Skunky but not offensive, it's a drinkable import. Enjoyable in quantity and ice cold, but not quality."
"The hops aren't quite as forward in the taste, although they're still there. A little bit of sweetness, and a littler bit of bitterness on the back of the tongue. No heavy malt. I can taste a lot more carbonation than I can see. All in all, very comparable to Beck's, a favorite of mine. It's not a work of art, but quite good all around. Just don't let ""Pilsener"" fool you into thinking you're getting Milleresque blandness - if that's what you want, look elsewhere."
"Pours bright yellow with a half inch white head. Leaves a thin amount of lacing. Smells of husky grains, slightly of pale malt, and a good amount of floral hops. Tastes of mildly spicy, noble hops, particularly in the finish. Some sweetness from the pale malt, and a small amount of bitterness. Its highly carbonated."
"D- Very refreshing beer. I just wish it was handled a bit better to avoid that skunkiness. I'd gladly drink this over a macro anyday. However compared to other german lagers I've had, this lacks a bit of flavor."
"I was pleasantly surprised but not by its complexity. Obviously fresh, extremely mild hops (less skunk than expected) scent in the nose when poured; but the similarity with its ""sister"" pilsner, the ""green bottle"" Beck's brewed in the same Bremen brewery ends there. Very drinkable, smooth beer with a fresh malt flavor and a delicate hops bitterness (emphasis on delicate). I didn't find it too sweet, but it's definitely a touch sweet. Perfect carbonation and absolutely good drinkability. Decent stuff!! I don't have evidence of this, but as St. Pauli is brewed in the Beck's Brewery in Bremen and sold only in the US, I am convinced (after side-by-side taste tests) that St Pauli is the closest thing you'll get in the US to Beck's Gold (if it isn't the same exact product)."
"The beer pours a lighter golden color with a huge head. Very huge head and I pour beer correctly. Also, it is by far not the first time I have poured it so I knew what to expect. The smell is the benchmark I hold for German beers. A bias high marks for it. The taste is a little on the weak side compared to other German beers. What it lacks in taste (for German beers), it make up in drinkability. I would guess that it is a popular hard drinking beer in Germany, but I can not confirm that."
"Atmosphere might be the best part of this one. Has a really solid look at least. Nose, flavor, and feel, are all okay. Decent quaff."
"D - This is built for session drinking on the cheap. I found a 12 pack at Meijer for $10.99 (that's less that eleven dollars!) so I broke down and bought this stuff. I would pick it up again for the same reason I did this Memorial Day weekend... to wash down a few dogs and serve to friends that ""forgot"" to bring their own beer."
"Drinkability - a bit bitter, but definitely a good beer. No problem finishing this six pack."
"When pouring from this oversized 1 pint bottle, the foam was very light wheat in color, bubbly and dissapated somewhat quickly which produced a small ring of foam till the end. The color was golden yellow. The smell had a nice hops and wheat ballance with a flowery hint. The taste was smooth, had a light wheat tone, some fruitiness and somewhat dry. Mouthfeel - crisp and light-bodied. Drinkability - clean, crisp and dry."
"Nothing spectacular. Just a nice, kick-back of a pilsner. The green bottle made ma a bit apprehensive at first, but the flavor was not as bad as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, this is very much an average beer, but it's not too bad."
"But there is a total babe on the label serving two foamy mugs of lager; surely that is noteworthy. Sometimes, if I've been drinking entirely too much St. Pauli Girl, I will start to hit on the girl on the label. But she won't talk to me. I think that maybe I creep her out. But if I creep her out, why is she smiling? Oh the things I would do to you..."
"A very average beer that I wouldn't pick if given a choice, but certainly wouldn't turn it away either."
"If you're sometimes forced to hang out with people who drink Corona, Bud, or Miller, you'll be glad is some of these are around. If you hang out with hopheads, though, you won't really want this one around. Pretty middle of the road."
"D- Overall a beer that is pretty easy to drink but isn't the best thing out there."
"overall.. drink it"
"Overall: run of the mill"
"The taste is slightly drying towards the finish, almost salty. There is a definite a metallic or sulfery taste to the beer, and there is an ever so slight lemony quality to this lager. There is a slight corn, cooked grain quality to the beer, and a tinge of sweetness once things warm. When the beer is cold, there is more dryness and saltiness in the finish. As it settles, more sweeter malts emerge. This is an okay beer, bland, drinkable, nothing special."
"This beer is sweeter and less hoppy than I recall back in the days of yore. Surely another victim of mass marketing. Similar to, yet not as robust as Becks."
"drinkability is very good on this, would be a great session brew for the warmer weather,refreshing and thirst quenching, I've had this many times over the years and am surprised I've never reviewed it till now...huh!..anyway this is nothing spectacular just a good ol' German Pilsener done in the classic style."
"Mouthfeel is thin and crisp, about on par with most lagers."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it isn't a good one, either. At least a skunky flavour when I first opened the bottle disappeared after a few minutes. The best thing it has going for it is its drinkability. I won't be seeking this one out again (not that it is that hard to find)."
"d. OK to drink, but for the freshest pilsners, I go local. Doesn't hold a candle to many, but when nothing fresher is around this is a good pils."
"Drinking this old school, straight outta the bottle. Piss yellow in color, no head, no lacing, no retention. Some crisp hops on the nose with no real malt aroma apart from some sort of toasted biscuit. Not appealing but not repulsive either. On the palate, there's some spicy hops up front with a strange off-flavor with some cooked vegies and corn. Dry, hoppy finish. Great carbonation and solid finish, light and very drinkable"
"Overall: A descent beer that is refreshing and simple to drink, uninteresting, and nothing special about this German lager."
"Not far off from water, except for the unpleasant taste."
"Yellow pour with a while bubbly head. Typical lager aroma, lots of metal and rice. This is augmented with a saaz sweetness. More bitterness in the taste, with a grainy tang that actually goes well with the hops. Like a Heineken with more flavor and without the skunky aroma."
"The taste is similar with the stress clearly on the light grassy-herbal hops with a light but dominant bitterness. It's a bit thin and minerally, with a mineral-water quality and little malt characteristic. It's a bit weak with food."
"D: The Budweiser of german beer. thought I read this is brewed with a lager yeast which is why I thought it drank more like a macro-lager then a typical pilsner which it is described as. Horrible off flavors and packaged in a green bottle to add insult to injury. Needless to say this is a big pass an disappointment."
"Not one of my favorite beers, and I probably won't buy it again just because there are beers out there that I like better for this kind of price. However, its not bad. I have to admit I hated the first couple sips, but once i got through about half of one it kinda grew on me, and I drank the rest no problem."
"Pours a light yellow-clear colored body, and has almost no head. Has a strong malty and alcoholy aroma. A finely carbonated palate. Has a slightly bitter taste, clean finish, and a light palate."
"D: An overpriced import lager that has a good feel but not a lot else on the ball."
"It's interesting to revisit some of the imports that I used to drink, this being one of them. Rather simple pilsner, although I find it more comparable to the typical euro lager. Nice biting aroma slightly hopped. Good initial pour head soon settles and there is decent lacing stuck to the glass. Mouthfeel is sharp but finishes awkwardly. flavor is solid, crisp light malts with a medium bitterness from the hops. This one isn't bad."
"D: Boring but good. A decent session beer that goes well with food."
"Suckered in by the cleavage, I bought a sixer of this beer. Out of the bottle this brew was a bleached, near transparent gold color with a white had that was short lived. Moderate lacing but not much to speak of. The aroma was at first rather brash, macro lager, horse-saddle malt and wet grain. Individually none of these elements is inherently bad but as a collection I was turned off. The flavors were also a bad mix, sweet processed malt at first followed quickly by a bitter hops that did not balance properly. The middle was vapid, weakly thought-out and unassertive. The body was light and the carbonation too much. For the price one can do better and when you really get down to it the cleavage on the toothy, bottle-girl was the best part. Ouch."
"You could do worse."
"Finally a non-skunked bottle! Certainly not a great beer by any means, but it gets the job done. Went nicely with spaghetti."
"Overall, another mass produced pilsener that leaves me wanting something more from the beer. I found myself saying ""Is that it?""."
"D: Average again. If someone offered me one, I wouldn't turn them down. I don't think I'd buy this again unless there's a great sale on it."
"Drinkability is moderate. Easily sessionable, but flavor is sub par."
"Not the greatest Lager I've had but it definitely isn't the worst either. Poured a golden color with a moderate white head with a little bit of lacing. The head tapers off quite quickly. A clean mild malt aroma, slightly floral. The flavor is a little sweet with malts and a mild hop bite in the finish. A touch of skunk doesn't help but overall somewhat drinkable and light."
"Drinkability: Wouldn't pass it up if it were offered again but why pick it up when there are others available that are so much better!"
"I though once the light-struck skunky flavor (thanks to the green bottle) cleared out of the aroma and taste, there might be something worth writing about, but I was mistaken. What was left after the most offensive, yet richest flavor vacated was a nasty sour fruit tang and only a hint of actual German lager flavor. Yes, it was there hiding in the back, light bready malts with a bit of sweetness. But for the most part I just tasted the big off-flavor that I assume St. Pauli Girl considers their trademark taste. Move along, nothing to drink here. Pass."
"Poured from a green bottle,lite straw color with bubbles and a white head that lingers just enough for appearance and mild lacing.Lite skunk hit the nose but not much considering the green bottle,a little corn,wet grass and grains,all faintly coming at you,not really much there, tasted kinda watery with the grains hitting in the corn too with a kinda mouth puckering taste,not much too it,very lite,i guess on a very hot day and this brew being very cold it would go down good but to sit down and enjoy it,just not much for flavor."
"Not a bad beer, but just rather basic."
"Pours from the 24oz. bottle a half-shade darker than your typical macro lager. A 2 finger head forms settling into a thick collar. It's very fizzy, countless bubbles rise to the top. Aroma is pleasantly malty with a slight hint of corn & a pinch of hops. The 1st sip brings a nice crisp hit of hops (Saaz?) bitterness, some dry grassiness, and a slight lemon citrus bite with some maltiness in the background for balance. Mouthfeel is medium, not heavy or watery. Overall, this is a pretty good macro pilsner. Not quite micro quality, but i'd definetly pick this over 95% of all the other mass-produced macro beer out there."
"Recommended for an occasional beer. Probably more enjoyable with food."
"D: Maybe I got an old bottle of the girl, but on initial tasting, I would never pick this up again. Maybe I'll throw one into the 6-pack on my next trip to the store, just to make a fair assessment."
"This is just an awful awful beer. Let it be known i am a big fan of pilsners but this is just god awful. Poured a very light yellow like color with not much of a head. Heavy carbination with this one as well. Smelled very skunky and remained that way through out. Got a bitter taste with it that was just totally off. This was my first drain pour i just couldn't drink it. Good thing i got it in a mixed six pack..."
"This is a favorite of a friend of mine so I decided to give it a try. Like most imported light beers, it was a little pricey for what you get. A clear color with lots of carbonation and a weak tan head. Skunky smell of stale hops and light grainy malts. Not much in the flavor area. A little bitter hoppiness with some grains. A light body with too much carbonation. Not the most drinkabel with the off flavors."
"D - This is pretty descent. It works in a pinch at a family gathering where people think imports=great beer."
"Poured to a light yellow and nice head. Had a little lacing but not a lot. There was some head at the end of the glass. Head was slightly off white in color. Smelled a little bit of skunk. Similar to Heineken, but not as strong. Im not saying thats a bad thing. Taste reminded me of a watered down version of Heineken. I liked it. The more I drank the more I liked the taste. Felt ok in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. I could drink these. But I dont think I could make it a session beer."
"Color is rather typical of a lager, a clear straw-yellow. Aroma is malty and full, with more malt scent than alcohol bite. Flavor is OK but a bit thin, malty with a touch of metallic taste and some bitterness - not bad, but a bit of a disappointment for a German beer. Aftertaste is a little bitter and metallic."
"Wouldn't recommend this one..."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass yielding a good fingers worth of white head that fades quickly and leaves no lacing. Light golden color that is crystal clear. Got scents of straw and grasses. First sip I tasted mildly sweet honey and some grains and ended with very small amount of hop bitterness. Extremely drinkable beer as I could probably finish off three or more of these in a single sitting."
"i really can't taste anything except for sourness. very light hops, very little malt. stale bread. almost tastes like onions. I really hated this beer. not much else to say. maybe i got a bad batch."
"I recommend this beer when looking for something to get sauced off that's a little different, but it's definately no treat or anything for a special occasion."
"Nothing special here, but not offensive."
"Overall, I found a bottle of this hard to finish. I won't be back."
"D: Not too drinkable beer. Not too good of a taste at all for me and the mouthfeel was nonexistent. I would recommend that you pass this beer over when you see it in the store, unless you want something that's cheap to try."
"Thick white foam on a medium golden body, St. Pauli Girl starts and ends in fairly basic fashion. The nose is somewhat pungent and mildy offensive, with its green-bottle skunkiness damping down the decent allotment grassy hops. Having written a few brief diatribes on this and uttered more toward such beers, I can't say I'm surprised. The taste makes a fairly decent recovery, with the hops carrying the day. But the lack of complexity results in a rather bitter, imbalanced beer. Moderately carbonated, this is a fairly drinkable, decent beer when all is said and done. Not the worst, not the best, but a fairly decent Pilsner from Germany."
"This is not one of my favorite Pilseners, but it's not completely bad. Golden in color with a modest, white head. It's nose has a distinct yeast smell, grainy too. A drinkable beer, like others have said it has that ""skunky"" flavor, but not as strong as others. Typical Pilsener taste, which I like, bread and grain notes. Fair amount of carbonation, good mouthfeel, a session beer for some. Bottom line, it's not a horrible beer, but there are better Pilseners out there."
"Why do any brewers still use clear or green bottles? It makes no sense."
"pours a generic lager gold color with a pure white head and tons of carbonation. the smell is average, basically again generic lager aroma with slight corn hints as well. taste is pretty decent, has a good mild skunkiness to it, its refreshing and light like a lager should be. its a good lager, and a good go to beer if you're in the mood for a lager"
"Light golden yellow color with very short lasting white head. Smell is yeasty, very slight skunkiness, bready, and light metallic which dissipated as it warmed and gave way to a light maltiness. Taste is a doughy, bready, yeastiness, with a good bit of carbonation. Reminds me of a watered down Carlsberg. Very light, and watery even for the style, I'd think, with a very slight bitterness. Nothing special at all really and I probably wouldn't want more than 1 of these ever."
"Poured pale yellow in color not much of a head. Smell a little hops not much else. Taste a little sweetness up front hops in the finish which disapeared quickly. Mouthfell was light in body mediem carbonation. Drinkability was good I'll take another."
"Good german beer with a great label."
"d - nondescript beer. could do worse, could do a whole lot better."
"I poured this and it came out a light gold with little carbonation and no head. It smelled like sweet corn, and tastes sweeter than expected. There's a little bit of a hoppy grassiness, but not enough to really stand out. It seems that St Pauli is just another run of the mill European Lager. I'd pass next time."
"D- definitely a better choice than most widely available pale lagers, this in all around good pils. you can find it at any gas station convenience store and that's a good thing."
"D - Decent, I could do 1 or 2 without getting bored. Fairly forgettable but certainly not bad. Worth trying."
"Drinkability: A very consumable, classic European brew. Seems to have lost something over the years though."
"Pale, clear yellow with a better than expected head that stayed for a while. It smelled pretty skunky. It wasn't pleasant. It had a lot of flavor, but it wasn't really the good kind of flavor. Left my mouth dry. I won't buy this again soon but I wouldn't turn a free one down."
"A pretty decent brew here, when considering the style, green bottle, and import status. From my experience, this is less likely to be skunked than many of its european counterparts. A decent beer with good flavor. Light bodied, fizzy, and generally tastes better than most american macros."
"Very drinkable for a pilsner"
"However, this is a very drinkable beer that I buy often because of how easy it is to drink with certain beer snobs as well as those who don't usually drink anything. Though it might not be the best beer I've ever had, I am quite fond of this one because it's just nice to drink."
"Poured from the green bottle a good almost 2 finger head, but the head was loose and weak, not thick and tight. Head was gone by the time I put the bottle away and came back. No lacing. Pale yellow in color. Smell was faint grain and malt. Surprisingly, no skunky. The green bottles were boxed which would keep the sunlight out, that must have helped. Taste had a hint of mild malt and was somewhat floral. Faint grains detected as well. Leaves the mouth dry, but not cotton mouth. Average to above average carbonation in this batch. Went down rather easily and I was surprized it wasn't skunky..keeping sunlight off the bottles changed the way this one smelled and tasted. I was pleasantly surprized that I actually enjoyed it this time and I based my review on that, not how it normally is. Hey, the girl on the front had long blonde hair that went to where her breasts about start. I always thought she had it pulled up. And she looks younger. Kinda nice."
"Why session this when you could session PBR?"
"Pours a pale blond color with a head that doesn't last. Smells somewhat skunky at first but I can smell the malt as well. Taste is very bready with a bitter aftertaste and not much of a flavor in-between. Average at best but nothing special and nothing I'd buy again."
"Since this is often the best choice on lame beer menus or lame grocery store selections, it's not entirely without its place in beerworld. But it's nothing I'd ever seek out, and depending on mood, I can see passing this up in favor of no beer at all. In a pinch, it can be enjoyed...otherwise...nah."
"I used to drink this when I was young, and along with Dab, Warsteiner, Paulaner, ""the girl"" had a special place. Going on memory, except for a recent 6 of Warsteiner, the girl is the cheapest, closest thing to a Munchen beer-hall lager readily available. If there were 12-er cans it would be my go-to macro, along with Pilsner Urquell."
"Missing the foil over the cap that I always grew to appreciate. However the top label is still foil. Smell is characteristic for a pilsner, sweet, but reserved. The taste is also sweet and dry with a very slight semibitter hopping. Classic of a German brew of this style. Carbonation is good not too much, not too little. This beer has a good yet not overwhelming flavor and be dranken with just about any food, anytime. The AC is good for flavor but not too high allowing this beer to continue to refresh."
"Average. Again, not my preferred style of beer, as I'm more of an ale man. No distinctive flavor. Better than American macro-brews. Skunky aroma, why the green bottles? Poured golden with head that dissipated pretty quickly. Mouthfeel was thin. Would have again if free."
"D- This beer, while not amazingly complex, is one of my favorite session beers. Its very light and easy to drink, while having an excellent taste that keeps me from being bored after drinking a few."
"Since I like this beer, I can drink it like water. My go to cheap hot drink a lot brew, it never lets me down...while I recognize that I drank their kool-aide, it's pretty good. Indeed, some girls are unforgettable!"
"The color was not bad, pouring a hazy light gold, with a quickly dissolving head. Their is a hint of skunky smell, mixed with maltiness. The malty taste is predominant in this brew. It is a bit dry and bitter going down. This is not something I will probably ever drink again."
"Overlying skunkiness and not a lot of flavor excepting some bitterness at the very back of the tongue. Looks like apple juice. Tastes like a bolder Heineken. I don't think I'll buy this one again. Really never had a great beer out of green glass yet."
"This beer holds a special place in MY heart. It was the first beer I ever had when I was 15 years old."
"Nothing much to reccomend this beer."
""
"Overall it is just another below average euro lager. Pass on this one."
"Thoughts: If I take everything into consideration (price, rarity, type of beer, etc) I think this is pretty decent. Especially if you are looking for a summer beer and don't want to follow the crowd and start stuffing citrus fruit into clear bottled skunk ass beer. Give this one a shot while on the boat or the beach."
"Just goes to show Reinheitsgebot is no guarantee of flavor or drinkability in a beer. Together with Lowenbrau, one of Germany's blandest beers."
"St. Pauli Girl Lager was light golden in color with good clarity. It had a bubbly white head that dissipated to a thin ring before long. The aroma was light grain, malt, and hops with a touch of skunk. The taste was light malt and little grainy with some hops and a dry finish. It was medium-light in body with good carbonantion. Overall it was a decent beer that was crisp and refreshing."
"Very easy to drink, and probably decently sessionable, I'm just not inspired enough to want more."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. A pleasant, uncomplicated beer."
"An average-ish green-bottled, boring Euro-lager. Not much of a pilsner, but ok. Pretty easy to drink. Not ""bad", there are worse - but there are better. A better pick than Heineken or Beck's, but..."
"I do not care what others on BA have to say about this. After a long doubleheader of softball, this and a slice a pizza was absolutely perfect. Sweeter than many German pilsners, very easy to drink, and no real flaws, I think I'll try to keep a sixer of this in the house of the course of the season."
"12 oz. bottle- color of straw yellow , with a thin off white head Â– crisp nose of sweet yellow corn , wet grass , faint bubblegum , and mild hops Â– sharp taste of grain , hay , and mild bitterness- body is sharp , lactic , and with medium high carbonation Â– aftertaste of skunk , mild bitterness , gummy , and bubblegum"
"Overall, I'm pleased to have finally tried this beer. It's a bit above average for a German Macro Lager/Pils. I'll have to keep and eye out and try the dark and/or special dark."
"Drinkability- It's okay for just a beer, but for a German Pilsner, I can't rate it very high."
"This poured a straw-colored, light gold with a thin, bubbly head and some slight evervescence. The smell is of grassy grains. Sweet and hoppy but quite a bit of skunk to go with it. The taste is a mixture of sweet and bitter, but they don't combine well and both can be distinguished. Not the greatest, but not the worst beer out there."
"I had a 24 ounce bottle of this to drink. It was okay, I guess. After awhile though, I lost my interest in this brew. Nothing to really wow about here other than that fact it's imported from Germany."
"Cheers!"
"St. Pauli Girl is very a light golden color with a thick head that eventually dwindled down to almost nothing and has very little lacing.It hits your tongue with a smooth ,semi-crisp taste, that is quickly followed up by a bittery after taste.It does a nice semi-hoppy aroma. This is not a bad beer, but there certainly are better ones out there."
"Quite dry tasting, thought there is a touch of sweet malt here as well. This beer is quite balanced towards the bitter side of the spectrum; with quite a nice hop bite in the finish. There is a soft, dry, almost dusty grain character to it. Quite light on the palate, though it does have some presence, including a lingering bitterness. Certainly there is nothing objectionable about this beer; clean, with not objectionable flavors at all. Perhaps not my cup of tea, but when handed this beer, which I was, I will certainly drink it."
"I suspect the number rating I give this will be identical to my bottled Beck's review. Hopefully it'll come out a little higher because I have to say I think this is the superior product. Appearance was pretty average. A beer slightly on the dark side of amber (more natural and less sickley looking than that bright macro yellow common to so many American macros). With a lively head that mostly disappeared quickly. Smell wasn't great. Partly the crisp barley smell you want from a pils, but also a bit on the skunky side which had me worried this was a Heineken clone. Taste was better. Though the first sip had me worried (it was also remeniscent of Henie), it quickly got better. All in all the hops and barley were nicely balanced. This was a crisp easily drinkable beer, but the flavor was still assertive, basically the beer Heineken and Becks both tried and failed to brew (Becks because its too weak, Heineken because it just tastes like spoiled crap). Overall the pleasant (if uncomplicated) taste and crisp lightness suggest a great session beer to me. I'd rate this the third best pils I've ever had (behind Czechvar and Urquell) and my second favorite. Nothing fancy here, but Pilsner isn't supposed to be fancy. They got the formula right. Ideal as a session beer or a lawnmower-BBQ beer if you can ignore the import price."
"D - It's like drinking a macro but with slightly more class."
"Taste is a little skunky and grassy. Mouthfeel is actually what I'd be looking for in a macro lager. There is a nice amount of carbonation, not the usual overcarbonated stuff that burns your tongue."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The appearance is the best part of this one. The beer poured a clear yellow, with a thick 1 inch head, that quickly faded to a small ring, leaving very little lacing. The aroma is the absolute worst part of this beer. It smells extremely skunky. I have never had a beer that smelt this bad. Aside from the smell, this beer is okay. The mouthfeel is average for a pilsner. The taste is decent. Nothing special here. Taste just like a light pilsner would taste. The drinkability is okay. Again, if you can get past the aroma of this beer, this would be a great session pilsner. This one just isn't for me."
"This was a nice palate cleanser from my usual porter/stout sessions. I hadn't tried a St Pauli Girl in many years and it was just as I remembered: very hoppy and clean with a crisp strong flavor that is expected from a German Pils. Grasslike aromas and flavors highlight this beer that is a straw yellow, moderately carbonated lager beer. It doesn't really distinguish itself from say a Becks or Carlsberg but is tasty and refreshing nonetheless."
"D - Tasty, goes down smooth, an excellent choice for an everyday beer."
"Overall: Whilst nothing special in the flavor department, this is a very clean drinking brew that tends to be higher on its thirst quenching ability than a long term drinking partner, though forced to drink this in lieu of other macros I could live with it."
"To think I chipped a tooth opening one of these at that show.... ahh the ignorance of youth."
"This was another beer that was rather blah. Nothing too good, nothing too bad, however it was better than average, just not by much. It seemed like a good beer to have on a hot summer day when you are craving a sense of consistency, and nothing ""seasonal"" or unique. Don't drink and review."
"This beer pours a pale golden color with a light lacing. A skunk grainy smell that gives you a little bit of a cringing sensation. The taste is a little on the sour side. It has a grainy sweet flavor with a pungent slightly fruit back to it. There are underlying hints of a metallic alcohol flavor that lave a bad aftertaste. It has a crisp feel slightly airy texture and finishes light. In all this is an ok beer. As far as the style goes itÂ’s fairly good. ItÂ’s defiantly a beer that I would have to drink with something else to eat. I wouldnÂ’t recommend this beer but as far as the style goes I canÂ’t knock too much."
"Pretty much I don't know which is worse: the skunky one or the boxed one. They're both complete opposites of each other and I could drink both at the same amount in one night. It's pretty weird man. I'm going to experiment and compare bottles that have been in the fridge and in the box. But this time, I'm going to make sure both are from the same brew date. St. Pauli Girl has no brew date to my knowledge."
"As it goes for cheap german style pilsners, this is not so bad. The mouthfeel is tingly on the tastebuds with the carbonation. This is a nice change every once in a while."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"Ugh--skunky aroma hit as soon as I opened the bottle. As I poured it, a pleasant cloudy lemon-gold color made me briefly forget the smell.. but my excitement was quickly damped as it settled down to a far less interesting clear golden yellow with a medium pure white head. The smell got progressively better in the glass, still strong enough at first that I dreaded lifting it to my mouth for a sip, but finally giving way partially to sweetness with a hint of lemon. Taste was better, a well blended mix of unidentifiable sweetness, hops and a subtle citrus, very nicely complemented by an almost creamy thickness and a fizzy kick, but the aftertaste was all sweet and left a bad impression. I can see this being pretty good fresh, though the sweetness should really be toned down. But as it is I'm not looking forward to finishing this six-pack."
"Drinkability rings in slighty above average. I put St.Pauli Girl right there with most European Lagers and beers like Beck's, Heineken and Stella Artois."
"Poured a pale yellow almost clear body with a slight head. The smell and the taste where rather skunky. It might not of been a bad beer if it was taken better care of. However, what did give it points is that it was very thin and refreshing on a hot summer day even with the taste."
"This beer poured a clear straw color with a persistent head. The smell was hoppy and a bit citrus like. The taste was a classic pilsner with a bit of a citrus undertone Â– but other than that, nothing to make this beer stand out. The mouthfeel was thin and the carbonation was very noticeable. This would be decent cold beer on a hot day."
"St. Pauli Girl is the definition of mediocre euro lager. I might drink this, if someone left it in my fridge (like this bottle), but I wouldn't waste my own money on it. You can do better than this."
"Don't get me wrong. This isn't a bad beer, it's just I was expecting something that approached a German Pils. This is more reminiscent of a bland Helles or Export. If you are looking for an inoffensive lager to relax after mowing the lawn, then this beer is for you. If you are looking for something with more character try a Jever or Dortmunder."
"Eric"
"Basically this is an average German pilsner available in the US. A bit better than some in certain respects, but not others. As mentioned, it's perfectly drinkable, and maybe it would be good with food, but on it's own it becomes a bit tired after a bit. Sure, I'd have another... but I'd rather have something different."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a descent white head that doesnt stick around. The aroma is mostly grainy, with some hints of corn and a slight herbal hoppiness. The flavor isnt much of an improvement with more grainy flavors, and some hints of corn, some slight hoppiness and metallic flavors. The mouthfeel is light with high carbonation and drinkability is the one category this beer does well. An ok euro pale lager...definately not a serious german pilsner."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear straw color with an half inch head that reduces down to a small layer as time passes. Smells has some funkyness to it, like slightly skunky. Taste reafearms smell, some funkyness. Other than that a standard mass produced pilsner, a bit better than US domestic pilsners."
"This is pretty much an average pilsner all around. Much better than domestics, but nothing to write home about. Yellowish color, slight head. Skunky, sort of off-putting aroma. A bit of a pale-sweet malt flavor, but dominated by skunky hops. Average mouthfeel for a pils, can be quite drinkable (epescially if you find them at a bar for $5, thanks Nomad)."
"The brewery says that 'you never forget your first girl'. That's true, but I have forgotten my first St. Pauli Girl. And my second and my third and my fourth. I drank SPG and SPG Dark on occasion years ago, but the flavor profile isn't familiar. More to the point, this isn't a beer that I want to remember from this point forward. I'd like to quickly forget what is sure to be my last (St. Pauli) Girl."
"Overall: Well balanced, good lighter pils-type lager."
"One beer followed the next until three were consumed. I liked it with the overstuffed roast beef hero and I would like to try it on tap in the future as it appears to me that ALL beers taste better on draft."
"This beer was drinkable with food. I found it to be great when grilling out in the sun, accompanying a steak. Otherwise, it might be good as sparge water."
"Appearance is tyical - light and foamy head with short retention and very little lacing. Smell and taste was average - no skunkiness detected."
"mouthfeel is very light and very bubbly and not this brew's finest point. but its light and crisp flavor makes it pretty drinkable, especially during summer in my opinion."
"Drinkability - Drinkable for a 6-pack, however there are many other more flavorful beers that I find more appealing. Would probably wear on me eventually though."
"Look is typical with a straw color and nice fizzy head. Taste is light and crisp with no offending flavor or odor, just good clean taste. Good all malt alternative to a macro session beer. I think people here tend to rate pilsners low in general."
"This is a very drinkable beer. ItÂ’s not filling, not overpowering with itÂ’s flavor, and has a fairly low ABV. I could drink glass after glass of this beer in a session, and probably not tire of it. Like most pilsners, it would be particularly good on a hot summer day. As pilsners go I think this one is pretty good, but I donÂ’t drink many pilsners, so I donÂ’t have much to compare it with."
"The bottle was part of a ""German Beer Hall Tour"" mix pack my dad gave me for Christmas. A best by date of 03.2006 is printed on the reverse label, followed by the code L 08259 U."
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, very small head, some lacing afterwards. The scent is kinda sweet malty like a pilsner. The taste is malty and sweet as well. Light body. Drinkable for a pilsner, but not the best representation of the style."
"I found this to be a pleasant and drinkable beer. Makes me want to seek out more German Pilsners. I don't really see why this beer has been panned by so many people, I think it's at least decent."
"Typical Euro lager, pours yellow with white fluffy head. Slight metallic taste. Nothing special, perfectly acceptable for guzzling, but not anything to write home about either. Good for a session beer after having a ""good"" beer or two. Green bottles so your mileage may vary."
"I honestly don't even remember much about this beer, but from what I remember it wasn't very good. Not recommended in the slightest from me -- there are better pilseners out there."
"Overall, a pretty bland and uninteresting pilsener. It can be refreshing when cold, but watch out - all of the unpleasant flavors (mainly cooked veggies/sulfer) come out when served too warm."
"Harsh."
"Reasonable German pilsner plus one of my favorite labels among major brands."
"Notes: below average brew"
"This is an easy-drinking, okay brew, a German macro that's not unlike a lot of America macros, except in Germany, corn and rice are illegal in beer."
"Big plus is the hot German chick on the bottle!"
"Pours a clear straw, with a creamy one finger head that doesn't hold for very long. Lacing is mediocre, and smells of pale malt, german hops, but mostly that distinctive skunk associated with euro lagers. Taste is similiar, with a strong hop bite. Light in body and well carbonated. There is a lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste, but finishes crisp and drinkable. This is not one of my favorite beers, but I feel it is an good interpretation of the pilsner style."
"Pours piss/straw yellow with a small foamy-white head. Smells metallic and skunky like Heineken. Taste is metallic and skunky a first but turns a little hoppy and grassy at the finish. Mouthfeel is harshly carbonated and light-bodied, but probably the least offensive trait. Never like Heineken, this isn't much different. Another skunky Eurolager."
"D: Damn drinkable beer for the price. Goes down smoothly and I enjoyed it. It's close to on par with Heineken but a few pennies less so...I approve!:)"
"They do give work out to some attractive Playboy models who might otherwise be forced to go naked for their paycheck, so that's something."
"24 oz. bottle. Opening the bottle hits with that pissy smell of cheap lager. Drinking it from the bottle on the train, though, I find there definitely is some kind of maltiness to it, but a mishmash of hop bitterness and staleness. No discernable beer style. Humdrum."
"Appearance is a nearly transparent pale yellow with some head and a little sticky lace. Aroma is skunky sulphur. Initial taste begins with sweet malt, barley, malt, floral hops, coriander and light carbonation. Finish abounds in nasty, dry cooked vegetable flavor. Yuk."
"Pale gold in color with a wispy white head, this brew was mildly light-struck / skunky which competed with some light maltiness in the aroma. The flavor has some maltiness with a nice hops presence, not so much hops flavor just ample bitterness. A bit thin and watery, this brew is better than U.S. macros due to the higher level of hops but there are many better brews for the same $$ or less"
"Refreshing, tasteful German bier."
"$2 for 24 ounces? Sure! No problem at all with that."
"The drinkablilty for this beer is incredible. Crisp and clean. Goes down so easy that it could be consumed all night, albeit with no thought involved."
"Drinkability: Maybe IÂ’ll try it yet again sometime, and hopefully be able to edit my post to give the beer more favorable marks, but itÂ’s not like IÂ’m rating this on one bottle (though the last bottle went down the drain). You know itÂ’s bad when youÂ’re burping up skunk 5 minutes later. Just downright nasty!"
"Nice label, otherwise not that impressive. still, very drinkable, especially after mowing the grass on a hot day."
"This is a very drinkable beer, excellent for a macro and all the lame adv. Not a bad beer. But not one I will actively seek out."
"From a green 12 ounce bottle, this one pours a very light yellow, completely clear, with average carbonation. ThereÂ’s a fluffy white head that has respectable staying-power. Light aroma of continental hops and a bit of graininess, along with a slight smell of sulfur. Smells like a typical euro-lager. Taste initially has just a bit of malt sweetness, but quickly turns to a crisp finish. Hops are faint, but detectable. ItÂ’s light in body and refreshing, but nothing that IÂ’d seek out. Probably better than other beers of the same style."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Clear very pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Skunky nose. Starts and finishes with some hops and a trace of sweetness, there is a dry metallic after taste. I don't see why this is rated as high as it is, poor example of a pilsner. Freshness date - Nov 2005. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Overall-if your preference is Euro lager, you'd be hardpressed to find a better one that St. Pauli Girl, very flavorful and not a lot of skunk while also looking nice and going down smooth. If you like euros, give St. Pauli Girl a shot, as it is among the better euro lagers in my opinion"
"St. Pauli Girl, (SPG) pours with a one-inch white foamy head, and is a light champagne color. A stream of fine bubbles can be seen rising from the center of the glass. Upon the initial pour, SPG emanates that diagnostic skunky-sulphurous nose that is akin to Heineken and to a lesser degree, Becks. The profile of this beer is lean, with a corn like aftertaste and a latent hint of saltiness on the finish, nowhere as upfront and vivacious as its neighbor in Bremen, Becks. SPG is on the Atkins diet, and needs to put on some weight by increasing her carbohydrate intake. This beer lacks the bitter element that makes even other mainstream pilsners true to their heritage. Although crisp and somewhat refreshing, SPG lacks the goods that otherwise would of made her a ""looker", but she remains, nevertheless, the nice German girl next-door."
"Pours a foamy white head sitting atop a crystal clear straw body. Smells of grassy malt and not much else. Relatively skunk-free, though. Taste is very strong in grassy malt, lots of carbonation. This is another run-of-the-mill euro lager, which is not a bad thing, but it is like trying to compare Budweiser with MGD with a lot of these."
"Fresh 12oz bottle, my Dads brew of choice for a few weeks. Light gold with a nice head of fluffy white foam. Aromas are of grape-like hops, and lightly bready malts. The taste is a nice blend of the fruity hops and light malts. This is definately a light euro-lager, but it is one of the best ones out there. The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing and the drinkability is good as well. Like Becks, but better."
"Pours like a Bud Light or something with that super-pale watery yellow and a fizzy head that started to fade before the beer was even all the way in the glass. Beer was skunked, but after that wafted off, there wasnÂ’t a whole lot left. It tasted kind of like corn flakes, oddly enough. This was a really lousy beer edging on a drain pour, but I managed to finish it off."
"this is pretty much as average a brew as you can get: no real faults nor are there any real redeeming qualities either. it pours what you'd expect: a mild golden colour with plenty of carbonation and a moderate though pretty much non-sticky head. there's a bit of sweetness to the smell, but overall it's a bland mixture of malt and hop. nothing else really stuck out to me. the flavour is more of the same. it's crisp and bubbly and easy drinking, but that's about it. strangely, i often find myself ordering this one when i see it on the menu. most often this is because it's a slight saviour from the macro garbage that takes up the rest of the beer menu (if you want to call it that) at whatever establishment i happen to be at, as this one isn't as common as i remember it being in the past, but it is still found amongst (as i guess it should be) all the macro stuff and heineken, becks, bass, etc. when it is on the menu."
"Overall: A terrible beer. I tried this just because I needed to understand the antithesis of craft beer. This is it. Look no further and avoid if all possible. This definitely provides perspective and a contrast to the usual fare of fine brews I have grown accustom to."
"Light taste. I had to check to make sure this wasn't a light beer. Nope. Thin as water, it doesn't offend but sure as hell doesn't impress. Vanishes instantly on the swallow. Not bad if all you need is a something to mindless quaff by the grill. Chalk this one under the ""kissing your sister"" category."
"This is a decent macro import that is always on sale here and is great for warm weather drinking. It pours a golden color with a good white head that stays for awhile and leaves a thin sheat of lace down my glass. The smell is a littly funky but not bad, and has a decent ammount of malt in the nose as well. The taste is refreshing with its crisp bite, good malt flavors and a slight hop flavor as well. This is my macro import of choice."
"The beers as it disembarks the 12-ounce green bottle pours a transparent gold with a medium sized white head that is spumous in texture and the residual lace a thin sheet. Nose is all malt; sweet, crisp and fresh, start is quite sweet, fair to middling malt presence, the top thin. Finish is moderate in acidity, the hops meek and mild, dry aftertaste, a drinkable if light beer for this old beer swiller."
"Will probably wait til they put a new model on the label before I trouble myself with this beer again."
"Overall St. Pauli does an nice job with this beer, but it isn't anything spectacular. Solid, unoffensive, and easy-to-drink."
"Overall I like this beer, fairly smooth, good taste, doesn't go down as easy as some but not bad overall. Good to try something different if your in the mood for something new. Overall not a bad beer now and again but wouldn't drink it regularly.Maybe it's great on tap, never had a chance to try it."
"Pours a very light straw yellow with an inch head that quickly fades away to the depths of the glass, lacing is pathetic, not much to speak of at all. The smell is of grain and metal. The taste is very light and crisp with floral notes with tad bit of herbs. Malt tone brings sweetness to the grainy aftertaste. I could drink a few of these on those nice days in the sun but better Pilseners out there, still not bad for 1.59 for a 24oz."
"This is the best warm weather beer I've had in a long time. So why am I drinking it now? It's rainy and nasty in Spokane right now! Yesterday a tornado touched down 2 miles from where I was working and there was so much hail it looked like it had snowed an inch (if you think a tornado is freakishly rare for Spokane, you are 100% right). I'll have to remember this when the weather is warm and predictable enough to safely do some outdoor grilling. This beer was a nice surprise as I'd always assumed it was just a German Heineken, in that it was made for people who equated imported with good and had no actual taste in beer."
"--Joey"
"Pours about the palest yellow I've ever seen in a beer, crystal clear. Carbonation was readily apparent. Head was large, coarsely bubbled, and did not last long at all. Smell was skunky with maybe a little grain peeking through. Thin, watery, fizzy mouthfeel. Little bit of sweet malt flavor up front, followed by slightly grassy hop flavor. The taste was better than you'd expect it to be judging from the smell. However that skunky smell keeps this from being very drinkable!"
"Sinkability Â– This one is heading for the drain."
"Pours into the pilfered-from-Outback 22oz. mug with a pillowy and soft snow white head. The liquid is a pale, washed-out yellow, adequately carbonated. Initial skunk hits the nose when freshly poured which seems to dissipate when exposed to air for a bit. After that, lightly grassy malty notes with slight metallic tones. The taste is very light semi-sweet maltiness, brief weak delicate hoppiness....quite watery. Finishes light, spritzy. A German lawnmower brew, that's about it. Hard to believe back in the late '70's this was what I considered ""kick-ass imported beer""... how times have changed (thank God)!"
"Drinkability is really great even from a slightly skunked bottle this is delicious!"
"As far as macro-imports go, this is pretty average. It poured a light straw yellow with little head and no lace. The was skunky, yet there was a faint scent of hops. I tasted a slight hop taste, but nothing to write home about. It was kind of watered down for me, but it was a little better than Becks or Heineken. It went down pretty smooth. I think the pin up girl ws the best part of the whole experience."
"Pale fizzy yellow colors. Tight bubbly white head, faded fast. It looks like what most pilseners I have had looks like. Moderatly refreshing smell, some fresh saaz hop presence. Grainy, fresh cut grass, and buttered corn on the taste. Grain tastes were more mushy toward the finish. Not alot of crispness to the flavors, is what I am trying to describe. Tight carbonation. Grainyness is not overwhelming, no ""skunked"" qualities that are associated with green bottled beers. Certainly more tasty and refreshing than other European green bottled lagers. Might be worth a look under desparate circumstances."
"Pretty decent mass-market German Pils. Very pale, with thin white head that fades away. Slight skunk that dissipates and gives way to sweet malt and noble hop aromas. flavor is sweet pilsner malt and grassy hops--likely hallertau. Finishes with refreshing bitterness. There are many, many beers I'd choose over The Girl but she is a solid brew that I'd buy again. Goes well with the sexy posters."
"I was anything but impressed with anything regarding this beer.The head was medium sized, frothy and white and contained fine-small bubbles. The body was clear, lightly carbonated with a pale yellow hue.The nose was slightly hoppy and skunky with a slightly bitter and acidic flavor that left a lingering aftertaste.The mouthfeel was a little tingly and medium bodied.There was virtually no lacing with this beer."
"A reasonable example of macro-brewed German pilsner for the masses (as opposed to smaller, regional brews of the fine crafty ""northern"" German pilsners)."
"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A lighter bodied, lighter tasting mild lager. Some malt and hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light yet full. Nice taste. Very refreshing. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a typical pale yellow, with not much head and no visible lacing. Aroma was slightly skunky, and that is about all. Taste is slightly sweet and hoppy, but watery thin. Much like any typical macro. You could drink alot of these. Not to bad but not what I really like."
"Nice head and lace. Rich golden color. Aroma of hops permeates the immediate area quickly after pour. Hop presence in taste dominates, but is not overpowering. Hop flavor bites on the tip of the tongue and lingers there as an aftertaste. Not a session beer for me, but definitely a beer I would return to occasionally."
"As I have said, this is less offensive than Beck's, and is quite thirst quenching. Not great by any means, but for a macro-import this is a reasonable thirst-quencher."
"John"
"Not a standout by any means, and I'm sure all that needs to be said has been said by others... Crisp golden color with a head that seems to disintegrate in the blink of an eye. Weak aromas...wet grass clippings and grain...maybe? Starts a little malty-sweet with a very thin grain taste and finishes with hops that are more like that taste you get when you roll around in the hay or grass for a while than truly bitter or balancing. Since it's a little weak upfront, I guess that it's OK that it's a little weak in the finish as well. Pretty thin. But hey, it works, right?"
"This beer pours a bright yellow color with very little head. The aroma was very skunky to me (this is how most German Pils smell to me) - very similar to Heineken. Maybe I just got a skunky one, who knows. The taste was a little sweet and pretty hoppy. The taste isn't as skunky as the aroma leads you to think - surprisingly unskunky taste. This is a fairly smooth drink, but not too much to my liking. Much like the Heineken, I'm not too fond of it just because I don't like the taste, but I can't find anything more specific than that to describe it with. I would easily drink this if I had few options, but I prefer others."
"Sampled from a fresh 24 oz. bottle directly out of a sealed case (not skunked!). An absolutely crystal clear straw-gold body is capped by a creamy bright-white head of foam. The head retention is fairly good, but it eventually drops to just a creamy collar and whispy surface covering. Thin lacing, however, is left throughout most of the glass. The nose is limited, but displays a light touch of herbal/spicy hops amidst sweet malt. The body is light/medium and it's mildly crisp and then lightly creamy and smooth across the palate. The flavor displays a low level hop flavor and underlying bitterness that's tightly woven within a softly sweet malt. It's so well intertwined, in fact, that the beer seems almost one-sided. Of course, that does lend somewhat to a ""give me more"" drinkability. It appears to include andjunct, but the bottle label clearly states that it's ""brewed in strict accordance with the German purity law of 1516"". If that's actually true, I'm sure they must be using a good deal of highly undermodified ""chit"" malt as the flavor seems lacking in any real ""grainy"" character. It finishes dry with a subtle lingering note of sweet malt that's eventually backed up by a low bitterness. As much as it's not a great beer from Germany, it's still a pretty decent European-style lager. It's clean and exceptionally well balanced."
"Mouthfeel is decent but slightly thin. Drinkability is ok as long as I have no other options."
"How did I drink so much of this in high school? Pale yellow/straw colored with a white head of highly carbonated bubbles. The head runs away quicly, but leaves a bit of thin lace. Smell is pronounced, and is full of sulfur and a metallic undertone. I detect some malt, and some of the bitter smell might be hops. There is malt in the flavor, but the sulfur comes through strongly and sticks to the sides of the tongue. Mouthfeel is very watery. There is a distinct metallic aftertaste."
"Borderline ok. not much of a smell and rather an average coloured beer with a thin and unexciting foam head. Not much of a taste rather than how should it put it...average lager style bitterness and lackey presence of any other. again, an average mouthfeel and drinkability. wont try it again."
"Crystal clear yellow with an average white head that did not last. No lacing. Slight skunk smell from the light green bottle upon the open. The taste is really very average but has a bit of breadiness at first that is somewhat intriguing. The flavor is bittered by some fair hopping but this really not an impressive beer. The aftertaste is stronger than the thin, watery body. Not a good representative of German lagers."
"At least the girl on the bottle was happy!"
"Pours a light, almost clear golden color, with a large, but vaporating head. Adjuncts noted on the nose, some grassy hints lingering, maybe skunky. The taste on mouthfeel are both quite thin, a grassy and grainy combined taste and feel. Just a light wheat aftertaste, smooth, yet watery. Not the worst, these are drinkable, they just thrash the palate."
"Quite a drinkable beer if you are thirsty."
"pours out a dark yellow colour. thin and short lived head. no lace. doesn't even look that good. strange metallic nose. flavors of strained grain and a bitter, metallic aftertaste. dirty, earthy hops float around and contrast with the weak maltiness. rough mouthfeel. this isn't that good of a beer IMHO. although i picked up absolutely no skunkiness, it would be almost welcome to cover up some other off flavors. one of the worst euro beers ive sampled. the blonde on the label with the big...um...beer mugs kind of catches my eye though. good label, bad beer."
"Rather pale straw color with a small white head and effervescent carbonation, minor lace, poor head retention. Quite a bit of skunk in the nose as well as cracker malt and mild hops. Taste begins with a sting of carbonation at the tip of the tongue, cracker malt flavor is prominent, followed by slightly bitter and lingering botanical hops. Finish is dry and clean. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, better than expected. A slightly better than average example of the style."
"St. Pauli Girl: Truly awful. In the traditional 12 ounce green bottle, with a date of 11/03 marked somewhere on the back. Very pale yellow, with a big white frothy head, could not hide the incredible skunked aroma. The aroma was also dominant in the taste as well. This was a substantially below average beer, until about four hours later, when the skunk taste was still there. Bad."
"Pours an amber yellow color with a white head with decent lacing. This is a German macro that kicks ass on American macros. Taste is malty, with very modest hoppiness. You do get the feeling that the ingredients have been played out, however. Still, a decent beer."
"Nice light golden colour with extremly limited head.....slight skunky aroma which is most prominent on introduction to this product....the taste is of the hops and lingering.....medium body and light carbonation.....it has limited appeal.....but glad I met it....."
"Pours a clear and pale straw color with a thin and bubbly white head. Nose is fresh malts and grains and is also a bit bitter. Taste is a bit bland with some malt sweetness. Very crisp and refreshing. Just like Heineken and BeckÂ’s, this is a very average brew that is nice on a hot day."
"Not much complexity, but this is a nice, malty German lager. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a slight bubbly carbonation. I would only drink this stuff more frequently if a beautiful woman dressed as the St. Pauli Girl was serving it to me."
"Pours a clear golden hue with a medium head that disappears rapidly. Smells slightly skunky with light earthy grains in the background. The taste consists of semi sweet grains with a twang throughout and finishes with carb bite and a light hoppy bitter. This light bodied brew is drinkable enough, but lacks alot to be desired in the character department. Prosit!"

"Conclusion: This is a marketing phenomenon, not a real beer."
"If you want to spend your money wisely, though, simply look at the magazine ads, and then put your dollars toward Jever or better yet, Bitburger, which is a truly awesome German pilsner."
"In high school, I thought I was upscale if I drank this. Slightly better than Heinikan, with the same yellowish hue. You can barely taste the hops, but there is no bad aftertaste. This beer is definetly brewed with mass marketing in America in mind."
"Good bier. It is similar to Heineken but better. It has a golden straw color to it and a clear but slightly funky skunk smell to it. The taste is just a step above Heineken. The mouthfeel and drinkability is very smooth and easy. I really enjoy this beer."
"A boobiemanÂ’s beer!"
"Saint Pauli Girl is a fairly good green bottle German Beer that goes well with food and friends, or all by its self."
"Initial aroma of graininess, but turns to a fresh hops smell.  Pale yellow and crystal clear.  Head is fizzy and thins fairly quickly.  Taste is a little grainy and a little sweet at the start.  Has appropriate dryness and crispness for style.  Mildly lingering dryness.   Thinner feel, but plenty of carbonation.  There are better beers for style, but this is drinkable and I doubt I'll turn it down it offered."
"A very mediocre beer.  As others have mentioned, the St. Pauli girl on the label is nice, but that is about the extent of this beer's redeeming qualities.  Pours out to a slightly, darker golden color, with a bizarre smell.  Taste is that of light struck hops.  If fresh, this can be decent, but with so many other good choices out there, this one isn't high on my list."
"it beats a heine or a becks any day. it has very drinkable characteristics being light and crisp. the flavor is a bit bitter which may turn many people away, but it is still a decent brew."
"All-around average beer. There are much better Pilsners out there that are less skunky. I don't know if they will ever learn to do away with the green bottles. It's usually Russian Roulette with these."
"Pale yellow color with almost no head.  Toasted grain with a slight touch of skunk.  Crisp sweet, floral, herbal, spicy flavor that is decently balanced between the malt and hops with a touch of skunk.  Must be the green bottle.  If it weren't for the skunkiness, this could be a good lager.  Nevertheless, IMHO, St. Pauli Girl is better than a Heineken and a Becks."
"Spicey and herbal  hop character.   Light body, finishes dry.  Very pale straw color.  Not quite as good as grolsch, but a decent Pilsner none-the-less."
"Clean and crisp appearance, with moderate head. Light amber/yellow in color.  Fresh tasting with abundance of hops, but nicely balanced by malt.  Finishes a little weak. Not the best of German beers."
"I don't drink this one very much any more.  Actually new a girl in college that was a St. Pauli Girl.  Really wish they would get away from that."
"Light straw hue w/ a moderate head and typical Pils clarity.   The grassy, mildly spicy Saaz hop nose hits my nose at first but the mild skunky mercaptans detract from my enjoyment. Hop bitterness is quite firm and adds to the crispness of this beer.  Fuller in body than other German Pilsners.  The slight skunked flavors compromise what would be a pretty good Pilsner.  St. Pauli Girl finishes soft, clean, a touch grainy, and a bit sweet.  Although not a particularly great pilsner, I'll take this over a Heineken any day."
"Angela Little is still the best St. Pauli Girl in history."
"The color is gold / yellow. Starts sweet on the palate with some hop spiciness / zesty towards the finish. Nice and light  feel to the mouthfeel and goes down very easily. Overall all I think this is an enjoyable lager. Went well with my cheese steak!"
"Clean and crisp, if in shape, which is not often by my experience...drank 'em in the 80s until Sam Adams showed that cold fermenters had more flavor potential...honestly, I've had very few St. Paulis that weren't ""skunked"" -- sometimes, severely..."
"More or less skunked depending on how old it is and where it has been stored. Either way there is that underlying overcooked hop aroma and flavour ... not as bad as some other known skunk laden imports though."
"In the old days, it used to be pizza and St.Pauli Girl on Fridays for lunch. Knocked back plenty of these. Still it's a respectable, clean (when it's not skunky), crisp and refreshing brew."
"Lightly hopped with a mild fruity/candy sweetness.  Mouthfeel on the thin side.  If only the beer was as attractive as the beergarden maiden on the bottle."
"Notes: An okay brew, even despite those awesomely cheesy adverts and stigma on imported lager -- in comparison to others of the same style."
