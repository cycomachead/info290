3.36,1.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Tried on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary, a classic lager start to the evening. I have also tried this in bottles. Classic German pilsener in the glass, a gold straw color with a smattering of white foam on top. Aroma was quite subdued, I do not possess the world's greatest olfactory sense but I can usually get more than this, especially from something on tap ... Faint cracker malts and musty hay-like noble hops on the nose, and more of the same on the palate. Fortunately I could taste more than I could smell, the aforementioned noble hops were prominent and fairly enjoyable, fresh grass and hay playing off some herbal notes like mild licorice and bitter watermelon rind. There is a grainy cracker-like malt backbone with hints of green grape fruitiness and a grain husk astringency. Aggressive carbonation along with a little metallic copper afterburn. Crisp and dry with less residual sweetness, DMS, and doughy character than most commercial Euro lagers. A decent noble hops showcase on tap (less fresh in the bottles I've sampled) and a pretty standard German pilsener for the purists, albeit one with a macro-brewed feel: Fizzy, harsh, and rather vapid.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 27, 2013"

Smell is intensely skunky after the pour but it dissipates over time and gives way to some malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the initial blast of skunk is quite unpleasant.","UCLABrewN84","Beers"

Body itself is quite good but is hampered by the lame carbonation. Finish is like flavor and slowly tapers off in medium length. Really could have given this beer a much higher score, were it not for the bubbles which are crucial to a Pilsner of any type including the Germans. For some examples: appearance - the image of the clear yellow liquid with a couple little trails of bubbles rising to the top is a key part of its beauty; in aroma - it's that gas coming out of solution that carries some of those components to the nose.

This is one of those beers that I'll probably pick up again without realizing that I've already tried it... then I'll get home and check BA and be slightly aggravated that I didn't recall ever having it.

The beer presents a perfumy, hoppy smell that's backed with a little pale malt. Not bad, actually. There's a bit of a bread and dough flavor that comes out in the taste. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a metallic quality that shows up in the mid-taste. The finish is subtle and soft. Medium to light in mouthfeel, with a smooth quality.

Taste is suprisingly fresh and light; flavors of medium bodied malts cross over to a white bread note, with hints of floral hops lingering in the background. Not bad.

Taste is very pleasant, very malty and a slight nuttiness in the back. Low bitterness, but enough to keep it interesting. Mouthfeel isn't as bitey as I'd like, but it's a mild complaint. This is a slightly above average pils, thirstquenching and highly drinkable. Not the best ever, but good.","trevorwideman","Sep 19, 2005"

Nevertheless it made me very reluctant to take that first sip. When I did I was relieved that it was still 'good'. Color is pale and has the color of urine the morning after a hard night's drinking. Not something that makes you go yum. Taste is drinkable. Its nothing great nothing bad--a perfect 3. Herby flavors are there along with a dominate but lightly bitter hop profile. Mouthfeel is comparable to memories of American macro-lagers and not of any German Pils ive had before.","allboutbierge","Sep 30, 2003"

The smell is a well-balanced mix of malt and flowery hops. The mouthfeel is just a tad tingly and dominated by malt. The taste starts as sweet barley, with a lovely flowery hop bitterness giving chase. The aftertaste is all hops. A fine product indeed.","Globetrotter","Nov 13, 2002"
3.85,16,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew has a light and grainy aroma that hints at caramel. Pours a light sparkling golden. The huge fluffy white head has excellent lacing and is everlasting with a full 2 inches remaining at the bottom of my pilsener flute. The sweet flavor has no acidity and finishes mildly bitter.
