"Had this in a bottle.  I really liked the lager.  Was smooth, easy drinking and wish it was a hot summer day."

"Pours clear, light amber color with very little head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. A somewhat bitter, nutty flavor."

"O- this drinks more like an adduct lager than anything, not one of their best   3.25"

"Pours a dark amber color with a one inch foamy slightly off white head that dissipates VERY quickly. No real lacing is left along the glass so visually there is nothing at all noteworthy about this beer. The smell and taste is grainy and sweet. I think it's actually a very well-balanced beer -- perfect amount of carbonation and just the right amount of a slight sugary sweet caramel overtone to it.  A little sour finish however."

"This was better than what I was expecting. Matt brewing Company did a nice job with this one."
" Overall a 3.25 is given to Saranac Adirondack Lager from Matt Brewing Company. This was pretty damn refreshing after a five mile hike on a humid day in July. I'll probably pick this up again."

"Part of an assorted trail mix. Popping the top yields a bready waft of sweet malt. Pours to a orange yellow sparkling colour with an off white head. On the taste the brew is a consistent balanced combination of the ready malts and a noble like hoppiness. Taste stays the same throughout then the finish stays bitter and fades. A great brew for the style. Spot on. Very drinkable and flavorful with a disguised 5.5 AC."

"Overall nothing extraordinary but very solid. I would never turn down this beer and would pick it up again in an instant. Very drinkable."

"I like to think of craft beer as a caste system, but one that doesnt degrade the lower end of the scale. I put this beer towards the bottom, certainly not an untouchable (that'd be BMC), but also not royalty. However, I am proud to drink this and any Saranac brew on the principle that A) I spent five months doing trail work and climbing peaks in the mighty Dacks, and 2) that Matt Brewing is 100% AMERIKUHN, from Yootika, New Yawk!"
""
""
""
""
"O: good, solid beer from Saranac. What you would expect--easy drinking, but nothing to knock your socks off. Loses carbonation quickly. Good for the price, I would buy again. Good staple to have in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not sure why folks are hatin' on it bc. It was a pretty good beer. I would definitely have it again."

"O: This beer is pretty well balanced with pleasant amounts of sweetness from the malts and bitterness from the hops. Relatively easy to drink and probably a good gateway beer for people just starting out with craft beers. Refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"My ""craft""experience in college in the middle of nowhere, this was one usually around for the night. An ok amber. Pours a light amber golden color with small head. Aroma of sweet malt and very little hop presence. Flavor follows with a strong malt bill, but relative light on the palate. Easy drinking beer with adequate carbonation. Not a great one, but certainly drinkable and perhaps a nice craft intro."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not a great beer, but enough flavor to enjoy."
""
"There's a sturdy crispness to this brew's light to medium body and it's pretty clean, though it dries up a little too fast into a huskier finish."
""
"O - As I said, I'm suprised this beer isn't rated higher. Has an excellent, crisp flavor and is extremely refreshing. Could be one of new go-to session beers. Recommended for people who appreciate a lighter yes still flavorful session beer, or any lager/pilsener fan."

"Saranac Adirondack Lager (2013) - The first beer I ever drank was this brew. It was my introduction to the brewing world. I've come a long way, but I remember just how great I thought this was especially when I tried Coors or Bud or Millers (etc...) in subsequent sessions. Good fluffy head reduces to strong lacing. Reddish amber body. Good carbonation. Very active. Hoppy bitter smell. Sour apples and grapes. Smooth mouth feel. Lemon grass nose. Wheat grass and mild hops middle palate. Skunks a bit in the end to let you know it's a lager. But finishes clean. A little sour. A little bitter. Then grass and lemons on the back palate. The taste of a warm summer's day. Very refreshing. Crisp. After taste is crisp but good generic lager taste. Bitter hops and light malt. Lemon bread if you will. A great hot day brew. Good with BBQ or heavy meals that need a light side. Great alternative to a mainstream lager like Bud or Miller. Far smoother. More refined. Third Shift though changes and game putting this brew down a notch some 13 years from our first meeting. My tastes have matured. So what was once the standard and a 4 in 1999 has become a 3.25 in 2013. This is a good brew, but average. That isn't a put down. It still holds the standard and I would go back to it any time. A solid meal beer or a great end of the day kick back watching a ball game beer. Good."

"O- This is decent. Nothing stands out too much, which is how the style should be. Its an easy drinker, but there are more appealing lagers in my area."
""
""
""
""

"Taste is dominated by malts, nutty, caramel, toasted. Yeast and bread are present throughout with a bit of orange peel in the finish. Also has a metallic note to it, not pleasant, but not a deal-breaker, either. Has a creamy, medium/heavy body with average carbonation. A beer that is too malt dominant to be a favorite of mine, also nothing really stands out here, besides the slight metallic taste."

"The appearance is OK, with a clear amber and white neck (that should retain more, since it is a German Lager). The aroma reminisces graham crackers, with a controlled diacetyl taste. The malt profile is strong, and the hop profile has both the Hallertauer nobleness and the Cascade exuberance. In the taste, the cascade becomes even more discrete. I don't think there is an harmony between malt and hops, but it does not compromise the quality of this beer. The mineral taste in the water is welcome, and the finish leaves us with a very pleasant hoppy taste."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass. Crystal clear gold with a fizzy head that dissipated relatively quickly, but with some nice lacing. Smell was a lot of malt, a bit more yeasty than I expected. Hops not really present in smell. Tasted followed the nose; malty as expected, surprisingly yeasty, although only in flavor; the body was not affected. Mouthfeel was clean and crisp despite the yeast, with hops sneaking in at the end to pinch off the taste. In my opinion there are much better pilsener styles, but this lager is many steps above its mass-produced contemporaries."

"Poured a half inch offwhite head of average lifespan. The body is a clear slightly burnt orange and exhausts all effervescence into the small head. It smells mildly of malt. The taste is mainstream lager with the slightest hint of bitter hops. It's OK, but just an average mainstream lager."

"I guess most people on this site don't like giving this inexpensive and unflashy beer enough credit. No, it is not in some fancy bottle. No, the smell will not knock you over. And no, it doesnt look like its the nectar of the gods. But the taste, aftertaste, cost, and chug-ability of this beer is world class. Saranac attributes much of the wonderful taste of this beer to the water its uses from the Adirondacks. If thats true, and I believe it is, we should be buying bottled water of that stuff. The taste is super smooth, balanced, mild, and has a great aftertaste. This is the Michael Jordan of Lagers in the class of Acura's and Audi's. This beer is easy to drink, and tastes great on tap or in a bottle. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to have more than 3 beers tonight."
"I found the appearance of this beer to be a bit better than the actual taste, but the taste is a significant upgrade to other beers priced about the same."

"O - For never trying this beer before, I am very surprised. Not even 8 dollars for a six pack and I got more than I bargained for. Saranac makes a very interesting yet refreshing beer. Would definitely buy again"

"There is no real wow factor here...its a run of the mill beer, only slightly above average for me. Meh"
"not a bad lager. smells rather pedestrian with some more toasty malts than usual as the only real remarkable note. the flavor is quite good. nutty malt profile, almost more of a vienna lager with the smooth sweeter malt. very sturdy with lots of body for a lager. a longtime staple of the trail mix variety pack these always go fast at my house. if you like your light beer with some girth still, give this one a shot, a true upstate ny classic."

"O - This beer is pretty refreshing and one I'd consider to be above average for the style. I'm not one to drink too many lagers, but with the nice presence of caramel and leafy hops, I would like to come back to this one again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and oddly crisp at the same time, with average/medium carbonation, a medium body and an overall grainy flavor that has just enough herbal notes and hops to make it decent. While easy to drink, it’s just very average and one of the more boring beers from the Saranac lineup."
"Overall, a good, consistent lager that's light and drinkable but has enough flavor to keep fans of more flavorful styles happy. I like to keep it around for its versatility."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First off, I think this more a vienna lager than a german pilsener. It actually reminds me somewhat of SA Boston Lager but not as good. This is a solid but unspectacular brew."
""
"O: A good beer that has no tricks up it's sleeves but it doesn't lead you on that it does."
""
""
""

"Poured a clear coppery shade with full frothy white head. Head unfortunately falls flat within fifteen seconds, leaving a thin film that spots but does not lace, the glass. Aroma was of moist hay and sweet. Taste is a bit muddled, starting slightly sweet and of grain, then changing to a mildly bitey hop. Mouthfeel: I can only say is stale, that is not the crispness I expect from a Pils."
""
"certainly buy it again."

"O: Its a low to mid level lager. Not really craft in my opinion. Saranac has much better options out there. Its not nearly as well put together as say, a sam adams lager, or brooklyn lager. I dont know how it won anything in the great american beer fest, but it did."
"Considering how much Saranac beers cost, I very seldom have too much of a problem with them, and this one is no exception. Adirondack Lager is a little too sweet, and skewed toward the malty side a little more than I would like, but it's an easy drinker that I would probably pick up again when I see pints for $1-$3."
"overall definitely a beer i would like to session with often."
"Very drinkable but not very memorable."
"O: Definitely not a bad way to spend a drinking session. Since I have another in the fridge, I'll probably tackle that at some other point this week."
"Notes: Not too bad of a German Pilsner and definatley drinkable. Cheers."
"Overall - Considering I loved the Lake Effect Lager this variation from Saranca was good but not great."
"A pretty good beer overall. This wasn’t good as I remember it, which means I should probably stop tasting for the night (my fifth so far of a 10-pack variety pack)."
"Grabbed a mix pack of six different types of Saranac. I drank Saranac regularly when going to school in Southern New Hampshire about three years ago but haven't had it since. Took the top off with lighter and it shot across the room. Golden color with a lot of bubbles running up the side of the grass and almost no head. Nose is grainy sweetness and buttery bread. Flavor is subdued compared to the nose. Biscuity but extremely light. The end has a subtle fruity hit but it disappears quickly. That little fruity kick intrigued me to drink faster to try and find it, more defined, again. However it never really stuck out. Finishes crisp and tingly without a lot of dryness. A typical lager that was on the verge of making itself distinct."
"My aggressive pour resulted in a foamy finger of dense, eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a biscuit malt sweetness along with a wheaty cereal quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a slightly bitter, grassy tang to offset the wheatish sweetness. Nice lacing began to form throughout. Finish was semi-sweet with the grassy, wheaty taste lingering well after the swallow. A very pleasant beer."
"An average pilsner, but a very drinkable, sessionable beer."
"Pours a semi-clear light amber color with a 1 inch off-white head that settles to a small cap. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and caramel notes. Taste is of toasted malt, biscuit, and slight citrus zest. Very little bitterness quickly leaves the tongue after each sip. There is a crisp and clean mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good lager and a good choice to include in the Summer pack."
"O: Sooo incredibly average. Not good. Not bad. I don't think I have ever had a beer this adequate in my entire life."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass, the beer pours a nut-orange color, vibrant with a ton of carbonation bubbles and a chunky, dense, off-white head that starts around three inches on the pour and settles into a thin disc layer of film. Aromas are roasty toasty, with a slight dark fruit sweetness in there that seems a bit out of place. The beer has flavors that also have a tangy sour-sweet fruit overtone...maybe plum or grape...that almost cover the toasted characteristics. The toasty turns to burnt in the aftertaste, like grilling a piece of fruit until it is charred. The finish is a little dry, with a cloying sweetness, also. Unique for the style, with a lot more flavors and characters than a usual pilsner. Not bad for a little change of pace."
"D- Honestly, I'm usually a sucker for anything Saranac pumps out, but this one doesn't really wow me. Nice texture and a generally pleasant flavor, but nothing especially impressive."
"O - Not crazy about this one, probably wouldn't drink again. Although i've been lurking and reading BA for awhile, this is my first official review. I guess I've been a bit gun shy. Probably should've picked something better out of my cellar for my first review."
"Notes: Not bad, definitely inferior to SA Boston Lager, Brooklyn Lager or Eliot Ness. With the three excellent examples of Vienna Lager just mentioned I don't see a lot of good reasons to buy this one."
"The beer is clear and light copper in color, with a tiny head that recedes hastily, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is pretty weak, emitting faint scents of sweet malt, fruit, and a general lager presence. The beer is sweet, perhaps a bit much. Grainy, malty, sweet, with a subtle fruitiness. The feel is thin to medium in body, with carbonation level lower than is customary. Overall, this is drinkable, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"D - hmm the color and smells make this stand out from other ""German pilsners"" but it is nice enough. Looks great smells great tastes fine."
"Beer is medium in body and a little harsh on the finish. The whole beer is interesting but not driving. There is a little malt up front but the beer generally fails in my opinion to come together as a beer. There is an aftertaste that really takes me out of it in the end. Oh well, try try again."
"12 oz bottle from a mixed pack. Color is a light amber, which is darker than typical for this style. Head is a little fluffy and a little remains with no lacing. Smell is subtle. Taste is very light (in a good way) and pleasant. A lot smoother than many pilseners but not exactly an amber lager either. Little bit of hops there but mostly malty sweetness. If in the mood for a lager that is neither heavy nor light but simply refreshing, this would probably be a good choice."
"Clean and unassuming beer that manages to strike a balance among all the elements."
"Cheerrrs."
"O - Decent pilsener here but nothing exceptional"
"Drinkability: Purchased in a mixed six pack in Iowa while on a trip. Not available locally; not something I will actively seek out when out travelling again. Even if this were available I don't think that this would be a regular purchase."
"Not a bad beer whatsoever, sweet, easy to quaff, but not that crisp lager taste I was expecting - and indeed, would demand in the summer months. A bit misplaced, but the result is still quite drinkable."
"Taste is light but clean, slight bittering hops give way to nutty roasted malt taste with slight bread chewiness. A good easy drinking beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Overall an excellent beer, that I would definetly buy in a 6 for a summer barbecue."
"Overall nothing overly special about this brew, as microbrews go this is more like a domestic beer."
"A Honeyed gold with amber hues, light white head and decent lacing. Smell is light sweet malt with honey and mild peppery hops. Taste is much the same with a gently sweet dough like center. A faint pear fruitiness follows. Hops are clean and spicy giving an excellent finish. A whole grain cracker lingers with bits of biscuit, dough, and faint hop oil. Feel is effervescent with both quenching and refreshing components and a dry graininess. Weight is on the lighter side of medium. Drinkability is quite good and is a strong suit of this one."
"Taste is light, creamy and a bit bitter with a big iron taste - I keep finding this off flavor in their beers. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with a dry finish. It's an average example of this style at best."
" Real good beer to have with dinner. and the holidays. Turkey dinner and a cold saranac."
"For the price, this is a decent lager."
"Drink ability is good. I could have another one since it's light and tastes good. It a good drinker, easy to go down."
"Overall, not so good. I am not necessarily the biggest pilsner fan but this doesn't taste like a pilsner. It tastes like a watered down Boston Lager. Its just not that enjoyable to drink so I would advise against it. Cheers."
"D - If someone likes Pilseners and isn't too much of a hophead then this would be a nice session beer."
"I'd be happy to drink this again."
"drinks pretty good, and for the price, not too bad of a choice, but there are so many better pilsners out there. i wont be seeking this out again."
"D - Try it, but one was enough for me."
"Tastes like a lager but a better than average one. Easy enough to drink and refreshing."
"D - Easy to quaff and an appealing finish."
"Pours a pale golden color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings forward a tiny bit of Noble hops along with a little bit of grain and bread. Mouthfeel is light with some prickly carbonation. This isn't the best attempt at an American version of the style, but all around it's a fairly decent brew."
"Served with Brat w/ Sauerkraut Spicy Brown on Rye. Matched very well and would definitely recommend to friends as a good matching."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, but not the best for its style. This beer isn't bad, but is far from special."
"D - lacks complexity, boldness, or distinctiveness. Certainly not bad, but disappointing."
"Tastes like it is about 15% abv at times, that was the first negative. A little wood varnish at times. No hops. Some lemon and sugar. Just not the makings or mouthfeel of a good beer. And this stuff is like $7 a 6pack? Are you kidding me."
"Drink - A decent beer... nothing spectacular. Probably would be good for a session, but there are better brews to seek out."
"Feels very good and is very drinkable. It's not the most complex beer but I have a soft spot for German Pilsener."
"It's an interesting pilsner for sure, with the tartness and the comparitively small hop profile. I'd rate it in the average category at best."
"D: This strikes me as something of a cross between a pilsner and an American pale ale. I'm a fan of both styles, so it works for me."
"Saranac Adirondack Lagar pours with a amber colour and a head that pours nicely and never quite goes away due to the good carbonation. The smell is hoppy and sweet. The taste is warm and malty with a smooth fruity aftertaste. This beer has presence in the mouth due to the carbonation. This beer was much better than I expected; it was my favourite beer in the mix pack."
"Final Thoughts: Not much to say, but not much to complain about either. Would definitely recommend, and would probably buy a six pack of this if I was able to find it. (This beer came from a sampler 6 pack)."
"D: Nothing fancy, just a nice middle of the road beer."
"D - Very easy to drink. A sessionable beer. Just wish the taste was above average."
"Mouthfeel is rather dry in the finish, but this is light and fairly drinkable."
"drinkability: not overly impressive but a its good enough to drink more than one."
"Part of the sampler twelve pack. Served in a pils glass. Light, yellow colored body. Lots of carbonation noticed at bottom of the glass. Fizzy white head. Had a musty smell to it. Taste was run of the mill lager. Had a bit of malt flavor, with some notes of leather and orange peel. Mouthfeel was nothing special - mostly just thin and watery and bubbly. Drinkability was decent, as there were no real offending flavors and the body was fairly light. An average beer, which would make a decent session beer, but not a great beer to search for."
"Poured into a pint glass an attractive cloudy orange with a one finger head and little retention. Sweet malty smell of citrus fruits along with spicy clove aromas. Bitter hoppy taste with hints of lemon-lime. Medium body, big carbonation, dry finish. Decent aftertaste. Overall an acceptable beer to try in a Saranac Trail Mix sampler, but by no means worthy of purchasing a whole sixer."
"D: I will gladly have another during any season. It has a good balance and is appropriate year round. Drink with a good heavy meat and potatoes meal or with a hearty soup."
"D: This is a full flavored beer that has great drinkability. This is a sessionable beer."
"T- Quite well balanced but hops and bitterness lose out in the end. There is lots of bready malts going on with just a slight bite from flowery hops."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and refreshing--there's nothing particularly special about the flavors but it's a great way to open up your palate."
"Nothing bad here and to some extent it has some distinctive pieces. I'm just not comftorable with them."
"T-"
"Drinkable? Yes... Forgettable? Yep... A middle of the road pils here..."
"Overall impression: Could stand a fair amount of tweaking. Not recommended."
"Nice carbonation level helps a moderately viscous feel go down somewhat more pleasantly, thus yielding a decent drink. Still limited by apparent sweetness."
"Bottle. Pale copper with thick but quickly dissipating head. Malty aroma with hint of hops and bread. A very nicely balanced beer, though more malty than hoppy. Deceptive depth. A better beer than you might expect, though not in a class with the top lagers. Still, a perfectly acceptable bottle of beer."
"d: i think that for a cheap pilsener this is pretty good; not worth going out of your way for but definitely get it if you need something cheap and there aint much else out there"
"D: This is pretty sweet pilsener and goes down pretty smooth but I could see the sweetness and tanginess getting tiresome after a few of these beers. I'd probably have one more but not much more after that."
"Pours a very clear golden orange/light amber color with a finger of white head. Decent retension and a little bit of lacing is noted on the glass. Nose of this beer is a little grainy, malty sweet, slight note of hops and a bit of butter. Taste is malty sweet upfront with some buttery notes and a slight touch of hops towards the end. Mostly a grainy taste throughout the medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. It has quite a crisp finish but with a bit of a grainy sweetness left lingering in the mouth that clashes with the hop bitterness. Overall not bad."
"Not-bad lager; fuller in body than your typical pilsner. A bit unbalanced toward the malt side, but while average still good for Saranac."
"Overall, this is a nice beer, even tho it is not 100% representative of it's classification. Almost too sweet for this style?"
"D- Refreshing and drinkable would like to try on tap."
"Honeyed amber with a creamy eggshell colored head that leaves fine patchy lace on the glass. Sweet malt and a good whiff of floral hops. Nice sweet maltiness with plenty of oily hop flavors and faint notes of tobacco. Medium full bodied with good carbonation. A little bit strange but good. A pleasant surprise from MBC."
"A medium bodied lager, heavier than most pale lagers; went down smooth enough."
"D - The malt body of this beer is its most distinguishing feature. Despite the dryness of the finish, there is a toasted malt note that lingers in the aftertaste with a thick grainy quality. Unfortunately, the dryness brings out some burnt character in the toast and the base malt does not impart the refined honey notes that you get from good quality pilsner. The hops have a musty, somewhat british quality that some might enjoy, but it does not appeal to me. Overall, this is a decent lager, but not one I would drink again."
"D- A decent pils but there's something just not quite right with it. a little bit off."
"Got this in an Adirondack Trail Mix sixer. The good things about this beer is that the mouthfeel is nice and crisp, and the taste and nose are balanced, but with a little more hoppiness. However, the beer looks like an adjunct lager, and overall, its OK, but it just does not impress me that much."
"Would drink again!"
"I'm not huge into lagers (although there are quite a few I definitely love, I get more excited about ales) but the floral presence in this one makes it a keeper. Smell reminds me of a nice scotch ale (not in taste though) minus the alcohol. Very nice."
"Drinkability: A great pilsner and a great lager. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. I could drink these all day. Give it a shot."
"Pours copper with about an inch of head that retains pretty well. Floral hops are present in the smell, like chrysanthemum and a bit of honey, and some earthy aromas too. Taste seems a little more bitter than the average pils, though it is nice and has a good mouthfeel, a bit on the heavy side, but also pretty crisp from the carbonation. Definitely drinkable, though not transcendent."
"Floral hops fill the aroma along with a little bit of malt. Flavor is light and well balanced. A little bit of sulphur but it's crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is high, and it's certainly drinkable if you're in the mood for a pils."
"Not bad, somewhere in-between Dos Equis and Sam Adams, maybe leaning closer to Dos Equis."
"The taste is weird. Very harsh and bitter at first taste then finishes sweet with slight mango/lemon flavor. But also a bitter flavor like eating the orange peel. Not a great tasting beer at all. I will not be buying this particular Saranac beer again."
"I usually agree with the overall consensus here on BA but with this one I think the ratings are a bit harsh. I live quite close to the brewery and this is a great, reasonably priced lager."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, malts with some hops. Taste is primarily of hops, some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent beer."
"d- excellent. i cant wait to get my hands on more of this stuff. i must say this was totally unexpected to get a perfect 5 out of a mixed six pack of saranac. wow. an awesome overall beer."
"D: A wonderfully drinkable lager from Saranac. A relaxing, stress-free beer."
"Pours with a bright clear bronze color and a thick off white cap of foam. The head dissapears pretty quickly and does not leave much lacing. The smell is mild with some malt and a faint whif of hops. The beer is medium bodied with a nice level of carbonation. The initial taste is the mild sweetness of lightly toasted malt, followed by some strange metallic flavor. I detected some whiskey like notes as well. The finish is all spicy hops and even a little alchohol flavor. This beer strikes me as a poor man's SA Boston Lager. My impression is that they were striving to create a clone, but ended up with something not quite as smooth, refined, and tasty as the SABL. Overall a drinkable beer, but something that I would order only if BudMillerCoors was the only other option at the time."
"D: Goes down smooth, no bad aftertastes or anything either."
"in conclusion this was a very enjoyable beer makes me wish i could find more of there beer in my area."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of fluffy head. It is a golden amber color. It smells fresh, sweet malts. It has a bit of the Miller Lite skunky taste, but it is better than that crap. I'm not really diggin' this beer. Maybe it would taste better after noon."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a successful Pilsener offering for me. Pours deep golden with amber tinges. Good white head with some rings of lacing. Smells of grain, light caramel and grassy hops. Taste is much of the same. Simple and solid. Very well balanced. Light crispness in the mouth. Good carbonation and light bodied. Very well drinkable."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer. All the flavors were there in a nice mix. Nothing was overpowering."
"This is not one of your Daddy's crappy old lagers! Saranac balances the elements and has produced a truly fine product here; extremely drinkable, with a lot of ""personality"" in the taste and in the body of the brew. THIS IS A HOP LOVERS LAGER!"
"Poured 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a light amber color with a thin head. Leaves a decent amount of lace as you finish the beer. Fairly malty aroma with hints of caramel, some raisins and grain. Taste is medium bodies with a bit on the sweet side with a light hint of hoppiness. A pleasent sweet finish. A nice session lager."
"Overall a very drinkable German pilsner. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall easy to drink and not offensive, a decent German Pils."
"D: Well, its not that great. Its not horribly bad as far as lagers go, but it does have that chemical X factor that is holding this back. Its ok is the best way I can put it. I guess you could say that there are some macro offerings I would absolutely take over paying a premium for this. Not much I can say because there is not much going on. Ah well, moving on."
"Pours a transparent amber with large frothy white head that leaves little lacing. Aroma of hops, sweet malt, grass, earth. A malt-forward lager: light hops from center through finish, caramel, brown sugar, dew and grass notes. Light and crisp but not refreshing. A bit too sweet for my taste."
"D - This is a great lager and one that I could easily use as a session beer or a gateway beer for a BMC friend."
"can't compare oranges to apples, but the finish of this compares quite so with yuengling lager LIGHT....sour unSweetness that dominates. i like that! but this is not a light....no wonder i have to stand by this grading...and for a LIGHT, the much 'higher' rating for the YLL...."
"Overall - A good casual drinking brew. Enough character to satifsy my tastebuds, but light enough to have several of in a sitting. Underrated, in my opinion."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours light, clear and yellow, with a medium white head. The aroma is grassy and herbally. The taste is light crisp and pleasantly bitter. It is a decent pilsner light, crisp and easily Quaffable."
"M & D - Didn't really enjoy drinking it, probably wouldn't order another."
"Very enjoyable sesh with this one. Light, golden-yellow pour. Way over carbonated for my liking, but a refreshing, crisp American lager taste. Actually liked its thin drinkability and think it has the makings for a new stellar session beer. Additionally, for those who haven't been -- if you're in the Upstate NY region, the Saranac factory in Utica is a pretty sweet tour/shop/pub. HUGE facility and capacity; manage some other pretty good brews too."
"Cloudy amber color with minimal dissipating head. Smells of malt and hops. Unusually light, smooth , refreshing lager. Can taste the malt and a little bit of the hops. This came in a multi-six pack and this is the third one I tried. Out of the three, this one comes in second."
"a drinkable brew, yet nothing special. at all."
"Pours a clear amber with a great big frothy head that looks very appealing. Smells of sweet, carmelly malts, floral hops. Medium bodied beer that tastes pretty simple and straightforward of honeyish and lightly toasty malts with an almost oily hoppiness. In my opinion this is one of Saranac's better beers."
"This isn't my favorite beer, but on terms of style, this beer is excellent. Probably one of the best you can get for this price. A Great beer."
"Great mouthfeel on this one. Very creamy and smooth. Not watery like some brews of this style are. Some slight hop bite to this. It's faint, but it's there. Malt is the main player, but not overly so. This is a really well-done beer in my mind. This would be my new session lager if I could find it in a 6-pack here. Recommend."
"Out of a bottle this beer was an orange/amber color with a short lived head. The lacing was pretty good however given the poor retention. The aroma was slightly sour and a mix of classic lager malt, some hop bitterness and a bit of dry yeast. The flavors were balanced, opening with a hoppy bitterness, a doughy malt middle that then proceeds to a floral hop finish. The body was medium, the mouthfeel smooth and the carbonation medium/high. A pretty good lager and one of the better Saranac offering."
"The Adirondack Lager is definitely best. Great pour and color, with a powerful, flavorful taste. A must try!"
"M - Crisp and biting, but enjoyable"
"Poured to a half finger head and quickly dissolved to a small ring around the grace. Little to no lacing. The color was more of an orangish/red than the yellow straw of a pilsner. Very little aroma from the glass. A very plain flavor, maybe because a pilsner is what most of the big companies sell (bud, miller) that I found this to be a rather ordinary flavor, something you could give a bud drinker and they would take to it. Not much in terms of hops or malt flavor. It is a very drinkable beer. This is one of the Saranac beers that may be too balanced, nothing distinctive about it."
"Copper colored, with a big foamy head that is gone in seconds. Some lacing around on the glass, but no retention. Smell is corn and malty, maybe a touch of hops in there somewhere too. Taste is sweet up front and then dries in the finish. Little hops present. Another uninspiring brew from Saranac."
"Drinkability: This one is a sure sessioner, enjoyable yet not too reserved. A great offering from Matt Brewing."
"(rated May 2, 2007)"
"Drinkability is fine, this is a pretty good lager. When I saw it listed as a pilsner I got confused. Good beer from Saranac, one of my favorites."
"Pretty refreshing and easy drinking. Not something I'd seek out very often, but a light, easy drinking brew."
"Mouth feel is fairly light. Drinkability is fine and driven by it's lightness not it's creativeness."
"3.0 D: Beats the pants off a shit macro, but that's about all I can say."
"D: Overall a dry and spicy lager, pretty big on flavor, with a nice toasted malting. Wouldn't consider this a session lager but big on flavor and one of their better beers by far. Worth a try."
"D: Sure it's easy to drink, but there are macro lagers out there that and more delicious than this, and that's saying something. Average at best."
"Drinkability: Fantastic, another fine session beer from Saranac."
"The first time I had this beer I thought it tasted no different than an exaggerated Budweiser. The second time I bought a mixed 12 pack and I had it again, I had a much better feeling about it. This is one thirst quencher, having a great drinkability and mouthfeel. Due to it being a pilsener the appearance and aroma may not be the best, but if I'm thirsty on a hot day I'd reach for this."
"The feel is not watery at all; in fact it' gives the consistency of a slightly creamy ale. It's a very good lager; perfect combo of thirst-quenching but not thin or watery."
"d - very drinkable, easy to sip on, no overpowering flavors, but not tasteless. If I had more than one I'd keep drinking them"
"Golden amber color that pours a decent white head. Just some light lacing. A sweet, malty taste to it. Not the greatest taste or smell to it though. It seemed a bit caramel scotchy and overall a bit weird. I like Saranac's Pale Ale more than this one."
"Drinkability: Not wretched, not great."
"D_Once again there is a certain underlying theme in the Saranac brews, a taste I can't quite put my finger on. This is quite an average lager, one that to me does not really shout German Pils. Still it is drinkable and I could see myself having a couple of these."
"As a side note, this is much more of a light-bodied Amber than a classic German Pilsener..."
"Light and refreshing, but nothing that grabs my attention. Still a good beer on a hot summer night."
"Drinkability here is average. I'd get this in a 6 pack or something but theres better out there."
"This is a decent average beer. Golden color with nice hoppy aroma. It has a decently malty taste, with a strong hop bitter. I am a hop head, but a nice malty lager is appreciated. The mouthfeel is ok, a little on the light side. It is a good beer for a hot day. This is a good run of the mill beer."
"Pours a very light amber/dark gold with very little head and leaves no lacing around the glass. Aroma is weak, found it hard to pick up any flavors at all. Thin mouthfeel that finishes awkwardly. The flavor is the only quality of this beer that I found to be worthwhile. Sweet malts are tucked away and lead into a nice hoppy bitterness. Overall the flavor is just above average in my opinion but is weak compared to other vienna/amber style lagers. This beer needs more body and a richer flavor, all in all I was not impressed."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a really nice looking copper color with a creamy off-white head that does a pretty good job with lacing and retention. The aroma is sweet malt and caramel with some hops. The taste begins with a smooth malty flavor with the hops providing for a mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel has a nice smooth and creamy body that I enjoyed. Overall, Saranac Adirondack Lager is not a bad lager, but nothing that I would purchase again."
"Clear light copper/amber colored with pretty good fluffy whit head. Smell is of slightly taosted/grainy malts and a little grassy/prickly hop as well. Taste is of some sweet malt and a little hop bitterness on the finish. Mouth feel is average, however drinkability is very good."
"pours a light amber color with a white rocky head that fades to lacing rather quickly. has a nice malty aroma with some lager esters. not as much malt on the flavor, and a bit of citrus bitterness at the end. the mouthfeel is decent with a load of carbonation... nice drinkable lager... good for the warm weather."
"D = This has pretty good drinkability. It does not taste great, but is easy drinking and refreshing. Would make a god choice on a hot afternoon when you want something with a mild flavor profile."
"Drinkability: Pretty straightforward and forgettable, but an easy drinker. I'd pick up another variety if I had no idea what I wanted."
"Pours a deep yellow amber color with a nice off white head. The aroma is a bit like biscuit and malt. The flavor isn't impressive--slight German lager yeast taste, but other than that close to nothing. Not as dry as I would expect--residual sweetness is left in the mouth after tasting. Not too hard to drink a few of these, but not pleaseant enough to have a lot."
"Not a bad beer, has a good drinkability, but I'd stick to Saranac's ales."
"My first sip is disappointing. After a review of this site's description of a german pilsener, I can't seem to get a lot of hopiness out of it. But after trying about 1/3 of the glass, some of the hops do now come to my taste buds. But they don't seem to really do much. The beer now tastes pretty good and is refreshing after a hot day. Some of the citrus-like flavors are coming though. I find myself warming up to this beer the more I have it. Not much of an aftertaste. I could have more then one on the patio and with friends. Not bad."
"Decent enough, but I'm an ale man. This has a decent flavor but it just doesn't compare to what else is out there. It's like it wasn't balanced properly and I guess it'll take some getting used to. I'll skip it next time."
"D, notes: Ok drinkability. Needed better hop balance."
"12 oz - Part of a Mixed Sixer/$8.99/Embassy Market"
"Pours a great light amber color with excellent head and nice lacing. It has a very nice clean, crisp scent, very sweet and sugary, with hints of maltiness. Great taste, a very sweet beer going down with a nice spicy hop taste after. Goes down well, if a bit overcarbonated. Excellent stuff."
"Drinkability: Basic but drinkable at best, lackluster and a waste of time at worst. Pass me an Eliot Ness!"
"This beer had a solid showing in all of the categories - lovely amber/golden color, excellent head, carbonated just right. Smell is a blend of hops and malt. Tastes nice with just the right amount of kick from the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and clear with a bit of fizziness. Drinkability, obviously, is excellent. I'd go and buy a sixer of this when I wanted to drink some more."
"Smooth and light bodied with fine carbonation. Excellent drinkability"
"Basically, this is the beer that American macro lagers want to be. It is nice, inoffensive, and easy to drink. Chug even. But there is nothing special about it. Where is the magic? It simply isn't there."
"D - Everything about this brew screams ""drink me!"" but there's something about it that I don't enjoy. Maybe it's the high carbonation or the two dimensional flavor. It's light...but not, it's clean...but somehow not. Something's out of balance with this beer giving it mediocre drinkability at best."
"Adirondack Lager pours a clean and clear amber color with a big foamy head. The big white head leaves delicate lace patters on the glass. In the nose, white bread and lightly toasted malts mix with honey and hops. In the mouth sweet caramel and toasty malts are balanced buy some hop bitterness that leads into a crisp refreshing finish. The carbonation is mellow with a medium body and a smooth mouth feel. This is a very good Vienna style lager and a must have when I go camping in the Adirondacks."
"Is it worth $7.49 a six-pack? Some Saranac beers are, but I'm not sure this one is."
"Over all, pretty much an avarage beer."
"Poured a copper bronze color with amber hues. Nice thick head held up with good lacing. Aroma was a bit weaker but very clean and a little spicy. Taste begins with a sweet caramel maltiness but is soon evened out by the yeasty precense in the body. Hops come out towards the end and provide a slightly spicy and dry finish. Average across the board."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. Pours a golden straw with a big, white head that disappeared into nothingness and left no lacing. The aroma is slightly musty with hints of hops and just a slight buttery aroma. The taste is pretty average. There are slight notes of green apples and just a bit of bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. This is a good lawnmower beer."
"Not much to say about this beer, other than kind of ordinary. Amber color, thick white sticky head. Very little aroma, just a little bit of malt. Same with the taste, just a little bit of malt with the tiniest bit of hops. An inoffensive beer, nothing to write home about."
"D: This is a mixed bag of a beer. It has its good points, but ultimately it's not complex enough in the taste department."
"D: Not my favorite style of beer, but a very drinkable brew. Good sessionable beer without any overwhelming aspects that would leave your tongue fatigued."
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth. Seems well-crafted. Almost average though. Nothing to really make it stand out. Great lawn mower beer though."
"A semi-creamy, pinky finger head that died almost as it was born. Some good carbonation though on top of a mixed dark gold/reddish body and a little bit of lacings. A slightly citric hoppy smell dominates, with faint malts in the background of the beer's aroma. A matly presence is noticeable, something like coffee or toasted, mixed in with the earthy hops. This creates a medium body that has a semi-sweet (there is a tad bit of citrus to taste) taste but a finish that is a little too dry for my liking (no big payoff in the dry backbite). An alright beer and I'd recommend trying it, but not my first choice at all."
"Notes: I find this beer easily and very well priced,but this beer is not true to it's style, yet despite this I find it a good beer to have before I get serious and sip on some world class brew. Very light on hops but well balanced and a beautiful color."
"D - Enjoyable, for it's uniqueness if nothing else. Not a bad brew, and one I wouldn't mind revisiting, worth trying."
"This is a good beer, with some body but definitely drinkable. Love most of the beers in this sample pack any time of year."
"Very pale, transluscent amber with a small white head. Smell is a touch metallic, and lager yeast mostly with a bit of malt. Taste is fairly standard light malt with a pleasant slight touch of tartness and a hint of yeast. Mild to medium bitterness in the finish. Somewhat thin flavored but medium body that is crisp and clean. Not bad at all, but doesn't stand out too much. Still an enjoyable, unoffensive, easy drinking beer. Thanks dave!"
"D - Refreshing, but a little more more hoppy and bitter than I expect from a lager"
"This beer strikes me more as a Vienna Lager than a Pilsner, but whatever. This beer seems to be just about the perfect craft beer gateway brew. It reminds me of Dos Equis with a dash more character. It features some wonderful noble hop character with a very clean finish that makes you want more and more."
"D- I'd select this at a bar on tap against any macro anyday. I often rotate back and forth between this and Sam Adams at bars with moderate selection.... they complement eachother well, and are highly drinkable"
"D: A decent effort, but a little unusual tasting. If I were going for an easy-to-find, mid-priced pack in the grocery store, I would likely lean more towards Sam Adams or Magic Hat. It would be a maybe on getting another one of these, I think."
"Very nice looking amber in color formed a decent white head. Smell very malty not much hops. Taste not bad a little bitterness up front lots of malt a little nutty. Mouthfeel mediem in body and carbonation. Drinkability was ok its not the greatest beer in the world but I could have a few."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This one is medium in the mouth, actually I find it heavier than most other pils. This is an extremely drinkable beer, just about appeals to everyone I should say. Not necessarily one I'd pick up again, but still if I'm in the mood for a German Pils this might be the one I pick up If I can't get my hands on Victory's Prima Pils."
"Overall, there really wasn't much I liked about this one."
"Pours a clear amber. Very small head that quickly leaves. Nose is like a mix of leaves and sugar. In a baked sense I would say. Overall, not much to it. Flavor is almost acidic with it's bitter tone at first. Then it calms and gets into more of a earthy and slightly dirty lager profile. I mean to me there just isn't anything that distinctive about it. Feel is decent. Drinkability is on the same level. It is just a standard old lager really. It has a nice body to it sure, but there just isn't anything exciting about it at all."
"Lingering bitterness might cut down on drinkability, but otherwise a somewhat more interesting lager than the big boys produce."
"This beer poured an amber color with a big fluffy four-finger head. The smell is a pleasant bready maltiness with a hint of floral hops. The taste starts off with some sweet maltiness that is quickly cut by a couple different kinds of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is average with a middling amount of carbonation. I'd consider this to be a very drinkable lager that I could see myself knocking back a couple of."
"Another sample from the sample pack. The appearance was great; murky and golden with a foamy head that thins out slowly. The smell was thin was satisfying to the senses. Hops with balanced malts give it a bitterish aroma. The taste is surprisingly sweet that is wonderfully thin from the mouthfeel. It is definitely a refreshing, smooth taste with great lager balances over all its flavors. This is another great one from Saranac."
"D - I really don't like this. I've also got a bone to pick with the style that this is listed under. German pils? No way. I think that this is more of a Vienna Lager than anything."
"I can see myself picking this one up if I were in the mood. It's a little too malty, but a tasty and cheap craft brew."
"I enjoyed this beer, better than that other Macro lager: Yuengling"
"The beer is the perfect complement to a summer bbq. Despite its light mouthfeel, the beer is surprisingly heavy. One or two compliments a meal nicely."
"This was # 2 from their sampler pack; pours a clear light orange color w/ a light off-white head which dissapates quickly, little lacing; a strong hop aroma w/ slight less malt than boasted; the hop flavor hits you right away, really overpowers the malts; nice med. body, though, with a dextinous finish, not what you'd expect considering the lack of malt flavor, actually needs to be a bit drier for a pils; not an undrinkable, though, i'd drink a few of these during a hockey game or something.."
"Tastes rather simple like the nose. Has a bready malt taste and light citric hop taste. I could enjoy this one after a hike or at camp."
"This poured a Beautiful amber color with abundant lacing, smell is a nice malt and hop aroma, Hops are subtle in the flavor mostly dominated by malty goodness, This beer is incredibly refreshing and drinkable. This is my second from this brewer and so far I'm rather impressed. My next trip down will definitely consist of some of this again."
"The taste mostly consists of a light caramel flavor with only a touch of hop presence. It's pretty much just a dark all-malt lager. Thin bodied with good carbonation. The finish has a candy-like feel."
"Mostly clear, slight chill haze, light coppery amber body topped by a thin cap of light beige foam that fell quickly to a thick ring. Fine lacing showed a little stickage. Fruity aroma, seems to be from the yeast, a little malt sweetness with pleasantly floral hop nose. Low bitterness, fairly fruity with a hint of hop spice in the finish. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, just short of crisp, with a consistent texture throughout. Pretty tasty overall. The flavour in the finish is just a little off though, sort of reminds me of the bitterness you get from a very weak spice tea that's intended for a different beer."
"Pours a nice golden amber with a thick frothy white head. The head dissipates after the first sip. The smell is sweet and malty with some faint hop aroma. This is a very inviting beer. The taste starts sweet with the malty tones with a slightly bitter finish but leaves the sweetness lingering on your tongue. The taste is somewhat subtle, built for the summer, and it is very refreshing. This one is in between a medium and light mouthfeel, leaning more towards light. The carbonation is good, and is a very easy drinker, would match up with just about any food, a great summer lager, but it could be enjoyed any time. This one is worth checking out for the lager fans out there. No surprises here, just a quality lager."
"D- A fine session ale, but not something I'd jump at."
"There is a nice malt flavor on first taste with a bit of caramel-like sweetness to it, but not overly so. There were hints of fruit here as well, although they didnt really dominate in any way but had to be looked for somewhat. This is balanced nicely with the hop flavor, which comes out especially on the finish. Carbonation level is good - not so high that its fizzy and a nice accent to the hop-induced bitterness, especially in the finish. Its definitely a medium-bodied beer, a bit richer in flavor than many of the lighter summer brews."
"D: This beer is refreshing and it has some character. I would definitely drink a few if thats what I have available, but Im not sure that Id buy this by the 6 pack or more, either."
"So this is the second bottle from my mixed saranac pack, well actually the third, but I have had the IPA before so I will not be reviewing it again. I have been having a thing for lagers lately, so I am hoping this one does not let me down. Poured a very nice, crystal clear amber, nice orange hugh for a lager. Two inch white head faded quickly to just that quarter inch layer of film on the top. Very decent lacing for a lager as well was dripping down the sides. I could see some nice visible carbonation streaming up off the bottom of the glass, clarity excellent, overall look, A OK...Smell was lots of bready yeast smells. Lots of grain, kind of a moldy or off earthy aroma, like grass stuck in mud, or bread batter. A slight hint of hoppiness in the back as well. The taste was pretty standard at first, however as it warmed I detected a nice earthy grain mixed with almost a banana tone. A decent dry hoppy finish as wellThe feel was great, light and remarkable smooth. Great carbonation, not slick oily or otherwise detrimental at all. Superb drinkabilty, this is an easy session beer. Has such as nice light profile, yet great taste. Not watered down like some other lagers. Easily a hot weather drinker. Overall I really liked this, and thought it was much better then the pale ale, and would actually order or buy this one again. Looking forward to the next one in the box, the blak and tan!"
"This beer sports a nice amber color while the aroma is malty, a little earthy, but mostly sweet. The taste is all over the place; there's a nice hoppy bitterness, but it just sort of alternates with the sweet malty character, which reminds me of a peach jelly or marmalade. Smooth and refreshing, but a bit unbalanced, though that does nothing to hinder the drinkability of this beer. It's a solid brew, but I have had better."
"D: Pretty tasty with a classic noble hop aroma and flavor that complements a nice bready maltiness. A really good example of the Bohemian Pilsner style. (4.0)"
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer and somewhat confusing. While I can appreciate that it's hard to define stylistically; I don't think it's very strong in any particular direction. That said, I find it interesting and refreshing, but not very special. The Saranac brand has so many other offerings that are much more interesting."
"Drinkability, a not so filling, somewhat tasteful beer. I would have no problem putting a couple of these down, though they would not be my first choice. Overall not a bad beer, just something is a little off, that prevents it from being a good beer."
"D- Not something I would relish sessioning as the taste just wasn't on."
"Drinkability: Well, when it comes down to it, it does matter how good a beer looks or smells if it tastes bad. This one is average in all categories but taste. And tatse kills it. Not for me."
"the rest follows the former, its not bad but not great"
"12 oz. bottle on a lager Friday... tawny to a transparence, pasty headed. Slightly metallic odor. Side tongue and back of mouth experience is souring and leaves me feeling simple. The beer was here and gone, leaving little to report. Bring on the barbeques!"
"It pours a clear light brown with yellowish tones. The thin head dissipates fairly quickly and barely laces. It smells like a rich lager - caramel malts, slight hops, and that weird yeast that I can't get used to. I like lagers that don't have that scent to them, but I know that a lot of the ""better"" German lagers smell like that. Kind of bitter for the style -- balances out the sweet malt. As I said, not my thing, but a decent example of the style. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body, and if this beer appealed to you, I imagine you'd like to drink it all night. I'm glad I had someone to split it with, and I moved onto their Pale Ale."
"what do you think?"
"D: This is one damn drinkable brew; not as complex as many others, but a first rate representation of what the style should be."
"Poured pale amber with a nice white head. Aroma is very faint, mostly malt. Taste is mild and light. Malts and then a little hops on the finish. This stuff reminds me of Yuengling, only better, a little fuller. Easygoing. Nothing earth-shaking, but much better than macro, and reasonably-priced (at least in upstate-NY it is)."
"Poured nicely with good color and head retention- good lacing and a very nice hop aroma. Clean crispness which unfortunately doesnt translate to the taste. Very dry on the tongue, almost grainy with a watery, essence of cardboard flavor. The bitterness of the hops is its only saving grace as the malts are too faint and watered down to compete with the other odd flavors. Light bodied, the usual pleasing malts in amber lagers are missing and replaced with some strange tongue twisting flavors."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear golden amber color with a finger of off white head. Minimal lacing left on the glass. Smells of sweet malt, apples, grapes and a touch of citrus. Tastes of bittersweet, grassy hops with a great malt presence to match. Finish is dry and slightly sour. Medium in both body and carbonation. This is a wonderful session beer and a great deal for a good honest beer."
"I like Saranac's entire catalogue, even their Root Beer. I just couldn't rave about this beer as much as i wanted to. It poured well into a pint glass with a full head, nice and thick. It reduced down to pretty poor lacing after a few sips. the color reminds me of pasturized apple cider, but the taste was anthing but sweet or fruity. The taste was kind of dull although a little bitter. It had plenty of carbonation and floated over my tongue. This beer might have turned, or be on the verge of turning. I'll have to give this one another chance."
"D: It was a little tastier that I thought it would be, goes down easy, not very filling. My expectations of Matt Brewing have been lowered after trying their Pale Ale and IPA, so I thought this beer was going to be terrible. It wasnt anything special by any means, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I found the beer to be pretty decent."
"M&D - too sour and ricey for my palate, i don't care for this very much, i may try this again in the future just to see if this one didnt turn"
"drinkability - I wasn't too fond of the beer, bitterness and malted taste turned me off."
"The drinkability is ok nothing bad just nothing above norm either I would not buy this beer out of a mixed sampler. MK"
"goes down easy and is equally easy to enjoy. not as complex or sublime as some other lagers of this style, but an excellent session brew that doesn't give the palate a workout but doesn't leave it bored either."
"Not bad, but a bit underwhelming for a ""craft"" beer. Don't have much else to say about it."
"D - Not a bad beer. Sessionable, easy drinking. A good choice to break in a macro-drinker maybe."
"Overall an average beer. A good choice to go with a plate of wings. Another slightly above average from a Saranac mixed twelve pack. Nice to try the style from a different brewer, but nothing to run out to find."
"Over this beer is a very drinkable beer. I like it is better than the Yeungling Special Lager and have no problem drnking this in a BMC bar."
"Drinkability--I could have a few of these with no complaints."
"The whole thing, while very drinkable, is rather low-key and nothing sensational. There's just not much to say about this one. I've only had three different Saranac beers so far (this, the Pale Ale, and the India Pale Ale), all decent but none outstanding. I'm hoping one of those more interesting beers in the Winter sampler 12-pack makes me sit up and take serious notice."
"The taste was well-balanced between the malt backbone and floral hops. It wasn't overpowering or interesting, but it wasn't bad either. Average. Mouthfeel was clean and crisp, and the beer is fairly drinkable. I was expecting the worst with this one, and it's not really that bad. Nothing stands out about it either, though."
"Got this one in the 12 beers of Winter sampler. Overall, I've been really impressed with Saranac's offerings, but not this one. I expected this to be their benchmark beer and found it to be the worst of their line. The Adirodack Lager smelled coppery and tasted the same. Too bitter and too much hops for a lager in my opinion."
"Poured a pale amber color with a 2 finger head that dissipates quickly. Doesn't have a pronounced smell, typical Saranac trait, but has a light malt, hoppy smell to it. The hop taste hits right away followed by the caramel malt. No noticable lingering bitterness. Easy to drink, I could have a few of these but would choose not to. There are better offerings for this style. Saranac's offerings seem to be real middle of the road, nothing really stands out."
"Looks fine but then it really goes down from there, with a rough aroma and a rougher taste. Mouthfeel is ok save for the lingering taste. In all not a very drinkable beer when you add it all up. I suppose it gets the job done but not happily. Very likely not my favorite style of beer."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. Nice, light golden color with a thick white head. A subtle, malty smell well balanced by some hops. SAme with the taste: malty with a subtle hoppy after taste that balances off the malt very well. Decent mouthfeel typical of most American Amber Lagers. Very drinkable beer; halfway through it I was looking forward to another one just based on the ease of drinking. Good beer and well worth a look."
"Another Winter pack beer...Pours a light amber color with a moderate head, and some retention and lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Has a malty smell to it with a bit of citrus at the end. Mostly malty with more than just a hint of hops..unusually bitter. Has a slight citrus taste to it as well as a hint of caramel. Feels fairly light in the mouth with a decent amount of carbonation...easy to drink. Overall, a decent beer, but nothing too special..."
"After suffering through the 11 other beers in the Saranac 12 pack, this was a great way to finish. I am usually not a lager fan, and find them quite boring. This one is nicely flavored, full bodied, and fairly interesting. There is a touch of diacetyl, but compared to the rest of the mixed 12, this is a vast improvement."
"This one from Saranac is one of their finest. For the price, you can beat this company. The Adirondack Lager is far and away much superior to their plain Lager. Definitely worth the price of admission."
"all in all pretty good. saranac is kind of a weird brewery for me. very middle of the road. all their beers are excellent crossovers for a macro drinker looking for micros. pours amber red with little head. the nose is nothing to write home about. straight forward hops and malt. taste is smooth and highly drinkable. i think my favorite out of the sampler containing the pale ale and ipa as the other selections."
"D: Yep. Like Yuengling, I could have this a good bit."
"jcdiflorio did you get the 12 beers of winter too? The beer was decent, but not awsome. It poured a nice light amber color, with very little head. There was no retention, an no lace. There wasn't much aftertaste, and the lager taste was decent, but not very great. Don't drink and review."
"A couple of steps above a Macro not quite a Mico,somewhere inbetween. An excellent session beer. A beer for the masses,not offensive, just a bit more."
"A good slightly dark lager. A good ""change of pace"" beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a huge head of off white bubbles. Aroma is grainy with grass overtones. Taste is crisp with the base grain as the predominant flavor. Mild earthy malt. Transitions to hops in the aftertaste. Mild bitterness. Light body. Inoffensive but on the boring side. Not sure why this is in a winter seasonal pack"
"Pours a nice copper with a sizable head. Bright in color and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Smells of caramel and malts. A smooth taste that is smoky and has some character but nothing that wows me. The mouthfeel is balanced and crisp. Would make a nice session lager."
"D-Not bad, for the price,but ive had way better for this style.I dont think I'll be having this lager again."
"Very drinkable. With meals, without meals, I could have a few of these easily. It's a bit hoppy to do too many in-session, I think."
"Hand-carried from New York to Moscow (thanks, Mark!), the beer pours a clear amber orange under a very short-lived off-white one finger head that leaves no lace. There is a nice sweet malt nose with hints of caramel. The mouth is light and fairly prickly. Nice taste here - sweet malt, floral hops, the full package blended smoothly. The aftertaste has a mild spicey bite, with the sweetness accompanying for a long time. Very pleasant."
"Drinkability: You could through these back if wanted too, I'm glad there were only a couple in this mix pack, I won't revisit this one."
"Odd that this is an American Amber / Red Lager, as it's more golden than amber by all means. It pours a distinctly golden color with a fair amount of head. It's got a fair bit of hops on the nose for a lager, and slight touch of pine as noticed by other members though I couldn't immediately place it. The flavor is primarily hops and a fruity malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is average for this variety of beer. It's a very easy beer to drink. Easily consumed en masse, but while it is somewhat distinctive compared to other American Amber lagers, I'm not sure if that makes it necessarily better than the others. It's certainly better than Saranac's traditional Lager though. There may be better alternatives, but this one deserves a recommendation for being pleasant yet distinct."
"Halfway through the glass, despairing of finishing it at all, I discovered that a piece of decent white bread actually does a pretty good job of smoothing it out and absorbing a lot of the overpowering bitterness, but it still doesn't make it worth while."
"D-Goes down nice and easy, and has a nice balance of flavors which makes this easy to drink."
" An enjoyable brew, simple and to the point with no frills."
"D: It's OK. While it's easy to drink a lot of these, I'm glad there are only two in my six-pack."
"Medium body, light-to-moderate carbonation. Balance is pretty good. Overall a pretty mild beer. Not bad, but nothing tremendously compelling. Probably wouldn't be bad as a session beer."
"D - It is an okay brew. I've had better but it is certainly drinkable."
"Had one with dinner. Looked pretty good, clear amber color, nice white head that fades to a covering of the top of the glass. Very little, spotty lacing. The aroma is very faint, some hops but nothing stands out. Taste and mouthfeel were pretty good. Very light taste, nicely balanced between hops and malt, very crisp and easy to drink. No unpleasant aftertaste. I like this as well or better than Kilians. This is not a stand-out style for me, but this beer fits in failrly nicely. Would be an ok session beer"
"d-Somewhat drinkable, but I would probably have to switch after the 2nd one"
"Thanks Len!"
"D: Semi drinkable lager. The bland taste at first doesnt really appeal to me. Although drinkable, Id go with a different lager before this one. Perhaps the temp. at which I had this beer was too high and it should have been coldernot sure that would have made a huge difference however."
"drinkability: easy drinking for sure"
""
"Drinkability: This beer is suitable for someone making a jump from BMC to craft brews. It is solidly made, just a little light in flavor."
"Pretty good for what you'll probably pay for it. Not really my cup of beer flavor wise but this is pretty good at what it is trying to be."
"Amber color- duh. Clear, some head, hints of lacing. Nose is lightly malty and bready, very faint. Taste is, in a word, malty. A bit of a soy sauce thing going on, a fruity thing I'm not really digging. A bit bready. Something about it I just don't like. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, a bit harsh, even. I guess I can see a lot of people liking this, it's not too overpowering and it's light enough, but I just don't dig it."
"d: very easy to drink. a great summer beer as it is refreshing and light."
"It pours a clear copper/amber color, with a 1/4 inch head which goes away very quickly. There's a malty/sweet smell to the beer, but it's not very strong. It tastes malty, with a little caramel taste to it and a slight bit of hops at the end. It's not a strong flavor at all, but still more flavor than pretty much every macro-brewed beer out there. The Adirondack Lager has light/medium body and it is pretty easy to drink, even if it is on the watery side. Not a great beer, but it's something I could have as a session beer now and then. I'll have to try more Saranac beers and see how they compare."
"D- Overall, a good beer that will satisfy the masses. This is ten times better than Yuengling Lager. Living in PA, we tend to get ""Yuenglinged"" to death. This is a nice alternative. Actually served this at a party last weekend to good reviews. Will definately buy again."
"A good hot summer day beer."
"Mouth: It enters with a strong carbonated feeling on the tongue but without a lot of flavor. It hits a gentle sour note on the way back but is most notable in the dry hoppy bitterness that is pleasant but has no depth. Has an alcoholic warmth that surprised me considering there's no sweetness or alcohol in the aroma. Tastes a bit like rice."
"It might be refreshing on a hot day, but there are better examples of this type that would do the same."
"Standard color for an American amber and standard head and lacing. There is a nice hop aroma once poured into a pint glass. The flavor is subtle, like most Saranac beers. In fact, Saranac beers are all good examples of their respective styles."
"The beer poured a medium gold with a small white head the lace held throughout. The aroma was malt and hops. The taste was fairly malty with enough hops to give it a bitter edge. The feel was medium and dry. Not a bad beer, but nothing I would see bringing me back for more. A bit like a standard macro or regional lager."
"To review: Watery, Slightly interesting but not enough for me to come back for more."
"D: All in all, decent for the style. Too bad it doesn't taste better."
"This looks a little like apple juice on the pour, in fact, after the first sip it tastes a little like apple juice too. The smell is uninteresting at best. Appearance is also lackluster. The most complex the flavor gets is slightly more cidery. Some bland malts. This was a part of a mix pack, Im saving the second one for a snakebite. Drinkable but not that desirable. (This is the adirondack not the light too)"
"Man, I'm really gettin' into Saranac brews. Pours out to a dark golden amber color with a 1/8 inch head of foam and residual lacing. Medium level of carbonation. Aroms of fresh malts and grass fill the nose. Some biscuit notes. Taste was medium bodied; flavors of sweet medium malts, wood, bread and some hop bitterness were well balanced. Mouthfeel was decent, not overly carbonated or flat, with a slickness about itself. Very good drinkability. This would make a great brew to keep on hand during the autumn months. Recommended. Thanks goes out to conneticutpoet for providing the sample."
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours a dark honey color. Looks really nice in a tulip with lighter gold around the edges, picking up more and more browns toward the center. The head is frothy white and thin and leaves some fantastic lace. Smells a bit like honey too, with some clover and orange and a slight doughy malt. Tasted foul. Theres a heavy sour corn base that is just destroyed by a huge mechanical aluminum dryness. Starts with caramel corn, then to lemons, then to aluminum. There arent any smooth biscuit lager-like characteristics here at all. The metallic dryness carries long into the finish. Oh wait. Somewhere in the crappy dry finish I managed to pull out something that was reminiscent of a lager. Aha! If I chug this beer, It manages to taste a little more red and the dryness dies down. My problem was that I was trying to enjoy this beer. Silly me. The mouth feel is a bit light, almost dry with a nice fluffy carbonation. Everything was all right with this beer other than the obstructive dryness."
"Worth a try once - I'd prefer Sam Adams or Brooklyn Lager if given a choice. Maybe one of the 11 beers left in my pack will impress me more!"
"Pours out a nice copper color with a thin but sticky white head. Very aromatic fruity hops. A little salty in the smell as well. It tastes better than it smells. A sweet hop with good balance. The hop reminds me of sam adams lager. It has a typical light bodied mouthfeel. Incredibly easy to drink. A great offering for the price. It could have a more interesting/complex taste and that would be my only complaint. But it is good at what it is."
"Mouthfeel is light and slick. Drain ho!"
"Drinkability is good. The smooth feel along with a decent taste makes this a drinkable beer."
"One of the few lagers in the 12 beers of Christmas 12 pack. Pours a clear amber color with minimal head and lacing. Smell is sweet and malty with some herbal hops in the background. Taste is well balanced between the biscuity malts and heral hops. Light enough in body to pound more than one. Similar to Yuengling Traditional Lager, a good, if uninspired lager."
"Drinkability: Highly sessionable. It won't fatigue the palate or the drinker. Nothing too exciting but would make a good ""gateway/crossover"" beer for the non-BA. Worth a try."
"Mouth feel is light bodied and a bit watery."
"D - Good, goes well even with spicy dishes, I had it with kim chi ji gae (after I figured out the flavor and smell of course) and it was a wonderful match. Would not go well with sweeter foods at all though."
"Drinkability: This has been the best beer in the box. I wish I had another."
"Taste = Another below average tasting Saranac beer. This one, like so many others, simply lacks in the flavor department. There's nothing repulsive about it, there's just nothing great here. Everything feels toned down. It's crisp and refreshing though and would go well on a hot day."
"Poured a deep clear amber with a quickly fading white head that left no lacing at all. The aroma was mostly sweet grain with a fairly subdued earthy hop smell. The taste was much the same being dominated by bready grain with a mild hop kick at the end. Decent carbonation and solid body, but otherwise a fairly bland brew that I won't be getting again. It is fairly refreshing at least."
"pretty good drinkability, but that bite at the end could take it's toll after a couple. a pretty typical amber lager type beer. nothing special that i would ever seek out though."
"This is a really good red beer. The color of this beer is reddish amber. It is a lot lighter than other red beers. The smell is hoppy for the style. The taste reminds me of an IPA. Is this a red IPA? Is there such a thing? The mouthfeel is very good as well. Fair bitterness. A small bit of twangy aftertaste. The drinkability would certainly be more than the two I got as part of a sampler. If this beer was set in front of me unlabled, I would have mistaked it for an IPA. Not an over the top, hopped up IPA. This is a good beer that I will seek out in the future."
"All and all a pretty good red beer. I've had better and I've had alot worse. Well worth a try."
"I pulled the Adirondack Lager from the Saranac 12 Beers of Winter variety pack, which has yielded some pleasant surprises so far. This lager pours a pale golden color with perfect clarity. A medium white head forms and leaves lacing after disappearing. The aroma is very understated, dominated by a maltiness. The taste is like the aroma, dominated by the malts. It's fairly sweet but not cloyingly so. A hint of hops come in to cut the sweetness a bit. This is an easy drinking lager not designed for serious contemplation. I would have enjoyed it a bit more if it was a bit less sweet and the hoppiness was just a bit stronger. Still, this isn't a bad beer by any stretch."
"Great session beer."
"This beer lacks a real definable character and is just a beer is a mass of beers. No flavors pull through or stick out, but everything is balanced well too. An okay beer, good enough at the time, but I probably won'y seek it out intentionally."
"Easy drinking and tasty. Not great, but the price is right for an amber lager. Pick one up for $5/sixer if you can."
"The flavor starts with a sweet roasted maltyness which is very smooth. It then moves to a bold hoppy finish. Quite a nice complex flavor."
"Overall, a better than average lager - better than typical macro swill, but not really worth seeking out on its own."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle from Saranac's 12 Beers of Winter (or Christmas). Like the bottle said, the beer poured a nice golden amber color, but didn't have much of a head (granted I don't pour as aggressively as others do). What constituted as a head didn't stick around very long either. No signs of lacing. Floral character in the aroma from the hops but sort of mixed up, can't distinguish any particular smell that dominates. A relatively good balance between the bitterness of the hops present and some roasted malts for sweetness, but it does come across as a hodgepodge of flavors that hasn't quite blended well yet. Rather crisp from the carbonation too. Aside from all of this, it is a drinkable beer, slightly above average in my opinion."
"I rather enjoyed this one. It's appearance was nothing to get excited about, especially with the head flattening out real quick. The smell was interesting, with a sort of malt liquoresque vibe going on, just less of the alcoholiness. Had kind of a hop spike to the smell too. The taste had a kind of mellow hoppiness to it, with a maltiness infused, as well as a light fruitiness. No real aftertaste to speak of, which can be a good thing for a beer this light. Overall, it was a easily drinkable beer. This is something that would go well with pretty much any type of food. It could definately be a ""football"" beer."
"Honey color,and not much of a head. Smell was not great.No hint of nut. Kind of skunky in fact. Taste was sour.. It was on the light side. Finish was a bit skunky . I expected better. I would not recommend this beer. Don't go out of your way to buy this beer!"
"Brew has a nice dull brass color with a great, 2 inch off white head that has very good retention and leaves a bunch of lacing down the sides of the brew. The aromas a grainy with a slight toasted characteristic, a pleasant smelling brew. The taste is very smooth, has a toasted like flavor along with just the right amount of bitterness at the end. The bitterness is very subtle but really seems to balance out this brew quite efficiently. If youre looking for something exotic in a brew, this is not it but IMO this is a very easy brew to drink in larger amounts because it is cheap (here in New York) and just has a solid taste to it. I would recommend it to anyone that is trying to bridge the gap from mass marketed macro brews. Very good offering from Matts (Saranac)."
"This is a pretty dark lager.It's honey colored,but the head is small and disappears fast.This smells a little hoppy,with some fruitiness and yeast.This isn't a bad tasting lager.It's hoppier than most with a hint of cooked veggies or fruit.The big problem with this beer is the weak head and the poor m/f.This is very weak and watery, which leads me to say I don't think I'd buy this again."
"A pretty simple brew, sampled froma 12 pack variety. Looks...well...amber, with moderate carbonation and an impressive foamstand that faded quickly. No lacing. Caramel and tea like in the aroma. Light barley grain aroma with slight hop character. Mildly toast-ey in the aroma and flavor. Tastes sweetly of barley malt with caramel notes and again, tea. Body is moderate to light, and finishes a bit sweet with a slight hop and yeast bite. A bit grainy in the aftertaste. Overall, average. I'll try again, but won't seek it out specifically."
"Nice bitter hoppy bite with a kick of roasted malt and a smooth aftertaste and clean finish. This is a highly drinkable beer that still brings a good deal of flavor to the table. A pleasant surprise at a reasonable price."
"Overall: This is a nice lager to have one or two of with dinner."
"Must be a new offering from Saranac in the Trail Mix,pours a nice rich bronze with a tight one finger head on top leaving a trace amount of lace behind as it settles.Sweet caramel and toasted grain dominate the aroma not much hop wise going on,mild but pleasant flavors lightle sweet caramel over toasted malt with a touch of herbal hop in the finish.A no frills amber lager here light but flavorful nothing bad really to say about this and its quite cheap."
"I've been drinking this beer for a while, It's actually one of the beers that got me away from the standard American macro taste (which may make me a little bit partial), and I really enjoy it. It's nothing special, but it's a good beer and worth the 5 or 6 bucks a six pack. It's actually pretty flavorful, reminds me a little bit of the Otter Creek Vermont Lager. It pours a nice amber color and is medium bodied. This and SA Boston Lager are the two lagers I buy most frequently. It's worth a shot, has a decent amount of flavor for the money."
"Drinkability: Pretty refreshing. I know there are better ones out there, and this is from the mixed 6-pack, so I have another left right now. I could make this a session for sure I'd say, and I'm sure some people do (as Saranac's beers are very cheap, and the taste certainly outweighs the price also, in my opinion)."
"Boy a solidly good amber lager. Not that adventurous but really nails the style. A big step above other Saranac offerings -- I'm not sure that an amber/red lager could get much better than this (taste-wise)."
"Bottle: Poured a light amber color looking lager with a quite large foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of strong malt and crisp hops is really enjoyable and doesnt reek of adjunct. Taste is clearly refreshing while still keeping a strong presence of malt and lightly bitter hops. Very good for a style that is not properly exploited in my surrounding."
"Pours a clear red/amber color. Two fingers of creamy head retain well and lace nicely. Smell is faint, toasted malts and vague hops. The taste is sweet, like crystal malt with hints of grain. Hop presence is balanced with some noble hop bittnerness in the aftertaste. Light Bodied and low carbonated. Good, but not outstanding in any way. A smooth finishing caramel lager with ample hops."
"purchased as part of sampler pack. Poured a clear copper color with large off-white puffy head. Smells is mildly hoppy with a distinct toasted, caramel note. Taste is modereately of caramel with a roasted malt background. Mouthfeel if refreshing. Good drinking beer."
"This beer poured a copper bronze color with amber hues. Nice thick head held up with good lacing. Aroma was a bit weaker but very clean and a little spicy. Taste begins with a sweet caramel maltiness but is soon evened out by the yeasty precense in the body. Hops come out towards the end and provide a slightly spicy and dry finish. Crisp, clean, well made. Easy to drink."
"Overall, this one isn't too good. One is enough for me. Thin, frail, and boring. Comparable to an average macro."
"A very enjoyable beer on a sunny afternoon."
"Pours a medium amber with a 1 finger head, that had OK longevity and pretty good lace. Aromas of a mild caramel malt with some very slight vanilla and raisin smells as well. Some noticeable hop presence. Stronger hop flavors than I anticipated and some caramel malt flavors as well but the hops are too sharp and strong for this brew. Could be balanced better. Fairly high carbonation and dry. Not a bad beer and still drinkable but the hop presence in this one is just too sharp to be even an average beer."
"Pours a clear golden amber with just a thin cap of head that sticks around throughout. Nose is slight and is of bready malts. Taste is bready maltiness upfront with a slight grassy hops presense in the back. Aftertaste is slightly metallic and not enjoyable. Mouthfeel is a little slin and watery, but the carbonation is at least at a good level. Overall this is an simple average beer that might appeal to macro drinkers."
"Nice, especially when you get it on sale. It isn't top notch but it is a nice drink. The appearance is nice; amber gold with a light tan head. The smell is pleasant with some hoppiness to it.The taste is adirondacky. That made no sense but it is. Some malts some hops. You could drain these all day but not feel liek a cheap beer whore because it is good."
"A great staple beer. Even non-beer drinkers may find this one pretty good. Pours a rich, sparkling amber in color. Finger deep, spongey head on top. The nose is very slight malts. The flavor is not particularly complex, which is why I think non-beer drinkers would like this one. The malts are pretty straightforward and balanced nicely with the hops. There are strong apple tones in the flavor. Little bit of spice... maybe cinnamon. Mouthfeel is full of flavor and nicely rounded. Very smooth and drinkable."
"This is a good everyday beer, not complex but satisfying if you don't overanalyze it. If only Saranac can make their beers taste as good as they can make them appear..."
"Good lacing. I may be getting some band-aid smell now, not sure. I feel it's okay, a step above mediocre."
"This is a little beer. Pours amber with a little head. Smells a little hoppy. Tastes an equally little amount malty and hoppy. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth actually, but maybe a little too smooth. I probably could drink a lot of these, but I don't really want to... only a little bit. Lacks character. Decent cheap fallback beer or a beer for introducinig people to better beer. Little..."
"Drinkability: Good, a little lacking in depth and balance, but a highly sessionable beer that gets better as you go."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a clear orange-amber color with a lacy white head. Smells fairly hoppy, with some sweet caramel like malt. Malty taste with a silky meduim body. Some citrusy hops hit the tounge and make for a clean fnish. Very thirsty quenching. All around a good amder lager. Tasty, I must say."
"Pours a very light-colored amber in color. Clear, with a scant whitish-colored head. Minimal retention and lacing. Aromas are more hop-influenced than I expected, with a grassy presence mixed with some sweetness from the malt. Flavor is quite light, sorta reminds me of a mild almost. Nothing too busy. Finish is crisp and short-lived. On the borderline of being thin in mouthfeel, it's still drinkable."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability/comments: Again, if one were to isolate the baseline for Saranac beers, this one would be closest to it. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that, as this is actually a pretty tasty beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: I'm kicking myself for picking up a case of different Saranac beers. One by one they're getting worse. I hope none of them fall below this, 'cause this is just gross."
"This beer has a clear amber color. The head is large when first poured, but doesn't stick around long. There is almost no smell, just a lit malty sweetness. The flavor follows from the smell. Not at all hoppy. This beer is all around average, or maybe slightly below. It is drinkable, but that is just because the flavors are so light. In fact, this beer reminds me of a light beer."
"better than the dos equis i had with my mexican dinner last night, but not by a huge margin"
"Pours medium copper, very translucent. One finger head that quickly dissipates, not a lot of carbonation, but enough to get you through without making you burp between drinks. Smells of mild wheat and hops. Taste follows with wheat, some light hops, and a hint of fruity sweetness. Mouthfeel is decent, good enough for this light brew. Overall, pretty decent beer."
"I can't really get into this. Once again, this Saranac beer tastes too watery. Not very well balanced."
"And with this being my farewell tour to an old tradition from the early days of my beer explorations, I say goodbye to the Saranac 12 Beers holiday pack. I will never purchase you again."
"Pours out to a hazy amber, forming a thick, large bubbled light-beige head with good retention and average lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is fruity with some caramel sweetness, Hop smell is mild, overpowered the strong malt/caramel. Very carbonated . Taste starts out with very mild flavor hops, followed by lots malty caramel, some moderate bitterness. A decent balance has been achieved, though like most of the Saranac line somewhat thin bodied."
"An average amber lager that has a lot of disarray going on, never seeming to meld into a cohesive whole. One of Saranac's better brews which doesn't really say much. Their yeast strain is just too funky for me, and it doesn't suit they styles they are going for."
"Mouthfeel was fairly pleasant, with many taste-buds working (albeit not very hard) to sample the brew. Beer is very easy to drink, and is fairly pleasant to do so. This would be a perfect beer to have at a ballpark or on the back deck on a late spring or early fall day."
"A 'good' beer that's obviously pretty drinkable. Nothing to write home about, but in terms of flavor there's nothing unpleasant about this one either."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head above the amber brew. Head shows some staying power, and lacing is average, maybe a bit better. Aroma is lightly malty, with some balancing hops. Taste is similar to the nose, but with some citrus coming out, and the hops asserting themselves with a bit more bitterness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are reasonably good. Is a nice fallback choice when I'm up at the in-laws in the beer wasteland that is northern, northern NY."
"Clark's Ale House in Syracuse on tap #5 unless I lost count. some hops, watery. Sweet, some toasted malt, creamy head, well carbonated. Amber colour, sweet overall with crisp dry finish. Very mild and Bland and unoffensive. Not missing anything here."
" Over-all, not bad, id have another and most likely buy again."
"Not a bad beer, a little better than average. An OK session beer. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but not too bad."
"A little different than a typical Amber, I think. Good flavor, just a bit different than most of the Ambers out there."
"Overall-a fine flavorful amber lager, I've noticed that it has many redeeming characteristics, you could do much worse. The only problem you may find is that there is too much going on, so I would try it out and see what you think. I was impressed though."
"On the other hand, I can't find any flaws besides the above, so I can't quite say this is a below average beer."
"Enjoyed this beer after buying the Trail Mix six pack with 4 types of Saranac (why don't more breweries sell 6 packs this way?). Nice color and drinkability, could enjoy this beer all evening. No bad qualities to note. Very smooth amber that I would recommend to others enjoying amber beers."
"This is a great local brew. A good pouring lager with a taste of its own. It has the characteristic of any main stream brews with alot more flavor and character. A great beer for any time. Give it a try at $18. bucks a case in PA. You really can't beat the taste for the price."
"Pours a clear orange-golden color with a very small head and very little carbonation. Faint aroma of sweet biscuit and a hint of orange. Slightly foamy mouthfeel holds a palate of light citrus, toasted malt, and a touch of hops. Taste becomes a bit astringent towards the back of the mouth. I'm not a huge fan, but it's a serviceable beer."
"Taste, too, is lightly sour--yet flavorful--malted grains. Not too interesting, light candy notes in the mouth. Hops take a backseat here, as they should. Touches of ethanol notes."
"Pours with a off-white three-fingered head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Starts hoppy and sweet, finishes with a good mix of hops and malt, leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. $1.55 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Nice light drinkable brew, nothing great about it but it is refreshing."
"pours a relatively thin looking, crisp amber colour. looks a tad watery if you ask me. pretty average. the head was fairly thin as well and is short lived. the smell here is average at best as well. too malty for my liking. combine that with a rubber tire smell for a blah experience overall. the taste reminds me moreso of a killians. it's a watered down version of a real amber. water and malt dominate, with that rubber tire returning again in the taste, this time in the finish. there is nothing speicla about this brew. very bland. very boring. it's drinkable, but very basic and far from outstanding. i don't believe i'm saying this, but i think i'd actually prefer a killian's to this one."
"Aroma is typical of the style, mildly spicy, clove-like. Taste is good with a moderate amount of hops and nice carbonation, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste. Finishes strong, easy to drink. Overall, a good brew, but again, not that special."
"This is a suprisingly descent amber lager. It pours a very nice intermediate amber depth of color. A nice white foamy head arises but unfortunately does not last very long. The taste has a nice hoppy bitterness, there is not much on the malty side. Not a bad beer. When options are limited and this is an option, give it a try."
"Drinkability - reasonable session beer. Don't know if I'd seek it out, but I'm glad to have tried it."
"So far, all Saranac beers have tasted very similar, and this one is no different."
"Golden colored with a below average head and almost no retention. Smelled fresh and crisp, a little fruity. The taste is pretty good, somewhat fruity and tastes a little bit like cherries. It left my mouth a little dry. A decent beer, but there's better beers for this style."
"Saranac Adirondack Lager is average beer in the end. Perhaps a little above average since I'm feeling generous, but I won't be buying it again."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness dating. Nothing too exciting going on. Light amber, white head, leaving a small bit of lacing. Simple amber lager, mildly malted, very little hops. Seems watered down as do most of this line of brews. Price is right, but I guess, you get what you pay for. This is a drinkable quafer, better then the larger macros. A decent starter beer for a newbie. Pretty tame for a BA."
"Char"
"Definitely a step up from your average macro, but not quite there for one with a more refined palate. Decent, but plain and forgettable."
"Deep copper color with a huge white head. Taste is sweet and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nice hops finish, but still lacking in flavor, could use more hops, but I say that about nearly everything. The best of the 3 Saranac's I have tried from the sampler pack."
"Frankly, a little disappointing, particularly from Saranac. I'll finish this one, but won't necessarily seek another."
"This is a highly drinkable beer with enough flavor to please, but not too strong. A good choice to help bring macro drinkers away from the dark side."
"This is a decent amber lager. Nothing special. Not much head or lacing. I would say that it is drinkable. There doesn't seem to be too much of a hop profile. Very malty for a lager. Almost reminds me more of an amber ale. The taste seems to have a lot of caramel in it. The beer itself seems to dry my mouth. As far as drinkability, it is okay."
"The label asked me to ""look for golden amber color and medium body."" I certainly found the golden amber that was topped off with a modest white head that left a thin layer of foam along the side of the glass. I got mostly a tart citrus aroma, distinctly lemon and soy. The mouthfeel was thinner than medium, and the carbonation was more understated than I found in the Saranac Pale Ale and their IPA. The first taste is sharp, but it mutes quickly and does not linger with any complexity, maybe a suggestion of bread at the very finish. An okay session brew I'd say."
"Tastes pretty good, very hoppy and not to strong, This is a good warm-weather type of beer. Nice and easy to drink."
"This one poured an amber color (duh) with a white head and no lacing. Very clean. The aroma wasn't very strong, but there was some sweet malt in there. The flavor was mostly comprised of the sweet malt - some hops as well. Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"Cuts through spicy food well, medium to light bodied. Not great, but it goes down easily. A little ""unfinished"" the flavors and aroma need to be sorted out and tweaked."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, I could see myself enjoying this on a fall or spring day if offered - but I wouldn't actively seek this out."
"This Adirondack Amber is too plain. I could drink dozens of these there is just little to no flavor! Could use this for a good game of Beirut (beer pong)"
"Another bottle out of the 12 beer holiday sampler. Pours an attractive golden amber, medium head which disappears in a flash, and minimal lacing down the pint glass. Label says Cascade and Hallertaur hops are present, but not much of anything is noticed on the nose, except for slight hop notes. Mouthfeel is decent with adequate carbonation, and nicely balanced hops and malt interaction. This is a medium bodied lager that is well balanced overall with light malt touches. Nothing exceptional, but I wouldn't have to be arm twisted to have another."
"Brilliantly clear auric hue, with a thick, steadfast, dense cream white head supported by lively bubbling. Belgian lace remains. Soft caramel and husky grain upfront in aroma are contrasted by a gentle floral hop nose. Herbal Hallertauer hints surface as the brew breathes. Clean and tame aromawise. Flavorwise it exhibits a stately biscuit sweetness, which is partially offset by balmy hop bitterness. Hop flavor is far more herbal and chlorophyll like that the aroma implied. Hersbrucker? Agreeably understated in caramel malt character, with only subtle light toffee tones. Citrusy hints surface as it warms, but are overshadowed by the noble hop flavor. After the initial prickly carbonic acid bite diminishes, the mouthfeel is revealed to be mildly dextrinous and passably viscous. Finishes bittersweet, with floral, rose like hints balanced with a continuation of light caramel. A surprisingly balanced and enjoyable beer from an overall lackluster brewery. Sufficient in malt and hop depth to keep the palate interested. Tasty, but not outstanding."
"Drinkability: A decent beer, but not all that impressive. Worth trying once, but won't try again."
"poured with a decent white head and a very clear light amber color. nice aroma of cascades with a ligt toffeeish sweet background. fairly good body...has a slight thickness too it but not chewy. hops are really nicely balanced, very easy to drink. very good beer"
"This was clearly a better beer than many other ambers. A coppery amber color with little head to speak of. A flowery smell and a slightly hoppy taste. Well balanced. Just the right amount of malt. I enjoyed this quite a bit. Much better than their IPA.."
"Poured a dirty white head with no staying power. The beer is clear amber in color with a slight orange hue. The aroma is of grassy hop hops. The flavor is hoppy sweet, and balanced by a bit of barley. It's a pretty good tasting, easy drinking lager. Skip the traditional lager and head straight to the Adirondack Amber."
"Certainly less assertive than Boston Lager, but almost as drinkable. This matches up with the Yuengling lager pretty well too. An overall easy drinking beer."
"A nice orange / copper colored amber filled my pint glass with a decent head. The smell was slightly floral, with some sweetness of the malt. The flavor was mellow, only some slight bitterness with a somewhat fruity flavor. It was partially dry on the tongue and there was a small tinge of metallic residue in the aftertaste. Some lacing was produced on the glass and the carbonation level was fine."
"I was very surprised by this beer. It sort of reminded me of Sam Adams Lager toned down a bit with a touch of cascade hops. A great session beer."
"Clear medium amber color, small white head that quickly recedes and leaves no lace. Aroma is some caramel, backed with a solid earthy hoppiness. Flavor has a good caramel malty start, switching over midway to a nice and tasty hoppy ending. Medium body, clean and balanced flavor."
"Pretty easy summer sipper. My friend and I shared a six pack on my porch last night and couldn't have been happier. Poured a deep golden color with a white head that receded into a decent ring around the edge and had some nice lacing. Smell was a tad indistinct, but there was some floral notes pushing through with a wheaty malt. Taste was more floral with the added sensation of raspberry not too much in the way of a hop bite. Carbonation was medium with some nice spritziness. Very easy drinker and saranac is always a good cheap alternative when you can't make it to the beer store or are low on cash."
"This is a very refreshing and nice example of a Vienna lager from Saranac. Nice hop/malt balance, with a pleasant mouthfeel (i.e. not overly carbonated). This would make a great session beer, and it is widely available as well. I was impressed by the smoothness and the subtle hop bitterness. Overall, a great summertime brew to pound away!"
"I thought this was a good beer. It didn't have anything about it that made it stand out and above other beers in this category. It had a nice fruity and bitter hop flavor. It wasn't over-powering like some other beers like this I have had. It wqas very nice. I would probably buy a six pack of this."
"Adirondack Amber has a nice coppertone appearance with a medium-sized (short-lived) head. Aroma is okay, with faint hints of caramel. Taste is better than average, as far as Amber Ales go with a nice balance of malts and hops. Mouthfeel is smooth -- nothing to shout about. And the drinkability is good. This is a great brew to drink around a barbecue pit. It's also a decent introduction to better crafted beers."
"Light amber in color, some malty, wheaty notes on the aroma, decent head and some light lacing. Malt dominated, underlying sweetness, dry hops detected, nice toasty and wheaty taste throughout. Medium bodied, quite tasty and enjoyable, one of the Matt Brew Co's best offerings."
"I like this one. It's a good American Amber, a very drinkable session."
"Took awhile to figure out if this was a lager or ale. It's fairly well hidden information. Aroma starts off with a blast of malt, then moves to the classic shot of citrus from the Cascade hops. The aroma eventually settles to a really pleasant mix of malt and hops simultaneously, but is just too light. Head is smallish and leaves very quickly, leaving only a ring around the edge. Clear and amber, as I guess the name would imply. Pretty nice mix of malt and hops with heavier emphasis on the hops. Just lacking in intensity for my tastes. Slight citrus with some bitterness, neither is excessive and there is a decent malt backing. When colder it seems the malt could be stronger, but that seems less so as warms. Feel has strong presence of carbonation, with a thin body. Seems lager like. Some softenss and fluffiness too. This is okay, a little thin (almost watery like), lacking depth of character and boldness. Just not satisfying in the end."
"I suppose you could drink a bunch, yeah, yeah, yeah, but why? Where's the fun?"
"The beer pours a dark golden/ amber color. It creates a frothy white head that fades to a thin lace. The aroma is of American 2-row barley. The taste is bitter with a malty undertone. The Cascade hops used make it a bit to bitter for me, especially without enough flavor hopping. The Hallertauer hops alow only a faint hint of hop aroma. The body is low to med. making it a very drinkable beer, but not one of my favorites for sure."
"Enjoyed this one. Certainly worth a 6 pack purchase"
"Definitely the best of the Saranacs I've had."
"My second good experience with a Saranac offering. This beer has a good looking clear reddish amber body with 2 fingers of golden, light tan head. The head dissipated a bit too quickly but left plenty of sticky lace behind. Malty nose with slight hop notes. Plenty of grainy, bready malt in the taste with bittery hops hanging around every nook and cranny. This is a crazy, mixed up kid of an amber with no coherent message in the flavor. Good, but confusing to the palate. Slightly creamy body with a crispness that seems forced. Could use some refinement."
"Pours out an amber color as implied by the name. Bit of a fluffy white head that went away after a bit. Good lacing though. Tough to put my finger (tounge?) on the taste. Nothing stands out on its own. Its a pretty sweet tasting beer. This probably isnt one that i would seek out, nothing horrible though."
"Transparent and light colored, more orange than amber, this beer had a frothy head with lots of big lager carbonation and a decent stringy lace. Nose was a quiet fruit with a firm malt background. Taste was a nice balance of malt and hops, with quiet fruit hints; in time it built to a light nut taste, too. IMO, the bitterness could be better tasting and tempered. Long dry finish, and the mouthfeel was more watery than anything else. Very simple and light, and easy to drink. Good for a cheap summer beer."
"Nice amber color with a white head. The head leaves fast and there was little lace present. The aroma was sweet malt, caramel. The taste match the aroma but had a slightly bitter finish. I guess there are thecascade and hallertauer hops are hanging out. A bit above average brew."
"Sweet malts and bready yeasts fight for my attention, and the hops take a back seat until the finish. Nothing spectacular here, but an easy drinker and a great $/beer ratio."
"A clear amber body lies beneath a sturdy head of creamy off-white froth. It's retention is good and it maintains a thin surface covering throughout most of the pint. Nice lacing adds to the appearance. The F.X. Matt yeast lends a gentle touch of fruit to some light malt and background hops. It's medium body combines with a fine, median carbonation that's just lightly crisp on the tongue. It's smooth, but also a bit lifeless. A light citrus hop flavor melds with a gently caramel malt and well-balanced bitterness. Some fruity notes make a minor appearance. It finishes short and dry. It's not a complex beer by any stretch, but it is an enjoyable beer with enough character to keep it interesting beyond one."
"A very drinkable and good session beer."
"This is a drinkable beer enjoyable, worth another quaff."
"Label states: ""Two row malt"" & ""American Cascade and German Hallertauer hops"""
"Orange-gold body, topped by a large shaving-cream-like white head. Good lacing. Strong biscuit aroma. Taste starts with a bit of caramellymalt and finishes with a subtle splash of hops, which do linger a little. Slight soapy note. No real strong notes, a beer designed to be an easy drinking lager, and it fills that bill fine."
"Golden Amber in appearance, this beer has a quickly dissipating head that is artificially carbonated. I am getting a nice undertone of a hop aroma along with sweetness in the sniff I took. The overall taste is a bit unbalanced between the bittering Hops and the caramel and two row malt sweetness. The hop profile within the flavor saves this beer and gives it a little needed complexity. I like the aftertaste this beer leaves on my tongue, but the inital tast isn' t as pleasant to me as I was hoping. When it comes down to it this beer is not a winner in my book, and it doesn't even work as session brew for my tastebuds. Mediocre and better than a macro, but the flavors are all toned down in order to work as a cross over from flavorless to flavorful. I would put this beer in between those two. Don't plan on having another glad there was only one in the sampler."
"Nice malty carmel aroma light amber in color with a nice white head that left a fair amount of lace.Taste wise was kind of oily malt taste with not much hops. I agree with some other reviews that something is missing from this brew. Overall a decent beer that's easy to drink."
"Of the Saranac line SO far this is the better one. I can't wait to try some of the other selections."
"It doesn't quite have the refinement and balance of other amber lagers but it tasted pretty good to me."
"Not very impressed, pours a light penny copper color with a white head that leaves rather quickly, leaving a lace behind. The smell of nothing doesnot fill any part of nose. I am very surprised at this beer I like most of the Saranac stuff. Oh well I guess I will leave it for my wife."
"Pours a pleasant amber with a foamy head. The head stays around for more than a few drinks that adds a hoppy aroma. Nothing extraordinary about any particular area, its just an average beer. The taste is pleasing and does not leave an unpleasant after taste. Its a descent addition to the variety pack and would be welcome to any gathering. I wouldnt go out of my way to buy it, but wouldnt pass it up either."
"A slight harsh hoppy aroma and flavor at first, but then the maltiness comes in and evens things out. Not great but not bad. Will drink again if i am given some, but I would not go out and search for it."
"Pours a nice amber red hue, malty flavor, really nice medium bodied beer, not really much bitterness or hoppiness. Just a smooth moderately malty beer. Would make a good session beer, Beer # 8 of the 12 pack sampler gets a thumbs up fom me."
"This beer pours a sparkling clear copper color with amber highlights. I sports a decent whitish head that slowly recedes into a layer of foamy film. It leaves a respectable lacing behind. Perhaps there is a strong malt backgorund in this beer? Hmmmm, let's find out. The aroma is very much malt, bringing hints of some of my favorite bourbons to mind. Maybe a hint of hops in there as well. Nothing really spectacular. The first sip reveals a prominent sweetness up front with some decent bitterness in the finish. There is a grassy note to the finish and aftertatse. After a few more tastes, a bit more of the herbal taste comes thorugh, along with some citrus hop flavors. Tastes like the brewers used some Cascade hops in this one as well. (Should have read the bottle more closely.) The mouthfeel is average, but matches the flavor profile well. Not quite the malty flavor and body that I was hoping for after seeing the residual foam on the beer. Overall this is another decent beer from Saranac."
"The Adirondack Amber poured an attractive color true to its name. A very thin head was well-retained throughout the tasting. The smell was of a sweet, strong maltiness with only the slightest hint of hops. This strong malt presence was reiterated in the taste, but the the hops asserted themselves a little more here. A good, fairly well-balanced taste was perceived. It went away a little too quickly at first, but stuck around later on in the tasting. I liked the taste, but expected a little more...maybe it was the hint of pure Adirondack water on the label. The Amber has a nice mouthfeel to it, with a medium body and pleasing efferevescence. Overall, the Adirondack Amber lager was drinkable, and I wouldn't be disappointed if this beer was slated for a session."
"Not bad but not great middle of the line!"
"cheers!"
"Drinkability & Notes: Not bad but this is no Sam Adams Lager! Many breweries take on the amber lager and come up with a less then par take on what should be a clean flavourful lager. This is does have flavour, just not in the right places … sort of a jumbled mess that is hard for the taste buds to decipher."
"Not an amber that makes you want to jump up and down, but overall pretty pleasant. A little raw in the hops department up front, but the malt rolls in to take charge. A touch of tin in the finish, but not enough to throw it off."
"The weakness to me lies in the drinkability of this product, it feels a tad heavy. However, it could be an aquired taste."
"Why not, it's got a nice lable."
"cheers!"
"A prototype amber beer.  Nothing really stands out, no mistakes either"
"Very malty and mellow, a great cigar beer. Nothing too complex going on here, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Amber color (duh) with a medium creamy head and sweet aroma."
"Another winner from Saranac. This may be their best all-around beer. It's the malts, they're terrific and distinctive in every beer they brew. Matt Brewers expertly straddle the divide between old-time classic American lagers and the recent microbrew explosion. This example is such a well rounded beer that it is suitable for almost anything. Heftier than a golden lager, piney hops that make it refreshing, sweet caramel malts to deepen the flavor... it's all good, and I like it."
"Not bad at all."
"This brew drinks rich, smooth and flavourful.  No stiking or strong senses, just solid, tastey balance. One on Saranac's best.  Cheers!"
"smooth and refreshing. this beer was a bit lighter than i had expected, but it had just enough flavor for me to have a few more. i wouldn't call it complex, but it was not your ordinary beer."
"206"
"Not bad.  Nice golden color is typical of ambers.  Pleasant hop and two row malt flavor make this brew very refreshing and quite drinkable."
"Thin white head, quickly disappears.  Hoppy aroma and dark straw-color.  Nice balance between initial sweetness and bitter finish.  This beer offers nothing spectacular, but was enjoyable nonetheless."
"More gold in color than a traditional amber.  Fluffy white head.  Slight Malt nose with a hint of metalic odor.  Musty malt taste with a slightly bitter finish.  Smooth feel with good body to the brew, but the taste is slightly skunky/musty. Not one of the best amber beers I have had.  If you are going to have a saranac have a pils."
"Possibly my favorite in the Saranac line-up. Honey colored, with a slight chill haze. Rocky off-white head, dissipates to swirls of lacy thin bubbles. Clean, slightly malty aroma, balanced with some tangy hop fragrance. Taste is nicely balanced, with an initial hop bitterness that hits your tongue, then gives to a smooth, clean, malty finish. Some fruitiness in there as well. Nicely done."
"Not a bad looking amber, but very simple.  I like a little more body to my ambers.  This beer has a pretty smooth finish and isn't at all offensive to the taste buds."
"This is a beautiful looking beer-a very nice copper color. Not all that much flavor, which is possibly why it is so easy to drink. A good amber."
"Very clear light amber with a healthy head that has retention. Nice little hop boquet. Pretty nice tasting beer here. It's got some bitterness. Not as much clean maltiness as I'd like in an amber lager, but it does have a crispness that is appropriate for lagers. Medium bodied. Slight lingering bitterness. Pretty nice beer here."
"Pours a light amber color with a smallish creamy head that sticks around for a little while.  Nice malty caramel aromas.  Taste is sweet caramel malt with some light hops thrown in to balance it out.  The malt is the first thing to hit the tongue with the hops lingering in the background before they get more agressive towards the end of the sip.  Sticky mouthfeel and pretty drinkable.  I think that this beer would be nice on milder spring and fall evenings.  It isn't quite light enough of body to have me drinking it in the summer time or heavy enough for the winter.  It isn't something that I would seek out but I would fall back on it in a bar or take it if offered."
"Saranac classifies this beer as a classic German amber lager.  Whatever...  Better than average IMHO."
"Spidery, clinging head, balanced nose.  Lasting taste and mouthfeel but I didn't detect a lot of cascade hop feel that the label mentioned.  Good, but not outstanding.  I guess this is what's mixed with the stout to make the Saranac Black and Tan."
"I have a soft spot for amber lagers.  New Amsterdam's Amber (Is that one still around?) used to be my old stand-by way back when.  They're nice starter beers, whether you're starting an evening or just starting to drink micros for the first time.  This one is a nice clean example with enough malt flavor and bitterness to keep it interesting."
"I tell you these Saranac variety cases are pretty good. Nice golden amber color, fully lagared to balance the sweetness & malt. Malty in smell with hints of hops and some sort of citrus. The taste is fairly mild. Malty and smooth, but mostly one dimensional. Delicate bitterness. Overall a drinkable beer though..."
"This is another solid offering from Saranac. Though I admit it not my first choice, it's still a welcome changeup. Substantial body and flavor."
"Nice balance of hops and malt.  Has an earthy taste that is very enjoyable.  This is a beer you should sit and drink with friends."
"also there wasnt any freshness date anywhere on the bottle.."
"a good, but not great beer.  like killians, but much better"
"Notes: A very nice American stab at a German Amber Lager. Too bad there was only one of these in their mixed 6-pak, I could really go for another."
