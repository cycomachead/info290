"German raised, and this was the best. (Discontinued) Their replacement pilsner is very good."

"o: this is a nice easy pilsner and a great everyday beer...a good beer to convert a macrobrew drinker."

"o: A better than average pilsner, definitely get a sense of quality all the way. A refreshing warm weather and/or thirst-quenching brew."

"Not much more you could ask for in a pilsner. Appearance is the typical clear straw golden and highly carbonated. Smell mainly consists of pilsner malt with some citrus notes. The taste is very clean consisting of a sweet nutty malt followed by light citrus hop that blends together for a nice finish."

"A thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Beer came gushing out of this can upon the crack, resulting in a yellow/whiteish color with several inches of head. Smell is of grains, lemons. Taste is malts, grains, lemony, refreshing and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a good session beer."

"Overall - Aggressively hopped for the style, which I don't mind. Still quite drinkable. I can see how the bitter back end could turn off some people, though. Definitely worked as tonight's cooking beer."

"A decent take on the style but still not one I'd revisit. Drinkable overall and crisp and refreshing but I just can't get over the type of hop profile here. Dirty, bitter, and unflavorful. Its still a solid representation of the style but maybe this one just has a bit too much flavor for me."
"Not bad for the style..."

"O- This is a great pilsner. Fantastic hop presence and great flavor."
"Poured from tap a coalhouse in Stamford ct. Pours a golden straw with a bit of white lacing. Nice crisp bready malt and some nice hop aromas. Not typical lager skunk. Great flavors of bready malt with a nice dose of fruityness and a great hop finish. This isn't your typical lager and a fantastic one at that. Perfect for this weird 85 degree May day."
""
"Food Pairings: bratwurst, pretzel w/IPA mustard, kielbasa, a grilled mortadella sandwich on crusty Italian bread with mayo and a pickle, Golabki, pasta with blueberry sauce."
"O- This is a solid pilsner with great balance. New England simply does not disappoint."

"O- A go-to beer since finding this gem when i moved to CT... A really nice, local, and always fresh german-styled pils!"

"My first beer from NEBCO - it won't be my last!"
""
"I noticed floral aromas and smells quite a bit. Nice hoppiness with a dry finish. All in all a nice pilsner that would be a good session beer."
""
"Had this a ton of times and finally now decided to review it. 12oz can in the new yellow and green cans, so its safe to assume it is pretty fresh. Pours a translucent light golden yellow color with an inch of frothy white head. Some lacing. Aromas of cut grass, floral hops, some grains, and sourdough bread. Taste is grassy with some floral hops upfront followed by a slightly sour finish. A bit bready. Crisp and really drinkable. Bit of a floral bitter aftertaste. This is my go-to beach beer. Overall, solid offering for a style that can be somewhat boring."
"If that seems too abstract or self-indulgent, I'll just say that the flavor is muddled but good. It delivers the German hops and pretty-well-done malt, but I can think of other beers that do both better."
"O - Pretty decent pilsner with a low hop profile but a lot of lasting bitterness. Was hoping for a bit more grain and toast, but oh well. A decent session beer on a hot summer day."
"Overall-A great, quality pilsener; glad to see more good lager styles cropping up in the US."
"Good version of the brew, but not for the faint of heart. Bold flavors, very enjoyable."
"Sweetish, doughy malt up front. A little toasted grain perhaps. Spicy, peppery hop bitterness comes on soon enough and makes for a snappy, refreshing beer. A little honey mid-palate. Dry finish with lingering peppery hop bitterness. Moderate body with a nice, lively feel. Very quaffable, especially on a hot, humid summer day."
""
""
""
"O: A solid pilsner overall. Not much complexity to it, but it's enjoyable and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Very solid very drinkable. Cheers."
"O - I would take Prima Pils ahead of this, but still a nice pilsener with a good flavor profile. And the cans just scream ""Take me camping"". I would get this again."

"Overall Impression- I'm not sure if I just haven't had a pilsner in a while or what but this one was beyond refreshing! Good amount of noble hop character and went down better than most brews of this style. Would recommend trying if you can get brews from New England but not a must. If I could, I would keep 1-2 of these in my fridge at all times for after a tennis match or workout. Great, refreshing lager/pils."

"O – Solid German pils that is infinitely drinkable. Has a nice light taste and would make an ass kicking summer brew."
"Mild creamy lemon aroma.Bright yellow with a mild haze. Pillow head that lingers for awhile. Medium bitter and sourness but not offensive. Has a nice clean finish. Not bad overall but seems to lack a stand out feature. I would drink one again as it is refreshing and drinkable."

"light amber pour produces a huge head of white that quickly drops off. aroma is full of grain, lots of bready notes, hints of light, very light euro hops and tons of malt. each sip is clean, crisp, clear and refreshing. nothing great about this beer, but its simplicity and ability to stay true to form should be commended. light aftertaste has a touch of corn and a light crispness that make you go back for another round."

"Pale straw, golden color with a small white head on top. Somewhat bitter and sulfury aroma.. Strong hop bite right upfront. Lingering hop flavors. Grainy taste to it. Slightly sulfury and yeasty. Good crisp mouthfeel againt the hop bite. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Nice German pils for sure."
"D - A simple unpretentious quality brew... Quaffable and refreshing... Crisp... Clean... Quite enjoyable... Loaded with flavor and complexity for a 5% ABV lager... My first New England Brewing offering leaves me excited to the try the other I picked up on a recent trip through the area... A top notch lager..."
"Overall nothing stood out as superb about this beer but it’s certainly easy to drink and is worth a shot."
"D: It's not a bad beer, just in the middle of the pack. Elm City Lager could use more bready maltiness with a sharper hoppiness that leaves the soap at home and ramps up the carbonation for much more crispness."
"Aroma of grain with a slight noble hop character. Crisp and clean with great carbonation and a light body. Drinkability is fantastic given the low alcohol and high flavor. Perfect for those hot summer days. A wonderful American version of a traditional German lager"
"O: been loving this beer recently, as I have been on a pilsner kick"
"O/D-This style is far from my favorite, but this specific beer is pretty damn tasty. The malt is the key here. It balances out those spinach-tasting hops quite well. A bit sweet, bready, hoppy, and even. Once again, NEBCO delivers. Mildly shocked to realize that Sea Hag IPA (Perhaps my favorite style of beer) is so far my least favorite branch from the NEBCO tree. Got a six pack of Elm City for nine dollars and some change; regretted the purchase after I walked out of the store. Not regretting during the session."
"Drinkability is off the charts and I have to say that this is an excellent example of an American brewed German Lager.."
"I have had this beer many times over the years,i recently bought a sixtel for my home kegerator,wow what a difference serving on tap than in a can,plus it was kegged 2 weeks ago.Great beer from a great local brewery{lucky for me 5 min from home},go n/e go.Great german pills with an american twist,highly recomended a top 5 german pills hands down!"
"Pour yields a bright yellow beer with a very nice white head and quite a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward mild grain plus a touch of light Noble hops. The flavor is slightly bready with some grain and hay. Not too much spicy hop flavor, but there is a decent amount of bitterness in the finish. Feel is light and only moderately crisp, though not as much as I'd like for the style. Fairly drinkable and a nice brew on a rather warm Spring evening."
"Taste was pretty creamy and smooth. A decent amount of noble hops in there. A bit pronounced upfront and a bit more fruity than some other Pilsner's but it became really light when paired with some food."
"D - Very drinkable. Clean and crisp from start to end, but still enough flavor to keep it enjoyable. The flavor is really nice all around."
"(12oz can). Pours clear golden with white head. Aroma of florals and grass. Taste is a sweet malt backbone with a definite hope bite up front and at the end. Medium bodied with slick texture. Finish is slightly bitter and has a bite. Not bad at all...."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable, sessionable brew. Great on a hot summer day."
"Drinkable enough, a good, not a great Pils, but easily the equal of many I've had in Germany"
"$1.70 for the single."
"This is a really nice pils and one of the best domestics not made in PA I would say. I need to get a growler of this at the brewery next time I'm there because I bet the carbonation is better and the beer is therefore even better as well. Quite enjoyable."
"On the high side of light bodied with medium carbonation, I like the mouth feel and I reckon the drinkability is great. A very nice treat for myself."
"D- Its easy to drink for sure. Not sure how often I'd go after this one."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small sweet standard lager smell. In the taste, a small sweet lager standard-ness and a bit perfume like. A smooth and light to medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry perfume like aftertaste. An OK lager but quite perfume like."
"D-I am liking this the more I drink. A quality, solid and refreshing brew that is the go to local alternative to any BMC mass produced swill offering. Support your Local and drink well! Nice job NEBC."
"This isn't a style of beer that I frequent but I actually really enjoyed the taste. There was a prominent biscuity malt and distinct yeast. The highlight of the taste in my opinion was there was a very nice kind of nuttiness to it. I am not sure what kind but it was there and very tasty. The hops were faded in the back but that didn't take away from the beer at all. The mouthfeel was medium to light and a bit sticky. I could definitely drink more than a few of these. A very good beer!"
"Across the board this is a slightly above average beer. It's got a nice hoppiness to it that again is true to style which makes it both crisp and refreshing. It's hardly bitter but the hop bite is nice. There is a malt presence here but it kind of takes a backseat to the hops. The yeast comes through a bit too strong for me, that's my main criticism of this. It almost has a bit a a belgian taste from the yeast, some fruity esters. Still a nice refreshing lager."
"Poured from a can a crisp and perfectly carbonated yellow color. Aromas were muted but pleasant wet grains and a touch of alcohol. This is a really great German style Pilsener with decent hop showing and that crisp malt bite. Highly recommend if youre in the mood for something refreshing or looking for a session beer. Too bad its not an option on Long Island."
"Drinkability is just like SN Summerfest, drink it cold on a hot day and you won't regret it, tends to get a little boring if these two factors aren't together, though."
"Poured this into a pint glass. The pours is light see through yellow with a bit of a cloudy body. About two fingers of a creamy, fluffy white head sit atop and retain nicely. This looks amazing! The smell is of grain, wheat, oats and other earthy aromas. Subtle spiciness and lemon zest finish this strong. The flavor is grainy and full of pilsner malts with a touch of bitterness at the finish. This one is really rocking my socks! Nice and light with great flavors give this a nice mouthfeel and outstanding drinkability. This is just what I wanted tonight. Bravo!"
"A very solid session beer, especially in the summer months."
"A pretty decent summer time beer. Easy to drink, light toasty taste with some noble hop flavor in the back. Honestly, I wish the macrobrews would make their beers taste more like this and less like corn and rice adjuncts. After I finished the brew, I did get a weird metallic taste, but overall I was satisfied."
"Tasted from 12oz can. Pours golden with a one-finger white head that has some staying power. Nose is somewhat skunky with some sweet malts and anise. Flavors are light with some malts and a very light hoppiness. The body is light with average carbonation and a pretty short finish. Despite the lack of any complexity, this beer is actually very enjoyable."
"This is a great go to beer for the summer season yet still serviceable all year long. Fairly light and very refreshing but flavorful. There's a nice grainy undercurrent to the moderately hoppy flavor. This would be better poured into a glass of course but is still quite good out of the can at a summer picnic."
"Solid German pils, the brewer compares it to Radeberger, which is very apt."
"D - pretty good, very refreshing and drinkable. great outdoorsy beer for the summer. i have quite a few German Pils I enjoy more, though this is not bad by any means."
"D- I would drink this stuff in mass quantities. Particularly in the summer... after mowing the lawn."
"Pilsner lovers would like this a lot."
"All in all, this is a decent easy drinking, every day, light beer. Might be an easy crossover brew from mainstream to craft. Not worth hunting, but decent to drink if you have access."
"Taste is grainy, with subtle bitterness, and some floral notes. Definitely crisp, and a very clean taste. It really reminds me of a standard adjunct lager, nothing exciting, but not bad. Light body, a little refreshing, slight carbonation."
"D: Very drinkable, low in ABV and good flavor make this a great summer time beer from a can."
"Another example of a tasty beer in a can. More like this will help erase the idea that only macro swill comes in cans."
"Another solid product from NEBC. VERY drinkable, could have several of these. Hoping to pick up a growler some day and taste the brewery fresh version."
"Drinkability really isn't too bad. While not particularly spectacular, I enjoyed the beer enough. If I had regular access to it, I wouldn't put it in regular rotation but wouldn't mind sipping a few here & there."
"F: Finishes with some dryness and a little bitter spicy hop character. A slight grassy hop also comes out on the finish. Some slight wheat and banana flavors also linger a bit. A slight lip smacking stickiness too combined with the dry finish to create a strange mouth feel. Overall a nice lager, I would almost even be compelled to drink from the can on a hot summers day."
"This is a solid German pilsner that, well, pleases. I could drink plenty of these in one sitting!"
"Mouthfeel is light with above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, I could easily have several of these. This isn't my favorite style but it's a very good beer for it's style."
"Very easy drinking beer."
"Thanks, Ezone024, for the opportunity"
"definitely a main stay any time of year"
"Drinkability - Best German Pilsener I have had - while not my favorite style, this is miles above the bestselling Heineken"
"Mouthfeel is light and thin with moderate carbonation. Flavors are humble and present themselves well to the style. The fact that I can taste the hops at all, or anything for that matter is remarkable. Great lawnmower brew for a hot day."
"Pours a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, a little spice note. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice little hop bite, slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew, very tasty."
"Reviewed on 07/27/2009. Can. Pours a clear golden with a white head. Aroma of diacetyl and grainy cardboardy wheat malt. Tastes alright at first, very sweet though and then a diacetyl and wheaty finish. Blargh, this was pretty bad, especially the diacetyl. A flawed beer."
"Local craft brew from a can.. hooray beer! Had this one after a long,hot day at work so the scores may be skewed up a bit but this is one damn tasty beer. A nice solid pils on the level of a Victory Prima Pils for sure, has the nice hop bite to it and great mouthfeel and drinkability. Very balanced and smooth and nothing offensive at all for it, makes for a great session beer.. went down way too quick for me!"
"A drinkable brew. Would work well with a smoked pork sandwich. A good canned alternative for a hot day on the golf course. Taste is strong, but a bit too sweet."
"what the heck is with the weird off-flavors? it's drinkable - pleasant, even (esp if you like microwave popcorn). but seems totally off for a pils..."
"Drinkability: super sessionable, no bitter bite. I could easily have a six. Another surprisingly good pils."
"Nice. A solid Micro-Lager here with tight flavors and a good crispness and easy quaffability. Good job putting this one in cans, as it really comes off as a good choice for a summertime guzzle."
"Pretty drinkable beer, I was pleasantly surprised."
"Overall: Really good drinkability. Very nice interesting flavors. A little on the sweet side but still pretty refreshing."
"No hits, no runs, but most importantly, no errors."
"There's a good beer struggling to get through here. I don't know what's up with the butter smell, but it really took a chunk out of the quality of this brew. But it's still pretty refreshing despite that."
"D- Overall, Elm City Lager is a great Pils that I will definitely be picking up more of when the temperature starts to rise. This is a great outdoors beach/fishing beer because it is light bodied, tasty and convenient in a can! Recommended!"
"D- A good German inspired pilsner in a can no less. Light on the alcohol and a sharp flavor profile makes this a go to. This does not look like much coming from the can, (watery) but holds up in taste."
"Poured into a pint glass. A bright yellow color with a thin white head. Smells a bit of baking products, not much else. It tastes like some freshly baked white bread, just a tad sweet. The mouthfeel is cool and crisp. The drinkability is solid, it is one that would go well throughout a night of playing some poker."
"I could drink this all day. 5%, light crisp flavors and finish. Just my kind of summer beer."
"Very drinkable and a nice session brew. For what it is, it's nice, but it's not a classic that's for sure."
"New England Brewing has pretty decent German Pilsener here. It's a little low on flavor and character, but it's far from bad. It's a little to earthy and grassy. Some of the other flavors could stand a little more of the spotlight. There's far superior German Pilseners out there. But, this isn't a bad option by any means. Thanks, Chris."
"D: Very drinkable beer and I enjoyed it this time around alot more than I remembered."
"Serving type: can"
"This is quite sessionable; be sure to serve extra cold, though."
"Picked up a single can of this beer today. Poured in to a Stella glass a clear gold, with a tiny white head. Carbonation bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Smell is wonderfully malty and clean, with some pine, mint leaf, cream, biscuit...and more. Taste is creamy, and lightly carbonated, with enough hop flavor to support the malt. Bod is light, creamy, and lightly crisp. Drinkability is very good. Sort of a weird interpretation of the style, but still really good. Gets a thumbs up from me."
"Pours a bright, hazy yellow with a massive puffy white head that shows good retention and lacing. Smell is fairly generic with hints of lemon and spice on top of a mild grainy malt aroma with faint hops in the background. The taste was a bit more complex and enjoyable than the smell would indicate with some nice spiciness mixed in with floral hops and the light bready malts. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and super crisp. Drinkability is extremely high on this and I could see myself polishing off a six pack of these on a hot summer afternoon."
"A pretty good beer, paired very well with an extremely sharp cheddar"
"My pour created a nice, big, thick two fingers' worth of foamy, bone-white head. The color was a light yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was properly hoppy and a welcome relief from some of the swill that I have been exposed to recently. The mouthfeel was medium with a definite Saaz hops presence on the tongue. The can read ""lager", but this was a pilsner, through and through. The finish was mildly dry and quite refreshing. I wish that I had some more of this, I'll tell you."
"A light yellow beer with a slight haze and some lace. Has a big foamy white head. The aroma has a light grain character with a light floral and lemon background. The flavor starts with a light grainy malt note on the tip of the tongue. Followed by a rush of prickly hops along the side of the tongue and a hint of lemon in the background. The finish ends on a light herbal/floral hop note."
"Sweet aroma of lemony malt, and the quaff is on the sweet side also. A dry, ascorbic finish rounds this brew out nicely. Crisp and clean on the palate. Wow, now, this would be excellent camping, floating, etc - outside activities, beer on the go!"
"The guys at New England Brewing are mad cool, and I've gotta support local breweries, so I'll recommend it. I'm not a lager fan, but this is quite drinkable ... did I mention local? I think I did; support local brewers!"
"D- This is a solid lager that would make a great session beer, good flavor and balance, alcohol is well-masked, extremely easy drinking"
"Pours a slightly hazed golden, decently thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a thin layer, a few lace spots. Smell is very floral, lots of lemon, bit of sourness/acidity, bread, grains, and some grass. Taste is pretty clean, a bit of apple, bread, floral, sweet caramel and honey finish, bit of a sour citrusy kick, good balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very clean, refreshing, nicely done lager. I generally like a bit more of a hop bite but this has some nice flavors."
"Pours a slightly fogged straw with a decent white head. Nose is not very eventful. Fairly clean and sweet. Favor is earthy, but not dirty. Carbonation is a lot of small bubbles that continually hit the tongue, but don't obliterate it. Easy to drink. Nice enough. Not the greatest of the style, but it's not too bad"
"Fine for an easy-drinking refresher, but reminds me more of a pseudo-pils, even a macro ""pils"" without the adjuncts or continual fizziness."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, nice fit for a can."
"D - I enjoyed this beer. I could not find one thing bad to say about it. I would consider buying it again on my next trip to Virginia."
"Everything seems amplified compared to a normal German pils, but considering it's made in the US, such an interpretation is only natural. One of the best canned beers you can get and a great all-around pilsner. Go try it."
"New England Elm City Lager pours a yellow color with a thick white head from a twelve ounce can. The aroma is a bit grainy with a touch of citrus and perhaps some hops, but they don't really stand out. There's a flash of hops in the flavor, followed by grain and maybe a touch of citrus. I like German pils, but this one doesn't do it for me. Average overall."
"Pale yellow colored beer.Nose has hint of skunk.Taste has slight biscuit that turns to skunk on aftertaste.I""ve been generous to german pilsners in past but I can't do it anymore. I would not recommend unless you like liquid skunk.You don't do you??"
"Nothing spectacular but solid - -and to support a local brewery with a canning line..."
"Not bad, not bad, ...."
"Overall a very nice domestic rendition of the style. Highly drinkable."
"[Served chilled, in a tumbler]"
"A clear pale gold color brew with a modest head that quickly settles to a dusting with a little lacing present. Overall it does not appear very lively and has a bit of a skunky aroma but there is an interesting hint of rhubarb and rye bread. The taste leans more toward biscuit & cracker, pretty dry. An interesting blend of cereal and tartness which is a bit odd but better than average stuff, especially from a can. Not my favorite NEB, but a unique and worthy lager."
"While I didn't expect Elm City Lager to be as good as Sea Hag IPA, I expected it to be better than it ended up being. Since I know very little about brewing, take this with a grain of salt. Wouldn't adding the hops later in the boil help increase flavor while decreasing bitterness? The world needs more canned beer, but it needs better canned beer than this."
"poured out of a can with a clean, clear ,golden color , small head with spotty lacing ,tight group of busy bubbles. ever so slight hint of hops , definitely smelled like most other American lagers, not alot going on- it is what it is. First hit was crisp, cleah, AHHH. Peppery at first, smooth at the end. If you like the style this beer is definitely for you, definitely an ADB ( all day brew ). Just a straight forward lager with just that little bit of UMPH, maybe the pepper, that keeps this selection from being riding mower boring. With the 5% ABV you start to feel good without being bogged down with mass quanities. Recommended. Anyone know if there is anywhere in the Waterbury area that sells this selection on tap ?"
"Had this one from a 12 oz. can. Nice straw color with fluffy head. Some sticky sheet lacing throughout. Faint floral hops in the aroma. The taste is a very good representation of a pils, although a bit light on the hop bite (the way I like it). The mouthfell could have been a bit more full, but good nonetheless. The drinkability of this one is quite good, as a pils should be. Overall a winner from Rob Leonard. Prosit!!"
"Very sessionable. Will have to get some more of this. A lager that will give you a nice little hop fix. Might be a bit crisp/unbalanced for non-hopheads."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, excellent representation of style, this is a good beer to just keep on drinking for an entire evening or to just pop open with your meal."
"This one isn't bad. It's got good flavour to it and is an easy drinker. I'm just not a huge pilsner fan, especially such straightforward by the books ones. That said, if you are into the style, you'll dig this one."
"Pours with an attractive clear golden color and little head. Lacing on the glass. The nose is simple and fresh, featuring German hops with a fine-grain roughness to them and some lightly bready malt notes. Not too forward, but easy going and pretty. On the palate, light sweetness mixing with light, green bitterness before drying out and getting quite a bit more bitter toward the end. Juicy carbonation and the perfect combination of smooth malts and just a touch of rough hop oils to make things interesting. I can't say enough about this lager. It's so easy to drink and yet so tasty; every element of it is spot-on to style and well-developed in its own way. Just an excellent lager. If only it were around 4% ABV instead of 5%, it would be one of my all-time go-to session beers."
"Poured into a pilsner a clear medium golden with a large fluffy white head that left multiple rows of lace as it settled rather slowly,good combination of firm toasty malt and floral hop with a hint of citrus in the nose.Like in the nose this starts out firm and toasty with a light mineral quality to it a big herbal and spicey note really shows thru and lingers in the finish.A well built lager beer it has some real character and alot of good flavor as well as being on the lighter side,recommended for sure."
"Toasted grains with floral and subtle citrus fruit hop notes attached. Citrus fruit hop notes coat the palate and add to the smooth mouthfeel. Fruit notes include lemon zest, orange peel, and straw. Floral hops remind me of a wildflower patch in a field. Carbonation cleans everything out leaving the taste buds wanting more. Excellent drinkability as it's easy drinking, light, and quite refreshing with a nice hop profile. Low abv makes this a true summer session brew or maybe a lawn mower beer. Either or, get it if you can."
"Pale gold with extremely active carbonation and a fluffy, sticky pristine-white head. Lovely, subtle herbal spice aromas, just slightly sulfuric but mostly vegetal in character. Solid pilsner nose. Bready malts fight the good fight against a barrage of noble hop spiciness; the malt seems to win out initially in the finish, then accedes to the hop spice yet again. However, they triumph in the long aftertaste. Feels somewhat full on the palate, given the style -- but I really like it! This is a ""heavier"" pilsner, one that is not quite as crisp and clean as others. But it's got the advantage of holding its own in colder weather due to its substantial body. A pilsner appropriate for winter. Will buy again."
"Okay, so here's a micro's version of a macro. I know, I know... that's a harsh to say...but read on. This beer pours remarkably light and frothy in my glass with a scent reminiscent of B/M/C. I said a scent, not full blown aromas-calm down. The taste is simple, and the aftertaste is waning. Easy does it. This is, all around, a decent brew. Ah, there it is. It's light, easy-going and not too high in alc.. I liked it, and that's how I scored it- just be ready for a micro-fied version of a lager."
"The only micro I could find in a can; a first attempt to convert my hockey team from Bud Light to quality beer. Pours a golden yellow with a thin white head. Smell is pleasantly hoppy. The taste is crisp and clean, with pleasant bitterness undercut with some sweetness from the malt. I've gotten away from this style, won over by the big IPA's and complex Belgians, but this is a great example of an often ignored beer."
"This is another one of the rare American pilsners that taste like a real German pils (""big deal"" the light lager haters might say). Light golden straw color, faint sulphur aroma; firm, light hay-like malt up front, minty hop ala Elmers paste with a mineral character, and a quick dry finish. This one cleans all the mustard out of my mouth. If they only put this in a 750ml size can like Fosters, then I would keep a can in my fridge at all times in case of emergency."
"Very drinkable. This will be a great summer thirst quencher...at only $6.50 a six, it's a no-brainer. I think this will also be a good beer-beer for my friends and family that don't want my IPAs and Belgians with their burgers. Nice going NEB !!"
"Thanks to Lagrin for the sample."
"This was the beer that, for me, started it all--I met a friend at BAR here in New Haven. This was on tap, and she picked it. At the end of the night I hesitantly sipped the last of her beer, previously thinking all beer tasted like piss or coal. Those two sips shattered my aversion for (previously having tasted only macro) beer and revealed that just maybe not all beer was awful...and thus the beer journey began. Nice to come back to this and find I enjoy it now just as much, if not more, than ever."
"D: A solid German pilsner with a few areas for improvement (simple taste, harsh initial mouthfeel). Light and enjoyable with malt and hops characteristics made for partaking of liberally."
"I don't know if this is available in Pa., but I hope it is. I would get a case of this tomorrow. Very well made pilsner, clean, crisp, and hoppy. It would be a wonderful session pounder."
"This pours a yellowish straw with a large foamy head. The smell has a real ""bisquity"" aroma to it.There are also some floral scents to this beer. The taste has some sweet maltiness and alittle fruitiness. The m/f is light and well balanced. Not a bad brew,but not perfect. This can be an everday summer pilsner work beer."
"Drinkability: This is a very pleasant mild flavored beer. I wouldn't call it subtly refined like other beers I've had that aren't supposed to be big and bold in flavor. Sessionable. Screw High Life, I want this for my cheap (I assume) weekend chore beer!"
"I don't know if this is to be found west of CT. I've never seen it in my neck of the woods (Ohio). But I recommend it if you can find it."
"A nice example of the style, which I grew to appreciate more with each can. Good crossover beer, too. Something to look for besides the Hookers in CT."
"Drinkability... SO much better than macros! Definitely the best beer from a can I have had, of any style. I highly recommend trying this."
"This lager poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass in a few places. The smell was malt with a hint of sweetness. The taste was bready malt with dry, chalky hoppiness, and there was a faint hint of sulfur. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium body and modest carbonation. The finish and aftertaste were mildly malty with noble(?) hops lingering. This was a very enjoyable pilsner."
"New England's Elm City Lager should clearly dismiss the foolish notion that there are no good beers in a can! From its beautiful appearance and seductive aroma, to its superbly balanced flavor... it's a winner! A bright-white dollop of creamy foam rises above its clear golden body, and holds quite well, leaving rings of craggy lace throughout the glass. The nose is clearly laden with bright and vibrant Hallertau hops over a delicately sweet pilsner malt base. In the mouth it's smooth and gently crisp with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation and medium body. The flavor delivers a superbly balanced combination of clean, lightly-sweet pilsner malt; grassy, lightly citrusy, floral and mildly herbal hops; and a supportive bitterness that keeps it's malt in check and leads to a dry finish. Superbly done and on par with some of the best examples from southern Germany!"
"Part of the Blue and Gray BIF package from BA Counselor, this 12 oz. can was poured into a Pilsner glass, and revealed a clear pale golden beer with two finger foamy head. The aroma was a subtle and pleasant combination of grainy malt, and spicy hops. The taste was crisply refreshing, very mild, and balanced between hops and malt, with slight edge to the hops. Creamy mouthfeel with a little lemony aftertaste."
"Served from a can into a pint glass. Pours a shiny golden color with a tall head that falls fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is grainy and has a slight hop and slight malt character, but nothing too noticeable. The flavor has a basic caramel malt with a slightly spicy hop. Slightly metallic. Medium body and very easy to drink. I think this is a what an American Lager should be based on."
"Good thin body, chock full of [slightly] sweet malt and it becomes bitter and very dry at the finish. The finish is also on the short side, which I prefer in a beer of this style. The drinkability is excellent which makes the reasonable price a good thing. It pairs well with an ultra chic plate of hot dogs and bowl of Boston baked beans. Woo-hoo! Enjoy."
"Appeared a cloudy and golden color with a big, white fluffy head. Carbonation appeared plentiful. Smells of apples with grassy, grainy notes. Taste was far too metallic for my liking. Hidden beneath the metal flavors were subtle flavors of crisp apples. Lots of carbonation in the mouth, light to medium-bodied. Not my bag."
"Cheers, Huge."
"Drinkable due to how light on the palate and low in abv%, but I couldn't bring myself for my wallet and tastebuds' sake to have another one. Just a mediocre pilsener."
"Mouthfeel is great! This is a beer that I can drink a lot of and be happy about it...in fact, Sulldaddy and I drank a case of it on Halloween! The carbonation is clean and apparent, and tickles your tongue a bit on the way down. Nicely done brew...as you can see above, this beer is very drinkable...tough beer for beer pong though!!! (ha)"
"Gold in hue, there is a chill haze, no animation. The head was white, bubbly, and about two fingers in height because the pour was a little hard. Head retention was fair, the foam slipped to a soapy cap. Subsequent lacing was unorganized and spotty. This beer is pleasant looking, better than ordinary. The nose is interesting. My first sniff caused be to check the can again, yep, it is a lager. The nose doesnt convince me of that. Sure the citrusy-herbal-grassy smells say German but the lack of malty aromas and the lack of distinctive lager cleanliness throw me for a loop. Hell, there is even a dull fruitiness that reminds me of an ale. Who cares! This is a Pilsner of sorts; Ill leave it at that. The potency is moderate but Im able to hear what this beer is saying. Inviting. The palate, again, is more ale-like (to me) than lager-like. Why? The lack of a malt backbone. There is no typical Pilsner maltiness, the flavors that are presented are lively with a twang of citrus, some lemon-grass, then some herbalness and even some random fruitiness. It is not very bitter but there are some flowery moments. I cant convince myself that Elm City Lager is really a German Pilsner. I dont need to convince myself that this is a damn tasty beer! I really like. True, the palate is simple and this beer is not a thinker, its a drinker! Super easy to quaff and enjoy. This beer, in the can, would be a welcome sight for all outdoor activities. Medium/medium-light in body, low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is very pleasant. The body fits the flavors ideally (oddly, considering it lacks malty oomph on the tongue). Like I said, it is very tasty and easy to drink. It is a session beer for a lazy-mental day. Thanks UnionMade! Good beer in a can is still a fun novelty for me!"
"One of the few micros I've purchased in a can and this is one I'll purchase again when I next visit CT. I can best describe it as a crisp, clear golden beer with the taste and body lacking in so many macro lagers. Nice hoppiness for a lager. Very fresh and clean. I've also had this product on tap at the brewery and would give it similar ratings to the canned variety. This surprises me as I usually prefer draft beer but in this instance noted little quality decline in the canned product. Now I just hope they expand their distribution area."
"726"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" white head on top of a bright straw brew. Effervescent, pale malt aroma. Lacing is good, with big bubbles left on the sides of the glass here and there. Taste has a bit of a sweet pale malt flavor (for a pilsener-style), then fades into a slightly hoppy character. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is excellent. Hopefully they'll branch distribution north just a tad sometime in the future, everyone needs a good canned beer like this for those no-glass venues..."
"This is a well constructed pilsener....a nice summer beer...light bodied and easy drinking with some character...not a personal favorite style but I can appreciate it....solid not spectacular.."
"A nice surprise in a can! Nice light yellow appearance, long lasting head and nice lacing. Presented a distinct pleasant malt flavor. Taste was lightly malted with a tasty hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel was crisp and light to medium in body. A very refreshing brew that is very easy to drink. A definite summer brew."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. Nice big fluffy white head with good retention. Lacing is good. Nice herbal hop aroma. Sightly spicy on the nose as well. There's a little bit of a hop bitterness to the taste. Some light bready malts underneath. And earthy hops. The body is about medium and the carbonation is at an appropriate level. This is a decent enough pilsner, but there's room for improvement."
"6 pack for 5.99. Nice price for a kick ass beer. Poured out more of a straw/gold color with some nice amount of carbonation in there. Aroma consisted of some spicy hops, malts, and some grassy tones that goes along with a german pils. Some slight citrus and nutty aromas, but those were very slight. Taste was nice. Malts seem to be toasted a little bit which gives it a nice kick combined with the spicy hops. A little bit peppery at times I've noticed as well. The aftertaste had that peppery taste to it, but wasn't overwhelming. This went down nice and easy. Buy a 6 pack of this brew when going over a friend that only drinks macro, see if this will win him/her over. It will win them over. Best canned beer yet."
"Wyll-"
"I've never tasted a cleaner beer. It's pretty much just two ingredients. I wouldn't mind a bit more malt and body, but it's top notch stuff, nonetheless. I thought the malt was a little better on tap. A real treat that anyone stopping in CT should pick up. I know cans aren't what they used to be, but I'm still surprised at how good this is. Reminiscent of the classic german pilsners, amazing that this is brewed in the USA, let alone my home state."
"First sip reveals a medium bodied brew with fine gentle carbonation. The flavor is very crisp and refreshing with sweet grainy malt up front leading to a bitey hop finish. WOuld be great at the beach or just sitting out in the yard reading a book. The beer is very well crafted and I cant wait to have the next can! Look for these in your local beer store soon!"
"i had the very first Elmy City Lager today at the brewery IN A CAN!!! finally a good craft brewed beer in can . this lager has many of the same quilties as spaten lager. crisp, light malt and smooth with a hint of noble hops in the finish. I can't wait until this summer when i can bring this beer fishung at the many locations that don't allow bottles."
