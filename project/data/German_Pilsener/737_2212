The body was a thin one but this wasn't anything too serious, it was the taste that was the real problem here with very little to it at all.

An otherwise unremarkable beer, but like most German pilseners imported into this province, it's still pretty good value for the price point. That reason alone means I will probably return to it in the future. A middle-of-the-road lager that shouldn't ruffle too many feathers.","thehyperduck","Jun 15, 2014"

AROMA: holy Hallertau! metallic iron hammer a la Thor or a nine-iron to the nostrils--subtler hints of fragrant apple and pear with a bit of dough...a stronger, more forceful pilsner... PALATE: medium-bodied, crisp, almost biting mouthfeel--softens at the finish; highly drinkable, with a more lagerish body than expected...TASTE: apple/pear and good ol' Hallertau; a rather simple formula that also gives off fragrant waves of other fruits... OVERALL: a pleasant variation on the Bavarian theme--a pilsner that is a bit less clean and crisp, but retains enough of its style to cleanse and pucker; refreshing yet substantial...","dacrza1","Apr 30, 2014"

It has a decent bitterness at the finish to zip up the taste and keep me thirsty for more. It tastes a little doughy and a little fruity. The bitterness is a little wooden and peppery with maybe a hint of juniper. I'm not much of a pilsner guy, but I found this to be quite pleasing and very refreshing.

The aroma of spicy grassy hops is all over this one. There is bit of cereal grains that give off some good notes as well. The taste follows the nose. Nice spicy bitterness throughout the entire brew and the grains show through as well. The brew is mild and is ideal for a hot summer/spring day. A great German pilsner.","phishgator","Jun 07, 2011"

It looks like a a yellow bodied beer with a foamy white head that has light carbonation bubbles rising from the glass. The smell to me is not pleasent, makes me feel like it's gone bad or something. The taste is grassy, very much like fresh cut grass. Some earth and leafs may be in there too. The mouthfeel was light and easy to drink thankfully. I don't ever need to have this one again.","Knapp85","May 19, 2011"

Very light and clean flavor, crisp, refreshing nothing out the ordinary in any way.

4.48,26.2,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"Poured it high into a pint glass, finding a good sturdy head that dissipated quickly, leaving a thin ring of foam at top. Beautiful straw blond color, delicious yeasty hoppy malty aroma. The Hallertau hops in there sing a gorgeous bitter floral chorus. Again, I usually prefer a bouquet of different hops, but this one variety can stand up for a gorgeous solo so rich you'd think it was a chorus. Taste is crisp, transparent, the malt and yeast so perfectly balanced with the hops that you have to imagine there's something really special about even just the water in this beverage. Mouthfeel is bracing, a bite just sharp enough, makes you want a liverwurst onion sandwich on pumpernickel with hot mustard and horseradish. Do both, if you can! The aftertaste lets the hops hang on so delicately, and yet with bitter authority, that you have to wish these little bottles were twice as big. Such a good beer, this! I found it disappeared faster than the usual brew, leaving no lacing on glass, a lack I'd usually deplore if it hadn't tasted so good. So easy to swallow! I find local beers much more politically correct, but again I have to make an exception for this stupid little glass container hauled all the way here to Upstate NY from Germany: it's worth it! Well, it's worth getting your friend to give it to you, anyway. My ""drinkability"" index usually depends on whether I can afford to drink it; after all, if I'm not ""able"" to purchase the stuff, I'm not able to drink much, either.

All of this nearly whelms the malt backbone, which is pretty light but still complex and different enough to appear behind the hops, cracker-like and mildly biscuity. The intensity and character of the hops make me think of a dry, sharp cheddar in some ways. Drying and crisp on the finish with a resiny hops, there's lemon zest and herbal character present.

Fortunately my fears were quickly calmed by a beautiful straw colored Pils topped by soft fine bubbled head. The head was my partner through the beer test as it stayed until the last drop to make sure I had smile on faceÂ….and I did. The aroma and flavor are unmistakably Â“Friesisch-herbÂ”. The hops are very herbal, part spearmint and part floral. This pairs nicely to a brisk malt aroma. The flavor profile follows the aroma like its twin. Upfront is a burst of hop bitterness and flavor that is neither mild nor overwhelming. I guess that means nicely down the middle. This beer is Northern German and this means two things in comparison to the Pils in the pretty part of Germany (The south ;)Â….ein Witz). Much drier and more bitter. (General Guidelines of course) The malt plays a background role but plays its part nicely and adds support to a beer that would be one dimensional without the support. This beer is all about hops; even the aftertaste is a dry hop flavor that urges you to drink more to quench your thirst. Unfortunately this becomes a vicious cycle and before you know it the Kister is empty. Not the best Pils in the country (not even close actually) but lives up to its reputation. I hope this beer in the green bottle is able to find you in good shape. (I mean both you and the bottle.) Zum Wohl!","Ungespundet","May 16, 2007"

After the initial hop sensation, there's a pleasant maltiness that's enough to give flavor but not enough to cloy. The taste ends with a crisp dryness, setting you up for the next pleasing sip.

Initailly the nose was big in the green bottle mercaptain skunkyness. After letting it sit, I find solid grainy character from the pilsner malt with just a touch of honey sweetness. There is a touch of herbal noble hop in there, but the pilsner malt is dominant. Flavor is definately dominated with grainyness. This is followed by a light herbal hop and a mild biterness and a light metallic flavor on the finish. I'd like the hop flavor to be more prevalent in this. The feel is light with a moderate carbonation. This one is an okay pilsner. I don't think I would go out of m way for it again, but I wouldn't turn it down.","kmpitz2","Mar 18, 2006"

Classic pilsener nose: slightly skunky, cat-pee, herbal, and floral. Taste differs very little from the aroma. Heavy on the skunkiness, like a Heineken, but with a bit more character. Clean, crisp, lively finish, pretty decent German hops profile. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated with a bit more body than one might expect.

Good strong floral hops, with some breadiness for balance. But the bread fades long before the bitter, leaving a wonderful hoppy bite at the back of the jaw.

It has a nice strong taste upfront that leaves the palate completely bare after a second - very interesting - makes it sooo easy to drink.

There is a beautiful honey, burned suger and nougat maltiness coursing underneath, but from nose to tail this beer is all about the noble bud. ""That's dry."" Bitter, dry, but not out of balance. On the back are the words ""Zutaten: Wasser, Gerstenmalz, Hopfenextrakt, Hopfen."" I'm struggling with my own dogma. Is it OK to add hop extract? It seems like a manipulation. And in fact, the hoppiness, while very entertaining, seems a bit exaggerated, almost cartoonish. I would complain more if I thought they were hiding something, but it seems clear that the other components are very well done. My conclusion is that they are shooting for an extremely hoppy style, which, if they used fresh, or at least whole hops, would be prohibitively expensive. I give this beer high marks for uniqueness and personal sentiment.","putnam","Sep 18, 2002"
4.19,18,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Although this review is for draft, I wanted to point out that the word ""herb"" on the bottled product means ""dry"" or ""bitter"" and is indicative of this North German pilsner's very dry style. Crystal clear and bright golden in color with a bright white head that holds fairly well. Very nice appearance. The aroma is quite hoppy as pilsners go - very noble, lightly grassy and highly floral. Some light, grainy malt aroma is present as well. The body is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. The flavor starts dry with a burst of hop bitterness, warming as it crosses the palate to reveal a firm grainy maltiness, and finishes long and bitter. The emphasis is definitely on hop bitterness with around 45 IBU's! Very one sided in many ways, but also with quite alot of finesse! A somewhat unique, refreshing and enjoyable pils.
