"Overall- A real good pils, I would drink this again."

"Very nice hopped pils, with a good malt back.  Smooth, not fizzy.  Poured a golden yellow with a nice 1 inch head that stays, creamy feel and look.  Very nice.  No European malt flavor.  American made and tastes.  Too bad the big boys can't brew one like this."

"OK at best, odd soapy quality. Like my pilsners razor clean."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"P- Pairs best with a bleak, violent, desaturated atmosphere like Takashi Miike's OldBoy. Contrasts Dae-Suh's hopelessness nicely."
""

"This is one of my favorites. Neck and neck with many Czech pils."

"This is a nice pilsener. It's extremely easy to drink and is something you can toss back all day in the summer. It's refreshing and thirst quenching. It's pretty standard for the style, but it's well crafted."
""
""
""
""
"I've been drinking loads of crap like Leinenkugel Summer Shandy, Labatt Blue, and even -- gulp -- Bud Light recently, so this hit the proverbial spot, and I'm probably overrating this a bit because of that fact."

"I have to give props to Sly Fox Pikeland Pils; Victory Prima Pils (Silver); as well as Stoudt's Pils, but if you like Pils, Troegs ain't no slouch, baby."

"Overall: I probably won't drink this again. I can't say this beer is Bad, but it's not something I'd really like to drink. Given to me, I'll drink it, but I'll likely never pay for it again. Troegs beers with me are hit or miss. Some I love, some I really dislike."

"Overall- On the refreshing side and goes down easy. The flavor was not really too bold. Not too far off from a Coors in my opinion. Still not bad and appropriate for a hot day as the name suggests."
"Pours to a one finger head that falls to an eighth inch layer with erratic lacing. Pale gold color. Aroma is pilsner malt and grassy/spicy German hops. Flavor is subtle yet spot on with perfect balance of the malt and the noble hops. Mouthfeel is true to style. Damn good Pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O - I've had this in year's past but I must say, this is the best it has ever tasted. I think they upped the hop/bitterness level a bit. At 4.5% with a flavor I really enjoy; this will be a summer staple. Well done."

"Pours clear yellow, see through and sunny. Little bit of foam on top. Strong lemon citrus nose. Bright. Little tang taste in the back. Subtle bitter pokes through. Creamy mouthfeel. More prominent bite. The sun on the label must be mad at me."

"this is right on for an American pils, its got everything it should have and nothing it shouldn't, while remaining interesting enough to keep my attention though several. it has a barely cloudy bright yet pale yellow color, with an inch of white foam that recedes back into the glass slowly. I smell classic german pils malts, light and clean, refreshing for sure, with all kinds of citrus in both lemon and hops. a uniquely refreshing taste, hopped better than most, but still malt forward and nicely balanced. I have always admired the bigger beers from troegs, but this one proves they can cover the spectrum. this is a great summer beer, a good potential segue into craft for those who don't already drink it. fizzy carbonation and a clean finish, I could session this stuff all summer. fantastic when ice cold, not as much when it warms up, so slug it down."
""
""
"Slightly dry… not digging that… yet very good flavor, close to a Jever, but lacking the aroma that should correspond with the taste."
""
"Overall-Crisp, refreshing, light and very easy drinking. This is a great summer day brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall the Sunshine Pils is a nice take on the pilsner style. It is ""in-the-box"" but well done. Not a show stopper but if you want to try a domestic version of this classic light bodied beer this will be a nice pick for a hot day."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of moderate intensity, leading to a crisp, slightly fizzy, but pleasant and appropriate mouthfeel. Closes dry, with light stickiness remaining on the palate."

"This is a great pilsner! I really wish we got it out West, as I'd buy a six pack right away with the warming weather. Even two months old, the hops are super lively and the barley is quite tasty and sticky. I hope to continue to see a rise in more beers like this across the country - because at the end of the day, what really does the trick so immediately than a flavorful, zesty, refreshing pilsner? Maybe others indeed, but this one's doing it for me now. Good stuff."
"Troegs never fails to delight. This is a substantial summer beer that made the most of the minimal and simple aspects of a pils and came up with a beer that was feather light on palate. It had plenty of character and was delicate yet firm. Simple and easy to drink. Before you know it you will have had 2 or 3 of these."

"I’m surprised by this, despite how old it was. Fantastic beer. One of my favorite American pilsners."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good example of an American brewed German pils with a decent amount of hoppiness. Easy to drink at 4.5% and good for those who enjoy lagers"
"Overall, this is an excellent summer beer! It is much less hoppy than the Neshaminy Creek Pils that I had last night and I would have to say mild for it's style as well as a bit thin making this an awesome beer for a camping trip if it were in a can! I'm sure it's equally as nice on tap! I recommend this beer and think pretty highly of it! I'm going to score it in the very high 3's or better!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid lager. Good taste, none of the cheap taste of an AAL, and was quite refreshing. Would certainly buy a 6'er or 12'er if I ever find them."
""
"O: Not bad, but not a very impressive pilsener either."

"Clear, bright, yellow pour, with an aggressive pour [into a red Solo cup] yielding a huge fluff of white head that retained well. Light grainy aroma, sweet pils malts. Similar taste, pils malts, fairly sweet, mild hops for a bit of balanced, corny grains. Just really not my thing, but still pretty typical for the style all around. Light body, not very drinkable to me, but if you like the style, then sure, go for it."
"D: overall I am a little disappointed with this brew. I know this has won a gold medal at GABF which typically equates to cream of the crop brews. however, this is just not doing it for me. not only as a German Pils but even as a well-made beer. yeast component too strong, hop character not enough. maybe last years was better..."
""
"Overall, this is a great pilsner. One that I feel keeps up and surpasses many of the top German pils."
""
""
"O: I love German pilsners so it's no surprise that I liked this- The particular spicy herbal hints in this beer was nice."
""
""
""
""
"Brief write-up regarding a fresh batch on-tap. This was everything I had hoped for - a refreshing, easy drinking pilsner with a pleasant earthy/lemony hop profile. No, it won't win awards for complexity or depth, but when you're washing down some delicious ""steamed crab"" chicken wings, I can't think of a better beer for the task. I also think it does an okay job of coming across bigger than it really is, both in mouthfeel and flavor, without ruining its drinkability."

"Pours a pale yellow with a small white head and some lacing. Aroma and Taste of citrus, grains, some biscuit malt, yeast and a bit of peppery spicy hops. Palate is a crisp medium body, with good carbonation. Finish is biscuit malt, yeast, citrus notes with a good amount of peppery spicy hops bitterness, seems a bit on the bitter side. Overall not the best but an ok summertime pils"

"O - Very refreshing and a very solid example of the style. A joy to drink on a warm summer day. Another reviewer mentioned that the taste reminded him of when he was a kid and his father would give him a sip of beer, and I get also get that. A go-to summer beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, tasty flavor profile. Surprising amounts of lemon & citrus add a nice touch. Good balance on the carbonation, medium body adds creaminess. I enjoyed this more than expected; would be happy to session this brew."
""
""
""
"O - Another solid pils from PA. Wish I had gotten it in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a good pilsner; I could see a lot of non-craft beer drinkers enjoying this one. The nose doesn't have a ton going on but the taste is much better, and it is super easy to drink. Could definitely see myself having it again if I was looking for a pislner."

"O-A refreshing beer that grew on me as I drank it but still it didn't seem to bring much to the table."
"O- good pilsner with some sweet light malts and a crisp hop bite.."
"O: a solid beer overall, though I'd like a bit more depth."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good german pils, I would like a little more hop flavor, but this is very true to style. An excellent summer beer. I would be very happy to see this in KY especially because the alcohol level makes it easy to have another one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a highly refreshing and quenching Pilsner. I would love to try this on tap on a hot day."
""
"Overall: I'm a big fan Troegs fan so that I enjoyed Sunshine Pils is of no surprise to me. It's not the best pils brewed in Pennsylvania but is still quite good."
""
""
""
""
"O - Okay example of the style, but I;d tale many of the others from Troegs first."
"Overal this is a solid summer pilsner; great for a hot day. I normally don't like pilsners but this brew has me changing my mind."
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and quite sessionable - the lighter flavors and the low ABV combine to make this one a very nice summer beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 4/16/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big lemon, grass, pepper, bread, apricot, herbal, floral, and yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of big lemon, pepper, light citrus peel, bread, cracker, grass, herbal, floral, and earthy spices. Nice amount of peppery spices on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, grass, bread, pepper, floral, and earthy spices on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish as expected; with some lingering hop flavors. Very pleasantly balanced with a nice amount of hop flavor. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel. No alcohol presence at all other than a light warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice and well made Pilsener. Nicely hopped with good flavor balance; and very easy to drink. Well done."
""
"The beer seems pretty flat, but this does not detract fromit much. It is very clear yellow. This is a nice inclusion in their summer sampler and should not be avoided - this is what a pils can be."
""
"O - Simple, light, definately won't try it again."
""
"O: A nice example of the style from a local brewery. I probably wouldn't get it again, but mostly because pilseners are not my style."
"Awesome balance between malt and hop. Sweet pale malt and buttered potato roll balanced by a spicy hop presence and overall earthiness. Long finish for such a clean pilsner. Slightly tannic with lingering richness and butteryness. Pretty good, and pretty complex for a pilsner."
"Poured a 2"" white head with slightly above average life. The body is a clear straw yellow but from the name I'd been expecting a bright glow and really it looks like any BMC pilsner. It smells of grass and malt. The taste mirrors the smell and is fairly standard pilsner with the exception there's a stronger bitter hops finish. Marginally above the BMCs."
""
"Mouthfeel is great- light body, well carbonated. I like this one a lot- maybe my favorite of the style so far. Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice pilsener. Great flavor and drinkability. While I do think Victory's Prima Pils takes the style to the next level, this is still a good beer worthy of repeated purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Taste; Big burst of hops in the front that finishes crisp and clean with a creamy smooth finish to my palate. A nice pils that would be a solid offering for the summer months."
"Overall: A nice clean hoppy Pilsner."
""
"Simply a good summer beer."
"Overall: A- This is just a solid, easy-drinking, well-balanced pils that I think would appeal to a broad set of palettes. Tough to find anything wrong with it."

"What a fantastic pilsener! Recommended. 4.5"

"O: At $4 a sixer, I should have bought the rest of their stock. While this beer might not be mind-numbing (c'mon - it's a pilsner!) it is just what it needs to be. Buy this beer."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer. It was on sale for $3.99/6 pack and I think it's a steal at that price. Glad I picked some up."
"One of my favorites of the style. Another very good example of an underrated style by Troegs."
"If this is a sunshine brew...glad I'm in Buffalo where the sun don't shine a lot. I won't be tempt to drink this swill. Nice looking bottle...other than that not a lot nice to say. Skunky feel in mouth, lacks body, fair finger of head. I think some workers from the Blatz Brewery are brew masters at Troegs."
"Overall, what I would expect from a decent pilsner. Flavorful to the last drop."
"Overall (4.0): Thank god not all pilsners taste the same. This is a high-drinkability, hop-forward pilsner with a hop profile that feels very American. Website says they used Saaz and Hallertau, but it doesn’t taste very Old World, like Prima Pils does, for example. I got less spicy / herbal and more citrus / floral from the hops, personally. Whatever the case, I enjoyed this very much!"
"Pours hazy straw yellow with a 2 finger head that rings around the top in a thin lace. Smells of pale buttery malts, with lemony citrus zest hops. The taste of biscuity malts, ripe lemons, sour grapes, and lemon Pledge. Light on the feel, smooth, crisp. Overall this tastes as its style suggests, didnt really do too much for me."
"O: Very solid pils all around. Not my favorite style, but it was very drinkable and very tasty."
"O: I could definitely enjoy this beer on a summer/spring day. Another great beer coming out of Troegs."
"It is okay."
"overall impression: the first time I had this beer was a sample at the troegs brewery. it was great then and I still like this beer. not my normal style but a great pilsner and a nice change of pace. something I would not turn down in the future."
"Overall: An outstanding representation of the style. In fact, I'd argue a better representation than the overly-hopped and infinitely popular Prima Pils. Too bad this is just a summer seasonal."
"Thin bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that provides a decent amount of bitterness without overpowering the other flavors. Earthy with hints of grass, straw and pine. This is countered by subtle citrus notes from the hops as well as sme light fruit, especially apple and pear. A bit watered down but still well balanced and easy to drink, especially during these warmer months."
"D: Sort of a lightened version of the Prima. Less complex and way cleaner & lighter malts. Hops are dialed back, but still firmly bitter with lots of character. Far mare approachable than the Prima – a tad more balanced, a less harsh mouthfeel – and way more drinkable for that."
"Overall - a solid, easy-drinking, refreshing pilsner. Nothing pretentious about it. A good summer beer."
"D - Quite enjoyable, nicely priced, and very refreshing. Good take on the German style. If you see it, give it a shot."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue, a bit prickly. A nice summery pils which I continue to enjoy every summer."
"Pours an orangey yellow with a nice cap of white head on top into my Lost Abbey stem. Looks fantastic with its clarity and, in general, looks very inviting. The nose is just a touch of hops, a touch of grain and a touch of sweetness. More out of the nose for the style than what I have had. Nice. The taste is really great. It's like growing up having crappy food (BMC brews) of a certain style then trying some chef's reinvention of it (this). Lightly sweet in the finish, super clean and balanced, this beer goes down crazy easy. This was more balanced (less sweet) than Mama's Little Yella Pils. I could have a 6'er at the beach no problem. Yum. Nice medium light carbonation and a light, but not extremely light body. Give this one a whirl."
"Overall I liked this way more than Prima Pils so I guess when it comes to the style I always like them more when on the sweeter side. A pretty good brew."
"Overall - This and Victory Prima Pils are probably two of the best Pilsners I've had. I really like them both. I think both are fantastic session beers. And I certainly wouldn't mind having easier access to both. Like I said about Prima Pils, this one is a must try in my book! Cheers and thanks yet again trxxpaxxs!!!"
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with high carbonation, a light body and refreshing overall feel. A great session beer that went down fast and easy."
"O: Drinks very easy, a good example of the style. Would be a nice beer to bring to introduce BMC drinkers to what else is out there."
"There are much better pilsners out there."
"A really nice summer seasonal from Troegs. There are alot of great Pilsners that come out of PA, this is certainly among them."
"O- Wasn't impressed. Haven't tasted many pils but this seemed a little light for me."
"Bottled on May 11, 2011. Bright , sunshine yellow with just the slightest haze. Poured into a pilsener glass with a sturdy white foam that left sticky lacings down the glass. Biscuiy malt and floral hop aromas with a hint of lemon. Medium bodied with a smooth, mellow feel. Biscuity malt flavor up front that quickly leads to floral hop flavors that balance nicely with the breadiness. Finishes smooth and clean with some floral hoppy bitterness. Very pleasant and refreshing. If only all pilseners were this good."
"Notes: This Pilsener gets it right. Strongly hopped but not over the top and unpleasant like Prima Pils. This has more character than Stoudt's Pils and is different enough than Brooklyn Pilsener to make it another fine Pilsener to keep around. The bottle says a Crisp, Hoppy Pilsener and I would say it is hoppier than it is Crisp but the Hops taste of the Noble variety and don't wallop you with nastiness. This is a joyful, fun, quaffable Summertime beer."
"Pretty solid pilsner. Not much of a smell to it. Pours a light yellow/straw color. Slight foamy head that lasts throughout, leaving a faint lacing along the glass. Taste is very good -- dry and malty. Nothing spectacular, but went very well with the kilbesa on pretzel bread sandwich I was having."
"Overall – A great beer for the summer. It reminded me a little bit of a toned down prima pils. Almost like a prima pils 'light'. It's very easy to drink and it has a very refreshing tasting. It's definitely worth a try if you happen to see it on the shelves."
"O: Meh, not one of Troegs' best IMHO. With Prima Pils sitting right next to it on the shelf, I don't see myself buying this again anytime soon."
"nicely done"
"Very good beer."
"Crisp bitter that becomes a bit coarse mid-palate, lasting until a hint of sweet malt fades in at the end, leaving a lingering sense of purpose and pleasure. Or maybe I've been in the Sunshine a bit too long."
"O -I really enjoyed this one. I would put Prima Pils a little higher, but I would definitely get this again."
"O: A great summertime brew, hence the name. I don't drink many lagers but I enjoy this one. It is very refreshing and light but with plenty of flavor."
"Very flavorful pils here...heavy on the grains and malts, but also perhaps hoppier than most. I definitely enjoyed it....maybe not the best I've had, but it's solid."
"O- A nice beer, I would like it better if it was a little more hop flavor and a little less sweet malts."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. The flavors are complex and well balanced. This is a very refreshing warm weather beer."
"Overall a great summer-beer. Nothing too fancy; nice, light, refreshing, well-balanced, and easy-drinking."
" This beer is one that even my miller lite drinking buddies enjoy. Its got good flavor while not being offensive or overpowering."
"This is one of my favorite warm weather beers with character, if not my favorite. The hop character of this beer is excellent. It is highly drinkable. Victory Prima Pils definitely has more hop character but can be over powering after a few. Sunshine Pils is a lighter version of Prima Pils, perfect for late spring or summer night. I remember having this for the first time at a local beach themed bar on a hot summer of night, I fell in love instantly after the first sip."
"Wow, this is a really good beer. I started out drinking it too cold, so the bitterness was a bit harsh, but as it warmed the flavors really started to mesh."
"D - Nice american grain pils and easy to palate. Refreshing on a summer afternoon."
"Sessionable, refreshing, wasn't expecting to like it... but I might want some more now."
"This beer is off the charts when it comes to drinkability; it just hits the spot. I would say that this beer is a great starting point for someone who is learning about craft beer or if you are trying to ween a friend off Budweiser or Miller Lite. It is light in body, full of flavor, and pairs with just about every kind of food out there, making this a great beer for anyone. On a hot day like today, this is just what I needed to quench my thirst. If you come across this beer I'd say you better not pass it by, especially since it's just starting to heat up outside."
"Overall, a pretty good pilsner, interesting enough to keep a hophead engaged and true enough to the pilsner to engage those folks."
"D: Quite high, though I don't care for this much."
"This is what a lager/pilsner beer should taste like.... very clean, crisp taste.... the hops are pleasantly sharp... compared to prima pils it is cleaner and more direct to the point of a good lager where prima wanders in it's flavor towards maltiness.... Sunshine Pils stays with the crisp hoppiness and it's perfect for summer"
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a one finger white head. Solid lacing throughout. Aroma of grass, a bit of wheat and lemon and pine. Very light crisp flavor profile. Grassy taste, a bit of wheat, hint of lemon zest followed by a bit of cracked pepper and pine. Again, very light, but works well together."
"An excellent example of a German pils."
"D/O- Woo woo! This is a great summer beer for sure. Its pretty hot and muggy today in northern Illinois so this hit the spot. A sixer of this and I'd be happy. Well done Troegs."
"Overall: Fantastic summer beer. Hunt it down. And if you don't like pilsners now, this is one that will probably change your mind. A great thirst quencher and just an all around good brew, better than some of the American pilsners I've tried."
"Overall, its good. Not the biggest fan of the style, but a great one to try on my obscure beer quest"
"Overall: Another winner from Troegs. This was the last of the seasonals I have tried from them and now I can say that they officially have my favorite seasonal lineup from any brewery. The numbers may seem a little high but reviewing to style and comparing to other Pilseners, this is far and away my current favorite."
"O: To be honest, I was a bit disappointed considering the quality of most of Troegs other beers. However, a second rate beer from this fine brewery is still better than many other A-game attempts."
"O: I love this seasonal pilsner, its full of flavor and has a good body."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a great pils, nice malts, light and nice hop addition, crisp and clean, great summer beer."
"a hard style that is troublesome for americans. With there is no distinction of this being a pilsner and a well filtered ale. Nose is a tad more lime than most. A grain earth... Palate a plateau. Grain and some hop. Its doesn't fall off dry. It doesn't have any malt complexity. The base notes are there but little interaction."
"M/O: Very clean. Light body, lots of carbonation. The motto on the side of the bottle says it best, ""crisp, hoppy pilsner"". Pilsners aren't my favorite beers, but this one is definitely better than most. I need to pick up some prima pils soon and compare the two."
"Certainly above average for the style, but not one I'd probably go out of my way to find unless I was really into pilsners."
"O- not my favorite style of beer but would be refreshing after working on a hot day. Good summer brew"
"D - Very drinkable beer for the summer time. Low alcohol and not filling at all. Definitely a great choice for the warmer months."
"This is pretty good for style, but I think I'd go for Prima Pils over this for it's Pennsylvania brother connection. However, if melon is your bag this is your summer melon beer right here."
"Thanks to the dr for sending this my way!"
"D= Quite a delicious and drinkable pilsner. I could easily kill a six pack of this on a hot day."
"A good pilsener from Troegs and has all the makings of a good sessions beer. Perfect for a nice hot sunny day."
"D/O: Crisp and drinkable with some interesting spice and great beer to have for summer."
"O - Average beer, got 3 this in a mixed 12, and that will be a good amount for me."
"overall a very good, clean german style pilsener. i was wary of this one in the mixed 12, but it's troegs, i should have known it would be good."
"This could be snuck in with some of the better American macros without much differences noticed, surprised how un-hoppy this was coming from Troegs. It would make a good session beer, but I'd probably pick Prima Pils over this."
"Notes: One of the best American-brewed pilsners. Very tasty and refreshing, damn near perfect. Great drinking in the warmer weather."
"Overall a very well done German Pilsner from Troegs"
"Overall, very well done great balance of malt sweetness, hop aroma and flavor and crisp mouthfeel."
"The feel of this beer is light but has a good feel like it might be bigger then you think but drinks like a lawn mower beer. Something you would have during the summer. It goes down easy and is really drinkable."
"pours a light golden color with solid white head. head quickly disappears leaving a film on top. the smell is clean pale malt. taste is very clean, refreshing. very similar to an american wheat, but cleaner and with a hint of lemon. mouthfeel is light. I'm not a big pilsner fan, but this beer is just damn good and overcomes any ill feelings I have toward the style. Nice warm weather brew."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've always liked this beer, but I ever only buy a couple of singles each spring/summer. It's just not as good as Prima, Stoudt's or even Noble Pils. That being said, I enjoy drinking it when I do."
" The bold hoppy esthers are what must intimidate some people. If you like Nugget Nectar or any of the powerful Hoppy California beers,you'll definitely like this one."
"I love German and Czech Pilsners, one of my favorite styles of beer. This one is way too bitter, minimal notice of flavoring in the noble hops and has a long lasting aftertaste of negative flavors. Also has some hints of barley and wheat flavorings similar to Adjuncts. In fact there are probably 10+ macro pilsner/lagers that I would rather drink than this offbalanced mess of a beer. Sorry to be so harsh to Troegs (which I really like some of their other options) but I need shoot straight from the hip and think they need to go back and rework there attempt at a Pilsner."
"If you look over any other reviews I've done you'll see I really don;t like Pilsners. This brew falls into that same category. I really found this beer to be incredibly light on flavor and mouthfeel. The only flavor I got was the gross fresh cut grass flavor that I really can't stand. For me this beer is not good. If you're into these styles you'd more than likely enjoy this one as well."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very refreshing and easily drinkable. Sort of a plain pilsner. Good hop quality but just slightly bland for my tastes. It was a good beer, but there many other better Pilsners in my opinion."
"D - Not bad. I do enjoy this time of year when the sunshine comes out. The only drawback to this beer is the over the top chewy feel. It really prevents me from having more than one or two of these at a time. Still solid tho."
"OVERALL: A solid, dry, hoppy beer that leans toward the bitter end of the pilsner spectrum. Definitely refreshing, but three would be too many."
"The beer pours a pale straw color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pilsner malt scent along with a dry, German hop aroma. It's crisp and clean with touch of graininess. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor. It's goes down easy with a mild hop flavor in the finish. It's a simple, easy drinking beer with little to no imperfections. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a solid pilsner. It's true to style and well brewed."
"D: Good, but far from amazing."
"Drinkability: I would choose this one if i could but it is not distributed in Utah. A very approachable beer, could use this one as a gateway beer for BMC drinkers."
"Poured from the bottle into my Troegs pint. Light orange gold straw color and one finger head. Smell and taste was slightly sweet and spritzy with a nice hoppy hit. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both nice and easily sessionable. A solid choice for me."
"D- Very easy to drink. Slight citrus tones. Very good pilsner style."
"D- Very easy to drink this beer. If anybody asks for something similar to BMC but with more flavor, this is it, suggest it."
"High drinkability. This is a very nice, refreshing, and tasty pils."
"D - Pretty easy drinking warmweather brew. Clean, crisp, no off flavours and decently tasty."
"While not my favorite Pils this is another very nice example of a fine Americans brewed Pilsener."
"The taste brings a nice amount of bitterness as well as some herbal and floral notes. Light grain fills out the light body, which has some nice carbonation. A really nice, drinkable summer brew."
"Transparent golden in body with white head on top. Aroma of grains, hops, dew and some floral notes. Flavors of hops, slight wet leaves, floral notes, some flittering honey notes, and some nice dryness towards the finish. Crisp and refreshingly light in body and carbonation."
"Served in a frosted glass at the Nantucket Lobster Trap restaurant this summery specialty shows a very clear, pale straw gold color with a healthy white crop of head and plenty of lacing foretelling a good quality brew. The aroma is skunky cereal wheat and rice, much to my liking for pilsners, deep in doughy bread sourness. The flavor speaks of fairly creamy citrus rice and light rye wheat. This pleasant taste suits me. It's got the kind of crisp refreshment you look forward to but it feels pretty chewy for a pilsner, creamy with relatively subtle, ""tiny"" carbonation. Unusually smooth without sacrificing too much of the refreshing quality you expect from a pilsner. Very edible and equally drinkable. Great with food and flavorful on its own merits. A highly satisfying pilsner."
"I had a sixteen ounce glass of this because one of my favorite bartenders at one of my favorite bars said this was a good beer and she really seemed to mean it. I also liked this beer but would not put it in my list of great german pilsners. A little on the smooth side to be considered a german pilsner and not quite bright enough but a very good summer drinker which, if it gets hot again, i'll have a few pints of."
"Drinkabilty - This is the kind of beer people should be drinking at bbq's and at ball parks, not budweiser or miller. Easy to drink, would go great with burger, hot dog etc. Packs a lot of flavor for being a messily 4.5%. Good stuff here"
"Drinkable and enjoyable but nothing special."
"Atrociously light bodied and a forced smooth drinking leaves me wanting to take no more sips. A pilsner even weaker by trying to pretend to have some honey sweetness. At 5.3 abv, this is not worth it. Avoid."
"Part of the sampler pack I picked up and the brews are about 5 months old. I know I will get killed for this but this beer is not as good as SA Noble Pils, not even close."
"A beauty in the making. Perfect for a crisp autumn day or a hot summer day. Right now, the current weather is toward the latter. I enjoyed this and when this style is done right, it is hard to beat."
"D-the grain really drives the flavors here and the hop presence is mild at best and the finish is a little watery in terms of flavor. it is still tasty, just has some issues."
"Cheers..."
"The beer poured a very nice light crystal lemon color with a 1/2"" head then it lay down to a nice lace around the glass. The smell is very crisp with a hint lemon and crisp hops. The taste is light lemon flavor with a hint of light hop on the back of the tongue. Very refreshing and has great mouth feel and very drinkable."
"Very easy on the drinkability scale. A definite summer thirst quencher. Not Prima Pils but a better than average offering. Bought on sale at 4.99 a six...that's a real deal."
"This very light neon yellow brew gives about 1/2"" of white head that settles quickly to a thin layer and leaves small traces of lace on the glass. Smell is faint skunk and malt, pleasant but pretty thin. Taste is a nice mix of faint skunk, a moderate amount of light malts, some nice florals and a light mixed hop. Finishes with a bit of resiny hop that lingers for longer than expected. Mouthfeel is fresh crisp and smooth. Very tasty and goes down easily."
"For a light, Summer beer, this one was o.k. Light, drinkable, a good session beer."
"Bottle: Poured a golden yellow color pils with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light floral hops with crisp hops is pleasant. Taste is also dominated by light floral malt with balanced sweetness and crisp dry hops. No adjunct could be detected which is nice but additional presence of Noble hops would have been even better. Well brewed and very refreshing."
"I liked it, well done."
"Poured into a hefe glass. Color was a very light straw color with a brilliant white froathy head that lasted for several minutes. Copious amounts of bubbles rose from the bottom. Aroma was very hoppy with hints of vanilla and pepper. Taste was a bit hoppy at first, but mellowed out nicely to what was almost sweet. Very thin in the mouth. Coated ok at first, but didn't follow through, so by the end your mouth was almost dry. Very strange feeling. Despite that, I kept wanting to drink more."
"A drinkable pilsner has a pleant taste going down though quickly gets bitter very fast. This pilsner alot of carbanation. Smell is also bitter. The bitterness kind of hurts the drinkabilty after awhile though so you probably wouldn't want to drink too many of them"
"It's crisp and refreshing. The abv is appropriately low. The hops just seem to be slightly out-of-balance to me. Just a touch too much bitter bite."
"D - I could drink this one all day. One of my favorite pilsners and another reason to look forward to the summer!"
"The body had a nice scrubbing carbonation. Medium in density and very drinkable. I wish I had access to this one regularly."
"D- this is the perfect light summer brew that is meant to be enjoyed in the heat. The balance of the brew makes it so tasteful. Troegs is fantastic with making seasonal brews!"
"Drinkability - German Pilsner is one of my favorite styles of beer. This one has a beautiful look to it, but pretty much the other aspect of it left me wanting. Not a bad beer and certainly drinkable, but not earth-moving for me."
"Served to me with a small bone white head. Pale gold in color with good clarity. Smells fresh with just a kiss of grassy hops and a little grainy husk smell. Taste is clean and mild. More balanced than than most but still has some good hop flavor. Mouthfeel is fluid and lively and is only slightly dry on the finish. Very drinkable, especially on a hot summer afternoon. Overall, a decent pils that is an easy drinker."
"This is a solid interpretation of the style. Very European. Grainy, with strong herbal and citrusy hops all the way down - just so you know there's an American behind it. Floral nose and almost hits on the taste. Nicely carbonated. But its two dimensional and doesnt really do anything to keep my palate interested. Rather go for Victory."
"This was a pretty decent beer, very easy to drink a few. Pretty good flavor, also quite refreshing."
"D - It does everything well without really breaking away from the style at all. It doesn't have the depth of complexity of Prima Pils, but it's fresh and locally available."
"Drinks: like precedent. Sunshine Pils hits all the marks a standard pilsner should: nice golden color, light and palatable flavors, great for a hot summer day. But Troegs definitely isn't pushing any boundaries with this one. It's typical, and therefore forgettable."
"D - Overall fairly drinkable after the initial few gulps. It could be smoother but I guess it should have that initial coarseness."
"I got this one as an extra in a recent trade from a very generous BA. Poured this into a pint glass. Pours a good clean clear yellow with about an inch of big fluffy white head. Lots of visible carbonation and great head retention. Interesting nose on this one. Typical pilsner smell with hints of lemon, grass and floral notes. Slight scent of grassy hops. Right away I get a bit of lemon flavor. This is really crisp. Pilsner malts follow shortly after with a good hop finish. This actually kind of has a bit of a sour forefront to me. I'm absolutely loving the lemon flavor. This has really nice carbonation and the body is really light and refreshing. I could really kick the crap out of summer heat with this highly drinkable beer."
"D: Drinkability is just a nod above average for me. I can appreciate a good pilsner, no doubt, but I'd rather be enamored with a great one."
"D - Very crisp and refreshing, nice hop presence without overdoing it, excellent not just for summer but year round (if it were made year round) with a very reasonable ABV."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and refreshing; the mild bitterness opens up your taste buds and palate so this is an excellent beer to start with."
"Brew is very drinkable, very sessionable. A crisp nice summer brew."
"This is a highly sessionable brew. Goes down very easy and would be welcome on a nice hot summer day by the pool - sort of like today."
"D: Given how light this beer is, in both body and flavor, this one is easy drinking. Not sure it measures up with the best pils out there, but its not a bad beer."
"goes down well. nothing hinders the drinkability, but I will probably forget that I had this beer as soon as I finish it. My least favorite Troegs beer so far, but to be fair, its a style I don't particularly enjoy."
"Overall, this beer just wasn't for me. I can appreciate a fine pils but this one just didn't do it for me. It will be hard for me to finish my bottle."
"Another reviewer hailed this as a great lawnmower beer, and I couldn't agree more. Ergo, I'd drink this like the dickens during the summer, but probably wouldn't make for a good cold-weather komfortbrau."
"From a Troegs mixed case and poured from a bottle into a Harpoon pint glass. Bright golden color with a very understated aroma. Nice balance between malts and pilsner hops. Very crisp, pleasant taste with a nice amount of carbonation. Extremely drinkable, as I could drink this beer all night."
"D- Drinkability is through the roof, a real lawnmower beer, you can actually hydrate from it, and it shines when chugged."
"A very easy drinker. Quite tasty."
"Poured from bottle. Hopefully I didn't get a bad batch, because this beer was underwhelming. I suppose it matches the style, and it's a good beer for a hot day. But the crispness of the hops was a bit too much for me, and I barely got the other taste hints. What I did get was a little bit of citrus, but it wasn't very helpful to the taste. So basically a sharp, bitter beer, but not in a good way, and I found it too tasteless. I could certainly find better in this style for the price."
"Not bad but not my favorite lager that I've had."
"Man, the bottle I picked up looks so much better than the one listed above. Sucks to be you, obviously. This guy pours a sallow color so clear Windex probably wants to contact Troegs for pointers. Seriously. This is capped by a tall, thick forest of white froth, which leaves some decent lacing behind as a death rattle. The smell is characteristically light, with notes of light lemon, wheat, and some hoppy citrus/florals. The taste is mostly a watery mixture of floral hoppy bitters, though some wheat-y citrus lies buried in the brewer's sands of time (industry secret, yo). The body is quite light, with a light carbonation and a refreshing finish. I could see drinking this after laboring beneath a ravaging sun (though I wouldn't know: my domain is currently chilled by a perpetually-running air-conditioner) and being rather refreshed. I think it's time we ditched that worthless, bland water shit...what's it good fer, anyway?"
"Notes: Again, this does not do much to me. These lagers are certainly not my thing. It feels like a fair brew, probably better under scorching weather, which is where it looks like it is in part marketed to. Sometimes I like to have a good pilsner around in addition to some pale ales to offer them as entry points to craft beers, and this is a good addition to that line up."
"SUPER refreshing. Considerably more lemony then recent pilsners I've had. Another big hitter in the land of Pilsners..."
"This goes down easy, even though there are other pilsners I'd reach for. B."
"Hoppy, but not enough to push it past other good German pils into being uniquely American. In other words, doesn't hold a candle to Prima."
"I can see where the crystal malt comes in as it does have a sweet side to it. Hops contribute a zesty and grassy flavor but lean more towards a bittering finish. I get some minerality at the end too. Not too much to complain about, but I could use a bit of a bump in body and more hop flavor. A more than solid pilsner and PA residents are lucky to have so many good ones readily at hand."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is earthy hops with pilsner malt. The flavor is pilsner malt as well as earthy and spicy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The beer is very drinkable."
"Thanks Adam!"
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is above average, which fits the style pretty well. Drinkability is good, it's a very well made pilsner style beer. The Noble hops gave it some nice earthy hop spiciness to it that I liked. Great summer, lighter style beer. In relation to others in the style I think this one does pretty well."
"D - a decent German Pils, made drinkable by being on the lighter side in both flavor and body. not my favorite but gets the job done - good hot weather beer."
"D- Easily drinkable, but not that much complexity going on in this beer which would make me second guess on whether or not to have another."
"Acuired as a trade extra. Liked it for the style. Just finnished the lawn and couldn't think of a better beer for 90 degree weather. I hate to say this but there are many other beers out there which could perform the same or better. This I would keep on hand for lake or river days."
"Cheers!"
"pours a transparent golden yellow with a bit of a sparkle to it and soft carbonation. spare to no head lacing was the same all but non existent. slight citrus hop smell with some hints of lemon. light malty straw like flavor. light body and texture. light bitter metallic like finish and short flavor duration. o.k. beer, probably wouldn't drink again. first troegs beer i've had that i didn't love."
"I could definitely polish off a few of these. However, on a hot day I was looking for a little more. If anything I would enjoy this beer more late winter/ early spring. That being said, it is certainly not a bad offering but my least favorite from Troegs so far."
"D- The lack of hops makes this quite drinkable. This is a fantastic beer to have at a ballgame."
"Beer is thin and has a slight aftertaste of grains. Its a little bitter in the back and I wasn't expecting it. Overall its light and simple."
"Not all that bad, but not on par with the plis elite. No need to return."
"Drinkablility: Nice summer sipper. Great ""lawnmower beer"" but it has the umph to stand up to most white meat dishes."
"Overall impression- This is a great version of a style that I don't really care for. As such, it deserves a B+/A-, but this will remain a beer that I don't want to really have again."
"Drinks like a light beer packed with flavor. Could drink this like Miller Lite but actually enjoy it. Great Summer brew."
"On tap in the Troegs sample room it pours a crystal clear light yellow color with a white head that displays minimal retension and a little bit of lace clings upon the glass. Nose is slight piney hops with a note of sulfur twang. Taste is bitter upfront from the pine-like hops with some notes of sulfur clashing with the slight malty character. Finishes relatively clean and crisp, slightly bitter. Light feel with minor carbonation."
"I like. I will be seeking a full case of this for summer season sipping."
"Very nice beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is of malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, some hops, a bit sour. Not a whole lot going on here. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a very mediocre offering."
"D- Refreshing drinker that I would love to get my hands on more of. Pleasant surprise from the boys at Troegs"
"Poured a fairly transparent gold into a pilsner glass, with obvious quantities of carbonation, two fingers of bright white head, and great lacing. The smell was certainly Noble hops-ish, with floral notes, grass, hay, and dry bitterness. The flavor certainly echoed the nose, with herbal hints throughout, and a nice crisp dry finish. Nicely carbonated, light mouthfeel. A great session pilsner. Well done."
"Overall impression: Goes down nice and easy. An enjoyable brew."
"Commenting: I've not had too many Pilsners, but i tend to think of them being light in every aspect; flavor, feel, aroma. That being said, this beer was quite enjoyable. Light, crisp, refreshing, yet full and hoppy. Definitely a summer beer and I'll certainly remember it come June."
"Pours a clear golden with a silky white head. Nice lacing and retention. Nose has grassy malts, light hops and some citrus. Taste has pale malts followed by crisp herbal hops. Light body is well carbonated. Nice pilsner from Troegs. Great beer drink outside on a hot summer say."
"This was a great surprise coming from a mixed six pack. If I were able to get troegs in CT, I would pick up more. This is on the same level of greatness as Prima Pils, which I've decided is the American Pils to judge all others against. I wonder how much better this bottle would be if it was fresh."
"This is a very drinkable beer and goes down very quickly. I could drink 2 or 3 of these while playing a game of horse shoes while enjoying a cookout."
"Very drinkable, especially in warm weather..."
"D: Quite a good beer. There are a few I like more in the style for their crisper, sharper flavors, but this is a solid offering."
"D - Very high. Great beer for the summer. Wish I still lived in Harrisburg - this makes me a little nostalgic, although not as much so as Troegenator, one of my childhood beers of choice, does."
"This is a very refreshing Pils that's good on a hot day."
"Overall a good representation of the style."
"D-Good beer. Would be a nice beer with food like shellfish. I might have liked a little more of an assertive malt profile for this. Not as bready as the style should be."
"D- This is another great Pa. Pilsener. Great summer beer, refreshing and tasty."
"Overall an excellent and very to style pilsner. This is up there with the better german exports, and certainly one of the best american examples ive had. A fine beer. Highly recommended for those pilsner requiring times."
"D- easy drinking summer pilsner, slight hops, crisp finish. Enjoy several on a hot summer day and admire the lacing on your glass."
"This beer poured a clear golden color, a one finger of solid white head, retains alright leaving some wispy lacing on the glass. Nose is quite bready with some spicy, pepperish hops and a touch of citrus hops, nice malt presence. Taste starts with citrusy hops in the forfront, grapefruit and lemon is most detectable, lending in to a bready taste and a slight bite in the finish spice comes through here. Lighter side of medium body, low carbonation, clean dry finish to it. This is a nice pilsner that one can sit with for a while."
"Notes: This is a great refreshing beer with excellent Pilsner Flavor."
"Very flavorful and perfect for the hot summer months. There is nothing distinct about this pilsner interpretation but it is faithful to the style."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a small head. The aroma is of citrus hops with barely, not overall complex but more than you usually get for a pilsner. Taste is again like the smell there is some citrus hops and some barely present, again it is more complex than most pilsners. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. The drinkability is abover average on this, for the style it is solid and it does have some complexity. You could drink a lot of these, it is very smooth and flavorful."
"D High as is the intention I believe."
"Overall: Mission accomplished here--a summer deck companion for lighter cigars, party food, more beer and friends--tonight I've got all but the friends, and it still works..."
"D: A great summer quencher, but not a lot of character beyond thirst quenching. A nice pairing for fish and lighter summer fare, so in that regard, it's a good enough brew."
" tastes."
"Great one for a hot summer day."
"single from Westover Market, Arlington, VA...bottled 06/01/09"
"D: Not the best german pils, but its right there as the most refreshing pils."
"Vegetal and fruity; the malts and decent hop character balance well together to provide a crisp, easy-drinking pilsner which is a step above the rest."
"Tröegs Sunshine Pils is a clear, pale golden beer with a nice, elastic white head that has great retention and lacing. It has a fruity, grassy aroma with perhaps a note of pine. It has a smooth medium body with a gritty, caustic finish. It tastes nice and bitter with fruit and wood flavors. It demands attention. It leaves you thirsty, but it tastes nice."
"D: A top-notch pils that puts a nice body and strong but not overdone hopping to offer up one of the finest on-tap pilsner. In the bottle, it's Victory Prima Pils for me. But on-tap Troegs Sunshine outshines PP but maintaining firm but even hopping to give a more balanced, fulfilling flavor."
"Very crisp and refreshing. Dry, but not bone dry, finish. The body seems to have slightly more heft than I'm used to in a pilsener, which, again, is more to my liking. Very, very easy drinker. Very tasty pils."
"What another great looking beer from the Troegs brother's!! I am impartial to German Pilsners, but this one is another outstanding crafted brew by Troegs. It pours a rich cream head and your glass may need to be cleaned after drinking this brew. Nice scents of a bit of pine and toasty german malts. Easy to drink and quite hoppy for a pils. I will be getting this one again real soon."
"As stated before I think this is a very solid pils; an easy drinker that I gladly keep around during the summer."
"Drinkability is good. I could drink quite a few of these over the summer and its one of the best ""summer"" brews I've tried yet."
"This tasted more like a slightly better version of macro brewery pilsner. I'm suprised a beer like this came from this Troegs."
"I could throw this down all day, really very well done and a fantastic version of the style. Another winner here."
"needs more malt, less of that sulfurous character."
"Drinkability - Very sessionable. This is a great beer for relaxing outside with during the summer."
"d: PA is supposed to be a great state for pilsners. I'm just now begininning to appreciate that fact. Good stuff from Troegs."
"this is one easy drinking pilsner! not too much of anything, a perfect blend overall. light and simple so this is beyond sessionable. a perfect summer beer."
"Grab a case of these with one case each of Victory's Prima Pils, Sly Fox's Pikeland Pils and Stoudt's Pils and your German summer of drinking is set."
"A great pilsner, right behind Prima. Malt flavor lacks a little i feel, but the hops are very powerful, spicy and work great here. A fantastic pils."
"Great German pils. Great beer."
"D - A refreshing lager-excellent pils which was complimentary to the battered jalapeno and shrimp scampi appetizer. The spiciness was tasty with nice drinkability cutting the grease and refreshing the palate"
"Light body with a good amount of carbonation. Very little trace of alcohol. Very easy to drink, and refreshing in the heat."
"Like I said, a real nice summer beer."
"In all honesty, I don't think that pilseners get the respect that they deserve nowadays. Since I also drink alot of wine as well as beer, I feel pretty confident that I can compare pilseners to rieslings...because they are so simple and basic, they are often looked over, and I am as guilty as anyone. Sometimes it's nice to have a beer that isn't so complex that you need two pieces of paper to write down all the different tasting notes that it contains. In a world of imperial this and double that, it's nice to know that I can always crack open a pilsener to remind of how simple life can really be..."
"Not having had too many craft pilsner beers, I was pleasantly surprised at how complex this beer was, especially the smell. That said I don't think it is completely my cup of tea, though I'm looking forward to trying other good examples of the style."
"D: Really good mild/non-intense flavor and easy to take down."
"d- very drinkable, perfect for a nice hot day, easy to session, impressively tasty."
"D) A nice light and refreshing beer for warm weather days, but not a standout in terms of flavor and taste."
"Calling this a fine session beer would be a bit of an understatement. I don't know if I'd rank this as high as Victory's Prima Pils, but it's certainly up there with Brooklyn's pils and better than the mainstream imports."
"D - A terrific German Pilsner in all categories, except mouthfeel... The complete absence of carbonation seriously degrades an other wise excellent brew... Great appearance along with a good nose and taste are unjustly lost as a result..."
" D: Very very drinkable this may be my go to beer this summer well at least the next cupple of weeks."
"Drinkability: An excellent summertime beer. Perfect for relaxing on a warm night, or quenching your thirst after doing some yard work. Very drinkable."
"Sunshine Pilsner from Troegs is my top rated pilsner. I only drink pilsners in the summer and this is my go to followed a close second by Prima."
"D: Very enjoyable beer. I was craving a pilsner last week so I grabbed a six pack. Very nice warm weather beer."
"Bottle. Pours a clear light yellow with a small white head. Aroma of wheat, pale lager malts, and sweet light fruits. Flavor is quite similar, sweet and fruity upfront with a malty/bready finish. A little boring, just a basic pilsener lacking in originality. On the other hand, for a pils, it gets the job done!"
"D - Delicious, light and easy-drinking. Great summer seasonal; fairly thirst-quenching. ABV is probably borderline high for a session beer, but I could definitely see having more than one of these in a session."
"Picked up a six pack of this, figuring it its from Troegs it should be quite good. Now this style is not a favorite of mine, but I feel what Troegs has done here is very good. Poured to a nice golden color with a good-sized white head that stuck around for a good while leaving some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma, at least to me, seems to be a little more in the face than other Pils that I have tried. Lemony hops are there and I notice that first but then the Saaz hop spice aroma. Slight grain aroma there, seems sweet, but it goes well with the hops I am picking up. The flavors are also quite refreshing with a sweet malty flavor taking my first notice. Hops break in and seem to add more of a lemon zest that sticks around in your mouth. Nice brew, not a favorite style but based on what I have had in the past this is very good. Very easy drinking brew, would be a great brew to enjoy on the deck during the summer."
"Light body, smooth, good carbonation finishes dry and has good drinkability. This would be a very good summer beer."
"There beer is moderately carbonated, light bodied, refreshing, quite dry, a touch lemon tartness, but then we get to that spicy hop bite. This is made from Saaz hops for sure and there is that graininess you would come to expect. The spicy bite is just too much for this beer and is a bit of a turn off. The beer is not bad but not my favorite pils."
"Sunshine Pilsner along with Victory Prima Pils and Sly Fox Pikeland Pils are 3 staples in my fridge over the summer months...gotta love living so close to some great PA breweries"
"Drinkability: This is perfectly refreshing summer beer. Between this and Oskar Blues, I am becoming more of a fan of this style. A little bitter as a pils, but it also does not taste like a run of the mill pilsner. I could easily session this."
"D: This beer was made to be enjoyed in the hot summer sun by the gallon."
"A refreshing beer, easy to drink and a lite mouthfeel. Compared to other pils, there is a bitterness from hops that is very present, but not very appealing or tasty. A fair representative of its style, but not the best. Prima Pils gets the nod here."
"Lots of carbonation, prickly. Light to medium body. A nice pils."
"Served in a pint glass. Poured a bright, golden yellow, crystal clear. Veeeery little head, if any at all. Smells pilsener-esque, but no distinct fruit or hop aroma. Light mouthfeel... Super light mouthfeel actually. Watery, reeeally watery. A little bitterness in the finish, but no real flavor... maybe some barely there hops. Refreshing, but doesn't taste like anything. Bummer."
"Drinkability: Really high - this is a great summer beer that's tasty without being heavy."
"For such a light bodied and light colored beer, this one sure delivers the goods. Great flavor, nice and crisp, and highly drinkable. I would say this and Victory Prima Pils are the two best Pils I have had. Highly recommended."
"Great mouth and drinkability, like any pils is."
"D - At 5.3 it is very drinkable."
"I've been on a pilsner binge recently so I thought I'd give this one a try. Cheap for a six pack but they are local. Very clear light gold, almost no head or lacing. Sweet almost fruity aroma. Definite citrus or lemony taste. Very light and summery. Now if only the weather would improve I could definitely enjoy this one out on the porch."
"3.5 D: Good stuff except for the appearance."
"Overall, a very good pilsner. $10 for a six-pack is a little on the steep side though."
"HV"
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing and drinkable beer, each sip followed easily from the last and I could drink them all night or for several nights in a row."
"I poured the beer into a pilsener glass with a very small head, small enough it need not mention. The body is golden and clear. The aroma smells of light hops. I took a swig of the beer and it tasted just as a pilsener should; however, it didn't overly impress me with its hoppy complexion. The beer was enjoyable to drink; however, I found myself not really wanting more. Maybe it was my mood, not sure, but I am more of a fan of Troegs' Nugget Nectar and Double Bock."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop in West Hazleton for $1.75. Poured into my Tröegs shaker ""pint"" glass and appears a crystal clear bright yellow color with two fingers of pure white foam. The head leaves no lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of grassy hops, a generous dose of lemon, earthy, bready yeast. Ultra crisp and quaff able. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. A great warm weather pilsner."
"I love pilsners and found another to add to my list of possibilities. Now I have to decide between prima, slyfox, and sunshine every time I'm thirsty for a pils."
"Overall, I'm not impressed. I noted that based on some other reviews I've read I may have had a bad bottle, but the beer appeared to be fine and didn't taste skunked. Pilseners are supposed to be richly hopped and flavorful...I don't think Troegs is doing the style justice if my sample was an accurate one."
"D - Easy drinker. But the aftertaste isn't exactly pleasant. Does however make you go back for more."
"D- pretty high. This would be on regular rotation, for me, if it was a year-round beer. Generally American Pils are not especially impressive, and with a case of Stoudt's in the fridge, this had a hard task in front of it, but it is a very good beer, one of the best I've had from Troegs."
"A definite must have in the fridge now."
"I guess there is something I am missing from this style. maybe i needto go to germany or the czech republic."
"Another great SEPA pilsner....up there with Prima and Sly Fox! Less hoppy than I expected, but a great brew. Excellent for warm weather."
"D- Easy to drink, but a mediocre flavor."
"Good drinkable beer."
"D - The drinkability is here on this one...this was great to have on a sunny 85* day...and besides you can't go wrong with Troegs"
"Good hop presence in the taste; some raw grain. Not as crisp as some--full body with above average amount of carbonation. The aftertaste has an element of lactose, but it's mostly hop bitterness."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 04/01/09. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with about a half inch white head. Lacing is average. It smells like bready malt, grain, light hops and some lemon zest. Taste is the same as the aroma, but it starts off a bit malty and finishes a bit hoppy. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a decent enough beer, but there's other pilsners out there that I like better. However, I would drink this again in the future."
"Future outlook: Not real interesting or popping on the flavor end. Decent, but easily the weakest offering I've had from Tröegs to date. Probably won't seek out again soon."
"D- I would prefer this a touch colder than I have it served right now but out side of that its very clean and refreshing. I think the only beer in this style that I like better so far is Prima Pils."
"This is very refreshing, and as a summer seasonal, it's a great brew."
"pours a very light crystal clear yellow, quickly fading small white head with a quickly fading lace. then things start to get better. nice garden herbal nose and i seem to get a hint of mint in the nose as well. grainy malt hoppy taste, nicely balanced full body and well carbonated. easy to drink with good taste and body to it. another good beer from troegs brewing."
"this is a great beer for summer. easy to drink, and i've had plenty of it before. maybe it's time to look for a sixel of this guy..."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, easy to drink, tastes good"
"I am revising this post because I have had this more recently and have not been nearly as impressed. It was better last year, this year it has a metallic taste. It's not bad, but not nearly as good as it resides in my memories of years past."
"Tastes lemon zesty, smooth, surprisingly full bodied, carbonation at a nice level. Get some hop bitterness on the finish, but overall this remains a pleasant easy drinker, and likely going to become a go to for when I have people over. Might be nice to get a case of this to divert people from my cellar."
"Basically, when a beer is called ""sunshine pils," this is exactly what ought to be expected: zesty citrus and earthy floral flavors with a strong hops back. Let's not forget that the label touts this beer as being hoppy. It is everything it claims. Just barely a step below Victory Prima, and a stellar example of its style. What are people expecting?"
"Save it for a day mowing the lawn -- but it'll serve the purpose quite well."
"D- This is a great example of a sessionable pilsner."
"Note: Make sure to let this one warm some before you drink. The flavors balance as it warms."
"good all around summer drinker. nothing massively impressive, but has pours a nice straw as expected, some hints of maltiness that hide the slight hoppiness in the taste. balanced carbonation keeps this crisp and quite drinkable. good with appetizers or sitting around waiting for the brats to cook on the grill...and the nugget nectar to get cold..."
"D: A very solid offering across the board. A nice, refreshing pilsner with some character that would really hit the spot on a hot, humid summer evening."
"Easily sessionable and highly enjoyable. A perfect lawnmower beer."
"Im always happy to see a Pilsner around that I have not had before. This one was poured in to a Pilsner glass. Color was what a Pils should look like, very pale gold, with a sizable, fizzy white head. Smell is interesting, it almost has a briny shellfish character to it. Other than that, some bright malt. Taste is a nice mix of snappy hops, and biscuit like malt. A little more carbonation might help the drinkability here, but it still comes across as a very sessionable lager. Overall I think Troegs did a good job with this one. As others have said, there need to be more lagers out there, and this one is no exception. Next time I will most likely opt for a six pack as opposed to a single bottle. Cheers"
"Overall - A nice one that I think will be even better when the summer months come around. Will have to buy some more and have it on a hot day."
"Sunshine pils pours a light golden with a thick white head that quickly dissappears leaving a thin white ring. The smell is mainly wheat and yeast with a hint of lemony hops. The taste is strange--lemon & wheat are present, but there's also an almost medicinal bitterness to it that leaves a sort of undesireable aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp. This is an OK pilsener, but definitely not one of the stronger brews from Troegs."
"Palate is dry, crisp, with a moderately high carbonation appropriate to the style."
"Drinkability: Fair enough, a fine beer with a very different taste compared to what I'm used to. And this is strictly a matter of personal opinion - but I'm not the biggest fan of the taste of lemon. However, the beer was very good and tasty, and I will definitely drink it again if the opportunity arises."
"D - Crisp tasting beer, not up to Troegs' amazing standards in my opinion but a good beer none the less"
"Overall: next"
"D - The summer go to beer... draft, bottles, whatever it may be this beer goes back real smooth. No cloying sweetness, not over hopped, this could be the only pils id ever drink again."
"D: Nice drinkability, dry and well hopped. A big drinking pilsner that I would by all means drink as a session. 6 pack worthy by all means. A big showing here and worthy by all means."
"A solid Pils from Troegs that while a little lighter than I prefer in the style, stills holds it's own with some nice flavors and crisp drinkibility. Good summertime brew."
"Overall, this is a simple, tasty, refreshing brew. I prefer this one on tap, but pick it up regardless if you have the chance."
"Notes: Supremely refreshing, but with more than enough flavor. An excellent pils, one that's drinkable at any time of the year."
"Ampther go at this one. I'm not a huge pilsener fan, but this one was definitely one of my favorites. In the bottle, it was definitely solid still. Crisp and light, with a nice smooth caramel malt flavor and some nice mild swirling fruit. Body was well carbonated and medium in body. A good beer, although, again, I prefer a nice wheat when I'm in that summer-heat-need-a-beer kind of mood."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It poured a pale, tranlucent yellow with a decent head. On the nose are a mild hop aroma. The taste is just like the bottle says- crisp, hoppy - I would add clean. The beer is light bodied and very drinkable. This is a very solid pilsner and a great alternative to a lager at a BBQ."
"Damn solid pils. One of the best I've had."
"O/D: Overall this is quite a nice offering from the Trogner Brothers. It's a great summer thirst quencher and a good beer for craft beer beginners to see that a Pilsener Lager can have some flavor. I'll probably have this in the fridge every summer, but it lacks a bit of the hop ""punch"" and spice that some of the other local offerings have."
"D - Drinkability is good. This beer is refreshing and goes down very easy. Alcohol is hidden well behind the other flavors. Glad to see breweries try this style. Troegs pulled of a nice Pilsner with the Sunshine Pils. Glad I got to try it."
"wonderfully hoppy german pils. drink more pils."
"Again, nice, but go for a Victory Prima Pils long before you grab one of these."
"Notes: A decent beer. Not so excited about it,but on a hot day it does the trick."
"D - While I haven't been a big fan of pils in the past, I really enjoyed this one. Very easy to drink."
"Taste has a lot of European hops, very earthy and a bit spicy. A decent amount of pale malt. A bit of lemon flavor as well. Feel is light bodied and well carbonated. Very light and refreshing. Dry, crisp, and clean finish. Very drinkable as well - easily sessionable. Great for a hot summer day."
"Could drink this all summer long."
"Overall, not a bad beer. This, as i said earlier, is not a popular style with me, but I like mixing up my beers and giving certain brewers a chance with me. My guess is that this would probably please most pilsener lovers."
"This one is a very light but vibrant colored yellow with a large sticky white head that lasts forever and leaves sporatic lacing. Smells not overpowering but has a nice sweet grainy malt nose with some grassy and lemon hop sents. Taste is as in the nose with the hops winning out at the end. Medium mouth feel and super drinkable."
"Cheers..."
"D. A solid pilsner. I'm no pils fan but this one was ok."
"Poured a clear straw yellow color with thin bubbly white head, ok retention and nice sticky lacing. Smells of earthy hops, honey, toasted pale malt grain, grass, and herbal hops. Tastes of lemon rind and grass up front followed by sweetness from honey and pale malt. Medium light in body with good carbonation. A good bitter start followed by nice sweetness and graininess and a crisp refreshing finish."
"Drinkability: I enjoy this, but I was hoping for more, especially since I love Troegs so much. I got a six-pack, which is perfect for the weather right now, but this is more like a summer brew than a pilsner, though I suppose it's supposed to be a hybrid."
"Pours a very nice golden yellow color, nice one-finger white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind, very nice carbonation. The nose is slightly malty, hoppy, very slight spicyness. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, some malts, spices. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice thirst quencher, Thanks Joe."
"Solid Pils for sure. I am just so spoiled now that I live in Pennsylvania and all these great lagers are so available. I think that this beer is slightly more crisper and more refreshing for the summer months, but Prima Pils and Stoudts Pils have the edge in the flavor department."
"D. Good as well, but this is a run of the mill Pils."
"good beer here, searching for a summer session? try this one out, but make sure you have a back up or 2 because this 6 will disappear very quickly."
"the first time i had this beer i wasn't really sure if they 5.3 abv was correct because i slammed down a few of them and didn't feel a thing. maybe it was the nachos i had right beforehand. either way, this is a great beer. light and refreshing but has a great hop finish that's crisp and delightful. pours a light yellow that is somewhat deceptive, but has a nice white head and great lacing. very little malt taste to speak of making it a perfect beer for relaxing at the poor or on the beach or right after mowing the lawn. get into it."
"It would seem that some of the American craft brewers are mastering the art of the pilsner - Troegs is certainly one of them."
"pours out a straw-lemonade color. lots of lemony tart hops, some grassy aroma, actually ""sunny"" to get a little corny. Flavors are spot-on pils-slightly bitter, tart, light, well balanced. Troegs nailed this one on the head. If you be drinking Pils in Germany during the summer, drink Troegs and Victory Prima!"
"D: Very good. Nice beer for a hot afternoon. Looking forward to having a couple. . . ."
"Notes: My favorite pilsner to date. I generally just can't get into the style I'm really trying to give it another chance. This is a nice quenching brew for a hot summer day."
"I popped this one open on a 97-degree day in Philly, and it hit the spot. Sunshine is definitely a great summer brew."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Easy going down and an excellent combination of mouthfeel and taste. Definitely an excellent pilsner and a well-rounded overall summer beer."
"Glad I gave it a second chance."
"This is one of the best Pilsener style beers I have ever tasted. This has become my warm weather favorite for all occaisions."
"D: Very drinkable, a good lawnmower beer to say the least. This is not my first go-to in the Tröegs family but it would work in a pinch."
"M + D: Carbonation is perhaps pushing aggressive in some ways... strange that it didn't leave a head with this. Finishes semi-dry, leaving a bittering aftertaste. I prefer the flavour of this as it warms, which would actually make it more of an ideal summer drink, with the heat outside warming it up quite quickly. A reasonable crack at the style from Tröegs... perhaps not among the favourites, but something I'd enjoy again."
"Final Thoughts: One beer a individual should add to his or her collection. This beer did give me a shock since at first sight I figured it was going to actually be somewhat of a disappointment. I learned not to judge a beer by its look and never shall I again make this mistake. Drink one for me!"
"Smooth, almost creamy, but the carbonation does sting a bit, light-moderate body. Drinkable, but slightly subdued American Pils."
"Overall a solid pils from Troegs, but not outstanding. I perefer the hoppier pils produced by Victory and Sly Fox, but this one comes in third. It just does not carry the same amount of hops as the others do, even though the label calls it ""hoppy"". Still, a solid beer."
"Overall, a nice take on the style. I keep trying more pilsners and always seem slightly let down in the end. I'm begining to think I just don't prefer the sytle. Definately one of the better pilsners I've ever had and you can't go wrong with anything from Troegs. Cheers!!"
"D: A good summer beer. I prefer it more on the colder side."
"Notes: Excellent stuff. I'm glad to see more American craft breweries making good pilsners."
"d- pretty solid and a good session beer"
"Pale light golden/ yellow topped by a white head. The aroma has lots of fresh barley, light dough and tons of crisp grassy hops. Light fluffy body with a crisp flavor. Has some mild biscuit notes and a balancing dryness. Grassy and pleasantly bitter finish. Solid profile and extremely sessionable."
"After a couple of these over the weekend, it seems clear that this is a simple beer: a solid pils, a worthy example of the style, huge drinkability, great for summer, and probably a good diversion from the strong, syrupy, big-ass beers lots of us like to drink. Takes me back down to earth a bit."
"Drinkability- Wonderful summer session beer, I LOVE THIS BEER!!"
"Poured from bottle to pint glass and it looked like a hazy piss with minimal 1/8 inch of foam head, on par with Coors Light. The smell was like lawn clippings that I forgot to dump out of the lawnmower's catcher 2 weeks ago. Bitter, metalic taste that is quite nasty. Long bitter aftertaste on this, not like any Pilsner I have had, in a bad way. Would not buy again, and will not drink the rest of these since I am forcing the end of this Pint down."
"D_extremely drinkable pils. Very refreshing and a great summertime brew."
"D= very drinkable, but not a good representation of its Pilsner style. Drink it like an APA."
"T: Light medium body, that is still pretty thick on the tongue. Lots of carbonation and a very refreshing body of hops, grass, lemon, etc. Not quite as hoppy as expected, but still has nice bite from the hops and lemon, earthy flavors. Aftertaste lingers for a while and is very refreshing."
"This one didnt have the same hop bite that I was accustomed to from previous tastings but as a whole Im guessing it was just this batch. Not the best of Troegs but still more than a solid beer and one that is a great summer drinker."
"D-A nice warm season session beer. This one is easy to drink and a beer with enough satisfying flavour that even flavour whores like me wont turn away from. A solid offering for sure....a classic American done German Pils."
"D - This is a perfect session beer for the summer months. I can (and will) drink this all day on a warm summer afternoon. I anticipate its release every year with bated breath! Hey Troegs... can you please make this a year 'round offering?"
"Another beer that's not really my style. I have to be in the mood or the right atmosphere for something this light and bubbly, but I could definitely see myself having one of these on my balcony on a warm day. Considering it solely for what it is - a German pilsener - it's decent, missing some of the spiciness and stronger hop presences of those beers, despite claiming to be well-hopped. Not the best Tröegs brew, but not a miss, either."
"d - This is definitely a good summer beer, but I think I prefer zatec for a pils. It's less bitter and dry."
"Poured from a bottle purchased at American Beer Distributors in Brooklyn. Crystal clear, golden colored, thin wet looking white foam. The aroma is malty and a little estered, and the taste is satisfyingly malty with a real nice but slightly bitter after-taste. This is a really good beer, I'm starting to turn towards these light and more subtle beers more and more."
"This sample had more of a traditional grassy nobel hop flavor and a light cracker like malt though still a bit bready on the malt and I thought I tasted some lemon."
"D: I could drink this all day."
"D- easy to put down and goes down smooth. Only issue i see is the grassy/earthy afteraste. It isnt all that appealing! A good brew from Troegs nonetheless considering it is a seasonal."
"Pours an extremely light straw color, clear, with a solid half inch of big bubbly white head. In the aroma, I get a bit of sulfur, some lightly toasty grain, a little grassiness, slight DMS, and a bit of noble hop aroma. On the palate, it's a pleasant blend of light Pils malt (toastiness, some graham cracker) and bright, bitter hops. The Saaz and Mittelfrau that they use certainly bring a dry, bitter spiciness, and some floral notes. Overall, it's nothing really special, but it's very much to style and a joy to drink. I just wish it was sunnier and warmer out to enjoy this."
"4/17/2009 I looked forward to the reissue of this Troeg's seasonal all winter - and now I'm rather disappointed. This year's batch of Sunshine is not nearly as bright for me as last years. Something has changed, and not for the better. The beer is still a lovely golden color but the smell is weak and the taste as well. This years Sunshine Pils is thin and approaches being watery. Almost a classic macro light beer taste. Very disappointing for someone who is a huge Troeg's fan."
"taste: pretty impressed with the taste for this light beer. very crisp and had a nice initial bite. reminds me of a hoppier and tastier version of a domestic light beer (that was a compliment)"
"Final Note: now that Tröegs brews are available at my local beer store, I will be going through plenty of this beer over the Summer."
"Not a bad German Pilsner. I think this one, as would any Pilsner, would go great in the summer during a BBQ. Solid beer. Recommended."
"EDIT: The more I drink this beer and the warmer it gets, the more I like it. I had to up some of my ratings."
"Poured in a pilsener glass and was a bright yellow color that was clear and with little head. Aroma was not real strong but it was somewhat grassy. Flavor has a light hop taste to it and I detected a bit of a lemon taste and possibly some honey. Mouthfeel was good. Solid but unspectacular beer."
"Thanks to Tom for the Troegs mega-pack!"
"Got a case of bottles from my work (Exton Beverage) and couldnt wait to get home and try it. Poured into a Victory pint glass, has a nice fluffy white head and a good lace all the way through. Appearance is a pale yellow color, typical for a German pilsner. Smells of citrus with definite notes of German aroma hops, most likely hallertau. This is hands down the most refreshing beer I have ever had! Finished it so fast I couldnt beleive it, I had to immediately go for another one. Taste is very sweet and citric with enough of a hoppy bite to balance it out. Very crisp and refreshing as well as flavorful, you cant help but smile while drinking this. A definite summertime beer. Could easily drink a ton of these and not even know it. Since buying my first case I have since bought at least five or six more and I now look forward to it every spring. BRAVO TROEGS!"
"Pours a slightly foggy straw color. A white head of large carbonation bubbles doesn't stick around. Nose is clean with a touch of citrus it seems. Flavor is clean at first with a slight earthy metallic aftertaste hitting only after some time. Feel has a lower carbonation to it sending big bubbles over your tongue. Very drinkable. Definitely a session brew."
"From a 12oz bottle with a big sun on it, pours an off-yellow almost white-wine color with some carbonation present... head is very minimal, almost non-existent... copped this singly from Wine and More in West Orange for about $1.50... Aroma is typical pilsener, slightly bitter and hoppy, but all in all, quite average in every respect... taste was decent, but nothing to write home about... this is a pretty average sample, and I expected more from a brewery which really impressed me with Dreamweaver Wheat... Mouthfeel is equally average, and the beer goes down crisp and smooth with only a slightly bitter aftertaste that is very hard to detect... drinkability is very easy, as this beer goes down effortlessly, although I'm not sure I'd make this my single choice of the night simply because it lacks an exciting factor seen in many other beers I've sampled... an average sample, though not recommended... Average in all respects..."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer to drink several of, it’s pretty refreshing as well."
"D- Would be good on a hot summer day. A great barbecue beer in the sun."
"I like Prima Pils better"
"This beer poured a clear straw color with a creamy head. The aroma is sweet and hoppy. The taste is hop like - without much malt characteristics. There are some spices perceptible. The mouthfeel is this and watery. Overall, this is a clean easy to drink beer that has quite a fitting name."
"Pours just about the lightest pale straw golden I've ever seen. Great clarity. Head is fluffy, frothy, and leaves ornate lacing on about one half of the glass. Aroma is big, juicy, tea-like, herbal, mildly citrus hops with an underlying crackery malt backbone. In the flavor, the malts come out more than in the smell and forms a wonderful balance with the jasmine tea presence of the hops. Does not have as much hop sting as, say, Prima Pils, but I rather like that about this one. Finishes dry and assertively bitter. Mouthfeel is rather light (even more so than what I'm used to within this style) and the carbonation is very lively. Probably the best pils I've ever had. Extremely impressive."
"Overall, a pretty nice pils, but it lacks the malt complexity of a great one. The hops dominate and there's a nice lager tang that goes along with it. The hops are grassy, herbal and citrus, all quite tasty with a perceived bitterness on par with decent pale ale."
"d - this goes down easily and is a wonderful summer brew. really light and refreshing and i could drink a few of these."
"Not bad for a East coast beer. I'll stick to my west coasties, but not a bad trade bonus beer. Nice average beer...."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer good for a session out in the hot heat. I do not think it is the best for the price, as i would rather get other offerings from troegs at the same price, or get one like this for cheaper. Probably not one i will pick up again, but nothing in this is bad."
"This sounds like a taste test I'd like to conduct."
"From bottle to glass it sits bright gold with a slight haze. White head with excellent carbonation. Sunshine has a light aroma that's both spicy and lemony. Similar palate with a kiss of noble hops at the end. Very refreshing. I could go through many a bottle on a hot summer day. A Pils done right."
"The carbonation is very easy on the palate and that is a welcome from a pilsner.I love this beer,I wish I had more of it.Great beer for summer and a peerfect session beer.Amen Troegs"
"I thought this Pils was very nice. Plenty of flavor, very refreshing, I wish I could get this here in Arizona. Highly Recommended..."
"Pours a very light gold, with yellow highlights and a slight dusting of pearly white head. The aroma is a bit lemony and sandy, with little in the way of malt balance. On the palate, a touch of astringency and citrus notes that are very out of place in a pils. Little of the expected zesty, earthy hop aroma. This beer isn't really made to style. It's not bad, just middling, but could be a lot better with some more orthodoxy."
"Light yellow color lacking any head. The bouquet lacks any distinct aromas and disappoints. Taste is light, easy and highlighted with delicate hop flavors. Strong laces form along the glass. The beer rolls off the tongue and down the throat with ease. Despite the weak aromas and mediocre flavors the beer is quite drinkable and suitable for a summer BBQ."
"This beer is a fine example of a great tasting pilsner. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a very pale gold with a very nice initial head that sticks around as a decent cap throughout my enjoyment of the beer. Excellent lacing. The smell is of soft noble hops and the clean lager yeast. Taste is fairly soft, but with a nice lingering bitterness, clean flavors and some earthy and floral hops. The mouthfeel is more soft and creamy than crisp, and it is light to medium bodied for a pilsner. Very easy drinking. I don't like his one as much as Prima pils from Victory, but its still awfully nice, especially on a hot day like today."
"Pours a nice pale golden color with a white head. In the aroma I can already tell that it is hoppier than a standard pilsner. In the taste, it has hops and a balanced profile that is not standard with pilsners. This is a fantastic beer for summer, light, hoppy and just great. Anyone that likes IPAs with love this beer."
"OK, it says Pilsner and it says its craft brewed, but man is it pale!! Yeah Pils are pale but this one looks lighter, more like a Budweiser. However, the aroma is pleasant, clean, a slight maltiness and a very slight floral hoppy hint. The flavor is good too, not as heavy as some Pilsners I've had and not nearly as bitter as others but pretty drinkable - starts dry, then comes a little malt and some spicy cool minty hops, then a little bitterness. Not very exciting to me but drinkable for sure, especially for summertime."
"Drinkability is exceptional."
"Very easy to drink, contains a good amount of flavor, nothing overpowering, a well rounded easy drinking pilsener from Troeg's. I'd like to see more breweries take a stab at the pilsener style."
"Light mouthfeel with some coarseness from the hop feel. Very easy drinking. Great summer session beer with puckering hoppiness,but an airee feel,great hop taste. Could drink this one all of a summer day long and have done it before. I'd recommend trying this beer this summer."
"Recommended."
"Pours a very pale yellow, almost clear, thick and tight white head forms, nice lacing, and good retention. Smell is very grassy, slight skunkiness, caramel, citrus, floral, not too bad. Taste is wheaty, caramel, very light breadiness, some floral and citrus, nice bitterness, very light however. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium to high carbonation, kind of sharp, but refreshing. Kind of seems like more of a kolsch than a pils to me, but refreshing nonetheless. Thanks Jason!"
"The pour into my Prima Pils glass raises a head like whipped egg whites one finger high. It doesn't keep its height for long, though. The lacing is sparse but sticky. The body is a very pale gold, which sits at the edge of transparency. The nose is like cereal, with just a bit of acidity. No hoppiness makes its way through. The taste has a strong sulphery earthiness, with a bit of acidity to the bready maltiness. The hops are a buit metallic, but not very potent. It is balanced, though. The mouth is very thin, perhaps too much so even for this style. Overall, less than what I expected from Tröegs, but still easily drinkable and refreshing."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability, for a Troeg's beer, is utterly delightful. I would recommend this to any craft novice who hasn't experienced the wonderful world of the Hopheads. Let him try this and frollick with them and become one... whoa. I've gone too far."
"D - Very tasty and refreshing on the first 85 degree of the year. This one could definitely be my summer beer if it was available here."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A lively, active mouthfeel that really emphasizes the clean, honest flavors and ingredients. Light bodied and so easy to drink on a day where burgers and grilled fare might be on the menu. An excellent, highly recommended choice this summer."
"Easy to drink in the spring. Probably my least favorite Troegs brew though."
"D- with its light cripsy taste this is a very drinkable and good session beer in the summer when you need something light and refreshing."
"Drinkability - I definitely will be drinking more of this through the summer months."
"Try a Stoudt's Pils or a Victory Prima Pils instead. I was quite disappointed with this beer, all the other Troegs beers are outstanding."
"A very light, refreshing brew. Great beer for this time of the year!"
"Drinkability - This was an excellent session brew which made for a very nice light, crisp drinking experience while still providing a lot of spice and flavor. With the lower alccohol level you could defintely pound a few of these in a row without much ill effect. Excellent balance for a warm spring day."
"Maybe I'm just in a good mood, and maybe I'm partial to Troegs since they make my favorite ales, but I think this is my lager/pils to beat. I'll continue my quest and chime in when I find better."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, it pours a pale straw color with some slight haziness along with 2 fingers of white, seafoam head that clings to the glass much like a good ale would. Aroma is featured with some slightly lemon and floral hops aroma. Malts are pale and uneventful. Sipping reveals a crisp citrus flavor along with a peppery pure pilsner malt. A quite refreshing flavor and feel. Alcohol is nearly non-existent, and this one makes for a great summer drinker, and to be honest it is an easy drinking brew any time of the year when you want smoething not overwhelming to your senses, and you want to drink a bunch of it! Cheers!"
"Drinkability/notes: The bittering hops completely overshadow the malt presence. While otherwise a well-crafted Pilsener, the hop use is a bit aggressive."
"Beer poured into glass at 50 degrees which was to warm for this Pils. Beer is certainy hoppy with a very crisp bitter aftertaste. A bit too hoppy for me but I think hoppy beer folks would like this product. Beer was very pale very freash tasting. Thin head.Will not purchase again."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Initial brief mildly sweet bready maltiness finishing with a dry, pleasantly bitter earthiness. Not very complex, but executed very well. Light bodied without being thin, refreshing, very easy to drink."
"This is another fine example of a very drinkable craft pilsner. Nicely defines the style."
"This is a really solid yet simple beer."
"The mouthfeel was near perfect, except for a VERY slight drying (less than most beers, really). It's sessionable as a mofo - almost goes down too well. I might deem this the most refreshing pilsner I've ever had."
"Overall this is a great summer seasonal that I am glad I finally stopped passing it by."
"Overall an excellent hoppy Pils. An absolute perfect summer beer. A toned down version of Prima Pils."
"Drinkability? It's a well made pils man. Is there anything more drinkable out there?"
"D: Like a bud with taste. This beer is awesome on a hot day...Makes me wish I had a lawn to mow."
"Prosit!"
"Pours bud light color, but the head is magnificent! Tremendous clumpy fluff. Gorgeous lacing. Aroma is very reserved, but very delicate floral hops. Initially very clean, grainy sweet malts with a nice biscuit aspect. Lemony undertones throughout which then shift to a floral, spicy dimension drying through the rather doughy finish. Not quite as much bitterness as i would enjoy, nor as much bite as i prefer in a pils, but well balanced. Extremely light fluffy body and fine carbonation. Imminently drinkable."
"Final Thought: A very enjoyable pils from one of the best in the business. Next time in PA I will consider purchasing a case of this one."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very light bodied. The beer is well carbonated. This is a real beer treat. I could drink this beer all day long. Thanks Troegs for a great beer."
"as advertised: clean, crisp, coors. no wait...this IS clean and crisp...not weak and watery"
"Drinkability is quite good, very refreshing a great hot weather beer. Prosit MK"
"Honestly, probably the most refreshing beer I have had. I was sceptical when a almost colorless beer was put in front of me, with a minimal head, but the smell of lemon was inviting. The flavor was quite unexpectedly full, with a nice hoppyness with lemon overtones, I can see this one becoming quite popular in the future. I wouldn't have a problem drinking a pitcher, if there wasn't so much else out there to try, still."
" Is this beer a total loss? Not even close. Unfortunately, this is Troegs and like Sierra Nevada, Brooklyn, Anchor, and Three Floyds, I hold these guys up to a higher standard. Sure, I never met a beer I didn't like, but this was one of the few from the breweries that I love, that let me down."
"Somehow they manage to pack some flavor into this even with the pale color. A mild hop presence that continues throughout to a dry bitter finish is coupled with a sipid malt underbelly."
"Poured a light, golden color with a nice fluffy, egg shell colored head and heavy carbonation. Just a touch of lacing was left behind. Aromas of pine and hops seemed to dominate. The taste was quite bland without any real qualities. I had a difficult time finishing my pint; I really didn't want any of it after just a few sips. Lacking in most characteristics that I expect in a pilsener. Overly dry without any kind of complexity or intermixing of malt/hop flavors. Just one unified, boiled down flavor. A bit waxy in mouth as well, making it difficult to enjoy. I think the ideas going into this beer were fine evidenced by the inclusion of German hops and the different kinds of malt used, but the finished product left me wanting a Victory Prima Pils or an Eggenberg. Not a very good beer and I will not be having this again."
"A true stunner. Agreat summer brew and a real surpirse. Pours an extremely pale yellow with a nice creamy head and lacing that sticks around. Smell give some slight citrus notes, nothing overpowering. The taste is what knocks you out. easily drinkable by the six-pack, this beer has a nice Saaz finish with hints of grassy-ness and lemon. Have yet to serve this to a BMC drinker who doesn't love it."
"Pours an extremely pale yellow with a medium head and some lacing. Probably the palest beer I have ever seen. Smell was mostly hops and not much else. Slightly funky aroma. Taste was mostly hops and again slightly funky. Very light, crisp, and refreshing. Easy to drink, but the funkiness can be a little too much. A good summer barbecue beer."
"Drinkability: Overall a nice simple, affordable, easily drinkable, crisp, hoppy beer. If it's hot outside, then I might suggest getting a cold one of these out of the fridge."
"Drinkability: Superbly refreshing; the fruit profile is unique but very interesting"
"D - I am not normally a pils drinker, and I do not love the aroma on this beer, but it is extremely easy to drink and before I knew it most of this beer was gone. If you can get past the aroma, the flavor of this beer is pretty good and you could easly drink several of these without getting too filled up or intoxicated. If you're a Troegs fan, pick this one up."
"I have been very impressed so far with all the Troegs brews that I have tried and this one did not disappoint. Troegs is slowly becoming a new favorite brewery of mine."
"I like this one, but certainly I have better offerings in the style."
"Bottle pour into a really nice pilsner glass (thanks , babe ) pale straw in color , fluffy , dense white head that clings to the sides in a nifty lace pattern all the way down . Perfect carbonation tasty hop bitterness and flavor /aroma . yeah , I'll buy it again , perfect with burgers . An altogether pleasant summer brew ."
"I like Tröegs but this is not the reason why."
"Really nothing going on here that makes me want another."
"Huh. I've really tried to get into Troegs. I really have. But the same thing that typically happens when I try a Troegs brew happened here yet agian. Poured a watery, pale yellow with a small head which left little lacing. The aroma did have that grassyu hoppiness, but almost a skunky sweetness I wasn't all about. Yes, there is a fine line between a good pils and something resembling Coors but this was more of the latter. The taste had all this but also had mild malts, some sweetness, but I can't tell if it was fruit or plain sugars. Alcohol as well. Very watery mouthfeel, bild bitterness but once again that too-sweet maltiness was way out of place for a Pils. Was it drinkable? Depends on your aim. Wanna get stinko? Rock this out. Want a good example of a Pils? Look elsewhere."
"M/F is thin, maybe even a bit watery, yet pleasant for the season, making drinkability high. This is not the best offering from Troeg's, but still a tasty one, and a good example of the style."
"session beer for sure."
"Yummy Pilsener from the good folks at Troegs. Pours pale sunshine with pillowy, sticky head. Aroma is fresh spring greens and faint lightly sweet malt. Taste is crisply subdued leafy hops with biscuity backdrop and clean dry fiinsh. Refreshingly light on the palate. Excellent Spring and Summertime choice."
"The color of this example is quite pale, reminding me of a light beer. The head was impressive though, it almost got away from me on the pour. The smell was like what you would expect from a German Style Pilsener, hoppy with a touch of grass and citrus. The taste was better than I expected based upon the appearance. I found it to be crisp with a nice hoppyness and bit of that grass and citrus that I noticed in the aroma. A very slight bitter but welcome aftertaste follows but doesn't last for long. The mouthfeel was a little heavier than I would have guessed it to be based on the appearance again, yet still pretty light and the carbonation was just right. As far a drinkability this beer does what I think it should. I found it to be very easy to drink and quite quenching. This is a beer I will buy again. I have some yard work I need to get done this week, when I'm done I know what I'm going to drink. Even though It has no bearing on the taste I wish it had a bit more color so it doesn't look like a light beer in my Pilsner Glass."
"Cheers!"
"While it is not terrible, there are much better examples of the style for the same price or less."
"Thanks to Maltygoodness and BIF Across America for the beer."
"A good solid pilsner, and one I look forward to drinking plenty of this summer."
"Body is between light and medium, very slick and thirst quenching, with ample carbonation. Excellent drinkability, nice and light for supreme refreshment."
"D - A good pilsner if you are looking for something best described as a step above the average macro. Otherwise, there are better options. It is pretty easy to drink, despite being very dry all around. It is certainly sessionable and good for foods."
"I can drink this all day. A great pils that I look forward to every year. I think that the new recipe has improved on an already great beer."
"It pours a cloudy, light-golden color, and smells of hoppy barley. Tasted a bit hoppier than I had expected, but not enough to overpower that great pilsner taste. Also, it's much lighter and smoother than I anticipated. My favorite Troegs, next to Dreamweaver."
"This does look like bottled sunshine, very bright golden color. It's a very nice beer, a little on the citrusy side but well balanced overall. The Pils benefited greatly from a recipe change a while ago, my first tasting of it was not impressive. It now stands with the other excellent pilseners from south central PA."
"D-High. Light in body and consistency. Not a heavy taste. Crisp, refreshing, could easily get this stuff down."
"[Thanks to mntlover for sending this interesting PA brew westward...]"
"As for drinkability, you could sip these all afternoon (after mowing your lawn), and not feel full or bloated. This is the best pilsner I have ever had, behind Clipper City's ""Small Craft Warning."""
"Somewhat of a slight hops aroma, appearance is light goldon in color, very clear. Head was average, off white and maintained itself while drinking. Flavor was moderately bitter, you could taste the hops throughout with medium carbonation. What i would consider a moderately good tasting pilsner."
"This is a great session beer. Very easy to drink, a thirst quencher, perfect for those hot summer days. The 1st one goes down way too easy. A beer that I will certainly keep around in my fridge."
"Has a clear straw color with a white head that disappeared quickly. There is a malty sweetness on the nose with some citrus and hops. Nothing really stands out in the taste, some malty sweetness and some hops. Lots of carbonation, very crisp, feels good in the mouth, very refreshing, it leaves behind some bitterness from the hops. Good hot day outdoor beer."
"Poured a dull golden color with a relatively thin head for the style and is gone quite quickly,toasted slightly sweet aromas dominate but there is a sharp grassy hoppiness that shows itself lightly as well.Pretty well rounded pilsner not as hoppy as the bottle might lead you to believe but there is a sharpness to it mainly in the finish,lightly sweet and grainy mainly up front.As easy drinking pilsner good for the summer months with enough hop presence to give it some dimension."
"Color is a rather thin and dull-looking pale yellow. Thick and bright white head initally that quickly dies off to a paper-thin layer. Nice lacing of the glass, though. Aromas are an arrangement of flowers, freshly-cut grass, and some spicy zest. Sweetness peeks in around the edges. Flavor is brisk...like a good hopped-up pilsener should be. Bracing on the palate, there's a smidgen of malty sweetness to counteract the hoppy goodness in here. Finishes dry, with a residual bitterness that dries out your mouth. Good mouthfeel and immensely quaffable. This could be the new hot-as-hell in Richmond, summer thirst-quencher. Chalk up another winner in my book for Tröegs!"
"The taste does a nice dance mixing and matching the matlyness and the hop presence. 1st is a bread-like malt, followed by some hops, with a nice matly follow-up and a slight, and plaesing malty finish. The carbonation is slight, but, enough to show that it adds to the over all presentation. A nice mix, refreshing, drinkable, and a solid brew all in all"
"Drinkability: Not bad at all. Decent balance, clean for a well-hopped pilsener but Ive had better. Very drinkable and refreshing, but a little bit one-dimensional. Still worth a try, especially on these hot days."
"This may not be the right time to rate this, after my writing down my impressions of St. Pauli Girl. But here goes. Pours very light straw color, with a nice foamy head. Chewy, grainy malt taste gives this much more oomph than any major beer in this style. I could not find the expected Saaz hop profile this needs, though. There are some ticklish hops down the back of my throat, but just not quite what Id have thought to find."
"-Oelergud"
"pours a medium amber color with magnificent white puffy head, that lasted throught. Smell is large with lemons, other citrus and a slight piney note. Taste is extremely crisp with a nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is a dty bitterness that beckons for more. One of my favorite pilseners"
"This is a very drinkable summer brew, one that I could have very many of. It's not quite as hoppy as Victory Prima Pils for instance, but is every bit as good."
"very very nice refreshing pilsner."
"Thanks to JackTheRipper for this unexpected and greatly appreciated gift."
"Thx to Pegasus for sharing the bottle"
"Drinkability: The bitterness does not balance well with the more refreshing aspects of this beer...therefore I don't know how many of these I would want to drink"
"12 oz. bottled on 4/18/05 - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a yellow/gold color with moderate streams of carbonation and a 1 finger off-white head that doesn't leave much lacing. Lots of piney/citric hops in the aroma that are very inviting. The first sip is a rush of hops - pine, grapefruit, and floral hops flavors that are fairly bitter. To support the hops there are biscuity malts and a touch of diacety. This beer has a crisp, medium body and is overall a very nice lager with loads of hops. Another quality beer from Tröegs."
"Drinkability and Overall: Other than the mouthfeel, this is a superb pilsener. Damn near as good (if not better) than most pilseners coming out of Germany. The citrus taste is odd, but a nice and welcome change that will keep you drinking all day. One of the more perfect summer beers."
"This pils is a nice golden color with ample carbonation and a very light head of white. The smell is nicely sweet, with some wildflower and spice in the hop blend. The taste is really great. This has a really clean feeling and the malt lends a bit of doughy sweetness. The hops are done perfectly, with Saaz at the helm giving some pepper, quite a bit of lemon and orange, and a nice green taste I can only liken to fresh grass and honeysuckle. I'm floored by this. It's much more approachable than some of the super hopped pilsners out there and it walks the perfect line between sweet fruit and prickly hops. Troeg's continues to impress me. A midstate rival to PA's other favorite brewery? Perhaps...."
"Drinkability  Very so."
"Smooth. Very refreshing and it seems perfect for summer. Which we aren't getting right this second."
"12 ounce bottle sampled, no freshness dating to be found. This summer brew pours light golden, clear, with a snow white head, tiny bubbles present and minor lacing left on the glass. The nose I pick up is of powdered sugar and perhaps a slight floral note. This is a pleasantly crisp and hoppy pils. Light and refreshing with a steady hop bitternes and bite late. Nicely crafted, more worthy brew from Troegs."
"Big dense off-white colored head leaves nice lacing as it slowly subsides. Transparent straw colored beer with streams of slowly rising bubbles feeding the head. Spicy hop aroma with a mildly sweet malt base. Light crisp, barely sweet grassy malt base up front. Floral and spicy hops kick in towards the end making for a nice mix of flavors. Just a pinch drier and this would be one of my go to beers."
"Was lightly lemony citric fruity but bitter and grassy and moldy and herbal tasting. Grassy aroma, golden colour and bit of head. Sweetness, light bodied. Crisp and dry aftertaste.An above average beer, and I am ranking it to style. On tap at the Standard Tap."
"Overall-a superb pilsner, as a person who likes hops I think this is among the best pilsners around and along with Victory's Prima Pils sets the standard for craft-brew German style pilsners, a shame this is only a seasonal. An absolute Saaz hop explosion. Pick this one up NOW."
"What an excellent summer brew. Vacation beacons; thus my ratings may be a bit skewed but if its leading to summer and the beer takes the mind there and its deemed by the tongue and palate as highly acceptable for sessioning in the heights of summer, I'd say Troegs' intention and resultant product are 'spot on'. A sixer of Sunshine Pils may last until the trip to OBX in 3 weeks."
"Pours a pale yellow with tons of carbonation bubbles, but barely any head at all. The smell is fairly faint, but refreshing with a strong lemon scent and a hint of grassy hops. The taste of this one is superb, with well balanced bready malts being offset by the strong citrus hops. This has a medium mouthfeel and is very well carbonated, leaving a refreshing feeling after each drink. I only picked up one of these, but this will be on my list of summer once the weather gets warmer."
"Seek this one out!"
"Got this one from a friend who got it straight off the bottling line at the brewery. Pours a pale yellow with a nice head and lots of carbonation. Smells of lemon and a flowery hop aroma. Lemon is the first taste you notice and very little hops bitterness. As the beer warms a nice spiciness starts to show through. Very light bodied beer that is a great summertime brew."
"Last swigs: Lemon hard candy with easy drinkability. Not TROEGS best, but an easy dust cutter."
"Wow, another excellent beer from Troegs. Why did it take me so long to sample this one!? This is a lovely dark golden beer with a head of white frothy foam. The aromas are all crisp, herbal, german hops and nice bread-like malts. There is also a hint of lemon in there as well. The taste is hoppy up front, and there is a lovely flavor of fresh cut grass and pine needles as well. The middle of this beer is bready and excellent and the finish is crisp, dry, and oh-so refreshing! This is like prima-pils lite, but this is not a bad thing at all. The mouthfeel is light and very carbonated and the drinkability is damn excellent! A less hoppy Prima, that is almost better than Prima!"
"Sunshine Pils is easily one of my favorite examples of the style, at least among domestic brews. This bottle poured a somewhat cloudy yellow color with a nice fluffy head. Small amount of lacing on the glass, but very active carbonaton bubbles added to the appearance. Saaz hops were very noticeable in the smell, complementing a thin, breay malt backbone. Citrus notes apparent in an inviting, fresh aroma. The excellent taste consisted of slightly bitter floral hop flavor that added a spiciness, and a subdued lemon flavor contributed to the crisp and refreshing taste. The great taste is assisted by a lighter/medium body just right for the style. Active carbonation felt good on the tongue, too. Excellent drinkability; a great ""anytime"" beer for me. It's too bad Troegs only offers this in the summer months - I'd gladly keep this one handy in the fridge year-round."
"B-B-Q and serve to your (Bud/ Coors!?!) friends!!"
"This pours out a slightly cloudy golden yellow color with an inch of white foam sitting atop. Scant lacing is left around the glass each time this one is sipped. Fresh grassy and citric hops come forth in the aroma with a strong bready malt backbone, a very clean smelling brew. There is a bit of spice to it as well. The taste start off with a malt flavor before giving way to a crisp slightly bitter citric hop flavor on the backside. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation and this has excellent drinkability. I could drink these all day very good taste and very refreshing, another great brew from Troegs."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" of white head over the clear light straw brew. Almost seems to glow yellow. Dense head, laces well. Aroma is balanced of pale malts and crisp hops, tending towards the pales slightly. Taste is well-balanced, with strong pale malts flavors, but more hops than most pilsener-styles. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. A nice pilsner-style interpretation."
"Poured a thick mountain of white head which eventually settled into a nicely thick covering. Lightly scented, crisp and clean, slight citrus and hay. Incredibly smooth tasting with just enough of a bite to be noticable. Hint of raspberry in there -but not fruity, just a reminder in the background that kinda gets your attention. Light and refreshing, very drinkable. Nice!"
"Comments  Thanks to Prostman for sending this one out my way."
"Pours a light clear yellow with nice white head, lots of carbonation bubbles rising to escape. Smells of light malt with lemons and a touch of grass thrown in with a and nice citrus hop aroma. Tastes light crisp lemon citrus flavored malt with a grainy grassy flavor. Hops leaves nice light coating in your mouth so you know you have had a beer. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing as it should be. Drinakability is is great could go threw a sixer in no time. Was debating even getting this beer do all the bad mass produced pilsner I have had in the past. Makes me wonder if Bud actually put hops in their beer it might not be too bad?"
"ng"
"It's a hopy, tasty pilsner that goes down damned smooth and crushes thirst in its path. All kinds of fun and refreshing, it's a cool combination, balancing lots to like. These go down so nice, one after another, making it not only drinkable, but stridently satisfying. Whether slow sipping or a summertime session, this is truly one to have when you're having more than one, with all due apologies to Schaefer!"
"Very well crafted summer brew. Goes down way too easy. Nice thirst quencher after a warm, sunny, day."
"Although this beer doesn't reach the stratospheric heights of Victory's Prima Pils, I won't hold that against it since I consider Prima the absolute pinnacle for the style. Sunshine Pils is still light years ahead of most of its competition though and I'd love to have regular access, especially during summertime."
"Pours and oh so pale clear golden color. Thin white head. Smell is a nice malty sweetness with more than a little hoppy aroma. Nice citrusy smell is also noticeable. Taste is just a flat out nice pils taste. There are more than a little bit of hops noticeable. This is a crisp, clean beer that isn't too heavy and isn't so over the top that a macro drinker wouldn't like this one. Wonderfully done, and a superb beer for the summer. Nicely done, Troegs!"
"Not very bitter, in fact I had expected just a bit more of a hop bite from this pilsener. No matter, it is crisp and tastes of light grassy malt. Better malt profile than you would expect. Grapefruit and lightly fruity in the finish. Not too fizzy. Well balanced. A great job on a style that is pretty easy to screw up."
"Appearance: Crystal clear golden pale note with a bright white frothy head leaves big sporadic chunks of lacing behind with each sip. Aroma: Grassy hop presence with a zesty Saaz bite to it when you get down to it very citrusy in nature nice hops semi sweet pale malts barely peek through which is a good thing. Taste: Classic hoppy pils here starts out with the citrus, grassy, and pepper notes of the hops finishes softly and a bit dry with the pale biscuit malt sweetness. Perfect blend of flavors but the hops quench my hophead desires, good stuff. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied brew with a nice fuller carbonation typical of the style, dead on this beer has character. Drinkability: Lawnmower beer all the way may just pick up a case when I get situated in my apartments this summer."
"Well, Troegs comes through yet again! As far as pilsners go, this is one that's up there with Penn, Kaiser and Prima. Light and refreshing, yet still solid, and this is one I'll likely be having again."
"troegs does it again with another quality brew. this time, they took a style i'm not so fond of and made it quite enjoyable. this one pours a nice crisp golden colour. looks nice and refreshing and has a decent sized head for a pilsner. better looking than most pilsners but nothing spectacular overall. the smell is quite nice. it's sweet and hoppy with some wheat notes. very summery. the flavour here is really incredible for a pilsner. i recently really enjoyed rogue's 12th street pilsner, but i think this one passes it in terms of flavour and being my favourite pilsner thusfar (the rogue 12th st is still damn good though). the taste here is much like the smell, sweet and hoppy, with a slight juiciness that seems to be a part of the troegs flavour, as i notice it in many of their brews. while this one strays from the traditional pilsner style a bit (much like the 12th street), it's for the better as this one is basic but complex, and just enjoyable and smooth. a great summer brew."
"Hands-down the best pilsner I have ever had. I think this beer is amazing. The gold color is quite deceiving. This ain't your average pilsner. The citrus aroma is amazing. The head is thin but lasts throughout the beer. The taste is full of citrus and it is hard to believe that you are actually drinking a pilsner. This beer has a great malt character to balance the unique hop blend. Although this pils has a light and refreshing quality, it is not light. There is a lot in this beer. I find myself being amazed by the quality of this pilsner. It is quite popular with people of varying tastes and preferences. Well done, Troegs!"
"Picked up a 1/6 keg of this today. Pours a beautiful sunny gold color with a thick powdery white head and heavy lacing down the glass. The carbonation level is PERFECT and the smell is of fruit punch, sweet malt, grassy and earthy with just a slight touch of bitter hop bite. The taste is more of the same, clean strong mellow malt backbone with smooth and silky mouthfeel with a nice crisp aftertaste. This is unbelievably drinkable... this is on my list as a top 5 Pilsner and a welcome taste after a few too many Imperial Pils over the last few weeks. I could drink this anytime, anywhere morning, noon or night --- I'll try not to though. Will this be a seasonal that turns into a full time brew for Troeg's.... God I hope so!"
"There is a slight smooth mouthfeel with some crispness at the end. There is a subtle spicy bite during the finish. The malt lasts on the tongue for several seconds after swallowing. Extremely drinkable and refreshing."
"I noticed on their website this beer is only available through August. I just purchased it about a week ago, and I assume it had been on the shelf since it arrived at the store. Perhaps with a fresher example the smell and taste categories would have been slightly higher."
"Had a soft but almost thicker than water mouthfeel, needs to be thinner me think. Nice but a bit too drying and roasty - it spent a little too much time in the sunshine."
"Rich golden color, striking clarity, and a white head that just won't quit make this an awesome looking beer. I poured this beer, walked upstairs, turned on the PC, checked the email, read some forum stuff and then looked back at the beer; still sports a 1/4"" head that must be buoyed by the very fine trails of carbonation rising through the glass. A very heavy sheet of foam is left clinging to the glass. Light peppery aroma reminds me of Pilsner Urqell, except with a hint of malt sweetness instead of a hint of skunk. The taste is light and crisp, just a little sweetness up front, then finishing pretty clean with just a touch of bitterness. Then the peppery hop notes show in the aftertaste, where a bit of bitterness creeps in and lingers as well. Mouthfeel is full and slightly creamy, as it expands on the tongue. Drinkability is very good as well. This is a good summer quencher and would go great with grilled meats. Another solid beer from Troegs."
"Troegs increased distribution in NJ has made this more readily available, and it apparently works wonders for this beer. A much larger, longer lasting frothy white head. Much less carbonation. And most importantly, the metallic aftertaste is no where to be found. Find it fresh and enjoy."
"This pours with a fine looking creamy white head that leaves a nice lacing as it subsides on top of clear deep yellow/straw colored nectar. The nose is very delicate and a bit sweet with grassy/lemony tones and a touch of flowery hoppiness as well. The taste is on the heavy end of the light-bodied spectrum, but not without substantial flavor. Notes of toast, spiciness and some grassiness mixes with maltiness, then a great hoppiness takes over, flowery and fresh. Nice bitterness level lets you know this is a great Pilsner you are quaffing. Finshes with some good hoppy dryness that fades out long and luscious...one of the best American Pils interpretations I've had yet."
"This beer poured a very bright and golden yellowish color (almost like sunshine!). Sweet grainy malt aroma with some nice grassy hopiness. The taste is very clean and crisp. There are some fruity esters detected here, along with some buttery notes. Bitterness is right on for a pilsner. Finishes pretty clean and the beer is a nice and drinkable pilsner."
"A slightly hazy, but brilliantly yellow body is topped by an exceptionally creamy bright-white head that holds well, maintains a thin and creamy surface covering throughout the glass, and leaves some very nice lace. Very tiny bubbles rise quickly to the surface from all over the bottom of the glass; adding to its appearance. Very nice! The bouquet is quite floral with grassy, lightly citrusy (lemony), and mildly spicy hops (Saaz?) over sweet grainy malt. It's clean and fresh like the morning air after a spring shower. The body is light/medium; and it's delicately effervescent carbonation caresses the tongue. In the flavor, hops ride atop a wave of clean sweet malt that's very well-balanced by a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with a lingering note of lemony hop and sweet malt in the front of the mouth, and a dusty bitterness at the back of the throat. Really refreshing, but interesting as well. Exceptionally well done and well worth trying."
"Crisp with sharp carbonation at the start. Lots of spicy hops with a touch of malt graininess. The flavor of this beer is way too laid back. It needs more malt sweetness, and it does not balance very well at all. A decent drinker for the summer, but it won't be in my fridge."
"This beer poured a clear yellow straw color that when viewed from the side you could see all the carbonation bubbles dancing around. The head that was produced was of a white cloud - fluffy and soft. It had some decent staying power that left behind a nice lace that stretched down the glass. The aromas were of hops - floral and bitter - these were the main aromas that came from the glass, also noticable were fresh flowers, citrus fruit - grapefruit, lemons, fresh grass and a semi sweet feel to it. The flavors that came from the glass were mainly hops. This is a good thing since it is a summer refresher beer. Also tasted were lemons, cirtus fruit, spices, fresh cut grass and some carbonation. The beer left an aftertaste of dry hops. Fairly crisp and clean. It is a good thirst quenching beer for the warmer days that come ahead."

"Looks like I'm in slight disagreement with the earlier reviewers, because I rather like this beer! I must admit I am quite impressed with this brewery in general. They're not going to knock your socks off with new and experimental beers, but they seem to take great care in making a good, consistent, quality product. The Sunshine Pils is no exception. Deep yellow in appearance, white fluffy head that fades to a wispy rim but doesn't completely disappear. Aromas of grass and hay with just a hint of honey sweetness. Taste also has some grass and hay, giving to a slight bitterness, then a creamy sweet finish. Really rather nice, IMO, and a very pleasant beer to drink on a hot summer day."
"Pours a pale straw color with a decent white head that dies too fast and doesn't leave a lace.  Grassy hops with some slight spice to them and a bit of corn/malt sweetness in the nose.  Slightly spicy hope presence throughout the brew, a little more grassy/hayish than spicy.  Some slight notes of DMS in the middle before the hops fade into a somewhat sweet finish.  The brew is fairly refreshing but a little bit sticky on the tongue which takes away from it.  Still a rather drinkable brew that would be a pretty good session brew for hot summer nights drinking with your macro loving friends.  Probably a good conversion beer."
"Pours a clear bright golden yellow color with a white head. On the nose there is slight hop notes, thats the only thing I picked up. On the palate good hoppiness, grassy and slight fruity citrus notes. Crisp and clean with a bitter finish. Overall a bit boring, becuase it's a Pils but as far as Pils go this is very good. I've always loved Troegs for their consistent good brews, and this Pils is no exception."
