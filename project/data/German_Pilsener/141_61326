Nose is soft pils malt,  with a a cheeky little peppery herbal from hops.  Some spice to tickle the nose.  Taste is vibrant. That soft and graceful malt rolls over the palate  with a light touch of fine golden sweetness.  The hops are leafy and herbal, peppery and lean onto the palate only whimsically with a very slight bitterness to take you in to a clean and dry finish.  Pils malt is a wry touch breaddy at the swallow and this beer was VUNDERBAR!","utopiajane","Mar 15, 2015"

The nose comprises strong grass, greens, mild biscuit, and a touch of what may or may not be wintergreen way in the distance. The taste brings in more of the same, noble-style hops really taking the fore without overdoing things. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a straightforwardly crisp finish.

Pours a bright, translucent yellow with a fluffy, two inch bright white head and copious tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap with small, textured clusters of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses a clean grassy character as well as a trace of bright citrus in the background and a suggestion of noble hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, citrus is a little more forward in the flavor profile and there's a bit more of a malt presence in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight acidity and a lively carbonation. Overall, a nice representation of the style and definitely a beer that I would purchase on a regular basis if it was added as a summer seasonal. That said, If the flavor was a little cleaner and crisper this beer would really excel for the style. Another great beer from Smutty.","Jwale73","Dec 26, 2012"

3.45,-7.3,3,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"The highlight of this beer is the mouthfeel. It's plush, silky and luxurious. I'm guessing this was decocted with love.","donkeyrunner","May 09, 2011"
3.37,-9.4,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Sampled on-tap at the Cloverleaf tavern. I wasn't too impressed with this German depiction. Spritzy, light, with a dash of lemon and honey zest but overall nothing to brag about. A good warm-weather, Summertime beer to say the least; otherwise not one of Smuttyose's best depictions.","dsa7783","May 01, 2011"
4.15,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a light golden yellow, almost see through. Bright white one-finger head. Aroma of grass, light toasted grain. Very light, crisp, compact flavor. Light sweet grass flavor. Toasty grains, yeast and sweet pale malt. Hint of spice, but like the general flavor, nothing overpowering or dominating. Very cohesive, drinkable, crisp and dry.","uustal","Apr 22, 2011"
4.33,16.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It's light-bodied and eminently drinkable lager. As for drinkability, it's amazing. Smooth, crisp, easy to drink. I wish Smutty would release Vunderbahr as a regular release as this it would be a great, gateway craft beer for non-beer geeks.","pburland23","Mar 14, 2011"
4.63,24.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I love lagers I wish my local breweries' did more. The subtle sweet bready malts along with the delicate grassy hops are delightful. I think the clean and crisp aspect of the brew make this an awesome drinking brew. The slightly drying hop finish completes it. This brew would be way to easy to drink mass quantities of. I hope to see more of this next year.","joepais","Dec 27, 2010"

3.75,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a light golden yellow with a one finger fluffy pure white head. Maintained phenomanol lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit (bananas mostly), and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, bananas, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mid carbonation. Overall this one wasn't that bad, nor was it that great. This one did have some nice flavors going on, but they were just too bundled together and didn't stand out on their own. This one is worth trying at least once, but that would be about it (for me at least).","thagr81us","Nov 17, 2010"
4.3,15.6,4,4,4,5,5,"Overall, an extremely crisp and refreshing beer that really is perfect for a warm summner day. Easily accessible yet complex. Definitely worth seeking out.","Gosox8787","Sep 20, 2010"
