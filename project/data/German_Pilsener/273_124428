The hops were definitely abundant here, and were the first thing I noticed. They provided a spicy start, and then they turned floral, and herbal. There was a creamy finish with still lingering hops and a hint of caramel. The body was soft and silky, and the beer was easy to drink. Nicely done.","rajendra82","Jun 21, 2014"
