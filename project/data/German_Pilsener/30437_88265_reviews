"Not a huge pilsner fan, but this one is bold and a nice very American take on the traditional old world style"
"Overall: Not a bad pilsner."
""
"TASTE: Lovely smoothness, fluffy moderate body, fresh maltiness, bread, grassy, nutty, spicy herbal hop, balanced bitterness, oily resin, clean palate, peppery; long, dry, hoppy finish"
""
""
""
"A good, basic pils. I think it would work great in a can on a hot day."
""
""
""

"Very cloudy, kind of tart, smells funky, almost saison-like. It's highly carbed, bitter with a twang. Honestly, this seems infected. I have another, so I'll see how that one tastes, but it's likely from the same batch."

"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and has a decent drinkable feel. There is done nice crispness here that still adds to the overall experience of this beer. This beer ended up being older than I realized but there still is something here to enjoy."

"Great pilsner!"

"Pours a straw yellow with a thin head. The smell was mild yet had a couple layers from the hops and the malt. The flavor was full of grains and then citrus and earthy notes from the hops. I found this beer very refreshing and not too heavy. A wonderful beer you can enjoy a couple without becoming overwhelmed or bored."

"(O) this is a nice beer, a little less hoppy then a Sam Adams noble pils, it's not overdone at all just a lager with some bite.  I think it was put together well.  I would drink another"

"Overall quite nice, a really well done lager, with a nice grassy hop noble hop character that turns almost American like on the finish, spicy too, with nice pilsner malts and lagering qualities. Quite nice and happy with this brewery now. Can't wait to try the others."

"Perfectly acceptable on a hot day like today. That said, Ol' Factory doesn't stand out that much to me against what else is out there for local pilsners. A bit above average."
""
"A light pilsner. Clean, crisp and more flavorful than LITE. Good beer but I prefer something were more heft."

"Overall: A nice twist on the style. All traditional characteristics are there and enjoyable."
""

""

"Light yellow, slight haze, bright white collar with some stickage. Fruity, citrusy nose, mild malt character. Moderate bitterness (stronger in the finish), a bit citrusy and herbal, solid malt base. Medium/light bodied, moderate carbonation, decent texture. Pretty good mix of characters -- dry hopping was a good call."

"Overall a very good refreshing pilsner that would make for an excellent session beer. More hops in the nose and flavor than most other pilsner beers, this one is worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Overall: Superb pilsener. Not a ""big"" beer, not a wacky beer, but a great beer. Those dudes down by the Sikorksy plant are on to something; I need to seek out more of their product."
"t/m/o - Taste is classic pils with a nice medium bodied feel. Easy drinker and a great one for the warmer weather. Pils is not my fav style but I enjoyed this one."
""
""
"Crrisp as well as refreshing... everything you'd want from your pilsner+ a little more :)"
"Overall a tasty, subtle pilsner."
""
""
"O: I found this to be an enjoyable American version of a German-styled beer. It tasted a little hoppier compared to other beers in the German Pilsener style and the hop aromas and flavors seemed more resembling that of a Munich Helles Lager."
""

"Overall: stands out as a very good beer in a category in which very good is uncommon. If you are a picky beer drinker, but you need a break from IPA'S and stouts, and its warm outside, buy this beer."

"*Overall this a solid pilsner! Nothing else to say."
"Overall: A pretty interesting take on the style, with a bit more sweetness and a totally different hop profile from what was expected"

"O - Nicely surprised with this new one out of CT. Great depth of hop aroma."
""
""

"Pours very clear bright gold. Thick half inch of white foam. Nose is light pilsy bitter. German style. Clean open firm hop that balances out. Nice blend, with a notch higher bitter than a typical pils. Crisp finish. Some citrus. Very good."
""
""
""
"Absolutely one of the best pils I've had !"
""
"Clear pale gold in the glass with a big frothy white head that is lacing a lot. The smell is a bit faint but of pale malts and spicy hops. This beer is described as a dry hopped pilsner and that seems evident by the fresh hop bite in the taste which is actually much more noticeable than I was expecting. Noble hops provide much of the base which is appropriate for the style, bitterness and hop flavor is a bit higher than normal but in a good way. The base of this beer is a pale malt providing a fresh bread taste and mouthfeel. The yeasts provide a typical lager profile mostly clean but with a touch of spice. This beer is quite lively as the result of a good dose of carbonation and the tingly hop bitterness. The finish is pretty clean with just a hint of the pale malt and slightly bigger hit of hoppy spice and bitterness hanging around. Overall I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a good example of an often overlooked style perhaps updated a bit with the extra dose of hops. This brewery happens to just a short drive from where I live so I'm excited that it looks like I'll have a good local brewer to support, something that there are too few of in CT."
"O/D-Tasty but could have been better. Not my favorite from this new brewery but its actually a pretty legit US Pils. Probably won't get a six pack for myself again however, I would buy this for a friend or take it to a gathering as it is very agreeable yet still has enough zing."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light straw color with a half inch of head. Very little lacing. The aroma is of spicy hops, grass and sweet bread. The taste is more of the same. Bready at first followed by some spicy hops. Some floral notes along with some sourdough bread. Slightly bitter. Has a bit of a sour flavor to it. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. A little hoppier than most beers of this style. Overall, its not a bad beer to grab once in awhile."

"Peppery, resinous hop bitterness up front. Spicy, noble hop flavors preside over soft, bready, cookie-ish malt. Light sweetness, but the dry, spicy hop bitterness dominates, thankfully. Moderate body with a lively, refreshing feel. A very nice addition to the CT beer scene. Will be buying more of this as the weather gets warmer."
"Cheers!"

"Taste- This beer really opens up and changes throughout the course of a sitting. It is very precise flavors, quiet dry, some serious mineral and salty qualities about it. Good balanced malt but not heavy by any means. A wonderful stank to it"
""
""
"As I mentioned, upon first appearance, this beer seemed to be a hopped up american lager. I'm glad I bought a sixer, though - I was pleasantly surprised after tasting the beer, and would say it's one of the better American pilsners out there. I've only seen this brewery's beers in one place, but will definitely be on the lookout for any other offerings, and this one again."

"This was very Euro in approach but very American style in taste. I think more people should not be afraid to gravitate to the pils. Great offering from Two Roads."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to session with for a long time."
"Overall: An above average hoppy but not overly hoppy German pils. If I am in the mood for the style, I would certainly get this. The dry hopping adds a refreshing element. That said there are others in the style I would get first."
"Entry is full, yet somewhat crisp on the palate. Lots of grain flavors, followed by a mild hop kick. Tastes a little 'heavy' for a pils, but still, very enjoyable. My wife enjoyed a full pint, and she is averse to micros. So that is saying something. I would definitely have another pint next time i see it on tap."
