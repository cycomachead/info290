"While hoppier than the average German pilsner, this actually sticks quite close to the style. And this is not a bad thing. While Pivo Pils may not be the most exciting beer, it's not supposed to be. It's just an easy to drink beer that would pair quite well with a cookout. Or snow shoveling. It's a drinkin' beer."
"O- A very nice pilsner, worth picking up it you enjoy a good pils."
"Love this one. Great pils. Tasty and hoppy but not overpowering. Nice beer taste"

"4.28/5: It's like Matt Brynildson picked my brain for everything I like in a good pilsner, and amplified those qualities 200%!"

"The first thing that hit me, (and made me smile), was the color. Stout is my preferred style of beer so I naturally drink a lot of dark, heavy, full-bodied ales. This one poured out a solid 3 SRM, which brought a smile to my face. Well done guys. Firestone Walker recommends drinking this no more than 120 days from their ""Bottled on"" date and I cracked this bottle open on day 144, (an oversight to be sure). So there wasn't as much carbonation as would be expected but it still put any of the big 3 adjunct lagers to shame. The nose was pleasant and subtle. The hops were there, but not in an in your face (Simcoe®) kind of way. My first impression of the taste was “balanced.” You can taste the hops and the malt, but neither one is over powering or competing with the other. Very light mouth feel. As a stout drinker I’m tempted to say it was watery…. But I don’t think that’s accurate. In fact when I decided to write this review I had to really focus on the style of beer I was drinking, and make sure I’m not judging it by another style’s standards. For what this beer was crafted to be, it delivers. In my humble opinion it hits all the benchmarks of a German Pilsner, (with a twist). The marketing seems to be that this is a hoppy pilsner, and while that is accurate, it is also misleading. The bitterness is well balanced in this beer. The hops are there, but I’m not sure I would define this as a “hop forward” or even “hoppy” beer. It’s a well balanced German Pilsner with some interesting layers. A very enjoyable beer."

"Very pale golden body with crystal clear transparency. Foamy bone white head sits on top and stays for the duration. Aroma is herbal and grassy noble hops with a dash of toasted malt. Flavor brings the noble hops to the forefront with lots of grassy and herbal flavors. A dash of lemony citrus and some sweet toasted malt come through. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing with some creaminess. Overall a very nice hoppy Pilsner."
"Has that floral/soapy hop thing I don't really dig that dominates but still allows for some pilsner malt flavor to come in. Good light and crisp mouthfeel."

"O: While slightly hoppier than Sierra Nevada Nooner but not as lupulin-intense as Victory Prima, Pivo hits the sweet spot as far as hop-forward, U.S.-made pilsners go.  The can format is a plus in my book as well.  Well done (as usual), Firestone Walker!"

"O-This beer is obviously not traditional or true to a pils style, but it is not a hop-bomb india pale lager disguised as a pilsner, either. Rather, it is a hoppy pilsner, just like the label says. I'm normally not one to endorse style bending, but this beer is just so damn good and easy to drink. I like IPAs, but I would drink this all day (from the can) instead of many of the IPAs out there."

"Looks very pale yellow.  Good carbonation.  Has a good bready nose, some hop spice. Smooth, clean malt flavor with a touch of those hops.  Feels light and easy drankin'.  Overall a decent pilsner."

"This may be my favorite pilsner. Rich straw color with light white foam, some lacing. Smell is straw and grassy, with the slightest hint of banana. Taste is round, and slightly fruity so the clean, crisp  finish is a nice ending. Love the hops throughout.  An especially nice pilsner for the winter months."

"O – A lot to like here, and it’s a pilsner made using obviously high quality ingredients.  Would be very enjoyable on a late spring day in the beer garden.  A bit overbalanced toward the bitter hops, but still well made."

"For fans of Czech Pilsner this is a must try! The combination of malt and hop - without being over-the-top - is unbeatable for both satisfaction and drinkability. The delicate cracker-like and slightly grassy malt may not seem that inspiring, but when you slather it in floral, spicy/peppery, and grassy hops and you get that wet-hay and lemon characteristic going on as well, it's actually fairly complex! At the very least it's not quite the same beer from sip to sip; and it's almost compellingly drinkable. Well worth seeking out!"

"On Tap at Rattle “N”  Hum.  Pours Golden with white head.  Aroma is of citrusy hops and biscuit malt.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Piney, herbal hops and biscuit malt fill the mouth.  Finish is long and bitter.  Very nice Pilsener."

"O - Great pilsener though I would have prefer more citrus notes."
""
""
"Overall: A beer that is closer to some of the great south German pilsners I had when studying abroad, but still with just a pinch too many hops. This one is definitely closer in style to the traditional examples than Prima Pils, as this one preserves are more assertive bready malt and slightly sharper lager edge. Really a fine beer, and one that perfectly fit on this Indian Summer day here in Eastern MA. Would buy again and would highly recommend for craft lager lovers."

"A nice well made pils that’s worth having again and one that would make a nice addition to the rotation of Pils beers in the fridge."

"This is the closest in every way to Tipo Pils, which I consider to be the seminal Hoppy Pils.  No, not that ""seminal"".  Firestone has hit a hone run IMO.  As an aside, I wonder if Biracifico Italiano will ever have distribution in the USA."

"This pilsner is way up there in taste, sophistication, complexity and just reeks quality.  If I didn't live in Downingtown PA (home of Victory Brewing Company) I might have rated this my favorite pilsner."

"I was anxious to get started one the cap was popped, so I nearly inverted the bottle until I had to back off. A brief pseudo-cascade created three fingers of dense, puffy, bone-white head with great retention. It later created some great lacing as it finally fell.  Color was Pale-Yellow (SRM = 1 – 2) with NE-plus quality clarity and I thought about my last stream which was darker than this! Nose was intensely grassy with just a hint of biscuit malt. This had better be identified as a Czech Pilsner! (Nope, I was offline at the time, but I now see that it is a GER Pils.) Mouthfeel was medium, but soft, as though they had tried to rein it in a little, so as not to overpower the casual drinker. The taste was definitely Saaz hops, very grassy, with just enough malt to keep the dastardly lion and his hops in Czech, I mean check. Finish was semi-dry, perfectly balanced and quite refreshing. I CAN assure you that if they were to begin CANning this beer, I would happily fill a Summer cooler with it."

"Lacks the fruity/pineyness of Victory Prima - think more of a slight peppery, herbal hop accent - but not a bad lager by any stretch."

"(3.95) O: Overall a very hoppy pilsner, good drinking with near pale/ipa hop levels. Sharp palate and carbonation, great flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall:  I really enjoy pilsners and I like mine more on the bitter side.  This is a solid pilsner.  This isn't hoppy like I might of expected from the name.  I can see where they were going by focusing on a cleaner, more floral hop character but that might get lost in other peoples minds with how common ""dry-hopped"" is being thrown around these days.  A very solid pilsner nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O - 3.5 - This is billed as a hoppy pils, but I don't find it overly hoppy for the style.  I do find the wet vegetal flavor and aromas distracting.  I am a big fan of Firestone Walker, but I think they missed the mark with this one.  Personally, I'd rather have a traditional Czech pilsner."

"March 2014. From bottle at home. Reminds me of a Czech/Spatan type beer. Slightly lighter in texture but just as robust in flavor. Aroma is more insistent than the actual flavor. Leaves one with a pleasant dryness & vague aftertaste that begs for more. Refreshing to say the least. Firestone Walker never ceases to impress me."
"OVERALL: Firestone Walker has crafted the perfect pilsner. It seriously does not get any better than this."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into Willy glass. This is a beautiful clear light-straw colored beer with a tight pure white head. The aroma is of bread and light malt - very little hop aroma at all. Taste follows with a clean light bready flavor and no hops or bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is great - a perfectly refreshing beer for a hot afternoon. Overall, this is a super clean and well done pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Very bright, straw colored golden beer with good clarity and a thin white cap head. Smell is bready malt and faint floral and citrus notes. Taste is a smooth creamy pilsner with a slightly bitter hop profile with a sharp bite that doesn't linger too long, floral dry hopping notes and some black pepper spice. Crisp refreshing mouthfeel. Overall a wonderful session lager for a beer nerds pallet."

"12 oz bottled on 04/16/14. Served in a pint glass. Beer pours pale yellow in color, not quite transparent, with a medium white head. Super pilsner hop aroma reaches across the room to smack you in the face, as if to say, ""hey, there's a pilsner here, why aren't you drinking it?"" (Note: benefits from being served in a glass.) This is apparently thanks to dry hopping with Saphir, a relative of German Hallertauer. Flavor is in line with expecations: super crisp, sharp bite of hops, though not overall particularly bitter. Finishes really dry. A great example of the style."

"Overall, a pretty decent pils. Seemed to lack on flavor a little bit. I did enjoy it, however."
""
""
"Pours golden color with very small head and mild lacing. Strong tropical fruit aroma. Malty tropical fruit taste, especially at the end. Mild hops, but cannot discern any bitterness. Aftertaste is fruity. Now this rating is based on a small sample taste at a bar. I would be willing to try a full glass to see if my rating changes. As of now, it is not really what I look for in a beer. I can see the potential for high ratings, though."

""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very light, crisp and thin, with a medium body, average carbonation and a slightly bitter finish that that trails off with some bready or grainy notes. I drank 4 of these tonight, so it's a definite session beer to me as I found it very easy to drink."

"Taste has that barley, hay-like nutty, grain profile so prevalent in many beers of this style. Pretty strong. Finishes hoppy for style, as the name indicated it would. The noble hops provide a pretty clean finish, that lasts a little into the finish. Actually, this beer is just flavorful all around for the style...both from the initial grainy, barley malt bill to the hops at the end. Very solid pils here. I was worried it would be over the top hoppy for style, but that was luckily not the case."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've wanted to pick this up for a while now, but never pulled the trigger. Today, that has changed. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly dirty foam. The nose comprises light biscuit, strong flowers, grass, and a touch of minerals. The taste brings in more of the same, those flowers and grasses really rocking things, though without singing the tongue. Nice. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather crisp finish. Overall, a solid pils, one I could easily see having more of in the future."

"D: I havent sampled too many American Pilsners I must admit but this is just delicious. Really puts Pilsners back on my radar and is starting to grow on me as a FW favorite. The body is light and crisp and it has a great hop forward flavor profile while keeping good balance. Tasting very fresh and green while satisfying on many levels. I will enjoy having this delicious and easily accessible Hoppy Pils here in California."

"Pours a clear, straw color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, slight sweet malt, pale malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of pine. Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong pale malt, hint of sweet malt, slight hops, and slight yeast. Overall, good appearance with a decent body and aroma for a Czech Pilsener."
"Overall: Not bad, really. However, there’s not enough Pilsner in this beer, really. It probably has Pils malt in it, but it’s really not easy to taste any. It’s got lots of citrus flavors, which as you read above predominate, some bitterness which are quite reminiscent of Noble hops. It feels like a Saphir hop beer with a touch of Pils flavor. If you want to make a hoppy Pilsner, the problem is, you need to start with a good Pils. It reminds me of an IPA that’s all hops and not much else. It’s basically not very balanced, and for me, I like strong flavors, even extreme flavors, but balanced means there’s more than one note being played. I’ve used Saphir, a relatively newly developed German hop that has some, and it’s got some citrus flavor to it, but not this much. Basically, you’ve got a semi-bitter, citrus infused beer with only enough Pils malt sweetness to nominally call this a good Pils. I love that they used Saphir and tried some new hops, but I’d rather a Schönramer, Mahrs, Faust or Kneitinger try it with their normal Pils. Now that would be a wow beer. I get the feeling FW should try making an outstanding Pils first, then make it “hoppy."" It's hard to score this... maybe a 3.7 of 5."

"Overall a really unique pilsner that hints at American engineered and classic style in the Czech realm. Excellent beer, and the adjective bright just keeps jumping out at me. A very wonderful, and unique hybrid. Lovely."
""
""
""
"o: I hope I run into this again."
"Overall this is a killer Pilsener. Great complexities in the hops. It may be hop-heavy but it should not scare away those anti-hop beer-lovers."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent pale yellow color with almost no head. Virtually no head. The aroma is spicy and grassy hops with some bready malts. The taste is a good amount of hops up front. Grassy and spicy hops with and nice blend of the malts and funk . Toasted malts and cut grass at the finish. A hint of lemon. Insanely drinkable. Medium amount of carbonation with a light mouthfeel. Very little alcohol presence. This makes for one hell of a summer beer. Overall, this is a hoppy pilsner worth seeking out."

"A knockout hoppy pilsner, this really hit the fuckin' spot."
""
""
"O: another great pilsener, a beer so good I continue to be shocked more people don't rate these higher ... it has all you could want: a great hop bite, some good bread malt sweetness, a smell that makes me keep shoving my nose in it and a feel that makes me reach and reach and reach for it over and over. the skunk smell will put some people off, but it shouldn't -- this is a damn good pilsener."

"Overall - This didn't last long in my glass. Very tasty and the flavors weren't drowned out by my spicy dinner."
"This is light bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. Super crisp and enjoyable. It starts off solid and gets sulfuric as it warms and loses that clean edge. Overall its still very enjoyable. Thank you Heath."
""

""
""
""

"Overall: Honestly, I was expecting a bit more, perhaps something on the lines of Prima Pils and I found this to be closer to a Euro Lager than I was expecting; refreshing, with a great mouthfeel, but not exceptional"
""
""
""
""
"The taste says Welcome to Germany or the Czech Republic because the grainy, sweet malty characters of those traditional pilseners come on strong with a modest and clean hop bite that is not floral or earthy but just there to balance it out. Yet it does not take away from the traditional German purity recipes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a long time."
""
""
""
"Pours beautifully. Clear straw with a white head. Flavor has an accent of hops, not the burst I was expecting with the label ""hoppy pilsner"" on it. But it does have a nice slightly spicy edge to it. Also a bit of an earthy tone as well. I like it. This is the best damned pilsner I have had that was made in the U.S. I can see why Todd is obsessed with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is about as good as it gets in the world of pilsners. Hop bitterness pushes the envelope but stays within the style. I'd love to explore some cheese pairing options, as this should be able to tackle bolder cheeses than the average pils. Maybe an aged provolone?"
""
""
""
""
"O-I enjoyed this. I would offer this beer to friends who aren't super entrenched in the beer world and I bet they'd like it. I could see this in my fridge again at some point."

"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Bottled on 04/03/14 indicated on the label. Pours a translucent golden-yellow with a fluffy, three-fingered bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution and adhering to the walls of the glass. Some residual textured spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is grassy and expresses light, pale, biscuity malts and a hint if lemon. Taste is crisp and clean - consistent with nose with a kiss of fruity esters and a light, residual noble hops earthy bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a crisp, nearly clean finish. Just an all around excellent Czech Pilsner. So glad to have had the chance to try this one fresh."
""
"O - Not what I was expecting, wanted a more of a IPA hop taste mixed with a pilsner feel. Instead, got mostly a pilsner."
""
""
"A very pale yellow color in the glass, aroma is citrusy mixed with minerals. A nice hoppy edge to a pils as the flavor really stands out with the traditional graininess but with loads of hops. Very easy to drink, perfect summer ale!"
""

"Lacking in floral or spicy hop notes, this beer did not satisfy. Have had from a bottle as well and did not enjoy then, either. Will not have this one again."

"Clean taste with a slightly elevated hop level. There's a good, round pale malt base with just a touch of grain. The swallow is lightly peppery but gives a moderate aftertaste. Appropriate body with an above average carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is the best, creative Pilsner interpretation i have ever tasted. Maybe this isn't loyal to the purity of the original pilsner recipes, but this might be my favorite pilsner thus far."

"I only got a single of this in a mixed six but I might have to go back to get a six pack when I see it again. The date is 12/17/13 but it still drinks very nicely and the hops still seem fresh. Subtle complexities between the malts and hops create a well crafted brew."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer at all. Not a huge pilsener fan, but Firestone created a good one and added those nice and plentiful hops."
""
""
"Overall: Yum ... simple, straightforward, crisp and refreshing. Delicious - this is a go to for this style and one I will pursue anytime."
"Definitely one of the best true Pilsner I tasted, if not the best. Balanced with a bold, not stupid, amount of hops and an elegant complexity. Huge drinkability and utterly crisp and clean taste."
""
"Pours out a pale straw with lots of bubbles raising from the bottom of the glass. Nose is clean yeast, light, cracker malts, and heaps of floral and citrus noble hops. Tastes of bready malts, honey, and, again, loads of hops. Earthy, herbal, floral, citrus. Finishes dry, crisp, and clean. Mouthfeel is bubbly and light. A perfect example of a balanced (albeit on the hoppy side), delicious pilsner."
"Overall a great pilsner, somewhat Americanized but also a little noble pilsner like, just all around well done."
""
"More exciting than most pilsners."

"The beer pours a beautiful, pale yellow/gold with a nice head of perfectly sized, egg-shell white bubbles that settle to a quarter’s finger-width above the glass and demonstrate a nice retention. In body, the beer is nearly as clear as water with no particles and a steady stream of bubbles dancing through it. On the nose, the beer smells of buttery cracker malt with a solid bitter, herbal scent with a touch of mint and fresh grass. On the very edges of the nose stone fruit can be sensed alongside fresh pine needles. On the tongue, the beer tastes superbly bitter upfront with wonderful balancing bready sweetness. Soft acidity from the hops wets the sides of the mouth and provides a very, very light pucker. There is even a soft touch of earthy salinity in the beer. In flavor the beer tastes of bitter grass and herbal hops, mellowing into a smooth butter cracker malt. The finish is blend of smooth white bread and grassy bitters with just a touch of gooseberry, salt, and a mineral-earthy flavor. This is a grassy bitter beer at heart, but it has a wonderful balance of sweet malt and mineral-like flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavy side of light in body with a creamy carbonation and a definite prickly-crisp mouthfeel that leaves the mouth refreshed and tingling with saliva in the cheek pouches and a slight neutrality throughout the rest of the beer. Overall, this is a superbly hoppy pilsner with awesome subtle complexity. The beer is refreshing and perfect to nearly session."

"A solid choice. This will be a killer summer beer. Assertively hoppy which is a good and bad thing. Loses a little bit at the end, but it's well-crafted and delicious."

"This remains one of my top pilsners, awesome beer!"

"Overall: A decent pilsner with a very slight bit of noticeable hops. For being named a hoppy pilsner I would expect to smell and taste a little more hops. Very much like Stella Artois, but honestly not made as well with the noticeable diacetyl. $8.49 for 6 pack"

" The flavor is great - bitter yet not harsh hops with a slight herbal and peppery flavor with light malt edge and mineral yeast with some floral hops and dry pilsner malt qualities with a light grassiness in the background. The overall pleasure received from this pilsner is high...very fresh hop flavor with enough bitterness to be a 'hoppy pilsner' and still have great drinkability at the same time -an excellent example of the style."

"o - Overall a decent pilsner but a bit disappointed after hearing it was great. Also was expecitng it to be hoppier based on the name but oh well, a good pilsner none the less. Easy to drink for sure."

"This stood up against Pilsner Urquell and actually won out. This beer stacks up very well with its American attempt at a traditional Czech pilsner. Wonderful hoppy notes while still holding true to pilsner notes."

"The aroma gives way to the palate pretty straightforward-ly. Malts, yeast, a bit of bitter on the back end. As mentioned above, I'm no expert on pilsners. This seems like a talented presentation of the style: generally crisp and clean. My main complaint is that there is a weird... afterfeeltastething... reminscent of baking soda/alum on the tongue. A texture that is difficult to put into words."

"This is an ok, average beer when compared to other types of beers, such as IPA's, but in the Pilsner category this is probably the best pilsner I've had, but I don't like Pilsners. Take that into account when reading this. No mistaking it, this is a Pilsner, it tastes like a Pilsner, and looks like a Pilsner, but the taste has something most Pilsners miss, and that's some flavor. Set this beer down next to a Budweiser and just by looking at it, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but after tasting it there would be no doubt. I would say people who prefer IPA's over Pilsners and Lagers will still not really like this beer, or find it average at best. However, Pilsner drinkers (Czech and German beer drinkers) will find it refreshingly better than most Pilsners that come out of the US."
"6 mos out from the bottled on date, but it's been refigerated so should still be in good shape. Hazed straw gold. Big hoppiness and bitterness for a pils, even this far out from bottling. The dry-hopping stands out with an oily grassy flavor. Complex herbal notes are nice. Malt is minimal, simple cereal notes. Dryness is spot on for the style. A solid pils that stands up well to all but the best German examples but with the west coast dry-hop twist that sets it apart."
"The beer pours a very white and clean head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The beer itself is a very clear and yellow gold. The has a strong hoppy smell that is balanced out by the sweet pale malt smell that balances the beer very well. The hop smell is earthy and certainly dry-hopped. The taste is similar to the smell but with a stronger hop taste than malt taste. The hop is as bitter as the smell. The mouthfeel is very smooth with biting carbonation. The feel is very crisp from the beginning to the end. Overall, a very good pilsner and better than some of the others that are available."

"O: It's cool to see a hybrid style displaying some of the best qualities of each. Good in it's flavor and extremely good in its drinkability. I think this is a solid choice no matter warm or cold weather."
""
""
""
"O -- While drinkable enough, clearly not what I'd call a Pilsner -- of either German or Bohemain variety. The lack of any real malt character and the resiny hop bitterness make this beer more akin to an IPA (big draw there, no?) than a Pilsner. I'm sure this is Firestone's answer to the IPL, and thus the excitement from BA members, but I'd sooner know that ""Pilsner"" on the label is giving me that style."
""
"Overall – A rather pleasant and easy drinking pils. With a slightly higher hop profile then the typical pilsner this is a nice switch up from the standard."
""
""
""
""
"Pale yellow color, crystal clear, thin white head, good carbonation, light lacing. This beer has a sweet malty aroma with a lot of hop presence. Taste is malty but the saphir hops really come through nicely in the taste as well. Nice crisp mouthfeel and quite refreshing. Overall a damn tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crystal clear, straw yellow with a large bubbled white head.  Great lacing.  Bright hoppy aroma, notes of lemon zest, dill, and grass.  Nice clean malt in the aroma as well.  Taste starts with a firm bitterness up front, moves into a spicy and juicy hop flavor, surprising for a pilsner.  Light bready and candy malt flavors move in as well, slight acidity to the finish, gives the malt a nice 'twang'.  Mouthfeel is light, beer is well carbonated, gives it a nice bite.  Overall, this is a spectacular beer, I am not to sure about this being a very authentic german pilsner, but it is certainly delicious."
""
"An unparalleled home run from the folks at Paso Robles, this is a beer that crosses off all the boxes for me. Pretty much a flawless beverage in my opinion. The hop profile may chase some folks away, but that just means there’s more for me. Awesome."

"Pours light yellow, lots of bubbles, small and sudsy head. Crystal clear. Aroma is all hops, very flowery with a dash of citrus. Taste is lemon, then pine with a bitter hop finish. Sparkly mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing. Nice left coast interpretation of a German style."

"Another excellent brew from Firestone Walker. With all the interesting competition from crazy new breweries in southern California, I'm glad to see these guys continuing to set standards for quality. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."

"hats off to Firestone-Walker again. this might have dethroned Victory Prima Pils as my favorite US made pilsner. glad to see a good lager come from the west. well done!!"

"Very good, if slightly bland German pils here...could use a bit more malt character or tweaking of the water to bring forward qualities other than a perception of cleanliness maybe, but I'm nit-picking now."
"Overall, a solid hoppy pils."

""
""

"One of the better American-made pilsners to come across my palate. At three months old, there's still a lot of life in this beer. Not only a quality beer, but one of the biggest surprises of 2013."
""
""
"O - A nicely brewed pils and very enjoyable."
""
""
"OV: A bit underwhelming, TBH. A decent Pilsner, but not as hoppy as advertised, IMO. I just didn't get enough of the Saphir hop flavour nor much spiciness."
"Firestone Walker Pivo Hoppy Pils ---3.5/5"

"This beer is worth a try and worthy of purchasing over and again."

"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams perfect pint. Appearance is extremely light with a yellow tint. White head forms and leaves considerable amount of lacing. The smell presents a heavy presence of bready grain paired with earthy and piney hops. The hops provide a significant pine and lemon quality towards the end. The taste starts with a smooth light malt profile and then followed by a heavy wave of citrusy hops which present lemon zest, grass, and toast. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this is exactly as advertised: a hoppy pils. The bite at the end is strong which detracts from the refreshing qualities of this brew, but a nice pilsner nonetheless."
""
"A smooth tasting, clean and refreshing classic pilsner. This one will definitely have a spot in my go-to lager/pilsner purchases."
"Excellent all around pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, which results in this foaming up modestly on the palate quite quickly, yielding a soft, smooth mouthfeel that fits the beer and style well. Closes quite dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate or lips."

"Overall: I think Firestone will get its loyal fans hooked on the design and the hoppiness, but not me, sadly. And I'm not a Firestone hater, by any means! I just bought two bottles of their new Double DBA release and LOVED it (the first bottle, I mean; the second is for aging). I just don't feel the need to buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- while better then your run of the mill pilsner it still leave a good amount to be desired in my opinion, then again I am not a huge pilsner fan. I was hoping that this would be the pilsner to change my mind about the style, maybe I'll try the Victory Prima Pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really an interesting approach to the style. Not sure that the classic pilsner drinker would appreciate this beer, but a great twist. If you are a hop head and are looking for a great summer alternative that is at the upper end of sessionable, you should give this beer a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very smackable beer, light and refreshing, perfect for summer. Glad FW came out with a lager that is world class!"
"O: Probably my next summertime keg. Well done!"
"O- A really great hopped up pilsner that is refreshing and flavorful. Definitely a beer I would get again on hot summer day like today. Right out there with Prima Pils for hoppy pilsners."
""
""
"A good tasting beer, a bit too much hops for a pivo pils. Still, it isn't overpowering. Spice and grassiness are at low levels. Malt is very thin. Nothing bad with this beer and would rate it higher if hops were tamer."
"Pours a yellowish sandy golden with a white head. Aroma is cereal graininess, lemongrass, and actual grass. Flavor pretty much followed suit. A thinner, active mouthfeel. Overall, a solid beer. Not really a style I am usually into, but did enjoy this one all things considered."
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid beer that definitely mocks the post-Prohibition American “pilsner”. Definitely worth at try- or just grab a six pack."

"12oz bottle, bottled on 6/10/13, pale golden color with a fizzy, white head that fades to a foam atop the lager beer.  Aromas are pilsener malt, grassy noble hop, spicy, slight fruitiness, faint chardonnay.  Tastes are bold with a nice toasty grain flavor initially along with biscuit, grassy hop, pilsener malt, finishing pungently semi-bitter (if that makes sense) & it lingers.  Light-to-medium body, abundant carbonation.  Hoppier than the usual German Pilsener, but it is acceptable since they do announce it on the label. I like it!"

"o: thumbs up. ale drinkers should not fear when drinking this beer. nice session beer - this beer combines nice flavors with a good drinkability. the sweet flavor is balanced bit a slight tang and mild bitterness. nothing over the top, yet flavorful."
""
""
""
""
"O: Polished off a 6 pack off this right damn quick. There are some tremendous pilsners being brewed in the USA at this point and this is another of them. Drink fresh and soon."

"The Verdict: Good beer. Not your average pilsner, this hoppy brew almost ventures into IPA territory. Pils purists may not be happy but hopheads may find a new favorite."
""
""
"O – Overall, this is a huge surprise for me from an excellent brewery who is known for bold and heavy flavors. The fact that they took a beer that is so tough to brew and made an excellent example of this only speaks to how good a brewery FW really is. This is now officially replacing Prima as my go to pils. I plan on keeping an ongoing rotation of this in my fridge all year round."
""
""
""
""
"This is great stuff, and absolutely perfect for the warmer weather. Pilsners are hard to make, especially in this caliber, and it's remarkable that a brewery like FW churned one out, of all breweries. Could be my new favorite American made offering in the style. I will be buying more six packs of these for sure."
""
""
"The body was crisp, clean, light and refreshing. Drinkability was excellent, several would go down easily. Overall, an excellent brew. This could be the craft beer with the reach to truly start getting mainstream AAL drinkers into better beer."
""
"A very good pilsner, crisp and refreshing but it also has some heft to it. Tasty and easy to put down, nice to see Firestone add a lager to the line-up, they did their quality and brand justice here."
""
"O: A pretty good hoppy pilsner. I've wanted to try this one for a little while and finally got around to picking it up today. I'm a little disappointed, but mostly on the back of very high expectations for FW brews. This is another good one from them, though, if I do my best to decouple my expectations and my actual experience."
""
""
"O: Cold, this is a light, refreshing, highly drinkable brew. Warmed it had even greater character. Either way, a real class beer from a real class brewer. Fans of German pilseners will probably enjoy this tremendously."
""
"Bottle picked up locally the other day. Enjoyed from a Firestone walker snifter. brew pours a transparent straw yellow with a thin fizzy head that fizzled away kind of quickly leaving some fizzy patches on the surface. Smells of crisp hop. Taste is classic pilsner with some subtle bitterness on the finish and soft fruit notes on the top. toasted german malts. Easy drinker and nice pilsner. Not my favorite style but a great representation if the style."
"Hop-forward, but still balanced, this is a nice take on a German pilsner without straying too far from the classic style. Very easy drinking, but with a complex flavor profile."
"The palate opes quite crisp, with a pleasant, modest hoppy bitterness that's a blend of earth and lemon. Mineral character is low, accentuating the soft malt character, the mild DMS and unfortunately, the soap. Medium-light in body, moderately slick on the palate, this beer lacks the bitterness it needs to fully tie it together. Carbonation is high but quite creamy and pleasant. A touch watery on the finish, along with a little citrus, this beer is quite decent."
"This poured with an amazing clarity as true to form. Golden straw in color it has a light grassy hop aroma which I love in a fresh pils and flavor just about everywhere. Crisp, clear, and with a bright, clean finish. It’s everything I want in a pils. Until I get back to Texas."

"the much hyped new beer drinkers pilsener from firestone, it didn't blow me away, ill say that. on tap at the new renegade publik house, it pours a perfectly clear, watery golden color, with an inch of white head that slowly dies. the nose is not nearly as hoppy as the press release declared, but I do get a bit more than the standard. American barley malt, on the light side, balanced. it is refreshing, but the hops don't quite take away the sweetness of the malt. very little bitterness to this, only a mild hop flavor, maybe leaning on the floral side, but this certainly does not redefine the genre as it was supposed to do. its plenty drinkable through, these go back like water after a jog. the body is ultra light, and the carbonation is robust. it just tastes like very other craft pilsener, there is nothing new or special about this one. too simple for me to get off on, but its well made like all firestone beers, but ill stick to their solace for summer time, assuming that one comes back around..."

"Light yellow golden body with a one-inch foamy white head that faded into a faint collar. Complex spotty lace was left down the glass. The nose is light with hints of cracked grains and earthy hops. Clean overall. The taste follows the nose with earth hops, a touch of sweet fruit citrus, faint bubblegum yeast, and crisp minerals. Crispy clean medium body with even carbonation. A solid pilsner. Could be dryer but its got a great flavor."
""
""
""
""
"An excellent example of the style. Amazing in its simplicity, and incredibly enjoyable. One of the best lagers made in the US, and I am glad I can now get a six pack pretty much whenever I want."
"Overall - Really good pilsner. Maybe not as hoppy as advertized? Still, clean and flavorful. I'd definitely drink it again, and again, and again."
""
"Edit: Tried from the bottle and enjoyed it more."
""
""
""
""
"Thin, prickly body that wasn't satisfying to drink. Simple pils flavor but lacks the drinkability of a classic example. Also lacks the complexity and full body of a Prima. Overall forgettable, like a generic brewpub blonde. It isn't badly made, but there are a number of other pale lagers I'd go with first."
""
""
""

"Overall: My favorite american pilsner, and one of Firestone Walker's best beers. This one sets the bar. Great pairing with so many foods, great for a hot day, and the perfect beer for floating around a pool."

""
"Drink- This was good. I really enjoyed this one. Hopefully the bottle version will be as good next year."
"Very good for a pilsner and a great start for my first Firestone experience (in Paso Robles)."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and hay. Taste is much the same with a mild herbal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and very easy to drink."
