"Not a bad drop from a country not usually associated with beer. Try it!"
"Light, sweet, very carbonated and broke the style mold...I would buy again...refreshing..."
""
"Enjoy"
""
"Can: Poured a light yellow color pils with a medium white foamy head with light retention and light lacing. Aroma of light sweet adjunct notes is pretty bland. Taste is also dominated by sweet adjunct notes with limited character. Body is light with good carbonation. Just another bland adjunct based pils."
""
"*I don't know if this beer being a little over 2 years past the ""Best By"" date has had any affect on the beer itself, but I wouldn't buy this beer ever again. I think Carlsberg and Heinkein have this beer beat hands down in flavor and drinkability. If for some crazy reason I decide to buy Efes Pilsner again, it would be to see how a fresher bottle tastes. But this stuff is on the verge of being gross."

"Very average beer. Drinkable.  Not bad, but nothing special."

"Golden malt round flavor, weak head, pleasant effervescence"
"With the dozens of supposedly European beers around, Efes stays one of the best imported beers, with a soft feel on an amazing taste and alcohol content."

"Endured across my honeymoon in Turkey.  Did not like, was not impressed.  Tried repeatedly, and found myself questioning my order each time--oftentimes the only beer on the menu, so what are you going to do?  Better than raki, but that's saying very little.  Too sweet, too yeasty, no body, no smell . . . the best thing I can say is that it poured a nice light golden color, and had a foamy head."

"In bottle. Have nothing against beers that has a rich taste of yeast, unless there are other flavors in the beer, which this Turk is obviously lacking. Smells nice, but the taste is not as good as the aroma."

"pours a clear gold color and shows very little head. The aroma is very light and maybe getting a touch of hops?. the flavor is malty and there is a carbonated fizziness that shines through. Overall, a decent beer but lacks a little more boldness in the flavor. Not bad for a Turkish beer !!"
"mundane Pilsners except its $10.00 a six pack price tag."
""
"Overall - I think a wonderful example of the style of beer. Top class and glad I have another bottle."

"O- Sweet pils, lager. It's really nice."

""
"Overall, a very pleasant surprise, and one I certainly wouldn't say no to if it popped up somewhere here in PA."
""
"OVERALL: Definitely still a quality pilsner, and one of the better examples of the style. If this style were held in higher esteem, this brew would get a lot more press. It's not quite the same drinking this at age 34 on a cold, rainy afternoon as it was ten years ago in the Turkish sun, but quality is quality, and it's just as good as I remember it. Give it a try with an open mind."

"The taste is initially slightly on the sweet side, followed by a nice and refreshing bitterness. The finish is hoppy and bittery. The taste is light, but not watery. Very drinkable and extremelly refreshing."

"Great lager beer found in Turkey and you can taste over 80 countries"
""
"O - this was actually pretty decent and better than i thought it was going to be. i would be content drinking this although i didn't really get much hop character and i felt it was a bit odd as a german pilsener"
""
""
""
""
"This would be a good beer on a hot day. It would also be good for when you did not want something complex to drink about. Given the colour and taste, this would serve as a good beer to transition friends away from ""regular"" beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"It went nicely with food as well. Efes brings back fond memories of being young, being somewhere exoctic, and having a really good ""go to"" beer to wash down lamb kebobs or sea food on the Med coast. Ive never seen it since but would buy it if I did. It was Efes that started a lifelong love of Pilsner for me. I sure hope its the same now as it was back in 1978."
""
"O - Turks drink the hell out of this beer and, relative to the light lager a stereotypical American consumes, this brew is a win. By no means memorable, this dominates the 'norm' back in the states."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: NOT BAD. Truth be told I was a little apprehensive about this brew but I would definitely take one if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, and taking into account that it's just a mass-produced pils I don't think it's too bad at all. But please remember to read this review in the context of the Beer Desert that is North Cyprus."

"Overall/Comments: This was and average beer overall that really didn't stand out in any way at all. Very light not overly filling. Glad I tried this Turkish beer to broaden my horizons. Classified as a German Pilsner @ 5% ABV. Consumed 4/24/2013."
""
"A highly drinkable Euro lager, good flavor, easy going and refreshing. Definitely a good brew to throw back with some spicy eastern Turkish food."
""
""
""
"O- This beer has a nice Pilsner smell but that doesn’t translate at all in the flavor. It is very clean and washed out."
"Above average adjunct lager, crisp, clean and refreshing. If you like the style it is definitely worth a try."
"Give it a pass!"
""
""
""
""
"a better than average euro beer, I think my first from turkey. the pour is clear golden pee colored with a lively white head that actually has pretty good retention. the nose is extract and adjunct, like a crappy lager, but the yeast is different and richer, some potential here. the flavor is very clean and crisp, neat and tidy. lacking the malt profile of a traditional pilsener, this is more of an adjunct sort of malt beer, but there is some decent hopping towards the finish, a light semisweet fruitiness, and an easy drinking character that's enhanced by great carbonation and quite a bit more body than most of these have. I would have preferred a beer that speaks to the dynamic Turkish culture, one with a touch of east and west flare, but I will settle for a better than average euro brew. not bad, especially when ice cold."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as the taste is concerned, this hits the style pretty well. Not overly flavorful, but it is crisp and quenching. Maybe a touch overcarbonated, which affects the finish somewhat. High drinkability here, much higher than the origin or packaging would have you believe. Competitive with most of the better German and Czech examples of the style."
""
"Highlights in addition to the musty aroma and the corn and cereal malt notes include the sweetish flavor, off finish, and just all-around ‘moral of the story is drink something else’ of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a great example of a German pils, but passes as an easy drinking euro pale lager."
""
"o - Overall I did not think this was a great beer, though not the worst. Smells and taste slike sweet plum wine with a hint of skunkiness in the taste; wouldn't seek it out again. A pretty average beer overall."
"Pretty average overall."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Not absolutely sure this is the Efes pilsner. It came in a squat 500 ml bottle that only says ""Efes Beer"". The ABV is correct and it appears to be a light pilsner type adjunct beer. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipaters quickly to a ring around the glass. Light aroma of biscuit and grassy malt, hint of hops and corn sweetness. Taste is very light biscuit malt, slightly sweet with a faint wisp of hops in the finish. No off flavors, but very attenuated flavor. Light bodied with nice carbonation. This would be adequate if nothing else was available, but otherwise a typical mass produced bland commercial beer. I hope I can try something a little more exciting from Turkey next time. An unexciting, but drinkable beer."

"Raw grain start but the hop bitterness comes quickly and strongly. Surprisingly flavorful. Raw grain finish with a good peppery bite. Full body and a high level of carbonation."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer since it’s a relatively good German pilsener from Turkey. I wouldn’t mind drinking this beer again sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale straw colour with a rather generic, sweet, inoffensive nose. The beer itself is surprisingly flavourful and tangy, slightly bubblegummy, with enough hop strength to feel like a proper beer. Not outstanding but much better than I had anticipated."
""
"Overall: Quite a good standard pilsener. Doesn't try to blow its trumpet too hard - just a good quality, refreshing beer for a good price (AU$43 a case in 2012)."
""
"Translucent golden yellow with good carbonation. Smell is musty and not very appealing. Taste starts good but progresses to an unpleasant finish, has insightful corn and floral hop tastes. Feels average in the mouth but the taste does not make me want to come back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this beer on September 14, 2010 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent pale gold colour with topns of effervescence and a thin white head which quickly dissipated to a ring. The aroma was corn, grain, and a hint of floral hops. The mouthfeel was weak to medium bodied with a medium carbonation. The flavour was acid, metal, grain, with an offputting bitter finish."
""
""
"I tried it from a can, it will most likely taste different from a stubby."
""
"O: Not a terrible beer, but not particularly memorable either."
""
"O: Just a run of the mill Euro lager, people drink it like crazy here in Istanbul, and I'll probably drink a few more while I'm here as it's really hard to find anything else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"This is a decent beer. Lightly malty, smooth, drinkable, but ultimately forgettable."
"Taste isn't too surprising upfront...cereal grains are certainly present...it's somewhat sweet. I also detect a bit of nuttiness there as well. What does surprise me is that I basically get no hops, which I would expect to taste in a pils. That's pretty disappointing. Just another average Euro lager as it is....I suppose worth the novelty to buy because it's Turkish and you don't see a lot of beers from Turkey."
""
"First beer I loved so much, named my dog after it. Poured into pilsner glass, good head that dissipated quickly. Skunkier than I remember it being when I first had it years ago. Little lacing, but bubbly. Effervescent on the tongue like an Alka Seltzer. Clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer but overall average. A pretty good job by a country not known for beer making. I would consider getting it again."
""
""
""
"A fairly standard lager - bland and uninteresting. Rather stale; perhaps this bottle is a bit old. Probably goes down well in hot weather, but I can't think of any reason to chose this unless there is no alternative."
""
"O - A pretty poor pilsener in my view so drink cold."
""
""
""
""
"The aroma was weak, but had the right parts to it with a clean lager yeast and honey dipped malt aroma that also translates in to the taste, but the taste has much more body and the flavors are bright and quite easy to place. I really enjoyed the sweeter notes, not as dry as most pilsners and not overly bubbly either. It was overall solid and very drinkable and paired well with the lamb and rice dish I had. A nice beer!"
"Overall, this is a slightly better than average lager! I'd get it again."
""
""
""
"O-Refreshing,nice lager."
"O: Overall would drink this again, had this when I was working in Turkey about 3-4 years ago and like it very much. Great to see it in the US .Very refreshing.Not the typical Pilsner."
"Nothing great or bad, just average overall."
"Final Grade: 3.16, a C+."
"Overall: Try it. It's good but it's got an obvious amount of adjunct rice in it, as it says right on the label. It's reflected in the taste giving it something the others perhaps don't have in the overall flavor. That said, it's worth trying and if you like the sweet corn taste, you'll like it and go back for another I'm sure. For me, I'll try another but never make a night out of this beer."
"bottle courtesy of my friend hammer. new country sampled to boot. pours a straw yellow, fizzy white head that disappears quickly. nose is neutral. taste is crackery sweet, corn balanced by grass. the local skunk stops to say hello. mouth is light and crisp. an interesting take but none the less yellow fizzy crap."
"It's very rare I meet a beer I won't finish, although I still hope to try this again one day on the other side of the pond!"
"Anadolu Efes Brewery produce this beer in for 3 regions. Turkish local market, russia and europe. Main problem is, they use glucose syrup (made from corn) and rice on the turkish version. This makes efes pilsener is not an officially a beer. it's just something else. But they cannot use that formula for their russian nor european products."
"Overall: This is actually a really nice beer. I was blinded by the stereotype of the classic ""national mass produced lager"" but I was extremely pleasantly surprised with this. Not the greatest beer ever but its very nice to drink. High marks for the style"
"O: A standard German Pilsener, nothing more, nothing less."
"I'm pleased to say how surprised I am by this beer. Who would have known Turkey could produce such a solid pilsener?"
"Overall, not bad, one of the better pilseners I've had in this country."
"O: A decent choice on a thirsty day in the sun, and I can imagine having Efes with salads, pasta dishes, grilled pork... or dare I say turkey?"
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch puffy white head that settles to a thin film. Nice distinct rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bread/biscuit, honey, tea, and some prune aromas. Taste is very bready/biscuit-like with a distinct tea and tannin flavor. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a surprisingly good pilsener from Turkey. Until I joined BA I didn't even know they had beer from Turkey. Good stuff."
"Trying a beer from Turkey that I have heard was decent...and its not bad. The labeled is a Pilsner....but it can be thought of as an American Adjuct Ale as well...sort of along the same family....I suppose. Pours a nice head that doesn't last too long. Color was clear and golden. Smell some malt and hops not too complex. The taste is light with spice and malt flavors and a bit of hops after taste. The mouth feel is fuller then you might expect. I can't call this an outstanding beer, but it is good enough to have again."
"Overal this is a good lager for the summer. I would drink this again and I will try to find this when I go to Italy this summer."
"medium light body"
"D - Decently drinkable but this really isn't much of a Pilsner."
"It was good for the experience but certainly not a go to beer."
"Overall - I really wasn't expecting much here but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. This is surely one of the better pilsners I've had from the lcbo. I'm going to pick up a few more of these to keep for the summer incase it disappears from the lcbo shelves. It will be perfect for the warmer summer months."
"D: Surprised me, nice German Pilsenser. This is good, but not exceptional. If you get a chance to try a beer from Turkey, this is a fine one to sample. Great summer/import brew to sip on."
"Turkey is where so many of the world's cultures, both past and present, collide into one another. Somehow, however, they missed hitting the beer. It is ironic that a place so rich in cultural heritage, one that stretches across two continents and is bordered by eight distinct countries, should have such a characterless, uninteresting national brand. But it's really not all that surprising: Efes is a reflection, not of its country, but of its market."
"I had this beer with a Iskander Doener Kebab, and this was a great match."
"d-very drinkable. Something you could offer guests and they wouldn't mind it at all."
"Pretty good pilsener, nothing more, but nothing less"
"Not impressive but drinkable. Given the options in Turkey this will have to do."
"Pilsners are a tricky brew for me to review, especially mass-market ones, because they really seem to taste identical to one another. Hard to praise, oh so easy to slam. In this case, however, I found Efes Pilsner to be a very drinkable little brew, something I would gladly have several of in a single session. While it may be a bit sweet and lacking in a bold hop presence, there still isn't much wrong with it, which for a cheaper import brew I have to give credit. If you just want a good-tasting brew from country you wouldn't normally associate with beer (and to knock another country off your list), Turkey's Efes is certainly a fine way to go."
"Taste is all carbon dioxide and no hop or any beer like characteristics at all. Weak... extremely watery and wet, like a typical macro chemicaly laced to death. Finish disapates and disappears instantly leaving you gaseous. After having one that was all I ever wanted. Really not that great but I know I've had worse..."
"Pretty good for a Turkish Pilsener."
"Drinkability: If drunk cold on a hot day an Efes Pilsner would go down pretty well, certainly a lot better than most macro-lagers available in South Africa."
"(Also reviewed on my blog; http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com)"
"Nothing interesting but certainly not a terrible offering and hey its from Turkey how often do you see that here."
"D - Standard fare. Nothing to write home about, and drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: I could down another at this price, but would I really want to? I will say that this beer tries to do some interesting things and I'd have no hesitation to reach for Efes' other offerings on that basis, but this beer isn't built like a pilsener needs to be."
"Drinkability is decent with crisp lager and dry with no sticky finish. Pretty sessionable."
"Pours a clear yellow colour that starts with thick white head, but it dissipates fairly quickly without any lacing. Smells of sweet grainy malt and faint grassy hops. Flavour is pretty small, but pleasant enough. Nice carbonation level and easy to drink."
"Drinkability is low, hard to find, better things are cheaper and easier to find."
"But it was kinda boring, and even with the good setup, it did not shine."
"Not a beer I would pursue, but not one that I'd send back, either."
"The Crack 'n' Glug only resulted in a foamy, bone-white head that hung around as long as my last girlfriend, who bolted as soon as I suggested something not on the menu. Hey, baby, it's only kinky the first time! Where ya goin'?!? Awww. Color was one (yellow) step above water or a near cousin to urine. Pale? Like Casper the Ghost! Nose was about right for the style with an initial malty sweetness underlain by the Noble hops. Hmmm. Mouthfeel was thin and watery but the taste was not unpleasant, which was what I was girding myself against. Instead, it was an oddly light malty flavor, semi-sweet but very light in its execution. Finish was likewise light, unobtrusive, even ethereal. How CAN I hate on something that was barely there? This was like MAJ Major's description of chocolate-covered cotton balls. Light, fluffy, etheral, you would hardly know that you were [drinking it]. Hoo!"
"Pale yellow, no cap to speak of, aroma of wet cardboard, tastes sweet uneventful, flat with all the insipid dextrin sub compounds. Total extract beer brought up to gravity with dextrin syrups. Complete shite! Quite possibly the worst pilsner I ever tasted, certainly one of the worst beers I ever tasted."
"Drinkability - Although I don't have anything against the taste of this beer, it just tastes like a nasty hangover waiting to happen."
"Drinkability is just so-so. It's not awful, but it's not very good."
"Forget this beer if you want to drink something special."
"Overall - while it was fun to try a Turkish beer this didn't really do much for me, good only in the heat."
"D: Great crisp and sweet lager to relax to."
"Didn't know what to expect from a Turkish beer, but this one's not bad at all. No alcohol taste and it goes down easy. I would have had another had they not been charging $7 a bottle for it."
"D: It could work on a summer day but, if you can find a good Urquell or Czech Budweiser Budvar, this could be a good reason to not buying this one..."
"You could drink this, there is nothing wrong with it. But even for a cheap Eurolager, this is not the beer that made Novi Sad famous. Label doesn't actually say it is made at the Serbian brewery, and lists ""Anadolu Efes Brewery, Istanbul, Turska"" as well. The Taliban strikes again!"
"Lackluster beer overall, with a taste that is mildly unpleasant. Not very drinkable."
"Cheers!!"
"D - Well I have to admit I bought this just out of joking curiosity from a wonderful kebab stand. And I was pleasantly surprised. This is surprisingly drinkable. I enjoy this more than i imagined I would. Mostly because the pilzner hops are cut back and other flavors of the corn barley and local water come out."
"I doubt I'll drink this one again it's nothing special don't go looking for it"
"D: This goes down very quickly and with little fuss because there is so little to savor. However, I've had this on tap and in bottles before and it was quite a bit better. Perhaps this particular bottle was just a bit too close to it's sell-by date."
"I was really pleased with this and I'm sure I'll get it again. A bit of on the sweet side, but it is great just having a pilsner without any skunk."
"A decent beer for a warm day, could go with a standard hamburger. But isn't this really an adjunct lager?"
"I'm not reaching for this one over a Prima, but I'm not downright rejecting it, either. I'd have no problem trying this one again or having a few in a session."
"This might be a Turkish made beer, found at the LCBO, bit efes in another language means nothing, and that is the extent of it. Pale yellow lager, with some white foam. Cheesy aroma. Light, almost astringent mouthfeel. Not very drinkable, but not the most horrible beer I have ever tried."
"D - Pretty easy drinking. Manageable ABV. Flavors are are just a bit ""in your face"" to consider this a long session beer."
"This is a decent beer, with a mediocre head, that is quickly reduced to the top of the beer. Very drinkable, and light this beer is a good start for Turkish beer. Nothing fantastic, but a decent beer to serve for something different. I suggest to serve this chilled, and paired with spicy food. This is a good beer to have around when you want to impress your co-beer lovers of something new."
"Is a must have and must try Pilsener? Nope! Is it a bad Pilsener? Nope! it's one of those beers in case you ever want to try a beer from a country that you don't usually see a lot beers come from. If you want to do that, then yeah! Pop open an Efes. It's not going to cost you much."
"Poured a clear yellow with a modest head that rapidly reduced to a collar. The aroma was free of the skunky smell I associate with a lot of lager/pilseners, but had little else going for it. The taste was malty sweet with a light lemony taste at the back of the throat. The feel was light bodied with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was good. The light lemon flavor I perceive sets Efes a little apart from it's counterparts in style."
"Overall there is worse beers out there, there most definitely is, but its got nothing that makes me believe I'd buy it again."
"A drinkable brew, this beer is thirst-quenching and decently tasty."
"Had this at Pasha in Arlington, MA. Marvelous food. On a menu that featured Bud, Miller, Coors, etc., this was about the best beer I could find. But that's speaking relatively. Thin, watery, aromaless and one step sideways from the average Indian lager. Feh! Better than water, but not by much. Stick with Pasha's excellent Turkish coffee."
"A less than adequate old(er) world pilsener - the lack of clean crispiness here being the utmost dead giveaway. Add in some pithy cheap graininess, and the deal is (un)done. Maybe somewhat agreeable if it was ice-cold, and you are sweating under the Mediterranean sun, but otherwise, not worth any serious Pilsener fan's time."
"Drinkability: as a tasty pilsner, I could drink this stuff like water."
"Not something that would stand on its own in the eyes of a discerning beer drinker, but something that would go well with meat on the go."
"Taste: Maltier than I thought it would be. Definitely a good and enjoyable pils."
"Pours a light golden with a fairly decent sized white head that is a couple inches to start and sticks around a bit before fading to a thick ring. Smells light, somewhat grainy, quite soft. The taste is also soft, somewhat grainy, a little nutty. Not bad, but on the very soft side for a German Pilsner, and without the flavor profile of a softer Czech Pilsner. Still, noticeable Pilsner taste, unlike a vapid Euro-lager. The mouthfeel is also soft, rather than crisp, but with a light bitterness in the finish. Nott terrible."
"D - Can't deny that this pilsner has a thirst quenching quality, that I find is common to German pilsner. However, I don't think the Turkish have quite nailed the taste and feel that you get from the German brewed pilsners."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild, grainy smell. Taste is crisp, somewhat hoppy, slight bitter finish. Decent in the mouth and very drinkable. Overall this makes for a pretty good brew."
"D: Well since there is nothing else I keep drinking them. It is nothing to write home about though."
"But the mouthfeel is full but light, which is refreshing, and it washes down Turkish food nicely. I can't complain too much."
"D- Not sorry I tried it but wont be picking it up again. Pretty easy to drink though."
"Honey hued apperance and cloudy. No lace or head and an abesence of bubbles. The smell is yeasty and pungent alchol aroma. The taste is delicious. Very mellow taste of vanilla and syrupy nectars. Suprisingly tingly even though there was the absence of carbonation in the apperance. Tingled the entire mouth especialy the tip of the tounge. Mouth feel was a strongpoint. Upon the first sip my mouth was so overjoyed that i wanted more and more."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both average. Not a bad beer, considering it's a German-style pilsner from Turkey. It's not tremendous, but it is decent."
"Crystal clear honey yellow with a fluffy finger of foam that leaves fine lace behind. Smells of noble hops, toasted grain and a whiff of lemon. Tastes mildly hop forward and grainy, finishes squeaky clean. This beer is crisp and light bodied. Nothing special here, a good lawnmower beer."
"Pours light golden with a one finger white head. Decent retention and laceing. Aroma is sweet and grassy. Body is light and carbonated.Taste is of bread and butter up front. Sweet,but with a bit of grassy hops in the finish. The Turks can brew some beer!"
"D: Pretty good overall. A fairly solid Euro light lager."
"This is quite smooth but maybe a touch too sweet for me."
"D- Meh. It's a pretty average German Pilsener. I don't see myself looking for this one again."
"D: Not great, not great at all. I was worried what a beer from Turkey would taste like and it looks like my fears were justified."
"It is very drinkable and smooth, but not tasty."
"D - Sessionable, in the same way Bud Light is."
"Had at Cafe Istanbul at Shops at Legacy in Plano. Served in a glass from a bottle so missed the initial head and aroma. It was a clear light yellow in color with some carbonation and light lacing. It had the typical pilsener aroma but not quite as strong which was good for me as I tend to not like the overly skunked ones. The taste was good. Not as bitter as most. Overall, a good middle of the road beer. Wouldn't ever buy a sixer of it but would have again at the restaurant."
"The taste is like the taste from the bottle or can but cleaner, freshr, more aromatic, with clean, strong grain taste throughout, hints of apple and herbs, a light herbal hop bitterness to balance out the light sweetness and give a crisp, clean finish."
"easily drinkable..."
"Pours a yellow clear colored body, with a huge bright-white head with big bubbles. Effervescent malty aroma. Watery taste with a malt taste. Acidic aftertaste. Very watery witn little flavor. Tastes like flavored fizzy malt water. Not Good."
"This actually tasted close to a Euro Pilsner. Crisp and carbonated with a nice bitterness to it. I wasn't in love with the aftertaste. Not a great Pilsner, but better than you might expect."
"D- very refreshing, would be a great summer day beer , low abv"
"Very drinkable, however. I didn't hate it, and can imagine drinking it in the summer. But given my other choices, I doubt I would."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, not one of the better that I've had in the style, but I suppose it would be a viable option if I didn't have much to choose from."
"D - Not a bed effort. I feared it would not be so good but it actually had a good flavor and no skunkiness."
"I had this in a snifter while at a club in Istanbul. The color is amber with a very thin head, which is not at all how a German Pilsener should appear. This beer doesn't have much of a smell and it goes down very smooth without leaving any negative after-tastes in your mouth. I actually thought it was closer to a lager than a Pilsener in taste. For a country and region that is not known for producing much beer, Efes stands out."
"Drinkability: You could make a night of this... sessionable both in ABV and taste. Light enough to consume in large amounts, but tasty enough to make you want to,"
"This is a beer I would see a lot while I was in Germany and it is well suited to Turkish Food. It honestly is not a bad beer. Taste is a little bit different but not bad. It has a transparent yellow body with tiny bubbles in it. The head and lace are both very nice. The head is just right and lace is not frothy. It is thin and stays on the side of the glass the whole way down. It smells of sour fruit and grass. The taste is straw like and earthy with the same little bit of sour fruit. There is a gentle sweet and bitter blend as you start to drink more. It has a light body that goes so well with a Donner Kebab."
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a medium white head. The aroma is full of grasses, some sweet malts, honey and some floral hops. A very clean flavor, oddly though I can detect a good bit of alcohol. Crisp malts, some apples and floral hops. A fairly dry finish. Somewhat fruity and a decent flavor. Not bad."
"It was an early evening and looking over my choices I remembered the beer guy saying that this Efes Pils would be the best beer I ever tried. He was ultimately wrong on that suggestion, but did get it right that I would enjoy this pils and be able to fully appreciate its pure golden color with a very thin, but active head. Lots of carbonation were dancing in the golden liquid to fuel this head. I bet each little bubble has a great story to tell about its short existence. The smell is a little boring in that its a floral scent is plain. The taste is not all that hoppy, but does support the scent in bringing to life a small piney taste. The lack of bitterness really makes this pils an enjoyable beer. Well that and the light body that the liquid presents. Enjoy this one because it will be gone fast."

"A good, but not great beer. Would go well with most foods, especially spicy ones."
"Pretty solid Pilsner from a country that isn't well known for beer."
"About as I remember it, sweet and grassy. Nope not as good as the German beers we got there, but better than Budweiser."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for bringing this back from Turkey. Appearance was bright translucent yellow. Head with white and fleeting. Nose was light grain and corn. Taste was basically the same as a nondescript macro-lager. Also picked up wet cardboard and wheat. Mouthfeel was light and lively, easy drinking with a clean finish."
"Overall it is easily drinkable (I drank a bunch of it when I was recently in Istanbul) but not a great beer by any means."
"D: Overall decent drinkability for this style considering its from turkey as well."
"Overall, this was pretty average, but certainly not the worst attempt at the style. Reminded me more of a Euro Lager than a Pilsner. I would have it again, if I were visiting Turkey and there were few other options."
"Well, to give this beer some credit I drank at a much warmer temperature than I should have. Pale golden color with an unusual smell. I couldn't put my finger on exactly what I was smelling but I didn't really like it. Taste was blah, watered down and unexceptional. Very drinkable but why bother. Can't say that I would give this beer another try, maybe if I was burning up at a disco and it was ice cold I could handle it. Definitely not something I would keep around the house."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability: medium/high - especially on a hot, humid afternoon."
"Drinkability: Eh. Not quite a turkey from Turkey, it's just a basic, simple lager."
"A refreshing pilsner that goes down easy and would be a good session beer. Also a good beer for coming in after a hard day's work."
"Given the macro-lager appearance, the beer boasts a surprisingly substantial presence in the mouth, loaded with light malts and grassy, earthy hops. Somewhat sweet with a solid bitter finish.Very drinkable."
"d: a worse pilsener than some american macros in my humble opinion"
"Bottle at Turkish Cuisine, NYC: I didn't feel like this was a pale lager, had more of a pilsener taste to it, in my opinion. Reminiscent of Urquell in that it was a bit buttery, but less bitter. Also kind of fruity with something I couldn't quite grasp. Quite good, in my opinion."
"This one was fairly nuts - not what I expected at all. Appearance is standard, but nose right off the bat is all over the place. Huge fruit flavor, a candy-like sweetness that wouldn't have been out of place in a bock. Taste is likewise; cotton candy, grapes, oranges, honey. No real hop character to this one, which was unfortunate, because there wasn't really much else going on besides the sweet. Feel was mediocre, no complaints about the carbonation. Overall, a better beer than expected, although nothing too exciting."
"D: Please pace a small cooler on the bar full of ice and a twelve pack of these also place friends at bar with there own 12 pack equipped coolers and then add belly dancers and bbq lamb kebabs. yes drinkability is good!"
"D_This is drinkable and is not too offensive so in that I suppose it is more than the sum of its' parts. To me this tasted like a typical run of the mill American Macro lager and tastes like it has fillers in it(not positive either way). The sample could have been old from the long voyage from Istanbul so I might give it another shot if I were in Turkey."
"D-if you enjoy other Euros Pils(which I do)give this one a shot,its nothing to get excited about,but its a whole lot tastier than your average Macro brews"
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style German pilsener"
"On the palate, crisp, carbonated, dry and refreshing. The flavor was quite a surprise--where I expected a typical euro-macrolager there was a real foral and citrus hoppy aroma and flavor married to the refreshing dry malt. it actually is a pilsener, and a pretty good one! Nice!"
"Warning #2: I like darker beers that often taste different or even better warmed up a bit. DON""T DRINK THIS ONE WARM! The skunk really comes up, the mouthfeel goes flat, the taste becomes asprin bitter and the finish is rank. Duh. well, i'm used to being able to drink a beer throughout the temperature ranges, not this one. Ice cold it is at least refreshing, keep it that way."
"Beer from Turkey? I was some what skepticle at first. I mean they are a majority islamic country and alcohol is a no no right? However after seeing all the Turkish bars in Munich I thought I would try this out. Crystal clear ultra pale yellow beer with a small white head that fades quickly. The smell is very grainy too much so for my taste and a little off putting. Taste is ok a little watery and not much hop flavor but easy drinking and an average beer. Much better than a bud or miller lite"
"Overall the beer is pretty mediocre, worth a try if you are curious but wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
"... if you are in Istanbul."
"Drinkability: You can drink this like water. Drinking this on a beach sounds like heaven =)"
"pours a very light golden color without alot of carbonation, smell is incredibly skunky, almost overpowering. taste is sub par, very skunky taste to it, my own mother said ""it smells like a skunks ass"" i really dont know, how she knows what a skunks ass smells like, i trust her judgement. mouthfeel is watery, and the drink ability is low cause it isn't that great, sorry turkey"
"Light golden color with a thick white fairly quickly diminishing head. Almost no smell, slight metallic smell at first, with a light yeast smell as it warmed. Very light taste as well, with subtle malt, and yeast tastes with just a twinge of short lasted, mild bitterness. Overall, very watery, and taste is similar to that of a light beer, rather than a true pilsner. Quite easy to drink, resultedly. Being Turkish I wanted to like this beer, but it is nothing special. Doesnt taste bad or skunky at least, but too mild flavored and thin."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 330 ml brown glass Euro-style longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Thanks to TTU94 for finding this in Dallas. Bir Bira Cok guzel!!!"
"We bought this for a pilsner and lager tasting fest. It poured very pale, little color. Smell was like swamp water, distinct sulfury aroma present, kinda skunky. Taste included some indistinct sweetness, no hops in eveidence, a suggestion of some honey. Mouthfeel was watery. Drinkability? Not again, please! Maybe if I was in Turkey, it would be be fresher and better appreciated."
"bière blonde commerciale classique sans grande distinction, couleur paille pale, odeur sucré de mais-malt, presque pas de houblon, très aqueuse en bouche, finale rapide, désaltérante par contre ce qui l'aide, à boire avec des mets très épicés."
"The drinkability is average. Its all not very good, I would rather a better brew. MK"
"Drinkability: Once the flavor is mastered, it is not too bad. Extremely cheap. It is a good beer to keep stocked in the tent fridge because people rarely steal it."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the refreshing and thirst quenching qualities of the Efes Pils. It poured crystal clear and pale straw in color, with a moderate white head that rapidly settles to a thin cover. This Turkish version of a German pilsener has a very mild, pleasingly sweet, grainy aroma. It is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and the taste is clean, crisp & refreshing with little aftertaste. The Efes pils is the perfect beer to drink on a hot summer day, just after you finish mowing the lawn."
"Bitter and harsh finish, this is not even good for lawn mover beer  comes in high priced at appx. $8 a sixer."
"Overall: the label states it is entirely made from barley malty, but I strongly doubt it. Sameness, characterless, nothing special. First and last one."
"Nicely done, Efes Pilsner is a sturdy European lager that would pair well with a variety of foods (pad Thai, grilled shrimp, barbequed ribs, herbed chicken) and events (sporting events, dinner parties, a night out with the lad or lasses). Certainly worth trying! Not your average Euro-pils!"
"It has been a while since I had this beer so my memory is going to have to do. I first had it in Marmaris Turkey. It was a great beer. The color was a rich gold. The head formed nicely and dissipated slowly. Very very drinkable. As it warms up the flavor is very full. It's a beer that you can drink in a large quantity and still want more. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Drinkability- Pretty darn good for a beer made in a Muslim country."
"Overall, this is an excellent pilsner. It's light and refreshing and great with just about any food. It reminds me of a cross between a Czech and German pils because it seems a bit malty for a German pils, but a bit hoppy for a Czech."
"The beer pours a straw yellow body with a lot of carbonation present. Atop the beer sits a nice looking white head that left little lacing. The aroma was slightly of floral hops with a sweet juicy fruit malt aroma. The taste follows suit closely however, there was an off taste in it that made it close to un palatable. I don't know how to describe it, it was like something I have never encountered before. The body was light with a semi-dry finish. This beer left me not wanting another one at all."
"An average beer at best."
"Familiar look and flavor if you've had one of the many similar styles from the Baltic or eastern Europe. Looks and smells in the glass like a sparkling cider. Bright yellow, thin, bubbly. Taste is very subtle malt and hops, with a spritzy carbonation; slightly watered-down taste and a bit of metallic aftertaste that would probably be less pronounced if fresh, from the keg. A Eurasian macro, but much cleaner taste than American (macro) pilsners. Definitely a drinkable beer and one that would go great with local fare in Istanbul. Or Constantinople. Or is it Istanbul?"
"Pours a very clear, golden, straw color with a flimsy white head. Smells faintly of hops and pilsener malt. Not a whole lot of aroma here. Flavor is similar. Watery at first, then a brief appearance of hops and then a blast of sweet malt. Smooth mouthfeel with super tiny bubbles scrubs the palate clean. Not much going on here. Definitely drinkable though."
"($1.99 / 330 ml / 11.2 oz. light brown bottle with 'EFES' embossed around the neck 4 times)"
"Pours a light golden yellow with no head whatsoever, even pouring into the middle of the glass. Smells mostly of citrusy and a tiny bit of floral hops. Tastes very clean, hardly any sweetness of any kind, not really very bitter either. Not really much in the way of taste at all. But, very clean. Mouthfeel is very watery, but otherwise not too bad. Overall, it's fairly drinkable because there's no real flavor to disagree with. Wouldn't be too bad on a hot day, I guess."
"Overall Impression: A fair Pils. Not my favorite style in the world, but this is well brewed and Id drink a number of them on a hot day."
"a very low pedestal as a solid example of the pilsener style, especially given its point of origin. Body is light and alcohol is low-to-average, so once the sweetness has mellowed on the palate the hop bitterness remains with you and in a semi-dry, pleasant manner. I first really enjoyed this with a Turkish friend in a small kitchen during a crowded party in an apartment with no air conditioning, all during a scorching summer (in Minnesota that means 100F+ degrees). He's an MGD drinker but really appreciated being able to drink hometown brew (he's from Istanbul) and in the above-mentioned conditions he said the beer felt right at home. A good beer that I will pay good money for, but there are plenty of German and Bohemian Pils (e.g. Bitburger) that I prefer."
"A pretty dull and lifeless lager"
"A tad light in the hop department for a true pilsner, but overall a fairly clean and refreshing brew. Perhaps this would be better freshno way of telling how old this bottle is."
"Pilsners from the Med don't have great flavours, or strong aftertastes, this one almost does have those qualities, but not quiet."
"D: Worth the try, but mainly for the novelty. I probably would not buy one ever again (unless perhaps if I was in Turkey). Just too bland and brings so little to the table, especially when there are so many other flavorful beers out there."
"Carbonation is okay, but the flavour of this is so watery and harsh that its hard to drink."
"Mouthfeel was thin to moderate, somewaht watery. I'll drink this one if I get to Turkey but probably not before then."
"Very clear yellow and highly corbonated.Thick head apon the pour and some lace was present on the beer glass after the tasting. Sweet and slighty malty in flavor. Very lighty hopped. The body was thin. I wouln't order this beer at a bar but would drink it if it were the only one offered!"
"I had forgotten that I'd reviewed this beer some time ago, only realizing after I'd nearly finished this review. I suppose I can look at it as an evolution in my tastes and palate."
"This pilsener poured clear gold , with a soapy white head of half an inch. The pilsner glass was coated with fat bubbles that rose quickly. The aroma is of bready and honeyish malt , some green and grassy/hay and herbal like hop , and fresh grains. The taste is pleasantly malty. Nice focus on fresh grains , slight straw , grassy hop and slightest bit of pepper in the dryer finish. The mouthfeel is fairly crisp with a dry finish. A very pleasant and drinkable pilsener brewed in the german style. Nice grain flavors."
"A middle-of-the-road German pilsner."
"I hate to greet a new beer with preconceived notions, but I didn't really expect a Turkish brewer to nail the German Pilsener style. Efes Pilsener is a barely respectable effort that might suffice if drunk fresh in an Ankara beer bar, but it leaves a lot to be desired at this particular time and in this particular place. Give this one a pass."
"D: This doesn't taste like Budweiser, so leave that bias behind when you try it for the first time. It's not a pilsner Urquell, either, but that's not a bad thing. It's better with food, as the clean finish doesn't overwrite whatever you just took a bite of, but the sweetness of the beer complements the bite pretty well. Goes great with light, spicy food, like potato and chick pea kofte, or a Turkish pilaf with dried fruit in it. Do I ever crave Efes? No, but if I'm in a Turkish restaurant, I'm glad it's on the menu. It's solid. Not spectacular, but solid."
"This is what it is: a Turkish macro. That phrase sums up all of the problems with this beer, and should keep expectations low. It basicall looked like Budweiser and tasted like a watered down Heineken except with a metallic aftertaste. Not really worth drinking for any reason other than to say that you've had a beer from Turkey."
"Pours a golden hay with some par bubbling. Crisp aroma of carbonation and pale malts. But still adjuncty in both aroma and taste. Lots of grassy malts in the mouth mixed well with lots of carbonation in the palate . A little dry at times but pretty easy to drink. Perfect for a baseball game."
"Overall - nothing especially good - nothing especially bad... a mediocre brew."
"Boredom."
"Efes Pisener pours a light golden color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is very mild, no off smells. Fairly light, but a nice kiss of hops near the finish. I'm not offended, which is better than I expected. Easy to drink, this would probably be a decent session beer. Worth a try, definite improvement on b/m/c for sure."
"Especailly refreshing while trying to beat the heat with no AC"
"The good thing about this beer is that there is nothing to critisize. What's wrong with the beer is that there is nothing really outstanding about the brew. It's a simple pilsner malt brew with Euro-hops which contribute an earthy, dirty flavor and character. The malt profile, yet simple, is solid and firm, yeilding a creamy, bready, yeasty character that is uninhibited by much off-flavoring. Yea, it has a grain flavor, but it is mild, subdued, and masked by a pleasant creaminess. Finishes mildly crisp and light--just slight of clean. A good beer for a pizza or bratwurst."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The beer has crisp carbonation. The beer is easy to drink. Who would have thought a beer from Turkey would be so nice."
"Not a bad beer at all, and with some additional improvement it can become a really good one."
"Pours out to a light yellow color with a fluffy white head of foam. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of grass, hops, sour grain, light malt. Taste was rather bland and unexciting; light hops and grass mix with sweet grain and a slightly dry malt. Mouthfeel was kind of watery and a touch flat. Drinkability borders on average. Better examples of the style are readily available."
"This is not horrible. But it's not good, either. It's better than Bud, but not by much. The nose is boring but not offensive. Taste is decidedly bready and toasty, grainy, and cheerio-like. Weird. Mouthfeel is odd and a bit watery, but enough bubbles to not drain the score too much. Meh, good but not great, bad but not horrible. Okay."
"More carbonation would make this more refreshing. This wasnt what I was hoping for but it's pretty interesting."
"Plenty drinkable, I could happily drink this with fish or a burger or after a round of golf. All in all, this is a nice beer and it is growing on me the more I drink it. I still find it messy but even in its disorganized fashion I dont mind it. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA. Try one."
" Disappointing at best."
"Pours a clear golden color with a decent head that falls quickly but leaves some nice lacing on the glass. There's almost no malt aroma there - possibly a hint of Saaz hops, but very faint - most of the aroma is skunked. Very skunked. The flavor is crisp and clean with some slight spice and hint of caramel, but the skunking is there as well. The body is very light and the drinkability would probably be better if not for the skunked character."
"A clean light yellow/pale straw colored beer. Has a big foamy white head and some good lace. The aroma starts with a light sour grassy character with a hint of lemon in the background. There is a soft biscuity grain flavor with a hint of lemon again on the finish."
"D - It didnt strike me as outstanding but it was refreshing and clean well balanced and I would look forward to drinking it again."
"Opinion: This is not my favorite Pilsner. It is very oddly adjusted, so the flavors don't really meld. It tastes like there is an adjunct addition that is very out of place, and has no business here. Overall...it is drinkable, but not great."
"A disppointing beer , given that a cold crisp ale would go magnificently with , the standard Sydney Road fare of bread , dips lamb and salad. This was ordinary"
"Drinkability: Through the roof, especially with slightly spicy food. Well balanced."
"The beer is decent and better than I anticipated upon pouring. I could drink several of these and not get tired of them. PRobably very nice on a hot day!"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, pale malt scent with German hops and a bit of the green bottle aroma. The taste is good. It has an extremely smooth and creamy pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine German style pilsner. It's smooth and flavorful with a decent aroma; a good drinker."
"The beer comes in a pale yellow colour and pours a totally negligible white beerhead with very low carbonation. Looking a bit weird for a bottled ""Pilsener", isn't it? The smell suggests mildly sweetish and doughy lager malts and refreshing grainy nose mixed with rice and maize; at the back is a tinge of soft hoppyness. Overall the nose is a bit too restrained for my taste. On the palate the first thing detected is rice's slightly sharp/crisp edge against a very implicit mouthfeel of malts, with a little hints of grassy hops in the background which leads to a quite clean but short, bitter finish. But after the first and second sips the body and taste turn from flat and thin to watery and even acidic. Very little aftertaste of anything is there, thus not pleasant at all. The beer is below average by standards of any rice beer, and, just how can it claim itself to be a Pilsener in the first place? Not impressive and not recommended."
"Efes is golden yellow in color with an average-sized head. The head body is a combination of fluffy and creamy. Average carbonation. The aroma is sweet with an appealing honey-tinged grassiness. The taste is a hair sweeter than the average euro pils. Malts are almost honey-like and have a very ""fresh"" taste. A mild grain taste provides balance and complexity. Hops give the beer a nice bite and provide a welcomed crispness. This is a very tasty and refeshing pilsener from a somewhat surprising location. Recommended for fans of the style."
"All in all I really couldn't hang with this beer."
"Clean, leafy aroma. Very smooth, with a substantial caramel malt at the finish. The caramel pushed the beer outside the style a bit, but the flavor was nice, so who cares? A touch of grapey hops calls to mind a Bavarian influence. Surprisingly easy to drink - low key, switch hitter going well with food, but has enough character to stand on its own."
"Aromas are sunny, with brassy, yellow cereals, lemon and cream. It is a rich mouthful of biscuity breads, tangy, over-ripe citrus, and a rather aggressive fizz. Very well balanced flavors -- an acheivement considering the intensity. Underlying sweetness becomes predominant as it warms, but the hyper-gas and a well-paced, bitter hop extraction keep it dry enough. Pepper, flint and leaf elements can be discerned. No green, sulfery notes can I detect. Very nice beer. Hard to compare to existing iterations of the Pilsner genre... vaguely southwestern German, I'd guess."
"50 cl bottle brought back from Turkey. Date of 11.08.05."
"Pours with a two-fingered white head that fades quickly and leaves some lace. Medium carbonation. Clear, light golden amber color. Light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy. Starts sweet and crisp; smooth but with some lingering hops. $1.75 for a 330ml bottle at Vintage Cellar, Blackburg, VA."
"Very refreshing"
"33cl bottle: This is straw yellow in color. There was a fairly large white fizzy head. There was some aroma. It wasnt unpleasant, but it just wasnt there. There was some taste also, just not much of one. Faint malt, hops, and alot of water. On the up-side, it is drinkable."
"I can't call this an outstanding beer, but it is good enough to have again. Certainly is as good as most pilsners."
"Wow, this refreshing lager is quite surprising. Admittedly, I was a bit nervous when I saw the label state SERVE COLD. But even when warming, it's a decent, refreshing lager. Poured a light gold/yellow colour, with an ample 2 finger head. Lace coated the glass and slowly crept down to the bottom. Smells malty, hoppy, citrusy, bit of pepper, various spices, and spearmint? Surprisingly, the spearmint was a nice addition. Legitimate malt sweetness, followed by lemon, orange and grapefruit. After the swallow, the spices kick in as an aftertaste. If you breathe out, the mint is noticable on the tip of the tongue. It's possible to use this to freshen your breath. Light, smooth mouthfeel. Very refreshing, pick-me-up beer. I like it."
"I had one of these at Aycha, a Turkish bar in Sapporo, Japan. The owner, Turkish himself, informed me that Turkish people are enormously proud of this beer. I was also unaware that Efes equals the english Ephesus, city of the Roman Empire."
"The beer pours the prototypical unclouded pilsner gold color with the head portly in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a brilliant white and the lace a thin curtain to drape the glass. Nose is the standard pilsner sweet malt, crisp and clean with the archetypal sweet malt start and thin top. Quintessential pilsner finish, crisply acidic, hops apropos to the style, dry and linger aftertaste, not a very good Standard Pilsner at that."
"Came out (in a Carlsberg glass) clear medium gold under a two-fingered white head with decent contour and clumps of lace. the nose is heavy with malt and corn, while the mouth is slightly prickly and heavy with grain. There is a strong corn taste, followed by a bit of hps. I couldn't help but think this is a classic macro. (That's not a compliment.)"
"(330 ml bottle). Very pale yellow colour, decent head. Sweet fruity aroma. Flavour is, uh, thin... some alcoholic/fusel notes, like Norwegian ""hjemmebrent"" (=""moonshine""). Might be drinkable ice cold at the beach of Antalya. Anywhere else: Avoid!"
"i have had this occasionally on its own, and its o.k. not something id choose over others. but if im eating a meal from the middle east, its a top drop to go alongside. another great food vs beer matchup."
"This pilsner (tasted more like a Czech pilsner than a German Pilsner to me) poured a clear, light amber color with good carbonation and with white foam that settled fairly quickly but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was a mild, lightly sweet, malty aroma. The taste was lightly sweet and malty, slightly tangy, with some floral hops and a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. The sweetness became more pronounced as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and carbonation. This was an easy drinking plisner. Not bad. Better colder."
"A good pilsner, similar to the more mainstream german pilsners, like Spaten and Warsteiner. Tasty, but unremarkable. I could never pick this out in a blind test of german pilsners."
"Bet this might work well in a hot Turkish sun, but not much more impressive than that. Nice heavy green bottle."
"Appears straw tawny gold with a fizzy white head seems to be a mass produced pils from Turkey. Aroma when I cracked this bottle smelled of skunk cabbage with a slightly floral edge to it and an off flavor that sends chills up my spine for being straight putrid almost a burnt rubber quality to it in my opinion. Taste has a strange carboard like sweetness to it, don't let me sound weird here but the sweetness is a good thing bit caramelly just a touch with a good bit of balancing bitterness mixed in here not bad taste at all. Mouthfeel is thinner than I like but standard for any mass produced European pils, couldn't drink more than one mainly due to the scent when I cracked the bottle."
"Not that bad, i mean its pretty light and all, and fairly sweet. Some grassy hops dry it out towards the end, and its quite crisp. Theres not too many positives to come out of it, but it wasn't as bad as i was expecting, or even the aroma suggested. Still nothing to write home about. A little too sweet."
"Pours a big, creamy head that pops away pretty quickly. Light, but a darker yellow than most pilsners. Smells spicy and a little minty. Typical crisp, clean taste for a pilsner, but a little thicker than usual. Fine mouthfeel, pretty rish, and very drinkable. Better than your average pils."
"Come on, Turks, I know you can make a better beer than this!"
"Pale gold in color. The light sweet malt rounds out the average amount of hops. Some back of the throat bitterness is noticeable with large gulps. A trace of limes is detected with concentrated effort. The aroma is light but quite pleasant. The thin white head dissipates rather quickly. A little too sweet, but otherwise a pretty good beer."
"This very pale golden pilsener pours with a rather thin head that fades rather quickly. The aroma is peppery with a hint of citrus and malt. The flavor follows the aroma closely, having a pepper spiced bite to it with a decent malt backing, followed by a citrus and grassy finish. The grassy flavors extend well into the aftertatse. There is also a hint of malt sweetness and a slight metallic note on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent, but not exciting. The overall drinkability seems good. A decent beer, and my first from Turkey. Definitely worth a try for pilsener fans."
"EFES from Turkey: A deep golden pilsner beer.  Very generic labeling, “SERVE COLD”!  Very little head, but what’s left clings to the sides.  Mild aroma of buttered toast.  This beer has a pleasant taste of somewhat spicy, sweet malt flavor, with strong carbonation.  As the beer warms, there is a faint but noticeable taste of vinegar. Best beer from Turkey I’ve ever had."
"On the nose there is an ever so slight pepper tone in the aroma. Mouth feel is smooth. On the palate light peppery notes up front, maybe light tones of orange peels also or perhaps lemon? I must say this is very clean and crisp though... Overall I really enjoyed this brew, very refreshing and cleansing to the palate!"
"Efes is a better than average european pilsener...I had it while on two cruises in the mediterranean while I was in the Marines. Fairly light on the palate with a light gold appearance. I would rather drink this than a lot of the other beers offered in Turkey while haggling with the ""Hey-Joes"". Slightly better than average but not spectacular...and I will agree with the other review that states it's better than Tuborg!"
"Notes: A decent Euro-style pils, better than some of its better known counterparts without a doubt. Very well balanced and showing both malt and hops in a perfectly blended way."
