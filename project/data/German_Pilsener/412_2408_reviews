"It's decent and very easy drinking, but also feels very dumbed down.  While good and pleasurable I'd probably prefer a different brand or maker, but she will work fine."

"Overall: A very well executed german pils. Great easy drinker that you can easily obtain at a reasonable value. Give it a try."
"O: that fruity start is kind of wild for the style ... it's so sweet it truly comes off like an English pale ale at first; that sweet fruity twist is cool, and overall it's a tasty, drinkable brew, but it's just a hair above average. i'd use this beer for ""gateway"" purposes because it's so sweet to start off with that even non-beer drinkers might enjoy it"

"Yes, it is a CAN as it is not pressurized and pours via gravity. I would get a quick finger of soapy, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a button-bright golden-yellow (SRM = 4 to 5) and Midas, Croesus and Mammon suddenly crashed our party, desirous of a sip. It smelled great, like strong honey underlain by a pleasant grassiness. It was most definitely a German Pilsner! Czech Pilsners would be the opposite - grassy underlain by honey. My mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was kind of light and thin, but that is to be expected in the style. The taste was very honey-like and I was reminded of the air freshener in my Ex-Old Lady's car. She is an apiarist and keeps honeycombs in the back of her vehicle, giving it a really honeyed scent. It was on the finish that I again tasted Noble (grassy) hops, giving the beer as semi-sweetness. This was a great example of the style, plus I got to turn some other people on to it as a result of its medium. You CAN believe that I am going to be looking into procuring more mini-kegs in the future!"
"The flavor comes together just as my head was casting doubt based on the aroma. Tastes a little clean with grassy, woody, and raw grain flavors. It has a soft body with gentle crispness and even a touch of creaminess. True, another German pilsner, but it's certainly better than the Warsteiner's of the world."

"I had greatly anticipated the opening of this bottle. Had heard some nice comments about it, but as soon as I opened it, I smelled skunk. Same as Heineken. Guess I am not a German Pilsner kind of Guy. Maybe it was not fair since I had just finished a bottle of Pranqster Belgian Style Golden Ale that was excellent at 92 points! I just don't like the skunky in a beer. I will not buy again."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head, moderate retention on a clear, light yellow body. Suddsy lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma includes a light hoppy note, some pilsner malt, maybe some lemon peel. Taste is light, refreshing, mild bitterness, slight sweetness on the back end. The taste can only be described as a light pilsner taste and clearly authentic. Tasty."

"If this ""EKU"" pils is the c lassic German pilsner, then what's the deal with Kulmbacher's Edelherb? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises honey-dripped biscuit, light grass, and a kiss of flower petal. The taste holds notes of old biscuit, dank greens, iceberg lettuce, and a general sense that the world just isn't quite right, that the Matrix may, in fact, be real, and it's having a hard time coding the flavor of beer. Man, this stuff just jumped off a cliff and destroyed itself upon the rocks at the base (but the eyes are still open and trying to process the horror it just experienced). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, this is the second time I've had this beer, and both times have been incredibly disappointing. And I made sure this stuff was pretty fresh, too, so it's not like I've been sitting on a bottle for years or anything. I've just gotta say it: This is a fairly crappy pils. *sigh*"

"Drinkability is good, a fine pils, clean, nice flavor but balanced and restrained."
"Overall: With all the great pilsners available in the US, I wouldn't go to this one again. Doesn't measure up to Prima Pils and others."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable. It would seem to make a good pairing with food because the taste isn’t that strong."

"While drinking this and writing the review, I didn't even notice how quickly I had finished the beer. This is just a very crisp, clear German pilsener that showcases everything enjoyable about the style."
"O: An excellent pils, I don't know why I don't drink it more often."
"Overall nice, a bit lighter than expected, nice malts, crisp and clean, finishes a bit too quick as well."
"Overall this is a showcase pilsner and a great example of it’s style, I put it right up there with Victory Prima Pils."
"Overall very light, clean and bland with a faint bitterness that fades quickly. I'm not a fan of light beer in general, but this was more subtle than any other light beer I've tried."
"Overall, not a bad representation of the breed, but nowhere near Best in Class. This pils would be good for a few bottles, but gets boring after while."
"Overall on the lighter side and I wouldn't necessarily seek it out but am a little intrigued with the subtle sweet surprise. Interesting to have a fruit different than a wit orange of HW banana clove."
"overall a very sessionable beer, but there's many better fish in the sea."
"A decent, easy to enjoy pilsner for those who are fans of the style. Worth a try."
"I really want to find a German pils that I like. I feel bad that they all taste the same to me and it's rather disappointing. This beer is clear yellow it's earthy and mild flavored. Fresh cut grass on the taste too. Not much hops on the nose. Not my favorite style."
"D: Light, refreshing, clean, crisp easy to drink although maybe a little bit boring. Would be refreshing on a hot summer day or perhaps paired with any hot, spicy dish."
"D: Great palatability, excellent drinkability."
"My overall impression us that this is the best beer of the month club beer I've been sent... It is tasty. It is good enough that I will actually drink the rest of them, rather than give them away..."
"D - Again, I'm not a fan of the style so I generally don't want another. That said, this is one that I could have a few of if nothing of another style (or only BMC) were available."
"11.2 oz single. Very pale gold lager, tight white head.Good lace. Actually nice hoppy aroma..saaz hops but really bright and clear. Taste is more balanced than i imagined but the hops shine through at the end.. though rather balanced for a German Pils..it pulls it off. Actually a nice silky smooth palate( if thats possible) for the style. Overall i liked this one and found it drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and watery; body was light and crisp, with light carbonation and a slight bitter finish. High drinkability, it goes down easy, but is just a little reserved to be exciting. Good session beer that could flow all night."
"This is a solid pilsner, even if it's not very impressive. Easy to drink."
"I bought a larger fridge keg of this at my local BevMo. It was on sale and I decided to give it a try. It is a straightforward German Pilsner, with a hint of Lager taste. The beer is a beautiful golden color, has a strong aroma (which is sweet), leaves a slight aftertaste, and is easy to drink. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like St. Pauli or Steinlager."
"Bleh. I'm not impressed, won't be seeking this out again."
"Drinkability - This was good enough to finish but I wouldn't buy again."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer in my opinion, and this is the second six-pack that I have drank in the week that I have been traveling, so it definitely goes down easily. I am anxious to try it again is a more ""proper"" setting, but this beer is good enough that it isn't suffering even from this inferior presentation. I am looking forward to drinking this beer again."
"D - This was really pretty good. I feared it might be old because of the high price point. Quite a tasty German Pils."
"Pours a pale gold color. Aroma is of floral hops and grassy grain. It is a totally straightforward pilsner with the taste of grain and peppery hops with a malty backbone, and a very dry finish. Might not be the most intricate beer, but on a hot summer day it sure beats water."
"Pours an ULTRA clear golden yellow, with slow bubble trailers. A thin head sticks to the sides of the glass nicely. Smell is beer-like (aka malty and a tad sweet and grassy.) Taste is smooth at first, twisting into a hoppy high and malty backbone. Nothing bad, just a good pilsner taste with a solid, bitter (and a bit of tankard) finish. Drinkability is expectedly high."
"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Bright and clear in the glass, golden-hued with a thick frothy head. Nice spicy hop aroma, quite fragrant and fresh, a bit grassy. Crackery pale malt resides right beside the hops, and the yeast profile is clean, showing only a hint of sulfur. It's crisp and dry on the tongue, more hoppy than malty, with a robust spicy/herbal/green/grassy hop character. There's a touch of dry maltiness around the mid-palate, reminiscent of a sweet baguette. Finishing with a firm, punchy and lingering bitterness, this is especially dry and bitter for a German pils."
"4/3.5/4/4/4"
"Drinkability: It's another hot, muggy, stinky in all the wrong places kind of day in Georgia and it's not even summertime yet and as much I enjoy a full-bodied, hearty stout, I was definitely looking for something lighter and more refreshing to satisfy. While it's not the punchiest pils on the block (this could be an issue of freshness, sadly there a no apparent dating codes on the bottle), it did fare well with me when it came to being refreshing and easily drinkable."
"EKU Pils pours a nice golden color, with little head that doesn't stick around for too long. The beer looks very average. The taste is stronger than I was expecting. A little bitter even. Aftertaste lingers a little. Overall, this is a good pilsener, but probably not the best beer I've ever had."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a solid beer to drink for a while but there are better beers in the style that I would choose first."
"d - a nice easy drinking smooth, well-lagered and slightly bitter German pilsner"
"An OK beer but not one I will likely buy again because I like more hop bite in my Pilsners."
"drinkability - very easy drinking - if you want session beer you want pils"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is crisp, edgy, and zippy. The body of the beer is carbonated and the finish is medium. This beer has a nice pilsner flavor with a zesty body. I like it very much."
"Overall a decent representation of the style, but im pretty sure this bottle has some unwarranted age on it that has caused it to become something slightly less desireable. Still a good session beer and one i could drink a couple of with ease. A nice pils."
"Overall this is an easy drinking German Pilsner that really fits the bill."
"Drinkability was a 4.5! This was an awesome surprise. I bought it as a German Pils mini keg for our 2009 Ofest party. World Mkt had them on sale for $14.99. It was a a great comparison for homebrew tasting!"
"Light and well carbonated. This was an easy drinker. I could hit this all day in the summer -- just knock em back in front of the grill. Not super complex, but it is what it is supposed to be. I dug this one."
"D - Refreshing and light very drinkable."
"D - could certainly drink a lot due to the light quality, but nothing noteworthy"
"Clear yellow body is topped by a sizeable white head. Carbonation is a little on the lighter side. Decent flowery hop taste and a nice amount of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery."
"Edit: Picked up a six pack of it and was very disappointed. Was quite plain in bottle form. No skunky taste at all which was ironic."
"D - Good to average pilsner."
"D- would love to have with a multitude of bbq food and on a warm day"
"Not horrible but there are many better."
"D - Easily drinkable and a great example of the style. The hop aroma could be a bit stronger, and I have had other pilsners with a richer malt complexity. One of the best German Pilsners I have come across in the US."
"God I love pils."
"Drinkability- So refreshing, great beer on a hot day. Gone quickly and another would be welcome. I'd love to taste this recipe as an Imperial pilsner, that would be amazing."
"Pours a perfectly clear gold with a billowing white head. The foam reduces to a small, solid cap with great lacing. Strong aromas of grassy, grainy pilsener malts hit the nose; nice, light sweetness without much hop presence. This grainy malt character is dominant in the taste as well, though slightly floral hops come forward. Nice peppery, dry finish. Light-medium body. Overall, a very refreshing, well-crafted lager"
"Drinkability - a little out of place for me in the dead of winter, but this would stand up well to some ribs, pulled pork, or chili."
"There wasn't that much flavor to it, except a bitter taste, but not Pilsner bitter--more like skunk bitter. It also left a horrible taste in the back of my throat. I was also disappointed because I hold the Germans to a higher standard when it comes to beers."
"Drinkability - it was light, so definitely drinkable, but not something i would go out of my way to drink again"
"The body is like seltzer, which is also what the flavor reminds me of. Simply said, this is a waste of a bottle. Interestingly, this beer is not skunky."
"This is a really good pilsner. Light palette, but a nice flavor. Great tasting, and refreshing."
"Drinkability: See my taste notes above. Decidedly average - it hits some of the right notes and misses others, and though it's fairly drinkable due to its crispness and low abv%, I don't see myself reaching for it again."
"Pours pale gold with a large white head and good lacings. Aroma is lightly skunked. Taste is bitter hops with good support from the slightly sweet malts. Nice clean Pils with a bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is good considering it has an abv 0f 5%. A decent journeyman Pils."
"D- This is a very good pilsner. It has great balance, some nice complexity and is easily sessionable."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: Overall a nice session beer. Not my favorite take on the style, but definitely worth a revisit."
"Pours a light gold with massive head thanks to great carbonation. When it does die it leaves some lacing. A wet grass aroma of faint hops and very few malts. Surprisingly, I found that the beer's taste had a good malt presence, better than the smell. Hops are subdued and this isn't a dry Pils, more like a soft one. Finishes smooth and almost slick while retaining some crispness. Not bad at all."
"A decent pils, and very refreshing. Great for a summer day, or a warm fall day."
"Drinkability: A few of my friends showed up on my doorstep with a 5 liter mini keg of this the other night. Really a pleasant beer for sitting on the porch and enjoying the cooling weather."
"D - Very easy drinking, Clean with some decent balance."
"This brew, poured into a tall pilsner glass on tap, was a clear bright gold color with a big fluffy white head and lots of lacing. The aroma was a pretty flowery wheat, bready like many decent pilsners. The feel is midland for this style, fair quality with mild carbonation. I pick up light oak and sweet wheat. It's clean and crisp, very drinkable if you want something light and refreshing. But it isn't anything special, no complexity and it doesn't quite grab your tastebuds like the best pils can do. But I'm happy to drink it and would do so again depending upon the choices on a warm summer night."
"D: A modest drinking pilsner but a tad sweet per style. Wouldn't drink this on a regular basis or hold my attention as a session."
"D: Drinks pretty well. I will be having this with dinner now. It would go well with food."
"Appearance has a light straw color with a fluffy white head. Smell of sweet light malt and hop, maybe even a bit biscuity. Taste is lightly sweet, grainy with some breadiness and lightly hopped. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and finishes clean. An excellent drinker, one I'd love to try on tap in Germany."
"The taste is on the sweet side for a GFerman pilsner, but still has a light, persistent bitterness and long, gentle finish of grain and herbs. It has pretty good malty body with giving a lightly oily texture and good grain flavour, but it needs a little more hops to rank with other German pilsners."
"¡Salud!"
"D - Highly drinkable despite a somewhat average flavor. I like how the peppery saaz notes fade away after swallowing, only to re-emerge in a burp and remind you of how spicy this one is."
"pours a brilliant light yellow-gold w/ a creamy white head which dissipated quickly leaving a decent lacing down my pilsn glass ; a strong smell , mostly floral/""herbal"" hop and steely grain, not much else ; a crisp flavor w/ a decent hop bite blends well with cereal grains for that ""cured concrete"" pils flavor , an excellent balance ; a fairly dry, light bodied brew w/ loads of carbonation ; an excellent pilsner, very drinkable, a shame i have only one, i'll have to remedy that by this summer..."
"d - this is a lot better than I expected. This has great flavor. It's fairly simple yet well balanced and has a couple surprises hidden in the taste. This would be something I would get more of, but it's hard to find a 6 pack of this."
"decent drinking, and a great example of the style"
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. Settled with a watery gold amber beverage; very clear. The drink had a well sized medium to eventual thin head. Grassy hops were well established in its aroma along with a woody texture. Great earthy flavors in the taste, as well, wrapped in the bittersweet hops of the beverage. Excellent carbonation; this was an extremely refreshing and enjoyable beverage. Overall, if you like earthy goodness, this is your drink."
""
"The taste was not clean and spread out. It left some bitterness in the back of the throat but was not overly noticeable. This would be a good brew in the summer for sure. Overall I thought it was okay."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, has a nice crisp bite, and is well carbonated. It goes down very easy and is drinkable. That being said, the flavor is nothing special which somewhat limits its drinkability. Overall, it's an alright beer. I wouldn't characterize it as special in any respect."
"A refreshing quench-thirster (despite touch of bitterness - not something I normally complain about, but a bit off here). Smooth - disappears quickly."
"D- This one is super drinkable even for a pils, and one of the few examples of the style that I can say I have actually enjoyed when I drank it."
"D: Pretty nice pils, well balanced and sexy mouthfeel, the only knock here is the rather bland appearance."
"Mild grainy, slightly hoppy aroma. Clear yellow/gold with frothy white head with good retention and some lacing. Bitter and dry but fairly well balanced overall. Some maltiness became more apprarent as beer warmed up. Slight alcohol detectable in flavor. Medium carbonation, light body. Dry finish."
"Somewhat drying mouthfeel, right on for carbonation. All in all, a very good beer."
"5L keg at our Septoberfest party. This beer pours a clear golden color with a medium thick and frothy bone white head that dissipates slowly. Spotty lacing. Light hops and malt aroma. Light-bodied and crisp with mild citrusy hops and sweet malt flavors. The finish is clean and zesty with a lightly bitter hops aftertaste. Just OK overall."
"Overall a decent pils. However, there are much better and more complex examples available."
"Overall, one of the better-tasting pilseners I've had. This beer has a very smooth, creamy feel to it, accompanied by a taste that combines hops and malts without letting one or the other get too out of hand. Highly recommended if you're looking for a pilsener."
"This is a very average beer. It is a light yellow with a white head. There is some lacing, but not a lot. The smell is funny because straight out of the bottle this had quite a whiff of skunk but it dissapeared pretty quickly. After the skunk came your wet straw, some citrus, and then a bit of sunflower as the beer settled. The taste underwent some changes too. At first the hoppiness came through more so than when the beer finally settled. This is a slightly watery, light bodied, medium carbonation beer with not much going on one way or the other. What do I get are hints of the following in the taste: dryness, straw, some bits of citrus bite, a peppery bitterness at the end, some maltiness in the mid section. Eh ... this is just average."
"Drinkability/notes: A poor example of the style, not recommended."
"The mouthfeel good, but the aftertaste is slightly astringent. That fades somewhat over time. Not a bad pils...good for a warm day."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma is malted grain with some spicy German hops. The taste is smooth with some malt up front with a nice little bite from the spicy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall, this is a very enjoyable pils that is highly drinkable. When in the mood for a pils, I will definately pick up again. Recommended."
"if you want to go to town"
"D- Of course, you could drink 50 of these in a row."
"Soft yellow color, maybe a shade darker than I expected. This is actually a very mellow pilsener, but it somehow works. Substantial cherry-like fruit flavor; sort of rich and buttery, with just enough bitterness to give it an edge. Roundish mouthfeel - nothing watery here. Maybe a little sticky on the aftertaste, but a very nice beer, overall."
"It is a very straightforward beer, not too much to say really. A well designed pilsner, but nothing too special. There are much better pilsners out there in the same price class."
"Pored from bottle to tumbler at 45 degrees. Pale is certainly what this beer looked like, but pretty with its big fluffy white head that lasted a right long time. Good lacing. Beer smelled like dough and had a slighly sweet taste. It was a good beer and I think I would buy again."
"I drank this out of one of those 5-liter mini-kegs. When it was poured, it piled up a big fluffy head that stuck around a good while. The aroma had just a hint of spicy hoppiness but was dominated by the malts, especially munich malt, which always reminds me of matzo or saltine crackers--just a wee bit toasty. Flavor was also more malty-sweet and bready than hoppy. The hops shone through at the finish, leaving a brisk dryness to offset the full, malty body, as they should. This is a good solid central-German lager. Not as overtly hoppy as a brash Bohemian Pilsener, but very easy to drink. I find that I do not mind that there is more left in my mini-keg."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat tingley due to the alcohol and moderate carbonation. Light to medium bodied. I'm glad I tried this one but I will not return."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow with a giant white foamy head. The smell is alittle weak with only hints of floral and sweet malt present. The taste is very crisp with an intial hop bite that fades to a malt sweetness with floral earthy flavors. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. A very good pils that could make this a summer everyday beer."
"Taste is much the same, lightly sour pale malt but a more strident presence of noble hops. Actually, nicely balanced, tilting more toward the hops. More so as it warms. If you like noble hops this beers for you. Hops give a cleaness to the beer, light a crisp. Hop dominant in finish and aftertaste. Nice pils here! Lovely for the Georgia heat."
"The beer is quite cold, which is just what I was looking for on this muggy, hot, summer afternoon. A nice, sharp, lightly herbal hop note is evident from the get go. The crisp hoppy bitterness carries through to a lightly lingering finish. Grassy grain notes linger with a touch of toasted grain and just a hint of malt sweetness; all of these really just add a subtle counterpoint to the crisp, herbal (with even a touch of lemon zest) hop character though. This is certainly not the best Pilsner out there, but it certainly hits the spot today and is in fact a tasty example of the style."
"Drinkability is very high. A very nice and refreshing beer, Its whole is better then the sum of it's parts."
"Drinkability: Looks really do deceive. This one of those beers that looks a lot better than it tastes. More like your typical Euro lager than a German Pils. Missing that tell tale saaz hop bitterness and crispness. Way to sweet for me. I guess it could be an easy drinker if you like Euro Lagers but I'll pass on EKU Pils. There are better German Pils out there (see Prima Pils, Tuppers Hop Pocket Pils)."
"Mouthfeel is just a tad bit tart after the swallow, but generally clean and refreshing. A well constructed pils that is incredibly easy to drink."
"Drinkability: While the flavor profile is a bit lacking, this is a clean and refreshing beer"
"Mouthfeel- Key for any pils is the refreshing and crisp flavor in the beer. There was plenty of gthat in this beer along with a little uncharacteristic sweetness."
"Definitely drinkable in the sense that it's not very heavy and won't weigh you down. On the other hand, I thought it lacked in flavor and was blander than other versions of this style, and so if I wanted a session pilsner, I'd go with one of those instead."
"D - not my favorite European pils. Very sugary sweet with little hop character or presence. Will not be having this one again."
"The body is light and sharply carbonated. Fairly dry with only touch of sweet up front. Pretty easy to put down."
"One very nice Pils. I'm actually quite taken with it and will venture the opportunity to grab this from the shelf more often when in the mood for a good Pilsner."
"Last swigs: I am spoiled living so close to Vic'ry and getting their Prima. Overall, a well done easy pils."
"Pretty much a middle of the road beer, that walks a fine line between being ok and being too sweet"
"This bottle was part of a ""German Beer Hall Tour"" sampler pack I received for Christmas from my Dad."
"EKU Pils is a traditional tasting German Pilsner, well balanced, and close to exceptional in taste."
"Enjoyed at my favoite local German Bar. After passing up on this one for quite a while, I was pleasantly surprised when finally trying it. Very refreshing and clean, though normal in flavor profile. Noble hop aromas were fresh and bold for a pilsner. Earthy and lightly malty also. Flavors are moderately sweet, bready and slightly grainy. Hops provide more than just bittering--a good hop flavor with no light-striken qualities. Qute Bohemian in quality. Body is smooth and creamy. Finishes lightly bitter, grainy, yet clean. Great for washing down the Brats and Sauerkraut."
"Overall Impression: Trying not to slam this beer as Im afraid its a bit old (but no date on the bottle, so fair game). Ill have to try another later and confirm or correct these low numbers."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner flute, very clear gold color with a thick white head (though it disabated rapidly). Pretty faint bouquet, slightly floral. Crisp taste, grany but decently balanced; not exactly aw inspiring but a good example of a pilsner. I suppose that is one way of saying good but standard. The mouthfeel is fairly soft but slighly metalic."
"Drinkability: Like stated above, this would be a good beer on summer afternoon. It is like an American macro beer with a backbone - although, frankly, if that backbone weren't there, I'd have been disappointed with this one."
"Clear, clean, golden pils-yellow body with a largish, thick, white head. Aromas of softly sweet biscuit malt, light cereal and grain, with faint hops. Taste starts with lightly, honey sweet malts. Clean. Followed by a decent spicy hop bite. Sweetish finish. Light-medium bodied with a lively, refreshing feel. Good summer lager."
"poured a crystal clear light amber color with puffy white head. Nice floral hops smell. crisp pilsner taste with moderate hops without beinbg over-powering. Left a nice taste in the mouth and the urge for more. Very drinkable.Thanks to mtanji for the sample"
"I thought I would like this beer more when I saw it's nice rich yellow color and the thick head it produced. While the hoppy aftertaste is unmistakably potent, I found it that after a few the aftertaste became metallic like. This beer was pretty grainy too making it's drinkability challenging."
"Per B.O.M. club notes: 5% ABV"
"The color is a nice golden shade. The head starts large and rocky, but has a moderately quick disappation. Carbonation is decent. The aroma is rather weak, but clean. Just a light touch of sweetness is noted. The taste has a very tasty light malt profile. Hops provide just a little bit and even less spice. A mild grain taste adds complexity. Mouthfeel is very crisp. EKU Pils has a somewhat lighter body than most pils, yet still contains all the taste. Great drinkability."
"Notes: Its a good pilsner, nothing like those american adjunt lagers that crowd the shelves. Very balanced, drinkable, and thirst quenching."
"tried this one on tap at the Collins bar in NY city. Poured light golden and clear. The head is quite white, lacing was minimal. Nose that I got was mostly of grass. This is a moderatly crisp and clean lager. highly quaffable and pleasant on the taste buds. German hops duly noted, as well as a note of rye. Versitile sessioner."
"This brew is a pale gold color, small white head that takes off quickly. Nice aroma, all malts, nice and sweet. Typical grain sweet malt front, touch of bittering hops to finish it off. Pretty highly carbonated. Pretty standard pils here, something you want to put down after a nice day of mowing lawns."
"Yet another beer to add to my small but growing list of beers tasted (which will be growing over the next couple of weeks thanks to a couple of ""beers of the world"" eight-packs received as Christmas gifts - Thanks Santa!)... but not one really worth seeking out again."
"EKU Pils just can't be recommended, there's too much unsupported bitterness. This beer is only for those who love the style and maybe not even for them. Best avoided."
"Pours out to a brilliantly clear straw golden, forming a rocky bone-white head with very good retention and excellent clumps of lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma of traditional pils...freshly mown hay, husky and dry delicate pale malts, noble hops, freshly fermented. Fresh with minimal skunk. Taste is exact echo of the aroma. Delicate malt body with medium-firm bitterness. Mouthfeel is bright initially but softens throughout and ends with a lightly dry finish. Light bodied. Cleanly fermented with no off-flavors. Alcohol is imperceptable. Up there with other very good pils. Reminds me of Steinlager. Good refreshing brew. Recommended as far as pilseners go."
"Taste was very nutty and almost buttery. A slight hops bitterness comes through but was not overpowering. Finish is somewhat thin. Smooth as opposed to ""crisp"" like other pilsners I've had, but this was enjoyable nevertheless."
"Very refreshing, nice for the Tucson summer. No off-flavors or anything disagreeable, but not enough to make me want another."
"This beer promised a lot, but didn't deliver. Very clear golden yellow when served. It had a slight perfumey aroma which intrigued, but when I tried to follow it up when drinking, well, it was missing. My notes say: not much taste. The mouthfeel was good, low-medium, with a nice soft crispness. It was just...not a lot of taste at all. Would try to have again, see if I get a serving with some taste next time ;-)"
"I felt this was one of the more highly hopped pilsners I've had in the past. Still, the grassy malt seemed to be the prevalent flavor here. I've been drinking this for a day or so now and it's proving to be a worthy session beer."
"An average pilsner from the EKU people. On the hoppy side of pilsners, and hopefully the keg can's a bit old so that this one will be even better next time. Though it doesn't stand up with its big brother eisbocks, I'd probably have another one in the hot summertime."
"I could quaff this gem all night long....a session beer for sure."
"D&N: Refreshing, easy to drink because it doesn't demand anything at all to grab your attention. This beer would be perfect picnic fodder."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is decent. It has a nice slightly malty scent with a bit of dry skunky aroma. The taste is average. It has a crisp, bitter flavor with a dry, yet weak finish. It has no malt character, but does reveal some bitter hops. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a boat load of carbonation. This is a hard drinker. I don't care for the taste at all. It has a nasty stale aftertaste. It's one and done for me."
"The first bottle I had won't be the last."
"A nice smooth refrshing beer. Flavor is good and beer feels crisp in the mouth."
"Very clear and pale yellow in color. Decent carbonation with a very lively head of white foam. The aroma gives off some pungently sweet graininess and a hoppy citrus. Sweet and light in flavor with a soft hop bite. This is a very clean pilsner with a lemony crisp character and a nice smoothness. A first rate pilsner."
"Nice straw pilsener colored with a fluffy white head. Bready and malty aromas with a good amount of hops present. Beautifully crisp and flavorful. One of the better pilseners I've tasted. Drinkability is through the roof on this one. I think I've found a staple for myself. (and I thought Victory's Prima Pils was good...)"
"This beer had a body with some depth for a pils, not weak at all. Very tasty and extremely drinkable. Several of these can be easily consumed without getting bored."
"Pours with a clean white head settling over clear light golden-yellowish liquid. The nose is soft and light maltiness with a pinch of delicate flowery hoppiness. The taste is a tad salty at first, then a clean sparse malt flavor shows up followed by quite adequate (read: nice and bitter!) hoppiness, nicely balanced! Finishes light, dry and extremely drinkable, makes for one great hot weather session lager."
"Absolutely transparent bright gold color, white marginal head with some sticky large bubbles. Downward falling string lacing. Good aroma, grape skins, hop, some honey laden with pollen. Malt is straightforward but ample, lightly sweet and maple in impression. Nice carbonation, sprightly but not overdone. The hops shine, peppery and crisp and excellent in the attenuation department. Nutty bittering in the aftertaste as well, good finish. This is one of the hoppier Pilsners I've had -- if it would keep I'd stock it for those occasions when you want a crisply bitter drinkable beer without the giant North American hop characteristics."
"Bright white head held out for a minute and then faded to a film, leaving a ring of lace as it went. Clear, light gold colored beer. Smells like a crisp and fresh beer. Almost no flavor, like a light macro. I can't pick out a damn thing in the taste, although it is pleasant. Not much in the taste department, but atleast it's clean. Light body, but not watery."
"Appearance: Crystal clear straw tinted golden witha nice bubbly white head leaves very nice webbed lacing in full patches. Aroma: Some lemongrass sweetness, grainy, with Hallertau hops present to balance the sweetness a very nice crisply balanced brew so far. Taste: Pleasantly hoppy distinct European hops with a biscuit malt character, much more flavor than I was expecting simple but very tasty. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body with a very smooth natural carbonation everything an American light lager will never accomplish. Drinkability: Very refreshing and easy to consume, definitely a session brew meant to be drank a few at a sitting."
"Pours a translucent golden hue with a large foamy head that quickly dissipates. An astringent aroma with a hint of citrus and hop essence. Tastes like a standard pilsner at first, but the aftertaste is really something. Dry, lightly tart, lemony, faintly hoppy, just overall very busy. I liked this from the first sip and it's growing on me even more. Damn, I wish I'd bought more than one."
"Fascinating finish. Leaves a very noticeable immediate hop bitterness, but you can suck the aftertaste out of the crevaces in your mouth for minutes and minutes after you're done with this beer to a puckering, bitter end...or is it the end?"
"Tasted blind again on 6.11.04 with Czechvar and Urquell. Stylistically, EKU is identical to Czechvar only more lively. Urquell continues to demonstrate its Bohemian typicity at the very highest level of quality (something I have to prove again and again to my skeptic-self)"
"I had this on tap at a German Bierstube in Moscow. It came out (in a Helles glass) clear gold with a 2.5 finger contoured head that stuck around a while and left very nice lace most of the way down the glass. The nose was very mild, almost imperceptible. The mouth was prickly and light. My tastebuds were pleased by the nice balance between the malty start and the hoppy finish. The aftertaste is crisp bitter, with an amazing extra hoppy kick in the car 15 minutes after I finished the glass. This is a good session beer and a fine example of the style, albeit on the mild side."
"Very light and pale golden. Looks more like grape juice than a pilsner. Clarity is fine. Small bubbly white head leaves sparse lace. Nice pils maltiness on the nose spattered with floral and spicy hop notes. Soft malt tones mix with some bitter hoppiness and peppery spice notes. All in all, this combo of flavors strikes me as pretty average. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated.Body about medium. Not too bad. Not too good."
"This beer is fairly crappy and generic. It pours a boring yellow color with little head and no lacing. The aroma is skunky with possibly a hint of malts. The flavor is much like the aroma, being a skunky bland pilsner. I really didn't care much for it, but luckily it was pretty cheap."
"This pils poured a clear golden color with white foam that left lace. The carbonation action was good. The smell was malt and biscuit - a nice persistent aroma. The taste was malty and biscuity with some floral hops and mild bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp and relatively clean. The body and carbonation feel were medium. This was a good german pils."
"Pours a big, crisp, white head on a crystal yellow base. Aroma is immediately of spicy hoppiness. Initial flavor is milder than expected from the spicy aroma -- is pretty light in body with some decent malt body. A generous (for the style) hop bitterness is clearly evident, unlike in its descendant american pilsners, finishing with just a touch of spicy flavor. Extremely refreshing and light, and easy to gulp, while still holding a lot of interesting flavor."
"Revisited this beer and while a great pilsner, not quite what I had rated it the first time. 12/22/03"
"Crystal clear light gold body topped by a white head. The head was moderate and short-lived, leaving a thin layer of white that left small deposits of lace. This beer has a definite oily look to it, like a heaviness. The longneck brown bottle used for this beer could not be responsible for the light skunkiness of the smell when the bottle was opened, so it must be that the hopping is what is sensed here. The nose is mostly of grassy notes and hay. The flavor pattern is mostly from the hops - fairly bitter and somewhat floral. An interesting Pils flavor to be sure. The feel is moderate with strong crispness in the finish. Long, biting aftertaste."
"EKU Pils: I was thinking that this was the big time octane EKU, but thankfully it was not (as I had to drive). Golden color that is typical of the style, with a nice white head that was extremely long lasting, with terrific lacing. Clean light aroma, but with a little skunk. The skunk in the nose also shows up in the taste, but it is not overwhelming. Light malting, and a decent kick of hops lingers toward the end. Nice, light bodied and flavorful."
"Poured a straw color with a nice blooming head in my pilsner glas,smelled of bread mostly.Nice balanced taste to this beer bread-like at the start but a good dry,hoppy ending.Really good pilsner I would recommend people to try this one,eally if they like tis style of beer."
"A good pils but not an outstanding one. Pours out to the usual golden color of the style but slightly darker than the norm. Puffy, white head that settles quickly. Aroma is that of bread dough and light hops. Taste is refreshing with a nice bit of hops on the finish but nothing overwhelming or exciting."
"A pristine pils"
"The archetypal lager/pils color on the pour, a lucent gold, the head brilliant white, frothy and mountainous in size, after dissipating, it leaves a fine covering sheet of lace. Typical all malt nose that is also fresh and clean, the start sweetly malt, the top skinny, the finish masterfully hopped, minimally acidic, quite dry and an Average beer at best."
"Distinct aroma of mall pretzels and lemonade from a tin. Sturdy malt backs a nice and long steely hop finish and makes for a quality, even brew. Excellent German Pils! Well carbonated, yet smooth and refreshing and drainable. The definition of a session beer. You'll be tasting hops for hours."
