"Solid beer. One of the better commercial lagers."
"Slightly sweet, with a big herbal hop presence and a moderately bitter finish. It's a tad malty sweet, but fairly clean and refreshing."
"The taste of this beer reminds me of the smell of weed."
""
""
"I've had this beer before and will buy it again. Easy drinking, packs a nice buzz. Sports suds!"
"Pours a clear golden colour with a thin bubbly head.  The nose has some sweet malt breadiness with only a hint of hoppiness.  The taste brings much of the same with a bit of yeast and grass.  It almost finishes as soon as it hit your tongue with a crisp dryness.  Honestly doesn't taste like much.  An okay beer but nothing to write home about."
"So overall would I recommend it ? Sure, if you find it on special this is a nice beer I did more enjoy that beer than the heineken."
""
""
""
"Overall: unassumingly complex for a lager. Great balance."
""
""
"Easy drinking beer goes down smooth"
"A classic European beer, not as bitter as Belgian and Dutch beers, nice taste, I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the worse beers i have tried."
"Slightly minty.  Not a typical pilsner."
"Translucent pale yellow.  Nice foamy head.  Smell reminds me of empty beer bottles in need of recycling.  Taste is light with a nice amount of carbonation.  Has a bitter finish that lingers a bit too long.  While I like this style of beer, this one seems a bit lacking compared to others.  Not horrible, but just ok."
""
""
"I love Carlsberg, biases stated."
"Green bottle. Euro roots. Not much else to say - it's a decent beer, but it doesn't do much to set itself apart from other beers in this style."
""
"Overall- an ok beer.  I am sure this beer has suffered in the US market when craft beer took off."
""
""
"Carlsberg looks like a relatively decent lager, and if you temporarily disable your taste buds - it might even fool you that it is a good lager, as it is incredibly smooth. However, as I was unable to do so, I was overcome by the incredibly metallic aftertaste, which completely ruined any sense of flavor for me."
"Smooth & easy drinking clean lager."
""
""
""
"A nice smooth beer. Can be drunk everywhere, everytime."
""
"It's good to drink during a football game."
""
"Just a standard German pilsner; smoother going down than a Heineken, and that's all you need to know about this one."
"This may be the least favorite beer I've ever had. The only thing I get out of this one is skunk."
""
"Not bad had a lot better."
""
""
""
"Good Danish beer, best German Pilsner I have tasted yet."
""
"A mass produced beer that meets low expectations. Not great but not horrendous."
"An average pils, alcohol-y taste. Best in summer to drink ice cold."
""
""
"I may be biased here, but I absolutely love Carlsberg. My sample is a bit skunked, but it's not creating a un-enjoyable drinking experience. If anything, it's making the beer finish on the sour side. I personally find that interesting. Out of all the pale type lagers I've ever had, this one is my absolute favorite. I'd buy this over Bud, Miller, Coors, PBR, Corona, or even Heineken. I don't know if we in American can get the cans, but I'd say buy cans for a more pure taste. I love this stuff!"

"Well balanced and easy beer that's goes down smoothly. A bit boring perhaps."
""

"Refreshing with a bitter hops flavor and slight malty aftertaste. While not very memorable, makes for a nice casual, session beer."

"Super strong pilsner, reminds me of Heineken on steroids.... I actually kinda like it. It does have a bit of a bitter taste, it stays dank and drinkable enough to be enjoyable. With so many good beers out there, not likely I would   Seek it out again... In fact it was a gift. Still pretty good for as much heat it gets~"
"For me a little better than Heineken."
""
""
"Pilsners are one of my favorite styles and I enjoyed this. Lightish yellow. Little head. Good lacing. Smell is hops yeast. Medium carbonation. a little bitterness. Clean. Very good beer"

"Overall – This beer is very popular in the UK and it is easy to see why. It is straight forward and does not do anything particularly wrong. It may not be very interesting but it is a damned sight better than most of the Pilsners I’ve had from outside Germany."

"Flavor: mild combination of sweet malt and those grassy, earthy hops. Taste a bit like a Groslch that has been slightly watered down."
"Overall: Good brew. I would have this one again. Got a pint glass to take home with it too."
"Overall, this is what it is, a widespread, cheap, yet fairly delicious pilsener style beer."

"O- Overall, this beer has a good amount of bitterness with some malt taste. It would of tasted better if there was a little more sweetness to it. It's an ok beer."

"This beer is easy drinking and lacks any strong adjuncty flavors and is a pretty good session brew, but nothing very distinguished. I think I paid around 8 bucks for a four pack of pint-plus cans, which isn't too bad of a deal. This beer is only available in one store in my town that I know of (Hennesey Grocery)."

"Had a bottle at a Calgary Pub in the Kensington area with dinner, poured into a pub glass. Looks darker than many other Euro lagers, a yellow to just shy of amber hue with a smattering of white bubbles. Smells like grainy pale malt, grassy and slightly spicy hops, skunk, and a decent whiff of sulphur. Palate features a light cracker malt backbone, some DMS, green grassy hops, subdued lemon and lime rind, white grape notes, and a noticeable but reduced residual sweetness compared to many of its Euro pale lager cousins; perhaps this is what earns it a bona-fide pils designation. Very fizzy and light-bodied as one would expect, yet reasonably creamy and smooth. Not too bad all things considered. The usual flaws found in green-bottled mass market imports are reduced or absent. Considerably better than Heineken (to name but one example) even if it remains pretty mainstream in overall feel."

"O - As with many beers of the style (and similar styles), there isn't a ton going on. Still though, a very tasty and crisp lager. No cheap filler taste or piss smell/taste. Tasty and extremely drinkable pilsener. Will drink again."

"O- Decent beer. I had it many times in England, but it actually holds up pretty well in comparison over here."
"Overall I prefer the more sweeter balanced tasting Euro Lagers. If this is the ""traditional"" way to have one I may skip mass produced Pilsners all together."
""
"Going through some international breweries that are readily available, so here I come, easy Denmark... This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises mild funky wheat, light skunk, dry wheat, and vague grasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the skunk thankfully replaced by hard water. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, this doesn't taste too far off from every other mass-produced Euro lager out there, though the grassiness does help it a bit in my eyes. That said, I'm not likely to have too many more of these in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a cheap euro beer and not a very good one. Too much apple and just a bit lifeless. Better options out there in this style."
""
""
"O: It has more character than your average European macro lager, but it still doesn't do much to stay memorable. I still prefer this to certain other green bottle imports."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - Light body, high carbonation makes for a very dry crispy finish."

"O - I prefer Carlsberg over both Heineken and Budweiser. It has a little more flavour going for it and I used to drink this quite a bit before getting into more exotic beers. Best choice for me between the common tap beers over here."

"Overall - definitely a little better than the other euro pale lagers. Pretty good readily accessible and easily accessible."

"The smell of the beer is extremely malty and there's only a hint of bitterness in the aroma. Overall, it is a very straightforward smell. The head of the beer tastes very metallic. The taste is more metallic than most canned beers, but it also offers a really nice hoppy taste. It's very standard for a pilsner, but there aren't too many flaws either. Honestly, the bottled version is far superior to the canned one since it doesn't have the metallic taste. I'll say : this is the first time a canned beer for me has had this noticeable of a metallic taste to it. Perhaps I'll review the bottled version another day (or even better, on tap), but it's just... average. Oh well, I'm totally drinking it again for nostalgia's sake."

"This beer is probably suffering from over production. It is a nice pilsner with a long history of production. It is a quality European Pilsner that is very drinkable and quite nice after a long hot day. Be careful as you can drink too many and the after effects are quite nasty. It seems this beer will give you a nasty hangover."
""
"O: an easy drinking beer; nothing special, but still decent."
"I had this on tap at Whiskey Priest. There's nothing intriguing about a super-mass produced German pilsner named ""Carlsberg", but damnit I was curious. Well, I shouldn't have been. This tasted like an upper-middle class Budweiser. The color is pretty nice, dark for a pilsner, but other than that it was a super pedestrian beer. Which I guess is fine for what it is."
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing pilsener. A classic. Somewhat narrow taste, but very refreshing."
""
""
"The pride of Denmark shouldn’t be this forgettable adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Malt forward, unbalanced brew. Not a good German Pils by any stretch of the imagination."

"In a 500 ml tallboy CAN, no less! I Cracked it open and after marveling at its fullness, began a standard Glug, still resulting in a massive amount of dense, eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see into the future. Tomorrow looks to be a nice day outside with me stuck inside for most of it and no beer to dull the pain. Nose smelled like lager, the pleasant kind, with a honey-like sweetness and just a kiss of hops, to borrow from an old advertising slogan. I am not taking the piss, either. I have been subjected to so many shite lagers in CANs over these last several years that I have come to really enjoy a simple, adjunct (read, corn)-free lager when one happens my way. Mouthfeel was soft, not quite creamy, but without the kind of forced carbonation that seems to want to scrub my tongue. The taste was mild and unassuming, slightly grassy, mildly sweet and much like everything that belonged to Baby Bear - just right. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. I CAN easily see myself hanging out in the backyard, grabbing some of these out of a cooler and making a day of it. I CANnot speak for it from a bottle, but out of a CAN, it was just the ticket as a nightcap."

"O: Nothing spectacular, but not too bad. I would recommend it on a hot summer day. It would be an improvement over a domestic lager."
""

"tastes pretty similar to some more basic canadian offerings ive had the mild pleasure of sampling over the years)..seems kind of odd..i know they talked about brewing it in canada here..like moosehead green. but with a cleaner finish. and less malt."

"to me this is a better than average light beer, widely available and far superior to most of the other beers of the same color and light flavor profile. the pour is tall and yellow glden in color, with a few inches of slowly fading white foam. the nose is pilsener malts, could be german or czech, with that grassy fresh cut hay vibe, and some nondistinct yeast strain and just enough hops to still be called a beer. the taste is identical, seemingly with a touch of white wheat malt too, but the pils malt shines here. its dumbed down a little from the genuine article, but it fills a large void in the beer world of a full flavored beer that is golden in color and easy drinking. its much better on tap than in the bottle, and to me is a worthy all day beer when you are trying to not fill up or get too heavily buzzed. light in feel, but not watery at all. there is still some body present. the finish is quick and this is all up not a bad beer for what it is."
"O. Relatively good, feels like a European dos equis. On tap at Abbey inn, Denton Tx 12/21/12."

"Would I buy it again? Yes. Was one of my staples in Europe as well as back in Minnesota."
""
""
""
"The beer smells of sweet, untoasted grains. It tastes mostly of metal, quickly followed by a rush of sweet corn. The sweetness creates the illusion of fruit as I reach the last few sips in the glass. The feel of the beer on the palate is more robust than some lagers; I suppose it complements the sweet flavor nicely."

"O: Well, this beer does not need a presentation. It's far from bad but it is nothing I normally buy either. A typical Euro-Lager."
""
"Drank alot of this in Asia at the hotel taps. readily available, very easy drinking, nothing remarkable to speak of in terms of flavor. I don't know if there might be some preservative added to this stuff in China, but after a few long sessions drinking this and watching football several of us developed a little irritation in our throat, resulting in a chronic mild cough. For my gang it is now and ever shall be the 'Carlsberg Cough'!"
"O: Easy drinking beer. Classic Euro Lager. Nothing but an average session Lager"

"O: Easy to drink and quite refreshing, a pretty good example of the style and surprisingly without the skunky smell that I have noticed in this beer in the US (maybe the version they are getting in China is fresher?)."
""
" Overall a very nice beer. I had it many times before but mostly straight from the bottle and I could also easily find a cold one at my local bar. Now that I can't find it around the corner anymore (except in cans which I'd rather not) I appreciate it much more."

"Tried this while on vacation in Copenhagen. Nothing to really see here, kind of like the Budweiser of Denmark. A typical light pilsner, golden in color and a decent white head. Very similar to it's Danish counterpart, Tuborg. Goes down easy on a hot day in the city. That's about it."
""
""
""
"Overall, could give this all 1's. But holding it up to the standards of all other green bottled skunkfests, it's about the same. Hey Europe, why do you use green bottles? I'm curious."
"Had this on tap at 4Q Danish cafe in Yurakucho, Tokyo. Poured into a Carlsberg pint glass. Clear, light gold hue with a thick beautiful white head. The smell of hops and nuts comes off this pils in a wonderfully unexpected way. The taste follows the smell adequately, and the mouthfeel was smooth yet memorable. Overall, this changed my opinion about Carlsberg which I had only previously tried from the bottle. I enjoyed Carlsberg Gold very much in Singapore, and now I can say that Carlsberg from the tap is a quality pilsner beer."
""
"O: This is a halfway decent pilsener—the only drawback is the skunky aromas in the smell."
""
"The one I tried was the one available in India. Very hoppy and pretty bitter! I thought it was difficult to gulp and took ages to finish a full bottle. Not my style! Like a typical lager its crisp, clean but too bitter for my liking. As usual, it was served very very cold and I could barely taste the malt!"
"This is a decent drinking beer, but it's not a great representative of a German Pilsener. It's light and crisp and refreshing but don't look here for a great Pilsener."
""
"Not a bad German Pilsener. Glad I ordered one. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Music lovers should enjoy this beer with some nice Nordic Jazz. i would recommend Jan Gabarik off the ECM lable. I love HIS cd entitled DIS."
""
""
""
""
"Gold in color, the pour forms a decent white head with average retention and leaves with some laces behind, high carbonation showcase. Smell of sulfur and grass poke to a nose and yeah with a hint of malt. Grainy malt and grassy hop accompany in a taste with smooth mouthfeel from its vivid crisp and carbonation that ends by a dry and clean finish. I once drank this straight from a can and found something terrible. Anyway, through a glass, there is no offensive."
""
""
""
""
""

"D - Given past experiences with this beer, ratings here on BA, and the general mass-brewed adjunct lager feel surrounding this beer, my expectations were about as low as they could be. However, this is a hell of a brew, and does NOT deserve to be lumped in with the average adjunct lager crowd. Drinkability is through the roof. An absolutely great beer all around, and taking style into consideration this is nothing short of exceptional."
"All and all, I consider Carlsberg Lager a very average beer with some good qualities of smoothness, crispness, and drinkability, but also some not so good qualities, namely its boring and forgettable character. It all sums up to a beer that isvery middle of the road overall."

"Overall: I found this can in a liquor store and I was curious about this beer that I'd last had when I was about 16! The whole experience is quite light and I drank my glass before I finished this review, but the beer is alright. It's much better than the likes of the generic adjunct lagers."
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is light and easy approaching with the 5% abv quite tamed. However, the sweetness needs to be cut back a bit for me to be able to drink the glass without putting too much effort into it. It is fairly crisp overall but the aftertaste and sweetness is what just doesn't do it for me. However you want to swing it... pilsner or euro lager, it doesn't matter. This is a one shot wonder for me, having it once was enough, no need to have it again."

"Overall, this was one of my early favorite imports. I have always thought it was much better than Heineken and still do. It is at least as good as Stella and I am glad I revisited it. Every once in a while I will pick some up. I do wish they would change the bottle back to what it was like before. I hate the new packaging."

"Overall Drinkability - Thoroughly let down, especially after trying Carlsberg's ""Elephant"" which was a pretty decent beer."
"O: This just doesn't stand out to me. The dry finish makes it drinkable, but it has a weird flavor."
"I've been studying in london and have been encountering lots of beer i wouldn't normally find in the states. This beer is an average pale lager and is my go to when i can't get stella or becks. This is still easier to drink than the big three light beers at home in my opinion but again is nothing i would go out of my way for. Easy to start of a night with a few of these guys"
"Overall: I would give this one a pass. While it is marginally better than some other euro lagers, there are so many better choices. I don't find it very refreshing because of the strange taste profile."
"Overall-Not enough here to truly recommend, still at heart I think this beer is ok and better than most of its massive Euro Pale counterparts. Worth a try"
"Pours lemon yellow with a decent head. Typical beery scent. Taste is good but slightly iron/ metallic, a decent hoppiness. Odd aftertaste.Overall a surprise, but I would not stock up on it."
"O: Not anything I would purchase for myself."
"It doesn't taste skunked, so I guess it just smells nasty. It tastes dry and biscuity. Not especially good, though. The hops taste cheap and there's not really much good flavour in it to speak of."
"Not much to complain about or to really love here. A decent Pale lager that is perhaps a bit better than many American macros."
"O- Boring and predictable. Nothing worth interest unless you just need something to quench your thirst"
"O - A euro lager that I'm sure us americans get an inferior version. It is quite generic but better than most of the macro produced euros."
"Pours a hazy light yellow 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a thin film. Small spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grain, grass, and a slight skunky aroma. Taste is of sweet grain, white grapes, and some light grass flavors. A pretty good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and this is much better than the Elephant I tried before."
"Just a typical European Lager. Nothing really special."
"Never tried Carlsberg before. I was visiting Solvang, CA, which is a small town that celebrates Danish culture in Santa Barbara County. This went well with a chicken sandwich. Nothing too special in the taste, though it was refreshing. A bit to light for my palette. I probably would not go out of my way to get one, but, wouldn't turn it down if it was offered. Definitely a C+."
" Perfect to drink as a session beer sitting on a sunny European terrace. Would choose this over Stella,or any other ""pinche"" in Belgium. I know it isn't Belgian, but it seems to be served all over Belgium."
"For being an Euro Pale Ale this is fairly clean and balanced (not too sweet), but no surprises."
"The beer is pale golden yellow with chill haze and a white head. It's got that good ole skunky green bottle smell, hints of lemon grass and sweet malt. Taste is very light with crisp lager freshness, lemon and some biscuit with a slightly bitter finish. It's light with sharp carbonation and a dry finish. This is a pretty average pilsner, still highly drinkable though."
"Not the worst lager ever, but a bit too sweet and the overall old, grainy taste of the beer is dissapointing."
"Overall: I always try to avoid this one..by the way, a german pilsner?? This is a European pale lager style as my bottle says, not a german pilsner…"
"Cheers!"
"Carlsberg from the 7-11 in Hong Kong. Gives the skunky smell despite being in a can and a best-before date of May 2012. Tastes fine, nice to have a pilsner that actually brings a little hop flavor along."
"We had lunch with the princesses of Disney at the norweigen village area of Epcot. With lunch I tried a glass of Carlsberg....which was quite nice. The appearance was golden clear with good carbonation leading to a foamy white head. the smell was nothing great...mostly grain. The taste was quite smooth and easy drinking. Went well with the norweigen dishes that we had. Certainly would have this again."
"Nothing too exciting here, but nothing to complain about. I'd drink this again, maybe even by choice!"
"On Tap. Pours deep golden hue with light carbonation. Aroma is of light bready malt and slight hint of hops. Light, smooth body. Taste is a little bit of malt, a little bit of hops but mostly tasteless. I wonder if people drank this beer with closed eyes would they realize the drink beer?"
"Overall – Yet another average and unremarkable euro-beer. It’s very drinkable but nothing about it sets it apart from the rest."
"Final Grade: 3.03, a C+."
"Dr: Low ABV; shite taste. Affordable by Irish standards and off-urine by beer standards."
"Not half bad."
"O: OK. Just a decent quality all malt pale euro lager. I do pick up more grassiness that Heineken which isn't bad. Low on the hop aroma. But overall on a par with the classic Dutch Lager(Heineken)."
"Tastes like any other American beer you can find for $15 a case. Not really a great beer, not even sure it's average."
"Overall - Very drinkable and not very bitter at all. Although also not very complex."
"This is actually a pretty tasty pale lager. It's got a really interesting flavor that I couldn't place exactly. It was kinda on the sweet side, very refreshing it's a good beer for the summer. The color is golden, very nice brew and easy to drink."
"Served in tapered carlsberg glass, pours a light straw color with thin head that is gone quickly; no apparent lacing. Taste is...well, that's hard to say exactly. It's not bad, but unexpected if you're having it for the first time. If I say wrappers from fruit stripe gum, I don't mean to say it disparagingly; it's just so strange. There is a reason it has its own strain of yeast named for it (s. carlsbergensis). Definitely quite unlike any other beer I've had, very intriguing. One of those beers you need to ruminate about and try again to see whether or not you actually like it."
"B"
"D- A decent beer, very easy to chug with few off-flavors"
"RJT"
"Pale gold to yellow in color with a small white head. Aroma is mild, sweet and slightly spicey. Slight skunkiness in smell only. Flavor is fresh and mellow, with sweet notes, and a mildly hopped finish. Crisp mouthfeel, not too bubbly, quite refreshing. Light bodied with a slightly bitter mouthfeel and finish. Easy to drink."
"Pours a clear gold, with a super thin white head. Aroma is a bit funky, and similar to most mass produced European lagers. Flavor is mostly malty and grain, with a bit of spice. However, it's bitter without the nice hop notes. Palate has a bit of fizz, and finishes a bit dry for my tastes. Carbonation gives this the ability to be tasted few more times after its finised. Overall a drinkable, and flavorful pale lager, but not really my cup of tea."
"Pours a pale yellowish color with the scent of wheat and grains. Upon tasting there is a mixture of grains, citrus, and hops. The description of this this beer sounds good, but it basically tastes like a stong cheap beer. It's beer but I doubt too many people will call this their favorite."
"Overall, this is a generic beer, but it is clean and refreshing. In terms of Euro Pilsener's, there are better ones out there."
"The color is a slightly hazy 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Atop the light orange brew sits a one finger head of course foam. The head recedes to leave a bubble ring with just a touch of non clinging lace. Smells of malt and hops. Taste is grains finished with hops. Not a lot of feel in my mouth but some creaminess and body. Not one of my favorite beers, but not on the bottom of the list either. I would order one, while dining out, if it was on the drink menu."
"D: A little flavorful, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, although there are better beers in the style this it still worth pounding down for a while if there aren't many alternatives."
"D - this beer is okay. definitely not a go-to but if it was around and I had nothing else to drink I could drink a few of these. pretty disappointing considering they sponsor my soccer club: Liverpool."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Faint haze was apparent after the pour, marring the golden colour of the beer. A bright white cap didn't linger for long, but left behind spotty lacing, a modest collar, and a thin skim of bubbles coating the surface. Faint aroma, cereal and slight lemon, bread crust. Low to moderate bitterness with floral/citrusy hops and bready malts. Lingering bitterness and slight spiciness. Dry, light bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture. This was a pleasant surprise. Not as strong in flavour as I prefer in a German pils, but the profile was all there. Solid."
"D: Not bad, above average for most euro brews I've had in green bottles."
"I enjoyed this beer pretty well. I could drink this when it's available and I'm jonesing for a German Pils for sure!"
"Drinkability- definitely very easy drinking, i enjoyed the flavor of this beer much more then I enjoyed the only other carlsberg I had years ago which was the elephant which was less then impressed with, this is a style i am into right now the euro lagers and I though this was pretty decent example of the style i would enjoy again"
"Good product for this style. Would not turn down if offered."
"Probably not the best beer ever, but it's not as bad as I expected."
"Poured from a 33 cl bottle into my Coors Banquet pilsner glass. Picked this up at the SuperSol in Puerto for about $1. Best before date of 24 Jun 11. It says brewed and bottled in Madrid. For a Spanish brewed beer, it is not too bad. Pours a light golden with a small head but some mild lacing. Plenty of carbonation evident in the glass. Has that heavy skunky malt smell from the get go, can smell it 2 feet away! Taste is very malty with a faint metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average, some carbonation and fairly light bodied. Drinkability is fine. Probably even better on a hot day after a bike ride or cutting the grass."
"Pours a clean golden/ yellow color with small to no head. In the aroma, sweet and a small pilsner hop. In the taste, a dry pils hop, and a somewhat skunky bitterness. A smooth mouthfeel, with a dry, clean aftertaste. Ok lager, small dry bitter is nice, but nothing outstanging."
"Overall: There are no great qualities after the initial pour. Everything else is just ok or kind of bad."
"D: This is a typical danish macro lager that doesn't make anyone happy."
"Yup, pretty much what I recall. Off-kilter, skanky Euro-swill. Give it a miss, and maybe drink your local beer instead while watching sporting events from half a world away."
"The first thing I noticed was the aroma the citrusy and slightly hoppy aroma that slight esters of grain. It has an average grainy and grassy flavor with a little bit of adjunct esters. It has a little of hops to the taste. The body is well carbonated with a bit of a bite. Overall, it is an average beer. That could work for most situations."
"I doubt I'll have to many more of these unless I'm ever in Denmark and see if the local brew there is better than the imported version here."
"On a recent visit to London, when I got tired of the intense maltiness of all the english draft beers I was having, I'd order a pilsner style beer. Like many of the more commercial beers this was good but not great. Typical color, aroma and flavor of a pilsner, it was none the less very refreshing and one I enjoyed a great deal."
"Notes: Maybe I was expecting so much less from this one. But this offering seems to have been rather fresh, and while unremarkable and not much of my liking, finding a middle of the road lager with no skunky trace, at least on this serving, was quite a surprise. Advertises an all malt bill and today it seemed to be the case. Is it another recipe on this Spanish distribution?"
"This is not that bad of a beer as it hits all the right notes for drinkability though does lack in the hops department compared to say Grolsch. A little on the sweet side but still nicely balanced this is a much better beer than Heineken or Becks. Seems in a can it tastes fresher than in a bottle"
"had a few bottles of this given to me so i didn't pay for it, and if i never have the opportunity to sample this again, i won't be missing anything."
"Taste, wow, still an alcohol burn, not as bad as their Elephant, but still, for only 5%, I would hope there would be a better masking of said alcohol. Minimal hopping, slight bitterness melds with alcohol. No body. Normally, something this basic would get a warm weather recommendation, but because of the high alcohol burn, it just doesn't even come across as a warm weather burn."
"Usual mf for the style, I didn't find this very drinkable at all and I won't revisit."
"this was actually not that bad, i could see myself turning to it again one time, maybe."
"Cheers!"
"Ordered this because it was the only beer they served at the scandinavian restaurant I was at. Virtually undrinkable. Don't waste your time or money on this beer. It should not even be listed as a german pilsner. I made it through a quarter of a pint before I gave up."
"All in all, a clean beer. Nothing to sneeze at, and better than most green bottle Euro macros we receive."
"a very thin final between bitter and acidic, with hints of malt."
"D - It's ok without being exciting so overall it's bearable. Quite easy to drink but just another working-day beer."
"D- There is not anything explicitly outstanding about this beer but I find it highly drinkable and generally inoffensive. Reasonably sessionable. I would, however, characterize it as a euro pale lager instead of a german pils."
"The beer was better than I was expecting, I would drink it over most other European imports."
"I'm conflicted. Here's a beer that looks really nice in the glass, with its clear lemony color, its frothy white head and its zillions of tiny bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Yet here's a beer that smells like skunk and piss and tastes only marginally better and is loaded with gas. If you must drink it, do so quickly. The moment it warms up is the moment you'd rather be drinking bong water."
"This beer is horrible, skip it."
"Looks like a deep amber with healthy head that neither gets bigger of falls off, stays consistant. Smell is very malty and sweet with a hint of some noble hops. Taste/mouthfeel is thick and full with malt and a balanced bitterness. Drinkability is alright."
"Do try it though. It is worth trying most definitely because it's a pilsner that has some unique traits not found in many others (in a good way). Delicious if you want to think about the beer you are drinking (the alcohol is quite the reminder)."
"D. There was so many bubbles in it all it needed was a goldfish swimming in it and it would resemble a minute aquarium!! Seriously it drank smoother than it looked. Not a bad drink - if you are into this type of beer. Great for sinking in one swallow an a hot day as I did, certainly not a beer to get enthusiastic about."
"Certainly a session beer. Not much else to recommend it."
"Drinkability: A potable brew that gos well with beef and pork."
"Taste is cereal graininess balanced by a grassy hop presence. There is still a lingering cardboard and metal flavor that is a bit unpleasant. Still though, it is better than most exported brews that come from countries north of Germany. Not bad, went down easy and the hop flavors were actually pretty nice. I would drink this again as long as it was fresh and not lightstruck."
"I am impressed with this beer. I thought it would be another mass produced German lager that has no character. I enjoy drinking this beer. It has a unique flavor and aroma. I'm totally buying this beer in the future. It's a little pricey but I'd say it's worth the money."
"D: more drinkable than other beers in this price range."
"Very good consistent light and refreshing lager. The mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is great. This beer is good year round, but great for a hot summer day. I felt like I was cheated a bit, because the beer comes in 11.2 ounce bottles. A bit on the pricey side, but it is a much better alternative than something like a Heineken."
"A not bad brew overall, not the most exciting though."
"Big fan of Euro lagers. This is one of the better ones. Smells like a pils,tastes like a pils. Very clean, very refreshing, very satisfying. If you like Heineken, Beck's, Urquell, Moosehead,etc. try this. You won't be disappointed. Denmark hold's their own."
"This beer is quite drinkable. It is one of my beers of choice when faced with sub par Aussie counterparts."
"D -- What can you say? No matter what, this is a whole lot more satisfying to the sophisticated beer palate than BMC -- yeah, you could suck these down all day without thinking twice. Good for a break in too many beers that scream LOOK AT ME! Or even those that say, What're you lookin' at? I'm the king of beers -- you gotta like me!"
"Medium/thin body, little carbonation, though mouthfeel is not terribly inappropriate for the style. Drinkability is very good."
"Drinkability had everything going it's way, this was a six pack goin' down easy."
"This is a very popular beer in Singapore and Malaysia."
"Overall: An ok pilsener with no strong qualities coming through. Overall, it was ok but I doubt I'll drink another."
"Notes: The slogan is ""Probably the best lager in the world."" This definitely isn't true for me at least, but as far as similar beers go, this is pretty good. If you are in a place with limited beer selection, this isn't a bad choice."
"Drinkability: I could probably pound these all night. They just have a smoothness to me that makes the beer go down fast. Or maybe I was just thirsty. Probably the latter. Not very good to mix these with other beers (I'm assuming from the aftertaste), so if you start with one I'd stick to it. I won't make this something I look to pick up often, but I'm glad I tried it nonetheless."
"a very nice slightly pleasant sweet tasting lager. the best ive had so far... in terms of commercialised lager. fun fact . proud sponsors of liverpool football club in england united kingdom. which is a soccer club. it is a very easy drinking lager which i would highly recommend to all you guys."
"bottomline... i like it about as much as becks, but not as much as lowenbrau and warteiner. i like it more than stella and heiniken."
"German pilsner i guess, but I would have to throw this into the whole euro-lager ring instead, and based on that, this is a more drinkable beer than most. This is a simple beer, kinda on the lighter side but still good. I wasn't expecting this to knock me out and it didn't, but it was smooth and refreshing and would be perfect to pound a bunch and watch West Ham kick the crap out of Everton."
"Nose, but light enough that evokes the malt, the body of the beer is quite hoppy and mouth is very bitter. It sometimes feels artificial small side but the finish, still with that strong bitterness and a touch sour and bitter grapefruit that evokes, it is adequate. A good lager, neither more nor less."
"Drinkability - It was a decent lightish beer which was pretty easy to consume, I would drink it again maybe 1 or 2 more times, 3 at maximum."
"the drinkability is good it is very easy to drink a couple of these without batting an eye. a nice, tasty albeit fairly run of the mill euro lager."
"D- This is a drinkable beer to someone I would think....not me but someone. This bottle I had was all metal tasting. I can see BMC fans going ape shit over this beer. Me? I'll pass onto something else. And yes this ended up being a drain pour for me."
"This beer is very drinkable, light, with decent head. This is a very versatile beer, and very widely known. I like this beer, it's not great, but it's good. This is a good beer to start with when exploring into European beers. This is a good beer, not crazy good."
"An okay beer but nothing to write home about."
"I would probably drink this again but only on tap."
"Mouthfeel is its best featutre kind of refreshing but the taste ruins it all"
"Wow, and I didn't think they could make anything worse than Carlsberg elephant."
"d- much better than i thought it would be, carlsberg is very light and crisp and refreshing, with just enough flavor to be enjoyable, i could session this easily. i've had better pilsners but this is not a terrible one by any stretch."
"it's unlikely I'll be spending any money on this beer any time soon, it looks better then it actually is"
"D: Somewhat drinkable, light enough to have a lot and goes down pretty smooth."
"The flavor is honestly bland. There's nothing much to describe it. It tastes like a pilsener, only watered down. Watered down hardcore, like one of those really powerful super-soakers before they went out of business."
"D-Drinkable and enjoyable, but nothing special. I have some good memories w/this brew."
"I can't say as I love this beer but for what it is and if faced with other macro type Euro options, I would probably reach for this over many others of its ilk. I only hope this never happens."
"Light bodied and highly carbonated. A good session beer, I suppose, although considering the lack of pronounced flavor and the higher price tag, I could think of many other beers I'd rather session. Besides that, I can think of several beer within this style that I'd much prefer."
"Overall it's a pretty inoffensive brew that's easy to drink. It's occasionally one of the standbys in my fridge."
"Overall - A nice, refreshing euro-lager. I think I'm more of a Munich Helles and Czech Pilsner fan as far as lagers go, but this blows away any BMC stuff (of course), and is a better option than some of the more accessible import lagers, such as Heineken. Definitely worth trying if you like this style of beer."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Would have again; a really nice beer for a regular drinking need (sports, tailgating, etc...)"
"Drinkability is on the higher side, its a pilsner. I've had better ones of this style though. Not a bad offering. Just nothing new or special."
"This beer pours clear pale golden color, very active carbonation and a small white head that receded to a film pretty quickly. Slight spotty lacing was left on the glass. Nose is of corn, grains, and malts. The carbonation hits you first and then grains come through, a touch of grassy hops hit here that carries a bitterness to the finish. Light bodied, high carbonation, crisp and clean, goes down easily, slightly dry finish. Nothing overly impressive about this beer but one that you can sit with for a while."
"Drinkability: Pass. The skunkiness was hindering, but they completely lost me at the metallic tastes. I would like to look at your coin collection, not lick it."
"On tap the the Lansdowne Pub. Served in a particularly large branded glass. Nice. Dark yellow body. Clear and bubbly. Smell was a bit like wet hops. Taste was not much more than I expected. A typical Euro lager. Has that unusual musty taste that reminds me of Heineken sometimes. Mostly easy to drink, except for that flavor that takes time to get used to. This is the kind of beer that you love if you grew up on it, or it's just a run of the mill beer if there are other choices at hand."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, a great hot weather session beer."
"Like the shape of the bottle that is available in India. The beer is very close to what Tuborg Gron is like, except a little more citrusy. Poured from a pint into a pilsner glass, golden yellow with a thin but firm head. Smelt a little grassy and fresh with citrus notes. Tastes crisp and twangy. Mouthfeel is above average for a macro lager, more weighty definitely. Above average carbonation, definitely not a lager to pick for a beer drinking competition. Good choice for a shandy."
"This was my only option of beer last night at a friends so thought id review it please dont get excited,this beer pours a pale golden straw colour and smells mainly of grain with some feint sweet,hop,malt notes quite bland actually very much a macro invention which finishes quite sweet and blandish the sort of beer you would drink if you just had a really hard day of work and it was steaming hot outside and the beer was freezing cold and was your only option for hours,but in saying that its not the worst macro invention out on the market there is just no love put into this beer."
"I'd rather drink Tooheys New."
"To me Carlsberg is like the european version of budweiser"
"This is brewed under licence by Fosters. Maybe the original is better."
"Carlsberg beer is an okay brew for the swill, but not something I'd make a trek to seek out for. It's quality above an American Adjunct lager, but not to the standard of an average German Pilsner."
"D: I was bracing myself for another middle of the road euro lager. What I got was a light and refreshing beer that was quite enjoyable. Not the most complex beer on the planet, but easy to drink and good for a session with friends."
"A beautiful beer! Love the finish the best on this beer. Has a great bitterness that lingers on your tongue. A good beer to pair specific foods with because the contrast will intensify the meal's flavors. The carbonation is perfect and it's suited for all seasons."
"The drinkability of this beer is solid, as there is nothing in it that I would get sick of or feel overwhelmed by, and the flavor is nice enough to entice me to have another."
"Pours a clear, yellow/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, pale hops, pale malt, and slight citrus aroma. Fits the style of a German Pilsener. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast cleanliness, pale malt, and slight hop. Overall, not a bad pilsner, but the green bottle and long trip have surely skunked the beer to a degree."
"T/M - Medium to thin mouthfeel with a taste that is vaguely malted and hopped but not very outstanding. Everything about this reminds me of the typical Danish macro."
"It's an improvement over the bottle and drinkable."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. It has a rich golden color with a small head. Slightly grainy aroma. Feels light in the mouth and goes down very smooth. Good crisp flavor makes this brew highly drinkable. Overall a good selection, especially on a warm day."
"Drinkable, though it does trail away with a characteristic bad bitterness that shocks just a bit, but not enough to be a turn-off."
"This beer has a bit of a crisp easy feel to it that makes for great drinkability. Is pleasant to have and is really enjoyable."
"Easy drinker, nothing special really."
"Not quite a Spaten, but a decent alternative. Wouldn't refuse one if handed to me, but probably won't buy this again because there are better beers."
"Carlsberg, along with Newcastle, Guinness, Stella and Heineken/Amstel Light will always be nostalgic for me because these beers were my first steps towards drinking better beer. While none of these beers may be remarkable in their own right, they were a part of that step that opened my eyes to new flavors and styles and opened the floodgates into craft beers. As such, I do enjoy a Carlsberg from time to time, usually when I frequent local pizza parlors, and it is a crisp, clean stand-by pilsner in my book."
"So they may be the first beer I have had from Denmark. Poured the usual golden pilsner color with a soft white head and many racing bubbles. Taste was light at first then some faint flavors developed, straw, cereal grain. Mouthfeel was harsh and biting."
"This is a decent job of lager production - certainly not great, but very suitable for sessioning. I notice from the neck that this is a supervised brew done by Fosters and it astounds me that they can do a reasonably good job with this and yet so comprehensively fuck up Stella Artois."
"For what it is Carlsberg ""Beer"" is a good brew, not great but it is good. I really like that initial whiff of Nobel hops when the beer was poured. It did pour a bit light and with a weak head that quickly dissipated to a thin sheet, however. From this respect it does remind me of a macro American lager, for which I'm sure it's a macro Euro-Lager. Taste is clean and crisp with a nice balance between the malts and hops. Nothing special there, just nice. It finishes good as well a nice balance between the dry and the sweet. Body is light and the carb level is supporting. Overall I like this beer and would drink lots more."
"My buddy chose this beer on Saturday night for us to drink. I told him it would probably taste like a Heineken that a skunk sprayed into. I was right. I don't want to go into a huge review here, but all I can say is I hated this beer so much. I'm usually super open minded about beers and give some the benefit of the doubt. It tasted like spoiled Heineken, Smelled too skunky, had a strange aftertaste, weird mouthfeel, looked like flat and boring, and I couldn't even finish a half of one. Sorry :(...I do like their master brew though, so props to that"
"In the appearance, is a pale yellow color, regular head of foam; in the bottle says that this beer is made with 100% of Malt, thing that i agree, both in the smell and taste are lof of malt; the mouthfeel is very refreshing, medium bitterness and light body; the drinkability is good, very ease to take, tasty to watch soccer or to accompany light foods or cheeses."
"Final Thoughts - Well, I have to say, I don't think I'm entering my Carlsberg years quite yet. The beer leaves something to be desired and isn't really unique enough to stand out. Not a bad offering, but there are more drinkable beers I'd rather guzzle (cheaper too) and more flavorful beers I'd rather savor."
"D - A good food beer for a light sandwich or even a burger. I could see this being a poundable super-session beer for a warm spring day."
"Drinkability: Not that great...Can't see myself buying this again...Much better beers out there."
"Not a very charasmatic brew, but I do like it"
"D: This has potential, but the hop profile and off flavors really do not do anything for me. This tastes like a rough, bargain basement American macro with a slightly fuller body and a simplistic noble hop profile for a bit of character and complexity. I won't be seeking this out in the future."
"Just a solid all-around brew, and one of my favorite imports. Carlsberg has an average straw-colored appearance, but every other aspect of this beer is certainly above average. This beer has a nice but not too overwhelming flavor that is nice and crisp, but also makes this beer very drinkable."
"D 3.0 - not bad at all, just not a standout in my opinion."
"D: easy drinking lager, made for hot summer days. headache in bonus"
"taste is clean, grain, corn, sweet malt, and ends a little dry."
"Drinkability: Boring and flavorless."
"Feel is light and fairly smooth. Easy to drink but otherwise not very noteworthy."
"It's not bad, but I feel a bit cheated. I will not revisit this brew."
"Notes from: 2/17/06"
"Drinkability was good, perhaps because I was a bit lubricated at the time. But, if I see this in a list of macros, I'm going for it."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink."
"""Probably the best beer in the world."" Not so much."
"Very easy to drink. A good summer beer also great to cook with. Try marinating a pork shoulder destined to become pulled pork before you smoke it."
"D - a session beer if there ever was one!"
"Drinkability - this probably would go down easily enough but I'd rather choose something else. Glad I finally tried it though."
"Got this beer in a variety pack from World Market. I am surprised I have never tried this before. This poured just an average color and average smell but the taste was pretty good. If had a good mouth feel and this is a drinkable pilsner. I enjoyed this and would drink it again."
"¡Salud!"
"Off the tap at the St. Francis Hotel in Santa Fe, NM this beer was the quintessential pilsner color, pale gold. The head was shocking white, fizzed out quickly and left thin streaks of lacing. The aroma was dry, grain mash and a certain mustiness typical of European macro-lagers. The flavors were mostly pale malt and a light hoppiness with hints of the skunky flavors typical of green bottle imports. Clean, moderate finish. The body was medium/light, the carbonation good for the style and the mouthfeel nice."
"Very easy to drink and very easy to put a few back. Was rather nice on tap. Much enjoyed."
"Drinkability is good because of the nice balance. Very light and crisp, but still has a good amount of flavor, so it doesn't get boring. Very nice session beer."
"To be honest, I only got this beer to try a beer made from Denmark. Really, really boring beer. Just the average Saaz hops/European slight taste, the rest of it tastes like a macro basically. Nothing to set it apart and nothing too great about it. Is it easy to drink, sure. Would I ever purchase this again? Absolutely not."
"Sweet grains mixed with a strong metallic flavor that lingers for a while. The hops don't show up too much, maybe providing a bit of bitterness. Light bodied with high carbonation."
"D - A very average light lager, some of Carlsberg's other products come closer to being a pilsner than this does. If you consider this to be a light lager, it is pretty average; if you look at it as a pils, then it is awful."
"Good session beer."
"Thin bodied and highly carbonated, finish is not quite clean enough for the style. Pretty refreshing and very drinkable. A minor step up from American macros."
"I wonder if they'll end up canning this for the US? That made all the difference with Pilsner Urquell and Bitburger."
"I drank a ton of Carlsberg pint cans while in Ireland a few years back, so seeing it on tap here just brought back memories, and I got one. One being the operative word because there was way more interesting stuff to try, but in a pinch, it satisfies Euro lager urges."
"I've seen this beer on the Liverpool FC jerseys for a while now, and I thought I'd buy it on a whim. I will buy some more, since I definitely enjoyed it and it beats a number of beers in a similar class hands down."
"This beer is better than I expected it to be. Aside from the finish, I think it has a pretty good overall flavor, body, color, and smell. It's easily drinkable."
"D: This is just one of those average, mass-produced Euro beers. There wasn't much personality in the taste, or in the categories. Pass on this one."
"Carlsberg is thin-bodied, pretty flat, dry and somewhat sour. I loved this beer in Imperial pint-sized nonics purchased in a few London pubs 20+ years ago. It was exotic, crisp, flavorful, and new to my teenaged palate back then, but sadly, now it just sucks."
"D: Drank it on a hot day and went down really smooth. Not real special, but solid. Take it over a lot of other American Pils."
"Leaves a satisfying fullness in the mouth. Drinkability is hampered by slightly off aroma though"
"A decent beer, and worth giving a shot if you like pilsners."
"Poured a decent, two-finger head on top of a pale gold body. A good whiff of some hops and something like veggies/grass/grain, more to the veggies side. Very light-bodied, like an American macro, with some crispness bordering sharpness on the tongue. While there is some hops that cause a bitter and dry feeling, they are minimal at best. Goes down semi-smooth with a little dry backbite. Basically, a watery macro Pils that people who like bland dry beers will love and people who want something more should avoid. I will."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side. Very uninteresting."
"Euro Cup 2008 drew me to try this beer,local LCB don't carry it regularly.Pours a golden piss yellow,with a nice size bubbly head,which dissipates rather quickly.Nose is definetly grainy,a little skunk to it and corn.Taste is kinda flat and sour,grain and corn coming through,taste like a typical beer,not what the can advertises that's for sure,Probably the best beer in the world,that's a bold statement to make.Anyhow,easy to consume,goes down very easy,and on a hot summer day,and over ice,it goes down without a complaint."
"This light yellow brew glistened in the not so existent New York sun. The white head disappeared slowly to almost nonexistence. As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell the skunkiness of the beer mixed with light malts and corn. The taste wasn't much different from the smell; it was very light kind of bitter. In my mouth it felt light, watery and fizzy with a bitter aftertaste. I don't think that there are enough flavors to keep me coming back."
"this one is a bit bitter for mt taste. it is a wonderful aroma of hops that trualy come out in this brew. the start is a bit sour but nut to much then the hops kick in, the hop finish is clean and crisp. this one is a bit flat though, their elephant is a much beter brew but i wouldent refuse a bottle of this one if offered."
"For some time Carlsberg's slogan was ""probably the best beer in the world"". Still now, after trying it, I have no clue where they get that idea from. These things may be subjective but if you ask me, this is not even close!"
"D: Relatively thirst quenching and mostly enjoyable. Aside from the sharp citrus bite, there isn't a lot of interesting flavors to speak of. It's a solid brew with decent taste. Worth trying at least."
"D = This is not a very good light lager. Avoid."
"This is an normal pilsner that I think is a slight step up from other available import pilseners in this area. Nothing special about this beer but definatley better than its counterparts. I would not mind drinking this again but I would rather try others in the style."
"Carbonation was sufficient."
"mouthfeel is very thin and watery, even for a macro. drinkability is exceptional, feels just like water. and tastes pretty much like it too."
"D: This beer is light, crisp and refreshing. Nothing that exciting but I would buy this beer again."
"Drinkability: I think that the light mouth feel and 5% ABV make this an easily drinkable beer. I'm not incredibly keen on the taste, but it is rather drinkable."
"Never heard much about this beer so I took a shot and bought a bottle. I wasn't too crazy about it but it wasn't a bad all around pilsner. Would have liked to see a tad bit more carbonation and a little more flavor. It was my first and probably my last beer from Denmark unless I get word of something else."
"D- summertime summertime sum sum summertime. yeah. a nice little pils. i'll save it for the warm weather."
" Not a bad choice for an Imported, greem-bottled Pilsner."
"Drinkability: Above average. Would prefer this over all the American lagers."
"Had this one last night at my friend Michael's house. Always wanted to try it but never got a chance. Veru nice golden color. nice bright taste, like a heine without that weird fox piss-kind-bud taste and aroma. I'll be sure to get tis one again to drink and give it a proper review. You should try one on."
"The beer arrived with a small white head and left bits of lacing. It had a pleasing mild hop aroma and a mild pale malt taste with a decent, if thin, Euro hop profile. Mouthfeel and drinkability were about how you would expect for the style, nothing too special. Not a bad lager. Good for people who like a pilsner without the skunk."
""
"I was actually supprised by this one. It poured a pale golden color with a nice frothy white head that was quite inviting. The smell was nothing great, but not skunky either. Light hops surrounded by sweet malts was in the nose and the taste was not much different either. The flavor reminded me of a smoother, less skunky heineken, with a little thicker mouthfeel as well. If you are fan of euro lagers, give this one a try!"
"D- Mediocre bland lager. Pass!"
"D: simple and enjoyable... good for a long night"
"D-if your looking for a complex brew dont bother it could be very dissapointing,if your trying to quench your thirst or just want somthing better than any old BMC give it a try"
"Uninspiring. Better than common, cheap American Brews, but not by much. Gold in color, hardly any white head. Clear body. Smell is chemically hoppy with pine. . .maybe? Flavor is iffy and slightly skunky, sour. Dry texture and metallicy finish. Not worth repeating, but I do happen to have a 6 pack lying around. . .give aways?"
"Weird. Until just now, I kind of liked this beer.But now upon closer examination, it seems a little thin and lame. Does have some head and lace. Pale yellow gold color. Faint beery aroma. Some hops in flavor, slightly bittersweet finish. Some lingering sharpness on the tongue. Better on draft than bottle."
"The downside to this beer is clearly some skunked up hops in the smell that might turn you away. The green bottle doesn't help either, but drink on. The beer pours a very light yellow, very clear, slightly frothy white head, that disappears pretty quickly. What is left is a white rim around the edges of the glass. The smell is the low point, as mentioned. There are some citrusy tangy smells, maybe a little sulfur, but overall not that good. The taste is quite nice for what this beer is. You will get a nice crisp, light, tangy citrus, dextrin sweetness, without all that much character or complexity to get in the way. There may be some overcooked straw or graininess to this beer as well. This is the ultimate thirst quencher on a hot summer's day. I had this in China this summer and it worked wonders. Sampling this again in a more contemplative frame of mind, this beer is a good drinking beer that requires nothing on the part of the drinker. Lower your expectations and enjoy this beer. No aftertaste, some creaminess and dryishness in the mouthfeel, what more would you expect. L'Chaim."
"pours a light golden color with alot of carbonation. has a really skunky aroma to it, the taste is less than average, has a really skunky flavor to it with a watery consistency, not much flavor though just skunkiness and water. mouthfeel is watery again, it is somewhat drinkable, i guess if i were at a soccer match in europe with alot of hooligans or something"
"Had on Tap at Fado in Austin. Lightish gold, with little white head. A slightly malty, heavily yeasty smell, with an overly bready, yeasty taste that was overpowering towards the end of the beer. Smooth overall, but with a sweetish yeasty, maybe skunky aftertaste. I don't like anything about this beer."
"The beer starts off with a medium, traditional Euro-skunk a la green bottle. The aroma clears up after about 5 minutes to a very mellow extra pale grains and grassy hops with only a touch of skunk. The flavor follows with an almost tasteless sweet flavor that reminds me of a blander version of Heineken, and mild mix of skunk and noble hops."
"Drinkability: An OK brew but it seems to have lost something over the years."
"pours a crystal clear straw yellow color with a good two finger white head that holds very well and some nice sheets of sticky lace. slight weak herbal nose from the hops. light clean malt taste with a slight black pepper taste at the end. mouthfeel light, crisp tight carbonation. a clean light pilsener thats just right for anytime you just want a cold beer."
"The mouth is solidly average. Drinkability is also average. There are much better German Pilsners (should this be a Euro lager?), but there are some worse ones too."
"meh... just make sure you get it in a can instead of the green bottle."
"To borrow from their advertising, ""Carlsberg don't make a distinguishable lager. But if we did, it would probably be the best distinguishable lager in the world."""
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with nice white head that lasted a while. Aroma has a faint hint of skunk to it. Flavor is malty without much of a hop character to it. This beer is very smooth, and the mouthfeel is pretty nice. Lacing on glass is excellent. This beer is offensive in no way and is a pretty easy drinker. I would not seek this out again, but it is not bad."
"Honestly, it is listed as a pilsner, but it doesn't taste too much like a pilsner to me. Too malty tasting. Good beer, but nothing special."
"Drinkability is good if you want an easy drinking light brew, myself I would prefer a nice light pale ale. But suppose it beats drinking Bud."
"This is uninteresting. I would put this in the ""boring Euro-lager"" category and below average at that."
"Probably not the worlds best beer, as the advertising would have you believe. Otherwise there is not a lot to complain about here. As before mentioned, I think this is better than Heineken, but it is still a very average Euro lager (I think the style suits it better than pilsener). I would choose this over most Aussie macro lagers because it is barely costs any more (hence pretty good value) and is better in all areas with the exception of smell, where there is the expected skunk of green bottled Euros."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Straw color with a bubbly white head. Smells hoppy and my bottle had a skunky odor to it. The taste was pretty good malt tasting and better than most american pilseners. Mouthfeel is also good it has a good amount of carbonation but its still very smooth. Over all I think this is a pretty drinkable beer really easy to drink."
"D: A good beer, for being so mass-produced, a light easy beer to drink, refreshing, but not really complex. Miles' line from Sideways perfectly sums this beer, ""Quaffable, but far from transcendent."""
"The mouthfeel alone makes this worth drinking more than one. Will I buy another 6...probably not.. but the price is only 50 cents more a sixer than our domestic 'premium' brands so...stay tuned"
"Pours a golden yellow color with minimal if any head at all. Light and somewhat bland with a hint of malt and grain and very slight skunk. Taste is very strong upfront and somewhat watery/bitter. Leaves a bready aftertaste. Still seems quite drinkable with the exception of the mouthfeel, which I'm not too much a fan of. Leaves some lacing though and it's not too skunky if at all."
"During my times in Europe I've had this one many times. There's nothing special about this Pilsner but we always seem to grab one or two, usually toward the end of the night. Very light in color and taste. Ocassionally you will get the green bottle skunk."
"Drinkabilty: Nice beer, can go again with this one."
"Yellow, straw color pour. White head which dissipates quickly. Macro skunk, some hops in the aroma. Minimal hop and malt accent in the flavors, watery macro, euroswill. A bit of grainy flavor and a hint of hop bitterness. I remember enjoying this beer years ago. Now, not at all. Probably the beer has gotten worse as my tastes have changed. Easy to drink, but why would you want to?"
"My long standing opinion of Carlsberg is that it's a sweet continental pilsener, a little better than most other macro brews, but not by much. Trying to keep an open mind, I found it a little better than my initial presumption, but still pretty ordinary. Pale and yellow, with a nice white head, this is a pretty beer. Its aroma is perfumy and grainy, with a notable herbal hop presence. The flavor is indeed sweet, but it's a satisfying and enjoyable sweetness. The flavor is a bit plain, and I wish that there was more hop bitterness, but it's alright. The beer is light in body, but appropriately so. It's a well made and fairly satisfying everyday pilsener. I wouldn't go much further than that, but it did exceed my expectations."
"sale. Competent."
"Drinkability: An ok beer, not real good for the style. Also a touch expensive for a 6 pack around here (about $8). My curiosity has been settled. When picking a macro Euro lager, I'll stick to Heinekin."
"Served to me with a white 2 finger head that bubbled down fairly quickly. A transparent, golden color. Smell was slightly sweet, maybe with a drop of honey, but what mostly came through was the smell of grains and a bit of skunkiness. The taste was that of a standard, run of the hill marco beer, but a little more pleasant. It was crisp, with a little hoppy bitterness to round off the light malt taste. There was also the tiniest dab of sweetness in there as well. Average carbonation, thin mouthfeel, not at all dry. By no means a terribly unique beer, but if you want a solid session beer, or something fairly light that you don't have to think about, I would recomend it."
"It's somewhat drinkable, especially once you get past the initial few sips.However, It's not something I would go and get a 12er of."
"Not to impressed but there is much worse out there. Although Carlsberg does deserve a lot of credit for brewing innovations. A clear pale yellow. The head just barely hangs on. I think this beer smells a bit funny ( not skunky but weird) a touch of hop. Clean on the palate slight hop taste in there as well not much else. Drinkable but nothing to write about. Ha ha."
"Drinkability- goes down to easy, but I guess that makes it drinkable too."
"D- You could swill down a bit of it, but it's so subpar for a pilsner, why bother? Go purchase some Trumer or even Pilsner Urquell, and save yourself from ""probably the best beer in the world.""... cause it's not."
"Pours a nice light gold color. Decent head that fades away quickly. A good amount of lacing is left on the side of the glass and in patches. Lower carbonation, kind of a skunky smell, but the taste belies the smell. It has a decent taste... its almost as if I've had it before... In other words, this beer seems kind of like a standard... Not the best, but definitely not the worst."
"330 mL bottle. Pours a pale, clear, yellow color; white, fizzy head initially, 1.5 cm tall. The head diminishes quickly. Very mild aroma, can't put my finger on it. Non-distinct flavor initially, finishes mildly bitter. In general I feel as though this beer is too watery and is no longer appealing once above the chilled temp. Pretty disappointing."
"Drinkability: The beer's only saving grace is its thin texture, which makes it easy to drink. The near-complete lack of any flavor would make me search for another beer pronto."
"I poured this beer from its green bottle into a tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice straw color and had a fine bubble white head that did not last long. It had decent lacing though. The taste and smell were fresh. Nothing really special about the beer but it is a good refreshing summertime brew. I will buy again."
"This is a classic beer. I remember the commercials as a child with the famed Carlsberg Clydesdales. Haven't seen those in years, makes me wonder if they still have those. This beverage has an alright aroma, typical beer aroma. The colour is a nice golden colour. It has a smooth mouthfeel. The taste is bland, similar to other beers of the style. One thing of note is that this beer tastes better ice cold than at room temperature."
"D: very drinkable. I enjoyed it. Great thirst quencher."
"This is a great Euro-style mass-marketed lager. It's a great thirst quencher. I have a special affection for Carlsberg, as it's one of the first 'real' beers I ever tasted (aside from Guinness). I first experienced it very close to source while staying in Denmark for 4 days as a student in the very early '90s; good memories."
"Drinkability- Crisp, clean, and has the potential to be a pretty good session beer."
"drinkability - Not much going on here for me, light watery."
"Overall this was the first beer i ever bought, so there will always be a special place in my heart for this simple thirst quenching brew."
"On a recent trip to Ireland, I noticed that next to Beamish, Murphy's, and Guinness, Carlsberg & Heineken seemed to be the next two most popular beers. Like Heineken, Carlsberg also has that little bit of skunkiness to it, but I did enjoy it. The appearance is a bubbly yellow with a foamy 1+ inch thick head, leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The smell was a bit hoppy, as was the taste. Overall, I enjoyed this and might place it a little higher than Heineken. Has a dry finish and the mouthfeel is good. A considerable amount of carbonation. Could be a very good session beer."
"Overall: brisk, refreshing, but not very special pale lager. If not presented with better options I could have another one."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and enjoy. A step up from the typical Euro/American macros, in my opinion. Not the best beer in Copenhagen, however."
"I was pretty disappointed with this and can't see any reason why I would buy this again. Unless you can't spare the 50 extra cents, buy Heineken. Or if you can spare a dollar buy Grolsch. Or if you can spare 2 dollars buy Stella."
"It's been quite a while since I've had this (and that was in Europe), but I was not impressed this time. It was much too sweet for me, at least for a pilsner. I'll probably pass in the future."
"Overall a pretty good pils. Very drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable beer. For what I perceive as being a ""mass produced beer"" this is exceptional."
"Dry and crisp. Bitterness from hops cuts well on your tongue. You can taste the pilsner grains and the hops. The aftertaste lingers in good way. A very clean beer that cannot hide any flaws and there are none to hide. I would buy this beer again in the summer."
"Overall a clean lager, with a malty balance that feels out of place. Highly drinkable - certainly better than the American Macros, but not the best Pilsner available."
"Pass on this one."
"Its drinkable (if cold enough), but why bother?"
"Don't know why this is classified as a pilsner, it tastes exactly what a premium version of Hieneken might taste like if possible. Pours a dark golden color out of those damned 11.2 ounce Euro-bottles, little head, but a very German beer-like appearance. The smell is mostly malt, but a very good, and thick malty flavor, unlike the american counterparts that are trying to be this beer. The taste is very much like an unskunked Heineken (it was on the dimmly lit top shelf...), and is quite satisfying for what it is. A damn good lager! Pilsner...not so much, very little hops to this Danish beer. The mouthfeel is suprisingly heavy for a lager. It has the hop oil charachter to it, but not the taste. It's quite wierd. The drinkability is damned good, from my first expierance, I could drink these all day! A well done and celebrated lager from Europe!"
"D- Easy to drink but bland. Pretty much as expected for a euro macro. Would be OK beer as hot weather thirst quencher."
"worth a try my arse. if it looks like a bud and it smells like a bud and it drinks like a bud, is it not a bud?"
"Mouthfeel: Light to medium carbonation, fuzzy carbonation, smooth and a little watery. Easily drinkable, doesn't stand out from the pack however."
"Poured medium gold with a sudsy coarse head that dropped to a half inch fairly quickly. Carbonation was lower than normally seen in this style, and this may have contributed to the slightly watery mouthfeel. Aroma of Sazz mixed with a bit of skunkyness [what IS it with Continental European brewers and green glass???] . Taste was thin and unexciting; honey sweetness of malt and a pang of bitter hops. Ho-hum. European macro Pilsner. Better than American macro by far, but still, nothing special."
"Final Statement: It's ok if you're in the mood for getting drunk and watching football, but for a nice relaxing brew... no way. It's just not satisfying. I'm sure it's much better in Europe."
"I found it very easy to drink, damn near alcoholic water (who wants that?). Lousy. It is nothing more than Euro-swill for folks who dont like much flavor in their beer. My English family and friends like Carlsberg, damn shame really. Why drink local artisan ales when you can have this? Nothing Id buy again; boring forgetful. How long has this beer been in Omaha before I even tried it? Anyway purchased in Omaha; skipable."
"Nice and refreshing when served very cold. Easy to drink."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. I could easily drink a six pack or two of these when tailgating or when sitting back on the couch watching a game."
"Smell is wheaty, mild carboniation, tastes better than expected, good taste for a macro, has crisp taste, some floral characteristics and mildly sharp hop bitterness throughout. All and all a fine beer."
"D- Meh."
"I'll crack one of these open with a spicy meal anytime."
"Carlsberg Beer was a clear golden color with a thick white head. The head had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing behind. The aroma was light, but hops and a little malt were noticeable. The taste was more hops than malt with a dry finish. The body was fairly light with medium carbonation. It's refreshing and quite drinkable."
"On tap at Lynch's in Jacksonville Beach. Pale yellow in color, modest off-white head. I remembered this fondly from many years back, and had been meaning to try it again. My mistake. Aroma was very light, mainly some malt. Flavor was very bland, a little bit of hops was about all I picked up. Mouthfeel was fine, quite light with medium carbonation, no drying or astringency. Overall, might work as a lawnmower beer, but much too bland for my taste nowadays."
"You know, I have to admit that Carlsberg isn't *quite* all a man needs, but it really is above average for the US, and certainly better than a lot of cheap Euro brands we get here (See: Heineken, Amstel, et al). Every time I drink Carlsberg I'll raise my glass to my tattooed Swedish friend. Johan, you may not drink the finest beer, but you could have done much worse!"
"I am rating the European version on tap that I had while in Ireland. Neither the botttled nor draught versions that I've had in the States can hold a candle to the stuff overseas. The bottled U.S. version is much skunkier and overpowered with unbalanced hoppiness. The draught is better, but still not to the level of the European offering. The color, nose and taste are all equally solid with hoppiness being the main characteristic. Slight corn and grain are present but not dominant. A crisp clean finish dominates a smooth drinking, refreshing pilsener. If you find yourself in Europe imbibe without reservation, but in the U.S., proceed with caution, it pales in comparison to it's European cousin."
"Carlsberg Beer pours yellow with a white head from a green eleven point two ounce bottle. Smells skunky, just like I expect a Euro lager to be. Skunky hop flavor and metallic notes. Nothing to particularly recommend this as there are plenty of other, better beers in this style."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a hazy golden color topped with a fizzy, white head. Husky grain aroma. The flavor is light grain with cooked veggies. It's similar to many macros, but better than most. A bit sweet and sticky. Drink it fast, because a nasty sour flavor appears as the beer warms. Overall, this is a weak beer and I doubt I will try it again."
"Bottle (brewed under license by Mcauslan in Montreal): Poured a yellow color lager with a medium white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of sweet malt is more present then expected with some crisp hops. Taste is a notch below your average pale lager with some crisp hops that are actually discernable. Im guessing that I fell on a recent batch because this is really better then expected."
"Overall: Very clean, and very drinkable, due to good balance. Perhaps the best lawnmower beer that I have yet tried."
"by itself, i don't think this beer deserves such a low score from me. it's really not bad - but - i have had much tastier and overall better german pilseners, including many great japanese takes on the style. so if i want a cheap can i'll go with Löwenbräu, and if i want a german pilsener i'll take my pick from the ridiculous selection at every store in japan."
"Carlberg kicks arse!!"
"Ratehr ok beer to be consumed on a warm and sunny day as I did."
"Smelled a little bit like corn. The corn taste came through while drinking it. It was slightly hopped. It was pretty smooth and crisp. I was very pleased that it wasn't skunky at all, despite the green bottle. Overall, it is a pretty good European beer."
"Serving was lightly chilled poured into glass mug. Poured golden amber with dry white head, lacing abounds. Smell is sweet and grainy, better than most cheap green bottles, but barely. Taste is thick, corn is very present, no skunkiness. Full bodied mouthfeel. Not horrible, better than most American macros and cheaper. Only complaint is 11.2 oz bottles and not 12 oz."
"First taste is a bit more hoppy than expected, nice bitterness. The cheap malts really come through, but there is a pleasant lemony zest in there that almost makes me forget about it. Nice mouthfeel, not over-carbonated, very drinkable in my opinion. As far as macros go, I'm OK with keeping this one in the fridge for my buddies for drinking while watching football matches, nobody will argue."
"Drinkable: I could do without ever having to drink this ever."
"11.2oz grren bottle with no freshness date. Average import type beer. 1 finger white head that faded rather quickly and average lace for the style. Again average smells - a bit skunky, honey, fairly clean. Slightly sweet malt with a bit of citrus and a dry prickly hop falvor that fades halfway through. Clean and crisp. A slightly better than average import macro (from Canada, not Demark). I could and have drank a bunch of these."
"Clear, golden color with a medium yet dense fluffy white head. Aroma is a bit sweet corn and a bit estery. There's also some yeast flavors I'm getting. Taste is really well balanced. It might lean a bit towards the malt side with a clean grain flavor followed by an almost sweet and sour yeasty bready note. Some floral type hops come and dry out the grains leaving a clean drying finish. There's a great mix here of malts and hops and everything seems to be working well together. Easy drinking and smooth. I quite enjoy this beer when it's on tap. Much better than the bottled version."
"This beer is very drinkable. The color is that of a traditional pilsner, and the head when poured into a glass was white, but disipated before the beer was finished. The taste was very light, with a slight tart aftertaste. No skunkiness detected. Aroma after pouring much better that straight after opening."
"Carlsberg is golden with a large, ultra-white head. Carbonation levels are very good. Aroma is of a sweet, grainy malt with a touch of herbal hop. Surprisingly no skunkiness is noted. Taste is more of the same: sweet, grainy malt. Malt body is thicker than expected, as is the level of herbal hop flavor. Cereal adjuncts are noted, but don't provide a foul flavor. Overall, this is way better than I expected from a green bottled euro brew, Carlsburg's level of flavor makes this a recommendable session lager."
" Just another run of the mill European lager that has hit a run of good marketing form in the past few years."
"Pours a light pale yellow color, some carbonation, very small head, not much lacing. The scent was skunky and that's about it. The taste was watery with some malts. Light body. I had to try this out, since I see it at the liquor store all the time. Will not buy again."
"Drinkability: A good beer for the summer, crisp and clean though lacking in character."
"Whether I remebered wrong or the can affected it but this was bitter water , wlbeit cold , but it really had nothing there at all"
"Pours a fairly light yellow with a very small head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells a bit grainy with some bitterness. Tastes crisp, with enough hops to let me know it's a beer, but not too much more. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, but not too bad, and the beer is quite drinkable. I confess that my review might be a little biased sonce Carlsbeg sponsors my favourite football club, but I thought that it was okay. Not something I'd drink often, but if I was offered one on a hot day I'd accept it and enjoy it."
"Pours a nice golden color with no head at all, dumped the bottle into the glass and still no head. There's not much aroma at all, a slight smell of yeast, and some of skunkiness. To be honest, I expected more skunkiness from it, being an import in a green bottle. The taste isn't too bad, not much flavor at all. A little sweet, a little bitter on the back end. Finishes fairly clean. The mouthfeel is very creamy, not too much of a hit from the carbonation. All in all, it's very drinkable. Probably the best danish beer I've had, not that I've had a lot, but usually they're very skunky and very bitter. This is more balanced and drinkable. I might get this again if the price is right."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is also about average. It is ligt bodied and smooth like water. After I have swallowed the beer it seems to make my tongue water. Right after I swallow my tongue seems to be dripping from the front, as if I were expecting to eat a nice large steak. This beer is easy to drink but I fear that after a few of these the skunk-like smell might induce a headache. I don't think that this is a beer I would buy again, there's really nothing that special about it that makes it worth buying again."
"D - Good drinkability. I would try it again sometime."
"Thanks"
"Mouthfeel is crisp and creamy, along with a mild bite for a lager. Not bad. I enjoy this much more on draft than in bottle."
"A pretty good beer for a macro. And nice bottle!"
"Is this really a pils? I think it would be better to call it a Euro Pale because it is just too light to even be a pils."
"Pours a golden color without much head or lacing. Very little to work with in the smell department. Some malt character is detectable, but not much else; unusual for this style. The taste is relatively bland without much flavor or distinctness. More of a light lager taste to it than anything else. The aftertaste isn't overly bitter or powerful, a positive for this beer. So, despite it's bland taste, it is a mild beer that is relatively cheap and readily available. A decent beer to have on occasion."
"It's an alright lager, all said and done, but when you've got such a huge range of much better pilseners on offer, you'd be crazy to pick this one."
"Probably the best beer in the world .... and it's probably not Carlsberg ... at least it's one of the best advertised beers in the world .... I admit it did help that Carlsberg put their logo on the shirts of my fav football (""soccer"" for Americans) team (FC Liverpool of course ...) ... the problem with this brew (as with some other global brands) is that it's quite difficult to judge how close the bottle you are drinking is to the original (if you do not happen to be in Denmark that is), as most of it will be brewed under licence by a local brewery ... in general, brews under the name of Carlsberg Pilsner are decent lagers, with a hoppy taste and a medium-rich body (for a lager), not very spectacular, but no disappointment either ... or as they say, Danes don't lie ..."
"Magnific Dansk beer, its combination of hops, give an special like a weath taste, its presentation its special for american food and snacks, not recommendable for a mexican or latin food, one of my favorites euro beers, has a touch of ancient bohemian beers, its presentation is like a heineken, but without the great flavor."
"I was expecting a less favorable beer, but I think this is a pretty solid Pilsner. I could see where this beer would have some trouble with it's green bottle and freshness issues if it has sat on a shelf for a long time, but this beer is enjoyable."
"Absolute ass. One of the more offensive smelling brews I've had the misfortune of having, it reeks of skunked hops and cooked corn. Every bottle I've ever tried of this stuff smelled like a bag of old grain that had gotten wet and left to fester. Once you get past that, you're presented with a grassy, adjunct filled euro skunk lager. I've really never had a good bottle of this stuff and would much rather drink Busch. Yeah, I just said it. Why this is as expensive it is in many stores defies imagination. At least Heineken seems to be making an attempt to deskunkify their beer. I had in on draught once in Europe though and it wasn't quite as bad, just kinda an average pale lager. Stay far far away in bottles, however."
"D = A pit pricey but ok. Often on sale in Australia."
"A better than average pilsner. It's a good beer in the golden color, white fleeting head and carbonation. Better than average in the aroma with little corn-like aromas and not over hopped. Taste is nicely malty, noble hop balanced and subtle spiciness. The beer is balanced properly and no flavors dominate others. Firm, yet light body supported by moderate carbonation. Finishes light, airy, and crisp; leaving little sweetness or tartness."
"Enjoyed this beer while visiting Norway. This beer was a nice example of a pilsner. Light in color and very clear. Considerable lacing on the glass that persisted to the end. I was impressed with the clean taste and non-existent aftertaste. Very nice."
"Appearance is a light gold, a bright white foam and a little lace. Aroma is skunky with some cooked vegetables, silky mouthfeel. Clean and dry Middle is thin followed by a sweet malty finish that has a grapefruit finale that is quite spicy. A mediocre beer."
"poured a deep yellow color with large puffy head that quickly feel to a light coating. Smell is slightly sweet with a touch of malt. Taste is a bit on the dry side with a sweet note. Mouthfeel is a little crisp but not as much as I prefer. Average at best."
"I had this beer on a trip to Denmark. I could smell the brewery from where I stayed. The beer poors a golden yellow, with a small head. The head disappeared quite quickly. The smell of somewhat herbal, somewhat hoppy. The flavor is smooth and crisp. All around a good Pilsner."
"I think we all have to do our part to keep beers flavorful and allow the public to get their money's worth. It's encouraging to know that domestic microbrews are gradually replacing these bland imports."
"Carlsberg Pilsner (the more generic 'Carlsberg Beer' is seen on the label) is an okay beer, but it isn't one that I'll purchase again. I can't help but think that with a tweak or three, it might not be too bad."
"Drinkablity is fine, very similiar to any other Euro beer in a green bottle, nothing great, but still slightly more drinkable than American Macro Swill."
"Even though its from Denmark, the bottle looks Irish. This looks like a St. Patrick's Day bottle if I've ever seen one. It pours a golden color with an enormous sized foamy head, yet no bubbly perspective or any other noticeable form of carbonation. The smell is terrible. It reeks of an awful skunk-odor, not the bitter skunky smell you would expect from a german pilsner, but just a really old, bad skunky smell. The taste is not much better. Its a touch hoppy at first, but that is quickly drowned by an onslaught of horrible bitter skunk. The aftertaste is really bad. I'll probably never try another one of these. Even considering the style of beer, it is still way out of hand, and not enjoyable whatsoever."
"Clear, light yellow body with a small, puffy white head and lots of bubbles. Nose is sweetened honeyish malt and Corn Chex cereal with a wallop of skunky euro hops. No surprises so far. Taste is much the same, with lightly toasted and sweetened malts up front, followed by skunky, cardboardy hops. Lightly bitter in the finish with a light fruity sweetness. Not terrible, just okay."
"A good refreshing beer from Denmark, if you should see it on the shelf, dont be afraid to try it."
"A clean fizzy yellow beer. Has a big white head. There is a hint of skunkiness as you bring the glass to your mouth followed by light touch of lemony citrus. Watery mouthfeel and lack of any real body to this beer deliverys completely flat taste experiance."
"It pours out a decent enough looking lager, nice two finger creamy white head that possesses good retention and leaves its fair share of lacing. Clear gold in colour, leaning more towards the lighter side, but a ways from being pale like straw. The aroma is pretty good as well, deep bready malt underneath sweet grains, with a small presence of grassy hops. A lager with a couple layers of aroma, not too shabby. Ooops, and then I took a sip and wrecked that pretty picture. I'm trying to discern whether it's the grains or the yeast that are guilty of giving off that bitter/sour flavour. The aftertaste would point more directly to the grains. It starts off unsassuming enough, crisp grain, and then you get sucker punched by sour grains in the middle, and after that you forget why you were drinking this in the first place. No hops to greet you at the finish, they were frightened off long ago by this off-flavour monster which instead dons the hop's glasses and nightgown, waiting for you, Red Ridinghood, to catch you off guard and pounce on you once again. And it lingers... I had this rated a bit higher for taste until the aftertaste hit me. And yet through all of that torment with the flavour, the mouthfeel is quite good for a lager, light and creamy smooth, I wish most macro lagers had this sort of mouthfeel (well, and better taste as well....). In fact this is a decent lager on most counts, except for the flavour, which of course is where everyone lays down their money. And because of that, aside from it's other better attributes, makes this beer far less drinkable than it actually should be, I know I won't be picking up any more of this. And in light of that will always be under the assumption that the Danish are holding out on us, as Carlsberg makes more than enough other beers alone, aside from Denmark's other brewers."
"Friend was serving this at a party. Thought I would take a couple of notes. It poured a slight gold color, with a thick foamy head. The smell was wrong. Skunky? I just clump that aroma under the Heineken repulsiveness. The flavor is not particularly complex with only a mild hop bitterness at the end of the sip that was worth noting. The mouthfeel was rather fizzy. However, I still found this beer very easy to drink, but that may have been because of the company. Not sure I could sit at home and drink one of these."
"Pale ""Euro Lager"" gold color. Nice creamy white head that quickly fades. Lots of bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Typical pale malt aroma, slightly skunky and vegetable. Pale flavor, fairly clean. Moderatew amount of hop bitterness comes out in a floral flavor. Much more hop character than other beer in this style. Light body, high carbonation. This may be a bit better than its counterparts. Still, not much to write home about."
"The mouthfeel is just a little creamy and very crisp. Great session beer."
"Wasn't much for a smell, maybe a bit of sweet malts, and not much hops. Highly carbonated, the flavor is a lot nicer and rounder than most lagers. Crisp and refreshing, easy to drink."
"Even though it's been over 20 years since I was there I recall Danish beers being bolder than this and relying less on hoppy bitterness. Maybe this is an ""Americanized"" version for this side of the pond."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours a very clear golden color with a tall head that sticks around a while and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice and malty and doesn't have that typical 'lager stank' that I was expecting. Probably a fresh keg. Some sweetness in the aroma as well. The flavor is nice. Clean and smooth. Slightly malty and not much hops. Thin body. Great drinkabilty, but lacking a bit in flavor strength."
"On tap poured into a Carlsberg pilsener glass. It pours a clear light gold color with three fingers of head. There's lots and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty. Lots of sugar and honey aromas. Maybe just a bit of hops. The taste is light, with more honey and some grassiness. Not much hops, just there. The body was a little light and watery. The drinkability was really good though. Just an average lager."
"Drinkability: Nothing about this beer is desirable."
"It's alright to drink once in a while, but not anything I would buy myself."
"Damn why did I have to buy a ""six""..this is not good beer not even an average lager."
"Also, I got it at a domestic beer price, because it is technically domestic...nice not paying $2 more a six-pack."
"Japonese restaraunt + Brazilian city = draft beer by Carlsberg??? Ok, I'll bite, so i ordered one up, I've never had Carlsberg before so it was worth a shot. It was actually not half bad looking a 2 finger white head rested upon a golden color body. Smell was faint but pleasant. Taste left a little to be desired though, reminded me of heineken or kaiser. Mouthfeel and drinkability were borderline. Worth a try? yes. Worth two tries? no."
"Carlsberg Beer is known in Sweden as Hof, the Danish word for court after the large text on the label that once informed the buyer that Carlsberg is a purveyor to the Danish court."
"Notes: Nothing terrible here, but not much to say, really. Average all around, second-tier import."
"Mouthfeel- thin. Overall I can drink this- not my favorite style, but it's ok."
"This is a step up from Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. but not by much."
"Not a bad lager, easy enough to wash down but unappealing"
"Easy beer to drink. Pretty average though. Nothing really stands out. Much better than typical macro brews but lacks the character of a craft brew."
"Taste is grainy, light and dry, bordering on overcooked. I strongly suspect corn. A metallic aftertaste. No more hops that the typical sex-in-canoe lager; I'd actually reach for a Blue before another of these."
"Overall, what I would consider an average lager."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It is light and refreshing, boasting of pale malts and lager yeast. It has a slight green bottle skunkines, but it's very mild compared to some. The taste is decent. It is a typical lager with a slight green bottle flavor. The palate is mostly pale malts and mild hopping; nothing too surprising. It has a clean finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well. This is a damn fine lager."
"What to say, what to say? An average macro lager, better than its American counterparts. I wouldn't pay ""import"" prices for this one, and I France I prefer Kronenbourg 1664."
"Drinkable, but weak."
"Drinkability  If you could get this without the skunk it might not be half bad."
"A fairly decent lager that certainly won't frighten anybody."
"If your experience with Carlsberg differs from mine, it may be because my bottles were brewed at the Carib Brewery in Champs Fluers, Trinidad; which is about as far from the Netherlands as one can get and still find this beer. This may also explain why I thought Carlsberg was very much like Carib Lager without the aftertaste. As my mother suggested, perhaps Carib Brewery makes their signature brew and Carlsberg on the same line and just uses different bottles for each. A ridiculous suggestion, but amusing and illustrative nonetheless."
"overall the flavor and aroma arent bad. however, that butteryness really brings it down a level or two for me."
"The examples that I have had in the US are skunked due to the typically rediculous green bottles."
"I was fairly impressed with this one. Poured a light golden colour with an acceptable snow white head. Nice, moderately hoppy smell. Trace amounts of biscuit and faintly reminded me of asparagus. Not alot of carbonation which made it easy to drink. A pretty good lager I'd probably buy again."
"wouldnt go out of my way to drink this, but still not something id knock back if i was sorely in need of a beer. i suppose this brew is yet another example of how a style of beer varies from region to region."
"This is Canadian-brewed Carlsberg from a green 12 oz. bottle. It pours slightly darker than most US macros: a bit of gold instead of pale yellow. Unlike many others, I got no skunkiness. However, little about this beer distinguishes it-either for better or worse-from many other ""European"" lagers. The taste is slightly grainy but not offensively so. Hops are just detectable. With the light flavor and crispness, it goes down like water."
"This beers pours a clear moderately light yellow with a smallish white bubbly dissipating head. The smell was a deceptive maltiness. The taste is bland and watery with very little hoppiness or flavor of any kind. To me this was a very unimpressive beer with almost no flavor, sort of on par with Coors light only much better looking."
"All the European macro breweries seem to like making unspectacular, slightly bitter yellow beers and putting them in green bottles. This one fits the same mold. Not really worth the import prices."
"Simple, but somewhat satisfying, this is not a bad beer. I will not go out looking for it, but it was a pretty good drinker for a day at work. It is pretty light in body, and it is very smooth. It has a strange buttery kind of flavor to it. Lots of sweet malts and bready grains make up the flavor. It is really nothing special, but it did me no wrong."
"Not a good beer. I would select something else."
"Typical green-bottled skunky euro-lager. Generously carbonated, pours to a frothy white head that falls to the sides and sticks around with a little lace. Aroma is severely skunky (not necessarily the brewers fault, must be lightstruck) but suggests spicy noble hops. Flavor is typical hop/grain/alcohol and tons of fizz. Finishes with a slight bite and refreshing throat tickle. If I had to choose between this and a Mickey's malt liquor, it'd be a toss-up, honestly."
"The head was white, small, soapy in texture with fine-small bubbles.The body was carbonated and clear.The hue was gold and the nose was fruity.The lacing was only fair with this beer.The flavor was bitter with an aftertaste.The mouthfeel was smooth, tingly on my tongue and thin.This beer lacks character as there is not much that I can say about it."
"Kind of your average Euro-lager. Light gold color, large head. Light tasting larger style beer. Slightly hoppy, nice mild malt, slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is round. Good Balance. Smooth taste. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter, some sweetness. Not green bottle skunkyness."
"Clear gold appearance, head piles up to a white and fizzy 3/4 inches and settles down almost as fast to foamy patches, some of which stick to the glass. Slight skunk aroma, some sense of cream corn smells as well. A pretty dry Lager, minimal sweetness with light herbal hops and sulfur in small amounts coming in from the nasal passages. Relatively clean finish, carbonation a little too high for my tastes. Drinkable enough, doesn't differ markedly from many of these so-called ""imports"" from Canada -- and there's that added skunk ""cachet""..."
"I picked this up to appease a friend from Denmark who urged me to try the beers of her homeland. I'm pretty sure she's unaware of how bad this is, and I'd like to think there's still a good Danish beer out there for me, somewhere!"
"I recently had this again while on vacation in London. It is a rather non-descipt beer. OK to sit back and have a few, but no compelling reason to go out of your way to buy it. Pretty typical fizzy yellow color and taste. Not much aroma. Still, better than American Macros."
"Got a free can during a poker game. Tried this swill before and wasn't impressed, but considering the beer selection, this was what I'd drink. Poured with little to no carbonation, resulting in little to no head. Smelled a little more malty than what I remember the bottle version to be, but still corny and alot of cheap adjunct. Bland taste. Little corn adjunct, slight malt, very little hops. Yeast was detected on teh tongue. It's drinkable swill."
"A Carlsberg chemist, Emil Hansen in 1883, invented the single cell yeast culture strain. Brewers worldwide know it today as Saccharomyces Carlsbergenis. So you would think that with such distinction to their name, they would take extra measures to produce a beer of equal merit. And, IMHO, Carlsberg beer is does produce a nice, mild everyday, lager. Clear pale gold in color, light bodied, with a fairly sharp metallic hop bite and a nice white head. The draft version is smooth and less harsh with a hint of sweetness. There was no skunky aroma in the draft version and that made a world of difference in the aroma and drinkability rating."
"F."
"It's pretty damn similar to a typical American macro. Add skunkiness to it and you have yourself one very unattractive brew. And it costs a LOT more than American macros. There is nothing to gain from this beer. I would love to try it fresher than I got it, but the skunkiness was overpowering in the aroma just completely turning me off. As far as flavor, there was a certain peppery spiciness in there that surprised me. Other than that, it was very bland. If you can get it fresh, go for it. If not, spend your money on something else."
"The taste is an average lager taste, sweet but considerably bitter showing off a good range to its tones, which doesn't harm a nice mouthfeel. I could chug a few of these down, but its not my top choice."
"Smells of bright, sharp hops, very clean and has some malt and sweet spice but is all very faint. Taste is more of the same with a weel balanced sweetish malt and spiced hop thats clean and refreshing, and lends itself into smoothing, but is a little on the uneven bittery side in the hop bite. Feel is light and wet with no real rounded or bold, standout qualities. Givin all that its a very good, easy drinker thats clean and goes down down smooth."
"A pretty nice lager, when poured it comes out looking real crisp and clear, with a inch head that dissapated after about a minute. Pretty nice tasting, not the best lager ive ever had, but it seems like a nice beer. Had a nice label so i thought id give it a try"
"An excellent and very drinkable brew. I never knew how good this one was until I tried it at one of my new haunts, MacGrady's in Bethlehem, PA. A very crisp and golden-colored brew with some snap in the taste, yet oh so drinkable. Well worth seeking out. Prost!"
"Verdict: this is a nice quafable beer that one can enjoy happily with friends, but one can find equal beers at 1/2 the price, so why pay more for this?"
"Crystal-clear medium golden color with an inch thick snow-white head which fades to a paper-thin layer rather quickly. Carbonation is moderate with fairly good lace. Aroma consists of cooked vegetables, hops, and a little of the ubiquitous skunk. Taste begins with smooth maltiness and a touch of carbonation overlaid with a slight sweetness. Towards the middle of the taste, citrus hops come into play. These then fade and the malt flavors return. This version of Carlsberg is not as good as the local version that I enjoyed in Copenhagen, but still, very good. Not a great beer to be sure, but refreshing and very easy to drink."
"Pours a clear pale golden straw color with a foamy white head that fades into a thin and bubbly lace. Nose is cooked corn and some skunkiness. Very light in body with a crisp mouthfeel. Taste is grain husks and a spicy herbal flavor blended with overcooked hops. Finish is dry and crisp. Another average Euro lager, nothing more. I wont be buying more of these."
"Deepstraw gold with a clingy bonnet. Subdued bouquet of grain hulls and greens. Nice malt to hop balance, but the buds get distracted by some boiled celery on the edges. Light and fluid, nothing to holler about. I may never have met this beer if it wasn't for a 2 hour layover and it's a good thing I took notes 'cause I forgot about it before I even finished."
"Yellow, little head, little lacing. This one's at least potable, less cloying than Beck's, and less stale than Heineken. Thin, with a slight corn adjunct flavour to it. Bleah."
"Pours an ultra-clear very pale golden color with lots of carbonation action. The head was a small white head that shrunk down to a thin layer. The smell of cooked corn, light grain, and faint alcohol notes make up the aromas. First taste at the start is a carb bite that transcends into an earthy grain with light hops and fades into a light peppery hop. This is a lighter bodied beer that finishes crisp, clean, a lightly dry and drinks down plenty easy. Not the best of this style, but Ive learned to appreciate the more subtle beers as well as the bold ones. Not bad! Skaal!"
"My big question is, why bother importing this to Japan. It is a crisp and uncomplicated beer with mild maltiness and mild bitterness. An easy drinking, refreshing, yet boring beer."
"The beer pours the quintessential Lager/Pils color that is a translucent golden yellow, the head modest and bright white, creamy in texture and the lace a fine covering sheet. The prototypical Lager nose, malt, crisp and clean, the start mostly malt the top skeletal. Finish is moderate in carbonation, the hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste and the memories much better than the beer."
"Great color almost crystal clear with a nice white head that disappeared rather quickly. The aroma almost killed it for me. thase stinky hops had me do a double take. I thought I was drinking Heineken. An average taste and I think it would taste better in Europe."
"We have a Carlsberg branch brewery here in Cyprus and i find this beer terrible. I don't know and i don't believe that there is so much different from the Denmark version of this beer. I can't stand this beer either in bottle or can. In can also it's worth mentioning that it misses from it's smell."
"Carlsberg is supposed to be supervising this beer brewed in Toronto.  I think the only way to have it is get the real stuff on tap in Denmark.  Good mix of hops and malt but no beef to it, light straw colored, head goes quick.  Good lawn mower beer."
"Notes: Honestly, for a big pseudo-imported macro beer, this isn't all that bad to suck down. Similar to a Heineken, but better, IMO. Just an okay lager. Around average, and nothing more."
"An ok lager, probably tastes better from Denmark  just another pseudo-import in America."
"I tried this with my drinking buddy and I agree with his conclusions.  It poured with a golden color and thin head.  There was a bitter hoppy aroma and minimal carbonation.  The bitterness carried through into the flavor and the beer was thin on the mouthfeel.  I have to wonder if we were drinking old beer.  I will try again sometime and I may revise my remarks."
"There are better, and there are worse. Not really my cup of tea but the free glass I got for buying this one was pretty cool. No real hops or malt flavor to speak of, virtually nonexistent aftertaste."
"Pours a deep yellow color, with a white head that dies fast. Malts and spicy hops on the nose. Exactly the same in the flavor department, nice peppery spiceness to it, slightly sweet. Nice aftertaste. Good Pilsener!"
"Pale gold with a white head that quickly dissolves to near-nothingness. Didn't smell like much. Taste was unremarkable--a fairly bland pilsener. Not disagreeable, but there's not much to recommend it either. Put it this way: I wouldn't refuse a free one, but I don't think I'll buy it again."
"Clear, straw hue w/ a fairly sticky head that leaves a respectable lace.  The overall aroma is a bit rough.  The mildly skunky mercaptans from light - struck Saaz serve the purpose of providing the uneducated American beer drinker with that ""import"" flavor. Although I've had much more skunked brews, this bottle could've been handled better.  Very grainy, husky grain notes and a touch in sulfur in aroma as well.  The taste, thankfully, isn't skunky, and is comprised of light bready malt notes and grassy hop flavor. Hop bitterness is light, but is sufficient enough to provide ample balance for malt sweetness.  There's nothing outstanding in flavor, however.  Carlsberg finishes dry, clean, and typically grainy.  Other than the slightly skunked hop nose, the lack of malt backbone makes this brew most forgettable."
"Carlsberg:  Yuck, this is the first Euro-lager that I’ve ever had that has a bad American macrolager aftertaste.  Are there adjuncts in this beer?  It even looks like a macrolager:  pale golden with a hint of corn on the nose.  We have got enough bad macro’s here, no need to try one of these."
"Anyway... Carlsberg is the first brewery, which refused of using wild yeasts. They started separate pure yeasts and propagate them. This method succeeded in 1883 and still propagated yeasts are called Saccharomyces carlsbergensis."
"its kind of not even drinkable, strange skunky taste, and smelt a bit like vomit or something, quite horid tasting, don't go there."
"The best description I can offer is Budweiser from Denmark. Bland taste and smell. Yellow color. Not much to it."
"Not spactacular, but still a good, drinkable beer.  I also agree that it's good when you don't want to analyze your drink.  It can be found all over the world, and is consistantly slightly above average.  I have yet to have a bad one, in the US or in Europe.  You know that you are getting a pretty decent brew when you have one.  A great session beer.  I highly recomend it when you want to drink a lot, not spend a lot, and still want something that doesn't taste like old corn."
"One of the biggest and world's most reknown macros. That said, it's a clean tasting and refeshing lager when your in a pinch or in the mood for a beer that doesn't need to be analyzed."
