Aroma very subdued but maybe my sense of smell isn't so great ... I do get a little sweet bread pilsner malt and a few floral noble hop notes. Not much of an odor however. Fortunately the taste is more interesting. Oddly enough I get some fruit notes (banana, pineapple, a bit of vanilla creme perfume) and a green malt juiciness. The whole package is quite sweet but well-carbonated, hops could be more pronounced but I do get the sweet hay flavor and watermelon rind-like green bitterness that I also taste in Sam Adams Boston Lager and other lagers that feature Hallertau hops (apparently grown in New Zealand rather than Germany, where organic versions are currently unavailable ... Could this account for the different fruit notes described earlier?). Finish pretty clean and crisp although there are clearly some residual sugars. Its not an earth-shatteringly great pilsner but I will say that this brew is better on tap. Bottles I have had were more flat, bland, and devoid of the interesting flavors I could detect here.","CalgaryFMC","Beers"

2.74,-13,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"341ml bottle from the Seasonal Sampler mix pack. Pours a bright golden yellow with one finger of foamy white head and drapes of lacing on the lager glass. Lots of carbonation in the body. Smell and taste are creamed corn, cooked veggies, metal, light floral, grains of some sort, water, flavourless malts, empty hop spiciness, a bit salty. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium, almost slick, crisp bite mid-palate, fleeting dryness, no aftertaste. Inoffensive but characterless, and sadly I think that's what the brewer was aiming for. An accessible beer for the masses, this lacks soul, flavour, and good traits in general. Not a terrible lager, just way too uninteresting. I won't purchase again.","cratez","Jun 04, 2010"

Not much going on in the flavor, some graininess and just a touch of light malty sweetness. No hop flavor is noticeable, but there is a twang of bitterness in the finish.

Thin and watery. Not a winner, Mill St....maybe that's why it's in such a small bottle: no one wants to drink a full 12oz. good karma for being organic, i suppose, but who knows what that even means anymore.
