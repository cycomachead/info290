Crisp, refreshing fruity has good malty, fruity and yeasty notes, a grassy hop bitter undertone, maybe nothing special but definitely enjoyable. Smooth texture lacks firmness, and fizz leaves something to be desired. Still a decent pilsner.","Cyberkedi","Feb 19, 2015"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, light pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, biscuit, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, biscuit, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with nice flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice unfiltered pilsner style! All around nice balance of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 05, 2013"

Definitely worth a buy, but for a better price I think I'll go for Sierra Nevada Summerfest more often. I do love the idea of doing a single hop variety and rotating it each year.

The malt is grainy and sweet, and the hops are floral and spicy - both in the aroma and the flavor. The small amount of yeast adds a subtle touch of character as well. It's solidly bitter, but not overdone, leaving it perfectly balanced. The malt appears up front, followed immediately by the hop flavors, and then a rising bitterness as you enter the long, dry finish. It's not a complex beer, nor is it intended to be, but it is full of flavor. if there's any flaw here it's that the head retention could be better. Quite nice. Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 21, 2011"

Great looking pils really rushes the palate and senses with fresh hops, this is a varietal I heard this years was Hallertau. Bright brilliant white foam cap leaves even lacing down the sides of my conical Victory prima pils glass. The golden straw has a sight haze over it like hop resins floating in the delicious summer seasonal. The nose comes and climbs in my nares with a nice full on sharp citrus peel tone lemons/limes more than anything else. Cereal biscuit malts sit beneath that strong citric hop bouquet. Flavor is aggressive with a biting hop edge of citrus fruit amongst a great bready light biscuit pale malt additions. Smooth lagering shows off what most lagers attempt to do. While drinking this I can't stop remembering old Tupper's Hop Pocket Pils. Hop burps pile on after half the glass is completed, mouthfeel is sturdy tight bubbled carbonation with a light bodied slightly oily feeling brew. Nice bone dry finish te way a German pils is supposed to check in with. Overall this is excellent stuff, it's something else to see heads and shoulders above the other 12 ounce offerings in bottle.
