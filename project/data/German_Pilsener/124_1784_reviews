"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear golden yellow with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled white head. Crisp, malty aroma has an overtone of apple, rather like a nice dry cider. Malty flavor is crisp, like a pils ought to be, with more than a hint of apple, just slightly sweet.. Texture has average body and fizz. A refreshing one. Happy Oktoberfest!"

"Nothing extraordinary as far as things go yet definitely drinkable and refreshing. Classic light malt and hop bitterness combination that will certainly satisfy folks looking for this traditional style of lager."

"Overall: A little less hoppy than I expect out of a german pilsner, but that did not ruin this excellent beer for me."
""
"Final thoughts...a very tasty beer, but I would prefer a better balanced malt/hop character. Still an above average example for the style."
"Enjoyable and easy drinking."
""
"Overall Drinkability: Excellent balance for a pilsener; hit's all the right notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Balanced, crisp and refreshing to say the least. This is not my favorite in the style but not bad by any stretch. I would drink this again."

"not a bad beer, pours smooth and golden with lots of bubbles and a nice head that dissipates a bit too quickly. i liked the strong carbonation. nice and dry, hops are noticeable fore sure but not overpowering. a bit thinner then i like, the aroma i found a bit looking. if you want a break from pretty much all types of ales and are looking for a basic, crisp lager. this is a good choice, for some reason it makes me think of a beer i would order at a restaurant. would probably buy again."
"O-This brew is a decent example of a German Pils. As noted above, it packs a bit too much dry malt flavor that mostly overwhelms any suggestion of hops. The taste is so dry that it verges on metallic and grainy, and while that is sort-of what I expect from a German Pils, a little more hop balance or sweetness would go a long way here."
""
"overall this was a great beer, I have had it in bottles and it doesnt compare to the draft version. definitly a ""much better on tap"" beer."
""
""
" The flavor starts somewhat on the light side but builds with mild malt toastiness and subtle spice in the hop flavor as it increases in temperature with some mild yeast flavor and herbal hop accents which have a slight floral edge. The freshness is there and malt is not too mellow and the hops contribute with a nice balance of bitter and sweet. Overall I was not sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and drinkability of this pils."
"Refreshing, but malt is more substantial and hop bitterness less present than in a pilsner. More of a helles, really. There's a bit of diacetyl that surfaces late. The tang was a bit offputting."

"The best thing about this beer is the drinkability. It has a nice mouthfeel and is very refreshing. After you have a sip, it makes you want more."
""
"Overall, this beer was much better than I was expecting. Flavor profile is unique to what I'm used to drinking and was easily drinkable. I will be buying more of this."

"Overall – It is very easy to drink and a fantastic session beer. Simple but good."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy 1/2 inch beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, malt, and some cracker and bread aromas. There is also a slight Play-Doh aroma that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is pretty much the same with some herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing too great in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is clean and smooth -- malty but well-balanced with a light kiss of hops at the finish. A delectable and enjoyable pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""

"Light body and medium carbonation make for a super refreshing drink. The beer is very clean and straightforward. I have never seen this before, but if I do this summer, I will be grabbing a few sixers for those 90 degree Saturdays."
""
""
"A good pilsner. Crisp, tasty and refreshing."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours golden with a dissipating, fluffy white head. Plenty of bubbles stream to the top, indicating plenty of carbonation. Lacing is left on the glass as you drink this and a little lacing is retained at the top well into the consumption of this beer. The aroma is of lightly toasted barley malt and it is also grassy and a little sweet. The taste is bready and slightly sweet, with some hop bite. Obviously some of the hop character and other flavors have likely diminished due to the age of this beer, but I can still taste the distinctive characteristics I would expect from this beer. The mouthfeel is light and this is well carbonated. It's crisp and very drinkable. This is very easy to gulp down. This is a pleasing pilsner that I could enjoy on a summer day. Overall, this is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Drinks more like a helles than a pils. The hop bite is lacking, but it's a solid beer overall. I have to lower the score a bit though due to the fact that this is labeled as a pilsner and not helles."
""
"O - I rarely have this beer. I'm beginning to question why. This one is above average. Very good. Next time I go finishing Im taking a sixer of this."
"Loved the appearance,nice clean blonde color,but rich like honey. Even the smell was clean,no skunk, just bread,honey and a little crisp hop. The taste was the same,I could enjoy this beer with several occassions. No bitter aftertaste,just wanting to repeat the sensation.!..loved this beer."
""
""
""
"O: I like the sweetness of malts, however i do like them more bitter. All in all not bad."

"D- a delicious and extremely drinkable german pils, and a nice change after stuffing myself with oktoberfests for the past 2 months."
"Overall - Paulaner has surprised me with their craftmanship on their brews. This beer ain't the exception. There may be better pilsners out there but Paulaner's Premium Pils is among the best in my humble opinion and it is also by the book on how the style should be."
"Pours beautiful golden, with creamy white up top for the head. Nose has some herbal notes, clean, and a trace of the mis-characterized ""skunk"" oilyness. Palate offers a nice balance of malt sweetness and herbal hop quality. Very refreshing, easy drinking, but yet also sufficiently flavorful to satisfy."
"Notes: Very drinkable. At 4.9% abv this is a real sessioner and a beer even macro drinkers would drink. This is another quality beer from Munich. These breweries seem very confident in their abilities and don't seem pushed to try and be the next thing in beer. Nice."
"Overall: Fine and refreshing, subtle though satisfying."
"This was a very nice pilsener, very balanced and easy to drink."
"Overall a refreshing pils but I still would rather buy a couple other 6packs of pils available to me"
"O: Easy drinking, refreshing, straight forward pilsner. Great on a hot day."
"a rather sweet pils with a proper clear look and smaller head. an older bottle. nose of straw, mild apple pie yeast and pilsner hopping. palate is sweet and the dry cut is not as brisk as would be expected. light body either way but not as dry as the bottle would have one thinking with the extra dry comment. still quite drinkable and simple... palate is more of the nose but with an unexpected linger of malts. won't deny this at its prime... probably much better."
"Overall, an outstanding German pilsner. I am blown away by the quality here, an absolute favorite pilsner for me, and one of the best beers from Germany that I've yet tried. Prost, indeed!"
"O: There is absolutely nothing exciting about this beer. It's very mediocre."
"Big malt presence. Doesn't finish as dry as expected but still good. Nothing outstanding. A good but average pils."
"Bit of a disappointment here, was expecting a less malty beverage."
"RJT"
"Higher carbonation would be good."
"drinkability; another great session beer, easy to drink, light in the stomach."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the low alcohol content makes it sessionable."
"Like the review says, a good pils."
"D: A damn good pils and really just the thing to drink after a day of heavier beers and rich food."
"A refreshing and light pils. Not as crisp as I would like and I would like to see a bit more flavor."
"D: very sessionable, flavors are balanced and price is fair for an import."
"This beer pours a yellow straw color with little head. The smell while weak, does smell a bit offensive. There was initally no taste but finishs dry, and a bit like ginger ale, slightly malty taste. Very light easy to drink taste. Overall not bad, light but has a very dry aftertaste that saves it."
"I generally prefer a little more hop bitterness with my pilsner, but this south german interpretation is excellent for subtle bitterness. While their are many domestic pilsners I would prefer, this one is worth seeking out."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Really nice appearance with a giant full head. Nose is nothing special, but typical of the style. Flavor, the same.... nothing special, but true to the style, and nice, clean, and pure. Overall, this is a pretty solid quaff."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is basic pilsener with a lot of pilsener malt. The flavor is more of the same, with some malt and grain notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very basic."
"Pours a straw yellow colour with nice white head. Some lacing down the glass. Very light smelling, some grassy hops and grains. This is very balanced and pleasant, but the flavours aren't exactly exciting me either. A little bit of sweetness from the malt to go with the mild bitterness. Very clean flavour. Carbonation level is good."
"D-Drinkability is stellar of course. As most pilsners are. All the aspects of this beer come together well enough for it to be sessioned for as long as ones alcohol tolerance can stand. Nothing at all wrong with this beer but nothing that makes it stand out from the crowd either."
"Definitely a refreshing beer. Not overly complex, but then beers of this style typically aren't mind blowers. This is just a solid beer to kick back with."
"Incredibly refreshing and a good taste. Not too much, simple and satisfying."
"When it comes to clean, refreshing lagers the Germans wrote and still own the handbook. What defines their brewing scene is not the scorning of convention, but the perfection of it. While many North American drinkers approach a beer like this with a type of stoic resignation, I can assure you that to have it in its native land is something memorable."
"D: Goes down very easy, nicely blended. This was the perfect beer on a warm day hanging on Catalina Island."
"Overall, it's good, but nothing here really impressed me. I think I'll pass on this one in the future."
"D: I could do away with der wasser"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Easy enough to drink. Would have posted higher if not so bitter."
"Drinkability - Overall this is good if a bit basic. Its quite drinkable and has an authentic flavor."
"I thought this one drank very easy. A good alternative for your BMC crowd. A bit mild, but that is ok. Still very decent and worthy of trying."
"Medium to light body, fair carbonation, and a slick mouthfeel. Drinkability is high."
"M/D: This has a pretty standard characteristic mouthfeel. Not overly carbonated or under-so. Nor is it too thick or thin. Paulaner has this balanced nicely. The finish is somewhat drying, not a big surprise that it would be dry to at least some extent, since it does read ""extra dry on the label. If this was a bit hoppier, I imagine this would be more drinkable, but without a definitive grassy character, I am having a little trouble at getting excited about this one."
"A good, very dry pilsner, as advertised."
"Pours a Crystal Clear pale yellow with a thin bright white head. Smells very slightly of sulfur and malt. Taste is a dry cracker like malt flavor up front, followed by a yeasty middle, and a nice, earthy bitterness in the finish. Very nice bitterness levels that balance out with the malt. Mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation. Super drinkable, this is a great German Pilsner. The sample I had was very fresh, and that no doubt makes a difference."
"I would buy it again."
"Body is good, medium, with nice carbonation. Tastes a little more than it smells. Has some subdued malts and sour hops. Doesn't taste fresh, it has kind of that stale feeling, the flavor just kinda rolls off your tongue and into your throat with a sort of nothingness. It actually has a nice slightly bitter aftertaste with nice burp taste, but on the tongue its pretty unappealing. But overall this is about as un-robust as a pils gets. Could be the age, I will try to re-review when I get a fresher bottle."
"Easily drinkable with a great mix of hoppy bitterness and sizzle from carbonation. It seems that I can't get enough of this beer because of it's satisfying nature. Then again I did just mow the lawn in 100° heat and maybe I was looking for a cool refreshing drink. Either way I'm going to have some more and go to bed early."
"This is a good brew and certainly a step up from the macro attempt at ""real pilsener taste."" Perhaps this would be a good gateway beer before introducing a newbie to, say, Prima."
"Overall a very decent Pilsener. I am partial, a bit, to some of the American versions with a little extra hoppiness, but this is only just a notch below some of my favorites. I sadly overlooked this beer for quite some time..."
"Drinkability is better than just OK. This beer isn't bad nor really good. It middles itself throughout the glass. It's another one of those ""much better than a BMC, especially on a hot day""."
"D: i can slam these not filling some other pilsners you will find"
"Tastes very well balanced, yet the flavors are all pretty light. Biscuit malt with a dash of black pepper and herbal notes. A slight zing to it from the hops gives it a refreshing finish. Overall this beer is great to drink. Would like to see it a smidge more dry in the end, but that's just me."
"A beer that is 1 year 4 months old shouldn't be that bad, but I'm guessing its age is a contributing factor."
"O: Paragon of the style and an awesome ""outdoor"" beer. Gonna see this one again with the summer months coming up."
"D: I had this back to back with Paulaner Original Muncher and found this to be the more interesting of the two. The low ABV and light flavor make this an extremely easy to consume beer."
"The taste is very clean and concise. It's a very focused beer. You can drink this without being distracted by uber-complexity, but this still remains a work of art. It feels very light on the tongue and goes down very nice. High drinkability due to a low abv and such clarity (in regards to flavor and scent) throughout the beer. I really love this pils."
"This is a decent pale lager, and it definitely beats BMC macro lagers if I could put them against each other. In general, beers of this style I find to be a little uninspiring. For the style, this is pretty good."
"Mouthfeel is more rounded than the other german pilsners I tried along side this one."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Smell is sweet and grainy with an equal amount of sharp, floral hop character. Taste is again grainy malt with hop bitterness, but it seems slightly faint and watery. Clean, dry finish. Medium palate with good carbonation."
"This was pretty good, but there are definitely better German Pils out there."
"Good session beer."
"D - This is a real Pilsener, very crisp, clean, and offers true drinkablility, great to go with a hot Louisiana summer (and spring and fall, for that matter) after running or mowing the lawn"
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: If you are looking for an extremely light Pils, pick up a six pack. It would be the perfect beer for playing a round of golf, or to pair with light salads, pretzels, or or other salty bar snacks. It's extremely thirst quenching and a definite quaffer in my book."
"Definitely a quaffer. A minor sticking point is that the carbonation dies towards the end of the glass. I could drink a six pack and not even blink."
"Picked up a 6'er at Cellar's in Woodbury. Poured a straw yellow with a tall white head. The aroma and flavor have a great mix of spicy, fruity hops with dry, bready malts and hard water. This is a classic pilsner through and through. A great example of the style and a must try."
"Poured a slightly cloudy gold with a fizzy white head that dropped quickly. Very faint aroma of mown grass competing with CO2 nose buzz. Taste is smooth and underwhelming with a slight bitter bite at the end. A good ""cold and refreshing"" beer. A Euro macro essentialy. Solid but unremarkable."
"No skunk whatsoever!"
"Been on a bit of a pils kick lately. A quick burst of carbonation upon the pour leads to a two-finger airy white head. Retention is good and a sinewy lacing is left behind. Color is a clear, golden straw. Smells a bit vegetal and floral with some grain and sweets in the back. Tastes grassy and hoppy with that good pils crispness that we all love. This beer has true and exceptional drinkability, and not the kind that confuses drinkability will lack of taste."
"Golden straw colored. The head is thick, frothy, and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Aroma is clean with grass and hay. Lovely mix of flavors in the taste. Floral hops upfront, this gives way to the dominant pale malt sweetness and honey notes. Bits of butter. The hops pick up where they left off in the finish with a mild finish. Good and refreshing."
"d: a solid pils. For me there's Prima Pils and then everything else, so perhaps I am being a tab biased. This is a good one, I just prefer a bit more flavor. Great beer for those transitioning from BMC."
"D-Very good. I sampled this w/two other pils, and this was by far the best of the 3."
"Bottle. Golden colored and poured with a thick fluffy white head that slowly tapers away leaving nice amounts of lacing. Aroma is mostly grassy with a touch of fruity hops. It starts with a hint of bready malts then onto a suprisingly nice gradual bitter, dry hoppiness. Very clean and refreshing. Simple but good."
"Apples are all over this beer. Lots of apples in the aroma, mixed with some orangey-honey tinges, all of which are very present in the taste. Quite attractive in the glass, nice and bright straw-yellow tones topped by a very white, light head that bubbles happily. Some malt, but hops are up front and center. Light body and decent bite. One of the better pilsners I've tried, and quite reasonable in price. Would go quite well with spicy food."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability - Average mouthfeel with good drinkability."
"Very good"
"Pours a golden yellow color with a nice white head that possesses some pretty good lacing and retention. The aroma is grainy malt with a good dose of spicy grassy hops. The taste is malt with a nice snappy bite from the spicy saaz hops in the finish. The taste is crisp and refreshing, everything you expect in a good German Pils. This beer is nothing that is going to knock your socks off, but it is definitely a tasty and highly drinkable Pilsner that is a wonderful session beer in the summer. Recommended."
"Standard mouthfeel, semi-dry finish, really drinkable."
"An Absolute standard of what an old school German Pils is. Pours out a nice pale golden staw color, clear, light bubbles. This Pils has produces and holds a nice two finger head. Aromas of Hallertau, pale straw, grassy, and if you've ever been there-pure Bavarian water. Its hard to describe, but if you've ever experienced that smell, here it is. Flavors are light and crisp pilsner yeast, hops, bready. Mouthfeel is light, abv is low, this is a truely drinkable beer. Absolute pilsner standard"
"A very solid Pilsner with no obvious sign of flaws. Opens with a bright straw color, fair head formation and retention (could be bolder). Aromas of well-attenuated malts and a profound grassy, herbal hop scent. The malt flavor is very bold and rich for a Pils, but low on sweetness makes it very drinkable. Some hop flavor (grassy) comes through at mid-palate and rides into the finish. Light apples come from the grains, and spices from the yeast give enough roundness and variety to keep the beer from becomming dull. Medium, round texture with a creaminess upfront, but thinning late. Hop dryness and bitterness linger in the throat and proves palate cleansing. Certainly one of the better Pilsners out there."
"D = This has pretty middle of the road drinkability. It is refreshing and tastes okay, but as a package there are too many other beers that I would rather have to rank this any better than average."
"One of my absolute favorite beers. I'd love to find this on-tap somewhere close. Excellent drinkability. Always a good choice when I want a pilsner."
"Strong but creamy impression from the carbonation, moderate body for style. Excellent standby on the quest for the perfect Pils."
"D: This is one of those beers that is certainly drinkable, but doesn't knock your socks off. Not bad, not great."
"D - Reasonable drinkability. Overall, it is a well balanced and stylistically accurate pils, but the hop and malt character are both a bit subdued."
"D= very; nothing to put you off, here."
"I would like to try one that is fresher, as this bottle was made about 9 months ago."
"D- great example of pilsener, not my style but still an enjoyable brew"
"Pours a medium golden straw color with a less intense head than expected, just a covering of big bubbles and good lace on the side. A very clean aroma overall, some light graham like aromas, sweet biscuity malts, just a touch of hops, but I imagine age has hurt this department. It starts sweet on the palate, with the light malts coating the mouth, incredibly clean with a very crisp finish. I also taste some faint spicy hops towards the end, probably Hallertaus. An enjoyable pils, but one I would like to try fresher."
"Fluffy white head with nice retention and lacing on top of a golden straw body. Aromas of spicy hops and gently malts along with a hint of apples. Flavor is quite mild. Spicy hops are enjoyable as is the bitterness. Malts provide enough to hold the beer together. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Overall quite enjoyable, but just not enough flavor to keep drinking. Nothing offensive about this one though."
"All in all a great beer that you can enjoy any day. I absolutely loved it. Needs more carbonation though."
"This stlye of beer fits well into my lifestyle with it's character and ability to go with dinner or as a simple refreshing easy drinking lawnmower beer! I will recommend this to a few of my buddies who enjoy this style!"
"I ended up staggering around a bit. I am glad I didn't have yet another (they are so drinkable, you forget that it will do you in). Then again, I did get a free shot of Patron from the barkeep (it pays to tip nicely). Maybe it was the Patron, or maybe not, but the Paulaner smelled very good and went down easy."
"This has a little bit of pepper in the taste. Otherwise it is straight up Pils. Very light, heavy carbonation, and crisp. This is an easy drinking beer and with the low ABV, very sessionable."
"Overall a very tasty and easy drinking pils."
"Drinkability: A nice refreshing pilsner that would be great on a warm day. Low ABV, good taste, light bodied, all make this a definite session beer. I wish I could get a ""true"" pilsner like this from the big 3, fresh, inexpensive, good lager."
"Thierry (13/10/2007)"
"Wow, Paulaner has long been one of my favorite breweries but I'd never tried their pils before. My loss; it's very good."
"Comment: I will stay away from this pilsener in the future."
"D: Exceptional drinkability, this was just what I needed on a hot summer night, it would be a great choice for all occasions, in which you need an easy-drinking, tasty beer."
"Paulaner Premium Pils pours a golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There are some grassy smells in the aroma, but primarily it smells like malt. Malt is pretty strong in this one, the hops come in toward the end. The taste is pretty much dead on for the style. Maybe not my favorite German pils, but definitely pretty good and definitely worth a try."
"Poured a light yellow color with decent head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left decent lacing on my glass. Aroma was lightly floral without any trace of skunk. The body being very light makes it a nice session beer or a nice choice on a hot day. Flavor is a little grassy with a very slight citrus taste. A good refresher."
"Pilsners are generally not rated very highly because they are not terribly complex. But, for easy drinking, they are hard to beat. This is a good, easy drinking, traditional German pils."
"The brewers at Paulaner seem to click with each lager style they churn out. This was my first ""Premium Pils"" Paulaner that I've tried. I've been a fan of this brewer for many years, especially of Salvator and the Hefe-weiss. But whereas Salvator is a great, beefy ""winter-y"" beer, the pils is the perfect compliment to a warm summer day. If you like the Hefe, I'd definitely say you'd wanna give the pils a fair shake. I'd like to try a tap version of this sometime..."
"Notes: This was an incredibly fresh six pack and tasted just as I remember having at my favorite pub in Bitburg, Germany. Good distribution is something to applaud."
"Not a bad pils, with nice flavors of fresh hay, herbal hops, and characteristic German yeast. Recommended for the style, which, while not my favorite, is extremely refreshing at the right time."
" Zum Wohl!!!"
"Drinkability is exceptional. It couldn't be better. Refreshing and uncomplicated - but still a quality beer. Damn near perfect as session material."
"Not my cup of tea for a pilsner. It has too many of the bland flavors I associate with the American macros."
"This is one of the better of the pilsners anywhere. Appearance might not be the best, but the aroma and especially flavor and mouthfeel are superb! This one poured witih a slight head and no lace. A slightly hazy light amber color. Aroma is a very fragrant hop with light malts. Flavors the same. A crisp beer. Excellent body. Just want to drink more. Very balanced. A premier session beer. Bitter sweet finish."
"Methinks the warnings should be replaced with a more positive pitch, and the average Aussie bloke given the chance to experience what pilseners & lagers should really taste like."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a frothy white head - nose of hay , grass , mild hopps , melons , and grains  taste of grain , hay , grassy , malt , and slight bitter hops- body light , crisp , and mildly carbonated  aftertaste of slight sweetness , and low acidity"
"overall, a highly enjoyeable go to pils with very few flaws."
"Brilliant golden color with champagne bubbles, but a not-so-frothy head. The nose is grassy, and quite fragrant with noticable hops. The taste is hugely refreshing, and pleasantly buttery, with a slightly metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel can be characterized in the same way, really smooth until the very end. The finish, however metallic, is very dry and crisp. Drinkable as hell."
"D - Terrible. This is overly salty and metallic. I can barely finish this one....I will though (I don't believe in wasting beer....there are thirsty kids in China and my mom taught me to always clean my plate)."
"Overall, I think this is an OK German Pilsner. It's generally quite average, but it's really quite drinkable and there's no major complaints about it. Nothing skunky here either. I probably won't get it again, but if I didn't have better choices available I'd probably get this somewhat often."
"Mouthfeel was smooth yet somewhat zesty. Body was thin to medium. I enjoyed this one more than I anticipated."
"Pours out a pale golden color with tons of dancing bubbles in the body, thick frothy head, and rings of sheet lacing. Aroma is a mix of clean, pale malts, grassy and hay-like hops, and a slight sulfur hit. Flavor is malty and bready with some of those earthy hops thrown in the mix. Finishes extremely dry. The hop bitterness seems to fall flat in the end and doesn't contribute a bright punch like I'd hoped. Mouthfeel is light, however, there needs to be more carbonation in this one. Although this isn't jaw-dropping, it's incredibly drinkable, like most half-decent lagers."
"This beer had a nice thick head. The smell was a little citrusy. The taste was not very hoppy, but smooth and balanced. It was easy to drink and highly sessionable. It had a nice crispness. If I wanted to just chill with my friends and have a great beer that I didn't have to think about too much, I would consider this beer."
"Poured this into a pilsner glass. Small head, though nice carbonation, pale yellow color. Head has a pleasant aroma to it. Tastes pretty ordinary to me. Nothing stands out in any way. Pretty standard, though not bad. It just doesn't do anything for me. Very boring, and overpriced."
"Drinkability--This is a good pilsner--I could easily have a quite a few of these."
"Bottle. Pours a pale yellow colour with a nice large longlasting head. Has a malty grassy, slightly grainy aroma. The flavor is sweet malty with grassy hints. Also some grainy hints. Medium mouthfeel with a long bitter aftertaste. An okay German pilsener."
"Overall: Run of the mill stuff, but pretty good nonetheless."
"D- all pilsners are very drinkable and this is one is no exception, a nice beer that you could drink quite a few of"
"Overall, this is an excellent pils and a great example of the style. I haven't had this good of a pils since I was in Austria early this year."
"Pours a clear golden with a frothy white head. Aroma of floral hops and malt. Thin, soft mouthfeel. This pils is crips and fulfilling. Bready, sweet malt flavor with a nice assertive bitterness compliments of the Hallertauer hops. The finish is dry. Classic German pils. If you're going to stock your fridge with a pilsner beer, this might as well be the one."
"Paulaner Premium Pils, although it isn't what I'd call a lackluster version, isn't up to snuff compared to some of the other classic German pilseners. It's still drinkable though and is crisp and refreshing enough to warrant a purchase for those with an affinity for the style."
"D - It is a pretty good German Pilsner. Although I like some other Paulaner products much better."
"cavat- I have discribed this beer as missing something yet still have it rated well. How does this work? German Pilser is my favorite style of beer so while I may find it lacking compared to the spaten, it was still one of the better offerings out there."
"A good German pils, with obvious flaws. A great session beer, even if it's not all that exciting."
"Overall: Really wish the taste lived up to the smell. Love the aroma, but not too enamored by the flavor."
"Traditional Paulaner aroma with a hint of toasted malts comes from a thin, straw brew. It isnt tasteless, but doesnt really have a distinct flavor other than a sharp tinge when you first swallow. This is a crisp, light lager that is what Budweiser tries to mimic. That being said, it makes me think of cheap, tasteless brew that leaves one wanting. Ok beer, not worth the import price."
"Overall, this is up there with the best pils I've had. It's less rich than Spaten, Konig or Pils Urquell. I find it very clean and dry on the finish. Good brew!!"
"This a pale, clear, golden color with a thin, bright white head. The aroma is beautiful, a soft cloud of muted hop and sweet grain, unadulterated by any sulfer notes. The main word to describe this beer is SOFT. Everything is so subtle and balanced. The flavor is light, sweet, a little bready with touches of alcohol, metal, and sulfer, which all have their place and are balanced in their own way. Totally clean aftertaste, though the finish is unabrupt. Not perfect, but a pretty dreamy pilsner."
"Crisp, clear and golden with a fluffy white head about 3 fingers that disappeared fast. Strong grain, bread-like aroma. Lost of malt flavors but not sweet or syrupy, defiantly enough hop to balance things out, but that is about all the hops do, as they do not stand out tremendously, aside from providing a dry ending. Very palatable, but not at all challenging. A good example of a pills but not the Plutonic form."
"Overall: I really liked this this fine german pilsner. All that's missing is a little more saaz aroma."
"Final Thought: Pils is my prefered style but this one falls short in my opinion. It is a decent brew but aside from it's appearance, it is marginally better than average. Paulaner did bad."
"Pours a nice golden color with a thin white head. The aroma is clean but sweet with little hops .It has a very refreshing flavor. A decent malty backbone with a sweet grassy finish and a little bitterness from the hops. I wish American pilseners were this good."
"Drinkability: As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this would make a good intro into foreign pils varieties as opposed to the american macro ""pils""."
"Light brassy pils-yellow, clean, with a light, fluffy white head. Nose is honey-covered biscuits, light fruit, and spicy, herbal, vegetal hops. Quite nice really. Sweetish malt flavor backbone--maltier than most pils. Very light cardboard in the middle. Herbal hop surge provides ample bitterness. Finish is bready with a yeasty bitterness. Medium-bodied with a dry, crisp finish. Refreshing and appetizing. One of the better German pilseners I've had so far. Recommended"
"Poured a rich golden color with a pillowy white head with decent retention into a traditional pilsener flute. Bready pilsener and pale malt aroma with spicy Hallertau hops near the end. Slight vegetal aroma, too. Clean tasting with some malty, husky sweetness at the beginning and an even transition to the light hoppy, dry finish. Nothing that's reinventing the wheel, just a good pilsener. Very drinkable due to its dry finish."
"This is another good European pilsener to check out."
"Comments - It puts Heine to shame, that's for sure. Good stuff. Some domestically (United States) produced beers might top it due to being fresher. I definitely recommend this one."
"Taste is very crisp and clean with a slight hop bite. Light and airy. The label reads that this beer is ""extra dry"" and its true. Dry finish. Very drinkable and a perfect transition beer for individuals that are faithful to the macro beer scene."
"Very smooth on the tongue and down the throat. Starts dry, gives a sweet tingle at the back. Extraordinarily light-bodied, without being simple or lacking in flavor. Just enough taste on the palate to make each sip beckon the next. Very nice lager, indeed. I'm not the biggest fan of this style, but it's an excellent example, and I can see it come in especially handy when thirst-quenchin' is the order of the day."
"Light and crisp, not the most exciting or memorable pils, but it's a good session beer on a hot day. Subtle but not subdued."
"The bight of carbonation ushers in the hops to the forefront, combining to a crescendo of dry toasted malt with a pinch of hops, for a most pleasant and refreshing brew."

"While the Munich Lager was malty and had a decent hop presence, this beer seems a bit superior in both departments. This could be considered the ""premium"" of the two. I know they are technically different styles, (this one a German pils and the other a Münchner Helles) the similarities are there. This a nicely balanced pils that is high in drinkability."
"The beer pours a light golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It smells of pale and wheat malts. It's light with a bit of sweetness. The taste is decent. It is smooth with a wheat zing to it. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks very well. This is one of the better pils I've had."
"Appearance: Crystal clear golden straw color with a nice bubbly white head lies nice and thick with great retention, lacing forms nice rings with each sip. Aroma: Light grassy with a slight hint of lemon tone to it, great herbal European hop aroma very nice German pils. Taste: More of the lemongrass sweetness finishes dry with a nice bitterness date says 12-03 but this tastes very fresh to me with no off flavors at all very clean finish excellent refreshing pils. Mouthfeel: Strong carbonatin lighter bodied lager excellent summer sipper nothing spectacular but solid to the style. Drinkability: Once again awesome refreshing, crisp, and somewhat flavorful compared the ""true pilsner"" by Miller."
"Not bad, just not good."
"Yellow crystal look. Lots of carbonation in the glass. Lasting white head with good lacing. Quite a good looking beer. Not much smell at all to be detected. Taste is dominated by crisp clean malt with a touch of roasty flavor as well. Also the finish leaves lemon notes on the tongue as well. Solid smooth medium mouth."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this pilsner, which is not a style that I usually enjoy. The bottle says ""Extra Dry," which I will agree with to a point. The finish definitely has a dry quality to it, but the sweetness that emerges in the aftertaste keeps this beer from being too dry."
"Pours with a pillowy huge snow white head that settles into a clear golden-yellow hued glass of beer. The nose offers notes of a clean sweet maltiness followed by a nice showing of floral and grassy hoppiness that begs for a swallow. The taste is nicely bitter hops ahead of light-bodied clean-tasting malt base that finishes pleasantly behind the initial bitterness. A very tasty and albeit very drinkable German Pils...right up there with the best of 'em (Bitburger, Jever, ect.). The lack of ""heaviness"" makes this a superb hot weather or session drink."
"Big, white, foamy head. Clear, yellow-gold beer. Clean nose: some nuts, corn, sweetish... nice. Fresh front: a little fruity. Some maltiness in the middle. Dry finish: corn, hoppy-bitter tang... nice again. Just an excellent, crisp, fresh pils. Delicious."
"I'll preface this by saying that I'm not too big on pilseners. So, it comes as no surprise that I found nothing exciting about this beer. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything I'd go back for"
"Given how hot its been lately I had to go with a five for drinkability because its so damn crisp and refreshing."
"Drinkability/notes: An interesting Pilsener, its strong hop character distinguishes it from many others that I have tried."
"Translucent golden hue, a fingers worth of brilliant white head, healthy retention, unorganized specks of lace. Herbal, grassy nose with fragile malt influence interwoven, slightly sweet; it is a fair bouquet, not as inviting as I would have liked. Regardless I took a sip no disappointment here. The hops persuasion is excellent, mild bitterness with pleasant herbalness, a hint of spice, and a note of grass minuscule maltiness trails. The finish is crisp and refreshing rather long with a spicy hops reminder that lingers on the back of the tongue. Ideal carbonation. Medium body. This is a high-quality Pils recommended."
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for the bottle!"
"Typical pilsner yellowish-gold color. Develops a nice off-white foam head that stays around for a couple of minutes. Fresh hoppy smell mixed with a little toasty malt. Pleasant and just a bit more pronounced than your traditional ""pilsner-style"" beer. Taste delivers with fruity hops, slightly sweet malt w/ maybe a bit of peat. Feels crisp and clean, with an excellent blend of bitter and sweet in the finish. Pilsner isn't my favorite style, but I could definitely enjoy one or two of these now and again. I'll be sure to have a few on hand throughout the hot summer months. Plus, I like that this beer comes in a brown bottle rather than green - no skunky overtones."
"It poured a pale golden yellow in color and light to medium body. Not a lot of foam and little lace of the glass. The aroma was had nothing outstanding, but the taste was dry and well-balanced, with hop and malt character. This would be a nice summer quincher!"
"One of the two best Pils I can remember drinking, the other Holsten Pils. The beer poured a very clear gold with a white head. While receding , the head clung to the glass leaving nice looking lace work. The smell was a nice balance between the sweet malts and spicy hops. It felt very nice in the mouth; not too heavy, but not on the light side either. A slight, and I say again, slight bitter aftertaste was present. Final outcome, this is/was a great tasting pilsner. Its very drinkable and Im highly looking forward to the next one!"
"Next to Pilsner Urquell, this is my favorite non ale beer, as it epitomizes the mastery of the brewers art. The beer pours a liquid gold with a modest head and the color bright white, as it evaporates the laces forms a satin curtain to drape the glass. Nose is malt, citrus crisp and clean, sweet as is the malt start with a top skinny in feel. The finish has medium acidity with the hops perky in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, and one well worth the try"
"Pours a golden-yellow color, average fizzy foamy white head, light grainy and flowery aroma. Grainy and mild sweetness turns to a hoppy and bitter dryness in the finish. Light bodied with a fizzy watery mouthfeel, very clean and crisp, this is a very good pils."
"Pours a clear pale straw color with a thin white head. Aroma is dominated by sweet malts and fresh baked bread with some floral notes. It is quite crisp and refreshing in the mouth with a nice flavor mix of sweet malts and bitter hops. One of the top Pilsners on the market."
"Pours a glowing straw gold body topped by a frothy bright white head that holds quite well. It eventually receeds but keeps a thin surface covering and leaves some very nice lace. The nose is fragrant with a bright, fresh, sweet malt atop a light grassy, floral and mildly spicy hop aroma. The body is medium with a very fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor is more hoppy than the aroma indicates with a firm bitterness and floral/grassy hop flavor. Well balanced. It finishes dry, crisp and clean with just some minor residual sweet malt and lingering bitterness. Very refreshing! A nice, easy finish. Overall, it seems to fall somewhere between a Bohemian and German Pils. Very well done and exceptionally drinkable."
"Hot summer day guzzlin truly make this a ""Crown Pils of Europe."" Similar to the czechs' Pilsner Urquell. Elegant in both presentation and flavor, Premium Pils' big, dry, hoppy head takes from 7 to 10 minutes to pour properly. The results are bright color, a light, crisp taste and the traditional dry, hoppy Pils finish. Naturally dry, hoppy finish."
"Great hot weather brew"
"Had this on tap.  Beatiful golden color with carbonation evident.  Nice maltiness on the nose as well as a flowery hop boquet.  Very nice taste.  Has a bit of a bite, but is very easy to drink.  Great pils maltiness.  Could drink a lot of these."
"Notes: Tasty little pils here, well place flavours and relatively delicate other than the husk character. A clean and fresh example to the euro pilsner style and great for someone that wants to jump ship from the big macro lager freighter."
