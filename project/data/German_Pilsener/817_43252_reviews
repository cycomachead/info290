"Overall : Average pilsener that is slightly too watery and lacking in flavors."
""
""
""
""
"It is refreshing, and almost feels hydrating."
"16.9 oz can from Whole Foods. Pale golden yellow with a foamy white head. Taste of sweet cereal grains and freshly baked white bread up front. Floral hoppiness along with a grassy backbone takes over. The carbonation is lively. The body is light with a dry finish. The flavor is well balanced, creamy yet crisp and clean. An exemplary pilsener."

"Crisp, light clean pils. I keep these for a warm day and my BMC pals. Never disappoints."

"Had couple of them fresh from the tab at the Klosterhof in Linz. I loved every sip of it and was especially excited about its gently but distinct hoppy nose, bitter balancing finish and drinkability. A lager at its best"

"Tall can pictured here poured into the available pint glass at a Calgary pub. A bright golden amber color with a decent dose of creamy white head, I get a pleasing, assertive but not aggressive aroma of fresh bread, grain husks, some fruity esters that almost grade into orange-like citrus, apple, and faint sulfur that recalls coconut flakes along with noble hop grassy and spice notes (dare I say cinnamon). Palate largely mirrors this, if a little more rough around the edges, some grain husk and darker than usual malts that almost enter nutty territory for a moment, a yogurt-like lactic tartness, slight vinous character, and a moderate degree of carbonation for the style. Nice body that has a bit more substance than the average macro-brewed pilsener. Finishes crisp but also rather bready. Nice hop aroma and flavor throughout. Quite a lot is going on here and this is one of my favorite continental pilseners, relatively easy to track down and with an almost ale-like fruitiness that makes it stand out from the pack."

"It's crisp and creamy with a high carbonation and, interestingly, a bit too much to the medium body. It's clean up front, something building lightly but just."

"Stiegl's Pilsner is a classic, in my opinion. One that's easy to find and, when fresh, amazingly satisfying. It's all things a good pils should be; precise, clean, refreshing, dry, hoppy, and immensely drinkable. It's a shame this beer doesn't get the love it deserves. Either way, I recommend buying some."

"Great crackery pilsner malt character, nice bittering hops, slightly earthy, but there's a touch of citrus that is very welcome. Crisp and refreshing, this is a great example of the style. Floral hops are subtle, but noted. Very well constructed and clean."

"Poured a gorgeous golden color with a two finger white head that stuck around for almost the entire glass and a wonderful amount of bubbles. An excellent looking pilsner. Scents of crisp lager yeast, grainy malt and flowery hops. A very crisp and clean aroma, a nice classic pilsner scent. Flavor begins with a crisp combination of herbal and floral Noble hops and some nice grainy malt. Moves into more herbal and floral flavors, some more dry grainy flavors and a slight hint of sweet pilsner malt. Finishes dry with a nice hit of floral and herbal Noble hop flavors. Aftertaste is floral and herbal Noble hops. A very nice, simple, one-note, clean flavor profile, just like a pilsner should be. It is refreshing and pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a semi-drying feel. A good, crisp, clean and refreshing mouthfeel. Very true to style. Overall this is an excellent German Pilsner. It is crisp and clean in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel, as the style should be. It isn't complex at all, but for this style that is a good thing, and for a nice refreshing lager it is amazingly well done."

"Overall - Note a bad pilsner, but I don't see how this is vastly better or worse than most. Although in retrospect this was better than I had remembered it."
""
""
""
"O: all about the bottle label? i don't know why you'd want to drink this otherwise.... tastes like Heineken or any other similar pale Euro lager"
""
""

"Mr average in all aspects."

"Overall: Basic beer. Accessible. Clean and well-made but unexciting."

"Admittedly, I'm not the biggest pils fan, but this was a solid beer that is an above average representation of the style. I did drink it straight out of the bottle, but it was a very cool commemorative 2013 holiday bottle. As soon as it was opened, a half inch of large bubbled foam appeared on top of the beer. The smell was actually quite pleasant; strong piney-hop smell. The taste of this beer is pretty standard for a pils; if anything it is a bit on the weak side, but I do appreciate that it is less harsh in the mouth than many other brews in the style. Overall, I would say that as far as pils go, this is a solid choice and very drinkable, but there are many superior Austrian brews to choose from."
"O- For me, this Pils isn't something that stands out from the pack but it is a fine example of the style that deserves a solid recommendation. I would definitely like to give Stiegl another taste in the future!"
""
"O: Not too flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s definitely not one of the better beers I’ve had in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"I always look forward to good quality pilsners on tap, and this one definitely did the trick for me recently. It provides everything I expect a German-style pilsner to carry without taking too many risks. I'd imagine this is dramatically inferior in the bottle, but at least this is easy to find on tap if I'm looking for a good session beer that is tasty, as well as taking a break from offerings that usually plummet my ass to the ground."

"Overall Drinkability: One of the better commercial European pilseners."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice clean character has just a touch of sweetness which compliments the pils malt and a hint of hops. There are no off flavors and everything is balance making this very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Light yellow and crystal clear with a small head. It looks like there’s a lot of carbonation being released. No lacing at all and only a very slight retention of the head. The aroma is of crackery malt and a little orange peel. Light, crisp and refreshing as I drink. Very slight bitterness and slight pungent hop characteristic to it as well. The mouthfeel is pretty decent with good carbonation. Overall, this is an enjoyable pilsner but nothing about it stands out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I never considered a beer of this style to be one for a long session but this would have fit that bill perfectly. The carbonation was just right and there was just enough of a floral and earthy feel to this to keep it light while never feeling watered-down. This was a great example of the style and maybe the best beer that I've had out of a green bottle in quite a long time."
"Overally, this is a solid German Pilsener that I would recommend others trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Grassy and sort of a clingy mouthfeel; I thought the nose was a little catty, but nothing that would put me off it. So much better than the Grolsch-Heineken business that too often overshadows this stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pilsner worth seeking out and having in your fridge. Buy some today!!"
""
"O- It's a nice representation of the style"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, straw-yellow with a white, foamy head and lots of sticky lacing . Smells of cereal grain, spicy hops and fresh-cut, wild flowers. Tastes of clean and sweet, malty flavors followed by a subtle, but unmistakable dose of Saaz hop bittering. Mouthfeel was surprisingly full-bodied and low carbonation with a nice buttery feel after swallowing. Long bitter-sweet aftertaste. Sweet, malty flavours are even more pronounced after it warms up a little. Overall, one of the best German-style Pilsners I've ever had."

"Overall it is... alright. The initial smell and taste were bitter, but after one drink it got better. The appearance, smell and taste were all ultimately average, with nothing really special to note. Really it was not bad, and not really great - just beer. I couldn't help think of Hugo Stiglitz every time I saw the name of the beer, which made for a fun time :-)"
"Overall this beer is not outstanding in any way but it isn't bad either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: You can't do much better for a European Pils. Don't overlook this one - Right up there with Budvar and Pilsner Urquell"
""
""
"The taste is evergreen-ish, minty with notes of honey sickle and the ubiqutuous cooked vegetables, denouncing the probability of corn or just slack brewing procedures. Nonetheless, regardless of what central European lager category it belongs to, it's still a pretty unremarkable beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, classic and well executed. Not much here, it's good, but simple, leaning on the sweet side, but not cloying."
""
""
""
"Now I need to go to Austria and drink a real fresh one."
""
"Much more smooth and palatable than some in this style. All of the typical pilsner character, without too much to distinguish it. Good, crisp and dry, with a nice initial fruit character. Sessionable and quite refreshing."
""
"O: Beer looks great. And it has some complexity. It just falls short of pilsner greatness. Miss that zingy hop edge that pilsners bring, I guess."
""
"This is a decent pilsner, though it's heavy on the malts, which gives a sweeter tone to it. Fairly one dimensional, but it's consistent. A nice enough beer that goes beyond the typical yellow fizzy stage. Kind of a small bottle though, which doesn't make too much sense for such a low abv beer, imo."
"M - Light body. Moderate carbonation."
"Overall would definitely go back to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Unspectacular, but also unoffensive for the most part. I'm not overly familiar with German Pilseners, but to me this seems like a decent, drinkable representation of the style. It may be a patio beer at best, but there's certainly worse ones out there than this."
""
""
""
"O -- Another highly drinkable, enjoyable beer from Stiegl. The brewery is making some great light lagers that prove the style isn't inherently bland."
"Overall: This is a meh beer. The malty/apple-juicey taste is strange in a lager and the mouth feel, while extremely drinkable, isn’t very compatible with the heavier feeling that the lager leaves in the stomach."
"This brand is not very common in the U.S. but a clear example of a good pils."
"Overall: Nothing too complex but a nice and light pilsner that I could have several glasses of. An excellent summer beer. Happy to have found this on draft."
"This beer tastes very much like the other pilsners I've had from central European countries. It's light, yet refreshing, and still has that ever so mild skunkiness that I come to expect with these particular beers. Not a favourite but still definitely drinkable - I must have enjoyed it enough, since I had 3."
"The finish ends up dry enough, however, with just a little bit of lingering bitterness. Body is medium light, carbonation is moderate enough but still crisp; draft gives this an appealing mouthfeel that’s both smooth and clean. A highly drinkable Pils but for me, not a standout."
""
"O: This was a decent pilsner – a little skunky – but interesting flavors and aromas."
""
"Not a bad Pils when it comes down to it. I would drink this over many BMCs and other lighter imports."
""
"Overall not bad, I had low expectations with a screw top and green bottle, which seemed to affect it a bit with a slight oxidation and hint of skunk, but not completely sure on that. As it warms and the more I drink it the more a slight bitter skunky flavor comes through that gives it a bit more of a macro lager flavor, but still worlds better than most macro lagers. The malts and decoction-like layers were pretty nice, hops could have been a bit more pronounced overall too. Drinkable, crisp, and fairly tasty. I could pound quite a few of these back to back no problem."
""
""
"O-- Too carbonated to my palate but a good beer. Got a fresh bottle so none of the skunky notes that others seem to get. A little metallic in places but nothing too bad. A well done mass produced beer."
""
""
"Austrian pilsner...I think I like it!"
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Didn't like this beer much. Glad I bought a single. This beer runs about $10.00 a six-pack; which I find to be a rip-off. Just doesn't cut it in my opinion. That is all."
""
"D: i hope this brew is better out of the bottle cause i really cant move past the metallic flavor here. everything else seems solid, appearance, smell, mouth, palate is my only real complaint. otherwise crushable."
"I found a 500ml can of Stiegl during a trip to Canada. The beer pours a clear pale/golden yellow copper with a fair size foamy white head. The smell had malt, hops, slight citrus. The taste starts somewhat dry and then finishes with a slight bitter hop taste. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with decent carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer that is definitely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinking this brings back great memories from traveling to and through Salzburg and Austria. Great looking and smelling, the taste was less than I remember at the source."
"Overall, this is a decent Pilsner, crisp and easy to drink; as well as cheap and commonly available. Worth a try if your picking out random tall cans."
"Overall – Better than average for sure. With so many run of the mill euro beers available in my area this one at least has a taste different enough to set it apart from the rest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While not my favorite style, this one goes down easy, and is a nice pleasant one. This would be a great beer for a hot day, it's light, but has enough flavor to keep it from being boring. Not hard to see why this is a popular style."
""
" Me like!"
"O - This is a nice pilsener. A nice value, too. Worth a try."
""
"Final Grade: 3.53, a B grade."
"Pours a clear gold color with a 1/2 inch white head that fades to an oily film. Small streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, honey, and some white grape juice aromas. Taste is of sweet malt, honey, white grape juice, and some floral hops on the finish. A mild bitterness on the palate quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. A bit too much carbonation in my opinion. Overall, this is a good beer that is very easy to drink."
"O- A decent easy drinking beer. There are some better pilsners out there, but this is a decent option."
"Overall: A solid presentation for the style. Easy to drink and worthy the purchase if you're looking for something crisp, clean and easy to drink. Not sure if I would distinguish it from other beers in the style."
"Pours a clean pale yellow with a white head. In the aroma, a sweeter malt, small pils hops, and quite a basic lager. In the taste, sweet malt in a quite standard European lager. A smooth and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness in the aftertaste. For a standard lager, a step above a macro, but eh! nonetheless."
"O: Wasn't pleased with the beer at all."
"Pours a golden color, very clear, with a rocky white head. Minimal lacing, head dissipates in a few minutes. The nose is very bready, toast and grain. Flavor has a fesh grain character, slight bitterness from hops, but not much. Quaffable summer brew, not my favorit style, but a good representation here."
"That's a unique pilsner, but not necessarily one worth having again. Overly sweet, not enough else going on."
"D: This is probable is just what a Pils should be, but not quite like the other Pils I've had... ABV is good and over all not a bad beer... Worth looking for because it is from the mother land."
"O - not my style but I found it very drinkable"
"This one looked decent after the pour -- clear, yellow/gold colour with a thin layer of fine, bright white bubbles on top. Good head retention, lasting most of the way through the glass, with some sticky and spotty lacing to start. Floral aroma with some sulfury hops, sweetish dry malt notes. Bitterness was medium to low with more cereal and dry malt flavour, floral hops, and a quick finish that had a hint of fruit. The body had some heft, supported by moderate carbonation and an off-dry finish making for an enjoyable, drinkable texture. Not bad overall. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the sulfury character I got from the aroma so it's not a beer I'd go back to again."
"From the pint can stamped 06721. Sampled on July 29, 2011. The aroma is totally European with a fine balance of vibrant German malts and baked bread but also something off kilter like glue. Still, it was not terrible, just different. The body is creamy and smooth. The taste is also smooth and malty sweet. I thought this was a fairly average to good pilsener."
"Overall a really great unique pilsener. Excellent summertime brew and something I will seek out again."
"A good, smooth pils. Nice start and finish. Medium mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer. Would definitely order another."
"Apparently, I had some of this during my German trip back in 2000, so I figured I'd give it another go to get some idea of what I had way back when. It pours a clear lemony straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises musty wheat, flowers, light honey, and a touch of green apple skin. The taste holds notes of light grass, flowers, wheat, light banana, and green apple flesh. I'm actually a little surprised at the fruitiness here. It's not a negative, but I'm not entirely convinced it's a positive, either. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a nice pils, worthy of a trip down a decade-long Memory Lane."
"O It's an alright beer. I'm sure I can down a few of these on a hot day with no problem. Not bad but not great."
"Overall maybe my favorite pils. I'm gunna need to out it up against Spaten but they are close for my favorite."
"O - Not bad...very German. I typically prefer the more floral and soft pils I can find stateside, but this is a nice change of pace. Worth experiencing, but nothing that's going to send you running for more."
"o) A nice example of the style; the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. 500mL bottles are a good format."
"O-Okay."
"A solid pilsner with great balance and terrific freshness and cleanliness. Very refreshing and enjoyable."
"O: Ok"
"Fresh smell of citrus. Good beer for a warm day and when you are thirsty."
"O - Miles below the Goldbrau. Should've been better than this but severely lacking in character for a pilsner."
"I could drink this over and over, even over a few of the Czech classics. But this is still not quite up to snuff when compared to the masterful brews from the neighbors to the north."
"Taste - clean, crisp malt with noticeable noble hops presence and just a touch of bitterness on the end."
"M: Smooth, very drinkable and quite light."
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Clear pale gold with a sticky, lasting head that leaves scattered lacing. Grassy, spicy aroma, quite hoppy with a clean lager yeast character behind the hops. Pils malt is faintly noticeable. Noble hops are strong on the palate, lending a big kick of spicy, herbal and grassy flavors. The malt base is light and dry, while the finish is strongly bitter and lingering, somewhat mineral. This is in the North German school, very dry and bitter. A great pils, Stiegl continues to impress me."
"M: Highly attenuated yet smooth, not overly crisp. Quite drinkable."
"16 oz can into a snifter...purchased as a 4 pack. Nice golden color with a big fluffy head. Body carbonation is a little light, but that's really my only complaint. Appearance is closer to a Vienna style lager in many ways than a pilsener. Good funkiness in the aroma and the aroma is overall very clean, nothing objectionable at all. Drinks very easy too, it's clean on the tongue and very refreshing. Mouthfeel is also good, it's quite crisp. Overall, I recommend this beer--it proves once again that many of the basic brews of Europe are made with more care than the American adjuncts. (most--note that there is still a lot of crap from the Continent too)."
"A drinkable yet very average German Pilsner. Thishad a little hint of lemon in it which made this surprisingly better to me. Other than that, not much is special with it. It's yellow and crisp, Grassy to an extent but not 100%. Could be much worse. I would pick this up over most Pilsners out there."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sesionable."
"Clear, pale yellow color, lively carbonation. Thick, fluffy white head. Good head retention. Grainy malt aroma with some fruit notes and floral noble hops. Bready malt flavor, moderately sweet with some caramel. Floral and fruity hops. Totally smooth mouthfeel, perhaps could have been a bit crisper/more carbonated. Overall a great, drinkable pilsener."
"If you are looking for a decent, simple Pils with no fruity tones and just simplicity linked to style, this is your beer of choice. A summer beer at its simplest."
"Very easy drinking and satisfying in a no nonsense, light beer kind of way."
"D: decent pilsner, could have a 6 pack with ease. fine gateway beer for timid newbies. There are better Pilsners from Czech Rep. and many in the USA. Not a must try."
"Maybe it's because it's been a while, but i forgot how good and drinkable german-style pilseners are. Because it's so ubiquitous, I feel like pilsener is often overlooked, even frowned upon by serious beer drinkers. I believe there's a reason this style became so popular, and this is a great example of a top notch pils."
"A good pils with no flaws for style."
"D: very good. I haven't had too many pilseners but am enjoying the various aspects of this. It is a full and flavorful beer without being very ""heavy"". Could enjoy quite a few over the course of a warm afternoon, or just as a starter to an evening, like I am doing right now."
"Pretty easy to drink. Not super complex, but is what a German Pils should be. The skunk is a bit of a turn off, but not overdone. Worth trying."
"Had this on tap at Twisted Kilt in Toronto. Poured into a branded pilsner glass. Pours a straw-yellow colour with a finger of white head. Head dissipates slowly, leaving some small lacing down the glass. Smells of grassy hops and grains. Mild aroma, but pleasant. Mild bitterness in the flavour. Nice medium bodied carbonation. A very decent pilsner."
"Pours a clear straw color with a pretty good white head with plenty of staying power. Nose is fairly aromatic with some good Noble hop notes as well as some very light grain. Taste is slightly bitter, earthy, and spicy with some raw grain underneath. Good, brisk carbonation on a light body. Drinks fairly well overall."
"With nothing more useful to say, if you need the perfect summer afternoon beer, this is it."
"Fairly drinkable, as long as it stays cold. Warmth is not doing this beer any favors."
"Not your typical pils. Easy-drinking and hoppy-dry with a good body, aided by the malt and corn. One of my favored go-to pilsners ."
"I thought that this was a pretty tasty Pils."
"Glad to have tried it, its a nice beer, but pretty average."
"Taste is really malty creamy and smooth. It reminds me of budvar. It's got a mellow full mouthfeel. Overall a super tasty beer. Worth trying!"
"Pale lagers, pilsners or otherwise, will not reinvent you the wheel. If you're expecting the moon for your nose and the stars for your mouth, you're drinking the wrong kind of beer. To me, these lagers come down to one question: is it clean, unadulterated, palatable and pleasurable? If 'yes' then I'm happy with it - which means I'm sure as hell happy with this."
"Drinkability is excellent. I could drink this all day. This was a surprisingly tasty beer."
"Nose is full of hay and light grain along with some lemony hops. Flavor follows and has a decent body as predicted by the nose. Full and a bit grainy with a touch of musk, yet not overly coarse or bready. Clean and smooth on the feel yet without offering too much character either, yet well balanced for what is there. This alllows for an easy drink as the feel is fuller than the pour might suggest and it never becomes sweet in nature. An easy drinking pils with a good balance of flavor and texture."
"O: Great, different and refershing clean lager."
"Note: Nothing exceptional but not really bad either, just an OK beer. Would probably be a good beer if you were looking for something cold and refreshing is summer."
"Kind of skunky, sulfury smell and taste that dominates... somewhat like a Grolsch. Other than that, not too exciting - you have your typical grainy taste here and a good hoppy taste in the end. Pretty good beer."
"This is a balanced beer. A little sweet here, a little off there, but overall not bad."
"D- I'm almost done drinking this pint of Stiegl already so it is a very drinkable beer! I'd probably find myself getting happy with this brew rather quickly. The malty sweetness hides the alcohol really well and the flavor is rich. I think anyone getting into Pilsners would like this as an entry into the style....not the most accurate version but it's good!"
"D - easy drinking bier."
"A mild crispness as it finishes, fairly refreshing."
"A tasty little pilsner, quite enjoyable to drink. Could have been a bit more robust, but still a very drinkable brew."
"D: My favorite offering from Stiegl. A really drinkable beer that goes down easy and with no hassle."
"Pours a nice pale gold colour with a frothy head, as expected for the style. Can smell the hops a little bit but not getting much else from this one really. Straightforward refreshing taste, true to the style, nice amount of hops. Pretty crisp and refreshing and overall good, but nothing outstanding."
"Overall, a solid pilsner, but one that seems a bit scared to stray away from convention. A good intro into the style and is definitely worthy of a try."
"I get an eh from this pilsner. I would probably prefer the less grainy American versions."
"fresh on-tap, this beer is remarkably good. just decent via bottle. poured into it's branded pilsner glass at glunz adds to the experience. very place straw color, perfect clarity, with a snow white tight lasting head and lace. subtle nose of bready, cracker-like malts and grassy noble hops. taste follows suit, with light malt sweetness perfectly balanced by the underlying slighlty spicy hops. finish is dry and clean. light in body, effervescent, and crisp. very, very sessionable."
"Overall very refreshing, very drinkable and very enjoyable. Good for those patio days, with a meal, or an extended drinking session."
"D: Very refreshing, yet full of flavor. A perfect complement to almost any meal, but can hold its own in the solo realm as well. A great example of the Pilsner style, and worth seeking out for any fans of them."
"Pours a nice golden clear straw yellow with 1.5 fingers of white head. A lot of nice citrus notes, some crackers and grains as well. Some honey in there as well. A lot of crackers and grain in the taste. Some notes of citrus, a slight vinousy character, as well. Sharp and crisp mouthfeel. Overall quite drinkable, but not my favorite."
"The mouthfeel, appearance, and drinkability seem to be what hinder this pilsener, nothing grand but it is solid, the best one I have had from a minikeg."
"I bought a single 11.2 ounce green bottle of this beer. I haven't had a beer in four days so the palate is clean and ready for beer. It's clear straw golden yellow in color with a decent little white head. Smells typical a ""German Purity Law of 1516"" beers. Sweet and malty just as this style of beer is intended to be. No other outstanding or unusual aromas, just beer. The taste reflects the smell perfectly but now a slight hint of hops can be detected as well. Nice texture with a sweet glaze that sticks to your teeth. Right amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink."
"for the price this one is worth a try, it should sink like a ship on a hot day"
"Poured from a very cool looking propaganda art-looking can, this beer is bright gold-orange in colour and displays a fine, bubbly white head which leaves dissipates after a short while but leaves a good amount of lacing behind. Some very nice grassy hops arise from the head accompanied by fresh bread like malts and some apple and ripe tomato notes as well. Taste is grassy and bready up front with some very nice buttery notes giving way to a dry, slightly bitter hop finish with some subtle caramel on the linger. I actually taste some belgian-esque yeast notes in the mid-sip as well as the beer rolls around in my mouth. Mouthfeel is typical of the style - light to medium bodied and very crisp with quite a tingly, spicy carbonation hit mid-sip and a very clean finish. As for drinkability, this beer rates high - a few cans of this pils would be no problem to throw back. I have had this beer before and it will certainly have a place in my fridge again. Quite an enjoyable, refreshing pils from Austria."
"Into an imperial pint, pours a light yellow, a decent white head to begin with, no head after a while, not much lacing either. Aroma smells of lemon grass, slightly metallic and mineral, not much pale malt. Taste is decent, mostly hops in grassy, mineral tones. The mouth is nicely carbonated, light, airy, easy to drink. I sum, its a stock pils."
"This beer pours a golden pale straw like colour which is very well carbonated and has a nice three finger creamy head which hangs around for a while,it has fresh aromas of grassy hops and some sweet malt,on taste it is exactly how it smells freshly cut hops with a nice sweet barley maltish finish quite a nice beer that would be better suited as a session beer in the summer but just wouldnt crawl over broken glass for it."
"500ml bottle. Pours clear gold with a substantial, fluffy white head that leaves nice lacing. Smells very sweet and grassy--lots of noble hop character. Strong honey notes as well. Sweet graininess in the taste, with just the right amount of hop bitterness to balance it. Grassy with some earthiness. Medium body. Really pleasant drinker."
"This beer is expensive: its around $13 for a 6 pack. I wont buy this beer for home use, even though it is good, because the price is just not waranted. Luckily there is a small Austrian Cafe' down the road that serves it on tap. ;)"
"I'm not one for pilsners, but this was a good one in my opinion."
"While I don't drink pilsners on a regular basis, this would probably be the first one I'd choose, which, as far as I'm concerned, is saying a lot."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a large white head that leaves heavy lacing on the glass. I was going to lower the score because the lack of color but then thought better of it because it is a pilsner and it did have an impressive head and nice lacing. The smell is intense hop aroma. The noble hops are on full display. Earth, herbal, pepper, and floral elements from the hops. No malt comes through in the aroma. The hops dominate the flavor as well. Nice herbal and pepper hop flavor. The malt does lend a dry cracker quality in the finish. Light body with a very active carbonation. Nothing really special here. A very refreshing beer. I like pilsners on the dry side so this one really appealed to me."
"The taste on the other hand, has only light grain taste and is thoroughly dominated by herbal, piney, grassy hop flavour, giving a tingly, zesty feel and a crisp, persistent bitterness from start to finish. Despite the clear dominance of the hops and lack of malty sweetness, it is not actually too bitter, though, and it's very nice."
"the palate is terribly dry which is a plus on my list... it tastes of earth, mildly bittered pale malt, floral and grassy hops and cooked lemon with a straw flavored dry slightly bitter finish which lingers. it's very crisp with an incredibly satisfying feel ... i guess i'm a saaz whore... since i had three. 7/3/7/3/14/3.4"
"Yeah, that unfortunate honey continues on the front palate and throughout to the finish. A little bit of bittering hop on the back, but very smothered by the syrupy character. Can't really recommend this - standard lagery characters with an unpleasant cloying sweetness. Mouthfeel is quite smooth but that's about all that's good about it. Otherwise, very average."
"I would rate this one lower, but it complimented my wurst nicely. (literally.)"
"16.9 oz Bottle poured into my pils glass producing a medium straw color with a thick white head and sticky, sticky lacing. Lively carbonation this ones good to look at. Light malty aroma, slightly sharp some bittering hops thrown in. Crisp and refreshing, this bites the palate ever so slightly. Flavor is very well balanced, there's a light peppery taste to round out the crisp malt, nicely hopped. Nice pilsener."
"Highly drinkable and thirst quenching."
"While Stiegle in not my favorite German Pilsner it is drinkable and is average or slightly above average."
"A pale looking golden color that pours a thickish head that evaporates to a thin film quickly. A little bit of lacing that is more spotty than anything else. Aroma is quite grassy or hay-like with a maltiness to it. It's not at all subtle but I can't really say I liked it either. There is somewhat of a sharp malt flavor, grassy notes, with a touch of spicy hops which is nice. Finishes crisp with a fuller mouthfeel than expected. Anytime I see the words ""malt liquor"" on a bottle I get flashbacks but overall this beer is decent albeit a bit middle of the road. I probably won't get it again as I can think of three Pilseners I've had in the past month that are far superior (North Coast Scrimshaw, Stoudts and Lagunitas)."
"Appears a very pale straw golden hue, basically like watered down apple juice golden. Carbonation has fine bubbles streaming upward from the bottom of my 16 oz Gordon Biersch glass. Head forms thick and dwindles down leaving behind even thin lacing with each sip. Labeled a pils but definitely hits more along the lines of a Euro lager or pils than a German or Czech style. Aromatic starts off with a snappy skunky hop flow with grapefruit peel Saaz and herbal tones galore, light pale malt doesn't offer much sweetness here. Only clean mineral water notes with a touch of metallic character coming across my senses. Flavor wise this beer is clean with a crisp bitterness and dry finish, definitely a mass produced Austrian beer. Herbal skunk weed hop notes run rampant I can't even say pure Saaz here more cluster hops than crisp classic Noble hop flavors. Bone dry on the mouthfeel carbonation is crisp carries this light bodied pils well, but this just can't compete with the likes of Penn Kaiser Pils, Troeg's Sunshine Pils, or Stoudt's Pils. Drinkabiltiy, overall I could enjoy this occasionally but with Prima Or Pikeland in PA, I don't have to consider not so fresh imports from Germany or in this case Austria."
"For a beer which looks a lot like a generic Euro Pale Lager, this actually delivers. This is a very decent German-style pils, almost verging into the sharpness of the Czech style. While there's only so much you can do with the style, this is pretty much a spot-on example."
"D: I hate to beat the dead horse, but why oh why can american macros, or for that matter american micros, not generate such a delicate and sophisticated Pils. This is the type of quality session beer the masses should be imbibing at taverns across America."
"I've had this beer several times and it's always good. It pours a light golden color with a small white head (about 1 finger thick. Maybe I poured wrong). To me the beer is smooth going down, a tad bit dry. No overpowering smells either. This is probably my favorite Pilsner I've had so far. I wish I could of given a more detailed review, but I'm still training my beer palette. Cheers!"
