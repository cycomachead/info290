"Strong, malty aroma has a decided yeasty overtone. Pours a bubbly clear yellow with a fairly thick ivory head. Crisp, refreshing fruity has good malty, fruity and yeasty notes, a grassy hop bitter undertone, maybe nothing special but definitely enjoyable. Smooth texture lacks firmness, and fizz leaves something to be desired. Still a decent pilsner."

"O: Keller Pils is a pleasant surprise. Especially since, unless I misread the stamp, this beer appears to be pretty damned old but my fault for not seeing that in store. This is good enough IMO to buy regularly but at $10/6, I likely will only revist it if on special. It is very good though."

"Crushable.  This sixer doesn't stand a chance..."

"Pours hazy and yellow with a scant head that fell fast and did not leave much lace. Nose is grass, sweet malt and lemon grass. Taste is dry, a touch buttery and a bit of lemon. Finishes with a slight bitter, some peach flesh and lemony notes. Coarse texture and a good mouthfeel."
""
""
"O: I could genuinely session this. This has enough flavor to make me want to take my time with it, but is still immensely drinkable. Would be great in the summertime, natch."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable but rather intensely flavored light beer. The small bottle makes a great taster, I think a big quaff would wear out its welcome. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle."

"Drinks easy. Tried one of these a little above lager temp & it did nothing for me. Surprised at how a few degrees makes a difference. Nice take on the style"

"Drinkability: Very hoppy for a pils. A must try. Original. Refreshing. Sessionable beer, perfect for summer and fall, oysters and fish."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that linger. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, light pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, biscuit, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, biscuit, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with nice flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice unfiltered pilsner style! All around nice balance of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured into a becker a lightly hazed oranged tinged medium golden with a fluffy bone white head that settled pretty slowly into a bubbly mass.Aromas were lightly toasted with some bready maltiness,faint herbal,leafy hops as well.More hop presence on the palate with green herbal notes along with a firm pretty dry crisp malt base.A sturdy well made unfiltered pilsner,not like a kellerbeer with it's bigger dose of hops,not bad."
""
"The palate opens with a soft and delicate balance between hop and malt. Dough, honey, cotton candy up front with a blend of lemons, a little mint and a soft, herbal bitterness, this beer is impressive. There's a softness and complexity to the palate that only kellerbiers have, with the blend of aforementioned flavors and a gorgeous creamy carbonation, this beer has a long finish with hop flavor a mild bitterness and a soft sweetness. Excellent."

"O: Not a lot to say other than I like it and would welcome several more into my belly though that would probably be a few too many. I think they did a great job on this one."
""
""

"Pours a hazy straw color with a nice, lumpy white head. Fresh spicy hop aroma...peppery, grassy, lemony, floral. Subtle clean cereal malt as well. A bit more malty sweetness in the flavor, but it in no way throws off the balance. Lots of delicious noble hops and a little dough. Light and crisp, finishing a little dry. Just a great Kellerbier all around. I only grabbed a single, but I would be very happy seeing a six pack in my fridge."
"Beer is medium in body weight, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a lightly effervescent, yet foamy and full mouthfeel. Closes dry, with medium levels of stickiness on the lips and tongue."
"notes: a cute, easy to drink, Summer sessioner. Good stuff."
""
""
"A crisp well made pilsner. A pleasant surprise."
"Overall, nothing incredibly impressive, but a very enjoyable pilsner that is highly drinkable."
""
"To call it a Keller, implies it's both unfiltered and maybe still contains live yeast. Unfortunately, there was no evidence of cloudiness or live yeast wither in aroma,flavor or in the pint glass. Nonetheless, I really shouldn't hold them up to ""German"" standards when it comes to nomenclature, should I? Still… WOW!"
""
""

"O- A really nice fresh tasting pilsner with lots of character. Lacking a little in the mouthfeel, and not as refreshing as it should be."
""
"Keller pils? This thing looks pretty damn filtered to me. Regardless, my complaining stops there. Clear deep golden with a white head that sticks here and there. Nice hop spice with a balanced bitterness - pepper, grass, and lemon peel. Mild bready maltiness. Neutral dry finish. A really nice pils here. Definitely worth a buy, but for a better price I think I'll go for Sierra Nevada Summerfest more often. I do love the idea of doing a single hop variety and rotating it each year. I just wish they would let us know what that variety is for palate education purposes."
"Mouthfeel is very good- I like a bitter pils and this ones pretty bitter with a light body (but full enough to stand up to the hops!) and clean refreshing feel. I would recommend it highly for those looking for a good bitter pilsner."

"Overall - A really good beer that is very drinkable and refreshing. While it does have a lot of flavour, it's well balanced. I've only had a few beers from this brewer, but they're all been winners so far."

"12 oz single bottle from ""Lifesource"" in Salem OR. $1.39 Poured into my PRB ""chalice"" it is a bright golden,slightly hazy pils ( seemed to be some yeast in the bottom as i poured..nice quarter inch sized white head. Good malty,biscuity aroma with a hint of Saaz type hop Taste is very nicely malted with a touch again of saaz type hopping, very balanced also getting some spiciness and yeasts showing through..like a regular pils mixed with a light hefeweizen..nice Good palate, very enticing . Excellent beer..would be terrific in the late Spring."

"An enjoyable Pilsner. The faint, sweet lemon hop notes are a nice touch."
""
""
"O: Overall a keller pils that has a distinct fresh and floral-herbaceous hopping that really stands out here. Creamy body, decent drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a solid pils. I like the rustic, aggressively hoppy vibe, just off-center enough to add notable character without detracting from the drinkability of the style."
"Overall: a satisfying and tasty Pilsner. I would definitely have this again."
"O: Very good"
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale yellow with a large white head that dissipates quickly. Plentiful tiny bubbles are visible in the beer, indicating adequate carbonation. The beer smells of biscuit malt with some grassy hops. The beer does have a bready aroma. There are flavors of cracker with some hop bitterness in the background to balance the beer. The flavors are very well balanced. The body is light with plentiful carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is very high for this refreshing pils. This is a very good beer that executes very well."
""
""
""
"overall: good stuff"
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium golden amber with a thin white head with good retention. Aroma of bready and a bit of biscuit malts, hint of hops. Flavor follows, starting with bready malt with hints of bicuit, finishing with noble hops and light lemon tang. Pretty much spot on for the style.Light to medium bodied with decent mouth feel from active carbonation. Nothing stands out, but tasty and well executed German pilsner for one of Seattle's rare really hot days."
""

"Toasted bread malts up front. Spicy, peppery hop bitterness soon after. Bready, honeyish malt sweetness fills up the palate. Hops turn a little dank and skunky (in a good, noble way). Peppery, spicy hops in the finish. Dry and refreshing. Lingering sweetbread malt. Medium-bodied, with a surprisingly thick, chewy, smooth feel. Delicious and quaffable. Nice!"
"Decent pilsener. It's one of the more flamboyant of the style, but I dig its character. 4.0"
"Pours a bright hazy yellow with a solid 1/2 inch of sticky white head. Looks good. Smells is of typical Pilsner malts (a touch skunky) with a good bit of citrus hop bitterness. Taste is balanced the skunky flavors of the pilsner yeast balanaces well with the hops and the malt. Mouthfeel is somewhat clean and light. Overall not something I would seek out again but not a bad Pilsner from Southampton."
""
"D: pretty tasty stuff. besides some minor DMS, pretty solid keller pils."
"Just excellent. Everything is so well balanced and integrated with lots of nuance. Really well made and now one of my favorite lagers. Something I would highly recommend."
"O: This beer is very crisp and refreshing making it a very enjoyable beer for the summer. This beer is very sessionable and one that I would like to have again."
""
"Well crafted flawless beer."
""
"Overall: For a Pils, this beer does go over well. I really did enjoy this brew and will continue to again when given the chance. Not sure if its a beer I would order on a full time basis, but something I would totally recommend to friends and fellow beer drinkers."

""
"O - Overall a great tasting American made pilsener. Highly drinkable, and very refreshing in hot weather."
"This beer pours a clear bright yellow with a thin head and minimal lacing. It's aroma is mainly lemons with cake and a hint of vanilla. The flabor leads off with lemons followed on the palate by birthday cake and a bubbly champagne-like snap. The finish reveals a note of hop bitterness but is balanced. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Southhampton Keller Pils is a good brew, recommended."
"very good, would I go out of my way to find this ? probably not, but in a pinch you would not go wrong bringing this to a Q."
"O - A very nice American take on a classic pils style. Plenty of flavor and lingering bitterness. I dig it."
"O: I look forward to having a couple of these every year. This is just an excellent Pils. The hop varieties change every year but it seems very subtle."
""
"Flavor follows the nose, although the bready malt is the dominant taste; grassy hops are next in line, and there’s just a trace of lemony citrus in the finish. Lightly grainy and bitter at the same time. Body is medium-light with crisp carbonation. Clean and refreshing but a bit unremarkable."
""
""

"Good flavor and very drinkable but not much of a crisp or clean finish I like in a pilsner. I can appreciate the craft that has gone into producing this beer but overall it just doesn't do it for me."

"Southampton never fails to hit the mark, and their Keller Pils is no exception. The malt is grainy and sweet, and the hops are floral and spicy - both in the aroma and the flavor. The small amount of yeast adds a subtle touch of character as well. It's solidly bitter, but not overdone, leaving it perfectly balanced. The malt appears up front, followed immediately by the hop flavors, and then a rising bitterness as you enter the long, dry finish. It's not a complex beer, nor is it intended to be, but it is full of flavor. if there's any flaw here it's that the head retention could be better. Quite nice. Well worth trying."

"golden hay color with loads of carbonation and a fizzy white head that capped out at three inches and then settled down to nothing, not thrilled with that. aroma is very light and clean. bready and cereal grains, light touches of grassy and floral notes and a touch of light hay. very light and clean"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, some grains. Taste is crisp, slightly sweet, a bit of malts and grains, just a touch of hops at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Overall, a nicely done keller pils maybe a touch heavy on the wheat/biscuit type malts but still very tasty."
"From a bottle, pours a light mostly clear gold with a small fluffy white head. Nose is fresh cracked grain, pilsner hops, some grass. Mouth is a vibrant expression of fresh grain, a pleasant hop quality that kind of swells in the mid palate, a touch of grass and maybe some light citrus rind. A little bit of an eggy quality that creeps in, as with some of the hoppier German pilsners. Not super snappy but pretty nice, definitely more in the German style than in the Czech style."
"Hats of to these guys for producing a quality lager unlike a majority of craft brewers."
"O: First beer from them."
"Overall it should be very enjoyable to lovers of pilsner. I found it had a nice citrus edge that paired nicely with some grilled scallops and shrimp."
"Pours a hazed yellow gold color with average cap of white froth, decent retention. Scent is quite pleasant - pilsner malt forward with equal parts doughy bread, cut grass, lemongrass and a faint splash of earthy spice. Taste follows scent, good lightly sweet pilsner malt with some graininess to it, doughy bread and the hops bring cut grass, lemon zest and herbal spice. Medium bodied, dry finish. Overall a pleasant surprise, good flavor all around with some grainy heft to it."
"Overall not the hoppiest pills(not that they are supposed to be) but one of the more enjoyable I have had the chance to drink. It is perfect for drinking in hot and humid weather."
"Tough to score this one to style for appearance, as it's listed as a German Pils. For what it is, the cloudiness and color would be expected. Realy smooth, and easy drinking, hoppy pils for the summer."
"O - a refreshing and very flavorful lager perfect for a hot evening."
"D: Goes down easy as you'd expect for a beer often served in 1L steins."
"This is a good example of a pilsner. Nothing unique to it except for a slightly higher than average bitterness. Its a summer drinking pils that you can drink a few of with some burgers."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at the Foodery bottle shop in Philadelphia, PA. Drank this a few hours ago, so I don't remember much. What I do remember clearly is that the sweetness of the German malts really balance out the bitterness of those noble hops. An unfiltered offering from a fine brew house. A---"
"Very nice beer..."
"Overall, slightly above average Pilsner. This is meant for the summer for sure because it goes down like water. The taste is decent but I've had better Pilsner's."
"Out of the bottle on 23 Nov.  Not too  much aroma. Very nice balance throughout. Still the SBC stubbie, I believe."
"Overall: a pretty good pils, which admittedly isn't my favorite style in the world. Certainly worth a try if you're looking for something thirst quenching on a hot day. Cheers!"
"Crisp and clean with no aftertaste. A flavorful brew thats not over aggressive."
"Pours a hazy, light gold, decent head, a bit of lacing. Smells of wheat, and white bread crusts, some floral notes, not much hops. Taste is yeasty, lemony and refreshing. Very little hops, carbonation is perfect. This is an easy drinker and a solid pilsner."
"Chalk one up to the Latrobe brew dudes! Good work on the contract brew, fellas."
"Drinkability: nicely quaffable beer. Somewhat refreshing and nicely hopped pilsner. This beer goes down quickly and has a nice flavor profile."
"Golden with a small froth of white head that retains as a ring through the session. Aroma is faint, but I get fresh hay. Flavors are undeniably German pils. Clean and crisp, dry grassiness. A little sweetness kicks in from the malt, almost honey like. Easy drinking and quite enjoyable."
"D: This is an exceptionally drinkable beer discovered through my search for a Keller/Zwickel."
"Extremely drinkable and quite possibly one of the best pilsners I've had the pleasure of drinking in quite a while. Much more characterful than many examples out there, and most definitely sessionable by American standards. I could drink this all night long."
"Dry bananas that get popped in the middle by a dry fist of pilsner malts and German, earthy, grassy hops. The finish is a bit bitter, not good hoppy bitter, but still leaves you thirsty for more. The dry palate with a little sweetness helps too."
"Session beer? This one fits the bill pretty well and I could easily have had more than one in a sitting. It's too bad this style isn't more popular, since it combines the drinkability of a Pils with the body and hue of a Wheat beer. I know it's Fall but it's seasonals like this that make me wish that Summer was still here!"
"although upon having it again it was rather heavy handed and banana lager tang. i hope you get a good one. but i think this may be a one time brewing making it great or not so great in a given year. so far... 2010... great... 2011... a bit above average and ferment funky."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer overall but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"The beer has a nice golden yellow color to it, with a 1"" head that dissaptes quickly with just a little lace around the edge of the glass. The smell is nice and hoppy. This pils has a nice hop taste to it and i smooth, not very carbonated. Great mouth feel and is very drinkable."
"Pours cloudy yellow with a mushroom cloud of white foam that quickly dissipitated. A biere de garde keller element with the pils, nice is you appreciate the keller. Above average mouthfeel, good drinkability. A little lemon, a little pils malt.Good fall refreshment."
"I hate to say it but this would be a great ""cross over"" beer. I just don't like that term but it would work well for that purpose. It's really well done and I will be buying more of this."
"Poured ontap. A hazed dirty blonde colored beer. Head is small and leaves little lace. Smell is hoppy, with some German pilsner malt backing. Flavor is more of the same, sour euro hops and pilsner/2-row barley malt. A bit of tobacco leafyness but otherwise a well balanced beer. Light bodied and easy drinking."
"Despite the decidedly filtered look here, this had everything that you would want in a Keller Bier. Refreshing citrus flavor, well balanced bitterness, and I liked the crisp snap that the Pils malts brought to this. Tasty and refreshing, I'm glad to see that they now have this one out in bottles."
"Definitely unfiltered, and with a completely different profile than a normal pilsner. I'd say this nicely fits the bill for a keller beer. Pours a cloudy light yellow with a relatively thin head. Somewhat light in the nose, but it is yeasty, lightly hoppy, and with some light citrus as well. The taste is much more robust. Nice yeasty flavors with a touch of citrus and nicely herbal hops. Somewhere between a pilsner and a with in flavor, without the orange and coriander. Very nice. Crisp and refreshing, slightly prickly in the mouth, but a wonderful quencher."
"D - Jam! This beer rocks. It could be one of my favorite pilsners. Great drinkability and flavor with a near perfect mouthfeel, Keller Pils is a terrific start to my brew day! Nice and refreshing."
"***PS--I had an older bottle of this (>2 months) and it wasn't as good--skunky. Definitely a seasonal to be consumed AFAP."
"D - I like the way the Keller pils gives you what you are craving, it has yeast so it is a true unfiltered lager and the resins soften the carbonation that is there for a light refreshing beer, great for a late August day. I am really a fan of this probably more than my rating implies"
"Very easy drinking, crisp and refreshing, particularly considering it is 1 day from the best by date. Will definitely nab a fresh sixer next spring!"
"M: Strong carbonation, and very good mouthfeel for the style. Perhaps a little thicker than I expected but enjoyable and very drinkable."
"On tap at The Biltmore in Newton. Served in a standard pint glass. Pale yellow color. Nice contrasting white head. Good amount of carbonation. Smell had a bit of hay and fresh cut grass. Taste was great for a pilsener. Snappy bite of malt, with just enough hops to coat the palate at the finish. Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing. It was also smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol abv was low enough to make this a great afternoon beer, or a good session beer later in the day. A nice accompaniment to lunch. This is a quality pils that I could have easy drank from a much larger stein in much bigger quantities. Very true to it's German heritage."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is terrific! It has a crisp, clean pilsner malt scent along with a wonderful, bitter hop aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a damn fine pilsner malt flavor that smooth and easy drinking. The hops offer a great, bitter flavor; a really well balanced taste. It goes down quick with a clean, dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very good pilsner. It's bold in taste and aroma; a good drinker."
"Overall the malt flavors weren't quite crisp enough to knock the flavor profile into the next level but even as it is I found this to be a refreshing beer. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: One operative word for this beer is ""balanced."" The malt and hop character complement each other and balance each other very nicely. In addition they blend smoothly into each other. Each sip followed the last quite naturally and I enjoyed this one enough that it was also my choice for a second glass. Very drinkable."
"This is pretty darn drinkable. Refreshing and crisp...well worth a shot!"
"A solid unfiltered pils. Different than filtered pils, has a rawness to it that i found very enjoyable. I could drink a lot of this."
"This is a solid Pilsener, but nothing super exciting. It is a beer that is well made to style with a nice pale color, good noble hop aroma and flavor and a solid biscuity malt background. This is a very sessionable beer, and one that I would order again, if I were at the bar watching a baseball or football game and didn't want anything too challenging. Thirst-quenching and well-rounded"
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, saaz hops and small sweet fruitiness. In the taste, just like the aroma, a nice hop bite and a small fruitiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a clean maltiness in the aftertaste. A clean pils, nice small fruit hint."
"The mouthfeel is dry and light bodied, with a smooth feeling all the way through. Easily drinkable, while still being interesting. Great seasonal."
"D: Quite refreshing and a nearly perfect complement for the dinner it was united with. Good flavors and aromas, an all-around solid pilsner. Absolutely would have this again; another good job by Southampton."
"Highly drinkable and enjoyable, it is very good and easy to drink, but just doesn't have the punch of some other complex beer styles, but (BIG BUT) this is a good representation of a pilsner and well above average overall."
"D-I am a sucker for kellerbiers and this one is no exception. A crisp, clean and refreshing brew that is perfect for summertime drinking."
"Hazy, lemon yellow with a snow white head that leaves some decent looking lace on the glass. Untoasted grain and pungent noble hops with a touch of lemon sugar cookie in the aroma. This is an excellent pils that really tastes like what I would imagine a really fresh example of a German or Czech pils might taste like. Soft lemon and fresh bread dough with a nice snap of noble hop bitterness. Finishes dry and clean. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. A great lawnmower/session beer."
"Snappy and crisp, some dry bitterness in the aftertaste suggest hops, but not in an overt way. Mild pilsner malt sweetness, not overpowering, it blends 50/50 with the noble hop bitterness. Let it warm up a bit and it has a little more depth to it. Solidly crafted, a Pils for hot weather in whatever quantity you choose."
"My only complaint is that it's apparently a seasonal and will probably soon be disappearing from the shelves. I've been back to Julio's and purchased several additional 6-packs but would love to be able to do so throughout the year."
"D: Very drinkable, it has a reasonable abv, it has a good feel to it, and nice flavors that are not overwhelming making it a great summer beer to drink."
"D: This is very drinkable pilsner, and another solid offering from Southampton. This is good interpretation of the style but there are some different flavors working here that make this one stand out. I picked this one up as a single, and wish I bought a 6pk."
"I found this beer in Moon at the Beer Store and I snagged the last remaining sixer just based off of the buzz I've heard. Great looking pils really rushes the palate and senses with fresh hops, this is a varietal I heard this years was Hallertau. Bright brilliant white foam cap leaves even lacing down the sides of my conical Victory prima pils glass. The golden straw has a sight haze over it like hop resins floating in the delicious summer seasonal. The nose comes and climbs in my nares with a nice full on sharp citrus peel tone lemons/limes more than anything else. Cereal biscuit malts sit beneath that strong citric hop bouquet. Flavor is aggressive with a biting hop edge of citrus fruit amongst a great bready light biscuit pale malt additions. Smooth lagering shows off what most lagers attempt to do. While drinking this I can't stop remembering old Tupper's Hop Pocket Pils. Hop burps pile on after half the glass is completed, mouthfeel is sturdy tight bubbled carbonation with a light bodied slightly oily feeling brew. Nice bone dry finish te way a German pils is supposed to check in with. Overall this is excellent stuff, it's something else to see heads and shoulders above the other 12 ounce offerings in bottle. A go to summer offering that may have to track down a whole case of, I only grabbed six at my local because that's all that was left in the cooler."
"D- Wow, this is a super drinkable refreshing summer beer. This is a refreshing (literally) departure from the high ABV non-sessionable beers out there. Highly recommended."
"D - solid all-around, great example of a great (and under appreciated style). could drink this all night. nicely done."
"Another good offerinng from Southampton."
"Incredibly drinkable. Nice going , Southampton."
"D: A well made, drinkable pilsner."
"Medium-light and crisp. Easy drinking. Interesting twist on the style. Great evening-on-the-porch beer."
"D - Easy drinking pilsner with a nice crisp flavor that's pretty solid all around, although I could have done without the hint of butter and average appearance."
"D: Solid. This would go down in about 5 minutes on a hot day after mowing the lawn."
"This one hit the spot nicely. When it comes to Pils, however, my $$ usually goes to Victory Prima. Glad I grabbed this one and I'll probably go back to it a few more times this summer season now that Noble Pils is gone."
"Overall a superior example of the style. Fresh fresh fresh."
"D: Very drinkable. And only 5%? I was fooled by that, although in retrospect it did go down very easily."
"More grassy notes, cinnamon like spice, noble hops drying things out. Worthy sessioner, decent with a lot if different types of food. Not a huge fan of the style, but this one is worth a try at least."
"Too similar to the macros for me, although to their credit there is a good hop finish to this beer. Thin body with a high level of carbonation, even for the style."
"goes down pretty well. a bit more bitter and spicy than some other american pilsners I have had, which kinda works in this instance. not bad."
"The taste is quite tart through and through. A number of reviewers pegged this with Hallertau hops and that could very well be. There is nothing estery or fruity about the hops, just the dryish leafy bittering quality that you find in this type. There is a lemony acidic quality to the beer that complements the dry hop quite well. There is some grainy and grassy qualities, a noticeable lagery mouthfeel and pricklishness, a slight carbonation, a touch of soury herbalness and you have this beer in a nutshell. It is refreshing, light bodied, a good summer lager all the way around."
"Drinkability: A good, quality pils and a refreshing way to beat the heat here in miserable, muggy ole Georgia."
"D: Goes down very easy, not filling, not much of a kick but a fantastic beer to have on a hot summer day."
"F: Long bitterness, some astringent hops as well, grassy and spicy hops with quite a bit of bitterness. A little light malty flavors and sweetness linger, but mostly just hops. This is more like an American pale wheat lager or something rather than German Pils, kinda tasty but heavier and much less drinkable than I would have liked."
"I have tried to be fair to this beer and I admit that I do not have a lot of experience with this style. I am a huge fan of the Southampton Double White!"
"o - if this was available locally, and inexpensive, it would be a great summer beer."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. I'm always happy to see an unfiltered keller pils, though I would have liked a little more of the earthy character that sets these apart from a regular German pilsner. The Hallertauer Tradition hops dominate with a herbal mix of citrus, spice, and floral notes. The malts are pretty mellow but marked by fresh bread notes. No matter how you look at it, this is a very tasty pils."
"D: This is a perfect beer for the summer: it's very crisp and refreshing."
"Drinkability: I would have this again on a warm summer day, I recommend this to those seeking a mildly hoppy and distinct open with a classic pilsner finish."
"I'd be happy to have cases of this lying around for the summer months. For some occasions, I might recommend drinking this from the bottle as opposed to pouring it into a glass depending on your mood. From the bottle the flavors are a bit more focused or concentrated; the bitterness enhanced. Into the glass everything is lightened and perhaps a bit smoother. Either way, it's good drinkin'."
"The Southampton Keller Pils had a light body in terms of its supporting malts, but each taste seemed enhanced and a step forward for the ale."
"* Note: There is a SH Pre-Prohibition Pils listed on the site that is labeled as a Keller Bier. However, I do not feel that this is the same beer as this beer does even come close to having the body of a Keller Bier and this is a new bottled seasonal which clearly identifies this beer as a Pils."
