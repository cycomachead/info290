"one of the few pilsners i enjoy"
""
""
"A solid, fruity, fairly crisp pilsner that hides is high-abv very well, this Save Our Shore is a solid euro-pils with maybe a bit too much textural weight but decent head, excellent retention, and some cool lacing patterns in my frosted Abita shaker-pint.  The hopping is mild, but nicely accentuates the yeast-malt fruitiness that resounds through this beer's flavor-profile; however I would've liked more effervescence to carry this pilsner home.  It's a fun effort—and a good cause, charitably-speaking—but it's solidly unspectacular, unfortunately.  I'm normally a big fan of high-abv pilsners, but this doesn't quite hit the snuff."

"Pours a light, clear yellow gold with nice fizzy head reducing to decent lacing bubbly around all sides of the glass. Aroma is both malty and hoppy with the malt winning the battle. Moderate carbonation. Taste is more malt sweetness than hops but they are both there and living in harmony. Ever so slight alcohol burn. Beer seems to have lost a little of its boldness, though. I am drinking it just 8 days before the best by date. Overall, decent pilsener, nothing incredible..."

"Not sure about the pilsner designation.  Has an odd flavor to it.  Some sweetness that reminds me of caramel or molasses.  Stronger than it looks."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is grassy, floral hops. Taste is grassy, lemons, light malts, hops are present, alcohol well hidden. Feels medium-light in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Pretty plain and just ok pilsner. Didn't do anything to grab me. Overall I think Abita's ales are better than their lagers, but that's just my opinion."
""
""
"O/D - This was a good pils. It was clear that they used wheat in it and it did well with the hop flavour. Good balance and drinkable."
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium, resulting in a foamy (9/10) and slightly smooth (1/10) mouthfeel that comes across as rather soft and pillowy. This is appropriate for the beer, making it pleasurable and easy to drink, and within boundaries for the helles bock style in general."

"Overall: This is very good tasting beer. Its clean taste is a testament to the local natural spring water used to brew this beer. Abita Brewing Co. has dedicated 75 cents from every bottle sold toward the rescue and restoration of the environment. This is differently a must try beer."
"Pours out to a golden color and rich white head. Aroma is sweet grains and a bit of bubblegum and spice. Flavor is weak grainy and sort of bland with just enough hops to balance. Mouthfeel is ok. Overall I'm confused as to what I was served. The server at O'Charleys in Monroe told me it was like a Blue Moon but with lemon instead of orange. It was served with a lemon wedge. Kind of tastes like a wit and a weak American all malt lager. Stay tuned."

"Overall - A crisp, refreshing German pils by Abita. Excellent balance of sweet malts and bitter hops. Also a fantastic appearance."

"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 10/30/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, bread, cracker, wheat, light banana, pepper, clove, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, pepper, light banana, clove, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, wheat, banana, cracker, bread, clove, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pilsner style. All around well balanced malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Brewed in louisiana. Bottle from bevmo for 3.49 and 75 cents goes to charity to save our shore. First time trying it. Nice big white head looking hazy n pale yellow. Flowery, very hoppy for a pilzner. Crisp clean n refreshing. Im impressed. Id buy it again."
"O - A nice beer to sit back and relax with. Drink it cold or don't even bother. The difference is startling."

"Overall for an imperial pilsner it's not bad. Granted its not my favorite style but it was worth the 3 dollar price tag. Plus 75 cents goes to help nature and shit! Hells yeah!"

"Nice golden yellow in the glass with a near pure white head that retreats to a layer of small bubbles. The smell is of sweet malt and bread with a bit of spicy hop character in the background, a touch of fruity ester comes through as well. The taste follows the smell with a base of clean and slightly sweet pale malt. The hops are restrained but definitely present with great noble hop spice and grassy flavors. The carbonation is somewhat low to moderate and the finish of this beer is almost very clean leaving just a bit of sticky hop flavor and malt. Overall this isnt a world class german pilsner but it is a pretty good american made example of the style and the cause benefited by sales of this beer make it well worth it."

"O- I don't plan to buy this one again. I'm glad that $0.75 made it to a good cause, but unless a sour-vanilla pilsner sounds right up your alley or you're a big fan of ABITA already, I'd say skip this for Purple Haze or their standard Amber."
""

"O: I wouldn’t classify this beer as a true pilsener—it is more like a hefeweizen, but either way it hides its alcohol very well."

"Pours hazy golden with an abundant white head. The head dissipates, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. There are a lot of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of sweet malt and hops. It's such a bright earthy smell. The taste is sweet from the malts and is balanced by the hop bitterness. There's some citrus flavor from the hops, which helps cut with the bitterness and sweetness to produce an excellently balanced beer. The alcohol does not come through in the taste, but you will notice the effect as you continue to drink the beer. The flavors only get better as the beer warms. The beer is medium bodied with a creamy, yet crisp mouthfeel. The crispness comes from the abundant carbonation. This is very easy to gulp. Overall, this is an excellent and interesting beer."

"Although not remarkable, SOS is a fairly smooth and drinkable pils. Refreshing too, this is a nice companion to my soup and salad lunch."
""
"O: A good, but average pilsner. I've had some that I greatly prefer, but I wouldn't turn this down if offered it again."
"Overall there is some noticeable alcohol heat but nothing that warrants a gag or disappointing drinking experience. This feels very easy drinking, and offers a good pilsner enjoyment. I am usually not that impressed by this brewery but I could easily have this again and probably will."

"Pours a one finger pure white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear pale amber/yellow color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light hop nose and flavor is a hoppy caramel. Light hoppy/bitter finish. $2.04 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, Vt."

"Looks similar in color to Andygator (golden honey) but this one has a two finger fluffy foamy head that stuck around for more than a minute and left behind some pretty nice lacing, body is light and carbonation is at exactly the right sort of effervescent level for a pilsener. Smells mostly lemony but also medium pale malt scent is there, flavor is not nearly as heavy on the hop spicing as I had anticipated. (I originally thought it would be a Czech-style until I did my homework) but it works as a German Pilsener that depends almost entirely on floral and earth toned hopping. I'm not picking up on any of the subtle fruit tones mentioned by other BAs, however. So I'm left with a really pretty beer that has a really great mouthfeel and very simplistic and clean flavors and aromas."
"Decent for a charity beer."
"Served from bottle into a Spaten Optimator dimpled mug. Poured a golden yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spices, and a subtle floral note. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, wheat, subtle spices, and subtle fruit. It had a very light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing really stood out on this brew with the exception of the floral note I picked up on. The rest of the brew was kind of weak in flavor in my opinion as nothing really jumped out at me. Not bad for the style, but not great either. Worth trying though even if it is for the good cause they are brewing it for."
"Found at Cardinal Liqs, Niles IL"
"I'm not a huge pilsener guy, but this was crisp, balanced and highly drinkable. More than happy to contribute to those poor people and wildlife screwed by big oil. Good job Abita."
"O: Enjoyable for the style! I'm still not a huge pilsener fan, but this is one I could drink again. Well done."
"Pretty refreshing overall, and the wheat makes for a varied, interesting approach to the style. Drinking this calls up images of the beach and ocean waves- or maybe i'm just influenced by the very-cool artwork on this label."
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap. Nice foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat/grains, grassy notes, and some citrus aromas. Taste is of bread grains and some herbal/citrus zest hops. Mild hop bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pilsener that I am glad I picked up. It's nice to see a brewery involved in the community with this type of cause."
"A nice beer overall."
"Overall Drinkability - This is NOT a pilsner to my taste buds. It is an ESB and/or American Wheat at heart."
"O: exceptional, and not just because it's ""charitable""; very good brew by Abita"
"Pours a hazy yellow in an oversized pilsner glass. Produces a medium sticky head. Smells of yeast, lemon, and a bit of hop. Taste is dry, grain, lemongrass, yeast. Bright and refreshing. Great balance of yeasty grainy malt and a little hop on the rear of the tongue. Aftertaste leaves you wanting more. High/ medium carbonation goes down smooth and very quenching. Spot on for the style. This is PERFECT hot weather beer. A good stepping off point for beginners, I would venture. A fine example of a style I love this time of year."
"Overall: A delicious introduction to Abita! Plus... there can't be a better reason to buy beer than to donate to a cause!! Cheers!"
"an excellent american twist on a summer helles. this has hints of sweetness and brisk as hell hopping. the abv isn't noticeable at all. and the grain isn't heavy handed as in mineral dominate. golden with 2 fingers of sticky head. nose of dextrin and unfermentable sugars blended with german lager yeast. palate is lemon zesty but doesn't drop off as fast as a pilsner would. mild sweetness. very mild earthiness. lemon pulp hints but still has a significant mineral character that makes it very dry... but more so tannin sticky. this doesn't have a husky lingering quality either. great feel."
"A good beer for a good cause."
"O - Solid effort, but an overall forgettable beer. Still, it's for a good cause so I'll happily enjoy this one!"
"Overall: An ok pilsner but nothing I would reach for again. I would sooner get their golden ale. A little less alcohol heat would make me want this more though."
"Pours a very clear golden color with a thin white head. Not much retention but some good spotty lacing and a nice collar on the way down. The nose carries quite a bit of bready malt with an ever-so-slight presence of floral hops. The flavor is mostly bread with a touch of sweetness and grain. Nothing too complex and no real hops. The body is not terribly impressive. Fairly thick and chewy with lower levels of carbonation. Some alcohol and no real hop presence. Not a big fan of this."
"Also 75cents of every bottle sold goes to helping clean up the gulf coast, so come on people buy one and enjoy it by drinking beer you are helping the planet. I dont need a better reason to drink then that."
"O - This has decent drinkability. It goes down fairly easy, and it refreshing. Overall, I thought it was a decent pilsner. It was a little bit underwhelming, and I didn't like the bitter finish. It was worth a try though."
"I really like this one from Abita. Their brand had fallen out of style for me, but this one might bring me back in. Hides the abv shockingly well."
"Overall Decent pilsner and very drinkable if you are a fan of pilsners which i'm not I would give it a try"
"O - A very pleasing easy drinker. I'm not overly partial towards Pilseners, but I would certainly buy this again"
"Pours a straw colored yellow into a pilsner glass. Abita's SOS shows lots of carbonation, and a head that just won't quit. The smell is mild hops, and even milder citrus. SOS' taste is bready, and only very mildly hoppy. It's a mellow pilsner that's incredibly easy to drink. Maybe it's because I'm on vacation as I write this review, but if this beer is sending out a message on conservation, I'm all in -- except as it relates to SOS: I want more."
"I thought this was great. It definitely put pilseners back on my beer radar. The balance was superb and it remained easygoing yet flavorful."
"O: Not bad for a pilsner, and for $5 for a 22oz it's a good one to get someone else into craft brews."
"Overall very good beer, and for a good cause to boot."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a faint Saaz hop. In the taste, a sweet malt and a small saaz hop, very clean though. A small hop bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry saaz/ pilsner hop in the aftertaste. A standard pils, yet a bit sweeter."
"Pale lager yes, imperial pilsner no. Malty, Saaz hops. A little funky and malty aroma. Yellowish body. Rather a story of sugary malt predominates, with drying, slight bitterness in the finish. A drop of lemon. Above average carbonation. Passable beer."
"O: It was fine, on the boring and forgettable side. The bottle artwork is pretty cool though, but that doesn't get this beer any bonus points."
"I like that this bottle calls it a charitable pilsner. I decided to pick this one up in Florida because the bottles are much fresher than in Indiana. It poured a not quite transparent gold with a half finger white head. It smelled of light hops with pale honey like malts with a dash of lemon zest. It tastes pretty bitter for a pilsner. It tastes of the pale malt, honey, and lemon grass. The honey kind of fades into the background. This beer is as drinkable as most and was pretty good."
"Overall a great drink, the alcohol is not evident on the tongue or throat but has crept up as I finished the bottle. A beer that donates proceeds is another plus in my book."
"Even though I split this with a friend, I could have finished this myself since the alcohol couldn't be felt at all. This isn't as crisp as a textbook Pils but it's still easygoing with just a bit more body to it than I anticipated. It's good to see that this was brewed with a cause in mind and thankfully, the beer measures up to that aspiration."
"Drinkability: This is a nice beer to sip. I'm sure it would be very nice as the weather gets warmer."
"D: Good drinkability, but the high abv definitely knocks it down a peg or two, as it is felt and tasted."
"I do like this although I'm not sure the circumstances to buy it. Easily drinkable, although relatively lower end of flavor spectrum. Not really much of a wheat beer taste. With that said, it does go down easy and is a good flavor. More of a pilsner taste to me."
"$.75 of your dough will benefit the Gulf Coast relief efforts, according to Abita's pretty cool label work. That may be enough reason to pick one up."
"For what it is its drinkable. Being 7% the alcohol could sneak up on you real easy. Def a good alternative to a true pils or wheat beer."
"Save Our Shores pilsner is clean, refreshing, very drinkable, tasty, and a quality brew. The more wheat beer flavor it has adds complexity and makes it more enjoyable. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a reasonably priced and great quality pilsner, especially in this hot summer (it was 106 F in Denton last week!). And you're helping the Gulf with the oil spill when you buy it. It's a win-win scenario!"
"D: gotta love a beer with a cause, especially a good one."
"Quite good. Grew on me as the glass emptied."
"D - Heavier than I was expecting. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers, but this one was a good balance with the lighter pilsener profile. The ABV strength was very deceptive."
"Verdict: Actually halfway decent, which in this case DOESN'T mean it sucks. Rather, it's something to try when you need to quickly run to the store and grab something off the rack..."
"D--Crazy good. Pilsners tend to be one of my least favorite. but this one makes me want to head back to the store to but out the lot. Especially at $2.99/ bomber."
"I upped the drink as 3.50 for a bomber of this is great"
"D: A pretty nice pilsener from Abita. The wheat adds a little malt subtlety to a style that's normally pretty conventional, but it's not a showstopper. Still, this drinks pretty smoothly and, most importantly, avoids becoming too cidery-sweet for such a relatively alcoholic lager. A worthwhile beer that supports a worthwhile cause - nothing wrong with that."
"Overall a very nice pilsner. By far the best beer I have had from Abita."
"Decent pilsner. NOthing special, but one of the better quality Abita beers I've ever tasted."
"D: Very standard for the style, but nothing amazing. Really easy to drink, but simple flavor."
"Pours beautifully with dense carbonation and a generous foamy head. The color is pale gold. Fresh, clean smells of lemon, light grain and malt. The taste is great; in fact superior to any Abita I've had and I tend to really like all their beers. Rich and subtle flavors of malt, slight lemon, caramel, licorice, mint, and floral undertones. A very sturdy yet refreshing beer. As near to delicious as any pilsner or lager I've ever had. Excellent beer and highly recommended. It seems like maybe a limited release or something only available in 22oz bottles for about $6-$7.00."
"Side note: I've been to NOLA a handful of times and it is an amazing city... Not the biggest fan of other Abita offerings, but this is pretty good and if you ever get a chance to visit, do it."
"D- a Very drinkable beer, also a very cool idea, props to abita on that."
"Pours a protein-hazed straw color. A thin white head rings around the glass a bit. Smells fresh and sharp, like a cool Gulf breeze. Also, biscuity and spicy. Really get some nice esters on the top of the taste, as well as some spicier grape notes. There is lemony zest too, and the malts are smooth and full. Diggin' the wheat in this one. A pleasant, mildly sharp bitterness finishes it off. Carbonated nicely, great body. Drinkability good. A fine beer for a good cause."
"Pours a deep straw with a decent finger and a half of head, very nice lacing. Good amount of wheat malt in the nose along with some fresh cut grass. The taste is a very wheat heavy German pilsner. The hops don't quite balance it out. Not a bad pils and I'm happy to say I tried it."
"This is a well brewed pilsener, clearly worth the effort."
"My pour resulted in just over a finger of thick, foamy, bone-white head with good retention. The sun is up and out after yesterday's snow storm and it looked like liquid sunshine in the glass. Deep golden in color with a light haze and some floaties evident, in keeping with the unfiltered part of the description. Nose was really spicy and I suddenly realized that they did not mention anything about yeast. It was slightly sweet, but with a spiciness that could only be yeast-driven. I was not sneezing, so it was agreeable. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of tastes on the tongue. Initially, I caught a peppery spiciness, then some grassy notes, followed by a biscuit flavor. The finish was very dry, very peppery, very refreshing. Strike two for The Woodman on this day, opening beers MUCH better suited for warmer (read ""hot"") weather. I am an idiot at times, but at least I know to look for this in the summer if it is still available."
"D/M: smooth drinking, nice bright taste, light, airy, medium carbonation tingle, goes down nice and easy"
"Good money gone to a good cause. While I'm not big on Abita beers I was surprised with this one."
"Hopefully a fair amount of money went to the cause at $8/22 oz."
"D- Average, really the cause this brew goes toward increases its drinkability"
"T/M - Crisp and a little dry. Slightly grainy and spicy at first followed by a nice earthy hop flavor. A great dry finish and overall a very drinkable beer."
"The palate is dry but refreshing. I know the abv. is 7%. Making this beer by most peoples' standards unsessionable. I would agree with their logic, but this beer tastes very sessionable to me."
"D - Pretty good. A good beer overall for a good cause. I like my pilz to be a lot cleaner and crisper but I still enjoyed this one quite a bit."
"Bottle. Poured into a pint glass a clear golden color with a big fluffy white head of 2 fingers. Clean and crisp aroma of light cereal. Sweet start that gives way to a slightly sweet bitter ending. Easy drinking and very light. It's a little sweet though."
"The drinkability is fine. But, for the abv, I would rather up the style and profile than stick to a pilsner"
"This one just worked for me. The citric flavors of the hops and the bready twang of the wheat and Pils malts combined with that crisp body to make this a flavorful and easy drinking affair. I think that the lemon and wheat in particular gave this a breezy summer feel that I enjoyed. I could see myself sipping on one of these on the beach. This is a worthy beer for a good cause. Pick one up if you see it."
"Drinkability is ok, not really a session beer and its not pils-y enough for me. I'm glad I tried it, I appreciate what Abita is doing here, both with the cause and the beer."
"I was born in La., so the combination of the brand and message really stikes a chord."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice strong than average Pilsener that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Poured into a Blue Moon glass there was nothing atypical looking about this pilsner. Bready nose, smooth mouthfeel but pretty light body. Nothing jumped out at me about this beer, but then again it was a bit old. I drank this for New Year's and when I purchased it, it was a dusty bottle. I don't regret it though, worth the charity, grab it while it's around."
"Overall - a worthy beer for a worthy cause"
"D) A decent brew. Not my preferred style but good nonetheless."
"d - good beer and definitely a great cause. not one of my favorite pilseners though."
"The pour results in a fluffy off-white head; the ale is a nice golden hue. Patchy head retention and good lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet malts and hop spiciness that tickles the nose. Dry straw. I pull berries from the aroma, and they seem a tad out of place but they're not unpleasant by any means. The carbonation on this beer is pretty low...at least lower than I'd want in a pils. The flavors are sweet corn and bitter, spicy hops. Not much complexity in the flavor. The beer was ok, but I saved the bottle for a while. Very nice art."
"this looked and smelled promising but wound up as ""good"" overall. Not worth selling your first edition new mutants comic for."
"Bought a bomber of this at the liquor store because of the backstory (donation to help clean up the gulf oil spill) and because it seemed like a good beer to enjoy that night. I feel that I made the right decision on both counts. Poured clear, straw golden with a short cap of white head. Aromas of lemon, pale malts and a light hoppiness. On the palate, crisp and drinkable, light bodied, like a pumped up pils, with more bready malt, a little honey and a hint of lemon."
"D: The drinkability is quite good, and the relatively high especially with a 7% ABVthat fails to show itsel. It's always good when the brewer masks the alcohol as excellent as Abita has done with this one."
"Not my style, but certainly something I would recommend to a macro drinker and maybe even buy for myself during the summer."
"Slightly hazed golden hue with a fully formed thick billowing white head. Fine speckled lacing left behind as the head dwindles down. Lemongrass, herbal qualities, very nice light biscuit malt presence...solid pils from Louisiana. Upfront citric, grassy, biscuit malts and a dry yeast finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied even carbonation going on. Drinkability all day effortless beer drinking experience."
"D: This is lighter-tasting than the 7% abv indicates, and is definitely the best offering I've experienced from Abita."
"It's light on the tongue with nice citrus notes, and not syrupy before the spike of the sizzling, drier hop finish. It's very drinkable. It's not revelatory, but a well above average pilsener."
"I would say this beer is yellow in color, but I guess straw-gold sounds better. With solid white head. Smell is subdued and quite pleasant full of flowery hop notes. There is a definite sweet hoppy bite at first sip, but overall the beer is light and refreshing (considering it's alcohol content). Very drinkable. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: nice refreshing beer that is very easy to drink. Definitely worth giving this one a try."
"I really enjoyed the SOS pilsner both for its overall drinkability and the warming sensation I started to feel after half the bottle (anything with 7% and higher ABV is perfect for getting those blood vessels closer to the surface of my skin), but I was especially happy to be able to support the Gulf restoration with this little act of drinking."
"Drinks easy, the ABV is well hidden. A bit more complexity would've helped the cause"
"Very good overall, but I have to ding it a few points for unnecessary sweetness. Neutral flavors work well for a pilsner beer, but keep it far removed from greatness."
"Drinkability is quite good, and the relatively high 7% ABV fails to show itself until late in the game, wherein it only appears (after an entire 22-ounce bottle) as a bit of airiness in the head, never showing itself on the palate. I'd swear this was nothing but a standard American-craft-made Pils, but a bit ""imperial"" it is; wonderfully executed and, quite possibly, one of the best offerings Abita has put into bottle. Subtle complexity is one of the hallmarks of a good pilsner, and Abita can certainly check that one off its list -- and in an ""imperial"" variant, at that."
"D-only reason I would buy again is because of the money they are giving to charity. I love a well made pilsner, but I feel the wheat gives it too soft of a flavor, way too nuetral tasting for me."
"Radiant yellow with a wisp of yeast. A quality, thick, fluffy head rests on top. Doughy malt, clean grassy hops, dry earthy grain aromas. Pilsener malts and green, spicy hops with an even sweetness. Drinks lighter than it is. In fact, it's surprisingly light overall. Clean, fairly smooth, medium-light bodied. Not bad, but not nearly as good as their 20th Anniversary."
"I would call this an extremely near miss, but a miss none-the-less."
"D - it goes down ok"
"S.O.S. is much better beer than Abita's other high-ABV offerings (Andygator and Abbey Ale). In fact, it's right up there with their best. Even though the shoreline will eventually be returned to normal, here's hoping ABC has the good sense to continue to brew this refreshing German-style pilsner."
"Pours a hazed golden yellow color and a thick soapy white head and tons of lacing. Smells floral from the tons of hops, hints of wheat. Tastes of wheat and tons of bitter hops balanced well with good malt flavor. Mouthfeel is very nice and medium bodied with heavy carbonation. Drinkability is very nice."
"A very nice German Pilsner from the folks at Abita bottled for a great cause. Go out and get one."
"Not for me. Although they NAILED APPEARANCE...ho hum."
"Pours a clear, straw color. One and one half inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight yeast, hint of citrus, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a German Pilsner. Mouth feel is smoth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, hops, yeast, and slight wheat. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, and blend."
"I bought this because I like to support a good cause. Nice gold color, big head, this is my first Abita beer. Smells like a lager for sure but the taste is thick and malty. Easy to drink but a little strong to be drinking more than one at time. Interesting and now I'd like to try Andygator."
"This isn't too far from BMC stuff. It has a bit more flavor and some nice spiciness in the nose and taste, but it still has that musky, stale malt aftertaste. For me, it's a huge hit on drinkability. Others may like it"
"D: Fairly easy to consume, though you wont necessarily be wowed over in the process. Worth a purchase if not just for the cause (.75 donated to clean up in the gulf)."
" ~ This beer advertises on the label that $.75 of the purchase price for each bottle goes toward the rescue and restoration of our shores. That alone should be enough for you to purchase a bottle or two of this brew. However, this beer offers more than a good conscience. It has great characteristic and is a fine beer. Seek this beer out and drink it. It is a very good beer."
"*Read the bottle post-review. Apparently, this is a weizen pils with no Saaz hops. Explains a lot."
"THIS IS NOT A PILSNER! Maybe it was made according to a pilsner formula or something, but upon tasting the finished product they should've realized the truth and called it something else."
"Overall, this beer should help Abita to raise plenty of donations for the Gulf. It has everything I love about German Pils...Clean malt character, tasty saaz hops, crisp mouthfeel, and great drinkability. Can't beat the price either(4.90 and bomber)."
"i was surprised to find this beer for sale here in Boise Idaho. i bought it about 3 weeks ago and I saw it on the shelf still last week."
"By the way, any pilsner weighing in at 7% or more is a double in my book."
"Overall, a well made beer, and worth trying."
"With that in mind, I have to say it is a pretty good beer for a good cause."
"D - Very high. I'm not a huge consumer of pilsner beers but this one goes down exceptionally well and above all, the proceeds go to a worthwhile cause which doesn't make the beer taste better, but definitely makes me feel better, along with it's 7% ABV. Well brewed in my opinion and definitely seek it out."
"While my impresson of this beer may be skewed to the favorable, as the selection of beers available in the Bourbon Street area is a bit monotonous, I have to think that the low reviews of the beer must be bad bottles, because of the three I had during my visit, all were consistently ""not-bad."" A welcome dose of hops, with a distinct wheat background character. Lively and reasonably smooth, it was the highlight of my NOLA beer-drinking experience."
"D - Great gimmick for Abita; I feel like I've really given back to the gulf community by buying this blasphemy of a beer. Maybe if Louisiana can suffer more calamity, Abita could find impetus for more special releases."
"I don't know that I've had a Pilsner made with wheat, or if I have never this pronounced. Traditionalist may balk, but it does work out."
"And the best part about this beer is the charitable aspect. I thorougly respect their initiative to help restore the coast from damage from the BP oil spill. Frankly they could have brewed a cheaper product and people still would have bought it for the causes, but instead they really made a decent quality Pilsner which I would be happy to drink most anytime - and plan to again."
"Not bad at all. I don't think that the wheat malt and pils malt seem to agree with each other here. A mixed bag of flavor."
"Slainte!"
"Label notes say this is a weizen pilsner. Don't think I've heard of the term. Anyway, this one is for a good cause and it's pretty well done and certainly very drinkable. Actually, it compares rather favorably to the excellent Lammsbrau Organic Pilsner that finished the session."
"SOS is a decent beer, especially if you like big, malty lagers."
"It's a shame this is only a special release and doesn't come in 12 oz bottles. I could see this being a good ""anytime"" beer."
"Drinkability is good. This is an interesting beer, rich tasting and creamy with a nice dollop of hops at the end."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a golden amber with a slightly off white head. Head was 1 finger, didn't last long, but left amounts of lacing on the top and a bit of clinging to the sides. Aroma was slightly hoppy and citrusy. A touch of both lemon and orange citrus. Taste was prominently hops, slightly piney towards the end. As it warmed up, citrus could also be tasted. Felt thin and watery in the mouth, not at all carbonated. Fairly easy to drink, could go down well during the warm months."
"D-becomes less complex but stays very refreshing"
"- Overall this is very well balanced, but not full of too many robust flavors. It is rather light, and masks its strength very well. Certainly one to drink again, and I bet is nice on tap. Nice that .75c of each bottle goes towards the environmental effort of the spill in the gulf."
"Verdict: At the end of the day, S.O.S. is a simple, but enjoyable brew that should be palatable for craft newbies and veterans alike (perfect given its role). At first, I wasn't quite convinced, but by the end of the bottle I was ready for another."
"D - This is a very good Pils and it doesn't hurt that it goes to a good cause."
"This is not nearly as aggressively hoppy as it could be; with the Pilsner moniker on the label I expected a more hop leaning beer. This beer has an ample malt backbone, and the subtler hop character makes this more of a hoppy Heller-bock to me. It is actually a bit simplistic in both the hop and grain department in the end though. Still this is not bad and worth a try and the cause is certainly a good thing."
"Happy to help send a few pennies LA's way via a tasty beer. Well done, Abita."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a0 crisp amount of carbonation."
"If Abita cranked out something like this regularly in six pack availability I'd be happy to have it around regularly. A good pilsner is always welcome in my fridge and this is a good pilsner."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This is a pretty pilsner. Nice golden wheat color with a ample, frothy white head that leaves soapy lacing down the sides of the glass. Honestly, this is a top notch pilsner in terms of appearance. Quite a looker. Taking a big whiff right after pouring it gives a impression of sweet fruits, ripe pears and sweet Fuji apples. Just a bit of sweet caramel and yeasty bread. Just a hint of spice/grass from the hops but nothing over powering. The flavor is just a little off. There is a generic sweetness that just a bit off putting. Almost a cream corn, minus the corn. Still get over ripe pears with just a little bit of bread. Slight grassy hops come through at the very tail. Honestly, with most pilsners, I just really want them to be clean and crisp, and this throwing a 18 instead of a bullseye. Still a good score but not quite what you needed. The mouthfeel is honestly the one thing that really irks me. It just finished to sweet and full. I want lighter styles to finished dry like sandpaper. This just misses the dart board. I see what they did here and really commend Abita for it. Really they made a beer that a lot of people will like and buy, and for that I'll buy more."
"Not mind-blowing, but definitely pleasing and would make for an excellent session. Finished the bottle easily, quite satisfied."
"The palate is surprisingly muted. I think the Florida heat wasn't particularly kind to this beer, there's a mild hop character up front with a blend of orange, lemon peel and earth. This is actually pretty delicate, I'm reminded of the complexity of orange blossom honey (minus the sweetness, obviously). The grain character is rather rustic here, there's a blend of wheat and raw pilsner-like character here. A little sweetness is present in the mid-palate, but the finish does dry up, leaving a rather excellent and delicate hop character. A little earth, a little orange peel (curacao?) and a little sweetness are all rather expertly in balance here. The use of the wheat malt has lent a little heft to the palate. Carbonation is light, enhancing the softness that the dextrinous wheat character that's present. A wisp of alcohol appears on occasion, but all told, this is a pretty solid beer. I'd drink this again."
"D: Gets better with each sip, but nothing really unique. Still a step above a standard pilsener, especially at its 7.00% ABV."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. Not a huge fan of pilsners but this one was quite enjoyable, and the fact it is for a good cause makes it taste that much better. Thanks again to optimator13 for this beer!"
"Very nicely done beer."
"Found this at Brix in Omaha. Great looking painted bomber. Pilsners aren't usually my thing but I figured that, considering the cause, I could give this one a go. Hats off to Abita, who came up with this idea. This is a 22 ounce bomber. I'm pouring it into a big ass pilsner glass. Pours with a two inch huge, billowing, frothy head. The head leaves behind some serious lacing. Gigantic bubbles and foam from this one. Likewise carbonation is huge, with fizz seemingly going on for days. Pours cloudy, which isn't surprising considering this is an unfiltered beer. Color is a bright gold, brilliant like the sun. Aroma is pretty hefty, especially for a pilsner, with cereal notes and lemongrass in the nose. Pretty solid amount of bitterness in this one - it's pleasant though. Lively mouthfeel with a high amount of pleasant carbonation and a pretty slick mouthfeel. Taste is spot on. Light malt starts, before giving way to grassy and fruity hop character. Bitterness teases the palate before giving way to a sweet honey finish. The biscuity malt sweetness really helps to hide the 7% ABV, which I can't seem to really find. Really crisp and refreshing take on the pilsner style. Kudos to Abita for supporting a good cause by putting together a great beer."
"This is a decent brew for a great cause. It would make a good session beer that also has plenty of flavor. I would rate it 5 stars, but that would only be for it's cause."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a pillowy pure white head that dissipated into a solid cap. The head left a sheet of webby lacing all around the glass. The aroma is of grassy/spicy hops, perhaps some citrus. Nice pleasant aroma. The taste is of a light malt, slightly fruity with a grassy and limey hop flavor, not dry like most pils. Its different but does take on a pilsner character. The feel is light with tingly carbonation, not very crisp but easily drinkable and refreshing. This is a very solid beer, nice hop flavor. I would drink it again."
"The body was light but well-rounded and smooth. Drinkability was pretty good, I could see having a couple of these at a sitting. Overall, a nice little brew that Abita should perhaps consider producing on a yearly, if not even year-round, basis."
"When I saw this one come into the store I was happy to pick one up since some proceeds were going to a good cause. Pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color with a large white head that fell slowly leaving behind a patchwork of lace. Aroma is very simple and straightforward. Mostly pale grains in the nose, a touch of wheat in there which gives it a slight twang, and herbal, grassy hops. Taste is very similar. I'm picking up on lot of citrusy hop notes but it's not bitter in anyway. There's some orange, lemon, and a touch of grass, but overall the hops are very well balanced with the pale malts that make this beer very drinkable and enjoyable for such a high ABV. Body is medium, but could use a touch more carbonation to add soome crispness. Overall, a good beer for a very worthy cause."
"Drinkability - This is hands down the best beer I've had from Abita and one of the best American-made German pils right behind Prima and Kaiser and that amazing example I had from the obscure Baron Brewing. I am forever down on supposed big or imperial pils because the pils is meant to be light and show an ease of drinking, but this one is both big yet true to the spirit of the style. I'm not often blown away by a beer these days (closing in on 2,000 reviews in the last 7 years) but this one knocked my socks off. Well done Abita!"
"D- A simple but good beer that opens up quite a bit as it warms. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice."
"D: if i wasnt distracted by the meal it would be gone faster. also it goes to a good cause."
"Abita is usually miss for me, but this is surprisingly good. Worth a buy, especially since this beer is for a good cause."
"overall a very solid beer. not the biggest fan of big pilsners but the hops help this one to work. would not mind having this one again at all."
"Taste is very mellow, well balanced, malty and hoppy with a slight alcohol bite that's cool since it's ""Imperial"". Very creamy and rich lots caramel and sweet flavors. Very good beer!"
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this one, & I haven't had a lot of pilsners that really lifted my luggage, but I'm impressed. Well done without being overdone. I think I'll finish the bomber."
"Drinkability -- For charity's sake, I'm going to give this a charitable bump in the drinkability section. Not bad by any stretch, but I wasn't thrilled, either."
"A pretty darn solid pilsner all around that I could down at least a couple of bottles of (if I were in the mood). Also, a big nod to the charitable aspect of this beer."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, it was a light and easy drinking beer. It had some decent grain/malt flavors to it but wasn't anything special overall. An easy drinker on a hot day though."
"The hops are nice and refreshing, a little pineapple juice and grassy aroma and flavor. But they're not enough to save this beer from being average."
"M- Slick finish to it. Kind of syrupy in the finish. A bit odd in this regard."
"A very nice pils, and the highest abv pils I've had the pleasure of trying up to this point."
"D- Top-notch for the style, great flavor going on, but hard to describe the taste. Try it if you can find it."
"this is a nice flavorful pilsner. drinks easy and never gets dull nor does it ever become overpowering. a bit high of an ABV or i would be chugging this."
"D - This seemed like a nice idea that just didn't quite pan out for me. Not so bad I wanted to dump it, but at the same time I won't go for it again... Anyways, I hope my 75 cents can do some good..."
"d - A very easy to drink, decent pilsener. Some nice wheat and citrus. Would try again."
"Pours a golden body with great carbonation that leads to a small head with lace patches along w/ minor pils malt smell with an edge of sweet malt and some fruit-like hops. An easy to drink pils w/ pils malt giving off some slight fruit flavors and there is a touch of wheat twang that gives off a spicy and citric backbite. Balances w/ other fruit flavors and there is some minor sweetness. A beer that is a nice change of pace but just doesn't completely click."
"Interesting beer and a charity beer for the Louisiana oil spill. No need to stock up on this one."
"D: This was a pretty good pilsner that was bigger in hops and body than most other beers in its class. It hid the alcohol well also, so it was pretty easy to drink. Not delicious, but definitely enjoyable."
"D- Overall, a pretty decent beer for an excellent cause. Worth a shot."
"Support this cause! As with Restoration Ale, kudos are due to Abita for again brewing something meaningful. First an ale to help NOLA recover from the negligence of the Army Corps of Engineers and now a lager to save the region from the greed of BP."
"This bottle caught my eye in the store with its nice design. 1 pint 6fl oz. beer. Beer pours with a nice 1 finger head. Appearance is a cloudy version of your standard macro lager color. Although it looks like your typical lager, the smell was a nice surprise. Definitely some hops present. The taste was really crisp and flavorful. I really enjoyed this beer. Easy to drink and supporting a good cause. I would buy this beer again."
"Notes: The cause alone might be worth promoting the brew, but the beer is pretty decent. Maybe to reach a broader public doing a quality and self-contained pilsner is a good move, and while not memorable it is pleasing and nice to push around."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer, and one that I wouldn't mind at all picking up again to ""help the cause"". Even though the water seems to a bit mineral-laden in the nose, it is only moderately noticeable in the flavor. The malt and hop profiles are appropriate for the style. It is a bit big and meaty for the style, but this isn't a problem. It is still a well presented beer."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Nothing special. Try it to support the Gulf clean up, but otherwise, not worth your taste buds."
"Not as soft as most pilsners--the hop is harsher and more bitter with strong grapefruit notes. Round mouthfeel as if this were an ale. The carbonation is lighter. The malt flavors are secondary. The aftertaste has a mild sourness, but it's predominately bitter."
"If there's one new style of beer I think is either a mistake or must be very tough to pull off, it's imperial pilsners. Interesting wine-like smell to this one, which is promising. The pilsner and wheat malts work pretty well together here. Lingering hop bitterness. Doesn't seem like 7%. Overall, not bad, and makes me rethink this style a bit. Cheers to Abita for doing this charitable beer."
"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a clear light to medium golden with a thick fluffy white head that settled very very slowly leaving globs of broken lace behind.A great mix of yeasty fruitiness,and spicy hop in the nose,a tinge of iron from the malt comes in to play as well,just a great mix.Lightly toasted wheat malt flavors along with some sharpness from the healthy dose of hops,light caramel sweetness as well.Airy mouthfeel makes it glide down easy,wow this is a great brew!Easily the best thing I have had from Abita,a brewery I dont go to often.A great cause and a great beer!...In my opinion."
"Overall, S.O.S is a real surprise from Abita, a quite solid, boozy-wheaty pils that drinks well and donates 75 cents to the Gulf Restoration for each bottle sold. I can dig it."
"D - An excellent pils. Don't notice the 7% ABV at all."
"Overall, eh, I think I've said enough on this one. If you like pilsners, why not sure, give it a try. Amazing designs/artwork on the bottle and it was for a good cause so I'm still glad I bought this."
"Dynamic this is not. But it's agreeable, generally tasty (if plain), and charitable. Can't root against it."
"The feel of this beer has a nice light body and really has a well managed feel that goes down well bur does not have too much or a disagreeable feel."
"Had this from a 22oz bottle into a pilsner glass. The carbonation is high. Tight white head with a pale straw color; slightly hazy. The aroma is grassy with crisp notes of saaz hops. The taste, I had this with a true southern pulled pork meal of collards, and black beans, is big for a pilsner. The taste holds up against big fatty foods. It would probably do well with some cheeses or really spicy fish dishes. The body is medium and the hops do coat the tongue in the after taste. I highly recommend this as a beer and to help the locals anyway possible!"
"Gotta love a bomber of tasty quality beer for $3.99. (@DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY) Pours hazed medium golden amber, under a tiny bubble off white head, that leaves respectable fine lacing. Not bad looking stuff. Fruity and grassy nose. Enjoyable enough pilsner, but it lacks the snap and crispness of the higher rated brews of the style. More grassyness, more pleasant lager sensibilities. Smooth in the mouth from start to moderately long finish. Decent beer for a good cause. Just how do they make any $ putting out a $3.99 (!) bomber and why cant other brewers do the same with at least some of their brews? $3.99 ?!?"
"D: Tasty, smooth and refreshing. Not my favorite style, but I think this is a fine version of it, and I think it gets bonus points for being helping the environment."
"Taste-Wheat, biscuit,saltine; some background citrus notes, then a nice hop bite that lingers to the finish. An interesting medley of flavors that keep you wanting anothother sip. Seemingly light-bodied for the ABV, and pretty refreshing as well. An interesting brew. And hey! It's for a good cause!"
"M + D: Medium bodied, with a crisp and snappy carbonation that complements both the aroma and the flavour nicely. Some of the soft peppery notes of the alcohol work nicely with the spiciness in the hops, and a modest warming follows it all down. I'd put it down as a 'refreshing sipper,' and it's certainly a beer I think I will be revisiting a few more times while it is available."
"Actually a really nice drink that would go well with lots of food profiles. A bit of a ""refined"" and ""reserved"" saison character for lack of a better description. Very drinkable."
"Overall, a good beer for the price. I wouldn't go running back to it time and again, but if I were going to the beach I would take this one along. It was drinkable because the flavors were very mellow. Worth a try."
"Beer is medium bodied and light in character. Bright in the mouth and slightly bitter at the end. It was a good lager overall and I would have it again."
"I'm not sure I've had a semi-charitable beer before, so I'm not sure what to expect here. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a thick wad of white froth, which almost etches the glass as it dies away. The nose comprises clean florals, very light citrus, a hint of coriander, and a soft grainy quality. The taste is just as clean and simple, though a bit more wheat finds its way on the 'buds. The body is quite light, with a light carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a very nice, if somewhat ordinary, pils, but very easy-going and extremely drinkable."
"i hope it sells enough to do some good for the gulf."
"very drinkable beer with more flavor than many pilseners. could really get in trouble with 2-3 pints of this because the 7% abv hides so well. pretty cool that I could enjoy the beer and donate 75 cents towards the gulf relief effort at the same time."
"22oz bomber into a Hopus glass pours a crisp straw yellow with a decent frothy off white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight sweet pale malts. The taste is a nice amount of sweet malts against a sturdy citrus hop backbone that leaves a nice subtly bitter citrus finish. The beer is medium bodied with decent smoothing carbonation. This is certainly a beer worth trying, especially a percentage of the proceeds going to such a good cause!"
"Drinkability: Sure, it's a little high on the alcohol, but, thankfully, it doesn't stray too terribly far towards unrefreshing, cloying territories. Overall, a good beer for a good cause. You know, it's nice to occasionally use my evident alcoholism for the forces of GOOD."
"M/D - Full body and ends a bit more sticky than most in the style, not really sweet but there is obviously a little more residual sugar in there. The only thing I can fault them for is that it's out of the style guidelines but it doesn't bother me besides the lack of drinkability."
"Hmm, a ""weizen pils", according to the back. Poured into a large chalice, it looks pretty pils-like, with a bright, clear gold color and a modest, though quickly fading head. The aroma is disappointingly faint, with but a hint of malt. Bland, undistinguished flavor, like much of the Abita line-up. Generic malt, with (very) light hops. There's a hint of harsh fusels at the end that drop it from a 3.5 to a 3 for me."
"This is a solid offering all and all. A hair above average for an american pilsner and why not enjoy when it's for a good cause?"
"The flavor starts out a bit thin, but inviting, with soft notes of tropical fruit (papaya, pear, pineapple) from the yeast balanced nicely with a flash of booze and grainy-sweet malts. Hops get slightly lost in the mix, although they may boost the fruitiness a bit. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a lush carbonation level makes the finish both creamy and zesty at the same time. Highly quaffable despite the bolstered alcohol level. S.O.S. is a solid release from Abita, one of their better efforts as of late. Not exactly the shining example of the German Pilsener style, but I can dig their take on it."
"D-This beer being 7%abv is very drinkable. And I highly recommend you give the good cause as well. This beer seems to be going fast so go get you some my fellow beer geeks. And Cheers!"
"Nothing spectacular, but I'm pleasantly surprised with this wheat imperial pilsener hybrid. Well done and for a good cause."
"It's obvious that Abita isn't only about making a half-hearted attempt just for the support of a good cause; rather the beer has to be sturdy and of the quality that is expected for proper support of the Gulf Shore clean up efforts. It's a delicious beer worthy of often consumption with or without the proceeds to charity."
"Interesting brew, soft yet assertive hop flavor and bitterness with an earthy side as well as a bright one. Light malts and wheat make for a different flavor profile, the wheat adding a unique tangy presence. ABV is very well hidden considering the light malt bill. Mouthfeel is nice with a pleasing softness and is pretty solidly medium bodied. Abita has brewed some good pilsners in the past and this one is right up there with the best of 'em. I'll gladly buy another one of these before they go away."
"D: I could easily drink a lot of this beer, but most likely will not. I feel like I have fulfilled my obligation. That doesn't mean it's bad, but Pilsners are not my favorite style."
"Atmosphere is really great here. Full, pristine, towering appearance; and a really full featured nose where the different components just scream out to be noticed, but not to stand out over it's neighbor. Great compliments. Flavor is much like it smells. Great components, well balanced, full flavored. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Pours a clear straw yellow - not inspiring, but typical of a pilsner, and I do admit to some prejudice in favor of darker beers. At least the white head is fairly thick and fluffy. Aroma is strong, crisp, malty and more than a bit fruity, mainly banana plus a little apple and a little pear. Flavor is crisp and malty, about average for a pils, with some fruity undertone. Texture is quite fizzy and lively, leaving a nice malty and somewhat fruity finish. A toast to all those helping restore the Gulf!"
"D- Very tasty. Not the greatest German Pilsner I've ever had, but it's a really tasty brew."
"The beer pours a clear gold color with a white head. The aroma is basic pilsener with some pilsener malt and lemon notes. The flavor is a mix of malt and grassy hops with quite a bit of sweetness. This is maybe a little sweeter than your traditional pilsener, but other than that it is pretty good. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Easily the best beer I have tried from Abita."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable overall and the alcohol seems just about nonexistent. I'll probably pick up a few more bottles while they're around."
"D: so so, I usually prefer drier beers with more hop aroma, but it's pretty good. Its good enough I will be drinking plenty to help the coast here so maybe when BP bails, we can actually clean up their mess over the next decade."
"The beer is medium-bodied with a grainy, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Ultimately very drinkable. I'd recommend this beer to friends, for sure."
"Thank you Abita."
"RJT"
"Great cause and equally tasty beer. I'm glad a picked a few up, and I will continue to as often as possible."
"Overall: An easy drinking pilsner with a great cause but nothing mind blowing here. Another lackluster brew from Abita. They always seem to get away with mediocrity and it has served them well. 75 cents per bottle is being donated to help from the oil spill which is great. I think the design of the bottle is incredible. More incredible than the product inside the bottle."
