Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a small foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, toasted biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, toasted biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, toasted biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and solid robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid Pilsener, obviously showing signs of age. Well balanced pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink despite lacking carbonation. It was still pretty enjoyable as it stood.","superspak","Oct 16, 2014"

APPEARANCE: cloudy, hazy; almost appears unfiltered and murky golden; thick white head recedes swiftly; zero lacing as well... AROMA: fragrant hops suggest lilac and heavy bubblegum; a bit of honey too... PALATE: smooth, mellow, and slightly fizzy at the teeth; extremely drinkable and thirst-quenching...TASTE: rather subdued, suppressed lemon-grass spritz; some doughy malts arrive late--not as clear in its profile as expected... OVERALL: a surprisingly soft, unsubstantially flavored pilsner from a place I expect pilsners to fall like leaves; not sure the organic element has much to do with the look or taste, but the smoothness offsets the weak profile slightly...not sure what to make of this one in the end, except that its end was rather swift, so something did its job.","dacrza1","May 06, 2014"

Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a light, dry taste on the tongue as well as a light graininess, perhaps due to being unflitered. There were hops present, but not in the in-your-face way that the Czech-style Pilsners can be with their Saaz hops.

Medium-bodied, the carbonation is heavy like it's just a bunch of water balloons in the mouth, no real lift or energy from it. Spicier hops here but still devolves into bready notes of rye, sourdough and, at times, pumpernickel.

Lightly malty on the palate, with some sweet tones that strike a wonderful balance with the floral, grassy, spicy, perfumy, almost citric hops that impart a medium bitterness.

There are also some floral hop aromas. There is even more of that sour graininess in the mouth, and it overwhelms the hop crispness a good bit. The sour dies off a bit on the finish and there is a bit of breadiness that appears. Not great, but drinkable. The sour graininess cuts into the real pleasures of a nice German Pilsner.

Pours a murky, hefeweizen-like gold - in fact, the only thing that visually distinguishes this from a hefeweizen is the lack of any head or lacing whatsoever. Smell is unmistakably pilsener - clean with some citrus and floral tones from the noble hops complemented malt graininess, nothing too exciting but pleasant nonetheless. Taste is obviously similar, although this is a rather raw example of the style - there is some roughness in the finish that makes this beer less quaffable then it should be. Mouthfeel is fine, with the correct amount of carbonation contributing to an appropriate crispness. However, the unpolished finish deters overall drinkability. I would not choose this over other accomplished examples of the style such as Trumer, Spaten, or Paulaner.","dfitch81","Dec 05, 2008"

I do believe this is my first time ever trying an ""unfiltered"" Pilsner. I have never seen that before. Pinkus Ur-Pils pours out a slightly cloudy light-honey colour with hints of lemonade-yellow. The head is initially very large and healthy, styrofoam-white and billowy, with an ice-cream consistency. Good lace. As attractive as a pils can be. By the end is looks like a hefe in the glass. Nice. Very light fruitiness smelling above the glass, almost lime-like. In closer is some excellent creamy-sweet malting, adding some faint vanilla and grains. Grassy continental hops are here in good quanity, but the beer smells very sweet, almost sugary at times, with plenty of orange-peel and lemon notes. After pouring again for some more head, the aroma is vaguely spicy and full of sourish malting. Not overwhelming in complexity, just very appetising. The taste is very light, with some citrus salinity and bready malting, with only a little finishing dryness and balanced grassy hops on the follow through. Lots of lemon in the taste, and fairly watery malting altogether. The taste is far too sweet and un-hopped for a good Pilsner. Definitely uncomplex, really nothing more to describe. Very smooth mouthfeel, and very low in carbonation. Light bodied. Extremely drinkable too, just not interesting enough to register more than a blip on my Pilsner-scale.","Cwrw","May 29, 2006"

Light watery flavour up front, the flavour really never does pick up, you get traces of bready malt, some spice, and some very faint floral hops, but not really in one cohesive package. It truly does taste like it's been watered down in general. The mouthfeel as well, no surprise, is very light bodied and watery, with only a quick rip of carbonation across the tongue on the finish, which does not positively contribute to the overall experience.

I was a bit surprised that I had not yet reviewed the Pinkus Ur Pils since I've had it so many times before. I pick this up regularly grocery shopping at Wegmans. The unfiltered pils pours a hazy light yellow gold. Head is substantial upon initial pour. An enduring layer of foam is left behind. Faint fruit aromas are detected, some pear and green apple. Flavor is rather subtle light grain, imparting a sourdough bread essence. Hops are leafy, grassy and biting leaving a welcome lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and with crisp carbonation. Good drinkability and a solid brew.","John","Nov 10, 2004"
3.6,-6,3,3,4,3,4,"Yellow. Classic German Pilsner aroma, with pils malt, light fruits, clove, honey, herbal, spicy and grassy hops. A very pleasant tasting Pils, especially up front and on the mid-palate. Grainy, fruity malty texture. Notes of clove, light fruits, bananas, pears and honey. The hops are subtle, which is why I liked it, grassy and herbal. The onlu complaint is the poor finish. Nontheless, this is an impressive Pilsner.","Crosling","Nov 10, 2004"
3.68,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is easily consumable beer. It is also interesting enough to warrant more tastings.","smcolw","Oct 01, 2004"
4.47,16.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I like this. Am wondering if it's more along the lines of a KellerBier, as it is unfiltered. Lovely light tangerine in my pilsner glass, I received a lovely two inch snow white head after pouring. It's gone now, with just a thin layer on top of the brew. I really like the aroma on this one, it's decidedly spicey and perfumey, and a bit bready as well. Mouthfeel wise is medium+, good carbonation, spot on, enough, but not too much. Tastewise, you get your money's worth...the malt is a hanging in the back, so you experience an initial perfumey note (again), with some citrusy notes in the finish. Unique and Tasty, would love to get on draft (if possible).","PatandDavid","Aug 18, 2004"
3.53,-7.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"An odd mustyness throws it off style, kind of a weird beer. More of a kellerbier maybe?","mschofield","Aug 11, 2004"
4.27,11.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer is cloudy gold in color topped by a respectable creamy white head. Smells very grainy with perhaps some mild fruity aromas. A sweet malt flavor to start, masterfully balanced by bitter (but not too bitter) hops. A crisp refreshing finish. Overall this is a highly drinkable pilsner that really stands out from the rest.","Godspeed","Aug 10, 2004"
4.89,27.7,4,5,5,4.5,5,"The taste is perfectly sweet and musty. An excellent sharp bitterness melds into a sweet, but dry graininess. Theres a solid body of pungent and grainy malt. This is very close to my perfect pilsner. Sharp with the fresh grains accented, which all pilsners really should have. A benchmark beer. Excellent.","pezoids","Jul 15, 2004"
4.05,5.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a lot of floaties and a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent with a musty, dry aroma. It has a bit of lemon zest. The taste is good. It has a smooth, bitter flavor with a malty hop aftertaste. It is a dry, musty brew with good mouthfeel. It is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. This is a fine German Pilsner. It has excellent flavor and mouthfeel; a good drinker.","WesWes","Jul 11, 2004"

4.07,6.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The taste is excellent for a pilsner, but this isn't your ordinary pils. Tart, citrusy lemon is smooth on the palate and matches very well with the sweet pilsner malt backbone. Apple and pear notes appear early on, and lend an amazing complexity to this ""organic"" pils. Finish is crisp and very clean. I love this offering, and plan to stock up several of these at my next opportunity.","merlin48","Jun 07, 2004"
3.63,-5.2,3.5,3,4,3,4,"I saw this interesting beer and had to try it. An organic, unfiltered Pilsner? . Pours a hazy gold, which is exactly what I expected. Has the same Plisner flavor, but the bitterness is slighty muted. Nice flavor, and comes in a brown bottle, which is nice considering the high skunk factor in green bottle, imported pilsners. Overall, a nice beer. Highly drinkable. I reccomend this.","WMBierguy","Apr 20, 2004"
3.85,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Trying to remember if I've ever had an unfiltered Pilsener before. Poured a hazy gold, a bit brighter and less hazy than a hefeweizen, but not far off. The beer was a bit on the acidic side, but this did not translate into any particular tartness. Yeasty flavors - clove in particular, much like those found in a hefeweizen. Unusual, and interesting. For some reason, the beer did not totally engage me, but it was certainly worth the try.","Brent","Mar 29, 2004"
3.7,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy yellow gold with a moderate, pure white head that settles quickly leaving a thin lace. Smells are grainy light malt, with a descernable bready yeast, and acidic hops. Taste is crisp, clean, and refreshing. Low level acidic flavors over an unfiltered, grainy malt, which quickly gives way to pure acidic hop. Not a very complex taster, but a very nice session brew, if you atre in the mood for an acidic pils. canbonation is quite perfect, not overbearing, but bubbly, refreshing and complementary to the general feel of the beer.","gnaussea","Mar 23, 2004"
4.47,16.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Real drinkable brew, practically a meal in a bottle.","Zorro","Mar 23, 2004"
3.82,-0.3,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste--pretty good, and pretty complex. Salty and slightly metalic notes give way to sweet Munich malts, which are quickly overcome by a fine selection of hops in the finish. Interesting yeast notes (fruity, mushroomy) provide counterpoint.","sparkydoyle","Feb 24, 2004"
3.25,-15.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Taste is OK. Not as crisp as I would expect a pilsener, a bit more creamy and rounded. Not very crisp and not much hop profile here. A fruity sourness with some very light hops in the finish. Not bad but nothing that stands out to my taste. Decent drinker but not one I'll seek out again.","ViveLaChouffe","Feb 22, 2004"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"My sample had LOTS of yeast sediment, rarely do I leave beer in the bottle, I did on this occasion and I left beer in the glass there was a lot of yeast (image a chronic case of dandruff)!","bditty187","Aug 21, 2003"
4.09,6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This Organic Pils marches to a beat of a different brewer. It pours a dull gold color with a nice sturdy white head and plenty of lace. An aroma of fresh bread, malt, hops and citrus lasts. There's more body than one normally associates with the Pils style. The hops are a bit spicier and less metallic than most Pils. A light herbal flavor mingles with a hint of lime and a bit of alcohol. If I were blindfolded I would have guessed someone had tried to blend a Hefe-weizen with an Alt. Hmmm!","BeerResearcher","Aug 18, 2003"
4.05,5.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Very different...I just finished a Scrimshaw Pilsener and then sampled this offering. It seemed much more like a wheat offering than a Pilsener. Head was nice and well-formed. Clinged to the side of glass a bit. Smell was slightly hoppy and fruity...Taste was light, but full bodied, leaving a pleasant slight tart aftertaste. Drinkability was very good, going down smooth with a nice aftertaste. I wasn't expecting the results I found...it wasn't as ""pilsener"" tasting as I expected. It was much more rounded like some of the ales I have sampled.","edchicma","Aug 02, 2003"
3,-21.7,3,3,3,3,3,"This brew poured a medium white head of finely sized bubbles that left very little lacing as it receded. It had a mild aroma of hops and malt and a wheat yellow cloudy body with yeast floating in it. It has a mild initial bite that smoothens in the finish. Its flavor was a bit fizzy and hoppy.","TheDM","Jul 16, 2003"
3.23,-15.7,3.5,3,3,3,4,"500 ml bottle. Poured a cloudy straw yellow, with a fairly decent head that quickly faded. Aroma is slightly malty, and of fresh cut hay. Taste is very mellow, low carbonation, and just plain mild. I kept waiting for more that just isn't there. Not a bad beer, I could drink this as a session beer, but I prefer something with a little more body to it.","Indybeer","Jul 10, 2003"
3.05,-20.4,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"First of all, I was not too impressed with this Pilsener. I just could not quite acquire a taste for this one. It poured a white creamy head. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer. The body was cloudy and the hue was yellow. The yeast was visible in my glass. It had a sweet aroma to it.","hotstuff","Jul 05, 2003"
4.35,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I totally expected this to be a dud--all dusty, as it was, sitting sideways on the proprietor's shelf next to the hot fridge exhaust. But I'll be darned, this is one of the best damn pilseners I've ever eaten! Poured huge and foamy, with a Monsters-of-Rock head that sat up like stiff egg whites. The aroma was so lubricious and slippery with protien that I almost suspected the suspect Isinglass fish guts to be in there. But the body reveals otherwise. Nice hoppy punch in the nose, with that dark, musty, bottom-of-the-barrel, English-IPA sort of vibe, but more in line with the spirit of the TRULY HEAVENLY malt body that this beer posesses. Scrumptious as all get-out!","DarthMalt","Jun 18, 2003"
4.07,6.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Opaque dark gold with a nice and bright head of 1/4 inch of consistant-sized small bubbles. Laces in sheets in a Pilsner glass. Slightly ""dusty"" and nutty aromas, sense of late summer harvests. Grassy and toasty malts, very flavorful in combination and yet restrained overall. Light body is well matched by a lack of overcarbonation. Finishes crisply but without a notable hop assertion.Minimal to no aftertaste. This is the last of the Pinkus selection at my store, I must say that I'm impressed by each as unique in their style while still conforming to overall style characteristics.","ADR","May 22, 2003"
3.83,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Another great product from Pinkus! My first actual unfiltered pils and looks similar to their weizen but a little less cloudy. Nice big white foamy head though like the weizen has. I'm not that big on Pils but I must say this is a good one. Great clean crisp flavorful beer. Classic Pils malts and only slight bitterness. I'm surprised this isn't rated higher, it's a quality brew.","BierReise","May 06, 2003"
3.63,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured nicely with orange/yellow hue,with pretty good rocky head.Nice balanced smell with a nice crisp hop tone,also a little bread-like.I like the maltiness of this pilsner some overhop for the style but not this one.The hop came through but it was not to promident.Was pretty drinkable,I have had better but this wasnt bad at all.","oberon","Feb 26, 2003"
3.95,3.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Cloudy golden color with a pure white head that retained decently. Lacing was spotty at best. Grainy, bready, malty taste that was nice and smooth. Easy to have a few of these, very refreshing as a this genre should be. One of the better beers of this style that I have had.","Mark","Feb 08, 2003"
4.35,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"the malts are arranged beautifully with a hop balance that just makes this beer a great brew. it has light carbonation, enough to make it crisp. it is very smooth with a medium to light body. the drinkability is right up there with the best of 'em. this is a fine pils, that is a must try for any beer drinker.","ElGuapo","Jan 12, 2003"
4.02,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The pour is a somewhat obscure golden yellow to amber color; the head is portly in size, frothy in its texture, with the lace quite thick and sticky sheets to cling to the sides of the glass. The light musk or musty tone noticed in this beer as with most organic beers, not unpleasant and sometimes just barely discernable, you really need to hunt them down, malt and crisp, fresh and clean to the palate. Start malt and sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish crisply acidic, passably hopped with a very dry lingering aftertaste and a pleasant enough beer, worth the sample in my humble opinion.","Gusler","Dec 27, 2002"
3.38,-11.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Different appearance for a pilsner - hazy yellow, relatively light bodied and medium head with good carbonation. Not as hoppy as I expected but malts to start with a slightly hoppy finish. Better as a summer beer.","jdhilt","Dec 07, 2002"
4.41,15.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy yellow with a fine, frosty head that crawls up the glass with authority. The nose is quite ripe with sugary, candied, dried fruit, gum drops and Haribo candy. There is a faint whiff of alfalfa sprouts too. Rich, full texture is hewn into shape by bitter hops. Big, chewy, rustic flavor featuring notes of lemon, watercress and chervil. Seriously unique Pils.","putnam","Oct 11, 2002"
4.47,16.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Quite hazy (bottle conditioned), golden with a creamy 1/4"" head that holds excellently and leaves some good lace. The aroma is of a sweetly floral and grassy hop that's lightly backed by malt. Excellent. The body is medium with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that gently caresses the tongue and becomes quite creamy as it warms in the mouth. The flavor starts with a great blend of rich, sweet malt and a unique floral hop flavor that's at least partially from Hallertauer. The sweet malt decreases as it crosses the palate, revealing some more grassy hop flavors and some bitterness. It finishes dry and fairly short with some lingering hop flavor and light bitterness as would be expected of a good pilsener. Very well balanced, allowing the malt and hop flavors to remain clear throughout while also giving an enjoyable bitter bite at the start, and maintaining enough bitterness to keep it dry and refreshing. Extremely well done, however, I must note that it's important to obtain a fresh sample. This is not a huge seller in the U.S., and I've had many old & damaged bottles before I came across this fresh one. I should also note that all Merchant Du Vin products are conspicuosly absent of any dating. (Sorry Charlie, but you know it's true).","NeroFiddled","Oct 07, 2002"
3.71,-3.1,2.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Hazy yellow in hue even before the yeast sediment is poured.  The billowy, white, attractive persistent head leaves a good lace.  Sweet honey and cracker notes in aroma, followed by a pleasantly herbal noble hop nose.  Sharp, prickly carbonation and hop bitterness hits the palette at first, but fades quickly leaving bready notes and fairly high malt sweetness for style. Slightly musty, hay - like flavors are perceptible as well. Hop flavor is green and herbal.  The finish is just a touch bitter, but honey - like sweetness lingers long after the sip.  This is an odd pilsner but an interesting beer... malt sweetness is too dominant.  It's definitely a beer worth trying, however.","marc77","Jun 08, 2002"
4.29,12,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: Very interesting with raw complexities ... packed with flavour and could be paired with numerous types of foods, Pan-Asian worked best.","Jason","Apr 16, 2002"
