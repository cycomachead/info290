"Poured into pint glass from bottle. Aggressive pour shows two fingers eggshell froth, with fair retention and some spotty lacing. Clear and light straw in color. Light, yet very metallic aromas. Very little complexity. Tastes somewhat skunky, not really picking up much in terms of noble hops. Quite base. Mouthfeel is watery, with light carbonation and a metallic finish, much like sucking on a penny. I was quite disappointed with this beer. I thought it was from Germany--nope, St. Louis. This does not taste much at all like a standard pilsner. I'm willing to bet the version made in Germany tastes quite different, and I wish I could differentiate it on BA from the American brewery. The only one listed (that I can find) is German, and this is definitely not. So are reviewers in Germany rating a completely different beer? If anyone knows, please message me--I'm confused. Bought on sale for less than $1/bottle. Even for same price, will not buy again."

"I used stay in Los angeles sometime back, my staple used to be Gordon Biersch blonde bock, used be a very nice beer with excellent body, color and taste, slightly stronger, but then bock' are meant to be that way. Becks was my other favorite different beer styles but fantastic in it's own right. I haven't tasted a better lager than becks, but then i haven't been to Germany."
"The beer has a bit of a sulfur smell, and is bitter, but I like it, and its distinct flavor.  Again, I think in a blind taste test it would do better."
"Product of USA"
"A German style lager, quite weak in taste, and very cheap. However, it still beats most local beers here in Finland by its competetive price and taste. An all-around ""drinking"" beer."
""
"Very inoffensive, nearly tasteless, not too carbonated beer. It's a decent cheap option if on sale and in my opinion better than a Bud Light or Miller but not good enough to justify buying it if it's significantly more than those options. This is a real ""drinking"" beer."
""
""
"For me it is one step up from fosters, heiniken, miller and bud. Nothing special but better than some of the other global brands. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy Beck's again but in a tight spot or given to me I would happily drink and enjoy it. It's just an ok, decent pilsner i guess."
"Kinda tastes like pee pee"
""
""
"Sláinte"
"Watery with no real flavor."
"Very refreshing and one of my favorite German Pilsner. Great clear color and best if it's ice cold. Smooth and clean ingredients won't give you any headaches even after you finish 6 bottles by yourself. ;)"
""
""
"Overall : Too bland, almost no flavors. A little stale, missing some freshness."
""
""
"no flavor. personally i don't want to have this beer again"
"Way too carbonated with very little flavor. Not hoppy at all. It feels like drinking sparkling water. Struggled to finish a bottle."
"Green, the color of sickness, the color of sallow malevolence.  This beer almost always comes in green bottles, which usually is indicative of skunky goodness.  My best intentions led me to purchase this brew in cans, which led me down a path of darkness and pain.  This is my own fault, and I abhor creation and the almighty himself for the suffering invoked after a night of consuming this blasphemous nectar. I awoke with a head pierced by a dagger of molten ore and pounding fury.  My mouth was an arid, dessicated abyss where only demons and harlots dare tread.  All of this, in the name of Teutonic superiority.  Would I recommend this beer?  If you wish to gaze into the the eyes of Satan, then wholeheartedly."
"Not a completely terrible beer, I just prefer more flavor in my beer"
""
"It's not bad, I'd only buy a twelve pack of it if it's on sale though."
"Not a bad beer, when I started to enjoy more flavor to my beer, That's when I left stuff like this alone."
"It was late at night and it we were outside looking for the full moon. Found the bag of canned Beck's and we were thirsty from running the last 2 miles of trail. The air was cold, the beer was cold and we were thirsty. Aww Beck's, the right beer at the right time."

"Don't drink it much anymore, but before the craft beers took off, this was one of my goto beers."
""
"It can be too fizzy"
""
""
""
"Granted that this isn't craft beer, it's not swill either.  I remember me and a friend getting this or St. Pauli on payday back in the stone age (1980s).  We thought we were pretty darn worldly and sophisticated! I sometimes still like beers such as Becks or Heinies for the lawnmowing or fence painting.  I had not tried a Becks in awhile.  I might have to go for a St. Pauli next."

"Ok drinkable only buy on special"

"Not a bad beer, but neither what I expected when I bought it as an imported craft beer, it's still fresh and funny to drink, would not buy an importation again, but with a discount (or in Germany as well) I think it would work perfectly at a party  for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"As you can tell from my profile picture, I love Beck's. It so simple that it's brilliant. I first had a Beck's when I was seventeen, and I have loved them since. I highly recommend these and all of their other flavours."

"The flavor has a crackery Pilsner malt taste with a tad of bitterness and a clean feel. This is super easy to drink, is very light and not nearly as poor as one would believe."

"I wished they had other German beer here in L.A.."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers. Light but almost  medium mouthfeel. Skunks smell but in a good way. Good carbonation maybe a bit much. Bitter but smooth. Very good beer"
""
""
""
"i Bought it walmart in a 12 pack, was wanting something i hadnt had before. first i have to admit i am a fan of IPA and strong flavors. This does not have a strong flavor. it had good carbonation and mouthfeel, almost like a sprite. the flavor wasnt there, none, zilch. if someone gave it to me i would drink it but i wont buy it again. plain old budweiser or Miller has beer taste than this. I expected more from a German beer and now i feel betrayed , let down and disappointed."

"Overall (2.58) : It's not a bad beer, and it's not something I'd avoid like the plague. I just would probably never drink it again unless it was offered to me for free. It's just got this linear cornfest thing going on, with diaper and musty barley. Can't shake it."

"Over all – I will go on record now and say I actually do like Becks. It is not great and I appreciate that, but it is a Pilsener and as such is a simple brew and it does that very well. Perfect chilled to near freezing on a scorching summer’s day! A highly drinkable number and I find it to be very refreshing. Not too strong which also makes it a good drink for a night on the tiles. If you know everyone else is going to get messy on a night out then this one will keep you in the game till only you are left standing. Mind the hangover though!"

"Pours a straw-yellow in color with a thin white head that settles down to just along the sides of the glass. No lacing is really seen, just a bit when sipped. The aroma is not much of really, just some grains. Not 'skunky' though like so many that come in a green bottle for some reason. The taste is pretty much the same just of some grain and hops. Not bitter but just plain for the most part. Overall, it is OK but nothing special but is smooth and refreshing. Bit watered-down though."

"Appeareance is a dark-ish straw color. Not much to speak of. 1 finger head fairly persistent slight lacing. Smell used to smell great and skunky, like some good dank marijuana. Now it smells like Bud Light nonsense. Same witrh the taste, like pisswater now. I am reviewing what I used to like with those numbers, not the case I recently drank."
"Yes."

"Congrats Inbev, you've ruined another brand. Next I'm craving a good euro lager, I'll make a better choice. Even many American euro style lagers are insanely better. Prima Pils from Victory comes to mind."

"Well I have to agree with the majority this beer really lost something in the transfer from Germany to STL. I really enjoyed this beer in the late 80's. The beer was robust and well worth the price at that time. The flavor just was outstanding! I felt as if I were in Germany just by drinking it! I'm trying to be nice here the color is great, it pours okay but then I have to drink it and I say to myself what happened? I hope inbev will address this situation but I understand its all about money to some people."

"Overall/Drinkability:  Like many German lagers, engineered to be drank in large quantities, and this fits that quality. I could drink more, but, I know there are more flavorful German lagers out there.  Therefore this beer is at best average."
"Pours from the bottle like any common lager, with a sunny yellow color (with maybe a hint of green) and a white fizzy head. The aroma is a combination of musty hops, a little bit of lemon, and some light cracker-like breadiness. The flavor features sweet cereal grains, a bit of corn, and only a faint earthy hop character. There is also a little bit of a metallic flavor in the finish, which always tends to turn me off. There is some body, but the light, fizzy carbonation cuts right through it. Overall, this beer is fine and drinkable, but not appreciably different than most other common, mass-produced lagers."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, it lived up to my expectations. No more, no less. Next!"
""
""
"Smells skunky but isn't overwhelming. There's no noticeable hop aroma or flavor either. This is all malt not even good malt. There is no way that this qualifies as a pilsener. It's kind of pricy cor what you get. It tastes like a generic cheap euro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"sure enough--on the front label, instead of brewed in bremen, brewed in st. louis. fuck. another of life's simple pleasures killed by the bean counters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As lagers go, this is a very good choice. Pours with a clear golden color and is topped with a medium foamy head. Aroma is malty where grains are dominant. The taste is therefore initially slightly sweet, followed by a pleasant bitterwsweet body finishing with a slight bitterness. Similar to other lagers, but there is more taste present here. Refreshing and tasty, it’s Beck’s."
""
""

"O- Straight forward pale lager, that I wouldn't pay more than $20 for a case."

"InBev really messed up the greatest beer on my planet...German purity law...scrapped !....Now tastes like a shot of water has been added to every bottle...YUCK !...Trying to locate the Oktoberfest version....MISSING IN ACTION !...WTH ? are they thinking ? Gosh sakes...add a dollar to the price of a 12 pack and go back to the great brew it once was !...I had that sick feeling inside when informed of InBev desires to brew it in a ""Bud"" plant...Gave it my best try and couldn't believe they would alter it....Very foolish move....As for now, my only redemption is Saranac Oktoberfest and the hunt for a new , regular beer ....Can you say ""Spaten""....I can !...By the way, I and my friends think the art work on the bottles is idiotic....really bad !..Can't make up for the watering down ...nope."

"Becks is on of thoses beers you have to appreciate the second time around. When I first had it I didn't like it at all. Second time around I tasted the stout-like finish at the bottom of the bottle. It was somehow more smooth. I'm not saying to anyone who reads this to go out and buy becks, but I'm saying that I like it. It has character."

"I got a free carton of Beck's from one of my sales reps at work, as he reps for a German company. I so wish he knew of my penchant from Weihenstephaner. Aaaanyways…long story short, I purchased and consumed many other beers before I finally finished this case in a fit of desperation. This is by all accounts a macro beer. It is lacking in taste, and hardly drinkable, smells ‘orrible, looks clear light-yellow and feels underwhelming. I avoid this beer as it’s very hard to drink. I respect this beer for its worldwide appeal, its high international sales and its country of origin. That’s about it."

"Not a bad beer until it was produced domestically. Save yourself some money and order a Bud; same stuff anyway. The Becks Black is even more disappointing. They added more alcohol but it's the same crummy, fake import. For a few dollars more, go for a Heineken."

"I drank this beer last night at the UC in Chicago out of a 16 oz can. When I saw the label, Brewed in the USA I knew I had the imposter in hand. Everyone, I implore you, do not buy InBev products if you can help it. Certainly don't buy Becks USA. Do not support their program to buy breweries, cheapen recipes, and ruin what was otherwise good beer. InBev are a plague on this earth. Becks is their latest outrage to the beer drinker. BOYCOTT THIS BEER!"
""
""
""
"Unfortunately domestic American beers are a joke. I completely gave up on them. Of the foreign beers, beck's has to be one of my favorites. It has a very classic skunky European smell to it, It's nod bad , just a very distinctive odor. It goes well with food or by itself after a long day. It can be found in most stores in my area and has a very affordable price at $3.49 for a 24 oz bottle. I am surprised to see other comments bashing this beer, i suppose it's a case of love it or hate it. Overall 4.25."

"Certainly an easy drinking Pils. I think the US version is brewed in St Louis. Go figure. But, not bad."
""

""
""
"This is a generic German pilsener. If you do not like pilsener, you will hate Becks. Very strong flavor, quite bitter actually. Tastes best a little warmer than most beer 50-60 degrees, which allows the true bitterness to be revealed. Refreshing taste, with moderate carbonation."
""
"Overall, this is better than others I've had in the style, but not by much. The mouthfeel is pretty good for such a light beer. A good change of pace in a lighter drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance was a beautiful shade of gold but it poured a thin head and had little to know lacing. The smell was a good strong odor of malt and barley - appealing but not over powering. Mouthfeel had strong carbonation with good velvety and smooth roll on the tongue. I liked the taste, it was bold, crisp, and better than what I had expected. Not the best beer I've had but good enough."
""
""
""
""
"Always a hint of skunkiness to this beer, and just a little too rough. If you can get past a couple of these, it's not a problem. Otherwise, a nice color, kind of crisp, effervescent. Kevin Bacon drank one in ""She's Having a Baby," and the beer still retains a 1980s, yuppie vibe."

Anyway, it doesnt taste the same to me now that its brewed here and I'm sorry to say that I'm looking for a different beer for my fridge. It's taste is closer to Busch than Becks. Very disappointing."

"Just about anything else is a better choice."

"330ml bottle. Calabria, Italy. Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a medium quickly fading white head. Aroma and Taste of lemon citrus fruity flavors, some grainy grassy cereal notes, and light bitterness. Palate is a medium slightly crisp body, with moderate carbonation. Finish is citrus fruity notes, grainy grassy notes, light bitter notes as well. Overall an ok summer time lager."
"I can't believe InBev destroyed Beck's as we know it (in the USA).I'm sure the Germans are still drinking the real thing.They would pour this swill down the drain!Shame on you InBev! This just proves how stupid and gullible they think we are in America."

"I love Beck's. Now, granted, I may not have a discerning taste, as I find little difference in the Original vs. Busch version of Beck's. In fact, I have been buying it with more frequency since it's been brewed abroad, but I cannot exactly explain why that is. Point is, I love Beck's, I've always loved Beck's, its not my very favorite beers but when its available at a bar thats all I'll drink for the whole night, and I dont know many other beers i can say that about as I tend to switch it up throughout the night if I'm not pinching pennies. Skunky, but in a good way, crisp, not filling at all. Hell not even as expensive as a comparable beer. I'll take this over Heineken any day of the week and twice on Sundays. This beer serves me well in any setting, out to eat, with an all day BBQ, or just hanging out watching the game. Winter, summer, spring, or fall, Beck's is a beer that I can enjoy. My tastes tend to fluctuate every 5-6 months, but Beck's always gets regular rotation in my fridge. More discerning tastebuds may notice a dip in quality since its buyout, but I can't and I still enjoy the beer for what it is: a very enjoyable, reasonably priced german pilsner."

" I found the taste to be average with some diacetyl present which doesn't harm the malt flavor that much, but there is a little vegetal Dms present with a hint of hop spiciness and slight corn-pop like sweetness, the flavor comes and goes and if the aroma was not so skunky that basic flavor would be decent, I blame the green bottle for the hop degradation so in general just a so-so pils. Overall I would not get this beer again based on the skunked smell and it is really sub par in comparison to other pilsners of same style."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. .Pours a standard medium yellow with a one finger head and no lacing, although carbonation bubbles do continue to rise to the top. The smells is of skunky adjunct and slight rice grain. The taste is fairly bitter. More skunk than anything, following the nose. Along with some slightly cooked veggies and sweet grains. The mouthfeel adds some more sweet grain to the mix, But absolutely nothing else. Overall, It is a party beer only. In the case that you do not mind flavor at all. Other than that, avoid. Now I've never had the "" German "" version of Beck's, Nor will I ever take a chance with having it. If they still brew this stuff by the "" German Purity Law "" I think that they should probably stop doing that. What the hell is the law? putting a skunk's ass up to the bottle and letting it shit inside?"
""
""
"Overall all I can say is Becks has been ruined for all American drinkers. It's basically Bud in a becks can now, terrible. I think there should be separate entries for the American and German Becks as the are essentially different beers."
""

""
""
"I see that the reviewers gave PBR a 72 rating & the Bros an 80 rating. And the reviewers gave Beck's a 67 rating & the Bros a 62 rating. Are you all nuts?!! Beck's now may be owned by InBev & brewed in St. Louis, MO. But I recently called Beck's brewmaster & he assured me that they were still brewing to the German Purity Law, which means they're only using water, barley malt, hops & yeast. I'm sure Pabst isn't doing the same. I know why all of you are rating Pabst higher than Beck's. It has nothing to do with PBR's quality. Rather, it's the ""pseudo-hipster's"" rating, i.e. ""PBR is 'cooler' than Beck's because it doesn't advertise & has the patriotic U.S. colors of red, white & blue."" C'mon everyone - get real. No way is PBR better tasting than Beck's. And no, I don't work for Beck's & I'm not German. However, I've brewed my own beers & know a bit of what I'm talking about."

"Another one bites the dust..This is probably the worst desecration of a once quality brew. It not only tastes like urine..it gives me a headache like a typical Coors product or any other mass produced American beer. If you like German beer, DO NOT BUY THIS!! Its terrible..."

"Lead the way Beck's! Call me a sellout, but I don't give a crap. I will choose American Beck's any day than Budweiser or any other canned American beer."

"Well it was like another friend had died by the name of Becks - first sip and I was tasting a thin, insipid corn swill. I choked two down, copped a major headache, and shed some more tears for two dearly departed friends."
""
"Beck's now brewed in St Louis USA. I recently stopped drinking Bass Ale due to it now being brewed in NY. Bought a 12 pack of Beck's, first sip, I looked at the fine print and returned it to the store for a 11 bottle refund. Was in the ""import"" section of the beer, I guess you could say it was shipped across the Mississippi. The Canada made stuff is almost as bad ie: Fosters, Guinness, etc. There's still a few beers brewed where they should be and I'll make do. The price of this swill should be in line with Bud Light and other domestics, not the ridiculous high price they are asking. Sobriety is starting to look better every day with stunts like this."
"as everyone has pointed out, becks for americans is now made in st louis and is NOTHING like it used to be. yeah im furious about this."

"Becks, please return to Bremen!"

" And , like other reviewers recalled the Lowenbrau experience which in 1980 I ,also, shared : I became angry at the fraud and lies of misleading customers and patrons of the beer. I also feel cheated at having bought 12 bottles of chemically colored diluted 'urine' posing as beer. May Becks suffer for this !"

"It is now just another horrible American-ized non-descript imitation of a beer. I have been drinking Beck's for over 20 years, and was still able to get the real thing, brewed in Bremen, until recently. The difference is palpable. No head, mouth full of characterless fizz. Takes me back to the demise of Lowenbrau: Munich beer bought by Miller, altered and brewed in U.S. for ""American tastes"" or lack thereof. Died quietly. Here we go again! Thanks a whole lot AB."

"O: A very simplistic beer brewed in the style of the American crap beer it competes against. Almost as easy to drink as water, though I think water has the edge on it."
""
""

""
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell upon opening is immediate skunk that fades and gives way to grainy and corn flake aromas. Taste is also of grain and corn flake flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer all around but the skunk aroma when I first opened the bottle was one of the worst I have smelled in a beer before."

"Beck's in now brewed in St. Louis, should not take long for market share to slip."
"Beck's (made in Germany) WAS my favorite beer for the past decade. Two every night after work. Always my favorite with steak. NO MORE. Now made in St. Louis and tastes like typical watered down American slop. Less body and flavor, but a fizzier mouthfeel. St. Louis may be great at making arches, but leave Beck's to their German brewers and original (presumably European) ingredients. Save your money and buy Bud."
"I called the hotline and they confirmed that we will only be able to obtain the US brewed beer in the future. So much for Becks - too bad it had to go the way of Lowenbrau."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, light straw-colored with a one finger head that receded into a thin cap with thin, oily lacing. The nose was one of malt and biscuit. The taste is pure and clean, just what I'd expect from the style. Around medium bodied with a slight aftertaste. I've always considered this beer to be symbolic of the German pilsner style and as I've grown older and have experienced more beer styles it is not as outstanding as I once considered it, but it is still a mainstay in the style in my opinion. A quality brew that I won't skip over too often."

"Half litre bottle, pale colour, clear, medium thin head. Typical fresh north german pils smell, slightly industrial with hints of noble hop. Crisp taste, was refreshing but there wasn't too much going on, grainy finish. Coarse on the palate with lots of gas. Becks is best enjoyed in Bremen on a warm day somewhere near the Weser river."
"nothing special (or even good), but when your only option is this or BMC and you want some flavor, it's not a bad choice."

""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a straw yellow color with a small white head that dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Smells of light malt with a little bit of spice. Tastes of light malt, but with a little more spice, but I cannot pinpoint where. My guess is a combination of malt and hops. Beer is light bodied, goes down smooth, but does seem to be a bit heavily carbonated. Overall, a slightly above average beer, but nothing really to use as a great example of German beer."

"Cheers LampertLand"
"I figured I'd try this stuff out in a can on a lark...then realized I'd never reviewed it before anyway. Hm. Let's do it, then: It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white froth. The nose comprises light grass, light corn, light flowers, and light hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, though a vague sense of corn-syrup-style sweetness comes in in a big way. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a sub-par pils, but a decent adjunct lager-ish beer. I've had better, and I've definitely had worse."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as any other (non-imperial) pilsener. The body is nice and light, creating a very refreshing mouthfeel. The carbonation is a bit subdued and definitely lacks fizz. This beer is definitely very drinkable and could probably be chugged on a hot summer day (if one were so inclined)."

"A german import with a yeasty, bread-like aftertaste and a tad skunky on the smell. Yet another beer that needs to be ice cold when imbibing. A standby if you don't have access to a more quality crafted, non-corporate (produced in mass quantities for export) brew."

"This beer pours a clear yellow with a thin head and nice lacing. It's aroma is slightly lemony with hints of cereal and bread. The flavor is very well balanced between malty sweetness and hop bitterness and notes of dough. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Becks is a very good beer. smooth, highly drinkable, and a perfect match for schnitzel and sauerkraut. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Pale straw, white head that subsides in time. You know what you’re getting with Becks. There’s nothing wrong with this beer, but the its not exactly perfect so I would say alittle above average brew. I would recommend it if you're looking for a casual beer to sip on at a party or enjoy one every now and then. Wouldn't say I would drink it all the time but definitely every now and then on a regular basis."

"O: Pleasant simple drinkable beer that I would have again. Had never critically tasted it before. "

"this being a german beer one would think it would be great, but this is not so in my opinion. the appearance is an off golden lager with a very thin head that dissipates quickly after being poured (and I pour correctly for the record). the smell is of hops and grain. the smell of this beer is not exactly prominent or robust but if you kind of waft it you will pick up hops and grain. the color of the beer like I said is a light golden and not cloudy. bubbles rising is visible. The taste literally has no character. its a step up from busch and coors light but not much better than either one. The taste is good in that it goes down smooth and is good for anybody who just wants to drink. if you are looking for a beer with character Becks is not the one because you can taste hops and grain with water being the other prominent flavor. because of this I do not like this beer, and probably will not drink it again. this is just because I like beer with multiple flavors and robustness and character. others may think differently this is just what I think."

"Calling this a session beer would be an understatement since alcohol shouldn't be the only measurement of how many can be downed in a sitting. Maybe this tastes better overseas but here in America, I'd probably never have this again."

"O: Overall an OK European lager."
"O: Overall drinks more like a light macro lager rather a fine german pilsner. Gets graded harder due to the fact that a german brewery turned its fine style into a tasteless American macro lawnmower beer that vaguely resembles what it should be."
"Overall Drinkability - Wish I could be nice and just grade this beer on smell alone. So smooth and enticing. But no, it all goes downhill sharply after that. I really wanted to like this beer too. The acidity, metallic and astringent finish and aftertaste really ruins this brew."
"Body-Light on the palate, nice effervescence on the tongue, smooth and lightly creamy. Pairs with sausage. I like this stuff even though it’s just easy drinking beer, though not really a good example of the style."
"Becks is what I consider the proto-typical German Pilsners that all other should be compared to. Why you ask...probably becasue it was the first german beer I ever hand som many years ago. Anyhow....the beer pours golden clear with decent head and corbonation to start, both which fade rapidly. The smell is grain/barley and pilsner hops. The taste is sharp, pilsner hops strike first, then a slight balance of malt, the aftertaste is bitter. The beer has good body, but not too heavy. Overall it is a good average beer."
"Mouthfeel and Overall - Light-bodied in taste. A bit of cleaning supply feel."
"o-this beer is a nice change of pace from light beers in the US (then again there are no light beers here) I like to pick these up if i'm going to be drinking a few but it is certainly not something to go out of your way for"
"O-I used to loved this beer,but now,wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"O - I'm not sure how this one does so well. I can see people drinking most other generic macro lagers because they don't really have much taste. the taste of this is just offensive. I guess I'll try it once more from a bottle or tap if I can find it just to be sure, but man, this one is pretty much for the birds as far as I'm concerned"
"Meh, didn't even bother finishing this bottle. Borderline offensive, there's better much better pilsners out there."
"Light gold in color, with a euro smell. Taste is good, the impressive event with this beer is the mouthfeel. Nice clean finish, one of the best we have tasted. Over all we think this is one worth having. We still think the home team does it better. Good with nuts and cheese."
"This came in a 24 ounce green bottle. Back label states that the beer is best used before 04.2012. I am drinking this on Sept 13, 2011. I can read my computer screen through the mug. The color is a very light yellow. I see moderate carbonation that dissipates after a few minutes. The head was larger then a fingers width but dissipated after a minute to almost nothing. The lacing is minimal and does not stay long. I smell a skunky-metal staleness. The mouth feel is watery with a slight oiliness. There is a carbonated bubbly feel against the top of my mouth. The taste reminds me of Pilsner Urquelle I had two days ago without nearly the same level of sourness (The Urquelles were the first Pilsners I've tried so maybe they were light damaged or maybe that's how a Pilsner is supposed to taste). There is a sweetness with Becks that is less evident then the mild sourness in the after taste. I prefer this to the Urquelle I had."
"RJT"
"O: A drinkable but average German Pilsener."
"O: Overall this is a fairly poor brew, as the flavors are all over the place and the overall character is slightly concerning."
"Pours a brilliant straw-golden color, translucent, with modest white head. Noise is big oily skunk-like character. Palate offers fizzy, highly carbonated cereal grain sweetness with herbal/oily/skunk flavors. Fnishes the same. Light, though not watery."
"Becks always reminds me of that line from Beerfest: ""...und...und...und...und Becks!!!"" Classic cinema, does not get any better than that. Where were we? Oh yeah, Becks. Third best beer in Germany? Riiight. ""Becks"" is probably German for ""run of the mill."" Not terrible for a macro, but still watery and a little skunky. Typical clear pale yellow appearance. Some grassy/grainy/unpleasant hop notes. Standard pale lager mouthfeel. Und...und...und NEXT."
"O - A light commercial German pilsner. Not bad out of the pick of mass produced beers though."
"Going to look elsewhere."
"O- While not blowing me away, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this beer. It has enough of a definable character for me to remember it- amongst the millions of other beers in this style. It definitely is not as robust as I would like- but more than I anticipated."
"Got this from a bottle and served on a pilsener glass. Pale clear yellow color although not as clear as other pilseners I've tried before. Head is not foamy at all and dissipates rather quickly. Hints of citrus and grassy/floral touches both on the smell and taste. Carbonation is just about right on this one."
"Overall not a bad beer. For the style it's decent and refreshing."
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The Pilsener poured a very clear, light yellow color, it produced a nice white head with average head retention. Average lacing. The aroma consisted of light grain, a small amount of hops and it was somewhat musty. The taste of this pilsner was light in body, some light malt base with a sweet crisp finish. This beer is OK in a pinch...there are much better German Pilsener's out there to be had. Skip this mass produced lager and get a real german beer. Prost!"
"Final Grade: 2.77, a C grade."
"The beer is a pale yellow color with a foamy white one finger head. It smells like a typical green bottled Euro lager, it was funky, skunky and had hints of grass and lemon. The taste is slightly bitter with grassy hops and grain. The beer is light with prickly carbonation. This is pretty much your average Euro/ green bottled pale lager."
"O: For an ""import"" macro lager, it's not that bad--I'd take it over Bud any day. But for a marginal increase, you can get much better beers. And good Lord, give up the green bottles--do yourself a favor and drink this canned, if possible."
"Pours a somewhat attractive head with moderate retention. Does not offer the most appealing smell. The taste was not very unique from the majority of other macros, both American or not. Would like to find this on tap somewhere to see what it is like after not being stored in a green bottle."
"O: Not a bad option if there is nothing else. I would not reach for this pils if I had options, but would not turn it down either."
"O: Friends of mine drink this as a ""party beer", and it does that job rather well. I will not over analyze that, it's a decent beer, but 'Beck's' isn't my beer of choice for those occasions. The fruity apple taste isn't really my pint of pilsener. I find better options out there - like 'Bitburger' or 'Starobrno' - with more pleasing character and bitterness."
"O/D-To summarize, I would probably pick this before a bunch of other Macro brews. That is all."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how mild the flavoring was. Had they attempted to amp up any aspects of this beer’s flavor profile it could have resulted in a much more offensive and bitter beer. While it falls generally within the parameters for the style, everything is muted and the beer is not really the most exciting thing to drink."
"o: i had this a few months ago out of the can and was disappointed. maybe cuz i was already intoxicated. this beer actually surprised me.. at $1.59 a 16oz can, its somewhat of a bargain."
"Overall – A step up from the countless other euro-beers that are on the market, but it's still nothing to write home about. There are some other beers in this style/category that I'd drink before this one."
"It’s extremely basic, but in all fairness, Beck’s subscribes to the Reinheitsgebot, or the “German Beer Purity Law,” a now defunct regulation originating in 15th century Germany that prohibited beer from being made with anything other than water, barley, and hops. It’s more or less just a marketing ploy now, but if that’s how you earned your success, why change it. It’s hard to find a lot of complexity in beer that is literally water, malt, and hops, but it makes for a good baseline to compare other beers to. It’s good if that’s what you’re in the mood for, but relatively basic otherwise."
"This was a very pleasant surprise-- I was expecting to be handing a D on this review, and I'm pleased to say it was better than I had remembered!"
"Drinkable, but not a brilliant lager compared to some. Flavour too light and bland, with insufficient hop presence to add character. This is cheaply available and OK on a hot day, but nothing special."
"I actually found this beer to be more enjoyable than I though I would. Not as good as Bitburger, but that's fine since we don't have that in Socorro anyway. Wouldn't buy a sixer of this, but another 24oz bottle for $2.60 if the German pils craving hits may not be out of the question..."
"M/O. A light watery sticky beer that is rather forgetful. Awhile back a friend of mine who told me about beer advocate told me Beck's was pretty much another budweiser, but even though budweiser is nothing great i'll take that or rolling rock over beck's any day."
"This is a German Pilsener brewed in Germany. These guys really need to step up their game."
"Taste profile is perfect for those who don't really like beer: upfront sweetness, very little malt or hops--then no aftertaste. A soda-pop beer that's forgettable as soon as it's done."
"Overall - Eh.... No thanks."
"Drinkability- overall this beer is highy drinkable to me as they come, its got such a nice hop finish and for such and affordable beer and easily available this is way towards the top for me, its above both stella and above heineken overall for me in the European easy to find everywhere lager style, its got enough flavor to keep it interesting and still has those perfect characteristics your looking for on a hot summer day, to me and underrated beer especially when compared to its peers"
"O: There’s nothing special with this beer. But I wouldn’t say no if I was offered this beer. It’s an easy drinking session beer."
"Overall, I don't hate it, if this was all I could get my hands as well as the usual BMC I'd happily take it but there are better options usually available to me, that said it's not bad and right now my favorite of the bland lagers."
"In terms of Philippine beers, it's much closer to and is even slightly better than San Miguel Super Dry. The regular San Miguel Pale Pilsen doesn't compare. I enjoyed this brew."
"Eh. Not fairly impressed."
"O - Overall, a crisp and refreshing pilsener that is easily drinkable and boasts decent flavours for a mass produced ale. One of the better macro pils, IMO."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Pours a pale-golden body with a small 1 finger head and minimal retention. Smells pretty much like a German pilsener. Not too much distinctive here. Tastes slightly biscuit-y with a pleasant fruity finish which leaves a slightly dry feel on the back of the tongue. Not the best, but not the worst German pilsener. If given the choice, go with Spaten!"
"Becks was probably one of the first German beers I had ever tried and it really didn't raise the bar too high. I couldn't get over how skunky this beer smelled, the taste kind of reflects that too. Grassy funky flavors on the tongue, which didn't really make me enjoy this beer at all."
"C"
"D: It is surprisingly drinkable and enjoyable to a certain degree."
"A high selling beer in europe, and possibly one of the best among that category. Still, not good"
"I'm glad I didn't pay for this one."
"Poured a 3"" white head which dissipated to nothing. Clear straw yellow color. Smells of a basic lager with the slightest hint of start of skunking. Taste is corn and a mild sweetness. There's a slight zing. All in all pretty boring and in a blind taste testing I'd have guessed it was some Adjunct American Lager."
"Pours an odd off straw color with a thick white head that goes away quickly and has no lacing. Smells well -- skunked -- just terrible -- like a rotting corpse or something dead. Tastes better, like corn adjuncts, some sweet malts and a faint inkling of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp with a thick carbonation. Drinkability is not very good."
"This is not a real lager."
"D- If people want to supply their parties with it, I'll drink it. as far as buying it... I'm just not that into pilsner that I would want to get such a run of the mill basic one."
"Not my fave but makes me appreciate a great craft beer even more."
"Very standard stuff here. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't intensely drinkable. Maybe I have a soft spot in my heart for it since it was one of my very first non-USA macros...but I do enjoy it."
"This beer is much better in a can than it is bottled! I once had a german friend who offered this beer to me and I wasnt impressed. Granted it does taste better to the good ol' american bud light! Becks has an awful smell to it! But if you can get beyond the smell it does taste ok!"
"Had this on tap at a bar without any good choices. Pours a pale yellow colour with very thin white head. Almost no lacing and head dissipates to nothing pretty quickly. Smells of some grains, I don't detect even a hint of hops. Small bitterness in the flavour, fairly sweet. Mouthfeel actually is nice for the style, which seems to be about the only thing I liked with this beer."
"BTW, they've updated the label from the photo here. It's basically a large BECK'S logo across the middle, more pronounced. For the better probably. I'm sure people are donating the bottles in the photo to their local thrift store(s) or will someday and they'll mark them as 'collectable' like my local Hazel Dell Salvation Army would and then sell them for $12."
"D -- Well, after the skunk fades this is certainly drinkable. Is it a German Pils to style? I think I'd pick it over EKU Pils in a blind test pretty quickly. The citrus character and grainy flavor seem to put this beer in its own category, but the bottom line is that I'd choose it over BMC any day, but definitely not over a good Munich Helles. Sure wish I'd found one of those."
"D- Blah, bitter and skunky. Nasty as others say before me :)))"
"D: I will never purchase this beer again."
"It is your typical watery mass produced pilsner. While tasting a little better than most it is still isn't very good. The only plus side is it's easy to drink....that is if you can ignore the lack of taste..."
"Serving type: Tap."
"D: A fairly pricey option for a thin uninteresting brew. Drinkable, but so is tea."
"D- Blah, bitter and skunky. Nasty"
"Pale Fizzy watery yellow!!! First thing i smell two feet off is an oniony skunk... Don't you love sub tropical island that could care less if your beer has sat out in the sun for years.... anyhow It turns out its not so skunky Sharp pils bite that quickly subsides into wonderful malt then after its gone down the sticky residue brind back on more hops and says hay lets have another drink shall we! Mouthfeel lets be honest its just good to have a brew in my mouth, Its cold and almost harsh bite to it the carbonation is that of warm soda but quickly smooths out."
"Notes: my workhorse Pilsner. gonna price out a 1/2 keg this week."
"Started drinking this one out of the bottle but decided to put the majority of it into a glass. It had the typical fast dissolving head with the typical gold color. It smelled of skunk with the rest of the beer behind it. The taste thankfully only has a slight tinge of that skunk with that German European beer taste in the background. Besides the skunk it had a grainy malt taste but with a pretty nice hop character that reminds of me of a subtle version of Victory's Prima Pils. Its a very floral bitter hop note that reminds me of the hops in a Boston Lager. It has some creamy mouthfeel which is definitely a plus. Seriously if they just put this in brown bottles it'd be quite enjoyable. Other than that there's other German beers you can get for almost the same price that are better in my opinion."
"D: Euro Lager, pretty plain and not that enjoyable..."
"Sorry Germany, this is not a good pilsner. It's more like a typical Euro-lager. Think Heineken, but with more steel and aluminum."
"It is brewed by the German Purity law says so on the bottle and websight. Its a decent tasting beer for a macro and I dont understand why it gets a bashing. Its a great pounder in the summer over the BMC junk."
"Becks really reminded me of a slightly watered-down Heineken, actually. It's more focused on hops than malts but it's not overpowering. I liked it way more than I thought I would. Overall, it was similar to Heineken but smoother and less skunky. I'm sure I'll be drinking it again. For a German macro, I was surprised at how decent it was. I thought it would be lacking in flavor but use the German name as a crutch for sales. But I wouldn't hesitate to order one again. If you like smoother, crisp, hoppier beers, this is one to try for sure."
"Pours golden with a small, short lived, white head. Aroma of hay, grassy hops and bready malt. Bready malt, grain and floral hops balanced nicely in the mouth. Light crisp body. Average, earthy finish. It's been a long time since I drank this beer and I didn't expect much. However, this Helles is better than most I tried."
"Clean pleasant after taste."
"buy it from a can then decide if you like it of not!"
"This pale pilsner produced a weak one finger head of light white foam. It quickly vanished leaving nothing but a ring of wisp around the edge of the glass. Pale yellow color matches a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. This beer has the aroma of caramelized wheat, barley malt, and green hops. Tastes are wisps of lime, golden wheat and heavy hops. Sort of watery across my tongue and against my upper palate. I was hoping for a little better flavor, but I don't think I will have another unless it is offered."
"D: Over-carbonated and under-flavored. Next, please."
"D - If Heineken is your beer then this would be perfect for you otherwise, a very simple pilsener with nothing complex going on."
"Pours a somewhat-deep straw color with a multi-finger white head that leaves behind the tiniest bit of lacing. Smell brings some very light herbal, floral hops and some grain. Taste is slightly bitter and mostly consists of a plain grain and husk flavor. Large amounts of carbonation on a light body. Drinks okay and better than a lot of its ""peers," but not one of my favorites."
"Not bad at all but nowhere near the best, take it for what it is and enjoy and like all Reinheitsgebot beers, hangovers are a rare side effect."
"Overall you'd expect a better brew when considering the nice packaging and the fact this is a German brand. Would buy it discounted from time to time. Definitely much better than coors n' bud"
"Overall: A decent lager. Very skunky, but is refreshing with its light flavor. Definitely best suited for sessions."
"D: Not great. Needs to be cold."
"D- drink them cold only, i had nothing else lying around figured id pop open one and review, turns out it wasnt horrendous"
"Pours a transparent gold color with a 1"" white head. Smells like a traditional german pilsner, but its a very light scent. Taste is lighter than other pilsners I have tried, its crisp, hoppy and refreshing. Mouthfeel is a little watery and pretty carbonated, but its crisp and refreshing. The unoffensive taste and crisp mouthfeel plus the tolerable ABV make for high drinkability. Overall Its a fine beer, but it is nothing exceptional, only a few steps better than bud or miller."
"Though a bland style, there is enough flavor to make it drinkable, not just because how light it is."
"From the 24 fl. oz. green bottle marked 04.2010-L11191T. The pour is a lively golden yellow with a good two inch puffy white head that lingers for a good period of time. The aroma is of sweet malts and fortunately not a lot of green-bottle tainted metals. The mouthfeel is light to medium. The taste is full of grass and traditional German malts with a slightly sour bitterness on the end. I have had it before and it tastes as I remember it."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's a decent poundable beer but there are several others in the style that I would choose first."
"Not bad at all but nowhere near the best, take it for what it is and enjoy and like all Reinheitsgebot beers, hangovers are a rare side effect."
"D: only if it's the only beer available."
"Golden yellow colour, doesn't look particularly appealing but not bad either. More carbonation than appearance would suggest but feels great, just the right amount. Tastes clean and refreshing with enough interesting hoppiness to keep coming back for more. Good one for summer days. Drinkability is great and can't think of much more to want from a lager than this offers."
"Pours a clear gold with fizzy carbonation and moderate cap of foamy white head that disapears very quickly. Scent is of pale, but fresh grains with a touch (im really reaching far done for this, but they are there) of earthy and slightly spiced hops. Taste is clean, minimal fresh grain taste. Light bodied, highly carbonated. Once again, with a beer like this all i hope for is the absence of impurities and this comes across as clean, clear and crisp, although lacking anything noteworthy."
"Drinkability - I'd say that if you're looking for a lighter feeling German pils that's not actually a light lager, this wouldn't be too bad. Still, not one of my favorites."
"Overall its a solidly average version of the style. Not terrible by any means, but not really great either."
"Overall, this is a better choice than macro swill, but for about a dollar more a six pack you can get a good micro beer. I only drink this about once every 3 years."
"I have had Beck's from a bottle before and while it was good, I expect that it will be better from a CAN, as many beers that I had previously had out of green bottles have shown signifiCANt improvement from a CAN. The rocky, bone-white head quickly fell to wisps. Color was a light-sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like unadulterated lager - semi-sweet with a light apple juice scent underlying. Mouthfeel was medium, but it had the characteristic lager flavor of honey on the tongue. Finish was slightly dry, lightly bitter, definitely refreshing. I drained the contents of the 11.2 fluid ounce CAN pretty quickly on this humid afternoon, lemme tell ya! This definitely rates some cooler space, especially given its relatively low ABV."
"Bud or Kirin. I will say that it isn't offensive to me, so I think it's an average drinker, I could drink a few bottles. Nothing special, would be good with a simple dinner or a burger."
"If you must, you can look down your nose due to the fact that it's a mass-produced beer. If you do, however, you're missing out. This is a world-class beer, and one that's always welcome in my fridge."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, very hard to stop."
"Cheers"
"Dr. Why?"
"Light body and carbonation. Drinkability is good, bearing in mind that this is a very drinkable style. No major flaws here."
"Overall: Probably the best gateway to this style. Only the appearance really disappoints."
"D: I wouldnt recommend this. If its given to you for free then go to town but if you buy this then you will be very disgusted."
"Drinkability: Ugh... This is really just another poorly made European macro lager. For the price you pay for this, it certainly isn't worth it. I also don't really understand the ""German Pilsener"" designation. I really feel that this is more in line with the Euro Pale Lagers like Heineken, Grolsch, or Carlsberg. Definitely pass on this one."
"Pours a light golden yellow color with a white head. Aroma was definitely wheaty, not a huge fan. Taste was somewhat feint. Not too watery, but no robust either. It was also very wheaty, not a huge fan. Crisp and well carbonated however. Not a huge fan, probably won't have this agian."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite refreshing."
"last edit: 7/11/10"
"[Drinkability]: Average. Not the best Pilsner/Euro lager I had, but it's quite decent."
"Fairly drinkable."
"The drinkability of this beer is quite good, despite its failings. For a mass produced beer, it's certainly light years ahead of budweiser, coors, lite, and those types of beers. It's a good barbeque beer and is just fine ice cold out of a cooler on a hot day."
"overall: shame that a German beer is so bad if you want to drink a macro lager there are better beers out there."
"Drinkability is pretty decent for what it is. Nothing spectacular."
"D: This one goes down as easy as any other pils, but there are way better examples to be found elsewhere... even mass produced ones."
"Beck's isn't bad beer but it's not great. Not to mention it's not exactly cheap. Beck's is sold at most places that sell beer. So if you are fiending a German lager this might be all that is available for you."
"You've really done it Beck's! You have created the only product imaginable that is head and shoulders below BMC. Way to shit on over a thousand years of Bavarian brewing excellence."
"I'm surprised at the number/scope of the negative comments about Beck's. It's not a bell-ringer, but I don't think it deserves a D in any category. It seems to me to be a decent and serviceable, if not memorable, German-tasting pilsener. It has more hoppiness than other more expensive European beers -- I recall many many years ago thinking it was mondo bitter -- but I have come to consider Beck's my go-to ""better""/affordable beer: For some reason, the RiteAid in Grand Central Terminal -- the majestic marble palace of transportation through which I commute twice a day -- sells it for less than any other retail outlet I know of. I like Beck's much more than Heineken for its crispness and drinkability and consider it a great starter beer."
"In my early drinking days, this was considered a primo import, and I'm fairly certain I liked it then. Now I see it as just another run of the mill Euro macro. Nothing special; there's so many others of the style and price point with better drinkability to go with instead."
"This poured a clear pale gold with some quickly dissipating white head. It smelled like skunks and lemons and grassy hops, with wild bready yeast. It tasted like lemon zest and creamy yeast, with sour grassy hops. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a dirty bitter aftertaste. Overall this was not at all a good beer. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality to it. The scent seemed skunky, even though the beer was fresh. The taste wasn't much better. The body was weak. German macros are worse than American macros."
"Overall, this is a pretty mediocre example of the style and not a beer I'd want to drink to often. It's far too light on the flavoring, but it is a pretty poundable beer. This would make a nice substitute for an adjunct lager, but that's not lofty praise by any means."
"Great go to beer-- It pours like a pilsner should gold color and visible carbonation. The smell is fine- some hops, grass.. The taste is balanced -hops and malt.. This beer is highly drinkable- great year round beer and pairs with fish, salad, bbq, anything. More complex pilsners exist however for the price and availability one cannot beat this beer. A safe session beer"
"D: Fairly easy to drink despite the high carbonation. A higher quality, relatively tasty and drinkable brew."
"I bought a 6 pack just to try a new German beer and I got to say it was not that bad. I like the smell the look and how smooth is it when its nice ice cold. I could see myself pounding a few down in a bar with freinds. I would recomend people to go out and try it in my opinion I think you'll like it."
"D: Meh. Not doing much for me in this department. I do NOT want another one, 12oz is enough, actually I would be content with 6oz."
"Overall, Beck's is your average German Pilsener. It's easy to drink, but neither the taste or smell is exceptional. It's crisp & refreshing, a good light beer for the warm months. I'd like to have this again, but it couldn't be from a bottle. Or in the US. And I don't think I'm getting to Germany anytime soon, so ..."
"Overall, this beer just isn't my thing. It seems to taste skunky all around. I probably won't be drinking this anytime soon again. I just had the SA Noble Pils and I prefer that much over this."
"Drinkability: Yes sir, Australian for... wait, that's one of the others. Another forgettable member of a seemingly endless parade of lagers."
"MOuth: Very light bodie, good and gentile bitternnesss ideal for a good sunny day or take some six or box @ the bech"
"Another boring euro-lager."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy a few of these at a BBQ or after an afternoon of yard work. Very drinkable and refreshing"
"Smell is kinda neat, has a lighter zip feel to it. Some may negatively call it the alka seltzer affect. Taste comes through, delightfully light and zesty, like a pilsner should be. This is a good introductory style to a decent pilsner. Stays drinkable throughout, little heft left on the palate."
"Drinkability: not great, not horrible. If I had to choose a green-bottle pilsner to drink with a burger at an outdoor restaurant, I would probably not choose this one. But it would be better than no beer at all."
"Overall, I thought it was a good pilsner and wouldn't mind kicking back with a couple of friends. Nothing astonishing, but hey, who needs astonishing all the time? Refreshing is the key word here."
"Overall this was a pleasant surprise. It is really not a true pilsner, but it is a tasty pale lager."
"Taste is toasty and rich, pretty nice and super drinkable. Very good for a macro beer and it really shows how good even mediocre german beer is, this blows away the american macro competition."
"D: Very easier to drink german beer."
"This was a rather mediocre beer. Poured an average yellow with about a 3 inch head that quickly melted to almost none. There was carbonation that appeared almost like a soft drink. The smell was grassy with a sharp almost clover odor. The taste was almost identical to the smell. One thing I rather liked about it was that there was no metallic flavor. Often times in these more ""macro"" brews there's a metallic or a skunky flavor. This had neither. It's what it is. It's definitely better than the average macro, but on the other hand, there are many other german pilsners I'd rather have."
"For me this beer is a good session beer with a light body. There are better German Pilsners out there, but this is a great replacement to the vast majority of mainstream largers in the supermarkets at the moment."
"Drinkability- It's a great beer that I purchase a lot. Next to Imperial it's my top beer. It has a unique taste that tastes similar to Hacker Pschon. I would recommend to anyone to purchase this beer because it's a good social beer."
"I like it. It just seems like a high quality brew. It has a pale yellow color and tastes crisp and refreshing. The green bottle is the only way to drink this beer as its superior taste led to this conclusion. Anyone who like European lagers should be impressed with this beer."
"Final Thoughts: This is a fairly disappointing beer, and since it seems to be the macro of Germany, I guess I'm not surprised. Bland, boring stuff you'd expect from an adjunct that trades sweet malts for additional hops. I can't really recommend it for any situation where another big name Lager couldn't do the same job, for probably a better price. You will want to avoid."
"Overall, a very average German Pilsener. I would choose it over most light domestic lagers, but not over most German lagers. There are much better examples of this style."
"Decent light pils nose offers moderate depth and complexity. Light in body and not very bready in flavor yet pleasant and fresh. Nose expands with warming, offering a slightly sweet and grainy sense to it. This beer exceeds my recollection for it has been quite a while. Actually improves with a bit of warming. Fairly good drinkability, slightly sweet but not overly so. Not bad."
"D: I'll give this category the highest because it is pretty light and I could drink quite a few of these without being full. Goes down fairly easy."
"From the bottle at a hotel bar in New Jersey, because I didn't feel like ordering a Bud. Poured into a pint glass. Bright yellow color. Fizzy carbonation, with a small head. Looked average. Smell was a bit musty and damp. Taste was not a winner. Somewhat bitter and mostly bland. Mouthfeel was watery going down but a bit thick on the palate afterwards. I drank it because I ordered it, but that's not to say that I loved it. Nothing about this beer makes it a memorable German pils."
"D: I could drink plenty if that's what was being offered, completely agreeable."
"Thin, kind of skunky, and a bit of a metallic aftertaste. You could drink worse, and on my budget I usually do. Unless it's on sale, there are much better alternatives for the money."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, Beck's had a golden-yellow appearance. The slightly bitter smell hinted at what was to come. The beer had a watery feel and was overwhelmingly bitter. Too bitter. I can't imagine having more than one or two. There may be people who appreciate a really bitter beer, but I don't, so..."
"D Not my favorite, . The aftertaste I did not care for,"
"I like German Pils but this was a disappointment and rather lackluster. The price is outrageous for what you get."
"i'd say this beer is a few rungs above budweiser about the same level as heineken i would never buy this beer again unless i was at some sort of bar that only sold macros i'd rather save the money and buy an 18 of high life or buy an actual half way decent beer"
"Conclusion: Significantly better than a Budweiser, an MGD, a Coors, a Heiniken, etc, but nothing special and there are better ""big"" import brands than this (I'd personally probably pick Lowenbrau and Stella over this)"
"Speaking of the proverbial road, the first time that I had this beer was on a train en route from Frankfurt to Prague. The rather polite partying German students in my car shared their tall cans of Beck's with me. Sehr Gut! As for the beer now, it's a so-so German Pils, nothing too off-putting, nor anything really that remarkable, but it does its job as refreshment for the time being, so there's that."
"got this in a mixed beer bag, 6 different beers for 10$ canadian"
"I like this beer, the first German beer I had I think. I like the beer because it is really a definitive lager..actually maybe a Pilsner. Nice dark golden pour with a thin head. Smells a mix between sweet malty and flowery... Tastes really clean, crisp with a great balance between maltiness and hoppiness. Medium bodied, great drinkability all year round."
"D - Very drinkable. Especially in the summertime."
"I thought this was an alright beer, but didn't really care for the hop profile. I also felt that the carbonation and hops made for an excessively bitter flavor. Nonetheless, I drank several and enjoyed them. Give it a whirl and see for yourself."
"D- Usually my choice in restaraunts when faced with the Macro barrage. Pretty easy to drink but I dont go out of my way for it."
"Its certainly upsetting when you are stuck at a bbq where the only beer options are yuengling, bud light, and their ilk. I tried a Beck's for the first time in this situation. While there isn't a ton that can be said good about not, not a whole lot is so bad either. The flavor and aroma aren't offensive as you find with most American macro lagers.. the flavor is farily crisp and not dominated by adjunct (which is sad that ""not dominated by corn"" is a plus, possibly even something to be considered above average). Mostly the beer is mediocre with no highlights. It is failry light which lends itself to drinkability. Its better than aforementioned alternatives, but I would never, ever go out of my way to buy it."
"I would definitely recommend this beer."
"D: drank this a little to warm just so i can taste it more but enjoy this beer when it is cold it makes it way better"
"Malt is a bit stale tasting and have a rough feel to them like they are not of the highest quality. Grassy and spicy hop flavor is there and is actually somewhat pleasant. I was pretty much ready to bash on this beer going in, but it is actually not too bad. If this is Germany's Budweiser, I would trade macros with them in a heartbeat. If properly stored and drank fresh, it is not too shabby."
"Going to give it another try in 12 pack because I am disapointed from this 24oz super size bottle, I mean dos equis was better."
"A clear pale golden color body with a small fizzy white head , medium to high carbonation. Aroma of floral hops and faint skunk pee. Flavor is lightly sweet with the typical Euro lager hop notes, very boaring and not very good, light body , crisp mouthfeel . Drinkable but nothing I would buy again."
"Had this on tap in germany. available at almost every place and is usually the one beer when only one is available. Better than one might expect but still not great. However, a great alternative to budweisser (American) or even stella artois. Get it if you can."
"But this one is legendary."
"D: An average german pilsener - not bad, but it doesn't stand out."
"Pretty smooth, a tad bitter but definitely good-tasting."
"Drinkability: I admit that this beer got better as I drank it, but I did not find anything special about it."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Hardly much of an aroma to speak of. Has a crisp, clean taste with a mild bitter aftertaste. Watery feel in the mouth. Drinkability is decent. Overall not a bad choice but nothing great."
"Poured from a bottle. Clear yellow colour with moderate white foam. Smell is like bland beer - some citrus, some hops, but otherwise grainy. Taste is watery - kind of a tinny pils. Much better pils out there. Ok drinkability. A good choice for a neighboorhood barbecue where I had it, but otherwise, not the best beer to enjoy by yourself."
"The beer pours a good head, but the color is wrong for my favorite beer gender (aka style). I can smell the traditional German smell, but it is weak. The taste is as weak as the smell. The German taste is there, but... Yes, it is carbonated, but not ""highly"" as many state. It does go down good, but a German Pilsener is no drinking game beer. Drink a different German beer."
"Drinkability: Of the major macros, it's probably my favorite. But that's not saying much."
"It seems to be brewed with the intention of a clean and inoffensive palate. It achieves this, but it's a pretty bland beer, and there are lots of flavourful examples of the style."
"I would almost describe this as a picturesque pilsner, if only its pastel-yellow body weren't just a bit too pale and its bubbles a bit too large. The head is mightily impressive, though, snow white and smooth with great retention. I am less captivated by the aroma, dominated by corn and metal with a frail yet off-puttingly sharp edge of leafy hops and a suggestion of honey. Bizarrely sweet on the palate with an unpleasant sulfurous/fusel alcohol quality that interferes with an otherwise pleasant toasted grain flavor. Hops are nondescriptly bitter and especially noticeable in the finish, which is dry but not as dry as it ought to be. The carbonation is good - not too sharp, not too soft - but on the whole the body feels a bit thick. I must say I found this beer to be much worse than I expected, and my expectations were pretty low. It's not awful - about on par with Heineken, I'd say - but it's a bit nasty and it has no real character, unless the overlay of bad adjunct flavors on top of good malt flavors counts as character."
"This really deserves to be approached on its own merits and its place in beer society. This beer is great for a BBQ beer or something to drink whilst watching the game or at the local bar. There is nothing in this beer that would hold beer snobs interest long enough to finish a glass."
"Not bad, but not great. It is refreshing and would be fine for a hot day. Also, there's a high chance of skunking due to the use of green bottles."
"D: As far as mass-produced lagers go, this is actually pretty good. It's certainly leagues ahead of any American macro. In fact, if it were less expensive, I'd make it my go-to cheap beer. But it can't hold a candle to the better German beers."
"If you want a refreshing beer, go for a witbier or hefeweizen. This is just bland, but it works in the category its supposed to be in, I guess."
"This bier has been reviewed to death. The only thing I can say is that Germans don't drink this bier! Its almost impossible to find this one in the hinterland. Tolerable on a hot day if nothing else is available. The German equivalent of Coors, which is not a compliment."
"Very Yellow and uninviting. I really dont get much of anything except malt, skunk, and chlorine (wtf) from this bier's aroma. It tastes just like any other pilsener, perhaps less, but when you're talking about a beer as unappealing as this one is, who cares. Light, and drinkable.This beer is functional in beer pong, and flip cup... anything other than that and you have better options, even among the macro euro-trash."
"-RR"
"D - Extremely drinkable on a summer day. Session beer, sure. Something I'm going to buy all the time, no way."
"Final Thoughts - This is my Dad's go to beer and it has a fondness in my heart. Going home for the holidays, I can always expect a 12 in the fridge, and while visiting family we always pick up a case. Not the best beer out there, but my favorite of the large mass market European companies."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery with lots of carbonation. This is close to just being carbonated water. Beck's is decent or maybe tolerable at best but compared to the typical BMC product, I'd probably prefer this. Not particularly good but not too offensive either."
"Drinkable: quite, this to me could be an everyday beer if I didn't like some others. Beck's isn't my first choice, but I do buy it from time to time along with Lowenbrau, Dab, Holsten, and Warsteiner when I want a German beer without needing to go on a long search for one."
"i like german pilseners.. there are better one out there.. but for the price and a quick cold beer with some respect its not too bad.. yellow when poured.. not much head.. tastes good light hops.. not over powering.. refreshing on the most part.. would drink it again.."
"Some grainy malts, a bit of hay and honey. Meh, tastes like an average lager, I wouldn't call this a pilsener, compared to other german lagers this fails."
"D - Drinkable enough. Part of the problem with Beck's is that it's lumped in with any number of other fine German Pils when at best this is just an above average Euro pale lager. This 24 oz has been quite easy to get though, but I'd never want to drink it all night."
"Sorry, not a fan, save your money for something better folks."
"Drinkability - again, another selection that can be passed over for better. I suppose putting a few of these away wouldn't be that bad, just not great."
"Fairly standard when compared to other authentic German pilsners. What stands out is a very rich boquet of floral hops that hint toward fruitiness, herbal notes, and a nectar-like character that accents the sweet pilsner malt flavors and aromas. Light sulfers give the beer teeth, but that floral hop aroma and flavor supresses any would-be match stick sulfery character. Round and moderately creamy with a mild hint of grain astringency. Finishes crisp and with a balanced hop-malt lingering. A terrific small beer."
"D- BMC beer drinkers be praised because you have something else to fall back on. After a year and halfof drinking good micros i think this sets me back."
"Fairly fizzy and mouth cleaning - hot weather lawnmower beer here. Loved this ""top' beer in 1985, not so much now."
"D. A solid pilsner. Nothing spectacular and overpriced, but it doesn't really dissappoint."
"This beer is not representative of the country it is brewed in. The worst German beer I have ever had."
"==="
"Light gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is metallic and a tad of skunk.Taste is a little swwet and malty.I was expecting a skunkfest with this but I am pleasantly surprised by it's freshness and drinkability.All in all it's a good beer that I probably would purchase again!!"
"Average German Pilsner. Pours clear gold with a frothy white head. Sweeet and sour aroma of malt, metal, and saaz. Crisp, tangy taste of saaz, with s dry finish. Metal pops up frequently, with a sugary flavor. Not a bad option, just know that this beer packs a serious hangover."
"Taste is light and hoppy on a base of bready malt that is typical German pilsner malty. Mouthfeel is light and there is a sweet note in the aftertaste."
"D - Refreshing on a hot day for sure, ok-beer"
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a large head that receded fairly quickly. The smell is sweet and a little grassy. The taste starts off with a little bit of malt sweetness that gives way to a bit of some hops that linger on the palate. The thinness of the beer and the carbonation make for a crisp beer. The drinkability is also pretty high with this one, not a bad six-pack to grab if you've got something going on and don't want to drop too much money."
"Drinkability: I beleive it is drinkable. One of the best easily available beers to me (big Euro imports). I wouldn't mind drinking this for the night, of course I would rather be tasting more sought after beers in search for something better."
"Had this in a bottle and can, both in the US and in Germany. It pours a light golden color with a fizzing white head. The taste is metallic and bitter for a German beer with only the slightest hint of malt. Beck's by no means has any type of a clean finish, but this is a good beer for people who want to believe that they are truly drinking a German imported beer. Within Germany, the stature of this beer can be equated to our opinion of Budweiser. It's a ""gateway"" beer to bigger and better things."
"D: A forgettable member of the German Pils family. There are better bets in this style at Beck's price point."
"D: Yet another thin, macrobrewed stew of a beer. No taste, no personality, no nothing. Totally uninteresting."
"In all, not a bad German macro, but nothing to raise the eyebrows either. Standard, decent, refreshing pilsener worth having, but not one to go out of one's way for. It's nothing close to Paulaner, Erdinger, or Ayinger."
"Boring, but certainly better than those horrible danish lagers (Carlsberg, Tuborg etc). Becks has a pure, ""clean"" taste, and that bitterness is pretty refreshing. Pretty cheap too."
"Drinkability: 5.0! So easy to drink it's scary. Goes down like a carbonated soft drink, I can easily enjoy 3 in a sitting and finish the rest soon after."
"This isn't really a bad beer, as far as the large brands I might prefer it over an American Macro Lager. However, if I want a German Pilsner, or any German Lager for that matter, there are so many other choices that are much more superb. This is more of a cost saving choice, and I bet I can find something for around the same price that I would enjoy more in the same style or any other style out there."
"The taste is similar, some light grain and sharp, green grass. It has fairly lasting flavour, but this is mild, lacking character and is rather sharply unpleasant, a tad rough, and very bland. The bitterness is a bit rough and lacks real flavour."
"D. This has a good drinkability and overall not a bad beer. A good beer to have for a night then maybe get it again in a month or two"
"Drinkability is moderate. Easily sessionable, but skunked flavor will bother most. This one I don't mind, but it really isn't that great of a beer."
"Pours bright golden with small lively head lots of carbonation from the bottom and clinging to the sides. The smell is strong with a clear honeylike bite of pale malt. The flavor is strong and honeyish, with a satisfying, strong pale malt character and light hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a little hop bitterness."
"overall bland and not worth the time."
"From the bottle. Golden color, small white head. This is the kind of beer I liked the more I had it but it is very limited. Some sweet malts, grassy and pretty crisp and refreshing. Not bad. However I have had my fair share of skunked bottles so that's a concern."
"Poured a light golden yellow with a decent white head. Aroma was malts and cereal grains with a slight skunkiness. Not much flavor, some cereal grains and a metallic taste. Well carbonated, but a little on the watery side. This would be okay on a hot day, not much on the flavor department."
"This is a fairly solid european style lager. Pours a light gold into my glass with a frothy head and decent lacing. Good carbonation and an overall pleasant look. The aroma is typical of this style with a touch of bitterness and hoppy accents. Clean mouthfeel that finishes with ease. The flavor is very good, I enjoy these types of lagers much more than their American cousins. Overall a nice average beer that always tastes good to me."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied an quite zesty. I love pilseners but this hardly qualifies."
"Ehh, I'm very iffy on this one. I normally like German beers but I'm a little turned off on this one. Has a very bold taste and kinda high on the carbonation. I prefer the Becks Dark.... If your looking for a good German beer, I would recommend Warsteiner or even better Warsteiner Dunkel (dark). I guess I just prefer darker beers in general; without a doubt regardless this is worth a shot if you haven't tried it before."
"Bland, mediocre, and nothing special..."
"I could certainly drink a few of these down, but I'd much rather pour something else."
"Pours an extremely light yellow color with some decent initial head, which goes away very quickly. It has a nice scent, a light straw aroma with nice peppery overtones. Good taste, crisp and clean, a little spicy, but a bit weak. It does go down quite smoothly."
"Nothing about this beer will blow anyone away, but really, you could do way worse. My impression is that it will be a little better from the can vs. the bottle."
"Not bad for a mass-produced Euro-brew. There are, however, better brews of this ilk just as accessible and in same price range. There are, on the other hand, worse. Easy enough to drink, though tiresome/bland after awhile. It is what it is..."
"D- I'm honestly surprised how much I liked this beer. It's a very refreshing beer. It is kindof boring, but it was good."
"D: Price and refreshing quality makes this a decent session. Still, I prefer Beck's Dark if I must encounter Beck's. Not a great beer but tolerable."
"D- With a great flavor and a light body, this one is a good candidate for being a session beer. I would be able to enjoy this one throughout a night without the need to change. Very decent brew!"
"Notes: Not sure if I got a bad bottle but it was consumed well before the freshness date on the label."
"I used to think this was a good german beer, then I grew up. The only reason I drink this in bars is because in the Bronx, it's the only german beer that is served. That's why I go to the Heidelberg Restaurant in NYC, who's tap beer collection would make you slap your momma."
"D- Not a bad drinkability, but in a world with so much variety, one must never settle."
"D - This is a descent German import. It is session-worthy."
"Not the greatest of beers. but damn it is drinkable . A solid pislner despite the naysayers."
"The only saving grace for this beer is that at least it doesn't have any offensive skunky/sulphury notes commonly found in cheap pilseners. Otherwise, it's an incredibly dull and lifeless beer. It's aroma is its best attribute."
"M&D- Feels and drinks like mineral water. easy to drink too many when thirsty."
"D: Not easy to drink. I was very disappointed after hearing good things about it from friends."
"What can I say, it's no world class pilsner, but it does fine with washing down a burger. I actually went for some Sunshine Pils, but grabbed this out of nostalgia when no Sunshine was yet to be found. Not a worthy substitute by any means."
"Another crappy pale Euro lager ... woohoo! I used to like this stuff some 25 years ago when it was about the only imported stuff around. I haven't tried this in nearly two decades. Needless to say, my tastes have matured a bit. Here are some random thoughts: It's pale; it smells a bit skunked up; it has an astringent lemony bite that makes it ever so slightly interesting; it has a chemical sourishness characteristic of so many other macro lagers that does not make it interesting; it has almost zero hoppiness; it has plenty of cooked vegetable; it is bad, but there are a lot worse, and what more can I add to the collective wisdom? Avoid it."
"D: Not bad on a hot sticky day when served ice cold. Not a beer I would self select but average to above average for the style."
"Poured into a pils glass and received a solid head (it did die quickly) on top of a light gold, seethru body. A grainy smell with some hops mixed in, but nothing really nose-catching. This has the dryness of a pils, but it isn't that good. The hops don't deliver any remarkable taste, and it goes down a little rough instead of having a nice smoothness to it. There's no real flavor to this beer, just a ""euro-macro"" that is a tad edgier than a American macro. Not horrible, but there's no real point in drinking this."
"I don't really want to drink a lot of these, but I could."
"This is a horrible impression of a lager/pilsner. I don't understand how this became a popular import. The Germans don't even drink this crap. If this beer tastes like this in its homeland, then the export version has to suck ultra royally. Avoid this monstrosity!"
"This is a distinctly sub par lager. It's not horrible, but it leaves a lot to be desired. The beer poured with a very pale straw color and a tiny head. It smelled of a touch of skunkish pale malts and a touch of hops. The taste was rather flat and bland, palatable, but nothing special. If Pilsner Urquell wasn't available, I'd pick Heineken over this."
"Great for fans of Heineken. I've had better beers but this is fairly cheap and good for a daily drink. It is a nice golden color that you see with Heineken. Not overly bubbly. Not a very harsh first taste and finished smooth. Great served extremely cold."
"This is my ideal thirst-quencher: its tastes is light and mostly pleasing. It has some body to go along with the malty/sweet flavor. The only downside is that it's not cheap-cheap, but rather imported."
"D - I've heard so many people sing the praises of this beer. I don't think it lives up to the hype, but don't get me wrong. It's pretty good, and I would be content with drinking another one."
"A glass of beer that you will be happy to see empty"
"This beer is clearly a pilsner, as opposed to another Euro pale lager. It actually has discernible hops and malt, but the flaws and handling drag this one down. It'd be pretty decent if it wasn't in a green bottle and mishandled along the trip over."
"D- Im not sure if Heineken tastes like Becks or the other way around. If you like the Heineken flavor, buy Heineken. I woudnt turn down drinking this Becks. But unless I got a good deal, I dont think I would buy it again."
"I can honestly say this is one beer that I can't say many nice things about. Having had the taste of a Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale still fresh on my tongue the last time I had one of these I hadn't realized just how horrible this beer really did taste on its own. Beck's has a yellow color, a strong smell of citrus. The taste is rather bitter like a grapefruit. The feels like seltzer water on the tongue. Not a beer worth drinking by itself. Not a memorable beer. I'm going to finish this one just to get it out of the fridge."
"First off, Heineken comparisons are bad, Beck's is much better and cleaner tasting. The beer I tasted came in a 1 pint can, poured into a Lager Glass. Aroma is pretty strong, moderate citrus hops, very very light malt. Also smelled something raisin-ey or possibly red wine. Relativly generous size creamy white head when pouring. Color is a light yellow, and not paticularly attractive. I must say that it left pretty decent lacing around my glass. Flavor is short in duration, and a bit watered down in taste, but still pleasant. The hops come throught the most, and I would guess that this would go quite well with food. By itself, like I said, it is a bit boring and watery. Texture is watery again and a bit on the dry side of things. Carbonation is soft and the finish is extremely clean, very nice. Pretty good overall, but not a super-premium lager."
"D: I could've had two if the server ever came back. Not bad."
"Not much to get excited about, but still IMHO better than the reviews say... just a pretty good pils."
"Poured pale yellow in color with a white head that didn't seem to last. Smell faint hops not much else. Taste a little sweetness and a bitter finish and not much of an aftertaste. Mediem carbonating light in body. Drinkabilty was ok I would choose this one over an amrican macro any day."
"A drinkable beer that is OK for any occasion, but the big thing with this beer is it's commercial taste. There are many more flavorful beers to choose from."
"Drinkability is so-so, never my first choice. But to go alongside a casual meal of burgers and fries, Becks does the trick."
"Drinkability: I have drank this beer for quite some time but never really sat back and reviewed it. Its flaws are numerous, largest being the skunked smell from the green bottles most likely. personally i can drink it but i wouldnt recommend it to a friend."
"Eh. I can't really see myself buying this again."
"Poured into a pint glass. Definite skunky pilsner aroma. There is a faint whiff of malt that gives a little backing to the aroma. This malt also helps a very little bit in the mouthfeel and taste. The is much like St. Pauli's Girl. A boring, skunky macro pilsner."
"A little on the malty side, this is the type of beer you can drink all day and have a very average experience. No real highs or lows. All in all, I'd call this an overpriced average pilsener and say that when nothing else is available, you can pick up a 6 pack of Beck's and have a really average time."
"How this is the number imported beer from Germany is beyond me! Even with the AB/Inbev deal, Beck's still tastes over-processed and skunked. Pass."
"Vivid yellow, moderately bubbly body with a short white head...looks crisp...metallic ping that is Becks...clearly a grain presence...aggressive start and quick finish...most directly a back-of-tongue effervescence...slightly acidic moments but a generally clean flavor, great for partying...a classic for me, not as a session beer but definitely a quality macro that packs a cutting, crisp pilsner taste...a slight step from Pilsner Urquell"
"D- a pumped up more german version of our american macros. could be better in alot of ways, BUT it was bred for drinkability."
"D: A good drinking pilsner, which was a nice respite from the fray from some of the bigger beers I have been drinking lately in December. Much better than BMC, but it's important to get it as fresh as possible, I've had bottles that certainly weren't of this quality, so if you find an unskunked bottle, enjoy."
"Drinkability: Good. I can drink these all night in a pinch when there isn't really good beer to be had. Good for what it is."
"Pours clear golden yellow with largish bubbles in body and thin white head that disappears quickly. Soapy aroma with light malt. The initial flavor is malty with lightly bitter aftertaste that is clean and relatively refreshing. Only a hint of the soapy flavor noted in the nose. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Overall, a decent beer to go with grilled chicken orsomething. Not very interesting otherwise."
"Pours a rather light golden colour with a rather thick frothy head that stuck around for quite a while. Smelled very yeasty and fruity and a little earthy. Rather uneventful and nondescript for taste and had a mild bitterness. It was a rather fizzy beer which I am not used to drinking. I could have this one again but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. If it was at a BBQ and in the esky I'd certainly help myself."
"D - Fairly high I'd say, it's very inoffensive and easy to consume. Overall nothing distinct, and the next time I drink one it'll probably be because I forgot what it tasted like."
"I certainly opt for this over U.S. macro lagers, but I wouldn't say this is a particularly good pilsener. Just slightly below average across the board."
"D:	A refreshing beer that is easy to drink and, while not being anything special, does not disappoint the senses. I drink this as a session beer quite often as it is always available and is slightly superior to many of the typical euro macro lagers."
"D - good enough beer to drink all night."
"D- I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. The Munich malt tasted fresh and had a nice flavor of a good Kolsch. The other flavors were a bit muted and the hops were almost nonexistent. No off flavors in the beer but a bit dull."
"sadly, this was the best option available at a ritzy wedding and i was forced to revisit it. clear straw in appearance with an ok white head. nose was mostly vegetal and grassy w/some skunk to it. just a hint of malt in the taste with a moderate bitterness. light and crisp mouthfeel. not bad, but not that good either. still better than an american macro lager, though."
"This is ok but not great. I prefer ales to lagers, so maybe I dont appreciate this. But judging by other ratings, I must have got it right. Typical macro lager that pours yellow and fizzy without much aroma or taste. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability is okay only because the beer is not that offensive. One of the first widely available imports."
"Had this for the first time last night has a golden color with a white head. Smell was not so good maybe mine was bad because it was smelling skunky. Taste I was not impressed with it at all skunk. It wasn't bad in my mouth high carbonation. I would possibly try this again but wouldn't drink more than one."
"Tried this at Fredericksburg's Oktoberfest. Pours up pale gold with a creamy head. A slight trace of hops in the aroma, otherwise pretty clean. Crisp taste, with hops finishing on the side of the tongue. It's a bit thin, though. A very nice beer on a hot, humid Texas afternoon."
"And that's where I'll leave it."
"Taste is less malty than I thought; a touch of crispness from hops, some floral hints and no skunk. Malt comes in heavy at the end, making it a bit tough to drink, for me."
"This beer is the epitome of nothingness. There is just absolutely nothing to it. Pours a very light gold, like a bud light. Little head that dissipates fast. no to crappy smell. faintest bit of funk. taste is like carbonated water. BLAH! I only dont rate it worse b/c it is better than something that tastes bad, i suppose."
"Drinkability ,,,, well you see my score, you make the call."
"Not a bad beer,goes down very easy and very refreshing on a hot day,can easily polish of a few of these."
"Pours a clear straw color with a rapidly dissipating head. Within a minute there was no head, no cap, nothing. Almost flat looking except for the tiny carbonation bubbles floating to the top. The smell is a zesty, grassy hop, a bit of that green bottle skunky aroma. The beer is grainy but does have a decent spicy hop taste. The pilsner characteristics do show up but it also has that Euro lager green bottle funk. The feel is light and well carbonated, has a slightly dry finish. A decent beer, probably one of the better choices you may have at a crappy gas station store. A notch better than the typical Euro lagers."
"D: Definitely easy to drink, as I was through a few of these fairly quickly."
"Overall a good pils. This beer gets a bad reputation I believe because of it mas produced status. Not a bad drinker. Certainly not the most complex pils, but certainly worth drinking in a pinch."
"This is one of the better bitter, dry beers out there. If you want taste, look elsewhere, but that isn't exactly the idea with this beer. The price is high, and value below average, but I will surely drink this on tap in the future, as it is widely available and makes for easy drinking."
"Poured out of a 24oz bottle. Aroma is kinda skunked and bland upfront. Taste is much of the same. Very odd aftertaste. Best before date is 2/08. Regardless, the taste is pretty dull and bland. If you took away any of the skunk, it would still be dull and bland. Almost not worth drinking."
"what you get just isn't worth the expense."
"The beer is a great alternative to other ""pilsner"" beers, as it actually uses the malts and hops to its advantage to make a well balanced beer. This is a good alternative to other beers out there, but it still has its weaknesses in lack of body and over carbonation."
"Appearance is a light golden with a head that dissapates quickly. Aroma and taste is light and refreshing with light malt and hops having the right amount of carbonation for that crisp finish. Having a light - medium mouthfeel it's not a bad beer, but I couldn't drink it as a session."
"inoffensive summer refresher. a far better alternative to mass-market beers if you're looking for a beer to accompany casual tv watching or cooking. not worth a whole lot of analysis, but not bad either. (but apparently i need another 46 characters worth of analysis, which this last sentence was not.)"
""
"Light blonde in color with a nice little soapy head, this beer is more pilsner than pale lager. A little spicy hop and straw will do that, even if it the flavor goes blank for a brief second. In short, a pilsner for the masses. This might be the number one German beer sold in America, but look around a little and you'll find a number of tastier German pilsners for a comparable price."
"I had heard many many great things about Beck's, so naturally I had to try one. Unfortunately, I was not able to add any great comments. This is just an alright beer. The colour is a nice translucent golden colour, the aroma was neither appealing or repulsive with a slight malty smell. The flavour was mild with some grassiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with just the right amount of carbonation."
"Pale straw with a fizzy white head, not much retention or lacing to speak of. It has sort of a generic Pilsner aroma; grassy and ambiguously organic. The taste is a bit fuller and richer than, say, Heineken, and it's fairly clean without any strong off-flavors. The hops come out quite a bit in the end, but lack any real complexity or distinct character. Body is very light and crisp, though the carbonation feels a bit harsh to me. Not a bad beer in all, better than many macro lagers, but not great by any means."
"While far from a breakthrough beer, it's a good standby if you're in a bar that has little else to choose from. Beck's is like the VW Jetta: it's nothing too special, yet no one will think you crazy for getting one."
"The taste is really nice. Is not a hard taste, very easy to drink, This is not the best beer i have taste but i could drink this more often."
"Overall: Becks is a well-balanced beer. It can be refreshing in a hot day. On the other hand it has not a distinctive character. Too common to get a higher rating."
"A crisp clean finishing beer without much else. The smell comes off with very light pilsner malt flavor and a hint of DMS, overall pretty weak. Taste is very lightly malty, like wonder bread. Hops come off as slightly spicy but mostly just contribute a balancing bitterness. It's not a bad taste, but like the smell it's weak, and very uninteresting. The carbination is bouncy on the tongue and the mouthfeel overall is good. I would take this over a BMC or maybe for something refreshing and mild, but not my favorite beer by a lot."
"d - just enough of a ""beer-like experience"" to finish the last becks I'm likely to buy."
"Drinkability - I suppose this would be a good summertime beer to have after mowing the lawn in the hot sun. You could have 5 or 6 and not be bloated... just not my style..."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, its crisp taste may not be complex, but it is pleasant and not overly filling."
"Poured into a pint glass. Lots of foamy white head at first, but it quickly dissipated. The beer itself was extremely light in color, almost transparent. It smelled a bit like grain and hops, no malt. Taste had very little malt flavor but a surprising amount of hops (at least when compared to American macro lagers). Taste was all right for what it is, though this is definitely not as malty as other German pilseners. Mouthfeel was soda-like, making the beer as drinkable as a Coke."
"Pours a straw color with barely any bubbles and a practically nonexistent head. Has a grainy, almost broth-like smell to it that is really off-putting. Floral hops barely make their way through the chicken stock. There is honestly not much to the taste but the sweet. There's a good deal of grain with some mild maltiness. Hops come out in the finish just a tad. Mouthfeel is kind of syrupy. Carbonation is nearly absent, but what is there is harsh. All around, this is poor. Compared to this, their Beck's Dark is a masterpiece."
"D - I'm not sure what the big deal is about Beck's, it reminds me of a more bitter Heineken, which I suppose excites some palates, but not particulary mine."
"No flaws other than extreme boringness."
"Typical Euro pilsner. Nothing impressive. Nothing really bad either... just unimpressive. Next, please..."
"D - Very drinkable, light, heartburn may occur after drinking about 12. :)"
"D- Ridiculously easy to drink and inoffensive. What most macros probably aim for, but I know of much better ways to spend my money­."
"D: Is it good enough to drink again? Yes, it is. Though my preference is for beer styles different than this, I believe Beck's is a good pilsener and one I'd have another of. Thanks to my office manager for picking up a 6-pack so I could give it a try from a new perspective."
"This is one of my favourite session beers, largely because its readily available where I'm from (Newcastle) and pretty inexpensive. I think its pretty well balanced with a big hoppy character that's well integrated. The aroma is a bit stinky but that's just the hops I think. I like its simplicity and crispnesswhich is why its a quaffer. It's not complex so there's not much to think about and I guess its a bit on the macro side but I drank the review beer with some chicken and black bean sauce and the bitter crispness cut through the meal and stood up afterwards. Sure there are much better pilseners but this is a handy barbecue companion."
"tasted much better than it smelled.sweet fairly smooth..some bitterness toward the end of a swallow that would allow this to be called a Pils I guess. Ok..but would certainly go for a czech pils before trying another Beck's"
"pours a light golden color with a nice frothy white head. which laces quickly, mild carbonation continues. the smell of hops is probably the only thing thats apparent other than water. first thing i notice is a slight ""skunkiness"" to it. not a whole lot of taste, nothing bad but nothing that makes me want alot more. mouth feel and drinkability are great i could drink it all day long since it doesn't have a bad aftertaste or too strong of an alcohol bite. its a beer thats fun to drink every now and then but not every day"
"Pours a clear very pale yellow/gold with a medium head that leaves a small amount of lacing. The smell is very 'skunky",but that's typical with this beer. No other scents are really detectable. The taste is weak,thin, with sweet malt and a mild hoppiness. Not impressive and just another macro lager. The m/f is light and weak with very little flavor. Not a good beer and for the price you can buy quality craft beer."
"Had this with Pizza and it was something that I had not tried before. I figure I would try it since it was German beer. I was not to crazy about it. The date due on it was Sept 07 and it smell skunked. Bit hoopy. light, nice head, not sure on the lace, I had it in a plastic cup. Golden light color. I didn't like it that much and wouldn't plan on buying it again. For a german beer I would think it would better."
"The taste is quite similar to the smell. Big grains, corn, and other flavors, lightly sweetened and somewhat skunky. The finish is smooth though, making it palatable. Mouthfeel is a bit flat and thin. But this beer is certainly drinkable. I usually try and drink it still in the bottle at a crowded bar, where I'm not as concerned about flavor. Putting it into a mug and enjoying it at home (as I did the other night) isn't really recommended."
"I've sampled Beck's many times, both from can and bottle, and have never really been impressed. While I don't consider it the worst offender in terms of mass-produced beers, I can still find no way of understanding how this has become Germany's number one selling beer. It certainly wouldn't be my first choice if I were living over there..."
"Pours out to a decent yellow with a two-finger head that subsides gradually. The smell is quite thin with a tiny bit of hops. The taste is alright, but nothing special. You can taste a bit of the hops though its rather faint. The mouthfeel is rather thin, but the head makes it more interesting than the average macro. In all, a decently drinkable beer. Quite nice when it's cold."
"D - Highly drinkable; the smell wasn't too great but the taste was fine (although nothing to write home about). Dry aftertaste not overpowering. Overall, a fine beer."
"Drinkability is good."
"D - Pretty good, but the dryness and lack of visual flare are strikes against it."
"Overall: Not the most remarkable pils out there, but a solid example of the style and mild enough to act as a crossover beer. I can easily see myself drinking a lot of these if nothing better were available. Worth a try."
"Prost!"
"In my opinion, Beck's is one of the best and most reasonably priced macro-lagers available. Extremely drinkable and tasty, my friends and I will drink this anytime over the Heinekens, Amstels and Buds of the world. When quantity is valued over quality, I don't believe you're sacrificing too much with Becks."
"It pours a pale honey light coloration with a light crisp head. A bit skunky, but better than many lagers. It starts with a light sweetness, but finishes with a strong dry hoppy taste. Excellent balanced and smooth mouthfeel and is very easy to drink and enjoy in quantity, as well as one with a nice meal."
"D- poured into the glass its a much better beer, against the other macros i would definitely choose this, but the grainy dry hoppy sicklyness in the taste would not turn this into a session beer for me. Not bad"
"Drinkability: yep it's good!"
"A pale yellow pour with not much head, not much retention, and not much worth commenting on. Smells of grassy grains, but not well done like others in its genre. The taste begins as sweet and tapers into a mild, water-based flavor. Mouthfeel follows suit with mediocrity. You can drink quite a few of these if you want, but it depends on if you want to drink beer as opposed to enjoy it."
"Out of a nitro tap, this beer is a whole different animal. Opposed to the bitter taste out fo a can, from the tap, it has more fo a honey wheat taste to it. Almost a clear yellow color with a decent head. Doesn't smell like much of anything and tastes a little watered down but still pretty good. Not too bad compared to other german imports."
"Party beer with class. It says I'm too cool for heineken but not above having a terrible hangover tomorrow."
"Beck's was light golden in color with a white head. The head was medium in size, but was soon reduced to a very thin spotty layer with very little lacing. The aroma was light malt and some floral hops. The taste was crisp with a little sweet malt and a funky hop flavor. The finish was dry with a slight metallic twang. The body was medium-light with plenty of carbonation. It's drinkable, but not the best pilsner out there by a longshot."
"Poured from it's 16oz can. Pours a pale straw yellow color with a small fizzy head that quickly dissapears into a sporadic lacing. Aroma is clean with a lot of sweet grain. Taste is more grain with a slightly spicey hop finish. Overall, this is a decent German Pils that is pretty drinkable."
"12 oz. bottle, best before 06.2007. Pours a golden color, very clear. Perhaps just a shade darker than the usual macros. Lots of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Nice fluffy white head holds together better than most macros. Slightly skunky, floral and earthy aromas. Pale malt flavor combines with adjunct sweetness. Earthy and musty flavors follow as well. There is enough bitterness. Not crisp and clean and snappy like a good pilsner. Light body, but no too terribly fizzy. There is more flavor here, so maybve a small step above most macros."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"¡Salud!"
"Taste is thin and watery. Pretty sweet, a bit of nuttiness and a soapy metallic acidity that's probably hops. Really, really thin and boring. Body is weak and lifeless, with a dry finish. This one's tough to have more than one at a time, not recommended if you like flavour in your beer."
"My first. And thus a favorite of sorts. But, as much as I wanted it to be, it just isn't the best. Far from it. Beck's has an odd yellow (sometimes green tinted?) color in the glass and a minimal head. Nose is all hops (almost to skunk in the bottle). Taste is also very spicy hops, but with a fruity flavor that mellows slightly over time. Malt is present in taste (especially as beer bubbles in glass for awhile), but never overpowers the hops flavor. Apparently the beer was highly hopped so it could be imported to the US way back when. That's a distinctive taste. The bottle is attractive (the photo above does not reflect the current labeling) and the name is synonymous with German Purity Law brewing. It's a classic. A ""macro"" import. And deserves is popularity. But there are better Germans out there... Even better Becks (see ""Gold"" and ""Oktoberfest""). If you can get it on tap, it's much better (less skunk)."
"This is poured into a pilsner glass with a nice white foamy head. The color is light straw with good carbonation. The smell is faint pale malt and spicy hop. The taste is crisp and clean, but very thin body. The nice bitterness in the brew is the only thing that makes this macro a decent choice is @ a big club."
"In Australia, Becks is brewed locally under license, and is generally quite approachable. This bottle originated in Bremen, and had lost a lot in transit."
"In the mouth it is ligt on the palate and is highly carbonated. A little too much in my opinion. Carbonation takes away from the flavor of the beer. Feels like sprite or tonic water on the palate, but easy to drink and kinda hits the spot on a hot day after work. Prolly won't buy it again because I know that there are much better German Pils on the market. However, I think it can and is a good crossover beer."
"Smell, is a bit dodgy but the Taste I would describe as a ""rising bitterness"" not sure how to translate that into brewspeak. Compared to other eurolagers such as Grolsch or Carlsberg it definitely has more flavour, is quite a harsh one however. I can see where other reviewers get ""metallic"" from, in my view this counts as a postive plus for ""uniqueness"" as the mean taste of Becks does stand it (slightly) apart."
"Drinkability is where it gets its shoes knocked off. After about two youre just sick of the immediate aftertaste, almost to the point of yacking sometimes. Still an interesting product nonetheless."
"I'm generally not impressed by this beer. I would expect a German Pilsener to have atleast some malt aspects instead of just hops. Below average at best."
"After several tastes, I can see why Beck's can be a bit disappointing. Other German macros have produced better renditions of this mass produced style. While not offensive, Beck's is disappointing."
"Part of a 12 variety pack. Dark Green bottle with a best by 08/2006 printed on the label. Pours a bright, clear pale yellow with just a little head even with an aggressive pour. Light floral aroma with some grassy/hay notes. Taste is mostly grainy malts with just a little hop bitterness. Not bad, but for 2 bucks less a six you can get a much better pils at Aldi (Wernesgrener)."
"This beer is a decent macro brew and its one of the beers that first got me interested in learning about beer and digging deeper into the world of beer. Though overtime I have outgrown it. The beer overall is decent, its under-carbinationed and hits the flavor for the times that you just want to chill and grab a quick beer."
"Drinks okay, just not enough character or taste to hold your attention. Certainally rates above BMC & Warsteiner"
"Mouthfeel/Noes - Very thin. Yet finishes crisp. Not as fizzy as you might expect. Drinkable but boring. Below average on the whole."
"Not my favourite lager, but how many times it saved me from being thirsty and/or sober!"
"CRUX: ABOVE AVERAGE ""AVERAGE"" EURO-MACRO HERE. If you drink it out of the bottle, add .5 points to all of my scores. If they are ICE COLD add another .5 point. Beck's really is much more appealing in it's own frosty cold bottle dripping with rivulets of ice cold water."
"The flavor is also rather tame. It has a drinkable quality although it is heavier than the mainstream American lagers. It has a malt emphasis although there is little distinctiveness in the brew.This beer has very minimal hop presence."
"my limit is two."
"Overall. This beer has almost no taste to it, the malty taste is ok though. So i could see many people sucking these down, cuz i could finish this in 5 minutes. But as far as a good beer, no."
" Eric"
"Poured from a green 12oz. bottle with a ""best before date"" of 03-2007. Appearance is crystal clear yellow with a thin and very fizzy bright white head that dissipates almost immediately. Aroma is fairly sweet and malty, faintest hop profile also present. Taste is very much in the same, very light on the tongue with a sweetness about it with a mildly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very light bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation, slightly rough as it washes across the tongue. Drinkability is a stronger point of this beer as I find it refreshing and thirst quenching, with an occasionally appreciable light quality about it without the typical taste of a light macro beer. Would probably purchase again, nice for a hot summer day in the yard."
"Taste was malty sweet with a slight hop bitterness in the finish, but mostly watery and boring. I could taste a very slight skunkiness, but it wasn't too bad. This beer was very light bodied in the mouth and thus pretty easy to guzzle. For this reason I'm giving it an average drinkability. In my opinion, this beer has a little more character than US macros, but it's not as tasty as Heineken."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its not real robust in terms of flavor, but I think its a fair representation of the pilsner style. I would probably have Becks pilsner again, especially since there are not a lot of pilsners to choose from in my local market."
"Pretty good beer, at least by US macro standards. There are far better German beers, but this is worth a try at least once. Its best quality is its drinkability; it's a highly quaffable brew."
"Overall: I must admit that given the high level of advertisement for this beer I was prepared to not like it. However, I find that it appeals to me. In summary, it is quite clean with a nice overall crispness."
"Drinkability - I imagine that fans of the pilsner would enjoy a beer like this, but it would certainly wear on me because of the unfamiliar taste and the lingering bitterness at the end. Not worth the price of the import."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a descent white head that doesnt stick around long. The aroma is mostly biscuity malt, and grain husks, with some slight herbal and spicy bitterness. The flavor is again mostly malty with notes of biscuit and grain husk, as well as some mild spicy and herbal hops...simple and basic but refreshing. The mouthfeel is crisp and sprightly, with high carbonation and drinkability is excellent. A descent lawn mower beer, very refreshing on a hot day."
"This can produced very near draft taste...it was fresh, bright with nobel hops and the Beck special pale malt decoction was detectable in the falvor profile. A light hoppy dry German Pils that has stood the test of time."
"Drinkability - this goes down easy, and can put down several in a session. This is not great beer by any means, but it's not bad, either, and will do when it's all that can found when far from sources of great craft brews. And, certainly I'll take it over the vast majority of Am. Macro Brews."
"Euro-green bottle with silver foil over neck and cap. Pours a clear yellow color with a good sized white head. Smells a bit hoppy and a bit skunky, maybe some malt in the aroma as well. Taste has some hops to it. Tastes ""plain"" - not necessarily a bad thing, nothing unusual, just straight up clean taste. This has an OK mouthfeel and the drinkability is good. This is good, too bad it is priced as a premium import."
"Mouthfeel somewhat creamy which was unexpected, flavor was typical of this henikenesque variety (and I don't hate heiniken). not something i'd session, but i could drink a couple with a steak dinner."
"This poured from the can to a very pale yellow with a thin weak head. Smell is clean with that typical German lager barley malt smell, which is really not bad. Taste is rather watery. Very little body. Not really bad but not really good either. It however bears that virtue of being easy to drink. A good choice if you're given a choice between this and ""The King of Beers"" but with so many better offerings out there, I wouldn't strongly recommend this one."
"I don't know if I'm not only one who notices it, or if there's something wrong with me, but every time I have a Beck's all I can taste and smell is honey. I initially thought I had a weird batch, but it happens every time. It's not totally gross, but it's strange. Aside from that, Beck's tastes like any other macro lager. Certainly not too bad, and even kind of interesting and different, but not at all worth the price."
"Poor flavor (most of the flavor was the skunk, as I think there is no real malt or hops flavor in this beer). I plan to forget this beer and never look back."
"Unsalted Saltine crackers soaked in hop-flavored seltzer. That pretty much sums up this brew for me. Seltzer, crackers, some hops bitterness, guzzleable... nothing to really sing about. Not offensive, but this just barely qualifies as beer. No wonder it's (probably) the best selling German beer in the US. I wonder how many Germans actually drink this stuff."
"Light pale yellow with a big white head that diminishes quickly to almost nothing. Mild malt smell: crackers, white bread, with a hint of hops and that cheap pilsener skunkiness. Pretty bland. Taste is lightly malty, light hops bitterness, mostly just fizzy fizziness with a note of skunk. Mouthfeel is fizzy skunk. Very drinkable, but then, who would want to?"
"A huge step down from the big american non light macros, and that is pretty sad becuase of course those suck for the most part."
"Not a beer I would pick up for sole consumption. Perhaps with a salty and greasy meal?"
"This beer pours a yellow color with a decent sized head from a one pint can that dissipated quickly. Smell is kind of grainy. The taste manages to retain its skunkiness even though I purchased a can to avoid it being light struck from those green bottles Beck's favor. There is a metallic taste that seems to go away after the first couple of sips. Fairly drinkable Euro lager, perhaps a step up from American macros, but not much."
"Taste starts off smooth on the tongue...but at the end, nice bitterness on the back of the throat. Very little carbonation, nice head, a great beer!"
"I think this would taste even more refreshing with a slice of lime on a hot summer's night."
"Taste- good-carbonated, very drinkable, but nothing special. Clear, just a few hop feeels in it, but in the aftertaste there's more, which makes it bitter."
"D - Sure. I could drink a lot of it. Wouldn't want to really. This is perhaps the least reaction I've had to any beer in a long time. I'm not really offended or anything... just so blah about it."
"¡Salud!"
"Taste is the slightest bit intriguing. Have never been a huge fan of Beck's but this drop is okay. It's slightly European, in that there is a fruity hint on the front palatte but subtly so. In this case it may be too subtle as the palatte quickly descends into a standard lagery flavour. It's quite good however - nothing to write your mother about, but very drinkable. Like, it's a nicely even blend of bitter and sweet flavours.Nothing overwhelming (which is really a bad thing, since there's nothing distinctive about it) but certainly drinkable. I'd recommend this for a 'hard-earned thirst' long before I'd recommend Victoria Bitter, for example. But then I wouldn't feed VB to my worst dog who was already dead and rotting and crawling with maggots..."
"Drinkability: Can and have drank lots of these. Never my first or second choice."
"This is actually decently drinkable yet its boring and would really only do the job if you were really thirsty. There are much better offerings out there."
"D - Drinkable Last year I really liked this brew, but now it's hard for me to drink, as well as alot of others."
"This beer was part of a ""German Beer Hall Tour"" mixed pack I received for Christmas. A best before date of 08.2006 is printed on the reverse label, followed by the code L 23559 B."
"Conclusion- It wasn't very interesting, but it wasn't bad at all. Certainly a good ""lawnmower"" type beer. Better than any American attempt a pilsner that I've tried yet. And a much better idea than Heineken if you want to look sophisticated by drinking an import but only know one or two names. All the same, for the price I'd say Czechvar is the pils to buy (or Urquell if you like uneccessary harshness and prefer Heineken to Beck's). I think Stella is slightly better as well. But this does beat every American pils (read Macro) lager I've had. If served this for free I'd be very happy, but there are tons of better (and often cheaper) brews you can usually find. Czechvar was is the superlative beer America's ""Budweiser"" is the mutant bastard version of. Beck's about splits the difference, what Budweiser should realistically taste like considering its so cheaply made and made for such a wide demographic."
"Drinkability: Could drink a bunch but would pick a diff. brew when at the store."
"Overall, Beck's is an OK german pilsner. Beck's Dark is much better."
"Becks rocks. How could this come out so badly on the reviews? It is what it is, a german pils that has a great finish. the head on it is poor, but it is overall a great classic beer. a good beer that can be purchased at the supermarket anywhere, by the way. it is in the same catagory as far as taste goes, as a heineken. very good, smooth finish. no subtle tastes, though. if you haven't tried it, it is a great example of a classic german pils."
"A major dowfall with this beer is cost, in which case if you like stronger dark beers like me, there are better German beers out there for the same price."
"Yeah , drinkable on a hot day , but in racing parlance ""prefer others"""
"Opinion: Well, sadly my previous opinion of this beer holds true. It really isn't that great of a beer. I lived in Germany for a while, and I don't remember this beer being that popular over there either. I would take it over Budmilloors, but if this beer was skunked too...I would probably opt for the water instead. Damn, I'm such a snob!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with ample carbonation. There's actually a nice body to this compared to most Euro lagers. Easy enough to drink..but it really doesn't grab my attention at the same time...just puts me through the motions of drinking it. Worth it if there's nothing else better around."
"Yeah, all-in-all an enjoyable brew. A solid beer, but nothing magical."
"Yeah, this one is now an Euro macro, but it wasnt some hideous monster. Plain, lite straw colored, white head, etc, etc. At least it had some taste, lite malt, lite hop, and the Euro skunk. I could go a session with these (6 pack at a picnic). Except Id rather get something better."
"Can obtained from the discount bin of Liquor Mart (Boulder). Pours a two finger rising white head over a light straw colored liquid. Clear, but not crystal clear. The head settles to a sticky film that hangs over the beer. Smells light and fresh malty that's helped by a fresh flroal hop smell. Somewhat piney, like a sand dune covered with evergreens. Maybe a little bit of dried wood in there, too. Okay, now I got it, it's got a light hint of mango in the smell. Tastes red fruity sweet with mild hop floral and a gentle hop bitter rising late. The carbonation is too strong and my tongue is left with a rising sting from tiny CO2 bubbles forming on my tastebuds. Swirl to release some carbonation. A large head reforms and settles to a sticky mat. A darker hop aroma can now be found. The flavor is watery now with a dark hop ending that's not so pleasant. Oh well, often, releasing carbonation can allow intruiging qualities in a beer to come out. Not this time...note to self, don't drink flat Beck's. Body is actually md light, heavier than I was expecting. But the now tin-like hop flavor is beginning to get to me. Sorry guys, this one just can't be helped. Stamp on the bottom of the can is ""05.2005 A L1474 13""."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, fluffy white head, little bit of lacing. Smell is sweet and honeylike, some hops and definite skunk. Taste is sweet, slight hops in the finish, some skunk once again. Mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation, refreshing but watery. Shitty mass produced euro lager although not as bad as some."
"This isn't great but its often the best of a bad lot at local bars and restaurants, I'll give it a tentative thumbs up, at least among macros."
"Beck's is one of my favorite beers. It tastes a little bit skunky but once you get past that it's really good. I love sipping and enjoying this beer. I buy this every once in a while. Sometimes you have to be in the right mood for Beck's. It never fails to satisfy me."
"Becks pours a light straw colour with an industrial white foam that dissipates into a thin layer in a minute or two. As unimpressive as the head itself is, Becks does leave a nice (if not suprising) lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is what you would expect from any macro-lager; subtle hints of malty sweetness and virtually no hops, and you have to put all your smelling capacity into smelling what is there. That is, you have to smell really, really hard to figure out whats there. Granted, Im doing this review after tasting a bottle of Coopers Extra Strong Ale, but even if I last tasted iced tea, I think that I would review Becks the same: Its a beer for the masses. However, the masses that drink this might in fact be the more demanding members of the masses than those who drink Carlton in Australia, or Bud in the US. Becks, while it does lack some elements of flavour and mouthfeel, does provide a nice, refreshing taste. Is this due in part to the German Purity Laws? I dont know. What I do know is that for an international macrobrew, I am not at all offended by Becks. Im not that impressed, but Im certainly not offended, and that adds to the drinkability which is top-notch. I would be happy if I found a keg of Becks at a summertime, outdoor BBQ."
"Pours with a nice creamy white head settling over clear pale yellow liquid. Nose is of lightly sweet maltiness with a grassy note, light hops. Taste is light bodied, flavors of malt, hay, and restrained but noticable hops, due to the relatively light body. Finishes bitter and clean, with the gentle alcohol level making it a good Summer quencher, easy to drink lots of."
"A decent but not impressive Pilsner type beer."
"Looks like a Pils, but tastes like a bad version of Heineken, as if Heineken is good to begin with. Weak all the way through, not enough malt or hops to give it anything to speak of. There are 11 bottles sitting on my front porch which will probably hit the trash can soon. I hate to waste beer and it amazes me that a brewer that follows the Bavarian purity law can come up with such an awful beer. Don't waste your time."
"This is what's wrong with beer. Back when I started drinking beer (1978) Beck's was one of the few standard great beers. Despite the postings I don't think it's changed much. I believe the old ""Better, not bitter"" ad campaign was aimed at Beck's (remember that). Pours as light as any bad beer. Heavy hops up front- which taste almost stale. Very slightly above average mouth feel which disappears faster than a scalded dog. No after taste and whole thing goes nowhere. Never again."
"Appearance is a straw color with not much foam or lace. Aroma is that of almost invisible hops, sulfur, and dank. Initial taste contains moderate carbonation and a watery hop taste with some bitterness, malt also present in minimal amounts. Followed by a nice dry finish. Pass."
"Purchased at the LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Tasted fresh from the get go. Poured a medium straw color with a full white head that quickly disipated to about half its size and left nice lace on the glass. Carbonation level is full and appropriate for style. Slight malt aroma shines through the other wise neutral yeasty nose. Flavor is slightly sweet from the malt and the sweetness carries on through the finish. Good stuff when it is fresh."
"Pours a very light straw color with a tight thin head that sticks around a while and laces the glass. Smells damn skunky. The skunk overpowers any other aroma that might be there. I'd say it's the green bottle, but I bought the green bottle right next to it and that one wasn't near this bad. Taste is almost non-existent til the backend bitterness hits, which is considerable. Mouthfeel is very creamy, almost like drinking foam. Very pleasant. All in all, not bad, if you like a lot of bitterness without any other real flavors."
"Taste is empty, litle malts, unfresh and hardly any bitterness. This used to be a decent brew but in recent years went from bad to worse. Imbev didn't do good for them. Mouthfeel is also missing some caracter. No don't want more of these."
"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color lager with no head and very limited carbonation. Light floral malt aroma is detectable. Taste is extremely light and boring. Aftertaste is non-existent. Overall, this beer totally lacks any inspiration and taste like some many other macros out there."
"Pale yellow with a head that is big at first but then settle into a this fizzy lace. Smells slightly skunk with grains and faint hops. Taste fairly clean with a grassy grain and hop bitterness. Light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Not a lot going on with this beer. Just your average Euro lager that you will pay too much for. Next"
"If it wasn't for the smell at the start I would consider this to be a good session beer, in fact it used to be one of my choices. Still not a bad beer, but certainly not one of the greats."
"For nostalgic reasons I can't completely slam Beck's. If i'm watching a soccer game in the middle of summer, one or two of these might go down my throat."
"Pours a golden pilsener color, very much like the other beers of this type. There is a nice tall white layer of foam as well. The beer smells a bit of skunk, but I sense some sort of sugary citrus accents as well. Not unlike the appearance, the taste is very similar to other beers of its class (Heineken, Dab, Grolsch). I think Beck's might be a touch more bitter, but other than that I would almost have a rough time with them in a taste test. Its not a bad beer by any means, but I think these european pilseners are a little overrated. Not bad at all, but for the price, there are far better beers to drink."
"Drinkability: Hey, I love a good hoppy beer, but this is just WRONG! Its hard to concentrate on anything else but the foul hops and the skunk nastiness. This is a very low-rate Euro-macro. Germanys #1 imported beer? Well, they sell a lot of Bud too, doesnt mean its good beer. I was happy to find out from an ex-girlfriend that was over in Germany for the summer that Becks is a cheap-ass beer to them too. As she described it, Becks to them is like Natural Light to us. Just avoid it!"
"Mouthfeel is ok. Better than expected. Drinkability is ok as in Australia, Becks often go on sale so therefore it is affordable. If you had to choose between a lower brand beer and becks for the same price its a no brainer."
"Beck's is definitely a very good tasting German pilsner. Although, it did have a very skunky smell at first, I seemed to get used to it after a while. Although I have never had it on draft, I heard it is very good that wasy as well. I would recommend this beer to anybody."
"The smell is mostly of cheap grains and is not very pleasing. The taste isn't very good either. The finish brings a balance of hops that just isn't very good. The drinkability is acceptable, but that's the high point."
"Before I was of legal drinking age, a friends older brother told me you would not get hangovers if you drink Beck's. I have proven him wrong time and time again by overindulging in this german delight. Poured into a pilsner glass, light ""golden yellow"" color with minimal head. The smell is somewhat skunky. It has a nice light refreshing taste with a slight malty notes. This isn't the best beer in the world, but when its around I drink many of them."
"Unfortunately, Beck's is a member of the GBLB (Green Bottled Lager Brigade), European division. I drank a fair amount of this--more Beck's Dark actually--back in my younger days. I'm not sure that I ever felt it was good beer and I most certainly don't feel that way now. While not abysmal, it does give German beer a bad name."
"This is summer day at the beach beer when good beer in cans is hard to come by."
"It is interesting to note that I found this beer alongside Budweiser in almost all of the London tourist traps I visited last summer."
"All in all, I like it more than others I've tried of the same style, yet, not having a wide range of knowledge or sampling on this style I can not say how it might fare against other lesser known imported pilsners. For me though, one I will be apt to have again, though certainly not on any regular basis."
"Drinkability- A guess it would be an OK beer for a hot day. Kinda like a Corona would be on the beach in Cancun. When it's all you have to choose from it's acceptable at best."
"We're sitting down with the in-laws to Thanksgiving Dinner. The game is on and I am on beeradvocate.com! A case of Becks is in the fridge, so I think its time for a review. Pretty fizzy and yellow, nice white head though. Smells like not much, but it tickles my nose. Taste is clean and a little hoppy, nicely drinkable. Alright, not a kickass beer, but good in a pinch."
"This beer presents very differently on-tap, in bottle and in can, in my opinion. Very noticeable. Next to on-tap, favour the 24-ounce bottles over the 12-ounce bottles and over the 12- and 16-ounce cans on ALL counts. Be warned the pricing for the 24-ounce bottle is usually a disincentive when compared to the other forms...sadly...a marketing flaw or a price you have to pay to get a better beer shipped across the pond?"
"M.F./Drinkability- Good and crisp, this is very easy to drink and to find. Of course this is below average by German standards, but this is one of the better super-macro Euro beers around."
"Overall-An adequate beer for the style that gets the job done, I would drink this if offered but I don't think it is worth the extra money as an import when compared to beers that are just as good for less. This beer gets a lot for its upscale image that is a result of marketing instead of the beer. For what it is though it is a solid euro lager, nothing more and nothing less."
"Pours a standard euro-lager gold-straw, with a small head thaat fizzles out post haste. Surprise, surprise, smells like grassy malt (and not much else). Taste is overpowered by skunked grass malt (best before 05-05, seems like a long shelf life for a lager). Yuck. Not a good beer, even as euro lagers go. Get something else, there are tons of better german beers."
"Beck's is a dry, light to medium bodied beer, and is somewhat bitter in the mouth w/ a gentle effervescence on the tongue. Exhibiting latent pilsner qualities, the taste is lean and dry and generally inviting. I have probably had this beer 1K times, but never ""really"" evaluated or broke it down into its vital components before. Freshness is critical in this mainstream class of product, as is drinking it ""young", so check the date on the bottle and select one with an expiration date no later than six months beyond the current date. Turns out, that for a globally distributed - mass produced export, Becks is really quite decent, and makes for good contiguous consumption."
"Pours a dull yellow with a white head that vanishes very quickly. Smell: P-U! Skunky! I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle. Taste was mainly hops, but isn't very smooth, and has a weird bitterness that makes it less drinkable that a typical German Pilsener. The mouthfeel has a rather agressive carbonation. It's not a terrible beer, but it certainly isn't as good as I thought it would be."
"Not much to write home about here. Pours a clear gold with a bit of fluffy pure white head. Aroma is a bit metallic, with some hop notes. Taste is boring. A bit of malt up front and then Noble hops come in and dry it out. Becks has always had a weird finish to me. Mouthfeel is a bit biting. Smooth but not that smooth. Drinkability is OK, but I would much rather have other pilsners. Good in a tight pinch, but otherwise not recommended"
"This beer has pretty much the same taste that Beck's Dark has, but without the distinct metallic taste of the Dark. Nice and smooth, it goes down easy; you almost don't even notice you're drinking it until you have to get another one. There's no real smell to it, no skunkiness that is stereotyped to be present in green bottles. The carbonation is a little crisp, but not stinging. All in all, a decent beer, one of the best you can get for the price."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a fluffy 1"" white head above the clear, brightly golden brew. Head fades, but at a reasonable pace for the style, and lacing is good. Aroma is that usual ""seems skunky"" scent that Beck's and Heineken seem to have. Very noticeable, can almost smell it from across the room. Taste is slightly sweet of pale malts, with a somewhat generic hops bitterness at the swallow. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both okay, with this offering acceptable for the style, but nothing worth running ot the store and getting. A fallback if pickings are slim when at a function, or something, perhaps."
"Crystal clear yellow, firm, white head which lingered, snappy bite of hops which was well balance with malt, great guzler, much more taste than american micros and a good role model for them to consider. A fantastic match for the tailgate chow at the Cal/USC game, too bad Cal lost."
"The motuhfeel is the best part of the beer. Great bracing carbonation seem well suited to this beer. Average drinkabity here. Nothing bad, nothing great."
"330 mL can with freshness date stamped clearly on the bottom."
"Drinkability: I used to think this brew was awesome, until I became a BA and started discovering beers that put Beck's to shame. It might make a decent session beer except that it is way to expensive."
"Overall, Beck's is just another Euro mega-brew on the lines of Heineken in nearly every aspect. Nothing here to run out and stock up on."
"I buy Beck's when it is on sale or feel like a Euro-lager and don't buy Heiniken."
"Another overpriced Euro lager, but not a terrible piece of shite. Pours pale yellow, with perhaps a 1/2 finger head. Lots of carbonation. Smells a bit skunky and musty. Like an old attic. Bit of a malt and grass presence. Taste is an improvement. Light, sweet malt taste balanced by a dry grass flavour. Mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated, even a bit harsh. But, it's something I wouldn't mind having again, though it's overpriced quite a bit."
"Overall, this is an average beer that has a nice drinkability level."
"--Joey"
"As much as I hate to admit it, beers like this one do have their time and place, like today when its 113 degrees and Im helping someone move. The beer expectorates from the 12 ounce green bottle an unclouded gold with a generous white head, soapy in appearance and the lace a velum like sheet. Nose is the standard malt sweet that is also fresh, start sweet and lightly malted, top is skinny in feel. Finish has the customary acidity and the hops status quo for this sub-style of beer, drinkable yes."
"There is very little about this beer that is 'there', not much happening from any angle. The hop character in the bouquet is slightly skunky/ slightly grassy and sort of annoying after a glass. A better aroma would result in a higher score. Flavor is light and crisp but could use more of a malt punch. Finish is dry with a slight lingering bitterness. Even at its freshest this is too much of a 'meh' beer."
"Not a bad beer. A lager to grab when the budget allows more than domestic swill but not the finest Germany has to offer in this arena."
"And I guess it is ""bad"" too."
"This is difficult. It seems to have some good qualities but the big picture is really lacking. This is a trendy ""look at me"" beer and I don't have much room for that. Pours a light gold with a good head at first but soon disappeared. Aroma is of mild skunk and pilsner malt. It is light and thirst quenching. I had a hard time pinning things down here. It starts with a hint of skunk, moves into a tempered pilsner maltiness that is ok, then another whisper of skunk in the aftertaste. It starts light but has a heavier medicine feel on the middle of the tongue. I poured it out halfway through and got something else."
"Standard 12 oz longneck bottle. Pours light amber. Moderately carbonated, the head is delicate. The smell is a bit of a stench, though I have smelled worse. The taste was not very bitter at all. Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing. A very straightforward brew that leaves your palate clean."
"This is yet another German pilsner, uncomplicated and predictable."
"I considered this an average beer... better than many of the mass-produced American name brands, but nowhere near the quality of a craft-brewed beer. Drinkable, but why would you want to?"
"beck's is a good German beer. beck is a nice balance between ultra strong and subtle beer. one of my all time favorite. very smooth, and not watered down, yet not motor oil. very addictive beer, once you start it's hard to stop. excellent draft or out of the mini keg. also fun to try to peel the foil wrapper off without breaking it, a challenge after you have had 5 or 6."
"When first poured, it was a light pale yellow with some white foam and no lace at all. The smell was a mellow grainy nature with a hint of hop's. The taste was lacking in depth and had a kind of bitter taste that made this beer just an average brew. Not impressed with the finish on this beer. One of the weaker German Pilsener that I've tasted so far."
"life beckons and your holding the key! this pours out a clear golden with a medium sized foamy white head. not bad. the aroma is very grainy with that all too familiar skunked hop aroma thats seems present in alot of these ""import lagers"". taste wise its in the same ball park as heiny and such. grainy and simple. light hopping that plays it safe. a tad metallic. crisp in the mouth, could be refreshing when the time calls for it. not bad, but far from great...a mediocre beer that plays it safe."
"Overall, non-skunked Beck's is what I would expect from a big brewery, but is still above the usual fare."
"I need more than this for an enjoyable experience. That said, I need to cleanse the palate from time to time and Beck's is a good way to detox from huge beers without AB."
"pours very light and clear, white head, fizzy bubbles that continue to rise from the bottom. This is an old favorite of mine. When viewed through my BA critical eye, this tastes light and fizzy. Not much body. Minimal malt, some faint hoppy grainyness. Just kind of grassy and skunky. Decent lawn mower brew, but sadly not much more."
"Beck's pours a pale yellow with thin white head. Typical to all the mainstream beers. Smell is similar to the holland beers. Taste has a nice dry hoppy flavor with a slight bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable and thirst quenching. One of few beers found at almost all bars and restaraunts that is set apart from the rest. It is good all around beer when the choices are few. Not incredible but good and satisfying."
"ng"
"Light golden yellow color. Fizzy white head, faded fast. Small bubbles pop through here and there. Wet grass smell and some faint hops. Murky, earthy smell. Taste was better than the smell. High carbonation, along with wet grass, mild buttery bread and just a little whack of hops and carbonation finish up. Grainy tastes linger, but overall pleasantly refreshing after a long day of work. A no brainer beer, but have it cold and drink it fast, like most pilsners tends to fall apart and gets watery at the end."
"A nice, inoffensive lager, easy to put down."
"Drinkable, just not that great."
"I can taste a light maltiness with a slight hop bite at the end. Refreshing mouthfeel."
"The mouthfeel is crisp. Carbonation levels makes the tongue tingle a bit after swallowing. Little aftertaste. The drinkability level slighlty higher than average as several of these can be quaffed in one sitting, but boredom will kick in by the second beer."
"not too bad, almost the best pale lager/pilsner ive had."
"Drinkability  This went down much better than your average macro swill."
"Final Thoughts: Took great care to avoid a lightstruck beer, so I don't think this was the problem. Perhaps, the product got overly warm during shipping? Overall, an unpleasant experience. I think I'll take a plain old Bud anytime over this."
"Well, I didn't have this one in Bremen. It poured standard clear gold under a standard one finger white head. The nose was mild, not at all skunky or sour. The mouth was light, slightly sticky, and heavily carbonated. Sweet malt opens the taste experience, but is quickly chased by a fair hoppy bite. The bitterness lingers well into the aftertaste, tingling the back of the jowels as a Pils should. No complaints with this particular bottle."
"Still a fairly dead looking gold with a white color that barely skims the surface. Smell is fresh and NON veggie!!! Slightly bitter hop notes dominate other lesser flavors. Very clean finishing and thirst quenching. In absence of a better choice Id gladly reach for another. But in all honesty, even a fresh one is just slightly better than average."
"the most overrated import in this country by a mile. perhaps we see a lot of it here because the germans are too smart to be drinking this very lack lustre lager over there, when they have acess to a whole lot better."
"The best of the common, mass produced lagers. This one actually has a little bite to it. Weak appearance and smell, not a whole lot of taste or body. Does, however, have some hop bitterness (however slight it may be), and is crisp and clean. None of that corn-sweet taste of the U.S. macros. Rates with St. Pauli, Grolsch, and Guinness as my personal ""cut-off point"" (you're in a 7-11, and have no other options. Also, goes pretty well with pizza."
"Don't know why I should have expected anything of a macro sold in a bomber bottle for under $2 at Osco, but there you are. Smells like a Miller Lite. Pale yellow color under a fluffy head that dwindles quickly. Light malt taste leaves a touch of hops at the end. Some adjunct taste. Gassy. What you get in college to ""impress"" a first date. I say ""Eh."""
"Where it's at...Creamy head with nice lacing. Pale color with lots of bubbles. Smells of skunk at first but that goes away and allows the sweet malt and noble hops to come through. Flavor is grassy (hallertauer?) hops up front and dryish malt in the background with just enough sweetness to balance out the strong bitter twang. finishes dry and sharp. A nice session brew but nothing too special. I like it enough to order it when there are no decent domestic micros available. ...Two turntables and a microphone."
"I was out at Boston Billiard the other day and thought what the hell Ill have a taste of this beer. Right off the bat it was very skunky and hard to drink. I was drinking straight out of the bottle so forgive me for not having tones of visual images. It did have some maltyness there but nothing to write home about and it did have a crisp flavor to it but like I said before it is very hard to get past the pure skunkyness of this beer. The thing that gets me the most is the fact that this is a German beer and they should know better. Its just depressing that when your average person thinks of German beers they think of Becks. Well next time Ill have to try a St. Paulies Girl."
"Very drinkable light pils in the can..delightful and worth a try even if you've been burned by the green bottles."
"Pale yellow, straw hue, degrading aroma of light hops, grass and even adjuncts detected on the nose. Up front, rather bland, a slick hoppiness, lacks any sort of body or character. Som malt detection in the body, not much to write home about, a decent quencher, yet nothing to get hyped up about."
"what's the deal with beck's? i don't think i've ever had a decent tasting one. even brews like heineken aren't bad if you have a bottle that has been sheltered from the light in a 12 pack or something. beck's always tastes and smells skunked. it pours a plae golden colour with thin lacing. high carbonation is apparent, as is the smell of rotting skunk carcass. the taste here is more of the same: skunky, musty, metallic (perhaps from the foil cap cover?), stale and earthy...basically nothing good. oh yeah, if you try real hard for it, you can taste some hops through this mess. better made than most american macros, but come on guys, get your act togther and hit us with some fresher tasting brews."
"Simply not a very impressive beer."
"The beer pours an almost clear color, but with a light shade of gold in there. The head appears frothy for a moment until it totally fades to nothing leaving a slight lacing. The nose is nice although there is little character to speak of. Sometimes simple is the best way. This is a very clean tasting brew. There is no maltiness about it. I wonder if they use adjuncts in the grist. This beer is just too clear for words. The mouthfeel is alright, except that it could use a little more carbonation. If it's going to taste like a crappy macro, it might as well get the whole stereotype going. The body is extremely light and it drinks well. Like I said, it is a very clean tasting beer. I wonder why I paid a premium price though."
"This beer used to be one of my fav's untill I discovered what else was out there. But tonight I decided to try a bomber bottle of this stuff just for old times sake. It poured a straw color with minimal white head that did not last long but left a decent lace around the glass. Smell was skunky but the taste has a good balance of malt sweetness and a little hop bitterness. If you can get past the smell, you can drink quite a few of these suckers. It is a decent session brew, but nothing close to lowenbrau as far as ""mass produced"" german beers."
"Very frothy head subsided quickly atop an utterly clear beer. The clear golden color is very nice but the carbonic acid bites a little too much in the flavor. Nice maltiness balanced by a strong german hop flavor is very enjoyable in this beer. Light body is nice and a skunky hop bitterness is present in the finish. Good german pilsner but a little too much carbonic acid made it lacking in the smoothness department."
"I can't seem to find a bottle of this stuff that isn't skunked. It's a nice light golden blond with a nice head, but once I smell it, that's it. It's just like Heineken in the skunkiness department, although it does beat it hands down in taste. I just don't understand why these breweries put their products in green glass...."
"A crystal-clear straw-gold body reveals a multitude of fine to average-sized bubbles rising steadily to the surface. Its frothy head of bright white foam holds well, maintaining a thin lid throughout most of the glass, and leaving some nice lace as it goes. The nose is fresh with some floral and grassy hops over a delicately grainy malt. The body is light-medium, and it's gently crisp on the tongue. The flavor delivers a delicate combination of floral and mildly grassy hops over a slightly straw-like maltiness that's solidly backed by bitterness. The dry and lingering finish is simply an extension of the flavor in the mouth with some maltiness and lightly floral hop flavor followed by a distinct bitterness. Although it lacks the firmer body, fuller flavored maltiness, and finesse of some other fine examples, this remains a refreshing German pilsner in every way!"
"Overall, a decent pale lager, but certainly nothing special."
"If Beck's weren't so skunked, it would make quite a decent thirst-quencher. It is not exciting in any imaginable way, and sadly it is the first beer many people think of when they think of German beer."
"Look like straw and has a skunk nose... it is quite hoppy. A light lager in reality with little body no head.. Taste was not balanced and is not highly drinkable.. the green bottle does not add to the storage propeties of this beer and is a mass produced German Style of Bud."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a decent sized fizzy white head. No lacing, but a nice ring did remain throughout half the beer. Aromas of corn and cooked vegetables. Do these guys use green bottles on purpose? Medium carbonation. Taste was more cooked veggies, mostly broccoli and cabbage. The finish, however, had a nice dose of hops. Very unbalanced next to the boiled greens though. If not for the skunkiness, this may have been a decent brew. Instead I found it undrinkable. Oh well."
"A light gold colored lager, with a medium whiteish head. Aroma is grainy and very sweet Mildly hopped lager. Taste and flavor are mild. Finish is clean and mild. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. This tasting does NOT have a grren bottle skunkyness to it."
"Poured from a 710ml green bottle, silver foil around the neck, with a freshness date on the back (no way I'm buying a 6 of this). I lucked out and got a decently fresh bottle, no skunk at all. So THIS is what it's supposed to actually smell like. Light malt, light floral hops, a bit metallic. It's a pale straw colour, had a decent head, but it shrunk immediately to a faint ring. Flavour is light and crisp, nothing very special, but it's drinkable, I don't mind it much at all, better than a Heinie. All in all very average, I wouldn't say no to another if someone was offering, but wouldn't put down more money for it."
"I wouldn't buy this normally, but in a pinch I wouldn't mind drinking another."
"This beer was pale gold in appearance. It poured a medium size head with very little lacing. It had a fruity, citrusy aroma with a bitter taste to it. It had an aftertaste that just would not go away. There was no carbonation evident. The body of this beer was light. I could not believe how awful this beer tasted. I am glad I have this one out of the way."
"Pours a pale gold with a minimal lacey head. Smells a little skunky (but not as bad as other beers). Also a bit of hops. Taste is fairly crisp, and pretty smooth. Again, somewhat hoppy with almost non-existent malt characacteristics. Just a tiny bit of sweetness. I'd say overall this is a little better than Heineken, but this is a macro of course. I only tried this because this is all that was offered (at a party). Needless to say I wouldn't buy this on my own."
"F."
"This review is based on a 24 oz bottle. Poured average for a German Pilsner. Clean white head. Taste is of malt, a little floral. A little skunky, though that in my opinion is not a bad thing. Wonder what brown bottles would be like. Hops are well balanced. Finish is smooth. This is the Bud of Germany, much better though."
"Tolerable, if not impressive. The package presentation is very nice, but the green bottle leads to the standard need for freshness. The appearance is appropriate for a Pilsener; clear, light amber, white head that disappears quickly. The taste is very average with a dry finish that is light on hops for Pils. Better to go to Urquell."
"Pours a pale straw golden color with a modest-sized snow white head, resembles an American light lager, attractive broken lace, mildly carbonated. Slight malt aroma with some mild herbal and a fairly strong skunk component. Taste begins with fairly rich malt and smooth carbonation, flavor turns grainy towards the middle. Toward the middle part of the taste the hops appear with a harsh and bitter medicinal quality that lingers well past the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is rather watery. This beer is does not meet the high level of quality that is the hallmark of German brewing. Not a terrible beer, but terribly average. It is unlikely that I will purchase this again."
"Pours clear with a pale yellow color and a substantial white head that disappears quite quickly. Smell is less than appealing--a mix of stale grains and that all-too-common macro lager skunkiness. Just to be sure, I confirmed that this bottle was well within its self-proclaimed window of freshness. Taste is not terrible, just terribly uninspiring. Mouthfeel is fine; this is a very smooth beer but a very bland beer. Just a bit of crispness toward the end, otherwise nondescript grains dominate. I notice the taste of water as much as I notice anything else, which probably isn't a good sign. I can drink these if they're cold, but there are many, many better choices."
"Another European lager with the same skunky smell, and the same damn green bottle. This beer is not even a true golden color, but in the scheme of things I would say this beer is not good or bad just tolerable. That is bad when you have to settle for something not being what you want. It pours with a head if you can even call it that, and to me this beer is the bottom shelf when talking about German beers. This is a simple beer that I guess some can settle for, but I want better than this. This beer is another favorites of the man in the business suit trying to look important, but this is not impressing me. The flavor is subtly sweet, but overall the flavor is bland and leaves me wanting more."
"Not one of my fav's, but it's tolerable. I'm not what you would call a big fan ot it, but I'll drink it if I have to. It's upscale, but not worth the cash to shell out for it. It's really light in color and little to no head. The taste is of watered down hops and malt. try it if you wanna, but I'm not going to again."
"Pours a light yellow color with a white head, tastes like skunky macro. Not that much different from Heinekin. When I was younger I drank my share of these so I hate to say it, but the skunkiness does not bother me."
"A solid all round beer, great with food and without. I like mine out of the 500mL cans (yep, cans) because its a great value that way (here in Canada anyways) and tastes better to me than served from the bottles. This beer is awesome in the sauna, even better out on the boat and is also suitable for mass consumption if you want it but kind of expensive for that."
"I had been given a pack full of Beck's from the importer here in Cyprus. The label read Best Before 04/2002. It was July and it tasted just fine. I enjoyed this beer every day with my food. I know that serving beer in frosted glass is not recomended but i recomend you to try it with Beck's and see the results by yourself..."
"Pours a light, pale yellowish color with a light head.  A somewhat bitter aroma, which is basically how it tastes.  It does feel smooth in the mouth and goes down easily, though.  This is one of those beers that I thought was outstanding back when I was in college, but fortunately, my beer palate has since expanded.  Still, it does beat the heck out of your typical American macro light beer."
"A smooth tasting lager going down leading to a moderatly bitter after taste that does not linger.The colour is a pleasent light golden hue and the head when poured is very thin and disapates to nothing quickly, giving the appearence of a large glass of apple juice. Mouthfeel and drinkability are a definite plus with this brew."
"I actually kind of like this brew. It pours a straw color with a thick head that fades fairly quick. The smell is skunky but not too bad. I think the taste also fairly good. The mouthfeel is only average but I can always drink serveral of these without a problem so i gave it a high score on drinkability. The major downside to this beer is the price."
"Beck's, it's the German Heineken. Skunky, watered down and hard to swallow. Tastes better from the mini keg, but when I had that, I was more into the mini keg then the beer. Being drunk at the time may have helped too. But this is not good out of the bottle. If I have no other choice I may try from the tap, sober this time. How can the Oktoberfest be good, and this be so bad??"
"333"
"Very much the usual continental lager fare.  Golden colour, minimal head.  The taste is stronger than many, however in this case it isn't a good thing.  Kind of a bittersweet taste, cloying and unappetizing.  Ah well, at least I now know I'm not missing anything by not drinking this."
"Why, why, why, why, why is this always light struck when I try it.  Pours out to a golden color in the glass.  Smell is that of light struck beer and we all know what that smells like.  Initial taste is rather grainy, but gives way to a slight hop taste.  One day, if I ever find it fresh, I'll review it again."
"It did not taste as good as I remembered it. It lingers around average... plenty of better beers of this style to try."
"I had this on tap at a company picnic.  Over the years I've only had bottled Becks (a notably skunky experience).  Actually, from a keg this beer isn't half bad.  It's average, but has a nice hop finish, good head retention, and a somewhat appreciable continental lager aroma.  It still wouldn't be my beer of choice, but it was (maybe) a cut above athe typical macro."
"normal is the first thing that comes to me. it is a decent german lager that just tastes like a beer. it is just plain and simple. it is very drinkable, but it does not lay a finger on other german lagers"
"I drink this when I have to; either when nothing else is available or when nothing else is available.  It has a meek yellow color, no smell at all (except faint grains or maybe some slight hoppy aroma), but it is crisp and clean.  I don't think it's bad tasting, espcially when eating pizza or something greasy.  It is good for it's thirst quenching ability.  I much prefer this to American light swill, as at least this is not offensive, and you do notice that there are bittering hops in this beer that give it just enough so you feel like you drank a beer."
"Not the best German beer in town, but it did go well with the brats and kraut."
"A drinkable lager, but when you compare it to other German beers, this stuff is swill. Looks and smells like any other not-as-good-as-Hacker-Pschorr lager. Nothing terrible about it, but nothing too exciting either. Like I said, its drinkable and would gladly accept one if offered. For free."
"Pale yellow color with a thin head.  Mild hops and skunk aroma.  Fairly smooth, medium to light body.  Off hops flavor that is slighty better balanced than Heinekens but not as good as St. Pauli Girl which isn't all that to begin with.  A dry, bitter hops aftertaste.  That skunky smell and flavor prevents from being as good a beer that it could be."
"Clear straw hue, w/ a head that settles fairly quickly compared to other pilsners.  Very husky, grainy and sweet hay notes in the aroma along w/ mild sulfur.  The grassy hop nose sways towards the characteristic mild mercaptan skunk. Lightly bodied, but not particularly crisp and drinkable due to a slightly astringent tannic note.  The hop bitterness, although mild, isn't balanced by any noteable malt backbone, and the beer is left astringent, bitter, thin and unremarkable.  Finishes bitter and watery. This is my first and last Beck's."
"One of the few Macrobrews from the Germans that I can deal with.  I don't think it is as skunky or as bad as Heineken, but it somehow seems to get more of a rap then it does."
"If price wasn't a factor, I would always buy Beck's in favor of any macro from this side of the pond."
"This is the beer that makes young professional-types feel like they know something about beer.  It's imported, and it's got that pretty foil wrapper and nice green bottle.  Drink this stuff at any bar in town and you're sure to get laid in no time.  We all know how much the ladies love a man who knows his imported beer.  [Oh, and I'm adding the following to remain in compliance with the rule against slamming a beer without mentioning its characteristics.]  It's almost always skunky and it's straw-like in color and grassy in flavor."
"To my shock, I very much enjoyed several pints of Becks in 16-ounce cans.  It had a rich euro-lager taste without any hint of skunk, which is so common in the bottle.  Had a rich aftertaste, with malts and hops present.  Buy it, if at all, in a can."
"This beer is a drinkable and sometimes thirst-quenching and I will purchase it over bottles of domestic macros. Better in summer when served ice cold to minimize the skunk."
"i realize that euro-lagers tend not to agree with most american palates, due to the hopping which is often described as skunky.  some find this appealing, most do not. i find all malt lagers such as these with the euro hops a welcome change from usual fare of non-offending domestic offerings.  and for some reason they go well with really spicy food.  if beck's was the same price as domestic beer, i'd drink this stuff often."
"Notes: This beer is right up there with Heineken and other Euro lagers that have been chewed up and spit out by the stressed brewing processes (pasteurization). It is what it is, there are better ones to choose from."
"Ridiculously long expiration period, bottles I bought in September don't expire until this July...flavor sharp but mostly ""upfront", even a mild skunkiness is gone in a second or so...along with crisp, its gassy."
"Its drinkable, but lacks in every department, boring as batshit, but i suppose you could drink a few in a row, look elsewhere though."
