At first take, the appearance and smell combine to form a beer that seems to be not much better than PBR. Much of this is forgiven once you take a sip and are greeted by pleasant citrus hop notes and a decent mouthfeel. Not my first choice in Pilsners, but one could surely do much worse while living in Houston for the summer.","Bockrules","Jul 03, 2014"

3.43,-2.6,3,3,3.5,4.25,3.5,"Overall: Maybe it's me, but I really like to taste PILS (malt) in my Pils! It's got some sweetness kicking around in the back and some sides to the front, but it's only when you swig it all around the mouth do you get some as it hits all parts of the tongue at the same time... and then, after awhile, I taste lots of Sweet Pils malt, but still, it's hard to find it. From mouthfeel, it's a typical German, yet the aroma is poor and reminds me of a Fernsehbier. I'm torn whether I like this beer. For the American market, maybe a very bitter beer with little Pils malt flavor is a winner, but not for me. Again, I want Pils in my Pils, and a Pils without a decent amount of the Pils malts showing up is a weak beer. Overall, it's not a bad beer, but I'm not saying I'd drink this as a ""summer"" beer. A 3.4 of 5.","boddhitree","May 22, 2014"

I saw Saint Arnold's seasonal change once again, so I grab a six as I always do. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass although sometimes I drink this one straight from the bottle. Aggressive pour right down the center makes a huge white foamy head that I know won't stick around. Golden yellow with little lacing as the glass goes down. Little nose on it, just a wheaty scent. Just an average pils for me, I use to drink this more but it seems my tastes have changed over the years. It's a good sessionable beer but that's about all.

2.75,-21.9,3,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This is what I would call an ""American Pils"". It's a standard golden color. Pour it vertically if you want any amount of head on it, because it'll be gone in a couple minutes. It otherwise maintains its carbonation throughout. There's very little scent from this. The taste is light and crisp, similar to an American lager. It's just bitter enough to leave a small bit of aftertaste. My personal preference is a pils with big hops. This is on the other end of the spectrum, and you'll want to hammer it down lest it get warm. It's probably worth a putting a six pack on the fridge this summer to see if you like it. I'll be moving on to a good Kolsch or a hoppier Pils, tho' I might just pick up another six of SA Summer Pils.","pgfault","Jun 11, 2012"

It really complements the flavor and provides a nice segueway into the flavors when you are sipping. The taste is grain, bread, and malt with a great balance of fresh floral, peppery, earthy hops. The aftertaste is bitter from the hops and still a little sweet from the malt. A well crafted pilsner. Good mouthfeel. Carbonation is just about right and the finish is rather dry which makes you go right back for more. Great drinkability.

Hop flavor is lemon and unripe oranges with what I envision tumbleweeds taste like.

4.42,25.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The Saint Arnold Summer Pils is on the fence - not quite German, not quite Czech. It pours the typical clear golden body and bright white head that you'd expect of a good pils. The head retention is good, and it leaves thin, streaky rings of lace at the outset of the glass. The nose delivers a bright and fresh combination of lightly sweetish grainy malt and floral, spicy and grassy hops. It's sturdy in the mouth with a medium body and fine-bubbled, gently crisp carbonation. The flavor, however, is where it really shines - although you kind of know you're in for something good at the first whiff! It's richly malty without being big. It's just clean, and fresh, and kind of straw-like, bready, and nutty. And it's almost completely infused from start to finish with spicy, floral, and grassy hops. It even has a touch of lemon; and the slightly acidic pH balances it nicely! It's stunningly rounded, like the best of the best out of Europe, and it's perfectly balanced by a flinty, smooth bitterness from beneath that I'd guess is around 30-something IBU's. It finishes pretty much just as it began, and although it does close fairly quickly, there's some very nice lingering malt and hops left over to remind you to take another sip. Very nicely done!!! A perfect pils!","NeroFiddled","Apr 20, 2007"
3.03,-13.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with notch dating system on side of label. It was a nice clear golden yellow color. It had a small head that slowly whittled to a constant foam that was feed throughout the session by mini carb geyser. The aroma was typical pilsener and was malty with floral hops. The taste was good and went down smooth on a muggy Texas evening. However, after trying several pilseners lately I've decided I'm just not a big fan of the style. I can drink one every so often but they'll never make the rotation. However, I would recommend trying this one as a session candiate if you like the style. (3, RB-OAY, T, O)","TexIndy","Apr 15, 2007"

The taste is lightly sweet up front with a immediate hop character that flows through to the finish of this beer. The hop notes taste like a mix of lemon, herbs of various sorts, and a bit of grassy astringency too. This beer is quite light, and seems to be either missing the body/maltiness (for a Czech Pils), or the dry flintiness (of a German Pils) that would make this beer great.
