"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a pilsner glass.  Bright golden color and dense long lasting white head.  Great floral aromas.  Taste is delicate and refreshing with the same floral notes and just enough tangy hops..  Good carbonation & medium mouthfeel.  This is everything a great German pilsner should be.  Darn near perfect."
""
"Nose fruit, lemon, crackers, earthiness, cereals, faint honey, malt.  Taste sweet malt, light citrus, grass, lemon, herbs, & bitter dry finish."

"i liked this pils a lot, a good brewery that i havent had nearly enough beers from. frothy in the glass, i mean a big tall white head with great retention and a lot of bubbles, but its not all that lighter, a darker shade of golden, goldenrod more, less yellow, more dense, richer. the nose and taste both produce fresh cereals, grassy hops, very german all the way, but less dusty on the grain, a touch more weighted crystal malt, and a yeast strain thats both clean and extremely flavorful, which is uncommon in the style to say the least about it. its bready and sturdy and unlike most others, which i think makes this beer special. a little filling for a pils with all the body, and maybe dominant for more delicate foods, but its a darn good beer, interesting its organic, and i think something a little more robust on the pils spectrum, nice in cold weather. well made."

"Organic Ur Pils pours a crisp, crystal clear bright pale straw to gold with a 1” thick white foam cap. It has a grainy malt nose with hints of floral. The body is just below medium and the carbonation is moderate.  A hint of initial sweetness gives way to a smooth, dry, crisp finish."

"Easy to drink, slight lemon taste in there. Nice easy flavor."

"Overall: Perhaps I bought an old bottle, but this just tasted too musty and papery to me. It was lacking any real flavors that popped."

"500 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a small foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, toasted biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, toasted biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, toasted biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and solid robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid Pilsener, obviously showing signs of age. Well balanced pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink despite lacking carbonation. It was still pretty enjoyable as it stood."
"Very interesting in flavor.  Is a light golden color with some cloudiness to it.  Taste is unique.  Kind of sweet and perfumey with hints of banana, I think.  It's also a bit nutty, and feels a bit heavy going down, but overall, pretty decent."

"Don't generally like Pils but somehow this one caught me right, outstanding beer"
""
"O - The slightly skunky scent is a bit of a bummer but overall a pretty solid pilsner, wouldn't mind sessioning this one."
"Not a hop-bomb pilsener but there is quite a bit of character from them. Spicy and herbal with a certain crispness and mostly clean yeast."

"DATE TASTED: May 1, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstaphaner pilsner... OCCASION: a 78-degree day begging for a pilsner!... APPEARANCE: cloudy, hazy; almost appears unfiltered and murky golden; thick white head recedes swiftly; zero lacing as well... AROMA: fragrant hops suggest lilac and heavy bubblegum; a bit of honey too... PALATE: smooth, mellow, and slightly fizzy at the teeth; extremely drinkable and thirst-quenching...TASTE: rather subdued, suppressed lemon-grass spritz; some doughy malts arrive late--not as clear in its profile as expected... OVERALL: a surprisingly soft, unsubstantially flavored pilsner from a place I expect pilsners to fall like leaves; not sure the organic element has much to do with the look or taste, but the smoothness offsets the weak profile slightly...not sure what to make of this one in the end, except that its end was rather swift, so something did its job."

"Overall: Overall this beer is refreshing and a good drinking beer. A simple German Pilsner that is brewed to style. I enjoy the sharp bite at the end and the dry finish. It is also an overall good looking beer. Would buy again."

"O -- A pretty lackluster Pilsner. Another rather disappointing example from a brewery that was once a sought-after import."
""
""
""
""
"I was a bit disappointed but I would say to try this one anyway. It's organic and it could simply be that this bottle was not fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a solid but unremarkable pils; well crafted but just too tame."
""
""
""
""
"To the Point: a very tasty German Pilsener;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable."
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable but not as clean as a lot of other beers in this style (German Pilsener) - likely due to the fact that it seems to be unfiltered."
"Overall, this is a pretty good German Pilsner. Its not as hoppy and doesn't have as much bite as other versions of the style, but its still worth a try. It is a steal for the price, $1.49 for about a pint size bottle."

"O: I know i'm young to German Pilsners but this one might take the cake. Great layers of malt and hops make this borish looking beer extremely complex. Carbonation is spot on also making this beer perfect for summertime evening and late night extravaganzas. Too bad its march but soon I'll be drinking this in june. thx"

"O - an insatiably drinkable pilsner that has the classic hallmarks with some added yeasty and fruity flavours to make it truly complex"
"Full bodied for the style with a crisp earthy hop bite that lingers over the pale malt, bready yeast and light fruit notes into a slightly dry finish. Floral with resinous, grassy pine notes along with straw, hay, bread and pilsner malts. Slightly metallic in the finish but this beer us refreshing, decently balanced and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"EXCELLENT PILSNER!"
""
"O: This beer tastes a little more rugged and less clean compared to other pilsners—possibly due to its organic nature—but it is still relatively easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great example of the style.... to the point where I'm not sure what else I could really ask for from a taste/mouthfeel standpoint. Wish it came in a little more of a convenient form but I will take what I can get. A great example of a relatively ""small"" beer packing in a great flavor profile without being overwhelming."
"This is truly what a Pilsener should be. The color was a beautiful deep yellow with a snow white head of small bubbles. The aroma was full of light malt and a subtle noble hop nose. The head did fade as it was drunk. The taste was spot on with a malt front and a smooth hop finish. An excellent offering & exactly what this should be!"
""
""
"O - Absolutely great, a must try and something I will look for again"
""
"O: I like a good pilsener every now and then - and this is easily a good pilsener, therefore this is pretty damn enjoyable. Only thing is, I like my pilseners to be more well hopped, but now I'm just nitpicking."
""
""
""
"The taste of the beer was exactly what I would want from the style. Full flavor, which consisted of a nice complex grain taste, but is very well balanced with only a very slight hop presence. The beer is light, clean, crisp, and leaves a slightly dry aftertaste. Frankly, after I was done with that bottle, I was wishing that I had another. The ABV was not noticeable at all and this is a beer that I could drink all day. I will be heading back to the store for this one. Overall, an outstanding brew that is indeed, World Class."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patterns of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grass, hay, and some slight lemon zest. Taste is of grain, grass, and citrus zest. There is a slight bitterness and lemon sourness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pilsener but the mouthfeel is very lacking in my opinion."
"O- A very nice refreshing beer. I am not a super big fan of Pilsners but this one I would have no problem in ordering again even if it wasn't Organic."

"Pours a deep straw color with a huge white head that surprisingly dissipates almost instantly. Smells of bready malt with lots of melanoids. Slightly earthy spicy hop bite. Taste is bready burnt malt with a hint of earthy spicy hops. Medium to thin body with a crisp level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Decent brew but a little boring even for the style. Light and refreshing I could see drinking some on a hot summer day."
"Overall – Not a bad brew, and it does have a nice nostalgic quality for me, but in general not terribly intriguing."
"O- Overall a pretty good beer, it's the first ""organic"" beer I've had and am definitely not disappointed. I've got a huge soft spot for German beers, and where as pilsners aren't exactly my favorite style, I feel that this one shines above and beyond most."
"Beer is a slightly hazy pale Kentucky straw color with very active bubbles. Nice foamy white head and traces of lacing down the little glass. Aroma is really great - Light notes of baked bread and yeast. Flavor is light with notes of green apple and grape. Very slight tart/sour finish is really pleasant. Good effervescence keeps the finish nice and short. Overall a nice example of the style with it's own unique twists."
"Poured a 2"" white head which quickly dissipated. Hazy light straw yellow color. Smells grassy but not much else. Taste is pretty much straight BMC pils with only a very brief finish and not much of hops. Other than being organic I just don't find much remarkable about this sample. Maybe mine was older than its prime (?), I don't know, because most reviewers seem to have a better impression of this beer."
"O: Pilsners aren't my very favorite, admittedly, but UR PILS by Pinkus organic is one of the better Pilsners I've had. Super refreshing, highly drinkable, great session beer. Could easily put down 4 of these in a night and not get tired of it. Very tasty but in a brilliantly subtle way. Recommended."
"Beer is medium to light in body, and I love this brewery. The finish is wet and it is quenching throughout. It is a good beer but there is an odd flavor on the finish that I don't think is suppose to be there. There is an almost cidery finish with a mild fruitiness that I would expect perhaps in the midpalate. Other than this it is a perfectly fine beer and I'd have it again, I've had it dozens of times and finally bothered to review it."
"Overall – This is definitely a very highly drinkable and tasty beer. It is perfectly suited to go with the warm summer weather. My only complaint is the fact that it is a little pricey. Maybe I just got a bad deal, but at around 6$ for 500ml, I can think of many other thirst quenching pils that I would rather be drinking instead."
"Taste is crisp like you'd expect from a Pilsner with some sweet lemon going on. Fine bubbles on tongue like sparkling wine. Delicious and clean."
"overall a great helles, I'd love to put a few away in a beergarden. very drinkable, a good beer."
"A touch more tartness that usual for the style (possibly from being unfiltered?) making it that much more refreshing, though not more flavorful."
" I'm just going to assume that I need to try a fresh one. I was unimpressed and of the belief that I got a bad beer."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle appears much like a hefeweizen. Deep orang golden hue with some yeast sediment settling to the bottom of my glass. Aroma has a biscuit malt sweetness with herbal/grassy hops weighing in...a really nice noble hop nose. Flavor again nice malt presence/sturdy hop backing with herbal/grassiness that just works for the pils style. Biscuit malts dryness in the finish from the malt balance, a very nice drinking beer. Mouthfeel has easy going natural carbonation smooth easy going, on the palate. Drinkability overall is a nice sessionable organic pils the best version of any organic beer I've had thus far."
" D- This beer has a clean and smooth flavor without a big sulfury quality and some nice subtle hints to it. It still has some Pils character but the unfiltered beer adds some nice depth."
"Notes: It isn't my favorite style but for this style, it is really well done. My wife really likes this style and particularly this particular brew. She's tasting it with me now and would give it an A if it were her review."
"As robust a Pilsner as I have sampled, and equal to the task of washing down a shwarma with onions, olives, pickled turnips and pepperoncini."
"drinkability; very easy to drink but this is a Pilsner to be respected. More to it than some of the macrobrews, enjoy at home, not the type to buy at a gas station to quench your thirst."
"D. gimme more!"
"Slight haze, but otherwise pale golden, perhaps straw in color. Nice white head at first poor lasts for awhile, but never leaves completely. Nose is light and clean with a hint of herbal notes. On the palate the malt sweetness is appreciated right off the bat, with a nice herbal/grassy flavor that comes through to the finish. Light bodied and very drinkable."
"Another Certified Organic beer! The pour resulted in a finger of bone-white head with low retention. Color was a slightly cloudy golden-yellow due to its being unfiltered as noted on the label. Nose was tending more to malty with a light hops presence. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a light, dry taste on the tongue as well as a light graininess, perhaps due to being unflitered. There were hops present, but not in the in-your-face way that the Czech-style Pilsners can be with their Saaz hops. I am really coming to enjoy lagers more and more and I now recognize that German Pilsners are equally worthy of my attention. The finish even evidenced the characteristic lager-like honey sweetness. More!"
"Amazing drinkibility. Incredible beer. New favorite German pilsner."
"D- i'm pretty sure this is my first organic pils AND my first unfiltered pils so i'll raise a bratwurst to that. this is just another log on the fire of my recent burning affinity toward german beers of both high and low quality. pinkus is at the ultra violet end of that spectrum."
"Taste - bitter, which comes as a shock after the smell. the taste of the beer killed it for me"
"The beer pours a light, slightly hazy gold color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is just great in this pilsener, showing honey, bread dough, black pepper, light tangerine and light brown sugar. Flavors replicate the nose pretty closely, but I was struck by the amount of flavor this 5.2% beer delivers. On the other hand, there's nothing heavy about this beer, and I love the crisp, bitter finish. The hoppy bitterness, while not the least bit over powering, balances the modest honey bread dough sweetness pretty much perfectly. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fairly long finish. Carbonation is pretty good and seems perfect for the style (this beer is not the least bit gassy). Drinkability is pretty much perfect. It was all I could do to keep from gulping this beer down, it was that delicious and easy drinking. Just a loverly beer..."
"D: Classic country pilsner, how it was done in the 1800s. I'd love to try this out of a wooden keg. This is olde time pils."
"I guess the coming summation is trite by now but; ""not really into pilsners, this one was okay, I probably wouldn't buy it again""."
"drinkability - flavorful and simple, crisp, refreshing, great session beer"
"This beer would be perfect for sitting around on the deck with friends on a hot summer night. It's clear, crisp, and refreshing, but it's got plenty of flavor. This is one of those beers that I'll add to my list of beers to have again."
"Slainte! and Gesundheit!"
"D: Very drinkable, nice like flavor and very refreshing."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from an organic pilsner. Overall, I liked this beer. The major downside was the smell. As soon as I popped the cap there was a skunky smell coming from the bottle. The smell doesn't really translate to the taste. The aftertaste is a little bitter, but it's a decent beer. A pilsner might not be my first choice for a beer, but this turned out to be a decent beer."
"Drinkability: For around $4, this was a very solid purchase. Tasty, balanced, and quality stuff. I'd definitely pick up another one in the future."
"D= very drinkable, a bit pricey at $2.99 for a 21-ounce bottle though."
"Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a pint glass. No freshness date on the bottle. Yellow gold color, with about 2 inches of thick foamy head. Strong scents of lemon-like citrus. I can taste the naturalness of the brew the unfiltered grain flavor. Strong biscuit like, whole grains. Pretty mild hops. Great pilsner taste and easy to drink."
"A pleasantly drinkable pilsener, made true to spec, and well rounded between the malt and hop components. Sturdy like German ox, buffalo, yak, or whatever they've got over there."
"First sip, smooth. Lightly hopped. Not much bitterness either. Quite drinkable. A mellow yeasty character to the flavor."
"While this isn't the best Pils out there, it was certainly enjoyable and a bit of a twist from the usual pils. I'd have liked a little more bite in the taste and aroma, but this is still a beer worth trying."
"This was my first organic beer and a very pleasant surprise. A refreshing beer, and definitely worth a shot."
"Pours a pretty nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight citrus, and some spice notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, bitter, hoppy, slight citrus/spice note. Medium body. Drinkable, this brew surprised me."
"D- I expected a little more flavor , but an overall okay beer."
"Nice, easy drinking beer. Enjoyed it."
"D: Pinkus Ur-Pils delivers a quality example of the pils style.Though it makes a few deviations from the norm, it is a great brew, and worth giving a try if it is available."
"Overall an ok beer, but i wont be revisiting it with so many other good pilsner options on shelves these days."
"D - Very drinkable. I could easily drink too many of these."
"Certified Organic. That's good, I guess. But I bought this 500 ML bottle mostly because it was $2.99 at Meijer and I had never seen it before. It's got a nice straw-yellow hazy color and contains a fair amount of unfiltered floaties. Moderate fine-bubbled white head. All kinds of wonderful smells come from this glass. Clove spice, Banana, sugar, wheat grain, bubble gum, malt. These same flavors are in the taste also. Tastes just as it smells. And the texture reminds me of how the inside of a Whopper malt ball dissolves on your tounge... If that makes sense. Slightly heavy but easy drinking. Good stuff."
"Unlike any Pilsener I've ever had. Smell is very nice. Lemon, bananas, vanilla, apple, yeast, and a little spice. Taste was not quite as complex, but still very good. Getting a lot of bananas in the flavor as well. Some wheat. A noticeable hint of lemon. Even a little vanilla that I got in the aroma. Really great stuff."
"pretty drinkable beer....just not my favorite!"
"Due to the lack of filtration I get a lot of wheat beer qualities from this, i.e. mild yeasty umph with swallow, banana pudding esthers and spice (granted noble hop spice, not chamomille). Gingerale aftertaste."
"This is a very, very superb more robust pils, similar in style to a Gouden Haven, but much better."
"D: Unimpressive, barely finishable and rather unejoyable. Would never buy again or recommend."
"D: I found this to be a pretty decent, but not great Pils. It seemed a bit on the mild side to me. More like a Munich Helles than a true Pils. The low ABV makes for a nice session beer."
"overall - i am finding out i enjoy german pils the most because of the lemon/citrus zest"
"Drinkability- very easily drinkable. would get a few"
"Huge, billowing head of highly agitated foam, pops and slides from three fingers down to a solid covering, leaves a good deal of sticky lacing behind. Sourdough, pretzel and semi-bitter hops pave the road through the nose, lemon peel, tobacco and earthy with a little bit of apple, apricot fruit in there, yeastiness lasts longer than any floral qualities. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is heavy like it's just a bunch of water balloons in the mouth, no real lift or energy from it. Spicier hops here but still devolves into bready notes of rye, sourdough and, at times, pumpernickel. Has a familiar organic beer wateriness to it, openly knit and not gathering the parts into a whole over simple fluid movement forward. Ends somewhat prematurely. A clean, traditional and inoffensive representation."
"Notes - This beer had an OK mouthfeel but nothing special. I'm surprised that this beer is this off."
"Pinkus Ur Pils is light-medium in body with fine, subdued carbonation, and is quite an easy drinker."
"Still isn't bad."
"Notes - I might not have gotten the most authentic taste of this brew as I remembered to disrupt the yeast only after I had poured nearly the whole glass. I'd like to re-review this beer at a later date and pour the whole thing after setting the yeast in motion. The biggest shame though is that"
"Taste is similar to aroma. Very low, almost unnoticeable alcohol, with powerdy florals. It's a good drinker for sure. Because it's not filtered, it's not as crisp as I want for a pilsener, but as an unfiltered pils, it's to style and very good."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is bready with caramel, and mild spicy noble hops. The taste is spicier than the aroma, with a more subtle malt bill. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, I really love a good pilsener, but this just doesn't fit the bill. It is drinkable, but there are better examples of the style."
"This beer poured a hazy, straw yellow with thick white head. The head retention was impressive, and lasted until the last sip. The aroma was mild - some spicy, noble hop aroma but not as much as I expected. The taste was perfect to style - some sweet malt up front followed by some spicy, saaz bitterness. Overall, it was crisp, and slightly lemony, and incredibly drinkable. One of the best imported, german pilseners I've had in the US."
"Half-liter German bottle with some code on the label. It is a beautiful golden color, but chock-full of sediment, and is capped with an inch of semi-dense, white head that leaves decent lacing. Spicy and earthy hops in the nose make way for some sweetness later on. Lightly malty on the palate, with some sweet tones that strike a wonderful balance with the floral, grassy, spicy, perfumy, almost citric hops that impart a medium bitterness. The beer is tingly and dry, fairly light, but moving into a nice creaminess and imparting a lightly hoppy and malty sweet finish. Very flavorful and incredibly drinkable; relatively inexpensive to boot. Certainly one of the better organic beers I have sampled."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, not a bad beer but there are definitely several others in the style that I would pick first."
"D - I'd say this is moderately drinkable. Interesting flavor, but it's not really what I want from a pilsener. Like many others, I wonder if my bottle was a bit old."
"Pours a nice sparkling golden with a thick, fluffy white head that fades to a cap. Smells somewhat grainy and slightly sour from the grain as well. There are also some floral hop aromas. There is even more of that sour graininess in the mouth, and it overwhelms the hop crispness a good bit. The sour dies off a bit on the finish and there is a bit of breadiness that appears. Not great, but drinkable. The sour graininess cuts into the real pleasures of a nice German Pilsner. This is missing the nice earthy/herbal bitter hop bite and the nice crispness that usually sets the beer apart. A bit of a dissappointment."
"D - Highly drinkable. This isn't a complex beer but it's tasty. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
"Although my bottle looks pretty new, I think I may have gotten an old one. I will re-review this beer later as this one did not impress me much."
"Easy drinking."
"Purchased 20oz. bottle from Whole Foods downtown; was looking for Pinkus' Munster Alt (which is excellent, by the way) but didn't find it, so I thought I try this. Pours a murky, hefeweizen-like gold - in fact, the only thing that visually distinguishes this from a hefeweizen is the lack of any head or lacing whatsoever. Smell is unmistakably pilsener - clean with some citrus and floral tones from the noble hops complemented malt graininess, nothing too exciting but pleasant nonetheless. Taste is obviously similar, although this is a rather raw example of the style - there is some roughness in the finish that makes this beer less quaffable then it should be. Mouthfeel is fine, with the correct amount of carbonation contributing to an appropriate crispness. However, the unpolished finish deters overall drinkability. I would not choose this over other accomplished examples of the style such as Trumer, Spaten, or Paulaner."
"Pours a light straw color with a fluffy, long-lasting white head. Slightly hazy as an unfiltered beer. Malt dominant/grainy aroma with subtle floral noble hop aroma. Strong Pilsner malt flavor up front with a nice crisp dry finish. Very noticable bitterness that nicely balances the malt and lingers into the finish. Light bodied with a moderately high carbonation level. I am not usually a big fan of Pilsner but this is a very good example of the style."
"Bottle from the Utah State Store. Pours a golden hue with a medium fluffy white head. The aroma is full of malts, some floral hops and grass too. The flavor is pretty good; smooth and rich malts mostly, also, some dry yeast cider-like flavors. A touch of hops and a generally smooth and watery body. Very nice and quaffable."
"Conclusion: I was expecting great things from this Merchant du Vin-imported beer...in the end...it was just ok. From other reviews, I'm wondering if I got a somewhat outdated sample; it seemed like there were great things lurking underneath (quite rich in heft/flavor) but everything was just a bit muted."
"Plenty enjoyable. Couple this beer with whatever meal you care to, or have it alone. Hell, have two."
"I am afraid that I left this beer in the back of the fridge too long. It just isn't as crispy as I would have expected. This just means I'll have to try it again."
"Prost!"
"D: One of the most easily drinkable beers I've had in a while. I could really quaff this stuff for a good long while. American macros, eat your heart out."
"The taste is at first fruity, with apples, hints of pear and dry, tart peach up front followed by light yeasty bread, hay, lightly bitter herbs, grass, and hint of lemon pulp. The elements soon blend after the first sip and the hop quality and light bitterness just dominates the finish over faintly sweet, zesty-fruity-bready base. It has a light, lively, zesty quality and stays interesting. It is a bit on the dryish side, aspecially after the first taste. However, flavours become a little muted and it's slightly on the muted, watery side after the first few sips."
"Easily sessional. Enjoyed with corn tamales."
"Overall not bad, but more then average would be an accurate way to describe it. I have had more then better in the style, but still, nothing to really knock on it as it was definitely very solid."
"D - Not my first choice for an organic pilsener, but a good attempt."
"Poured from a brown bottle at refrigerator temperature (mid 40s F). Appeared yellow, hazy, with about 1 inch of tight foam. The beer initially presented a malty grainy aroma and sweet taste with just enough hops to balance. As the beer warmed, it seemed slightly drier, maybe a bit astringent, maybe the hops coming through."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy beige/yellow color pils with a good size foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of malt with a light floral profile and some crisp dry hops are also noticeable. Taste is a mix between some floral malt with some distinctive hops from Plzen. Full body with some great carbonation. I thought it may have been a bit too grainy but it was still very enjoyable."
"Recommended..."
"Poured into a pilsener glass. Hazy straw color with a smallish white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is lemony and wheaty. Lots of yeasty wheaty flavors here with little grain or hop. Lemon, unripe banana, and hay make up the flavor profile. Pretty drinkable despite a less-than-clean mouthfeel."
"D- What a great german pils and @ 5.2% it's easily sessionable. IT was a little pricey at $4/ 16 oz bottle but I can see this in my fridge in the future."
"One of the beers my wife and I tried at the Dundee Dell in Omaha, NE, and one of the most memorable. I liked this more than I expected. The color was a hazy-cloudy straw. Poured into a tall glass, it had a puffy head that vanished rather quickly but left behind a nice aroma of lemon and hops. Initially it was rather cold, and the carbonation had a lot of bite to it, as did the hops, but as it warmed up the bite mellowed, the body smoothed out and a lovely honey flavor emerged. A good find, as were two other Pinkus beers we tried. Nice label, too."
"Very drinkable, an awesome German Pils."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"I am not a fan of Pilsners or lagers but this offering is completely different than any Pils I've had. Much more bready, and toasty like champagne, yet with a sublime finish that pursues way longer than it should. This is the first Pils ever to last as long as this one. Well worth the money and USDA certification."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with orange hues and a 1 finger white head with lots of little bubbles and dark colored sediment rising up the glass. Aromas are packed with yeast, banana, cloves, and fruity esters. Up front flavors of lemony hops and malt are very well balanced yielding to the banana flavor which finishes dry and sweet. Well carbonated, light bodied, this is a clean very easy drinking pilsener."
"Total 28/50"
"Overall a very drinkable beer of the style; nothing too extraordinary but nothing to critique either. The fact it is brewed organically is a plus."
"Smells of lemon, malt, and hopps were sweet and strong. Had a better aroma than taste and I was kind of disappointed with that. Taste is strong of hopps and sweet malt. Might be a bit of honey too. I think the after taste was stronger. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good overall but this beer kind of fell flat in the end."
"Notes: Was surprised with this one, it's richer and more complex than most pils, but without compromising drinkability."
"Drinkability is average, not my favorite pils, I like the fuller flavor, but would prefer less fermentation by-products. It really reminds me of another beer that I haven't had in while and can't place, maybe urquell?"
"A decent bottle of pilsner. Glad I purchased this on a whim."
"Overall an extremely enjoyable organic pilsner."
"Mmmm, certainly smells like a pils - grassy, herbal hops with lightly baked biscuits. The flavor matches with a crisp, dry bitterness, citrus rind, a slight malt sweetness and mineral note. The appearance is a clear, brilliant gold with a thin white head. This is very easy drinking and refreshing, yet full flavored. This is a great example of a German pils. Yum."
"This pils pours a nice golden amber with a thick but not persistent head. Aroma is richly malty with a fruity hint. Flavor is fully malty with a whisper of sweetness and a little hop bitterness as a nice counterpoint, as well as some hints of apple. Texture is very smooth, more like a cider than a pilsner, and there is a little hop flavor in the aftertaste."
"Not stunningly great or anything, but nice on a warm March afternoon."
"Not exactly what you'd expect in a pilsner, but tasty nonetheless."
"Pours a lightly hazy straw color with a head of large white bubbles. Sweet grainy aroma. Comes through in the flavor as well. A general ""perfume"" quality. Light body, but the perfume quality gets old towards the end. Not as refreshing as I would like in a pilsner."
"Drinkability- Not very representative of the style, but quite tasty."
"Cloudy yellow, similar to a hefeweizen. Little bit of white head that doesn't last too long. Smell is mostly of the yeast which is much like a mild hefeweizen light spiced smelling yeast. Taste is some spiced yeast, a touch of malt, and almost no bitterness. I guess I prefer my beer non-organic because this isn't doing much for me. This does not taste like a pilsner to me. Tastes more like an American wheat. Not what I was expecting and not something I care for, although it is drinkable. I can't see ever having the opportunity to drink this for free anywhere, so I probably won't be having this beer again. Nothing special"
"This pours a nice kinda cloudy yellow with a beautiful head. Nice blend of hops and malt and citrus. More like a Hefe than I have noticed in many Pilsners. The finish is very hoppy at first and then sweet. The carbonation and bite is also very strong. This is a very good beer."
"Drinkability: High. Definitely a good session beer."
"All around this is a decent pilsner from Pinkus. I don't know if I would spend $3.50 on another pint (at home) but I sure wouldn't pass one up if offered."
"Pours a cloudy straw with a white head. Nose is a hint towards lemongrass. White grapes. Flavor is light and refreshing with a sweet and soft tang that stays fairly constant while delivering a lot of citrus tones. Feel is pretty decent. Nice bubble on it. Very drinkable. Smooth and even. Just probably not my style or something I would prefer to go for again. For me the lemon flavors come out way too much for it to be a repeat performance."
"Standard pilsner.. crispy, fruity, with a dry finish. Good mouthfeel, with just the right amount of carbonation. Found the flavors to be very mild, and it took a lot of sips to really get the full feel of this brew. I don't think the orgainic status made this beer any better or any worse. I just think the beer on the whole is average, and a good, clean, representation of this style. Worth a try."
"D - A unique pils. The fruit flavors are unusual but good."
"Light-bodied,slightly grainy,tangy. Expected more hoppyness,was more maltier than anticipated. Decent beer,nothing special."
"Pours a very pale color with a small head. Aroma is somewhat skunky but not too much. I can smell a nice combination of malt and sweetness still. Taste is very much of the same. A nice, smooth malt sweetness that leaves a sweet aftertaste in the back of the throat. It's quite drinkable and goes down well. Light and refreshing and organic as well. Not too bad."
"Drinkability -This was a nice beer. Easy to drink and nice taste."
"If you like the style you won't be overjoyed but you won't be disapponted either....Remeber it's the weight of my heart not the size...Prosit!"
"The taste is pretty good, but, has minimal hop taste. The mouthfeel is dry, light and refreshing. I think this is a good pilsner and would drink again."
"Toasted grain flavors give a crispness to the body thats quickly washed away by a heavier biscuit malt and slight caramel notes. Crispness of the body, which was present at first returns and sits well into the finish. Dry in the finish with a biting mouthfeel that prickles the roof of the mouth. There's a touch of butter in the mouth, but it evaporated quit quickly. A nice pils that I'd have again if given the chance. Nothing that blew me away however. Very drinkable session brew."
"Interesting flavour and look to it, but not sure Ill run out and buy another. Certainly prefer their Hefe to this."
"Overall: Not the best pilsner Ive had, but a good one nevertheless. This example has probably suffered due to age. Worth a try."
"D-This is a good beer. The unfiltered aspect of the brewing makes this a sort of hefe-pilsener. The appearence and smell would probably be better were it not for the long transatlantic voyage. i will seek this one out in Germany when i am there."
"Overall a nice and hearty unfiltered pils. Very drinkable."
"It is a very drinkable beer. Very nice balance of malt sweetness tempered by the dryness of the hops."
"Actually this is not a bad beer at all but hard to compare to a typical German Pils. There is very little of that light refreshing malt and saaz hop bite that I would expect. This is one is higher on malt to the point were it almost taste like a bock. I imagine this is what differentiates a pils from an ur-pils. I really dig it, but not in the way I expected."
" Very light but hazy yellow. Thin white head and lots of bubbles. Nose is grain and old moldy corn. Musty like a barn. Taste is mild and pleasant grains, and a funky hoppy ending (maybe with some anise?). Mouthfeel is very thin; drinkability is average."
"Originally reviewed on July 4, 2006. Fresh crisp aroma of sweetgrass and seminal light mediterranean salt herbs. Pour of lightly cloudy hot yellow. Flavor is a rich toothy bite of whole grain and rising minutia of toasted oats. Whispers with a drop of sweet lemon extract. Backed with a heavy hand of favoring hops in the high alpine mode. I think the heavy refreshing quality of this beer really helps it along."
"Mouthfeel was only moderately zesty, light/medium bodied."
"The drinkability is ave. maybe a little better, I can find better. MK"
"Delightful! While I don't find this beer (and style) very complex and worthy of deep thought, it is quite easy on the palate and enjoyable. I look forward to trying more Pilseners."
"This was my first organic beer, and I really enoyed it. There wasn't smell. There wasn't much head, and there wasn't much lace. All that said and done, it tasted good. I got a couple Pinkus from a deli and I'm pretty stoked for the next one. Don't drink and review."
"Organic Ur Pils pours a hazy golden color with a thick white head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is grassy hops and just a bit of malt. The flavor is similar, grassy hops matched nicely against some malt. Not a bad choice, certainly worth a try."
"Beaten gold body and very bright white head that dissipates a touch too quickly. Aromas are of pears on the fruit side, along with some earthiness and a bit of saltiness that came out at higher temperatures. On the tongue, bready malts first assert themselves, then give way to mild pear fruit and zesty hops. Lots of carbonation in the finish. Zesty, very carbonated mouthfeel, with a touch of acidity. Overall, a very smooth, easy liked beer that was very nice in the elements it presented, but lacking a bit in the variety of elements it puts forward."
"Despite complexities and richness, it had a light feel to it that made it feel refreshing. Very smooth. The unfiltered quality gave it more of a body than most pilseners. Fresh, clean, complex and unique."
"It's about as good as a German Pilsner gets. Rich, firm pilsner malts with light grainy flavors, a light citrus / apple character evident in the aroma and flavor, and a refreshing crispness in the finish. Hopped for a mild bitter balancea and a light earthy flavor. Bottle condition leant a mild haze, but otherwise strong straw color and moderately impressive head retention. More rich and full than most pilsners without pushing the gravity too high. Remains light and fresh throughout. Nice beer."
"Drinks pretty easy, but just a slightly above average german pils IMO. I can think of a dozen others I'd rather have"
"I had the Organic Ur-Pils, which is apparently a different name for this same beer. Pours to a hazy yellow, with suspended particles, and a creamy off-white head. Flavor is mostly hoppy, with a hint of malt caramel. Fairly dry, especially midway thru the glass, but overall a good tasting beer with a decent finish."
"Easy enough to drink on a warm summer evening. Although, not much more than a thirst quencher."
"I found Pinkus to be very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Another German newbie to Alberta, this Pinkus Pils comes in the 500ml blue-labelled bottle. ""Organic"" sticker on the neck. I do believe this is my first time ever trying an ""unfiltered"" Pilsner. I have never seen that before. Pinkus Ur-Pils pours out a slightly cloudy light-honey colour with hints of lemonade-yellow. The head is initially very large and healthy, styrofoam-white and billowy, with an ice-cream consistency. Good lace. As attractive as a pils can be. By the end is looks like a hefe in the glass. Nice. Very light fruitiness smelling above the glass, almost lime-like. In closer is some excellent creamy-sweet malting, adding some faint vanilla and grains. Grassy continental hops are here in good quanity, but the beer smells very sweet, almost sugary at times, with plenty of orange-peel and lemon notes. After pouring again for some more head, the aroma is vaguely spicy and full of sourish malting. Not overwhelming in complexity, just very appetising. The taste is very light, with some citrus salinity and bready malting, with only a little finishing dryness and balanced grassy hops on the follow through. Lots of lemon in the taste, and fairly watery malting altogether. The taste is far too sweet and un-hopped for a good Pilsner. Definitely uncomplex, really nothing more to describe. Very smooth mouthfeel, and very low in carbonation. Light bodied. Extremely drinkable too, just not interesting enough to register more than a blip on my Pilsner-scale."
"I found this a good drinkable Pils..then it was 90 degrees outside and this lasted under 10 minutes."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Nice foamy head, lacey white. The color is a hazy straw, very light. The aroma is faint, fresh, and earthy. The taste is smooth, but it lacks any kick. As it heats up the sweet smooth malt becomes even sweeter (not for the better because it leaves a film). The smooth texture make this one go down easy. It is enjoyable and it has some bright points."
"Overall a pretty nice beer I'd be happy to have in any biergarten on a warm day."
"I would recommend trying this beer at your next opportunity. Organic and unfiltered Pinkus Ur-Pils is a prime example of a German Bio-Bier. Whereas you may not buy into the organic aspect, the unfiltered aspect of this beer means none of the flavor has been stripped away; the resulting sensory experience is definitely rewarding."
"Not a bad beer, not a great one. I had higher expectations here."
"Very drinkable and mighty thirst quenching. One of the better German Pilsners I've had to date."
"Pours a hazy light apricot hue, lazy carbonation with a lot of suspended particles (hence the unfiltered statement right on the label). A quick shock of pure white head tops it off, and falls to a fairly thick creamy cap. Mild grainy malts on the nose, bready, with light grassy hops. The flavour is hit and miss in my books. Light watery flavour up front, the flavour really never does pick up, you get traces of bready malt, some spice, and some very faint floral hops, but not really in one cohesive package. It truly does taste like it's been watered down in general. The mouthfeel as well, no surprise, is very light bodied and watery, with only a quick rip of carbonation across the tongue on the finish, which does not positively contribute to the overall experience. Very waifish for a pilsner, even an organic one, this is a total wallflower, very easy to overlook, and with good reason. A pass on this one next time."
"A pleasant surprise, as my first experiance with Pinkus wasn't so pleasant. This would make a fine fair weather beer, very quaffable."
"Overall, a very pleasant and highly drinkable German Pils. Beers of this style (pilsners in general) tend to be undervalued when it comes down to this rating stuff. But there's something to be said for well-made, cleanly drinkable beers like this one. Would make a terriffic session beer."
"Overall, not my favorite of the style, but is good. I really do think this beer would be paired very well with many types of food. I keep thinking of a steak while drinking this."
"M&D: overall the mouthfeel is very light and soft throughout, and carbonation feels quite balanced on the palate, this medium-bodied German Pils is distinctive from most other samples of this style I've tasted. It has more delicate elements in it and is not just superficially glossed over with a dash of hops--maybe also due to the fact that it's unfiltered? I truly like this beer."
"Drinkability: Sure it's drinkable, but not really memorable. Kinda neat in that it is an unfiltered pilsner and organic. I can at least say I have had something good for me today."
"This Pils poured into my glass mug a slightly cloudy yellow. Decent head and carbonation. Whoa, this smells different from your average Pils. Crisp and dry taste, more flavorful than your average bulk Pils thats for sure. The hops are not overwhelming and I like that. This is a really drinkable Pilsner.. Interesting."
"Mellow citrus notes in the taste, with a faint hop bitterness to finsh out the clean, crisp presence on my pallette. No aftertaste to speak of, but the carbonation leaves me with just a slight tingle on my tongue. Overall, a well done beer perfect for the warmer summer months."
"An enjoyable, yet overly simple and one-dimensional beer. I don't really see a reason to drink this. If I want a Pils, I'll get one. This tastes more like a sophomoric american pale ale."
"yeasty,bread,citrus aroma up front almost heffe like in some ways as its an unfiltered pils, except I don't smell or taste any sweet fruits just citrus and yeast/bready. Fairly solid body, with a crisp dry finish. This is a highly drinkable beer very refreshing and cleansing. It's possibly a nice transition beer for your fellow BMC friends."
"This is what an organic beer should be like. While many beers have grassy qualities to them, this is like some well-cultivated and carefully maintained greenery in a glass. Nice mellow hoppiness and crispness make this a pils that is definitely worth checking out, even if you generally find the style unexciting."
"An odd pilsner. As some others pointed out, tastes more like a lager. It tastes like something I've had before, but I can't remember what (maybe a Baltic lager?). Not the usual hop bite of a pils, kind of bready and dry. Appearance typical, and certainly this is a very drinkable beer. If you're looking for a more standard pils, skip this. Nice for something different."
"One of the better organic brews I've had."
"This is an amazing interpretation of the style. Found it much different than the other pilsners that I've tried. I'll definitely be having more."
"This is one hell of a pilsner, is all I can say. If you see a bottle, pick it up and buy it."
"Drinkability: While not a great pils, the monster nose makes it interesting enough to recommend. Not superb, but novel and solid."
"A crisp middle of the road German Pils. Nothing unpleasant besides the semi-bleach flavored aftertaste. Not my favorite style so I probably won't be returning to this one, but a decent Pils with most of the style's traditional character."
"This is a great beer for this current, sweltering weather. It would be a little too easy to drink a lot of these. Both fortunately and unfortunately, I have only the one bottle."
"Nice hazy appearance fits in with the earthy, organic theme. I was kind of surprised it was so hazy, maybe a bit malted wheat in the background? Smell has a hint of noble hop and spicy, phenol sniff. Tastes like a German Pils, very clean with a stiff noble hop flavor. The carbonation is perfect at medium - medium high. This is a tasty beer."
"Highly recomended"
"Pours cloud, dull light golden, frothy white heat, with moderate retention, leaves lts of fine and well stratified lacing. Nose is mildly herbal,and of bananas, wheat beer like. This is an earthy, crisply hoppy Pils, unusual cloudy appearance, and fruity yeasty nose. Refreshingly sharp, flavorful and tasty. Nice warm weather brew, try it with a salad and chicken or fish"
"Notes: A very nice example of a pils. Nice job!"
"This brew is a darker-than-expected orange color, nice sized white head on the top. A few fish food floaters swimming in the body. Good lace. Nice light malt scent, lemons, hop flowers. Light bread malt front, citrus tones, light bitter hop backbone. Smoother mouth than i would have thought as well. A different look at the style than im used to, nice and refreshing."
"Taste is pilsener, smooth (what is an ur-pils? unfiltered?). Lightly sweet, touches of lemon. Awesome, smooth and delicate mouthfeel. Slightly dry, white wine finish. Light, balanced body. One of the better composed pilseners I've had."
"I should note that I am not in a huge hurry to seek this one out again, but it is certainly worth a try if you see it.."
"Drinkability- I can't believe it! Two pils in a row that I actually like and would consider having again. This beer has tons of different flavors and stuff going on. Try it and see what you think. I guess organic is a good thing in beer too!"
"OK oddly enough this beer taste's better close to 55 Deg F. Not expected for a pils. The lemon zest in the bitterness comes out more then."
"Overall: Not bad but rather boring, hey at least it is Organic, that means something right??"
"Drinkability  Much better than their effort at an organic Hefe Weizen."
"Ur Pils is a unique take on the style. The progression from a modestly sweet beginning to a parchingly dry, bitter finish is interesting (but is a phrase that I hope doesn't end up on my headstone). Although pilseners can't be counted among my favorite styles, this one is a keeper."
"Body is very hazy, most likely from the lack of filtering. Dark gold, slightly orange color with a big white head that quickly fades into a thin layer of bubbles on the surface. Has a very pungent malt smell, slightly grassy, but is obviously no slouch like many of it's euro lager counterparts. Yeastiness in the nose. Taste is sharp grassy malt that fades to a satisfying hop finish. Carbonation accentuates this beer perfectly. Slight metallic twang in the aftertaste, which doesn't hurt the flavor that much. Good beer."
"Tonight turned out to be German Pils night as I've just finished a Allgäuer Büble Bier. I was a bit surprised that I had not yet reviewed the Pinkus Ur Pils since I've had it so many times before. I pick this up regularly grocery shopping at Wegmans. The unfiltered pils pours a hazy light yellow gold. Head is substantial upon initial pour. An enduring layer of foam is left behind. Faint fruit aromas are detected, some pear and green apple. Flavor is rather subtle light grain, imparting a sourdough bread essence. Hops are leafy, grassy and biting leaving a welcome lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and with crisp carbonation. Good drinkability and a solid brew."
"Yellow. Classic German Pilsner aroma, with pils malt, light fruits, clove, honey, herbal, spicy and grassy hops. A very pleasant tasting Pils, especially up front and on the mid-palate. Grainy, fruity malty texture. Notes of clove, light fruits, bananas, pears and honey. The hops are subtle, which is why I liked it, grassy and herbal. The onlu complaint is the poor finish. Nontheless, this is an impressive Pilsner."
"This is easily consumable beer. It is also interesting enough to warrant more tastings."
"I like this. Am wondering if it's more along the lines of a KellerBier, as it is unfiltered. Lovely light tangerine in my pilsner glass, I received a lovely two inch snow white head after pouring. It's gone now, with just a thin layer on top of the brew. I really like the aroma on this one, it's decidedly spicey and perfumey, and a bit bready as well. Mouthfeel wise is medium+, good carbonation, spot on, enough, but not too much. Tastewise, you get your money's worth...the malt is a hanging in the back, so you experience an initial perfumey note (again), with some citrusy notes in the finish. Unique and Tasty, would love to get on draft (if possible)."
"An odd mustyness throws it off style, kind of a weird beer. More of a kellerbier maybe?"
"The beer is cloudy gold in color topped by a respectable creamy white head. Smells very grainy with perhaps some mild fruity aromas. A sweet malt flavor to start, masterfully balanced by bitter (but not too bitter) hops. A crisp refreshing finish. Overall this is a highly drinkable pilsner that really stands out from the rest."
"The taste is perfectly sweet and musty. An excellent sharp bitterness melds into a sweet, but dry graininess. Theres a solid body of pungent and grainy malt. This is very close to my perfect pilsner. Sharp with the fresh grains accented, which all pilsners really should have. A benchmark beer. Excellent."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a lot of floaties and a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent with a musty, dry aroma. It has a bit of lemon zest. The taste is good. It has a smooth, bitter flavor with a malty hop aftertaste. It is a dry, musty brew with good mouthfeel. It is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. This is a fine German Pilsner. It has excellent flavor and mouthfeel; a good drinker."
"ng"
"The taste is excellent for a pilsner, but this isn't your ordinary pils. Tart, citrusy lemon is smooth on the palate and matches very well with the sweet pilsner malt backbone. Apple and pear notes appear early on, and lend an amazing complexity to this ""organic"" pils. Finish is crisp and very clean. I love this offering, and plan to stock up several of these at my next opportunity."
"I saw this interesting beer and had to try it. An organic, unfiltered Pilsner? . Pours a hazy gold, which is exactly what I expected. Has the same Plisner flavor, but the bitterness is slighty muted. Nice flavor, and comes in a brown bottle, which is nice considering the high skunk factor in green bottle, imported pilsners. Overall, a nice beer. Highly drinkable. I reccomend this."
"Trying to remember if I've ever had an unfiltered Pilsener before. Poured a hazy gold, a bit brighter and less hazy than a hefeweizen, but not far off. The beer was a bit on the acidic side, but this did not translate into any particular tartness. Yeasty flavors - clove in particular, much like those found in a hefeweizen. Unusual, and interesting. For some reason, the beer did not totally engage me, but it was certainly worth the try."
"Pours a hazy yellow gold with a moderate, pure white head that settles quickly leaving a thin lace. Smells are grainy light malt, with a descernable bready yeast, and acidic hops. Taste is crisp, clean, and refreshing. Low level acidic flavors over an unfiltered, grainy malt, which quickly gives way to pure acidic hop. Not a very complex taster, but a very nice session brew, if you atre in the mood for an acidic pils. canbonation is quite perfect, not overbearing, but bubbly, refreshing and complementary to the general feel of the beer."
"Real drinkable brew, practically a meal in a bottle."
"Taste--pretty good, and pretty complex. Salty and slightly metalic notes give way to sweet Munich malts, which are quickly overcome by a fine selection of hops in the finish. Interesting yeast notes (fruity, mushroomy) provide counterpoint."
"Taste is OK. Not as crisp as I would expect a pilsener, a bit more creamy and rounded. Not very crisp and not much hop profile here. A fruity sourness with some very light hops in the finish. Not bad but nothing that stands out to my taste. Decent drinker but not one I'll seek out again."
"My sample had LOTS of yeast sediment, rarely do I leave beer in the bottle, I did on this occasion and I left beer in the glass there was a lot of yeast (image a chronic case of dandruff)!"
"This Organic Pils marches to a beat of a different brewer. It pours a dull gold color with a nice sturdy white head and plenty of lace. An aroma of fresh bread, malt, hops and citrus lasts. There's more body than one normally associates with the Pils style. The hops are a bit spicier and less metallic than most Pils. A light herbal flavor mingles with a hint of lime and a bit of alcohol. If I were blindfolded I would have guessed someone had tried to blend a Hefe-weizen with an Alt. Hmmm!"
"Very different...I just finished a Scrimshaw Pilsener and then sampled this offering. It seemed much more like a wheat offering than a Pilsener. Head was nice and well-formed. Clinged to the side of glass a bit. Smell was slightly hoppy and fruity...Taste was light, but full bodied, leaving a pleasant slight tart aftertaste. Drinkability was very good, going down smooth with a nice aftertaste. I wasn't expecting the results I found...it wasn't as ""pilsener"" tasting as I expected. It was much more rounded like some of the ales I have sampled."
"This brew poured a medium white head of finely sized bubbles that left very little lacing as it receded. It had a mild aroma of hops and malt and a wheat yellow cloudy body with yeast floating in it. It has a mild initial bite that smoothens in the finish. Its flavor was a bit fizzy and hoppy."
"500 ml bottle. Poured a cloudy straw yellow, with a fairly decent head that quickly faded. Aroma is slightly malty, and of fresh cut hay. Taste is very mellow, low carbonation, and just plain mild. I kept waiting for more that just isn't there. Not a bad beer, I could drink this as a session beer, but I prefer something with a little more body to it."
"First of all, I was not too impressed with this Pilsener. I just could not quite acquire a taste for this one. It poured a white creamy head. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer. The body was cloudy and the hue was yellow. The yeast was visible in my glass. It had a sweet aroma to it."
"I totally expected this to be a dud--all dusty, as it was, sitting sideways on the proprietor's shelf next to the hot fridge exhaust. But I'll be darned, this is one of the best damn pilseners I've ever eaten! Poured huge and foamy, with a Monsters-of-Rock head that sat up like stiff egg whites. The aroma was so lubricious and slippery with protien that I almost suspected the suspect Isinglass fish guts to be in there. But the body reveals otherwise. Nice hoppy punch in the nose, with that dark, musty, bottom-of-the-barrel, English-IPA sort of vibe, but more in line with the spirit of the TRULY HEAVENLY malt body that this beer posesses. Scrumptious as all get-out!"
"Opaque dark gold with a nice and bright head of 1/4 inch of consistant-sized small bubbles. Laces in sheets in a Pilsner glass. Slightly ""dusty"" and nutty aromas, sense of late summer harvests. Grassy and toasty malts, very flavorful in combination and yet restrained overall. Light body is well matched by a lack of overcarbonation. Finishes crisply but without a notable hop assertion.Minimal to no aftertaste. This is the last of the Pinkus selection at my store, I must say that I'm impressed by each as unique in their style while still conforming to overall style characteristics."
"Another great product from Pinkus! My first actual unfiltered pils and looks similar to their weizen but a little less cloudy. Nice big white foamy head though like the weizen has. I'm not that big on Pils but I must say this is a good one. Great clean crisp flavorful beer. Classic Pils malts and only slight bitterness. I'm surprised this isn't rated higher, it's a quality brew."
"Poured nicely with orange/yellow hue,with pretty good rocky head.Nice balanced smell with a nice crisp hop tone,also a little bread-like.I like the maltiness of this pilsner some overhop for the style but not this one.The hop came through but it was not to promident.Was pretty drinkable,I have had better but this wasnt bad at all."
"Cloudy golden color with a pure white head that retained decently. Lacing was spotty at best. Grainy, bready, malty taste that was nice and smooth. Easy to have a few of these, very refreshing as a this genre should be. One of the better beers of this style that I have had."
"the malts are arranged beautifully with a hop balance that just makes this beer a great brew. it has light carbonation, enough to make it crisp. it is very smooth with a medium to light body. the drinkability is right up there with the best of 'em. this is a fine pils, that is a must try for any beer drinker."
"The pour is a somewhat obscure golden yellow to amber color; the head is portly in size, frothy in its texture, with the lace quite thick and sticky sheets to cling to the sides of the glass. The light musk or musty tone noticed in this beer as with most organic beers, not unpleasant and sometimes just barely discernable, you really need to hunt them down, malt and crisp, fresh and clean to the palate. Start malt and sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish crisply acidic, passably hopped with a very dry lingering aftertaste and a pleasant enough beer, worth the sample in my humble opinion."
"Different appearance for a pilsner - hazy yellow, relatively light bodied and medium head with good carbonation. Not as hoppy as I expected but malts to start with a slightly hoppy finish. Better as a summer beer."
"Hazy yellow with a fine, frosty head that crawls up the glass with authority. The nose is quite ripe with sugary, candied, dried fruit, gum drops and Haribo candy. There is a faint whiff of alfalfa sprouts too. Rich, full texture is hewn into shape by bitter hops. Big, chewy, rustic flavor featuring notes of lemon, watercress and chervil. Seriously unique Pils."
"Quite hazy (bottle conditioned), golden with a creamy 1/4"" head that holds excellently and leaves some good lace. The aroma is of a sweetly floral and grassy hop that's lightly backed by malt. Excellent. The body is medium with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that gently caresses the tongue and becomes quite creamy as it warms in the mouth. The flavor starts with a great blend of rich, sweet malt and a unique floral hop flavor that's at least partially from Hallertauer. The sweet malt decreases as it crosses the palate, revealing some more grassy hop flavors and some bitterness. It finishes dry and fairly short with some lingering hop flavor and light bitterness as would be expected of a good pilsener. Very well balanced, allowing the malt and hop flavors to remain clear throughout while also giving an enjoyable bitter bite at the start, and maintaining enough bitterness to keep it dry and refreshing. Extremely well done, however, I must note that it's important to obtain a fresh sample. This is not a huge seller in the U.S., and I've had many old & damaged bottles before I came across this fresh one. I should also note that all Merchant Du Vin products are conspicuosly absent of any dating. (Sorry Charlie, but you know it's true)."
"Hazy yellow in hue even before the yeast sediment is poured.  The billowy, white, attractive persistent head leaves a good lace.  Sweet honey and cracker notes in aroma, followed by a pleasantly herbal noble hop nose.  Sharp, prickly carbonation and hop bitterness hits the palette at first, but fades quickly leaving bready notes and fairly high malt sweetness for style. Slightly musty, hay - like flavors are perceptible as well. Hop flavor is green and herbal.  The finish is just a touch bitter, but honey - like sweetness lingers long after the sip.  This is an odd pilsner but an interesting beer... malt sweetness is too dominant.  It's definitely a beer worth trying, however."
"Notes: Very interesting with raw complexities ... packed with flavour and could be paired with numerous types of foods, Pan-Asian worked best."
