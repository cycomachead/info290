"Again, just beautifully simple.  I love this, and it is a wonder that I don't drink it by the case.  Sometimes you lose sight, and have to go back to some of the best simple beers available, which are often the best anywhere."
"Best pilsner I've ever had"
"Appearance - pours pale clear with large head (I don't normally drink pilsner so this may be standard??) doesn't appear to be much carbonation. Head is frothy and white. Aroma -  smells of wheat. Taste - not sure if I haven't had a beer for a along time but initial thoughts are that this is a fantastic beer, very mild tasting, refreshing easy beer to drink. Wheaty taste. Mouthfeel - some carbonation, not overwhelming, it complements the beer if anything. Overall - really liked this beer, one of the better cool fermented beers I have had."

"I was psyched to find a bottle of this in my area but will be looking to try this again if I can find a fresher bottle."

"FEEL: semi-sweet and clear finish."

"500ml bottle. 07.10.15. Pours a straw colour with a frothy white head and some delicate lace. Aroma of straw, grain, bread and sulphur. Mild sweetness and gentle bitterness. Light bodied, smooth, sticky mouthfeel and a semi dry finish. A pretty decent pilsner from a brewer better known for it's wheat beers. 7."

"Grassy. Snappy. Light to medium body. Very very good German Pilsner"
"Looks good, can't smell feels good."
""
"Typical looking bubbling pilsner. Thin head. White lacing. Tastes like barley. Like eating barley. Tastes like a Michelob Lager for some reason. Or an Amstel Heavy."
"This is sooo delicious. Probably one of the best Pilsners I've ever had."
"T-Excellent taste of noble hop and grass following nose. Gets better the warmer it gets and half way thru no euro skunk at all. Fresher bottle would have been optimal but this is hard to find."
"Color is straw golden and perfectly clear.  Pours one finger worth of a fizzy white head.  Aroma is subtle, but consists of a little floral hop spiciness and a sweet dry malt.  Taste is along the same lines with mildly nutty pilsner malts upfront followed by a crisp spicy/herbal hop bite that follows to the finish.  Neither the hop or malt really overtake each other, yet both are showcased very well and are very complimentary of each other.  The feel is pretty dry, but there's enough malt to add some smoothness to the finish.  Light to medium bodied, medium to high carbonation, and perfectly clean in the finish. Just a great beer all round with great flavor and balance, and  the perfectly crisp/clean feel that you want from a pilsner."

"Possibly the best pilsner ever!"

"O -- When I tasted the first bottle of this Pils it really reminded me of SN's Summerfest Pilsner (points to SN).  The more you drink of the Weihen, the more you can taste the malt, hop, and yeast character differences between it and the SN Pils.  This makes me wonder (again) about Pasteurization and also the use of U.S. 2 row.  Overall, you can't go wrong with this Pilsner if you want to taste a good example."

"Overall: a typically good-quality traditional beer from Weihenstephan Brewery. While pilsner isn't one of my favourite styles, this is a good example. Decent for AU$70 a case too."
""
"This has to be one of my favourites all around, and in my opinion almost on par with the Hefe from this brewery and the best Pilsner i ever tasted, with Konig a not so far second. I really love it!"

"Taste is nice juicy herb, grain, lemon-apple with lean bread and firm, zesty bitterness."

"Medium light body and medium high carbonation."

"Overall - So this is what a Pilsner is supposed to taste like! This lager is the yardstick which other Pilsners should be compared to. It's a shame the Mega-American breweries choose not to make beers that taste like this."
""
""
""
""
"Great example of how German and Czech style lagers, at their best, can compete with nearly any ale. Crisp and refreshing, yet complex in its malt-hop balance, this is a true classic."

"Very good german pilsner. Pours a slightly cloudy, dark straw color with a foamy inch head that remains for a little bit before dissipating to just a bubbly layer. Some lacing left along the glass as you finish. Smell is malty with some direct yeast/bread notes. Very smooth and easy to drink. If you're in the mood for a german pils, hard to go wrong with this one - perfect amount of carbonation and nice dry finish."

"Overall / Drinkability: A full flavor pilsener, but perhaps just above average although high marks for appearance. However, it is a very drinkable beer. Like many German pilseners I've had, I feel this one is engineered to be drank in high quantities and go with a wide range of food, which in this case was pizza. I could easily have another one as everything together works well and it compliments/accents food, but doesn't get in the way."

"This is one's a classic, always nice to step back from the crazy brews once in a while and respect something more subtle, but not any less complex."
""
""
"A very well done pilsner though I would love a chance to try a more fresh version of this."
"Overall: Such a refreshing beer as the weather gets warmer here in Boston. More please."
"Hard pressed to find a more authentic and more satisfying lager, Weihenstephaner seems unable to make anything short of stellar!"

"Overall a tasty classic pils."

"What really makes this beer world class is the almost unbelievable creamy mouthfeel that it manages to produce with this style of beer."
""
""
""
""
"A good almost great Southern German Pilsner with interesting hops. Carbonation is a bit too sharp for my taste."
"Mouthfeel is light, effervescent, slight stickiness. Overall, I like it more than I thought I would."

"Lovely pale gold color poured into an oversize Pilsner glass. Medium to thin head left a lot of lacing. The smell is a nice cereal grain aroma with a touch of hop. Taste is refreshing and light, clean malty and a slight hop bitterness. Very clean and effervescent carbonation across the middle with pleasant hop bitterness on the back, which fades quickly. One of the most refreshing beers you will find. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear gold, active bubbles, 1/2 inch of white foam. Holds and slowly settles. Strong pils smell. Light hop spice. Light straw taste. Full German pils hop and perfectly carbonated. As tasty a pilsner as I have had. Perfect for the style."
"Clean but grainy initial sip. The swallow starts off lightly bitter but the aftertaste lingers a long time. Good body for the style, neutral carbonation."
""
"O- A very nice pilsner. Easily one of the best import pilsner a I have had."
""
"O: Nothing wrong with a good German Pilsner once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a shit-hot beer. So well crafted, plenty of character, but drinkable and refreshing as hell. If I ever feel myself doubting the greatness that can be exhibited by a pale lager, I'll revisit this one right here. Superb stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very refreshing and easy to drink a lot of. Another winner from Weihenstephaner."
"Other: This pils is different from ones from other German regions. North German pilsners taste a bit earthy, I find. Southwest German pilsners use much more assertive flavoring hops. This one, a Bavarian pils, tastes a bit more like a Czech one too me, probably due to its proximity and overall historic influence in the previously German-speaking areas of the Czech Republic where the pilsner style was invented."

"T- Very balanced indeed! Crisper and cleaner than the nose let on with the sugar scent. The malt is very well done, a perfect example of the style. Just a hint of pine. It’s obvious Noble hops were used in this baby, and the light earthy pine is very nicely blended in this brew."
"Brilliant straw yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, bright white foam that was constantly reinforced by a stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The white foam barely faltered as it left sheets of sticky lacing on the glass. Lemon and earthy grass aromas up front, with biscuit malt deep beneath. Medium bodied with rich, aggressive carbonation and a lightly crisp finish. Biscuit malt and herbal hop flavors from beginning to end. Light peppery flavor ramps up through the middle to the end. Finishes crisply with biscuit malt and hop bitter aftertaste. Aroma, feel and flavors are all very delicate. A pleasant, refreshing, easy drinking lager."

"O - My second beer from Weihenstephaner and I can't wait for the third. This beer is significantly greater than the sum of its parts and I think reviewing each alone does this beer a disservice. Enjoy on a warm summer day, as I did."
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"O: Still a style I struggle with sometimes, but this was pretty darn good. The sulfurous aromas and flavors that accompany so many pilseners (and acceptable for style) I find somewhat off-putting, but it's fairly mild here, and seems more integrated into the other aspects. Certainly recommended for someone looking for a good Pilsener."
""
""
""
"O: A solid German pils with some nice noble hop character that provides a light bitterness. Easy to drink and flavorful enough to be quaffable. A little simple, but that's nothing too serious"
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- A bit disappointing for me. It fits the style fine, but almost too bitter and yeast driven even for me."

"Light-bodied with a crisp bite, it remains lively and is pretty clean overall as well. It goes into a dry finish that's still smooth."

"This is the first time I've seen this beer sold in northern Virginia and I'm very glad I found it, as it is on of the very best pilsners I've ever had. I put this in the same class as Stoudt's pilsner and Victory Prima Pils. Pours a clear straw colored body with a bright white head that generously laces the glass. Very fresh, clean aromas here. Nothing icky to speak of, even after it warms. I get a lot of grassiness and sweeter notes of honey and cereal grains. On the palate this beer is very lively and electric. The aromas carry over perfectly to the front and mid-palate, where they are in perfect balance, before finishing on a refreshingly dry and almost tart. I enjoyed having it with an assortment of cheeses and berries. An excellent choice as the weather warms."
""
"11.2oz bottle, pours pale golden in color topped with a frothy white head, unbelievable clarity, good head retention, and some lacing is left at the top of the glass. Grassy aroma, pilsener malt, noble hop, fresh. Tastes are sharp & crisp, grassy, biscuity pilsener malt. Exceptionally smooth and finishes clean. World-class German Pilsener."
"I am a great fan of Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier so I decided to get a single of their Pils. The taste is sort of reminiscent of that beer at first sample. It is a solid beer, in my mind not the definitive Pilsner, but solid beer none the less. I am glad I only got a single as it was not that interesting to keep my interest."

"I was pretty excited to find a bottle from Weihenstephaner that's new to me, and it's even better that this is quite a nice pilsner. It pours pale yellow, a bright hay color. Quite clear. A big white head puffed up immediately and held its shape a good few inches over the top of the glass. Lots of bubbles sticking to the walls of the glass and such. Aroma is a mix of very fresh grain with some bright spicy hops. The hops are a bit milder than I'd like, but their aroma is nice. Pleasant, lightly tart flavor from the lager yeast. Malt is light and sweet. Taste has more of that light, yeasty tartness. Pretty crisp. There's some more of that quality pilsner malt sweetness, but the beer is fairly dry, particularly in the finish. Hops are spicy, grassy and floral. Mouthfeel is mildly tart and very clean. Weihenstephaner definitely shows off their technical skill with this beer. It just nails the classic pilsner flavors. It's tasty and extremely easy to drink. There's no off flavors to be found. This beer is pretty much what I wish macro lagers tasted like."
"So this is how a pilsner is supposed to taste, huh? This beer was pretty damn good - but that's typically to be expected from Weihenstephan. So clean, raw, pure, and nearly perfect within its element. This would be great to pound while outside on a hot, summer day. Easy to drink and easy to come around to - a benchmark for the style."

"This reminded me of drinking beers at the Hoffbrau house....its Ok ..not like OMFG what a great beer...if you had a giant pretzel and had some hot big racked frau serving you a 2L stien you would be damnnn I like this!!! NOT bad...Not Great...satisfying OK...ehhh...I'll have anutha'"

"That’s 2-for-2 for me on Weihenstephaner’s. Just a good pilsner."
""
""
""
"O: I feel that pilsners - when they're done well - provide a great example of simple refreshment in lieu of water. This is one I feel that stacks up nicely. It strikes a middle ground between the intensity of Prima Pils and the delicacy of Pilsner Urquell."
""
""
""
"Pleasing, clean, and refreshing. Weihenstephaner Pilsner is simple, yet is tasty, putting out pleasant grassy notes and pleasnt hop bitterness, backed by a honeysuckle and biscuit base. The beer is light bodied with modest crispness and is a simple pleasure to drink. Another one among many excellent choices from Weihenstephaner."
""
"O - a solid pilsner but nothing outstanding"
"O: A solid pils and what I can find from the Internets, it's fairly fresh. First time I've seen it in the Southland. Worth a pickup, but the regular Helles lager from these guys is the superior brew."
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some herbal and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and very easy to drink."
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and sessionable - enjoyable because of the moderate bitterness combined with the lighter body and bready malts."
""
""
"O: I found this to be a very solid pilsener beer that delivers a nice amount of bitterness (it really stands out given the light-bodied nature of this beer) and is easy to drink. This is a perfect choice to open up your palate with before a meal."
"Having been shut out of this beer due to the awesome distribution network outside of Cook County, I was glad to see it on tap. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam. The nose comprises grass, light biscuit, light wheat, sweet flowers, and a kiss of coriander. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a sort of stream-water character that goes very nicely with everything else. This is what a pilsner tastes like, son! The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a damn solid pils, no surprise considering the source."
""
""
"Great German pils. Malt and bitterness balance wonderfully. More than solid and very worthy."
"O-this isn't terrible, but besides the bitterness it has an adjunct quality to it. Definitely one of the hoppiest planets I've ever had. I recommend others to at least give this a try."
""
""
""
"Body is medium-light to light in weight, with lively, yet not prickly carbonation. The resultant mouthfeel is crisp and fast-flowing. Finish is dry."
"Drinkability is pretty high, this is a text book session pils. A bit more bittering than usual gives it a nice earthy backbone, but it's otherwise rather simple."
"Extremely refreshing. Very light body, moderately carbonated, moderately dry, great long finish. This is a wonderful pilsener- nothing fancy about it, just great, drinkable beer."
"Taste-Cracker,bready pilsner malt, crisp noble hop prescence, rather dry finish. Classic German Pilsner."
""
"O: a fine, light feeling, light colored, but quite flavorful pilsner."
"Carbonation is pretty bubbly. The finish is pretty malty. Overall well done."
"O: A nice crisp and refreshing beer and worth a pick up. Perhaps expected a bit more out of it due to it being a Weihenstephaner product, but it will stand up to most pilsners out there."
""
"Overall: perhaps not the best Pilsner I've had, but it is certainly drinkable."
""
"O: Not the best in the Weihenstaphan lineup, but not bad. Feels a little undercarbonated."
"Overall fairly good, starts off really well but gets a little too much overall on the flavor, a little too bitter, but full of flavor and drinkable, a little more crisp and clean on the finish would have made it a bit better, but otherwise a pretty good beer, and I wouldn't expect less from Weihenstephaner."
"o - Overall another good beer from Weihenstephaner. Not my favorite style, but a good example of it and a very nice, easy drinking summer beer. Highly recommended if you're looking for a pilsner."
""
""
""
"Lightly bitter with some grassy herbals and mild lemon zest. Light to medium boded, crisp with a crackery bone dry finish. Clean and refreshing, very quenching and drinkable. Overall it is virtually seamless, a textbook German pils that holds interest and above all is highly drinkable. Now if the only the German bars in town would put this on draft..."
"O: Pretty plain but it's drinkable at least. Has an odd sort of almost-skunkiness that I can't quite place my finger. It's not actually skunked, there's some quality that's similar."
""
"500 ml bottle into pilsener glass, bottled on 4/24/2012. Pours almost crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a nice amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of apple, pear, bready grain, grass, floral, and herbal spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; very pleasant. Taste of pear, apple, bready grain, pepper, floral, grass, herbal spiciness, and slight sulfur as it warms. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apple, pear, pepper, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance, with good complexity and fullness of flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Extremely easy to drink as expected. Overall this is an all around excellent pilsner. Great flavor balance and smoothness; with a nice crisp and flavorful finish. Weihenstephaner just knows how to nail a classic German style."
"Overall this was a good beer for a warm summer day."
""
"This is a wonderful dense pilsner and I like it's balance of sweetness, hop and dense malt. I rarely ever see this beer here, and I wish it would show up more often, it's fantastic, it might even be my favorite from the brewery."
"O - Love the hefeweisen from these guys and this is another good example of a traditional style."
""
"There have been quite a few fantastic beers bearing the name “Weihenstephaner” over the years. Pilsner isn’t quite fantastic, but it is pretty darn good. It’s a classic German Pilsner that features all the hallmarks of the style. If you’re in the market for a good German Pilsner, don’t overlook this one."
"A really nice pils; dry and grassy. Some light grain and sulfur notes but other than that really spot on."
""
"No off flavors and super clean tasting. Great pilsner beer."
"O- Avery fine pilsner in every regard. Highly recommend for lager and pilsner lovers."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Solid top to bottom very tasty. Cheers."
"A nice balanced pilsner flavor with good fruit and hop notes. Weihenstephaner seems like the Sierra Nevada of Germany."
""
""
""
"Hazy golden color that clears up as the head settles. White foam, good size and stick. Nose is grassy with a good dose of lemongrass hopping. Munich malt mingles with the pale. Flavor is fairly assertive for style and there is a decent finish of malt and hops -that is, actual beer ingredients. Other pilsners take note: this is a German pils with some attitude. Nice citric note in the middle for complexity raises my score a hair. "

"Food match: Would go well with seafood (calamari, crayfish, Atlantic trout or salmon) or grilled beef cuts (rump, t-bone or eye fillets are good)... or if you can't decide ""surf and turf"" it. Vegetarian option would be pan-fried portobello mushrooms with a mesclun vinaigrette salad."
"O - Pleasant and drinkable. Nothing wrong with this lager. Well-crafted as you'd expect from the Weihenstaphan brewery."
"O- It's a good beer. There is nothing exceptional about it but it's worth a try."
"M: It is a refreshing tasting but in general a little too bitter, at some point it is balanced with some bittersweetness, the ending is good a little dry on the back."
"O: Very honest German Pilsener. Weihenstephaner quality. Recommended"
"Not my favorite from them by a long shot, but still pretty tasty."
"Overall this is fantastic! If you love your pilsners you will love this beer. I could easily see this as a session beer."
"The Pilsner could be called something like the ""invisible brew"" (or the like): you may sell, almost no color, no smell and no taste ... but surprisingly the lack of attributes actually works very well and defines a classy Pils of potent pureness ...."
"Brilliant, old school pils. These days I've been drinking more along the new world pils lines but this is a good reminder of how it's done. Laced very nicely. Nose is soft, subtle and floral. Really pleasant. Brilliantly flavourful without being overpowering or in your face. Like a hot chick walking down the street who knows she's hot but she doesn't acknowledge all the dudes staring at her. A really creamy mouthfeel with moderate bitterness, a long finish and the feeling that you've drunk a beer worth remembering."
"Overall my write up is probably a little harsh after being impressed by other Weihenstephan brews. This isn't a bad German pilsner but their are others which have impressed me far more. I might have enjoyed this more paired with a good steak, or maybe my palate just wasn't in the mood today. I'm willing to give it another go, but I'm not in any rush to do so."
"Clean and refreshing, this beer has all the hallmarks of a classic pils in terms of flavour and aroma. Unfortunately, it lacks the crisp dryness that makes a pils great."
"Not enjoyable, but at least it wasn't the usual euro skunky lager."
"This beer pours a pale see thru honeyish colour that has decent carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head with average lacing it has nice aromas of hubba bubba grape bubblegum filled noble,grassy hops a very pleasant aroma and the taste is as beautiful as the aroma it has a thin mouthfeel to be expected for the style that is perfectly balanced out with the crisp fresh tastes of noble hops with a soft bubblegum finish,i really like this beer and plan on making it a known face in my collection,in my eyes a well known breweries hidden jewel."
"D: Drinkable as hell, I could drink this endlessly without even realizing I was drinking... to be honest, its too drinkable for my tastes, but that is the style's hallmark. Most foods would probably overpower this beer, but It would be interesting to try with some milder flavored things such as a spinach salad or a mild fish with a fresh lemon squeezed on it. A spicy food might also go well with it."
"This brew is very clean and a beautiful example of the style. There is even a slight warming finish, which is odd with only a moderate ABV. This pils deserves your serious attention."
"Taste is a bit weak and watery, again with a bit of an unwelcome sticky yeast. A few hops on the front palate. The finish is a bit dry and bitter which is good but the main palate is not tasty enough to impress. It's decent drinking but I'd expect more from Weihenstephaner. Could use more bittering hops and aroma hops, really. Just a bit flavourless and the yeast seeps through too much. Mouthfeel is fizzy and overcarbonated."
"An ok pils but not as good as I would expect from this lot."
"Tasted nice, a balance of lightness, bitterness and hops, and breadiness. Slightly more distinctive hop flavor than the average pils. Solid overall. Not as smooth in terms of carbonation as I expected, but whatever. Good."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style German pilsener."
"Not an overly complex beer by any stretch, but this is a top session beer. At the price and size and availability (in Aus at least) it is well worth a look at."
"Had this at a Biergarten in Lichtefelde West in Berlin. I think this is by far one of the best and most unique German Pils I've had. It's not as skunky and boring as a lot of the German pils.. nothing like Victory Prima Pils etc so it's a little unorthodox. Significantly sweeter, candylike, but still with a clean pilsner taste that makes you keep wanting to drink it."
"Pours a rather light golden colour. Very clear. Has a very thick creamy head that lasts quite a while and laces the glass all the way down. Smells very citrusy sweet and malty. Has a very crisp taste with light carbonation. The beer has a nice bite to it before it smooths out. Quite enjoyable."
"The peculiar characteristic of this beer is the balance and cleaning. Pleasant, elegant and drinkable remarkable way. The votes have been revised accordingly."
"2009 EDIT: Okay, many reviews I did in 07/08 were inaccurate and contained idiotic statements due to my lack of beer experience at the time, but this is possibly the most inaccurate of them all. I have now decided this is the best German Pilsener I have tried, thanks to its fantastic balance and lack of flaws. The score has been bumped up from 3.45 to 4."
"D - A pretty decent pilsener. Tasty & sessionable."
"Pours a golden straw color with a decent amount of foamy white head that sticks around for a while, but eventually fades to a thin layer. Smells slightly of noble hops with some floral aroma there as well. The taste is clean, with some slightly malty sweetness there, but there's a lot of noble hop flavor and enough bitterness to finish a little bitter. Mouthfeel is light and creamy, very nice. Overall, it's a very drinkable pilsener, wouldn't hesitate to get it again."
"Interesting that I tried this one day after Pilsner Urquell. PU is definitely the more interesting, tastier pils, but I feel that this is better quality and fresher. Price is on the high side, but so is the quality, so value is average. That said, I've heard that many Weihenstephaner beers are cheaper than soft drink in Germany. All I can say is, lucky bloody Germans!"
"thanks to finite for sending this out."
"Excellent stuff. Excellent brewery."
"The only drawback is that it's rather boring to look at. No head. No lacing, and a rather common color."
"Certainly a summer beer ,to drink to slake the first , but has enoughquality to savour."
"D: this brewery makes brilliant hefe-weizen but this beer is out of that league of brilliance. Despite its decent quality, it's just a standard German lager in need drier characters to mimick northern German lagers, or more aromatic and hoppier presence to compete with its Bohemian counterpart, or a maltier body to immitate the Bavarian Helles, as in itself nothing much stands out. (Or maybe it's just my bias in favour of Czech Pilsner that makes me think so~~)"
"Bottle. Sparkling clear pale gold, not much head and what there was didn't stick around (although I am suspicious of my glass). Sweet malty, cookie dough aroma with very subtle flowers from the hops. Taste starts with the sweet malt, then finishes lightly dry and bitter. Not being a big hop head I find it much better balanced in this respect than the few other Pilsner styles tried so far. Light slightly watery mouthfeel. Very crisp and refreshing."
"Like all Weihenstephaner's it was lightly carbonated so you could fully appreciate the beer. Definitely a beer I'm going to look out for."
