"An interesting beer, no doubt: ""The first to use the Belma hops, discovered growing wild on a farm in the Yakima Vallley"". It's slightly hazy in the glass, perhaps from dry-hopping, and topped by a fluffy head of bright white. The head retention is quite good, as is the lacing left behind. In the nose it's a touch minty, softly grassy, delicately floral, and subtly fruity (apple) over a straightforward, grainy, golden malt base. The same hop components remain in the flavor with the almost spearmint like minty-ness stepping forward. It's not very bitter and therefore the malt seems quite solid and somewhat sweetish, yet it remains balanced overall. However, the two components don't really seem to mesh well. The hops appear, backed by the malt, and it pretty much stays that way until the swallow where the bitterness comes up a bit, as do the more grassy flavors of the hops. On the other hand, a little less malt would leave the beer lacking overall. It remains interesting, enjoyable, and refreshing. Worth trying!"

"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent poundable beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
"A decent pils.  I would like to see it a touch drier and perhaps a touch more grassy but the flavors are on point for the style."
""
""
"3.63/5.00"
""
"Pours a clear medium deep gold with a nice thick white head. The head settles down leaving some soapy lacing. The aroma is just the slightest hint of noble hope and the taste is also barely there. Nice weight and feel to the body. Wish this was more flavorful because everything else about it is well-done."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a bit dry however, of perhaps overdone or singular in nature malt  breakdown.   Not very characteristic for a pils yet not bad either.  Feel is decent and full given the hop presence.  As such this drinks more like a light Belgian Pale than a German Pils.  Still it struggles with a very short finish.  Still I'd buy it again, an interesting offering."
""
""
""
"O/D - Definitely not my cuppa. The hop profile is definitely not prevalent and it ends up being closer to a European adjunct lager. Not worth the time."
""
""
""
"Pours clear & golden color with a fizzy and foamy white head that retains nicely, leaving some lacing behind.  Flowery hop aroma with a hint of grassy notes.  Fruity and crisp flavor with some berry notes, floral notes kick in before giving way to a bready malt backbone.  Medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel and crisp finish.  Nice flavorful pilsner with high drinkability"
"Overall:  Nice pilsner.  I'll take another."

"The Verdict: Surprisingly good. The wild hops give it a nice flavor and a hint of complexity. Good session beer at a good price."
""
"Pours a golden body with a small white head with good retention and a bit of lacing. Aromas are sweet and practically epitomize the word ""grassy.""  I get a light citrusy note as well. Taste is very balanced between English muffin-like malts and grassy hops with an orange peel prickle. Grains linger long on the finish. I like this a lot. Very solid."
"The flavor snaps with a pleasing hop profile that demonstrates more of the melon flavors. Not bad and a steal for the price."

"O: I enjoyed this beer although I kept going back to Adirondack Lager for its bready, more classic noble hoppiness -- more refreshing and flavorful at once. Wild Hop Pils is pretty good, but there are many better Bohemian and German pils out there. This one treads the line between the two although tends more to the German side."
""

"I just love the sound  of a good Crack! in the morning. Leave it to Saranac to brighten the day with something wild. I celebrated with an inverted Glug and then sat back and watched the pseudo-cascade. It developed into two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with great retention. Color was solid-Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity. Of course, this acted as the clarion call for Midas, Mammon and Croesus to show up and begin squabbling amongst themselves for a taste. I CAN hardly put up with it any more. Nose had an earthy, peppery bite and I was inspired to ask my neighbor to plant peppers next year. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was very earthy, like something freshly harvested. Wet-hopped, perhaps? It also had a cereal-like maltiness, so I would put it as a German-style Pils. Finish was crisp and dry and would make an excellent addition to the cooler on a hot, humid Summer’s day."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a medium body, average carbonation and a bready finish that's on the dry side and clean. Overall a very nice pils that is much hoppier than most pils and much more flavorful."

"O: an interesting beer worth trying for the rare Belman hops."
""

"O: Overall it is light, crispy and has a touch of zing. I appreciate that they are trying to showcase a new hop, but the hops upstage the style. Still a good beer, and would be great for hot days."
""
"Light and clear in color, decent head, good lacing. I was a little hesitant, having tried other pilseners that were over-hopped. This is a good pilsener, dry and moderately hoppy, slightly toasty, well balanced. A very good product, good for a summer day. I would drink it again."

"It's inoffensive, but doesn't give the pils angle justice. Looks and aroma brings some goods, but the package doesn't deliver."
""
""
""
""
"One of a handful of my current favorites!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep golden color with fine clarity. The foamy white head sticks around forever it seems, and for sure looks inviting. Underneath the veil of froth the aroma is bright and hoppy with some toasted bread. In the taste, citrus and some dirtier, earthier aspects. Has a light spiciness to the hops as well. The body is light and decently carbonated, and the finish has a clean citrus to it. Overall, Matt Brewing knows how to make easy drinking beers and this is no exception. A nice option if you're looking into Pilsner."

"A good beer with no faults other then needing more hops."

"O: Overall good drinkability, softly balanced making for prime session material. Won't blow you out hop wise but is more subtle and traditional finishing out with a spicy bite perfect for that warm summer day in the backyard. The hops seem to get more appreciable deeper into the drink."
""
"O - Refreshing when cold, disappointing warming up"
"Light fully clear gold colored beer. Aroma is sweet chewy grains, Vienna like malt, and crisp grass, floral, citrus, and a soft presence of strawberry ice cream. Taste is nicely grainy as well. Fruity berries, creamy malt, light lemon peel citrus as the bitterness hits. Not really a pilsner but definitely a refreshing lager with a unique hop profile."
"One of Saranac's best beers, this is a success."
""
"Clear gold with a hefty head of big-bubbled foam. Smells fruity and floral with some lightly sweet toasted grain and a hint of grass. I definitely get that berry-like aroma that comes from Belma hops, though it's subtle. A little too much caramel breadiness in the flavor upfront (for a pilsner), but the strawberry, citrus, and melon quickly blends in, resulting in a fairly unique pale lager. It actually results in something closer to a Vienna lager with a hoppy twist. Light, but not without a certain creaminess before finishing crisp. Ignoring the ""Pils"" on the label, this is a fine, drinkable lager."
"o: Whether a more traditional pilsner or a good lager, a fine summer refresher with more substance to it than most pilsners and some lagers today. Given the name, however, hopheads will be disappointed unless they see the IBUs ahead of time on the bottle neck."

"O: I found this to be a very nice offering from Saranac that goes down easily but is very tasty. The use of the Belma hops added pleasant citrusy aromas and flavors. These make it more like an IPA than a pilsner, so I would have labeled this as a ""Wild Hop IPL""."
"overall: great beer for the price, a keeper."
""
""
""

"Love it! I could not wait to buy this beer again this year."
"Overall - Fantastic, crisp, summer refresher. In my opinion way underrated in this forum."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not worth picking up again. In a way it's actual not a bad Pilsner/lager but I am not a big fan of the style in the least. Sorry."
""
""
""
"Not worth going back to. Five more Saranac's to go in this mix pack."
"O: Solid - more as a generic ""lager"" than as a pilsner, however. Would be a decent summer quaffer, especially given the cans and the modest (5.2%) ABV."
""
"Extremely well balanced with a pretty unique hoppiness though not too far off the deep end, simply just subtle which is all that is really needed in a highly drinkable pils."

"Overall: A great little pilsner. Great appearance, aroma, taste and at a great price too, especially for this ""experimental"" beer. It has been a long time since I have had anything from Saranac, but I used to love the lagers they put out. I will seek out more!"
""
"Yellow color with moderate carbonation and moderate head. Usual suspects in aroma. Average appearance and aroma. Tastes better than it smells. It has more depth than you might suspect. Nice hop, floral, and lots of herbal notes. Finishes solid, no change."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours translucent straw with a fluffy white head. Smells of sweet grain and some fruit, a little citrus. Tastes of grain with some small fruit berries. Beer is light bodied carbonated correctly goes down easy. Overall, an above average beer."

"An aroma that's floral and spicy. Pours deep golden yellow with decent white head. Head has poor retention. Spotty lacing to the glass. Taste is of a delicate hop and bready grains , a touch sour in the finish. Decent, but not delectable!"
"The body verges on light but is nice and crisp, giving up just a little cleanness for more smoothness underneath."
""
"Quite good. Pour was with little head, and it is definitely more orange than a true, blonde pilsner; leaves a really nice lace though. The belma hops, which I have had in a few beers, works surprising well with style. This is for sure my favorite belma hops beer. I hope they continue to make this beer, it is pretty different and also pretty good."
""
"Overall – The rather crisp and refreshing brew that is fantastic for a nice warm day. A very tasty summer day brew."

"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date of 10/31/13. Pours a translucent light golden color with a thin ring of head. Good amount of lacing.The aroma is floral hops with some malts, cereal and sweet bread. The taste is some floral hops upfront with some cut grass and malts. Sweet bread and cereal flavors followed by slightly bitter floral hops at the end. Bit of a soapy/perfume aftertaste. Light and crisp and light bodied. Easy drinker with a decent hop presence. Overall, solid beer to find in a mix pack that is perfect for summer."

"O - This is a pretty good beer. Saranac is a decent brewery which has it's good beers and it's so-so beers, and this is one of the better ones I've tried. A great summer beer that isn;t gimmicky. Extremely sessionable, yet still packs a lot of great flavor. I hope Saranac will someday distribute this in 6'ers or 12'ers, as I've never seen them before. Highly recommend this beer for any fans of quality, flavorful lagers and/or pilseners."
"Date tasted: June 23, 2013... Glassware: Paulaner pilsner... Occasion: a good work weekend comes to its end... Appearance: nice golden body; white head is crisp, thick and foamy--tantalizing... Aroma: prime,, pleasant fragrance of softened hops; citrus and a bit of musky malt makes for an intriguing, antagonistic pair... Palate: a rounded mouthfeel, unexpected in a pilsner; definitely profiles as a thicker,, grainier version... Taste: a taut ping that resounds, then a malty base of hops keeps this less dense and less ""wild"" than expected; heavier aftertaste as well doesn't endear... Overall: a bit warming as the glass drains; a different experience when arranged with others of the same style....overall, a compliment to Saranac that it is a unique product by their standards...."

"brewed with the newly discovered belma hops, I like this pilsener that has a lot more hop flavor than most of these do. its got an enticing pale yellow color, but the head falls down a bit, struggles to maintain itself. the nose is hoppy for the style, lots of darker fruits amongst the mold bitterness, and very unique complexion. the pilsener malts appear german to me, light and dusty, with that cornbread sort of sweetness, but much more delicate. the flavor is just like the nose, with the hops actually taking a bit of a back seat to the grains, although the hops are very interesting and new to my palate. I get an almost blackberry flavor in the finish, u really like this in the summer mix. ultra light in body, and impressively clean in the finish, but still bringing a lot of flavor. this is really nice in the summer, a beer I will happily return to when it is around. maybe the surprise of this years beers of summer."
"It's unusual. Not bad, though. I'd drink this again; it's solid."
"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed pilsner glass, the beer is a crystal clear, straw yellow coloring with a frothy, clingy, bright white head and champagne amounts of carbonation bubbling. Toasted grains and floral highlights fill the nose, with hints of resiny hops. Flavors are tangy sweet, with a honey and floral backbone and resiny overlay. Roasty and sweet aftertaste, with a dry feel at the end. Great clinging lace as you drink. The beer is kept light and frothy by the carbonation. Clean and effervescent finish. Interesting take on the style, and rather tasty."

"Pours bright golden color, see through, some white foam on top. Light beer smell. Mild. Clean, crisp pils taste, modest hop build up, and then a quick finish. Light bite. Light bodied, yet noticeable flavor. Good beer for a summer mix pack."
"Same hop profile that I believe Sam Adams reintroduced to the world with their Noble Pils a few years back. Roasted skunk hops, is what I refer to it as."

"O - easy drinking summertime beer."

"Light golden pale fizzy beer with big fluffy white head fine speckled lacing evenly dispersed down the sides of my glass. Aroma light Belma hops grassy citrus biscuit malt simple combo but very tasty. Flavor well made beer using a new hop variety found growing wild in the Yakima Valley. Unique bite of citrus and ample bitterness light biscuit malt sweetness crisp refreshing drinking beer. Mouthfeel is even keeled on the palate finishes crisp and dry light bodied ample carbonation keeps each sip rolling. Overall a tasty summer beer I hope to see it available in six packs."

"Overall a tasty easy drinking pils. Enjoyable."

"overall- this is a good beer but not something i would seek out just because it isn't a very exciting beer..well worth the money though and great to share with non-craft beer drinkers"
""
""
"There is nothing really outstanding about this drink. It's enjoyable and refreshing. You could almost guzzle it like tea. It's basically a very lightly hoppy floral brew that works well with hot days. I probably wouldn't get this again, but I'd drink it again."
"This shouldn't be classified as an American Wild Ale because it is a pilsner."
"The hops can be found more clearly in the taste after I get that quick grain note. Low bitterness and highly drinkable warm weather beer. I thought it was pretty good."
