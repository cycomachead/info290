Helping Bavik is its light body and crisp and lively carbonation bubbles. It's a decent lager overall, and a possible  simple alternative in the land of Duvel, Cantillon, and Chimay.","DoubleJ","Feb 15, 2015"

Smell was minimal, basically that of an adjunct lager.  The taste was adequate.  I would sum it up as a downscale Stella Artois.  Mouthfeel was light and extremely carbonated.

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of pale malt, hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a clean finish with no lingering flavors. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good pilsner. Well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A bit bland on character, but not watery. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2014"

The flavor is grainy with hint of minerals. The finish is fairly bitter and dry. Almost makes me think of light version of Duvel.

Picked these up in a six pack of cans, which I can see coming in very handy at the lake next summer. Kudos to craft breweries who are busting out the cans. A hazy golden pour finishes with a two-finger quickly fading off-white head. There's a streaky lacing left behind. You get a little skunk on the nose at first, but no the off-putting kind, which you get with some brews. Smells a little sweet, malty and medicinal as well. Tastes sweet and malty, and not as crisp as expected. It could have been a bit bigger on the hops at the end which usually balances things off. Really good pilsner's have to pull that off well in my book. It's highly carbonated according to the style, and pretty drinkable overall, although a bit lacking in the taste and mouth-feel departments, and a bit softer around the edges than I like in a pilsner.","stephens101","Oct 23, 2008"

It clearly isn't though, but there is a very sweet malt presence and a not very appealing mild hop smell. The more I smell it, the more I just pick up the sweet malt. I like the malt in the flavor, it's strong enough to give this beer a good flavor, in the pils style, but the hops are all wrong for a pils, they are kind of weak and not especially flavorful, kind of leaving an odd bitterness toward the finish. That being said, it is very light, doesn't actually taste bad, and actually I'm coming to kind of like it.

The mouthfeel was subpar but overall a beer one could enjoy on a night of heavy drinking for it's lightness and flavor.","rustymoore","Feb 03, 2006"

Medium-high carbonation with big white head and great lacing. Probably one of the best beers I have had in a can. Better than Heineken cans, and OBVIUOSLY better than Bud, Miller, etc.","ahking","Jan 25, 2006"

3.95,19.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Aroma has a nice spicy-woody aspect to it, along with a slightly grainy note. Not very strong-smelling but probably appropriate for style. The flavor is clean, nicely bitter at the end, and dry, with a mild hop and malt flavor that is pleasant although a little underwhelming. The balance is good in this beer, its refreshing but beefy. Not my first choice but for the style I'd say its pretty good.","KroMagnon","Aug 23, 2005"

A little light on the carbonation for a pilsner. Bready malts form the base of the flavor with nice Saaz-like hop tones. Flowery hops add a nice touch.

2.83,-14.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall: I have had this before many, many times in Belgium, and I honestly think its one of the better for the masses Pils out there. Its clean, crisp and actually has some Pils-like flavor, unlike the Alken-Maes and Jupiler home-grown contenders, if only Bavik to get this more widely distributed. Nothing outstanding but certainly not one of the worst Belgium Pils on the market. I think I will try the Cans when I see them back in the USA.","TheLongBeachBum","May 14, 2005"
2.77,-16.3,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Picked up at Kahn's in Indy on a whim. The can actually reminded me a little of Brahma, especially once i saw ""cerveja"" on it. Anyways, an agressive pour leads to a 2 finger white head with large soapy bubbles atop a straw yellow body with some particles in suspension. Nose is sweet and malty much like a typical euro lager. Taste finishes a tad metallic, not generally pleasant. I'll probably pass on this one next time.","soper2000","Dec 03, 2004"
3.02,-8.8,3,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Not bad, overall, but nothing special. It's probably considerably better becaus eof it's brown bottle packaging. I just hope there isn't anyone out there who thinks this is representative of Belgian beer.","nortmand","Oct 27, 2004"
3.47,4.8,2,2.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer represents the notion to not judge a book by its cover. Nothing impressed me at first. The label looked cheap, appearance was nothing impressive - very pale with little carbonation, no aroma to speak of. All this changed from the first sip to the last. Fantastic light taste that was above and beyond any domestic light beers or even Pilsner Urquell. Went down great. Bought this in a mix and match single and will definitely try it again. Paid $1.59 for the bottle.","Backer2004","Oct 24, 2004"
3.3,-0.3,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy golden pilsener color with a fluffy white head. Yeasty, grassy, husky and bready nose, rather clean smelling. Tastes rather fruity in the malt and the bouquet of the hops ties together pretty nicely. Starts rather malty sweet, then there's a watery portion mid-palate and a faint tartness and dryness in the finish. Very atypical for a Euro pils, but it seems right for a Belgian pils. Possesses unique characteristics the the Interbrew adulterated version is missing.","crookedhalo","Aug 06, 2004"
3.18,-3.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"A Belgian lager? I havent seen many of these before so I decided to give it a try. The beer appeared very lagerish in color with a foamy white head that stayed the whole time I drank it. Lots of bubbles racing to the top but not much lacing. This beer was really sweet for a lager/German pils. The upfront sweetness was almost too much for me but it had a really smooth mouthfeel to it. The base of this beer was grainy and sweet as well. The hops came in a provided a profound spicy flavor to this beer. It seems like there were more spices (clove, coriander?) added to this beer at the end of the fermentation b/c it was almost overly spicy in the finish. This was a decent beer that complemented my cherry bbq chicken well but I couldnt drink this one as a session.","granger10","Jul 25, 2004"

Decent overall lacing on the glass. Weird yeasty aroma, musty with some nutmeg and grass components. Starts light and perfumey on the tongue, sweet and even a little estery. No real hop sense. Body thins markedly later, as does the taste, but strangely, there's little carbonation and a weird slick sensation that's almost like flat Ginger Ale.

A beer I can take on our local beach, or condo pool (no glass allowed). It pours a straw/gold color and holds a substantial frothy white head and lots of clingy lace. The aroma leaves a little to be desired with a raw malty, hop and odd damp basement smell. A modest sweetish malt, almost oily body blends well with the spicy and slightly metallic hops. A faint citrus taste comes and goes. A light alcohol fuminess is noticeable throughout. Better than Heineken.","BeerResearcher","Jun 12, 2003"

2.58,-22.1,3,2.5,2.5,2,3,"I found this to be a rather odd beer. In some ways a sterotypical euro-lager - very sweet and bready with a hint of grassy flavors. Mouthfeel was extremely soft, as though they had been over-tinkering with the water ph. Sweetness and bread flavors went beyond the euro-lager norm, however, and clear Belgian influences were present - it bordered on a Belgian white ale, without the spices.","Brent","Mar 23, 2003"
3.8,14.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Slightly hazy, yellowish gold with a firm, bright-white head that holds very well and leaves excellent lace. The aroma offers a full, grainy maltiness and an herbal hoppiness. The body is light-medium, and it has a very fine, restrained carbonation. Very smooth & creamy in the mouth. The flavor has, surprisingly, a light touch of Belgian ""mustiness"" which is not normally found in their pilseners. The malt is well balanced with bitterness & there's some lightly woody & herbal hop flavor. The hops are confusing - or is that interesting - to me. I can't identify any variety, or even a general characteristic, other than the ""dried leaves"" note it has - and maybe a little bit of light, dried pine. I wonder if they're using aged hops; and yet that doesn't seem the case either! Odd. The finish is semi-sweet / semi-dry with some nice bitterness but also a sticky maltiness, although there's also a gently lingering earthy & mineral quality that helps to dry it out. This one is a quagmire. It's not a very good example of a pilsener at all. And it doesn't have any stand out qualities. But it is interesting & memorable. If it was a touch drier it might be better - but then it would be like every other mediocre Belgian pilsener. I have to give it some credit for its uniqueness (although that's not reflected in the score). I certainly wouldn't buy a case of this, but I found it interesting enough to suggest trying one to see what it's like.","NeroFiddled","Sep 14, 2002"
