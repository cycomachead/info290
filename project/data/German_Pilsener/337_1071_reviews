"Not fantastic, but it is a well done Pilsner. Bolder aroma and increased hop bite would take this to another level."

"Overall: A great american-made pilsner that is perfect for the summer time. For those outside of Texas, if you're a fan of Sierra Nevada Summerfest then you will love this. I personally like my pilsners with more of a hop bite but I'm sure many appreciate the slightly sweet finish."

"Refreshing, light pilsner. Malty with a nice hop balance. One of my favorites. I have had this beer on tap and was well impressed. Just tried a bottled version and I was not disappointed. I am only sorry this is a seasonal brew. Excellent accompaniment with summer cookouts."

"Flavor wise it goes even further downhill, its got a really funky earthy flavor, almost musty and skunky. Its overcarbonated and almost abrasive going down, I had to slow sip this and I'm used to nursing imperial stouts. It just tasted funky, reminded me of a wad of grass clippings, it wasn't crisp or refreshing, reminds me of nasty macro AAL beer. No hop character, not smooth, not enjoyable at all."

"Despite its early impressions, Summer Pils turned out to be a satisfactory brew in the end. At first take, the appearance and smell combine to form a beer that seems to be not much better than PBR. Much of this is forgiven once you take a sip and are greeted by pleasant citrus hop notes and a decent mouthfeel. Not my first choice in Pilsners, but one could surely do much worse while living in Houston for the summer."

"Overall: Maybe it's me, but I really like to taste PILS (malt) in my Pils! It's got some sweetness kicking around in the back and some sides to the front, but it's only when you swig it all around the mouth do you get some as it hits all parts of the tongue at the same time... and then, after awhile, I taste lots of Sweet Pils malt, but still, it's hard to find it. From mouthfeel, it's a typical German, yet the aroma is poor and reminds me of a Fernsehbier. I'm torn whether I like this beer. For the American market, maybe a very bitter beer with little Pils malt flavor is a winner, but not for me. Again, I want Pils in my Pils, and a Pils without a decent amount of the Pils malts showing up is a weak beer. Overall, it's not a bad beer, but I'm not saying I'd drink this as a ""summer"" beer. A 3.4 of 5."

"Overall: This was an ok brew."
""
"The Summer Pils poured a light straw color with a substantial head. It had a bright, light taste and body that helped beat the hot afternoon. There was enough flavor to keep things interesting and bold but without weighing itself down. While not being on the level of some of the top Pilsners in the world it is a solid Texas pilsner."

"D: DMS has kind of stamped it's way onto this brew and is not letting go. from the nose to the palate it is a bit distracting. without much hop presence this is a big pass from me."

"Pours golden yellow with 2 finger width foamy head with some carbonated bubbles. Head quickly dissipates leaving very little lacing on glass. Aroma of stale fruits that is typical of lagers. Taste of pilsner malts up front followed by mild hop bitterness and stale fruit - possibly banana. Not really a fan of lagers but this one is refreshing and decent to drink in the summer around the pool."

"Overall: After the first, I enjoyed this with homemade guacamole and it was a perfect match for fresh jalapeno and cilantro. I plan on buying several 6 packs of this for entertaining people who drink light beer alongside Mexican meals. A superior pilsner to most market bulk buys."
"but it's not spectacular. I'd love to say it is, but it's overall character is just a tick above average, nothing more."

"So it's April in Houston and that means its Summer time again. I saw Saint Arnold's seasonal change once again, so I grab a six as I always do. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass although sometimes I drink this one straight from the bottle. Aggressive pour right down the center makes a huge white foamy head that I know won't stick around. Golden yellow with little lacing as the glass goes down. Little nose on it, just a wheaty scent. Just an average pils for me, I use to drink this more but it seems my tastes have changed over the years. It's a good sessionable beer but that's about all. Just average in my opinion."

"O - An awesome summer beer, definitely sessionable and would be great to drink on a riding lawnmower on a hot summers day. Good stuff!"

"A good pils that I could drink more of on a hot summer day."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours pale golden with a white head. There are plenty of streaming tiny bubbles visible rising from the bottom of the glass. There is some lacing left behind as the head dissipates. The beer smells of biscuit and cracker with some hops. The taste follows the nose. There is the grainy character from the pale malts that lends the biscuit character. The hops lend some subtle background citrus and bitter flavors. The body is light with plentiful carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer."
""
"Pours a clear, straw-to-gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, wheat, hint of sweet malt, and hint of citrus. Fits the style of a German Pilsner. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of wheat. Overall, good feel, decent appearance, and good blend. Lacking in body and aroma, though."

"Overall great summer beer; especially when extremely cold. I have also drunk this from a bottle and my opinion of it did not change. Good Texas beer and that is not just because I am from Houston."
"This is what I would call an ""American Pils"". It's a standard golden color. Pour it vertically if you want any amount of head on it, because it'll be gone in a couple minutes. It otherwise maintains its carbonation throughout. There's very little scent from this. The taste is light and crisp, similar to an American lager. It's just bitter enough to leave a small bit of aftertaste. My personal preference is a pils with big hops. This is on the other end of the spectrum, and you'll want to hammer it down lest it get warm. It's probably worth a putting a six pack on the fridge this summer to see if you like it. I'll be moving on to a good Kolsch or a hoppier Pils, tho' I might just pick up another six of SA Summer Pils."

"O: Good summertime beer. Goes best with the hot Texas weather."
""

"The taste and mouthfeel in this brew are going to seem a bit weak to hopheads and craft beer enthusiasts, but they're cleanly done and come through exactly as intended, with no off-flavors or skunkiness. Pleasant to knock back a couple of these after working in the yard on a summer day."

"The aroma was loaded down with cereal grains and a touch of light fruity yeast. The aroma of banana clearly evident as was a nice fresh grass like hoppy nose. The flavor followed right along with it, being very light in profile and feel and very highly carbonated. List grain flavors dominated with a nice earthy feel. Hints of banana and fresh grass running through it as well, with a very nice light, refreshing taste."

"Awesome beer, one of my favorite examples of a pilsner, and lagers in general."

"D: Very drinkable and smooth."
"O- I am biased toward liking St. Arnold. However, I like other S.A. styles better. Average."
"O- Decent pilsner. Heavier than most."
"O-i actually like this pils. although i am not a fan of the style if im ever in texas on a budget ina hot summers day. ill grab a few why not."
"O- Overall this is a pretty decent beer from Saint Arnolds. I could see myself buying a six pack of this to help combat the scorching Oklahoma heat right now. Definently a lawn mower beer. I would have it again."
"RJT"
"While this isn't as hoppy as I'd like it to be for a pilsner, this is still a good beer. This is a damn good beer to choose to drink on a hot summer Texas day."
"O - A good pilsener and a great summer session beer overall."
"Poured a nice golden color with white one-finger head that dissipated fairly quickly. Very little grassy aroma. Taste is a bit bready, nutty, and grassy. Mouth feel is good and this has proper carbonation. Had this after Stoudt Pils which is a superior beer and might have influenced my rating. Still, this is a decent Pils that is refreshing. Actually liked this better than the first bottle I tried. Somewhat of a disappointment as every other St. Arnold beer I have had ( Fancy Lawnmower, Winter Stout, Spring Bock, and Divine Reserve) have been way above average."
"O: Not the best pils in the world, but I really like this beer on a hot day. Could easily down a sixer of these. Refreshing with enough taste to keep it interesting. At the price point I will probably make this a regular in my fridge during the texas summer."
"Clear gold body, medium carbonation under gleaming bright white body, slow dissipation with good lacing, a nice looking beer. Nose is sweet and dry bready malts, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and dry finish. The best Texas Pilsener I've had so far."
"O: a bit better than bmc b/c of hop bitterness. the smell and body are underwhelming at best. probably a good summer beer, as the title suggests. I'd chug one after mowing the lawn, but that's about it. i'm fairly sure i've over rated this beer."
"Not bad at all. Very refreshing. Great time of year for this."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grassy hops with some bready malt. The flavor is hoppy, but the bread/toffee malt make the beer very well balanced. There is some grassyness in the flavor from the hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice, easy drinking balanced pilsner. Nothing too exciting, but a good beer to drink the hot months."
"O: a very good beer that I could drink alot of if not for this ester+/-acetaldehyde issue. It interferes with each sniff taste. O hope that it lagers out and is not an issue from a too warm/too quick fermenation. Maybe nitpicking but for a beer that should be drunk young and fresh, I wouldn't mind a little less filtration(a little haze) for authenticity."
"O: Could have had more of the spicy hop bite I like in German/Czech pilseners. A definite step up from the macros. Nothing memorable here, but still worthy of a purchase in the upcoming months."
"This was $7.99 at HEB, to me a nice value and I will buy again when I am in the area. I am tired of $8.99 or $9.99 6 packs."
"Compared to its Texas cousin Shiner 101 Czech Pilsner, which was a bit more aggressive, this one was much more laid back. Between the German Pils of St. Arnold and Czech Pils of Shiner, I am leaning more towards Shiner. I guess I just prefer Czech Pilsners - provided Shiner and St. Arnold's made a brew true to its style. (disclaimer - I just started taste testing pilsners)"
"Pale golden in color with a serious lack of bubbles. Light corn in the aroma with a pleasing grassy hop note. The soft mouthfeel could be crispened up for refreshment purposes. A little corny in the taste with a mild bitterness. I'm not crazy about the aftertaste. All that in mind, it's not horrible and I would drink several of these outside on a hot day."
"Poured into a pilsner flute glass. Looks great. Pours with a two inch head that leaves behind a good layer of foam after it settles. The body is very light and not hazy at all. Smells very malty and slightly sweet; not much hop detection in the nose. The taste is immediately sweet and finishes with a crisp bitterness. This is a nicely flavored and light beer, but it's a touch to sweet for my liking within the style (ideally speaking of course). I would have it again though."
"EDIT: Checked the website. S.A. calls it a Boheiman Pils! Score just jumped. This beer nails the style!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and refreshing. Saint Arnold makes some of the most refreshing beers I've had (not surprising given that they're based in Houston). This isn't the best beer out there, but good for a summer BBQ."
"D: Not nearly as bad as the Fancy Lawnmower, but not all that good either. I suppose if it was ice cold you might be able to put a few of these away."
"This is a fine, refreshing pilsener that would make a great session beer for the summer."
"Overall this is pretty okay. Hops though, need more. Other than that I don't mind it. I used to look forward to this beer in my younger days but I have moved on. Makes me miss SA Imp. Pils..."
"5. This is a solid pilsner, nothing special, but well done all around."
"Won gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Try it asap."
"Pours clear golden with ample foam. No lace though, and head falls quickly leaving just a very slight collar. Fresh aroma of water crackers with cracked pepper with a Juicy Fruit gum flavor, followed by toasted malt and a crisp, moderately bitter finish. Very quaffable and tasty at the same time on an August evening. Summer Pils indeed."
"Drinkablility- Certainly could down a few of these as they go down nice and smooth, but doesn't particularly call me over other similar lighter-options."
"D: Forget water! This beer was meant for heat relief!"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin line of bubbles for a head. A nice malt and noble hop aroma. It has a very nice fresh floral, almost ""sea breeze", type aroma to it. It really complements the flavor and provides a nice segueway into the flavors when you are sipping. The taste is grain, bread, and malt with a great balance of fresh floral, peppery, earthy hops. The aftertaste is bitter from the hops and still a little sweet from the malt. A well crafted pilsner. Good mouthfeel. Carbonation is just about right and the finish is rather dry which makes you go right back for more. Great drinkability. In my opinion, this ranks up there with some of the best pilsners."
"I purchased this beer at my local H.E.B grocery store, a Texas chain. The beer's appearance was a light amber color with a tin head. The aroma held a slight citrus smell with a nice balance of hops. The taste started sweet and finished with a little bitterness. Overall it was a very enjoyable beer, great for a nice Texas evening."
"M/D - Light can crisp with excellent carbonation. Very easy drinking like a standard Pils should be. Nothing remarkable here, but another solid offering from the folks at St Arnold."
"D - I don't think I would want to drink more than a couple of these, it's not the worst beer ever just nothing special."
"Great summer beer..crisp and refreshing!"
"Tastes much more complex than it smells! The weediness is deep, veering from sweet to bitter, grassy cereal to dandelions and pollen. Slight hop finish lingers."
"The mouth is crisp with active carbonation. Easy drinker, seems well calibrated to the Houston heat."
"Poured into a pint glass a golden straw color with a bubbly white head. Smells of a wheaty straw with hop fruits. Taste has a nice bite to it. Not so much a hop bite as much of a carbonated one. Aftertaste of noble hops and fruit notes. This is a very drinkable pils. I'm not much of a fan of the Pils because of the bitterness that is usually a trate, but this is a rather smooth Pils that makes it a easy drink."
"Wow this is the lightest colored beer that I've had in a while. Pours a clear light golden/straw color with a bubbly one finger white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of grass, apples, sweet malt, a bit grainy. Taste is grainy and grassy with a hint of fruit and a slight sulfur. Finishes dry with a lingering light fruitiness. Carbonation is crisp, body is light, mouthfeel is lightly syrupy. Very light refreshing beer. Reminds me of a macro, only better. I could see myself drinking many of these on a hot summer day."
"Verdict: Saint Arnold have brewed up a great Summer seasonal for Texas. It's kind of a mix of the German and Czech Pilsener style, and the result is an tasty, highly drinkable hybrid."
"A murky gold brew with a quickly receding white head. Little to no lacing is left behind. Smells of straw, sweet malts and light fruits. Tastes a little spicy and malty, not bad at all, but could be just a little tastier. Very light bodied and sessionable just like a pils should be. While it could be a bit more interesting, I have no big complaints and could definitely get to a few of these."
"D: Highly drinkable but given the choice I would rather have the Saint Arnold Lawnmower on a hot summer day."
"Wow pours with a big pillowy head then is gone. no lacing. tons of bubbles cascade up from the bottom. smell had a sulfur smell straight out of the gate, but that dies down quickly. smell is grainy with some graham cracker there too. floral hop aroma is in the background. taste is citrusy, lemony, slight bitterness in the finish. mouthfeel is a bit sticky and coats the tongue. wish there was a bit more of a hop presence. kind of dissapointing"
"Pours an amber pale colored body, withe very little head, white in color. Has a very malty sweet aroma, kind of like a grainy domestic beery. That same malty, graininess is present in the taste also. Not a fan, but it is refreshing."
"A nice beer, but not one of St. Arnold's best."
"From a twelve ounce brown bottle - Pours a slightly cloudy pale/yellow with a ¼ inch white head. Smells of citrusy saaz hops. First sip is bitter sweet. This Pilsner is clean and refreshing. It seems to have a higher hop profile than others in its class."
"Notes- I would recomend this beer to anybody looking for a sessionable summer beer. Great for grilling, great for just having around the house. Definatly one of my favorite beers."
"D- Drinks great, with a refreshing quality found only in a pilsener. I could session this all day"
"Drinkability was decent. I'd buy another sixer of this but not if it's hard for me. If St. Arnold expands to the North, I'd definitely pick this up in the summer."
"pours a straw yellow with a bubbly white head. aromas of straw, pale malts, crisp light hops, pretty plain jane. the taste of slight sweet malts is the only thing going for this beer. crisp hops, medium bodied, nice medium carbo. a decent pils. i would buy this if there were no other better true German pils in the store."
"Tastes lightly biscuit malt with noticable hop flavor and noticable grassy hop bitter. Bitter is not quite a peppery zing. Carbonation sting is strong and detracting. Hop flavor is lemon and unripe oranges with what I envision tumbleweeds taste like. Just a touch of sour character that's hinting at acetic, but more likely arises from carbonation acid and hop bitter. Md-light body holds a dull proteinaceous bleh on the tongue after the strong carbonation burn on the papillae."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable if you are a fan of the style. Not the best in this style, but a good local summer beer."
"D- This nice soft flavors are accented, not overpowered by, sulfury lager qualities, and there is a nice complexity and dry flavor that increases a bit as the beer warms slightly. This is a well built beer."
"I would be interested to see what true pilsner fans think of this one!"
"Saint Arnold beer is tasty, but I haven't yet been blown away. Summer Pils is one of the better ones because it's a showcase for noble hops; just as a pilsener should be. It would not be surprising if this stuff flies off the shelves during the hot weather months in Texas. In other words, most of the year. Under the cap... nothing at all!"
"This beer pours a very light golden in color. Crystal clear with a slight, white head sitting atop. Smell is slightly funky, skunky and bready. Oh, and the taste only gets better. More of the skunk shows up in the taste, as well as some smoke like qualities. And it lingers on way longer than it needs to. I couldn't get this taste out of my mouth. This is a far cry from the Victory Prima Pils I had about a week ago."
"Poured a nice golden with a small white head. Carbonation was average. Yeast, barley and grains make up the nose also a small hop profile. Taste was subtle hops, smooth and the malts were good. Pretty well balanced beer."
"D: very drinkable and a very fine summer beer. not a huge fan of pilseners but this one is rather nice."
"D - This is one of the better pilsners that I have tried. Nice flavor without the grainy aftertaste of most lagers, along with an average alcohol content IMO make for a highly sessionable pilsner. Highly recommended."
"This is a tasty one for sure. Seems heavy enough to make a good pairing with dinner, but also exciting enough to have on its own. A solid and well rounded beer!"
"Pale light clear yellow colored with a sticky white head that looked like it should leave more lacing than it did. Smells of bready malts with sweet malt hints and a pretty standard pilsner hop bill of floral, grassy and spicey smells. Its pretty much as advertised in the nose with a decent ballance of noble hops and bready slightly sweet malts throughout. Its a decent finish and has a nice medium mouth feel, very drinkable. Over all this is a nice Pils, while not the best i've had certainly would never pass it up on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is relatively high as the flavors are nice and beer is quite sessionable at 4.9%. A great summer beer indeed."
"D-I could drink plenty of these. A real nice lawnmower beer."
"If this had a bit more hops in it to help it dry crisper and cleaner i could see drinking this all summer as a session, but as it stands there are many better ones out there to choose from, but worth a try if you are in the area."
"D: Is a great summer beer. Can easily enjoy a few of these to relax on a nice hot summer day. Most pilsners a to bitter for me, but this is a nice mild flavor to it."
"D - while this beer is nothing amazing, it is really, really drinkable, especially during a Houston summer! Refreshing and not too heavy. I could certainly put away a lot of these. Good work from the boys at Saint Arnold's overall IMO. Worth a shot if you're seeking out a pils or just want to go outside."
"St. Arnold Summer Pilsner is a medium- bodied brew that is intended as a refreshing beer for the warmer months. This beer is a little on the light side, but it flavors certainly make it a good choice for a warm- weather brew, with thirst quenching qualities and distinct flavors that will satisfy both beer connoisseurs and amateurs alike."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Doesn't overpower the palette, and goes down smooth."
"Picked this up as a single at my local liquor store. Poured into a pint glass. 1 finger of foam. Light yellow color. Nice noble hoppy nose. Taste is strange. A bit bitter like a pilsner but seems watered down. But the good parts of a pilsner were not kept. Bit of a corny aftertaste. I'm not a fan of this beer. Disappointing selection from Saint Arnold."
"mouthfeel is where the carbonation shone, making for a creamy pilsner that would be refreshing for a hot texas day, smooth but bitter."
"Fizzy white head...crystal clear yellow color... effervescent, constant bubbling. The bubbling made it a really beautiful beer throughout. Malty aroma...a bit ""grainy"" some pilsener spiciness...smells German. Dry malty flavor. Tingly at first and then quite quaffable. A really good drinkin' summer time beer."
"D: This is a decent micro pils, but I probably prefer others to this."
"Drinkbaility: Low. This is just too sweet with almost no hop presence."
"Despite the mediocre taste its an easy drinking beer. Its refreshing enough to satisfy a parched palate and the medium to low ABV makes it one you can sip on for hours."
"Lemonade/straw yellow with a bit of a disappointing head. Smell is strange... The noble hops are there, but a sweet, whipped cream, dessert smell hits the nose. Strange. Taste is ok. Grilled corn, hints of lemon zest, a bit of bready sweetness. The silver lining of this gray cloud is the mouthfeel. Light, wonderfully carbonated, champaign bubbles! Not a bad middle of the day beer, but my least favorite Saint Arnolds beer."
"I can quaff several at a BBQ, though nothing more than a slightly above average lager. Saint Arnold does much better."
"D - Not a bad beer, definately not my drink of choice but was one of the most flavorful I have had of the style."
"D - Pilsners aren't one of my favorite styles but this one is easy for me to drink it has a good taste its worth trying"
"Nice, simple slight yeasty smell. Good clean taste, and aftertaste, and not as yeasty as the smell. Very subtle sweetness througout. Nicely carbonated. Drinkability is good, but I prefer even less yeasty and musty pilsners such as North Coast's Scrimshaw."
"Very drinkable, a wonderful introduction to craft beer for BMC swillers."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and light. This was perfect for the humid Houston evening."
"Yet again I am amazed to find such a good brew from right here in the great state of Texas. St Arnolds has become the best brewerey in the State by a long shot. This beer, I beleive is very true to form. It pours a clear pale gold color and is very pretty to look at. The smell is good with some malty tones and hops to it. Tastes wonderful. very well balaced beer. Nice malty flavor accompanid by the nobel hops. finishes slightly dry but with a tiny bit of sweetness. I could drink this beer all night long, infact I did. This is one beer I will be taking to the beer savant Ungespundet in Munich during Oktoberfest and will let him pass judgment on it."
"d:a fellow could drink a few of these and still make it home.a good session beer.i would probably show up at a party with a six pack of these."
"Overall, a great summer beer. Highly drinkable. Toned down, of course, but some of the same taste characteristics of St. Arnold's Elissa."
"The Saint Arnold Summer Pils is on the fence - not quite German, not quite Czech. It pours the typical clear golden body and bright white head that you'd expect of a good pils. The head retention is good, and it leaves thin, streaky rings of lace at the outset of the glass. The nose delivers a bright and fresh combination of lightly sweetish grainy malt and floral, spicy and grassy hops. It's sturdy in the mouth with a medium body and fine-bubbled, gently crisp carbonation. The flavor, however, is where it really shines - although you kind of know you're in for something good at the first whiff! It's richly malty without being big. It's just clean, and fresh, and kind of straw-like, bready, and nutty. And it's almost completely infused from start to finish with spicy, floral, and grassy hops. It even has a touch of lemon; and the slightly acidic pH balances it nicely! It's stunningly rounded, like the best of the best out of Europe, and it's perfectly balanced by a flinty, smooth bitterness from beneath that I'd guess is around 30-something IBU's. It finishes pretty much just as it began, and although it does close fairly quickly, there's some very nice lingering malt and hops left over to remind you to take another sip. Very nicely done!!! A perfect pils!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with notch dating system on side of label. It was a nice clear golden yellow color. It had a small head that slowly whittled to a constant foam that was feed throughout the session by mini carb geyser. The aroma was typical pilsener and was malty with floral hops. The taste was good and went down smooth on a muggy Texas evening. However, after trying several pilseners lately I've decided I'm just not a big fan of the style. I can drink one every so often but they'll never make the rotation. However, I would recommend trying this one as a session candiate if you like the style. (3, RB-OAY, T, O)"
"Pours out a hazed pale straw with a fizzling head leaving no lacing. Smells clean, malty, mildly of grain, and with a floral hop presence. Flavor is like your typical good bready and crackery lager with a sizeable floral hoppiness and bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is crisp and spritzy. Great for a thirst quencher and definitely Saint Arnold's greatest achievement."
"I could do with a bit more flavor, but no off tastes; this is true enough to style and one of the more refreshing pilsners I've had in a while."
"Pretty neat. Id go for another."
"Love the creamy feel of this one, but the flavor is too weak to want too many more of these. There's nothing that jumps out as undrinkable, but there's nothing particularly desirable either. Average."
"D - Good drinkability. Nice shot at a German Pilsener."
"drinkability: fairly easy to drink. a good beer to have any time of year."
"Pours pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Aroma is sweet malt and floral hops. Taste is malty balanced with a nice noticeable hop biterness. Crisp and clean with a medium light mouthfeel. Carbonation is very prominant. Very drinkable, this is a great warm weather beer."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I have always sampled it in excess at the brewery, and that is only after a few other beers. This is my first of the evening, and it is a bit more aggressive than I recall. I would like this beer a lot more if it didn't have such minerally water. It still drinks easy, but I would take some other Pilsners over this one."
"This one is recommended for the summer. Refreshing with plenty of flavor. Some may find it a little sweet for a pilsner, but good nonetheless."
"The beer pours a very nice golden pilsner appearence with a good amount of head. As the beer is consumed, it leaves a very good lacing on the glass. The smell is that of a classic german pilsner with hops and hints of lemon and a tad sweet malt. Upon the first sip, I tasted mostly crips hops with some lemmon in there as well. The finish is a slightly bitter bite which rounds things out nicely. One of the best things about this brew is the mouthfeel. It is perfect, not too light, but not heavy. Very refreshing for a summer beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, goes down smooth. Nice and carbonated. Very drinkable, light ale. Excellent for a thirst-quencher, especially as it has been over 102 degrees for 3 weeks here."
"For a German style beer coming from Texas, this is not half bad. Overall, a wonderful thirst quencher."
"Medium-light body, moderately carbonated. Light, crisp, clean....pretty refreshing. Not really enough taste to bring me back for many more, though."
"Overall it seems like it could be a decent session beer. a nice one i would like with food, but not all that memorable."
"Nice beer. Pours out to a bright golden color with a small head of white foam. Some lace, and medium carbonation. Aromas of yeast and barley, nuts, some wheaty grain. Taste is very good; lightly roasted malt, smooth rich hops, touches of biscuts and yeast. Nice. Mouthfeel is zesty and refreshing, as the carbonation carries over to the palate quite well. Good Drinkability. Special thanks to assurbanipaul for the sample."
"money out of the macro's pockets."
"Pours a brilliantly clear gold color and is topped by a frothy, almost white head. The aroma is spicy with grassy-herbal hop notes plus an underlying note of sweet grain. The taste is lightly sweet up front with a immediate hop character that flows through to the finish of this beer. The hop notes taste like a mix of lemon, herbs of various sorts, and a bit of grassy astringency too. This beer is quite light, and seems to be either missing the body/maltiness (for a Czech Pils), or the dry flintiness (of a German Pils) that would make this beer great. It is a little too sweet and thin, but is nice and quenching and certainly an easy quaffer."
"Note: Bang for the buck,... some macros might could compete with this. Very cool label though!"
"Fair beer, nothing too interesting, but a decent refresher in the summer."
"Overall impression: Very nice summer seasonal - I could easily drink a bunch of these on a warm day."
"A very nice beer. One that I would recommend for a student of the style. One of the few non-Belgium yellow beers that I have liked in a while."
"On-tap at the brewery tour, again. Appearance is a golden color with average carbonation and head. Aroma is of light malts and saaz hops. The taste has a moderate malt flavor with saaz hops bite. Very grainy, but flavorful. I like this beer as a Summer quencher with good flavor, but this isn't the greatest. Still, it is always great to support local brews."
"This is a good beer during pleasant spring weather, I bet it would be even better in the blazing summer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light gold color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is light on the nose, but has some malty and grassy characters, typical pilsener. The taste is typical pils as well. A good malt background with a snappy grassy hop finish. The mouthfeel is a little light and watery. The drinkability is great though. A decent very drinkable pils."
"Overall: Not my choice as far as the style goes but maybe a good introductory beer if you are trying to convert someone from the macro-world."
"Drinkability - rather delicious, my supply is sure to be short-lived."
"Thanks to Assurbanipaul for the this refreshing pils."
"Overall, not a bad beer to drink when the temperature rises. It's no Pilsener Urquell, but it's a pretty decent offering from Saint Arnold."
"Mouthfeel is light with a dry aftertaste. Refreshing, easy to drink. Not a bad effort but a little too restrained for a good pils."
"Overall Impression: A light, crisp, refreshing beer. Perfect for a hot summer day. I would have trouble with it as a session, but would understand others that would choose it. Worth a try!"
"Drinkability/notes: An interesting beer, a bit different from a typical Pilsener, but quite pleasant and a good choice for summer."
"The smell is quite nutty with some underlying sweetness. The front is nutty with a little fruit. Apples, if I'm sane. The malt really starts to show in the sweet middle. Just a little sick. The finish is bitter and fresh, grassy with some alcohol. And still nutty. This is a decent, fresh summer beer, but the alcohol and sweetness make it a little sickly."
"Like I said, I think this is probably Saint Arnolds best offering and one I eagerly await each year. Its not as elegant or complex as its European stylistic predecessors, but what it lacks in subtle complexity it makes up for in sheer drinkability."
"Pours golden amber in color with a thick and creamy white head that coats the sides of the glass with spider webs as it fades into a heavy lace. Nose is sweet malts and fruits with some notes of creamy bananas. Light in body with a soft carbonation. Taste also has a lot of sweet malt flavor with some additional notes of dried grass and a bit of peppery hops towards the end to help balance the sweetness. A nice summer brew thats great on a hot Texas summer day."
