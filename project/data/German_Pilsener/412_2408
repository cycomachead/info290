4.68,30.7,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Yes, it is a CAN as it is not pressurized and pours via gravity. I would get a quick finger of soapy, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a button-bright golden-yellow (SRM = 4 to 5) and Midas, Croesus and Mammon suddenly crashed our party, desirous of a sip. It smelled great, like strong honey underlain by a pleasant grassiness. It was most definitely a German Pilsner! Czech Pilsners would be the opposite - grassy underlain by honey. My mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was kind of light and thin, but that is to be expected in the style. The taste was very honey-like and I was reminded of the air freshener in my Ex-Old Lady's car. She is an apiarist and keeps honeycombs in the back of her vehicle, giving it a really honeyed scent. It was on the finish that I again tasted Noble (grassy) hops, giving the beer as semi-sweetness. This was a great example of the style, plus I got to turn some other people on to it as a result of its medium. You CAN believe that I am going to be looking into procuring more mini-kegs in the future!","woodychandler","Dec 17, 2013"
3.66,2.2,4.25,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"The flavor comes together just as my head was casting doubt based on the aroma. Tastes a little clean with grassy, woody, and raw grain flavors. It has a soft body with gentle crispness and even a touch of creaminess. True, another German pilsner, but it's certainly better than the Warsteiner's of the world.","DoubleJ","Dec 03, 2013"

Aroma includes a light hoppy note, some pilsner malt, maybe some lemon peel. Taste is light, refreshing, mild bitterness, slight sweetness on the back end.

2.68,-25.1,4,3.5,2,3,2.5,"If this "EKU" pils is the c lassic German pilsner, then what's the deal with Kulmbacher's Edelherb? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises honey-dripped biscuit, light grass, and a kiss of flower petal. The taste holds notes of old biscuit, dank greens, iceberg lettuce, and a general sense that the world just isn't quite right, that the Matrix may, in fact, be real, and it's having a hard time coding the flavor of beer. Man, this stuff just jumped off a cliff and destroyed itself upon the rocks at the base (but the eyes are still open and trying to process the horror it just experienced). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, this is the second time I've had this beer, and both times have been incredibly disappointing. And I made sure this stuff was pretty fresh, too, so it's not like I've been sitting on a bottle for years or anything. I've just gotta say it: This is a fairly crappy pils. *sigh*","TMoney2591","Oct 22, 2012"

After the skunk came your wet straw, some citrus, and then a bit of sunflower as the beer settled. The taste underwent some changes too. At first the hoppiness came through more so than when the beer finally settled. This is a slightly watery, light bodied, medium carbonation beer with not much going on one way or the other.

Flavor was also more malty-sweet and bready than hoppy. The hops shone through at the finish, leaving a brisk dryness to offset the full, malty body, as they should.

2.73,-23.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"EKU Pils just can't be recommended, there's too much unsupported bitterness. This beer is only for those who love the style and maybe not even for them. Best avoided.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 05, 2004"
4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours out to a brilliantly clear straw golden, forming a rocky bone-white head with very good retention and excellent clumps of lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma of traditional pils...freshly mown hay, husky and dry delicate pale malts, noble hops, freshly fermented. Fresh with minimal skunk. Taste is exact echo of the aroma. Delicate malt body with medium-firm bitterness. Mouthfeel is bright initially but softens throughout and ends with a lightly dry finish. Light bodied. Cleanly fermented with no off-flavors. Alcohol is imperceptable. Up there with other very good pils. Reminds me of Steinlager. Good refreshing brew. Recommended as far as pilseners go.","Mitchster","Jul 08, 2004"
3.95,10.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Taste was very nutty and almost buttery. A slight hops bitterness comes through but was not overpowering. Finish is somewhat thin. Smooth as opposed to "crisp" like other pilsners I've had, but this was enjoyable nevertheless.","Denali","Beers"

It had a slight perfumey aroma which intrigued, but when I tried to follow it up when drinking, well, it was missing. My notes say: not much taste. The mouthfeel was good, low-medium, with a nice soft crispness. It was just...not a lot of taste at all. Would try to have again, see if I get a serving with some taste next time ;-)","PatandDavid","May 25, 2004"
3.83,7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I felt this was one of the more highly hopped pilsners I've had in the past. Still, the grassy malt seemed to be the prevalent flavor here. I've been drinking this for a day or so now and it's proving to be a worthy session beer.","Boilermaker88","May 20, 2004"
3.4,-5,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"An average pilsner from the EKU people. On the hoppy side of pilsners, and hopefully the keg can's a bit old so that this one will be even better next time.

The taste is average. It has a crisp, bitter flavor with a dry, yet weak finish. It has no malt character, but does reveal some bitter hops. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a boat load of carbonation. This is a hard drinker. I don't care for the taste at all. It has a nasty stale aftertaste. It's one and done for me.","WesWes","Mar 04, 2004"

4.1,14.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a clean white head settling over clear light golden-yellowish liquid. The nose is soft and light maltiness with a pinch of delicate flowery hoppiness. The taste is a tad salty at first, then a clean sparse malt flavor shows up followed by quite adequate (read: nice and bitter!) hoppiness, nicely balanced! Finishes light, dry and extremely drinkable, makes for one great hot weather session lager.","beerluvr","Dec 11, 2003"
4.14,15.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Absolutely transparent bright gold color, white marginal head with some sticky large bubbles. Downward falling string lacing. Good aroma, grape skins, hop, some honey laden with pollen. Malt is straightforward but ample, lightly sweet and maple in impression. Nice carbonation, sprightly but not overdone. The hops shine, peppery and crisp and excellent in the attenuation department. Nutty bittering in the aftertaste as well, good finish. This is one of the hoppier Pilsners I've had -- if it would keep I'd stock it for those occasions when you want a crisply bitter drinkable beer without the giant North American hop characteristics.","ADR","Dec 07, 2003"
2.93,-18.2,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Bright white head held out for a minute and then faded to a film, leaving a ring of lace as it went. Clear, light gold colored beer. Smells like a crisp and fresh beer. Almost no flavor, like a light macro. I can't pick out a damn thing in the taste, although it is pleasant. Not much in the taste department, but atleast it's clean. Light body, but not watery.","HappyHourHero","Nov 17, 2003"
3.43,-4.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Appearance: Crystal clear straw tinted golden witha nice bubbly white head leaves very nice webbed lacing in full patches. Aroma: Some lemongrass sweetness, grainy, with Hallertau hops present to balance the sweetness a very nice crisply balanced brew so far. Taste: Pleasantly hoppy distinct European hops with a biscuit malt character, much more flavor than I was expecting simple but very tasty. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body with a very smooth natural carbonation everything an American light lager will never accomplish. Drinkability: Very refreshing and easy to consume, definitely a session brew meant to be drank a few at a sitting.","WVbeergeek","Nov 17, 2003"
3.65,2,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours a translucent golden hue with a large foamy head that quickly dissipates. An astringent aroma with a hint of citrus and hop essence. Tastes like a standard pilsner at first, but the aftertaste is really something. Dry, lightly tart, lemony, faintly hoppy, just overall very busy. I liked this from the first sip and it's growing on me even more. Damn, I wish I'd bought more than one.","ElGordo","Nov 16, 2003"
4.2,17.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Fascinating finish. Leaves a very noticeable immediate hop bitterness, but you can suck the aftertaste out of the crevaces in your mouth for minutes and minutes after you're done with this beer to a puckering, bitter end...or is it the end?","marburg","Nov 10, 2003"
4.47,24.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tasted blind again on 6.11.04 with Czechvar and Urquell. Stylistically, EKU is identical to Czechvar only more lively.

3.38,-5.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I had this on tap at a German Bierstube in Moscow. It came out (in a Helles glass) clear gold with a 2.5 finger contoured head that stuck around a while and left very nice lace most of the way down the glass. The nose was very mild, almost imperceptible. The mouth was prickly and light. My tastebuds were pleased by the nice balance between the malty start and the hoppy finish. The aftertaste is crisp bitter, with an amazing extra hoppy kick in the car 15 minutes after I finished the glass. This is a good session beer and a fine example of the style, albeit on the mild side.","Globetrotter","Oct 09, 2003"
3.21,-10.3,2.5,4,3,3,3,"Very light and pale golden. Looks more like grape juice than a pilsner. Clarity is fine. Small bubbly white head leaves sparse lace. Nice pils maltiness on the nose spattered with floral and spicy hop notes. Soft malt tones mix with some bitter hoppiness and peppery spice notes. All in all, this combo of flavors strikes me as pretty average. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated.Body about medium. Not too bad. Not too good.","Bighuge","Jul 14, 2003"

4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This pils poured a clear golden color with white foam that left lace. The carbonation action was good. The smell was malt and biscuit - a nice persistent aroma. The taste was malty and biscuity with some floral hops and mild bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp and relatively clean. The body and carbonation feel were medium. This was a good german pils.","UncleJimbo","May 28, 2003"
4.1,14.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a big, crisp, white head on a crystal yellow base. Aroma is immediately of spicy hoppiness. Initial flavor is milder than expected from the spicy aroma -- is pretty light in body with some decent malt body. A generous (for the style) hop bitterness is clearly evident, unlike in its descendant american pilsners, finishing with just a touch of spicy flavor. Extremely refreshing and light, and easy to gulp, while still holding a lot of interesting flavor.","Stopper","May 15, 2003"

3.6,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Crystal clear light gold body topped by a white head. The head was moderate and short-lived, leaving a thin layer of white that left small deposits of lace. This beer has a definite oily look to it, like a heaviness. The longneck brown bottle used for this beer could not be responsible for the light skunkiness of the smell when the bottle was opened, so it must be that the hopping is what is sensed here. The nose is mostly of grassy notes and hay. The flavor pattern is mostly from the hops - fairly bitter and somewhat floral. An interesting Pils flavor to be sure. The feel is moderate with strong crispness in the finish. Long, biting aftertaste.","AtLagerHeads","0"
3.38,-5.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"EKU Pils: I was thinking that this was the big time octane EKU, but thankfully it was not (as I had to drive). Golden color that is typical of the style, with a nice white head that was extremely long lasting, with terrific lacing. Clean light aroma, but with a little skunk. The skunk in the nose also shows up in the taste, but it is not overwhelming. Light malting, and a decent kick of hops lingers toward the end. Nice, light bodied and flavorful.","jackndan","Apr 11, 2003"
