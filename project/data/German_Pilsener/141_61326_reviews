"Pours straw colored and with a slight haze. White foam to crown this beer that lasts and hugs the glass to the very end.  Nose is soft pils malt,  with a a cheeky little peppery herbal from hops.  Some spice to tickle the nose.  Taste is vibrant. That soft and graceful malt rolls over the palate  with a light touch of fine golden sweetness.  The hops are leafy and herbal, peppery and lean onto the palate only whimsically with a very slight bitterness to take you in to a clean and dry finish.  Pils malt is a wry touch breaddy at the swallow and this beer was VUNDERBAR!"

"Some people love Smuttynose but I have yet to drink a quality beer from them. This toasts like a water down MHL with a bit of a Halloween type aroma."

"O: very drinkable Pilsner. Nothing super special, but it does a nice job. Would have it again."

"Nice light behind citrus flavor.  Pours easy,  goes down easy."
"Overall: Light, crisp, balanced and refreshing."

"08/01/13 On tap At Rattle N Hum, NYC. Bready/biscuity hits you in the face as you approach this brew. Merges w/citrus over the tongue but leaves as a guest one would invite back. Dry finish can't be ignored yet doesn't overwhelm. The Smutty crew allude to the old world. I'm not one to qualify that, but will say this can stand on it's own."

"The palate opens crisp and clean with a blend of pleasant lemony Saaz bitterness, earthy hops and a mild doughy sweetness. Despite the pronounced hop character, it is lacking in that snap that the best German pilsners have. A very faint butterscotch character is present on the mid palate. Drying on the finish with a blend of lemony bitterness, earthy, woodsy hop flavor and a sweet dough flavor, this beer is crisply carbonated and quite excellent on the palate.  Excellent stuff."
"Was looking for a refreshing beer. This did it! Without losing flavor too!"
""
"The light citrus flavor compounded with the bitterness of the hops are overall reminiscent of grapefruit. Very simple; very refreshing."

"Good pils,"

"Good pilsner."
"O: 3.75 - Good beer, though the noble hop taste is what I look for most in German pils. This is good, but it's not going to become one of my go-to pilses."

"Pretty solid pilsner. Could be a tad hoppier for my liking, but its certainly within style. Definitely got some ""real"" malt flavor, vs the cheap macro lagers. Its nothing mind blowing, but its what you'd expect from Smutty."

"O - nice, easy drinking American brewed German Pilsener."

"O: This pilsner was promising to start, but went completely downhill really fast. As far as German pilsners go, this one is seriously lacking in depth and complexity. Smuttynose can do far better and so can fans of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: maybe a bad bottle or maybe just bad beer."
""
"It's taken me long enough, but I've finally gotten around to trying out this semi-heralded pils. It pours a clear straw topped by a short finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises strong grass, greens, mild biscuit, and a touch of what may or may not be wintergreen way in the distance. The taste brings in more of the same, noble-style hops really taking the fore without overdoing things. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a straightforwardly crisp finish. Overall, a nice pils, nothing special, but something I could easily drink again."
""
""
""
""
"I'll revisit this one again if I can find a fresh one. Nice pilsner none the less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delightfully flavorful representation of a pilsner that pours slightly cloudy. The nose permeates the senses with noble hops and a slight bit of maltiness. The herbaceous minty hops sweep though the palate coating the inside of my mouth while an almost unlikely sweetness subdues the initial impact of the hops. This sweetness dissipates and gives way to a pleasantly dry finish."

"Pale straw, clear with visible rising carbonation bubbles. Head, large at first, fades rather quickly. Aroma is zesty, bright and crisp. Clean cracker malt with lemon. Taste matches with lemon pepper and fresh grainy malt. A well done pils that I'm sure I'll return to again and again."
"12oz bottle in a pilsner glass. It may not be made with Bohemian water but this is a darn good pilsner. This pours a nice straw golden with appropriate carbonation. Smell is slightly breadlike. Taste is crisp, clean, appropriately bitter, and with just the appropriate hint of earthy flavor. I really like this, hopefully to the approval of my many German and German-American ancestors."
""
"A good pils overall (if somewhat plain-jane). I had my first glass at the same brewpub several days earlier and, if I recall, I was more overly impressed with the flavor than this glassful, but this is the sample I took notes on. It's still an enjoyable and easy drinking lager."

"O - Easy to drink, light and refreshing. A good Pilsner worthy of a try."
"Returned to taste off Full Sail & other pilsners and it won in my book - 10-17-14."
"This is a great warm weather refresher but not much to style."
""
""
""
"Nice looking beer. Nose is very bready, yeasty, and somewhat sweet. Crisp tangy flavor. Full and consistent. Very German in execution. It's going quite nicely with my sausages that I'm having for lunch. Another good one from Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
"The taste and feel are deeply intertwined as a crisp clean refreshing taste ends in a similar feel. Cereal maltiness compliment a bready grain and end in more hops than in typical Pilsners. Very easy on the throat the carbonation is easily visible but barely noticeable. This is a light airy version of a Pilsner and a very good one at that."
""
""
""
"Best by 11/13/13.Poured into a pilsner dulled lemon tinged lighter golden with a sticky half finger white head atop,a decent amount of broken lace left behind as it settled.I get a whiff of floral and herbal hops right up front with a tinge of iron and bread dough,northern German hopped up pilsner is what Iam thinking.Pretty dry and crisp on the palate with a mineral tinge,leafy and floral hop profile,and a firm bready base although not over done in the doughy department.A clean hoppy pils but with real flavor,it's gonna go good with the sausage and sauerkraut in the slow cooker."
""
""
"Very drinkable beer. Though atypical of the style, the lemony note is refreshing and a nice complement to the graininess and bitter hops."
""
"Though the pilsner is nearly ideal, it suffers the same fate as olympic divers who choose less complex routines. Even if they score perfectly, they top-out with only a portion of the available points. This lager's simplified palate is as much to its determent as it is an asset."
""
""
"Vunderbar pours a clear white-yellow with a small head. The aroma and taste are both big on bready malts and noble Saaz hops. It's a very simple and tasty pilsner that doesn't offer up much more than slightly breadier than normal malts and zesty Saaz hops. It's tasty and refreshing."
""
""
""
"This isn't bad, but it's almost boring for a style that alot of people find boring to begin with. I personally love a good pilsener, and I can appreciate this one, but it didn't truly grab my attention. It's just okay."
""
"o: Excellent pilsener! Just right for what will probably be the hottest day of the year where I hang out. 98 today."
""
""
"overall a very solid pils that's perfect on a hot day."
"12 oz bottle poured into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy greenish yellow with a nice white head. Smells of light grain, not much else, but not too surprising for a pilsner. Tastes of sweet grain, but definitely not aided by adjuncts. Crisp and clean taste. Beer is light bodied, good carbonation, overall a very good beer."
"This beer embodies everything I love about pilsners."
""
""
"Slightly nutty, toasted grain bite up front. Bready, biscuity malts fill in. Touch of honey sweetness. Snappy, peppery, moderately bitter hops back it all up. Dry finish, with lingering sweetish bread malts and grassy, herbal hop bitterness. Moderate body with a lively, refreshing feel. A great addition to the summer beer lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is quite refreshing but all in all is quite boring."
""
""
""

"O: A solid pilsner. Hops could be more pronounced, but otherwise there's little to complain about other than the lack of uniqueness - which isn't a big deal, either."
""
""
""
""
"(Full Disclosure: The ""Best Buy"" date on the bottle I had was about 6 weeks past, so given the general fragility of pilsners, I suppose that could be the problem. Still ...)"
""
""
""
"A well made Pilsener produced right here in New England. Balanced, refreshing and contains all of the elements you would expect in this style. I remember liking it at the brewery, well done."
""
""
"Yellow in color but fairly hazy for a pilsner. Small head that clings to the edges of the glass but leaves no lacing behind. Floral hop aroma with strong biscuit malt overtones. Good carbonation but still a little soft for the style and a very dry finish. I am a pilsner fan but something about this one just misses the mark. Perhaps it's not as crisp as I like them to be."
""
""
""
""
""
" It's a quite addictive beer. The dry finish and good hops makes this a really good beer. Unfortunately, I had a bottle that was too old. However, it still stood out as one of the best America made pilsners I have had. I would love to get this fresh with more hops."
"O: A crisp, hop focused, bitter beer that is slightly unbalanced but to be fair the brew suggested an enjoy by date about six weeks back. It's still a pretty decent beer but I can imagine this is a very good beer when it's fresh and I'll keep an eye out for next years release. I greatly appreciate a brewer that will put an bottle on or enjoy by date; when you're getting a hoppy beer you want to know that sort of thing."
""
""
"Overall I am not sure how old this is but it tastes great. Nice short batch series I wish I could find more."
""
""
"O-A decent pilsner, still not a style I enjoy but this is a better one."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a pilsner guy (putting it mildly), but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Has a somewhat unique flavor that finishes with (and bear with me) a walnut-like taste. Smell and mouthfeel pretty uninspiring, but other than that, I dig it. Probably be a good session beer."
"O-a decent pilsener but not outstanding"
"I only bought one of these but I could have easily downed all of a 4-pack in a session had I bought them. It's not often that a beer catches me by surprise or that something this light in hue and taste can match up with darker beers that are higher-rated on here, but this could certainly fit that bill. No doubt that this is a winner from Smuttynose and about a good a session beer that's on the shelf right now, to the point that I wish I had another here at home to crack open."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best before 3/17/2013 indicated on the bottle. Pours a bright, translucent yellow with a fluffy, two inch bright white head and copious tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap with small, textured clusters of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses a clean grassy character as well as a trace of bright citrus in the background and a suggestion of noble hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, citrus is a little more forward in the flavor profile and there's a bit more of a malt presence in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight acidity and a lively carbonation. Overall, a nice representation of the style and definitely a beer that I would purchase on a regular basis if it was added as a summer seasonal. That said, If the flavor was a little cleaner and crisper this beer would really excel for the style. Another great beer from Smutty."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid lighter beer to session with for a long time."
"Overall: a quite refreshing and quaffable Pilsner. Maybe not 100% stylistically accurate, but quite tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a bit dry, lacks that distinct grainy and czech hop character, some bitterness but the proof is in the malting and this misses out per style."
""
""
"A bitter and zesty lemon punch up front backed by a smooth biscuity middle. Ends on a bitter herb note with a clean dry finish. This is an excellent pilsner."
"More sweet than crisp, but still a nice mouthfeel. I would drink more of these."
""
""
"D- very drinkable and wonderfully crafted."
""
"Pours a three finger thick, pure white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy straw color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grassy nose and flavor is malty sweetness and lemon with hints of bitterness at finish. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Glen Beverage Glen, NH."
"O/D-Pretty good, but I am struggling to see why this is in a four pack. It's a pretty standard Pils. Just pack it up like a normal sixer. Anyway, it's pretty enjoyable, but I struggle to find anything truly memorable about this beer. Its very solid, but also unspectacular."
"Taste starts out with a grainy front with a grassy bitter finish, carbonation is very sharp and refreshing, almost thirst quenching and a clean finish."
"O: Good stuff. An easy drinking, yet flavorful, pilsner. I could quaff down a few of these on a hot day and be happy."
""
"O: A nice pils that is very easy to drink as well as being flavorful. It would be very easy to drink the 4-pack in a sitting. If you're not so into lagers and are questioning whether or not this is worth picking up, I say give it a shot. There aren't too many lager characteristics that really make themselves known, including the yeast which is nice"
""
"Overall a tasty and quaffable pils."
""
""
"Overall a real great mix of lingering bitterness and sweetness on the swallow too, with a sweet bread finish. Great tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing and easy to drink on a hot summer day - easily sessionable and quite enjoyable."
"Overall it started nice but went down hill quickly. Too watery, lacking carbonation and more of the toasty pilsner malts, and hops don't suit it well. The bottle is a far cry from the draft version I had a couple years ago, either the bottling didn't help the beer at all, or the recipe changed... or possibly they got too big too fast and couldn't handle the more subtle beers... I'll have to try a few more from them to see how their other beers are doing."
"O: This beer makes for a good aperitif or a drink to pair with a meal. It’s rather drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty and an easy quaff. Can't ask for much more on a hot summer day. The sharp hop bitterness adds some acidity that, when taken in tandem with the crisp carbonation, make this beer even more thirst-quenching and drinkable."
""
"O - a fine example of the style."
""
"Light and easy drinking, hints of rye and lime. Dangerously sessionable. Clean and straight forward. Decent pilsner."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a straw yellow with a half inch of white head, that leaves some lace. Smell is grass, lemon, biscuit, and grains of Paradise. Taste is very much that, balanced wonderfully, nothing really dominant. Body is medium thin, great amount of life, not too dry, and easy drinking. This is a excellent pilsner, could hammer the 4 pack really fast on a hot day."
"Great looking beer when poured. Light straw color with just a touch of haze. Good head that's in it for the long haul. The smell is a pleasant mix of light malt, spicy hops and that lager yeast that is so refreshing in the heat. The hops are up front in flavor, but not strong, just present. This fades into the light malt and lager yeast notes. Crisp and refreshing!"
"Overall, not a replacement for the German imports, but a decent enough beer."
"From the bottle stamped with an expiration date of 11/14/12. Sampled on June 14, 2012. The pour is pale yellow and slightly murky with an excitable carbonation that turns to a ring and sticks around. When I check out the aroma I really get that traditional German bready malt characteristic with a vague hop note on the backside. The body is mostly light with a keen creamy sensation. The taste is also rather malty but with a vague citrus twist and a soft but bitter hop finale. It works well on a hot day."
""
""
""
"Mildly fruity, particularly in the swallow. Light hop throughout. Decent body and carbonation. Good example of a German Pils."
"Nice light body with good carbonation. Overall this one is real good. I'll be sure to grab some four packs of this often."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a light and slightly cloudy straw color with a smallish bone white head that shows some great determination. Smells of sweet malts and lots of spicy earthy hops. Hints of honey and sweet malts with a bit of a lemony tartness. Taste follows the smell fairly well. Lots of earthy floral hops piled on top of a mild sweet malty base. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet almost tart mouthfeel. Nice pilsener I really enjoyed this. Light refreshing and a bit hoppy."
""
"Poured as part of a barrel tasting event, the beer is in a tulip. Bright, hazy honey gold color with a tall, frothy, light, white head. Clean aromas, with hints of butter and biscuit, and a light floral essence, also. Flavors are bold on an extremely light, almost sharp body. Toasted grains, butter rich, and a kiss of orange zest. Very tasty and bold. The aftertaste showcases the subtle, dry, and tangy hops. Quick and amazingly clean finish. Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is deeply golden. The head was about one finger but stayed longer than expected. Crisp refreshing nose with a bit of floral hop aroma and some warmth from hoppy spice notes. Very refreshing taste on this one. Cool and not very aggressive. It is definitely sessionable. Rather thin feel. Needs more carbonation, but could be from the growler being a day old. Good beer for lounging out in the sun."
"I doubt I'll give up on German or local pils for this beer any time soon, but this is a decent, easy to appreciate beer from Smuttynose."
"The highlight of this beer is the mouthfeel. It's plush, silky and luxurious. I'm guessing this was decocted with love."
"Sampled on-tap at the Cloverleaf tavern. I wasn't too impressed with this German depiction. Spritzy, light, with a dash of lemon and honey zest but overall nothing to brag about. A good warm-weather, Summertime beer to say the least; otherwise not one of Smuttyose's best depictions."
"Pours a light golden yellow, almost see through. Bright white one-finger head. Aroma of grass, light toasted grain. Very light, crisp, compact flavor. Light sweet grass flavor. Toasty grains, yeast and sweet pale malt. Hint of spice, but like the general flavor, nothing overpowering or dominating. Very cohesive, drinkable, crisp and dry."
"It's light-bodied and eminently drinkable lager. As for drinkability, it's amazing. Smooth, crisp, easy to drink. I wish Smutty would release Vunderbahr as a regular release as this it would be a great, gateway craft beer for non-beer geeks."
"I love lagers I wish my local breweries' did more. The subtle sweet bready malts along with the delicate grassy hops are delightful. I think the clean and crisp aspect of the brew make this an awesome drinking brew. The slightly drying hop finish completes it. This brew would be way to easy to drink mass quantities of. I hope to see more of this next year."
"Move over Prima Pils. Smuttynose has crafted a worthy contender to thy throne!"
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a light golden yellow with a one finger fluffy pure white head. Maintained phenomanol lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit (bananas mostly), and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, bananas, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mid carbonation. Overall this one wasn't that bad, nor was it that great. This one did have some nice flavors going on, but they were just too bundled together and didn't stand out on their own. This one is worth trying at least once, but that would be about it (for me at least)."
"Overall, an extremely crisp and refreshing beer that really is perfect for a warm summner day. Easily accessible yet complex. Definitely worth seeking out."
