"It's crisp, with a lingering skunky-ness, and alcohol after-taste. It leaves a thin head, with minor lacing. It does however taste clean, the sharpness of the hops shines through, as well as a little malty-ness. For a pilsner, it is very good."
""
"Not sure if an exceptional batch, but I found this beer delightful for the style without the skunking that others have noted."
"O: flavor was disappointing;"
"my, how my taste buds have changed...."

"It´s a good beer, maybe one of my favorite pilsners. It smells dull but has a lot of flavour, It´s also very cheap here in Mexico."

"A pretty mediocre beer for Germany"
"A fine, fresh example of a German pilsner, a beer I would down a sixer of on a hot summer day."
"A very enjoyable light tasting german pilsner. Not heavy at all. A great afternoon or evening brew when you are being involved with athletic activities on the weekend and don't want to be weighed down with a heavy german lager. (Leisure athletic activities with friends of course, bocce, horseshoes, etc ). Goes with most BBQ foods like an North American pilsner would, U.S. or mexican. Just wish they could market it at a lower cost in the U.S. of A. So I could share the love."

"Light and smooth.  Small amount of hops, but a bit of a bitter finish."

"Pours very light yellow with an average amount of head, doesn't stick around for all that long though. No distinct aroma from it, smooth to drink, slight bitterness on the finish."

"Crystal clear light golden color with a good sized moderate lasting frothy white head. Loads of DMS when this was first cracked then the skunk seemed to slowly crawl away. Sweet bready pils with a hint of ash and aluminum foil. Light floral hop aromas as well as hints of light pomme fruit. The flavor is light bready pils, earthy spicy hop, a bit of sulfur and metal with some sweet fruit. Uhm yeah, I'm not going to finish this bottle."
"Lemmon honey grass not a bad drop"
"The second best pilsner in the world."
""
"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 2A). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L507.04.2014. AROMA: grainy aroma. no hop aromas. APPEARANCE: very pale straw color and translucent. average white head with low retention. TASTE: slight grainy sweet flavour with medium-low bitterness that lingers into a semi-dry finish. no hop flavours. PALATE: light body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a bulk german pilsener that lacks noble hops presence."

"330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 4/26/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good clean balance of pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice clean balance and solid robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a nice German pilsener style. All around clean balance and solid robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"DATE TASTED: November 22, 2014... GLASSWARE: Warsteiner pokal... OCCASION: Cavs STILL trying to figure ""it"" out... APPEARANCE: sallow yellow, mostly clear body with large, consistent bubbles; three-finger sudsy head settles to a chunky consistency; lacing is sparse and filmy... AROMA: lightly aromatic, almost flowery at first; secondary malts are subtler like warm toast... PALATE: reasonably stable backbone, with some fizzle in the throat--a bit dry, oily and elusive....TASTE: a rather fruity pilsner, with some lemongrass and toast mixed in; an unassuming, apologetically soft rinser... OVERALL: a good prelude for nachos and salsa, but the initial experience is shallow, aftertaste is slight, and the rest is generally ho-hum example of the genre ..."

"Hard to properly rate the look considering I'm drinking it at a dark bar, however, from what I can see it is a very pale straw color. I detect a nice hop aroma at first, however, as the thin white lace subsides and I get further along in the drink its a mostly malty aroma. Taste and feel are very clean, malty, bready but very little hops bite or bitterness. Low carbonation. Has neither the spicy quality or the hops kick of other continental pilsners I enjoy. An uncomplicated, very clean and smooth pilsner but ultimately a bit bland for my tastes."
""
"Pours with a very small white head. Is golden in color. Has aromas of hops and malts that create a sweet, floral scent. The hops give it a sweet citrus taste and has a slightly bitter finish. Goes down incredibly smooth"
""
""
""
"Grainy pils malts on the nose with light spice and a hint of earthiness. Presents a very clean and crisp palate with light grain flavors leading to a crisp, spicy, clean hop finish. Light and dry."

"The Budweiser of Germany.."

"Northern German Pilsener that is typical but not great. Industrial Lager. Not too bad but also nothing interesting"

"O: Excellent beer which is inherently drinkable yet provides plenty of crackery maltiness, grasy hops bitterness, and the classic exquisitely dry finish. Comes off drier than Prima Pils but less hoppy - both are great."
"05/22/12 Not a fav. I found a bit of a piney aftertaste. I prefer a cleaner mouth-feel & beyond."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This did have balance, but it was too skunky. Drain pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a guy who thinks all pilseners taste the same, I actually kinda enjoyed this one.  The skunkiness was just enough to make it interesting.  If you're into pilseners, you'll like this one well enough.  I'll be going back to my ales, stouts, and porters."
""
""
""
"Nice color, clear slightly golden yellow.  Pours a 2 finger head and keeps a thin cap.  Very smooth and easy drinking, with a present but light hop bitterness.  Slight skunkiness.  Overall it is an alright beer that I would drink again (and have had before), but not seek out to buy.  A 3.5 for a little better than okay."
""
""
""
""
"Overall enjoyable beer. I first had this during a trip to Germany many moons ago. The Germans don't serve it quite as cold as I like my beer, but it still holds up even at 42 degrees without tasting skunky."

"After reading all the bragging on the can about the beer, I had to try. I was happy with the beer but not elated. A decent pilsener, small head that went away very fast. Good carbonation and a bitterness that was alright, but lingered a little too long. A nice effort, wouldn't turn away another one"

"But when you do drink it you'll be left wondering whether they were drunk or just in bad (wicked) faith when they called it a good beer, not to mention the ""best"" beer in Germany."

"My local store had a 15% off sale on individual bottles and I like to try new beers when possible. This one pours a clear light golden color with a small head that quickly fades. As for the taste, it wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. The beer was rather bland. It's not the worst Ive had, but I don't think I'd buy it again. At least I didn't pay full price!"
""
""
""
"I live on the east coast in the U.S. and I found a 4 can pack of this beer for 5 bucks and thought the price was wrong as it's imported beer which is usually way more expensive in my area. For some reason I can only keep down imported beer. I thought it was going to taste bad since it was so cheap...but I was surprised that it was quite pleasant tasting. My favorite beer is Stella ...and Sapporo (Japanese beer). This one rates somewhere in the middle, being very refreshing and has a kick to it that says... you are drinking beer!! not flavored water :-). I recommend drinking it very cold. It's great with comfort and fast foods and I will be looking for it again...I hope the price remains this low, as it will be my regular basic go to beer. Way way better than any U.S. beer I have tasted. Cheers!!"

"Thin, yellow, no head to speak of. But this beer has a little more hoppiness and flavor than your average pilsner. I like the dry finish and the hop element. Also like that this is more full-bodied than other pilsners. But at the end of the day, it's still a pilsner, but you could do worse (or better--like, IMHO, Coney Island Mermaid Pilsner). I found this beer drinkable but not particularly enjoyable--I prefer something with more flavor and/or complexity."
"Found these cheap, 4.99 for four pints. If I can keep getting it at this price, this will be my go to beer. I drank this through a keg and didn't enjoy it as much as I do now. I would compare this to Konig pilsner, although Konig is much better, this is trying to keep pace. Nice cool refreshing beer. Smell some vanilla, grass, almost candy like. Beer changes in smell as it warms for the better. More of a hop odor to it.Very nice carbonation and straw like color. Lacing in the glass is prevalent and stays. Head created was thick and soapy. Great beer, great price, go for it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid german pilsner top to bottom. The taste is a bit of a different animal then I expected from the aroma but doesn't subtract from the overall enjoyability of this brew. Certainly something that any BA should try out especially for <$10 a sixer."
""
""
""
"O: If this is the German equivalent of Budweiser, I now know why ze Germans denigrate our macro lagers - this shits all over most of the BMC crew from a great height. No, it's not interesting or great, but it will get you by in a pinch. Good for parties, fishing, or any other activity that benefits from shutting your brain off."

"I love this stuff - I can’t add anything to the reviews that hasn’t been said (and said better than I ever will), so I will just say that I whole heartedly recommend it to anybody looking for a great sessionable beer that you won’t get tired of. Fantastic with all types of food, especially stuff like pizza or wings, I am a definite fan. I purchase the tall cans from the LCBO here outside Toronto for $2.40 CAD each"

"On-tap. Shaker glass @ Freiburg (Barcelona). Golden color & Crystal clear appearance. White froth & fairly good retention. Herbs & mint, flowers & honey to the nose. Sweet maltiness at first sip. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Clean bitterness, minty freshness & spicy touch. Dry bitter finish. Easy drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Although I enjoy this one either way, it's best served at room temperature. It isn't as smooth as some other pilsners I've tried, but it does have a good quality to it. I fell in love with this one while stationed in Baumholder, Germany. I was still a wannabe beer connoisseur and Bitburger was the first one to intrigue me."
""
""
"Clear, pale straw color, excellent, though subdued nose. Taste is a great balance of pale malt and noble hops, with a fine, dry finish. The right carbonation gives this a nice bite but the malt and hops shine through, and again, that dry finish at the end is perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not bad compared to other similar beers."

"Bitburger pours a straw golden color with a lot of bubbles and a small head. There is a an aroma like dirty dishwater. The taste is watery, soapish, and also tastes like dirty dish water. Very light, which helps it, but just undrinkable. Overall looks good, but tastes bad."
""
"Incredibly refreshing beer, the sort of thing you want now and then. Or at least, the sort of thing that I want now and then. Recommended, especially if you can get it in cans. Those who like Pilsener Urquell are particularly directed to this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : Drinkability is astronomically high. Meaning very session able beer. I would buy this beer again. One of the good find for the year"
""
""
"Overall an easy drinking, but much lighter yet still flavorful German Pils."
""
""
""
"Refreshing and a lovely contrast to all the international style lagers at a Bolivian beer festival. Biggest noticeable difference was the dryness delivered by more present hops and a grainy aftertaste. No fruitiness whatsoever. Second time trying this, and while I might have preferred it out of the bottle versus in a can, it was still a welcome contrast to the barely pilsners available here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops are spicy and flavorful, not just generically bitter. They’re well balanced against the body of the beer - its flavor profile, which is delicious. The weight of the beer is ideal; not ludicrously heavy, not too light. Everything is so well balanced, so tasty, so delicious, that you feel that it’s all just ideally right. Just right, and nothing else. And, the pleasure doesn’t fade as you drink. This is a superb beer."

"Very Bright noble hops up front. Smells like malty goodness. Oh wow is this a delicious beer. Previously I wasn't so impressed but I was wrong. This pils has a ton of flavor and goes down easy. So nourishing and refreshing. Head retention isn't so good but whatever you're supposed to drink to this fast anyway. This is an all around great pils."

"Crystal golden colored beer, white foam that vanishes fairly quickly.Poor aroma,nothing at all.It is very light flavored, a bit sweet if it is not very cold.Bitterness too mild. Well carbonated,big bubbles that shows a light bodied beer.Good for a hot summer, drink it extra cold."

"Downtown SD at the Neighborhood on a warm evening, thought this sounded refreshing. Poured into a pint glass, the beer reveals an pale straw-yellow and forms a unusually frothy head that leaves sticky lacing all over. Subtle grassy scents and citrus are packaged in a bready bouquet. The palate is slightly malt-forward and crackery, quickly dried by hop essence. There are few nuanced flavors, and the light and bubbly mouthfeel doesn't help matters. Short, dry finish...this brew highlights the boring side of Reinheitsgebot."

"What I got smelled of corn and cereal although it had no reason to do so, with a rounded flavor and sweetness emphasizing more of the same. I wasn't expecting greatness but I had been hoping for a little more spark and life from this one. Wondering if the hops have faded, or it’s normally this way. Meh."

"Overall a fantastic beer. Easily at the top of my list when it comes to pils. I may have to try some out of a can/bottle to see if that makes a big difference."
""
""
"Sludge is the first word that comes to mind...swill is a close second. Almost no head, no lacing, a horrible stale taste that lingered in my mouth followed my trauma of drinking this stuff. Hard to believe this is made in Germany. I will note...Born on date on bottle says it was made 7 months ago. Not sure if this made it worse, but it sure didn't get better with age."
""
"Overall: Great session beer, clean and refreshing."
"Overall it has flavor, which is good, and it is better than many mainstream Pilsners. I would choose it over any BMC."
"A stand out pilsner."
""
""
""
""
"When a beer is crisp and refreshing up front, followed by a bitter after taste... they always make me think they were designed that way to make you take another drink to get some relief from the bitter."

"Not all that remarkable."
"Poured from a 500ml can into an imperial pint glass. Color is an almost-medium gold and it had a big creamy white head that doesn't last long, but leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is nice, with floral and bread. It has a pleasant sweetness, mimicking the aroma, but balanced against a nice hop bitterness on the finish. It has a thicker mouthfeel and a little carbonation which make it quite pleasant. All in all, a nice German pilsner."
""
""
"Before the age of 8 I thought this was as far as beer went. It was all my family and their friends drank in Germany. Crates and cases. I hated this beer, it was one of the main reasons I never drank. I found it fitting to put this at 500. I can firmly say that it's not terrible, hell, it's even good. I can see why they were drinking these like water...it is, but it's tasty water. Thank you nostalgia."
""
""
""
"m-a bit thicker than you would expect, fills me up"
"Cheers!!"
""
""
"I cannot say that this was good, but good enough. This fits through the realm of anything in the grocery better than a lager. This beer has a good mouthfeel, otherwise you are able to taste a mix of hoppy malty tricks. The smell is a tad sour, but it still lasts me beyond the hour. This has a nice color, a color that tells me that everything is ok and that it is time to grow a little garden and spend my time studying the terms of an examined life."
"O: as underrated a brew as any you can name. it's full of good barley taste and stings your tongue with those wonderfuly spicy noble hops. and this one doesn't dry me out like other pilseners, making virtually a perfect German version. LOVE IT!"
""
""
""
""
"overall: if pils is what you are after this is a good choice, i personally love this beer, and could talk about it for as long as required,pairs up amazingly with just about anything spicey. cooked meats. whatever. its a great beer. and i find it cuts that hankering for a crispy pilsner like no other."
""
"Slightly better than the sum of its parts. I would like to taste a freshly packaged version, especially on tap. Nice balancing act between the malt and hop components."
"O: Overall, not bad. The style in general is rather blah in my opinion, and this is no different. Minimal aroma and flavors, but what is there is pretty good. Certainly better than the BMC options that are out there, but not something I would choose to drink again. Pretty good for the style though."
""
"The beer appeared a nice light golden color with visible carbonation rising to the top of the glass that had a nice 2 finger, white, foamy head that was retained nicely. The nose was a light malty sweetness, as expected from a good pils. The taste of the beer was good and it followed the nose, but with a hint of spice, which was probably attributed to the hops. The beer had a good feel to it, nicely carbonated and light. The beer was extremely easy to drink. The beer was clean, crisp, and one that I will definitely be drinking again."
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: ""Germany's No. 1 Draft Beer"" is pretty much what I expected. An average adjunct lager. Would I drink it again? Probably not, but it is cheap and would go nicely with pizza and a football game..."

"o - overall i didn't have high expectations, but this is a pretty nice sessionable beer (although i believe the true definition of sessionable is less ABV). definitely a step up from many of the macros out there. i could easily throw several of these back in an evening, but in the world of crazy crafted brews this is not a standout...but solid german pils."

""
""
""
"O: I might recommend it to a horse or another animal that likes the taste of grass, but just ""OK"" for the human palate. I was thirsty enough to finish it, but I wouldn't buy another."
""
"Overall, what we like best about this one was the drinkability. The flavoring never became overwhelmingly bitter, and actually loosens up quite a bit by the end of the sip, allowing for a cleaner, fresher finish. The nose seemed overly adjuncty, and was not entirely inviting, but we were happily surprised once we dug into the flavoring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear golden yellow, darker than most pilses I have been served, with a thick, fine-bubbled ivory head. Strong, malty aroma has an overtone of sweetish pear, almost like a cider. Crisp, malty flavor has a firm fruity note, mainly pear, and just a hint of hops. Smooth texture has good body and good fizz. Overall, a very good pilsner."
"Slight corn taste, but no one taste is overwhelming. Pairs with whatever you throw on a grill. I am going to have to visit there someday"
""
"I like most German beer, but this was $8.99 for a box of six, which to me is on the spendy side. $8.99 for six (and these are 11.2 oz bottles) to me means it better be very good beer, and I think this beer is good, but not amazing. So, what I mean is, it's a little overpriced in my book for how good it is. The price is comparable to Leffe and Hofbräuhaus, but I think those beers are slightly better than this."
""

""
""
"Overall damn fine cheap german beer thats easy to chug. Much better than typical American swill."
""
""
""
"O: This is the beer I wish we had in the good ol’ USA whenever we went to a sporting event, a dive bar, or even just your standard family cookout – maybe then I wouldn’t hear so many people say “I don’t like beer” because the majority of what the country drinks is swill. Bitburger Premium Pils, while nowhere near a perfect pilsner, has a pleasant hop character and a general palate that’s not a challenge to put down; unfortunately, that’s more than you can say about anything Bud, Miller, or Coors puts out."
"Poured this into a Stella Artois stemmed glass, Pure withe head sitting over clear pale yellow liquid. Nose is grassy/hay-ish, slight floral hoppiness there too, not too shabby. Flavor is light bodied, crisp, bitter, clean...very quenching. The finish is a nice bitter note left on the palate after the swallow. Great session beer, great on a hot day like today. One of my top German Pils, very refreshing served on the chilly side."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Overall - Medium bodied. Powerful without being overly-aggressive. Natural tasting and refreshing for a summer night. A very nice consistency that does not taste watered down at all."
"Hot damn! So happy to score this 16.9oz can four-pack for $5.99. A ridiculous value beer with 'summertime' written all over it!"

Is it better than anything that huge American breweries churn out in mass production? Yes. A fine beer, but not up to the level of almost all the other excellent German beer I have consumed."

"It was a very pretty beer poured into the nonic, a pale straw with an inch head. Fairly picturesque. The smell wasn't anythin' to write home about. It smelled like a pilsner: some light hops, a little metallic, and some citrus. The taste was similar, though better, the metallic taste wasn't as present as I would've thought, though the citrus smells weren't as present in the taste. It starts off fairly bitter and ends with a nice dry, bitter finish. The mouthfeel was perfect, moderate carbonation and very, very refreshing. Not a complex beer, but good enough to sip and enjoy on a regular day, catch a game with or to drink far too many of."

"Can, 500 ml. Pale golden yellow colour against the light, one finger head, some bubbles on the side. The strong malts aroma hit me even as I opened the can. A bit grassy smell now that it's on the glass too. Great taste, perfect amount of bitterness, would have gotten a higher point if it wasn't that metallic, maybe it tastes even better from a bottle. Mouthfeel is medium thick, average carbonation."

"To be honest, the beer is basically slightly above-average. The taste is not going to wow you, as it's very light and with very modest carbonation. However, it does make up for the ""blandness"" with its drink-ability factor. Not a bad beer, very refreshing and I wouldn't mind drinking it again if I'm just hanging out in the backyard. Not a beer I would actively suggesting though."

"Tall can into tall mug. Lovely. This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a healthy bit of white froth. The nose comprises light grass, sweet flowers, mild wheat, and a touch of cornmeal way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more corn tossed in for good measure. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a very solid pils, easy-going all the way."

"Overall: a nicely refreshing Pilsner. Usually I don't love really grainy lagers, but this one seems to work for me."

"Things here are above average except its appearance. Anyway, still pretty good and highly yet easy drinkable. A fan of German’s pils should never miss."

"Overall, easy drinking decent pils."
"o: Really enjoyed this beer. I really like the honey graham cracker aroma and flavor. The hoppiness is pleasant and lingers in the mouth after the finish."

"This beer pours a clear, pale yellow with no head or lace. It's aroma is of lemons and dough. The flavor is lemony with a hint of sweet malt, balanced by a hop bitterness that increases as it warms. The mouthfeel is thin. Bitburger Premium Pils is only an ok beer but a good match for Wiener Schnitzel, sauerkraut, and mashed potatoes. Recommended."

"Out of a bottle this Pils was a clear, golden color with an eggshell white head. The finger of foam left scattered lacing. The aroma was faint but what I did smell was a blend of dry grains, noble hops and crystal malt. The flavors were... well… boring. To my palate there wasn’t much going on here which surprised me given that this beer was a good reputation amongst beer drinkers. I mostly tasted wet malts, some floral hops and a hint of skunkiness. “Is this normal?” I wondered. The body was light, the mouthfeel a bit watery and the carbonation medium/high. Sub par in my opinion; I don’t really know what the fuss is about."
""
""
"Looks like a standard yellow pilsener, good clarity with decent frothy head, smells very faintly of a pale malt, can't find any hops in the nose at all. Tastes of a strong 'hard water' aspect with its mineral overtones laid on top of a standard pilsner malt and whisper thin Saaz in the very background, that could have stood magnification IMHO. Body is light crisp and refreshingly carbonated. This is an ""OK"" sturdy workhorse of a German Pilsener, best used in sessions or as a palate recovery tool between other, more complex offerings."

"Bought this because I wanted to try something german, not a bad choice. Pretty decent beer, could be described as a good european budweiser. This pours a darker golden color with a nice head. It smells of malted barley and has a nice hint of hop in the taste. smooth beer, good, i'll buy it again, maybe not."
"The Bitburger beer is a good Euro style Pilsner. The beer poured a clear light yellow, with a thick fluffy white head, good retention with plenty of lacing. The smell is grainy with Saaz and grassy hops. The taste follows the nose. A well balanced pilsener with a nice amount of bitterness on the back end. This brew is light bodied with decent carbonation. This was better than I expected and was refreshing."

"The flavor has a distinct biscuit taste along with grassyness that I attribute to the hops. The finish is very crisp and clean with moderate bitterness. Nice prickly carbonation. This has always been a favorite of mine. It is awesome on a hot day and tends to be priced pretty well."
""
""
"This is an awesome German Pils. I will say that it seems much fresher in other parts of the world. I drank a lot of this in Hong Kong an it had more of a fresh hop character and was certainly better than the bottles that I've had in the US. This is one of my favorite styles and I think that Bitburger is one of the best even though it is kinda run-of-the-mill. I really like that the hops come through so much in such a light beer."
""
"Overall, a 3.5 for ""nostalgia"" but does not travel well to the States having had it in a bottle back home. Have it on tap in Germany and it's good as gold - enjoy!!"
""
"O -- Okay, this is actually a pretty good rendition of the style. Not a bad drinker for the price, nice and clean flavors, more character than your average macro lager. And very nice at 4.8%."
"Bitburger hits a sweet spot in being drinkable,affordable,and well made,not a knockout,but steady."

"Overall: This is a nice pilsener, not as good as I remember but I didn't know anything about beer back then. I could see some college kids getting a hold of it and thinking they found the best beer in the world. I may not ever drink it again for the taste but I will for the memories."

"Full review @ http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D: Very drinkable, this is a beer that would be a go-to beer in a party situation for me."
"O -- Very pleasant and refreshing. Low ABV ensures a good time to tip back a few without getting sideways."
"T: A slight hop sourness upfront with some cracker-like malt, lemon, and some floral hop resin on the finish. There wasn't enough of a hit from the hops for me. It kind of just tasted like a slightly better bud light."
"O - Slightly above average. Ill keep buy this at 3.99 for 4 pints. A good starter beer to get you ready for a night of amazing beer."
"Would drink again."
"To be honest, I really like this beer. I have it pretty often and it's my go-to beer for when I can't be bothered dealing with hops. For $15 per mini keg you cant go wrong...."
"I'd definitely buy a six pack for myself. I probably wouldn't use it as a party beer."
"O: I'm not much a fan of Pilseners, but this is ok for the style. A decent session beer. Maybe a gateway beer."
"O) This is a decent pilsner, and it went down easy. If your looking to pound down some cold ones while cleaning out your garage, or doing some yard work, Bitburger will get the job done."
"Final Grade: 3.83, a B+."
"For the price and the straightforward high-quality simplicity, this one's hard to beat."
"O- Easy to drink, but not too much too it. Forgettable beer."
"Nose classic lager, taste is also very traditional - quite watery with a touch of sour beers specific to that class and spreads the flavors slightly unpleasant - that prevents the beer to go further in the flavors offered. Just a bit of bitterness to raise a bit of malt but it's finally all."
"The taste is surprisingly more of the same, which is surprising since I wasn’t expecting the taste to in any way resemble apples, but it kind of does. It’s got some simple spicy hops in there, but not too much. It’s got a very clean grain flavour, nothing like an American lager. I’m thinking this is totally free of adjuncts. This is a good beer. I wasn’t expecting it to be, but it definitely was. Delicious, refreshing and easy and fun to drink. For a lager that looks so overly clean, it really surprised me."
"Poured this from a can at the LCBO. Light yellow, crisp and clear, poured a two finger fluffy white head, good retention with plenty of lacing. The smell is grainy with grassy hops. Notes of light fruit and bisuit. Taste follows the nose. A well balanced pilsener with a nice amount of bitterness on the back end. This brew is light bodied with decent carbonation. This was better than I expected and was refreshing after a long day in the sun."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 2 inch puffy white head that settles to a small cap. A nice patchwork of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, grass, and white grapes/grape juice. Taste is of grain and grass flavors with some grape juice as well. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pilsener that I got on the cheap at Trader Joe's. Glad I picked one up."
"I find that Bitburger is much better out of a glass, for some reason; out of the bottle it can be ordinary."
"O- This is a pretty good beer. It's not blowing me away or anything like that, but I would certainly have this over any of Australia's mass produced bullshit any old day of the week. I find it hard to believe that this is one of the more common beers over in Germany- hell, if that's the case, then I'm moving! At least I wouldn't be offered Carlton Cold anytime I'm at a mate's place!"
"O- not the greatest pilsner, but still available, affordable, and underrated."
"Bought a six pack the other night to try out. Pours like a light lager. Not much of an aroma on this beer. Pretty light on the hop flavor, I would classify this more as a lager than a pilsner. Pilsners should have more of an upfront hop flavor in my opinion. Can taste some maltiness, my guess is that it is brewed with a double or triple decoction. No complaints on the mouthfeel, was on the higher side of carbonation."
"Overall - Tastes like a german pilsner but lacking in good flavors. Ok to drink"
"Overall: Nice football tv-evening beer"
"Bitte ein Bit!"
"O: Thirst quenching dry crisp yet flavorful grainy moderately malty beer. Nice having it on a hot summer day with some German sausages."
"Still a nice well balanced Pils, clean and refreshing."
"Goes down easy at the end of the 40th-something day straight of 100+ degree heat. The quality and craftsmanship of German brewed lager packaged in a vessel with superior preservative attributes equals a nice drinking experience."
"Classic, if unexceptional example of the style. Good value."
"Pale golden yellow colour with a 1 finger white head that shows decent lacing and retention. Weak aroma of sweet grains, mineral, and some grassiness, not much overall. A lightly bready malt backbone with lots of grainy sweetness and a surprising snappy, slightly peppery bitter finish. Light and prickly, effervescent body. Crisp and refreshing pils, could do a fair bit worse in terms of imported options."
"Poured from a 500 ml can into a mug. Clear golden color, small head that melted quickly. Not much in the way of scent, some pilsnerish smell in you lean into it. The taste has that familiar pilsner sting, with crisp finish and decent hop hints. Not all that spectacular/stand-out for the style, but very solid for an everyday kind of ""go to"" beer, especially during hot summer days."
"This beer pours a pale straw color, white head you'd expect to find with the style, nothing more than that. The smell is a mix between pilsener and adjunct lager, one I like...and one I don't. This leans towards the unfavorable side. Everything thing else meets expectation but does not exceed it. This is a simple easy drinking pilsener, but it's incredibly underwhelming in regards to setting itself apart from any macro on the market. I can drink it, but it really wouldn't be a top choice."
"O: Grape drank. legit, I'm digging this beer. There's a solid german pils on the base but right up top is a serious taste of grape drank. GRAPE DRANK!"
"500 ml can into a snifter...appearance is super golden and clear with a decent white head that subsides quickly. Body still has carbonation though. Nose is pilsener but lacking in that lovely yeast funk that the best have. It's a bit sweet on the tongue but still very clean and an easy drinker. As far as mainstream brews, this is a good one. I'd drink this over Budweiser or Miller anyday, and it's not that much more expensive. Goes well with standard BBQ fare, sausages and burgers."
"This beer pours an ultimately clear and bright golden yellow in color with a one finger bright white head. It smells of only slightly sweet malts with light honey. It's sufficient but not as potent as it probably should be. The flavors are clean and refreshing. It tastes of soft sweet and slightly bitter pale malts with a soft sweet finish. It's ok but pretty standard. It drinks fine, crisp and clean. It drinks very well for non-swill out of a can. Overall this beer is very drinkable, especially on hot days. This is a lawnmower drinker hands down. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something that's TOO easy to drink for random occasions."
"O - Standard pilsner. Not a bad beer here just not alot going on. Very light and a great thirst quencher."
"O - A very nice lager and very sessionable"
"I never even noticed this on the Irish Lions menu before, so I thought I would try it. This is a better than average pilsner. It has a nice copper color, and that traditional pils/lager smell. The taste is pretty good! Nice maltiness, some hops flavor. A nice dry mouthfeel. Went very well with my food!"
"Pours a beautiful golden, yet translucent color. White head. Nose isn't so great with some skunk and cooked vegetables, along with some herbal qualities. Very crisp and dry on the palate though. Light bodied, but not watery. Easy drinking. Would like to have on draft to compare side to side."
"Stellar beer."
" Grade B- Serving temp. 42 degrees F"
"Notes: $1.79 for a good beer in a can slightly larger than a pint makes Derek highly satisfied."
"Light, crisp, refreshing, no heavy or off flavors. An all around winner in the Pilsener category. Better than many other Pilseners I've had (including Urquell). Clear, golden color, lemony, slightly spicy in the nose. Has a bit of a bite to it from the nice, sharp carbonation and spicy finish. Clean and very drinkable. I always remember enjoying this one. I've easily bought this 20 times over the years, but I rarely pick it up at the store because it's kind of hard to find. Whenever I bring it home and crack one open I am not disappointed."
"Pours a clear gold with a decadent frothy head. The head subsides slowly leaving mild lacing. The nose is very subdued sweet malt and a faint skunky aroma. Its flavor is smooth and sweet with a faint hop finish. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy and pleasantly light bodied. This is an above average export pils for certain. Not a great deal of flavor but very pleasant and does its job nicely. Very versatile would be splendid in hot weather."
"Bitburger German Pilsner starts with a golden yellow pour that has a very white head on it. The head faded and you left with some lacing but hardly any. The smell is of fresh grains and cut grass, Not my favorite smells when it comes to beer. The Flavor is nearly the same as the aroma but with a little spark of bitterness in the end. It's a lighter brew so you can drink it easily. Not really what I want in a beer but I guess it's ok for whoever likes it."
"Overall. Nice stuff. Would be great at the beach."
"Overall - I'd say this is an above average euro-beer. It's decent for the style and would be good for the warmer weather. I'd still be Radeberger before this though.."
"High marks for Bitburger."
""
"D- VERY drinkable, complex enough to get you come back for more and the sessionable ABV is nice"
"RJT"
"Pretty unimpressive color, light honey yellow. No head and very little lacing, but great clarity. Smells malty & spicy. There's a good dose of noble hops. Very German. Not much complexity but surprisingly fresh-smelling. The taste leads off with a pretty good mix of spicy hop and sweet malt character. The body manages to be light but not thin. Hops take over on the swallow but never really become that assertive. The beer doesn't taste very strong or complex or interesting. Its real strength is the balance. It's very refreshing, and while you won't find anything new or exciting here, it is without a doubt a pleasant drinking experience. Highly quaffable. A superb session beer if you're in a German kind of mood."
"Dr: 3.50 pound? Are you fecking kidding me like? Look elsewhere for great beer, lads, but give this a go if you come across it - just don't pay more than 2.50 quid. Fuck's sake."
"With one sip, the beer becomes spicy-sweet and floral. With the next- bitter, biting, and minerally. All the while, the beer keeps giving waves after wave of flavor for such a simple beer. It's actually quite nice and welcomed."
"Notes: It's a solid clean and very drinkable lager."
"D: Very good. Would be a nice beer to have, ice cold, on a hot summer day."
"A rather simple German Pilsner. Pours a pale golden color that is slighty cloudy with a fast diminishing head. There is the scent of cheap grains and wheats. Has a very grainy taste to it a slight lemon hint to it but overal rather weak and simple. If you like a simple imported beer, give it a try otherwise this one is pretty forgetable."
"Better than run-of-the mill pilsner. Quite bitter, quite tasty. Decent stuff, would drink again."
"Pours straw yellow color, thin white head. Less carbonation than I expected. Nice smell, plenty of hops and an earthy, yeasty scent. Good taste. Smooth, a good pilsner. The mouthfeel is a little lacking though - it's a smooth beer and there's not quite enough bitterness for a pilsner."
"Nothing unique to offer."
"I've had this beer from tap, bottle, and can and I would recommend avoiding the bottle experience. Stick to a draft or find a can 4pk and a pint glass to go with it. Nothing really unique here, but it is a solid beer and a easy drinker."
"Very drinkable beer. I could easily drink 4 or 5 pints of this no problem."
"A lager with an above average flavour - very refreshing. Goes down nicely, and I would have this again if I came across it in a pub."
"I find this a fairly pedestrian beer. It certainly isn't gross, nor does it have anything particularly wrong with it. It just doesn't do anything to set it apart from other German pilsners."
"A missed opportunity, I now understand where my cousin was coming from."
"D - Absolutely. It's my go to beer to bring to friends and not drink Bud, Miller etc. Have a few and relax."
"i can drink bitburger anytime, anyplace. at the going rate it is by far my go to beer to have around and goes exceptional with my homemade pizzas"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable, particularly on a hot summer day."
"Slainte and Prost."
"I love this beer, simple, honest and good."
"Certainly an easy drinking Pils. A good example of this style."
"D: Not impressed, a little too yeast dominant."
"Overall, the appearance and smell of this beer is misleading. It tastes really good and is easy to drink. I recommend this if you are looking for something easy to drink, yet delicious."
"Nothing special but exactly what a low to middle grade version of the style should be. A good beer for Gemütlichkeit!"
"This style doesn't excite most people I know, but this is an example of a very solid pils. The body is delicious and the bitterness level is right on. I approve."
"This beer is a light golden, clear well carbonated with a nice head med. lace. The smell is slightly skunky. Crisp taste but a little on the bitter side. I think room temp. is better for this beer as the chill tends to retain the bitterness. I was stationed in Bitburg Germany and tasted quite a few of these..I can get a few of these down w/no problem."
"D: Easy going down. I would compare it to an American Budweiser for drinking: easy to drink a lot, but tastes way better."
"In summer or a hot day would take 2 or 3 without thinking"
"500 ml bottle. Pours straw color with a little white head and much carbonation. Sweet malt and light hops aroma. Taste is stale grain and light perfume hops. Light body and long earthy finish. There is nothing special in this brew, I expected much more."
"D: Easy to drink, but not necessarily a good thing."
"Perfectly fine to wash down a burger or two."
"Prösterchen!"
"EDIT: found one in the back of the fridge, revisiting it now. Upped my previous rating of mouthfeel from 3 to 3.5. It really aint that bad of a beer, I certainly would far rather have one of these than the cheep American swill we all refer to as BMC!"
"Overall this beer seems watered down with little distinguishing features. It is easy to drink and refreshing though. Drink it when it's hot outside."
"Picked up a single bottle at Trader Joe's a while back for $1, and it's been sitting in my fridge till I cracked it open last night. Poured it into a Bitburger .04l stemmed glass. Sunshine yellow color, clear body, with lots of carbonation and a decent looking fluffy white head. Smell was somewhat musty and skunky. Taste was nothing spectacular. Tasted a lot of corn flavor and heavy on the malt, though the malt did not weigh this beer down. I found it halfway smooth and easy to drink. My overall impression is that one Bitburger is palatable, but I could not drink a few of these in one night."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet Euro lager kind of smell, with small hints of earth and skunk. In the taste, small dry to a clean standard Euro lager taste, with hints of earth and a small hop. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean aftertaste. Just another kind of standard Euro lager."
"drinkability - this is a refreshing beer for anytime you feel like having something nice and clean"
"d - Fairly easy to drink because of the low ABV, but I don't think I'd really look to order it again. Nothing really stood out in the smell or taste, just a lot of grain and bready malts. Wouldn't order again."
"Overall, it's a good beer to sit and have a few of."
"Where's the noble? Really nothing special here."
"Pours with foamy soap head. Aroma is of grain, very light not to bold. Head does not last long as it dissipates, leaving small trace. Grain, some bread and hay upfront in the taste. Good bitterness in the drink itself. Okay beer, very good for the style, just not my preference."
"Pours very clear, very yellow. A tall & airy white head appears. Smell is light, and very grainy, like a silo. Pilsener all the way. Tastes good, a mineral top exists with the sheer biscuitness. Bitter finish, and maybe a little ""canny"" but that's not enough to draw the drinkability down, because I could drink these all day. A solid imported German beer for a good price."
"overall a pleasant beer w/ some standout attributes. at the same time there are a couple turn-offs. it all seems to come together nicely in the end but there are a few pointers that this beer is a macro"
"Better than when I've had it in the past, but all in all, still the same Bitburger. Not nearly as quality as the ads during soccer games on ZDF would have you believe. A great pizza beer though. Prost!"
"0.33L stubby bottle with freshness date: 240211 Poured into small wine glass (I was in a hotel room). Strong hoppy skunky nose. Pours a crystal clear pale yellow with a noisy bubbly head. Beading carbonation rises furiously from the base of the glass to the surface. Ultra clean, crisp bitter bite. Simple and thirst quenching. Great served cold on a hot day with brats and imported old world mustards."
"Real real drinkable. I like this."
"D: more please"
"Clear pale yellow with one finger of white head. Some lacings. Head recedes to a ring that lasts all the way to the bottom of the glass. Smells like grain and flowers. Taste is quick Pils bitterness with a kiss of malt. Some light lemon follows. Mouthfeel is just right and carbonation is somewhat soft. Drinkability is quite good if you are a fan of Pilsner style beer. Medium dry finish."
"Got to enjoy and love this beer in Mainz, Germany on vacation. This was the beer of choice on tap at my hotel bar and after getting used to the first which was a hoppier and slightly more bitter(but in a wonderful way) beer then I was used to fell in love with it and drank it almost exclusively. Two weeks on a Bitburger beer diet and I had a hard time adjusting to anything else."
"Poured from a 16.9 ounce can into my oversized snifter. Pale yellow color with about an inch of head that soon disappeared into a whispy film on the beer. No real scents other than some cut grass or hay. Nothing outstanding in the flavor, some straw or hay flavor. I think this beer is over hyped as Germany No. 1 beer. I guess I am not impressed. One can is enough for me."
"I tried Bitburger for the first time in Germany...it was a touch better there, as I recall, but then again overseas shipping has to mess with your flavor just a tad. Still, this one is WAY better than some other imports I've had lately, and I have to say that I am glad I picked up a BIT this week."
"Poured into a pint glass a clear light yellow gold. Not much of a head to speak of even with a vigorous pour, though it is well carbonated. Smells bready with strong floral notes. Tastes of sweet malts slightly overpowered by bitter hops and pre-ripened grapes. Definitely a medium bodied pils, not too light. Crisp mouthfeel with a dry finish. An extremely popular macrobrewed beer in Germany, but a bit overpriced here in the states for what it is. I do like it though and recommend everyone try it at least once."
"Beautiful in glass, very light color but a very consistent light caramel color. First taste is very light, a little too cold to get full flavor. A little time to warm and the flavor starts to expose. Pear and apricot with a light lemon aftertaste. Very easy to drink. It was very good with the heavy German food that I was eating. I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor when colder and the lack of real luster. It is just a good beer, not really something I will seek out. Worth a try."
"A good drinkable beer on a hot summer day, one of the better canned beers of this style and worth $1.49 for a tallboy."
"Taste, well, the champagne of beers (strictly carbonation based) would have fit this beer aptly. Tons, little bubbles, even the color looks the part. Taste, well this is better, it does taste like beer kind of, but with some seltzer water in it. Budweiser with a Euroish hop and yeast strain, but more expensive."
"D - will defs buy again, inexpensive and good."
"D - This one goes down easy. It's a tasty Pilsner."
"lot's of folks on BA give pilseners/lagers weak reviews, i love ales as much as the next beer snob, but with the heat of summer ive been diving hard into the pilseners to try and find my favorites. bitburger is one of those favorites. to me it's a good mix between a pils, and a lager. not as dry and white peppery as some czech pilseners, and the malt is more noticeable like a lager. it's fatty like a lager, but buttery like a pils... right amount of skunk. crisp finish, that doesnt dry out your mouth. i found that if i take the time to notice the smaller things in lagers, they are just as complex as ales. this is a new discovery for me, and has opened up wonderful doors."
"D- Light bodied, crisp, pretty refreshing. A little bitter for a hot day, but sitting outside on an April Aachen afternoon it was pretty nice."
"D - I find this beer highly drinkable and very clean and well-made. It is nice, but I find it unexciting and bland."
"D - Medium. Personally wouldn't drink more than one in an evening."
"Mouthfeel is medium (not watery like many lagers out there), yet it remains light and crisp on your palate - adds to light and pleasurable drinking. Definitely very drinkable, but may get boring during extended sessions."
"Drinkability - As far as German pils go, this one for me is pretty tolerable. For its high output, this isn't too shabby of a beer. I could possibly see myself coming back for another."
"This is a pretty average and drinkable German lager. Looks very clear with a light head. It has a little hoppy aftertaste but not much. This is the kinda beer you can drink one after the other. It's very smooth and good for people without hoppy tastes."
"Very drinkable."
"D: A solid, no-frills German pilsener. Pleasant, but the mouthfeel holds it back a bit. I picked up four 500 mL cans for about $6, so it's pretty reasonably priced. Worthwhile if you're a fan of German brews."
"I tried this beer on August 18, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The bveer poured a translucent pale gold with a generous white rocky head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was grainy malts with some hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, and mildly carbonated. The flavour was more grainy malt with a bitter hop finish. Easy to drink, but not memorable."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"The typical mass-produced German Pilsners we get over here are either insipid, indistinguishable, adjunct-ridden swill or watered down, emasculated versions of what are otherwise classic and rightfully proud German brands. While I'm sure this would taste better closer to the source, Bitburger is certainly not distasteful nor unpleasant nor does it shame a rich, decorated brewing heritage as so many others do. Bitte, einen weiteren!"
"This is a beer which gives you a lot of pleasure when you drink a few of them. One of Germany's finest."
" the taste keeps you going this is very sessionable beer it is good as most german pilseners and Munich helles lagers"
"Summary: The hoppy bitterness make this unique pils enjoyable for huge gatherings such as Germanfest. I had this beer several times during the festival week. Bitte ein Bit!"
"You could toss a whole lot of these back and they'll still be a lot more satisfying than an American NASCAR beer, but there are better ones out there from the Czech Republic, Germany and the American craft brewers."
"Drinkability - Goes down easy. I would buy this again."
"The first time i discovered this beer was in Hamburg and i was very skeptical at first as i was only 18 and i had never had a beer with the now familiar pilsner taste. I drank this beer every day the three weeks i was there and after the first week I had fallen in love with its golden color and i could drink it for nights on end. Drinking this beer in america is much different because, coming from the midwest, it is usually very old and kind of has a stale taste. Even with this though this beer is still amazing and i would drink this beer every single day if given the chance. It is hard to find in the liquor stores but when i can get ahold of it, it always makes things that much better especially during finals weeks. This beer is by far my favorite beer and the best beer i have ever tasted thus far."
"$2.50 for a large can...IN NEW YORK? ""Sure, why not," I thought...While I wasn't disappointed with this, I wasn't impressed either and would love another shot at this on tap or perhaps with a fresher canned date than 9-22-09 to open on 3-14-10. Poured into a pint glass, this settled a clear light golden yellow color under a one-inch head of medium density. Light malt feel and low bitterness but a refreshing and decent choice above the other $2.50 and under singles at my supermarket..."
"D- All I can say is if you couldn't drink this beer all night there is seriously something wrong with you, no disrespect but this is one of the best pilsners I have ever tasted!"
"I'm enjoying this, it has more to offer than American macro. A good replacement summer quencher."
"I would recommend this beer for anyone that wants a typical European drinking experience. Sure, there are lots of better European beers, but Bitburger is a popular beer, whereas most of those microbrews are going to be more obscure. Think Guinness in Ireland, except that it is Germany."
"I am disappointed with this beer. maybe i should have waited longer to drink this one as I had an Old Rasputin yesterday, so my taste buds might be overly harsh."
"After hearing some discussion on this beer I decided to pick some up. Decided to go with cans as I felt that they would probably have held up a little better over time and distance. The brew pours to a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that had great retention and left a nice amount of lacing. Carbonation is good as bubbles are flowing up from the bottom of the glass. Nice aroma, grainy malt scent with some slight hops that seem to give off lemon and a slightly medicine smell. The flavor is good, seems to be a refreshing brew, nice real summer brew because of the lightness, crispness, carbonation and sweet malt and lemon flavors from the hops. I am glad that I picked this brew up, nice to get a understanding of what a Pilsner should be, will be one that I will try to get friends to try this as I think this could be a nice break from some of the macro stuff that they insist on. As far as drinkability, on a warm day I could really have a number of these, especially at the 4.8% ABV, they go down very easily."
"The nose is decent, solid even. Light grainy, husky character with a moderate lemon and earthy hop character. The earthy character is rather noticeable. The grain character is surprisingly rice-like too. Sweetness is low, this beer is about average? The palate opens crisp with a moderate grainy character, almost a touch astringent, there's some chalky character as well. Hop character is low, there's just a little bitterness and some earthy and lemongrass flavors are present, but this isn't wholly exciting. Light in body with high carbonation, this is decent stuff. The chalkiness is a bit of a detriment, but I'm looking forward to a fresher sample."
"The Germans play second fiddle to no one in the world when it comes to beer."
"Was presented in the proper Bitburger glass with the full head expected on a German Pilsner. The smell has a uniqque sweetness. The taste is crisp with a little sweetness and finishes with a nice bitterness at the end. This beer is refreshing, smooth and easy to drink. This is a good example of what a German Pilsner should be. Is a good beer for more than one or as a session beer."
"The body is medium, but with little carbonation. Very smooth and easily drinkable."
"Now available exclusively in the handy 11.2 oz bottle. Because as we all know it was way too cumbersome lugging around all that extra weight in the 12 oz. size. Thankfully, they didn't decrease the price or improve the quality so not that much has really changed."
"Bitburger Premium Beer was yellow in color with a small white head that reduced to nothing. I double checked the best by date and the Bitburger was fresh. The aroma was grainy and a little skunk, I checked the date again. The taste was creamy, grainy sweetness and buttery. The mouth feel was light to medium bodied and oily, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was good. Bitburger would make a very good session beer. Nothing particularly special, but better that the run of the mill lagers, macro or micro."
"Very clear beer. very nice smell. almost kinda flowery. leaves vitualy no lacing. head disapears very fast. taste is very nice. typical pilsner taste. somewhat kind of fruity, cant quite put my finger on it. al around very nice beer. only downside was it was some what pricey at $9 a sixer"
"Cheap, well-made, goes down well. Not the greatest pilsner out there, but it's still a good patio drinking beer; it's mouthfeel is conducive for sessions."
"Crisp, balanced flavor with a lemony backdrop. This is a refreshing pils, nothing too crazy going on, good with food, and better than I expected."
"D= Not bad at all. Tastes like a German pils to me. Basic and good. Nothing crazy and definitally sessionable."
"This seemed like the German pilsner at its most basic level. It has everything you look for in the style (fruity, hoppy, clean, and balanced), but it doesn't make you think you're drinking an exceptional pilsner. It's good for something simple, relatively cheap, and for drinker on a hot day, but I can think of better pilsners readily available to me that would do the same job."
"D - Not the most taste fulfilling beer I have had, but definitely a beer that I could enjoy on a hot summer day or once in a while from time to time."
"Well done beer."
"I bought this Bitburger because I wanted a pilsner and this one was in a can. There isn't anything wrong with it, but I found myself not really wanting to finish it. I probably won't buy this one again."
"A very enjoyable lager"
"Crystal clear body with a light golden colour. It pours with a giant pillow white head, and insanely active carbonation. The aroma is light and grainy, with a slight floral hoppiness, and a sweet toffee malt backbone. The flavours are quite subtle at first before an even earthy character comes through with a bittersweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very light and massively carbonic. Decent pilsner, not the best I have had though."
"D- This drinks great for the style. A definite session beer. I'm going to be keeping this around."
"Bitburger pils certainly isn't the best German Pilsener, but it's enjoyable. It's a poolside beer for when you're not paying too much attention to minute details because it's just a simple, semi-tasty, clean-finishing beer. Relatively low ABV makes it an easy drinker as well. If you're here for flavor, look at Victory's Prima Pils or Sam Adam's Noble Pilsener, but this is a decent alternative to some American macros, I guess."
"A solid pilsner and one I would buy again."
"D: This is a really smooth, well balanced pilsener. No complaints here. Would make a good session beer."
"a good goto beer when you just want one can of something. the color is a clear but slightly turbid. good lacing and head retention. there is not mcuh to talk about int he nose, a bit metallic and a touch of the hopsthe taste has too many hops for my definition. otherwise it is just real easy summer drinking."
"D - Very smooth and easy to drink. This could go with so many different kinds of food."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is of mild grains. Taste is very mild, some grains, a tad biier, a bit lacking in flavor. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall I must say I was not impressed."
"Overall- not a bad example, but not stellar either"
"D-- Easily do 3 of these. Very drinkable but better off doing them cold. A bit more complex than the standard stuff but this is great on a warm summer day or even just to change pace. the floral part keeps it interesting. On the cheap side and tasty. May be better pils' out there but this is good."
"D - One of the most drinkable beers on earth."
"Mouthfeel is light. Really easy to drink. This would definitely be refreshing on a hot day. Now my favorite style, but I would buy again."
"Drinkability: Toolight, not much flavor here for me."
"D - Very good drinkability due to lightness and low abv."
"I really like this beer for high/rapid consumption. It costs less than local macros here but tastes a lot better. You can drink it knowing your consuming a good product but don't have to worry about savoring every subtle aroma etc."
"I purchased this at the Post Exchange in Korea for approx $4.50 for a six pack. What a bargain. I poured mine in a Pilsner and enjoyed thoroughly. Better than most mainstream pilseners."
"D: My favorite german beer to drink a lot."
" Mass produced Euro beers>>>American macros."
"Really easily drinkable, I could put back a few of these. The aftertastes are very pleasant, and the ABV keeps it in the sessionable range. Might be my new favorite pilsner."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Very light yellow in color. Produced a nice head that slowly disapated with some lacing. Has a nice light German lager taste. Back in the 70's my first year college roomate was a guy from Germany. This beer was brewed in his hometown and he always said we should try to import it to US. It is a good German lager, better than more well known brands. It is a much better buy too. Not sure why it is not bigger than other German beer in the states."
"Crisp, easy-drinker. Not the best pils I've had, but at $1.25 a can it works with a spicy or greasy meal."
"I have a long lists of favorites with a couple of picks per style and this is one of my top 2 in German Pilsners."
"Smooth mouthfeel, a tad higher carbonation than preferable. Great drinkability, definitely could put a few of these back, and especially at this price."
"Drinkable, perhaps a bit boring, but in the end - that's what a pils is."
"D: This is a very well crafted pilsner, good drinkability. Not my favorite style, but I can definitely appreciate a well crafted beer that you can drink alot of."
"I've always heard that this beer is the norm (not to mention fantastic) wherever you go in Germany. I would love to try it in it's homeland."
"D-Really easy to drink. This is the first pilsener I've really liked. I think others that I've had have suffered from being light-struck, but since this canned, it suffers no such fate."
"A great pilsner in my opinion. I love it from the giant can while having some brats."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are better beers in the style but this beer is worth drinking for a while if your choices are limited."
"I am surprised by the overall ""B-"" rating for this one. It is a perfect example of the style. This is Bitburger's primary product and they do it well."
"Really nice Pilsner."
"This beer is drinkable enough for me to have it on my radar for a future, cheap four pack of lager. It's on the light side in terms of bitterness, which really helps in this area."
"If you can find Bitburger, and it's a decent price, get it."
"A solid easy-drinking German Pilsner."
"D: Considering the price, the good looks, decent flavor and the enjoyable mouthfeel, I'll take this."
"D-Quite drinkable, largely attributable to its smooth, easy body. Also, the ambiance of drinking this beer while listening to straigt-up polka music surely helped put me in the German beer mood."
"This is a nice, well balanced session lager. Enough flavor and hop presence to keep it interesting. The malt feels 'soft' and the hops provide a grassy, tingling effect. It's not the best German pils out there, but a 12 pack of Bitte Ein Bit is a pretty decent and affordable option. Overall a refreshing, tasty beer."
"you can drink something like this in Calgary for the same price as our lame macros brewed over here. for the price this is worth a try on a hot day"
"Nice, clear gold with a decent head that fades quickly leaving traces of lacing. Nothing remarkable upfront. Fairly clean and malty with a decent hop kick. A slight bitterness comes up that does not taste like hops, maybe even slightly metallic. This quickly fades, however, and the mouthfeel and finish reminds me of a Fosters for some reason. That is not a bad thing because I like Fosters ok. It is nice and warm today and I could see myself downing a few of these without complaint."
"Drinkability: As BevMo! says, it's ""BEGGING for a heat wave."" Well, it got one, and it hits the spot. There's zero complexity, but it quenches."
"Drinkability - I plan to buy more soon and it went very well with the BBQ spare-rib dinner."
"Light bodied, dry, crisp, slightly spritzy. There's much better pilsner out there. It's drinkable, but I'd rather buy something better than this."
"Beach/Shore: Sure, but you just have to find it in a CAN first."
"This beer poured a light, clear, straw colored yellow. One finger of white head, retention was average and left very little lacing on the glass. Nose is of strong grain and bready malts, with a slight touch of piney hops to it. Taste was rather flat. Grain dn bready malts dominate though not blended well. The finish has a bit of a hop kick but doesn't mesh all that well. Light to medium body, moderately carbonated, crisp finish to it. Based on ABV this is highly drinkable, but I have had better offerings of this style."
"Bitburger Pils on draught. I have had Bitburger Pils in the past. It is an interesting beer. It has an odd flavor that one does not expect from a Pils. As you drink it, the flavor becomes more pronounced. The beer is clear, as you would expect, light yellow in color. The carbonation is steady but it doesn't form a head. There is no lacing on the glass and I cannot recall what the smell is. It is a good beer to try, and I have ordered it on multiple occasions. It is not my favorite beer but everytime I order it I end up trying to describe the flavor to myself. If you see this beer on draught at a bar someplace, check it out."
"Flavor follows the nose with light hops and a balanced and slightly grainy malt sense. Smooth and light bodied make for an easy drinking Pils. Nothing to excite and nothing to distract."
"Had a quarter liter of this before dinner at a fancy german restaurant. The most disappointing part was the size of the beer. I could have had five more but my wife wanted wine. A very drinkable pilsner that rivals with Radeberger as my favorite. Would highly recommend, especially on tap in germany."
"Overall, IMO, the finest mass produced pilsner of any kind on the market. It's rare to find a beer of this quality within its given style that is so incredibly available. A fine beer, and one that will definitely be nearly everpresent in my refrigerator. The perfect lawnmower/anytime beer."
"The body was light and clean, as expected. Very drinkable, as pilsners tend to be. Overall a good example of what a pilsner should be. I expect that having this beer closer to the source, instead of halfway around the planet from it's source, would raise this brews rating. A good introductory pils to use as a baseline for exploring the style."
"12oz bottle. Pours clear straw yellow with a fizzy white head that disappears quickly. Smells faintlly of light, grainy malt with a bit of grassy hop character. Tastes of standard pils malt with clear bitterness in the background. Dry finish. Not a lot going on. Light body with too little carbonation. Pretty characterless."
"D: A good (typical) german beer with obvious hoppy bitternes. This is a beer you wont grow tired of. A rather uncomplicated beer that wins in the long run since they havn't messed it up - don't fix what's not broken."
"I poured vigorously into a Shipyard Export pint glass to little head which quickly went away. It smelled skunky like a lot of imports do. It actually tastes better than it smells. I guess it really doesn't have that much taste. I could probably drink a few of these if there were no other options. Fortunately, I have a lot of better beer in the fridge."
"Do yourself a favor and have one of these. Prosit!"
"These German pilseners are made for drinkability. The hops contribute to a dryness which leads to another gulp. There are better tasting pilseners out there, but this beer is on another level compared to American micro pale lagers."
"drinkability is great - this is a perfect summer pounder"
"Overall: A mouth feel of the beer is creamy and slightly carbonated. The Mouth feel of the beer is astringent and crisp. The finish is lightly medium. This is still a descent drinking pils. There is some metal taste in the beer from the can."
"This beer poured a golden yellow color with a small white head that dissipated quickly. This beer is clear enough that you could almost read a book through it. Aroma and taste are of graininess and the hop bitterness is evident as well. Has a nice mouthfeel. I have come to appreciate the style and this is a very drinkable beer."
"All in all i am ok with the beer. It didn't do anything to make me jump back in my seat and stare at it but it is smooth and refreshing and all in all a good beer."
"Not a bad German pils, with a number of pleasant enough assets working for it - would be a good candidate for a session, especially given the lower ABV, at the very least for a round or two."
"poured from bottle into pilsner glass. pours golden with a thick head that dissolves in about 30 seconds, great clarity. smells grainy with sweeter hops. subtle hint of the hops, a very light, not too complex pilsner taste. lighter body in mouth, moderate carbonation. had this with pizza, complimented it very nicely. very smooth and affordable, drinkability is decent- have gone through two before i reviewed one."
"d: not great, but good fro the $. I've heard people say this is great on tap in Germany. Here it is merely average."
"D- Very drinkable and very affordable for an import."
"Pours a fairly bright yellow and can be seen through clearly. Formed a white, foamy head that took 2 or 3 minutes to disappear. Smelled of pils malt, with some definite sweetness. Tasted, again, of pils malt with only a hint of noble hops. I enjoyed the first half way more than the second, with its bitterness outweighing its flavor by the end. I enjoyed the beer, but as it was advertised as ""one of Germany's best," I was a little disappointed."
"Although this is not necessarily my favorite, you can tell it's a quality beer."
"Crystal clear pale yellow under a thin white head. Light biscuity pils malt aroma with a floral, somewhat tart hoppiness. Taste follows suit...sweet pale malt, fairly crisp, finishing with some noble hops. Light bodied, crispy bitterness lingering. No complaints downing quite a few of these on a warm spring day."
"Light and crisp. Ample carbonation. Nothing too impressive. Very drinkable, as most lagers are. Can't say I've overly impressed, but this is definitely a nice substitute for your typical American macro."
"Drinkability is pretty high as with most pilsners. For the style, it's average."
"A very simple beer, there are better of its style, but it's much better than the majority of pale lagers being consumed in Australia."
"Lemon yellow with a fat, soapy white head of foam that leaves some sliding lace on the glass. Grassy hops and toasted grain in the nose. Taste is much like the smell, buttery toast with a mild citrus hop bite. Finishes dry. Light bodied and effervescent,this is the only beer I know of that tastes way better from the can vs. bottle (I haven't had draft). A refreshing lawnmower beer."
"D- Average brew with an average taste."
"ok so it loses points on that but overall i would call this a good beer. clean, smooth, refreshing, what else do you want in the summer>? ok its not summer yet but im pretending."
"This beer was a tad watery, but that could be the style. Average drinkability. I'd not say no to it in the future, but I'd look to see what my alternatives were before settling on this bottle."
"Drinkability: Only slightly above average. The maltiness in the finish makes it stand above American Lagers. But It could be much better."
"Another wonderful German pilsner. Pours a golden yellow, slightly hazy with a small head. No real lacing left on the glass. Smells slightly of hops and grain. Not overpowering. Taste is just what you expect from a German pilsner. Slightly hoppy with a dry flavor. Excellent taste and very very drinkable. Beer is as light as a macro American lager and that makes it go down smooth and easy. Very refreshing."
"If not for the sediment I could put back quite a few of these. I would like to try again when I can be a little more sure of freshness."
"D= probably a session-beer if you're not in beer-ranatic mode, fine with most meals or for parties, just a very standard typical non-US pilsener with more character than Heinekin and Stella Artois."
"Drinkability - this stuff would go down in quantity. I'll seek it again."
"It's not an incredible beer, but it's quite drinkable, no off flavors to speak of, and the price at $9.50 for 8 half liter cans (roughly a 12 pack of 12 oz. bottles) means that this is my go-to beer when I don't have much to spend."
"Overall an average drink that I would not buy again."
"Drinkability: Alcohol barely noticeable. Its enjoyable as a session beer but the body seems to light and the oiliness hurts its drinkability."
"This was worth the money, and I'm sure I will be buying this again in the future."
"It had a semi-sweet taste with a classic Pilsner bitterness to it. This beer is quite carbonated and very refreshing. To be honest the mix of bitter and sweet makes this one of my favorite Pilsners. Excellent beer."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. went well with my seafood paella"
"Taste is same as smell. Cologne and floral hops. I love a good Kolsch as it is my favorite style of beer. I would consider this a cross between Kolsch and a Pilsner. Very drinkable and you will find yourself ordering another and another..."
"D - Prettd rinkable beer, expected from a pilsner. Was really expecting a German Bud Light, but was presently surprised by a bit of complexity. Not overwhelmed here, but not too bad."
"This is an easy drinker, nice to session with. Would make a great light aperitif beer, drink with seafood."
"I wouldn't have this again."
"Drinkability: A light and refreshing beer, that is easy to drink and yet, still fairly flavorful."
"D - Much more complex in the bottle than in the can (although more expensive). My grandparents bought this half litre for me for $2.19, which is a little pricy, but worth it for a damn good German pilsner. Bitburger is a textbook pilsner and is a benchmark for the style."
"I am reviewing from the mini keg. Pours light golden in color with a nice frothy white head that quickly disappears. Smells hoppy, citrusy and sweet with honey. The taste is malty with a floral finish. The mouthfeel is smooth enough and the beer is easy to drink. Nothing spectacular but an easy drinker that is a much better choice than American macros."
"Not a whole lot in the way of atmosphere here, as with many pilsners. Decent flavor, and feel. Overall, pretty solid for this style."
"Overall, this is slightly above average for a pislner here in Germany."
"Notes from 2/14/05"
"I would buy this again, if I drank at the proper temerature. I drank mine warmer than ususal and it wasnt too bad. Kind of got to like it."
"This one pours a pale gold color with a hint of malt in the smell. The taste doesn't have much to it but it's clean, no hop character to be found really. I would rather have this than any domestic pilsner but there are better German pilsners out there."
"A well balanced pale malt intro, short lasting to a bitter hop finish, crisp and clean. Nothing really fancy here, but quite refreshing. Low alcohol isn't noticable, the body is light to medium. No challenge, just easy drinking straight forward pils, simple."
"Pours a fizzy pale yellow colored body. Has a malty aroma. A dry dusty taste, with a bitter aftertaste. Watery, and grainy. Similar to the domestic fizzy yellow in appearance, aroma, taste. Not good."
"There's nothing fancy about Bitburger, but compared to the other Pilseners in Germany, it's quite good and very accessible. It has a golden body and a soft white head. The smell is somewhat bitter, but not at all herbal like many other traditional German Pils. This beer goes down smooth with a little bitterness, but that should be expected when drinking a Pils. The trick with this beer is to NOT drink it immediately after pouring. The Germans whom I encountered recommended that it is proper to let the beer sit for 7 minutes before drinking. The appropriate glassware also helps to amplify the taste. Bitburger should not be consumed in anything other than a tulip glass or a pokal; anything else would be a sin. Like most German Pils, this beer is light and easy to drink with light foods."
"Fairly straightforward German Pils that's quite drinkable without causing offense. Pale amber with a thin head. Very faint malt aroma. Flavour is a pleasant malt with a fine hop balance. Mostly bread flavoured. True to style without showing anything extraordinary. Very drinkable, though and a pleasant enough barbecue beer. A good beer to start the conversion process for macro swillers. I'd buy it again if there was nothing more interesting about."
"This beer poured a light yellow with a big fluffy two finger head that didn't last too long. The smell has some malts but also an aroma the reminds me of citrus peels and lemon. The taste starts off with some floral hops that give way to some of the citrus with some lemon and grapefruit flavors that end with a little sweet malt. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, a little thicker than water with some very light carbonation. This is pretty drinkable beer, although the hops and citrus might be a bit much for having more than one at a time."
"Pours a crystal clear light straw yellow, very thin looking colour, and a thin white head forms, quickly settles to a ring around the glass, and then disappears entirely. Smell is very toasty, biscuits, honey, grass, light floral and herbal hopping, maltiness is great, no adjuncts, very crisp aroma and very enjoyable. Taste is similar, sweet and malty up front, honey, corn syrup on toast, biscuits, light bit of floral, very dry bready finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very smooth and drinkable. Nice malty pilsener. Had this on tap in Frankfurt once and its far from the hoppiest pilsener but still damn enjoyable for being cheap and easy to find."
"Stinging, biting aroma and taste. This one isn't terrible but it's a little rough around the edges. Aroma is sharp and noticeable. Decent pour, real light yellow with nice fluffy white top and good lacing. Thin and oh so watery the flavor is weak. A biting hoppiness overpowers a lacking malt content. It's drinkable but the finish is rough as well. For the buck it's a solid bargain but if you want a good pils keep looking."
"D- perhaps this would be better mid-summer, but aside from the decent aroma, right now it seems like a pale euro-lager lacking the character of a good german pils."
"Drinks okay, the hop profile I remember is gone, if we have an old can or the beer is the same & I have changed. Worth a try, but not a solid as I remember it being"
"Would I go back? maybe, not in a hurry though. Would like to try this in one of those 5lt kegs - it maybe an improvement."
"The taste has a lot of grain, fresh apple, and herbal hops that have a flowery-lemony character as well. It has light sweetness and a balancing bitterness that just dominates the finish. It's crisp and light, very clean, yet tasty and lively-tingly."
"Pours a clear golden with a small, white head. Smells of freshly baked bread and yeast. Quite a sweet taste with a German yeast strain providing a nice flavor. Nice bitterness to round things out. Mouthfeel is medium, high carbonation. Extremely drinkable, it would be easy to drink many of these. This is an easy drinking, inoffensive, yet flavorful beer. This is also a good beer to drink when you are drinking several. Recommended."
"Enjoyed this brew at Teske's German restaurant in San Jose where it poured a clear light golden color with a goodly white froth of head that dies down within a couple of minutes and lots of lacing. The aroma is light flowery cherry, mild and clean. The flavor is a clean grassy hops and wheat. A very pleasant blend and certainly easy drinking. Perhaps a little thin but not so unusual for the style. A solid pilsner on tap. Nice."
"Anywho, for being cheaper than almost any other beer in the store it's pretty good. It's got a lot more taste than any American macro's which are higher in price and it's very drinkable. The next time I'm hanging out with my friends and wanna have some cheap beer I'm gonna go for a Bitburger."
"Taste: Tastes like an American macro-lager."
"D: The can states Germany's #1 beer and I'm sure that's totally unbiased. I can name several German beers that are better. This one may be better on tap and in an ice-cold, thick, frosty glass. It's not bad but probably tastes better after 2 or 3."
"D: This is really just an average beer in most every way. Not much flavor or personality to speak of. Pass."
"A decent enough german pils. Appearance is rather lack luster. No real head or lacing. Pale straw yellow in color. Smell is pretty faint but some notable hops and sweet malt extract smell come through. Taste is a bit more pronounced, especially the hops. Mouthfeel is average, light and carbonated. Drinkability is good, pretty smooth finish."
"D- Not terrible not good."
"D: decent drinkability."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color with a fluffy sticky head. A light husky grain aroma. Light and husky on the the palate with some grainy biscuitness. There is a unpleasant character toward the finish. I am not sure what it is, corn maybe skunkiness? I am not sure. The point is, I really didn't like it that much."
"My next step is to try it in the 5l mini-keg."
"D- This beer has some good flavors with some good depth to it. Even though the beer is pretty dry it has some nice sweetness to it to give it more character."
"Nothing wrong here, of course, just nothing to keep me coming back."
"D - A wonderful beer, probably the pilsner most suited to my tastes. I wouldn't mind making a night of these, especially with the low ABV."
"D: This beer will leave you wanting more. Highly drinkable without filling you up."
"I was really disappointed with how skunky this was, it may have been one of the worst ones I have tried."
"D- I think this would be an excellent session beer. At the pub, this would be a natural to go with salted nuts, as it will cleanse the palate nicely. A good patio beer, and very enjoyable....much closer to the intended style in my opinion."
"D: Nice session beer."
"Thin, crisp, light and clean, the beer is superbly refreshing with outstanding drinkability."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Big, full foamy head on a bright yellow body. Smell was a bit ""sharp", and also a bit skunky. Smooth to start, mild bitterness at the end. Nothing spectacular here. That skunky smell was a bit off putting, but the taste was decent enough."
"D: Very much so. Perfect brew for summer or any hot day. I may be biased towards these German beers, but I love them. Rarely can I find one that I can't stand. This one holds up to being a good beer."
"Steve"
"Drinkability: I had this at a local bar, and it was a nice switch, but if I'm looking for an imported pils next time, this won't be my first choice."
"pours a very light very clear golden color with a one finger white head that fades quickly and no lace. earthy aromas with a grainy malt taste and some astringency slightly bitter and very dry finish. carbonation ok and mouthfeel light. easy drinking beer if you like that dry finish."
"It is a session beer with the light body and low ABV. Availability in cans is a huge plus and wish more brewers of lighter beers would use that option. Also more affordable than other import pilsners."
"M&D: The mouthfeel is consistently soft as well as refreshing, underlined by a lingering, dryish finish of hops in the background. A mild-flavoured pilsener overall, it drinks pretty well despite suffering a little from the lack of body."
"This beer is between a sipper and a session beer.Not one you want to pound or one you want to nurse."
"I expected a little more from this German import. It's certainly not flavorless, but overall on the light side. It does get better once it's warmed and is probably the best pils to be found in Guatemala."
"It's easy to under-rate or under-value a beer like this, because too many American macro brewers haven taken this style and squeezed the life out of it. Bitburger Pils isn't the best in its class, but it's refreshing, flavorful and well-done...an easy pick on a hot summer day. If you don't go in expecting an Extreme Big Beer Imperial Wallop, you'll get what the brewer intends, which is just a solid, refreshing pilsner. Would love to have this on tap in its homeland."
"I like german pilsner - this was, however, a disappointment. It is in no way near Jever, for example. It needs more hops."
"RJR"
"D: Definitely drinkable, this is a beer that is definitely sessionable. Very nice that it comes in cans, I will be taking it with me to a pool party where glass bottles not allowed in a few weekends."
"Pours fizzy yellow like a standard American light lager with a tiny head that fades to nearly nothing. Smells almost skunky, similar to Heineken. Tastes better than the smell would indicate, but still nothing to write home about. Malt character isn't bad but this is definitely a one time try for me. Glad someone gave this to me and I didn't buy it."
"Pours a pretty average yellow with a nice looking two fingers of bleach white head that retains nicely and even leaves a little chunky lacing as it slowly drops.The nose is not so nice and borderline musty with some faint hoppy spicyness.Slightly sweet malts are first to hit the tounge,with subtle skunkieness not far behind.The finish is spicy and dry,but,clean and very crisp.This is pretty average stuff,I had only one this time,but would not shy away from having it again with food or for a nice thirst quencher."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet grainy malt and spicy hops. The taste is a very nice pils, with sweet grainy malt and a spicy and crisp hoppy finish. Overall, this is a very nice pils that would make a very nice session brew on a hot summers day. Recommended."
"I didn't care for this beer too much. Got it in a can and served it chilled in a pint glass. Poured the typical yellowish gold color of a pilsner. Smell had cereal grains, corn, malt, and some grassy notes. Taste was astringent and not much of finish. Had some cereal grains and light malts in the front. The fizzyness turned me off."
"Appearance has a light straw color with a nice crisp head. Smell is lightly sweet with grains and hops. Taste of light honey, grainy, earthy with a good hop bite. Mouthfeel is light, crisp with carbonation that goes down smooth. A good crisp beer on a warm evening."
"3"" white head with very good retentionand light lacing. Straw gold with endless streams of carbonation. Sweet, hay, grassy hops, cracker, slight citrus all make up a great pilsner aroma. Sweet biscuity malt, herbal grassy hops and a light, lingering bitter finish. Somewhat thin in the mouthfeel but a dry crisp finish and good carbonation make up for it. Good drinkability...a session beer for golf, bbq, river."
"Nothing like what ends up on shelves and displays in Canada, fresh beer is the way to go."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a nice head that goes quickly.Smells of Hops and Grass. The taste is nice and refreshing starts a little hoppy and a slight bitterness ends smooth. The mouth feel is good and it is very drinkable I am on my second one right now! I nice German Pils at a nice price. Not my favorite but a nice German beer!"
"with nominal citric or malt flavors of any kind, but a decent beer to be had. Won't seek this out again, but wouldn't turn one down."
"Poured like translucent, liquid gold out of the 12 oz bottle. Nice, foamy 2-finger head sitting atop a really light, but nice looking brew. Smell had a slight sweet tinge to it. The taste was good; light in both flavor and color, malty sweetness, reminiscent of pale euro macros, yet better. Just a touch of hop bitterness came through towards the swallow. Overall, nice beer. Not a huge fan of pilseners, but this one tasted like it was made well. Refreshing and clean finish."
"A fine beer, this Bitburger in a can. Totally blows away any American macro attempt at a pils that might come in a can here in the States. I'm not so sure I would run out and grab a case of these for a saturday afternoon barbeque, but you never know. If the selection was limited.... A good summer pils, for anyone tubing down the river, or planning a camping trip."
"Overall - This was a good example (in my opinion) of a German pilsner beer. It looks like any other pils but its taste is more balanced than some. Its sweetness combined with its good drinkability makes for a great session beer. Good to have with a variety of foods, including steak/potatoes, pasta with light sauce, sausages, cheese, and pizza! Will buy again."
"Overall, I feel it's a really nice example of the style."
"D - Easily drinkable, with a nice pils character. I personally prefer more assertive examples of the style, but this is an overall solid pilsner that leaves little to complain about."
"This poured a light yellow with very little head. It smelled of mostly yeast with a little hops. It tasted mild with just a touch of hops bitterness, no malt, and slight yeast. The dominant flavor was light citrus. The texture was thin with fairly strong carbonation. Overall it was decent for a pilsner, but that's not saying much."
"Carbonation is on the heavy side considering the body is paper thin. Very refreshing and crisp, a superior alternative to any macro, infinitely drinkable."
"I think I've found a lager I can bring to the beach on a summer day, and that is Bitburger. The next time I'm there, I'm sure to ""bitte ein Bit""."
"Overall, a very drinkable (especially considering price, about $1.39 for 16 oz) pilsner from a can."
"A drinkable beer, never turn one down but never go out of your way to find one."
"D--An easy drinker and refreshing. Some of the character of more aggressive German Pilsners, but smooth and approachable. Sessionable for sure."
"O: A good beer to drink a few at the pub"
"Although it may not be a bad import, this falls pretty far down on a list of things that need to be tried."
"Gold pour, little head. Smell is light malt, hops and a touch of yeast. Crisp, refreshing, fairly light. A nice little bite, some breadiness, but not overdone. A good pilsner all around, and although a syle I'm not crazy about, I could definitely see getting this again at times."
"Drinkability - This was a really easy drinking beer, and easily sessionable at 4.8 ABV. I normally desire something with more punch as far as beer is concerned, but this would make a fantastic lawnmower beer, or a great beer on a hot day outside."
"Very easy to drink and I would encourage anyone that has had this in a bottle to try it against the can. It must handle the westward journey better in this 16.9oz can."
"It had been a long time since I'd had this, and it was better than I remembered. A nice and easy drinking beer, although nothing really special or distinguishable about it. It's what I'd call a good ""social"" beer."
"This beer poured a very clear golden/color with a thick head that quickly dissipated. The aroma is hoppy and somewhat grainy. The taste is cereal with some fruit/floral notes. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. Overall, this is a more flavorful brew than I had expected  changed my perspective on Pilsners."
"This is nearly spot on to what my idea of a good German pils should be.. In my opinion, though.. could use just a little more malt flavor and hop aroma."
"Poured a tallboy can into a Boulevard pint glass. Poured a clear straw with a frothy white head that left sticky lacing down the glass. Aroma is soft and grainy. Taste is what a lager a Budweiser could only aspire for. Slightly grainy with an earthy tone and leaves a slightly sugary taste on your lips. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. This is the perfect session beer. Yummy."
"This is a well balanced, easy to drink beer. I could drink several at one sitting without getting bored with it."
"Ok, it is warming up and I'm starting to find a little flavour. It is now a bit warmer than I would drink most pils, and the flavour is still light, but at least it is making an impression. Up a full point on taste if you allow it warming time."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, a good session beer for sure,I think I could probably drink these all night."
"rather pleased, i must say."
"Some bready malt and hop apparent, not overly strong, but there. Classic Euro pil taste, dry bready malt followed by some hop spiciness and a nicedry, bitter finish. Decent mouthfeel, maybe not as creamy as some pils, but still nice. Good example of the style."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. pours a crystal clear straw yellow with a 2 finger head, OK longevity and pretty good lace. Good strong pilsner aromas - honey, citrus and a bit of hop. Decent malt flavors mixed with a tad of honey, citrus and a decent hop bitterness. Its is definately not a big beer and if you have been drinking a bunch of Belgian ales this one will be watery, but as pilsners go it is of good quality and a good easy drinking beer."
"Pours a crystal clear straw with a white head that does not stay around long. Nose smells like a wet rat. Yes. I said that. Flavor is actually pretty sweet with a smooth tone to it overall. Feel is good. Nice level of carbonation. Slightly thin, but doesnt feel like it is totally watered down. Extremely drinkable. Easily a session brew. For what it is, quite a good brew."
"Another sample present in Michael Jackson's great beer book, copped a 12 oz bottle singly from Total Wine and More in West Orange... pours a typical pisener amber color with minimal head... smell is basically non-existent... very bland, taste was pretty good but overall, nothing to write home about... could easily confuse this with plenty of other beers... not much flavor, but a decent, drinkable taste nonetheless... slightly bready with a clear, crisp finish... worth a try, but wouldn't go out in search of this one... not bad..."
"This is a beer I drink once a week, I really have to say I thourghouly enjoy this one, it goes good with pizza or a strong Italian food or German food. Not bad by any means and I will always drink this one. Love this beer as long as everyone loves this beer the same way."
"pours a clear yellow golden color with little head, i haven't had this beer in ages, so it was like having it for the first time. the smell is pretty surprisingly complex for being a lager, has a light malty aroma to it as well as hops and a skunkiness to it. the taste is average, kinda bitter with sharp sting to it. mouth feel is watery and sub par, drink ability is average, not a great beer not a bad beer."
"12 oz. brown bottle, with ""BIT 07"" on the back. It pours a bright, crystal-clear, yellowed gold, with low carbonation and an inch of loose head. In the nose it's some sweetness, maybe some adjuncts, and a dash of hops. Similar on the palate, with sweet grains, green/spicy and lightly earthy hops that impart a mild bitterness, and some papery oxidation. The medium body is smooth and prickly, and leaves an almost medium finish - nice. Overall, it's an OK pils but needs some refinement, as it tastes a bit mass-produced."
"light bright golden with a white head that didn't stick around too long and didn't leave good lace. didn't look bad though. smell was funky, musty, stinky hops with some pils malt character. taste was the same. a little dry and a little bitter with a light mouthfeel. good for drinking when you're not up for much of a wild ride, but it seemed to me like a run of the mill, nothing special, but not bad pils lager type thing. i'm not dissing it because it isn't my style, it just isn't anything to write home about. ... update 8/11/08... just started noticing the 16.9 oz. cans. they are only $4.00 for a four pack here, and it's been a typical, humid dc summer. for some reason, the can tastes, smells and looks much better than my recollection of the bottles. highly reccomend the cans for anyone who wants light, dry, crisp, clean, yummy summer beer. my new go to hair of the dog/spent too much last night drinking hitachino and fantome/i can't believe this four pack is only four bucks beer. i'm bumping up my rating from low 3's to"
"D - Decent overall I suppose, it's certainy not a bad brew, just lacking any real flavor. I wouldn't seek another out, but I don't suppose I'd turn one down if offered. Take it or leave it here."
"Very smooth and pretty good. The slight sourness keeps this from getting 4.0's from me."
"a little astringent. Meh. Try it if you find it in a wall-of-beer situation."
"Notes: A good beer but Nothing to write home about."
"D:	A well crafted, easy to drink lager that would be a great session beer as well as one to enjoy slowly. I would definitely have another."
"Excellant beer for warm weather,actually very enjoyable for anytime."
"Drinkability: Unique for a couple of beers, I have never wanted much more than a couple of these. Reminded me of afternoons at Spangdahlem and Bitburg Air Bases."
"Thierry (16/10/2007)"
"D- A solid and easy-drinking German pilsener, easily in the session beer range, good in a pinch but nothing too outstanding."
"D: Fairly drinkable. I'm going to have to burp my way through it since it's so bubbly."
"Drinkability: Like I said, this is a great beer to introduce people who are used to some of the other more mass marketed drinks to. I can easily drink a couple of these no problems"
"This is my go to German session beer could drink this beer all day long. Great summer beer."
"Drinkability: Good refreshing summertime brew. Right on style for a pilsner."
"this is a clear straw yellow in color with a white head and lacing. nose is very understated, sweet biscuity malts are detected predominately along with some grassy/vegetal characteristics from the german hops. nice light malt sweetness is well-balanced by the supporting hops. light and crisp mouthfeel. clean finish. not too bad as this is sold at a price that is competetive with bmc, and also it is in a can (would like more imports to be canned), to prevent skunking."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer is light bodied and goes down quite easy. This brew would make a nice session beer. Carbonation seems a bit low, considering that this style is a lighter styled beer. The finish is dry. Alcohol is slightly noticeable as well. This beer, priced at $3.49 for four 16.9 oz cans is a steal. This is not a bad beer, but when in a crunch for dollars this beer really shines. This isn't a beer I'd seek out to buy again...well...unless I only had a few dollars. It goes down quite smooth and easy despite the slight metallic tang, and the cidery flavor. Because the price is so low on this brew I can't help but say that is is quite drinkable, one of the best ""bang for your bucks"" out there I'd say."
"It pours a very light golden color with a small white head. The aroma is very malty but with some hop aroma as well. The flavor is malty but with good balancing bitterness. There is some hop flavor at the back of the palette as well. The body is light and this is a good summer beer for someone who wants a beer with some flavor."
"D: Good, an easy drinking pils, nothing special, just a good tasty beer. A little expensive, but worth it if you want a good example of a Northern German pilsner."
"D: I felt the amount of carbonation was just right for a pils, there just wasn't enough character in its smell and taste to make it a stand out beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink this one, but I definitely wouldn't avoid it either."
"Poured into a pilsner glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a light clear gold, forming a minute head, with light spots of lace. The aroma isnt skunky like alot of German pilsners. Instead there is actually noticeable hop aroma. The taste is very crisp and clean, with the taste of light hops. Nothing complex, but good nonetheless. Smooth mouthfeel, and clean finish. This is what I consider to be a very drinkable lager. Overall, I actually enjoyed this beer. I tried a four pack of this beer in the 16oz. cans about a year ago, and had to force my way through them. This is way better than I remember. This is what I expect from a German pilsner."
" Overall I would say it was the perfect call for the day. Everyone enjoyed and it went well with all the food. Kept us entertained until it got darker and some of the big boys started coming out. Definatly a good summertime beer!"
"Overall: A very underwhelming Euro-lager. Its possible that mine was flat but frankly Im not willing to take another chance."
"Overall: Bitburger is a boring pilsener. No complexity, nothing special about the taste. It can be an acceptable place to begin a German beer try out but nothing else. Definitely not a great beer."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a rather small white head, not much lacing left on the glass. The smell is faint, slightly grainy, a very light grassy hop. The taste is a balance of honey malt, noble hop, pretty smooth but not distinctive. Perhaps too balanced. The feel is light and rather smooth, not crisp, for a Pils. A very servicable Pils, needs a bit more of a hop presense. Good not great."
"I had a can of this on a flight to Frankfurt today. It was poured into a glass, showing an extremely clear bright yellow color, white head. Looked unremarkable, hard to distinguish from any number of pilsners. The smell was kind of maltier than I expected, I thought a real pilsner would be more hoppy. A touch of light bitterness in the after-taste showed the hops were there though. I don't really recommend this beer, but it isn't totally bad. It's not a drain pour but not interesting enough to return to."
"Drinkability is wonderful. Even on a very hot race day it was extremely refresthing. This beer is a reason to drink beer. I'm grateful to my fellow beer advocates who recommended it."
"From my notes 5/30/2007 pours a three-finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Hoppy/grapefruit nose. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is balanced, late maltiness then slight lingering bitter aftertaste. 500ml glass on-tap (with meal) at Zum Domstein Restaurant Trier, Germany."
"Drinkability is very good, light and flavorful. A good beer, but I've had much better for the style."
"D- While there is absolutely nothing special about this beer, it's far better than most available pilsners out there... pick up a Pilsner Urquell if you want to do one better, but if it's not around... this is a refreshing summer beer, especially for the money. (and especially if you rent from kkipple and can grab one out of the fridge :-)"
"Bitburger is disappointing... for the money, spend a little more and get a Prima Pils, Trumer Pils or even a Pilsner Urquell. Just hard to justify buying this one. I'm now left wondering what to do with the other 11! Guess it's time for another party..."
"D: A solid german pils, can't go wrong if you are in the mood."
"I popped open the six I had bought and opened the first one into a glass and noticed the straw coloring and the foam which looked very inviting.It had a grassy scent. The taste was pretty average. This was one of those beers that I tried and dont have anything bad to say but I was expecting more out of it."
"Pours a nice clear golden color with a fluffy white head. The smell is grainy with a bit of herbal hints. The taste is rather grassy mixed with the grain and herbs found in the smell. A little bit of hops attempts to balance these flavors but it doesn't quite get there. The feel is lite on the tongue and the carbonation is done well. This is an easy brew to put down. Not too much to this one and it is very grassy, but good for a summer brew on a hot day."
"D- A refreshing beer, very drinkable, but there are better examples of the style out there."
"Glowing pale golden beer holds a few streams of carbonation. Fluffy white head pours tall, but fades quickly to a thin film that leaves a short ring of lace above the beer. Mild aroma of pungent herbal hops and light Pils sweetness. Lightly sweet and grassy flavor up front fades towards the end. A faint bitterness in the finish is a bit too little too late. Mouthfeel is light and crisp as it should be. It's a bit light on the hops all around, but otherwise it's fine."
"Served in its own unique light-brown bottle, with their trademark ""bitte ein bit"" logo on the bottle. A nice classic but simple looking bottle. It pours a very clear light yellow with a decent bone-white head at around 1 inch. The lacing is decent enough. The aroma is not huge, but it's not meant to be. Just balanced hits of lightly roasted grain, plenty of light German hopping. Extremely balanced and fresh tasting. The taste is one that makes you hungry before a meal and is a perfect summer quencher after working in the yard. Again, nothing over the top, nothing unique, just very balanced and extremely drinkable. Light hopping and plenty of grassy, clover tastes. This goes down exactly as a good pils should, and that is why I have rated it highly--with style in mind, not just personal taste. A classic German pils. And an excellent driving beer. Just kidding."
"This is a well-balanced German pilsener with nicely sweet bread quality to the malt and hops that provide a slightly bitter aftertaste. The carbonation was lively and the beer was medium-bodied with a slightly sticky finish that coated the palate. Highly quaffable, but a little indistinct."
"Overall not the best pilsner ive tasted but its worth a try."
"Not much to complain about here, mild but agreeable taste with a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is a little watery but this is easygoing and easy to quaff. This is light, summer's day fodder."
"A solid choice when you're in the mood for a Pilsener."
"Notes: Nostalgia may get the best of me here but as subjective as I can be this is a solid, refreshing well brewed beer. I remember it having a bit more depth and there was this drying charcoal presence that was delightfull. I still get some of that but its probably more a west coast palate change than anything they've done. Pick up a sixer."
"Overall a decent pilsner. I prefer other pils over this one, but I can easily drink Bitburger Premium Pils again."
"Tried this back to back with Perla. This one is definitely more bitter and have a bit more hops flavor. The aroma is more bready grains with tinge of grassy hops. Flavor is a little flat but still has some hops grassy/spicy flavor. A pretty nice pilsner, and in a brown bottle. I wish the czechs would pick up on this. Try this is you're into pilsners."
"Not bad, quite enjoyable. Similar to other mass-produced German Pilseners."
"pours a bright yellow color. The flavor is bitter and malty with a nice hoppy dryness in the end, which stays in the nice long lasting aftertaste, a good German pilsner. . Nice aftertaste. Thin fizzy head, that did not last long. Would drink again if given the opportunity."
"I'd like to try this fresh and bottles like this show why import purchases can be hit/miss."
"Doesn't totally suck, yet I can't really recommend it, unless your utmost criteria that it be yellow and watery."
"¡Salud!"
"bitberger is a light and refreshing pilsner that goes well with chicken, thai, spicy mexician, and seafood."
" Im gonna get more of these, I remember that a 12pack is around $12  good session stuff!"
"This reminds me more of a ""high end"" BMC lager than a European Pilsner. Poured to a light golden color, with thin white head that lingered shortly, and left little lacing. Both aroma and flavor were almost nil, and mouthfeel was somewhat flat. The only decent thing about this was the finish, which was actually thirst quenching, and made this a drinkable beer that would probably be a decent session beer...as long as it is served coId enough."
"D- One of the better easy drinking pale beers I've had. I tend to find pale golden lagers boring, but I enjoyed this one. A pleasant surprise."
"You can often find 8-packs of these in 16oz cans for crazy prices. I've seen them as low as $6. It's a STEAL at that price. That's a world-class pils at the price of Bud."
"Not having any more of this one."
""
"Drinkability-Classic pils. Very easy drinking, but complex enough (by pils standards) to be interesting. Very nice. A little mosre lingering and after-taste would have pushed this up into a 5, but very nice."
"An easy-drinking, classic pils. Drinks quickly, though a touch of soap does come through eventually. A good go-to beer for a summer refresher, to watch a game on tv while eating some munchies/bar food, or as an easy ""session"" brew."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and mildly zesty. I fear this beer was old because it was rather bland. I would like to try this one again, fresh."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. The appearance was not very impressive; while the deep gold body color was nice, there was no head at all. The beer had a sweet, malty smell, almost like honey. A sweet taste with a bitter aftertaste; still could taste a sense of honey that was a little too overbearing. A nice, light mouthfeel typical of a pilsner; nothing too overbearning. I believe it's a pretty drinkable beer; tastes ok and goes down light and smooth."
"this beer was kind of shitty in my opinion. I don't like watered down beers with little flavor. This beer's head was weak and faded incredibly fast. It had a typical pilsner smell, but it was faint. The mouthfeel was thin, but It was crisp. I could chug this beer, but would never look for it I actually wanted to enjoy myself."
"I now have a review hat trick with this beer (bottle, cans and on tap). The tap offering just nudges the others out!"
"Good bitterness with fresh, herbal undertones. Strong cereal tastes are tempered by a crisp mouthfeel. A slight lingering bitterness affects the ejoyment a bit but otherwise pretty solid. Although I don't enjoy this style, I do consistantly rank this towards the top of the genre. One I always come back to."
"Crystal clear on tap into a pils glass. Not much head, and it fell quickly to nothingness. Hoppy for a pils with lots of noble bitterness and little hop aroma. For a macro beer the hop bitterness was a welcome addition and very refreshing. Light body brought the hop bitterness forward, but I would have enjoyed more hop aroma to match the bitterness. Just the ticket for a hot day!"
"Cheers!"
"This is a good example of the style. I've had others I would probably favor over it, but it's tasty on the whole and an excellent beer to drink while watching my Tigers in post season play!"
"It's very drinkable and pairs well with almost all food, especially spicy dishes. This beer won't bowl you over with complexity, but it makes for a solid session or meal time brew. As I've said, the carbonation and overall character of Bitbuger seems better on-tap."
"Drinkability: I've had better ones. For my taste, its too sweet for a pilsner."
"Tried this beer at queen mary pub. this is definetly a flavorful german beer. the robust flavor and smooth taste i think were well blended. the smell and appearence are consistant with what you would expect from a beer of this genre. all in all a pretty good beer."
"Very nice pils, probably the best German pils I've had. Easy drinking and very cheap, but still a flavorful, high quality beverage."
"Drinkability - good tasting, easy drinking, and very sessionable."
"Overall a spectacular pils that I've never tasted any fresher than this offering. I believe this is key when reviewing such a delicate and dainty style. The dryness of this beer really captivated me. A basic but still very elegant. Great pils."
"This beer pours a clear golden with a frothy white head that holds nicely for a bit leaving some lace but eventually dissipates. The smell is sweet and malty, but quite mild. The taste is also mild, pale malt balanced with just enough bitterness to keep it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel has enough body and carbonation is decent. Overall, a good pils, not too much you can say bad about it, but it certainly doesnt overly impress."
"Ice cold, this is a great beer for the summer. Easy to drink and a better taste than American macros."
"All told, this is a decent pils that would benefit from a bit less bitter aftertaste and a bit more depth of character."
"Bright light gold with wonderful carbonation and a solid dollup of white cream. Aroma and flavor are rather on the sweet side of the German Pilsener style for me. I prefer quite a lot of dryness in my GPs that this beer lacks. Still, body is light and refreshing. Aroma is pleasing pilsner malts and spicy hops. This is in no way a bad beer, just not my style."
"Bitburger Premium Pils was golden in color. It had a medium size white head that dissapeared rather quickly, becoming only a thin ring, and leaving no lace behind. The smell was average with light malts followed by light hops. It had a light malt and hop flavor with a slightly bitter finish. This was a crisp and refreshing, medium to light bodied, easy drinking beer."
"Yellow appearance- small head with small bubbles- slight pineapple, and hop nose- sweet/sour taste  light creamy body  short refreshing aftertast Yellow appearance- small head with small bubbles- slight pineapple, and hop nose- sweet/sour taste  light creamy body  short refreshing aftertast Yellow appearance- small head with small bubbles- slight pineapple, and hop nose- sweet/sour taste  light creamy body  short refreshing aftertast Yellow appearance- small head with small bubbles- slight pineapple, and hop nose- sweet/sour taste  light creamy body  short refreshing aftertast"
"Easy drinking and tasty. No wonder the Germans hold it in such high esteem."
"Drinkability - Can be unexpectedly sweet on the finish, very light and fresh. could drink a few easily but perhaps not a classic refreshing bitter dry pils"
"Not a bad Pils for an industrial lager. I do remember this bit alot more hoppy in the past; all the same an improvement over other European competitors."
"I have tasted Bitburger in bottle & on tap in pre-BA times, and quite enjoyed it. So I hoped the 5 litre keg would be more than just a novelty. Unfortunately not."
"Years ago I visited the brewery and drank all over the town (of Bitburger) afterwards, still couldn't force myself to really enjoy it."
"D - It is a nice pilsner and very affordable, too."
"Poured from a large can. The appearence is that of an average pilsner. The smell is very hoppy. The taste is very good and refreshing. The beer starts with a very small amount malt followed by a wonderful, crisp, refreshing hops taste. This beer is very good with food or just as a good flavorful, but easy to drink session brew."
"Good for the German Pilsner style, and it's quite easy to have a few of these."
"I really don't know how this one passed the ""1516 purity law""??? The drinkability is good, as it is a terrific summer brew. Very light and crisp. Appearance is a bright yellow, overcarbonation, pours a little head but no retention. Very light taste, not much hoppiness..I guess true to style. Smell was the worst part. Extremely skunky, like other German macros. The style I don't care for(german/chek pilsners) but this one isn't even good for the style."
"Overall a typical german pilsner, much better than the BMC trio have done. Nice overall in both color and taste. Very drinkable."
"Bitburger, in my opinion, is an above average example of a German Pilsener. A good choice if you want something refreshing but with more character than a typical macro. Also a fine choice as an appetite stimulant before a meal. Worth trying if you haven't."
"It's actually quite thirst quenching and enjoyable....except for..yep...the corn. I like the hops used and they really do balance in the brew excellently. Perhaps the corn is a fluke in this bottle or my taster today. Other than that it's a very respectible summer brew."
"Da good session beer, I think. As I watch the Cup, these go down very easy."
"Overall: Quite clean, but not much happening with this beer  it only does a bit of everything. Much better German pils can be easily found out there  Beck's for one."
"Drinkability: Fellow BA Pepeton said I should give this a try since it was his favorite session beer and I get this beer anywhere. I could see why it would make for a nice session beer. It's affordable, decent, and it's everywhere. Maybe the appearance would've been better for me if I would've got this out of a can. If I see it in a can, I'll see if I can get a better appearance out of it."
""
"Drinkability: What this beer lacks in flavor it makes up in drinkability; refreshing and inoffensive with just enough flavor to make it worth drinking"
"Good example of a drinkable German pilsener."
"Maybe it should've been at a lower temperature or something, but this beer just didn't do it for me."
"This reminds me of a smother creamier American Light Lager with more flavor. It's not MUCH more flavor, as Bitburger is pretty non-invasive on the palatte. Looks like a bubbly field of hay. Smells a bit of wheat. Not much to the taste, just lightly sweet wheat. Not terribly bubbly and not much of an after taste at all. Very drinkable indeed. I could down one after another...but there's better, more interesting beers out there to be had."
"I was also disappointed that I could only find the beer in a 12 pack."
"Sweet, malty, doughy flavors with a clean dry finish."
"Smooth, would have liked it better cold."
"Bitburger is another great moderatly priced german beer. I purchased an 8 pack of tall boys and for 7.99. This has been one of the best buys in a long time. Bitburger is suprisingly very smooth with a very pleasent after taste. I highly recommend it."
"Overall: Clean and quenching. Nice balance and evolution of flavor. Isn't anything that I'd shy away from, but just doesn't leave its mark."
"The bottle was a plus, brown bottles too. I'm no pilsner fan, but I appreciate when a beer is true to style, and this is right there. On par with some craft pils without the a stronger hop flavor. This would be a good guest beer in my fridge."
"A straw colored pils that pours with an ample, slighty rocky head and bright, spicy hop aroma. A hop infused, light-bodied pils, that is fortified with a crisp, malt backbone. The finish is pretty bitter, but not overwhelmingly so, encouraging another sip. This is one of my favorite German pilsners, especially when fresh. Another reason that it can be found in my fridge is the price; I buy it in 4-packs of 500mL cans for $4."
"I'm not a big lager drinker, but I've had a few pilsners recently that are much more drinkable than this."
"Altogether, Bitburger Pils is a super enjoyable beer and one of the archetypes of the style. One of my favorites, it has dominated my personal beer paradigm for years. A beer for all seasons, the only better way to enjoy a serving of Bitburger Premium Pils, than from the 12 oz bottle, is to find it in the .5l can or to have it on draft in country."
"Drinkability: I can and have had a lot of Bitburger in a sitting. I prefer it on tap. This can may have been sitting around for a while. Generally I like this beer and will take it over most of the other widely available German pilseners."
"Pours a very light yellow with a thin head that is retained as a skim on top of the beer. Carbonation is evident, and the bubbles rising make it look kind of like ginger ale. Smells hoppy with a grainy tone. Tastes of floral hops with some alcohol and sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is thin, with a great deal of carbonation, but drinkability is pretty good. It's a pretty average pils, but not a terrible one."
"Opinion: This is a clean and well balanced beer. I believe that the bills are little too light for my taste, but that is OK for just a session beer. The balance is appropriate for this beer to make it go down easy. The finish is refreshing, and would do well on a hot summer day. I am a bit more partial to the Helles styles, but this is still a good beer."
"Can: Poured a golden color pils with a medium clear white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of floral malt with some grassy hops. Taste is quite refreshing with a nice sweet touch of malt and a floral hops ending. Definitely interesting for the style and something that always match well wit spicy food."
"Pours a straw yellow with a thin white head that doesnt retain well but nice carbonation rising to the top. The aroma is spicy noble hops, biscuit like malt and some light yeast character. The flavor also starts off with noble hops that are a bit bitter and spicy, as well as some biscuit and toasted bread malt flavors, light yeast character and hint of alcohol. I have a feeling that this beer would be better if it were fresh. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, this is definately a smooth drinker. A descent pilsner, could use a bit more oomph (maybe it has it when fresher)."
"D - Drinkable. I would not buy it again though. I guess I would recommend to other's if it is the only beer available."
"Overall, not bad. If given one, I would certainly take it and save it for the right occasion. It has certainly perked my interest to explore more pilseners."
"Man, have I been missing out. Looks superb in the glass, with a crystal clear golden color, small stark white head and champagne bubble carbonation. The nose is crispy bready malts and those German hops (I'm terrible at hop varieties...it's on my resolution list for '06). Taste is a pleasing dry sweet malt with a refreshing hop finish that is satisfyingly dry and finishes long. Mouthfeel is just fine for the style. This is what American macros should strive to be. There is nothing abusive about this (like a popular Czech pils we all know). It's biggest drawback for the typical macro drinker is that it has flavor. Bring some to a get together. It is reasonably priced and readily available."
"I am guessing the mango flavour is from the hops but the balance and blend is so good it all melds into a wonderful sharp and refreshing taste sensation."
"This is a decent enough all around German Pils. I'm not a huge fan of the style but sometimes it hits the spot. Very clean with a light malt profile and a nice hop bite in there. A semi dry finish which is free of off flavors and maintains that grassy hop flavor. Quite a nice hop aroma Malts are slightly grainy and earthy while the hops are predominantly grassy and herbal. It works well. After 2 of these though I was satisfied and really did not care for anymore. If this is Germany's macro then I'm jealous."
"A very staightforward, yet solid, pilsner. Its light-to-medium yellow in colour, with a good amount of carbonation and a floral hops nose. The best thing about this beer is whats missing: no skunk, no weird adjuncty flavors... just light malt, slightly bitter hops, and a clean finish. Simple and satisfying."
"Overall a great appearance. But contradicted itself with the smoothness of the moutfeel."
"a very nice beer for the style, very refreshing and tasty, i will buy this again."
"This one pours a pale yellow, straw color, which is very clear and very bubbly. The white head is thin, dissipates quickly, and leaves no lace. The smell is of lite malts and somewhat grainy. Smells like a pils, or, a macro brew. The taste is smooth at first and somewhat light. There is a small hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Pretty refreshing brew. Fairly typical of the style except in the hop area, as it is fairly lightweight."
"¡Salud!"
"An underrated German classic here. Extremely drinkable, and ideal for a session. Attractively priced."
"A good find and I'll be sure to try it again when the pickings get thin at the local LCBO."
"A real and good german draft beer; more than american´s; this beer give much in its taste, clear, soft, sweet; smell like flowers, perfumed; good for all mexican food, try with chinese cuisine; serve in a pint glass for more enjoying; 95% recommended."
"Very crisp, clean flavor, nice balance. Decent maltiness. I drank this right after Allgaur's Buble, and this is a very different beer even though they are the same style- this is much more clean and processed, good for what it is, but it raises my appreciation of the other beer."
"The color is shiny straw with lost of carbonation. Head is a bit on the small side. The aroma is an inviting sweet grain. The taste is a moderately sweet grainy malt with hints of doughy flavor. Didn't notice much hop flavor. The finish is crisp and dry. Great drinkability. This is an choice beer to have in the fridge for when your mood dictates a lighter style beer."
"This is good beer. The pour had a nice frothy head that lingered for a while, has no skunky smell to speak of. Taste is mildly bitter like most pilseners but has a smooth flavor of hops. The mouthfeel is not offensive at all, this is a nice drinkable beer that goes well with heavy food like sausages and burgers. I'll be sure to keep a good supply of this in the fridge in lieu of the cliche Macros."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not a good beer either. Not one I'd rush out to ever buy."
"Mouthfeel and body were both light and crisp. Not much sweetness - that might have helped with the rough bitterness."
"Flavor was very smooth with a crisp bite of hop bitterness in the end. Great beer!"
"We sure have a lot of 500ml euro lagers in our liqour stores and I must say that this is one of the better ones. Straw yellow with a big head, this beer has a good fresh hop smell. The taste is full and crisp with good hops on the follow through. Well made and well balanced."
"Pours a very pale straw yellow, with a white fluffy head that fades away pretty quickly to a thin layer. Smelled strongly skunky at first, after a few seconds only really smelled like hops with some yeast, pretty pleasant. Taste is slightly sweet with some hop bite, just enough to finish clean and a little extra. Good mouthfeel, nice and creamy. All in all, I like it, but it's not something I'd drink all the time. Would be good with a nice bratwurst."
"Served on tap into a liter glass. Clear golden complexion, nice head. Hoppy, slightly floral aroma. Quite pleasent. Taste was crisp, somewhat hoppy and very ""cleansing"" in the finish. This is a great beer to have after having some malt monsters. Nice hop bitterness in the end. Average to above average mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer."
"I enjoyed this immensly and will not hesitate to purchase again. It proudly states ""Germany's #1 beer"" on the can. If the #1 beer in the US had the same personality, I would have no complaints."
"Not necessarily a bad beer, but certainly nothing spectacular about it. After reading some of the other reviews, it probably tastes better when its fresh and not bought in the bottle in the U.S."
"Also at around $2 for a 500ml bottle it's a pretty good value too."
"Overall-I'm becoming very impressed with these true German pilsner types, much better than their dubbed down commercialized American examples. Another good example here."
"Clean and crisp with a solid, moderate carbonation and smooth creamy body beneath it all. As it stands, this is probably the best alternative to the standard, American fizzy yellow beer, but it is far from it in terms of quality. Highly quaffable, sold build, difficult to go wrong."
"Pours a very pale,straw yellow color. Low aroma-cross between yeast and a touch of sulfur. Good malty flavor-nice touch of bitterness. Discernable trace of sweetness in the finish. Nice body for the style-holds up well. A very drinkable beer and quite enjoyable. This comes a cross much better then say Beck or St Pauli Girl. I find they have to much of the ""wang"" flavor you find in the German imports. Worth a try indeed."
"An excellent session beer. Tastier than a Stella Artois."
"I had this one on tap at Great American Ballpark and considering every other booth in the park was bud light I was very happy to be drinking this. That said it's no great shakes. It's a fairly typical euro pils. There is some of that northern German bitter hops and a lingering straw or dried grass note. The head was nice thick and sticky though and the aroma was interesting once you got past the dried grass notes. It was gone in a flash and I moved happily on to the Christian Moerlein and then dove into the Erdinger. That review is coming up."
"Crisp, refreshing and easily drinkable."
"If not for the inevitable alcohol poisoning, I could drink a keg of this stuff."
"Drinkability: Maybe I'll be this onr again if I'm planning on drinking many beers while outside on a hot day, but overall, this one just doesn't do it for me."
"A bit watery texture but easy to drink. Decent summertime/outdoor beer."
"Nothing really impressed me about this pilsner, especially since one of the last one I had to reference was victory prima Pils, which by the way was excellent. Too straw color and too bitter for the style. Avergae carbonation, no lacing. Reminds me of a standard Euro lager than anything else. Still wouldn't be too bad after a hot day."
"Nothing special going on here. The malt quality is high and comes through but the hop aroma and taste is relatively understated. Some will like that, some will not including me. Not as well constructed as the American versions available in bottles (Prima Pils, Casco Bay). It is easy to drink and not unpleasant (like Heineken) but nothing I will buy again."
"Drinkability: Very high. This is one of those beers where you say I'll just have one, and before you know it the whole 6-pack is gone and you have to get another ""one""."
"Which is why its so shockingly good. This is what schwill beer should taste like."
"A Solid Pils."
"500 ml can from LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Purchased 10/4 reviewed 11/04. medium bright gold pour with a small white head and light carbonation ( low for style). Nose reveals some malt, very light, and some neutral yeastiness. Flavor starts crisp and malty and then hops come into play. Slightly syrupy in tail end of the flavor and into the finish. May have been old at time of purchase."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a nice white head that hangs out for a while. The aroma is a little citrus along with a nice hop aroma. I think this is Germany's version of a belgian beer. It has everything a pilsner should have with a little extra in that it seems to have a little bit of a sweetness as well as a little bit of citrus to it. I like this beer a lot. There is a nice hop presence in this beer as well. The mouthfeel is great. Overall it would say this is one of the most drinkable beers I have tasted. I would definately recommend this one to anyone."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a creamy white head that hangs around quite well. Lots of visible carbonation. Smells of citrus and herbal hops. The taste is rather unimpressive. Some herbal hoppy bitterness through the entire sip and aftertaste. Nothing else. Very simple beer. Mouthfeel is medium with nice carbonation. Notes: It is easy for me to see why this beer is to Germany what the big three are to America. It doesn't have much flavor, but is easy to drink."
"Hefty hop bitterness, but not without a few malts. Much stronger than many of the domestic pilsners I've become used to. A very common style, done well. Can't go wrong here."
"Clear gold color, with a nice fluffy white head. Carbonation is going crazy, sticking to the sides of the glass, and making it's way to the tip. Nice looking beer. Smell is light crisp malt, grassy in nature. Taste is big on malt and metallic flavors, pretty standard fare for a German Pilsner. Hops could be more prominant, grassy malt more subtle. Not a bad beer, just extremely average."
"Pours a clear pale straw colour with a stark white 2 finger head. Picture a text book German Lager and you have this. Smell is a bit of malt and spice, but nothing jumps out too much. Taste is crisp with enough malt backbone to balance the drying hops that approach in the middle and allow this to finish bone-dry. I did notice a some what mettalic bite, but i tend to notice that with a lot of pilsners. Mouthfeel is good and smoother than I had thought it would be. Drinkability is a little above average as it would make a good, but not great hot weather beer. Overall a little better than I had expected it would be."
"Pale yellow with a thin white head. Smells zesty with hint of lemon. Soft grains and faint sweet malts. Meduim light body with a decent amount of carbonation. Taste is a faint hoppy bitterness up front and then is followed by some grassy grain. Goes down well with any heavy meal. This is and average pilsner beer. The flavor is not a strong as I would like. It is worth a try."
"Pours a cleay light yellow. Not too light colored. Lots of bubbles coming from the bottom. Great thick white pillow-like head. Good retention, and lacing. Grassy notes, along with pale malty aroma. Light flavored malt, complimented with grassy, spicy German hops. Light body, high carbonation. This was very drinakble. I would have enjoyed a bit more malt flavor but this seems to be a pretty decent beer."
"This is a very simple beer; a workingmans Bavarian."
"On tap at The Abbey in Seal Beach. Served in a 20 oz mug bearing the Bitburger logo. Nice white head that stayed pretty well. Smell is clean malts and a hint of hops. Beer tastes smooth and refreshing, with a nice bitter finish. Very drinkable, and a nice crisp flavor. Light to medium bodied but very nice carbonation fits the style well. Very enjoyable with my meal."
"Clear, bright yellow straw with a medium-sized, cotton-white head. Looks to be well carbonated. Light malt aroma--honeyed bread, pungeant, vegetal minty hop smack. Light skunk. Taste is dry cardboard-tinged, grainy malts up front. I think this would be much better fresh, say in Germany. Considerable noble hop bite. Almost Saaz-y in it's snappy sea air bitterness. Finish is bitter, with traces of bready malt. Again, I would like to try this fresh. Light bodied, with a lively, dry feel. Refreshing."
"Drinkable, but on the low end of hop presence, for a German pils. Resembles a Helles more."
"Very nicely gifted to me by my workbud, Dennis, who gave up this single bottle carried over from Germany from his friend. This is his favorite, but he knows I am a beergeek, so this was lovingly carried in to me in an icepacked cooler for my enjoyment. Good friends!"
"This beer pours nicely with swirling bubbles and a foamy head. Unfortunetly the head disappears quickly and everything goes downhill from there. Not what I expected from a German pils. Hops are present, but more fruity than bitter to me. Flavor is too typical of a imported German beer (Warsteiner, etc.) -- sort of a lemony, wheat grass. I have been to Germany twice and none of the beer I had there (which were many) tasted like the stuff we get imported. For a better example of a German pils, check out Paulaner."
"A very good German beer, but not the best. Very clean and crisp from the first to the last sip. I believe that the beer could use a little improvement on the appearance and smell. One thing that makes a good pils stand out is the first smell of the special hops that are used"
"Light and refreshing, Bitburger Premium Beer goes down smoothly and has a pleasant bitter hops aftertaste sure to go well with most foods."
"overall, a very well made, full flavored lager. nothing particularly remarkeable, but far from disappointing."
"Drinkability  This is a mediocre excuse for a German Pils."
"Pours a bright gold color with a pure white head that leaves good lace. Head retention is very good. The aroma is mellow, of cracker-like pilsner malts, German noble hops, and a little bit of bitterness. The taste is of floral, spicy, grassy hops and a malt character reminiscent of Ryvita crackers. Hop bitterness and some metallic notes enter in the finish. The mouthfeel is quite full bodied for a pilsner with smooth thick carbonation. The aftertaste is pleasantly hoppy. This is a very good pilsner, its definitely hoppier than Pilsner Urquell."
"This beer pours a typical pilsener yellow, not much different than a American macro-pilsener. There is little to no head and sporadic lacing. It is pretty average for a macro German pils, but it is a decent warm summer day session beer. It is a hoppier version of Warsteiner Premium in my opinion. I am still trying to find a German Pilsener that blows me away."
"On tap poured into a Bitburger mug. It pours a light gold color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The small is malty and grassy, slightly floral. Classic pils smell without any skunkiness, but is just a little light on the nose. The taste is also grassy, with a good malt background. It has a great hop finish, very crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is just a little light and watery. The drinkability is through the roof though. A nice pils that brings me back to my trip to Germany when I was 16."
"Do not overchill this beer and you will be rewarded with a good glimpse into how enjoyable a German Pilsner can be."
"Had this beer on tap at the Toronado in September of 2004. Well, I was expecting a clone of Radenberger, but this fell far shot of it. I may need to re-review this one because I had it immediately after a flemish sour beer. Maybe my taste buds were shot at this point. Anyway, it was a very pale yellow color, left little or no head and next to no lace. Smelled very outdoorsy, like grass or maybe hay or something. Extremely light on the carbonation. It felt like I was drinking a cask conditioned beer, but it wasn't. Very flat and watery with very little aftertaste. Very disappointed in this one. Could have been a bad sample or my taste buds though. May try again sometime."
"I picked this up at what I felt to be a fair price for eight, pint plus cans. It poured a nice looking gold with a good size white head that stuck around awhile. Some lace to be had but faded. The aroma seemed of same old can mixed with grass and sulpher. The taste also carried the grassy grain, some sweet malt and lastly a crisp hop bitterness at the finish. The mouth is left tart and dry. Over-all not a bad beer to have on hand. Its easy to drink, macro friendly, while at a price and volume to do the job either with a meal or on its own."
"A very drinkable beer, but not a true pills in my book!"
"Overall Bitburger is a good beer, easy to drink, refreshing, definately something I would buy if i wanted to drink several in one sitting."
"This is one sleeper pilsner on this side of the drink. This beer is well put together and a good rendition of the traditional mellowed, dry finish, medium bodied pilsners from northern Germany. Pours a very pale yellow...clear with some particulate in it...a white chunky cap reduces to a nice lace quickly as the effervescence dies down. The nose is very aromatic without being overpowering...Tattenag hop tang with a more herbal bouquet and some nice light biscuit malt notes. Starts very mellow then builds to a light silky body permeated with a good balance of hop tang and malt presence then the finish is the best part of this pil...it goes into a lovely dry clean finish where the herbal tones are departed then a lingering metallic twang of the Tattenags remains."
"Fairly average pils, but still, refreshing and crisp"
"Overall a standard characterless pilsner."
"This beer settles into your glass with a clear yellow-gold color with a middling-thin head that tends to last. Its smell is sweet, soft, and something like generic citrus. Bitburger starts sharp and smooth. It is full-bodied with caramel, sugar, and white grape flavors. This beer has a metallic aftertaste that gets stuck on your tongue and is tough to escape."
"Nice looking pilsener: Pale, crystal-clear gold color with a medium bright white head and fine carbonation streams racing for the surface. Smell is mild, mostly malty. Taste is grainy malt, not very hoppy, with a clean, dry finish. Nice mouthfeel, very drinkable. Most macro drinkers would probably not mind drinking this, even though it's more flavorful and a better made beer!"
"Basically, this is a standard German pils with a little more diacetyl than expected. This special tone is dangerously close to a skunk beer, way beyond the best before date."
"Bitburger Premium Pils is definitely better than most American macro lagers, but that doesn't mean that it's good. It'd be a decent choice on a hot day, but I doubt that I'd crack one open if any halfway decent beer was available."
"Wow. This beer was highly recommended to me by a full-fledged German at work (who got deported 2 weeks ago...Visa issues). I think I must have gotten some from a bad batch. Smell was OK, which caused me to look forward to the first swig. Taste was strong, but resembled my last bacteria-infected batch of homebrew. I did not like it. It was almost chewy, like it had some bread in it, and this just didn't feel right to me. I could not finish a whole beer."
"If anyone is expecting any exceptional tastes from this sort of ""premium"" fallacy, they've chosen the wrong beer. This one, as most of the european macro pils counterparts, follows a basic pattern of ""yellow/golden translucid pour with small white head", and much of the smell and taste unamazingly are way too metallic for my belgian loving palate. This beer is, in fact, one of the strongest tasting in that domain which actually becomes repulsive. 'nuff said."
"The beer is reasonably drinkable, but I'd probably not want something quite as bitter after a couple. It isn't bad for it's style but not something I'd want to seek out too much."
"Last Friday, it poured a clear yellow with a modest white head. There's a nice spicy aroma. The initial taste is a hop bite unlike most other beers I've tried. Metallic? Not really unpleasant though, just different. Feels different. The bitterness gives way to a clean light malt flavor. The beer ends with a very dry finish. Light to medium body. Actually a very well done pilsener."

"Overall Impression: This was one of the beers I cut my teeth on about 20 years ago when I lived in Germany. I really never had one once I got back to the states, and since I’ve been getting into better beers, I’ve avoided this one because I considered it sort of the “Coors of Germany”. I only picked this one up to review for another beer karma point and didn’t expect much from it. I’m cheerfully surprised. This is a light beer, but it has enough malt to give a rich taste, and enough hops to keep it lively and balanced. Can’t call it complex, and given all the extreme beers I’ve been drinking of late, this is a little brother by comparison, but this brother held his own. I’m going to pick up a six-pack of this when it starts warming up, it should make a great summer “cold one”. Recommended: especially for meeting your Coors drinking friends half-way."
"USAF Europe, Supporting the German Beer Industry for more than 50 Years! ;)"
"This beer might be considered bland by some, but for me it is a well made German pils that adequately serves its purpose as a thirst quenching beverage. A very quaffable beverage indeed, and I wouldn't mind having this with some beef rouladen or some other German food. Without sounding too cliched, this is simple yet effective."
"Another LCBO steal at about a dollar something American, 500ml tall can. Appearance: Golden straw color white vibrant head lace is ample spread evenly, not bad at all. Aroma: Sweet grainy 2 row base malts with a mild dose of German hops biting around the edges very balanced comes to me as unoffensive but decently flavorful. Taste: Solid all grain German pils with the alcohol blended within a uniform flavor, the hops are the bite or zing in the finish that make this beer worth my time. Mouthfeel: Creamy texture light body not the worst, pretty solid for an accessible German pils. Drinkability: A good go to for watching football games, can't complain solid nothing spectacular but good."
"Pale yellow, almost limpid. Small white head with fine lacing, but it leaves very fast and completely. Grassy/herbal aroma. As it enters the mouth, the malt is there and fades for nice bitter hops. Very dry finish. Under average medium mouthfeel. Tremendous balance overall and pretty cheap here at 7.99 for a six-pack. Good pick"
"Just another Pils. There are so many and they all look and taste just the same. But.. on the positive side at least it's not sickly or sweet like (for example) Oranjeboom, you CAN smell the hops just about, and it's a nice colour. Nothing special, but worth a sip if there is nothing else takes your fancy."
"In summary, this was an okay brew--no harm, no foul. An innocent beer that would offend very few."
"A nice appearance with lasting creme. Ok smell. But that's the end of this. Metalic in can taste. Strong carbonation and water. The type of beer you expect in the summer at a soccer game. Appreciation to the marketing rep who bought me a can to review in Toronro."
"Pours a beautiful pale gold color which produces a thick white head in my fluted glass. The aroma is of grain and a faint hoppy spiciness. A mellow grain sweetness is in the taste as well as a sharp bitterness in the finish. It has a very light body, and is well carbonated. A very clean beer that is straight forward and to the point. Not a bad pils, perhaps missing that special something, but it is quite serviceable."
"The beer pours a light gold color with a spotty lace head. The aroma is weak. It has a weak hop and malt aroma. It also has a grainy scent to it that compliments the usual lager smell. The taste is dry and a bit skunky. It has pale malt flavor that finishes a bit grainy. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is not that good. It's one and done for me."
"I'm not a fan of the pilsner which is probably why I didn't think to highly of this beer. It pour like a fresh beer that generated some descent foam but that didn't last. The color of the beer was ""fizzy yellow"" and didn't seem that appealing. The tast was very suble and finished with a bitter after taste. As the beer warmed, the bitter after taste grew more and more bitter. I think one was enough."
"Pours a crisp, clear golden yellow. Very little head, lace is moderate and lots of carbonation bubbles racing for the top. Aroma is hop dominated, citurs and resins with moderate amount of pale malt. Taste is very vacant on the front 1/2, very light and watery, then bitter, acrid taste on the finish. Just not pulled off very well."
"Pours a pale yellow with a pretty big, foamy head. Not much on the nose at all, maybe just a hint of astringency. Floral, slightly bitter hoppiness (Hallertau?) on the tongue at first, developing into a more pronounced, lingering bitterness. Finishes crisp and dry. OK, but I guess I may have a categorical dislike for German pilsners. I prefer it to Jever, but I think Pilsner Urquell has this one beat hands down."
"Drinkability: You can pound this beer due too it's light body, but there's better pils out there"
"a top beer to drink with food or if youre in for a long night of watching sport or partying, bitburger will satisfy any thirst. there are more complex tasting lagers around, but few refresh like this one. a rung or two below the very best but still holds its own."
"Closest thing Ive had to an American macro offering since Ive been here."
"Thx"
"Pours a lighter golden color witha pretty nice blooming head that stays pretty well,a light grainy aroma with a light iron-like tinge to it.This beer has a sharp hop edge to it ecspecially in the finish there is a malt bready backbone with a iron flavor in there as well but the bitter finish is the main thing I get from this beer.A quaffer for sure something to drink when u want flavor and quanity."
"This beer is crisp and light. Very airy. An easy drinker it could be consumed in mass quantities. Nothing special comes to the forefront. This beer is so mild and plain there is not much else to write about."
"I got this on tap at a Jamaican-themed bar in central Moscow. It came out (in a Carlsberg glass) clear gold under a marvelous three-fingered contoured ivory head that settles very slowly into cliffs of foam clinging to the side of the glass. Now THAT's what a German pils should look like! The nose was very mild, mainly of malt, but with a touch of hoppy flowers in the background. The mouth was light, but not as carbonated as I would have expected. The opening is pleasant, featuring mainly light malt. The finish brings out the distinctive German hoppy bitterness that leaves a nice crisp aftertaste. Definitely a session beer - I'll have another, and another, and another and..."
"Notes: Not too much going on here. A decent hoppy pilsner. Paired well with a smoked meat and saurkraut sandwhich."
"Light golden yellow with a fluttered for about 30 seconds then champagne like bubbles crept up to form a few patches of lace. Smells of husky grain, earthiness, and slight almost transparent sweetness. Taste almost is of slight sweet malt twinge then completely balances out with slight hop burp. Mouthful is thin but overall this beer is rather drinkable, good for session."
"over a year later i have grown to like this beer alot. it is a great beer for the money."
"I'm not really going to get into tastes and smells and all that. We've all had a German lager or knockoffs of the style. I like this one."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Not one of my favorite styles but I can see how this beer could be a all-day beer. A decent example of the style."
"Notes: I'm not a big fan of German Pilseners; all things considered, however, still found this to be surprisingly enjoyable."
"Not my style of choice, but if I'm lookin' for something to drink after spending a whole day out on the lake, or working in the yard, I could easily drink this. Not bad."
"Had this on tap at the local pub and it was poured in some really cool wheat-beer glasses (extra tall and vase shaped). Poured a yellow color with a medium head that died off slowly. The aroma was a little grainy and wheaty with some malts present. The flavor was very Pilsner-like with some wheats apparent as well. Drinkability is much better off the tap than from the bottle and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth."
"Overall, a good pilsener I look forward to having again. When I think German Pilsener, this will now be the beer that comes to mind."
"Drinkability - lesson learned. I'll avoid bottles, the canned Bitburger is more immune to the effects of shipping, storage, etc. The bottles have some of the same quality of the cans, but skunk is something I really dislike."
"pours out a lemon yellow sunny colour with wheat straw tones. very small and limited white head, leaving the slightest rings of lace. clean and ""pilsy"" aroma...a floral hoppiness aroma rises from the glass....quite inviting. light pils maltiness in the taste; quite hopped up and tasty. crisp and clean refreshing with a somewhat dryish finsh. the mouthfeel comes off as slightly watery, but appropriate for the style. i could see europeans slamming pitchers of these as we americans slam pitchers of budweiser after work. it's just bitburger is a hell of a lot tastier. this german pils is highly drinkable and extremely rewarding. a nice pilsener."
"No big issues. A little too unpleasantly bitter for my taste, but good basic pils and drinkable for style."
"This beer poured a very pale golden yellow color with a large foamy head and plenty of carbonation. A definite beer of quality here. Pleasing grassy aroma along with some graininess. This beer has just about everything I need in a Pils. Very drinkable with a clean finish. Excellent."
"I can (and have) drink a bunch of these in one sitting. In fact, the one I just reviewed was left over from my day of racing at Bristol Motor Speedway. I brought 2 eight packs of 500ml cans (one for each race) and came home with one can. Hell yeah, it's drinkable."
"Light gold color, small head. Aroma is malty. A light bodied pilsner. Malty and hoppy. There are some herbal tones going on here as well. Light tasting, smooth and refreshing. Hey, it is a lager after all. Nice drinking beer. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and dry, Aftertaste is slightly bitter and somewhat herbal."
"A fantastic beer and one of the best pilsners in the world, if not the best. Clear pale gold with large poufy head that leaves lace. Delicate aroma of spicy hops. A supremely appetizing beer. It is delicate but not weak, light but not insipid. The epitome of balance. If you don't like this beer then you don't like beer. I'm actually surprised that this beer isn't better reviewed; I guess most users on this site prefer bigger beers. Well this beer may be light but it is not bland. If you're still in doubt, pick up a fresh six of this and discover why pilsner is the most popular style of beer in the world."
"This Pilsener poured a small white head and there was some lacing observed on the sides of my glass. The hue of this beer was pale yellow and there was carbonation observed. It had a hoppy nose to it and it was very bitter tasting and it had a lingering aftertaste to it as well."
"This was a nice, inoffensive pilsener. Gold colored with a nice, white head. Smelled of sweet malt and floral hops. Tasted pretty much as it smelled, with just enough hops to give it a nice, crisp citrusy finish without creating any bitterness. All in all, a nice pilsener, not a terribly complex beer but perfect for a hot day."
"I found this beer on the menu at a typical chain restaraunt, and certainly was an interesting find. Although certainly not a classic, it stood out as unique amongst all the other typical selections, and certainly something I'd have again if I went there another time."
"Mid-weight in the mouth, with a good round maltiness. The hops kick in on the mid-palate and don't let go until the very end of a long, long finish. Great bitterness, and spicy hop flavor, while still maintaining its balance. A refreshing level of carbonation keeps it all in check."
"Drinkablility: A little light for my liking. But still a decent pils."
"Clear bright yellow-gold body with a steady stream of bubbles, topped by a foamy, tight white head three fingers high. Good lacing. Nose is mostly hay/fresh cut grass. Firmer bodied than I expected. Nice full mouthfeel. Taste is extraordinarily balanced, a bit of malt up front, a hint of hops at the end. Could have used a little more hop bite. Extremely clean. A notch above both Bud and Becks."
"Found in a 500ml white can, with about 10 different languages on the can. This stuff gets around! And it should too, it's pretty good, although nothing overtly remarkable. Good head that fades fast, clear straw colour, a touch of malt and hops on the nose, and a decently balanced flavour. It's very drinkable, goes down very smooth, great hot weather beer. Another notch in bringing me over to the pils style."
"This draft brew from the GermanFest in Fort Wayne, IN poured a thin straw yellow carbonated body and a very small head (once again, it was served to us and may have bee poured off). It had a very mild malt aroma and hoppy flavor. It had an initially small hop bite to it that smoothed in its finish along with leaving an excellent lacing."
"This delightful Pils pours a bright golden color with a sturdy white head and nice trails of webbed lace. A very nice floral hop aroma with a fading sweet malt fragrance. The full lightly roasted malt is rounded and lightly sweet. A bright and edgy citrusy and spicy hop flavor rules the glass. Hoppy, but not overly bitter and becoming very balanced as the glass is emptied. Worth having another! Pleasant aftertaste."
"Tasted very crisp, clean with a lightly lemon sweetness and toasted pils malt. FInishes with a slight hoppy spice finish."
"Very drinkable lager beer IMHO..good summer beer..and i got it at a reasonable price $5.69 a sixer"
"A lightly sweet body soon replaced by clean, crisp hops developing a dry bitterness. A classic pilsener, but its soft, laid back nature is lost on me. It's enjoyable, and the clean, crispness is pleasing... but.... a refreshing drink is all I see here."
"Color is a clear, light yellow, soory but it looks like pee. Poured with a favorable large head, white and foamy with some divets and was about three fingers high, lots of retention, and created patchy lace. Smells faintly of sweet malt and hops, very clean, but somewhat plastic-like with a thin earthy hint. Taste is evenly distributed between a slightly sweet malt and a dry hop. Feel is firm but light and watery, clean, and soft with a drying feel throughout the finish and slightly bitter sweet. Its quite drinkable, but left a little empty, easy drinkin' for sure."
"Delightful appearance on the pour with the brew having a nice light gold look with a beautiful off-white, foamy head. Unfortunately the beer produced no discernible lacing and quickly lost its head. The smell had a distinctly hop overtone above the malt base. The taste was nicely bitter and carbonation created a certain crispness to the mouthfeel. Slightly astringent in the finish."
"F."
"This is an exceptional pilsner. Pours a golden/straw yellow color with a medium sized, bubbly head. The glass is full of carbonation. The aromas of citrus and light malt give way to an abound of floral hops. Taste is crisp and refreshing, matching the aromas very well. Just give me some bratwurst, warm potato salad, and a Bitburger and Im in heaven."
"Notes: Claims to be Germany's #1 draft beer.....unfortunately I am drinking it from a bottle. This is not offensive, but it is also not highly recomended either. Rather, it is a decent example of the style, but not an exceptional one. I could buy this agian, and would not mind drinking it at all, but alas, I probably won't."
"I had this on tap and I was very impressed by the huge creamy head (especially since the place I got it from tends to pour carefully or something since you rarely get much head on the beer. Nice mouthfeel that matched the creaminess of the head. Very reserved on the hops, but well balanced and refreshing. Had a slight bubblegumminess that gave it a little complexity."
"Pale gold, nice hue; actively effervescent yet little head development, smallish-white, bubbly, poor retention, surprisingly little/no lace. Cleanish nose, a kiss of sweet malt, notes of hay. Soft yet grainy palate, mildly bitter, shades of sweetness, minor malt backbone. Decent mouthfeel, just enough carbonation, drinkable. Finish is clean, crisp, a little lingering sweetness. I cant say I will bother with this one again; there are much better Pilseners Bitburger is right around average."
"Draft - I had the chance to try this one again but on draft at the Flying Saucer. And of course it seemed a bit better. Smoother texture and feel. The taste is a bit more balanced for lack of a better term. And I sucked it down so damn fast. Man i really like this beer."
"The beer is a light golden color, which would be fine if not for comparison of domestic ""pilsner"" hues. It has a stronger bitterness than american pilsners, but its still subdued compared to many German and Czech pilsners. The body of the beer is very light, and its not a filling beer. However, once the food arived, the beer played well as sausage washer-downer. Though I really like pilsners, this is not one I'd make a habit out of buying."
"Very light, clear, straw color. A large white head quickly dissipates to a lace. The aroma is simply hoppy. The taste is simply refreshing, with a zingy carbonation. The finish is a little dry and hoppy and doesn't last very long. This is a wonderful session beer. I think I might have found a great beer for all day Nascar purposes. I'm freezing right now, but I know this beer will come in handy when it's 90 degrees."
"This is an excellent pilsner. Number three on my list, only behind Konig and Pilsner Urquell. Just as crisp and refreshing as both of those, but a little lighter in taste and body. Pours a beautiful, golden sparkling glass of beer. Nice head, decent retention. Hoppy, grassy taste and smell. Very clean, top quality. This is what the ""big three"" should be making!"
"Drinkability: I gave it a five. I can drink this all day. If I see it on tap, I will."
"Pours a very clear, bright yellow sunshine tone, with a thick frothy head. No collar forms on this and the lacing is minimal, but that's to be expected with this style. Certainly an enjoyable brew and I can sense this one being popular sitting on the sundeck come spring and summer."
"Bought this beer because I was going to be hanging with macro drinkers and wanted to keep the pace. It is the typical yellow color which is neither a plus or minus, there was little head and average carbonation. The smell was more malty than anything, with few distinctive tones. The taste was lager - just average, slighly watered down with some malt, little hoppiness. I am not a great fan of lagers, but this is better than most."
"Clear straw color with a big fluffy head that spirals down to delicate lace but keeps a 1/8 inch layer in a Pilsner glass as well. Very faint hoppy and peppery aroma. Plenty of carbonation is noticeable early, works with the subtle malt to give a dry impression. Some sense of toasted biscuit mid mouth. Finishes softly, less carbonated (thankfully not fizzy -- the bane of drinkability), little aftertaste. A million miles from a ""big beer"" but there's a quaffability here."
"Pours a bright, clear golden/straw colored body with a big white head that quickly diminishes to a nice sheet of lace. On the nose you get a good whiff of German hops in the aroma. On the palate the flavor has a nice bitter-sweetness, slight citrus notes in there, light biscuity notes, and perfect bitterness and tingling feeling on the tongue from the hop zest. Body is medium and well carbonated. This is a very good Pilsener"
"I approached this beer with something of a negative bias, based on a German friend who calls Bitburger a lowest-common-denominator beer, ""the Budweiser of Germany."" That being said, while not great, this is better than the bulk of mainstream US beers. Pours clear golden yellow with a finger's worth of dense, nearly white, foamy head. Hops are an evident element of the smell, accentuated by the neutral grain aromas I associate with pilseners. Hops are evident throughout, running dryer as the taste proceeds. While the texture is somewhat watery, the taste remains more substantial than I expected. Mouthfeel is quite clean, and the drinkability is as good as one normally finds in a pilsener. I would rather have a German wheat beer any day, but this isn't too darned bad."
"This is a nice German beer. I like it better than Warstiener, which is Germany's Bud. It's a typical Pils, light in color with little to no head. It has a nice refreshing taste that's not too harsh on the buds, but at the same time, it's not too light that you think it's water. goes down smooth and finishes nice and easy. I'm not a huge fan of Pils, but this one is a goodie."
"This beer is better from the can. It pours dark straw, with a good head. Carbonation abounds. Taste is smooth, with a strong, sweet maltiness that pervades. Hops are present and perfectly accent the finish. This is an excellent example of a premium German pilsner/lager. I found a local store that sells this in tall cans and it is excellent. In bottles, I found it to be less enjoyable, but still quite good. In cans it is awsome. I'll leave it at that."
"The archetypal golden amber to straw color as it sets in the glass, crowned by a modest white head and the lace formed by its demise a fine covering sheet. The crisp and clean nose is heavy with malt, pleasant enough to the senses. Front is mildly acidic, the hop pleasing in their spicy bite and the aftertaste malt dry and long lasting, a good drinking beer and one of the few lagers/pils I find worthy of being in my Stable."
"I'll drink it again"
"The best German pils I've had."
"Poured a clear pale golden color with lots of carbonation. Thin white head disappeared after about 1 minute. Aroma consisted of hops and a feint floral scent. Thin body with a bready flavor in the midtones as the beer warms. Good crisp palatte cleansing appeal. Finish is dry and a tad bitter. An enjoyable pilsner with a decent overall balance in flavor."
"Pours a clear gold with a thin, and quickly dissipating head. Aroma and flavor are grainy and spicy... the hops shine through quite well, without adding much bitterness. Begins with some bread and grain flavors, and finishes spicy and dry. With a thin to medium body, and medium carbonation, the beer is very smooth, crisp, and refreshing."
"A Great Pilsener on tap or in a bottle. Thick white head that sticks to your nose. Nice color and a taste that is crisp and smooth. Goes great with any type of food. I had this beer fresh at the brewery...Life can't get any better...can it?"
"Pours a light pale golden color with a thin white head. It is quite aromatic with notes of spicy hops and grains. It has a sweet malt flavor at first with a hop bitterness to follow. Its crisp, smooth, and dry. Very refreshing! This would go great with some grilled bratwurst and German potato salad."
"Drinkability approaches infinity.   We are talking liters here."
"One of the best lagers in the world with no doubt in my opinion (the other one is Leffe Blonde)!!!. It has a beautiful gold appearance and it is served in a beautiful BITburger glass. Refreshing taste and perfect smell. This German Lager is simply REAL BEER. Keep up the good work at BITburger!!!"
"The tang of a sprout sandwich on sourdough. A meager head over a sunny complexion. Smooth, toasty malt cut with a precise amount of bittering hops ends mostly clean except for a few Noble hop flavor whispers. An eruptive force of flavor on the buds? Not quite. An easy drinker? Definitely!"
"Nice golden colour and bitter. After taste lingers, limited head that quickly disapates and is to lightly carbonated. Not an impressive brew from Germany. The international container was the most interesting thing about this product."
"Crystal clear and straw-colored with a decent sized snow-white head, lightly carbonated, lots of irregular broken lace.  Aroma of sweet malt and mild hops, and slight citrus notes, quite pleasant.  Taste begins with sweet malt, grassy flavors, and a slight sting of carbonation, lemony hops grow more pronounded towards the finish.  Finish is dry with a little lingering bitterness at the back of the tongue.  A good Pilsener, though there are better.  My fiancee really likes this beer, but then she is German."
"This was a decent German beer. Lightly hopped aroma. Golden color with a medium thick, lively head. Light, almost wheaty flavor made this a nice summer beer but it wouldn't really float my boat as a beer to keep stocked in the fridge. Good introduction to import beers."
"Pours a very clear pale yellow with a small thin white head that fades quickly.  The smell is a mix of a lemon twang and oak mixed with slightly grassy notes.  Surprisingly refreshing even from a style that is probably my least favorite.  The taste includes the same as mentioned int he smell and has some crispy hops that are balanced quite well.  Like I said, I'm not a big fan of this style, but this is a good one for the style.  It has a light to medium body and finishes crisp.  Very drinkable!  Prosit!"
"Tan gold color with a mixture of tiny and large bubbles. Can't keep its head. Sweet nose of mango, caramel and some sour yeastiness. A sweet, malty attack with decent balance of pretty toast flavors. The texture is smooth and buttery. Slight hop bitterness combines with roasted grain notes to keep it focused and balanced through the medium-long finish. Another surprise. Based on the commercial sweetness and large bead, I guessed this was Heineken."
"A decent German pils. Now I can taste what some brewers are trying to emulate.  Dry, bright, bitter and easy to drink. Generous carbonation. Smells good, traveled ok. Probably fresher and tastier in ""das Vaterland.""  ""Bitte ein Bitt."""
"Crystal clear pale straw color, tight fizzy white head. Uh oh, horrible yet typical Euro-trash skunked lager smell. Taste was pleasantly crisp, sweet malty flavors balanced with a snappy hop bite. Light feel, but not watery. Slightly buttery taste lingers, but sweet. Very evenly carbonated, and definetly an easy drinking light lager. I could see this as a crisp, refreshing, summer pils. A pleasant surprise."
"The Germans are masterful at packing flavor into light colored beers. This is a another prime example. Light, doughy, grainy, clean aroma with a hint of the spicey hops to come. Flavors deliver on the aroma's promise with the malt turning slightly sweet, but is then countered by a peppery hop finish. Perfect match for my Weisswurst and spicey coarse ground mustard. Prosit!"
"Sigh."
"My first reaction---""Bitter Beer Face"" to quote the Keystone Light (nastiest of all beers) commercial.  But, as I drank more and the beer warmed, I enjoyed it alot.  The aroma was quite hoppy as was the flavor.  But as it warmed, the maltiness of the beer increased and balanced well with the hops.  The second went down even better.  I will definitely be revisiting this beer and enjoying it even more."
"IMPORTANT FACTS:  Despite what other reviews say, I am looking directly at three dead, brown bottles right now.  No green glass for me, dudes!  Also, considering these bottles were at the bottom of the fridge and dusty, there is a chance that the ""bit"" in the bitburger disappeared over several months storage."
"This is a great German lager but if compared to a Czech Pilsner it would be lacking some flavor. Nice golden color, somewhat flavorful, well balanced, and has a crisp finish with touch of hop bite. I have a hard time limiting myself to just couple of these. I have had this in a mini-keg also with good results. Try a bit of the Bit and you will not be let down."
"Lacking an eye pleasing quality, and a potent nose.  Although it smells nice, it's far too faint to be appreciated.  Light bodied, low profile salty-malt character starts then it finishes with a strange dry-hop unripened grape-skin bitterness.  Crisp, clean, light, refreshing, but there would be a number of other brews I would prefer that can cool me down."
"Very pale, extremely light, and dry. It has a soft maltiness, a pronounced hop flavor and a very subtle, elegant, bitterness. The beer has an emphatic sweet, malt note, as well as hops, in the nose; a soft, malty middle; then a rousingly hoppy finish."
"The effervescent, bubbly, crystal clear light yellow hue brew is topped by an attractive and fairly thick head. Perfect lace is left down the glass. It's quite enticing. Soft, grainy and sweet malt notes in aroma with a pleasant green and mildly grassy noble hop nose. Despite the bubbly appearance, the carbonation is not overly high and helps lend a very smooth and agreeable mouthfeel. It's got a bit more body than other commonly available German pils and isn't as dry. The mild, clean hop bitterness hits upfront, but a mellow sweetness ensues. It finishes crisp with light malt sweetness lingering then slowly fading. This is a clean, drinkable and relatively flavorful pils. I haven't had this for a while and was pleasantly surprised at its quality. Bitburger is much better than its counterpart Warsteiner."
"A nice pilsener. Pours out to a bright yellow in the glass with a decent head and average aroma for the style. There is some caramel malt taste present and some actual hops. They are not strong but they are there. Somewhat ""Heineken-esque"" in flavor without the skunky aftertaste. U.S. macros could learn something from this one."
"Bitter, bitter and just plain bitter. Clean aswell. Good session beer, and doesn't give you a hangover, very pleasant."
"Pretty average in the German pilsener category.  Crisp and clean, but alcohol seemed too prominent in the flavor."
"Not bad.  Crisp and clean.  Some malt arrives toward the end"
