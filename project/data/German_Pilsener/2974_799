3.68,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Decent pilsner. Could do worse. Snow globe type carbonation. Has that typical German hop, pale malt scent. Not too much variations in these German pilsners. But they are consistent with taste and feel. Which is good. Nice head that holds up well. Nothing to brag about here. Good beer to drink on a hot day. Not much to knock except how forgettable it is. Not something i would pursue again. 11.2 oz is lame and hurts sales here in my opinion. Would drink again knowing its better than those American macro lagers. The price point on the beer is too high also considering the alternatives. Overall good. Cheers!","silverevo9","Mar 30, 2015"

Pours a beautiful amber, with very little head that doesn't stay long. Smells slightly musky and spicy with a grassy overtone.  Initial mouthfeel is very pleasant: beautiful carbonation, taste that is expansive but stops just short of full bodied. The hops character is well balanced.  A very nice lingering aftertaste and refreshing and satisfying overall.  For $2.45 CAD a can, this is a very light and refreshing brew. Definitely not the best German style Pilsner around, but it is authentic enough and quite good. The irony is that I lived in Germany for many years and never had a chance to taste this particular beer :-)","LeesinkyZaika","Feb 22, 2015"

The lower price may fool you into thinking it's a cheap beer, but it's not.  Quality exudes with it's pure, golden color, thick white head, and generous lacing glass side.  It's flavor is a wonderful balance of dry/bitter hops, yet with a very faint hint of sweetness...It retains it's carbonation all the way to the end of your glass keeping things interesting.  This is an excellent session beer...4 or 5 go down very easily and the taste lingers on...","AdrianRP","Nov 17, 2014"

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, fairly crisp, dry on the finish, not filling at all and the taste did a decent job of holding my attention, I could drink a few of these especially when it's hot outside.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's exactly what I expect from a German made Pilsner.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there's nothing that I disliked or would change about this beer.  I would buy this again when in the mood for the style and I recommend it to anybody that loves a good, easy drinking and traditional example of a Pilsner.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it delivered just what I wanted it to and I'm glad I took a chance on it.  This made for a nice first impression for this brewery and I would be interested in trying more of their beer and I think it's up there as one of the better German Pilsners I've had.  Good job guys, this was an enjoyable Pilsner, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Sep 10, 2014"

3.56,-0.8,2.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"DATE REVIEWED: May 17, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ommegang footed... OCCASION: a day of home prep for Joey's 4th birthday party... APPEARANCE: clean, light golden body; white head reams unevenly... AROMA: yeasts produce a bubble gum aroma; soft floral hops also make this pilsner an intriguing encounter--improves the pervasive zinc/copper metal scents... PALATE: soft start, hard finish; medium-bodied but lingers at the throat; pretty similar pilsner profile... TASTE: slightly fruity, with pear and apple, tempered by a water hose-like hard water finish; adequate, but not to be distinguished or sought after...OVERALLL: wasn't sure where to place expectations--closer to Bitburger or Warsteiner; this beer carves out its own niche, a bit floral and yet with enough rough edges to add strength without disturbing the overall enjoyment of the beer....","dacrza1","Jun 03, 2014"

3.91,8.9,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a pilsener glass. A moderate straw yellow color with an impressive thick white head collapsing inward from the middle, this lager has a nice sulfur and cereal grain nose, laced with herb and grass hops (including some light lavender, chamomile, and seed spice notes). Smells clean, brisk, and green with pronounced noble hopping. Palate is a fine synergy of pale malts (maybe a hint of sweetish corn) and minty green hops, along with subtle lemon, cashew, dried vegetable, licorice, hay, and sour grape, with a vegetal celery-like bitterness slowly building over time. Robust and flavorsome but no one element goes berserk on the palate. Moderate body for a German pilsener, with the carbonation restrained for the style and a dry, grassy, faintly nutty finish. A kindler, gentler pils (looking at you Krombacher) but nevetheless full of flavor and body. Fantastic.","CalgaryFMC","May 26, 2014"

Color was a bright sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a smell like field grain, light for a German Pils, and kind of cereal-like with no discernible hop presence. Mouthfeel was soft, light, very smooth. The taste had that same cereal-like quality that I noted on the nose, and maybe a light grassiness of hops. Finish was still cereal-like, prevalently, and the grassiness lingered lightly in the background after the finish.

Lacing was average. The aroma was grain, and smelled much like white wine. (Grapes). The body of this brew is light, has a malted grain base, bitter, earthy herbal hops that gives way to the taste and finish of cauliflower. Nice example of a traditional German Pilsner, easy to drink, good session beer and great buy at 1.99 for a 22 oz bottle.

Earthy hops and mineral notes comprise the mainstay of the nose, with bready-doughy notes underlying. The flavor is along the same lines with clean finish. As the brew airs out a bit, it gains a modicum of floral honey sweetness. The various elements at play make for less crispness than the style calls for, as it has a bit of a soft sweetness that is more befitting, say, a Dortmunder.

Mild malty sweetness up front, followed by lemony and grassy hop notes. A little more than light bodied with crisp carbonation, off-dry, nice texture overall. This was really easy drinking.

The smell is a very mild, yet spicy hops and bread dough tickle the nose hairs. Carbonation is perfect! Delicate bitterness that again demans further drinking as it teases the senses and one must have more. This beer is a must for all Pilsner fans! I suggest anyone who visits Dresden or Radeberg try the Zwickelbier on tap as well.

Aroma is beery, a faint whiff of skunk when first poured, some malt, grass, grain, hop, and light fresh sawdust. Flavor had the barest hint of skunk that disappeared right away.

Eight hours on a plane sure beats 2 weeks on a boat followed by uncounted weeks on various loading docks, warehouses, and a retail shelf. This the classic taste of German pilsner that I remember from my first trip there 14 years ago. It is crisp, dry, a little soft, and has a firm, light malt character that whispers toast or crackers beneath a delicate minty hop flavor and aroma. Balance and finesse are the watchwords of the style as these beers go down way too easily, and recall fond memories of my excursions in Germany where I intentionally allowed the beers to follow one after the other in rapid succession. The golden color and malty aroma beg to remind me of the long walks I took through vast wheat fields; in love with the beer that soothed the hurt for the German girl I was in love with.

The flavor is fuller than the nose suggests, but remains the same with the addition of a light touch of lemon amidst the grassy, gently herbal, and floral hops.

The beer could have used a dose of malt aroma, and certainly more intensity in the hops. The flavor is pretty tasty, with a little sweetness up front.

Feels fairly smooth, but not with the pilsner creamy texture that I wanted, leaving the grain profile to come across a bit astringent (grain hulls).

And as a whole, pilsners seem to be overlooked but they are really becoming one of my favorite styles more and more these days. But back to this particular pils. It's very well made and true to style, with out being too textbook. Appears a perfect pale color, straw like, with excellent clarity. A decent dense head lasts for a while. Once again, this style seems to be overlooked, and if you're looking for a beer that's going to smack you in the face with flavor, go to the west coast and drink some IPAs. This beer has a lot of subtleties to it that all seem to work together. A sturdy base of pale malts and light honey tastes combine with a really spicy and herbal hop profile. Nice black pepper hints and general zestyness. A bit of lemony zang in there as well. One of the smoothest beers I've ever drank, and perfect for when you want to drink more than a few in an evening. Definately do yourself a favor and check out some pilsners, it'll make you rethink a few things about beer in general. Well I guess I'm just speaking for myself when I say that, but regardless, this beer is great.","twelvsies","Oct 01, 2005"
3.45,-3.9,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"A solid German Pilsner. Poured out to a clear mellowed blonde color with a respectable 1/2 inch head. Some minor lacing around the glass. Odors of grass, grain and dough are prominent. Taste is mild and enjoyable; flavors of hops, malt and grain, all the while remaining light and fresh. Lighter mouthfeel leads me to believe that this could be a good session beer. Probably even better on tap. Worth a try.","Frozensoul327","Sep 25, 2005"

Poured out a clear pale straw pilsner with an impressive fluffy white cap that laces the glass well... very light nose; gentle grassy aromas with diminutive wisps of sweet grains. Starts malty and citrusy then the hop bittering takes over the malt spine ( which is too thin IMHO) and it ends in a dry bitter finish. I can take or leave this one...with more substantially malted, distinctive German beers like Konig, Wernesgruner and Gosser on the LCBO shleves for the same coin why would they offer this marginally premiun beer?","pootz","May 02, 2005"

3.98,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Quite the pleasant change of pace after sampling some high quality stouts, Belgians, and old ales. This pours a pale straw yellow body that is clear as a pristine mountain stream. Fluffy white head quickly diminishes into film and patchy lace. Aroma is grainy malt and spicy German hops, with a grassy hops component. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Light medium body. Taste is just right for a well constructed German Pilsener. Grainy and bready malt is happily married to the grassy and herbal hops. Aftertaste is dry and mildly bitter and astringent. Very clean and crisp. I would love to have a case of this one in the ""Fridge"". Ideal lawnmower beer, with elegant German class.","merlin48","Feb 22, 2005"
3.6,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I try and stay away from cans, but there are certain exceptions, most of them Germans. A classy black and gold can, definitely not your run of the mill type. This lager is a very pale straw colour, with great clarity. The head gives it an above average appearance; creamy, extremely consistent: it poured with only about 1 finger of head, but it simply did not seem to move. Bright white, ice cream, velvety look to it. It actually looks much like milk from the top, that is how tight and creamy it is. Some large bubble lacing, better than many bottled lagers. The aroma is typical of a German pilsener, but it is appetising and has all the smells I was expecting: subdued fruitiness, pale malt, hop grassiness. The aroma is well balanced between the three. Fresh, adjunct free aroma. Typical taste too, but well brewed. All the regular suspects here: grainy malt in the front and middle, and a very respectable dryness, grassy and even oily. I taste some good caramel, wheat cereal, and hard water. The hops leave some earthy notes and metallic ironlike ones. A balanced taste, with the hops slightly more dominant in the finish. Toned down carbonation compared to many canned pilseners, which is a nice change. Mouthfeel is dry, but not overly, and medium bodied. Just full and just watery enough to make it highly drinkable. Radeberger is a typical, unexciting but well done lager in the German tradition. This is worth a try on a summer day.","Cwrw","Jan 12, 2005"

A beer to be had on the colder side.","Sammy","Nov 18, 2004"
3.98,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a light gold color. The head is frothy and big with average retention and a patchwork of lace left behind. The aroma is of barley, some grassy saaz hops and a sulfury note. The taste is a great mix of robust bready malts, and sea air saaz hops. The mouthfeel is light but very smooth and pleasant. An above average pilsner, very tasty and full.","CAMRAhardliner","Nov 16, 2004"

3.81,6.1,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Came in a black 500 ml can. Pours out a clear, crisp straw colour, capped by a large billowy head of white foam, excellent retention, with thick chunky lacing. The nose is faint, with metallic grains and light floral hops. The flavour is a decent balance of sweet bready malt, moving towards metallic grains in the middle, which blends seemlessly into the floral, slightly herbal hop finish, and carries through the aftertaste. Excellent quenching mouthfeel across the palate that turns on a dime into a dry, crisp finish. The hops are contained and do not turn astringent. A very impressive pilsener, it's not overwhelmingly unique or flavourful, but has everything in the right place and stands on its own as a good standard for the style.","IronDjinn","Sep 23, 2004"

3.8,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Crisp, autumn leaf colour that reminds me of fishing at sunset. Big, fluffy head pours straight outta the can, but slowly subsides to about one lasting finger. Lace sticks to the glass at random intervals. Hard to describe, but basically a chaotic pattern of lacy foam. Bakery bread smell, with not much hops. The nose is almost fooled into thinking this is a solid food, not a liquid; the bread smell is so convincing. Taste is more balanced than the scent. Their is that malty flavour upfront. It's like drinking fresh white bread. Tasty, and settles great in the stomach. Yet the aftertaste has a bittering dryness, a quick slap letting you know hops are used in this pilzner. Mouthfeel is a bit thick. Pretty drinkable as a session beer, and something most people would at least like.","slitherySOB","Sep 05, 2004"
1.83,-49,2.5,2,1.5,2,2,"This beer pours a standard yellow color with a small head that quickly fades away. Skunky aroma - not even slightly interesting. Maybe it was a bad bottle, maybe it was a standard pilsner from that area. The taste was not interesting to me. Crisp and slightly clean, but still skunky in the taste. Didn't care for this one.","clvand0","Sep 04, 2004"

3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"BC has a lot of Euro lagers in 500ml cans which is good because they can be purchased individually and are never light struck. Radeberger is the newest available German lager and it is pretty decent all round. The colour is pale gold with a hoppy nose. The profile is fresh and full bodied with a hoppy finish. This is much better than any BC lager due its balance and big flavour. At $2.10 a can this is a great deal and well worth buying.","canucklehead","Aug 07, 2004"
2.58,-28.1,3,2.5,2,4,3,"This is just another run of the mill German lager. Boring, boring, boring. The beer pours typical lager, except it has quite a large dense head. Smells faintly of earthy hops.

3.12,-13.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear greenish gold under a one finger white head that fades quickly but musters a few spots of lace. The nose is sweet malt. The mouth is light and prickly. There is a decent malt base taste, overlayed with a light hoppy bite. The hops are neither flowery nor metallic, just crisp and clean. This bite lingers a bit into the aftertaste, but is mild and short-lived. Radeberger is better now than when it was the flagship brew of the GDR, but it still ain't no great shakes.","Globetrotter","May 29, 2004"

It has a nice balancing bitterness to it, which leaves a lingering tingle on my tongue requiring another imbibation. If my taste buds were not so adulterated by homebrewing with excessive hop levels I might even say it was bit bitter.

It seems as if the hops are initially present, and then the beer rounds out with very nice and favorable malts.  Very smooth, and easy to drink with a clean aftertaste that leaves a hint of the malts.
