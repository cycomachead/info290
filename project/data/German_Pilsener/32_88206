Very malty and sweet on the front palate. More of an Oktoberfest or Markzen style beer. Lots of barley, bread, and wheat. Smooth syrup sugar-- caramel. Mid-palate there is just a quick hint of hops. A slight alcohol bite. Rolls back to malt, syrup, and wheat. Slight alcohol and maple syrup after taste. Very light taste. Drinkable. Hiding in its ABV. Extremely smooth. I think the problem is that you expect more from the Sapphire hops as you should-- it's a good German beer, but if you're looking for bite you will be disappointed. It is a good beer-- but it isn't hoppy. It's malt and creamy. Had they labeled it Marzen it would be more well received, but it is what it is as they say. 3.5. Good.","digitalflood","Feb 16, 2014"

Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with an inch and a half off-white head. It smells like sweet malt, light apples and that's about it. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt noticeable. Doesn't smell good, but not awful either. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and easy enough to drink. Moderate carbonation. It's not a bad brew, but I'd only recommend it if you want a tick or if you can get a single can or bottle of it like I did.","bluejacket74","Sep 27, 2013"

Seriously, are there real "sapphire" hops? I looked them up on the interwebs and it turns out that they do exist, but are usually spelled "Saphir," since they are German hops that are used in place of Hallertau. Two points to bring up for Beck's: 1.) "Saphir" is one heck of a cooler spelling than "Sapphire." 2.) If you are a German brewery brewing a beer using a new German hop, maybe you should brew it in...I dunno...GERMANY! This beer is not swill, but is not great and certainly is not worth the almost $10 you will pay for a sixer of this brew.","BeerDocT","May 18, 2013"

I liked the opaque black bottle (no green bottle skunk), though I was surprised at how light (roughly "gold") in color the beer was once it hit the glass. I got a decent head of white foam that dissipated quickly and left only a hint on top. I agree with many of the descriptions of the flavor here. Initial biscuity malt and a hint of citrus-like hops in the nose. The carbonation was surprisingly light and "spritzy" while the beer itself was light to moderate in density. This made for a strangely mixed yet somewhat refreshing mouthfeel. A tad sweet on the tongue with a mild malty flavor and a hint of that citrusy hops. Flavor profile is one-dimensional and mild. Little bitterness at the end and then nothing. And I mean that in a good way. No off flavors, no skunk--nothing.

The taste focuses on the wheat and flowers, but waters them down to keep their edges from showing and adds a heavy splash of sweetness that helps to drown them out regardless. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, if there actually are any hops here, they're completely o'erwhelmed. Regardless, this stuff is meek as all hell for a pils or any other kind of German lager: It's far too sweet for its own good, and any character beyond that is ridiculed into obscurity.","TMoney2591","Jan 19, 2013"

Tasted like a very sweet lager with no aftertaste. I would drink this on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn. Overall, it was a nice light change from stouts and IPA's I usually drink.","dcall384","Jan 18, 2013"

2.47,-10.5,3,2.25,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Poured aggressively into a glass. Bready aromas, faint skunk noted in previous entries. Golden color, two-finger creamy, foamy head. No lacing, but ring of foam on top of beer. Light carbonation emanating from the bottom. Malty taste and mouthfeel. A whisper, virtually non-existent, of hop bitterness. Being maltier than regular Beck's, it leaves a coating around the mouth. Almost overwhelmingly sweet. A "fuller," maltier version of Bud. Nothing special.","tomthumbsblues","Jan 16, 2013"

It pours a light amber/ golden with a white head that dissapears as fast as you can pour. what little foam remains leaves some slight lacing. It smells like watered down beer, some malt and what I assume are the "Sapphire hops". The taste is soapy to the point that I dumped my first beer out and rinsed the glass, only to find out that it was the beer. It has a light mouthfeel with some moderate, prickly carbonation. Overall, Pretty gross.","silverking","Jan 13, 2013"

3.17,14.9,3.5,3.25,3,3.25,3.25,"A different recipe from regular Becks lager that dials down the sharp bitterness to a mellow and rounded flavor that is very pleasant and easy to drink, if slightly underwhelming. Unfortunately "pleasant" soon turns to monotonous, and this beer simply doesn't have enough character to qualify as sessionable. One bottle is enough, and the palate craves something else.","Aaron_Ramson","Jan 08, 2013"

Very different yet cool black bottle, you can barely see through it. I'm short glasses so ill have to stick to that. Smell is pretty faint, average pilsner, nothing ou of the ordinary. The taste however really caught me off guard. It's very sweet upfront then buttery, slight breadlines, followed by more sweet. It's had a really nice creamy velvet mouthfeel I haven't experienced in a pilsner before, but I really like it, goes down real easy. I don't consider 6%abv high but it's more than average BMC's. Overall I can't wait to try this again and this is definetly something I'd keep in my fridge on a regular basis.","tyleeis","Jan 06, 2013"

I generally don't purchase Becks although I do like German Pils'. I am utterly let down about the beer overall. This beer tastes almost exactly like the Budweiser Platinum without the heavy alcohol hit at the end. It has no hints of hops at all and no malt taste. I read the back of the beer and it plainly states, Brewed in St. Louis MO. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the base grain bill for this beer is almost identical to Budweiser. My guess is InBev is going after the hipster market that won't purchase Bud Platinum. I would suggest this to anyone that likes light American Lagers, otherwise move on.","BeerActivistAL","Dec 29, 2012"

An AB-InBev fail. Kicking up the abv and putting it in a brown bottle does not make it an auto better brew.","Bitterbill","Dec 29, 2012"
