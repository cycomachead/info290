"This is very hoppy pils not bad.Not what I like but not bad."
"Light beer but not watery. Very good very drinkable!"
"Not too big on pilsners but this one is delish."
""
""
"I could drink a lot of these. Smooth, crisp, and delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't immediately impressed with the look and smell of this Pilsner...but once I started drinking it improved greatly! Lot's of taste for a beer that, on the surface, doesn't appear much better than a Bud Light. Will definitely drink again if I see it on the menu"
"Very impressive true pilsner from Left Hand. Tasty and easy to drink, what more to you want from the style??Two thumbs way up. Prost!"
""
""
""
"I've had this from tap several times.  It tastes somewhere between a PA and a pils and it works really well.  It's refreshing and full flavored.  Try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rather unique for an American Pilsner being that it is not pasteurized.  It does give it a fresh flavor but its relatively iffy because its not that full flavored of a beer."
""
"I had this poured into a Pilsner glass. The color was a straw-gold, transparent. Just the look you want from a Pilsner. I didn't get the fruit flavors that others have spoken of in here, found it a bit watery. Nose is nothing of note, mouthfeel wasn't too heavy, not a ton of carbonation. Slightly above average pils."
""
"5/22/13  At Rattle N Hum, NYC, on tap. Hoppier than this un-hoppy guy likes, but not a total skeeve. Once is enough."

"Thanksgiving Day beer tasting at Bro's house."

"Tasty pilsner, smooth and slick, with a crisp bite. Cracker with some citrus and grassiness. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a light yellow in color kind of like a Mello Yello.  VERY Carbonated. hints of various citrus. wasn't it really my thing"

"O. I could suck down an entire pitcher after a good run to quench my thirst. Little to no buzz for 5.5%.  I’m still sure this is a no alcoholic. Very refreshing for a pilsner goes down faster than water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pilsners tend to bore a lot of people, but this one is perfect to have on a hot summer day.  Light and easy to drink, plenty of flavor despite a lowish alcohol content, and a great tasting beer.  Don't ignore this one at the store."

"sour green grapes yeast and good pilsner balance bitterness, without being over powering make this joy to drink."

"O: I was not surprised that this was an excellent beer -- Left Hand's classic lineup is stronger than the new direction they have taken their beers (see 900-Pound, Stranger Pale Ale, Safety Round #3, etc). I hope they move back to the solid beers with better flavor melding than their current lineup of beers with sharp-edged and not that enjoyable flavors. Polestar Pilsner is one of Left Hand's best brews for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the few US brewed pilsners to taste like a pilsner and not a skewed ale...the disparity of reviews was surprising. I get to drink a fare amount of beer around the world and this one led me to register. The brewers deserve a pat on the back for crafting something very worthy of drinking. This one will go on my list."

"O - A stellar pilsner to rival the great Czech offerings."

"Brilliant amber gold, medium-high carbonation with good head retention, crisp, slightly bitter, bread malt and subtle herby hop flavours, dry and slightly bitter finish, a very good pilsner"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a nice pils; the styles just not for me."
"O - A refreshing easy drinking offering."
""
""
"O: Would try again, after reading reviews, possibly a bit of an older bottle that wasn't treated too well before I purchased it."
""

"As good a pilsner gets."

"Prominent Saaz on the palate, dry, drinkable, nice balancing malt in there too. Great balance of flavorful yet drinkable. One of the better European style Pilsners on the market from American brewers."

"Very light in color with a white head about a finger in size. A almost sweet start with a strong yeasty finish. Leaves the tongue nice and clean and wanting more. I'm not usually much of a Pilsner fan, but I really enjoy this one by Left Hand. I will definitely get it again. I think this would be a great bridge beer to get a budweiser or miller fan into craft brewing. I plan on introducing my dad to it the next time we cook out together."
"Pilsners will never win the BA Top 250 but if I had to pick a good one this is certainly a favorite."

"Overall – Doesn't live up to the higher reviews in my opinion. It's a little too grassy/adjunct tasting to be a world class pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I found myself enjoying this one considerably! It's light enough to enjoy multiple in one sitting, yet packs enough flavor to keep you interested, only if just. Definitely worth consideration."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good drinker, made very well and worth picking over some of the German imports if you can get it at a good price. Otherwise, I miss the good melanoidin malts that the better German labels will have."

"I found this for $1.29 at Belmont Party Supply. For that price, I frankly wasn't expecting much. It pours an attractive golden color with fine bubbles swimming frantically to the top. The medium head shows very good retention. Smell is somewhat fruity with biscuit and mild hop aromas. Taste is on the sweeter side for a pilsner but still offers a nice biscuit flavor. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with carbonation on the lower end of the spectrum. Overall, this beer tastes fresh, complex (for a pilsner), and remarkably balanced. It would make a great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm revisiting this after trying it once before and being blown away. Unfortunately, doesn't live up to my memory of it. Nevertheless, a solid, good-drinking quaffer that deserves a better rating than it gets here. When I drank it before I remember a rather distinct almost sweet creamy taste and feel (especially for a pilsner) but I don't detect that now. I wonder if this is a bit past prime. Scent is floral and the taste is pretty middle of the road slightly bitter pilsner style. I drank it first in 90 degree weather and it was perfect then. I'm gonna try this again in July and see what I think."

"O: I had this beer years ago and wrote it off completely. I ordered a bottle of it at a bar, and it tasted skunky and stale. Since then I've passed it over on store shelves countless times. Holy Christ, what a mistake. i never realized Polestar had this type of game. This is right up there with the best American-made pilsners, and it could challenge the best imports too. Goes to show you how much of a difference beer freshness can make."
""
""
"Don't know how old this bottle is though."
"O - Wish I could find this in 6er's or 12er's, as this is an excellent pilsener. Lot's of flavor yet stil refreshing. Highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is a bit bolder in hops which creep up after the grainy and sweetness tickle the tongue. Dry at the finish. This is an ideal pilsener for a hot, humid day like today. I could drink several of them."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly bitter and dry, but there's enough malt sweetness early to keep my interest. Carbonation is off. Wonder about the age on this one."
""

"Pours faded yellow with a finger of white foam that fell pretty fast but left a thin skin on top and some good lace. Perfect clarity. Nose is pilsner all the way. Yeasty and dank. A touch of lemon and some fresh cut grass. Some spice on a good light malt. A little bit of a mineral quality too. Taste is light biscuit and floral hops. Grassy with a touch of bitter. Body is soft and smooth the malt is airy and light. Really an outstanding pils that isn’t too bitter and offers a graceful malt through out the drink. Finished dry with a delicate texture, a touch bitter and a kiss of honey sweetness. Well done! You could happily drink this beer all day."

"Overall: Left Hand does no wrong in my opinion, and Polestar certainly didn't try to convince me otherwise. Not my favorite of their brews, but I would happily drink it at a cook-out. Very refreshing and has a nice complexity to tease your palate."
""
""
""
"Overall: An enjoyable German pilsner styled beer. Easy drinking and very enjoyable with a little hops to it too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I like my pilseners to be chalk-dry and sharp with lots of cracker and biscuit, but this pils did not fit that bill...it has too much sweetness and fruit flavor. Nevertheless, it is a good-looking brew and the mouthfeel is spot-on for the style. I have tried it twice now (with a gap of eight months in between tastings) with consistent tasting notes."

"Flavors of light grains, minerals, straw, grassy hops. All in all a light body with some crisp, penetrating hops and a dry finish."
"Better than a typical Pilsner pour, with a page golden body, lively carbonation streamers full of tiny bubbles, and a two finger thick, craggy head. The smell was flowery, grassy, and had a hint of cooked corn in it. The taste was a mixture of simple sweetness with a lemony and spicy hop presence. Easy to drink, due to a light, aired out body, and clean lemon drop like finish. I just wanted a lighter diversion this week from the usual ales I drink, and this was just what I expected. Nothing spectacular, but who buys a Pils expecting that?"

"O: For a beer that says its a Malt Liquor, it sure has some flavor to it. Very good beer, more like a summer time session. Never have been disappointed by a brew from Left Hand. Never seen a color so pale before, but its unique and doesnt indicate a lack of flavor at all."

"From a bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Smell is non existent very clean. After poor head builds into around two fingers. White head. Taste is crisp but good. This would be a good summer beer its a good beer that i would recommend for a newbie drinker."
""
""
""
"4.08/5.00"
""
"O: An above average pilsner. I wouldnt recommend anyone to go search this beer out, but if you're in the mood for a good pils, this is the place to grab it. I really do like left hand brewery, and i do plan to search out more of their brews in the near future."
""

""

"Pilsners are a popular beer style the world over and Left Hand Brewing Polestar Pilsner is one of the better I have sampled. There is a certain sulfur- like quality in the nose that some may not like, but I found it more than tolerable and the overall taste is generally smooth and very drinkable. It is a fine pilsner beer that most fans of the style will find to their liking."
"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 7/7/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining a head. Aromas of pear, lemon, herbal, floral, bready malt, grass, pepper, and light earth. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of lemon, pear, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and earth. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, bread, cracker, pepper, grass, herbal, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors with decent complexity. Fairly dry on the finish but does not feel watery at all. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a fairly crisp and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Pilsner. Not quite as bold as some others I have had. However, it is nicely balanced with a good amount of flavor; and very smooth to drink as expected. Nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
"This is a nice, hoppy, sessionable beer. The flavor is solid and the drinkability is great. I'll definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a bright gold with an appealing white head leaving plenty of lacing and bubbles dancing for the drinker's pleasure. Smell is of grain and foliage, overall earthy. Taste expands with a deliciou,s and complex hop profile. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and extremely refreshing. Overall, a great lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow color with very little head. Scents has that great grainy pilsner smell. Taste is light, grainy, and slightly dry as to be expected. After taste is slightly chalky and dry. Light and easy drinking beer but could be better. Personally I was expecting something a little better from Left Hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing but forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best American pilsners I’ve ever had. It won’t win any awards for complexity, but every little thing about it is enjoyable. Sessionable, and then some."
""
"Poured into a mug and I got a very nice crystal clear beer with medium carbonation and a thick white head that slowly dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles. Mild lacing dresses the mug as the beer moves around inside, its got the distinct German pilsner aroma to it, very fresh and crisp; lemon zest, wheat smells come through. Its light on the tongue, some lemon flavors are present along with some other mild citrus fruits like orange, apple and wheat flavors are present but I didn’t pick up any hops. Its goes down really smooth and leaves a slight tangy aftertaste with just a hint of alcohol."
""
""
"O: I'm generally not a fan of pilsners, but this beer is very clean and refreshing -- the best pilsner I've had to date. I'd be happy to have another one of these, especially on a hot day."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow color with a solid, creamy white head. Nice spicy hop presence in the aroma...pale malty sweetness, grass, and mild lemon. Sweet malt flavor and further hop spiciness. Herbs, grass, and grain add an earthy element to compliment the spice. Not bad all around, a decent stab at the style actually. Crisp and refreshing. There's just something keeping it from being really good. I could drink a few of these with ease though..."
"O: Enjoyable beer that goes down very easy. Good beer that goes well with Summer activities"
"Overall - This isn't too bad of a beer at all. I generally don't drink pilsners, but this was an exception. I enjoyed it, it's a pretty good beer. I would recommend it, probably buy it again but I would absolutely drink it again."

"I'll still take it over a Bud though."
"The appearance is very nice,clear,blonde,lots of tiny bubbles,and frothy head. The smell is disappointing, ""green bottle"" alert,although this one's coming out of a brown. The taste is much better,but I found it to be a little bland,not enough bread,malty taste and really not much hop,except in the smell. Im not one who likes much hop. I would drink this again,however,im sure its better with some complimentary foods."

"On tap at Hops and Pie and served in a Polestar Pilsner glass. Bright yellow, appearance fits the bill. Smells like a pils, hint of earth, minerals, very subtle. Taste is refreshing, nice hint of mineral (why do I always taste this in pils and kolsch?), crisp. Great beer for a hot day, no complaints on this one."
"With a totally nonexistent haze this beer makes a good impression, and the carbonation is crisp and cleansing. The taste has that really dry biscuity flavor typical of pilsners. Overall its not bad, it's very refreshing but its biggest flaw is that it just doesnt really stand out."
"Overall this is a pretty typical pils. There is no depth but the beer is crisp and refreshing and it would be easy to put a couple of these away in a night."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good pilsner. Reminds me that summer is just around the corner. I'll def be picking up a case of this to have for family gatherings."
"Though not one of my preferred styles, this is a very good beer and one I'd definitely recommend for anyone who is going to spend a day out in the sun."

"a nice crisp pils. pours that classic pale yellow clear with a happy 2 inch white head. smells like german malts and grassy hops in equal proportion. flavor is well balanced too, with the malt in the front and the hops in the back. i would compare this to victory's prima pils in flavor and in mouthfeel. very very refreshing, especially when its ice cold. quick mildly hoppy light finish, high drinkability. not the most exciting lefthand brew, but a very quaffable article. this will be good on the golfcourse this summer."
"Overall a tasty session beer, but not something I would seek out again unless it was a few dollars cheaper."
""
"A great pilsner. Beautiful golden color, thick head and even, heavy lacing. Smells mild as a pilsner should, fresh grass, slight mint, some citrus. Tastes very good, clean, crisp, the slight citrus is there, and crisp, dryish hops. A malty, grainy richness is in the background holding it all together. Mouthfeel is sublime and superb. Everything a great pilsner should be. Excellent work by Left Hand. Highly recommended to fans of the style, of which I am definitely one. All hail the mighty Pilsner!"
""
""
"O: Provided you can get past the smell (or just hold your nostrils), this beer isn’t that bad and is relatively easy to drink. It doesn’t have any overpowering flavors so it would probably make a good accompaniment to food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The crisp and refreshing beer has nice balance of between the fizz texture and the full crisp hops with some nice malt support."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The bitterness works well to balance out the flavours and although it does subside somewhat, in the end it's probably slightly too strong."
""
""

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on 8/17/11. This pours a straw color with a nice white head which leaves a lacing. The smell is nice and crisp, some grass, a little hop smells some bread malts. The feel is media to light. The taste is similar to the smell, crisp, a little hop bite, some bread malts, but there is also a weird metallic taste."
"Overall I'd say its a pretty average beer, certainly not bad, but nothing really stands out... Except maybe the bottle, heh."
"O: This is a fantastic pilsner right here. Certainly very drinkable and certainly something I'd gladly drink again. I wish there was a little more on the nose, but overall I feel like this beer makes for a pretty solid experience. This would make a really good session beer."
""
""
"Overall I like this brewery for other beers and this one is kind of a one trick horse."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice golden color with a crisp white 1 finger head that quickly settled to a 1/4 finger cap. There was little to the aroma but nice bready and slightly yeasty notes, with maybe some light grassy hops. The taste was crisp and clean. Nice malty balance over some very earthy hops. Very clean and refreshing as a pilsener should be. The carbonation was medium with a lighter body. This is a good example of what a German Pils should be."
""
""
""
"O/D-Its gotta be pretty hard to make a really memorable Pilsener. This one just sits in the mediocre range. Not bad, and I bet lovers of the style would enjoy it, but for me, the single I bought is more than enough. A modest beer."

"Easy to drink and quite tasty and refreshing."
"The Polestar Pilsner from Left Hand, my second on Xmas Day, is common to most German Pilsners out there. The beer pours a Golden Clear with razon thin white head that is leaving some lacing. The smell and taste are brought to you by Saaz hops, crisp with grain hints. The mouthfeel is medium to light body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good American version of a German classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I drank 2 of these in a row and the hop flavor is pretty bitter, with a strong lemon floral type taste, some very mild malt flavors in the back ground. The after taste lasts longer than I would like it to. Overall not bad, not great. But at almost $10 bucks for a six pack, I will not be getting this beer again."
""

"This is some tasty stuff. They broke the mold when they made this pilsner but it works very well. Complex flavor yet crisp and clean. Brilliant."
""

""

"4.0 D: Solid all around. A well made pilsner."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GETTING!"
"My favorite pilsner. Perfect for a nice summer day. Crisp and dry just how I like it."
"Taste is very malt forward. Dry and crisp. Carbonation and hops come through on the back end. The beer finishes more aggressively then it begins."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. The beer is a clear golden color, the perfect color that a pilsner should be, not too light. A creamy white head sits on top, and dissipates a little. What is left is a medium thin layer of bubbles. I appreciate this very much, as the head never goes away completely. Good sticky lacing down the glass. Smells of citrus, lemongrass, and faded hops are present. The taste is interesting. A bit too lemony and herbal for me. It has a light grassy taste, if that makes sense. A great summer beer for sure. The mouthfeel is just right, very lager-esque. Overall, I think my rating will be higher than what i would actually prefer. It's a complex beer, but therein lies the brilliance of it. I wouldn't want to session this at all, but it would make an awesome beer for lunch on a spring or summer day. Again, I keep trying to find faults with this, but when i break down each individual area it's pretty good, yet unique in all of them. I probably won't try it again though. How weird."
"O: This is not a bad pilsner, but it is a tad watery. I would have also liked a more assertive flavor profile. I guess I expected a bit too much."
"Overall – for the most part not a very pilsner-tasting pilsner, at least not so in my opinion. It’s not bad though, and somewhat thought-provoking."
"Pours a light golden color, like clear straw, with thin lacing around the top. A light hoppy aroma and a delicate sweetness to the palate, almost honey-like. This is a light, crisp, refreshing pilsner that doesn’t overwhelm or disappoint. Big guys, take note: pilsners don’t have to be fizzy and flavorless!"
"Overall - I enjoyed this beer. It's different from the other Pilsners I've tried due in part to the slight cider taste, but even if that weren't present, this would still be a very solid Pilsner."
"Pours a clean golden straw color with thin cap of white froth, little lacing. Scent is pure pilsener with lightly twangy malt and some lemony and faintly grassy hops. Simple, clean pilsen malt taste leads with solid lemmony and lightly grassy, but not over the top hopping found in many American pilsener versions these days. Lighter side of medium bodied, crisp. A good all around refreshing pils."
"Overall: One of the better American interpretations of a German pilsner."
"O- This is a so-so pilsener that's just short a bit on the hops. Add some spicy hops or more of the light grassiness that's there and you've got a top notch beer"
"Conclusion: This is another thoughtful and well crafted beer from Left Hand, which is earning my respect with each new beer I try. I enjoy the laid back character of this beer, and the soft but clean flavors it provides."
"Picked up a bottle of this one as part of a mixed six. Poured a clear golden yellow with a min imal white head. Aromas of straw and light citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of straw, bread and spicy hops with a crisp dry bitter finish."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent golden straw color with a thin layer of head. Very little lacing. Smells slightly sour. Yeast, cut grass, and a bit of orange peel. Taste is more of the same. Sour yeast dominates with some earthy, grass flavors. A bit of orange peel near the end. Light, easy drinking beer. Pretty decent for warm days but the sourness and orange peel are a bit off putting to me for some reason. Mouthfeel is actually a bit creamy which I did not expect. Overall, its an alright beer but nothing special."
"Pours a very hazy straw colorwith almost no head and minimal lacing. Aroma is light: yeasty, slightly grassy, lemony, with a hi t o hops. Mouthfeel is light, slightly carbonated. Taste is actually a bit bland; some hops, fairly yeasty, some spices, and a hint of grass is noticed before finishing with a metallic touch. If cold, this is a pretty refreshing beer, but nothing extremely exciting."
"It's not often a pilsner really grabs my attention. I'm glad I finally gave this a shot. I'll be working it into my regular rotation from now on. Nice work, Left Hand!"
"This one has some unique aspects that make it a little different from the typical, fairly narrow style confines of a pilsner. The malts are super clean with a biscuit dough creaminess and I dont find them to be grainy or husky at all. The hops also lend a somewhat uncommon biting bitterness that is somewhere between grassy, floral and even piney in its lingering aspect. I wouldnt mind seeing more hop flavor and less bitterness. It works ok in the end, but I prefer my pilsners with more grainy/husky malt flavor and a distinctive saaz-y hop flavor with just enough bitterness for balance."
"Light bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as any pilsener should be. The body is light and refreshing. The carbonation is a little fizzy but not overpowering or overly noticeable."
"Nice effort though, if they tweaked it a bit more they could reach the next level."
"Overall impression: I'll give this another shot in a bottle, but this growler provided a subpar pils experience. Old keg, maybe? (This was one of the first kegs in the state.)"
"Taste-Biscuit malt, cracker, baked bread. Nice hop bite that doesn't overwhelm, but balances nicely. Very crisp and refreshing finish. A fine take on a German Pilsener that would be welcome at any summer outdoor gathering. Very nice."
"Overall a fantastically well-balanced pilsner. Drink one, you'll want another."
"That's a nice pilsner that differentiaties itself from others on the market."
"O - Easy to quaff. There's a lot of flavor in this lager."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, brisk and refreshing on the palate. Drinks quick and easy, a nice American offering if you're looking for that warm weather pilsner."
"Pale straw colored brew, just the slightest of haze, lots of rising carb bubbles support a large pillowy white head which sticks all over the glass. Light sweet malt scent, pretty grainy with a slight touch of hops. Very grainy and bready taste, light sweet malts, a light floral hop finish. Grassy with a bit of lemon. Very clean and refreshing, fairly full bodied. Very solid pils, might become a go-to for the summer months."
"Clear yellow body with lasting white bubbly head. Aroma is spicy greens, sharp clean hop with some pepper and orange peel. Tastes of spicy hop character,vague cereal, lemon peel, hop bitterness and a clean but slight lemon cookie aftertaste. Light in body but a bit dull in carbonation. Good session but I wish it was crisper."
"Overall Impression- Enjoyed thoroughly! Can be compared to New Belgium's Blue Paddle but more body to it (B.P. more watery). Very drinkable and a good beer to classify a German Pilsner! Will be having many more times this summer."
"Light yellow and bubbly. About a finger of head with good retention. Very floral and fruity hop mix with a solid amount of light bready Pilsner malt. The flavor has a lot of hop character for a Pilsner but it is great. Awesome balance of peppery, floral and fruity hops. A light straw malty body backs up this large amount of hops nicely. A lot of flavor and extremely drinkable."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of foamy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. The aroma has hints of malty sweetness and lots of grassy hops. The taste has some skinniness with grassy and earth hops thrown in and some malty sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated but finishes clean. Overall a decent pilsner."
"overall: good"
"O: Living near eastern PA, home of some of the best American-brewed pilseners, I was surprised and very pleased at this entry from Colorado. Siriusly good."
"O: A decent Pils and blows away macro stuff. But a little tame for me compared to a Prima. Drinkable but at the same pricepoint would take a Victory PP instead on most occasions."
"The beer is well crafted and has not problems but I will avoid it in the future."
"Really easy-drinking pilsner with some nice hop character and a little extra touch of malt sweetness for fullness and balance."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are all smooth and well balanced. While on the lighter side, it does not feel empty or bland which is great."
"Nice pilsner, one of the better ones I've had, smell was a bit dank but unique spiciness that makes this one uplifting and refreshing."
"O: Seems like a great pilsener to me, though I'm no expert on the style. A great hops selection balanced with a nice malt profile and some interesting citrus flavors going on. Reviewed from one bottle out of a mix and match pack, I'd go back and grab a sixer of this, especially in the summer."
"D: Easily one of the best American versions of a pilsner out there. Drinkable."
"Bender Factor: This pilsner is six pack worthy. Hit the spot, refreshing after a day in the blazing Albuquerque sun. Could see plenty of these going down in no time at all and waking up snuggling a cactus."
"Beer is nothing super special, but it is a pils and as that it is a good one. Highly drinkable and will get it again."
"Overall, a delicious and refreshing beer, easy to session, and one I'll return to gladly!"
"The mouthfeel is a little bit too thick, but perfectly carbonated, and the drinkability is rather good. Overall, this is just a solid pilsner out of the United States. Recommended, but not anything worth chasing down."
"I like it!"
"I like this beer, but on the take home scale I would have trouble justifying the extra cost for this pilsner. I would pass it up on the shelf."
"Pours clear pale golden in color. With a consistent white cap. Retention is great on this one though it doesn't leave much lacing. The nose is very grainy and grassy with lots of hop spiciness in the finish. Very clean smelling. Taste is grainy as well. Lots of wheat and a bit of a pepper spice. After taste is a little bitter and astringent, in a good way. Mouthfeel is bubbly and crisp with a good cleansing feeling to it. This beer is just plain good. Nothing to complex and mind blowing but well above average. It looks delicious and has very good color. It smells delicious, earthy and natural. It taste like it smells. It feels clean. Good stuff."
"The appearance is deep gold with not much head. The the aroma is grassy hops and corn like malt. The taste is like a pilsner should be with a good balance of malt and hops with the malt being almost bread like in taste. The palate is smooth. This one just gets you with taste because you are not expecting much by smelling it."
"**(with this typo, I coin a new term, 'l-rager',a portmanteau of 'lager' and 'rager', and a corruption of 'larger')"
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass.A cloudy Light yellow color with just a little bit of head. Low carbonation, but fine for the style. This beer has a bit of the straw aftertaste that is similar to the euro style. With its smooth consistency and relatively low alcohol percentage, this is a good session lager. A great beer for the warm weather."
"This is a easy drinking, great session beer that I will be sure to pick up the next time I host poker night. Much better than the mass-produced corn pilsners out there!"
"This beer pours a semi hazy pale golden color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is a balance of spicy hops, and bready malt. The taste is a bit maltier than the aroma, but I think that is a good thing. There is a nice bitterness that comes through in the finish. There is nothing on the back end of the taste though. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but there are much better pilsners out there."
"D: This was an ok beer overall. Not one I'd turn away, but not one I would seek out. It really didn't look too pretty. This paired with a lackluster aromatic profile and boring flavors made it just slightly above average."
"D- Decent brew, good to drink nothing spectcular though"
"The beer pours a very clear straw color with a large white head . The aroma is classic pilsner. I get a lot of lighter pilsner malts, as well as some honey and grass. About what I expected. The flavor is pilsner malt and a lot of grassy hops. Fairly hoppy for a pilsner. Medium bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. A nice, easy drinking pilsner."
"M/D: A good pilsner. Crisp and refreshing. I wish there was a bit more sweetness and hops though. Not as good as some of the German imports I usually buy though."
"Another shout-out to my brother's increasingly improving beer selections. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light corn, and what seems like powdered sugar (though, admittedly, this may be my glass...I just don't think so). The taste holds notes of light wheat, flowers, light greens, and a strong undercurrent of vinyl. Yowza. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a crisp finish. Overall, were it not for the rubbery bitterness pervading this thing, it would be a pretty nice pils. Alas..."
"All and all a pretty good beer, but im not a huge fan of the metalic taste."
"Bottle pours a clear pale yellow body with a two finger white head. Good retention and some grainy patch lacing. Aroma is a bit subdued but features spicy and grassy hops, a hint of lemon, and a solid pils malt biscuity malt base. Light to light medium in body and well carbonated. Taste is pleasantly balanced between the slightly sweet biscuity malt base and the grassy and spicy hop bitterness. A hint of lemon underneath. Finishes clean and even. Another solid American made pilsener that is tasty and highly drinkable."
"While definitely good, I could use a bigger aroma on this beer, that was my main gripe. Also, while I didn't mind the bit of sweetness in the finish, the beer was not as crisp and refreshing as it could be."
"DB- Balanced and enjoyable. It has a nice hop profile that works well with the light body and smooth carbonation. Definitely a beer worthy of sessioning as well."
"The taste is very crisp, clean and bitter. It is pretty straightforeward, but that is what you are looking for in this style. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, dries out your mouth. Excellent beer to drink with dinner because the hops contrast with the flavours of the food. Pretty decent job Left Hand."
"Pours a really nice and light yellow color with some visible carbonation bubbles. Nice fluffy white head. The nose brings some light floral and Noble hops along with a bit of grain. The taste is grainy with a nice bitterness level, which carries over and really creates a nice mouthfeel. Drinks quite well overall; I'm a big fan. Cheers, Left Hand."
"By far one of the best and most drinkable lagers brewed in the US today; one that gives the German Pilsners a real run for their money--and not on freshness alone. A heaping bowl of piping-hot chili verde will do the trick for a pairing."
"OVERALL: Interesting beer. After detecting some unfamiliar flavors in the taste, maybe I should sit down with a full six-pack of this sometime and give it another try. Maybe I'll be able to focus more on how I feel about it rather than what it is. Of course, it is a pilsner and has many of the characteristics, but it almost seems as though it was a wild/sour pils."
"a pretty well place pilsner on the side of midd but with a0ext cool quality to it. Bright golden yellow with a finger and a half of head but a sufficient carbonation and steady bubbles coming up to the surface. Nose of hops and bitter munich malt on the side of a decent straw but somewhat one dimensional. Palate is that exactly. Bitter crisp and screams for a fatty salted meat. Quite german by popular standard but would drink more than one."
"Verdict: Polestar is a solid, though generally unexciting, German Pilsener. It's not going to set the world on fire, but Pilsener fans looking for something new shouldn't be disappointed."
"Pours a very light golden straw yellow. A thin, but sticky white head hangs around. Smell is biscuity goodness, and a little sweet. Taste is clean, fresh.. bready, with just a hint of sweetness, and a nice, mildly hoppy and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium, and just right for the style. Ridiculously easy to drink; a very good pilsener."
"Opinion: Well, overall this is a pretty good beer. It is a bit like an IPA with Pilsner ingredients in the way it comes across the palate and maybe this can be solved by simply having a little more carbonation. I expect a Pilsner (German style) to be a little drier in the finish and this one has some sweetness and hops that never stop. Regardless, I will gladly drink all of the six-pack that I got, but I am not sure how much I will be buying it going forward."
"D - High. The German Pilsner is alive and well. Lawnmower session for sure."
"Surprisingly drinkable. The citrus really saves this beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Could suck these down one after another."
"Overall a decent pilsner, would be nice with fatty or oily food, so it's a good bar food beer but not something I'd reach for that often."
"Drinkability: I was so surprised by this one, as I usually don't go for pilseners. This one has totally changed my outlook on this style. Another worthy one from Left Hand."
"D: Overall, Left Hand did a pretty solid job with this beer. Although it's light, and mild in flavor, it's quite refreshing and very drinkable."
"A little drier than most too, not much sweetness present at any point. Light in body with a creamy feel from the abundant carbonation. Easy drinking and very pleasant, just not super-interesting. A fine example of the style."
"left hand brewing company--polestar pilsner--Malt Liquor--2010 12 oz. bottle. 5.50% ABV. 33 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Rich lacy white long lasting head. Clear pretty bright yellow gold color. Rich buttery hop Saaz? Magnum? front. Mildly creamy mellow sweet snappy butter caramel Pils malt crisp richly flavored body. Lingering malt mild bitter hop refreshing nourishing end. Sampled 8/22/2010. 6-Pack $9.75."
"Pours straw-colored with a nice two and a half finger billowy head, with little activity to support it. The retention is okay and the lacing is pretty good. It has a strong floral and citrus hop smell with yeast notes in there. The taste is dry and hoppy with bready flavors. This pils has got a light body and light carbonation and is just a pleasure to drink. I enjoyed this pilsner quite a bit."
"D- Overall, I didn't really care for this one and probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Very drinkable...sitting on the porch."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer, but I have had better pils living in czech."
"Maybe it's the spaghetti I ate for dinner, but there's something starchy about this beer that just doesn't sit right with me. I wouldn't dissuade someone from trying this beer, but I would urge them to partake with caution. Not impressed."
"F: Finishes still partially sweet but mostly dry, with that lingering bitter taste that doesn't play too well. It hurts the drinkability of what should be very crisp and refreshing, although it does have it's crisp and refreshing taste. A touch of lingering toasty malts and wheat."
"D.- real easy drinker nice complexity but not real intense. Cool label-Great Beer.Try it Out!"
"I am absolutely amazed how authentic German this American-made pilsner is!!"
"D - This is a nicely made, dry German style pilsner with an emphasis on the hop character. An excellent hop presence in both aroma and flavor with a dry, but rich malt profile to back it up. This is one to add to the short list of authentic and enjoyable American made pilsners."
"Golden appearance with a very white 2 finger head. Good lacing and retention throughout. Slight grassy and lemon aroma. Not very strong. Flavor follows. Semi-sweet up front with some lemon flavor. Grassy hops and bready malt notes. Malt overpowers the hops here, especially as you get into the beer. Good crisp mouthfeel."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, pilsner malt scent along with a slightly grainy, bitter aroma. It's lightly hopped and basic in malt composition. The taste is decent as well. It has a light pilsner malt flavor with just a hint of Munich malt sweetness. The German hops provide adequate bitterness. It's easy drinking with little off-flavors. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good example of the German pilsner style. It's a bit less complex than some authentic version, but it's easy drinking and enjoyable."
"D: So i think this one is pretty weak for left hand brewery. Not much going on with flavor. However it is easy to drink, and could be drank on a hot day of fishing, cause its kind of like water. i wouldn't buy it again."
"Notes: Easy to drink, I just don't like it."
"Poured a light clear gold with decent head and some lace patches on the glass. Has an earthy, breezy hop smell that is light and non distinct. Taste is alright w/ a decent pils malt taste along with minor citric flavor and a little bit of chewiness. Goes down easy and finishes nice and crisp. A good summer beer to relax with."
"This is what all of the big macros need to be. No corn overtones here. Just the nice bitter finish from the style."
"Light body, cleaner finish. Easy drinking, but a couple and I'd be looking for more depth. Worth trying."
"Notes: This is a tasty and very drinkable German Pilsner. Cheers."
"Taste:easy on the palate, and all the way down. Nice little display of hops up front, then it fades back, and the mellow malt takes over. Slight lemon/citrus flavor, hangs in the back of the throat. Quite a quencher, this, goes down so easy. Just enough flavor to make it worth drinking. I don't often reach for pilsners, but if you're looking for one, I'd recommend the Polestar."
"eh. drinks ok. I'd rather not, however. it's not a terribly crafted beer, but I'm glad I bought only one of these."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with an airy amount of carbonation."
"D-very easy to drink but the phenol taste detracts from the beer itself and makes it less enjoyable."
"With all the better examples out there I don't think i'll see this one in my glass again any time soon."
"D: Highly drinkable...I'm not sure there is reason to come back for more of this, but its good."
"Good beer and I will be sure to try it again."
"D: Very good overall. Everything is in balance, not unlike a macro lager, but without any minor offensive flavors."
"D - Overall this is a fairly average pilsener nothing really bad about it I just wouldn't pick this one up as my first choice"
"A very solid American brewed German pils beer."
"When poured into a glass, it has a very nice head- nearly 2 fingers- and leaves nice lacing as it subsides. Crystal clarity, straw color. Aroma, not much beyond some cereal. Flavor also bland and cereal. Finish leaves a hint of creaminess but nothing that lingers. This is not a beer made to impress. I guess it was made as a session beer, or just something you can pound without the nuisance of tasting anything. PIlsners can be great, but this one seems happy with just not being offensive. Given BudMillerCoors or this, I'd drink it again. Otherwise it'll be a long time before I bother with this one again."
"Polestar is a perfect Session Beer."
"drinkability is good - reasonably priced and solid flavors but overall nothing to put it up there witht the best"
"D- That's a tough question. This wouldn't be the first beer I reach for, nor one that I select just when I want to have one beer to enjoy the taste. But if it was a beer for later on, or all I had sure. So that's hard to say really, good...with conditions."
"Good color and carbonation. Forgetable aroma mouthfeel and drinkablity."
"Overall- Light, sweet, and crisp. A good warm weather beer."
"I have been drinking a fair amount of this lately and find it just is perfect for the hot summer. A very refreshing and full flavored brew to sit and relax with at the end. Of course I did the same thing at times during the winter also."
"Overall a pretty good pils. A weak flavor and just the slightest hint of a metallic/macro brew taste bring the score down a little."
"Bleached white, creamy looking microfoam, pours big and then holds on very well at about half finger level, even the sticky lacing looks foamy. Quite clear and transparent yellow-orange color, no visual match for the head. Very bready nose, neither uncooked nor too sour in nature, like a big loaf of white bread, the lemon peel about as bitter as anything gets, this said, the malts seem muted and submerged in general grassiness, no real fruit scents to speak about. Medium-bodied, not as lightweight as you'd think while still keeping a steady pace moving forward. The fizz is pretty damn active and does contribute to the overall weight. Bready and crusty, pretzel-like with more of a sourness here (duh, sourness is related to taste not the olfactory sense but, hey, it all makes sense in the end). Grassiness not as biting, though, and the lemon citrus toned down too. Touch of peach to apricot pit, skin for fruit. Stays square shouldered through the finish, no wimping out at the end. Not complex by any measure but one might guess that it was made more for hot weather chugging than contemplation."
"Very nice big 2 finger head, light golden color. Smells like Corona. Tastes better though. Good mouthfeel, just the right amount of body for a light beer. Overall I'd say it's a decent summer beer but I wouldn't buy it often."
"Nice, crisp, and dry. Wonderful light body. Refreshing and highly drinkable, but when paired with food it tastes like soapy chemicals."
"Drinkability: A highly sessionable pils that I could have in any season. This is a little on the sweet side. Another winner from one of my favorite breweries."
"Mouthfeel was on the thinner side. Moderate carbonation."
"This beer pours a perfect look. Just the right shade of golden with a nice thick head. Could not help but notice the born on date. Smudged, it showed a little over a month ago. Then, the smell. I smelled that smell before and I cursed the day when I first smelt it. The smell is a dead ringer for Milwaukee's Best, The Beast. The salty smell was overwhelming. Being hopeful with the looks, I took a drink. The salty beast was all over it, though I remember The Beast (been over 10 years) to be worse. Not smooth in the mouth or going down. After drinking the beer, which was good enough to finish but it is rare that I would ever not finish a beer, I needed a drink of water to kill the taste out of my mouth. Assessment, if you are dirt poor and want to get drunk to drown your worries, drink something cheaper."
"M&D- Damn good. High carbonation and a light body make a drinkable lager. Body is light without being airy."
"12 ounce bottle with bottled on dating printed on the front label. Pours light and clear, golden uner a nice looking fine white, leaving plenty of fine lace. Grassy is how I would describe the moderatly pungent nose. Pleasant, easy drinking lager, with wiffs of lime, more grass with some snappy and quite dry hops sealing the deal. Thirst quenching, crisp and dry. Respectable sessioner. Nice for a summer lunch."
"This is about what I expected, although I really didn't know for sure. Poured up a nice, pale straw colour with a very large, snow white head that stayed in place for about 90 seconds. It then subsided to about a half-inch blanket throughout the remainder of the drink. It laced the sides of the glass nicely. Smell was much lighter than I though it would be, consisting mostly of a grassy smell with maybe a hint of freshly sliced apple hiding deep down. Taste is *not* BMC, but it *is* very light, and I am unsure how best to describe it. There *are* hops present, but they're very modest. Everything about this beer is very mild; it's quite refreshing, really. Highly drinkable, IMO, and probably my favourite ""craft pilsner"" to date. I like Victory Prima, but it almost reminds me of an IPA. This is much more subtle and what I think of when I think of pilsner."
"This is probably the best Left Hand beer that I have tried so far. Something I could drink all day. Recommended for a summer day, BBQ, or just to quaff a few at the bar."
"Very clear golden color, zero haze. Large four finger head that went quick. Kind of lemony smell with some strong alcoholic undertones. Nice bitter taste thats very refreshing. I think this is pretty average compared to other pilsners I've had. Sort of hoppiness that leaves the mouth feeling dry. Overall a clean refreshing pilsner that is good but not great."
"The taste is on the sweet side for a lager, the beer is quite smooth, there isn't the prickly mouthfeel of say a Czech lager, there is some sweet malts throughout, and lots of lemony citrus flavors. Things dry out a bit in the finish and there is some slightly drying hop bitterness there. This is a very light beer that doesn't distinguish itself in anyway. It has a slight perfumey character, not creamy at all, not mouth puckering nor prickly, overall sweet, light, smooth and easy to drink. It isn't an overly carbonated pilsner either."
"Overall a good, crisp and dry pils. The flavor is basic. The texture is soft & airy. The crisp and dryness of this beer is great. A good rendition of a Bitburger if I do say so. Good job Left Hand."
"Overall, meh...I could drink a few of these while mowing the lawn or tailgating something. I'm not a huge fan of this style so it would take a lot to make me change that."
"The drinkability here is just ok, a decent beer overall."
"Drinkability: I enjoy a pilsner just like the next guy, but I must say this one isn't doing anything spectacular for me. Not saying I won't drink them, but just nothing spectacular."
"Poured cloudy with a light yellow appearance with a good head that went away quick and slight lace. Almost no scent, a little of the malt used, not much else. Slightly bitter wash, a little thicker and a bit fruity in the end. Well, this was about as Pils standard as it gets. Clean, a little bitter from the hops, great, big malt taste with alcohol in the background. Overall, another wonderful bottled Pilsner."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a drinkable style. Nothing wrong with this beer - if there was it would stick out."
"Overall, not a good beer for me. As I said above, it's more the style than the beer. If you like this style then this is probably a good one to try. For me, one and done. Only had this one since it was part of a mix pack. I'd honestly rather have a BMC than a German Pilsener."
"Overall, nothing special, but a good example of the style."
"D- An enjoyable beer but not memorable in the slightest."
"Drinkability - Decent beer in a pinch, but not something I would venture to drink again, or a lot of."
"Drinkablity is this beer's main feature, especially when combined with hearty and heavy food; similar to how certain wines blossom when paired with a meal. I feel that if I had gotten a fresher bottle, my experience with Polestar would have been better."
"Overall drink ability of beer is above average. Would be a good substitute for a light lager on a hot day. Nothing too impressive but would drink again"
"Date consumed: 3 September 2008"
"Mouthfeel is light, and the carbonation is scrubbing. This would be a good aperitif beer."
"Pours a light yellow with a touch of cloudiness. On top sits a three finger cap of white fluff that resembles melting Styrofoam,a nice amount of chunky lace is left behind as it ever so slowly recedes. The nose is a bit understated,mostly floral and subtle grainy notes. This is pretty dead on the style,as far as the pallet goes this is slightly sweet with just the right touch of graininess and hop bitterness. This has a slightly skunked finish that gives it that traveled beer feeling. The mouthfeel is light with carbonation that is semi creamy,and a drying finish. A nice German Pils and I think this could stand up with the best of them."
"Very pale look for a pilsner. More like a wit than a pilsner. Cloudy white/lemon yellow body. Pure white cap. On the nose, there's a nice blend of floral hop notes and bready malts. Flavor brings more of the same. The bready and biscuity malt notes, with a little sweet graininess as well. Hops add some floral notes and grassiness. I'm guessing Saaz was at least part of the hopping schedule. Good thirst quencher. Active carbonation level and medium stature to this beer. Quite agreeable overall."
"A fairly nice cut at a pilsner, but I wouldn't seek it out in the summer heat."
"Blah! What a boring pilsener. Pour was a light gold with no head and no bubbles. Aroma was almost nothing. I blew my nose and tried again...nothing; so it's not my allergies. Taste was a semi carbonated mix of corn, grain and grass. A little biscuit in the aftertaste. Very watery and thin. Nothing to remember."
"D - The lightness and crispness would make it a decent session brew, however, for my taste and money there are better ones out there."
"Drinkability: Pilsners are not really my thing and they have to be rather special to bowl me over and this one is about average. Nothing great, nothing terrible, a decent beer for those who don't enjoy a more robust brew."
"Very Very drinkable. A nice session beer."
"D - Good all around anytime drink."
"The aroma reminds me of a Belgian pale ale, for some odd reason, with grassy hops. The flavor lacks the dry biscuit character of most great pilsners and the mouthfeel isn't as dry. The hops are also more American with grapefruit and citrus rind. So it's a lot more like an American Pale Ale, not a pils, which isn't necessarily bad, just different for the style. I'd rather be tasting hops that nothing. Worth a try."
"d: pretty much what I expected. A good pilsner, great for mindless consumption, but nothing to sit down and contemplate."
"A sip reveals plenty of flavor from crystal malts and Noble hops. The aftertaste is full of satisfying bitterness and the texture is smooth and carries the taste well. This is a quality German style pilsner and a good last gasp for summer beers as we head into the fall."
"I would say that while it isn't fantasticly complex it is a good session or crossover beer."
"Drinkability is nice and easy, sort of like water."
"Not the classic flavor or smell, this is still a very good beer that will refresh you better than any macro after a long day of mowing the lawn."
"Mouthfeel is light as it should be with some carbonation. This beer is amazingly drinkable. it all goes down super smooth and still maintains a great amount of flavor throughout."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style, but Left Hand does it well. Another solid offering."
"This is one of the better pilsners that I've had the chance to taste. I typically find pilsners to be a little bare in terms of flavor and sometimes a bit on the watery side, but this one seems to tell convention to ""shove it."" The beer is pretty well balanced, but I was quite happy that the citrus character was accentuated a bit more than the hops. This easily makes the brew something that I would love to consume when it gets too hot. It's pretty light, but the folks at the Left Hand Brewing Co. don't skimp out on the flavor to make the brew more drinkable."
"I'm a big fan of the pilsner type style and this is quite a dissapointment."
"I would probably buy this one again, if I really needed a refreshing beer."
"Maybe it's me, but Left Hand brews always leave me wanting a bit more flavor. This one is unoffensive and pleasant enough, and I wouldn't have a problem recommending it to those who aren't quite ready for full-figured beers."
"A friend of mine put together a sampler, and this is the second to last of the batch. The beer pours a clear yellow-gold with a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving little rings of lacing behind in my pilsner glass. It's a bold pilsner malt flavor, with a mild hop bite, a bit of hops present midway as well, a bit chalky and metallic in the finish. It's a dry, light body that is made a bit creamier with the carbonation. It's not a bad beer at all and is pretty drinkable. It has a classic style and can be enjoyed for a bit."
"D-First real disappointment with Left Hand, but on the other hand this is just not my style of beer. Tried to be objective nonetheless."
"Picked this up as part of a boxed set of different micro-brews. Poured a clean golden yellow with abundant head that soon diminished to pencil thin. The lacing around the glass stuck for the duration of the beer. Real good hoppy aroma. The flavor captures the typical pilsner essence, hoppy with a slight bite at the end. Very crisp and clean, easily drinkable. This is a relatively basic pilsner, not bad at all."
"One of the better offerings of the style. Nice light and tasty, sessionable pils."
"pours a very pale light lager color, looks about as clear as bud light, but has a pure white head that stays around for almost the entire beer. Smell is kinda skunky with a very light maltiness. tate is average, pretty standard lager overall. its an average beer i suppose"
"D: Interesting take on a Pils. I could see myself having several of these."
"Polestar Pilsner pours a yellow color with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a nice, hoppy aroma. There is a nice, spicy hop flavor with the malt in the background. I wouldn't call this a traditional German pils, but it's very nice."
"Overall- I have a feeling this can be a great beer but that tin taste just ruined it. I'd like to try it on draught."
"Lively carbonation, great mouthfeel. Highly drinkable on a hot day -- as most pilsners are. Certainly one I'll reach for during the summer months, but there are better pilsners out there..."
"Light, easy to drink, clean flavors, a touch of grain. There are other pilsners I would choose before this one but I wouldn't kick this one out of bed."
"Surprisingly a mouthful... big, biscuity malt character with the slightest essence of caramel is neatly finished by a nice dry bitterness. Crisp and clean with fantastic drinkability."
"D: Absolutely. Does what it sets out to do and tastes pretty good in the process. Will pick up again."
"Nathaniel presented this to me with a big, fluffy, bone-white head with decent retention. The color was a pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a really pleasant Saaz hops snap. The mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a great Saaz hops presence on the tongue. The finish was not as strong as it had been in the mouth, but it still evidenced as much hops as I had experienced over the course of a long, blazingly hot day. It was a welcome experience."
"This one pours very clear, dark straw color with a moderate white head. The aroma is moderately malty with noticeable spicy hoppyness. The flavor is a bit sweet and malty upfront with moderate bitterness and spicy hop flavor emerging at the swallow. The finish is crisp with a bit of lingering hop. Body is medium and moderate carbonation. Overall a good looking very tasty Pilsner."
"Picked up a sixer from Central Market. Poured the beer into a pint glass. It had a nice golden clear color, but the head had no retention. Grainy malt aroma. At first the beer tasted syrupy, but finished dry. Not bad, not great. The mouthfeel was the best thing in this pilsner. It had a nice fizz, yet overall was pretty smooth. Although this is not exactly the pilsner I was hoping for, it was fairly drinkable. Easy to knock back, mostly due to the mouthfeel."
"Appears a brilliant light pale golden hue with a large foamy white head. With each sip streaks of scattered lacing are left behind. The smell is nice spicy herbal hops flowing with grassy and citrus notes galore, lightly toasted biscuit with honey malt sweetness with a touch of mineral water notes going on as well. Flavor is balanced yet has an assertive hoppiness to it more herbal grass with citrus peels on the palate with a semi sweet lightly toasted two row cereal malt flavor with hints of crackers with honey drizzled on it. Mouthfeel has sturdy carbonation with a dry finish from the hop bitterness perfect German style pils. Drinkability is all day a nice summer offering that I hope to catch more of, I realized that the folks at Left Hand know how to brew lagers after trying their Ofest this past season, it was definitely one of my favorites I got to try."
"Pours a clear straw colored yellow. Very few bubbles and just an asymetrical film of foam on the top of the beer. Hardly any lacing. Light, crisp, and dry pilsner malt wth a littl herbal hop aroma well blended. The taste is a simple medium malt with notes of dried fruit upfront, but the hops give just a toch of grass and lemon. Very well balanced tasting pilsner. Very refreshing and crisp palate. Hits the spot while you wait for your dinner to cook after a hard summer days work."
"pours a regular transparent straw color. but a decent white head. lacing falls quick. aroma is slight crisp hops. taste is light malt backbone. more-so than the light hop crispness. most importantly, its not a skunky pils!!!"
"This is a summer beer, or rather this is one you reach for when you are thirsty! This beer makes you want to wash the car in shorts and flip-flops! Or better yet get out the chips and shuffle the cards! I like to think this is what the orginal American beer used to taste like. Maybe a time machine this beer!"
"I prefer a stronger beer, but this one did surprise me. A solid beer, and I can't complain about that."
"Impressive body - it's thick and smooth while maintaining good carbonation. Soft malt is toasty with biscuit tones and a touch of honey-crisp sweetness. Hops balance the malt with prominent bitterness and modest flavor - tart and floral mostly, not unlike a bright white wine. Touch of alcohol. More sweetness."
"Aroma is fairly strong, malty, with a whisper of citrus. My nose was a little stopped up by hay fever, but I still got a good whiff. It pours a typical clear straw-yellow with a thick, white head that dissipates fairly quickly - about average for a pils. Flavor is a little fuller than most pilsners I have tried, with a firm hop component and some bitterness in the aftertaste. I prefer darker and more flavorful beers, but this one is fine by me."
"D - A very average and forgettable pils. Not bad, but definitely not very good."
"the last of my LH sampler ; pours a clear yellow-gold w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving little rings of lacing behind in my pils glass ; a sweet cereal grain smell, some floral noble hops and a touch of adjunct twang ; a bold pilsn malt flavor, w/ a mild hop bite, a bit of hops present midway as well, a bit chalky and metallic in the finish ; a dry, light body made a bit creamier by the ample level of co2 ; not a bad beer at all, quite drinkable and a decent rep. of a classic style, on par w/ any euro-macro for sure..."
"D_Very drinkable American Pilsener. I would have a few more if possible. Thanks to pimpp for the sample."
"WHAT A GREAT BEER I WILL MOST ASSUREDLY BUY IT AGAIN"
"good carbonation. medium body. leaves nice lace. good drinking beer. has a smoothness to it. i could do a session. i may buy again. follows style."
"D: A good warm weather beer, but not my favorite style. I prefer a more pronounced malt background and Pacific NW hops."
"D: A nice, drinking beer. Good taste; crisp, light, and refreshing mouthfeel and nice, slightly malty taste made it a nice beer overall and very enjoyable. It reminded me of Pilsner Urquell a little bit."
"light to medium gold colored with a lasting white head. Very active carbonation. Smell is sweet grainy malt. Simple but nice. Taste is sweet and malty, with very little yeasty flavor and a balancing bitter zing to it. Ends somewhat sweet. Nice body, and bubbly mouthfeel. Simple and refreshing. Nice pilsner and great for a warm day like today."
"Overall not a bad pilsner at all. Nothing really earth shattering here, but still a very solid effort. I would most certainly not turn this one down if offered it again, especially with the warm weather approaching."
"The taste is grassy/grainy. A bit chalky, with a metallic aftertaste. Sweet with a touch of bitter. Crisp, though not a big fan of the flatish, metallic aftertaste."
"d - good clean taste. Maybe a little too much hops, but overall a decent beer."
"D: A great session beer. I could have several of these. It doesn't wow me though, so it's not perfect."
"Probably a step down from the Prima Pils class, but still a very good American-style German pilsner."
"D - Good brew, definately will join my session beer line up."
"Into a pilnser glass, this is a pale bright gold color with a moderate but lasting head of foam. Nose is sweet malt, a little grassy hops, and, very oddly for a pilsner, a light fruitiness. Nice flavor (the fruitiness I kept detecting in the nose is not present), with lightly sweet malt and a moderately high bitterness. Lots of hop flavor tending floral. Clean finish."
"Good stuff, worth a shot, but not the best depiction of the style or sample from Left Hand..."
"A clean Very pale yellow beer. Has a nice thick white head and a nice bit of lace. The aroma has a light biscuit malt character with grassy and lemon notes. The taste starts with a light floral hop bite on the tip of your tongue. The middle has plenty of easygoing grassy and lemony notes flowing around and the finish goes back to that nice floral hop note. Quite refreshing."
"Overall, an excellent Pilsner that's light and refreshing without being dull."
"Overall- Not a fan of pilsners, so I don't like it too much. It is true to style, not straying at all, but not my favorite of styles. I would rather have a Miller Lite if I wanted a Pilsner, and I dont like that either."
"Some stingy carbonation, but not completely out of line for the style. Great American Pilsener in a more traditional style that say, Prima Pils."
"Drinkability: Fairly accurate to style and reasonably refreshing. Pretty good for a pilsner."
"D: drinkability was good. A touch dry and increased hopping adds some depth."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filing at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to pound away several of over the course of an evening."
"Drinkability: A decent domestic pils; quite Germanic"
"Don't drink and review."
"Even on a subfreezing day, coming home a bit hot and tired this went down very easy and I promptly went looking for something similar. The mouthfeel is medium and carbonation appropriate - nothing spectacular, nothing to detract either, just right where it should be. Overall just a great beer."
"Pours into a pilsner glass slightly cloudy and golden starting with a big fluffy head which dissipates but leaves good lacing. The sent is slightly floral with a light hint of lemon and some bready grains. Taste starts off bitter with some light malts and finish with a bit of a hop bite. The mouthfeel is just right for a sesionable beer, and the drinkability is their although the flavor is less intriguing then the smell."
"I got this case from Rick in Alexandria after seeing it highly rated in a NYTimes review. It pours slightly cloudy, pale gold, lots of bubbles coming up. The soft fluffy head dissapates after a bit but leaves a ring. There's a slight flowery aroma with a bit of malt but it's not a great nose. It tastes very flavorful, nice malt/hops balance. It's soft in the mouth and goes down wonderfully. I think this is a somewhat better beer than the average rating indicates."
"Pretty spot on for the style this is a lot like a drier version of Bitburger. I could see buying this a lot it was distributed here in California."
"Overall: I would have liked a couple more of these, would definitely try again."
"D: Good example of the style and plenty drinkable. But there are many others that are better and two are with 15 miles of my house."
"D: Very easy to drink and tastier than an everyday macro. Could make a great session brew and highly recommended for a gateway beer."
"Taste mimics the aroma. Light and crisp and refreshing. Hop bitterness is nice. Great balance, although the mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired. Kind of thin. Dry in the finish. Drinkability is up there. This is a nice, light beer that can go well with just about any occasion. I will definitely get more next summer."
"I am really surprised at how much I enjoyed this one. I am normally not big into pilsners but can't deny this one. A nice one from Left Hand indeed!"
"Extremely drinkable. More than a lawnmower beer, still this beer is the kind that could convert your Bubba friends to throw away the mass-produced yellow fizzy water...."
"This just doesn't do it for me. It needs a little more malt balance, and the grassy hop bite by itsellf just isn't enough."
"Drinkability: A very easy to drink German Pilsner. Probably not a benchmark for the style, but who cares? This is just a good beer. I would gladly purchase a 6 pack."
"A classic pilsner taste with a slightly bitter taste with a little malt in the aftertaste. With all the emphasis on hoppy ales, i.e. IPAs by American brewers, it is nice to see a traditional, well made lager, especially a pilsner. I would choose this over most of the imported pilsners. It is doubtful one could buy an import that was bottled less than a month before."
"This beer poured a clear straw yellow with a thick head. The aroma is initially of hops followed by slightly floral or citrus notes. The taste is hoppy and bitter, with a dry semi-sweet aftertaste. The bitterness is noticed throughout. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Overall, this is an easy drinking pilsner. This might make a good introductory beer to someone wishing to learn more about tasting."
"IMO, hopping is a bit too aggressive as a Bavarian pils, this is more in line with a Bohemian Pils. I scored this as a Bohemian."
"Not a bad beer, in spite of slightly lower than average rating - don't ask me to explain. Nice light gold color, slight head, smidgen of lace. Well (maybe over) carbonated. Good body and some sweetness to compensate the bitterness. But the bitterness does contribute for a very long finish. Found a very slight hint of elemental sulfur in the nose. - fleeting, but there. Nevertheless, drinkable"
"Not remarkable, but worthwhile."
"Pours a pale straw color with a nice soapy white head. The aroma is pretty non-existant, some grassy hop and grain. The taste has a dry hoppiness to it, grainy, a slight cooked veggie taste. The feel is light and watery, a bit astringent. An average pils, it has the base pilsner taste but doesn't go the distance. Worth a try and a good summer brew."
"Watery pils flavor, quite sweet with a little lemon zest. Earthy hopping. Mouthfeel is about right for the style. Easy to drink, not a bad pilsener, relatively true to style and tasty."
"Recommended"
"It's light bodied and well carbonated, seems a bit unbalanced, kind of chalky and acidic. Not that drinkable, just do the misaligned flavor profile. Not one of the better offerings from LH."
"after finishing the glass I might have had another, but I mixed my own six pack and I only got one of these."
"Very crisp with a fairly strong bitterness. Not so clean, however. Could stand to be a little bit drier with a tad less of a doughy, biscuity malt flavor. Oh, and the DMS of course. Get that boil rolling, guys! Other than that, it's a decent lager, but nothing I would rush out to buy again. A good pils is hard to come by, but when a good one does come along, rest assured I'll snatch it up. As for this one, it's more of a ""try it once and pass"" beer."
"D - Pretty good beer, but not fabulous. It is nice to fine a pils with a little bit of hops in it."
"Got this brew in a mixed 12 pack, the brew poured to a golden color with a nice sized white head, which left a fair amount of lacing at the top of the glass and had retention through out. Over all a nice looking brew. The aromas, while not overly exciting where inviting, had a clean crisp scent of light sweat pilsner type malt with a spice from the hops, saaz? As I said it is an inviting brew, nothing to write home about but pretty solid. The taste seems to be on par with the aroma, nothing extraordinary about it but an easy drinking brew, one that I could spend an afternoon or evening drinking. Taste seems to be similar to the aroma, which a sweet feel up front which quickly breaks away to a spicy and grassy hop taste that lingers while on the back of the mouth. The taste seems to slightly bring more to the game that the aroma. Over all I think that this is a solid brew, very enjoyable easy drinking Pils."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with almost no head that quickly diminishes to just a ring. The aroma is of pale malt with very mild floral hops. The taste was of very pale malt balanced by a light hop bitterness. A little on the bland side. The beer is very light on the palate and the carbonation is a little on the heavy side. I must say, I really did not enjoy this beer. I'm not that big a fan of pilsners, and this reminds me why."
"Cheers!"
"Pale straw, with a golden sheen. Puffy, cottony white head. Funky, herbal, Saaz-y hop nose up front along with light buttered toast, biscuit malt, and honey. Spritzy mouthfeel reveals light biscuit malt flavors, a drizzle of honey, and a decent dose of hops. Hop flavor is vegetal, herbal, and a little skunky. Sufficiently balanced, but a little blah. Clean and well made, but nothing to shout about. Light bodied and quaffable."
"Nothing special. Probably pretty tasty on a hot summer day if really cold....Only caveat is that it may be a bit old based on the bottling date."
"Very drinkable. Would be a nice session beer."
"Drinkability: so-so in my book. This is a bit weak overall, and there are many better German style Pils beers on the market."
"I really had no idea what to expect from this beer. Left Hand can be all over the map in terms of quality and German pilseners can be hard to get exactly right. I'm impressed though. While it doesn't put a scare into the best of this style, Polestar Pilsner is a quality beer that knows where it's headed and how to get there."
"All told, it presents as a decently built pils, but the body is hollow and frail. With added structure and support, this could be standoutish. Presently, it sits at respectable."
"A decent brew, but nothing exciting. Many other pils to be had instead."
"Polestar is a hazy, pale golden with lots of carbonation. The tall head is slick, yet foamy. Aroma features plenty of saaz hop with an nice underlying sweetness. Flavor is more of the same, with hop being supported by a sweet malt. As this warms up the malt flavors become more pronounced. Drinkability is high. Overall: Polestar equals a good pilsner."
"It seems to me that the American microbreweries are getting better at this style. I am often trying more of these that I like. This beer is one of them. It's more malty in aroma, flavor, and texture than grainy. The hops add a spice, herbal, and earthy character without the bitey astringency. The beer is creamy and hold a good head retention until the end. Finsihes quite clean and crisp with a mild minty, green apple snap. Good summertime beer."
"D: Not my cup of tea. There are much better pilseners out there, although this one is a fairly inoffensive example of the style. Glad I just bought the single."
"The beer is of course initially quite cold. It adds to the refreshing character, which is welcome on this 100+ day, but it drowns out the flavor a bit. A touch of toasted malt character and a hint of grain sweetness round out what is otherwise a nice hoppy Pilsner. Lightly spicy, with a smooth herbal hop character and a nice, sharp bitterness in the finish. As the beer warms up a bit the malt character becomes a bit rounder, it adds a bit to the body of the brew and helps to mix with, and balance the bitterness in the finish. This is a nice Pilsner, in fact it is perfect for a hot day, as it is fairly light on the palate. It could perhaps use a bit more malt and hop character, but like I said it is nice and refreshing as is."
"Overall I wouldn't recommend it, it is a clean refreshing beer, but there is not much redeeming about it."
"-UF"
"12 oz. bottled on 3/22/06. It pours into the pilsner glass a thin pale yellow with a half inch white head that leaves some lace. It has an aroma of grains, hop spice and light skunk with a taste that is rather clean and flavorless. There are notes of musty hops, pale/toasted malts and a mild bitterness that hides in the back of the throat, leaving a short finish. It has a medium body and feels good enough, but overall it's not that great of an example, and I got bored of it rather quickly."
"Overall impression: Nice solid pilsener - drinkable and thirst-quenching. Great for the summer months to come."
"The beer as it sets in its Pilsner glass after pouring from the 12-ounce brown bottle is a luminous gold, with a modest bright white head which is creamy in texture, after its erosion, the lace forms a velum like curtain upon the glass. Nose is the prototypical Pilsner malt; sweet and clean, start is lightly sweet with a nice grain presence, the top light in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to moderate in acidity, the hops pleasingly mild and the aftertaste dry and long lasting. Personally, Lagers/Pilsners are not my favorite style, but I must say that I dont think theres a prettier sight than a Pilsner in its own glass, covered with condensation and the drops running down the glass, clearing a path so you can see that perfect gold body with its bright white head, to me this says BEER!"
"This will make a great beer or hot summer days."
"Quality, lawnmower kinda beer for those hot summer days. I suspect i'll revisit it then."
"Couldn't read the bottled on date on any of the bottles, space is just whited out...weird"
"Overall I felt this beer has quite a bit of similarity to the corn syrup flavor of the macro beers. That said, the hoppines does help to make this beer better than the average macro."
"Drinkability is fine, exactly what you would expect for a decent pilsner."
"this certainly hasn't won me over. Not recommended."
"This is a pretty simple, albeit good, beer. The cereal grains and husk don't quite mix with the floral hops and degree of bitterness, hampering the drinkability, and not quite akin to a quality pils."
"checking their website I find that only the Tabernash Pils is listed - somewhat odd. From its list of ingredients: Gambrinus Pale, Munich 90, Carapils, Pearl, Hersbrucker and two additions of Saaz for 26 IBUs - some repackaging seems like a definate posibility."
"Pours hazy pale golden-straw with a small fizzy white head that doesn't last long, not much lacing, light grassy and flowery aromas. Bready, grainy and buttery flavors . Light bodied with a soft lightly carbonated mouthfeel, something just not right about this pils, this is a fresh sample brewed on 06/15/05."
