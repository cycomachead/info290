"Nothing that breaks the mold, but a high quality outing."

"Pretty flavorful for a lighter alcohol content. Something to get when you want to be able to have more than just one or two."

"t/m/o - sweet malts.  herbal.  very crisp but carrying a thick lush flavor profile.  no hop presence, but really tasty pils...but what would you expect?  this is sierra nevada after all.  they continue to pump out benchmark beers for every style.  i foresee quite a bit of this in my future this summer.  really tasty pils.  very bready...love me a good pils."
"What are you doing?!?!?! This tastes like Carlsberg"
"Overall – A decent rather refreshing and very easy drinking pale ale. A nice summer brew, but other than that nothing too out of the ordinary."

"It has a rich golden hue and a good deal of foaming.  The smell is slightly twangy with a hint of floral.  The taste is very spicy hop up front, but with a good clean finish.  Great aftertaste.  This is the perfect beer for both a hot summer day and a hot bowl of chili.  I'm a fan of the German Pilsner style, and this one does it well."
"A nice change up for Spring Training in AZ. Taste definitely had some spice and some sweetness, good feel and happy w/ 5.2%."

"An enjoyable German Pilsner.  Its a bit grainy but other than that hits all of the style notes."
"A good clean pilsner. Just not my favorite style."
"Meh. Just tastes like a more full bodied version of the stuff I drank in college."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
"Clear, pale yellow with white head.  Not much in the aroma...nothing that stands out. Tastes like what one would expect from a Pilsner...goes down easy.  Overall this beer is ok, I would drink it again especially on a hot day but would not necessarily seek it out."
"Overall- A stellar pilsener with nice flavor. Easy drinking for sure. Nice malt to hop blending. Great pils!"
""
""
""

"A clear light gold with a dense, eggshell white head, choppy and with plenty of lace, this looks great. The nose is solid. Bright, snappy, doughy, lemony,a  touch dusty and with an intense hop oil and a ltitle bit of soap. The palate opens rather intensely bitter with a blend of mint, lemon peel, fresh herbs and some soap. Dough, honey, a little bread appear on the mid palate before a long, bitter and lemony finish take over. Soapy (again), this beer is light in body and pleasant on the palate. Crisp carbonation keeps this snappy and the combination of hop oils and bitterness is enjoyable, though not in the sense that the classics are."

""
""
"Final Thoughts: This is my first Sierra Nevada beer, and to be honest I'm shocked at how well this brewery is regarded, because this was a big disappointment. I guess you can't judge a beer by one offering, but this was not one that I can recomend."
"I'm a huge"

"From the 12 oz bottle into a proper pilsner glass, it’s an attractive golden clear color with a thick white head of tight bubbles that fades at a moderate pace leaving a small amount of sticky lacing and a thin cap/collar.  Decent precipitating carbonation.  Nose is bready and a bit sweet.  In the mouth not too bubbly but certainly crisp, smooth and quenching.  Taste is bready malted barley nicely balanced against hops.  Clean finish.  Overall a pretty solid pilsner; nothing to write home about but decent.  Would try again."
""
""
""

"So good. Grassy, grainy, slight bitterness on the back end that dissipates quickly. I'd definitely get this again. I hope to try it on tap some day. :)"
"Overall: I think SN hit the nail on the head with this one. It's pretty much exactly what I expect from a pilsner. A full range of flavors, from the light but important malt base to the classic pilsner hops finish, and an overall lightness that goes down easy."
"Lite gold draft with thin white head. Buttered biscuits notes. Floral start with hop bite on the finish. Lite mouthfeel and zesty tongue coating. Interesting finish and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer.  A gem.  When judged as a flavorful, somewhat light lager, this is the real deal and delivers a classic beer drinking experience.  I had this the same day with two other pilsners I really like and respect, and Nooner beat them both.  I'm not being too picky about ""German Pilsner"" being the benchmark for this, since it is better than any German pilsner I have had.  It's just a damn good lager beer."
""
""
"An excellent example of the style, just a tiny bit off on color and clarity. A bit more citrusy than I'd expect for a pils as well, but a very enjoyable, easy drinking lager that I expect to revisit often once summer arrives."
""
""
"Reminds me of Budweiser or Miller Light! (It is a German style pilsner though, as advertised. Just didn't think I'd hate it as much as I do)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall very tasty beer."
""
"Great presentation of the style. Overall, a truly classic, highly drinkable pilsener. Great job as usual SN."
""
"Labeled as a Pilsner, it tastes like an IPA. Sierra Nevada is incapable of making anything without a sh*t ton of hops."

"This is a flavorful pilsner. I would have no trouble with starting to drink this at noon and going all day."
""
"This could probably be considered a good west coast version of a Pilsener.  It is perhaps a little more citrusy-piney than the average pilsener out there, but well within the range of the style.  I find most if not all of this brewery's beers to be good values.  I think I paid about $7.50 for the sixer."
""
""
"Its all hops... Not a pilsner"
"12 oz bottle served in a Pilsner glass.  Fresh, crisp and a refreshing beer.  Easy drinking."
""
""
"a good beer. Very hoppy and full-bodied for a pilsner as if an IPA. Lingers somethin fierce. Not a bad thing. Just seems a bit confused. Stuck between two worlds. Like a tranny of beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of those beers that would score a 20 in a competition because of what it's being called. German lagers aren't made with loads of piney citrusy Cascade. I really like the beer, but to me it tastes very similar to the original SNPA."
"Poured a clear golden body with a half finger creamy white head that stuck around the entire glass. Overall impression of appearance is of a classic, perfectly executed German Pilsner. Scents of light, grainy Pilsner malt, a very light hint of graham cracker and floral, perfume-like and spicy noble hops at medium-low levels. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic German Pilsner, very true to style and quite simple and clean. Flavor begins lightly dry with notes of grainy malt and medium levels of floral noble hop flavors. A very light Pilsner malt sweetness sits in the background. Middle continues with medium-high flavors of spicy and floral noble hops, dominating the flavor profile, but with a light maltiness that is mostly grainy. Finish is dry, continuing with medium-high levels of noble hop flavors with hints of grainy malt in the background. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of floral and spicy noble hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a crisp, clean, dry German Pilsner, perfect for the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to style German Pilsner, nothing wrong at all. Overall this is an excellent German Pilsner. It is true to style in every respect, which translates into a crisp, flavorful, noble hop dominated, refreshing beer. Well worth trying."

"This is a glorified pbr. Come on guys."
""
""
""
""
"Pale yellow with tons of carbonation and a firm white froth.  Smells of straw and faint, light fruits.  Crisp with a handful of light fruits and plenty of balancing bitterness.  A light-bodied and flavorful beer that proves the 'merican ""craft"" beer industry needs to pay more attention to the basics."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a big fan of Pilsners in general, but I must admit that this is one tasty brew."
""
"O - nice interpretation of a German pilsner; a style I've grown to love over the years. This doesn't quite measure up to some of the authentic German brewed ones but this is good."
""
"Clear gold with thin head and loads of rising bubbles.  Clean nose, clean yeast, pils malt, floral, grassy hop.  Tastes a bit grainy.  Great floral hop.  I'd like more bitterness and hop flavor.  Crisp and light body.  Solid pils.  Needs less graininess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer. Good tastes and a nice change of paste from the regular torpedo"
"I had it in cans. I found a new lawn mower beer.  Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"it's hard to fathom why anyone would require a written review while drinking. Here it goes.. great Pilsner... German style... Smells great, tastes great. Very little lacing, but overall a very solid beer."
"The flavor is very biting with lots of bittering hop. Long lasting aftertaste. This seems to be off style for me. It's missing the Pilsner malt flavor up front and the hop is too dominating. The body and carbonation, though, are spot on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a nice looking pilsner, with a big foamy white head atop clear golden liquid. That was the peak of the experience however. The smell was grassy and slightly skunky, and the taste had a slight metallic bitterness to it. Victory Prima Pils is a much better pilsner."
""
"Overall: A very clean, malty, grassy pilsner -- very well made as expected by Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"O- one of the best American-made German Pils that I've had in a while.  This will be one of my new go-to's in the summer"
""
"O: A great pilsner, with a unique spice blend."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Definitely loving this nooner.  Grabbing another pint before it's gone.  I can go the liquor store and pick a 12 pack too."
"Nooner Pilsner brewed by Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., with an ABV 5.20%  This brew pours out a nice  golden amber color with a nice white head.  The smell is, sweet, with rich grains and malts. You pick up a hit of hops in the smell of this brew. The taste is bitter, sweet. You pick up on the hops, in the taste. Nooner Pilsner has a smooth aftertaste.  This brew has a mild taste for being a Pilsner, there is nothing overpowering in it.  Nooner Pilsner has a nice balance to it. The mouthfeel is nice clean and refreshing.  Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one, I would buy this brew again. Overall I'm giving  Nooner Pilsner a 4.5 out of 5."
""
"Worth seeking out."
"Great crisp, easy drinkin pils!"
""
""
"trying it in Feb is a little weird to say it is a perfect pool/beach beer!"
""
"Bottle of nooner pils drank."
""
"O- The taste really makes up for some of the other shortcomings. This is a great beer for a party or summer activity or watching TV."

"Brew pours a pale yellow in color with a thin fizzy head for the most part. Lacing is seen when sipped at the line  atthe top of the brew was for the most part. The aroma is mostly of grains and hops. Pretty much is said for the finish also with some floral hops that is slightly bitter for the finish. Also the finish is on the dry side. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, it was OK but nothing really special"
""
""
""
""
"O: A lovely beer, I would like to see a touch more hop flavor, and the bitterness evened out a little bit.  But overall a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Overall this was a great beer, I have no complaints."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"Pilsners are never rated highly.  Rating by style, I'm rating it high.  So crisp and clean with that nice spicy hoppiness (must be some saaz hops).  Perfect clarity, this beer is a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's crisp in its light body but firm, and the carbonation is at an even level that stays strong.  It is smooth, and the spiciness translates to the feel without doing so too harshly."
"Served in a Pilsner glass"
"Overall - Certainly tasty, especially on a hot afternoon (odd release date for this style of beer).  I wouldn't classify it solely as a German piilsner, with some characteristics being more Czech-like.  Worth picking up if you're into pilsners.  3.75 paws."
"I've been making a conscious effort lately to try more pilsners. This is one of the best I've had."
""
""
"Very refreshing, clean beer."
""
""
"I could have easily had another one of these since I didn't feel the booze at all but some water would be needed as a chaser in between sips of this. While not too bready or full of yeast, there was just enough here to take this up a notch while keeping this relatively light. If it was warmer out, I'd grab this instead of an American Macro Lager on a hot day. Really nice addition to Sierra Nevada's lineup and a great choice for someone who's never had a true Pilsener before!"
""
"Hopped up, American style pilsner. Great 'go-to' pilsner."
""
"Overall: A very good pilsner, and a nice addition to the Sierra Nevada portfolio.  Could be a nice go to summer brew.  Right now it is making me wish it was summer"
""
""
""
"Typical German pilsner four five"
""
""
"The taste has a nice hop flavor with subtlle spice and herbal quality with a pilsner flavor malt-wise supporting with light sweetness and gentle mineral yeast in the flavor with mostly dry finish. Overall this is a pretty decent pilsner with nice amount of hop flavor and decent malt/yeast balance -very drinkable , I would say this represents the style well."

"O-  Very good pilsner."
""

"A pilsner winner! Who knew?! -- from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""

"Pours a clear light gold color with two fingers of fluffy white head, half inch retained, big blobs of lace down the glass. Smell: floral and spicy above mild white grape. Taste: dilute white grape juice, crackery, spicy, a bit grassy in the finish. Carb is slightly low. Nice beer, will revisit in the summer."
"O:  Quite a nice take on the style.  Maybe a tad hoppier than an ""authentic"" German pilsner ala Pivo Pils.  Not as sharp as the Pivo, with the grain flexing a bit more.  Strikes a nice balance"
""
""
"It's not bad, but it doesn't nail what it's trying to be (which I assume is a refreshingly bitter, easy-drinking Northern German-style Pilsener). The hops are too floral, the mouthfeel is too sticky and the beer never comes together as more than the sum of its parts. Just goes to show you how hard it is to get this style right, despite the best examples of it being so criminally underrated here (Jever Pilsener's rAvg is a laughable 3.56). I enjoyed Sierra Nevada's Hoppy Lager much more. It's unapologetically over the top and actually better balanced than this one."
""
"true to the description here, this beer really does have some spice from the hops, its awesome, and i think under utilized in this style, thats the beers best feature by far, but its not all that different to me than foam, another straightforward pils these guys did last year. maybe a little more flavor and a little less body in this one, but i preferred nooner as a session ipa from the four way ipa box, there are enough good pilseners out there without this one, although it is quite refreshing, even though the cereal grains linger a bit in the finish, not as crispy as i often like my lagers to be, but i absolutely respect the beer, and think it should do really well for them with warmer weather around the corner and twelve packs of cans already on the shelves. i just know sierra nevada to be capable of greatness, so every time they put out a B level beer, even when its a high B, i feel a little let down, thats what this one is, and i would have liked to see nooner the session ipa stick around instead, but thats just me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hoppier than Summerfest but not as hoppy as Victory Prima Pils, Nooner is an excellent take on a German pilsner.  Extra points for the 12 pack can format, too!"
""
"O: really nice; seemed under carbonated for the style;"
""
""
""
""
"Nose faint floral, citrus, & spice, breadyness, crackers, malts. Taste biscuits, slight spice, honey, & floral/herbal hops, nice dry finish."
""
""
"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on February 8, 2015."
""
""
""
""
"A fairly hopped-up pilsner. A notch below some of my favorites but enjoyable, nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great looking Pilsner.  Bright and golden.  Excellent on the nose.  Sweet maltiness upfront, spicy hops and a dry finish.  Very good.  Will be a great warm weather beer."
""
"M - good. Soldid, frothy, and fulfilling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. I bought this thinking it would be decent  but it really is a pretty outstanding effort by SN. Nice easy drinking pilsner with just the right amount of bitterness. Definitely getting more."
""
"Real solid pilsner! This one could be a great fridge beer. It poured a clear golden color with a light head. Taste was super crisp with a little hop bite. Outstanding pilsner overall!"
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic pilsner. Light color, slightly hoppy, ""great taste""... well, you know what I mean. I don't want to steal anyone else's slogan. Nice job SN. I miss a good pilsner in a world full of IPAs. I love IPAs though, but you know... sometimes I need a good pilsner."
"O: I'm not much of a pilsener guy, but this one is well done. Will probably taste even better when the weather warms up."
"Nice light golden clear with a steady stream of carbonated bubbles flying to the top. Head is average along with the lacing. Aroma is very light and malty. Taste is refreshing with elements of of floral hops, lemon and sweet malt coming through. Carbonation is ample and this beer is balanced extremely well with a very crisp, clean finish...."
"Cheers!!"
"Yellow color, decent head, looks typical. Nose is slight mineral. Flavor is a boring pilsner. Probably easy enough to session but not interesting enough for me to care to."
""
""
""
"WhoooWEE! This is one beautiful pilsner, delicate yet robust with enough malt for a great mouthfeel yet very quaffable. This is what Sierra Nevada needed to round out a superior portfolio."
""
"Sorry SN. I'm sure this is a good pilsner but just not my cup of tea"
""
"More flavorful and just as refreshing as Sierra Nevada's longtime Summerfest. Well done!"
""
""
"Tasted great!  Really liked.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good all around pilsner.  Nice biting fruit aroma, crisp mouthfeel with a semi-dry finish.  A little bitter at the end with some lingering hops, but still leaves a light footprint. Notes are all expected for the style with some bready malt & dry fruit, but it is well balanced and easy."
""
"My overall impression is that this is a very well balanced example of the style. Very easy to drink with a pleasantly light after taste."
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada wins again with flavorful beer at a reasonable price."
"Had this poured out of the can into a Pilsner glass. Enjoyed during the super bowl pre-game (nooner line is of course great for marathon drinking), but will likely try it again in the summer. Pilsners in general don't have a ton of flavor to me, and this one had less than most. Had some slight spice and pine flavor, but not much. Little scent to speak of. Color was a clear, pale yellow. Ever so slightly above average session pils."
"12oz bottle poured into Pilsner glass. Pours a clear light golden color. Two fingers of quickly dissipating head. Little to no lacing and moderate carbonation. Floral hop scent. Crisp light feel. Crisp floral hop flavor but it's too subtle (I have too much respect for Sierra Nevada to say watered down, but the flavor profile is a bit diluted.) Very good representation of a German pils. (8.0)"
""
""
"O- A nice Pilsner that is easy to drink, definitely worth picking up.  Sierra Nevada never disappoints!"
""
""
"Too hoppy for a pilsner in my opinion."
""
""
"Great look, no nose, really lacing in flavor."
"Not a whole lot of flavor here. Great color, no nose, very little taste."
""
""
"Might be my summer beer this year."
"Transparent golden with thin white head that fades. Aroma of fresh grains, mild honey. Tastes of grains, honey, clean and bitter hop presence. Light in body with light carbonation."
""
""
"Excellent Plisner."
""
"O:  Good beer with some flaws.  Would get again."
"O-nicely done pils refreshing and highly drinkable"
""
"Mouthfeel is well carbonated crisp and refreshing. Finishes very dry with lingering hop bitterness. Well done Sierra Nevada."
"Overall: An excellent shot at a German pils by a US brewer, and one that will doubtlessly be in my regular rotation throughout the year. One of the best domestic German pilseners that is to-style and doesn't rely on gimmicky hopping to get drinks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Frankly, I opted to try a six-pack of this over the Lagunitas Pils. Sierra Nevada's Nooner is a pleasing pils with an ease of drinkability."
""
"O: Judging this within its category, Nooner is at the top of its class. This wipes out Scrimshaw, The Crisp, and most every other American-made pils that isn't going for ""hoppy pils."" This is a dead-on impression of a German-style pils, available in a cheap 6 and not pasteurized for the trip over the ocean. Thrilled this exists."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a solid example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in a nice Pilsener, but I still think there's some room for improvement especially in the mouthfeel.  This beer had ok drinkability it was smooth, a little crisp, fairly creamy, slightly filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think one is enough for me, the flavor doesn't really make me want to come back for more and the mouthfeel holds back the drinkability.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was one damn good looking Pilsener.  What I like the least about this beer is the mouthfeel, it could use some work.  I don't think I would buy this again, but I for sure wouldn't turn it down.  I can't say I would recommend it as a great Pilsener, but it's worth a try if you like the German Pilseners.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, it had just a couple aspects that held it back from being as good as it could be, but in the end it was still a nice example of the style and I didn't mind it.  Keep up the solid works guys, I think a little bit of work could make this a really nice beer."
"Lots of spicy, herbal hop character in the nose and on the tongue, there is a little something sticky lingering long after the swallow. Dry, biscuity malts compliment the hops nicely. Hoppier than a traditional pils I guess but this is a damn satisfying drink. Too many local options as good or a bit better in PA, so this won't crack my regular pils rotation."
"Pours a sparkling pales straw color with a one and one half finger white head that fades to a cap quickly.  Smell is grassy and bready.  Flavors are bready, grassy, earthy.  Biscuit like with a snap of hoppy balance.  Mouthfeel feel is light and effervescent.  Overall a good pilsner, one of the better I've had.  while it definitely has a German pilsner pulse, there are hints of Czech pilsner in its makeup."
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip. Golden yellow color. Dense, white head, 2 finger. Faded quickly to a thin cap, but good lacing. Smells of grassy hops. Taste was sweet and bready, with a bitter hoppy finish. One of my first pilsners, I'd buy again."
"O:  very interesting mix of the German and American pilsners ... it has more bread malt and grassy-hop flavor than most American pilsners, which tend to overemphasize the American floral hop bitterness (e.g., Prima Pils, The Crisp).  it's a great brew and one I'll revisit from time to time ... a definite amount of restraint on making this too American or too bitter, which is a huge plus."
"Crystal clear, dry, crisp and refreshing. Sierra Nevada does it again!"
""
""
"RJT"
"Overall it started out quite nicely, and had a great malt and lagering crispness, nice pilsner overall, but the hops just get way too bitter and spicy on the back end and especially the finish. Unfortunately they drown out the awesomeness that is teh great pilsner underneath. I really liked this one and I hope they do it again but dial back a bit on the American spicy hops and keep with the noble ones and this will be a great summer beer to drink at noon."
"Medium-light throughout, its dry absolute finish highlights the pilsner grain in all its rustic glory. Lingering hop bite hangs in the gullet and seems snappy with poppy seed and lemongrass even with the afterglow of floral and perfume pulsing onward."
"This is a nice pils. Good example of a German style one. Kind of grassy and more earthy on the profile. Easy to drink and consistent with a nice body. Well done."
"Pretty basic pilsner with a little more flavor than your typical light beers. A little bit of a strange aftertaste though. May give it another chance one day but it was nothing to boast about"
""
""
"I thought this was awful, taste like natural light (Which I would of rather of had)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good Pilsner. Not too hoppy but definitely strong enough. I'd definitely recommend putting this beer in the rotation for warmer weather."
"O - I bought a single of Nooner and the Hoppy Lager. Much preferred Nooner and may have to grab a six pack. It's quite good."
"I love it"
"It almost tastes like an imperial pilsner without the sharp bitterness on the end. Not as crisp and biting as a lot pilsners, which is nice, actually. A roundedness to the mouthfeel. Foreseeable easy drinker for hot summer camping sessions."
""
"Overall - This is an excellent brew, fitting of a Sierra Nevada product. Absolutely Condor recommended and approved. A great product from a great brewery, you gotta check this one out. Very impressed."
"Drinks very easy, I could see picking this up again"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clear gold with a solid carbonation stream and a light creamy white head. The head hangs on a little and leaves some nice small soapy/sticky lacing. The aroma is mild, with light biscuit and noble hops. The taste, though, is much more robust, with big noble bittering hops up front and a little lighter bready and light fruit flavors backing it up. There is a nice fullness to the body with just a little carbonation and hops bite on the finish."
"They can this too, so this seems a perfect summer or camping trip beer."
""
""
"Just ok by me.  Typical mass produced pilsner flavor was expecting much more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I feel they tried to ""hop up"" or ""spice up"" the beer more than a traditional pils, and it didn't quite work for me."
""
"Sierra Nevada rep served this up (Thank You!) at tap takeover at City Taphouse in Philly. He said it was similar recipe to FOAM, which I'd had years ago at Bonnaroo. Certainly very easy drinking. Thanks so much!"
"Tasty but basic."

""

"but not a big fan of this one"

"Serving type: bottle."
"Great Pilsner, tops summerfest. Summerfest is great but this has the better malt balance. Will be buying by the case. Cheers to a superbly balanceD lager."
""
""
"Overall: To me, this is right up there with Sunshine Pils- extremely drinkable, sessionable, great flavor and body. Has all the signature Sierra Nevada traits which I enjoy."
""
"Bottle into pint glass, the Nooner pours a clear medium straw to light golden in color and sports a white cap of foam.  Aroma of classic pils malt and a faint hop character, and not as robust as I might have guessed.  Standard taste as well and with a light bready finish with a touch of spice.  Bit more of a creamy carbonation that your typical Pils.  That carbonation gives it a fuller feel though perhaps at the expense of more nuanced malt flavors that may or may not be lurking beneath."
""
"Very easy drinking and enjoyable. Just a nice semi-hoppy lager."
""
""
"Clear gold color with a pillowy white head. Smells a bit spicy, and a little bready. Tastes bready/biscuity, light floral and spiced hops in there.  Very crisp and light.  Carbonation complements the flavor in this beer nicely.  Not a bad pilsner."
""
""
"Aftertaste was harsher than expected.  There's definitely a pils flavor to it, but the signature Sierra Nevada hops just mess the beer up.  Not a bad beer, but a weird mix to my mouth."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a long time."
"Excellent taste.  Nice golden color on the pour.  Good aroma - wheat based.  Feel was smooth, with a bitter bite at the end.  Very good beer."
"An instant favorite for me, and just beautifully simple.  Up there with Pivo Pils and Live Oak Pils as one of my favorite US made Lagers.  I will be interested to try this next to Summerfest, but from memory, this is far superior.  So happy this is year round.  I see many more cases in my future."

"A very easy, drinkable beer.  It's like a PBR but with much more flavor.  Seriously, when will Pilsners come back in style for craft beers?  I love a good IPA and all, but a well done Pilsner is just something wonderful."
""
"Overall just a real nice solid bready pilsner, but not mindblowing."

"O: more malt and a slightly higher ABV than one might expect for a ""nooner"" session beer. Still, very drinkable and no bothersome flaws."

"Wrote a review because it was required."
"O: Can be considered amongst the greats of the style, for my money. Thank you Sierra Nevada for making a year round pils that is this good. Will be a go-to spring and summer beer for me."

"Nice. Dry, slightly hoppy. Clean taste. Very easy drinking."

"Very nice Pilsner ! Bought this as a single but I believe a 6er of Nooner is in my future."
"Overall:  The long-awaited year round Sierra Nevada pilsner!  I like it and will certainly make it a mainstay in my refrigerator."
"Tastes like it was brewed with an adjunct, cutting the malt. Does not taste at all like any german pilsener I've had - a bit corn-y, without much malt or hop flavor. I love pilsners, but this tastes more like a light american lager/AAL."
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy, white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of grassy, herbal hops and biscuit malt.  Body is medium and crisp.  Grassy, herbal hops, pale malt fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry. Wonderful Pilz."
"This beer is better than Miller Lite, of course, but it doesn't offer much more than a cleaner and crisper version of that classic American pilsner. I bet it will make them some money though."

"Six pack from Bert's Clear deep golden color with a smallish white head. Solid pilsner malt and spicy hop, nice easy drinking lager."
"Pours clear, deep straw producing 3++ fingers of frothy, somewhat lasting, white head that diminishes a thin wash of lace. Aroma is classic pilsner yeast, bread, mellow, grain, floral & grass with hints of lemon. Taste is pilsner yeast, cracker/biscuit, grain/pale malt,  with deep lemony & grassy hops (Noble), clean, crisp, dry finish that hints of a pine needle bitterness that lingers & becomes dominant in the shortlived aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, moderately carbonated, crisp, clean & dry (more so in the first half of the sip and aftertaste)."

"I can't lie the name made me expect a light crisp beer with some hops because of the brand.  The honest to goodness result is a beer that isn't great and the abv and title don't make any sense.  If you see this on draft by all means give it a go, but I'd pass on another 6er."

"Overall - Well, what else can I say? SN does it again. This is a damn good pilsner! Full flavored, very good hop presence, yet feels nice and refreshingly light; I'm definitely a fan of this beer. The only question is which I like better, Summerfest or Nooner??? Sadly, I won't be able to do a side-by-side comparison for a few months yet."

"This is a solid pilsener. It's not one of my favorites, but it's definitely a respectable example of the style."

"Overall: I cut my teeth on good German pilsners, this one ranks pretty close. It's full-flavored, with a nice hop bitterness, just right!"
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 12/18/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, lime, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of earthy/spicy hops and bready pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, lime, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, cracker, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of earthy/spicy hops and bready pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice German Pilsener style. All around great balance and robustness of earthy/spicy hops and bready pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"O -- I so wanted to like this beer to have available for a common go-to, but the hop character is just not traditional Pils.  All of the hops used are traditional, except for the Saphir.  There's something about this hop when used as a replacement for traditional Noble Hops that doesn't sit well with my palate -- or my expectation of traditional lager styles.  Personally, I'll stick with Trumer as a go-to Pils and enjoy SN's Summerfest for a seasonal."
"The flavor is a great example of the Pilsner style. Lots of crackery malts, light bitterness, grain, and an almost wheat like taste. Super crisp and easy to drink."

"A nice classic German Pilsner from the venerable Sierra Nevada. Grains full of cracker and biscuit flavors fill the palate punctuated on both ends by a nice snap of hop bitterness. Nice and dry. Goes down very easy. Definitely a great session brew. A new go-to that will pair fantastically with tons of food."

"3.91/5: A good every day beer...as in, I could drink this one all day long"

"O: Very good. Hits all the marks for the style. It's always nice to have a quality Pilsner around."
"O   Probably my new go to yr round. Very balanced true to style and not too hoppy like some of the other Brewers. It does get your attention so it reminds you it is SN."
"Overall: A very solid take on a classic style Euro Pilsner. Good crisp bready malt notes with some nice floral hop and fruit notes"

"A great example of a classic German style from an American brewer. The original session beer, indeed. I wish more people in the states could build an appreciation for it."

"This beer is very dry, but the aftertaste is very bready and grainy. A lot of Pilsners are like this, I just prefer the ones that aren’t. I would rather have lingering hop flavor than malt flavor. Nevertheless, this is a very good American-brewed German Pilsner, far better than the Summerfest offering. (3.5)"

"Overall-a very nice take on the style, very refreshing, would definitely buy more when it gets a bit warmer outside."
""
"Good example of a German style Pilsner. Lemony and spicy hops, light maltiness, and crisp, clean finish."
""
"Typical Pilsner pour, with pale golden body, small head, and lively carbonation.  The smell was more hoppy than the typical Pilsner, as there was a more floral quality to this than the typical restrained grassy smell from Saaz hops.  The taste was a mix of grainy sweetness and hops with some cooked corn in the taste, but no more than typical for the style.  The hops were spicy and also added a hint of lemon peel.  The body was light and quenching, but did not feel watery.  This was a well crafted Pilsner, as can be expected from this tp notch brewery."
"Overall: very well done to the style. A well crafted beer."
""

"A well done German Pilsner, tasty and easy drinking."

"Overall, I might prefer a couple less IBUs and a touch less carbonation. In short, I prefer Summerfest, but this is a nice pilsner nonetheless."

"O - A welcome addition to their yearly offerings. Could become a regular in my beer fridge."
""
""
"O: 4.5 - Really good pils, an uner-made style by today's micros. In recent months, Hans Pils from Real Ale has been my go-to session beer. I think this might well displace it. Really good, dead-on style."
""

"Nice and flavorful. Expecting that Summerfest flavor but this is all together different. Definitely more complex than Summerfest. Has a nice thick hop scent up front. Head discolors after the first pour and lacing is minimal. The flavor makes up for the inadequacy of the latter. Nice and smooth with a ever so slight bitterness that is enjoyable through sequence. Going down fast. Aftertaste is wonderful. Smell translates to the flavor and doesn't have that overly sweet taste. I think I will enjoy a least three more of these before I'm through. Before you know it your on your second. Pick the traditional Pilsner glass to get the full experience of this beer. Hats off to Sierra Nevada again. Nice beer!"
"Excellent pilsner that beats all others I've tried. Amazing flavor that has lightness and drinkability skin to the Summerfest pilsner but with a deeper, more complex flavor with the hops character one would expect from Sierra Nevada"
""

"Very very very very light."
"Bottle. Clear as day. Bright golden color. Big, frothy, dense head. Lots of individual scars of laces that mark my progress down the glass. Looks exactly how it should. Smells of lager yeast, pils malt, spicy and sudsy hops. Some slightly sweet cereal grains. The flavor has some pop. A Pilsner through and through. Hops aren't overly intense yet the lend flavors of grass, soap, spice, and flower. Dry lager yeast and pils malt. Finishes with a touch of sweetness and a pale, grainy flavor. Sierra Nevada is really stressing this beer being a session beer. I agree that it is but also boasts a surprisingly full body. Perfect carbonation. A very well done Pilsner. This sixer will be recycled quite quickly."
"Taste: Clean and malty with a tinge of hoppiness coming in at the finish. A very pleasant, easy-drinking, and well-done pilsner, and a perfectly refreshing beer for a warm day. Will drink more of these, yes."
"Refreshing, crisp, citrusy, and quite tasty."
""
"Great Pilsner. Easy to drink but unique enough to force you to take it slow."
"Looks great in the glass.  Smells sweet and not quite picking up the fresh noble variety of hops like I do in some well made pilsners.  Taste is pleasant and enjoyable although like the nose, the Euro hop flavors seems to be missing.  Has a heavy grain taste (good), and has an overly dry finish (not so go).  Overall I enjoyed this pilsner, would definitely drink again, but there are several others that I would go to take over this one if options are available."
"O: I've tasted a number of German-style Pilsners over the years, and this one is spot-on. Nice effort by Sierra Nevada."
"Overall: Incredibly refreshing.  This a great representation of a pilsner without having too much hop bitterness.  Well-balanced and well done.  I'm looking forward to finding cans."
"Fantastic pilsner, fantastic brewery, very hop forward"

"O: A very nice American version of a German pilsner, with great drinkability and simplicity (that's a good thing). Highly recommended, but that's almost expected coming from SN"
" I wouldn't call this the most authentic German Pilsner, but it stands by itself and isn't afraid to cross the boundaries to create a marvelous tasting yet refreshing beer. I will be buying again!"

"Pours a clear, gold color.  1/4 inch head of a white color.  Good retention and great lacing.  Smells of yeast, pale malt, slight sweet malt, earthiness, and a hint of hop.  Fits the style of a German Pilsner.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, yeast, and slight earthiness.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body, but the blend favors the earthiness."
"A solid refreshing pilsner. Easy to drink."
"Bottle. Clean grainy aroma with hints of noble hops. Moderate bitterness with a slight mineral quality. Solid pils."
