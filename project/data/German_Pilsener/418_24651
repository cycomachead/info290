It pours an attractive golden color with fine bubbles swimming frantically to the top. The medium head shows very good retention. Smell is somewhat fruity with biscuit and mild hop aromas. Taste is on the sweeter side for a pilsner but still offers a nice biscuit flavor. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with carbonation on the lower end of the spectrum. Overall, this beer tastes fresh, complex (for a pilsner), and remarkably balanced. It would make a great session beer.","DeFaz","Sep 20, 2013"

When I drank it before I remember a rather distinct almost sweet creamy taste and feel (especially for a pilsner) but I don't detect that now. I wonder if this is a bit past prime. Scent is floral and the taste is pretty middle of the road slightly bitter pilsner style. I drank it first in 90 degree weather and it was perfect then.

3.86,6.3,4,3.5,4,3.75,4,"Better than a typical Pilsner pour, with a page golden body, lively carbonation streamers full of tiny bubbles, and a two finger thick, craggy head. The smell was flowery, grassy, and had a hint of cooked corn in it. The taste was a mixture of simple sweetness with a lemony and spicy hop presence. Easy to drink, due to a light, aired out body, and clean lemon drop like finish. I just wanted a lighter diversion this week from the usual ales I drink, and this was just what I expected. Nothing spectacular, but who buys a Pils expecting that?","rajendra82","Apr 15, 2013"

3.78,4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 7/7/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining a head. Aromas of pear, lemon, herbal, floral, bready malt, grass, pepper, and light earth. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of lemon, pear, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and earth. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, bread, cracker, pepper, grass, herbal, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors with decent complexity. Fairly dry on the finish but does not feel watery at all. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a fairly crisp and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Pilsner. Not quite as bold as some others I have had. However, it is nicely balanced with a good amount of flavor; and very smooth to drink as expected. Nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 07, 2012"

3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"a nice crisp pils. pours that classic pale yellow clear with a happy 2 inch white head. smells like german malts and grassy hops in equal proportion. flavor is well balanced too, with the malt in the front and the hops in the back. i would compare this to victory's prima pils in flavor and in mouthfeel. very very refreshing, especially when its ice cold. quick mildly hoppy light finish, high drinkability. not the most exciting lefthand brew, but a very quaffable article. this will be good on the golfcourse this summer.","StonedTrippin","Mar 07, 2012"

Tastes very good, clean, crisp, the slight citrus is there, and crisp, dryish hops. A malty, grainy richness is in the background holding it all together. Mouthfeel is sublime and superb.

3.83,5.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a pilsner glass. The beer is a clear golden color, the perfect color that a pilsner should be, not too light. A creamy white head sits on top, and dissipates a little. What is left is a medium thin layer of bubbles. I appreciate this very much, as the head never goes away completely. Good sticky lacing down the glass. Smells of citrus, lemongrass, and faded hops are present. The taste is interesting. A bit too lemony and herbal for me. It has a light grassy taste, if that makes sense. A great summer beer for sure. The mouthfeel is just right, very lager-esque. Overall, I think my rating will be higher than what i would actually prefer. It's a complex beer, but therein lies the brilliance of it. I wouldn't want to session this at all, but it would make an awesome beer for lunch on a spring or summer day. Again, I keep trying to find faults with this, but when i break down each individual area it's pretty good, yet unique in all of them. I probably won't try it again though.

The malts are super clean with a biscuit dough creaminess and I dont find them to be grainy or husky at all. The hops also lend a somewhat uncommon biting bitterness that is somewhere between grassy, floral and even piney in its lingering aspect. I wouldnt mind seeing more hop flavor and less bitterness. It works ok in the end, but I prefer my pilsners with more grainy/husky malt flavor and a distinctive saaz-y hop flavor with just enough bitterness for balance.","twiggamortis420","Aug 27, 2011"

Very bready nose, neither uncooked nor too sour in nature, like a big loaf of white bread, the lemon peel about as bitter as anything gets, this said, the malts seem muted and submerged in general grassiness, no real fruit scents to speak about. Medium-bodied, not as lightweight as you'd think while still keeping a steady pace moving forward. The fizz is pretty damn active and does contribute to the overall weight. Bready and crusty, pretzel-like with more of a sourness here (duh, sourness is related to taste not the olfactory sense but, hey, it all makes sense in the end). Grassiness not as biting, though, and the lemon citrus toned down too. Touch of peach to apricot pit, skin for fruit. Stays square shouldered through the finish, no wimping out at the end.

The salty smell was overwhelming. Being hopeful with the looks, I took a drink. The salty beast was all over it, though I remember The Beast (been over 10 years) to be worse. Not smooth in the mouth or going down.

It laced the sides of the glass nicely. Smell was much lighter than I though it would be, consisting mostly of a grassy smell with maybe a hint of freshly sliced apple hiding deep down. Taste is *not* BMC, but it *is* very light, and I am unsure how best to describe it. There *are* hops present, but they're very modest. Everything about this beer is very mild; it's quite refreshing, really. Highly drinkable, IMO, and probably my favourite ""craft pilsner"" to date.

The nose is a bit understated,mostly floral and subtle grainy notes. This is pretty dead on the style,as far as the pallet goes this is slightly sweet with just the right touch of graininess and hop bitterness. This has a slightly skunked finish that gives it that traveled beer feeling. The mouthfeel is light with carbonation that is semi creamy,and a drying finish.

Flavor is balanced yet has an assertive hoppiness to it more herbal grass with citrus peels on the palate with a semi sweet lightly toasted two row cereal malt flavor with hints of crackers with honey drizzled on it. Mouthfeel has sturdy carbonation with a dry finish from the hop bitterness perfect German style pils.

A good pils is hard to come by, but when a good one does come along, rest assured I'll snatch it up. As for this one, it's more of a ""try it once and pass"" beer.","neonbrown82","Apr 08, 2007"

Over all a nice looking brew. The aromaÂ’s, while not overly exciting where inviting, had a clean crisp scent of light sweat pilsner type malt with a spice from the hops, saaz? As I said it is an inviting brew, nothing to write home about but pretty solid. The taste seems to be on par with the aroma, nothing extraordinary about it but an easy drinking brew, one that I could spend an afternoon or evening drinking. Taste seems to be similar to the aroma, which a sweet feel up front which quickly breaks away to a spicy and grassy hop taste that lingers while on the back of the mouth. The taste seems to slightly bring more to the game that the aroma. Over all I think that this is a solid brew, very enjoyable easy drinking PilÂ’s.","Stimack","Mar 14, 2007"

It's more malty in aroma, flavor, and texture than grainy. The hops add a spice, herbal, and earthy character without the bitey astringency. The beer is creamy and hold a good head retention until the end. Finsihes quite clean and crisp with a mild minty, green apple snap. Good summertime beer.","BEERchitect","Jul 09, 2006"

3.78,4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The beer is of course initially quite cold. It adds to the refreshing character, which is welcome on this 100+ day, but it drowns out the flavor a bit. A touch of toasted malt character and a hint of grain sweetness round out what is otherwise a nice hoppy Pilsner. Lightly spicy, with a smooth herbal hop character and a nice, sharp bitterness in the finish. As the beer warms up a bit the malt character becomes a bit rounder, it adds a bit to the body of the brew and helps to mix with, and balance the bitterness in the finish. This is a nice Pilsner, in fact it is perfect for a hot day, as it is fairly light on the palate. It could perhaps use a bit more malt and hop character, but like I said it is nice and refreshing as is.","Gueuzedude","Jun 04, 2006"

It has an aroma of grains, hop spice and light skunk with a taste that is rather clean and flavorless. There are notes of musty hops, pale/toasted malts and a mild bitterness that hides in the back of the throat, leaving a short finish. It has a medium body and feels good enough, but overall it's not that great of an example, and I got bored of it rather quickly.","mmmbeer","May 11, 2006"

3.26,-10.2,4,3,3,3,4,"The beer as it sets in its Pilsner glass after pouring from the 12-ounce brown bottle is a luminous gold, with a modest bright white head which is creamy in texture, after its erosion, the lace forms a velum like curtain upon the glass. Nose is the prototypical Pilsner malt; sweet and clean, start is lightly sweet with a nice grain presence, the top light in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to moderate in acidity, the hops pleasingly mild and the aftertaste dry and long lasting. Personally, Lagers/Pilsners are not my favorite style, but I must say that I donÂ’t think thereÂ’s a prettier sight than a Pilsner in its own glass, covered with condensation and the drops running down the glass, clearing a path so you can see that perfect gold body with its bright white head, to me this sayÂ’s Â“BEERÂ”!","Gusler","Mar 25, 2006"
