Pours almost crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clinging the glass, and plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, grass, floral hops, pepper, herbs, and a bit of biscuit. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of big lemon, biscuit, floral, pepper, herb, grass, and spiciness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, biscuit, herb, pepper, and spiciness on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and very nice mouthfeel that is not thin at all. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish as expected, and very drinkable. Overall this is a highly excellent pilsener, with a ton of nice well balanced flavor. One of the best ones I have had for sure.","superspak","Feb 21, 2012"

Body is light, with a slight creamy texture, smooth balance and excellent drinkability. Definitely a refreshing and tasty pils.","EgadBananas","Jan 06, 2012"
4.2,9.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,""Bread crust and saltine crackers!" shout the malt. "Pine sap and minty earth!" scream the hops, eventually the louder of the two parties. Mineral water and sulfur-y yeastiness lingers in the finish; this pilsener could hang with the best of German offerings. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, light-bodied, dry on the back end, and ultimately drinkable. A fantastic pils to make you fall in love with the style all over again.","wagenvolks","Jan 03, 2012"

3.18,-17.4,4.5,1.5,4,3.5,3,"I'm quite happy that the taste departed from the smell significantly. This isn't a style I often spring for, and I haven't found many American versions that I enjoy, but this is solid.","amphion1065","Oct 23, 2011"
4.42,14.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Oh yea, it is about damn time a Texas brewery nailed a good pilsner, especially considering all the German immigrant heritage near the Hill Country. This one can hang right up there with the best of the Pennsylvania pilsners. Snappy, sharp and crisp with lots of hop flavor and character. Goes down smooth and fast, I am very impressed.","twiggamortis420","Sep 30, 2011"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a nice-sized white head. The aroma is a mix of grain and grass with a little bit of citrus mixed in. A very nice smelling beer. The flavor is a mix of grain and bready malt, with some grassy and citrus hops mixed in. I also get a little bit of toffee in the flavor. The bitterness is pretty high for a pilsner but goes with the flavors very well. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer.","Mora2000","Sep 25, 2011"
3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall this is a solid Pilsner, much like some of the better Pilsners up here in lake country. If I lived in the Austin area I might buy this regularly. So if you do live in the Austin area I would advise giving this a try. Cheers!","Humulus85","Sep 16, 2011"

3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"There was not any problems with the mouthfeel or the aftertaste. It was quite crispy, and it is definitely something i will want to take with me when I go disc golfing or even tubing down the Guadalupe River! (This along with Peacemaker) I think it's what makes Austin Beerworks appealing for me, and it's the fact that they are selling beers in cans. I don't think there's any local breweries that does this? It's nice to have that option to choose from.","2xHops","Aug 16, 2011"
4.52,17.4,4.5,5,4,4.5,5,"Overall, a supremely drinkable, crisp, dry and hoppy session beer. One of the best craft pilseners I have tried.","BeerZack","Aug 09, 2011"
3.55,-7.8,4,4,3,4.5,3.5,"Overall: It'd rate higher if there was a little more pronounced hop flavor to balance the hop bitterness, or if there was more noticeable malt flavor. It feels good to drink and is certainly refreshing.","fivehoursfree","Jul 25, 2011"
4.35,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An excellent Pilsener and a welcome addition to the Texas beer scene. Something I will be drinking a lot more of, and would highly recommend. Up there with Stoudts as one of the best Pilseners I have had (though very different interpretations of the style).","champ103","Jul 17, 2011"

4.05,5.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The taste is not nearly as sweet. Hop dominated from the get go. Almost like a lager version of an English IPA... but still distinctly pils. Dry, crisp finish. Much thinner than the Live Oak Pilz, but that fits the beer. Pretty drinkable, but also jolting and interesting. Love ABW's debut so far. Hope I can get their cans in DFW.","UTCengOwl","Jul 15, 2011"
