"Just a touch of haze in a deep straw colored liquid, topped with a creamy bubbly bone white head that persists forever leaving lots of stickies on the sides of the glass. Crackery bready malt aromas are nicely balanced with a bit of spicy floral hop. Light sulfur rounds out the nose. The flavor is rich bready crackery pilsner malt with spicy hop to counter. Slight metallic flavor towards the end is a bit off putting. I can imagine that this was a better beer when fresher, but I just noticed that this can is best by July 2014. Still no excuse for the metallic flavor. I will rate as is and hopefully get a chance to sample again."

"O- Very tasty and crisp. Well done Pils, especially by an American brewer. Well deserved to be an award winner."
"Have only had this on tap.  Clean and crisp - always refreshing!"

"Overall: A very solid Pils. I still think Troeg's Sunshine takes the prize for authenticity, while Victory Prima takes the prize for flavor, in the SEPA German Pilsner competition."
"12oz can. Pours a translucent stray color with an inch of head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of toasted malts, grassy hops, hay, and sweet bread. Lots of malt flavor at first followed up by some of the cut grass. Toasted bready malts with hints of wheat and hay. Finishes with a light bitterness along with some floral notes. Good amount of body with lots of carbonation. A can of this is perfect for the summer. Overall, worth getting again."

"A good German style pilsner isn’t alwayseasy to come by but Sly Fox has produced a very good example with this beer. I like its snappy, crisp flavor profile and the herbs and grasses are nicely placed and balanced. It’s certainly a pilsner worth trying and one that most everyone will like."
"O: I really like this pilsner. Some traditional German examples are pointlessly bitter and dry and lack the flavor to back it up. This is a really nicely balanced example with a good complex profile."

"355ml (12fl.oz) can. Footed pilsner glass. Pale straw, cloudy appearance. White in color, close & lasting crown. Floral, perfumed, spicy & fruity aromas. Gentle pale malt & bready flavors are overwhelmed fruity bitterness. Light to medium body. Moderate to soft carbonation. Spicy palate. Long floral bitter finish. Dried sensation & ripe fruit hues on the aftertaste. Nice surprise rediscovering the flavorful Pilsner style. An style frequently beaten by Industrial brewers."

"This is a fantastic, easy drinking pilsner. A good amount of flavor on this and stands as one of the better American pilsners."

""

"This is a kind and gentle pils. It drinks so easily that the foam doesn't even have a chance to fall before you have drained the glass. The citrus stays sweet and the small tart aspect of the lemon blends with the yeasty sour. This beer has no rough edges or seams. It's mineral quality makes it especially clean and refreshing. The delicate touch of spice made it cheerful. You can picture it on the table in a pitcher, easily forthcoming."

"Overall I don't really like the style but this beer is quaff able."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent beer and a good example of a german pils. I could drink this all summer (along with Prima Pils and Stoudts Pils). Big fan, would love to see this in KY. Highly recommended."
""
""
""

"Pale straw yellow in color with brilliant clarity. Poured with a billowy white foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of soapy amd sticky lacings on the glass. Sour dough bread, herbal and spicy hop aromas with earthy grassy notes. Light creamy smooth feel down the middle with tangy, assertive carbonation on the edges. Flavor is a wonderful balance of bready and biscuity malt and herbal hop flavors. Hop flavors turn a bit spicy through the middle along with a lightly citrus tang. Finishes dryly and crisply with a lingering herbal hop bitterness. An exceptionally complex, crisp, refreshing German pilsner."
""
""
""
"This beer is an okay Pils....Prima Pils is still ruling the roost on this one and Stoudt's Pils is much better as well."
""
"This isn't a bad session beer. The can is a definite plus in this regard. The flavor isn't as forward as I would like. I did enjoy this beer, but I wish the malt was good as the intensely bitter hop character. I wouldn't mind a some of these at the tailgate."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems a little hoppier compared to other beers in the style (almost like a West Coast take on a classic German style) but is still easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great pils, great summer beer and another reason why PA brewers make the best craft pils."
""
""
""
""

"An excellent summer brew, I could easily see throwing a sixer of this in a cooler and hitting the beach for the afternoon. Light, refreshing, tasty and clean, this is a well balanced pils. I'm quite bummed that this is not available in Cleveland; it would be an easy go-to beer for a group of friends, no matter if they are craft beer enthusiasts, or simply casual beer drinkers."
"Strongly bitter and crisp taste; again lots of aggressive noble hops packing grass and floral, earthy flavors; nice pils malt underneath but it's the bitter hops that dominate this beer. Light body, lively carbonation, and dry finish make this a refreshing pils for sure. Overall it's quite good."
""
""
""
"O - Very good taste, with some more carbonation the mouthfeel and aroma would be a bit better. A pretty good example of the style."
""
"Clean but slightly cloying finish with bitter aftertaste. Overall enjoyable but nothing too special and some oddly placed flavors. Would drink again but won't pursue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a mind-blowing experience, but a very good beer. It's nice to have something predictable and satisfying. It should be a staple in every refrigerator in the Delaware Valley."
""
"Straw colored in appearance with little head and no retention or lacing. The taste is mildly hoppy with a clean finish. This offering was overall clean and crisp, but a little thin. I'd give it a thumbs up nonetheless, but certainly nothing to write home about."
"O: crowd pleaser. looking forward to superbowl XLVI and pikeland pils"
"O: This is a good beer for those Spring and Summer days when mowing the lawn and such. Really well priced at $7.99 for a 6 pack."
""
"A well made beer and quite enjoyable at that."

"Overall this was a good beer. I wish ergot this here in Idaho"
"Pours a transparent golden yellow with a thin bubbly head. The nose is great, light vienna malts, hints of bread and dough with a floral perfumy hop and light note of grass. The taste has vienna and pale malts, lightly toasted bread with hints of dough. The hop balance adds perfumy hops and some light grassy notes with a touch of resigny hop in the back. The body is thicker and a touch viscous with a nice carbonation. Very tasty but a little on the heavy side for a pilsner."
""
"Overall – It's not quite but Prima Pils, but it's up there. It's well balanced and has a great easy drinking taste. I'll be sure to look for this one during the warmer weather especially."

"Mixed sixer from the Wegmans shelf. I like 113 IPA and was happy to find a single to try this. Poured from the can into a pilsner glass. Tall skinny. Nice bright color w tight head. Crisp hoppy aroma. Nice crisp hop flavor with a light malt accent. Easy drinking and refreshing. This is like 85 Prima Pils to me. The can makes it a great choice for fishing, picnics, etc. will pick up a case next summer for sure."
"O - this is a well-crafted American pilsner - American in the good way, not the other way..."
"a hard one to do but a would say quite a success... looks a lot of like prima outside of a difference in carbonation. some steady bubbles but nothing too lively. golden clear with a smaller white head. palate is very consistent and dry. doesn't fall off completely clean like a the prima... and i'm saying that because i had them along side each other but still clean brisk end. sufficient hop. americans are getting good at this. and i'm pretty psyched about."
"exceptional product.... a hidden gem if we will... not many know of it but if you see it and you like hoppy pilsners you will be pleasantly surprised."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not filling, low kick, nice representation of style. This is a perfect beer for a hot and humid NJ night. If this were distributed to MA, it quite possibly could be my summer go to beer."
"Just an exceptionally well made local pils."
"O- The crisp fresh malt has a good balance with the hops and it is very drinkable. There is no sulfur notes or corn notes it is all fresh malt and hops."
"Easy to drink, as it is extremely light and refreshing. A perfect summer beer, the balance of this beer really increases its appeal. Lucky for me, top-notch German pilsners are prevalent in this part of the country, and this is one that I will be returning to, because it is definitely a solid offering from Sly Fox."
"Tastes are pilsen (White Labs???) yeast, grassy hops, sanitizer, grass, caramel apples, minty hops, maize, Bud Lite Ice with a litte fruitiness and straw injected into it, wheat, lip gloss, crisp grains, clean tastes and dry tastes. I like this one, oh yea."
"Pours a nice typical pilsner style white head, Pale and clear. Very typical and pleasing to me. Smells of grainy sweet malts, some lager yeast smells that I still can't describe very well. Earthy hops come through in the finish for a nice balance to the malts. Thin bodied, medium high carbing. I'm going to enjoy this one and may more if and when I go back to NY to pick some up. Overall a good beer and very portable. $2.15 a single."
"I like it, but Pikeland Pils is fairly one-dimensional, relying almost exclusively on grassy hop flavors. I don't necessarily think that it is categorically a bad thing, but I would like a little bit more."
"This beer is much like all the other Pilsners out there. It's got the tradional grassy flavor with a little bit of hops. Could totally use mmore hops no doubt about that. This beer has a fizzy white head and a golden yellow color. The aroma is the best part of the beer. I feel that this beer is much too watered down."
"D- great drinkability! Look, this is not prima pils, but this is an awesome pilsner to enjoy when you don't want to mangle your palate. Great flavor that can be gulped"
"Mouthfeel was light bodied and amply carbonated. Drinkability is quite high if you're in the mood for a sold pils. With a low abv, you could definitely pack a few of these away on a warm day. A great alternative to the more established light beers in this country."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is big on hops, not much else. Definatly lacking malts and the refreshing nature of most pilseners. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has below average drinkability. Overall I found this to be a mediocre effort."
"A nice German Pilsner. Poured with a yellow body with a creamy soft looking head of a finger's breadth. SMelt nice and bready with sweet grain flavors layered well behind a nice dry hop character. Very easy drinking this is nice to settle on, just under 5% alcohol."
"Golden yellow, big, fat carbonation bubbles. White head did not retain for long (probably not the best glassware...). Spicy, floral hop aroma (Saaz?). Tastes great. More of a herbal hop, chalky bitter finish however starts with a bready malt backbone. Doesn't linger too long and is very refreshing. Yum."
"D- does not get more drinkable than this, nice and refreshing, could probably knock 6 back"
"This beer pours crystal clear, golden in color with a thin white head. The aromas that come off of this beer are clean and crisp with lemon and subtle earthy hops. The flavor continues the lemon aroma and follows with a clean smooth Noble hop bitterness. In the back, I can taste a bit of honey and bread. The carbonation is spot on while remaining light and refreshing. This beer is not a summer seasonal, but available year round. I can drink this one on the hottest day of the Summer and the snowiest Winter night."
"Appearance is a light golden color with a small head, that sits atop for a little while. Its` smell contains bread, malt, sugar, a basic pils profile. Taking a sip, I taste more malt, some hops, some sweetness, with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the pilsener style, with just the right carbonation level. The drinkability is also good, this is a great beer to session. I have seen Pikeland Pils on the shelf for a while and am glad that I finally got around to trying it...recommended."
"Smells pretty good, fairly crisp and lightly sweet. The floral and noble hops arent't overpowering, but aren't shy, either. Nice punch of bitterness, with leafy and tangy hop flavors that linger. A surprisingly thickish feel is enhanced by moderate carbonation. Light grainy and grassy notes. Could be a touch crisper and spicier, but a very tasty pils that gets an easy recommendation from me."
"The flavor has a wondefully spicy and lots of fresh hop alongside a slight dry mineral yeast element. The flavor is good and zesty w/ spice and mild tinge of cracker-like pilsner malt w/ slight tinge of grassiness as it finishes. This is a quality pilsner -I could see having this with a plain cheese pizza or a nice meat pie, I enjoyed this a lot and respect the brewers of Slyfox for making such a quality lager. a little more bitter than it needs to be, but it is highly drinkable and I like the dry refreshing flavor profile it provides."
"D -- Highly drinkable beer; nothing outrageous or distracting and very satisfying."
"Pours a very attractive bright yellow sunflower color with a very nice fluffy white head. The head retention is great and when you take a sip it leaves phenomenal lacing. The aroma is very acidic, almost like lemons and tangerines and their rinds. The flavor Has a distinct acidic bitter citrus rind component that makes it a little over the top. The mouthfeel is very crisp and clean and refreshing. Drinkability is also very nice. Easy to drink and has a very nice and low abv to make this sessionable."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet maltiness and a small hop presence. In the taste, a clean, sweet malt and a nice Bavarian hop. A small bite and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry Bavarian hop aftertaste. Refreshing and clean, somewhat like a standard pils."
"D- I really want to like pilseners. I like what they represent, the OG of beers, light crisp refreshing easy to drink with delicate flavor profiles that seem to be really appreciated by the refined beer palate...I guess I am just not there yet. Pilseners always seem a little tinny/metallic to me. Guess I will have to keep at it. Not a bad beer, great for the hot weather, and love the can man!"
"Translucent golden with white bubbly head. Aroma of hops, citrus notes, yeast. Flavors of light hops, buttery, bitter finish and grassy dryness. Light carbonation goes well with the light hop flavors and allows the dryness to really set in on the palate. A sly move putting this pilsener in a can, tricky tricky."
"D - not a bad Pils, had no problems putting down two pints of this. refreshing and a good start to the night, would consider this as a summer ""session"" beer."
"Good stuff -- light, refreshing, but pretty flavorful for its ""size."" Great outdoor, warm weather beer. Another great PA pils!"
"This is a great easygoing beer. Full of flavor and goes down easy. Another excellent beer from the beautiful state of Pennsylvania."
"This is certainly an easy drinking beer; I like it a lot. Were this local to me, it would sate my periodic craving for pilsner with ease. I'm glad I picked up a six pack instead of a single. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: This is really an enjoyable pilsener. I like the nice dose of hops they give it."
"D/O - What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good Pils. It's not my favorite PA Pils(Stoudts), but it's up there. It's well worth a taste if you're a fan of American made Pilseners. As the days get longer and the temperature rises, I see many more sixers of this disappearing from my fridge. Prost!"
"I can't find really anything wrong with this pils amazing how this beer is only rated a B on here.Another score from the PA breweries for making anohther great German Pils."
"D- very drinkable. Not overpowering and very light. Would probably be a good gateway beer for a craft newbie."
"Crystal clear golden pristine beer commerical appearance, bright white head forms thick. Scattered rings of fine lacing form nicely with each sip. Aroma has a bright green hop presence full of grassiness and herbal hop notes, packed with Saaz that's for sure. A nice mineral water and biscuit malt sweetness balancing out the hops. Flavor is a bitter semi sweet mix of malts and hops but finishes a bit heavier with the earthy herbal noble hops. Malt is lightly sweet with a biscuit malt and grassy note. Finishes with a slight metallic note giving an earthy mineral content to the whole experience. Mouthfeel overall has light feel to it with herbal grassy hops provideing a dry finish. Drinkability overall is pretty poundable one of the great summer brews in cans that I will be bringing with me to the games. Easily one of the better brews in cans overall and it has medals to proves it's viability as a pils."
"Poured from a can with a best buy 5/16/10 date stamped on the bottom. Poured into a imperial pint glass with about 2 inches of head. Lot of carbonation, bright yellow color. Scents of grass and sweet hops. Very flavor forward crisp almost lemon like flavors. Lots of hops but not overwhelming. Very balanced flavor and easy to drink. Not watery, not boozy a great spring and summer beer. Paired nicely with some hot wings and nachos."
"I poured from a 12 ounce can into my SA perfect pint glass. It is pale, clear and straw in color, the 2 finger head recedes as fast as it forms. The aroma is grassy, spicy. The flavor follows the nose. The finish is dry and leaves a spicy/lemony bitterness. It is light in body, and well carbonated. A good pilsner, crisp and clean."
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing and drinkable brew and I could easily have another without hesitation. As I have in the past I'll continue to include this beer in its rotation along with some of the other favorite Pils style beers so there is no question I'll be having this beer again."
"Got a can from a buddy up north. Poured it into a pint glass. Got a nice little foam that turned into thin fingers in a minute, over a straw colored body. Smells a little malty, a little hoppy, and like it has a complex sweetness behind it. I really like the smell. Tastes less sweet than it smells, with a reasonable but changing hoppiness and a crisp finish. I sure wouldn't mind having a few more."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very smooth, about perfect for style. If people could buy a case of a beer like this for $17-20, I think that the BMC's would see a major sales hit."
"D - Great. It's clean without any off flavors, session-able, and dry enough to keep me coming back for another sip. Perfectly enjoyable in the dead of winter. My first beer from Sly Fox. Can't wait to try more."
"this is not what i really consider a pilsner but its good. it was poured at around 46-48 degrees, it may need to be chilled a bit more. lots of character."
"D-very good representation of the style. very, drinkable. I would drink this beer again."
"Drinkability: An absolute perfect session beer. The taste is spot on for a Pils, and offers a nice mix of simple flavors that are absolutely perfect when relaxing on a cold winters night. Simply put, a quality beer that I would recommend to anybody."
"Pours a nice light and bright golden yellow color, with full merangue like head and great retention and lacing. Smell is of grass, freshly dried grains and light note of lemon. Taste follows scent with the grassy and freshly dried grains complimented well by a lemony note, which at times seems to get in the way. Fully carbonated, light body, refreshing. Would love to revisit this beer and have this replace the BMC light products at future non-beer head gatherings."
"It was volital to pour getting a hugh head which part of it never disappeared and was stiff. It laced really well and had the great German pilsner aroma. It also had a great old world taste to it. I really enjoyed this brew and regret taking 2 years to open it."
"Very easy drinking. Goes down quickly."
"Would I buy more of it? - Its a tough call, I might try a pint on draft at the brewery but I don't think I'd buy more cans. Its not that isn't a good beer, its just the style that I don't go crazy over."
"This is the most authentic tasting North German pilsner brewed in America that I've had. Quite nice."
"Goes down easy."
"Drinkability: Light and refreshing, and flavorful without being too much. Easily and highly sessionable for the summer months. I'll be returning to this I imagine."
"Flavor is very similar to aroma with a silky, creamy pilsner malt body with hints of grass and straw and a crisp earthy subtle hop presence that provides an excellent balance. Slightly dry finish. A very nice session beer that is perfect for drinking outside in the warmer months."
"Appearance and smell were nothing too fancy. This is a pilsner. The taste (for a pilsner) was very full and robust. You tasted the hop sharpness but also the pilsner malt was nice and light to the taste. The carbonation was nice and high (not too high) for this light beverage. I really which I had a case of this stuff."
"Dr. Very much so. Easy, crisp, and light, but full of flavor."
"D: One of the top, for sure. The cans are a nice touch as well."
"Goes down like water, which is a bit dangerous when you're nursing 3 days sobriety and have suffered through a whole bunch of hot bike rides, as I have. This was gone almost as soon as I opened it!"
"Poured into an American pint glass from the can. Looks great in the glass. Light wispy head that quickly dies, light golden in color, light carbonation. The nose reveals german hops, light and grassy, slightly bready, and CO2. The taste is decent, but a little heavy in the metallic hops and a little light in the malt dept. After a few sips the hops prevail as the dominating taste leaving little room for much of anything else. Mouthfeel is very dry, a little too dry for my taste. Drinkability is decent. Sessionable ABV helps this score a bit."
"Taste is fairly bitter and some light lemon. Very light and refreshing. Perfect for this humid, mid 80 degrees day out on the patio. Not overly complex, but very smooth and easy to drink. Just what I was looking for this evening. Good beer."
"Highly drinkable pils. This is a fabulous beer out of a can. Perfect for a hot summer day at the beach, on the river, or by the pool. A definite drinker where glass may not be allowed."
"Crisp, clean, and refreshing. A supremely easy drinker. A pilsener with some character. Hard to beat that."
"""I smell laundry detergent... like fabric softener."""
"An average brew. Would work with a kielbasa on a roll. Nothing to go try and find. To much distraction from few good qualities makes this one nothing special."
"A solid brew from Sly Fox - worth checking out."
"This is a very enjoyable and easy drinking beer. Being from a can took nothing away from it. Definitely a brew that you can have more than one."
"the nose has a stink to it i find delicious... along with sweet corn, pils malt, lemon, grass and earthy grain. the flavor is pretty much spot on the same... with a grassy finish and pils dryness. one exception is how surprisingly sweet it is??? this is not an issue however as the prickly carbonation and light to medium body keep it very refreshing... 7/3/6/4/14/3.4"
"D. I have found my new favorite session beer--and its in a can!! Too bad I cannot get it here in GA."
"A very nice example of the style, and another fine canned beer from Sly Fox. This pilsener goes down quite easy. This has to be one of the cheapest crafts I can get, and it is amazing."
"D- A true session beer clocking in at just under 5%. I would gladly drink a few of these on a hot summer day but it leaves something to be desired while i drink this in the dead of winter. Would love to try this on tap at some point. A great session brew by Sly Fox, nothing more nothing less."
"Overall a very tasty pils. Good American adaptation."
"Not bad, not real good, strictly average. That's all I have."
" When I gave on of these to a friend he said ""It's a better version of budweiser!"" I can agree that it's better than bud. It has a great drinkability but does so while having actual flavor, although a subtle one. But when you are looking for a brew to kick back with and consume a few at a time, you don't want something with an overwhelming flavor."
"Overall: A big thanks to DrJay for this beer. I liked it for what it was. I am not a huge fan of the style, but the beer was pretty good."
"The closest thing, along with Victory Prima Pils, to the real german pilsners. Nothing can really match the originals or the freshness when had on tap in Germany. But the Pikeland Pils is really good."
"6/3/6/4/13 (3.2/5)"
"D - I really don't like pilsners they just don't do it for me other than two other exceptions. This can is almost six months past its best by date so I can only imagine what this is like fresh. With that being said do cans help keep beer fresher longer? I already pimp cans so I'm a little biased but I think so. This is an excellent beer that I wish was sold in Texas if it was maybe I would be able to say I like pilsners either way this is a must try beer from a can. Not because of the novelty of the can but because its a very good beer."
"This guy goes down way too easy. I have neglected this beer for way too long. My new go to pilsner."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very carbonated, which is what I expect out of a good pils. Incredibly easy drinking."
"D-Very high. It just goes down so smooth and with the low abv you can drink it all night. It also gets points for being in a can. I fist picked this up to take to a concert and I was not disappointed."
"Taste is very nice compared to the smell. A nice spicy hop note with a typical pilsner malt profile. Crisp and quenching and a great session beer."
"for someone who isnt huge on the style i would drink this beer. it wouldn't be on my top ten but if it was this or some domestic swill i would take this in a heartbeat."
"D: A bit off from metallic notes, but refreshing and pleasant otherwise."
"D - Awesome pilsner... Lots of flavor... Great moutfeel... Looks fantastic..."
"Many thanks Scott."
"This is something I'd have all the time if it were in my region."
" the same style."
"Not that I've had a lot of craft pilsners (there aren't a whole lot out there!) but this is great and just behind IMO Moonlight's Reality Czech. I also liked Prima Pils but I haven't revisted it in a while."
"This is a very good Pilsner which will challenge your tastebuds and grow on you."
"D- This is a good pilsener. Done well. I would love to have this one again but won't seek it out as a must have."
"The SlyFox Pikeland Pilsner is a unique beer for Lowe Bucks County, since a few places outside of SlyFox serves it. it has a unique hoppy taste that is familialr with several lagers and ales that are brewed in Pennsylvania. i tried this beer for the first time, and, even with the unique hoppy taste, I love this beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with a full white head. Aroma is medium sweet, grassy and citrus. Flavor is grassy, herbal, lemon and nice bitterness. Light bodied, slick texture. One of the better American Pilsners I have had in some time. I'll definitely try other Aly Fox beers."
"D - A solid, refreshing Pils that makes for easy drinking being in a can."
"Mouthfeel is clean and fresh. Drinkability is just fine. This is a nice pilsner, very inoffensive but there are certainly better choices out there within this style."
"Welcome to my fridge, Sly Fox."
"This is a medium bodies pils that is tasty and easy to drink. It was quite refreshing in the 90+ heat."
"D: clean, crisp and refreshing. easy to drink and low abv with minimal bitter aftertaste make this very sessionable"
"Bottle courtesy of leftmindedrighty. Thanks! Pours light golden with a big meringue like lasting bright white head. Smell is lightly malty, yeasty and fruity. Taste is balanced, sweet fruity and nice and crisply bitter. Very drinkable, with grassy, bitter sharp hops. Lightly fruity and very, very nice."
"Poured from the can into a shaker pint glass. Pours a golden color with a bit of auburn haze to it. Nice fluffy white head with the aggressive pour. Decent hop aroma for a pilsner. Taste is a bit bitter at first but then mellows with a nice light hop finish. I get som malt smoothness as the beer warms a bit. I nice session beer- very appropriate for the summer."
"Overall an excellent pils that is only beaten out by the Prima. This is my second favorite pils and I would gladly drink it anytime. Great work Sly Fox."
"This pours out a delicious looking transparent straw yellow color with plenty of head and lacing. There's a slight bit of haze in the glass and it's slowly cycloneing downward to the bottom. Very pretty. This has a very clean and crisp smell to it, a medium amount of citrus hops shine through. Taste is very similar to the smell, but with a much more skunky bitter taste to it. Great attack. This pilsner is very light on the tongue. If I can get Sly Fox up here I would definitely drink more of it!"
"A solid Pils for sure, this packs a good taste and excellent drinkibility into one fresh tasting can of beer. Great for summer drinking folks!"
"D-Certianly not my favorite style, I prefer Phoenix Pale Ale much more, but this brew is well done and true to style. It didnt win a GABF Gold Medal for nothing! It is infinitely drinkable and would be easy to throw back can after can. A great beer to take a sixer along to a summer gathering when you dont want to lower your standards to the guest BMC offerings!"
"When poured into a Pilsner glass, this Sly Fox brew is a clear, bright, and shiny lemon yellow color with a decent 1/2 inch creamy head of white foam. It had great retention that left behind a small white film and loads of white streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma was very dry and spicy with some spicy German hops and a splash of malts. There was nothing more in the aroma than just the malts and hops. It was just your basic Pilsner aroma. This Pilsner is dry with dried floral hops and just a touch of malt. It was like the aroma, but what it lacked in flavors, the spicy bitter hops taste made up the difference. The mouthfeel was light with a refreshing bitter aftertaste of dried floral hops. In the end, a nice refreshing bitter canned beer that would make a great choice for a summer session beer."
"Pikeland Pils is a boldly bitter beer. At first, I thought it might be better with a little less bite, but as a finished the glass, I craved another."
"A very good ""session"" beer. Great to drink!"
"Cheers!"
"Overall-lacking that punch or extra characters that makes it measure up in this land of Prima, Sunshine, and Peregrine Pils. Still an ok version of the style, but I was hoping for more. Also a pilsner glass would be good next time."
"Drinkability: Excellent. A great take on this style. If you like this style, then try this one. It has a good deal of flavor and is a well crafted-pilsner. I could drink quite a few of these...."
"D: Not my favorite style, but this was good for the style. Worth trying. One of the best beers Ive had out of a can!"
"Pours a clear straw yellow color with at least 1 inch of foamy white head which has great retention and spotty lacing on the glass, especially at the top. Smells are plentiful and strong with lemon, spicy and citrus hops, and light malt and bread. Taste is very biscuity up front, with some honey and lemon butter with a dried grass hop finish. Medium-light in body with good carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. A fairly good pils that would go great while out fishing or doing some other activity where cans would be more convenient than bottles."
"Very flavorful and refreshing. The taste description above may seem spartan but the flavor subtleties are innumerable and difficult to describe. Definitely recommended."
"Pours out a straw yellow under a light but thick and frothy white head. Decent head retention and spotty lacing. Clean and pleasant aromas of lemon, straw and light malts along with a fairly hefty nose full of spicy/citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is average; light and clean with a minerally dry finish. Flavor starts out with a reserved lemon zest, honey and light sweet malty presence followed by a crisp and somewhat dry herbal and raw spice hoppy bitterness. Finish is long, refreshing and dry. Shows off a very nice balance between the sweet malts and herbal-like hops. Quite easy goin down and enjoying a few of these would be no problem ."
"Overall, a pretty good pilsener. Certainly drinkable and pleasant smelling/tasting, but nothing made me say, ""Wow, that was good."""
"D- Not much here if you like this then it would be easy to drink a lot of them but I personally won't be having another."
"D: Could spend the better part of an afternoon or evening with a few rounds of this brew."
"I am really starting to like the designs on the Sly Fox cans. This one has a large hop cone on the front. Enough talk about the container, on to the beer. This one was bright yellow and transparent. The head was stark white, rocky and HUGE! The smell was earthy and slightly like baked bread (yeast anyone?). The flavor is subtle and crisp. The only flavor I can pick out is yeast. The aftertaste lingers but is actually not bad. This beer would be perfect for hot days; it makes me think of baseball games."
"Notes: In my notes, I wrote the word ""bite"" three times. The combination from the spicey and bitter hops, along with the spritzy feel, made it feel like it was ""biting"" a bit, if you know what I mean. That's not intended to be a negative comment, just a descriptive one. . . . My first experience with Pikeland Pils was on a canoe trip down the Delaware River this past weekend, and I was real glad to have it instead of the usual canned schwag you're stuck with in such circumstances. Thanks to Sly Fox and the other craft brewers who've begun putting good beers in cans, giving us more beer drinking options. . . ."
"Can courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a hazy deep yellow color pils with a nice white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of dry malt with some crisp german hops. Taste is also dominated by some dry malt and a dry crisp hoppy finish. Body is above average with some low filtration and lees at the bottom. While this is a good pils I thought it miss some of the floral aspect that I usually like in the style."
"Poured a light pale yellow with a huge fizzy white head. I had to actually wait to pour the rest in the glass. Cans give awesome head retention I must say. The head had a nice slow fade and left behind lots of lace. This color was very very bright and had lots of sediment in the bottom. Smell was very light and crisp. Smelled very lively. Nice light lemon and grass flavors, with a hint of yeast and grain. The taste was just great, smooth, big carbonation made it very refreshing. Very very hoppy for a pilsner with a nice pine resin flavor and hints of grapefruit, and pineapple and lemon. Big dry finish that was nice and bitter. This was awesome and really awoke a rekindling of the pilsner. I normally find them a bit bland, but this has renewed my intrest and I look forward to trying some again in the warmer months to come."
"Clean and refreshing and perfect to set in the bottom of a boat to keep cool while fishing on a warm lazy summer afternoon."
"While there are better pils to be had from PA breweries (namely Sunshine and Prima), this is still a very solid choice. It's very drinkable right from the can, which is quite a nice change of pace. I have had no problems drinking a few cans with a meal (pizza & wings) or while just hanging out."
"Drinkability: A decent American pils that is right up there with Victory's"
"Truly, it's beers like this that justify my condemnation of the Big Boys. What they turn out is consistent, perhaps, but it's also crap. Now this is an American pilsner that tastes good, doesn't turn my stomach, I could drink several of, and it's craft-brewed and comes in a can. Can't say that about MGD or it's ilk!"
"I haven't had too many Pilseners quite like this one. It's alot more flavorful than most, with a great deal more hoppiness than aniticipated. The drinkablility is amazing. It's truly one of only a few beers I could see myself getting an entire case of... Thanks SkinnyElvis!"
"Thank you zrrbrrt!"
"12 ounce can, (gotta love this trend towards more quality brew in cans) no freshness indicator/information. Pours cloudy light yellowy amber, with a nice, fine near white head, that leaves pentiful fine and quite sticky ringed lacing. Nose is softly of flowery, grassy hops and some light sugary malts. Soft, smooth, light and refreshing brew. Grassy and crisp. Easy drinking and nicely crafted. Bring on the chicken ,sausage, salads and cheese. Nice offering, recommended."
"Great beer - wish I had more (hard to find a six pack this far West) Very flavorful beer - you could cut it 50/50 with water and it would still have more taste than most Pilsners. Beyond the taste this may be one of the best looking beers I've ever seen. Even though it comes in a can and lots of American Pils drinkers will glug it straight from the aluminum this beer just begs to be poured into a long tall Pilsner glass."
"Straw colored body with a slight haze poured out of the can, topped off by a huge foamy head. A grassy aroma with a bit of floral smell and some lemon. So far, this appears to be a hefeweizen. A dry finish with a light hop presence. Light and crisp...and very drinkable. I am impressed that it is from a can, I am usually against beverages in a can due to the taste. This is an exception. A fine offering."
"D - Bitterness wasn't overpowering...this led to a very drinkable selection from Sly Fox."
"I had this 10 times out of the can before pouring it into a glass to review it. It poured a clear yellow with a fast dissolving fluffy white head. The smell was dominated by woody earthy hops, and there wasnt' much else. The taste was nicely bitter and woody; the beer started and ended bitter, not much malt getting through. It has a thin body with nice carbonation. It is not as refreshing as other pils, but it was a great vacation beer for drinking on the beach or by the pool."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Not my favorite style, nor do I have the most experience with it but this is spot on as far as what a pils should be in my opinion. Hats off again to Sly Fox for these ""craft beer in cans"" creations."
"I don't know what this beer looks like. I simply drank it straight from the can. It has a very big hop flavor and bitterness to it. I'm surprised this isn't an IPA with the amount of bitterness in it. Definitely could taste the citrusy and pine-like flavors in the beer. This beer has a lot of up-front flavor which is nice, adds to the complexity but finishes really dry. Drinking it from the can it actually left a metalic flavor in my mouth. Weird. But this is a good beer. I can't wait to try the rest of their beers."
"this is my 2006 summer session beer, and i'm thrilled that it isn't a seasonal offering."
"My only concern is the cost, since I don't understand the nuances of Pilsner, the price seemed high for a lighetr style of beer."
"12 ounce can. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"Note: You have got to be kidding me craft beer in a can? This is a Pilsner from a can that will not jerk you around."
"Who'd have thought that great beer can come out of a can? Well, it certainly does now."
"BTW, that swig I got from the can was de-lic-ious!"
"Quality PA pils in a can? Can you say ""beach beer""."
"Poured a clear golden color with massive white puffy head. Smell is hoppy , flowery, and quite enjoyable. Taste is strong and malty with a nice crispness. Nice hop bitterness to balance the maltiness. Finish is nicely bitter with a good dry ending. A very nice easy drinking flavorful beer."
"Taste is floral, and citrusy. There is some malt presence, but nothing to write home about. Also, in the can, I have been getting and odd aftertaste. I mean this beer is rather drinkable, and it could stand for a good gateway beer for the bud-miller crowd, it definately has something lacking. Good, but nowhere near some of their other stuff"
"Craft beer in a can. YES. It works. And well."
"The crisp refreshing nature brings thirst to a screeching halt, but the experience demands more and more no matter how slaked that thirst may be. It's about as stridently crisp and clean as I can remember having, almost a hoppy knife's edge, delivering satisfaction, but leaving a desire for more. The sole misstep in the aroma wasn't ignorable, but I can easily look past it in saying that this beer is about as drinkable as I'd want one to be. Maybe it's not for everyone, as pugnacious as it is, but that's okay, because it just means more for me."
"Pours a light straw color with a full coat of head over top that is maintained by a big cascade of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. Clarity is fantastic on this one. Solid looking brew. Nose is dominated by a very nice herbal and floral halertau hop, with a lighter crisp and lightly sweet pilsner malt behind it. It seems a touch light, and I'd like a bit more of what is already there. The flavor is really working for me. Initially it delivers a very solid floral hop, with just a hint of very lightly grainy pilsner malt sweetness behind it, moving to a more herbal blast from the hop intertwined with a very clean and enticing bitterness. It is slightly skewed towards the hop, but I really enjoy the hop character that this one presents. It makes me want to brew a nice old world pilsner. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a solid moderate carbonation. I would definately keep this one around if it were available around here. This one would be awesome to break out at the campfire in the summer or carry in my backpack when out chasing insects in the field. This one is a true winner."
"Light gold color with a white head. Smell of grassy hops with the slightest citrus. Taste is smooth and malty with a grassy slightly spicey hops note. I believe it's mostly Saaz hops coming through. Very dry. I would have put this more in a Czech Pilsener style. Light body and very drinkable. I had one of these last night and it struck me as a little bit harsh, tonight it is tasting very good. This would be a great pool party or boating on the river kind of beer. A second fine canned offering from Sly Fox."
"This is a really solid Pils, a style I am starting to warm up to. The pour on this was a slightly clouded golden yellow with a one fingered head that only stuck around for a sip or two. The smell showed a nice hop backbone with citrus and herbal/grassy scents lingering. The taste was clean and crisp with a nice balanced flavor that made you realize that not all Pils are created equal. This one clearly is a cut above with a slightly hoppy profile that doesn't overwhelm, nicely complimenting the crisp body of this beer."
"Crystal clear yellow/gold with a rocky white head. Decent retention and spotty lacing. Clean grain aroma with plenty of floral hops and light citrus character. These qualities carry into the flavour, but are balanced by a solid bitterness and hint of earthiness in the hops. Light body with generous, crisp carbonation. Well attenuated. This is a really good lager with plenty of hop character. Nicely done!"
"All the flavors are subtle--sweet biscuits, bread, hops with a tinge of citrus. This is a very traditional interpretation of a pilsner, executed with skill and precision. A minor nitpick is that the taste, as foreshadowed by the smell, has a dry, grassy overtone that takes the beer down a notch...a small notch. I'm not crazy about Pilsner Urquell, at least the version available in the States, but people say it's much better in Europe, where it's fresh. Sly Fox Pikeland Pils tastes the way I imagine that a fresh Pils Urquell tastes."
"Good beer in a can, what will they think of next? The Pikeland Pils poured a light yellow color with a medium white head that stayed around while I drank it. The aroma was nice and citrusy with a bit of malt. The taste is lemony, maybe some grapefruit, refreshing. This is a smooth and drinkable pils and another good selection from Sly Fox."
"Don't skip out on this one just because it's a pilsner. It's a winner, and it won't disappoint."
"The mouth feel was light and slightly sticky with a small tingly carbonation."
"Clear bright golden hue is quickly the foundation to a siperb foamy white head that lasts forever. Fair toasted and bready malts serve as a base to the wondrous floral hops that characterize this beer. Leafy, lemony, herbal: vibrant hoppiness that emerge from the glass and brings you straight to Germany through a very dry portal. Citric in mouth, but in the course of a mineral and very crisp interplay, which makes it all work nicely.. Ahhh those flowery saaz. Light-medium bodied, extremely engaging carbonation. Remarkable pilsner!"
"Drinkable? Very much so. This is a beer you want more and more of."
"An incredible pilsener, to say the least. This fine, fine example of this style, presented itself before my eyes with a light, white-as-snow bubbly head, which quickly faded to a light lace along the side of the glass. One smell of this gem of a pilsener filled my mind with thought of fresh cut grass and herbal maltiness. An incredible tasting brew, the crispness on the palate was just one of this brews redeeming factors. I almost felt as if I could taste and.or experience each and every ingredient put into this work of art. While somewhat dry on its finish with a hint of bitter bite, this is still the classic German-style Pils I always love to try again and again."
"Bright, somewhat cloudy golden witha nice cap of the white stuff. The Aroma is very fruity, and filled with boat-loads of hops (saaz and a blend of a few others?). There is also a nice lemon tang in the aroma as well. The tastre is all saaz and lemon up front, slightly fruity and biscuit-like in the middle, and hoppy and slightly dry and spritzy in the finish. The mouthfeel is spritzy, refreshing, and alive and the drinkability is very, very, very good! A killer keller ;-)"
"Taste was light and slightly bitter towards then end. I definitely got the sensation of grapefruit juice and other citrus when I was tasting this beer. This Pils had a nice mouthfeel, but I thought it had a bit too much carbonation. In the end, I felt a little disappointed with this beer because I was expecting something tasting more like Pilsner Urquell...but despite this I finished off the growler anyway!"
"On tap at the Drafting Room. Poured out clear and light golden with white head of tiny bubbles that left a thin covering and light ring. The scent was mainly vineous. Tastes very dry, making it very drinkable. Bitter and yummy, piney. Leaves taste of hops on your tongue. Good brew."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The color is more bronze in nature to me. Carbonation is wonderful. Very small bubbles whic support a nice white head. Nice lace as one drinks it down. The nose to me is somewhere between being spice and fruit. It is very subtle and the hop character is detected in the nose. Very crisp clean finish. I could drink it all day."
"I picked up a sixtel of this and the Cascade IPA because I've been so impressed by Sly Fox brews thus far.... I'm even more so now. This pours a cloudy, light blonde color which is very hazy and has a sticky cloud-white head with nice lacing all down the glass. The smell is lemons, lime, grass, straw, flowery hops and sweet malts. The taste was surprisingly raw to me --- this is only my second ""keller"" pils. You can taste a lemony tartness which really gives this pils a nice kick. The mouthfeel is very crisp and dry with a hard bite that is really, really bitter in a good way --- something completely different from you standard pils, but I could imagine a filtered version of this as well. I'm not sure what the ABV is on this one (5% or so) but the drinkability level is very high. Think lemonade on a hot summer day, wheat beer like refreshing quality and all natural ingredients and style..."
"Cloudy hazy light peach color in the glass. Some small bubbles of carbonation and a slight white head. Not much nose, just a slight malt sweetness in the nose. Sweet malt taste with an astringent hop finish. Quite clean tasting. Lively carbonation swirls around the tongue creates a lively mouth. Sweet malt coating finish."
"One of the best Pilsners I have had to date. The balance of flavors is impeccable. Has a spicier-than-most-pilsners hop character, which hits you right at the start, leading to a delicious piney, malty middle. Finishes dry and rather bitter, with the hops still making themselves known. A great Pils!"
"I had tried the ""Keller"" style once before and enjoyed it so I figured I would give it a try,poured a nice unfiltered deep golden color with nice big rocky head.Very buttery taste with a good malt background,not a wimpy beer by any means,very easy to drink.A nice hand crafted brew you dont see very often,well done."
"This beer was part of a sampler at the Brewery. Poured a clear golden pale yellow color. Very crisp and as for a Pilsner, the taste is dead on. Everything that I enjoy in a Pils is here  Nice hop bite, clear, bright golden and effervescent. Very dry with a nice clean aftertaste. A very drinkable and high quality Pilsner beer."
"I believe that the Pikeland Pils is also served unfiltered as the Keller Pils; and it took a Gold medal at the GABF in 2000. It's brewed in the North German style and utilizes 100% German Pilsener malt alongside a combination of German and Czech hops to 44 IBU's. Its clear golden body is topped by a foamy, bright-white head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace before settling to a creamy collar and whispy surface covering. The nose displays a bouquet of boldly floral and spicy hops that are alive like the aromas of a late spring morning following a soft rain. Very vivid and lush! The body is light and combines with a fine/median carbonation to give a crisp mouthfeel. The flavor displays an aggressive combination of solid maltiness and bold hoppiness. The bitterness hits swift and hard up-front; and acts as a rock solid foundation for the firm malt and richly floral, spicy and mildly grassy hops that follow. It finishes dry with a mild residual bitterness. Clearly, a full-throttle pils that pulls no punches and satisfies from start to finish! Although hop-heads will assuredly be impressed with this beer, it's got enough balance, finesse, and floral hop character to attract a variety of drinkers. Exceptionally well-done and quite enjoyable!"
"Not a traditional Pils by any measure. Pours a quite cloudy yellow with a pretty substantial white head. Quite sweet with a nice dry crisp finish. Mouthfeel was quite good with a big body for the style. I had a tough time rating this one as they clearly think that it should be a pils, but there are so many things here that do not fit the style. Instead of penalizing, I rated the beer based on my enjoyment of it. Truly an interesting beer that should be the first one ordered when you visit."
