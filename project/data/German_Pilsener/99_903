3.26,-2.7,3.5,3,3.25,3.75,3.25,"Saranac Adirondack Lager (2013) - The first beer I ever drank was this brew. It was my introduction to the brewing world. I've come a long way, but I remember just how great I thought this was especially when I tried Coors or Bud or Millers (etc...) in subsequent sessions. Good fluffy head reduces to strong lacing. Reddish amber body. Good carbonation. Very active. Hoppy bitter smell. Sour apples and grapes. Smooth mouth feel. Lemon grass nose. Wheat grass and mild hops middle palate. Skunks a bit in the end to let you know it's a lager. But finishes clean. A little sour. A little bitter. Then grass and lemons on the back palate. The taste of a warm summer's day. Very refreshing. Crisp. After taste is crisp but good generic lager taste. Bitter hops and light malt. Lemon bread if you will. A great hot day brew. Good with BBQ or heavy meals that need a light side. Great alternative to a mainstream lager like Bud or Miller. Far smoother. More refined. Third Shift though changes and game putting this brew down a notch some 13 years from our first meeting. My tastes have matured. So what was once the standard and a 4 in 1999 has become a 3.25 in 2013. This is a good brew, but average. That isn't a put down. It still holds the standard and I would go back to it any time. A solid meal beer or a great end of the day kick back watching a ball game beer. Good.","digitalflood","Jul 03, 2013"

Also has a metallic note to it, not pleasant, but not a deal-breaker, either. Has a creamy, medium/heavy body with average carbonation. A beer that is too malt dominant to be a favorite of mine, also nothing really stands out here, besides the slight metallic taste.","JG-90","May 29, 2013"

The aroma reminisces graham crackers, with a controlled diacetyl taste. The malt profile is strong, and the hop profile has both the Hallertauer nobleness and the Cascade exuberance. In the taste, the cascade becomes even more discrete. I don't think there is an harmony between malt and hops, but it does not compromise the quality of this beer. The mineral taste in the water is welcome, and the finish leaves us with a very pleasant hoppy taste.","HabiMendes","Mar 10, 2013"

Smell was a lot of malt, a bit more yeasty than I expected. Hops not really present in smell. Tasted followed the nose; malty as expected, surprisingly yeasty, although only in flavor; the body was not affected. Mouthfeel was clean and crisp despite the yeast, with hops sneaking in at the end to pinch off the taste. In my opinion there are much better pilsener styles, but this lager is many steps above its mass-produced contemporaries.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jan 04, 2013"

No, the smell will not knock you over. And no, it doesnt look like its the nectar of the gods. But the taste, aftertaste, cost, and chug-ability of this beer is world class. Saranac attributes much of the wonderful taste of this beer to the water its uses from the Adirondacks. If thats true, and I believe it is, we should be buying bottled water of that stuff. The taste is super smooth, balanced, mild, and has a great aftertaste. This is the Michael Jordan of Lagers in the class of Acura's and Audi's. This beer is easy to drink, and tastes great on tap or in a bottle. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to have more than 3 beers tonight.","JTBacon","Aug 13, 2012"

I drank Saranac regularly when going to school in Southern New Hampshire about three years ago but haven't had it since. Took the top off with lighter and it shot across the room. Golden color with a lot of bubbles running up the side of the grass and almost no head. Nose is grainy sweetness and buttery bread. Flavor is subdued compared to the nose. Biscuity but extremely light. The end has a subtle fruity hit but it disappears quickly. That little fruity kick intrigued me to drink faster to try and find it, more defined, again. However it never really stuck out. Finishes crisp and tingly without a lot of dryness. A typical lager that was on the verge of making itself distinct.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 15, 2011"

Nose had a biscuit malt sweetness along with a wheaty cereal quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a slightly bitter, grassy tang to offset the wheatish sweetness. Nice lacing began to form throughout. Finish was semi-sweet with the grassy, wheaty taste lingering well after the swallow. A very pleasant beer.","woodychandler","Aug 07, 2011"

Aromas are roasty toasty, with a slight dark fruit sweetness in there that seems a bit out of place. The beer has flavors that also have a tangy sour-sweet fruit overtone...maybe plum or grape...that almost cover the toasted characteristics. The toasty turns to burnt in the aftertaste, like grilling a piece of fruit until it is charred. The finish is a little dry, with a cloying sweetness, also. Unique for the style, with a lot more flavors and characters than a usual pilsner. Not bad for a little change of pace.","GarthDanielson","Jul 30, 2011"

It has a nice body to it sure, but there just isn't anything exciting about it at all.","RblWthACoz","Dec 31, 2007"

Fruity aroma, seems to be from the yeast, a little malt sweetness with pleasantly floral hop nose. Low bitterness, fairly fruity with a hint of hop spice in the finish. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, just short of crisp, with a consistent texture throughout. Pretty tasty overall. The flavour in the finish is just a little off though, sort of reminds me of the bitterness you get from a very weak spice tea that's intended for a different beer.","DrJay","Aug 27, 2007"

This is a very inviting beer. The taste starts sweet with the malty tones with a slightly bitter finish but leaves the sweetness lingering on your tongue. The taste is somewhat subtle, built for the summer, and it is very refreshing. This one is in between a medium and light mouthfeel, leaning more towards light. The carbonation is good, and is a very easy drinker, would match up with just about any food, a great summer lager, but it could be enjoyed any time.

There were hints of fruit here as well, although they didnt really dominate in any way but had to be looked for somewhat. This is balanced nicely with the hop flavor, which comes out especially on the finish. Carbonation level is good - not so high that its fizzy and a nice accent to the hop-induced bitterness, especially in the finish. Its definitely a medium-bodied beer, a bit richer in flavor than many of the lighter summer brews.","Rootdog316","Jul 22, 2007"

I have been having a thing for lagers lately, so I am hoping this one does not let me down. Poured a very nice, crystal clear amber, nice orange hugh for a lager. Two inch white head faded quickly to just that quarter inch layer of film on the top. Very decent lacing for a lager as well was dripping down the sides. I could see some nice visible carbonation streaming up off the bottom of the glass, clarity excellent, overall look, A OK...Smell was lots of bready yeast smells. Lots of grain, kind of a moldy or off earthy aroma, like grass stuck in mud, or bread batter. A slight hint of hoppiness in the back as well. The taste was pretty standard at first, however as it warmed I detected a nice earthy grain mixed with almost a banana tone. A decent dry hoppy finish as wellThe feel was great, light and remarkable smooth. Great carbonation, not slick oily or otherwise detrimental at all. Superb drinkabilty, this is an easy session beer. Has such as nice light profile, yet great taste. Not watered down like some other lagers. Easily a hot weather drinker. Overall I really liked this, and thought it was much better then the pale ale, and would actually order or buy this one again.

I like lagers that don't have that scent to them, but I know that a lot of the "better" German lagers smell like that. Kind of bitter for the style -- balances out the sweet malt. As I said, not my thing, but a decent example of the style. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body, and if this beer appealed to you, I imagine you'd like to drink it all night.

It reduced down to pretty poor lacing after a few sips. the color reminds me of pasturized apple cider, but the taste was anthing but sweet or fruity.

The flavor is primarily hops and a fruity malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is average for this variety of beer. It's a very easy beer to drink. Easily consumed en masse, but while it is somewhat distinctive compared to other American Amber lagers, I'm not sure if that makes it necessarily better than the others.

There arent any smooth biscuit lager-like characteristics here at all. The metallic dryness carries long into the finish. Oh wait.

What constituted as a head didn't stick around very long either. No signs of lacing. Floral character in the aroma from the hops but sort of mixed up, can't distinguish any particular smell that dominates. A relatively good balance between the bitterness of the hops present and some roasted malts for sweetness, but it does come across as a hodgepodge of flavors that hasn't quite blended well yet.

If youre looking for something exotic in a brew, this is not it but IMO this is a very easy brew to drink in larger amounts because it is cheap (here in New York) and just has a solid taste to it.

The mouthfeel was thinner than medium, and the carbonation was more understated than I found in the Saranac Pale Ale and their IPA.

Soft caramel and husky grain upfront in aroma are contrasted by a gentle floral hop nose. Herbal Hallertauer hints surface as the brew breathes. Clean and tame aromawise. Flavorwise it exhibits a stately biscuit sweetness, which is partially offset by balmy hop bitterness. Hop flavor is far more herbal and chlorophyll like that the aroma implied. Hersbrucker? Agreeably understated in caramel malt character, with only subtle light toffee tones. Citrusy hints surface as it warms, but are overshadowed by the noble hop flavor. After the initial prickly carbonic acid bite diminishes, the mouthfeel is revealed to be mildly dextrinous and passably viscous. Finishes bittersweet, with floral, rose like hints balanced with a continuation of light caramel. A surprisingly balanced and enjoyable beer from an overall lackluster brewery.

Aroma starts off with a blast of malt, then moves to the classic shot of citrus from the Cascade hops. The aroma eventually settles to a really pleasant mix of malt and hops simultaneously, but is just too light. Head is smallish and leaves very quickly, leaving only a ring around the edge. Clear and amber, as I guess the name would imply. Pretty nice mix of malt and hops with heavier emphasis on the hops. Just lacking in intensity for my tastes. Slight citrus with some bitterness, neither is excessive and there is a decent malt backing. When colder it seems the malt could be stronger, but that seems less so as warms. Feel has strong presence of carbonation, with a thin body. Seems lager like. Some softenss and fluffiness too.

It's medium body combines with a fine, median carbonation that's just lightly crisp on the tongue. It's smooth, but also a bit lifeless. A light citrus hop flavor melds with a gently caramel malt and well-balanced bitterness. Some fruity notes make a minor appearance. It finishes short and dry.

The hop profile within the flavor saves this beer and gives it a little needed complexity. I like the aftertaste this beer leaves on my tongue, but the inital tast isn' t as pleasant to me as I was hoping. When it comes down to it this beer is not a winner in my book, and it doesn't even work as session brew for my tastebuds. Mediocre and better than a macro, but the flavors are all toned down in order to work as a cross over from flavorless to flavorful. I would put this beer in between those two.

2.91,-13.1,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"A slight harsh hoppy aroma and flavor at first, but then the maltiness comes in and evens things out. Not great but not bad. Will drink again if i am given some, but I would not go out and search for it.","stegmakk","Dec 27, 2002"
3.92,17,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice amber red hue, malty flavor, really nice medium bodied beer, not really much bitterness or hoppiness. Just a smooth moderately malty beer. Would make a good session beer, Beer # 8 of the 12 pack sampler gets a thumbs up fom me.","jtw5877","Dec 23, 2002"
3.09,-7.8,4.5,3,3,3,3,"This beer pours a sparkling clear copper color with amber highlights. I sports a decent whitish head that slowly recedes into a layer of foamy film. It leaves a respectable lacing behind. Perhaps there is a strong malt backgorund in this beer? Hmmmm, let's find out. The aroma is very much malt, bringing hints of some of my favorite bourbons to mind. Maybe a hint of hops in there as well. Nothing really spectacular. The first sip reveals a prominent sweetness up front with some decent bitterness in the finish. There is a grassy note to the finish and aftertatse. After a few more tastes, a bit more of the herbal taste comes thorugh, along with some citrus hop flavors. Tastes like the brewers used some Cascade hops in this one as well. (Should have read the bottle more closely.) The mouthfeel is average, but matches the flavor profile well. Not quite the malty flavor and body that I was hoping for after seeing the residual foam on the beer. Overall this is another decent beer from Saranac.","aaronh","Dec 19, 2002"
3.77,12.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"The Adirondack Amber poured an attractive color true to its name. A very thin head was well-retained throughout the tasting. The smell was of a sweet, strong maltiness with only the slightest hint of hops. This strong malt presence was reiterated in the taste, but the the hops asserted themselves a little more here. A good, fairly well-balanced taste was perceived. It went away a little too quickly at first, but stuck around later on in the tasting. I liked the taste, but expected a little more...maybe it was the hint of pure Adirondack water on the label. The Amber has a nice mouthfeel to it, with a medium body and pleasing efferevescence. Overall, the Adirondack Amber lager was drinkable, and I wouldn't be disappointed if this beer was slated for a session.","SchmichaelJ","Dec 11, 2002"

3.33,-0.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability & Notes: Not bad but this is no Sam Adams Lager! Many breweries take on the amber lager and come up with a less then par take on what should be a clean flavourful lager. This is does have flavour, just not in the right places … sort of a jumbled mess that is hard for the taste buds to decipher.","Jason","Nov 26, 2002"
3.73,11.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Not an amber that makes you want to jump up and down, but overall pretty pleasant. A little raw in the hops department up front, but the malt rolls in to take charge. A touch of tin in the finish, but not enough to throw it off.","Brent","Nov 17, 2002"

3.42,2.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Very malty and mellow, a great cigar beer. Nothing too complex going on here, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Amber color (duh) with a medium creamy head and sweet aroma.","Dogbrick","Sep 17, 2002"
4.35,29.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another winner from Saranac. This may be their best all-around beer. It's the malts, they're terrific and distinctive in every beer they brew. Matt Brewers expertly straddle the divide between old-time classic American lagers and the recent microbrew explosion. This example is such a well rounded beer that it is suitable for almost anything. Heftier than a golden lager, piney hops that make it refreshing, sweet caramel malts to deepen the flavor... it's all good, and I like it.","Thrasher","Aug 23, 2002"

2.73,-18.5,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"More gold in color than a traditional amber.  Fluffy white head.  Slight Malt nose with a hint of metalic odor.  Musty malt taste with a slightly bitter finish.  Smooth feel with good body to the brew, but the taste is slightly skunky/musty. Not one of the best amber beers I have had.  If you are going to have a saranac have a pils.","frank4sail","Jun 04, 2002"
4,19.4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Possibly my favorite in the Saranac line-up. Honey colored, with a slight chill haze. Rocky off-white head, dissipates to swirls of lacy thin bubbles. Clean, slightly malty aroma, balanced with some tangy hop fragrance. Taste is nicely balanced, with an initial hop bitterness that hits your tongue, then gives to a smooth, clean, malty finish. Some fruitiness in there as well. Nicely done.","mophie","Jun 02, 2002"
3.7,10.4,4,4,3,4,4.5,"Not a bad looking amber, but very simple.  I like a little more body to my ambers.  This beer has a pretty smooth finish and isn't at all offensive to the taste buds.","beernut7","May 06, 2002"

3.35,0,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very clear light amber with a healthy head that has retention. Nice little hop boquet. Pretty nice tasting beer here. It's got some bitterness. Not as much clean maltiness as I'd like in an amber lager, but it does have a crispness that is appropriate for lagers. Medium bodied. Slight lingering bitterness. Pretty nice beer here.","Bighuge","Apr 19, 2002"
3.6,7.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a light amber color with a smallish creamy head that sticks around for a little while.  Nice malty caramel aromas.  Taste is sweet caramel malt with some light hops thrown in to balance it out.  The malt is the first thing to hit the tongue with the hops lingering in the background before they get more agressive towards the end of the sip.  Sticky mouthfeel and pretty drinkable.  I think that this beer would be nice on milder spring and fall evenings.  It isn't quite light enough of body to have me drinking it in the summer time or heavy enough for the winter.  It isn't something that I would seek out but I would fall back on it in a bar or take it if offered.","Murph","Apr 11, 2002"

3.32,-0.9,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Spidery, clinging head, balanced nose.  Lasting taste and mouthfeel but I didn't detect a lot of cascade hop feel that the label mentioned.  Good, but not outstanding.  I guess this is what's mixed with the stout to make the Saranac Black and Tan.","ADR","Mar 01, 2002"
3.55,6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I have a soft spot for amber lagers.  New Amsterdam's Amber (Is that one still around?) used to be my old stand-by way back when.  They're nice starter beers, whether you're starting an evening or just starting to drink micros for the first time.  This one is a nice clean example with enough malt flavor and bitterness to keep it interesting.","pbrian","Feb 20, 2002"
3.83,14.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I tell you these Saranac variety cases are pretty good. Nice golden amber color, fully lagared to balance the sweetness & malt.

Overall a drinkable beer though...","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 17, 2002"
