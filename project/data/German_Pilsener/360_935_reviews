"good everyday beer. mild tasting and smooth"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad at all. Good German brew."
""
"Classic German pilsener which does the job as a thirst quencher pretty well."
""
"Overall, I'd say this is a run-of-the-pilsner, but the taste is just not good. I'm not fond of it."
""
"The skunkyness of this beer overrides and good qualities"
""
"Everything was fine with this beer until I took a drink. The malty taste just didn't work with the underlying pilsner taste. A disappointing beer."
""
"11.2 oz. bottle from Cost Plus. Amber in color with a small white head. Floral noble hop bitterness up front with a sweet finish of bread malt and a bit of lemon. Good amount of flavor. Not watery. Bitterness blends perfectly to offset the sweetness. Finish is crisp and refreshing. A very drinkable and satisfying pilsener."
"I enjoyed this beer. It is light and crisp."
""
"Normal beer. There isn't Nothing special."
"I had his on draught, not out of a can, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not quite sure why this has such a low rating."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my favorite Pilsner.  Easy drinking, clean & so agreeable with me.  A very ""Happy"" beer."
""

""

""

"Overall: Refreshing, and very smooth. Slightly watered down tasting, but hey, still one I'd pick up to try again months from now. Average."
""
""
"It was nice knowing you, Warsteiner. I'll meet up with you again if I ever get the Deutchland."
"I've had this several times, and like it each time. It's a mild malt and undertone of hops fused well with light roast flavor. There's many up and down opinions of this brew. My advice is to get a 6 pack and try it. Also try it with some good pretzels...Or my favorite pairing for this, pork n kruat."
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
"Pale yellow with a nice head that reduces to lacing. Not very pungent, decent light smell of well blended hops and malt.  Very European in taste, smell, and in look.  Imported.  Good beer.  I will session with this beer.  I had it with pretzels and they went well together."
"Watered down tasting pilsner. Not the best"
""
""
""
"Taste very good. The look is awesome."

"Enjoy"

"DATE TASTED: October 25, 2014... GLASSWARE: Warsteiner pokal... OCCASION: PSU/OSU white out again... APPEARANCE: champagne-like effervescence; crystal clear and golden yellow; vast, foamy white three-finger head; lacing represents confidently throughout ... AROMA: bread/dough malts mix with a metallic sharpness; some funky yeasts as well--not really appealing... PALATE: reasonably smooth; a flat finish; aftertaste is plausible; drinkable but not very memorable....TASTE: a liquid English muffin whose malts end in a woody, almost lagerish base; some corny residual, though thank God that's not a likely German adjunct... OVERALL: a pilsener that occupies the mouth for a few moments--crisp yet nondescript, Warsteiner is a year-rounder that probably needs a pairing (holiday party, dinner, snack?) to succeed...otherwise, a beer that's a bit more fun to say or see than it is to sip or savor..."

"Overall- not a bad beer, better than beck's and St. Pauli Girl"
"O:  love it ... no surprises here, though, for I love the true pilseners.  it's got that perfect earthy/black-pepper hop bite and some great sour grain/lemon taste on a nice little bed of sweet barley malt.  a brew I'll grab again and again."
"This is a solid beer offering from Warsteiner.  Crisp and light with a slightly off - skunk? - aroma. The taste is very pleasing if you like American domestics. Would highly recommend you try this beer if you enjoy slightly sweet, less hoppy, yet still malty tastes."

"Echoing Todd,  who said it's ""a no frills beer, but something nice and clean to switch to now and then"" - a great non-wheat summer beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Crisp, slightly sweet, nice strong bitterness.  Floral noble hop finish.  Would buy this a thousand times over."
"Smooth clean beer. No aftertaste/ending. Almost like an American domestic, but still very good."

"Clean, crisp, perfectly balanced German Pils. The taste lingers on despite the rather light body. The color is a gorgeous golden hue with perfect carbonation levels although the head retention was just about non existent. There is very little aroma. I certainly sensed that I was indulging in a mix of Pilsner and Munich malts balanced with noble hops. A very difficult style to nail but this beer is more than solid. Hop heads need not apply...I had this with a spicy Cajun shrimp dish and it was perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very drinkable, but fairly uncomplicated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Everyone's had at least one so-called pilsener in their life. Most of the mass produced beer on the market calls itself a pilsener but is in fact made with adjuncts. Hats off to Warsteiner for keeping things authentic with Premium Verum. Would I drink it again? Sure, there is a time and a place for this particular brew and it just so happens to be summertime now."

"Warsteiner Premium Verum brew by Warsteiner Brauerei with an Abv of 4.8 ABV. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. This brew looks like most brews on the market. The smell is rich with grains. Also some sweetness in the smell. The taste to this brew is rich and bold but also smooth. I'm picking up some sweetness like camel or resins. Warsteiner Premium Verum goes down real nice and smooth with a clean finish. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. I'm really liking this brew. This is a well balance brew. Nothing over powering in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a solid 4 out of 5. This is better than what I expected. I will by this brew again."
" Overall a 3.75 for Warsteiner Premium Verum from Warsteiner Brauerei. I was glad to pick a lighter true German brew for these near-swampy days. I will surely buy this brew again."

"Clear light golden pour with an immense head. Good lacing and retention for a pilsner. The nose is a light biscuit sweetness over just a touch of hops. Light medium body with normal carbonation which effervesces a bit on the finish. The flavor profile is low key, yet nicely balanced. It begins with a slight biscuit that flows into a slight bitterness against a slightly sweet background. The finish is crisp with a pleasant light bitterness that lingers a bit."

"A very drinkable and tasty pilsener. I also love to have one of these, whenever I can."
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable and worth having. Will drink, rinse and repeat."
""
"Poured it from bottle into Pilsner glass. Good head of over one inch, slight retention, leaving behind a little lace. Color is light yellow, clear with medium carbonation. First smell is bright floral. Medium mouthfeel, with balanced taste with slight bitterness and aftertaste. Overall a pleasant beer, nothing overwhelming but also nothing memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love the taste; not too sweet or bitter, and it's an overall stronger flavor of course than American style lagers. I usually drink it straight from the bottle a little cooler than room temp. My only gripe is that under those conditions it nearly always overflows out of the top upon being opened. Foam may look good in the TV spots but when there's enough to shave with it's too much. Others may disagree. I prefer Bitburger but that's not available in my area."

"Interesting."

"330 ml. bottle. Pours a clear yellow colour, with a nosrmal head that does not hold for too long, leaving some lace. Smell of grass, malt and citrus. Medium body and good carbonation, crispy palate. Taste is bitter, with citrus, grass, grains and some malt. OK."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodies brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall not bad for the style. Strange that there is no middle ground, it goes from sweet to lingeringly bitter and grassy."

"Nice 2 inch head with nice lacing afterwards. Color is very clear light yellowish gold almost like water. Heavy noticeable hop smell and aroma. Initial taste was very metallic that disappeared after subsequent sips. A little bit of bitterness that does not linger. Some slight sweetness. A little spice at the end. Label indicates this was brewed under German purity laws. Very light and easy beer to drink but nothing special in my opinion. Very plain and flat but clean tasting beer."

"O-Okay pilsner, but nothing special. States that its made with hop extract and not hops and it tastes like it. Somewhat flat and rounded."

"Enjoy!"

"Warsteiner pils in my opinion is an overly mild beer. It is a good pilsner in the sense that it is worth the money you pay for it and it is enjoyable. However I prefer the competition (namely bitburger). The hops are just not aggressive enough for my taste. The malt flavor is similarly soft. Don't get me wrong I don't think Warsteiner is bad, it's brewed for those who enjoy a softer pils. I however do not belong to that group. All that said I do like this beer."
""
""
"Brilliant straw with a prominent white head that slips down to a lasting sheet. Smells lightly fruity and dusty with a doughy sweetness and some floral hops. Taste is mostly all pale malt sweetness, but some vague grassy, husky hops show up towards the end. Clean, light, and pretty crisp which helps with the drinkability. Not too bad as a refreshing beverage, but bland and uninteresting. Certainty there are much better options out there to get your German pils fix."
"Overall, it's clean like Lindsay Lohan after a shot of weak grass, but still not exactly ""clean," ya feel me?"
""
""
"A very good beer. A 12 pack goes for $12.99 around here, which is quite affordable given the quality of this beer. Imported from Germany. Made with high quality ingredients. No adjuncts or additives. Clean. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Little head that dissipates quickly. Chardonnay-champagne color. Ok lager smell similar to Sapporo. Somewhat lacking flavor. Mouthful is quite good, with pleasant carbonation and weight although it leaves a watery not-exactly-pleasant aftertaste. Decent all in all but not worth the $11 I paid for a sixer, I prefer Stella in the same category."

"Nice color and clarity, familiar tang of lager beer in the nose; sourdough bread, biscuits, herbal spiciness. Taste was not crisp or bold as i had hoped, rather flabby and bland; some hop flavor coming through. I am a fan of assertive Euro Lagers like Stella Artois, Heineken and Becks, but Warsteiner offered a weak, adjuncty flavor that underwhelmed my palate and did not leave me wanting more."

"Overview - While it definitely gets points for it's presentation, it's lack of any substantial flavouring is it's downfall. Remember kids, just because it looks good doesn't mean it is good. However as is the case with most import beers, you're not getting the best product; if I wanted to do a truely fair review, I'd have to go to the Warsteiner Braeuerei itself and try a batch. As it stands however, I'm giving the Premium Verum One and a Half Stars out of Five."
""
"O- This brew was good at the start and better at the end."
""
""
"Light yellow with one finger head that fades quickly. Not a great smell. Smells like a domestic beer. Goes down very smooth. Grainy with a hint of hops. Light on the tongue. Leaves almost no aftertaste. It's an okay beer. I would drink it as a cheap alternative to domestics."
""
""
""
""
""
"Warsteiner is definitely an excellent pilsner. If you don't like it, you should question your own taste and sophistication--not that of this excellent beer."

"it's not my favorite style but it's decent and it brings a rush of memories. it's especially excellent now after an Underberg and the only thing better would be to be transported back in time to the heyday of Old World and The Rathskeller (and, i suppose, my youth). bratwurst and fried potatoes from mamma and pappa playing his music."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Not very complex. Straightforward and enjoyable. I'll have a few in the park this summer, I'm sure, though I can't see myself turning to this when the weather cools down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad at all. I rather enjoyed this Pils and wouldn't mind drinking it again."
""
""
""
"Overall - 3/5"
""
""
""
""
"Typical German Pilsner, decent and reliable, but don't expect any thrills."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very enjoyable beer which would pairs well with fancy food."
""
""
"This brew has no up front bittering hops profile, the hops seem to be there as a mild earthy spice (noble variety I think), but not all that bitter. This is a 100% malt forward beer and it is very unique. There are no flavors added, no lightening adjuncts and my guess is no filtering....its 100% malty goodness. This is as real as brew gets and the decoction mash makes it worth trying if you prefer your cold one on the malty side. I will order it again if I every see it offered on draft."
""
""
""
""
" I was pleasantly surprised to have this over the typical macro tailgating beer, but it isn't going to wow anyone. An ""ah, that'll do nicely"" kind of beer."
""
""
"Overall: It's a decent Summer beer for when you're looking to cool down more so than analyze it. I won't be buying it again, but I also wouldn't turn it down if offered to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor begins malty and seems spicier toward the finish with moderately smooth malt flavor and light hints of floral hops adding the mild fruitiness in the yeast. Overall a very good beer, not the best pilsner I have had though"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice German lager. It's drinkable and reflects the German style. Im sure this is reheitsgebot. I love these light lagers when it's warm outside. I've had better German style beers, and this one is just alright in comparison to others I have had. Nonetheless I like to support German brewing and fuehrers everywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Warsteiner Premium isn't the kind of hoppy, dry pilsener that American breweries are putting out these days. Perhaps that explains why it is undervalued at BeerAdvocate.com. But it is a beautiful representation of the drinkable sophistication that typifies German beer. I'll be revisiting this one."

"Great beer. I'd definitely buy again and recommend to others"
""
""
"The Verdict: Very good. A refreshing German pilsner with lots of flavor and more complexity than I expected."
""
""
""
"A decent enough pilsener, I guess, but it's a style I don't especially enjoy."
"My opinion is that German beer is what adjuncts aim for, and German beers are starting to become passe to the craft crowd. Nevertheless, Warsteiner Verum still holds up better to most traditional beers, and that distinct taste makes it go outside of the box with typical German beer."
"Quite a good, above average session German pick here... At the price and quality, this could easily even be appreciated by the casual drinking crowd. With the warm weather coming up, I could definitely have more of these, despite the muted hoppy nature and strong graininess. Pair with a club sandwich or bratwurst for good results!"
""
""
"Overall: Warsteiner is not as bad as most other pale lagers, but it is still not something I could see myself buying again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an okay beer, but not really worth while. It is an interesting pilsener - a bit different to the norm, but not necessarily in a good way. My biggest complaint, however, is this: it is AU$78 a case (2013), and isn't the best of beers. That's absolutely appalling. Not really much more to say about it than that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A tasty, easy drinking pilsener. Not a great beer but still pretty good."
""
"Good German Brew, pours out a big white head that has plenty of laceing. Clear and golden yellow color, with a light malty maybe bready and very clean cut. Has a sweet taste that is also very clean and crispy, which turns to dryness in the end. Has a sharp bitterness as well. This isnt maybe favorite German beer but its nice to change things up here and there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised with this beer if for no other reason that I always expected to not like Warsteiner. There is no good reason for this other than my incomprehensible prejudices with some things. In any case, I find this to be a nice example of a classic German style; excellent balance and complexity throughout. It's good to be proven wrong every so often..."

"Overall my favorite lawnmower lager. I drink this often."

""
""
""
""
"Yes."
"i very much enjoy this beer. its always refreshing and its a great starter if you are having a session on a few other imports. goes great with chicken. or curry. or vegetables. or anything actually. dont miss this beer."
"Very drinkable beer. Pilseners are not usually my go-to style of beer but this one was quite enjoyable. Very light in color with not a lot of head which was white. It gave a kind of sneak up on you kind of buzz (1 pt and oz's bottle). Carbonation on it was noticeable as the bubbles would rise to the top throughout the entire glass until empty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Paired with a club sandwich at Berlin Kulturcafe in Sucre, Bolivia. Grew on me over the meal, most especially the bitterness that plays itself out long after you drink it and made it better than pretty much any other pilsner here."
"I could have had another one of these in my session since it was light in alcoholic content and taste. No doubt that this beer would go great with pretzels and chips and reminded me of what a good old-school pilsener should taste like. While there are so many other styles that outdo beers like this, this is great to have when you want to crack something open and not be bombarded with hops, booze, and endless layers of flavors. On a slightly warmer day, this would hit the spot nicely during snack time."

"Nice looking beer. This reminds me a bit of the pils I had in Germany, but it's more on the lower end, like Bitburg. It's a very dry beer with quite a bit of flavor, that goes well with basic American food."
""
"A good pilsner despite what may be an outdated bottle. However, I can think of a few more that I enjoy significantly more. I wouldn’t buy it, but I sure wouldn’t turn one down if offered to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent , crisp brew that would be great as a thirst quencher of to accompany dinner."
""
""
"Overall - A good enough beer to drink regularly. I would pay for it again, I would drink it again, but I wouldn't seek it out. There are many other good beers out there for a similar price. Again, it is good, but not great."
"Hands down this is a straight forward German pislner. Every characteristic of this style was met, and there is nothing more to say. I have always enjoyed this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Surprisingly tasty. I could see working this in as a session beer. Its well priced, and the cans mean no skunked off flavors. Woot!"
""
""
"Overall, this is an interesting beer for me. I normally don't enjoy European lagers much, but this one is somewhat enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- A pretty near-perfect Pils. Light, crisp, refreshing with a good malt and hop character. Hoppy enough to not be a Helles, malt character unlike most U.S. Pilsners. I'll be damned if I don't really like this beer. Helps that it's crazy refreshing on a steaming hot day too -- along with a really sessionable ABV!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is super smooth, crisp with fine carbonation and medium body. I would say yes again for the Warsteiner, very easy drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: while a classic German pilsner, I found this disappointingly average."

"330ml bottle. Pilsner glass. Enjoyed on agt´12. Bright golden color. Chill haze. White froth creates a close, thick & lasting crown. Slightly metallic odor & floral fragrances, sweet malts & citric notes to the nose. Earthy, grainy & clean bitter flavor. Light to medium body. Fizzy carbonation. Watery texture. Sweet malts in the middle rounded by lemon touch. Dry bitter finish. Easy drinkability."
""
""
"Translucent yellow, almost good appearance with a frothy, two finger thick white colored head. Raw barley, mild hop bitterness, pale malts and light citrus on the aroma; very simple. Smooth and rich rye bread flavor and smoked barley on the first sip. Overall body is simplistic, where only the main ingredients of an average brew make themselves apparent. Light bodied with medium carbonation."

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a flute glass. Pours a light golden amber with a light head a bit of lacing. Light malt and hop aroma. Smooth, light malt and wheat , nothing really stands out. Well balanced, but not exciting. Did not have any adjunct flavors I feared from the color. Pretty standard decent German pilsner. Satisfactory dining-out beer in a pinch."
"was surprised to learn this was the beer in the first class cabin on a lufthansa flight from frankfurt to bangalore. after they mixed up my booking and put me in with the elite folks, i started pumping these. the first three were pretty substandard, not quite cold enough, and lacking body and complexity. this beer pours very light and clear, with a floating white lace head that has decent retention. smells like german crystal and pale malts, some faint sweetness and fresh baked dinner rolls form the aromatic palate of this brew. the flavor is a little less sexy, slightly watered down, and less bravado on the malts than the nose indicates. mouthfeel was less than stellar, too light for me, and too quick in the finish to even really taste it. that said though, its a heck of a session beer with a nice low abv and a smooth feel. by beers 4 through 6 i started liking it, and challenged myself to explain why. i started stasting more of the subtleties in the malt, and it opened up nicely for me, they also started coming out colder which i think helped. all up i put 8 of these back in an 8 hour flight, not too shabby, but i never really got drunk or anything. drinkable brew, but i wont purchase it."
"A delicious beer that, while not a benchmark, stays true to the pilsner style and quality. It may not be perfect, but it is well worth your money."
""
"O: Refreshing, easy to drink, and sessionable - this is a very enjoyable beer that pairs well with foods and is very nice in the summer."
""
""
"Body is medium-light and a bit watery; carbonation is brisk. Easy to drink but there are many better examples of the style on the market."
""
""
"Not a surprise that a mass produced German beer beats out American AALs by a mile but can’t hang with the elite American craft pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a spicy hop bite up front that lingers over the bready yeast and pale malt notes into a slightly dry finish. Nice grassy, earthy flavor with a decent amount of dry bitterness that doesn't overpower the other flavors. Hints of straw and bready yeast followed by pale biscuity malt. Well balanced, enjoyable session(able) beer."
""
""
""
"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pale yellow with a fluffy white head that holds good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas and tastes are similar: pilsner malt, sweet, grassy, finishes with a moderate sharp hop bite. Mouth-feel is rather thin with plenty of carbonation. Overall, it's obviously a German Pilsner, but there are better ones out there for the style = pretty average across the board."
""
""
""

"Overall a great beer if you like that dark bitter taste."

"The first time I had this I was really dissapointed, it was like I was drinking water with cornflakes in it, so strong was the cor flavour. After a trip to Germany where I had it again on tap and on bottles again in almost every restaurant, I start to believe that maybe my first Warsteiner was skunked. Today I had it again and it tasted quite okay, nice golden colour and all, except of the smell which was too corn-y once again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer. It has that euro lager yeast, musty aroma and taste, but it still has some great flavor. It's worth trying."
""
"Pours a light straw yellow color with a thick foamy white head. The smell is kind of grassy with a bit of funk and some grainy aromas. The taste is slightly bitter with a subtle flavor of grass and lemon. The beer is light with sharp carbonation and a slightly dry finish. This is a good German lager with lots of flavor and easy drinking."

"Pours a clear light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and some grape juice fruity aromas. Taste is pretty much the same along with a medium herbal bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but nothing too exciting really."
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow color, lots of microbubbles with a thin white foam head. smell has a skunky aroma. Taste is good with a nice bitter herbal hop finish that stays on well After swallowing. mouthfeel is dry, watery with high carbonation, crisp and clean overall this is a high quality beer and above average for the style. high drinkability, well worth a try and very sessionable."

"Overall – Not a bad pils, nice malty flavoring with a cool crisp tang to the mouth."

"O: I've had much worse beers. I've had much better beers. This is decidedly mediocre in pretty much every sense of the word. Nothing is really offensive, but nothing is memorable, either. A truly forgettable beer."

"O- This a very nice german pilsner , a little less skunky and a bit more flavor and body than Beck's. I think it is exactly what one should expect from a german pilsner. I would recomend this one for sure if your looking to quaff a few lagers."
""
"Overall a nice, easy-drinking session beer. Nothing extraordinary here, just a standard pilsner."

"warsteiner pils is a very pale yellow, with a modest amount of fluffy white lacing. Sweet, bready, crackers in the aroma with a bit of spicy and grassy hops. A mouthful reveals sweet base malts, which quickly get caught up with a somewhat strange bitterness. It finishes clean and fairly dry. Overall, it's not as lively tasting as the more expensive german pils, but for the price it's a good beer to have around when you just want to drink a beer. Just make sure it's fresh enough or it will lose much of it's already modest merit."

"D - It's a pretty easy drinker, though that's cause there ain't a whole lot going on. I'd pass on it."

"Overall: An excellent example of a German pilsner. Spicy hops and bready malts dominate this one. Definitely recommended."
"O: It's like Beck's but less offensive."
"Pours a pale clear straw. Huge persistent head. Smell is all grassy hops. Maybe a little background light malt. Nicely balanced sweet malt flavor with herbal and grassy noble hops. Somewhat light bodied. Lots of visible carbonation. Pretty standard beer, but good."
""
""
""
"O: A good pilsner. Certainly not the best, I'd have many others over it, but its pretty good and widely available."

"Beer is light and wet with a wet finish and a thin body. It is a lawnmower beer for sure, nothing really wrong with it, no aftertaste, nice finish. Easy drinking, I'd have it again."
""
"O: Meh"
""
"The beer is clear and pale yellow hued with a half inch of white head. The aroma offers pils malt, floral hops, grain. A present sweetness throughout. Noble hops and grain with a lingering sweet malt presence. A touch of lemon. Light in body with adequate carbonation. Overall, decent and drinkable. An inexpensive beer suitable for session drinking."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation levels. This all works together perfectly to make a nice beer. Overall, I've had much better, but it was nice to throw a few back and relax with the coworkers."

"O: this is good for the style and good for me"
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the lightness and drinkability. In the end, however, the flavor and aromas seemed overly basic, without introducing anything stark from the outset. The beer was ultimately refreshing, but nothing to write home about."
""
"O: Not a huge, huge fan of this, but it'll work in a pinch, or if I want something to wash down German cuisine with. I probably wouldn't buy it, simply because there's way too much else to try."

"The Warsteiner Vernum pours a bright clear yellow with foamy white head. Some very mild lacing as it drops to a slight head. Continuous bubbles. Smells typical of most Euro pilseners...Saaz hop as a base. The taste is decent and refreshing. The Saaz bitter taste is left on the pallet. Mouthfeel is nice, light bodied, nice carbonation and sharp. Overall a very refreshing beer that I would try again. Serve nice and cold!"

"Very grassy hoppy notes, similar to Peroni with a little bit of a malty smell. Taste is at first very crisp and clean, a bit tart, not much going on flavour-wise. A mild skunky smell comes through as it begins to warm. Overall an absolutely average pilsener with a hint of funk."

"The Crack & Glug did not take long, coming out of an 11.2 fl oz/330 ml CAN, but it resulted in a finger-and-a-half of bone-white head with mild retention. The color was a slightly pale sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a grassy hoppiness overlaying the inherent lager sweetness and my mouth began to water. The initial swig presented a very honey-like sweetness initially before the grassy hops kicked in. The mouthfeel was on the low end of medium, not quite thin, but not much over the line, either. Finish was mmmellow and it was a very pleasant reminder of why I like Pilseners, whether they be German or Czech in style. I would definitely have some of this in my cooler when headed to the beach, the backyard, or even for Hula in the Coola Day (01 February, annually). Worth an attempt at seeking out. Man, this was like tea in terms of its mellowing qualities - I was suddenly becoming very sleepy."

"I used to think German Pilseners were uncomfortably bitter, but this one tastes pleaseant enough. Maybe after the assault my tongue took from imperial IPAs, this seems a lot more toned down. Either way, it's a one trick pony in taste and smell, but it looks beautiful. The best way to drink this is in Germany on a cobblestone street side table in the proper glass. Spend an afternoon watching the world go by."

"It's not a fancy, innovative beer nor is it a big brooding complex beer. It's simple, straightforward, but well-executed. Not the best pilsner out there, but it does it's job. I've been drinking a lot of sweet and fancy beers and winter seasonals lately. This is a nice, crisp and refreshing change of pace at the moment."

" awesome summer afternoon!"
"Overall, a decent brew. Very drinkable, sessionable due to low ABV."
"Overall a nice drinkable beer that certainly won't overwhelm the palette."
"Notes: Easy to drink pilsener. Nothing outstanding but overall it is solid. A good level of hops and it finishes really nice. Good basic lager."
"RJT"
"O- Not really too much to say. It's okay, not great, but not bad either."
"The appearance was very tantalizing, my glass almost turned into a tankard. Golden bubbly translucent beer. The smell a wee bit hoppy,grassy odor,but in the end a malty,sweetness overcomes the odor,this is true with the taste for me as well. I kept thinkin honey the whole time I took a sip. I thought this was particularly good with Mexican Food. I will definitely have more in the future God willing."
"it's very drinkable and pretty good for a German beer that makes it all the way to the US."
"D: Overall a pretty drinkable pilsener with a nice amount of flavor and feel."
"It's a pretty good german pilsener. Not a favorite, but I wouldn't mind having plenty more."
"Overall not bad, nice malts, nice lager flavors, only a touch of noble hops, light lager fruits, and it would be nicer if it didn't have hints of cheap or not well taken care of lager flavors unfortunately."
"Overall a very refreshing beer."
"Final Grade: 3.64, a B grade."
"O: Not the best I've had, but still a pretty good Pilsener. A nice option in the summer, when your thirsty or with most foods - why not spicy and meaty German sausages?"

"Had on tap at the platt in franlin square at the umternational talkbass annual get together. Arrived straw yellow with a thin foamy head. Super transparent. Very malty and pilsner fresh and brisk. Nice pulsner taste, a bit macro in flavor, but easy drinking and light bodied. Overall decent pilsner but far from the top of the pack."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Pours a bright yellow, quite clear with about one finger of fluffy foam in my Tusker Pilsner glass. Some very mild lacing as it drops to a slight head. Continuous bubbles. Smells very good for this type of macro pilsener. Slightly floral. Tastes very refreshing. Nice on a humid African evening. Slightly bitter taste cuts through the mouthful of dust. Mouthfeel is nice, light bodied, nice carbonation and sharp. Overall a very refreshing beer that I would try again. Serve nice and cold!"
"Overall: Nice balanced pilsner, like the taste layers"
"It won't blow your mind, but it's better than almost all APAs and American Wheats."
"Simple to drink, not anything exciting, but its a good beer"
"Poured into glass it has the look of a Budweiser. It has smell off malts and some citrus hop notes. Left a nice lace on glass all the way throughout the beer. I was expecting it to be more skunky but it was a very balanced beer that I would recommend trying!"
"Overall it's ok. It's just too light. Needs more flavor."
"LOVE PILSNER AND THIS IS OK"
"O: This is a pretty good larger, It reminds me of Baltika 3 (export). I will definitely but this again, the only lagers I can think of that are better than this are Beck’s, Hacker-pschorr munchener gold, and possibly Baltika 3."
"Overall: Very smooth and easy to drink beer. Will definitely return for more in the future."
"Overall, this reminded me of an American macro lager. Not to much here, but it was fine. Very easy drinking."
"T: It doesn't have that crispness to it that I love in good Pilsners. Lemon and something slightly herbal upfront with a sweet and malty backbone and a finish of slightly faded grassy hops. It's not bad, but it doesn't do much for me."
"Very good for a German Pilsner. Highly drinkable."
"Unimpressive - this is as bland as industrial macro lager. It lacks the malty body and hoppy bite that I would anticipate from a good pilsener. It's also very expensive for what you get - the same flavour can be had from other lagers for a fraction of the price. I don't recommend this; spend your hard earned cash on something else."
"O: I had two Warsteiner glasses sitting around and saw this beer on the shelves at the MLCC so I figured it was time to review it. This beer wasn’t anything special but I enjoyed it. It’s very easy drinking and would be a great session beer."
"The mouthfeel is fine. It has plenty of carbonation to carry home those biscuity flavors. A light body too, which sort of works. Overall, I am not impressed with this beer. There are plenty of better pilsner options out there. Considering the price, I would rather drink American industrial lager. Seriously."
"O: Light, refreshing, and easygoing. A bit dull, perhaps, but there's really nothing distinctly objectionable about it. I imagine this would be great for a hot summer day."
"Reminded me of Heineken without the skunk. Pours a bubbly, crisp golden hue with a slight head, but leaving very little to no lacing on the glass. Smell is hoppy. Very carbonated, but not overly so, making this a very crisp, refreshing beer. Taste is slightly sweet with just enough of a kick to it that makes it above, say, the average American pilsener. I'd recommend this for those who like Heineken, but can appreciate how sometimes it comes off as a little stale."
"O - Definitely better than a corn based beer in the States, but nothing that really jumps out about it."
"O - I would have preferred a little more heft, but this is still a very true-to-style German pils. A nice lawnmower beer, or great for introducing buddies to the style."
"Overall - This is a pretty decent pilsner. It has a nice spicy/zest flavour to it that sets it apart from its competitors. With some many choices in the euro-beer category you could do far worse. I'll buy this one again sometime this summer."
"Carbonation could be higher."
"Good lawnmower"
"This is another one of those German pilsners. Grassy, light, and fresh. Not a lot of hops in this beer. Has the traditional flavors that most of these beers have. Had it for the first time at Dunerbaks German Restaurant. I felt that it'd be a fitting to have this with some brats. The beer wasn't my favorite mainly because I just don't care for this style too much. But I will agree that it went well with the food I was having."
"O: Could easily be that this wasn't terribly fresh, but I wasn't a big fan. The spiciness of it was kind of harsh and became overwhelming at times."
"Lacks the delicate complexity of the best examples of the style, but this is still a decent session lager when fresh...I'll probably pick up a 5L when the weather starts getting hot."
"Drinkability - Too stale to enjoy."
"."
"Some reviewers seemed to hate this brew - but I can't see how a true beer aficionado could rate this beer low simply due to purity of style and the quality expressed as a result of the ultra precise brewing process."
"This beer was disappointing. It poured an extremely pale yellow with 1/8 inch head that quickly faded. The aroma had hints of resin and lemon. It's flavor began with some bitterness and led to lemon and hoppy notes, followed by a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very thin, almost watery. Warsteiner Premium Verum, while a German pilsner, was more along the lines of an American adjunct lager. Not recommended."
"Clear and golden, bubbly. Thin white head that dissipates quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Classic pilsener aroma; lightly grainy and very nice hop aromas. Floral and a bit fruity. Mild, malty flavor, bready. More floral hops again with the slightest of fruit flavor, perhaps from esters but it blends in nicely with the hops. Crisp, smooth mouthfeel; very light bodied. An excellent example of the style in my eyes; completely stripped down, the essence of pure beer flavor!"
"One finger head of course bubbles, with good lace. Color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of wheat, corn, barley and some pine. Taste is a bold body of hops, wheat, sweet corn, and malt. Feels pretty good running around my mouth and over my tongue, just a little prickle. Not a bad pils, not bad at all, reminds me of my time spent in Germany. Very worth sharing."
"Serving type: can"
"M/D) Very light body, lots of carbonation. Leaves the mouth feeling slightly dry. Highly drinkable. A great beer for a warm spring day. Sessionable and pairs well with a wide range of food."
"Drinkability: I wasn't too excited by this beer. It's wet, carbonated, and has a little bitterness, but not something I want to keep drinking."
"A beer that I don't buy much but can always enjoy."
"It has a light-bodied feel to it, and is highly drinkable at 4.8% abv. I think this is a good, simple German beer, much better than others like Beck's. I'd definitely buy it again."
"D - Very drinkable. Went through a six pack in two days. Saved my last bottle to rate."
"Not a very good beer in my opinion. Pours a golden color with a white head and a little lacing. Smells of malts! And more malts! Tastes of malts! And more malts! And not much else. Mouthfeel is thin and weak. Drinkability is poor. I do not like the beer. It is a classic but it is not as great as people make it out to be."
"Overall: Smelt like Stella, but didn't live up to the taste."
"M: Refreshing, really nice body, not like water but still slim, nice feeling on the mouth in general a little dry at the end with good lasting."
"D: not the greatest, might have been better with some lemon or lime or some form of citrus to add a flavor, very blah"
"D: You would have to be a big wheat beer fan to like this, it would be offensive to others. Probably would go better with food."
"330 ml bottle, poured into pils flute. This is one of the palest beers i've drunk. Clear, big foamy head that stays for a while. Hoppy pilsner smell. Bitter sweet with a hoppy after taste. Not overly smooth but you can drink a few. Lots of gas. Overall a typical pils with no suprises."
"Overall just okay but not one that I would get again except for boiling brats."
"Verdict: Nothing too exciting about this beer. It tastes like a run-of-the-mill beer for people looking for something cheap to drink while touring Europe. I wasn't a big fan of this beer and will more than likely not try it again. D+ (2.5)"
"D: Great beer. Unique, adequate for digestif substitute. Light, enjoyable, satisfying."
"My roommate claims this is the best beer he's ever had. He first experienced while living in Berlin. It's good, but I wouldn't go seek it again."
"Very much a European beer. Poured a golden color and a bright white head. Has a very mild nose with a slight hint of citrus. The taste of the beer is average but the finish is quite nice with a fruity flavor. Good drinkability in my opinion, just not a stand out in the taste department."
"Good enough for the style, nice option for a bbq afternoon"
"M: Not as thin as expected, kinda clings to the mouth - in a good way."
"Overall, this beer is ok. I'm not a fan of wheat beers, but this one doesn't really bother me. This isn't a beer that I go out and buy, but my father always seem to have it."
"D: This is a German Pilsener ??? Not like any I've had... Not one for me."
" Pours a very light yellow, almost looks like a bud light or bud until you taste it. Has a bit of a bitter taste and finish but its not overpowering. Lots of grain flavor. Good stuff."
"D- This tasted like I was drinking a Boones Farm. I didn't tell Josh I didn't finish mine. I will review this again once I get another bottle but for now this is where it stands."
"cheers!"
"D - Awful, really not impressed with it overall. It could have been very possible that it was tainted."
"But I love the black and gold label and even the brand name is cool. It's all look, no substance."
"This is a pretty average german pils, crystal clear yellow amber, good foam stand and sharp hops. I have this occasionally as it is often served at work functions. The hop and malt contributions are noticeable, but nothing outstanding. It definitely beats the domestic offerings by a mile, but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way for this, even if I had a hankering for a pilsner. In Easter PA, we just have far better alternatives."
"This is a very refreshing light beer, a good pilsener on a hot day."
"I think I liked the draft even better, which I drank a lot of during the Las Vegas Hilton's Octoberfest special ($3.25 for 16 ounces). Very refreshing, great malt and hops character, definitely a great alternative to the lighter heinekens and buds or the ubiquitous bottled fat tire and Sam Adams. Worth getting any time."
"Drinkability - This is an easily drinkable brew. Would be nice for Spring and early Summer in my opinion. I just need more exposure to German beers to truly appreciate them. Other than that, I enjoyed it."
"Pours a mild straw color with plenty of visible carbonation and a nice-forming white head without too much retention. The nose brings some Noble hops as well as a bit of grain. The taste is slightly earthy and floral, with a good deal of grass and grain. Feel is slightly bitter and somewhat dry, with fairly large amounts of carbonation. Drinks okay and is certainly preferable to Heineken and the like, although I think I prefer Pilsner Urquell."
"Pours a straw yellow colour with thin white head. Small amount of lacing, but head retention was pretty poor. Smells of some mild grassy hops with lots of grain malt. Flavour is just a hint of bitterness, with some mild sweetness. Really not that much flavour, though nothing off about it either. Carbonation was a bit too high for the style. Ok beer to get if there is nothing better around, but won't seek this out again."
"D - the best pils that I've had thus far. could drink it all day"
"Overall, it's an average beer that would best suit a hot day, when you're just looking for something to wet your whistle."
"This is one of my favorites. A great session beer that I come back to quite often."
"d- okay, i have had better pils, but this is refreshing and goes down very easily. although i think this is a one and done beer."
"This, in my opinion, is a good go-to beer for sessions. It's tasty, it's clean, and goes down smooth. I enjoy it."
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Extremely pale and clear gold with a small white head that recedes quickly. Doesn't smell like much, faint pils malt and lager yeast, a hint of grassy hops. Tastes clean and light, mildly malty, suggests some hoppiness. Finish might taste bitter if you've never had beer before. This is like the Bud of Germany, completely bland and boring but not outright terrible, I guess."
"Drinkability: Goes down well, I wouldn't mind polishing off a few of these every now and then."
"Ahh, the first after a long day. Originally poured myself a homebrewed weizenbock from my backpack that'd been traveling with me all day after my 11.5 hour work day. Was not cutting it. Recapped the bomber and set the beer aside, maybe with the eggs in the morning before we start again in earnest. Couldn't believe this was in my fridge. I didn't buy it. But there it was. Maybe a homebrew? We shall let the pour decide. Ahhh, gloriously pilsnery with crystal clarity. Not my beer. Someone else must've made this. Someone, perhaps, who does this for a living? Toasty malt aromas dominate with a plague of earthy, slightly musty hops. She's a bit sticky going down and the flavor is perfect.. never have I been more pleased with a pilsner. A bit grainy but altogether very delicious and well-balanced."
"drinkability; this is a very drinkable beer and I always like to fall back on it on the long Lufthansa flights. Drink to your fill, better than Becks for sure."
"Drinkability: Quite good for a mass produced German Pilsner, but the smaller German brewers and US craft brewers make better."
"Overall, I was wanting something easy to drink that would be better than American macro swill, but not really test my palate and this beer did actually fulfill those needs. However, I was expecting a little more. It says on the bottle its made from hop extract, maybe that was one of the problems."
"Taste, super dry, lots of carbonation, very light. Seems like a summer beer with just a smidge of Nobles. Don't look for this when you want a big beer."
"Drinkability is okay, but it was distinctly better cold. As it warmed, the wheels came off a bit and what there was of crisp dryness was mostly lost."
"Here's a beer I would gladly purchase again. The price was even quite decent - $2.49 for the 22.3 ounce bottle. Next time I will pour it into proper glassware."
"I first has this beer at an authentic German restaurant. Served in a mug with a one finger head. Appearance was a very light straw color yellow. Nothing impressive with its appearance. The smell was a grassy smell. Typical German lager smell. Taste was quite nice. Grassy/earth taste. This beer has a nice after taste that kept me craving for more. I could drink a good bit of this beer. After trying this beer on tap, I bought a 6 pack. Same quality and taste. I was impressed with Warsteiner Verum. Will try the dunkel soon."
"Taste is very crisp an surprisingly creamy and smooth. It's not bad but it doesn't have mch flavor at all. Better than a by any day but not great."
"D: Good drinkability. A simple and refreshing beer, that's all"
"poured a medium yellow color with a white head that dissipated quickly..the smell was malt and grain with hops ..taste was simple pils it was sweet malt with floral noble pils with a bready finish ,,it had a light/medium mouth feel was easy to drink on the crisp refreshing side ..neither bad nor good..not my first choice fr a euro pils"
"Overall a perfect lager for a hot day."
"A German Macro some say...it sure as hell beats an American Macro any day."
"D- Thoroughly drinkable and a good dinner beer. Nothing exactly unique, but it is a good standard for the style."
"I have tried just about every beer at Publix and this is the best. I was looking for beer the wife could pick up during a routine shopping trip that satisfied and this does the trick. Considering the price and the availability this is a good beer on a hot day. Only drawback for me is the lack of carbonation; otherwise, very drinkable."
"This is a very good example of a German Pilsner. Not the best but, a good starter beer for those who are just starting to explore into the world of craft and import brews"
"Beer poured with a slight head which quickly disappeared leaving little lace along the sides. The beer was yellow colored straw with little carbonation. Not only did the beer look watery I felt that sensation when I drank it. Very light on the palate but also crisp and refreshing. The aroma matched the taste well and to me I got a lemony, slightly buttery taste. I seem like I am bashing the beer but I did like it. Very refreshing when it is over 100 degrees in Texas."
"Overall just kind of boring. But sometimes that's okay."
"Taste is light and crisp with good carbonation, unfortunately that's all that I can say works for this beer, it tastes of straw that which doesn't sit well in the aftertaste at all."
"The taste is unique. Wet upfront, active in the middle, with a slightly acidic, dry finish. It washes away so cleanly, leaving behind only a trace of its best characteristics: fresh hops, quality malt tones. A well-shaped body. Not too thin, not at all heavy. Crisp. So well balanced. Extremely drinkable, while remaining exceptionally satisfying."
"Drinkability is inherent."
"A small white head fades quickly over a translucent light straw golden. Aroma is pils all the way: grassy for the most part, but a bit of spice is there. Flavors are similar with fresh grains, grass, and that mild space. Pretty mellow on the flavors and the mouthfeel is thin. But the beer is crispy and refreshing, without a doubt."
"D- I'd had this before in the States...who hasn't...and obviously it was better on tap across the pond. Really tasty. A wonderful afternoon beer before continuing on with my tour of the city."
"D - Very good pilsener, I'd get it again for sure"
"I view this beer as a great starter to German Pilsners, and hope to try more of the style."
"Poured a clear light straw yellow with a nice two fingered head with fair amount of sticky lacing. Aromas of grains and a light grassy hops. Crisp sweet grain and light grassy hops on the pallete with desent enough carbonation for this medium light bodied Pilsener. Exceptional brew, two thumbs up."
"D: very drinkable beer that I enjoyed on a hot day poolside with a budy of mine alongside a cuban cigar."
"Overall, I thought it was a very enjoyable representation of the style. For the price I paid, I would have expected it to be maybe a little better, but your mileage may vary in that respect. Like fine wines, price never determines the quality."
"Poured into a mug of course...Yellow. Aired it out to build a 3 finger head. Head retention was pretty good, lots of lacing. Big bubbles. Light and fluffy head, not thick and creamy. Smelled grassy, very faint, not much in the nose. Zesty lemony hops are prominent. Sweet grains in the middle with a nice crisp finish. Bitterness of hops sit on the palate long after the gulp. This aftertaste is delightful. Fizzy and refreshing in the mouth. This is one very drinkable beer. Better on tap, but thoroughly enjoyed the two I poured in my big mug. Highly recommend to quench a big thirst or to accompany a burger or fish taco."
"The taste starts with a grainy flavor (like the smell). Some mild bittering hop does appear in the swallow and aftertaste, although the latter is short-lived. Thin bodied with a high level of carbonation--comes across spritzy. Barely better than a macro, but it is easy to drink."
"Unfortunately the taste is no better than the smell; skunky and unimpressive. Slightly bitter, and grainy with an odd aftertaste. Seems kinda thin and is overly carbonated. This beer really does nothing to distinguish itself from many of the other Euro lagers that I generally try to avoid. I found myself struggling just to finish the bottle"
"I poured it into a pint glass and it was a pale yellow with a think head that faded away very quickly. A nice aroma of grainy and biscuit malts. It has a very nice taste with no bad after taste. It has a very nice mouth feel. I would drink it again, and recomend it too."
"No idea where to buy it in the U.S. this came in a box of assorted beers throughout the world but if you could find it I would certainly recommend trying it."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and easy to drink."
"D: I could see this as being a good gateway beer for many people. Mild, making drinkability high, yet the taste is one that sticks out among other plain lagers."
"Nothing much to say here really. A fairly standard pils, though a nice refreshing one."
"Poured golden amber color with a light tan to white head. smells very clean, like many other german beers. a semi-bland taste, but it is very refreshing on a hot day. there is a delightful sweetness to the beer, pairs well with today. decent German pilsner and would drink it again."
"D - It's not bad, but there are better German pilseners to be consumed."
"Carb is more than a little light and body is on the lighter side too. Needs a bit more oomph or some more carb pushing it around my palate. Little disappointing but the overall drinkability is quite high."
"Not bad, kind of like a well made version of the big BMC style beers."
"A clear pale yellow color body with a thick white head. Aroma is grainy and malty with some skunkyness. Taste shows the same qualities as the aroma plus a some notes of lemon, grassiness and pilsner saaz-type hops. Pretty sweet, moderately bitter hop finish. Medium body with fizzy carbonation. Good head retention. Good balance, crisp. very drinkable and a very good brew."
"A very pale and absolutely clear yellow gold with very little sign of life. The head is very modest, big bubbled white with decent lace. The aroma is a doughy bread with mild yeast and bright wheat, alright. The flavor comes on with very unobtrusive sunshiny wheat and very light lemon hop with a touch of spongecake sweetness. It's not particularly strong, but is definitely more than passable for a pilsner refreshment. The carbonation is very fine but adequate and the body is medium-light. It has a smooth, glassy feel, substantial enough to satisfy and deliver a highly drinkable and refreshing beer. I find this just tasty enough to enjoy without complaint and safe enough to really put away in mass quantities. In general I feel this way about pilsners anyway, but this is a pretty masterful concoction for the masses in my mind. I won't turn it down and it goes down easy."
"Warsteiner may sell exceptionally well both here and in its native Germany, but popularity is not a test of quality. Having traveled to Germany and sampled some pretty impressive exports here at home, I don't feel that Warsteiner (in can, bottle or on draught) quite lives up to the proud and esteemed reputation of the German brewing tradition."
"Above average taste, and highly drinkable, this is a clean, crisp German beer meant for mass consumption; while it is basic in regards to the flavor, it is still quite enjoyable and consistently good. I've been drinking this for years and will continue to do so when I come across it."
"Was pleasantly surprised with this beer - had seen it around but never sampled due to the price. Am used to having German biers that surprise but this is a little bit special. Not at all what I expected."
"I didn't like this beer, the first couple of times I tried it. I think I'd become accustomed to bigger, bolder flavors and hadn't appreciated that this is really not to be expected in a Pilsner. Glad I waited to review it. Now, I can report that it's a smooth, creamy, very drinkable Pilsner. I prefer my Pilsners to be a little hoppier but I've only found this in West Coast pilsners and wouldn't expect it in a German Pilsner. A little hint of honey makes this especially nice. A bit more carbonated that I'd prefer but that's just a personal preference. Excellent beer for spicy foods because it's not going to overwhelm the dish/flavors."
"D: This is a decent pilsner, but nothing special. There are many other german beers I would prefer to this one."
"Allthough it's too watery and modestly flavoured, this is a lager that is really enjoyable, especially now that spring is setting in."
"Overall, drinkable and enjoyable Pils."
"a basic german pills it's just what it should be clean fresh and easy to drink. pours a light golden color frothy two finger head that faded quickly with a light wispy lace. smells of fresh grass and just cut hay. clean smooth malt taste with nice hop balance finishs on the dry side with a slightly bitter after taste. medium body and strong carbonation. good session beer."
"Better than a Macro, but would not buy again."
"Wasteiner is normally found in more upscale pubs and is priced to match."
"D: A fair German pilsner, but nothing to get excited about. It's definitely better than BMC, but not by as much as it should be."
"Decent example straight from the Fatherland. Check it out if the style is one of your favorites."
"pours out a very pale straw colour with an impressive pure white rocky head. respectable lace for looks. this has quite the bright pale malty nose with a huge flowery bouquet no doubt due to the noble hops used. love the smell. the taste shows off the biscuity, crackery pale maltiness, a hint of sulphur with only a smattering of lemon grass and herbal hoppiness. unique flavour for a euro lager. finishes pretty dry with light spicy hop bitterness. typical lager/pils body with a rather supple and soft mouthfeel. nice drinkability. would be a nice session beer for relaxing or pairing with some barbeque on a lazy weekend summer day."
"Overall, Warsteiner Premium Verum is a good alternative to the mass produced light beers. It's crisp & refreshing while having a nicer taste & aroma than the light beers. Although it's not the best example of a German Pilsener, it's still easily drinkable and goes down smooth."
"Very crisp and refershing, great wehn thirsty. Otherwise flavor is quite average, nothing really to distinguish this from many mass-produced lagers, Brooklyn or Victory do the pilsener style better IMO."
"Drinkability: Not to bad. This beer was given to me. I would never buy it or order it if I was out."
"Definitely not the best for the style, or in general, but underrated nonetheless"
"This beer has a nice blond beige color, 2 finger head. Had this one in a can. The beer is not great. What can i say it is average, personnally, i would not buy it again. This is my first German beer, so it is hard to compare with other German beers. Would not recommend this beer to a friend."
"D - oh ya."
"D= probably just about anyone who drinks beer could session on this if nothing else was available. A nice standard beer to have on-hand. The price however is much higher than when I used to say, ""... especially for the price."" Nothing exciting but a better alternative to any US Macro and still cheaper than most Craft/Micro's."
"D: Quite a drinkable beer, not my favorite pilsener, but never a bad choice. I'd never turn one down."
"Too bad they dont serve anything light with some flavor to it, like this, at sports events."
"Has some of the qualities you look for in a pilsener, but that slight metallic flavor really detracts from the beer as a whole. I'd imagine this is good for washing down spicy foods."
"12 oz bottle: poured tall sudsy white head with thin ring of lace. Very clear and bright golden yellow color. Light biscuity malt with a hint of grassiness. Clean and crisp taste with a moderate body and medium carbonation. Grassy malt flavor middle to end with a touch of sweetness up front but very dry in the back. Sharp hop bitterness then fades to a herbal note in the finish."
"D'ability - Flavorful but not overpowering, and each sip invites another one for me. sub-5% ABV also aids the drinkability. Only the high price would scare me away."
"Notes: One of the better German pilseners that is widely available. It's not that exciting; it's just a decent, low ABV German lager. Sometimes that's all a beer advocate needs!"
"Outstanding!! Totally underrated. Will buy again."
"D- Easy enough, but I'd not pay for this one. Thanks to whoever left some in my fridge. Drinkable, that's about it."
"I was expecting better from this one... but it's not blowing me away at all. A little on the disappointing side."
"Of note: I have had this same beer in Frankfurt, Germany, and it was much more crisp and malty. The export version seems to be ""dumbed-down"" for the American consumer."
"Served from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a pale golden with only a moderate head that quickly dissipates. Subdued aroma has notes of graininess and some toastiness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but this beer does leave a decent aftertaste. Overall, a drinkable beer, but probably not the cream of the crop for the style."
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle dated 10 Jun 09-17:45. Sampled on November 25, 2009. I have always kind of liked this one but never think to buy it. The pour is golden-yellow with about a half an inch of fizzy white head and slow moving carbonation. There is a nice note of malts in the aroma, which are not overpowering but are easy to distinguish. There is also a lightly hopped sensation to it. Not skunked up like some German pilseners, probably thanks to the brown bottle. The maltiness is also found in the flavor along with a kind of bitter-tartiness in the mix which I expect is derived from the hops. On the whole this is a decent, largely available German brew."
"I liked it, but then again the price was right. I don't know if I'd intentionally go out to buy it at it's normal (probably a bit more than a buck) price, but a win is a win."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: High carbonation. Taste good, I like the bitterness. Solid feelings."
"This beer was served right on temperature in the small long glass. The head wasn't very impressive and the cabonation either. It's a typical German 'succes' beer which is sold in many Dutch bars and pubs. I was not impressed by it, generally i am impressed by German beers for their taste and performance overall. This one missed the train where all the good beers were on. We call this in Holland a flat beer."
"Very good drinkability. Most definitely a session beer if you don't have the money to drop on a good wheat and can't down Natty/Bud/Coors. This beer goes down smooth and stays down. If you want to impress your friends, drink Warsteiner: I had little trouble drinking six in under five minutes. A good beer to drink while watching a game or eating pizza. It has become a staple in my fridge (at least until I get my hand on some Weihenstephaner)."
"I was flying to Germany on Lufthansa a month ago, and the man in front of me was German, and asked for a beer, and when he received this, he started griping to the flight attendant about American beer and how thankful he was to have a good German beer again. I rolled my eyes, hard."
"Nice and smooth, real good beer. Would definitely recommend."
"D: This is a beer that goes down without any hazzle. But it's not"
"Appearance of Warsteiner is a nice highly carbonated gold that leave a quickly disipating lace on your glass. I found it to have a vary bland, almost champagney scent. Taste is where i lose respect for this one. The taste was very bland and too carbonated. I was expecting much more from a German pilsener. Mouthfeel was very crisp and fresh. As for drinkability, Warsteiner goes down like water. A great one for a hot day! All in all i wasnt too impressed with Warsteiner, but im probably just biased cause Ive never been a fan of pilseners."
"Pours golden yellow with a stable, frothy head into a pils glass. Steady jet from the base of the glass is visible. Smells of cookies and bread - malty with end notes of wet grass. Tastes sweet in the beginning and finishes crisp and dry. Good carbonation levels add to an overall happy mouthfeel. Would be a great session beer seriously."
"D: Definitely would be one of my favorite session beers if it was a bit cheaper. Smooth, refreshing, and with a good flavor. The best thing about this beer is how drinkable it is."
"So this is what big beer means in Germany, as far as their venerable styles are concerned - close, but no cigar. The framework is there, but the plastic nature of it all kind of drags me down. Everything is just too rounded, too pithy, to remind me more than tangentially of a real German Pils."
"Cheers!"
"Wanted something light to start things off tonight. This met my goal. A decent beer."
"This is one of my go to beers but there certainly are better Pilsners available."
"Drinkability? Despite my being not overly enthused about this beer, it *is* pretty drinkable with a smooth overall taste and a decent bitterish finish."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit sweet. Taste is crisp, mild with a hint of bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent brew."
"Cheers!!"
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing beverage that you you can drink anytime."
"I poured this side-by-side with a Trumer Pils, both from bottles. The Warsteiner has a strong aroma. The Trumer almost none. Very sublte. The taste reflected this. The Warsteiner had a sharpness to it I liked. The Trumer seemed flat and watery in comparison. I definitely prefer to Warsteiner. Just one man's opinion."
"A very drinkable beer for those who want more than one! I love it"
"Drinkability - I would definitely buy again. Highly drinkable."
"D - I know this is no flavor bomb, but I do not think this beer intends to be, after a little more exploration into the world of true Pilseners, I might update my review, but as of now this is what I think"
"Overall, a very drinkable pilsner... not exactly overflowing with flavor, but one of those beers that is just right for quaffing a few out on a hot deck (which is exactly how I experienced it)."
"Taste is clean, crisp, with a quick hop finish. A well made pils. Pleasant in the mouth, and easy to drink. Sticks to the formula and gets it just right."
"Taste has a grassy malt flavor with a dry tangy and slightly bitter finish. NICE finish."
"Had a can of this yesterday after finishing building a fence. Pale yellow color with some fizz. Smell is slightly sweet and earthy. Taste is sweeter than I thought it would be. I suppose that would be the malts. Earthy as well... The German malts are pretty prevalent in this beer. Couldn't pick out much else though. Overall, this is a decent beer for a hot day. Very drinkable as well."
"D: As my comments have indicated, this is pretty much a typical pils. It's nothing earth-shattering, just a solid lager. But sometimes, that's enough."
"D - Nice and refreshing with a clean, crisp finish that makes it one easy drinking beer."
"Final Verdict- Very pleasant, albeit not groundbreaking. Considering the price range (here in italy its roughly the same price as heineken and birra moretti, which are in my opinion greatly inferior) it is fantastic value, I would definitely recommend it for a barbeque or just to get an idea of what a good, solid german pilsener should be like. Cheers!"
"D - Overall quite good"
"drinkability: A great choice with limited selection. Not the best pilsner but definitly solid..."
"Drinkability: The carbonation seems a bit too low for a summer session brew. Also the one i had, had disappointing bitterness; A little higher bitterness could help cut through the ""heavy"" taste. Lacks ""crispness"". Great price/quality ratio though."
"Tasted mild with hints of hops and malt. Nice crisp refreshing flavor that was enjoyable to drink. Don't know if I would buy it again."
"The looks are a pale golden with a nice head. A little too pale though. The smell is classically German. Absolutely a delight to smell the distinct smell that is German beer and this one is no exception. The taste is also classically German with the hole Purity Law bit. Not too week either. This is no watered down beer by any imagination. Goes down smooth with a very delayed, but very slight too aftertaste. You would have to be looking for it and even then, would have to be looking long. Verdict: must try."
"crisp, clean refreshing pils. Very enjoyable. Classic example of a German Pils. I would buy this again."
"Drinkability: This was reasonably decent refreshing beer and would be a good thirst quencher, but I'd sooner have any of 3 or 4 locally brewed Pils beers so I'll probably not choose it again if I have a choice."
"This was made for several to be drank in a sitting, and it shows. That said, it's just not for me, and I won't be buying it again."
"Taste is sweet white grape with slight crisp hoppiness. Not overly complex but very drinkable. I thought this was an excellent session beer and this is a style I'm starting to steadily appreciate more and more."
"Very very average. Supposedly a German Pilsener, but feels more like a well behaved American adjunct lager. Nothing foul, but nothing fair either. Unremarkable pour with the requisite amount and subsistence of head, lacks cloying sweetness but not pleasantly bitter either. Faintest of skunk in the nose and mouth. No complexity. No aftertaste."
"The foam was almost white, a little creamy and lacey. color was a nice golden yellow and bubbly. The smell was crisp hoppy, a balance of wheat. The taste was the same characteristics as the smell. Mouthfeel - Med. to light-bodied and dry. Drinkability - goes down smooth, a good session."
"Noble hops were quite evident on the pour and couple with some balanced malts. Flavor is similar yet offers a richer than expected flavor, given the nose anyway, and a lingering light corn syrup close. That aside, and though it may seem a negative, the beer does offer a decent feel and is quite drinkable. Decent drink though nothing special and in fact a bit sweet for the style."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this beer. I like the appearance and the dry, bitter taste most. If you are a pilsener fan, like I am, this is DEFINITELY worth buying. One factor I didn't like was the price, a bit high for me. Still I could drink bottle after bottle of these. Good stuff!!!"
"Was this what red stripe copied? Sure seems like they are cut from the same cloth."
"Clear body has a small white head, but the head does manage to stick around for at least a few minutes. The taste is dominated by the earthy, herbal, and floral hops. Bitterness is lower than I was expecting. Overall, pretty decent."
"D, this is over all an average beer it`s light and clean easy to drink ."
"This beer is very average. There are many beers that seem better to me. I think it can be drank easily, particularly in warm weather but there are definitely better alternatives."
"Extremely drinkable and balanced. While nothing stands out to make this beer stand above any other German pils in regard to flavor, its drinkability and clean crispness make it a great session beer and should please most beer drinkers."
"D. I had this beer on a flight out of Germany. The Pilsner beer had plenty of German hops but no after taste. As far as Pilsner style beer I would consider this a classic."
"D: Very typical German lager. Drinkable, but nothing special."
"Overall, definitely worth trying. Go for it if you don't feel like paying as much as you would for Hofbräu but are looking for a decent German Pils to get the job done."
"Drinkability - nothing offensive, just not dramatically interesting. It ain't easy to tell some of these apart."
"Nikki"
"This is my favorite German Pilsner style tried thus far because on every level it lets you know what it is you're drinking."
"D - 2.0 - It would be tough to drink this one again, I had a 12 pack left in my fridge from a party and it stayed there a long, long time, until I finally gave them away."
"A full natural aroma with a strong hopsy aftertaste. I can taste the barley and the hops, a great sensory experience. Nice amber body, with the right amount of froth. Not too sweet nor too bitter. I would recommend to my friends. My favorite German beer to date."
"D- Overall a decent brew thats ok but not special."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Average to above average. One of my favorite session beers."
"This is a good beer for a hot day, but not much else."
"Appearance is a nearly straw yellow, golden sparkle. Head is huge at first and quickly dissipates leaving a fair amount of lacing. Smell is mostly non-existant. Taste is absolutely pure pilsener. This could quite possibly be the cleanest tasting beer I've ever had. Mouthfeel is close to water. Drinkability is rather high due to the light body and clean finish. All American domestic beer drinkers should be forced to try this."
"Premium Verum is a consistently average beer across the board. I can't say that it's overtly bad, but it's not quite good either. It's worth a try, but nothing more than that. Definitely not worth picking up an entire six pack in my opinion. Go for the single bottle if it presents itself."
"A yellow color with a white head that quickly disburses. It smells of malt and faint grain. The taste is nothing special. I didn't think it was watery, but the flavor doesn't reach out and grab you either. It's refreshing, but nothing special. You could drink a few of these."
"This is not a great pilsner, but it is better than Becks or St Pauli Girl."
"Definitely a floral type of smell. Taste is on the bitter side with a strong presence of malt and hops. Strong tasting at first but surprisingly good drinkability."
" ~ This is a good brew. One I will recommend to friends."
"When I take a drink, the first thing I notice is the crispness of the beer. The carbonation almost has a bite to it. It has a light/medium body with a maltiness that resembles bread or wheat. I can also taste the quick hint of the hops in the finish. It is a very dry beer that finishes very clean with little aftertaste."
"A mostly light bodied beer. Not overpowering in any way so it is pretty drinkable but nothing particularly stands out. Overall a very average beer that I wouldn't feel the need to buy, but I could have been offered something much worse so I won't complain."
"A classic. Pours a clear yellow with a medium white head. Smells of light, leafy and floral hops. Taste is pleasantly sweet: flower nectar-like sweetness with a grassy hop finish. Well carbonated body. Drinkable to the max as either a beer to start the evening or as a session beer to have during the game."
"Mouthfeel is decent, it's pretty smooth and crisp. Carbonation is good, pretty light-bodied. A great upside to this beer is it's drinkability - knocking back a few of these would not be a problem. The dry/bitter finish might wear you out after a couple but it's an enjoyable straight up Pilsener, despite it being somewhat ""boring."" Good session brew, however."
"I've never had the regular Warsteiner, but I should definately give it a shot. This brew is pretty clean, but definately bitter - a bit too bitter for what I was expecting. However, it's definately not bad; I wouldn't turn it down if offered to me, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it either. Definately try it to experience something that's (perceived to be, at least) ""hardcore German."""
"Drinkability is modest, if only because this beer is surprisingly mild. Nothing sticks out, nothing offends, nothing lingers. Fair, but not even really all that good, let alone excelling."
"D: A decent drinker."
"Taste is more of the same. A bit metallic with a faint finish of hoppy dryness and toastiness. A bit boring and very much what I expected this beer to taste like. Drinkable? Yes. Flavorful? Somewhat. Memorable? No. It's a slightly below average German lager for me."
"Overall - Review from notes. One of the first beers I've ever had and it is a solid pils indeed. Goes well with many dishes, especially burgers, bbq, or even pizza. If this isn't a classic pilsener standard, then I don't know what is. Will buy again."
"Overall- Light, airy, and crisp. Simple and easy Pils."
"This one was left over in my fridge at new years. pours out a nice golden yellow color, with a thin line of lace, that sticks the whole way down the glass. Smells very fresh, floral hops, and malts. Very good. Taste is great, nice and smooth, with malts up front, and a bitter dry finish, nice. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with the perfect carbonation level. Drinkability his high on this one, but i docked it .5 because when warm its just a chore to drink, but otherwise very high. I really enjoy these german pilsners, they are very tasty, but not as good as czech pilsners :P. Anyway, i highly recommend this!"
"Which leads to mouthfeel, which is thin. But the carbonation makes this one a thirst quencher. Which leads to drinkability. Finish is dry and clean. Has all of the elements which would lead me to hate this, yet there is something very drinkable about it. Real summer brew here -- light, refreshing, and clean. Not too bad at all."
"Pours a clear golden color. Lots of carbonation bubbles form a bright white head, some nice looking lacing sticks to glass. The smell is grassy / grainy. The taste has a good clean flavour of sweet grains, balanced by some floral hoppy bitterness. Crisp finish, smooth, easy to drink. No metallic or adjunct flavors. A beer always seems to taste better fresh from the tap rather than from a bottle (Proper glassware, a nice looking pour & correct coaster all add to the experience too)."
"D: This is nice. Definitely one of the better mainstream Euro imports."
"D- Easy to drink and pairs well with food"
"MF&D - extremely smooth, coupled with crisp carbonation makes and incredibly drinkable beer. one almost has to swish the beer in one's mouth to arouse the carbonation, which is why I find my self pouring two or three of these guys into my stein and chugging."
"Decent atmosphere, good hoppy flavor. Light palette, hoppy, but not overwhelming aftertaste. Good pilsner to sip. Real quality for this style."
"D- Could drink a few of these due to the clean mouthfeel and clean finish."
"had this one on draft at a favorite stomping grounds, pours a very pale light golden color with a pure white head that dissipates quickly. not much on the aroma side just kinda watery and some corn adjuncts. Tastes is good though, just a nice smooth, easy drinking lager. a decent go to lager"
"Whew...this was a tough one and inadvertantly my 200th...oh well. Pours a clear golden color with 2 finger rocky head. Poor retention and minimal lacing. Smell is not so pleasant and possible the lowest score I've given any beer for smell. It has a skunky, malty, grassy and a corny smell. Combined it kinda smells like piss, I hate to say that but its honestly the best I can do. Taste is fine. Pretty well balanced, some malt and some grassy hops, slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was somewhat light but it left a rather oily, slick feel that I didnt care for so much. Overall not terrible. I wasnt expecting much and didnt get much, so I guess it all worked out well."
"A cheap, macro German beer that can be bought in nearly every shape or form. It has a golden body, but with almost no head whatsoever and one that also fizzes. Warsteiner has an exceptionally neutral taste that doesn't leave any unpleasant after-tastes and is much cleaner than it's next largest competitor, Beck's. You can get this beer for free on most Lufthansa flights."
"m&d: well made pilsner, light ABV makes this a session beer"
"It has a huge off white head with a little bit of a yellow tint to it. Its body is a transparent brass color. It has a clean hoppy aroma with some grain tones. The taste is also very clean but there is not much to it. A little bit grassy with a plastic and grain after taste. The mouthfeel is thin but refreshing."
"All in all a reasonable pilsner for a guy that prefers a darker beer year round."
"2.8/5"
"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate CO2 and dry finish mean this stuff is quite drinkable, but not remarkably so"
"D: I like this pilsner overall. There is nothing offensive about it, but it does lack complexity. It goes down very easily and I recommend it to anyone who wants a lighter clean tasting beer."
"The taste is bread, lemon, herbs, and overall quite zesty. It has light, firm sweetness under dominant light bitterness with an herbal finish and lingering aftertaste of tingly herbs and bread. It has a nice feel, light but zesty and faint oiliness, and not watery or rough. It's very nice, clean, and flavourful, if not as flavourful or interesting as some."
"D- Very drinkable. This would be great with a casual meal or just sitting on the porch on a hot day."
"Drinkability: Easy to suck down, enjoyable. A good pilsner to enjoy year round."
"D: I hadn't had one of these in awhile and was pleasantly surprised. Not super complex, but quite drinkable."
"This is fairly thin and watery, even by American standards. The beer pours a straw pale golden color with a fairly thick white creamy head that retains and bit and does lace. The beer is crystal clear and pretty well carbonated. The aroma is very typical pilsner, some grassiness, some hop character, some weak floral malts, a touch of lemon. The taste is quite thin, crisp, there are some interesting grassy notes to the beer, some lemony hints, but this isn't a beer I'm all that excited about. There is a slight cracker like taste to the beer, it is evenly balanced between dry and malty sweet. There is a tad bit of huskiness to the beer, but it is thin. The mouthfeel and aftertaste are ... yup, thin and watery. This beer is average."
"D: Despite some good attributes, this is a kind of average beer. There simply wasn't much about it that was exciting."
"Good drinkability, which I will definitely visit again."
"Of course it goes down great and the taste is really nice. Comparing to other, typical german imports like Becks or St Pauly Girl, etc, this is much better with a smoother and more balanced taste. I say spend the extra buck or 2 for a 12 pack of this over those."
"Had a mini keg of this the other weekend and was quite impressed. A nice floral aroma and a very smooth light taste to it. The mini keg worked very well (much better than others I tried) and me and my friends were all very impressed. A good pilsener at a pretty good price and I would like to try it again."
"Prost!"
"D - A pretty easy drinker that, while aesthetically rather dull, does the job reasonably well."
"An average beer really. Better than the usual BMC offerings and easy to find, along with a cheap price make this drinkable bot only for those reasons. Not a beer worth seeking out but there are far worse when you're looking for a cheap buzz."
"3.5	D lingering bitterness but a bit one-dimensional near the end. good thirst quenching. relatively bargain priced"
"Taste is not impressive. I guess it's an okay beer, but for me there was no bitterness to balance the sweetness. With this pils, it's simply not refreshing for me because it doesn't have that hop kick. And the after taste borders on the undesirable. My beer was fresh; I checked the date. There's better beer to be had while in Germany, but maybe for an imported German Pils in America it's above average. I'm not sure, but it tasted average to me."
" D - this is nice and refreshing. Easy to drink and very enjoyable..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thin and transparent going into the mouth, becoming mildly effervescent before relaxing again for the swallow. A mediocre beer, and one to enjoy with simple food in the summer months. Average at best."
"D - easy drinking, tasty brew."
"D - Something missed, but the beer is still complete."
"Yeah this is decent but extremely common. Grassy/grainy aroma, light yellow with a sizeable white head and moderate lacing. Sort of sticky and funky on the finish. Flavor is sweet and grainy with that typical euro lager flavor. Cheap import, standard fare."
"D- Not too bad, is good in the heat."
"M&D: very refreshing on the palate with abundant fizziness to offer, medium-minus bodied, this is an easy-drinking Pilsener with an extra touch of hop bitterness to enjoy."
"This beer did not grab me hard in any way. Overall just a very bland pilsner that is poorly balanced. What I was impressed with in this beer was the appearance and palate. It looked good to drink and felt good to drink. The only thing is it was vicously bland with a light bread/grape aroma, and moderately sweet flavor. Not a beer I am all that eager to drink ever again."
"The drink is easy on the palate, light-bodied and refreshing."
"Pale gold color with 2 fingers of white head. The foam is a little fizzy and leaves just a few wisps of wet lacing. Nose is malty and grainy with some Hallertau influence. Flavor is simple but effective. Clean and grainy with some pale malt. Hops lend a grassy crispness but very little bitterness. Infinitely drinkable, smooth and refreshing."
"Got a nice head , very bubbly and dense, it was about a finger thick and quickly thinned out into thins white layer of bubbles covering a bright blonde beer with some mild carbonation; this looks like a very refreshing beer to drink on days. It has some good lacing as well. It has a floral aroma and a mild wheat scent, but that's all I smell from it. Its very light and is semi-crisp; there are some mild hops flavors... it is sweet; its got a good balance of hops and malts; there is a very slight bitter taste in the back of your tongue just before you swallow."
"This may not be the very best German pils out there, but it's a worthy example of the style. Worth seeking out and recommending to friends, if only to watch their face when they compare this to macros that use the word ""pils"" on their label."
"An easy drinking beer that compliments my smoked turkey, cheddar, and mustard sandwich. A darn good pils."
"Had this on tap at Prost!, the new beer bar in Portland. It came to me in a pint glass, and was a pale yellow color with a fairly small white head. The aroma was mostly bread, with something that came across as sweet. Taste was more bread, with a little hops. This was a good beer to drink on a hot and humid summer day."
"Recommended..."
"An acceptable German pils, although certainly not my favorite. It's a crisp, refreshing brew for summer afternoons, but I wouldn't want this around all the time."
"D: Definitely a quaffer and one not to be missed. A very good example of a german session style beer."
"I was halfway into the second bottle when my brain finally realized what was going on in the mouth. The full flavor of this beer came front and center. My taste buds wanted more. I gladly obliged. This beer's primary asset is it's flavor. By the third bottle, the skunkiness amounted to a mini-skunklet, but remained. This beer is slightly different in taste from other pilseners but still enjoyable. Very tasty. Me and my mouth buddies settled in for a pleasurable beer drinking experience. And it was."
"Pours with a thin quickly dissipating head. Pale yellow in color with low carbonation. Nose is malty with a slight hint of hops. Taste is malty and sweet with bready overtones and a very slight hoppiness. Carbonation is very low and makes the beer seem almost flat. My personal opinion is that this beer would benefit with a slight bit more carbonation and a bit more hoppiness to balance out the sweetness. My final thoughts, this beer is nothing special."
"All in all, a well-rounded and enjoyable pils, certainly good enough to drink again at a later date."
"M/D: Light and refreshing. Not a ""hardcore"" Pils ( bitter ), but a very drinkable pils."
"D = A very pleasant drinkable beer. This is what a light colored, light flavored beer should taste like. Very refreshing."
"I usually have two liters of this beer on tap at the Heidelberg in NYC when I'm there. It used to be my favorite, until I tried the Hofbrau Dunkel, I haven't had a Warsteiner since. Still very drinkable and enjoyable and I will throw one in here and there, since I love to live on the edge."
"This is a decent beer but the particles suspended in it bother me. I am used to the signs of yeast at the bottom of bottles but these look like the flakes you feed your goldfish. Despite the less then average appearance it is a smooth clean beer with nice carbonation and an interesting hop spice."
"D - Extremely drinkable pilsner; probably my favorite of the style; great session brew; low alcohol; isnt too light or boring"
"I tried this beer on November 3, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured beautiful translucent gold colour with very little head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was weak with hops and grains. The mouthfeel was thin and crisp with mild carbonation. The flavour was a combination of malt, and hops and grass."
"Good beer for a hot summer day when flavor is less of a concern than overall refreshing feel, or if you aren't concerned too much with what you're drinking, but can't lower yourself to drink an American macrolager."
"Taste is rather American macro grainy but more hops. Definitely not a top shelf pilsner. Carbonation is OK."
"Light body, decent feel. Obviously drinkable. A good pils IMO/"
"Not good. Wouldnt buy again"
"overall, great pils. love the dry minerally character."
"Taste is less malty than the smell, there are nice sulfur notes and some caramellized or Maillard products. Mouthfeel is medium to thin and contributes to the drinkability. Although this is a big brewer, it is still a good beer, but could have more personality."
"Have had this numerous times, but I decided to buy one bottle (although I don't like it) for a review. Poured into my pils glass and received a light, seethru gold body with decent head retention. A weak smell of grassy hops and maybe something like bread malt(?). Once again I didn't care for the taste, as I thought it was too bland and dry to make up for the little touch of sweetness on the backend. Goes down smooth though. Something about this beer...it doesn't help matters that I get a headache after drinking one of these, literally. I get a headache - no joking here. Now that I've done my review no need to have another one."
"I'll buy this one again for just that reason."
"D- I could enjoy a few these during a BBQ."
"I remember enjoying this one for a much lower price years ago while serving in the military. While the price for a six pack has increased, this german pilsner has maintained a quality flavor. This brewery produces only a few products on a large scale, but they are consistent. Good quaffer for the spring and summer."
"D. Fairly drinkable but not impressive."
"D-A good session. It's light, simple, and good."
"again."
"Easy to drink, but so is water. I will pass on this again, unless someone else is buying."
"Easy-drinking Euro pilsener with a Heineken-like taste, but less sour. Crystal clear light golden yellow with weak head. Sour hops with some slight sweet maltiness. Clean and refreshing taste, no alcohol burn or off-tastes. Better than Heiney or any macro American beers for the masses."
"D: Very drinkable, I have drank many of these in the same night, and can do it with little protest. This is one of my favorite beers, if not my favorite pils. Delicious beer."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with thick bleach white head that leaves behind some nice lacing as it dissapates.The smell and taste are pretty average for an above average Pils,good hop presence along with a semi sweet maltieness,like others I also detect some hints of lemon.The finish is light and crisp,good drinkability,a nice German Pils."
"D - This is a pretty good pils. Makes a great session brew."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a very lager yellow, medium head. Smell was completely unobtrusive, faintly sweet, perhaps a bit of the skunk others have mentioned, but barely there. Slight bitter at the start, but a delicious sweet aftertaste. A fine daily brew, not spectacular, but certainly good."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. A good example of a German Pils. Great for warm summer days."
"Not my favourite German lager. Tastes like it was cut with vodka. I hate how the LCBO has 5-10 German/Czech pilseners and just a handful of real Belgians..."
"Drinkability is high, good session beer, great at cookouts, barbecue, anything meat."
"Drinkablity: Tasty and well built, a great brew for a simple change of pace."
"D: Probably one of my favorites as of now... I can't wait to try the others that warsteiner has to offer. I can definitely see why they were all so excited about this. Definitely worth a pickup"
"Not bad at all!"
"A light golden in appearance with a crisp head. Smell is slightly skunked, slight malt and hops. Taste is lightly sweet, grainy with a good hop bite that is left to cloy. Mouthfeel medium that has a carbonation bite as it goes down. not great, but worth a try."
"Worth the try."
"This is a nice simple style beer that is easy to drink and tastes even better."
"drinkability is excellent. It is to me what American macros should be..quality light and easy drinking..this would make a great session brew!"
"D - If this is the only available decent brew, its all I would drink."
"A nice light beer to start of the day I'd drink it again but wouldn't go out of my way looking for it."
"Don't know much else to say except I've always liked this beer... I used to buy it a bunch when I was brewing alot of lagers.. you can drink it all day no problem."
"This is a clean, crisp, German pilsener. While it is light in body and taste, it is true to style. It's worth a try, but I feel that there are better beers of this style out there."
"M/D: Mouthfeel was really nice, not watery at all, although the carbonation almost too much. This was a very easy beer to drink, not exactly my favorite style but definitely has enough going on to stay interesting."
"mouthfeel isn't too thin, carbonation is noticeable and somewhat refreshing."
"Meh, there's corn in the aroma and nobody wants that. There's also pale malts and little bit of hops, but it definitely smells like vegetables and DMS. The appearance is a clear gold without retention and the flavor does a little better with mild Saaz flavor and bitterness that develops in the aftertaste. There's also a little light caramel or butter (diacetyl?) along a biscuit flavor. The mouthfeel, however, is right on, being dry, crisp and balanced. It's a shame about the flaws, otherwise this would be a decent beer."
"M / D: Mild carbonation, goes down fairly easily and smooth. Certainly easy to drink, more like a cola... perhaps good ice cold for a hot day, and better than some others that could come to mind, but a pretty average pilsner all around."
"11.2oz brown bottle with a best before date of 09/25/08. Pours a pale yellow with a huge head, just OK longevity and Just OK lace. Decent malt aromas mixed with honey and citrus - standard pilsner aromas I guess. Good pilsner malt flavors, richer than the color would lead you to believe. Good hop flavor and bitterness too - although the bottle states its extract, kind of lame but it works OK I guess. A decent enough beer just nothing great."
"Had this one when i went out for New Years Dinner.On Tap...i got to say was more enjoyable than in the bottle.Faint straw yellow with small white head that dissipated a little too quick for my liking.Smell was of grains and grass and very greenish smell comming thru.Fresh and crisp as it went down the pipe,grains and grass with hints of corn,goin down rather easily,a little on the watery side,little carbonation.Not bad at all...quite enjoyed it."
"Nice crystal clear golden color with a nice white head. Smell was almost offensive, and hard to describe. Just didn't care for it. Taste was very good, with a perfect balance and a nice subtle hoppy finish. Carbonation was med/high and body was medium. Nice mouthfeel and highly drinkable. If it wasn't for the off aroma, this would have been an excellent beer."
"D - Very."
"D- solid lager, was skunked but of course, that went away, sessionable and not a bad choice, try if offered of curious"
"Really overall good pilsener."
"it didnt had a good aroma or something in it telling me, go grab another one"
"Drinkability: Would not be a session beer for me, but still a solid beer."
"D- looks thin, tastes heavy, sits relatively light in the belly. definitely a session beer as it is readily available and reasonably priced. i've had it on tap before and it's even better there. keg parties would be alot better if people would spring the extra $50 to get something like this instead of you-know-what."
"Solid all-around beer. One finger of white head pours atop a light golden body, with no lacing as consumed. A modest hoppy aroma emanates, but little else confronts the nose. The taste is smooth and slightly bitter, nice and crisp. There is a slightly grainy mouthfeel that detracts a bit from the beer overall, but it's on the whole satisfying."
"Final Statement: Not a beer I would recommend in the state I had it in. May be better fresh."
"The pour is a very clear, very pale light gold capped off by a small bright white top. The head fizzles lightly and quickly, leaving no lacing or trace atop the brew (apparently appropriate for the hop extract, but not for a German pilsner, which should have long-lasting head). Bubbly carbonation is evident start to finish. The aroma and taste are both very clean. Light malt undertones to a grassy hops aroma lead the nose into a similarly light taste. Mild malt flavor hits the tip of the tongue for just a moment before bitterness takes over through the dry, refreshing finish and aftertaste. High carbonation adds both to the sense of bitter bite as well as to the lightness. Highly drinkable and refreshing, light and crisp with a good amount of bitter. Seems like a good commercial example of the style."
"D- HIGH drinkability in this brew, it is quality."
"Pretty good coming from one of the big boys in Germany, the most I'd throw at it which I have many times is the classic cheese burger and fries."
"D:	I was pleasantly surprised with this lager. Its sweetness offers an interesting change from most other euro lagers, but its not too sweet. Quite smooth and very easy to drink. I will buy this one again."
"D - very light to me....not heavy...would go well at a bbq with beef..not bad for the price..."
"Pours a golden yellow, quite clear. Big white head that sticks to the cup. Smells of a typical pils, very little aroma. Taste is pretty light, malty, with a cracker like taste, and a good amount of bittering from the hops to even things out. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but on the spot for the style. Very drinkable, an excellent session beer."
"Thierry (16/10/2007)"
"D - I think this is better than say a Macro and its priced to compete with them so I would go with this beer."
"Flavor is quite crisp and clean. Subtle hops, as well as a slightly metallic element."
"D - I could drink this all night and be okay, it definitely would be a shoe in over a macro lager. For $9.99 a 12 pack, it's a pretty good deal."
"Finish is unspectacular, hops stick to the roof of your mouth but not much taste. A decent session beer, refreshing and better than NA macro brews, a decent pilsner lacking the fragrance of a better one."
"Exp May 31, 2008. Very pale in the glass, large bubbles and a sparse wispy white head. Smells of wet grass, hay. More malt than hops, but both abundant. Taste was not bad initially but I found it went a bit downhill as it warmed with increasing sourness and a detergent-like, brutally sharp aftertaste. Mouthfeel was very hoppy but with dry astringency. At least the carbonation held up, although it slowed; again, I found the taste really slipped towards the end of the glass and it was not very pleasant at all."
"this was the best option at a rooftop cubs game, and it was doable. no surprise in the clear straw/gold appearance. grassy hops were dominant in the nose. lightly sweet bready malt going down with enough hop bitterness to balance. smooth, crisp, and relatively light overall. sessionable at this abv. i could have done worse and drank bud lite like all the dumbass cub fans."
"Overall, it was good, had real German music played live. In this setting id order this over the other Miller offerings at this fest. We came to the fest for the Dunkel, I enjoyed the Dunk over thisone."
"I did not like this beer. Got it on top at Joe Kool's in Troy, MI, to try something new. I think I ended up chugging it to get something better. Appearance was straw colored with a head that disappeared in a few seconds. Nose is nearly non-existent - very light malt character, some apples maybe. Taste was likewise. Extremely mild, graininess, some mediocre malt. Feel was thin bodied and too carbonated. I wouldn't get this one again."
"A frothy white head developed as I poured it into my pint glass. It disappeared quickly. The beer's a pale gold color. No particular aromas jump out at you. It just smells like beer should. No dominance of any one ingredient. Nice blend of malt, hops, water, and yeast. Tastes good. Not too light or heavy. Just a good pilsner. I like it."
"Yellow pour with a whiter than white head. Some hops in the aroma. Mild malt accents in the flavor along with a bit of hop bitterness, but not a lot. This beer tastes more like an imported macrobrew or typical Euro lager than it does a true Pilsener in my opinion. I have enjoyed this beer in the past, but I wonder if it is being dumbed down for the American market. Another variable that perhaps affects the flavor or lack thereof is the serving type, in this case a can. Mildly tolerable and not unpleasant, just not much to really make me want to try it again."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, it’s ok if you want something light and I would drink it if BMC were my only other tap choices, but most places where I’ve seen this beer have something better."
"Beer poured a light gold with very thin head that disappeared quickly. Light malty aroma but flavor had strong malt presence with a balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel was rich and thick and overall this is a decent beer. I would have this beer in a pinch but after a 22 ouncer I was ready to move on."
"Drinkability: A very great beer, I am a fan of Warsteiner and was not let down by this drink"
"Overall a mid level German Pils. Many better choices available."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pale yellow pour with light head. Not the best German pilsner I have tasted, but still pretty good. Im actually impressed that its not at all skunky and in an amber bottle. Mouth feel was good and beer is definitely high on the drinkability scale. Decent lacing."
"Overall: nice and unpretentious beer. Refreshing for a hot day, but too sweet for me. Nothing spectacular about it but a decent pilsener."
"This makes me want to gag, I'm throwing it away. I've had this beer before and I don't remember this being so trashy."
"D: Actually, for the price, this is one of the better import buy. 500ml bottle for $1.29 and for the above average taste, this easily beats all the ""macro"" imports. I'd buy again. Don't want to keep my glass lonely."
"Drinkability: It's a shame I can't get the experience I got the first bottle, but this is still a solid, clean pilsner."
"First found this beer while on vacation, then found it again back home. A nice golden color, no cloudiness. There were no noticeable scents, a clean smelling beer. The taste was nothing too special but, it was very crisp and refreshing after a long day. Very easy to drink down, with virtually no bitterness or aftertaste. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a clean easy drinking beer."
"Pours pale gold with a quickly receeding white fluffy head. Some modest lacing near the top. Aroma is grassy and a touch of the skunk which quickly disappears. Taste is mostly bitter. The hop component is slightly thin. The malts are there but with no real character. Overall a very ordinary Pils. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and it has a dry bitter somewhat metallic finish. Best before date is two months from now."
"D: Quite quaffable, quenches a summer thirst, and the aftertaste is of pleasant hops, but there are other German lagers I like more."
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a perfectly clear light gold with a two-finger, bubbly head. Smell is nothing noteworthy, slightly sweet and fruity. The taste also has a slight fruitiness to it, but there is also graininess about it that seems a little off. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. This beer is decently drinkable but I just don't see myself buying any more of it."
"Want to get your buddies away from the American Macro's? Then have them try this. From 12oz bottle with best before date of 12/4/07. Small, maybe 1"" head and very pale golden in color. Decent carbonation..I like the little bubbles that come to the top. Slight lacing. Faint, sweet smell detecting a little bitterness to come. Very smooth tasting. Somewhat sweet, somewhat bitter with a nice balance of carbonation and some grains. Not too complex at all. Leaves a hint of bitterness when she goes down and stays with you a while. Very drinkable, a not so complex beer that's fun to drink. Great chilled summer beer."
"A good pils. Better than some of the other ones you see on the rack. Nice summer day pilsner."
"This one is better on-tap than in a bottle. The oily hops and nutty character emerge more. Works wonders - refreshing with a good amount of residual taste - in hot, humid weather. Light and refreshing while remaining tasty."
"D: Pretty good. Low in alcohol, light in body and flavor means this one goes down pretty easily when it's good and cold."
"This could be passable if I was really thirsty and wanted a beer, but I usually love pilsners and expect better."
"Pours a very pale straw with a thinnish head that leaves a little cling to the sides of my pint glass. Hops come out most int he nose with lots of jasmine and tea. Malt smells crisp but has a bit of graininess to it. Has a bit of a ""brothiness"" in the nose which is odd. The flavor leaves a lot to be desired as the hops come up flat and poorly mix with the overall sweet malty body. Carbonation needs to be more lively in the mouthfeel. I'm sure this would be refreshing on a hot day, but the flavors don't do it for me."
"Overall: Light and refreshing, would have been better without the skunkiness, but it is a simple beer, and the hops are not in such high doses that it was ruined by the skunkiness."
"Poured a very bright golden yellow out of the bottle into a tall pilsner glass. Lots of carbonation and a big white head. Light grainey like smell with a hint of some fruit in the back. Very crisp, clean and refreshing, very nice pilsner and a fine german brew. I really liked this and it was a nice classic german pilsner. Not too complicated but perfect for the spot. A good call for sure."
"12 oz. brown bottle, brewed with barley malt and hop extract; best before 10/18/07. It pours very pale gold with light carbonation and an inch of white head that leaves moderate lacing. Mild grassy and spicy/skunky hops in the nose, backed by some grain. The flavor adds to this a dash of earthiness and a mild bitterness, on top of a light body that has an equivalent carbonation and finish. An average German pilsner, but makes for an easy session beer."
"Oh and for $20 /case this was a steal."
"Crisp, clean malt taste that slips into a brisk, dry bitter finish. Simple easy German pils that can be consumed in massive quantities. Ample body and quite a refreshing brew overall."
"Overall, this beer is not complex at all, but a straight up Pilsner style that is easy to enjoy. Nothing fancy, yet well made. Definitely worth trying if the previous description appeals to you."
"Drinkability - I could not stop drinking these at the brewery and then at the hotel bar's tap after that. But now, drinking a bottled one at the office it's just a good beer."
"decent...although I found the malt/hop flavors took some getting used to....would certainly have another if offered to me."
"Average ""run of the mill"" pilsner. Decent enough, but nothing spectacular. I can't even say I'd recommend this over other mass produced American versions."
"This one would make a great session beer. There isn't much hop flavor, but the grain is very plentiful. Recommended."
"Poured into a stange glass, it pours a pale light straw color with a good head. It's a little flowery and grassy in the smell, just as a good German Pilsner should be. A bit herbal in the taste, but it's dominated by a pleasant hop bitterness. A smooth beer that's not too hard to drink. Accompanied homemade hamburgers with corn nicely."
"poured a solid 1 "" head with great stickiness in it's appearance. Head lasted about 1 minute....but left great lacing. Smell is very earthy ....taste is sweeter and hoppier than out of the bottle....and less of the metallic astringency here....this went from being above average out of the can/bottle to being very solid on tap. I'll remember to do the tapped version as often as possible...taste is rosie with alot of that earthiness and bland sweetness....nice carbonation and good drinkability....impressed...now off to search out a mini...to see if it has the same benefits compared to the regular can and bottle. out of bottle/can...marginally recommend...on tap I can easily recommend."
"D- Very good. A good stand alone drink. Could have a few of these with family or friends."
"Overall impression: A clean, light, refreshing beer. The skunkiness detracts up front but overall it's a pretty good Pils."
"Drinkability- Just the tiniest skunky, like Steinlager. The weird thing is, this isn't in a green body, so it shouldn't be light-struck. Overall, pretty good."
"Usually not a Pilsener guy, but if I go that way, this is definitely one I consider."
"D - Alright. It is very heavy on the hay flavor. Even though it is pretty good, I would sooner try one of the other hundreds of german pilseners out there than have this again. Would go well with a typical geman meal of something stuffed in its own intestine."
"I normally stick with dark beer, but this is a very good beer. Wasn't impressed initially, but after i tasted the first beer I sure didn't mind going for more. It has a thick head with good taste and good finish. Probally not going to be one of my standbys but sure wouldn't mind drinking one again."
"After pushing puddles of slush throughout the morning hours here in wonderful Dorchester . I thought I would treat myself with a few brews and reviews . Blackburn Rovers / Bayer Leverkusen is on the dish right now . Sweet . It is not my beloved Glasgow Celtic but it will do . This is a single I bought yesterday and it is being poured in a pint glass . Very little head and the color is clear & yellowish . Very bubbly too . The smell is like the bread from Greenhills Bakery . Nothing else comes to mind . Taste on the other hand plenty comes to mind . Watery , and not pleasing to my pallete - granted it is an apprentice pallete - but blah . There is a thinsized head on the brew as I drink it but this reminds me of beer that we once pounded all day at UMass - Amherst . Yellow water fiz . It is dry and crisp but there is no mouthfeel . The Rovers match will do but this brew will not ."
"A fair session beer if you're not looking for anythig too challenging for the style, best choice availible tonight & certainally wouldn't turn one down"
"This lager poured a light yellow with a little foam that dissapated with in half a minute. The smell of hops was all that I could pick up with this lager. The taste was of a bitter nature with just the taste of bitter hop. Averall, this German Lager was just to bitter. Not much flavor either!"
"Kind of plain, but that's the intent with this style (I think!). A nice drinker with a sandwich on a Saturday afternoon."
"Eric"
"D - Will and could and have drunk this session by session, i love the clean, fresh hop taste when its on tap in Germany, not as good from the bottle in this example. i think i get disappointed by the head dissapating so fast from a bottle, nevertheless, for me, a great pils"
"I was at a party at a friend's house and I came across this bottle of this Warsteiner. Quite honestly, I thought I was fishing through the cooler of misfit beers, when I reached in a pulled out this German Pilsener. I drank it out of the bottle. I know, I know, but I didnt want to come off as a beer snob. So, no glass and the appearance rating above is based on the bottle, not the beer. This is a very tasty beer, warms up well and remains drinkable throughout. But you're not going to pound this when it warms up. An interesting beer, but I missed the clean, crisp finish I'm accustomed to in this style."
"Flavor was slght malt flavor, but still tasted like a German-style pilsner and was fairly crisp, refreshing, and drinkable."
"This is nice stuff. Fairly middle-of-the-road as a German pilsner, but never a bad idea for a grab off the supermarket beer shelf."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a straw color with a nice foamy white head that dissipated fairly quick and left no lacing, very similar to Bud. Not much on the nose, a bit of hop smell. The lager has a bit of malty sweetness to it and a light hop taste. Its has a light and almost watery mouthfeel. This is the beer that the American macro lagers should be striving for. It is very easy to drink but doesn't use any adjuncts to fudge up the flavor. This is the ultimate beer to get people off of the American macro brew."
"Drinkability was all right. I wouldn't go crazy for this one, but it is middle of the road."
"When it comes to the bottle however it can't be beat. There's not much about this beer I don't like, it's no-frills, good pils which you can drink at any time of the year. It has a nice golden colour, not too pale, and when poured into a ""Tulpe"" glass it has a medium-sized head which doesn't last too long. It smells comforting and warm. Doesn't go down as smoothly at first but that gives it more character. Tastes great warm as well as cold and is good on tap (but I prefer the bottle)."
"A solid and highly quaffable German pils."
"Poured pale gold with a tall thin white head that disappered after a little while, leaving slight lacing. Aroma was pilsner: crisp hops and malt. Taste was smooth at first, then a sharp bitter hop finish. A clean-tasting German pilsner with a little twang at the end. Nothing earth-shattering, but a nice, drinkable beer."
"Its mouthfeel is fine with a pure tightly carbonated bite that is enjoyable. Someone here said that it would be good to enjoy while mowing the law. That just about says it all."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light and the beer goes down very smooth, a lot nicer then a lot of the American swill that is around here."
"This is a drinkable beer for all intent and purposes, and I would reccommend if you're looking for something on the light side that's not overly bitter. A solid beer."
"Notes- Give this one a try when the weather is warmer. Really showed me that Warsteiner is a good company that has alot to offer. I wasn't disappointed, but I'll keep on the look out for some dunkel lager."
"Warsteiner Premium Verum was pale golden in color with a white head. The head was meduim in size to start with, but was soon reduced to a thin spotty layer. The aroma was noble hops and light malt. The taste was about the same as the aroma, crisp with a dry finish. The body was medium-light with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This was my first ""good beer"" and opened my eyes to a bigger world of beer. It is still something I purchace a couple times a year."
"Pours a light straw color with chunky white head. No real scent to it. Not a whole lot of flavor either. Just a little bit sweet. Very creamy mouthfeel. It's drinkable, for a lot of the same reason budweiser is.. It makes no statements, so it's hard to disagree with it."
"I filled my 1985 Munich Oktoberfest mug with this beer out of a 5 liter mini keg. I poured it into a stein. The color was a mild gold, with a good head that left heavy lacing. It both smelled and tasted sweet and biscuity, very pleasing and easy to drink. A nice mouthfeel that completes this beer as a solid all round session type beer."
"There are just so many better German pilseners out there, there's absolutely no reason for me to have another one of these. It's drinkable enough, however, that I could have a few if offered. :-)"
"."
"It has a good malt body, but a crisp finish, which makes this an excellent warm-day drink."
"Large white frothy head with medium retention. Only mild lacing. Very clear yellow color with lots of carbonation. Smell is very grainy, lots of adjuncts. Maybe a little grassy, but mostly grain. Taste is very grainy, a little bit of biscuity yeast, and slightly metalic. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is an OK beer, not my favorite style, and not my favorite Pilsner. But I won't say no if someone offered me one."
"Get my buzz on- y (session)"
"This is a nice pils to sip out on my balcony and enjoy the end of summer."
"But that bias being said, the color was light. It was very perky on the tongue with an easy to drink feel to it. I think I might have to give it another try soon and review again."
"Cant believe I havent reviewed this one before. Used to drink it often years and years ago. Served from a 500ml bottle. In appearance its just your typical run of the mill pilsner, pale golden with a thickish pure white head. Aroma is mainlly of grassy hops but its compartivlly weak. Nice enough taste, this has good malt but the grassy/spicy hop is more dominant. I really liked the mouthfeel on this one, quite smooth and no problem at all to gag one down. An average beer, good in hot weather"
"Clockwork"
"The fact that I can't find the style and it says premium already has me worried. Ingredients listed in English and German, interesting. Well it looks like a pils, and tastes like a pils, so that's what I'm going with. Poured a giant fluffy white head that was fed by clouds of bubbles from the clear golden (probably closer to clear then golden) beer below. Specs of lace are left as the head slowly fades. Light grassy hop aroma is not very interesting. The same grassy hops are in the flavor an touch of bite in the end. There isn't really a whole lot of flavor, just the fizzy carbonation on your cheeks and a kind of watery mouthfeel. A decent pils, but nothing to write home about."
"Notes--very good drinkable pilsner."
"THE BEST GERMAN PILS I HAVE DRANK. I ADVISE TO TASTE IT AT LEAST A TIME IN YOUR LIFE. VERY GOOD IN BOTTLE BUT EXCEPTIONAL IN GROWLER"
"Pale gold color, with good head and some lacing. Not much in the way of smell, just some random hints of malt and hops. Taste is pretty nondescript. Nothing at all objecitonable. Slightly grassy and citrusy hops on a malt base. Mouthfeel is fairly light, with pretty good carbonation. Drinkability is moderate. I'd take it over an AML any day, but probably not something I would pick up in the store."
"Apparently this is the official beer of Lufthansa, it was all they were serving on our way to Munich. Served to me in a bottle, it had a strong hoppy smell. It tasted exactly as it smelt. It had a loose, wet mouthfeel. It was quite drinkable, but left a slight film on my tongue. Average, but I had another, and another. It was a long flight."
"Nothing spectular, but a rather solid beer overall for the style."
"Much better in a can than in a bottle. A genuine pleasure on a hot summer day."
"Man, this is the best-looking pilsner I've seen in forever. Bright new brass color is crystal clear and the head on this beer is huge. It stays for the entire time I drink my massive 22oz serving and leaves a great lacing. I couldn't really smell (smokey bar) but I'll assume it was a nice puchy noble hop smell based on the taste. Speaking of which, very simple but bold and balanced. Rather on the sweet side for a pilsner, but balanced by the drying power of a very forceful hop bitter. Has that Hienekin/ Grolsch kind of crisp, snappy finish. Mouthfeel is a little stingy. Forgot how good this stuff is. I drank quite a bit."
"As others have said, it is fairly dry to the taste and has a touch of flavour compared to some German beers. I have drank it many times in the past, draught, bottled and canned, it is a fine example of a better German Pilsner in my opinion."
"Pours pale yellow color with a nice creamy head. Aroma is the typical lager smell with grain, grass, and a slightly spicey hop aroma. Taste is actually pretty flavorful for a lager. This is one of the best hopped lagers I have tried. Overall this is a decent brew that ranks towards the top of my favorite lagers."
"While this beer was alright, I was offered another one and declined."
"Not bad."
"Overall, a very good German Pilsner. Nice taste, feel, smell, etc. Widely available and beats all of those other things at the store that claim to be German Pilsners. Give it a try, and don't be surprised if you end up getting it again!"
"In my opinion, one of the top German pils available in the US. I find the low reviews a bit inexplicable, as this is a very good example of the style. Perfectly balanced and refreshing."
"I have had this beer many times before in the past, and I have remember this beer to be slighly sweet. This beer works very well on a very hot day when one may be tired and thirsty. Great for quaffing."
"Mouthfeel is not too carbonated but has some life, and same with the drinkability."
"Pilsner, Lager, Pilsner, Lager. Who freakin' cares? This is the shit. Germans make the best F-'n beer in the world. EVERYbody knows this. And Warsteiner is one of 'em. At first I thought this was just an average (great) German beer. But, out on the lake today, with time to relax and reflect on the aroma, taste, freshness and refreshing aspects of this brew, I must say it is a wonderful production. I will buy this beer again and again. ""Es schmeckt grob"" holle ya...hell yes."
"This is a classic example of a German Pils and I would recomend anyone to try it as it is a very flavorful and fresh beer."
"Notes: This one will win no awards from other BA's because of its readily available nature, but it's one solid and very available beer that is nice on a hot, humid day."
"Pours golden, sparkling, with decent foamy head that stays long enough to get it on your lip. The hops hit you like a pils in the initial taste, but the flavor mellows over time. Refreshing, good tasting and easily one of the best German ""macros"" available in the US. Beer lovers I know who have tried it on tap in Germany say it's even better that way. No surprise there. [Side note: Until this year (2006), ""Warsteiner"" was emblazoned across the chest of McLaren's Formula 1 driver uniforms. The team hasn't done so well since they lost Warsteiner as a sponsor.]"
"Premium Verum is advertised as a Pilsner (I'm assuming a German Pilsener), but it has the body and taste profile of a Central German Export. There is virtually none of the hop bite that is typical of German Pilseners. Overall, this is a very good lager, but a pilsener it is not."
"Overall impression: Very simple, but well done. Nice pilsener for the warm summer days. Nice session beer."
"D - Not bad at all. Finishing bitterness isn't nearly as harsh as some other pils'. Not overly flavourful, but reasonable for the style I think."
"The local store had a huge stack of can suitcases on hand to coincide with Germany hosting the World Cup. Well, never one to pass up a decent good, I grabbed a case and figured it would be a subsitute for the Stroh's in my summer beer 'fridge in the garage. The style suites outside drinking on a hot day after lawn mowing. This one pours out to a nice, golden color with a good size head that gives off aromas of bread dough and light lemon. The taste is solid with some malty, bread-like qualities giving way to a slight, but firm hop taste on the swallow. A nice session beer for outside. I can see putting a few of these down with some BBQ-d steaks or burgers."
"On first taste the hops shine through much more than I expected. Good bitterness to counteract what I thought might be a extremely malty brew. Bready as well, and a bit of a piney taste I can't quite put my finger on. Mouthfeel is medium in the carbonation department, crisp on the palate, sticky and a bit oily. Goes down dry and easy. An extremely refreshing pilsner."
"Nice beer to session on a summer afternoon. Very light and pale....not distinctive, just very thirst quenching without being obnoxious in any way."
"Overall, I think this is a fine example of the style. It has a very nice flavor, very smooth and clean."
"Overall: Overall, while not unbalanced, the beer tends to be rather one dimensional, mainly due to the even persistence of the hop bitterness."
"This surprised me. I expected a disgusting skunk beer. This poured a beautiful blonde color. The aroma was sweet with a light hop aroma. No skunk.The taste is simple and sweet. Most impresive was the overall mouthfeel exerpeience. This was SO smooth to the tounge. Due to that and the lack of too much skunk this was incredibly easy to drink. Almost a pleasure. There was a small level of euroskunk taste but not too much. And for 2 bucks a pop at the Keg(basement of the german house) this is a bargain."
"Easy summer drinking. Glad to see this one becoming nearly ubiquitous in small-town, bad-beer America."
"Warsteiner has an attractive pale golden yellow color. It smells sweet and fresh. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Taste is Fresh, sweet, exciting, crisp. Has a slight citris flavor from the hops and is very refreshing. I'll remember this beer. As far as I'm concerned, this beer makes up for the Germans being the most annoying pricks on earth."
"Another fine, readily available example of the German Pilsener style, Warsteiner is a good beer for all seasons. Highly recommended."
"Ahh, plenty of carbonation (i was a bit concerned due to lack of head), pretty smooth mouth feel and clean finish. This is definately sessionable, and far better than the obvious comparison to me (Bud). If I could get this locally by the case, for around same price as Bud I'd be all over it."
"Warsteiner Premium Verum pours a golden yellow colow with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle into a Warsteiner pils glass. Smell is mild, malt and hops are both present. Taste is quite good, definitely better than the typical euro lager, well balanced with a bit of hop bite. Definitely worth a try."
"much more average than i hoped. an ok german pils, but certainly not outstanding or exceptional."
"wow, this tastes really good, goes down so smooth with no bitterness, there are no complex levels of taste or aroma, but what a quality tasty beer."
"Bottle poured into glass. Maybe it's the bottle, but I've had this before on tap and the cap was much nicer. From a bottle, the cap was dismal at best and was gone before I had time to write down the smell category. But the coloring was attractive for the style. A nice pale golden and very clear. The smell was a little sweet but with light citrus and floral hops. Has the familiar macro-cereal grain nose. Taste is has a mild malty sweetness that finishes with a nice mellow hop bite to bring it down. Carbonation is high on this one, and comes a live real fast. Does leave a nice aftertaste. Great burger and ""been cutting grass"" beer!"
"Had a nice appearance with a golden color and had a white head that dissipated slowly with slight lacing. Smell was slightly skunky but still had a slight floral hoppiness to it. Has a nice clean flavor to it, again with only subtle maltiness and hoppiness as expected. Mouthfeel was decent with a good amount of carbonation and light body. Drinkability is insane on this, it goes down incredibly smooth, if only the rest of it was on this level. Definitely worth a try, and it's one that when fresh, I will be coming back to."
"Warsteiner's standard is a very decent beer, with its moderate price (under $20 a case) it is well worth the purchase. The taste is very much like a standard German larger i.e. Paulaner, Biturger. One of my favorites, recomended try out of a can, just as good if not better than a bottle"
"A touch of the Heineken skunk, not enough to make an impact as the spicey hop profile makes it bow out. Light and crisp, although there is a drying grit to the hop profile that is welcomed as it finishes with a fresh crisp snap. This is an easy drinker that is interesting enough to keep a session going no prob."
"Hey, it's no micro beer but it is a step above the domestic macros in terms of quality. This keg seemed pretty fresh, plenty of co2, nice golden (clear) color, good head (1 inch), very crisp with just a hint of hops in the finish. A bit pricier than the usual lawnmower beer, I'd say this was more a ""backyard bbq burger on the grill"" beer. I second the thought that it would be pretty easy to down quite a few of these on a hot day."
"Taste is above any macro beer. I just wanted a nice crisp clean beer to go with my turkey club during lunch and this certainly fit the bill. Nice and light and a great flavor. Crisp mouthfeel with a light body. Quite enjoyable."
"I would recommend this beer to at least try."
"As for the taste, there's an initial mild sweetness followed by a mildly bitter hop bite... the hop character here is piney, herbal and quite peppery. I'll give kudos for nice hop presence for a pils, but there's a metallic finish (from a bottle, mind you, not a can) that just ruins the flavor of this beer to me."
"Let this one warm up a bit; It's not that good served at the usual cold lager temperatures, but becomes more drinkable at warmer temperatures. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Can and have had many of these in a sitting. Wide distribution around me makes this a good option at a lot of bars that don't have a lot to offer."
"Drinkability/Overall: Nothing overly special, but better than a lot of these style beers. Doesnt challenge much."
"Picked a single of this beer up for a $1.09, and I think I'll look for it again. Very good beer to begin a night of drinking, the type of beer I'd like to grab right after getting home from work and plopping down on the couch with. Very nice."
"Overall: Nothing outstanding but nice to revisit this one again. I first drank Warsteiner back in England. I literally supped Gallons of this stuff on draft in the Red Shed during many of the live televised games during the 1998 World Cup. In short this is a great beer to pound down in vast quantities on many warm summer nights. Funny how when I drink this beer I always have a Pavlovian association with being reminded about David Beckham being sent off against Argentina though, 8 years on and that still hurts. For the price though, Ill certainly be stocking up with some Warsteiner for the 2006 World Cup as it is being held in Germany, no beer from the official sponsor for me, but I just hope Beckham behaves himself this time around!"
"It's all about the German Purity Law...baby!"
"Drinkability- A great beer to have numerous pints of with friends in a bar or any setting. Not a lot of complex flavors to savor, so you can focus on being social and enjoying pretty decent beer."
"Thanks to ithacabaron for providing me this one."
"The mouthfeel is also pretty good. It has a medium amount of carbonation and has a medium body. Easy to drink, goes down quite well. This beer is a good session beer and one could easily drink this for quite a bit before getting smashed off of it."
"Drinkability is quite good, this one would make a great beer to compliment a hearty meal, or as a summertime session beer."
"Poured a clear yellow color with a small head of foam that left some lace and also had plenty of carbonation bubbles throught out the pilsner glass. It just had a light aroma of grains and some malt in the background. The taste was malty up front with a hoppy aftertaste at the end. The mouthfeel had some carbonation, not too watery, that turned out to be vey clean and crisp. This beer made for a nice, not too special German session beer. Much better than the average American Macro."
"Quality from Germany. There is a truth in that statement. Pours a golden-yellow , nice malty taste, excellent drinkability. Mouthfeel suffers slightly from the somewhat excessive carbonation, although not to the point of offense. This pilsner has been a strong fridgemate of mine as a reliable ""after-work"" beer for nearly a year now. Finishes clean without a mention of aftertaste."
"Overall: A pretty decent little pilsner, but leaves me craving food to accompany it with. Give me either some spice or salt and I could drink another. Without that I don't think I'd go for it."
"On tap, this is one of the best thirst quenching, light beers out their. I just love it. Its clear, crisp, and dry as ice in the finish making it extremely drinkable. Theres nothing special about any of its traits but together they form a solid and exceptionally balanced and smart beverage. Theres no need for logorrhea with this one. Ii is what it is and its good."
"Pale gold in colour with strong carbonation. Smells of light malt, and a touch of grassy hops. The flavors aren't all that bold, but are fitting nonethless: more light malt and grassy hops, white baking flour, and a nice mineral note on the finish. While this beer will never win any awards for complexity, its a pretty solid pilsner that gets the job done as a light refreshment or as a compliment to a light meal. I often smuggle a few cans of this on to the golf course with me."
"This is a decent example of a good, refreshing drinkable Pilsener from the land of Pilseners. Appearance and smell are pretty average of this style of beer, taste is smooth and sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty good as it gently rinses your palate, virtually no aftertaste. A Very drinkable, overall pretty nice brew. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a simple and clean beer. Very Refreshing."
"I do like the quote on the back though..""Because life is too short to drink cheap beer."" Overall, a decent german lager. Very easy to drink and I'd be interested to try it on-tap somewhere to see if I'd enjoy it a bit more."
"A great all around pilsner that handles my generic beer drinking occasions rather nicely."
"A decent beer overall, easy enough to drink. Nothing especially exciting though. Good barbecue beer."
"Pours pale gold, with a slight haze. Thin one finger head with poor retention and non-existent lacing. The citrus hop aroma is obvious, but the pale malt scent is very faint. Munich malt sweetness, and a touch fruity, but not to the point of ester. The balance is offset by the lack of hop character in the taste or mouthfeel. Light body and even carbonation with a finish that was not very dry and semi-residual. Smooth and drinkable with a delicious flavor, but not what I would call a ""good pilsener""."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, the head stuck around for a few seconds then disappeared, same with the lacing. Scents of light hops/malt. There's a sweet taste, light body. This is very drinkable, but I would not buy it again. Much better than a MGD, Coors, Bud, etc..."
"fantastic german pilsner, of great smell floral like perfumed; taste wide, bitter, clean and slightly smooth, great lacing; good for most of german. american and mexican food, serve in a pilsner glass of course, dont drink from the bottle; 95% recommended."
"Tried this beer at the Virginia Beach Octoberfest. Served in opaque plastic cups so I didn't get to to appreciate color too much. Looked typical golden color. Small head that hung in there for a while with little or no lacing (once again plastic cup). This is a good tasting Pilsner, light but with much more flavor than a macro lager. Leaning towards hops vice malt but no real strong taste. Mouthfeel was good, carbonation just right and no real aftertaste. I had this after a horrible tasting Koenig Ludwig Hefe Weizen (until I try it again, I am blaming this one on a keg that might have been tapped the day before!!!). The Warsteiner went down nice after this one. I like stronger tasting beers better, but I wouldn't turn down the Premium Verum if offered one. Would be a good session beer on a warm day or good served with food."
"notes: wouldn't have this unless someone offered it to me or if someone decided to buy me a six of it."
"Notes: not much to say about it"
" The taste is reasonably good; light and crisp with the satisfction of the same pleasant bitter taste your nose just enjoyed. This beer is very smooth going down the hatch. Overall decent but nothing to write home about. However I can easily see drinking several of these in front of the tube on a fall Sunday afternoon. Very Drinkable."
"Very pleasant, crisp and refreshing."
"I give it an A-."
"My brother in law thougth he was hooking me up with this one. Just kind of blah. The best I can muster to say about this beer is that I poured with a nice head. I was also very dry, crisp and I imagine it would be refreshing if I wanted to be refreshed. It just doesnt taste very good."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, white head forms but goes quick, little lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, little tiny bit of hop presence. Tasty is sweet malt, some citrusy hops, nice clean bitter finish. Thin mouthfeel but the carbonation is nice, not bad at all."
"Overall-at first I thought this beer was going to be a big dissapointment but it certaintly has more than meets the eye, refreshing, flavorful, and not too alcoholic, nice combonation."
"Pours amber clear with a tiny amount of precipitating carbonation. Medium, whitish head that slowly fades. Unremarkable, hopsy, wheat nose with hints of citrus. Pleasantly bitter mouth with a heavy wheat or grass overtone and a touch of citrus. Average mouthfeel, a bit bubbly which is pleasant. Good drinkability. A slightly bitter finish. Overall, above average."
"Overall Impression: Very drinkable and a good hot weather beer. A good reward for some sweaty work. Flavorful enough to hold interest, light enough to session. Top notch pils in my book."
"Bottle obtained as part of a discount 6-pack in July 2005 and consumed a couple days later. Freshness date is 12 May 06 11:13. Pours a one finger nearly white head over a crystal clear pale straw colored liquid. Smells pils malty with really nice noble hop floral (the hops give some hint of melon in the nose) and some saltine crackers. Hallertauer would be my guess. Taste is quite strong hops, but it's supported nicely with a malt sweet. Hops are noble and taste kinda like mushrooms. Hop bitter is minimal, but comes across late and as kinda flat due to an oily hop character that lays on the tongue. Body is light and carbonation is strong. Not bad for a 'discount rack' purchase."
"The mouthfeel is thin and the beer has a light to medium body. Very drinkable and thirst quenching on a hot day sitiing in my daughters' pool!"
"Of course there is much more to this beers character. Theres a maltiness in the aroma but also a hint of the hops, which will do nothing to deter the interest of your average drinker. A pleasing note about this brew is the evidence of the hops not just in the aftertaste but also from the front to the back of the palate. Its never particularly dry at any time, except for a hint of bitterness in the finish, thanks to a good balance of sweet maltiness. Overall it drinks very easily, and satisfies without challenging the tastebuds too strongly."
"Drinkability: A good quaffer when the mercury tops 90 degrees"
"This beer has a light color w/ a small frothy head. The smell is very faint, but decent. It has a malty taste, that at first tastes rather tart. After the bottle you crave another. Not a bad beer, I've had alot better, but I would drink it again. Its $12 for a 12 pack at Publix here, not a bad choice for the price."
"Appearance is a very pale translucent golden color, some foam and lacing. Aroma is sweet malt with only a hint of hops. This a very dry beer with some metallic notes in the initial taste. Leaves the palate clean and has little aftertaste. A good choice if nothing else is on tap, but a little too ordinary for me. Refreshing and good on a hot day."
"A pretty standard beer. Nothing to note in the appearance, smell, or taste. A basic pilsner. Looks a bit yellow, but fairly clear. Clean smelling, with an earthy smell, and the taste is sweet but with some slight, biting bitterness from the hops at the end."
"Enjoyed this froma mini keg that can be found at the local grocery store for $15. Pull and twist tap to it, serves perhaps 30 pints? Anyway, very creamy mouthfeel, clear and crisp appearance. Pours a terrible head but their may be other factors to this as well. Could drink this one all evening, but moved on to try something different."
"Warsteiner Pils is straw-colored, lighter than Pilsner Urquell, with a dense rich head of foam. It has a light malt aroma followed by a slightly spicy hops aroma. This German Pilsner has a light, dry, soft malt taste, followed by a stong hop bitterness. Very thirst-quenching."
"Looks medium straw in color with generous carbonation. Forms a snow white head that gets chunky as it falls. Smells slightly malty and grainy (in a good way). Slight souring and subtle hopping. Tastes lightly malty and vegetable like. Holds a firm body with creamyness and slight hop flavoring. Bittered only for balance. Finish is of pure grains and slight yeast. Obviously a bohemian beer without the 'skunky' flavors and aromas that usually accompany. A terrifically clean and refreshing beer. Flavors are more prominant than in most lagers, makes this beer a stand out."
"Notes: I made some wild mushroom rissoto while drinking this, a great match. Good stuff."
"Pours a nice pale straw color with a 2 finger head that falls to a small oating over the brew. The nose is pretty grainey with a slight honey-touched sweetness, but mostly grainey. The flavor is mostly grainey, with a small blast of noble hop in the middle and a grainey harshness on the finish. Not bad at all. The feel is moderate, with a pretty active carbonation that dances lightly on my tongue. I have to say, this is a nice beer for a warm night. The flavor is a little too much on the grainey side, but its still not bad. Highly drinkable and refreshing."
"Sweetness wins out on the decently long finish. A nice session pils from the bargain bin. This sample from an impeccably fresh closed 12 pack with a best before date of Feb. 24, 2006."
"¡Salud!"
"JUST not a big fan of the Euro skunk hops! The opening pop top, releasing the cabbage and the sulfur skunk, just depresses me. The pour was OK; the crystal clear lemon yellow topped by a nice white head was enticing. The taste reveled a hoppy, lightly carbonated pilsner. Unfortunately, in the end, a rather bland and boring brew."
"Taste of cereals, some reminds of hop, a shy bitterness, some note of fruity ester that are shy of banana."
"Overall it was an average beer. The maltiness was nice, but the hops and the strange astringent flavors detracted from what would have been a great session beer."
"Overall, it's an easy drinking beer perfect for enjoying during the spring and summer. I will keep some on hand throughout."
"This one pours a very clear straw yellow color. An okay airy looking small-sized head at first, but it disappears almost before I even have a chance to take my first drink. I'm really having trouble detecting any smell at all from this beer, possibly a faint malt scent guided with a grainy approach. The taste is simple at first, followed by a souring affect. Not quite bitter, more sour. Interesting. The mouthfeel is average for the style, maybe a little too watery. Overall this is not a bad beer, not incredible either, but good enough to help myself to another once this one is gone."
"Appearance is clear and golden with an airy, bone-white head. Head retention is low, as is lacing. Smell, minerally, clean, and limey/lemony. Taste is suprisingly sweet, balanced with a prickly dryness on the tongue. Despite this dryness however, very little sign of hops in flavor. And the sweetness really stays up front, not really being toned down enough by bitterness for my tastes. Mouthfeel is spritzy on the tongue though overall not highly-carbonated, which is nice. Quaffability would increase with less sweetness and more balance from the dry side of things. Needs more hops. Still, a clean, fresh-tasting lager. Refreshing, but ultimately too middle of the road and too sweet."
"Drinkability: quite good, actually. I kind of have to be in the mood for this style but Warsteiner Premium Verum proved to be a good session beer to accompany a weekend of college basketball."
"Not one of my favorite types of beer but still drinkable and much better that the average American macro lagers."
"Overall, this is a run-of-the-mill German lager. It's a step above the German macrolager, but it's nothing special, either. It's worth a try."
"Premium Verum pours golden wheat a color with an average head. Highly carbonated. The smell is strong of grainy aroma, maybe just a little too strong for the style. Taste is fresh and grainy. Light sweet taste is also noted in the mix. Drinkability is very good. This isn't the best from Germany, but for the price is definently a good deal."
"1/2 liter can. Pours a pale straw with a 1 finger fizzy head not great retention moderate lacing. Little aroma...some detectable sweetness over slight herbal tones. Wet mouth feel, some bready malt, some herbal hops, finishes fast and clean...seems like an average German Pilsner to me...slightly better than domestic mega suds and almost as indistinct."
"Would drink again"
"Looks like this is your best choice when they serve beer on a Lufthansa flight, unless you prefer Becks. This turned out to be just a notch above most beers of its kind. Its character actually lets the mild hop profile come through. Still hard to get past the fact that it looks and pours just like a Miller."
"This was an okay pilsner...but nothing spectacular. White, bubbly head atop a golden brew. There is little to no lacing on the glass. There is a grassy smell to this beer and it seems to take control. The malts are light and crisp with a bit of sweetness. Prepare yourself for an average beer."
"Drinkability: A good pilsner. Much better than Labatt Blue and co."
"Limpid dull urine in color. Initally frothy head gone in an instant. Thin ring at the edge but, alas, no lacing. Aroms are sweet. Not much else...perhaps some earthen hops? Flavor is average. Not too bad, but nothing stellar. Crisp and dry, with a dash of sweetness up front, followed closely by a husk-like grain flavor, and ended with a bitter hop aftertaste that was short-lived. Decent body and mouthfeel for a pilsener. Drinkable? Sure. Would taste much better on a hot and humid Richmond day."
"This is a fairly plain beer, but there isn't anything too bad about it."
"Smooth clean mouthfeel, very refreshing, very drinkable. Great session or after a hard day outside (or in my case behind the computer)."
"Clear gold/straw color, medium head fades to tiny bubbles. Smmells like just another middle of the road boring euro lager (grass and cereal). Taste is extremely grassy, though, setting itself apart from other euros, but not necessarily in a good way. Grassy sweetness gets cloyying towards the bottom of the glass, one of the only beers that I have had that is spicy because of malt."
"On-tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a light gold color with one finger of head that dies off slowly. There is just a little lacing. The smell is barely there. A little bit of light toasted malt and some grassiness, but that's about it. The taste is also very light, but there's a good malty base and a touch of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and watery. The drinkability is good though. Just your average german helles lager."
"Drinkability- One of my top two pils probably. Ranks right up there with Radeberger IMO."
"Drinkability: This one suits me just fine. Not something I could drink all the time, but it's a decent beer overall!"
"Pours out very pale yellow almost clear. A nice fluffy head that fades thin. Smells clean and crisp. The taste was not what I was expecting. It has a nice balance of malt and hops, with good carbonation. I was worried by the looks at first, but was impressed with the taste. I could drink this stuff by the buckets Fun"
"Pours an extremely pale yellow color (too pale) with a wispy head and some moderate lace. The aroma is very delicate with a soft grainyness and some light herbal hops. The taste is the same, with very soft malts and light hop flavors. Theres a crisp yeast flavor in the finish. This beer is ok though it could definitely be more assertive. Its just too soft tasting. Though thankfully, its far better than macros in Canada."
"Better than Budweiser, but not worth the price."
"This is a pretty plain, but very drinkable pils. It is the standard light golden color and has a white head that dissipates quickly. It has a light sweet/grassy aroma that is nothing remarkable, but works just fine for a pilsener. The taste is sweet and ends with a bitter finish. Just perfect for a summer day or any time that a clean pilsener is desired. All in all it is a decent German macro pils that is easy to drink."
"Poured from a dark brown 500 ml bottle purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Eureka, California. Body is slighty hazy honey-gold, cloud-white head is fairly substantial with some clots of lace sticking to the glass. Smell: lemony, grassy-earthiness, somewhat tart, refreshing. Taste: underbelly of buttery malts followed by a tangy burst of hop bitterness (narrow, raspy) over my entire palate. The round, buttery malts remain solidly in the background but don't jump out. The taste here is mostly puckering, narrow, yet refreshing bitterness. Nicely carbonated. Not bad."
"On the back the bottle says ""Because life is too short to drink cheap beer", which I imagine I've heard before but I don't know if thats a Warsteiner original. The beer pours a decent head, but kind of dominated by larger bubbles and it dissipates pretty quickly leaving little lace. The head is a nice white atop the beer, a very pale gold in color and crystal clear. The aroma is a nice blend of floral hops and sweet maltiness, not really strong but nice. I bought this from the back of the shelf to avoid skunkiness & I seem to have succeeded. The flavor is a pleasant blend of malt and hops with nothing really dominant - kind of dry but enough malty umph to back up the hop flavor and bitterness, which lingers on the back of the tongue in the finish. This is a pretty balanced beer. I don't know how it compares to other German pilsners; I can imagine others are better but this is a pretty good beer and a solid choice."
"Warsteiner is an old favourite. It pours a wonderful pale gold with a foamy white head into my mug. Smell, well it smells faintly of hops and a little apple, but smell is certainly not its strong point. Taste though, is really good, and very smooth with a crisp hoppy/nutty finish. This is a session beer, great for sitting out on the balcony on a summer's day. I could definitely drink this all night, I should have bought more."
"Predominantly, it has the sour and metallic smell I equate with beers I can’t stomach. It has a very light malt odor with faint sweetness. The moderate body comes with a crispy carbonation and mouth feel. A grainy, cut hay or grassy flavor first hits your tongue. This is the flavor I’ve had lately, most notably with DFH Lawnmower, which I don’t like in beers. However, it is muted here and finishes clean and dry. Although definitely filtered, the more complex flavor is enough to keep it above most run of the mill macro pilsners out there. It went well with a seafood appetizer, but didn’t hold up to a filet with creamy artichoke sauce."
"Not a bad beer, but not above average, either. I was a bit dissapointed with it because of that. Easy to drink a lot of, but you could say that about PBR. The tagline of their advertising is ""Life's too short to drink cheap beer"". Well, I got news for you, life's too short to pay a premium for average beer."
"The finish was nice with an eveness through the aftertaste. The body was medium light."
"I remember buying a mini-keg of this stuff years ago and it wasnt bad, but this bottle was not good."
"57"
"Fizzy, light mouthfeel, very drinkable on a hot September(?!) day, but hardly lives up to it's slogan: ""Because life is too short to drink cheap beer."""
"not a bad beer in any way. it has the germal feel and taste. a casual or uneducayed beer drinker minght not fully apreciate a beer like this, but i find it to be enjoyable. dark, flavorful, hoppy, with some biterness, not skunky, but quite refreshing for a darker brand of beer."
"Pours a plae golden pilsener color with a large white head when poured in the Warsteiner fluted pilsener glass. Nice lacing left behind. Grainy pilsener malt aroma with a fair dosage of hops present as well. Good malty body and a slightly hoppy and astringent dry finish. Very drinkable and well-carbonated. A good session pils."
"-Oelergud"
"Final Thought: Cincinnati imports Warsteiner... and granted it's a little overrated as to the liking of other German greats like Weihenstephaner, Spaten and Franizkaner; this stuff is a little mellower and still pretty damn good..."
"I'm not in the mood for another but I will be again."
"An ordinary, nothing special German beer. The back of the label says ""Because life is too short to drink cheap beer"". Pours a pale straw color with a minimal thin white head. There is ample carbonation. The aroma is faintly banana like. The taste is somewhat bland at first, but follows up with a grassy aftertaste. I have noticed that this beer has gained some popularity in the major grocery stores, but I think it's only because it's made in Germany. So So."
"Drinkability  This palate-cleansing Pils went down just fine. I would definitely buy again."
"I used to like this beer a lot, before I knew anything about beer. I made the mistake of pouring it into a glass one day. This beer is one shade darker than water. I remember being so shocked at the color. I expected a much darker beer. No lasting head to speak of. I have to say it is smooth, pretty drinkable. Medium carbonation. Smell is fairly non-descript. Grain, malt... hops?. Taste is the same way. The word ""basic"" comes to mind. Even slightly watery. Not a bad beer though."
"Overall it is a nice crisp german pilsner that is a good alternative to the typical american lager, its easy to find, and not all that pricey."
"A good German Pils for a warm summer day. This one poured a medium yellow color with a small white head that did not stick around for long and did note leave much in the way of lace. The dominant smell was malt but just enough hop in there for you to notice. The taste was similar with a good malt flavor but the hops kicked in at the finnish to balance everything out. Mix that with a good mouthfeel and this is a great beer to drink with some brats off the bbq in these warm summer months."
"Bottle: Poured a golden beer with a small head with almost no retention. Aroma is very weak with small touch of malt and sweet coming out of my glass. Taste is also very weak, almost watery with no hops detectable. Very bland and boring pilsner. I guess this could be an OK session beer on a beach down south"
"Still, all and all a clean, smooth drinking beer. In my opinion a great beer with German style food."
"This is a pilsner done right. Pours the typical pale straw yellow but the frothy head is what stands out from the get go, lacing is minimal but still decent. A very sweet smell from the malt and you can barely tell of hops involved. The taste is smooth, creamy and very refreshing. Grainy and earthy yet very crisp and the hop bitterness leaves that nice puckering with every sip. This is a great pilsner, very cheap as well, you can get a 16oz plus .9 for 1.59. Great deal for a great beer. Perfect for a meal and on those hot BBQ days."
"Even without the extra bite, this goes down well and for the $0.97 that I paid for it this is a very drinkable beer."
"A very cear and clean light yellow color with a big white foamy head. About half the way through the bottle I could detect a light sweet biscuit aroma, but not much else.There was a grassy/grainy flavor with a smooth bitterness in the finish. I could definitely recomend this to any of my Lager-head friends."
"Pale, clear straw color with a modest head. Nicely malty aroma with a bit of hops. Initial taste is slightly sweet followed by malt and some grassy hop spiciness. Thin, fizzy mouthfeel. Clean, smooth finish A pleasant, easy to drink beer, but there are other pilseners that I like better."
"Warsteiner Premium Verum is decent beer, but is only a fraction better than average in the grand scheme of things. Even though it doesn't overly appeal to me, I do appreciate its adding to my growing, but still limited, knowledge of the pilsener style."
"A pretty standard pils, very dull"
"Pours a light golden color with a thin white foamy head. The head disappeared quickly with no lace left. The smell was sweet, and slightly skunky. The taste was unnaturally sweet up front, like rice, with a hint of bitterness at the end, with a good amount of skunkyness. Very thin body, and highly carbonated. Not very drinkable to me. I will pass on another one."
"this beer really does claim to be ""the queen on beers."" seriously, i'm not kidding... it's printed right there in german and gold on the label. a somewhat accurate billing, i think. anyway, it pours creamy amber and tumbles heavily into a bold off-white head and a golden body. smells sweet, nutty, and a little like citrus. head fades to whisps of lace after only a minute or two. starts clean, noticably bitter, and sporting a minute citrus taste. this brew is medium bodied and offers a very even, bitter, and practically undefinable taste as it sits on the tongue. once the brew washes away, its finish drags a smooth, malty taste over top of the pervasive hop bitterness. unfortunately, the bitter note remains in teh aftertaste after the malts fade away. the result is a metallic aftertaste that not only lasts, but is also unpleasant. overall, though, a very drinkable beer."
"This was actually the first beer I purchased after turning 21, so it is a sentimental favorite for me. It is actually a decent session session beer and i love the mini-kegs for cookouts with my buddies (as they can actually drink this beer). Appearance is a nice clear golden color with a white foam head that lingers for awhile. Smell has a faint note of some hops but is mainly malt as far as i'm concerned. Taste is more of the same, this beer is extremely balanced and nothing really jumps out at me. Mouthfeel is smooth but nothing special. Drinkabilty is good... I can drink this all night"
"I usually prefer American and British beers but this one is a bit better than some of the other Germans I've tried, although admittedly the Germans I've had are of the ""larger brewer"" variety so I haven't even come close to exploring them. I could find this a dependable beer I could get a 6er of from time to time."
"Sampled 12/13/03"
"Note- I gotta admit that their old elitist ad pitch about life is too short to drink cheap beer still sticks with me- I find it too short to drink blah beer. Won't go out of my way for this."
" One of the better European pilseners, in my humble opinion."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It is a light beer with pale malt and skunky yeast scent. The taste is above average. It has a nice refeshing taste, but is limited to basic pale malt flavor and a bitter, dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine German pilsner, but not a favorite of this American drinker."
"Pale straw in colour, slight head with some lacing. Metallic grain aroma, not much else to it. Light grainy flavour, with a metallic aftertaste, could not discern any hops to speak of. Watery mouthfeel, not much body to it, not very pleasant at all to be honest. This was far better from a can, which utterly boggles my mind. Perhaps it may be a freshness issue."
"Wow, I would have sworn this was better, but the bottle I had while in Germany just wasn't as good as the other beers I had been enjoying. Pour wasn't bad looking: pale golden with a thick frothy white head. Unfortunately, the aroma was reminiscent of...cooked vegetables. I found the taste grainy, and the finish was sweeter that I am normally used to. I will try this again if the opportunity arises, but next time I will stick to smaller breweries. It's a shame, as this is considered a permium beer in Germany. Brewed with hop extracts."
"This German lager pours a clear pale gold with a large white crown of foam that leaves occosional lacing. The smell is slight with a hint of hops. The flavor is pleasantly malty, but not chewy. The hops don't jump out at you, but are present enough to provide a crisp flavor. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing, slightly dry. Drinkabiltiy factor is high, I could see polishing off several of these."
"Drinkable, but Bitburger is better."
"Great carbonation and smooth mouthfeel makes this an easy drinking beer."
"My my, just a very crisp, clean pilsener from the ""Land of Chocolate"" (credit: Homer Simpson). It doesn't want to make me pack up my bags and head to Germany to try it on tap, but I wouldn't mind having this around the house as an everyday beer. A good beer to sit in front of the TV with and watch football."
"Clear, bright golden hue. A decent clear white, foamy head, that will maintain it's life throughout. Ugly aroma - some grassy and wheat notes? Decent carbonation. Light to medium bodied, but not a bit weak. A pleasant malt-based body, very crisp and clean. Wheat biscuit, cracker-like flavoring. Minimal hop detection, yet noticeable throughout. Clean and malty palate. Does not offend, in fact, a quaffable pilsner."
"Final Thoughts: IMO an excellent lager. Would like to have on tap. The top selling German beer at the liquor store I work at. Easily better than expected, and I like the packaging. Going to have to get one of our ""mini-kegs""."
"Pours clear enough to take an eye exam through. There was a nice wheaty smell. The taste is really smooth but nothing fantastic. This beer is easiest described as a crowd pleaser. I cannot imagine anyone that can't say it isnt a decent beer. On a hot summer day, I wouldn't mind a cooler of this at the beach, but not a beer that I would favor as my regular."
"This beer was a nice crisp clear golden color. It also had a nice large white fluffy head. The smell was really light with some sweetness to the nose. Taste was also light with made it really easy to drink. The aftertaste seemed to have a sweet almost honey taste to it. Again a very easy beer to drink but nothing special."
"ive enjoyed this brew many times without being rocked by it. all up tho still one of the more tasty lagers going around in the already flooded market of the style."
"Highly drinkable. Nothing that will rock your beer drinking world, but a good ""next step"" for those who drink primarily mass produced rice and corn syrup American beers."
"the thing saving this beer is it's amazing creaminess. very smooth and drinkable. i must admit though, i don't remember the bottle version being as smooth. must be the mini keg."
"Overall: highly underrated beer, if you are a pilsner drinker and crave some extra malt character, this is it, a great beer to convert a misguided, ""light beer"" drinking friend"
"A dead clear, incredibly pale gold-colored beer, my bottle started with a messy, clump head disappearing to nothing fast. It also had big bubbled carbonation sticking to the side of the pint glass. Smelled of florals and grainy malt. Tasted of thin pale malt and a sticky dry bitter from the clean florals of German hops. Pretty good session pilsener with a bit more character than an American pilsener. Smooth moderate mouthfeel and not too filling - not a bad beer, too."
"I found Warsteiner much more enjoyable than Bitburger but not really a gem in itself. Color is a fairly vivrant gold with a thick white glob of a head. Aromas are slightly more pungent and fill the nose with slightly herby and tangy aromas. Flavor is much milder but offers light hoppy notes and clean finish. Flavors are extremely non offensive and help to achieve a slightly higher than average drinkability."
"Pours to a sudsy white head and pale yellow color with ample carbonation. Aroma is rather much like Heineken with out the skunkiness--sort of spicy, as you would expect from Saaz hops. It also smells of cheap malt and corn adjunct?! The corniness must be just the sweetness developed from German mashing methods. It tastes decently good enough. It has a cheap malt and grass with a nice refreshing lingering dryness/bitterness/spiciness in the finish. It can make a decent session beer but nothing outstanding."
"I may very well be over-rating this pilsener, but I thought it was well-balanced, and despite the level of carbonation, I would chose this over a Bud/Coors/Miller/Fosters/Canadian any day. Pity about the lacing and the head, though."
"This beer pours a clear medium golden yellow color with a large bubbly white head. The smell is a mild but rich maltiness with a very very slight spicy underlying hoppiness. The mouthfeel had a rather suprising roundness. The flavor opens with a mild slight sweet malt with a slightly astringent hoppiness. This beer while not bad smelled better than it tasted."
"16 oz. can that pours clear golden color with a decent white foamy head that sticks to my glass, light grassy and flowery aromas, bready malt and herbal hop flavors, light bodied with a crisp mouthfeel, finishes clean and semi sweet, pretty average but not that bad coming from a can."
"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly herbal (?). A medium bodied pilsner, with the typical pilsner flavor, Its slightly malty and slightly hoppy. Smooth taste. Very drinkable. Nice, but nothing special. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and slightly dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"If the beer is this light, then why bother to drink beer. Water will do fine."
"John"
"Poured a light golden color with a thick and fluffy head. The head sticks around for a while, but gradually fades away. Lots of effervescence. The aroma is lightly hoppy, but not too impressive. The taste is crisp and prickly with a dry finish. This particular bottle did not have any green apple flavors that I noticed in the beer I had last night (but didn't review). Mouthfeel is very thin, and just plain boring. Certainly a drinkable beer, but if life is too short to drink bad beer - as the bottle implies - then it is also too short to drink average ones."
"Brown bottle, no best by date."
"($6.39 / 6-pack)"
"This one pours a pale golden straw color with a rather large white frothy head that stays. This one is well carbonated with lots of bubbles rising to the top. Smell is of nothing. Taste is rather weak. Some adjuncts are detected in the body and slight grainy malts and there too. Finishes with a slight yeasty, hoppy lingering flavor. Sharp and crisp on the tongue. Body is pretty big for a pilsener. Better than American macros but nothing superb."
"Thx"
"Light straw color that is most remarkable in its paleness. Average head that dissipates quickly. Smell is characterized by ""mainstream"" grain smells but, thankfully, a lack of skunkiness. Taste is dry and cleanly grainy but at the same time unremarkable. Mouthfeel is fine, and this one is more than adequately drinkable. A good, not great, pilsener--overshadowed by many of its German counterparts but better than many of its American brethren."
"This beer poured a clear, surprisingly light yellow color with creamy white foam that settled. The smell was slightly sweet and bicuity malt with some tangy hops. A very pleasant aroma. The taste was a good, German pils taste with a good balance of sweet, biscuity/bready malt and tangy hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body. There was a pleasant biscuit malt and hops aftertaste. This was a good, light pils, and easy to drink."
"This beer pours a very light yellow - extremely clear. The aroma is slightly hoppy, but not too interesting. The taste is bitter, but not too strong. Fairly plain beer, but enjoyable. Reminds me of a really weak flavored pilsner. Don't have much more to say about this beer, but I need to fill some space to make the minimum length ... and ... done."
"Hoppy pilsner from Warsteiner.. Straw color and light with a floral nose and bitter finish.. malt is not prevalent in this beer as it has a little carbonation with very little head.. taste is weak and mild but as always a pils just not malty as many other.. it is better on tap than in the bottle, but only slightly."
"More pale-yellow-urine clear color with a short lasting large bubbled head. Faintly yeasty, mown grass hoppy aromas. Medium soft body, with malty light pop-corn sweet, bitter hop flavours. Soft and foamyon pour, a weak, almost flat, finish. Too light for my taste buds."
"Reminded me of a wine cooler, but drinkable non the less, just not something I normally drink or buy."
"A decent pilsener. All of the sudden, I could go for a coney dog with a brown spicy mustard...in particular a Hoffmann coney from Central NY area...and some red skin potato salad. Gee, I wonder why?"
"When poured into my glass, this pilsner poured with a medium head that dissolved quickly. The carbonation could be seen rising to the top. It had a fruity aroma to it in my opinion. The body was yellow in hue. It had a bitter taste and an aftertaste that lingered."
"The appearance of this fairly mediocre pilsner consisted of an attractive, clear golden color. It had a nice frothy head that dissipated quickly. The smell was of weak malt, with a decent hop presence. A crisp yet smooth taste was defined by the solid malt foundation, and the hops make a lightly bitter complement. The mouthfeel was a bit too bland, bordering on rough. The smoothness in the taste was pretty much absent in the feel and the aftertaste. A decent beer all around, I'd choose Warsteiner over the American macros in a second. Still, I've had much better pilsners."
"This pale yellow pilsener tops a mild white, slightly hopped head and nose. The aroma is of minor malty flavors struggling to please the palate. Although and enjoyable, average pilsener and slightly bitter mouthfeel, it finishes dry. I like it, and echo others in wanting to try it on tap."
"Every time I drink this, I think it must be dumbed down for the American market. The appearance is decent, with a golden color topped by a nice white head. The head recedes quickly, and the aroma is just a faint note of hops. The taste is a little bitter, with a slight edginess to it. Minimal malt tastes and no real flavors to speak of. The mouthfeel is a little harsh, but somewhat typical for an average Pils. A slight lingering aftertaste is distracting and tough to identify. Almost like cardboard. Drinkability OK. It's better than most US Macro lagers, but there a plenty of better beers out there in this price range. It may suffer a bit due to transportation. Seems to have potential, but never delivers the goods."
"Vey pale/light yellow pour with a think head. Mild nose, a little hoppiness to it, but nothing really stands out. Smooth texture, lighty hopped. Crisp towards the end and a dry bitter finish. Not something i would make a point of drinking again. A half decent beer but not a classic."
"A nice golden tone with a thick but disappearing white head pours, with a rhythmical and consistent carbonation present within, and much lacing left gradually. . The smell, slightly malty and with a small amount of hops and yeast, is very faint, but does not actually underestimate its taste: somewhat sweet, malty and bitter, with a dry mouthfeel, complimented with an omnipresent metallic underfeeling that gives it a characteristical Pilsen style. Full bodied. a fine thirst quencher and terrific pilsener."
"This sample was a 500 ml bottle that poured a crystal clear gold with a minimal white head, though when I did try to coax it along it came up much fuller. The head was very sudsy and evaporated somewhat quickly but did leave some slippery lacing. The smell was much like any pale lager, perhaps a bit hoppier. This does not seem classic pilsener style as the hops do not seem like Saaz as would be found in, say, a Pilsner Urquell. The flavor is good, not great, and this is very drinkable. Fairly high carbonation leaves a crisp feel in the finish. Better than many domestics if nothing better is around. I'd like to try the tap version to compare to this bottle."
"I could have easily written an extremely negative review of this beer, based on some servings I've had outside of Germany. This is a classic example of the veracity of the slogan: think global, drink local."
"Drank this on a cruise to Patras, Greece. Briliiantly clear, straw golden with a thin white head atop medium-large bubbles. Medium carbonation with poor retention and lacing. Aroma is distant and weak with thin earthy hops, and a clean pilsen fermentation. Mouthfeel is soft with a wet, crisp finish. Body is light. Taste begins with mild husken pale malts, immediately fading into a prolonged husky bitterness with a bright palate. A clean ferment without off flavors and a delicate and light flavor just aren't enough to maintain the beer's interest, making it feel heavy to drink."
"Very light yellow color with slight traces of a pure white foam, but no head to speak of. Faint aroma of yeast and butter, some corn. Carbonation explodes from the bottom to the top, fueling a thin white low head. Flavor is consistent from start to finish from the front of the palate all the way to the back, mostly corn. Perhaps a hint of citrus and grass, but too faint to be sure. No hop flavor to speak of. Not impressed with this selection."
"I was disappointed to say the least, after having a strong recommendation from a friend I picked some up. Color is yellow hay-like with a strong white head about a finger high and stuck around leaving patchy lace. Smell is faint malt and hop, some what skunky but didn't seem to echo in the taste, at least not all together. Taste was crisp and clean, much like a light pilsner. Although it didn't have much malty sweetness, there is a hint of herb-like hop dry bitterness. Has a medium light body feel with a faint malt and drying hop finish, left a little empty and had a small metallic tone. An OK beer but easily overlooked for a reason."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz bottle, it's quite light in color, a pale yellow with a decent sized white head that leaves traces around the glass to the end. The smell is just detectable, with notes of grain and just a bit of hoppiness. The taste is not bad and though it's quite dry, it's also slightly sweet. The hops are just enough to give it a kick. It has a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel and goes down like water."
"This is a very drinkable session type beer. not any overwhelming flavor, but it's inexpensive, versatile and can be enjoyed by just about anyone. all around, a decent lager beer."
"This one goes on sale often around here. A good beer at a reasonable price is a winning combination."
"Nice bready smell, clear golden colour. A good tasting pilsner, doesnt exactly knock your socks off but decent. A bit of a tart aftertaste but really a very clean beer. Not super crisp but an awesome session beer - filling the cooler with these is a pretty sensible idea."
"So this beer poured into the glass a light yellow/gold color. Decent carbonation was visible. There was little to no head present except for the 2-3 seconds after pouring, and what was left was a rim around the surface. The color of the slight head and rim were white, and there was no lace present. The aroma was crisp and had hints of malt and hops. The taste was also crisp, slight malt and hops were on the tongue, but I did notice a hint of sour fruit present. To be honest, it reminded me of bud, but not that bad. It was an experience but not one I would get again."
"Pours a golden color with a decent, foamy head. Clean, malty nose, but not a whole lot going on. Taste was malty, very clean and crisp. Medium bodied. This is definitely a beer you can drink a good amount of. I'd say it's a good alternative to something like Heineken. A good beer to have around just to refresh oneself."
"An excellent beer. Pours a pale blonde colour with a one finger head that quickly dissipates to half. Nice aroma of hops. Tasted sweet at first with a bitter bite afterwards. At first, this could be confused for a cerveza. One could down quite a few of these and be satisfied."
"A nice clear golden color with a white head that produces a respectable lace, Warsteiner Verum has a faint malty scent. The taste is crisp and malty with a bit of a hoppy finish. I'm not much of a lager fan and this beer will not change me, however if I had to choose a lager most likely Warsteiner would be the choice."
"Taste is not at all complex, this is a German lager to have a few of. Malty flavor and not much else. Typical German lagers should be clean, smooth, and easy to drink, and this one does its job."
"Palest pale yellow color, fine white head. Aromatic head, i.e. giving off the typical lager-type whiff. Fresh, citrusy, lemon, clean, simple, blah, blah, blah...I'm sorry, no matter how many times I try to come up with something new, fresh, original, unique, etc...there's nothing I can do!! It's a boring beer!!!"
"Pours medium straw. Decent white head which leaves quickly. Almost no smell. Very smooth taste. A little fruity tasting. Somewhat grainy finish. No distinct flavor, lacking in both the malt and hop dept. Basically, this is a pretty boring brew. Nothing bad here, but nothing special or memorable either. Worth a try, though."
"I like this beer much better than the dunkel version. Your basic german pilsner, which pours a golden hue and the white head that dissipates pretty quick. I have bought a five liter mini keg of this before, and found it to be a really drinkable beer superior to all macros. It is just a nice beer with no off flavors, a nice sweet finish that is also apparent in the aroma. If I was in Germany wouldn't touch this one, but hey in my hometown in WV there isn't many options. This is a nice beer good for football games, and any time you plan on drinking a few. Nothing I have to think too hard about, and that is what makes it enjoyable to me."
"Straw colored gold with a thick white head that fades. A hop smell hits you. Kinda fruit/sweet smell. A slight hop tase from start to finish. Very easy to drink. A light tase, more of a beer for food. A good German Pils. There are much better out there."
"Pours a clear and pale light straw color with a bubbly white head that dissipates into a nice lace spotted with tiny bubbles. Nose is clean and fresh with notes of sweet malts. The carbonation comes alive in the mouth with flavors of sweet grains and a nice amount of bitter hops. Finish is crisp and dry. This beer goes great with some grilled bratwurst."
"Quite good pils by Brauerei Warsteiner. Warsteiner Premium is one of them. Even though appearance may not be the best it could be its mouthfeel and taste must be rewarded. Also the fact that it is not very strong makes it easier to drink at any time of the day. Last word: Average German Beer"
"Appearance is very disappointing but the taste and mouthfeel is rewarding. There is no after taste with this product."
"Poured to a light yellow with a medium head. Aroma was a crisp clean while the taste was not very impressive. An easy beer to drink that has a nice hoppy finish. Certainly worth a try once but not again."
"Next to Weihenstephaner, this is my favorite German brewery to pronounce. Ignoring a moderately prickly, back-of-the-throat tickle, this beer glides effortlessly through the pipes. A gluey lace, a nose of sod and powdered sugar, a brilliant blond clarity and, most importantly, a well-balanced flavor that survives on your buds until the next tip of the glass."
"A clear light gold color on the pour, the head is mountainous, frothy, long lasting, and the lace gauzy. Nose is malt, clean and crisp. Front is malt, the top reedy, the finish is amazingly hopped for a pilsener, modest carbonation, and a very dry long lasting aftertaste. ""Lagers/Pils, will never be my beer(s) of choice, but this one is drinkable and a nice session beer. Ranks #914 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"Had this on tap in Belgium as a quick nightcap near the hotel I was staying at. And I must say it had that sweet malty flavor that I enjoy in a lager, and served in the appropriate glass just made it that much better. I gave it another full point in the taste catagory."
"Nice thick white foam on the initial pour, slowly dissipates over time but thick enough to leave residue on the glass.  Just a half a shade darker than most domestic pilsners.  A very bright carbonation followed by a dry/ burnt hop flavor, this gives way to a bitter hop after taste.  The texture is quite thin, but in a way makes the beer that much smoother to drink.  Not to shabby, who knows it might be better warm."
"Medium gold color and vigorous, fine, streaming bubbles upward to a dusting of whiteness. Smell of alcohol and overripe Meyer lemons somehow strikes a positive impression on me. Very dry on the attack. Even grain flavors throughout and bitter hops arriving in the middle. The aftertaste features a nice echo of burnt sugar bitterness. A simple beer that is nevertheless poised and easy to like."
"Warsteiner Premium Verum: really awful euro lager, bad skunked aroma, bad skunked taste.  Nice clear color though.  Not worth the money or the time, and I find the line on the back that life is too short to drink bad beer to be the height of irony."
"1 Pint Can (16 oz) with a freshness date on the bottom."
"Bright, pale gold with a firm, bright white head, Good retention. Very nice noble and somewhat spicy hop aroma backed by malt and a hint of crisp apple. Rich malt & hop flavor along with a good mouthfeel - not creamy, but full. It clearly displays pilsner malt and grassy and herbal hops backed by a solid bitterness. Very well balanced. Big hop finish with a long lasting dry aftertaste. An excellent, crisp and refreshing north German pilsner of the highest quality."
"A prime candidate for getting macro-swillers out of adjunct land."
"An average pilsner.  Pretty drinkable, but no real distinguishing characteritics.   Mine was slightly off in taste, a little skunked I would guess.  Quite a bit better than US macro, but look for a micro to get a better pils."
"Continental hop aroma is present, but the bottles I had seemed a little light struck.  Nice, stable white head. Subtle maltiness is balanced.   Finishes with a crisp bitterness.  I thought that the beer was refreshing, but sort of ordinary."
"Light body and somewhat dry with traces of malt in background, hop bitterness also mild. A refreshing and satisfying warm-weather German pils."
"Really pale color and by the time the beer got to me there wasn't much in the way of a head. Not sure if the beer is naturally small headed, quick dissipating or if they just took too long getting it to me. Very pale and thin color. Flavor isn't so pale or thin. Strong, peppery hops dominate the flavor with a bitter finish. Something about it reminded me of body odor or a kid I knew in middle school who had funky breath. Didn't really taste too skunky though."
"golden crisp clean and delicious. i was surprised to find a quality german lager priced evenly with mediocre heineken. it is smooth and lacks that overpowering carbonation of heine. fantastic right out of the bottle and even better refreshingly smooth out of a mini keg"
"Fantastic.  This one is right up there with Weihenstephaner.  The color is light and looks crisp with a moderate head.  The aroma is consistent of a real good German brew - hints of wheat and hops.  This is one great German bier!  Prost!"
"Clear golden in color with nice thick head. Moderate lace. Aroma is light with slight grass-like bouquet.  Very crisp and clean. Semi sweet with crisp mouthfeel and high level of carbonation.  Somewhat dry, finishes with a slight hop bitterness."
"Pours a pale gold color with a touch of cloudiness, very nice off white head, good lace.  Toasty biscuit malt aromas along with modest hops.  Flavor begins with a light stinging carbonation, then toasty malts and a slight sweetness, rises towards a crisp, slightly dry hop finish with herbal and medicinal flavors.  This beer's pale color is deceptive, it looks rather watery, but is in fact quite substantial.  Distictive among Pilsner-style brews and very good."
"Warsteiner Premium Verum is truly a great beer for the masses. I find myself coming back to Warsteiner, time after time and enjoying it each and every time."
"Pours with an outstanding beautiful fluffy & long lasting head.Super pale colored liquid, I mean I've had some light looking beers before...but this is LIGHT! Nose is of very light malt with delicate hops in there too. Taste has got the goods though: a clean malt mouthfeel with medium bitter hops followed by again a clean finish, on the hoppy side. Like the dark version, this beer is a pleasure to drink on a hot, hot, HOT Summer day...such as the 4th of July, like I'm doing. Please, no comments about drinking a European beer on Independence Day! :o)"
"We had this today while playing golf. It was hot and the Warsteiner was wet and cold. Very light flavor, little aroma. And we played a little better after having one! Wouldn't go out of our way to buy it but if it's there..."
"A no frills beer, but something nice and clean to switch to now and then when all you want to do is quench a monster beer thirst."
"I have to say I was a little let down the 2 times I tried this beer after hearing so many good things about it. It tastes a lot like the standard fare that is clean but not really that flavorful."
"Straw colored w/ a decent head.  It's crystal clear like a good pils should be.  Very grainy in aroma and a touch of lightly skunked hops is there as well...  typical import pilsner nose despite the brown bottle.  It's very dry and highly carbonated and the mouthfeel is thus quite prickly, but is okay for a pils.  This brew is very dry all around-- malt sweetness is minimal, and hop bitterness dominates. Although it's lacking in flavor, this would make a great lawnmower brew  (if it weren't over - priced) There's nothing memorable about this pilsner, however."
"Decently drinkable german lager, fresh clean, but quite bland in its flavour, good for a hot day when its too hot to drink beer with flavour."
"This would make a great summer time beer."
"Complex and hoppy upfront taste...very smooth middle and finish, lightly medium bodied, clean finish, no skunk...not my gig but I think its what it needs to be."
"Smooth, slightly sweet, clean and crisp, with a good hop character. A good choice on those hot summer days. Better than the American standards, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but at twice the price."
"Clean, crisp and refreshing when served ice cold. Nothing too special here otherwise. A decent inexpensive beer."
"Average sums this beer up pretty well."
"I agree with Jason, very average beer.  Nothing offensive at all about it and they go down nicely, but still average.  I think Becks and St Pauli Girl have more character, though."
