"Damn balanced and easy drinking Pilsner."
""
""
""

""

"Nice surprise! Started out as yet another pilsener, but  a hint of spiciness showed up with just the right amount of hops for clean refreshing finish. This could easily be a good back yard beer this summer."
"This is a great pilsener. It's not flashy, but it's well executed. Well done. Recommended."

"O - Very impressed, I like to buy from micros for quality so went back to store and bought another 12 pak! If you are into German Pilsners you will likey."

"05/07/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Pretty dry. Good body & a friendly ABV makes this a bona fide candidate for a session or two. Keep it cold."

"O: Impressive! This is what I've been enjoying finding in the pilsner style. Straight simple and refreshing. Quite distinctive beer but not much to overcomplicate or muck up the taste. Refreshing as hell but way too good for the lawnmower! BTW: I like this much more than Victory Prima, which I had high hopes for but was a bit disappointed in . Too bad I love this so much cause it's damned expensive at $12/6."

"O: The finesse of this beer surprised me. Blindfold me, and I'd swear it came from Germany - they even spelled pilsner ze German way on the bottle! I don't even remotely care that it doesn't bring the hop assault something like Prima Pils does, either. I'll have to return to this one ASAP, it's that good."
"T/O: Grains, biscuits, well-attenuated maltiness, but high bitterness. Good hop flavor that can be a little harsh with its straightforwardness-arrowroot, herbal character. One of the more accurate American re-creations of the style. Good lingering bitterness, tart lemon aftertaste. No doubt a pils for those who appreciate Noble hops."

"Not a bad example of the style, but the sour character is out of place. Bitterness is certainly dominant."
""
""
"Golden yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with billowy, bright froth that maintained throughout as a steady stream of bubbles continuously migrated upward. Fresh biscuity malt and earthy floral hop aromas. Incredibly soft, delicate feel throughout with a light tanginess through the middle. Biscuity malt flavor up front followed by tangy, but gentle spicy hops. Spicy flavors transition to herbal hop flavors toward the end. Finished clean and crisp with a light biscuit malt aftertaste and herbal bitterness on the edges. Super easy drinking. If not the best, one of the best pilseners I've ever had."

"O-If you want a pilsner that has a decent flavor I would highly suggest this one."

"O: Great representation of the style. Can imagine my grandfather drinking beer like this back in his Homeland Germany. Goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is not a bad drink, but it is not what it claims to be. It tastes more like a pale ale than a pilsener. It is not a German pilsener, but more like a Sierra Nevada Pale. I like Stoudts products, but i do not like it when companies get so creative that they lose the intrinsic flavour of the type of beer they are wanting to produce."

"Remarks: Well balanced and smooth; Pils isn't my favorite style, but this was pretty tasty; hops were kept in check to my tastes pretty well"

"This is a light bodied brew with an effervescent level of carbonation that is lively. Quite crisp, snappy, clean and refreshing. This is balanced quite well and a pils I could throw back repeatedly with no issue. Again, if the sulfur was not such a leading role in this, I would score it much higher but im leaving it as is."
""
""
""
"A certainly different Pilsner from Victory and worth sitting down for at least once."
""
""
"Overall: Beer looks nicer than it tastes. Too little of hops. No complex aromas or flavors here."
""
""

""
"A very well made beer thats true to style."

"I was disappointed. I thought it was hoppy enough with Noble hops but the mouthfeel was not nearly up to par with even an Oettinger. It was ""weak"" and thin. The Pils malts also lacked something. I didn't take notes, so this is the morning after. Basically, a weak imitation of a German Pils."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very original flavor, amplified a mineral -herbal sensation you usually get from Czech pils, plus adding some sweet oranges citrusy."
""
"Props to Stoudts for producing a pilsner that is spot on. It does not do anything spectacular, is just does everything spot on. Props."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is great. Great body, and head. A lot of lacing. Nose is really strong bread and savory spice and a little floral. Buttery, sweet, sourdough bread. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"Overall I am going to say that this is my new favorite pilsner. It's really good and I highly recommend it to anyone! 5 out of 5! World Class!"
"Other notable pilsners from PA...Victory Prima Pils, Slyfox Pikeland Pils, and Troegs Sunshine Pils, all of which are in the top 50 Pilsners on BA. A difficult style to get right and one that people often overlook or think about as generic...probably has something to do with all the Macro Garbage out there trying to pass themselves as german style pilsners/lagers. When you need a crisp and refreshing brew this summer, reach for a Pennsylvania-Made Pilsner!!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I enjoy that this Pils doesn't have an overwhelming amount of the generic dull and very bitter hop character that most do. This will be refreshing in the summer."
""
""
""
"Not much of an aroma, but it’s refreshing though. Hoppy and comes with an initial rush of bitterness. It is less watery and more packed in flavor compared to the Czech pilsners I’m used to. Quite drinkable and you just keep wanting another sip. Great stuff."

"D- A true session beer clocking in at just under 5%. I would gladly drink a few of these on a hot summer day but it leaves something to be desired while i drink this in the dead of winter. Would love to try this on tap at some point. A great session brew by Stoudt's, nothing more nothing less."
""
"Overall: I personally love the dynamic qualities of the flavor and the creamy, satisfying aroma. For me this is a top-notch Pils with great drinkability. I will definitely have this again."
""
""
""

"Medium-light bodied; crisp and lively carbonation. A refreshing and easy drinking beer great for putting away by the pint."

"The taste is just perfectly balanced and understated, right now I feel like I could polish off at least four of these without batting an eye before I would need to make special travel arrangements home if I were to continue after that. Has a noticeably fruity flavor that is otherwise well balanced aside from that. Stoudt's Pils has an immensely drinkable, effervescent mouthfeel that may help this beer supplant Victory Prima Pils as my favorite Pilsner available in my general area."
""
""
""
""
"O - Compares favorably with a Victory Prima Pils and a Troegs Sunshine Pils but I don't like this as much. It's not quite as smooth as the other two. Good though; and worth having again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-One of the better Pilseners I have come across that I can remember. Hoppy enough but has proper balance. Plenty to like about this brew."

"Overall I would recommend this brew. It is a well balanced pilsner. A great beer for welcoming the Summer."
""
"Color is absolutely pristine pale and clear shade of gold. Big white head that sticks around and leaves a generous amount of lace. I wouldn't change a thing about how this beer looks. The smell is mostly spicy Teutonic hops, with a little bit of graininess as well. Tastes great, really comes out and bites with the hops and snaps closed with a dry finish. The hops are a little much - don't get me wrong, I'm loving it, but I expected a little more balance, and the scales are tilted in favor of the hops here. Good, easy drinking mouthfeel on this one, clean as a whistle, but it could be a little livelier. Overall, an absolutely brilliant refresher, just about everything I want out of a German Pils. However, if the hops are going to be so strong for the style, I could do with a little more depth to their character, they're a lot more spicy than floral. A little more maltiness for balance would have been welcome. Really, though, the complaints pale in comparison to the achievements of this astonishingly well crafted and authentic beer."
""
"This pilsner was a little on the bitter side making come across unbalanced. It was however drinkable and ultimately enjoyable. It's worth checking out."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsner glass, best by 8/16/2011. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, grass, orange, biscuit, floral, and herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, grass, floral, pepper, bread, light tartness, and herbal hops. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly sticky and crisp mouthfeel. Very drinkable and smooth, with no alcohol in the taste or finish as expected at 5.4%. Overall this is a fantastic pilsner, and definitely one of the best I have had. Very drinkable, and full of nice hoppy flavors with good balance. This held up surprisingly well considering the bottle dating."

"Overall, pretty solid, but I am just not gravitating towards this or going crazy for it."
""
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a good two finger bone white head that slowly recedes but leaves much lace as she fades. Smells of sweet bready husky pilsner malt with just enough spicy grassy hops to keep this from cloying. Sweet bready pilsner malt flavor balanced with spicy grassy hops. Very dry finish with sharp spicy bite. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and sweet honey like mouthfeel. The greatness here is in the subtlety of the flavors and how well the hops and malts contrast each other. Nice nice drinker here."
""
"When i poured this beer into the glass, it has a nice golden color body with a nice white fizzy head. The smell is sweet(grape smell) and some earthy hops,grains. The taste is crisp, the nice bitter earthy hops on the tongue. The mouth feel is great, good and carbonated, and overall is a really good pilsner."

"Finishes slightly sweet, tart and clean. I wish I could see this on-tap or at the very least in bottles at bars around my area. Great beer."

"One of the better pilsners I've tried. I may seek this out again next summer."
"Overall: Thought this one would have more of a kick, but it just never got off the ground. A bit better as it warmed. Just not impressed."
"O: Crisp, drinkable beer. Pilseners aren't my favorite style, but I think this one is done quite well."
"Overall it's OK but I would take the ""Golden lager"" or pale ale over this any day. Still a pretty good beer if your a fan of the style."
"I wish the aroma were more pronounced. It might interfere with the taste then, but I still would prefer more finishing hops. Overall this is a petty good pils, and if I were in the mood I might buy it again."
"O: It's a pretty drinkable pilsener and the taste isn't bad. Could drink quite a bit of it, but I'd rather drink Prima Pils."
"O: An excellent example of a pilsener, and one of the better I have had this year. Picked this up in a mixed six, but will pick it up as long as the weather is appropriate."
"This brew does taste a lot better than it smells. After a second and third sip, the dryness that you experience toward the end of your experience starts to creep to the middle of the palate. That’s a good thing, and the bigger gulps you take the more your tongue is just overwhelmed with the hops. It’s a good beer, and I’d totally drink this again. Bottoms up people!"
"Overall: A solid pils, no doubt. Overall, I am impressed by Stoudt's."
"Overall there is nothing ""German"" about this ""Pilsener", what you are drinking is actually a blonde/pale ale. Please stop calling it german style. It's really embarrassing for German beer makers."
"O: A fine Pilsener. This is very drinkable, tastes wonderful, and nice and light. The lingering hop bitterness is most definitely noticeable and very enjoyable (and much different than a lingering hop bitterness from an IPA or similar beer.) A wonderful beer that I will seek for once the few I have are gone."
"this one was interesting and quite deceiving from the nose to the palate. pop with a beautiful pour of golden clear with a continuous generation of bubbles. nose of wafer and honey. quite doughy that is back with a lot of sweet. but still not average. somewhat rich for a lager. palate doesn't follow suit. tastes exactly like the smell of fresh toasty two row with a hint of saaz at the end. doesn't fall off but has the mineral that isn't harsh and leaves you dry. great for food or on a hot day. will have again in hopes of a fresher bottle."
"Notes: Not bad, much better than Victory Prima Pils. I am coming to the conclusion that of all the German Non-Bock Lager styles, Pilsener is my least favorite. I put Helles, Dortmund and Vienna Lager styles ahead of Pilsener as being more balanced, more drinkable, with less bitterness and less aftertaste. I won't be on an a quest for the perfect Pilsener anytime soon."
"Notes: This is one fantastic German Pilsner I highly recomend picking up this one. Cheers."
"Wonderful buttery malt flavor up front with plenty of hops to balance in middle and in the finish. Finishes dry. Full flavored and refreshing. Could drink several of these on a warm evening."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a nice white two-finger head that dissipates very slowly. Not a whole lot of aroma. Taste is sour, bitter, and grassy. Mouth feel is outstanding and has proper carbonation. This is an outstanding beer that I could drink all day."
"This is a fine example of a Pilsener. The head could be a little thicker, and the aroma could be more apparent, but still very refreshing."
"Beer looks clear and clean. Nice head and rising bubbles. Smell is sweet at first then earthy and hoppy. Taste is very crisp and clean which leads to slight hopiness that dissipates nicely on the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth and just right on carbonation. Smooth drinking and very refreshing beer."
"Smooth, clean, crisp and refreshing. Only the Prima Pils is superior in my experience."
"O: This is one of my favorite pilsners. Quite refreshing and easy to drink. If you enjoy a german pils and can get your hands on this, do it."
"Just like the Helles, one of the best American made lagers I have had. This is a bit more bitter than the Helles, which fits with the style. I wish more breweries could make lagers like these guys. Highly recommended."
"Pours a clear golden straw color, good cap of dense white foam, moderate retention. Scent is of white bread, floral and lemony hops, honey like sweetness, light mustyness that throws me off a bit. Taste is pretty straight forward - commercial white bread, lightly floral and lemony with even a touch of herbalness. Lightly sweet finished lightly musty and grassy. Medium Light bodied, feels lightly oily, moderate carbonation. Didn't do much to wow me - just decent."
"Crisp and clear appearance. Golden/Straw color, white two finger head, good lace and bubbles. Aroma was pleasant, with some earthy grassy hops, and a nice bread crust maltiness. Big grassy, slightly citrus, floral hop notes and bitterness, with a great light bready sweetness. Finishes clean, nice light body, good solid bubbly carbonation with a touch of creaminess on the texture. Drinks easy as this is a very wonderfully sessionable beer. Very refreshing, and I see myself drinking this a LOT this summer!"
"O - This is a very easy beer to drink...I could easily have three of these on a hot day or just sitting on the porch...this is what you look for in a pilsener"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and its crispness makes it particularly refreshing."
"Medium, crisp body. Taste is clean, biscuit malt balanced by hops. Long, dry finish. This is not my favorite style, but I enjoyed this brew a lot."
"Notes: I may have to revisit Troegs Sunshine pils. Until now, that was my favorite American-brewed pilsner. This one, however, might just dethrone it."
"Definitely would drink this again. I could see this becoming a mainstay in my beer fridge this summer for outdoor drinking."
"Stoudts seems to get it...unlike another pils from a well-known PA brewery, this one doesn't try to dominate the beer with hops. It's well balanced and a pleasure to drink."
"O: Easy to drink. Nice one in the warm weather. Reminds me of my PA trip when we visited the brewery."
"O- Not what I would call a German pilsner,,compared to the real deal."
"O - One of the better Pils that I've had, and one that I would happily keep around."
"O: Pretty good, extremely easy drinking, will be a good one to have in the summer out BBQing."
"Pretty impressive here, I'm into this. Bright, spritzy, flavorful, simple but engaging. An easier drinker, I could spend lot of time with this."
"I've never been a big lover of German Pilsners so this low rating shouldn't reflect on this brew but it does reflect my tastes on this style. When a I come across this style and it's got the fresh cut grass aromas and tastes I just find it unwelcoming to me. I found this beer to fall into that situation. It's a clear yellow brew with the flavors and aromas mentioned above. Just not my favorite."
"Poured a nice golden amber, a bit darker then I would have thought, and that is good. a nice fluffy pillow like white head graced the top to a height of about two inches before settling back down to just some lace ringing the glass, a touch of which stuck around for a while. Great visible carbonation evident in streams of bubbles filtering up from the bottom. Smell was light, lots of grain with some hints of maybe corn or an earthy cereal, but nothing spectacular. Taste was good, you typical pilsner. Light on the flavor, big on carbonation. Smooth crisp mouthfeel. Not a real lingering flavor, but what was there was lots of grain and corn maybe, something else but it was hard to place. Very sessionable, as it was very light. All together a good summer drinker, I have had better, but it is definatly not bad. Looking forward to hitting up some more."
"Prosit!"
"D: nice to look at and great aroma but not so exciting to sit and sip on. Overall an average pilsener for me. Better pils out there to be had for a beer still I don't go to very often."
"Drinkability: A solid pilsener and very sessionable. I certainly wouldn't mind having this one again. It's true to the style and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is a solid beer, good for sessioning, but isn't the best example of its style. This is a brew I wouldn't mind much having again, but isn't something I would seek out- only a step or two above average."
"Pours a clear, golden straw color with a three-finger head and quite a bit of visible carbonation. Really nice retention and quite a bit of lacing as it falls. The nose brings forward a bit of light grain character plus some mild continental hops. Mostly grain, however. Taste starts out with a bit of straw and grain husk. There is a bit of earthy bitterness there as well. Overall, not terribly complex and doesn't follow through too smoothly. Body is light with higher levels of carbonation, though certainly within the normal range of the style. Mild bitterness in the finish. Drinkability is pretty nice. Light flavor and good finish, though a bit too much grain in the taste."
" Superb , I will be thanking the freind who gave it to me , and now if I could only locate some myself...."
"It doesnt get any more refreshing that this, and even though it just snowed 6 inches today this has me dreaming of sitting in the summer sun. Clean and crisp with white pepper taste and hay. Mossy and slight alfalfa on the sides of my tounge. Lemon zest and fruity undertones round out the sharp spicyness. Bread and biscuits are very present and just a touch of soft wheat and maybe dare I say corn? Overall a very solid beer and glad that is a local for me."
"Drinkability: I would give this quite a high rating in this department -- the weight is very minimal, the alcohol is pretty modest as well at just over the 5% mark; the crisp and citric bitterness is wonderfully refreshing. Simple overall, but very solid."
"D: I'd love another, thank you."
"WTF. We're in Germany! Translation: a spot-on example of the style and a damn solid Pils."
"If you are a pilsner or lighter beer fan you should enjoy this one. Had this one in a bottle for the brewery and sure it would be even better on draft. This is a craft beer but this one was just one was just average+ for me. Stoudts does make some good beers, so give this one and some other by them a try."
"beautifully Drinkable hope I'm able to stumble across this one again ,soon!"
"Very drinkable and refreshing. This is yet another wonderful Pils produced in the keystone state."
"I had Stoudt's Pils on-tap at Sampan to go with some inspired izakaya grub. The clean, snappy bitterness and well-rounded pilsner malt was a good complement to fatty kobe beef sliders and korean bulgogi. The color was a pale straw with perfect carbonation providing a full white head. At $12/pitcher, this was a nice happy hour deal for an above average pils."
"Overall this is a well-made Pilsner but imo it doesn't stand out from the others like Victory's Prima Pils for example."
"There are a ton of pilsners on the market and many of them are simply bastardized, emasculated, poor excuses for the real thing; Stoudts Pils, however, offers anyone who can find it a taste of what made this flavourful, refreshing style so popular the world round in the first place. The American car industry might no longer compare to the German one, but in terms of pilsners, they've caught up (and may even have surpassed them)."
"It is a pretty solid plsener."
"Taste: Pale malt and floral hops as was described above in the smell. Bitterness is higher than I expected. Finishes kinda dry."
"Soudt's have crafted a memorable German style pilsner for sure. One of my new favorites."
"Clear gold with an inch of bright white foam coating the beer after the pour. Clingy, spotty lacing, good head retention. Clean malt aroma with grassy, slightly citrusy hops. Sturdy bitterness throughout with floral and grassy flavours, not much citrus, malty without being very sweet. Lingering hoppy bitterness. A little more than light bodied, crisp carbonation, light dryness. This is great stuff, highly drinkable and full of pils flavour. I'm glad I have another PA pils that I can get locally."
"D: Highly quaffable but slightly lower palatability. Overall, a nice representation of the style but not nearly as good as other locally available pilsners. No offense, but I won't be returning to the Stoudt's Pils."
"D: Highly, highly drinkable. Refreshing and flavorful--this beer is what a pilsner should be. Prost to Stoudt's for producing such a great beer!"
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. An easy drinking pils overall and one I would definitely have again."
"single from Whole Foods - Short Pump, Glen Allen, VA"
"D - Fantastic. Had this on a very hot summer day in NC (are there any other types down here?) and it was working it. Could drink these all day and will definitely pick up more of this to put it to that test....Highly recommended."
"Given this as an alternative, it will always be a mystery to me why anyone would ever drink macro swill."
"Pours bubbly, translucent orange with frothy white head on top. Subtle aroma full of floral notes, hops, wet grass, citrus, lemon zest. The taste caught me pleasantly by surprise: citrus, light fruit, fresh hops, floral, some light cereal, and oddly...marshmallow. Great creamy mouthfeel that goes perfectly with the flavors. Slight carb on the palate makes for good drinkin."
"A solid pils, has all the classic pils components with some american hoppiness, i think. Really enjoyed it."
"Relatively low carbonation and a finish that's definitely on the slicker side. I prefer a dryer finish for the style and that may have done the hops some justice in this brew. Still a solid brew that's certainly worth a try."
"Picked up a six pack of this brew at House of Brews in Clarksville, TN after hearing some hype about it. Fact is, I love the style and this beer does not disappoint -- starting with a frothy 3 inch head in my pint glass. Even before tasting it, I can detect spiciness from an aroma that hits me two feet away. Very refreshing after working a week in 90-degree plus heat and humidity. Lives up to the hype. Very satisfied. A very good brew."
"Pours a clear straw color with a one finger head which gives way to a little lacing. The aroma is of bread and grain malt with hints of lemon and grassy hops. The taste is of bread malts with pilsner malt as a backbone. There is grassy hops and citrus hops also present in the flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly low carbonation and is crisp and clean. The drinkability is good, for a pilsner it is very complex and has a great flavor."
"Large, frothy head, bleached white, mostly big, loosely knit bubbles, leaves a good deal of delicate lacing behind, moderate retention overall. Clear orange color, deeper in hue than expected with only slight yellowing at the outer reaches, transparent, few visible bubbles, certainly no beads. Hyper-crisp nose of rye, dark bread, quinine, lemon peel, celery, pepper, very little soft or giving, minimal apricot, peach, apple fruit scent presence. Full-bodied, even kind of heavy for its type, the carbonation churns steadily, if not for this it might paste itself to your tongue. All the tonic water, quinine, lemon peel, sourdough bread, pepper here too, crisp but not exactly refreshing as the weight is too much and there's no real lift off the palate. Pear, apple, peach fruit doled out meagerly. Pretzel salt and bitters finish things up. Stylistically, this does ape the German approach, however, it lacks the finesse and drinkability to be considered top notch."
"D: I am glad I found this and picked it up. Stoudt's has an excellent reputation for its German-styled lagers -- this one does not disappoint and would give any German-made pilsener a run for its money."
"Malts are crackery and not as grainy as many pilsners, still has some sweetness to it though. Hop flavors are more abound than actual bitterness. Saaz does not seem as prevalent in this beer as most German versions and has more of a clover honey feel to it. Quality brew...I wish there were more fresh, local pilsners down here."
"Overall a nice solid pils that ranks right up there with the ones I've had thus far... Very very nice.."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is lemon, pilsner malt and grassy hops. The flavor is spicy hops with medium bitterness. There is a nice malt backbone and some citrus notes. The flavor is also slightly metallic. Soft mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation."
"goes down pretty well. refreshing, and has some flavor."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent gold with a perfect, two inch bright white head that settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Delicate, cloud-like bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Noble hops aromas and a hint of skunk. Taste consistent with nose, but I also get a hint of caramel malt in the mix, as well as a little citrus acidity. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with an assertive carbonation; acidity slightly stimulates the salivary glands. Not my favorite pils, but very respectable and refreshing."
"D: This is definitely not my favorite style of beer, but been trying to find ones that I really like. So far, Victory Prima Pils has been tops, and I think this one belongs somewhere up there, too. Big fan and one I'll definitely get again."
"Light straw color, very clear, bright white head. Subtle pils malt aroma, a bit doughy. Pils malt, grain, and lemony hops. A touch of honey-toast sweetness. Hops are soft and lend a slight flowery hint along with lemon. Falls just short of being completely crisp in mouthfeel, still clean but slightly soft. Another great Pils from PA, although I like the Prima a little more."
"D: Guzzled the thing. It's a hot day and this really hit the spot. Very flavorful and refreshing at the same time."
"D: This is an above average beer, but I only wish they added enough hops to give it the right touch, and the perfect balance, to make this truly a favorite. A solid beer on any occasion."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"* After starting with Prima Pils first (see that review) for explanation. The Stoudt's seems to have a little more malt sweetness and a little less huskiness in the nose. This seems a little more ""refined"" in taste as well, a little sweeter, but only a little bit. Interestingly, the hops seem a little less sharp (more smooth) compared with the other day. This also seems to be less crisp/attenuated compared with the other day (moving the score from 4.5 to 4). Regardless, this is a great beer, anyone who likes Prima Pils should give this a try."
"D= refreshing, very drinkable with probably most anything, worthy of trying or maybe a session."
"Drinkability- this beer may actually be the cup of tea of some people and even at some point this may have very much been to my liking but the thing is its very one demensional now to me and over hopped but not in a good way, some german style american pilsners i have had i enjoy it but to me it really pulls back the drinkability due to the fact its just so bitter and lacking much else, not terrible but not something i would seek again"
"Bright clear gold in color with a finger of head. Retention and lacing are adaquate. Smells very fresh. Hops give off a nice inviting floral scent. Palate is nearly perfect. Herbal and floral hops compliment the malts beautifully. Finishes crisp, clean and bitter. Somewhat light in body with a dry mouthfeel. Simply put, this is a killer pilsner."
"D-great mouthfeel and easy to drink, decent flavors and a fair amount of balance especially for a pils, good attention to the hops."
"taste and finish are pretty dry. there is a little bit of zing there, as there should be with this style. a little grainy, a little peppery. not overly complex, but again- that's how it should be. it's the kind of beer that i could drink several of, and it makes me want to just enjoy it without trying to describe the flavor. i'll go do that now."
"Taste is very raw, sharp and hoppy. There's a distinct sulfur finish to it, really crisp and clean. It's clean and easy drinking and has a lot of flavor, I'd say it's right on par with Prima Pils"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly of malts, some notes of hops. Taste is crisp, a bit of hops, a touch of malts, not bad but nothing great. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"The aftertaste is that of a hop, not as strong as an IPA or EXB type of aftertaste but it is quite pleasant."
"Morey's Bottome Line: I think Stoudt's is a somewhat underrated brewery. They make quality beer, and this Pilsner is no exception. Prima Pils is the only better Pilsner that I can think of. Good stuff, and a great gateway beer."
"Overall, it seems sort of like pils-light to me...though not quite so boring. Drinkable because it feels on the light side while still having flavor. Perfect beer for a hot summer day."
"D - It's fresh without any off flavors. Could pair well with a number of foods. I'm starting to really appreciate the amount of great pilsners that my state offers."
"Really, really enjoyed this brew. I believe it instantly became my favorite German pils."
"D - Pretty good drinkability. I could go through these with ease, though it wouldn't be my first choice. Still, not bad."
"Easy drinking pils. Very good American rendition."
"This is an easy drinker by nature, but the balance and flavor profile make this top notch for the style."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a pale, , hazy gold with a sticky 2 finger white head. The nose is bready, grassy, ever so slightly sweet. The beer is light crisp and clean. The finish is dry, but it leaves a funny aftertaste. A solid, but not great pilsner."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer overall, but there are several others in the style that I would choose first."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. Well made beer, and easy drinking."
"Overall: This sits rather appropriately among the others in the case, and has some brilliant moments for its freshness and proximity to its drinking..."
"Pretty hop forward for the style with a very clean crisp medium body. Slightly bready yeast presence with a huge Pilsner malt backbone. The earthy grass and straw notes found in the aroma shine through nicely. Very well balanced with just enough hop bitterness without going overboard and overpowering the nice pilsner malt presence. Slight biscuit and graham cracker maltiness and slight crisp light fruit notes, mostly apple. Very quaffable tasty session beer. Perfect for the warmer months but good anytime."
"This is one of the best pilsners I've had.A nice light, refreshing, crisp, hoppy beverage for anytime of year or day of the week."
"d: A great local session option. When fresh, I could drink these all day."
"D- Try as I may, I just can't get ""into"" Pilsners in general. This beer is not bad, its just a pilsner.... go-hum."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear pale yellow color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Straw nose. Flavor is sweet straw that fades to grapefruit hops. Lingering hoppy aftertaste. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Drinkability - good session beer for the German pils fan."
"d- great, this is a go to pils for me, super refreshing, easily sessionable."
"Overall respectable decent drinking beer. Stoudt's does a fine job in holding true to the style."
"D - Easily drinkable pils."
"Drinkability is perfect - I can't imagine a more perfectly balanced or easier to drink pils with this much flavor. Possibly my favorite PA pils, and that's high praise."
"I could drink a couple of these, as long as I don't smell it first."
"This is a good pilsner, though it could have used a bit more sweetness and a little more nip from the spice. The odd flowery / herbal flavor I detected seemed out of place."
"An extremely drinkable pilsner I would gladly have it again"
"M/D - Light and certainly an easy drinker. Not my favorite style, but a good example of a simple German pilsner."
"D - A decent pilsner, the malt character is kind of weak and lacking in rich pilsner sweetness. The dryness in the finish is a bit excessive and borders on astringency, which hurts the drinkability."
"This is a good Northern German-style pilsener. It is very crisp and clean and quite refreshing. I recommend to anyone who is looking for a solid pilsner."
"m&d: light bodied, crisp mouthfeel. Very drinkable and def a session beer."
"Drinkability: After tasting several pils lately I find this one to be just average. This beer is very two note a weakish start followed by a bigger hoppy explosion. I could have one more, but I would just as soon turn to another pils."
"Crisp and dry and definitely a great session beer."
"T- Kind of a sour-bitter taste. Bad aftertaste. Really a poor attempt at a Pilsner. No distinguishing tasted. Limited all the way around."
"I'll be back for more of there, for sure."
"D: Perhaps the weakest of the 4 big PA pils (victory, slyfox, troegs, stoudt's)... but that really isn't a knock on this beer. Its a solid all-around pils, not as hoppy as victory prima and slyfox pikeland, not as refreshing as troegs. A deserving beer for a nice warm summer weekend."
"Who says pilseners can't be complex? I really enjoyed this one. They didn't overdo it with the hops, and all the elements come together nicely."
"On the box is stamped 4/14/08, which I assume is the date it was bottled. It is 6/22/09. On a hot PA summer day this beer is crisp and clean. Refreshing easy to drink even after a year in bottles. A moderate lacing and not overpowering aroma leads toward a light mouth feel. I could very easily finish a few more of these today."
"I'm getting an incredible mouthfeel from the one I poured, which is the main reason I scored drinkability high as well."
"D - this may have just become my go to summer beer!"
"Light, fairly smooth, crisp, dry and pretty easy to drink. The beer had good carbonation and overall this is a nice pils. I would definitely order again."
"D - Easy enough to drink but very uninspiring and certainly no threat to the Germans."
"I could drink a lot of these, but I don't think I'd want to. The fruit skin flavors aren't to my taste, and the hops don't particularly strike my fancy either. I can't knock it too hard, but not my choice for a pilsner"
"not overwhelming, but this has character and is very drinkable...think this would be a great candidate for a thai feast...or any curry dish"
"The brew was satisafactory."
"Overall a very nice pils."
"Note: Some months after writing this reveiw I had a chance to have one of these on tap at the brewery/restaurant. For this beer ""on tap"" is better."
"D- This is a tasty beer. The sulfur flavor is smooth and takes a back seat to the crisp fresh malts and smooth green hops. This is really a great beer and it improves and develops as it warms a bit."
"Not my favorite style of beer but this is an easy to drink refreshing beer to have on a hot summer day."
"From a 10oz bottle into a pilsener glass. Pale yellow color, completely see through, with a creamy foam and lacing down the sides. Smell is unimpressive - some of the hops come through but otherwise unremarkable. The taste, however, is exactly what a pils should taste like - clean, crisp, slight hop finish, but otherwise very smooth and refreshing. Very drinkable."
"it's nice and dry on the palate with flavors of lots of straw, earthy hops, pale malt, something softly fruity and a mild lemony-like sourness. the body is medium. carbonation is soft on the front palate but something happens to it as it develops on the tongue...there's no crispness. it just falls off, flat and dead... not a good quality in what is supposed to be a refreshing beer. 6/3/6/2/15/3.2"
"Notes- is there corn in this? Because it smells like corn to me. (edit: actually, as it warms over the course of the glass, the corn in the nose and aftertaste both go away)"
"Pours a clear gold with a good amount of white head. This pilsener has lot of aroma (I love it when a pils doesn't aim to be mediocre!): lots of honey, lots of granola-like malts, with faint grassy and lemony hops. If there is one word to describe this beer it is ""substantial."" There a lot of aroma, lot of flavor, and body that's bigger than expected. This is the best pilsener I've every had. Flavors of mixed grains, clover honey, floral and lemon peel bitterness. The body is medium at minimum, very mouth-filling. The next time I have sushi, this beer will be there."
"Great brew here. Lots of lacing down the glass and a sharp, tight, head on the pour. Smells almost like an IPA, very hoppy. Same taste too, what a great experience. Very creamy mouthfeel with nice munich malts and a good dash of hops. Great summer special but also remarkable anytime of year."
"I will definitely consider buying a case of just Pils. This bottle was part of the Stoudt's sampler"
"Thanks John.. very much appreciated.. this one was way better than I expected.. If Stoudt's can do a German Pils this well, then I am begging for more lagers!... How about a Maibock???"
"Clear yellow with a white head that leaves some bits of lace on the glass. Aromas of pale cracker malts, lemon zest, and clean flowery hops. Crisp noble hop bitterness and some sweet grain. Herbal and grassy. Light and drying with prickly carbonation. Nicely done and pretty authentic."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Mouthfeel is layered. Drinkability is soild."
"D - Light, refreshing, and thoroughly drinkable. I'll have to get my hands on a sixer of this next summer."
" This is a bit more clean and simple than it's famous counter=part the vicroty Prima Pils, i think the Prima has a bigger musty, wheat effect, The Stoudts version is cleaner and brewed closer to style. This is now my go-to Pilsner. sorry Prima!"
"Smooth, drinkable and flavorful. This is an excellent pilsener that is also sessionable. Definitely up there as one of my favorites of the style."
"D: Drinkability was very good. an all day quencher. A bright crisp carbonation and extremely clean flavor makes this a great example and try. Case worthy for a refreshing summer treat."
"Bitterness lingers making this less drinkable than other pilsners I have had. Pilsners are not in my top 5 styles."
"Excellent example of a German Pilsner and one of my favorites."
"Overall, a very nice, very drinkable pils."
"D- easy to put back. Very nice beer to pound back through the week."
"good, not great, drinkable in all situations not requiring complexity... like when talking to someone and you couldn't care less what they are saying ... its a genuine pils though... thats what my girlfriend's mother calls the birth control pill, 'are you on the pills?' she says, im sure its an uncomfortable conversation for her..."
"D: Very drinkable beer with a light characteristic to it to make it a very sessionable beer."
"A golden yellow color with bubblesof carbonation traveling up the glass. A two finger thick, white colored head, that laces slowly down the glass. A malty, bready frgrance and it finishing with a spicy, grassy hop aroma. The breadiness stands out in the flavor, with at touch of maltiness halfway. It all blends to a spicy, grassy flavor and finishes with a mild earthy flavor. A smooth and consistant mouthfeel, the carbonation cleanses the palate with dry, clean finish. A very drinkable beer, smooth and refreshing, this is a great summertime quencher."
"Victory Prima Pils was my go to German pils, but Stoudts takes the cake.Prosit!"
"T: Smooth, medium body with light carbonation but sharp hop bite. Body has a grainy, malty sweet flavor. Grassy, earthy hops appear in the finish and ends very clean and dry. Solid beer from Stoudts, not best pilsner, but nice session beer."
"D: Very drinkable, I'll be picking up more of this"
"Good pils, worth having. Not great though."
"Pours a golden color topped with a moderate head. Aroma is slightly fruity, wheaty, and grassy. The taste is slightly sweet and malty with citrus notes and a crisp, clean, hoppy finish. While it's not going to blow you away there is quite a bit of flavor in there, especially for the style. Very well balanced. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"D: At first I was put off by the hops but my pallet warmed as did the beer in time. A classic session beer for my tastes."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice foamy white two-finger head, with lots and lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very nice hop profile, and some spices. The taste is bitter, slightly sweet, malty, with some hoppyness, and a touch of spice. Light-medium body. Drinkable, a very nice German Pils."
"Drinkability is very solid, pleasantly surprised with this pilsner."
"D : A good pilsner from an American brewery. Well worth drinking."
"D - Great thirst quencher. Surprised I haven't reviewed this one yet. Certainly up there with its Pikeland and Sunshine counterparts. Solid effort from Stoudt's, providing me with a slight deviation from my usual Sunshine Pils."
"this is a very light, crisp beer thats very drinkable, but not too much on taste. id probably drink this before a macrobrew, but i wouldnt really seek it out."
"The mouthfeel is also good....nice carbonation that you can feel on your tongue. Not too watery...well made pilsner"
"In the end, this Pilsner is nice and crispy with a good average taste of toasted malts and floral hops. There's no denying that this would make an excellent choice for a summer session beer. If I was ever in the mood for another Pilsner, I would seriously consider buying this beer again."
"D - a very easy drinking, good tasting brew."
"M/D - Medium bodied, very clean. Crisp mouthfeel and excellent drinakbility. Pilsners certainly arent my style of choice, but this a a darn good one."
"Good session beer."
"It reminds me a lot of Bitburger, actually. It has that nice, bitter finish that I dig. Yeah, if this were distributed locally, I could see myself drinking a lot of this. I really like it."
"D - Refreshing, but more reminiscent of an IPA than a pilsner..."
"D: This is a pretty enjoyable beer, though I couldn't say exactly why. It's not overly complex, but it has an endearing quality to it."
"D - Another tasty German Pils from the East Coast that I can't get here in IL. If I am looking for a slightly maltier Pils this would be my choice."
"Other than Fat Dog Imperial Oatmeal Stout and Weizen, Stoudts has never bowled me over. Pils is a rock-solid version of the style and should be a great warm weather beer. And a cold weather beer. And a cool weather beer. And a rainy day beer. And a..."
"Good stuff..."
"Decent beer, not the favorite of their offerings."
"Easily drinkable, light bodied, well carbonated and all that. Surely a sessionable beer as you would expect."
"Pours a bright, clear, gold color in the pint glass. Pillowy white head quickly dissipated leaving behind lacing. Not too much in the nose, some piney hops and sweet malt. Taste is light with a hop bite in the beginning, ending with a bready malt flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and light. I suspect this would be a refreshing brew in the summer time."
"Eastern Pennsylvania seems to churn out some great pilsners. This ranks up there with Prima Pils and Pikeland Pils. Highly drinkable and flavorful. Recommended."
"Not quite as good as Prima Pils, but a highly-recommended brew."
"Pours a clear straw with no head. Nose is a bit metallic with a grain like attribute. The metallic character seems to come out stronger and stays. Feel is standard with a good bubble over the tongue. A good brew, I just think the metallic tone could go on vacation."
"A good brew! Hear hear!"
"Flavor of crisp biter hops mixed with biscuity malt. Crisp, clean, and bitter. I could drink many of these."
"This arrived with a big, foamy, bone-white head which eventually produced great lacing throughout. The color was a straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. There was a mild nose of Saaz hops. The mouthfeel was thin, but the hops were definitely evident on the palate. The finish was beautifully dry and lingering with that special tang that Saaz imparts. 'Tor Lew keeps hyping session beers and I'll concede a well-made Pils every time. Highly recommended."
"Excellent take on a style that needs more attention."
"$8.99 per six-pack"
"Bright, golden color. Slight foamy head on top. A little less head this puppy could pass for a macro! Slight malty and somewhat sulfury aroma. Crisp, clean hop bite in the flavor. Touch of malt. Slight citrus notes. Moderate mouthfeel. Quite enjoyable beer. Great for a warm summers day or an early October afternoon as is the case here. Well done."
"I am always pleased to see a brewery highlight a pilsner in their line of flagship beers. A true, quality pilsner can be difficult to find among micro-breweries. This is one to seek out."
"Drinkability - Another winner from Stoudts, nice to have a change from the raw power of their ""Big Beers"" to one a bit more clean and refined. Very satisfied with this brew, and I'd definetly grab another if I was out, I can see why it made the Top 25 Micros list on AskMen."
"Straw yellow, chamagne bubbles soar gloriously to the top. Very respectable head. Smell is oddly corny, but enough Saaz to keep it interesting. Taste is much better, with a nice fresh malt & soaring hops. Mouthfeel is refreshingly crisp and dry at the finish. Prima Pils it ain't, but this is perfectly drinkable."
"Feels light but with an unusual bitter bite. Leaves a film on the *roof* of the mouth. Somewhat bubbly. Overall it's bitter, malty, with dry (as opposed to wet) hops, wheat and a bubbly feel."
"D: Not a bad session brew, you can easily put back four or five."
"Pours a golden yellow with a white head. Aroma is a European saaz hop, which is a bit larger than anticipated. In the taste, a small hop taste, yet quite dry. A aftertaste of a hop presence and a bit dry. A nice pilsner with a nice hop charicteristic. A nice representation of style."
"The bitterness somewhat limits the drinkability, so having several of these in a row would be a bit too much to handle for most people. Stoudt's Pils isn't the best I've ever had (that honor goes to Troegs' Sunshine Pils) but it definitely takes a strong #2 position."
"Pours a crystal clear light golden hue with a one finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is decent with some lacing here and there. Smell is a powerful burst of flowers, honey, and spice. A lot more in the nose than I had expected. Taste is a light lemongrass flavor blended with some malt sweetness. Finish is quite bitter, much more dry than I had anticipated. Mouthfeel is very light with a good amount of carbonation. Good representation of the style. Drinkability is pretty good, bitter aftertaste takes away from it a bit though. Give it a try if you have the chance."
"Maybe the keg was old, but this beer was just not right. The malt was too mellow and the hops were too harsh. If it weren't for the rough hops, the malt profile would be just smooth and slightly bready. But the grassy and spicy hops (which I normally adore) were way off."
"I really dig this beer. Probably one of the best domestic pilsners I've yet to have. Enjoyable."
"Not bad overall, I could drink a few of these. Hard to find a lower ABV beer with this much flavor and bitterness. Possibly a good summer session brew..."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light in body with mild carbonation. I could drink this one all night. A great American made pilsner!"
"This is a very full-flavored and hoppy lager that is quite refreshing. It's a beer to seek out."
"Overall, easy to drink, but not impressive. Decent pils."
"Poured a radiant, crystal-clear golden hue with plenty of bubbles racing to the surface. Big, billowing white head with excellent retention. Faint but pleasant aroma of grass, citrus and hops. For taste, the front is sweet, tangy, citrusy malts with a dry, hoppy (but not bitter) finish that makes you thirsty for more right away. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and smooth. It's exceptionally drinkable -- especially on a hot day. Very enjoyable on the deck with a big grilled chicken salad."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden yellow color with a nice white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the sides of the glass. The aroma is fresh grain and some spicy and herbal hops. The taste is grainy malt with a dry spicy hop finish. Overall, this is a very nice and flavorful pils that I will certainly turn to again. Recommended."
"Don't drink and review."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. Couldn't get too aggressive with the pour b/c it has some major head on it. Nice gold, perfect clarity, big puffy white head. Smell is kind of bland with some metallic scent and a mild floral hop character to it. Taste is rather bland, could hardly make out any distinct flavors. I probably won't drink many more of these in my life. I have enjoyed some Stoudt's brews in the past, but this is definitely the least exciting from this brewer that i've had."
"Eric"
"This is a great beer. Sweet, grassy and floral aromas with a light, foamy head and heavy lacing on the glass. Really crisp, clean hop and floral taste with just a slight bit of bitter, grass taste that makes the beer full tasting while the above average carbonation makes it very drinkable. This is like a great tasting, interesting beer that you could use as a session beer if you were so inclined, as I was over the weekend. While I had this beer initially on tap at the Standard Tap in the Northern Liberties neighborhood in Philadelphia, I subsequently enjoyed a case of it with some friends and it was as good as on tap. Probably the best pilsner I've had."
"Now if only the weather would cooperate..."
"Enjoyable beer from Stoudt's...I'm won over."
"Poured into a pint glass, has a very pretty yellow appearance with a bit of bubbly carbonation and a head that leaves a wee bit of lace on the glass. Smell is very weedy with hints of sweet grass, reminds me of summer. Taste is very tarty and lemony, very good and smooth, this goes down so well I had a couple in a 10 min span. Very good for a hard days work outside to quench your thirst."
"you could session all night."
"Served in a pilsener flute. Slightly hazy, very pale gold. Thick mountain of pure white head leaves crusty lace sticking to the glass. Very finely bubbled. Mellow, refined aroma. Softer pilsy malt has a nice crackery, grassy aroma, bolstered by floral german hopping. Nice and clean. Good balance to the flavor, bready, cracker-like malt sweetness taken up by a prominent hop finish. Clean and lagery smooth, with vibrant carbonation. Medium full bodied. Simple, elegant flavors and an overall good presentation. Very drinkable, begging for another glass. I could stand it to be a little clearer, but not at the expense of over filtering."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Appearance isn't too exciting to me, rather clear and almost flourescent lookind when placed in front of the light, decent foamy head. The taste is a pretty average pilsner flavor, not very exciting for my taste. Mouthfeel isn't too bad, fairly smooth going down. I can see myself drinking a few of these beers if I had no good alternatives. Definately better than the average boring macro pilsner though."
"Stoudt's Pils is fairly highly carbonated in the bottle, leading to a possible ""foam snake"" incident if one does not let the bottle rest after its ride from horizontal in the vegetable crisper to vertical and uncapped on the counter. A bit of sharpness hits initially thanks to those German bittering hops, but that folds into the slightly sweet, raw-grain taste that follows. It's a bit on the thin side, even for a pilsner, and it retains its fizziness the whole glass. That initial hop buzz reappears somewhat as I swallow, helping the beer finish clean but not without a trace."
"This would be a very drinkable summer brew."
"a fine fine beer that i will certainly put into regular rotation."
"A very pleasing beer,would reccomend this beer. I going to have to pick up a case of this beer this summer,would be great out on the deck."
"Poured cloudy gold with thin head and thin spotty lacing. Smell of hops. Taste is sweet at fist then pretty bitter. head remains throughout. Almoust a sour feel to the mouth, not very pleasant. This Beer wasn't too impressive, not something i would get again."
"The body is thin, but has a nice crisp carbonation. Very easy to drink. Quite an exceptional pils."
"I like pilsner beers. I've been to Germany several times and the pilsner lager there is great, refreshing and crisp. I love it when I can find a great example of a German pilsner here in the US made by a US micro. I also love it when an American micro can take a beer like a German pils and make it better. That is what I think Stoudt's has done here. The beer pours a very pale yellow with and ever so slight haze. It's so pale it is almost florescent. But don't let the color fool you. This is no light beer. It is medium to light bodied and full flavored. Aroma is spot on, bursting with grassy noble hops and yeasty bread. Bitterness is higher than the average pils,and that is a great thing. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. This and Prima Pils by Victory are great American pilsner beers. Go get some if you can."
"Although I am not a great fan of pilseners, this is a great example in the US. It was perfect in color and had a nice head on it. The hops were flowery, but not overpowering. The beer has a fresh flavor, and a nice dry aftertaste. This beer can be enjoyed all day long."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking beer. This is what Bud could and should be like."
"There is enough refreshing smoothness and a nice taste to make this a fine ""session"" brew."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a giant white foamy head. The lacing is good,but the color for this pilsner is very good. The smell is light with ""bisquity"" aromas along with sweet malt and some floral hints. The taste has a bitter hop blast then ""bisquity",sweet malt, and earthy floral flavors. The m/f is light with all flavors mixing well. An excellant pilsner almost on par with Victory's. This could be an everyday beer."
"Pours such a light gold that I'm going to call it yellow. Little head that disappears quickly. The appearance of this isn't that far off from a macro. The nose, however, is beautiful: fresh, green hops that combine saaz and pine in a Bohemian/American combo. Very earthy, but not funky. Sharp and floral while still being inviting. Great nose. The palate is a disappointment, though. Sweetness first off, followed by juicy carbonation and then a crash of bitter hops. The aftertaste is sharply bitter -- way too much for a style that should be soft and drinkable. Overall, this was a disappointment for me. The nose hinted at great things to come, but the palate seemed disjointed and not soft enough for the style."
"Drinkability: A nice american pils in the german style. Quite Drinkable."
"A little darker than some other Pils-style beers I've had. Very fruity, orange and cherry flavors. I detected a little bit of spice as well. A pretty hefty offering for this style, drinkabilty was hurt by it being ""heavy""."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, thick white head settles down into a pretty thick layer, nice lacing. Smell is sweet, fruity, nice floral/citrus hops, wow, smells very nice. Taste is sweet caramel up front, malty, floral/pine, some citrus, very clean piney bitterness in the finish, although slightly weak. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very refreshing, maybe my favourite pils."
"Very good,I was looking forward to a Pilsner and this one is very good for the style.Im glad I bought it.Kudos to Stoudts for making this fine brew."
"The drinkability is good, Could be a bit more crisp. Prosit, MK"
"Clear, bright, golden yellow with a pillow of powdery white head. Saaz hop aroma of sea air funk over light fruit, citrus, and biscuit malt. Nice. Fresh, spicy, Saazish hop bitterness right up front. Juicy honey malts burst forth, with careful sweetness. Crisp, toasted and bitter and floral and peppery hop bite takes over. Moderate body coats the mouth well. Superbly done!"
"I poured this into a tall, slender glass I got from a cafe in Bonn, Germany. I let it go in a bit too hard and got a whole hand's worth of white head. The liquid was translucent with a straw yellow color. All the head laced nicely. It had a dry, lemony aroma. The taste was considerably sour and bitter - too much so. I know I opened this before the date on the bottle, so I'm assuming that it's not gone bad, but this is weird. The bitterness lingers considerably. I can't find any sweetness to offset the bitter. After some time passes, it begins to improve some. It's It feels OK in the mouth, except for the aftertaste. I've enjoyed all of Stoudt's other products, and unless I'm just missing something on the pilsener style, this isn't much fun. Maybe all that head was a sign of a problem. Darn."
"Drinkability: This would be a good summer beer for those days by the pool."
"D: The pils is very drinkable, an excellent representative of the style."
"D - I wouldn't put it on the same shelf as Victory Prima Pils...this is a good starter pilsener. Refreshing, nonetheless, and I'd pick up another one if in the Adamstown area."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, straw yellow color with a bit of a head on it. It dropss off rather quickly to leave some lacing. The aroma is nice, with notes of malts, citrus and floral notes. Definitely a bit of bitterness to the taste. A medium malt body backing ot up. A somewhat dry finish. Not a bad pils at all."
"Hell yes. This is one wonderful pils."
"The beer pours a light yellow body that has ever present carbonation, with a white head that crowns it leaving nice lacing. The smell and taste where at first very floral hoppy but it also had a very nice malt backbone. It's as complex as a lager can be. the beer was a very refreshing drink that finished extremely dry. One of my new lawn mowing beers."
"This pils had multi-level bitterness. Just as it started to fade, it pushed forward again. It nearly overpowered all the other flavors at times. I think I'll have to revisit this Stoudt's brew."
"Pours clear and straw-colored with a huge foamy head that dissipates to a thin lace. Big floral nose, also a bit of corn and spice. Hops jump out at you on the tongue, with a bit of spice and a lot of hoppy bitterness, with a lingering bitterness that stays long on the palate. This is an easy drinking and enjoyable Pils."
"Drinkability  This is one of the few truly drinkable examples of a German Pilsner Ive had made here in the US. Well done, Stoudts!"
"D - For the style it is on target....but just a little off. Of course, this is my opinion."
"As for drinkability, this beer is great. I tasted it after one of the hottest days of the year and it was perfect. Refreshing, may be too hoppy for some, but could easily be a saturday afternoon drinking beer."
"Pours a greenish? yellow hue, not ultra pale or clear around the edges, though. Holds a thick head that I have to let settle due to intense carbonation. Smells resinous and spicy, mostly of hops, but not intimidatingly so. Taste is again ultra hoppy, fairly good hop profile, tastes salty, the malt being overshadowed all around. Resinous and this is what lasts on the tongue. In the same flavor profile as Prima Pils... Mouthfeel is light in a pils way--not water--so good in this regard, but it's so carbonated, it's just overkill. Drinkability wise, it's too hoppy to apreciate the other things going on here. I'm saddened by the reoccuring need for beers to be extreme or take a mellow but flavorful style like a pilsner and try and make it what it's not. The name of the good brewing game is balance, and this does not achieve it. But if your a hopehead, this or Prima Pils are the kind of pils you may shoot for as they will blast you with a different style of not-too-malty hop water for your apreciation of all the varieties of hops. For me, no thanks."
"12 oz. bottle. Perfectly clear, straw yellow in color with a great big head. The smell was of malt and flowery hops, light DMS. The taste was primarily driven by the hops, which provided good bittering. Malt was definately taking a back seat. Body was light, carbonation was moderate, and it was fairly drying. A very drinkable beer, crisp and refreshing."
"This was an enjoyable pils, a style which I've never really gotten all too crazed about. It's simple, to the point and well crafted and tasty. Try it."
"Very hoppy aroma and taste. Excellent appearance on the pour, almost clear yellow, with a frothy whire head and good lacing. I could not detect much flavor outside the heavy hops. This actually grew on me after a couple, but my beer is how I rated it. An okay-good, middle of the road pilsner."
"d: Too bitter for my tastes, but does goes down easy."
"Assertive, but herbal, hop aroma with some hay and very mild orange peel notes. Color is light yellow and the body holds a fluffy white, two finger thick head that diminishes slowly. Fore is grainy tasting and has grapefruit accented hop notes. Very clean middle and finish leaves grapefruit and floral hop flavors lingering on the tongue. The malt base is noticeable, but the hops are running the show flavor wise."
"I have passed this one up many times for no good reason. The summer solstice has visited upon us again, and pilsners sound so delightful. This one displays a nice golden hue. A head as white as the driven snow frothed up off the pour and fell into nothingness with only a ring left in its memory. Lacing is minimal. The beer is nicely carbonated with bubbles of different sizes that go bludgeoning upward. The smell is sharp with nobility. A bit of corn impression and peppery spiciness comes to mind. Herbal and dry grass tones spring forth as well. The flavour is very tasteful. It is utterly pleasant and appealing without so much as a challenge to the palate. It has great hop bite. It tends to be dry but wet enough to be greatly refreshing which was exactly what I was looking for in this beer. The mouthfeel is light and tingly. It is superb from a drinkability standpoint. I am compelled to go to the fridge repeatedly and grasp yet another bottle but alas, my stash is nearly depleted now. This is an easy recommendation. I only wish I had delved into this beer's splendor in a more timely fashion. Nice work."
"This one has won numerous awards, well deserved. Wish I didn't know that when I tasted it. My Czech friend concurs though, it's very good for an American brewed pils."
"Tastes grassy with a strong presence if noble hops. Herbal and strong. Tasty. Crisp mouth, some light aftertaste of sour malt and noble hops. Good drinker. Nice summer beer. A new fave."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: this one is highly drinkable, especially for the summer or with BBQ. You won't get bored with the flavors, but it won't bog you down. Very sessionable."
"Not totally blown away by this beer but it's a solid brew...it could easily be my ""budwiser"" just a solid pilsner that is easy to drink"
"Poured into a pilsner glass a light straw color with a nice fluffy white head that stuck like glue as it settled,very German in the nose toasted grain and mineral qualities with a touch herbalness saaz maybe?Very dry pils here dry toasted malt underneath a dry,somewhat herbal hop profile I do notice a s I drink more a freshly baked bread elemeant to it that adds to its subtle complexities of malt vs hop.A damn fine pilsner one of the better to come my way in a while for sure."
"Drinkability: Eminently drinkable; especially well-flavored, light, and welcoming. Great sessioner; excellent depth in flavor profile. A fine job."
"Very drinkable, very enjoyable, and you better believe from now on I'll be watching Stoudt's more closely to see what other suprises they have waiting in the wings."
"This is an extremely clean and refeshing beer. While isn't anything in the way of off flavors, the flavor is pretty mellow. There is a little bit of lemon citrus and grassiness that combines with a mild malt sweetness. The hop bite comes through at the end. The body is on the full side for a pilsner, but it is extremely drinkable due to how clean it is going down."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, more of an American take on a pilsner, using noble aroma hops but untraditional bittering hops"
"drinkability: WOW. i dont know if i got a good bottle or what....im so impressed with this one. ive never seen a pilsner like this"
"Drinkability: Yes, I enjoyed it. At work, even! A tasty pilsner from Stoudt's."
"A solid Pils, although the bitterness is a touch too much for me, and I would like to have more aroma hops. A competitor to Victory Prima Pils for authenticity, but not as drinkable. I like the slightly sweeter Pils akin to Steinlager."
"I very much like German Pils and am glad to see more and more craft adaptations. Very enjoyable - much like Samuel Adams and Saranacs' Golden Pils."
"Up there with Sunshine and Prima for great hoppy style pilsners, strong yet refreshing, it poured into the glass with a strong yellow color and a decent sized fizzy head. Hoppy in all the right places, not overbearing and perhaps lacking the sheer power of Prima but still perfectly balanced and refreshing and a great choice for any pils fan in any weather."
"Undated bottle poured into a pint glass, pale crystal clear straw yellow with a thin white cap of head that sticks around for a while and leave some scattered lacing. Aroma is nice and malty overlaid with fairly spicey hops. Taste is a nice slightly sweet malt, a bit of fruitiness, with a nice dry finish with some spicey lingering hop bitterness. This is a really good pilsner, right up there with the other great examples from PA--the Prima and the Sunshine."
"Be underwhelmed if you must... I like the stuff."
"New arrival at my local package store, in a six pack of 12 oz. brown bottles featuring hops on the label. To see the flowers of the Humulus Lupulus vine always a good sign to me. The beer looked appropriately pale and very clear. The clarity proved a showcase of the highly bubbly nature of the beer, which produced a foamy white head that was bigger than typical for a Pils at nearly two fingers thick. The aroma was that of restrained, spicy, noble hops, and the sweet honey like Pilsner malt with just a touch of vegetal DMS. The taste was clean and balanced with sweet malt with a hint of corn just edging out the hops. Due to the lack of bitterness this one wasnt quite flawlessly crisp, but was flavorful enough to overlook the bit of muddiness. The beer felt quite full in the mouth considering the style, and a spicy aftertaste. I would pick this any day of the week over the swill being foisted on the uneducated public, but there are other better microbrewed Pilsners out there."
"Overall- an easily drinkable Pilsner with a light, enjoyable flavor. Just a little too weak/ watery for me. I don't drink Pilsner's but this is a good 1 for those of you who do!"
"Being wet and no trouble down the throat is the order of the day and Stoudt's Pils fills the bill."
"This is one of the palest colored beers I ever have seen. I think friggin Bud light has more color. However the lacing raised the appearance up a bit as it was quite plentiful from the well reataining head. Nice malty aroma, inviting. Good balance of malt and hops made this one enjoyable beer. If it was available in this area mighjt be the Pils-Lager of choice for the dog days of summer. Not a bad beer at all. Thanks to Rkhaze for the sample."
"Goes down quite smooth. Lots of ""rechargeability"" so there's nothing to get sick of and there's always some taste left in it. Crisp, refreshing, and lots of hop taste."
"A delightful and drinkable Pils, thank you Kevin for sharing this one with me. Pours a crystal clear pale straw with a delightful white head that leaves scant lacing. Head lasts til the last of the brew is consumed. Aroma of floral hops, ripe fruit and doughy malt. Taste is spicy hops, scant pale malts and a ;ong sharp dry finish with just enough bitternes sto make it ever so interesting. a nice counterpoint to Randy Newman's Baltimore with the Eagles on Background."
"This is a nice refreshing pils and makes for a great session beer. The grape taste sets it apart and makes it a unique offering in this style."
"Im not a pilsner fan, but this is a quality brew."
"(Drunk with good conversation at Grace's Tavern in Philly)"
"Overall: A very nice pils, and one that I'll be drinking again."
"Not quite on par with Victory Prima Pils but a good representation nonetheless."
"poured a slightly hazy yellow color with monstrous white puffy head. Smell is spice, piney and hoppy.Very enjoyable. Taste is a great mixture of crispness, sweetness, hoppy bitterness. Many floral notes also present. Finishes dry and with a bite. Nice sweet malt also to be found. Very good complex beer that brings many different textures together to form an above average drink."
"Straw yellow with a bit of head. Floral saaz hops. Dry bitter leaf, with some offset malting. Some lemon, more fruity than prima but not as delicate. Finishes bitter and dry. Well carbonated. Fresh, best before June 2006. Good with fish. Bold medium mouthfeel."
"I would recommend getting a sixer of this brew. It grew on me over time. My first reaction was ""this is gobble material for a party"". After completing my last sample on tap at Naja's in redondo beach this has moved up to possibly in the esteemed Sunday Football status..."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a highly underrated pilsener that really should be recognized more. One of the best American examples of the style. Clean, and pure. I think I'll have another."
"Overall: Not bad, cost $1.69 for the pleasure of the single. Not sure I would pick up a 6-Pack of these, but I wouldnt pass one up if it was passing by."
"Overall not a bad beer."
"I haven't reviewed too many German Pilsners, so I don't have that much to go by, but, damn! this is tasty. You could drink this an entire Sunday watching football and still go back for another. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - Strong bitterness that doesn't linger leads for great food pairing. I had this with garlic pepper pork. Very good. The refreshing nature makes it go down easy."
"Overall, a light refreshing pilsner that reminded me more of an adjunct rather than a craft brew."
"Mouthfeel is bubbley and a bit chewy, and overall, very drinkable- extremely refreshing and tasty. Goes down easy, and terribly tempting to grab another."
"Bought a bottle of this last week, looks to have a best buy date of 8/22/05, very nice. Pour is a light golden, the head was of the beaten egg white quality and did a good job of sticking around. This beer was kind of a mixed bag for me, I popped it open while I started cooking, so I took sips every five minutes or so while I had a moment. Each sip was different. The first actually had a bit of a sour quality, and I thought, please get better soon. Actually, it's still evident 30 minutes later. There are some more pleasant things going on: it is pretty citrusy in the finish. I actually find it bit sweet too. Sitting here drinking this one in front of the computer, I have to say it's a bit of a mish-mash. I guess I need to get another bottle and see if there is a change for a better drinking experience."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a nice 1 inch white head. Left nice lacing on the glass. Nice steady flow of bubbles gives it a nice lively appearance. Smell is mostly of malt with a very mild hops smell. Taste the same with the hops bitterness showing up at the finish. Even though it appeared to have strong carbonation there was little of the carbonation feal on the tongue. Very smooth and clean finish. A very drinkable beer. This would be a good one to try on your macro loving friends."
"This Pils pours a light straw color with about an inch of snowy head. It has evident hoppiness in the nose which sets it up well. I drank one while hot and thirsty and it went down easily with a slight bite, though mostly clean. Easy to have another. The malt was just bit thin to me, although the mouthfeel was crisp. Nice summer beer for sure."
"Although this is lighter than the usual microbrew fare, this is an excellent, flavorful beer. Too good to be called a lawn mower beer, yet it would be an awesome choice after the chores are complete."
"Lots of carbonation activity going on, but not apparent in the mouthfeel. The smell and taste both have a little more hops than I was expecting. The hops are more of the grapefruit variety than the pine variety. Aftertaste is all grapefruit bitterness. I am drinking this beer at a warmer than normal temp, which I suspect accounts fof the stronger than average hop factor. Enjoyable brew."
"Pours a clear golden color. Lots of tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Thick white fluffy head, with decent retention. Pale bready malt aroma, grassy, sulfur and slightly skunky. Bready malt flavor, dry on the palate. Nice amount of bitterness. Grassy hop flavor. Light body, crisp, high carbonation. Better than average. Good drinkability. Not exciting, but pretty good."
"I sampled a 12 ounce bottle, poured light straw, with a medium bubble white head, minor lacing observed. Nose is the expected and hoped for grassy saaz hop type stuff. Crisp, cleansing and clean tasting Pilsner. Nice take on the style , well worth enjoying a bottle or two, went nicely with some cheese, crackers and salad."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a brilliantly clear pale straw color with an eggshell colored head. Some wafts of grassy hops and some pale malt sweetness in the aroma and a mineral, watery background. Crisp and cleansing on the palate. The way a good German-style Pils (Jever in my book) should be, it has a good balance of bitterness to sweetness. It is very neutral; yet flavorful. A very nice U.S.-brewed version of a Euro-Pils. Fundamental and drinkable."
"I had written Stoudt's off, but their new line up and tweaking has produced two great beers. This one and the sublime Double IPA"
"Brilliant yellow under a drift of fat-bubbled foam. Aromas of citrus drizzled scones and wet matchsticks. So easy and soft this beer, a gorgeous mingling of toast lightly lathered with apricot jam and river stones. I could drink this all day then crack one at sundown to celebrate my day of drinking. A fine American Pils that should be available everywhere. Like iron filings to my electromagnetic lips."
"Flavor is balanced and assertive--slighty sweet malty notes work in harmony with a tangy citrus hop flavor, and a hop finish that's sharp but not big. Mouthfeel is thin and refreshing. The hopping is more likely to make you think of California beers than the Budweis, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. A nice summer refresher."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing at the start. The finish was clean and crisp. This is extremely drinkable as the flavor and refreshing crisp quality makes your tastebuds very happy."
"Mild spicy hop aroma. Foamy, brilliant white colored head fed by dozens of streams of medium sized bubbles. A few strings of lace sit atop the clear, pale yellow colored beer. Light malt flavor is quickly overtaken by a solid bitter bite. A light sweetness makes its way in towards the end cutting the bitterness before all the flavor fades fast in the fairly dry finish. Light bodies beer, easy drinking, the bitterness goes away after a 1/4 beer or so."
"Good, medium, soft carbonation. I liked the hop presence alot in this pils. A well-made version of a standard."
"Bottle label is different then the picture currently on the BA website.it now has a painted picture of the Stoudts Brewing Company with hops and barley around it. BB date stamp is smeared on the bottle but starts w/ 11/17/ probably 04 because I think they just started putting these is bottles somewhat recently. Appearance: Pours a pale golden color, slightly hazed body and the head is bright white in color Aroma: Nice noble halletau hops and a crisp pale malt aromas. Taste: Very good German style pilsener with floral and herbal hops and there is a very light biscuity malt presence that bring a nice sweetnessvery refreshing pils. Very crisp and refreshing offering by Stoudts."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a clean pale malt and Czech hop scent. It is a bit grainy, but good. The taste is good. It has a grainy pale malt flavor with excellent hop notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine pilsner. It's simple in it's approach, but it has all the elements of a quality brew."
"The aroma was surprisingly hoppy - fresh cut alfalfa - a surprising hop characteristic from a pils, but definitely welcome. The taste followed with the same dominant green hop flavor, but didn't prevent the clean and crisp pils malt flavor from reaching the palate. It had a great taste, but the accumulation of bitterness was somewhat significant. Maybe a bit too much hop?"
"Final Thought: These beers still taste much better on tap, but the bottled beer still tastes great! Complements to Ed Stoudt..."
"Appearance: Pale golden slightly hazed body paired with bright white nice sized head dwindles slowly leaving specks of lacing. Aroma: Nice noble hop bouquet Tettanag and Halletau paired with a crisp pale malt sweetness very nice biscuit malt presence to note as well. Taste: Very good German style pils floral and herbal hops with the slight biscuit toned malts blend into one insanely refreshing pils. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied crisp mouthfeel carbonation was a bit high but didn't hurt drinkability. Drinkability: Nice easy going flavorful lager pairs nicely with food glad to see Stoudt's finally deliver this offering in bottles."
"Poured from the pint bottle a clear golden with light white head that settled down to a nice little ring. (bought from Stoudts) Scents of champagne, white grapes, maybe a little honey... very nice. Lots of carbination hits your tongue right away with a slight bite. Very light moutfeel, very thin but not watery. Slight citrus, little bit of grapefruit, chardonnay... Decent beer, little light for me though.Very drinkable."
"I really wanted to love this beer. Great pilsners are tough to make and therefore quite rare on the micro scene. IMHO, this one started off good but quickly showed it's flaws."
"This pils poured a clear, golden-yellow color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass a little. The smell was modest but clean with a faint aroma of malt. The taste was malty and floral with some grain flavors. The hop bitterness was low. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation feel. The flavor (both malt and floral hops) lingered nicely. This was a nice, lighter bodied pils."
"Straw yellow colored with a slight protein haze in the pint glass. Frothy white thick lasting head. Not much nose just a little clean malt in the sinus. Crisp tangy flavor dominates the mouth. Crisp solid hop presence. There is also some lingering sweetness to the finish. Quite lite and drinkable... a beer you could easily have a few of... gret with food."
"The flavor is well-balanced between a semi-rich maltiness and lush hop flavors; and it's distinctly bitter but not overwhelming. It finishes dry and refreshing with some short-lingering malt and gently bitter hops. Crisp, clean,and full of flavor - this is one well-brewed and highly drinkable German-style pils!"
"This beer poured crystal clear and well carbonated. It was the color of hay that glistened in the sun. It produced a fluffy cloud like head that was pure white in color and thick, full and sticky. The lace that was produced was the same color and very plentiful, sticky and lasted to ¾ glass. The aromas were mostly of 2 kinds of hops: Czechoslovakian and Saaz. These hops produced a light fruit and flowery aroma all through out the bottle and glass, but as it warmed, a hint of sweet malt did rise and become noticeable. The tastes were very much like the aroma: Czechoslovakian and Saaz hops ruled, but other flavors did arise. Light tastes of grass, malt, grains and spice also were noticeable. It finished with a dry hop flower taste on the tongue that was noticeable even when I exhaled. It was light bodied. A fairly dry beer that was crisp and clean. Not overly hoped but enough to satisfy. Good balance of flavors to represent the style. Quenched my thirst and satisfied me."
"The Pils pours a brassy gold with a fine white head, choice Saaz hop aroma blowing off it like clouds on a mountian. Brisk, almost fruity, softly malty, evenly hoppy, but at no place overwhelming, this is all-day beer. The only place the hops show their edge is in the long, relentless finish that is a moderate, pleasant bitterness. Quite soft and unassuming up front, it gains interest as it goes in classic Bohemian pils style, like a stream down a mountain."
"Classic yellow gold, fluffy two-finger head, excellent lacing. Lots of fresh hay/grass in nose. Taste is crisp, hoppy. A sturdy malt backbone behind a wall of hops, with a slight lemon twang. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full. Nice mild hoppy aftertaste. A solid pils, refreshing not only in summer, but anytime."
"Light straw in color. Lazy floating bubbles with moderate head and lace. Light in aroma, but some trases of floral hops.  Taste is smooth and tangy with ample hop flavor. Malt makes a slight secondary appearance. Rich and flavorful and easy drinking on a hot summer evening."
