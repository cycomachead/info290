"The flavor almost comes across as syrupy in its grainy and grassy character. Maybe that was the texture but I just seemed juicy. I'd drink it again on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink.  Has that hoppy taste but not overwhelming"
""
"Must try!"
""
""
"Hard to find, But this is an amazing, excellent beer! I got it in a restaurant, haven't tried it in a bottle yet."
"I like crystal clear pilsners.  This one was oddly cloudy.  Taste fairly generic.  Not bad."
""
""
"A nice clear, no haze, straw color. Clean crisp taste with hints of sweetness. Good dry finish that rolls off the palate. Head is a bright white and the aroma has notes of noble hops like a good pilsener should. Fantastic carbonation."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the most flavorful Pilsner, but balanced, crisp and satisfying (especially after a 5K run when consumed)."
""
"Was not overly impressed with this pilsner as compared to its German and Czech counterparts. It lacks the kick and complexity of the European Pilsners. However, midway through drinking, the addition of guacamole and chips improved the taste significantly. By itself this is not an exceptional beer but under the right circumstances (ie. with a spicy meal or on a hot summer day) can be refreshing."
""
"An all-star example. Bravo Brooklyn."
"3 months past bb date. The slight skunk of pilsner malt is accompanied by light sweetness and floral hops. Malt dominates. Flavor reveals crackery malt at the base, with sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. The finish ends up being fairly crisp and lightly bitter. There's an underlying tang that is offputting."

"One of the best pilsner beers I've had. Unique in flavor and supreme drinkability. I haven't seen a six pack of this yet, but when I do, I will definitely get it."

"Nice golden pils appearance with good lacing but not perfectly clear. Neutral in the nose; no marked malt or hop coming through. Seemed a bit light for the style and I was really looking for the perfect balanced crispness you get with a world class pils but it was not there."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent German Pilsner with hoppiness not often enjoyed in this style."

"Overall: highly quaffable Pilsner. It's not crisp and bitter like a Czech, but is appropriately rounded like a German version of the style. I think it is a success."
""
"Overall: solid German Pils. Can't go wrong with Brooklyn. Only scored it somewhat low because I'm biased towards Czech Pils which showcases the hops much better IMHO."
"O: Really good for a style that's not my normal go to."

"Pure golden blonde, very clear with ample bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Thick white head. Beautiful lacing. Nose is clean with pale light malts, hint of floral and mildly citric hops. Super clean and refreshing with a healthy carbonation."

"Poured from the bottle into a pilsener glass, an orange-yellow hue with an ample fluffy white head. Smells like doughy pale malt and assertive floral-spicy noble hops, pleasantly tangy and vibrant with a subdued rounded sweetness. Taste is saltine crackers, subtle lemon-lime citrus, faint celery stalk, white pepper, blackberry, maybe hints of apple, and a rounded corn-like sweetness: I think Brooklyn did indeed capture some preProhibition flavor here. Not overly green but does feature a more rounded floral citrus hop note, almost like perfumed tea, with a sweeter than usual malt backbone. Moderately carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel and thin but not watery body. Great pils in my book. I dig the sweeter malts and noticeable fruity hop flavors, although things don't stray too far from style guidelines. Top notch patio beer drinkable in quantity."

"O - Pretty much what I expect from a pilsner, very refreshing and clean. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""

"O:A pretty good pilsener. Not my favorite. I prefer the dryer more grainy pilseners but this has its time and place as well. Glad I tried it."
""
"O: Great example of a German Pilsner with an American hoppy twist."
"Pours a pale golden color. Clear and with a fat head of white foam. The appearance is perfection. Some bubbles race to the top and the head falls slowly leaving lots of lacing. The nose is Sweet grain and herbal. It's got a bit of hop perfume on it and and is lightly lemony. The taste is clean , crisp and terrific. The mouthfeel is creamy but the carbonation is crisp so it's a nice tease to the palate. The grain is just sweet and the herbal is a touch spicy. The lemony hops take the back end and bring this to a medium dry finish with a small little hint of bitter. Lively and malty this has plenty of flavor to keep you satisfied as you drink three or four of these."

"Pours a nice golden sun yellow, one and a half finger head that falls kinda fast. Decent carbonation. Smells like light malts, hay, and a slight hoppy background. Taste follows suit, nice sweetness from the malt, fruity hop notes, a fresh light note of that typical 'pilsner' flavor. Very nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, feels like you can drink a lot without feeling full. Overall a really great pils, very happy with it."

"Mouthfeel - Light bubbles that are very small. Loses carbonation quickly though. Coats palate nicely. Has a very light body. - 3.75"

"Overall - An easy-drinking German pilsener. Flavours are refreshing together, but nothing really stands out as being extraordinary."

"DATE TASTED: August 16, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Paulaner pokal... OCCASION: Strat-O-Matic football cards arrive... APPEARANCE: tawny straw-golden body that supports a confident white froth; lacing is thick with rings; effervescence is steady... AROMA: pleasant floral fragrance with bananas and clove--a flavorful combination...PALATE: smooth, medium-bodied with a palpable aftertaste; the balance is striking ...TASTE: lightly malty, slightly hoppy--the airy scents translate to a lagerish depth and strength... OVERALL: mellow, predictable pilsner--but a compliment, considering the pilsner profile as a whole; as a player in the Brooklyn sampler, the pilsner holds up well..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Crisper than typical versions of the style, with less malt flavor and aroma. The hop characteristics do a good job of showcasing bitterness and flavor without seeming too harsh."

"Light straw color with mild carbonation and light head. Slightly fruity and an almost yeasty aroma. Heavy vegetable notes with hints of malt. Real lack of depth and character. Finishes a bit bitter. We're slightly disappointed with this particular brew because we feel it tastes far from complex to us."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I LOVE THIS PILS!"
""
""
""
""
"Scent of floral citrus. Pours a clear bright yellow body with two fingers of foamy white head. Retention is good and laces gently down the glass. Taste is perfectly balanced between the bite of hops and the sweetness of a slightly bready and lemony malt. very refreshing, a perfect summer drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: An outstanding summer brew. Usually I'll only drink a pilsener or light lager in hot weather, but this one I'd take anytime of year. One of my favorites for pure refreshment, well worth the extra money it costs over a mainstream pilsener/lager."

"Quite a pleasant quaff. Very light with a restrained hoppy finish and a touch of fruitiness. A 12-oz bottle from the mixed 12-pack bought in Lubbock, Texas."
""
""
""
""
"Very well balanced pilsner, good beer."
"In the end, still a decent beer. It does not stand out for me because of the lack of hops and the bigger mouthfeel."

"O- A good pilsner, almost no hop presence, but the flavors are solid."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer."
""

"Overall,t he brew is yummy and I keep ordering this, they are able to price it so high because Brooklyn uses quality ingredients and it is just yummy."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: decent, but I would stay a step below good. a serious lack of hop aroma/flavor/presence mostly ruined it for me. that and the lack of clarity. not really much of a fan of either of Brooklyn's main lager beers. stick to your ales boys."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not much to say about this except that it is an excellent representation of a German pils. Right up there with Troeg's Sunshine Pils (and maybe Victory Prima Pils) for domestic craft examples of German pilsners."
"This is a decent beer, probably its biggest issue is the ridiculous carbonation level. Probably my least favorite Brooklyn, but that isn't so bad."
""

"I was really surprised by this beer and is definitely better than I had thought"

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best before March 2013. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, pepper, apple, cracker, bread, earth, floral, grass, and herbal spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; but are quite mild. Taste of lemon zest, pear, pepper, apple, cracker, bread, earth, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal spiciness. Light grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, pepper, cracker, bread, grass, floral, light pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor complexity and balance of malt and hop flavors; quite dry on the finish; with zero cloying flavors present on the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pilsner style. Well balanced with nice complexity; very smooth a crisp to drink. Very enjoyable and well put together."
"Overall not that I am a huge fan of the style but I pretty much like em sweet or dry hopped and this one came off too traditional with skunked grains and hops. Pass"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark straw color with a small white head that stays for some time, but not forever. Smells of lightly roasted grain with the barley standing out. Tastes of plain grain but much stronger and with hints of fruitiness. Beer is light bodied and very drinkable as is expected for a pilsner, and carbonation is right. Overall, a very good beer."

"Overall – Not a bad brew. It was rather lacking in some of its flavors and transitions, but it is quite refreshing."
""
"Medium-light bodied, crisp carbonation. Not bad; I would have enjoyed a sharper, more bitter hop presence and an even cleaner drinking feel in the end."
""
""
""
"O: A solid American-brewed pilsner, with plenty of floral hops. A solid choice if you're into the style or lagers in general"
""
""
""

""

"12oz bottle purchased in a mixed 12pk at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thin film of white-ish head. Fruity and grassy hops dominate the aroma. Grass, lemon, grapefruit, with bready malt in the background of the flavor. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Bright, fruity, and quaffable. Pretty damn good."
"This is a REALLY good German Pilsener. I live in Hong Kong and we have quite a few Pilseners from Germany and Czechoslovakia to choose from but very few beers from the US. I love the style and have to say that this beer is very true to it. It has a lot of that clean, pilsener hop flavor that I love. A bit more than say a Konig, Krombacher, Bitburger or even a Rothaus, which is my favorite. The malts and hops are very well balanced and I highly recommend this beer even to a European or ""authentic"" pilsener fan such as myself. I was shocked by how good this beer is. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall eh, not really what I expected for a german pilsner, too much sweetness, not enough of the lighter toasty straw malts, hops have some good qualities but not so great ones as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was very distracting. Its hop finish, which is typical of this style, contained the presence of floral and perfumy tones which persisted from the front of the tongue through its finish. Although this dissipated somewhat, its prescense never left the bear, which was like a dark cloud on a beufiful day... Reminicent of a skunky Heinekin."
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours golden with a white head. Head retention is nothing to write home about, the body is hazy. Smell is malty and a little fruity. It tastes pretty good, balanced and relaxing. Mouthfeel is on point too. Overall a good beer that I want to have on draft at a baseball game on a warm summer day!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Extremely wall-balanced and sessionable. Went down smooth and fast. Avoided the skunky hop taste that I've experienced in the last few pilsners I have tried. Light-bodied, crisp, and perfect for summer."
""
"Interesting that Brooklyn proclaims this as the kind of pilsner preferred by German-American brewers from a century ago, and not like the traditional homeland German pilsners. It shows, in that it isn't a good example of the current Deutsch style, but I wouldn't know what pre-Prohibition New York pils tasted like anyways, no matter how much Boardwalk Empire I watch. Anyways, an amenable quaff in its own right, nice to see it amongst its siblings on Alberta store shelves."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer brewed nicely to style. There isn't anything of import really to note. It's crisp, clean, refreshing, flavorful. If this came in cans, it would make a perfect poolside beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable - probably will have another later. I could see this going very well with a wide range of food, and went pretty well with Oven toasted Gruyere and caramelized onion open faced sandwiches - cleaned the strong tastes right away off the palate and complimented the flavors well also. A very good pilsner and glad I bought the six pack."
""
""
""
"O: I guess its not a bad beer, but nothing to scream about. From what I've read of other reviews, I was hoping for a better appearance, but was let down a bit. I'd probably only seek this out again if I found it on tap."
"This is extremely drinkable and pretty tasty. It's not exactly what I was expecting however, as it seems to be very low in hoppiness compared to other Pilseners."
"I enjoyed this one, but I think it tastes more like a helles than a pilsner; still worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear, pale gold with no heaad or lace. It's aroma is of lemons, bread and a hint of vanilla. The flavor is lemony with grass and well balanced malt and hops. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, just right for the style. Brooklyn Pilsner is a good brew and a great match for sourdough pretzels. Recommended!"
"O- an easy drinker that easy crisp and tasty"
""
""
"I like so many of Brooklyn's beers - this trends towards the bottle of the list."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice take on a Pilsner. One of the better American versions out there. Very good hop presence."
"3.0 D: Good, but nothing impressed me."
"Overall: Very nice everyday Pilsner that happens to be better than most of the competition, American or German."
""
"12oz bottle, pours yellow with nice clarity and a thin white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aromas are Pilsner malt, slight fruit, and slight herbal hop. Tastes are nice a fruity with a solid Pilsner malt presence, and nice herbal hop finish. Refreshing and easy to drink. Nice take on a classic style."
"Very nice solid take on a pilsner. A bit darker than your average, but not by much. The aroma and flavor both showcase the malts, but are balanced well by some spicy hops. Very good. Perhaps not in my top 5 US pilsners, but very well done if you are a pilsner fan."
"Very well balanced and refreshing beer; I could easily finish the whole 6-pack. I think I like this even better than their Lager."
"(D)- Not bad. I could drink a few of these, but again, a bit heavier malt-wise for the style."
""
""
""
"O: Decent Pilsner – not my favorite style – but this went down easy."
""
"Overall: An excellent session beer that many people could enjoy."
""
"O- Delicious, refreshing. I highly recommend it."
""
"Very good American made German style pilsner!"
""
""
""
"O-- solid pils, B+"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass, best by date of July 2012. This pours a clear straw color with a large white head. The smells are a little of grassy hops, crisp clean and malts, not bad. The feel is light and crisp. The taste is some of the same light and crisp, some light hop bite and very clean malts."
"O: Nothing particularly groundbreaking here, but still a drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"o - Overall an above average pilsner, though the nose is a bit bland. Easy to drink and some nice fruit and floral notes in the taste. Would drink it again if I was looking for a light pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty solid, no complaints."
""
""
""
""
"O: An average German pilsner, i'd like to have tasted more spice profile and hop profile to really fit in with the style. This tastes more like an american pilsner than a german. Got better and more complex as it warmed up."
""
""
""
""
"O: a good beer, recommendable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a really great american pilsner, as pilsners go. pours a conventional light yellow color but has a large cloud-like head. smells like more than the traditional pilsners do, notes of vanilla and pitted fruit. taste is on the sweeter side, not dry at all. really nice hop additions as well. great medium/light body makes this a not-boring pilser to session. definitely one of the more inspired versions i have had"

"D: This beer is simple and refreshing. For the style, I think the flavor is overly dominated by hops, but it's tasty no less."
"A real good quaff, right to style and easily rivaling the more mainstream German Pilsners. The hoppiness here has won me over."
"Purchased at Wegmans as part of a mixed six. Best by date this month so had to try it quick. Poured from the bottle into a tall pilsner. Bright shiny color, moderate carbonation and nice clarity. Foam cap lasted a minute or two. Clean aroma with some malt and just a tiny hop presence. May be lighter than intended due to the freshness. Good basic pilsner flavor, easy drinking. Would like to try on-tap. Oh, and bottle said brewed in Utica."
"The flavor is alright, not traditional but not bad. It has a nice balance and a crisp bitterness in the finish."
"Poured this German Pilsener from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Pilsener poured a slightly hazy golden color. It produced a nice white head, retention is below average, lacing is minimal. The aroma is comprised of sweet grain and a touch of hops. The beer is very crisp, a very nice bite, there is some citrusy lemony hops in the forefront, followed by bitter malt and a slightly dry finish that leaves you wanting to take another sip. Very nice example of a pilsner, according to the label, an attempt at a pre-prohibition German lager. Great craft brewed Pilsner. This is the kind of beer that if you drink enough....it would make me inclined to pick up a hitch-hiker. Bob Evans anyone?"
"I wondered today while drinking this beer if Pilsners were generally disliked amongst the otherwise beer-loving public. I wondered this question because I can't say many nice things about it myself, and yet, it persists as an omnipresent choice amongst fast-moving shelves at a high-quality price. Judging from these reviews, it seems Pilsner has many detractors. Still, I would love to try a quality version of this style."
"I poured this into a pilsner glass and it poured a nice copper color with a foamy white head. The beer was very dry and moderately hoppy. Probably a decent pislner if you're a fan of the style just not something I've crazy about."
"Bready with clean pilsner malt, almost saltine cracker-like due to the dryness. Lemony hops, with a mild bitterness that tends to linger. Flavor is good, though slightly bland and papery outside of the hop character. Light bodied, crisp and dry. Good summer session beer, far better than Brooklyn Lager."
"This one has a stronger malt presence than any of the other Pil's I've had and I enjoyed it. Definitely sessionable and something that I'll probably pick up in the future on a hot day."
"I am perturbed by beer advocate boys review... am I wrong?"
"I look forward to trying other Brooklyn styles and plan to make room in the fridge for Brooklyn Lager and Pilsener the remainder of the Summer."
"O: Sweet caramel malts and bitter floral hops combine for a nicley balanced and easy drinking Pilsner."
"Pours a light straw color, with barely a 1/4 inch head. Smell is straw, citrus, grass. Light body, nice mouthfeel with good carbonation. Taste is clean, refreshing, a little cidery in a good way. Some malty sweetness, a little grassy hops and some citrus hop flavor, but not assertive. Finish is extremely clean. The more I drink it, the more I like it. Not a big pilsner fan, but this I will buy again. Very enjoyable!"
"PILSNERS ARE GREAT AND THIS IS GOOD"
"D - Very good beer, and a great example of the style from an American brewery. Impressive, most impressive."
"Overall-I'm the first one to admit I pass by Pilseners because of their lack of flavor. However, this is a very nice beer, and a nice example of the style."
"Impressed overall, looks great as the lace continues throughout; more flavor that I expected; nice contrast between the grainy malt nose and grassy flavors."
"Poured into a pint glass. Got some dark golden brew with a small white head as a cap. The German hops give this a straw profile, which I both expect and love in my pilsners. Straightforward, nothing that really blows me away, but sometimes ""just nice"" is a beer I want to have in my fridge often. Pair it with some BBQ, and there's nothing wrong in life."
"Nice light body here with lively carbonation. Overall this is enjoyable enough but there are a gazillion better pilsners on the market."
"Transparent golden corn color with white frothy head that stays. Aroma of European hops, grains and a touch of honey. Refreshing flavors of hops, cereal, light floral, slight citrus with bitterness and dryness towards the finish. Light in body with light carbonation. Crisp, thirst quenching and sessionable."
"Pours a nice golden amber with an offwhite head. Aroma of grassy citrusy hops, light fruity notes, with some malt and cereal grains make a presence in the taste. Palate is light bodied, with good carbonation, and crisp mouthfeel. Finish is malt,yeasty, grass, some light citrus hops and a bit of skunkyness. Overall an ok brew."
"Pours to a frothy, lacy white head and pale gold color. Aroma is sweet malt and noble hops. Flavor is mild with a balance of sweet pale malt and noble hops. There's a slight butteriness and fullness of flavor akin to a Czech pils. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is right. Very tasty but not quite as sharp as most German pils. I like it anyway."
"A little light for my taste but overall is pretty good."
"O - I've been trying a lot of American-made pilsners as of late to compare to my own homebrew pils. Sadly, this doesn't seem to stack up to others I've had recently. Don't get me wrong, its not a bad beer but its not a good one. Drinkable and refreshing though not a brew I'd go back to."
"A clear yellow with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing, this is a gorgeous beer. The nose is chock-full of doughy and cracker-like malt. There's some honey as well, and the hop character is surprisingly restrained with a blend of floral and earthy with a little lemon. The hops are much more assertive on the palate. Opening with a blend of spicy hop flavor and doughy, bready malt, this beer has a very rustic malt character. Particularly bitter on the finish with some lemon peel, this beer is light in body and is amply carbonated. The bitterness is too high for the style (IMO), but apart from that, this is a solid pils."
"A very solid pilsner, glad I got to try this. Maybe it doesn't stack up against others I've had, but when paired with the right food, it's really quite good."
"It's rare that I buy a pilsner from outside of my home state so I picked up one of these to broaden my horizons. Very nice looking pils. Crystal clear and golden with a decent foamy head. Smell is grainy, grassy and floral. Palate is crisp and bitter with a balanced hop to malt flavor ratio. Earthy and grainy with just a hint of sweetness on the back end. Mouthfeel is mildly dry and very lively. In the end, this was much better than I expected but won't be a regular in my fridge. There's just too many great local pilsners that are a notch or two better."
"Solid flavor too, with more cracker maltiness and a bit of toasted bread crust. Hops taste grassy and bitter, while the finish is all mineral water. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style: thin body, bubbly carbonation, juicy/crisp finish. Just a superbly made Pilsner, nothing to see here..."
"Overall this is very easy to drink, gone before I knew it. I can see this being a great beer for any occasion, quite sessionable."
"Taste has a nice balance of light, grainy malt and grassy hop flavor. Decent bitterness throws a bite on the finish. Freshness is key here, and is quite the thirst quencher. I like it, glad Brooklyn brought this one into Tx recently."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is sessionable."
"This is a pretty solid and easy drinking pils, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. For me, however, there are a number of better ones that are just as if not more accessible here in Eastern PA, so I don't think I'll find myself reaching for this with any regularity. A solid brew however that I'd be happy to knock back on draft if I saw it on the menu."
"Pale golden colour, tight one finger of sticky head, some lace on the glass. Smells slightly hoppy, grassy, some malt, light lemony citrus, nice light fresh nose. Taste is of crisp hop, grassy notes come back, solid malt finish, pretty clean brew. Thin mouthfeel, slightly watery, very crisp carbonation. Drinks very nicely, I probably wouldn't order/buy this all the time but it would be a good beer from time to time in the warm weather."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A pretty good representation of the style. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's good. It only runs $8.99 a sixer here in Erie, which is pretty good."
"Poured a nice golden amber, a bit darker then I would have thought, and that is good. a nice fluffy pillow like white head graced the top to a height of about two inches before settling back down to just some lace ringing the glass, a touch of which stuck around for a while. Great visible carbonation evident in streams of bubbles filtering up from the bottom. Smell was light, lots of grain with some hints of maybe corn or an earthy cereal, but nothing spectacular. Taste was good, you typical pilsner. Light on the flavor, big on carbonation. Smooth crisp mouthfeel. Not a real lingering flavor, but what was there was lots of grain and corn maybe, something else but it was hard to place. Very sessionable, as it was very light. All together a good summer drinker, I have had better, but it is definatly not bad. Looking forward to hitting up some more."
"Drinkability seems to go a long way with this one. I could drink this all day if I needed to (or wanted to :) ). Basically, it's a great beer to keep in the fridge or best to get on tap at the brewery!"
"D- Very drinkable, great summer/session beer."
"D- Thats this beers strong point. Would pair wonderfully with many foods and is tasty enough to drink a few on its own."
"D - Good drinkability here. It is a very refreshing beer, and I think it would be great to enjoy on a hot summer day. I'm going to have to get some more of these when summer rolls around. I recommend giving it a shot."
"Refreshing mouthfeel with a nice hop bite. A good amount of carbonation tingle."
"D-Really drinkable. Would be even better in the summer but I am not going to turn down a beer at a friend's house."
"Normally I don't drink Pilsner but I decided to try one from Brooklyn the brewery I like. 12 ounce bottle. Pours a hazy golden-amber color with a nice lacy head. Aroma of floral hops with hints of citrus and malts. Flavor is mild (for Pilsner) hops upfront balanced by some maltiness. Finish is short, dry with grapefruit notes. OK beer, but expected more from Brooklyn."
"D - I could drink these all night. One of the few beers I'd ever have the urge or ability to drink more than six of. I really like this beer as a session beer. There's nothing spectacular about it, but being the first time I've tried it, I know I'll be coming back to it. Real real solid beer here. Simple. Reliable."
"Drink - A very enjoyable beer that reminded me a little of Victory's Primia Pils. (although not as good) It's an above average brew that I'm happy I tried. I'd really like to try this one on tap."
"Overall, fairly disappointed on this one. I don't know what I expected, exactly, but I didn't get anything I would want to try again. Brooklyn can be a little hit or miss sometimes and this one was a miss. I'd go elsewhere if pilseners are your thing."
"Across the board good beer. Very drinkable and, of course, a darling for food pairing - green and light pasta salads, non-white fish, and grilled pork or chicken."
"D. A solid beer that is subtle, but not boring. I continually appreciate what Brooklyn Brewery brings to the table."
"a consistent golden yelle pilz. With a new big white head and some lace but nothing amazing. Well done, and end of story. Nose more of lemon west than some. Has the bitter finish of that munich malt with the mild woodiness. Otherwise hoppier. Crisp. Not floral but lemon dry pine. Clears the palate and induces an appetite so i can't complain but i you like a tad more latitude. Not gravity. Feel is great... But a broader finish. Good york though. A hard style to get right."
"Good beer, could drink a bunch. I had this following the Bitburger, and thought this was a notch below. But solid."
"These would be a great choice for a summer session. I've always been impressed by brooklyn beers."
"D - An easy drinking, refreshing pilsner."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, well balanced - certainly a nice beer to sit with for a while, especially on a warm evening."
"Notes:I enjoyed this beer on one of the hottest nights New York has seen. I went for a swim and enjoyed a few of these. I cannot think of a better day of the year to be enjoying this great beer."
"Poured a translucent golden hue into pilsener glass, with heavy carbonation, one finger of white, and decent head retention and lacing. The smell wasn't as herbal/bitter noble hoppy as I had expected; a little more malty and maybe sweet'ish. The taste confirmed that something was missing; either in the form of a less pronounced grain bill or a more pronounced noble hops bill. That being said, it did finish on a crisp dry note. The mouthfeel was on the thin side, and highly carbonated. Definitely a decent session pilsener, but I would suggest working on the hop/malt balance."
"D- Very refreshing pils. I don't have much to say other than this is a great beer in a category I'm not otherwise familiar with. Now I'm interested in the great German Pilsener..."
"Once again. Pure, clean, simple. Good."
"Taste-Biscuit, with a spicy hop bite up front that lingers to the finish. Crisp and refreshing, a worthy session beer. Would make a nice entry-level brew into the craft world."
"D- over the past few months i've been more and more attracted to lighter bodied german style beers and this one definitely feeds my hunger. summer practically here, i will be keeping this one around. thanks to dave from heidelberg for the samples."
"D: another great offering from Brooklyn. I would even venture to say that this is a better brew than their flagship Lager. If only Americans appreciated a well made pils...."
"D- Most excellent drinkability was very impressed that it was in fact a pilsner, it is in a class all it's own, a deserves all the great recognition this beer will receive if it hasn't already, so grab your favorite beer mug, crack open a Brooklyn pilsner and get ready to be impressed!"
"Maybe I just had a more summery lager in mind 'cause it's not a bad beer by any standard. Maybe more of a winter time pils."
"D: Light, refreshing and smooth. Not a lot of flavor going on, but I could easily drink a few of these and finished the beer before I finished my 2 slices (beer went well with the pizza, btw)."
"Very easy to drink. Kind of a mindless beer when you wanna throw a couple back."
"Pours a very light transparent amber color with a one finger head that leaves a lot of lacing. The nose is heavy on malt and grain and a slight bit of hops. The taste is very grainy with a slight bit of malt sweetness and a touch of hops. Very watery and lacking in flavor. The mouthfeel is decent but its not a very drinkable brew and one of my least favorite from brooklyn, which is a brewery I like a lot."
"D - Pretty decent pilsner, but nothing to write home about, just easy drinking."
"This is one of the better craft pilsners on the market. It leans towards the bready and malty end of the spectrum, while remaining crisp and bitter."
"D: Good Pilsner, great for a warm day"
"Not quite as good as Victory's prima pils or Sam Adam's noble pils, but close enough to be included in the discussion. These american pilsners are making me want to try the authentic german versions fresh. some day."
"D-solid lager with pretty good flavors and a nice balance. Clean and crisp drinking, very sessionalbe"
"Buy Again? No."
"taste is rather unique for an american pils...the hops are very background, but the maltiness comes out florally but not overly sweet. the slight bitterness of the hops come in as a nice after thought. mouthfeel shows off a nice balance of smoothness and carbonation, rendering this quite drinkable."
"Not one of my favorite types of brew, but definitely one of the best pilsners I've ever had."
"Overall, a pretty sessionable beer that brings lots of flavor to the table without sacrificing some of the backbone of the pilsner style. A solid beer all around."
"Drinkability: A nice and hoppy pils. Not the best I have had but certainly good. I could have three or so, especially on a hot day."
"Drinkability: The carbonation and not clean finish turn into a beer that is close to, but not exactly what I am looking for in a German pilsner. Not a bad beer at all. Rather refreshing."
"A gold color with just a hint of haziness. Medium sized white head, little bit of lacing. It had a sweet, outdoorsy aroma. Grass and flowers. Malt taste up front with some late sharp hops. Crisp beer. Easy drinking, had three of these in short order."
"Such a great quaffer. Right behind a hefe for sessioning."
"It's not a bad drop, and it's very clean and crisp, but it lacks a lot of the true pilsener characters that would make it really good. As it stands, I think it's the lesser of it and the Brooklyn Lager, which I find a little confusing."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this isn't the first pilsener that I would choose but it's still a solid beer to drink for a while."
"Drinkability: Great session beer and a very good representation of its style. Hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Therefore, it may not satisfy hopheads fully, but still provides a decent hop fix."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable pilsner. Worth a try."
"This beer pours a clear golden color, perhaps a little darker than the ""classics"" of the style. A nice foamy head recedes into thin lace. A nice hop aroma with some cut grass, a little spicy, but definitely a bready malt backbone. Fresh and clean on the palate. A refreshing bitterness is balanced by a slight maltiness. The beer exits fast and again bitter, leaving a lasting dryness across the palate."
"Not a bad pilsner, kind of lacking in taste, especially compared to Prima pils and Troegs. Not a bad effort though."
"Notes: I confess I´m not a big fan of the style but this is a good brew, very pleasing to be had, and clearly shines above the average macro offering and quite a few largers and pilsners around. Great beer to offer to guests used to macros to get them gently into a different range of beers. It has worked like a charm in that regard every-time so far. A regular in my fridge during a good part of the year."
"Drinkability is average. This is really just an average run of the mill pilsner. It's slightly higher quality than your generic, but its cheap and it pairs well with all sorts of summer food and events."
"Fairly lively carbonation, lacking something in the body. Needs to be a bit cleaner. Not the best craft pilsner out there, but still a good pick for summer grilling, etc."
"Not my favorite style, actually, probably my least liked. But a good example of the style, with a bit more flavor."
"This beer is a clean clear gold color with a nice bright white head that appears to be lingering nicely. The nose is a bit restrained but I do get a bit of floral hop with a touch of grainy malt. The taste is a good blend of light sweet grain and the floral grassy hop. Bitterness is never overpowering but is enough to balance the malt. Everything is carried along with a fine and fairly lively carbonation that keeps things pretty smooth. In general the taste, while good, may be missing a bit of assertiveness. I'd also like it if the beer was a bit cleaner, there is a little more residual flavor than I would like for a beer of this style. Drinkability is good but the beer is not a premier example of the style."
"D-Very good. I'll ave to have a couple more :D I must admit, I was moderately disappointed when my sister purchased this, but it's delicious and one of the best pilsners I've had. Get some when you're in New York in the summer."
"Notes: This is a very clean and highly drinkable Pilsner and it is great on a hot summer day."
"A not-great, run-of-the-mill offering. Soft amber color and an off-white head that stayed around for a while, leaving behind a nice amount of lacing. Pleasant and malty in the nose, with some citrusy hops and a bit of sugar. Rather flat body, and an overly-hopped taste that managed to have a pleasant dryness, but not enough to overcome the bland taste. Drinkable and enjoyable under the right circumstances, but on the whole... blah."
"Taste is a medium bodied pilsner, with the barley there, again some sugar, a smooth taste all around. Mouthfeel is faintly sweet, with that corn field swishing about your palate. This pilsner from Brooklyn is better than the macro pilsners, but I wish the quality was little higher considering how good some of their other beer is."
"This is a good brew. The characters are fresh and clean. I don't understand why I got such a good pour when the consensus is that my experience is not at all typical."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable pilsner. I could easily have several and I like this well enough I'll be buying more in the future."
"This is a good versatile beer that I can drink no matter what season; good inside on a cold winter evening, good outside in June at a bbq."
"Overall- Crisp and delicious! This would be a great Baseball tailgating beer."
"D: A nice little pilsner from Brooklyn. These guys remind me a lot of Samuel Adams - a big, mass-produced line of interesting styles, some of which are well done and others of which leave something to be desired. This has to rank near the top of their regular line, however. Fairly refreshing on a muggy night like tonight."
"Dr. A good tasting beer, but not remarkable. A few would go down pretty easily."
"Pours a pale yellow very fizzy. Big foamy white head that slowly leaves. Still it leaves good lacing. Smells of grass and malt, nothing overpowering. Aroma of a typical Pilsner. Taste is Very smooth. Flavors of malt,with a malty/metalic taste. Its very drinkible, but doesn't have anything really exciting going for it. Its a good summer beer, but not anything I would seek out."
"it's also not overhopped in the end and to the most part medium bodied making it a harmonious pilsener if there ever was one. probably one of my highest ranked lagers."
"Picked up a single of this at Total Wine by Perimeter. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale yellow color with minimal head or lacing. Smell is earthy and grassy. Tastes slightly hoppy, metallic, and grassy. Moderate carbonation in the mouth - slightly watery, but it's a pilsner, so who's complaining? Overall, an average pilsner."
"at first look it was a nice deep gold with a thick head.. the head left good lacing while drinking.. it had a nice light hint of hops and malts scent nothing to overpowering.. tasted good again nothing to overpowering i did get a taste of a slight roast of malts.. maybe i am wrong.. drinkalbity is great and easy to throw them back on a warm day... cheers"
"A great pilsener."
"Smooth, slightly more of a medium body with a bitter dry aftertaste, although I expected the beer to have a lighter body than it did. Clean and crisp with really good drinkability and refreshing. Brooklyn again, produced another quality beer that I will be enjoying more of during the summer months."
"This beer pours a clear golden color, perhaps a little darker than the ""classics"" of the style. A nice foamy head recedes into thin lace. A nice hop aroma with some cut grass, a little spicy, but definitely a bready malt backbone. Fresh and clean on the palate. A refreshing bitterness is balanced by a slight maltiness. The beer exits fast and again bitter, leaving a lasting dryness across the palate. Refreshing and great as an aperitif or just to have in fridge."
"This is a very good drinking beer. Easy all the way around."
"D: Highly drinkable. Pretty good example of the style. The fiancee likes it."
"Overall - I should try to get my light beer drinking father to try this one. It's not very complex, but it tastes enjoyable enough and is not heavy at all. A good gateway to craft beer."
"Easy-drinking, but lacking in the nose; the diacetyl character is certainly undesireable in such a brew. Perhaps this is isolated and can be attributed to other factors in the age of the keg or the tap lines, but either way, aside from that it is a fairly nicely crafted Pilsner."
"D - High drinkability as with most pils. But this one has some solid flavor and character to it, while still retaining the cleanness expected from the style."
"Drinkability- Possibly my favorite Pilsner so far, which might not be saying much, as they're far from my favorite style. Definitely a beer I feel might be good to introduce to someone, trying to gradually bridge the gap from macro lagers, to craft beer."
"d - easily drinkable and could be a new go-to beer for the spring and summer."
"Drinkability- excellent. This is easy drinking, simple, and enjoyable. I will definitely buy more."
"m&d: Light to medium bodied, plenty of carbonation makes this very drinkable and with the < 5% ABV, deffinatly a session beer. I would like to try this again in the summer."
"The taste was of good mix of hops and spice, slightly bitter. Very smooth, almost like an Oktoberfest would taste like. Good balance, but could use a little more bitterness to it."
"D - There's no questions that it's easy to drink. I find pilsners to be quite sessionable, and this is no exception. Nothing outstanding, just a solid pilsner."
"Very pale yellow color with an orange tint to it, clear enough to see the diffuse bubbles on their way to making a thin white foam across the surface. Crisp and invigorating nose of hops, grapefruit pith, cigar ash, dried corn, oats, not truly complex but its freshness keeps you pleased. Light-bodied with an enduring bitterness which dries out your throat in such a way that you take another sip to try and wet it down some. Orange and grapefruit citrus present, little malt or any sort of sweetness. Grains and straw, can't lose that suggestion of ash. The carbonation level is moderately high and adds to the overall high tone. Stylistically correct, requires both high summer temperatures and the outdoors to show best. Still, not sure you could put down more than three bottles before needing to drink a gallon of water."
"Bright golden pilsner with a big sudsy pillow top with staying power. Smells sweet. Tastes sweet and feels crisp and turns a quick biting bitter. The bitter doesn't last long as the dry finish just makes me take another sip. A solid American offering of the German Pilsner style."
"6/4/5/3/12 (3.0/5)"
"My favorite from the Brooklyn line."
"Malty aroma. Golden colored, carbonated. Flavor malty, some citrus. Well rounded for a pilsner. I've never been a fan of this style for pretty obvious reasons -- the weak, watery pilsner is dominant in America in the form of Budweiser/Coors Light/Miller Lite. However, this is a very good effort and easily the best pilsner I've ever had."
"The tatse is light, crisply malty and hoppy, with bread, herbs, and a hint of lemon. It's lightly sweet with a light bitterness dominating the finish and lingering slightly."
"A previous delivery of the BOTMC that brings beer to my doorstep without lifting a finger. Smell is very malty with a hallertau-like subdued hoppiness. Pours to a yellow golden colour with a shaving cream head that leaves lacing. Taste is very sweet as anticipated from the smell. Start is sweet but quickly gets into some bitterness that doesn't linger at full strength, but stays a little longer than expected for a pilsener. The finish is a nice gradual dryness, not abrupt like macro pilseners. Good range of flavors for a pilsener. A usually simple brew style, hats off to Brooklyn this one that has fresh and more complex flavor. I'd pair this one with a real cheesy mushroom quiche."
"Pours a light straw color with about a finger or so of white head that lingers briefly. Pleasant aroma, a light grainy pils malt character (nearly like a graham cracker) with a bit of subtle spicy hoppiness. Taste is quite good. Solidly bitter throughout with some nice pils malt undertones with only hints of spicy hop flavor. Finishes relatively dry with a lingering bitterness. Medium-light to light body with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is a very crisp and refreshing beer that is characterized by a solid lingering bitterness and a good balance between pils malt and noble hop character. Very enjoyable, something I'll try to keep in my fridge."
"D: a nice well hopped interpreation of style. not one i would consider a classic by style but worthy of checking out."
"I enjoy this!!"
"The aromas are light malt backbone with a grassy hop aroma. The taste is crisp up front followed by a creamy sweet malt character that then goes to a lemon bitterness that rides out for a bit leaving plenty of flavor on the tongue. I would rank the drinkability high, but that is what a pilsner should be. This is not the greatest Pilsner I've ever had, but it also doesn't appear to have any flaws--at least from my palate."
"The flavor is a perfect balance of sweet and bitter."
"for all its luxuriousness, it's a little bit dull. maybe an ultrafresh bottle ... but then i've notice the same sort of quality in Brooklyn's octoberfest. a certain muted aspect. still, a very solid brew and quite drinkable. kinda reminds me of boston ale. yeah this drinks a bit more like an ale than a lager, not unlike Brooklyn Lager. Note: right after having this i had a boston ale. there are similarities to be sure, but the ale is over the top with softness and dull sourness. the brooklyn would be my choice between the two."
"Brooklyn hardly ever gets it wrong..."
"I like this beer, but it is not very pilsner-y. It's got more in common with a marzen/Oktoberfest or Vienna lager."
"This fits right into my pilsener love affair- will be grabbing more. This gets lower ratings apparently but this doesnt fall short of many others that top the style, perhaps Pikeland and Prima. Deserves respect."
"The more you drink the better it tastes. An easy-drinking brew!"
"43.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"6/8/2005. Lately I've been looking for beers that would be great for the summer and something to store in my golf bag :-) This fits the bill. Golden colored, pours some head and lace but not a lot. Sweet lemon malt aroma, not overpowering but there's enough there. Very well balanced and smooth. Crisp mild hop bite with a floral flavor and even some hints on honey. Lately my success rate hasn't been all that great with new beers so it was very nice to get something I really did enjoy."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with a touch of nutty caramel color to it. Great bone white two finger head the pour that slyly recedes to a ring o' foam around the top of the beer. The aroma is a nice, clean hop lime and some brisk, dry malts. The taste has a soft touch of dry toasted bread. The hops impart some floral notes and some gentle earthy grassy that blends goes well with the malts and boost up the palate and drinkability and sessionablilty of this beer. I would love if this beer was available at Lunar all year round. Very good American/German pilsner."
"D: Good drinker -- a nice summer post-lawn-mowing beer, or, as I had it, sitting on the porch after a day at the beach."
"Bottle came in one of those beer of the month club mixed 12 packs. I always am suspect of the conditions in the shipping and warehouse facilities. I am drinking it on August first and it has a ""best by"" date of November. From a bottle it pours a nice copper color. Now I'm looking at the category and the German Pilsner is supposed by be much lighter -- light straw or golden. A respectable head, but not particularly dense. The smell is pleasant, but can't make out the hops. First swig really gives off an unpleasant metalic taste. Wonder if this may have suffered from mishandling during shipping. As I drink the beer, what I first considered metalic seems to mellow and gets less objectionable, but still not on style. The hops are in the background...can tell the balance is close but not quite there. Got better the more of it I drank. The citrus notes of the hops began to come out. Left a very dry crisp mouthfeel. It is okay, but I don't really think it's to style, which explains my lower score."
" A fine beer. Perfect for the summer time."
"Easy to drink, like I say if you don't mind alittle flavor in your pils."
"Very tasty, certainly one of the best American versions of the style. It doesn't quite reach the balanced level of uniform brilliance as Victory's Prima Pils, but it's damn close."
"tastes crisp, citrus hops, goes down really well, one of the best pilsners i have had to date. i could drink several of these on a hot summer day in front of my grill."
"Clear dull gold in color with a cap of fine white fuzz. Sweetly floral nose lightly fruity grain and some spicy hops. Flavors are lightly sweet and floral with nice saltine cracker malt base and bunches of spicy nobles. Light-medium body good buzz to fresh carbonation. Crispy. One of the better German-style Pilsners I've had. Big spicy kick to it. Like it."
"M/D - Light bodied and very crisp. A drinkable pilsner, but the aftertaste is a little too much."
"D : Easy to drink, definitely works for these hot summer days."
"D: A very good choice for hot summer days, low ABV, a great session beer."
"Recommended..."
"Tasted on 6/25/08."
"D: A nice pilsner. I like Small Craft Warning from Clipper City Brewing better, but, this is the next best in the American-made pilsner bunch. A well-executed beer."
"D: Not my favorite from Brooklyn, and definitely not my favorite pilsner. I would not repeat again."
"i usually like brooklyn's beers but this one is an exception. maybe it has to do with the fact that nobody in my hometown drinks anything but american swill, but i suspect that this one had been in the case for a while. The lager i bought with it has a best before date of march 07... so this one is probably about the same. will need to revisit this beer with a fresh bottle"
"D = Flavorful and refreshing. This is one of the first true pilsners I've enjoyed drinking. Very well done. Excellent beer for a hot summer day."
"Nothing extraordinary in this beer."
"Not a bad pilsner, a bit more tart than I would have liked. The beer pours a clear, pale yellow with some initial white frothy head that dissipates to a ring around the glass, hardly any retention. At first, the aroma was quite hoppy, I'm thinking Saaz hops, but as the beer settled, the more floral, honeyed notes came out. There is a bit of grainy husk in the nose, quite characteristic of a pilsner. The taste is sweetish in the mid section, a bit honey and floral but not all that lemony; the peppery tartness really raises itself towards the finish and it lingers into the aftertaste. The beer is reasonably crisp, there is a touch of butteryness in the middle as well. The beer is fairly light, not much creaminess at all, and it lacks biscuity malts. There is a dryishness as the beer segues into the finish, and the initial sweetness departs. Mouthfeel is a product of the lingering peppery tartness, fairly watery. This is an okay beer, nothing spectacular."
"Notes: Got this one from dyan, thanks! This is a great domestic pils that I'd gladly drink again."
"Even though the carbonation is only moderate, this pilsner is sharp and straight. Beyond that the beer is very thin and, honestly, not that interesting. Not the best Brooklyn, nor the best American pils. Although vaguely Pilsnerish in its bitterness, as opposed to tasting like a typical cascade-loaded American ale."
"D = An excellent Summer time beer. Very flavorful and refreshing. Would be good for sessions, too."
"A good, but not great, pils. I would pick Prima Pils over this, but wouldn't avoid it in the stores or turn it down if offered."
"Dry mouthfeel."
"This is certainly a very refreshing beer, great to have in the summer. The low %ABV makes it very sessionable as well."
"Clear golden, nice ring with thin lace. Lively carbonation. Bready malts with some grassy hop aromas also detecting some butterscotch aroma. Bready malt, hints of honey again some buttery flavor, slight grassy hops on the finish. Gotta beleve diacetyl is involved here. Too bad as I was enjoying the malt and hop profile and this seemed to be a nicely hopped Pils. Note: this is the third sample of this over the last two nites. I was hoping the first two might have been the exception. The rest of this six pack will be returning to the store. I'll revisit this one later in the summer."
"D: Quite drinkable--the flavors meld well together and it's fairly crisp and refreshing."
"A drinkable beer, good for a hot day."
"That dryness would really be helpful with some spicy food, and the hint of sweetness kept me coming back for more. A good, solid pilsner."
"Smooth and creamy with a nice buzz of carbonation.Clean, crisp, and satisfying."
"Beer poured an amber gold with a decent half inch head. Aroma was of spicy hops, taste started with a ""beery"" home brew quality but then turned into a solidly balanced malt/hop flavor. Pleasantly bitter aftertaste, appropriate to the style. Once a got used to the flavor profile, three of these went down exceptionally well."
"Overall a great try on a difficult style to master."
"M&D: A bit more robust in the mouth than I would have expected, but not really heavy by any means. The carbonation is perfect, lending itself to a smooth creaminess that makes this brew so easy to drink. This is incredibly satisfying and tasty and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good pilsner. This will be a new regular in my rounds."
"Overall, this is a great summer brew for watching the game or having a barbecue."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy white head, some nice sticky lacing followed. The nose is malty, slight hop, some spices, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/bitter, malty, some hoppiness, nice tone of spice, and caramel. Light/Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"d - this is great in terms of drinkability for me, it's very clean and well flavored. I wish the hops were a little less present, but otherwise this is a great beer."
"Drinkability: A solid, refreshing pilsner that I wouldn't mind having on-hand during the warmer months."
"Pours a brilliantly clear medium straw color with a quarter inch of fluffy white head. Aromas coming off this are full of sweet, candy like pils malt, spicy, floral hop notes. The hop aroma is really nice, smooth and candy like. On the palate this is an incredibly thirst quenching beer. A bright floral, citrusy sweetness rushes forth, getting slightly grainy and finishing dry and crisp, with a lingering bitterness. The hop character is much better than any other German Pils I've had thus far (including Prima Pils), and its solid, albeit a bit tame, malt profile make this one of the easiest drinking beers I've come across in a while. Brooklyn may be considered like one of the ""big boys", but their base line is really solid."
"From the tap, the drink had an amber-orange appearance with some decent lacing. The smells were quite good: an almost vanilla-like malt aroma complimented the otherwise citrus smells. The taste had a malt-vanilla candy taste to it. However, I felt that the flavors were way to artificial and confectionery to be enjoyed. The carbonation was awful though; it was pretty weak and dull in general and just did not keep it alive. Overall, it had a decent taste but a bad feel."
"This is my kind of lighter beer, and reminds me of my time in Germany in the early eighties. Pours a fairly deep amber with lots of head. Smell is light hops with malt and taste is much the same but sharper hops and a very nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is slightly oily and finish is pleasantly bitter. This is rated to style, German Pilsners are simple well balanced beers, skewed a bit to bitterness, and this is a great example of the style. A beer I could drink in a session."
"This is an amazing beer. I wish it were more readily available like the Brooklyn Lager, but unfortunately it isn't. Pours out a golden, amber color. Inch high head that's real airy. Smells of citrus and hops. Tastes amazing without being too busy. Great lemony twist, sweet and tangy, but nicely balanced with hops. It's perfectly balanced and uncomplicated. A delicious, simple beer. Overall, if it weren't for its relative rarity, this would probably be my regular session beer."
"Poured a copper color a bit darker than I expected for a Pils. Smelled yeasty with some citrus and slight sweetness as of toffee. Tasted caramelish and well balanced with some pine and/or grass/citrus notes. All in all a decent brew. I love that Brooklyn has made their line available to Florida. Previously, we only had the Brooklyn Lager."
"It's a pretty good pils, but there seems to be some off flavors and aromas. And they need to cut back the crystal malts or whatever they are using to tone the color down if they want to call it a German pils like the label says."
"From a growler that was #3 out of the new keg. This beer poured a nice golden color with a small amount of cloudy white head. Has a nice scent to it with a hint of citrus. Could taste the citrus and the slight piney/tartness of it. Was very smooth and light in the mouth. I did not expect it to have a high citrus taste and it does, but not overwhelming at all. This was a very drinkable beer."
"Poured out into my new Warsteiner pils glass I got from my little bro for christmas. I drank alot of Bitburger pils in Germany this summer, but this is my first american offering as well as my first from Brooklyn. Lovely golden amber color, honey tones, very light creamy head that billows out of the glass. lots of hoppy,piney,floral, bitter citrus aromas on the nose. very aromatic. flovor matches the aroma, citus,hops. very good, a lot more in this brew than i expected. will purchase again"
"Pours a clouded straw gold with minimal white head. Nose is slightly citric - subdued oranges I say. Flavor is tangy with a tart touch. Bitter character on the end as well. Feel has a good bit of bubble on the tongue. Definitely drinkable. Doesnt seem to be a typical pilsner, but its pretty good. I could go for more than one of these easily."
"Feels creamy at first but finishes clearn. Watery and thin, though bubbly on the swallow. Reveals itself as a lesser brew as it warms. A bitter lager that is decent but disappointing."
"The hazy, quasi-unfiltered golden color was fantastic, and my mouth literally watered as I watched the near inch head bubble in the glass, as I smelled the beer. The mouth feel confused me, and while I have every intention on finishing the 6pack, I don't think I'll do so with my usual wreckless abandon. And by that, I mean I like beer. And I like this beer. I just wish it had an identity of it's own."
"Bottle courtesy of mgermani: Poured a clear golden color pils with a big foamy head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of dry malt with some light floral hops. Taste is a nice mix between dry malt with a light floral and dry hoppy finish. I noticed some spices which may be from the yeast strain that was used. Body is quite full for the style with some great carbonation. Well done."
"Dark hazy golden color. Thin head with thin fading lacing. Smells of light grains and some fruitiness. Tastes lightly of banana and almost a little wheaty with some nice hop bitterness. Light feel with a thin dry palate. Pretty easy to drink but not something I want to drink all day on Saturday."
"Overall, decent example of Pre Prohibition American Pilsner, very drinkable."
"It's a clean, not over-fruity, very mild Pilsner. My turkey just got popped in the over, and this seemed like the perfect beer to have at noon on Thanksgiving. Just a refreshing, relaxing pilsner that you can enjoy and forget in the same sitting. It what Matt Damon's NGC agent in Oceans 11 was trying to be. Perfect."
"I'm not a big pilsner fan to begin with, so I might have been a bit biased against this brew. Brooklyn's version did open my eyes a bit to the style, however, and I'll bit a bit more objective in the future."
"D - Easily drinkable and an unusually authentic pilsner. This is an excellent example of a classic session beer style that many American craft brewers could learn from."
"This is a fairly standard pilsener, with a nice malty profile and some slight herbal hop essence for balance. It's is very sweet, almost too sweet for a pils. The hop profile didn't make it's way through enough for this one to really be great. It's a nice, solid, drinkable beer, but you can find better around this brewery."
"This one was my ""give pilsner a chance"" beer. I am glad I chose this one. Pours a brillant gold with a rocky white head. Smells very floral. Good sharp bitter pilsner. Peppery bitterness gives way to a slight citrusy bitterness. Bready maltiness gives a medium body and the CO2 makes this beer very crisp. Brussels lace clings to the walls of the glass all the way to the bottom. Good drinkability...thankfully since I have a keg of it."
"Clear, clean and well carbonated pour with mildly aggresive head presents itself with a pale copper. Subdued nose of restrained hop, and reminiscent of lemon cake. Neutral and without pretense, this will not aggrevate the palate. I have never fully enjoyed a pilsner, but this gives me some hope. Tame, but I can appreciate it. Sessionable, and that goes a hell of a long way. Recommended."
"Pours a surprisingly substantial hazy soft gold with a white head. Grainy and bready malt aroma with grassy and herbal hops. Light to medium bodied with decent mouthfeel. Good balance with a bitter finish. Brooklyn's attempt at the classic pilsner style is a good one."
"Very drinkable."
"I'm not a big pilsner fan but this is a nice representation of the style overall. Although the aroma could use a bit of tweaking as it just didn't scream pilsner to me, it was still pretty nice. A nice simple brew from Brooklyn."
"Very drinkable, easy drinking."
"Ah, a great beer I hardly ever have anymore. I'd rate this over their lager, which is thick and great, but a little too heavy for ths style while this is a great take on a classic style. This beer pours a medium gold with a solid, lacy-white head that clings to the glass. Fresh grains, malt and yard clippings are the aromas with a little hoppy smell in the background. Taste is crisp, dry and biscuity with enough hops there to make you notice; refreshing without being watery or too sweet. A great beer you could drink all day."
"Drinks okay, but doesn't hold my interest past 2 bottles on a hot summer's day. Would do in a pinch, but otherwise I'd have to be sure I was drinking fresh to pick up another sixer"
"Drinkability - fantastic sessionability, awfully glad I grabbed a sixer instead of a single. A fully flavored pilsner all the way."
"12oz bottle. Pours light gold with a soapy head. Great looking champagne-like bubbles. Some sediment from bottom of the bottle. Hop aroma of ocean air with an underlying sweetness. Cracker-like malt flavor leads to a salty, dry finish. Crisp as per style. Hop aroma is present with every sip. I would love to steam some mussels or clams with this beer. Great domestic(fresh) pils."
"D-The wierd sopay metallic aftertaste limit the drinkability here. Fairly average for the style and the brewery."
"Appearance is slightly yellow-orange color, clear with minimal head on top that leaves a bit of lacing as it goes. Nose is grainy with a nice dose of fruit; a good scented pilsener. Maybe apricot on there too, a little honey. Taste is similar. That sort of rough grain flavor first, a little touch of astringency, some light hoppiness as the beer fades out. Feel is standard, a little thin but solid on carbonation. Overall, its another good one from Brooklyn."
"D - the BA site has abv listed lower than the abv printed on the bottle label (5.1%), either way, this is an exceptionally drinkable beer. Highly recommended."
"Quite easy to drink but still strong and interesting enough to interest the true beer geek. A good choice for a party or for just a lawnmower beer."
"The snappy continental hops join in for flavor as well, also balancing with light malt that leads into a crisp finishing bitterness. Slight sulfur, but fits the style without detracting. Excellent body with some backbone, while maintaining a classic pils ability to refresh on a hot summer day. You want a ""lawnmower"" beer? Take this over a thin bodied macro production after any day working in the hot sun. Very well done."
"Finished this brew 1/2 hr ago and can still taste the hop aftertaste. It's OK and I wouldn't refuse another, but IMO the hop/malt balance could be better."
"Nice aggressive dose of noble hops mixed with the aforementioned malts gives some nice balance to the beer, with a touch of nuttiness in the aftertaste to complement the bitter hop twang. Finish is a little gritty in the texture but not bad in the taste if you like the style. Overall, a bit more muscular in flavor than your standard German pilsner but still enjoyable and would be very welcome on a hot day."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty drinkable beer. There was nothing offensive in the smell or taste to me, but there was nothing that was exactly outstanding either."
"12oz bottle. Pours a pale straw with lots of carbonation. Little to no aroma. I'm always wary of anything described as ""refreshing"" on the label, and this proves to be no exception. The taste started off rather bland - but eventually, a somewhat nice aftertaste actually did develop. I guess the Brooklyn Pilsener offers something lighter than the Brooklyn Lager, but I would choose the latter every time."
"DA: a very easy to drink style in which this is a pretty decent example."
"Pours a nice golden. Thin white head,with good retention,and lacing. Smell is of floral hops and citrus. Body is light,and a bit too carbionated for me. Taste is malty up front,with a grapefruit like finish. This is not my favorite style of beer, but good for what it is."
"One of my favorite pilsners, probably because its not quite a pilsner."
"Looks light brown with a slight amber tint. One finger length head that was creamy dissolved slowly. The smell was mild and hoppy. Not thrilled about the taste: lingered in the range of not quite bitter enough and not quite flavorful enough for my taste. It could have used a strong hop taste, or strong accents to the hops. Fine mouthfeel, leaves the pallate dry. Does fine, but overall not too drinkable to me."
"Though this beer was labeled as a German pilsener, its appearance was darker and its flavor was more intensely malted and hopped than a typical example of the style. Nevertheless, this is a highly refreshing and drinkable beverage that pairs well with a variety of food."
"This bottle was definitely better than the last I had. Brooklyn calls it a pilsner, but it reminded me a lot more of a pale than anything. This beer was dominated by citrusy American hops, as opposed to the used Euro hops. I could have used a little more grain flavor, but it was nice. Call it a pilsner with an American craft twist (more hops)."
"Overall: Wow, was this good. So smooth, so tasty, so good. Pick this up next time you see it, I promise you will not regret doing so."
"Taste is lightly malty sweet but the hops definitely shine through with a herbal bittering twang. Nutty malt character balances it nicely. Lemonlike sour notes are there, subtly. Not ovely complex, but it's a Pilsner, and we're going for drinkability and character here. Carbonation is mild and the mouthfeel is soft and dries the palate completely in the finish. Aftertaste is lightly bitter. This is a patio beer to be sure, and the hop flavours are wonderful and flavourful enough to make this a really nice craft-brewed German Pils. A regular supply of this would be great, and it makes me look forward to summer!"
"I need a beer as I watch my GW team get slaughtered in the NCAAs, why not this one. This pours with a deep golden color and one of the most effervescent bodies Ive seen in a while, rising into a nice firm white head. The aroma is definitely restrained, slightly malty, but also hinting at a little hoppiness. This drinks very well, rich and malty yet with a nice Teutonic hop bite. Excellent Pilsner. (#2749, 3/15/2007)"
"Very nice fresh malty and hoppy aromas. Flavorful, balanced and crisp...more refreshing and food-friendly than Brooklyn lager, yet full of floral hoppy flavor. Will not hesitate to order this in the future."
"This brew pours out a translucent straw color with a nice finger of white head that dissipates relatively quickly. The aroma is also nice, with dry notes of bread, banana, citrus and some others I can't pin down. The flavor is crisp and clean, with hints of banana and grain again, and a lingering bitter aftertaste. A little soapy, but overall quite nice. The carbonation is satisfying, but other than that is unremarkable in the mouth. Overall, it was a pleasant drink. I can see myself having another."
"Cheers!"
"Malt flavors and body come forward as it warms but this is meant to be cold and sure offers more flavor than many Euro lagers and pilsners."
"A mighty fine pilsener to my taste buds, I wish this wasn't the last of my 6 of them, as this makes a great session beer if you're into this style."
"Recommended for spicy foods including Indian and Mexican."
"This beer had a nice crisp finish and its lively carbonation and medium body suits the style well."
"($7.49 / 6-pack)"
"Clear, pale yellow with a thin white head of fine bubbles. The aroma is of cereal sweetness with a slight yeastiness. Very crisp and clean. Malty sweet taste with some honey in there. Nice hop balance. Medium/light mouthfeel and well carbonated. Easy to drink as a pilsner should be, a pretty enjoyable beer."
"Overall a good drinkable pilsner. Very sessionable."
"Poured a hazy straw color with a small white head with minimal lacing. Light smell of floral hops. A light hop bitter taste, a bit dry but not too much. This pilsner feels light but not watery, crisp, no lingering bitterness, moderately carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer with a nice light hop taste. Tastes like an American crafted Pilsner. Not as good as some of the European pilsners, but very drinkable."
"Pours a clear yellow gold with a nice big white foamy head. The head leaves great lacing and lasts forever. The smell is light with sweet malt and little else. The taste is sweet malt with a slight bitter hop backbone. Crisp and clean finishing,this is all about the malt with citrus bitterness. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well making this a nice everyday beer."
"Thanks again for the taste MuenchenerKindl."
"Poured a cloudy pale golden with a coarse head that stuck around. Smell was hoppy and crisp. Taste was medium bitter grapefruit hop with a smooth maltyness underneath. Everything a Pilsner should be. Crisp, refreshing, and honest. Great for a session."
"Mouthfeel is almost perfect and this style, although usually unexciting, has always excelled in its drinkability and this is no exception."
"Nice, light, not too watery. Nothing great, but easy to drink and pretty much on target for the style. It's what the macros that claim to be pilsners should be. A nice ""session"" selection."
"The mouth is light, yet has some character and bite, a nice dry, bitter, hoppy finish. Very drinkable, easily paired with a wide array of foods. A solid Pils."
"Freshness date clearly notched. Poured a light hazy straw yellow color. Clean white head dissipated rather quickly. There was some mild lace clinging to the sides of my pint. This brew smelled rather floral with slight doughy yeast hint. It tastes very crisp with a rather smooth clean dry hop finish. Subtle hints of sweet pale malt we detected in the background. This beer is very drinkable and easy going down. Certainly possess the qualities of an enjoyable Pilsner offering. Good carbonation with a light to a medium body. Well balanced and a good offering."
"Hits the spot...refreshing and drinkable."
"A good pilsner. Well made."
"1/10/07 update: Two months after the event, I found out many in the Halloween crowd actually liked the beer very much. A delayed response..."
"This was a pretty standard pilsner with a good flavor profile, but nothing really outstanding to note about this beer. It is a true rendering of the beer style and is solid across the board, but it didn't overly impress me anywhere along the way. Appropriate hopping, carbonation and color were present, but it just didn't do much for me. I wouldn't avoid this beer, I just wouldn't seek it out."
"Finishes mildly coarse. Rewarding and quenching. I found that this beer disappeared quickly. I would drink this one again but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"D: It's pretty quaffable. I'm not sure that I would buy a sixer of this, but it's certainly nothing I would turn down. Pleasant."
"D: You can't go wrong with 4.8% abv, for sure. A crisp, clean pilsner lager. There are other Brooklyn offerings I'd reach for first in a session (Brown Ale, Lager, Pennant Ale), but this is pretty good."
"The drinkability is good, a very refreshing brew. In this style freshness is everything. MK"
"Brooklyn Pilsner pours a pale, golden straw color, not completely clear. Aroma of sweet bread and surprisingly citrusy hops. The flavor is dominated by these surprisingly lemony hops; this beer certainly has the ""snap"" that Garrett Oliver praises in pilsners. In the finish, it fades into a dry grain flavor. Frankly, I think the hoppiness makes this beer less drinkable, but I'm not well-acquainted with pilsners. Still, an interesting, fun beer, and a good alternative to the ubiquitous lager."
"Poured into a pint glass out of the bottle, a lively head with a straw golden body. The nose was of a hoppy, herbally, slightly citrus scent with a real malty, crispy bread scent. The taste is of a clean bread, almost like a french bread inside, real fresh. The hops were clean on the palate when I first swallowed, but towards the end of the glass, I noticed that I was getting an aftertaste that lasted for a considerable amount of time, which is why I dropped drinkability, wasn't as clean as a pilsner should be in my opinion. Other than that, a good pilsner that I probably won't grab again."
"Drinkability - Brooklyn does a good job with this pilsner and it's worth a try if you haven't imbibed it before. A couple six-packs of this usually find their way into my refrigerator one or two occasions during any given summer."
"Two sips into this beer, and I'm bored already. Extremely similar to their all-malt Lager. Again, nothing wrong with the beer, but slight in the complexity, richess, texture, and depth, of great German Pilsners. Compared to their lager, the hops are earthier (saaz) and the malts are a bit richer and a bit vegital. Otherwise the texture, finish, aftertaste, and carbonation is average at best. Simply lackluster."
"Nice and crisp ,this beer tastes in the pocket for the style and provides a slightly bready pils that has a full body with no off flavours. Could drink a few of these on a hot day but it also has the class to move to the nightime scene. One of the better of this style I have tried lately"
"nice pils. great session brew: light, smooth, flavorful"
"D- This I think is a very nice pilsner. I have a new top 10."
"Overall impression: Another solid beer from Brooklyn. Very nice example of the style - I really wish more American craft brewers would make a quality pilsner!"
"D: The pils has a short hop flavor up front that rebounds nicely into a long clean finish. My thoughts on the beer changed drastically from first sip to last sip."
"D: Pleasant bitter aftertaste bites into the score a little."
"Drinkability: A refreshing and well-made Pilsner"
"Pours to a slightly hazy straw color, with thin white head and decent lacing. Floral aroma carries over to the taste, which is bitter. Dry finish. Not bad for a pilsner, but not my favorite. I actually drank this beer over a month after its ""best before"" date. Not sure if that had a major effect, or if it is just a second-rate beer."
"Pilsener isn't my favorite style of beer, all in all. But this is a reasonable summer drinking beer nonetheless. Appearance and smell are nothing special, but a bit better than average. Taste is decent, straight forward and not offensive, generally mild hops taste. Probably a good session beer that is certainly worth a try and isn't a bad member of the Brooklyn beer assortment, a generally easy beer to drink."
"I drank this at room temperature of note, as I do most beers, but for a pilsner this is possibly a little warmer than most would recommend. Pours A fizzy foam head, with notable carbonation, and a surprisingly pale yellow hue that is ultra transparent not unlike straight water. Hmm. Smells rather hoppy here, but herbal and citric rather than spicy, with an intense and stinging aroma. Taste is rather mellow, herbal again. The malt and the hops do balance, while the malt is rather husky and robust rather than bready. Overall the beer is light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is actually rather low on carbonation--the initial bubles must have escaped and left it rather flat. The feel is light on the tounge, and finishes dry. This is a good beer for relaxing, but I must say something about it's taste seems...stale, less than fresh, with a lack of desirable bread or dough overtones. This is not simply due to bottle, as I've noted this when on tap as well. It just tastes somewhat second rate, as do most brooklyn beers, to my palate, sadly. This is not a bad beer or a bad pilsner, but not one I'll choose unless on tap and (hence) icy cold."
"drinkability: highly drinkable, as expected"
"overall another winning lager from brooklyn."
"Overall this beer was well balanced and had ample carbonation. Definitely a sessionable beer, and one that I will continue to drink throughout the summer."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are both high on this offering. Crisp and smooth mouthfeel allows you to drink a bunch of these, especially if they are on tap and a waitress is bringing them to you. Would be a great beer for a hot summers day. Good offering from Brooklyn."
"Final Thought: I was hoping for more, but this style is owned by Pils Urquell... a slightly above average beer."
"Pours a nice, clear straw yellow with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. The aroma has some citrus notes initially, followed by some mildly spicy german hops, sweet grain, and toasted bread, interesting if not stylistically appropriate. The flavor begins with some lightly sweet malt flavors of brioche and toasted biscuit, along with some lemony tartness, and some slightly spicy german hops. The mouthfeel is crisp, light and refreshing, and drinkability is near perfect. This certainly isnt a traditional german pilsner, but the predominant lemon flavors suit me well and make this a great hot weather brew."
" I tend to prefer Brooklyn's Brown, Lager, or I.P.A., given a choice of their year-round offerings. However, this is no slouch of a beer and a pretty solid take on a European style. This pilsner would be a great introduction to Brooklyn's offerings for the novice, and rounds out their selection quite nicely. Worth a shot in the warmer months!"
"Picked up a single...best by month of June '06 notched on the label. If there was an ""other"" pilsner category, I think this one would fit."
"Musings: A thoroghly enjoyable pils. I can and will drink this throughout the warmer months as a go-to refresher."
"Very very clear, goldenish color. Light and pretty. Some nice lacing, and poofyish head. Nose is lemony, and a little fruity. Taste is okay, fruityish, a bit malty, and there's a bit of a crisp hoppyness near the end. A solid flavor, though not the deepest ever. Mouthfeel is on the chewy side, but a tad thin for me. Sudsy. Not offensive. Very drinkable- so easy for a six pack to disappear. Brooklyn's good."
"This pils from Brooklyn pours a maize color and leaves a 1/2in thick head. The body is clean and clear. The nose of this brew is spicy, lemon, wheat, and grassy must all come to mind. The taste is highly carbonated which refreshes the palate, very crisp and fresh. The start of this brew is a bitter hop bite on the tongue, with a lemon rind acidity that follows a small malty sweetness. The finish is bready, with a mellow wheat presence that balances the tartness in the brew. Very nice, refreshing pils exactly what the Germans where intending."
"All of this is highly faithful to the style, none of the elements of this beer are pulled off with particular grace, insight, or panache. The parts are all there, but the gestalt of this beer is a bit disappointing. Brooklyn Pilsner is OK, but nothing special; there are definitely better pilsners available out there, even for a comparable cost."
"D - A pretty good beer by itself but really shines with food. The taste stands up even to spicy food. The taste is refreshing and the bitterness and acidity are cleansing to the palette."
"Poured into a European Pilsner glass. The color is golden and clear with lively carbonation. Small, fluffy, white head with excellent retention. Faint hop aroma with a touch of citrus...barely. The taste is crisp and clean. A bit of a sour/bitter aftertaste that hurt my overall impression of the beer. However, it is very light on the palate and goes down easily. Glad I tried this beer but probably will be looing elsewhere next time I'm in the mood for a pilsner."
"Clear golden amber color with a medium thin white head that lasts almost the entire glass. Thin patches of lacing. Aroma of fresh hops and citrus with a little sweet honey. Light-bodied and bubbly with grassy hops and some malt flavoring. The finish is short and fairly bitter but ultimately a little watery. Slightly above average all around."
"D - Good. Good indeed. Make a pretty good session beer and would be a good pair for foods."
"Drinkability- A bit like a lawnmower beer to me."
"Drinkability: Nothing overpowers the palate, fairly balanced between sweet and bitter. Not the best Pils but one worth trying. A very good session beer or lawnmower beer due to the low abv and less than overpowering flavor profile. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Better suited for summer sippin' but this is spot on. Strongly recommended."
"This beer poured a light orange, nearly yellow color with little or no head to speak of and a thin lace that remained from start to finish. Smell was spicy with an interesting, almost meaty odor that was odd to say the least. Smell was also a bit musty, but not overpowering. Taste was also rather spicy, but not too heavy on the hops, with some light fruit flavors pulling through towards the end. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, making it very very drinkable. This is my second brew from Brooklyn brewery and I have to say that they make some pretty damn tasty beer. Looking forward to trying more. Cheers"
"Very clean crisp malty tastes with a bit of lemon in the bite. The lemon also follows in the aftertaste. Very drinkable and goes down smoothly. Lots of carbonation and there is a bit of a hoppiness in this one. The grains and hops work very well together to produce a nice pilsner. This would be an excellent summer brew."
"This was my first venture into the realm of pilsners coming from a large wealth of darker beers. Although I don't have much to compare it to insofar as style, I have to admit that I quite enjoyed this beer and its delicate flavors. It certainly ranks up there with beers that can be very easily sessioned, and overall found it more enjoyable than its current overall score might let on to some people."
"Drinkability: This was a new experience for me a pilsner with taste. I see a hot summer day and lawnwork mixing with this beer."
"A nice pilsner, I can easily drink it. With a little tweak, I think it could be superb."
"Pours out a golden brew with a one finger head that doesnt last. My first whiff i coulda swore smelled like euro skunk. But it must have settled out,,smell wasnt too bad as i started drinking it.Slightly hoppy smell not much else. Taste isnt bad,,nothing compared to something like prima pils but not too bad very subdued.An all around good drinking brew a few notches better then macros."
"Pours light straw with a firm foamy white head, good retention, good carbonation. Looks like what Bud et al try to accomplish. Smell is better than most Pils as well, with more pronounced hops and bitter wheat notes. Maybe even a little fruit accents. Taste is rather good, even smooth for a Pils. Good hops, slight fruitiness, very consistent and refreshing. Not very lingering like others. Crisp."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Delightful and so easy in the mouth, lively yet restrained. This is certainly an all day drinker, especially when the weather is warm and beer is on the menu. Another wonderful brew from my hometown, Brooklyn, and another reason why I love living on the East Coast."
"-UF"
"Poured a clear and light gold color with hardly any head to mention. Nose was very mild hops, but nothing special. Flavor is very smooth with just a slight tang. Malts are alyered ncieley in this beer but the hops permeate through and come out as nicely balance as they surround the malt flavors. Come through as herbal and just slightly bitter. Slightly dry with a fairly nice dry finish."
"This beer poured a nice golden color with a thin white foamy head. Lots of carbonation was evident and the beer was slightly cloudy. Aroma of light hops and not much else. Taste was a good hoppy feeling, nice and smooth and not too bitter. This beer has a well balanced mouthfeel as well. A highly drinkable beer."
"Pours from the bottle as a light, clear, golden liquid. The head is somewhat disappointingthin, then non-existent. No lace at all. Considerably high carbonation. Grassy, European hops, mixed with just a hint of malt. The taste is initially sweet and bread-likealmost dough-like. Hops kick in soon after the first impressions, and are herbal, bitter, and abrupt. This is a flavorful beer, for sure. The finish wasnt quite as crisp as Id expected, and instead lingered. All in all, this is an above average, very inviting pilsner."
"wow this is the best american pilsner i have come across. very clear. light yellow and very bubbly. one finger head that slowly fades to a thin line. light lacing all the way down the glass. smell light floral and spicy. starts a little sweet and finishes dry. very style correct and about a high a score as i think i can give a pilsner."
"Brooklyn Pils pours a pale, light straw color and produces a very respectable two finger head. Smell is faint and of bready malts, not very pronounced even for a Pilsner. Taste is toasty, nutty (pistachio) malts with a light twang. It's dry, pretty crisp and VERY refreshing. Hops are just enough and mouthfeel is pretty nice and light. Found it to be extremely balanced and drinkable. Quite enjoyable. Definitely will have some more...it's no Prima Pils...but will more than suffice in a pinch."
"This is another one of those staples that i try to keep on hand. It drinks easy. It is not a hop monster - has a nice biscuity palate and soft floral hops that refresh but do not over-power your tastebuds the way some Pale Ales do. It goes great with food especially chicken sate' I really think they scored a hit with this brew."
"Much better than the reviewer below me thought. This just happened to be the only beer I hadn't tried on the beer menu so why not? A bit pricey ($3.75 a pint), but a great find that almost rivals Prima Pils. Crisp, clean, with a nice bit of maltiness, especially in its light aftertaste. Real easy to finish, will be a great session beer one night before the summer is over."
"Light, white head that slowly waned away to clouds floating on the top. Color was a light, slightly hazy straw-yellow. Nose was sweet, almost candy-like. It reminded me of the way a package of Twizzlers smells. The mouthfeel was medium with some malty sweetness on the palate. The finish was mildly hoppy, but not overly so. I am sadly underwhelmed by this one, especially from Brooklyn, who I hold in high regard. I would have to say that there are many other Pilseners that I would reach for first."
"Drinkability: Sure, a pilsener should be fairly bitter and crisp, but I think the bitterness is a little too strong. No, change that, its not too strong, just out of balance. I found this to be a very average pilsener."
"The smell is good, with light malts underlining a solid hop profile. The taste isn't quite as nice, but it's still very decent. Hops pull through in the finish to complete the package. It's pretty easy to drink, too."
"A slight floral aroma, with a good golden color/appearance. Flavor was somewhat bitter with a moderate head with some lacing leftover after tasting. Good carbonation, somewhat fizzy, overall a good lager. Excellent beer to finish a hot summer day with."
"poured a moderate amber color with white head that rapidly disappeared. Smell is floral with a hint of bread. Taste is suprising for a pilsener with a lack of crispness but a nice fruitiness without being overly sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and enjoyable. A very nice drinking beer. I glad I tried it again because my perception has really improved"
"My first beer from Brooklyn leaves me looking forward to more!"
"Overall- a well-crafted pilsner, balanced but leaning towards the hoppy side, I tend to prefer the very hoppy ones but I can definite appeciate the balance and craftsmanship in this beer, a good pickup."
"Overall it was an acceptably drinkable lager but nothing outstanding. It did have a well defined body and wasn't at all meek or watered down. It would probably make a good transition beer for a macro drinker - similar in style to what they're used to without being overly challenging."
"Drinkability: This is among one of the best pilseners I have had to date. I'd like to do a taste test comparing the Victory Prima Pils which I feel is another great pilsener."
"Drinkability: easy quaffer here. Light alc. content and clean, refreshing feel make it go this pils go down quite easily. Has the makings of a nice session brew."
"This is well-crafted beer. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's my favorite offering to date from this brewery. That's all the more remarkable since pilseners aren't really my thing. If you enjoy the style, Brooklyn Pilsner is an easy recommendation."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and dry. Relatively clean finish as some soft grass hangs on the tastebuds. Overall a really nice pils for hanging on the deck while hanging with friends."
"I'd be willing to try this again on-tap. Or if someone reassures me this is an isolated incident."
"Haven't had this in a while, after a subpar sixer a couple years ago. It's come a long way baby, including the packaging. There will be more of this at my house this summer. Get yourself some and watch a game."
"Pours a pale gold with a pristine white head that sat and sat and sat. I thought I had a beer merangue for a bit. Aroma is crisp with some citrus floral notes with just a touch of bread crust. Taste starts off malty then the hops take over and let this finish crisp and dry. Some herbal/floral notes in the finish. Very clean tasting maybe a touch of white bread in the beginning and middle, but nothing that takes away from the overall crisp clean bite at the end. Mouthfeel is good as it is nicely carbonated which helps keep the flavour clean. Drinkability is good. Perfect for a hot summer day especially while grilling and doing yard work. Good stuff and much better than some of the Euro-pils I have had over the last few days."
"My bottle had a baseball on it which is my weakness as I don't much care for Pils but I got it anyway. This wasn't half bad though as it wasn't quite as hoppy and a bit thicker feeling (heavier carbonation for sure) than other Pils I've had. The frothy white head was too much and wouldn't fade with a ceiling fan. It had a strong bread/malt scent that was pleasantly overpowering given the muggy/mildew smells outside lately. Readily drinkable. There was no lingering aftertaste even thought the finish hit a bit sharp."
"The flavor favors the malt along with a creamy texture and a significant hop bitterness. This beer is well made and a pleasure to drink."
"I liked this one. Hazy sunflower gold in the glass, the low white head has left me with just a ring of froth in the glass. Aroma delivers, with dried grass and a hint of spiceyness. Mouthfeel is good and medium, carbonation is small and not overwhelming. Tastewise the perfume of dried grass carries through. Small burst of citrusy hops in the finish. Delivers what it should, nice American example I can't believe I haven't reviewed up till this point."
"ARRg. I wished i lived closer so i could drink these guys' stuff every night. So amazing. This is one of my lesser enjoyed brooklyn's but i still like it. The aroma is sorta grainy and fruity. Nice fluffy head. This is a really solid pilsner. Its not very often that floral hops hit in you in the face so enjoyably with a pilsner. Its usually that gross metallic weak but prickley hops! Nice creamy-stickey mouthfeel. Really full yet refreshing."
"For the most part, the taste is lighter, but with a little more malt content than I'd expect from a pils. There's a note of yeast but lacking in the clean, crisp and fruity notes that I was hoping for. Not bad, but not a great pilsner."
"Overall: Not too impressed. It doesn't stand out far enough from mass marketed pilseners for me to recommend it."
"This was the perfect beer for a hot night.Appears a very clear and light amber color, more on the yellow straw side of things, with a decent head actually, though it fades quickly. When I first took a sip of this beer I thought it lacked flavor but as I got accustomed to it I kept noticing little subtleties with each taste. Plenty of mellow matly scents and tastes, along with hints of honey and some floral hops. Nice and sweet in a way, biscuity, yet crisp, clean, and refreshing. Once again, perfect for hot weather and in general this is one of the tastier pilsners I've had the pleasure of trying."
"Taste is grassy and lightly hoppy. Some sweetness from the pale malt. Creamy. Goes down easy. Nothing special about this pilsener but it's not bad either. Nice on a hot day."
"Brooklyn Brewery has quite a respectable stable of brews building; this one only reinforces that opinion."
"It's on par or better than most of the pilsners I've tried, but comes nowhere near the memory of that one perfect pils."
"Update: The new formula (with the Baseball on the label) has Saaz hops, and seems a much cleaner beer. No pumpkin flavor now, and mouthfeel is more crackling crisp."
"Good beer. Very drinkable."
"Solid session brew here. Very well made, and one of the better pilseners produced anywhere."
"Pour strong for a thick craggy foam over amber gold abstract. Curly metal shavings, veldt and fried egg dough advance a sugary rush that is immediately followed by bone-dry bitterness. My preference is a cleaner Pils but I like this one too. Fussypuss agrees."
"Nice beer, probably one of the best pilsners I've had, not that I've had that many."
"Clear gold body with a thinnish head. There are some mild hops on the nos wih a bit of straw malt. Its drier than the Brooklyn Lager I had just before. Its slightly grassy in the flavor, but its also a little on the weak side. It could use a bigger dry, straw malt and more of the hops."
"One of the better American Pilsners."
"An excellent pils! This was the hit of my last summer bbq. A good gateway brew for those pesky Corona imbibers. I think this beer is highly underrated."
"Served in a tall Pilsner glass and poured slightly hazy, golden and brassy in color. Topped with a very impressive creamy white head of foam. The aroma is grainy, pungent, lemony and slightly metallic. The taste is grain accented. Light tart and lemony. The hop character is a bit muddled, and could use more distinct flavoring and aroma. The beer, overall, is fine. This was always one of my favorites in the past, and still remains a decent beer."
"Yes, the style is simple. But simple is not synonymous with bad (certainly not in this case!). This would be a good beer to hand to a Bud drinker so that they can see that there is a world of difference between their alcoholic corn and rice beverage and a 100% all malt pils. All in all, this is a good, solid pilsener that might become a semi-regular in my fridge."
"This beer poured a nice pale golden, decent head that left some lacing, very bubbly, smell was floral, this beer, had a nice hoppy,floral, taste,rather smooth finish, hints of malt, crisp, and clean . mouthfeel was light, and bubbly, drinkability, I would say is good, nice beer, that I would have again, also would probably make a good session brew."
"Light bodied and crisp, a good simple pilsner. Nothing outstanding, but good on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: Rather enjoyable overall, but not quite as awesome as Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils or Troeg's Sunshine."
"Pours out a clear golden color with a nice head that goes away somewhat eventually. Smell consisted of hops and some sweet aromas as well with an undertone of malts. Taste was ok. A little too clean for my liking for pilsner. I would of liked to see more of that hop bite that I like to see in more common pilsners, but decent enough to drink."
"Drinkability: unlimited. Combines lightness and taste."
"Quite a different beer than the bottled version, which I had very recently. Perhaps they are brewed at different locations. Whatever the reason, this draft version is very good and the bottled version was not impressive."
"So far, this is my favorite American Pilsner. I think it remains very true to its Czech roots."
"Pale straw color with a bright white head. Hard to pick up anything special in the smell. A little hoppy. This beer was very crisp, clean and had a slightly bitter finish. This beer is easy to drink but does not do anything special for me. I would not look for this beer again, but if I went to a party and this was being served, I would be thrilled that it was not your run of the mill macro. This is a nice step up from them."
"Not usually a pilsener fan, but this one was good. Quaffed at the Mercury Lounge while enjoying Pilate, this was extremely fruity, with just a faint hop finish. Goes down easy, infinitely drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle, best before date notched into label. Poured light straw and very clear. White head, dissolves to a tiny bubble film, bubbles streaming up from the bottom and some lacing left behind. Bready nose. Light bodied, crisp hoppy brew, bready, malty notes with a nice hoppy, snappy finish. Decent session brew, solid summer thirst quencher. Nicely crafted pilsner."
"This pilsner poured a light golden amber color with good carbonation and creamy white foam that persisted and coated the glass leaving some lace. The smell was bready and slightly sweet with notes of malt and grain. The taste was slightly sweet malt with a tanginess. It was mildly hoppy with some floral hops overtones. There was a touch of fruity citrus as well, and the finish was good and hoppy. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. There was a light feel of tangy, soapy hops. This was a nice pilsner."
"A very average beer, and a decent representative of the style, however it's not my thang. The empty bitterness and lack of malt body really doesn't satisfy me in any way. Honestly, if I was blind-folded, I would call this a product of the big three (until it warmed up). I'll pass on seconds."
"I went to the Czech Republic a few months ago. While I loved the lagers there, it was ONLY lagers there, and when I came back, I delighted in ANY kind of beer that wasn't a lager. This is the first true pilsner I've had since then, and I'm happy to say I remember why pilsners are awesome. Pours a very light golden color, much clearer then most beers. A light lacy white head with good carbonation. Hoppy and light, this is a true summer beer, extremely drinkable, with a nice spicy hoppy taste. A good show from Brooklyn Brewery."
"Neon white head radiates brightly from its position atop my beverage. Clear, crisp gold straw colored brew. Herbal and lightly flowery potpourri aroma -- very faint, as though you were smelling flowers from a few rooms over. Very light. The hops present themselves in a more earthy, floral way than a firm bitterness. Certainly, there's a little kick at the end of this brew, but this is by no means clear of estery sweetness. It lacks a certain crispness. Of course, it's nonetheless a very quaffable, tasty beer. Just not quite right in my book."
"All in all, this beer is a little sweet for me and is nothing to get excited about. It is a good beer to watch out for, but not necessarily to go searching for."
"Drinkability: Goes down very smooth, very easy to drink, this would make a great session beer. Not so different from one of the better macros that a newbie to good beer would be too intimidated by it, but interesting and well crafted enough to enjoy. Nicely done."
"This is a great beer to introduce your macro drinking friends to micros. Yellow in color with a small head that disappears quickly. Lace sticks around for a while. Light floral and grainy aroma. A clean malty taste and subtle citrus notes. A little watered down IMO. Fizzy mouthfeel. It was however crisp and had a clean taste to it. Very refreshing, and drinkable especially with a good BBQ or with any fish or meat dish. Thats about all I can say about this brew. I'd drink this again, but won't be out hunting for it."
"Seemed like a good cold beer for a warm day."
"The beer pours a transparent gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. This is an average pilsner. It has a decent bitterness and a smooth finish. The taste is rather plain as most are. It's mouthfeel is fine. It's a low bodied beer with less than average carbonation. It drinks well and is fairly enjoyable. This is not a bad example of the style. It's just not one of their better offerings."
"Pours a darker yellow color with not as much head as expected,aroma was really grainy and hoppy with some sweetness maybe honey?Taste is pretty sharp and bitter loads of hops in here with a dry malty backbone with a a light metallic flavor in there as well.This is a pretty manly pilsner but quite good."
"Thanks to 36LLoveChild for the bottle!"
"The bright white head stood half an inch. Sunny wheat in color, and clear as can be. The aroma is of lightly sweet malt and hops with a bite. The taste is smooth, more malt in the burb than the taste. There's a dose of hops that hit the middle of the tongue, hardly any bitterness. The finish is light, just the taste fading away."
"Overall, a solid to good pilsner."
"This beer poured into the glass a clear pale yellow gold color and was well carbonated. The head that was created was of the consistency of a cloud. Thick, rich, full, good height and was white in color. When poured it rose fairly quickly and lasted for some time then fell to a small light covering with presence on the edges. Some lace seemed to be present but not overly present. The aromas that came from the glass, were of clean and crisp citrus notes, sweet tones of fruit and malt, grains, floral hops, fresh grass and some bread or yeast tones in the finish of the nose. The flavors that came from this beer were also very crisp and clean, tastes of fresh floral hops, lemony citrus, grains, some spices come through in the middle, firm malt flavors all through, tones of grass and finished with a bit of yeast on the tongue. Bitter bit in the beginning, a bit creamy in the middle then finished crisp and dry. The aftertaste was light and fresh. Light bodied. With the light ABV this beer is a really good choice to just sit back and drink all day. A good representative of its style."
"Orange gold color. Small white foamy quickly disappearing head. Aroma is grainy, grassy, fruity and sweet. A medium bodied pilsner. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are very spicy for a pilsner. Very nicely balanced, Clean and crisp. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is a touch dry and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Very nice golden color, with a crisp, fresh scent and very little to no head. Brooklyn's pilsner has great complexity of flavor for a pilsner, and a nice, light mouthfeel. Crisp, refreshing, easy drinking...and flavorful? I'm a fan. The taste also has a touch of florals and a very good balance of sweetness and bite. This is one of the better pilsners I've had on this side of the pond. Well done, Brooklyn."
"This light-bodied beer is crisp and clean with a snappy bitterness and floral aroma. The sweetness of the malts balances nicely with the hop bitterness. This is a very easy drinking, thirst quenching beer. Would make a great session beer and act as an intro beer for some macro drinkers. Nicely done."
"This is a wonderful pils. Pours out to a cloudy, gold in the glass with a decent, white head. Aroma is of light yeast and freshly baked bread. Nice balance of hop to malt here and it nice to get a slight hop bit at the end. A quirst-quencher and one you could probably put quite few down of..."
"Brilliantly clear blonde hue. Dense, dogged, porcelain white head leaves Belgian lace. Grassy hops meld with sweet, bready pilsner malt tones to lend a mellow, mowed lawn impression in aroma. Very clean. Clean, lightly doughy malt upfront in flavor is complemented by drying, permeating, but well integrated hop bitterness. Understated, sweetly grassy hop flavor mirrors that of the aroma. Trace earthy, hay like notes emerge mid palate, accentuating the crisp, dominant grainy dryness. Very well attenuated, and although nearly bone dry overall, the mouthfeel retains a supple viscosity conducive to easy quaffing. Finishes abrupt, with quickly fleeting notes of husk and sweet cracker. A quinessential German pilsner, with a concomitantly thirst inducing and satiating dryness. With a more pronounced hop flavor and a firmer malt backbone this would be outstanding. An immaculately crafted pilsner, nonetheless."
"Golden and clear in appearance. A big white head sits on top and stays quite well. The aroma is characterized by a lemony presence, along with a nice spicy hop twang and some smooth malt underneath. Spicy hops are the most present in the flavor, making themselves known all over the palate. Lots of sweet and grainy malt backs the hops up. I'm detecting just a little yeasty spiciness in the back, which is very nice. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall, this is pretty impressive for a pilsner. Nice job, Brooklyn! Thanks to francisweizen for this bottle!"
"This is a highly drinkable pilsner from brooklyn. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a thin white head. Not much malt in the aroma, but plenty of citrusy hops. Taste is pretty much the same. Wonderful hop character without being very bitter. Much cleaner in taste than the lager."
"Give me a gulp light golden color, almost fruity, grainy aromatics. Taste is very redolent of rye? A touch of fruity bread-dough mid-palate. The beer finishes mildly tangy, with a pleasant dose of hops and a kiss of sweet (again) rye flavor. A nice choice for pizza or perhaps a corned beef on RYE!? I wish we could get this in Chicago-it would be a hit. Thank you Bundy Brown for the sample bottle!!"
"I think the odd funkiness of pilsners is an aquired taste that I haven't quite aquired; I'd rather reach for a well-hopped IPA or a hefe.. but this is definitely drinkable, and the lack of skunk is a big plus."
"This is a good pilsner. Pours an uneven, white head, that fades quickly, but leaves a thin layer Looks clean and clear. It smells and tastes much the same. Exactly what you expect from a good pilsner, but better than average. Very crisp and highly drinkable."
"Best Before August of 2002, well so far this beer has held up the best of my sampler that includes the lager Pennant pale ale. So it pours an impressive crystal clear bright golden tone with high bubbly carbonation and a foaming white two finger sized head. The aroma contains some delicate floral hops and some Saaz some where up in there alon with a nice sweetness. The flavor is also sweet with a nice spicy kick of hops going on, wonderfully balanced and I can't believe this beer is still this good. If it didn't have a best before date this one would be fresh by my palate no off flavors at all. Well constructed resiliant lighter bodied beer with plenty of flavor to make this a classic representation of the style. Very drinkable just had a sub with one a little earlier very good food beer ex. pizza and beer."
"A crystal clear, lightly golden brew with a good, white,creamy head. It has a nice floral hoppy aroma that has a nice crips grassiness to it. The body is light, it's flavor is good, crisp toasty malt but only light, floral hops in the flavor and traditional dry, crisp finish. A decent summer quencher but could use a little more hop and malt flavor for my taste."
"Thanks stegmakk!"
"Well, this bottle must be one-off 'cause it definitely ain't straw, or clear, or gold. It is a hazy light amber with a one finger high off-white head and a little loose lacing. The nose is malt and the taste is, well, light and delightfully full of malt and an ending hop bitterness; slight notes of apricot in the warmed brew. Steady streams of small bubbles. Quite crisp and light bodied - typical of the style. But the look is not a typical clear, golden pilsener; no way, no how. Significant filmy bottom sediment."
"The Brooklyn Pilsner poured a very clear and bright golden color. A nice foamy head appeared and was fairly well-maintained throughout. Some loose lacing on the glass, as well. A nice malty scent was somewhat overshadowed by floral overtones. Very intriguing smell. The taste was very crisp and refreshing, a good balance of hops and malt, with a nice bitter bite near the end. A faint sample of lemon or citrus characteristic was also perceived. The light body could have been somewhat heavier, but was still very appropriate and fitting for the style, and made for a nice mouthfeel. This pilsner was a great thirst quencher; very crisp and inviting, simple yet well-balanced and refined. Definitely a good session drink or one to kick back with after a long day."
"Had a light floral nose, a little sweet and almost fruity. A very clean smell. Taste was of a light malt body with a crisp, quick, and clean bitterness. Slight buttery taste and finish, too. Had a fairly quick and dry finish, though it brought on the worst part: no other finishing flavor besides a bitterness that lingered. Didn't taste all too pleasant, especially the lurking lemon flavor thats a little too soapy for me, and the ill-tasting cloy it leaves."
"F."
"It's been quite some time since I last had a pilsner. This brew is certainly better than I remember them tasting. I suppose that's a good thing. Pours out a yellow gold color with a nice head. Tastes a bit fruity and very fresh. The bitter and the sweet are nicely balanced. Not quite good enough to ween me away from ales, but a nice brew for those lager lovers out there."
"A clear gold color and a bright white head tops of this larger. The head fades fast but leave a very thin lace. A hoppy aroma is present and sweet smell comes into play. Honey like. The taste is just as clean but there was not much of the aroma in the taste. There was a nice hint of hops on the finish. Nice mouth feel and drinkable. A good pils but it dint through me out of my shoes. This one is an average brew."
"Anice light malt aftertaste."
"Clear, golden in color with a fluffy bright white head that drops readily but keeps an OK collar and some whispy surface foam throughout the serving. The aroma is limited but offers some light floral hops and a clean, softly sweet maltiness. The body is light with a fine, gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth in the mouth. The flavor is well balanced with a lightly sweet & grainy malt against a grassy and lightly spicy hop flavor. The bitterness is restrained but backs up the malt that's there. It finishes fairly dry with just a minor lingering malt and some residual hop flavor. A pretty mainstream pilsner that exhibits some of the F.X. Matt house character. Somewhat dissapointing compared to the other beers in their bottle line-up."
"An average pils, but still curious. Slight hops, sweet, in the nose, which is present in the first sip. Good mouth feel, and good finish, again with the slight hops, sweet though. Good color, yellow, gold. Little head, but it stays through most of the glass. A little more body and a little more hop finish would make a world of difference. Would I have another one? If I ran out of Victory Pils, yeah, I guess so."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick pillowy white head that sticks around nicely and leaves a great lace all the way down the glass.  The smell is pleasantly hoppy with a spicy edge to it, but it also has a nice bit of sweetness in the background.  The first thing to hit the tongue is the sweetness of the adjuncts which is immediately followed by the spiciness of the hops.  The nice hoppy flavor fades towards the end however, first giving way to the seetness of the brew and then to a slightly metallic taste that finishes the brew.  The metallic quality definitely detracts from the brew and the strange finish makes the brew less refreshing and crisp than would be appropriate.  The brew still remains rather drinkable and would fit in nicely after a hot summer day of working in the yard."
"Pours a clear golden color, with a big thick white head that fizzes out quickly to a small lace. On the nose there is a very light grainy and fruit aroma. On the palate there is a sharp bitterness in the mouth feel, some lemon flavor, crisp carabonation, grainy, slight sweetness, slight fruity maltness, but pretty much all clean and refreshing.Semi-dry finish. Decent Pils"
"The color is very pale and head fades quickly but leaves nice lace. The aroma is malty, with some light fruit as is the flavor. Has a full mouthfeel...practically creamy. Smooth going down. A good beer."
"it was smooth and crisp and just right for a summer night. not a fantastic beer, but it is definitely one i may get again. light golden color in the pour. it was a good clean beer that was very drinkable"
"Bubbly golden yellow color, light carbonation. Compared to other beers of this style, I wasn't all that impressed, although it still was a good beer. Good taste with a malty finish."
"I like this beer more than others seemed to. Not sure what they don't like about it. My brother (definitely NOT a BA) tried this at the TAP New York beer festival and proclaimed, ""I could be happy drinking this for the rest of my life."" This is a solid, delectable pilsner that is not only refreshing but excellent at stimulating the appetite. Marries well with practically any food, pilsners being among the most versatile beer. Light golden color, frothy head that subsides, gentle hoppy aroma that manages to be both musky and clean. Excellent malts, light but substantial, and the hops bring it all home. I wish they sold this at the ball park. Hell, I wish they sold this at my local bar. Brooklyn is one of the country's top breweries and this beer is probably the best pilsner brewed in the U.S. -- strong words, but prove me wrong. If you like pilsners (and I'm guessing most BAs like something a bit meatier), this beer is for you."
"Light Golden in color, with slight head.  Some traces of bitter hops taste, and ever so faint malt character.  Very weak in flavor, but still better than just the flavored water which is an A-B macro."
"Clear golden color.  Nice foamy head with some retention.  Faint hops on the nose.  This beer is pretty void of taste.  There aren't any bad things of note however.  It's got a pretty light body.  The tastes that I do note are some pils malt and very,very slight hop bitterness.  The beer is pretty easy to drink.  This beer is better than the yellow fizzy macro counterparts, but not by much."
"Notes: 4.8%abv. I thoroughly enjoyed this interpretation of a pre-Prohibition German beer. Extremely flavourful, traditional, but made unique with an American crafted hand. Highly recommended as a standard beer to stock in the fridge."
