"O: This is one of the best, perhaps best pils I've ever had.  It will certainly become a benchmark for future reference."

"A beautiful pilsener seemingly unable to err."
"Wonderful clean, refreshing pilsner haven't found a better pils to date and each one seems better than the last!"

"Pours a bright clear pale yellow with a fluffy head of two fingers. Smell is not strong but well balanced on style with a hint of lemon. Tastes of malts and noble hops, which balance the sweetness. It is just delicious and goes down smoothly. Light to medium body and light carbonation, which makes for an exceptional drinkability. You could down a liter in less than you say good morning. What a simple deliciousness, yet world class beer. Up there with Weihenstephaner as the best Pilsner i have had."

"Great pils! One of the best I've had. From a 500 ml. can into a pilsner glass. Poured a nice fluffy and white bubbly head; yellow-gold color, typical for this style. Sticky lace on the glass; a nice cream ring around the edges. Smelled like citrus, light spice, peppery, and some malted barley grains. At first it is a bit sweet on my palate, but it finishes dry, slightly bitter, and peppery. There is a little lemon zest in there as well. It finishes smooth and crisp; balanced and light, yet fulfilling. Overall, this is a great German pils. It is especially great for an end-of-summer brew. Sad to see the transition into fall."

"08/16/12 On Tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. A tad bitter, but not a distraction. Full bodied & bready on the tongue w/some herb/spice in the aroma. Solid character but a bit weighty for a session, Definitely worth a place at the table."
"A light but hop forward German pils."
""
""
""
"For a pilsner, you can't get much better than this.  Full bodied mouth feel, touch of cream but crisp, clean finish.  Don't have to wait for a hot day to drink. Solid on its own but great with food."
""
"Very good pils. There's been a new push towards session beers, but pils has always been the original great hoppy session beer."

"The best widely available German Pilsner. The real deal, great with some burgers off the grill or some charcuterie and fromage. I wish they would bring in kegs so we could drink it on tap. Unfortunately for the most part US craft brewers feel the need for too many hops or too much malt to make a classic session style German Pilsner"

"I consider an excellent pils like this a highly underated beer in a land flowing with mediocre to horrible lagers, and overpriced over ABV'd microbrews. This is the beer you need when you want a beer that goes right down the middle in excellent form."

"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. Will keep a six pack of this on hand for guests or on hot days for myself. I would assume that as far as pilsners available in the US, this would be a top one."
"O - The best example of an available, imported German pilsner anywhere in North America. The only German pilsners that would be as good, IMHO, are from SW Germany and generally cannot be found here. So...Prost Kamerad !!"

"O: i love pilseners, and i love Konig -- there isn't a thing wrong with this brew, and it's one i'll be going back to often"
"330ml bottle. Footed Pilsner glass. Straw color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, close & lasting head. Hints of honey, pale malt, grain, slight floral to the nose, as well as slight underlying sulphur. Crispy & malty upfront followed by clean bitterness. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Watery. Floral bitterness lingers & provides bitter finish. Dried, refreshing & easy drinkable. Nice spot of the German Pilsner style."
"Overall: pretty much a perfect example of a German Pilsner: pale gold, moderately hopped, balanced, bready undertones, hop bitterness without a ton of hop aroma. Easy to drink and enjoy."
""
"O: This is a really nice, well hopped pilsner. I'd like it a lot more if it weren't quite so skunky and simplistic (even by pils standards). Still, a worthy offering."
""

"Awesome beer!"

"O -- My German friends will call this a ""macro"" to them, but it's hardly fair to stand this up against any U.S. macro. This is a terrific, to-style Pilsner that doesn't disappoint."

"A fine German Pilsner, very refined. Crystal clear, light straw-gold body beneath a massive head of white that offers excellent retention and lacing. The aroma offers a mild blend of straightforward Pilsner malt and soft, smooth noble hops. It's subtly floral with a hint of lemongrass in its mainly grassy character. Although the bitterness is there from the beginning, it doesn't really make itself known until midway, and then it bows out, simply stepping aside to make up the background of the finish. It's quite nicely rounded and polished to the point of being remarkably drinkable. Absolutely worth trying, particularly if you can find it on tap."

"Konig Pilsener was my introduction to the world of real Pilsner beers. I gathered with friends and enjoyed many wonderful nights at 50/50's in Erlangen Germany, where It always had Konig Pilsener on tap. It has a strong pilsener smell and bitter taste. There is a very nice head coming off the tap. Very Easy to drink. Good color. I've tried bottles a couple times and it is still good, but not the same. Enjoy."

"Pours a brilliantly clear, very pale yellow color with a thin white head. Very high apparent carbonation. Aroma is very clean, with mild noble hop aroma and slight sulfur. Taste is very clean, hop bitterness right up front that lingers nicely, fading to a crisp, dry finish. High carbonation, very smooth. Overall this is a classic example of a German Pilsner. Hoppy, clean, crisp, and refreshing. Perfect summer beer. Will definitely have again."

"KÃ¶nig Pilsener ---3/5."
" Overall, this beer is pretty much what I expect from a pilsner, though I would prefer more hop aroma and flavor. It's worth a try, but there are other pilsners out there that I would drink first."

"Overall: This is a great German pilsener- one that takes malts and hops and balances them nicely. Much better than other 'pilsener' style beers out there, and certainly a nice beer when one is searching for something a little less insane in the malt/hop department."
"*This can is fresh enough (B.B.D.: 11/13-2013), so either my memory of this beer's excellent Hop-forward quality is off (and I had mistakenly-remember Krombacher for this!) or the recipe or hop regimen used has been mellowed, or maybe the hops were just flacid-in-the-Alpha-acids in this batch. Who really knows? Jever this is not at any rate, and it's still a slightly better than average beer for its style. NOW, go getcha some!"

"A refreshing German Beer. Poured to a classic golden straw hue with perfect clarity. Head developed to a frothy white which laced and lasted. Aroma was of hop, malt and grass. Taste was of malt with hints of hop and grain. Nice full mouthfeel with a clean aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The rock of Gibraltar of Pilsener beers. Smooth, tasty, classic Pilsener taste. Beautiful light gold color. Refreshing. Just drink it quickly...don't linger over it."
""
"O: This was a great beer and very nice for the style. Perfect for the patio on a hot summer day. It had all of the qualities I enjoy in a good pils and it made for an enjoyable experience. I wish this beer was more easily obtainable."
""
""
""
"One of the best German Pils brought into the U.S., both on draft and when fresh in bottles. Pours straw/golden with virtually no haze into my 0.5L mug. Glorious carbonation and good size and retention of contrasting white head. Nose is clean, light, lemony, with a whiff of herbal elements. Palate has a great combination of rather clean malty flavors and delightful herbal hoppy flavors to balance things nicely. No skunk. Zero. Finish is more of the herbal hops. Incredibly easy drinking and a great example of the style as far as what we have for options here in the U.S."

"It's a very fine German pilsner."
"O: A solid pilsner that certainly has its sweet spot in the finish. The price is right there with most other German imports, worth a pick up for fans of the style."
""
""
""
"This beer stands out in that it does not have the sticky sweet or metallic taste that accompanies too many pileners."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a transparent straw color with perfect clarity, topped by only the faintest whisp of a white head. Aroma is mild and primarily skunky, with a very vague sweetness and hop essence. The flavor is similar to the nose--faint and unappealing. This tastes like beer in the most generic sense of the term. There's a mild honeyed malt flavor on the front end and some hop bitterness in the finish, but those are the closest things to defined flavors I can discern. The rest is just a wash of what I would normally associate with a ""light"" beer. Yet another Pilsner that leaves me scratching my head as to the merits of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: For some reason, perhaps the lemon taste in this brew, seafood really feels the best option."
""
""
""
""
"O - I've had better imported pilseners but this is worthy to try again. In the warmer weather this could really hit the spot."

"RJT"
"Overall a really nice pilsener."
""
""
""
""
"It pours a clear, yellowish amber color with a foamy white head. The aroma has that classic pilsner scent. The texture is decent with an ok flavor. This is a fairly weaker in taste than most German Pilsners. The use of malts and hops are very difficult to find in the flavor, as there seems to be more of a raw grainy taste. Drinks smooth and easy, however there are better German made pilsners on the market."
""
""
""
"Spicy noble hops up front along with sweet pale malts. Grassy, wheaty, slight caramel, lemony, touch of black pepper. Crisp, refreshing and dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is better than the last one I reviewed, which was in a bottle. I think the other one I had (5 years ago) might have been a little out of whack. This time its more like a German Pilsener should be."
""
"Price Point - $5.99/ 4pk 16.9 oz cans"
""
""
"A decent, slightly above average pilsener, but nothing extraordinary."
"O: Disappointed in this brew. Definitely not a bad pilsner, just runs on the light side of what I enjoy."
""
"Overall, I think I would only have this at a party where pilsners were served."
""
""
""
"A classic golden pilsner with about 1 finger of head that settles quickly with a nice lacing. A distinct aroma of grains with a slight hint of citrus. This is a very good tasting beer for the style. I taste perfectly malted grains. None of the skunk that I normally get with the mass market German or Dutch lagers. Probably the best of the German Pilsners I've tried. I really appreciate the creamy texture which is rare for a pilsner style. This is my new go to Pilsner. I wish that I'd found it sooner."
""
""
""
""
"Outside of the smell, this is a world class pils."
""
"Very authentic. Not the greatest but certainly up there!"
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a 1/2 inch fizzy off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grass, and some grape-like fruity aromas. Taste is of grain, grape juice, grape jelly, and a grassy and herbal finish. There is a very mild bitterness that sits right on top of the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pilsener that is very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall: tasty and very refreshing; a real, authentic Pilsner. Extremely quaffable, I'd be glad to have this again."
"Pours a toasted straw with loose, white foam and lots of bubbles in the glass (dirty glass?). Anywho, the effect is pretty. Smells of sweet grain and a hint of noble hops. Classic and pleasant. Lovely pils with good grain and sweet corn hints followed with a bit of bitter subtlety. Thin with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. Good beer."
""
""
"O- Although not a huge fan of German Lagers, this is really nice and well put together! Really looking forward to working out in the yard this spring with a few dozen of these!"
""
"O: A beer made to be drinkable. Quite light body with a nice mild bitterness. Germans do simple beer very well..."
""
"This beer is, in a word, clear. While all the flavors were mild, they were very distinct. I wish I had more descriptors to use, but I couldn't really pin anything down with a good comparison. There was nothing clouding these distinct flavors, they came through clear as a bell. While I like the taste and mouthfeel, I still think there is a little something lacking. Perhaps I had it too cold, I don't know. A great Pilsener none the less."
""
""
"O- Overall decently flavourful, with some subtle notes showing up and a bit of complexity. Not that refreshing or very well balanced though, and i'm again blaming that metallic bitterness for this"
"I love this beer - and I'm not just saying that because it was being sold at my local grocer in 500ML can four-packs (that's two liters of actual european pilsner beer people!) for the princely sum of $4.57. Let me try to explain why this beer rocks: it rocks because it has something other lesser beers typically lack. It has staying power. By that I mean it goes down extremely well on the first luscious gulp, but continues to go down just like that throughout the whole half-liter can. Very few beers manage to achieve that. And for me, it has one of the best combinations of taste and ""refrenshing-ness"" (if I can coin a term) that I have ever experienced in a pilsner. So, to summarize: go out and get this beer and see for yourself if it isn't really pleasing. I'm pretty confident you'll agree."
"This is a classic. The flavors are everything I look for in German Pils, and the drinkability if very nice. Price is excellent for an import. Really just hard to beat the value of this beer. I recommend buying the cans though (or on draft), as bottles are usually skunked, even with the brown glass."

"Pours pale straw yellow with a finger and a half thick white cloud of a head which dissipates to a foam ring with fine layered lacing. Few carbonation bubbles can be seen flowing up the whole time you're drinking this one. Smell is to the herbal-citrusy end on the hops, with biscuity-corny malts. Bitter lemon and maybe a little anise. Taste is like a lemongrass-infused butter with fresh-cracked pepper on wheat toast. A slight medicinal hop note on the finish, along with more of that sweet, sweet grain. Mouthfeel is picture-perfect; medium-bodied, buttery, and evaporating off your tongue. If you know anybody who swears by Beck's, Amstel, or Heineken, hand 'em one of these and wait for them to ask where they can get more. A true Platonic ideal of a beer and a pleasure to session."
"Watchin' Jeopardy! and drinkin' German brews. Good times. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light grass, and light flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, though the wheat is definitely the star here, the flowers relegated to the background scenery. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp feel. Overall, a good, solid pils. 'Nuff said."
""
"O: Decent Pils and I am glad I tried it. I do not need to have another though."
""
""
""
"I brought a 500ml can of Konig Pilsner home from a recent trip to Europe. The beer pours a clear pale yellow color with a white head that dissapates quickly. In the aroma is typical of most Pilsners....saaz hop with hint of sweet malt. The taste is grainy/barley with watery malt. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean aftertaste and decent carbonation. Overall its typical, but drinkable."

"I thought it was a good representation of this classic beer style."
"Overall Drinkability - Possibly the worst german pilsner I've had. Maybe it's just a bad bottle, but without a date there's no way I can tell."
"O- Easily the best green bottle pilsner I've had yet."
"Lovely presenting beer, perfect pale gold, creamy head. Noble hoppy nose with hints of bitterness (yes on the nose) and mild grassiness. Assertive bitterness on the palate, but herbal, spicy hopiness and clean background pilsner malt. The beer was somewhat softer on tap, whereas the bottled version seems more robust (maybe just not as fresh). Either way supremely drinkable! While a few steps off the best pilsners out there, it really is a great beer."
"Overall, I really like this beer. I'm keeping the can."
"O- Overall I enjoyed this one. Subtle and simple but flavorful and refreshing at the same time."
"Just a hair sweeter than I like in the flavor, but great on the whole, with very nice hop flavor and bitterness in the finish."
"Overall: Spot on classic Pilsner in my book. The earthy hops aren't to my tastes, but work well here and are true to style. Would work better with a meal than on its own."
"Overall good mix of dry crispness, malt/baked white bread, and hop bitter. Very solid."
"Flavor is similar. Good blend of sweet malt while hop bitterness hits the sides of the tongue. Finish is super clean, grain lingers for a nice time. Really nice pilsener."
"Pale gold and crystal clear. Modest white head (about one finger) that becomes a thin film and then a ring. Lacing is minor perhaps due to glass washed in the dishwasher. Aroma is grainy with a spot of flowery hops. Taste is very clean malts, with some moderately bitter euro hops. Mouthfeel is good with medium carbonation. It has a mildly dry bitter finish. A perfect easy drinking summer Pils."
"O- I like a good German Pilsener and this certainly is one. All I can really say in criticism, is that the mouthfeel detracts from this otherwise fantasic beer. I would definitely down a few of these in the hot, Australian summer- and not feel guilty about it one bit."
"Notes: Light in body, yet very balanced, this pils is one of the cleanest beers I have ever tasted. At the price, it's one of the best Pilseners for the money. It's extremely easy to drink, and may be a new Summer standard."
"Overall a solid pils. I have been really into German lagers lately. So far I think my fav is spaten optimator."
"An overall delicious European/German Pilsener that is great to find, a regular ""go to"" beer that won't set you back on price either and totally enjoyable all the way through."
"O: This is a pretty average lager, it reminds me of Wernesgruner Pils. I would place the more common Beckâs as better than this beer."
"QUITE GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overal a solid pils, one of the better that I have had, but still a pils."
"Spot on as far as texture and consistency, this is an easy drinking pilsener that I would return to with pleasure. A great example and representation of this style. Also a good case study in keeping a German pils fresh from brewery to consumer."
"After enduring a slow start, this pils turns out to be an adequately quaffable example of the style, if a bit staid and underwhelming in the effort."
"Tastes like a pilsener should; clean, easy drinking and fresh. Perfect on a warm day with some barbeque and friends. Simple and smooth."
"Delicate with soft, grainy pils malt and grassy bitterness. Perhaps as lightly colored as non-adjunct beer can get, pale straw and clear filtered with a white head that hits the mark. More grass, lemon, black pepper from the hops. Super dry and refreshing. A fantastically subtle beer. I can only imagine what a treat this would be close to the source."
"Notes: Lots of flavor but the flavors are out of balance. Good on them for trying though, it's not a weak beer by any means. Cheers."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, or lack there of, a faint sweet malt. In the taste, watery with a small malt. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean aftertaste. Thin, watery, and nothing exciting."
"Pretty good Euro/German Pilsner. Good beer for everyday drinking during summertime."
"While not super-exciting, I'm hard pressed to find fault with this beer either - a clean supremely easy-drinking example of the style. Great on a warm evening."
"Clear, bubbly straw colored pour, white head and no lacing. Smell is kinda malty, and crisp, but not very pronounced. Taste is crisp with a bit of hops and some biscuity breads. Light, crisp, carbonated feel. Drinkability is good. Its refreshing and not a bad german pils in the end!"
"Well balanced, although the hops come in a touch late. The malt profile is sweet but pleasantly unrefined, with a coarse dough and bread note. Hops are tinged with citrus and spice and represent the style well. Mouthfeel is thin at times but not too detrimental. This is extremely drinkable overall and is worth picking up if you enjoy the style in the slightest."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer overall, but not the best example of it's style. I would drink this again, but would not be my first choice."
"D: Considering the prize; this is a nice German Pilsener."
"Pours a clear pale yellow, with blue green highlights (likely from the glass). Smell is of light sulfur and fresh bread dough. Taste is light crackery malts up front, with a hint of citrus, followed by a bread like middle, and a spicy, floral hop finish. Good bitterness levels. Mouthfeel is average, slightly high carbonation. Very good drinkability, light and refreshing, but still packed with some flavor."
"Light and refreshing. Eminently drinkable."
"This is extraordinary swill beer happiness. If I was a benevolent socialist dictator, I would heavily subsidize this style of beer so that my common masses would not have to succumb to the usual American macro suspects."
"I like this brew, i like the style as well so. drink up"
"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp, sweet, malts, a touch of bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall a good quality brew."
"Not bad, but not very exciting either."
"330ml bottle poured into Koenig glass. Two finger head, clear, pale colour. Faint hoppy smell. Crisp dry pils. Not easy on the palate. Lots of fiz. This beer is interchangeable with warsteiner, krombacher etc. Standard german pils. It's decent, wouldn't want more than 3 as its so dry."
"This is by far one of the best beers of the style I have ever had. Pours golden yellow in color with crisp carbonation. Noses shows some malts and hops. Flavor is beautiful mix of good malts up front almost presenting a buttery presence and firm hops on the back end creating strong bitter and drying sensation. Quite and enjoyable sensation. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and well balanced. This beer is supremely drinkable and one you wish you could go all nite long with its just so balanced and so beautiful. One of the best pilsners I have ever had the privilege to try. I use to be someone who didnt understand that lagers could too be so supreme as a good ale but as i learned more of beer and found beers like this I learned just what a great pilsner could be. World class beer and one that is perfection in its style."
"D: Very drinkable. Good representation of the style."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A very drinkable pils. I could see myself having several of these in a sitting."
"D: The beer is very light and refreshing; I could easily drink several of these in a single sitting."
"A prototypical German pilsner. Nothing too outstanding on any level, but the metallic finish is a bit of a turn-off. I realize I may be drinking this past its prime, but am doubtful it has much more to offer when fresh."
"I mean, Woody Allen gave it an A+, just read below. I think he was in the Orgasmatron at the time."
"My glugging pour, following a loud Crack!, produced a finger of fluffy, bone-white head floating atop the beer like clouds drifting overhead. Color was a pale lemon-yellow color with NE-plus clarity that would make any BMC drinker weep for this level of clarity. No boostin'! Nose was Saaz hops to the max! GER Pilsener?!? Not by my reckoning! Bohemian/Czech Pils, more like. I could weep for what Prohibition resulted in for us. AALs are the worst! Mouthfeel was silky with a big, soft hops flavor, like spearmint, on the tongue. Shazam, but this was fantastic! I got some maltiness, but hops were king here. Finish was literally breathtaking. If you have ever smoked a menthol cigarette, you will understand. This was clean, minty, slightly malty, but very dry. Wow! Finish lingered with a minty hoppiness. There was no question that this was hop-driven, but I wonder how well they would have held up in a bottle. This is one instance where I CAN encourage CANphobic drinkers to give a King a chance. I am pushing things around in my cooler to make room even as we speak. See you on the beach!"
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. Straw colored with a rapidly fading 2 fingers of white head. A note of spiciness on the nose but only just. A harbinger of doom. Very very watery. Oh wait, the head is now completely gone after one minute. A hop bitterness that lingers for maybe 15 seconds. Not much going on at all. Very light for style. Maybe my least favorite German Pils I've had. Perhaps the beer the American Adjuncts were modeled after?"
"Drink - A decent pilsner for sure, but there better options in the category."
"Drinkability: Oh, yes! The 330ml bottle was just too little for me. Felt more like a sampler. I would definitely drink it again."
"D - It's good but not a stand out Pilsner for me."
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt, served in a 0.5 liter pilsner glass. Golden and perfectly clear, topped by two inches of sudsy white foam that recedes to a collar in a few minutes. The nose is clean and bright, pilsner malt dominant over the subtle noble hop aroma. It's simple but clean. Crisp and crackery on the tongue with a firm bitterness, this is faintly mineral and faintly hoppy. Clean and perfectly enjoyable, but it doesn't particularly stand out amongst German pilsners. It finishes with a firm bitterness that's herbal in character. I enjoyed my glass, but I've had a few better pilsners recently."
"All around a top example of the style, as it's made KÃ¶nig one of my standard German Pilsners."
"the color of urine with a nice gentle fizz and a nice head. nose if of straw like hops and apples... bitterness blends to be a nice floral pollen that is very subdued. this is a sharper pilsner. but not heavy at all. very nice malt... and with the style if you maintain a brisk quality its pretty consistent. still had better but a nice surprise."
"Humdrum doesn't imply bad, it implies boring and forgettable. German brewing culture says there's nothing wrong with being ordinary and conventional - if anything it encourages it - but it does insists you do it well. KÃ¶nig's made the first right move by sticking to the Reinheitsgebot but now they've got to up the Gerstenmalz and Hopfen a little."
"Mild flavor, a little bitter at the back. Pilsner malt in the front, its easy drinking and mild. Not much to say. Its worth a dollar, not much else."
"Drinkability: Tastes too much like Euro Lager for my palate to get much enjoyment out of this"
"Pours a nice golden color that is clear and crisp with a one and a half finger head which gives way to skim with some decent lacing. The aroma is of some citrus notes with a grass like backbone. The taste is crisp of a pilsner malt backbone with a grassy hop bite. The mouthfeel is low to moderate carbonation. Overall it is a very drinkable pilsner with a nice crisp taste and finish."
"This beer is a little too light for my taste. It was very refreshing after a hot afternoon of honey-do yard work."
"I do not drink a lot of pilsners, but this is the best pilsner that I have had to date."
"The bottled version is a bit drier than I seem to think the can and tap versions are, but that might be my memory going funny again? They are all 4.9% ABV so most likely are the one and the same before being put into the container."
"Overall, this is one of the cleanest lagers I've had to date, and one of the better German pilsners I've had as well. I think without this last pilsner run I've been doing the past few weeks, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate this beer as much as I did. Definitely worth a try, especially if you're into pilsners."
"D: This would make a good lawn mowing beer -- very light, crisp and refreshing. But I'd likely want to move on to something with a bit more substance."
"Very light golden our with a rich white head. Floral grassy aroma with a citrusy backdrop. Taste is light with an earthy, grainy start and an eventual lemony kick before some nice bitter hops take over. Remarkably well-rounded brew. Definitely one of the better pils that i have had (and easily the best I have had in a can), but still behind my favorite, Prima Pils."
"If you see it on tap go for it! A very, very good pilsner in my book."
"D: I found this beer to be very drinkable and quite refreshing. One of the best pilsners I've tried. While not the best, it is definitely a great example of what a pilsner should be. Obviously underrated, as I've never even heard of this one. I would buy it again."
"I had this on tap at Kendall's Brassiere in Downtown Los Angele's, California. The I spy beer does not allow for restaurants."
"All around, a solid Pilsener and German beer in general. Might not be the best, but runs close. Far better than the average mass-produced swill."
"The mouthfeel is excellent. Crisp and bubbly carbonation mixes with a nice soft and smooth body. Very pleasing and quite easily drinkable. Yes I've had better pilsners but this one is solid and underrated if you ask me. I saw it at a bar for $2 a can because they couldn't sell any. Good luck for me because this is a solid brew."
"Taste is lots of grainy malts with a bit of a husky flavor. Hopping is pretty mild with most of the contributions coming in the form of a light bittering finish. Not the cleanest pilsener out there, but packs quite a bit of flavor compared to many German pilseners. Good beer that can disappear fast from the fridge if not careful."
"It's a great pilsener, maybe better out of the can too which is rare."
"D: This beer pretty much packs everything I look for in this style. It's light, balanced and easy drinking. It has just enough complexity to keep me going back to my glass, and the low ABV makes me wish I had more on hand."
"This has to be one of the most potently flavored pilsners around."
"Overall this isn't that bad of a Pilsner, is very drinkable, and I'd drink again if given the chance."
"It truly tastes like I thought it would. No surprise and no great find. An enjoyable Pilsener and I would probably get it again if there was no other choices worth trying."
"Not that great of a beer. Carbonation is there but it's a bit flat either on tap (at Huettenbar in Chicago) or from a can. Off color metallic flavors are up front in this beer. You really have to keep chugging it to avoid the emergence of a straw flavored, skunky aftertaste. I can't see how anyone would rave about this or give it more than a C+. It's German but it has that crappy stale Dutch beer flavor of Heineken or Amstel. Many better German beers are available: Bitburger, Stiegl, Spaten, Wurzburger, Hofbrau..."
"Poured into a pilsner glass it produces a 1 inch head that leaves slight lacing. The appearance is golden and clear. The aroma is of grassy hops and slight malt. The taste is dry and slightly bitter with some maltiness. The feel is smooth and the finish clean. This is a very enjoyable and drinkable pilsner."
"D: Too salty to drink several but i liked the cask of this beer i bought."
"Mouthfeel is snappy with the hops, softening with some fizz. Decent drinker -- the dryness actually takes a bit out & is a little challenging on the tongue for such a tight little beer. Not bad."
"D - Overall this is a good beer light and refreshing with a good taste that's worth a try sometime"
"Drinkability: More than solid example of a light, dry German Pils. While not as bitter as some (although still quite dry), it is very well balanced and I could see drinking a decent amount of this if available."
"D-An excellent German Pilsner...could pair nicely with a Turkey dinner"
"Pours a clear pale golden color with a nice white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma of grassy hops with some malt. Taste is again grassy hops with a bready flavor and a bit of honey. Thin body with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall this is a pretty solid German Pilsner that is very drinkable. I'll definitely try this again next summer."
"Body is slightly watery, but at least the carbonation is not extreme."
"if you like a good lager this one is pretty good, would be perfect on a hot day"
"Overall there was nothing here that really blew me away but on the other hand there are really no weaknesses here. Worth a shot."
"A budget beer definitely above the average. Some odd flavours but still an enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and easy, with a rolling effervescence that remains just inside the radar. This is a very basic yet solid German pilsener, just not as complex or interesting as other big names out there."
"Pours a crystal clear gold with a nice fluffy white head. Very active beer...lots of carbonation in the glass. A crisp, clean malt and noble hop aroma is coming off this beer. A very nice pilsner aroma. There is an excellent hop flavor that is balanced very well with the malts. It's a simple beer, but very flavorful with a nice floral quality from the hops. The mouthfeel is just about right. Nice and light and the carbonation helps fill it out. A clean, dry finish that really makes you go back for more. This is as drinkable as it gets. A nice aroma, clean, crisp flavor and a finish that makes you want to take another sip."
"A brilliiantly clear, light, straw colored beer with minimal head. Aroma is a husky, grainy, citrusy, and toasty. This pils tastes clean and perfect, nothing extreme, but superbly balanced with the decoction/malty backbone against a slightly skunky hop backround. A touch of malt sweetness lingers and then is cut off by a hop bite to finish. Nice and dry. The medium body and strong carbonation join together to make this beer supremely drinkable. This beer is darn tasty, and quite a value for me at about 21 bucks a case. Any pilsner fan should pick this one up."
"D: An excellent pils, one I will revisit often"
"Recommended"
"One of the better German Pils, and better than the well advertised competition. I measure Pils by Prima and this one isn't that good, but it's still a nice light tasty Pils. Priced right, nice for the pool or beach given you can get in in the can. I just hate a brew that can't maintain it's head and this one does that too, tastes pretty good lame head. But worth a try."
"D - all day long, I really enjoyed this beer."
"D - I have had better pilsners, this seems relatively weak in taste and body. Also, the overly perfumy aftertaste is a bit of a put off."
"Light bodied with low carbonation. Goes down pretty easy, though I think I would have liked a little bit more fizz."
"It was the only beer available at a wine bar we visited in Berlin. Good color and good clean flavor overall but nothing to write home about. Certainly better than becks and not too disappointing when it's the only choice. I would recommend this in general."
"Pretty decent appearance. Of course, pilsners don't really produce anything all too interesting. Nose is pretty simple, but not empty. Really distinctive flavor. The floral tone really adds some uniqueness. Nice balance with the malt and yeast. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"12oz bottle. Pours clear gold with a fluffy white cap that lasts. Pleasant bouquet of grainy malt and soft grassy hops. The taste is a bit fainter, with the malt character much weaker. Though the grassiness is all but lost, the hop bitterness comes through and makes it quite dry. Light-medium body with medium carbonation. A decent pils."
"Konig Pilsner poured a very pale gold with a nice white head and very good lacing. The smell was faint, with hints of hops. The taste was a nice sweet malt with a good hop back. Mouthfeel was good, and this beer show very good drinkability. Over all I found this to be a very nice pilsner. Good summer beer."
" easy drink."
"I was very pleasantly surprised to find this beer to be so good for so little. I'll have to have some people over to finish it off before it goes flat/stale in the fridge."
"This is a beer I could go for any day. It's not too complex, but not boring either... HIGHLY DRINKABLE!"
"Well, this seems like it would be a very easy beer to pound. I'd give it a 5, but there's two sides to drinkability. It gets a 1 on the enjoyment scale. It's a pretty boring beer, and doesn't hold my interest long enough to drink more than one bottle. That averages out to a 3."
"Low-key finish and carbonation that doesnt hold. Insincerely malty aftertaste that makes you really not want another sip."
"Drinkability is good. An amazing pilsner. Price is good, and this can be paired with a large variety of food."
"Overall, this tastes okay, but I don't see myself buying it again."
"So is this pilsener triple-hops brewed too? Because it's actually a pilsener and not Miller Lite. Very dry taste with a smooth drinkable body. Solid."
"Drinkability: I wish this was the bud light people love. This should be the rock bottom standard for beer. This pilsener kicks ass and hopefully with america slowly turning to craft beer - the giants may someday make better beer too. Drink this beer when beer needs to be drank."
"great beer even with the weird flaky floaty things that arent supposed to be there!"
"This beer poured a straw-color with a single-finger head and lots of visible carbonation. The smell is floral hops with a tiny bit of citrus. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that gives way to some understated citrusy hops that last until the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly watery but the carbonation makes for a crisp beer. A tasty beer that goes down real easy, this is great beer for any occasion."
"Pours a clear gold with a great head and nicely active carbonation. Lots of nice pilsener aromas that feel very natural: a raw honey sweetness with grassy and lemony hops. This beer is packed with all the tastes that its aromas promised and has a good crispness. I love it when it when a pilsener refuses to play it bland and instead is infused with character. This is a terrific beer, the whole of which is greater than the sum of its parts."
"A very pale yellow with a fluffy head that very quickly dissapates into nothing. Not much lacing to speak of either. A floral hoppy lift on the nose that suggest a pretty good pils and a good upfront palate. Unfortunately falls away a little at the back with not much finish to speak of. Subtle bitterness. Not the best pils going round by any means but not the worst either."
"D- An ok brew that was just a little spicier than I was expecting. Mediocre overall."
"Pours out a straw yellow color with a nice bright white head with nice lacing. Smells of spices, malt, and a floral tone. Taste is kind of spciy for a german pils, but very nice. NIce light malt background with a crisp light citrus hops. Kind of an off taste to it, but it's a nice clean beer. Very mild, easy to drink, plenty carbonation for a pils. Ok, but there's better."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with some prickly carbonation. Solid all-around."
"Pours a pissy macro-ish yellow. Head dissipates quickly. Smells very ""crisp"". Malty, floral, some hints of pear. Taste is similar, but much stronger. It's bready and floral and, like I said earlier, crisp. Slightly bitter finish; the fruitiness is more obvious on the aftertaste. This one strikes a balance between the relatively flat but refreshing lawn-mower beer, and a more advanced ale or lager. Very good!"
"Pours a very clear light pale with an average white head and light lacing. Smells of adjuncts and just a whiff of Saaz. First sip is extremely light with the malt dominating the light hops. Not much hop presence but then again...there is not much malt presence either. Spot on in style in every respect. Grab your lawnmower."
"This is in all ways a solid pils...nearly great, even. There is enough delicate balance to make this almost endlessly drinkable. The price point ($12/12pack) doesn't hurt either."
"Drinkability - I could down a couple of these but I'd rather look at and smell 'em."
"Pours a clear yellow gold with a thin white head. Nose is a lot of cereal sweetness. Flavor is a mix of sweet tones and grain character. Smooth, but no vast complexities. It's straightforward, and that's it. Feel has a bit of a bite on the carbonation and the liquid is thinner as you'd expect. This is an easy drinking pilsner. Like I said, it's straightforward and that's that."
"Nicely balanced and very drinkable, this is a perfect session beer and a great example of the dry, sharp German pilsener style."
"A nice enough ""classsic"" pils. The slight metallic sharpness was a detractor for me though. Still, a solid pils!"
"Perhaps I got a less than ideal bottle, so maybe I'll come back to this and experience what this beer really wanted to do to my tastebuds."
"D- Like any good pilsener, a good session"
"A reasonable choice to quench a thirst"
"Far more body than it looks, I'd say it's a shade above light bodied. Nice, soft mouthfeel. No conflict on the way in or down, I could make a nice session out of these. Bet it would be great with some light fish like Tilapia, and with about any mett/brat with kraut out there. Very nice surprise here. I had a crack or two lined up in my head, but got a humbling reminder of the book and its cover lesson."
"D: This is a nice one overall. Not terribly complex, but nicely executed and well balanced."
"I will sample again in a few weeks."
"This was a great surprise found at a German bar that my girfriend and I went for lunch last week. No specific notes, as I went in expecting to just be drinking Paulaners. But when one of the regulars recomended the Konig Pils to her, I ended up tasting and then enjoying one myself. Mushc more malt character than most Pils. perfect to wash down the curried bratwrust and spatzle!"
"Pretty good beer. Has a very bitter, beery, hoppy nose. Pale gold color, nice white head with some lace. Good carbonation. Quite bitter flavor too. A bit thin though. In the finish it seems watery. Still, it's refreshing and nice that it's not sweet. Session beer"
"I must admit after seeing its overall score I did expect more than this delivered."
"Drinkability: OK at best, but, let's face it, there are better pilseners to be had!"
"D - easy to drink, abv and taste wise."
"Very nice light beer. I poured mine up in a standard tall pilsener glass and was treated to a light golden transparent brew that built little head and left almost no lacing. It looks like a pilsener, but drinks more like a helles, lacking a real hop presence even on the finish. The nose is mostly understated malt, and the flavor is rather non-complex, basically matching the aroma. The overall mouthfeel if fresh and crisp, with a nearly perfect level of carbonation. I could drink several of these over a long late afternoon with friends in the waning sunshine."
"I'd say its an excellent example of the style. Jane would say, ""Who doesn't like beer?"""
"Sitting in a beer garden by the spree on a sunny day in Berlin, anything is going to taste nice, but I stand by this review. A great pilsner."
"Crisp, refreshing and plenty drinkable."
"Light yellow macro like color with a quickly fading head.Aroma is skunk that most German Pilseners seem to have.Taste is a mix of skunk and grape.In my opinion not impressive but somebody who likes this style probably would disagree.This is not something I would get again in the future!!"
"D: Overall a very good clean malt bill highlighting a true to style german pilsner with a very good drinkability factor."
"Overall not a bad pilsner, just a little average and bland for me. Not terrible though by any means and a good representation of the style, just needs a little bit more life to it."
"not too bad."
"Overall - The lack of fruity hops is disappointing. This tastes more like a premium lager than a pilsener to me."
"D- A very tasty and drinkable beer, but I am not a huge pilsner fan personally."
"This is by far on the best cheap beers I've had, at at only $2.19 for a tall can, this is a great value."
"Very tasty and drinkable beer here a very balanced and flavorful German Pilsener. A beer I can recommend."
"The taste is fruity grain, apple, and honey, giving a light fruity-honey sweetness that is just dominated by the bitter herbal-pine hops."
"Re-Review: Either I massively overrated this beer to begin with, or it's just not the beer it used to be. A decent pilsener, but nothing too special."
"I tried this beer on October 18, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a very pale gold colour with a large foamy white head which quickly disappeared. The aroma was a combination of citrusy hops with some grainy backup. The mouthfeel was this, slightly watery, with ample carbonation. The flavour was slighty hoppy and a little bitter."
"Not too bad. It's light and refreshing, yet still has some flavor and character."
"I had this really cold and it's already hot here in Texas, so it went down in less than five minutes. Drinkability is off the charts and I'm getting a case tomorrow. A great everyday drinking beer ..."
"D: this is a great german pils. Nothing fancy, just solid, well brought-out flavours and a clean, crisp taste making this beer very refreshing. Very, very easy to drink...I wish I had a few more right now."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pilsner malt scent along with some light breadlike notes. It's dry with some German hop character. The taste is decent. It has a very dry pilsner malt flavor that goes down quick and easy and finishes clean with some light hop bitterness. It's a basic recipe with little malt complexity, but it works. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid German pils. It's nothing fancy, yet well brewed; a good drinker."
"500 ml can. Pale yellow colour, with a big foamy head that holds long enough, and leaves some rings of lace. Smell is floral, hops, a bit of lemon. Medium body, in the mouth is dry, bitter, a bit of lemon too. Refreshing. Though I'm not fond of cans, this is a very good pilsener, maybe it lacks of some more aroma, or maybe is just the can thing, but it's a very enjoyable beer."
"First beer I have tried from this brewer also, had never heard of this one before either, probably would not drink again but not bad for a European pilsener"
"D: Serviceable but not substantially different than one of the usual Euro pilsners."
"Taste is medium bitter and hoppy with a raw hop extract edge. The malt is still a bit green, but when I drank my way through it started to disappear. Body was OK and drinkability was good. Quite a refreshing beer, but not a high flyer. An average German pilsner."
"12 oz. brown bottle with ""BIT 06"" on the back. It pours a lightly-pale gold, with medium carbonation and an inch of white head. Smells biscuity, a bit buttery, with skunky and spicy hops in the background. Toasted and buttery malts form the base of the flavor, and on top of this are grassy, spicy, almost piney hops that impart a medium, but almost distracting bitterness. The body is medium, with equal carbonation and finish, and is quite dry on the palate. Overall, a well-crafted, quite refreshing, easily-sessionable brew, but the bitterness is a tad higher than I'm used to for they style. That aside, I really love these European pilsners - it's what plain-old beer should taste like."
"D- Very easy drinking and well made lager. What the macros wish they were."
"Pretty good German pils here,unexpected.Nice clear golden yellow with good size rocky white head and some decent lacing.Not much on the aroma though,fresh clean green grass,didn't get much else,had to get the nose right in the glass.Goes down creamy right off the bat,didn't expect that,quite a bit of bitterness to it,can taste a hint of metalic,some grains and lite smooth grass,powerful carbonation on this one,but none the less,still goes down rather well,very thirst quenching and would make a decent session beer.On a hot summer day,this would go over quite well,highly enjoyed this one."
"D - This is a fine example of a German pilsner. It's crisp, clean with an appropriate level of hops and the malt to support."
"Pours out a lightly faded gold with abundant champagne-like carbonation and a sturdy head that leaves rings of lace after each sip. Great floral and earthy hop presence in the nose with a solid, sweetish malt backbone with just a touch of graininess. Flavor is bright and with a light maltiness. There is some crackery flavor from the malt with just a kiss of sweetness. Hops come very floral, and almost grape-y, and leave a nice lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and spritzy, but a lingering residual sweetness, makes this just the slightest bit sticky. Some peculiarities with the mouthfeel affect the drinkability slightly, but this is still a good session."
"It's like your typical german pilsener, but watered down, if you ask me."
"A decent pilsner, for sure."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a decent amount of chunky white head that fades quickly, but laces the glass. Smells slightly of yeast and noble hops. Smells like it might be bitter. Tastes like not much sweetness or malt flavor but a good amount of hop bitterness. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is very creamy at first turning into tingly near the end. Not bad at all. Overall, it's very drinkable, not too unbalanced, finishes well."
"Gold yellow, clear, bubbly with foamy head. Mouthfeel was thin and carbonated. Mostly a mild ""skunk"" hops in the nose, but little of that. A bit of bready malt at first taste, with a very mild hops ""bite."" Unfortunately, like so many German imports of this light-colored, lower hopped lager variety, there was a strange, underlying cardboard (metallic?) taste that, for me at least, undermined the sheer drinkability of the beer. Otherwise, this would be a very tasty one indeed. It wasn't bad and with German celebrities like Til Schweiger (""Driven," ""King Arthur," etc.) offering their support of the product on the brewery's web page, you can't go wrong. Seriously, as popular German beers go, this is a good one."
"Overall: Pleasant and refreshing. Nothing spectacular but a fine German pilsener."
"Drinkability - i wouldnt say no to one i guess, but its not a standout pilsner, very much a run of the mill mass produced offering, still prefer it to carling though!"
"Light mouthfeel and very easy to drink. I will be back for more of this one for sure."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Not artisanal for sure, but well made."
"D: I could easily spend a session with this beer. It's very tasty, a great example of a German Pilsner, light and smooth. Yeah, it's a good one."
"Overall: Slack at times; clean, but stunningly average and attractive with its simplistic poise. Average though. (O-K)Ã¶nig, so to speak."
"This poured from the can to a typical pilsener yellow with a head that reduced to a bit of chunk on the top. Smell is clean with lots of barley. Taste is quite hoppy, not excessive, just right. For the hop content, this brew is quite refreshing and easy to drink, a little bitter which gives it an edge, but overall. not bad at all."
"D: Good... though it is fairly hoppy, and I wasn't overly fond of these hop flavours."
"No green bottle here. Color is a sparkling golden with plenty of carbonation. The foamy head is tall and thick. Retention is above average. Aroma is sweet and grainy with a mild herbal hop smell. Flavor is more of the same: sweet and grainy. Taste is less dry than most pils with a bit more of a sweet malt flavor. Herbal hop is there, but not as strong as expected. Anyway, this pils had some helles-like qualities that I really enjoyed. This is definently better that most of the German pilseners that make it to the states."
"This follows the textbook style of German brewing. The heavy milk like lace and sun tainted skunk smell is the first thing you get from it. It has somewhat of a cleaner taste then some of the other pilsners IÂve had. The beer follows the footsteps of all the others from the region but I get a little more yeast taste from it. The price is cheaper that the others as well. If I was looking for this style, I would probably pick this one up again."
"But the truly worthy trait was the taste. this lager rather surprised me to the point of giving it a high rating, because I found it exceptionally refreshing with a strong hoppy finish, not overwhelming however considerably strong felt. I was fascinated, well, however much a pilsener can do that to me, but still, this is a fairly good beer if I ever spot it as one of my choices (erm, if ever in germany soon)."
"Overall I can say my expectations were exceeded with this pils, maybe even better than Bitburger, my German Pils benchmark."
"Canned sample. Medium gold in colour with high carbonation. Grainy malt aroma is dominant, with some very mild soapy notes on the back end. Malt dominated flavors as well, with some grassy noble hop contributions, and some mineral notes. Solid bitterness with a slightly drying white flour quality on the finish. Nothing special, but fairly satisfying, especially on a warm day. You could do much worse."
"Pours a clear golden, big frothy white head forms that refuses to go, little bit of lace. Light sweet malt, some citrusy hops are present, honey. Taste is sweet and honeylike, little bit of citrus near the end, nice dry finish, little bitter. Light bodied, medium carbonation, very smooth, pretty tasty for a generic German pilsener"
"A yellow-gold colored German pils with a nice retentive white frothy cap...laces well. Aroma is malt pronouced and sweetish with light pine like aromas. Great malt delivery to the palate...bready but light sweetness is balanced well with pine-citrus hops but it is a mellow hop presense...not sharp like the Czech pils....finish is mild and bisquity with a light citrus twang...I like this smooth tastey pils and at this price, leave the domestic crap and cheaper commie pilsners on the shelf. This one delivers a great German malty taste in mellow balence with pine-citrus hopping for a pleasant, fresh taste."
"Pours a slightly darker than standard clear gold under a very disappointing 1/2 finger fizzy white head that faded way to fast for a pilsener and left no lace. The nose of mild sweet malt is OK, but could use a bit more hoppy spice. The mouth is solid: very prickly and slightly sticky. Taste has the requisite sweet barley opening, but the hoppy bitter follow-up is too subdued, even hard to find. There's some dryness in the finish, but malt is the predominant component. It's OK, but by no means great. Go to the lower Rhine and have one on tap."
"Not quite as crisp as some, but overall a good example of the style. Clean light malt flavors with some grape-soda-like notes in the background. Overall, the beer's character is bright, with light hopping slapping a dash of bitterness at the end. Quite smooth and classy."
"A very solid northern style German pilsner. Pours a nice fluffy head lacing to midway through the glass. Light golden colour with mild carbonation.Both malt and hops are present in this brew. Finishes off with a quick bitterness. Defines a German pilener very well. My favourite Pilsener, can always be found in the fridge or on the dinner table."
"This Konig Brauerei Pilsener was packaged in an American style brown longneck bottle. The pour showed a golden body that was mostly clear or pehaps just a bit hazy. The head, what there was of it, was white and it settled into a thin layer that left some pretty nice sticky lace. Lots of malt nose with a hint of fruity hops. Constant flows of carbonation bubbles help give this beer a crisp mouthfeel, though the feel is also a bit thin. Plenty of hop bitterness makes the malt seem less sweet than it probably is. A good strong Pilsener beer that is fairly true to the style."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a modest sized white head that fades into a thin and sticky lace. Nose is sweet malts and grains with a bit of citrusy hops. Light in body and very crisp and refreshing. Taste is also sweet malts and grains with some bready biscuity notes followed by some bitter hops and a bit of lemon leaving a dry finish. A very nice pilsner that I will always gladly make room for in my fridge."
"a light lager is desired. Long live the 500ml beer can revolution."
"Highly recomended"
"Presentation: Packaged in a brown glass Euro-style long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Nice thick head. Very good nose too with the hops being super fresh and awakening. Pours quite golden, nice hops in the flavor. Excellent beer that has the hops and malt decently balanced. The mouthfeel is very smooth and ligh with a delicate texture. Very enjoyable beer."
"A nice, solid pilsner. One of my favorite styles and this is def. one of my go-tos."
"This is my favorite pilsner! Has a distinctive, refreshing taste. Very fresh and extremely easy to drink (avoid the brown bottle version with the twist-off cap, however. It was stale and skunky. Stick with the original green bottles). In a style filled with so many taste-a-like beers, this one stands out."
"Nice fairly thick fluffy head.  Straw body.  Clean and fresh aroma with a whiff of typical pilsener hops.  Flavor is light peppery hops.  Fairly dry although I thought I might have detected esters."
"American (macro) yellow beer brewers should take note."
"mine was a litle skunked (damn green bottles),want to try it when its not.Heard good things about it,Iam not a real pilsner fan though."
"Aroma: Clean maltiness with a bit of hoppy spiciness. Pale gold, the color of straw, with decent head retention.  This is the beer Budeweiser wishes it could be - the combination of typically round, sweet decoction mash flavor combined with a nice firm bitterness and hoppiness that is near-perfect in balance. The lingering bitter-hop-malt-spiciness flavors at the back of your tongue after a long sip just screm ""more!!""  One of the best, if not the best, Pilsners I've yet tried. Good in bottle (if it hasn't been skunked), but better on tap."
"Notes: Forget Becks or the similar ... a fine pils to be had any time of the year. A treat for either the veteran micro drinker or a macro drinker. Goes down well yet very tasty at the same time."
