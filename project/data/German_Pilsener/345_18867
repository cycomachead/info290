At least some residual head remains over time. Aromas of bread, grain, and light grass are noted. On the palate this one comes across somewhat dry with a mineral component that reminds me a little of Dortmunder beers. Nice dry bready flavors are noted as well. Good body to enjoy as a filling beer on its own, but yet light enough for exceptional drinkability and pairing with foods. Wish this one was bottled.","yemenmocha","Jan 26, 2014"

4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had at tasting last night, so this will be from my notes I did on paper that had someone's number on it. Tastes are lemony hops, some grass, chives, German hops, clean and crisp maltiness, lager yeast, age, linen. Smells like a typical American Pilsner with some age to it and some biscuitiness here and there.","Jazzcrop","May 22, 2011"
4.15,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall - a great pilsner. I think I'd usually prefer this to Prima Pils because there is more balance between the malt and the hops, unless I was in the mood for something hoppy.","HotHands","Apr 27, 2011"

4.1,2.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Had it again about two months later and it seems to have more of a balance. the hops were backed with a delicate meatiness. the grain hint of toasty vienna malt but with no sweet overtaste. dry as a whistle. i would really love to have this one in a bottle so the flavors integrate a bit in storage. not long storage because i can't distinguish if this is the same batch or a new one.","rtepiak","Apr 25, 2011"

4.37,9.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"O: Another great pils made by Victory. These Braumeister Pils' are just awesome. Just such a drinkable beer that wont' kick your ass alcohol wise. As I said, this one is much sweeter and more balanced than the Prima and much softer. Still a fantastic beer that I am lucky enough to have a keg of to enjoy through this Spring.","Kadonny","Mar 01, 2011"

4.05,1.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a slightly hazy straw yellow with a nice off white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves just a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild pale malts alongside crisp Earthy hops. The taste is a smooth balance of sweet biscuity malts and smooth Earthy hops. The beer is quite light, smooth and very crisp. This is a very enjoyable pilsner, one I would certainly have again.","atsprings","Jul 18, 2010"
4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Braumeister Pils is a really great German-style Pilsener from Victory. It has the perfect woody and spicy noble hop aroma and flavor that evokes in me the sensory memory of walking in a beech forest in late fall after an early morning shower. It has a very green, grounded hop character that is invigorating. I would love to try this and Prima Pils back-to-back to compare, I haven't had that beer in months. Braumeister is very clean, dry and has a nice malty taste.","Soonami","Jul 04, 2010"
4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours straw yellow with a slight haze, a two-finger white head that dissipates quickly but leaves lots of lacing. The smell is cut grass and clover, maybe some bitter marigold, crisp well water, sourdough bread. The taste is sourdough starter, wood sorrel, bright minerals from what has to be a great water source, and an earthy, bitter finish. It's a little more viscous than you'd expect, but the high carbonation balances that out pretty well. It's great hot-weather beer, but would also go well on a brisk fall day -- I should've gotten 64 oz. rather than 32. One of my favorite American pilsners.","gory4d","Jun 25, 2010"

4.07,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"On-tap at Liberty St. Tavern. Appeared a hazy gold with with a couple fingers of white head. Basically, this is a very American pilsner. It's big on hops, but there isn't much subtle malt or yeast character. Still, the grassy, herbal hops are delicious, plus the bitterness isn't too harsh. I'd be happy to drink several.","tempest","Oct 11, 2009"
3.65,-8.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink had a gold, slight-amber color that was generally murky. Grassy hops help make a full aroma sense. The flavors were generally bittersweet with that grassy, bready tones. Pretty light with little carbonation but not too watery. Overall, not too bad.","fitzy84","Sep 21, 2009"
4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This pilsner poured a clear, golden color with a centimeter or so or nice, white foam. The smell was a beautiful, aromatic hop aroma, similar to Prima Pils. The taste was a a crisp, hoppy, pilsner, not so bready with malt but a great flavor nonetheless. Again, very similar to Prima Pils. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good, sturdy carbonation. The malt and aromatic hops lingered in the mouthfeel. This was a very nice beer, and I enjoyed more than one.","UncleJimbo","Sep 04, 2009"
4.28,7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - A great pils in every way, very fresh like few I have tasted -top notch German style lager from Victory, does not fail to deliver at all. The lasting hop in the finish is great.","Slatetank","Aug 14, 2009"

4.52,13,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"NOTE: It seems like Victory put out several versions of beer referred to as Braumeister Pils... and I am making my best assumption as to which I just consumed. I resolved that the beer menu at the bar plainly stated ""Braumeister Pils", and other reviews for this beer indicated that it was unfiltered... there is a chance however, that the keg I sampled was yet another unique one-off batch...","jgasparine","0"

4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Straw in color fragrant noble hops and crisp taste, this is the best pilsner i have ever had. Full of flavor, but light enough to drink all night. I stopped by the brewery and wanted to keep drinkin these even though there was plenty of others to try. I was half tempted, before i left, to pick up a quarter keg to bring home. This beer is lighter in alcohol too, if my memory serves me right, 3.8%. Seriously do yourself a favor and try one of these.","Jettanbass9","Apr 21, 2007"
4.3,7.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had on tap at a beer picnic at B.Paradiso in Georgetown. Best drink of the night. It's slightly hazy, straw yellow with good lacing, and a small head that fades. Nose is yeasts and barny sweet malts with earthy moss. Taste is mild hops, sweet with hints of fruit, and peat from a bog. Exceptional example of the style. Mouthfeel is good, a bit foamy. Drinkability is very high. Nice beer from Victory!","shivtim","Apr 02, 2005"

4.2,5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Draught @ Victory: Another variation of their Pilsner beer, which I believe they only serve at their pub. The beer is a lovely hazy, golden color, with a white head. There is a slightly spicy hop & wheat aroma. The taste is a lighter malty, with maybe a hint of sweetness and spiciness. Very good hop bite, but not as balanced as the Prima Pils. There are definitely Wit characteristics in this brew. Another good reason to visit the brewery.","Boto","Mar 10, 2005"
4.53,13.3,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"This was one heck of a pilsner. A perfect session beer, which I don't normally associate with lagers. This one is just sooo smooth and drinkable. This won't let you down. Although I sample this on April Fool's day, it was no joke. Straw gold with frothy head, until finally a nice lace remains. Taste approaches perfection. Nice malt taste up front with a nice hops bitterness at the end. Makes it nice and refreshing. Perfection at the end of the taste. Definitely seek this out.","GeoffFromSJ","Oct 02, 2004"
4.05,1.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Kudos to the folks at Victory for this single-hop series. This particular version seemed true to the Pilsner style, dry and effervescent, ever-so-pleasing to drink and refreshing, with a nice bite to it. Just what to expect and demand from a good Pilsner! It's not my favorite style, but the quality overcame that for me, much like the Prima Pils does.","TheGipper","Jul 21, 2004"

Great with vegetable dishes and lighter meats like chicken or fish. A prime example of masterful brewing making up for an impaired set of ingredients. I can't imagine what a good year of Hallertaur would bring.","nomad","0"
