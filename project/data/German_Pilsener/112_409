3.9,3.4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"this is one of the better widely available pilseners made in the united states i think. its super refreshing and bright, but its got a little body too it, nothing watery about it at all, and has a ton of flavor, nothing adjunct about it, with just a little sweetness in the middle before the more bready or crackery malts come in, fresh and sturdy for the style. hops are light, enough bitter to balance a higher sweetness, but not real intense at all. some grassy notes, really fresh this is fantastic. a great beer with greasy food like pizza and wings, not filling at all, and more than just a palate cleanser. i havent been the hugest fan of north coast over the years, never really thought they stood out much, but this one is awesome, and im not usually too excited about pilsener. delicious, different, worth buying for sure. this may become a go to for me. sessionable forever at this abv too.","StonedTrippin","Feb 07, 2015"

I honestly did not expect to be nearly as amazed with this beer as I am. I would even say that it is one of the better German style pils available even including German brewers. I am shocked by the average review rating, but I think this has a lot to do with BA being biased towards specialty beers and tending to overlook more subtle beers or not appreciating how difficult it is to brew a beer to such a high degree of excellence as this.","honkey","Dec 11, 2014"

Hops are very noticeable in the aroma, but there is a lack of malty or grainy notes. Taste is good, with hops out in front again. I would have preferred more of a grainy dryness here as I think it's more consistent with the style. Mouthfeel is decent if a bit thinner than I would have liked. Carbonation is significant and nicely refreshing. Overall, this is a decent warm weather beer, and while I would certainly drink it again if offered, it's not something I would go out of my way to get my hands on.","bristol2120","Aug 24, 2014"

4.04,7.2,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a flute. This is a deep golden yellow beer, nearly light orange, with a creamy white head resembling whipped cream that settles down quite quickly. Aroma is classic white bread-like pale malts predominantly, with a subdued stronger cereal note and noble hops notes, slightly floral and fruity. The cereals are stronger on the palate, and truth be told this is one of the best German pilseners I've had from a malt standpoint. There is a rich and sweet caramel-like maltiness along with the more expected cracker and sourdough bread notes (there must be a decent dose of crystal in this) and the hop flavors are really popping out as well ... I am getting some tangerine and orange in here, unripe stone fruit galore, faint brown spice (!), grass and fragrant hay ... The citrus is quite prominent in the finish. Body is thin as per the style but with a shade more chew than mass-produced adjunct lagers, and the carbonation is pleasingly toned down but still robust enough to remind you that you are drinking a pils. Finishes fruity yet dry and a little chalky, with a massive citric presence that lingers. Absolutely brilliant stuff. The green malts provide most of the heft but the hop flavor and bitterness keeps up admirably.","CalgaryFMC","May 15, 2014"
4.59,21.8,4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Pours a hazy gold in color with a good almost 2-finger head that settled down to a think layer on top and sides of the glass. A great deal of lacing is seen, like most German Pilsners. The aroma is mostly of just grass and fresh bread. The taste is well...fantastic! Not overly complicated at all for the taste. Very refreshing and goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Very surprised as I wasn't sure of how this one would be overall but very pleased!","BeerWithMike","May 15, 2014"

I can drink this while i eat dinner, or I can come in after mowing my grass and this beer is absolutely amazing. I have had it semi warm and ice cold. Of course Ice cold is the best. The one thing that I truly admire about this beers flavor is that is goes great with any food you make. I truly love it best with a big plate of fried Cod, Fried chips and hush puppies!","bobvinson2002","Apr 14, 2014"

It pours beautifully, a light amber with a thick head and lingering laciness. Smells of summer to me. Taste is crisp, with just the right balance. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and leaves the palate dry and refreshed. I could enjoy this one on the deck this summer with a grilled burger and potato salad, or right now with a tasty Reuben sandwich and chips. Sooo much better than the mass-produced pilsners being offered in the U.S. these days. I'll be back for more!","ThisLadyLovesBeer","Feb 13, 2014"

Pours fairly hazy and cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, apricot, floral, grass, bread, honey, and floral earthiness. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and strength of malt, fruity esters, and light hop notes. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, apricot, floral, grass, biscuit, light pepper, honey, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, biscuit, light pepper, honey, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity esters; with a fair amount of hop flavor; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a light creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a nice Pilsener. Definitely not as dry as most I have had; but has a nice balance of fairly unique flavors, and is very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 26, 2013"

I was not expecting anything out of the ordinary, however i was blown away. Taste is hard to explain, but the easiest way to explain how this beer tasted was clean and to the point. Was brewed like an authentic german pilsner using the German Purity law and it tasted like it. Tasted like it was brewed with real spring water. Light caramel finish with just the right amount of hops. The absolutely only thing that i would saw, for me was that the carbonation was just a tad overwhelming. outstanding beer A+.

The smell is pretty good, not skunky. This mouthfeel is generally smooth and not a turn off. Overall this is NOT a bad beer, and I could throw a few back and enjoy.

Overall this was a very nice and smooth brew. The aroma unfortunately was lacking bigtime as I had to almost hyperventilate to find anything in it. The flavor was also just okay as it was very light.

Good pour into a pint glass with a pale golden color that struck me right away as being the perfect color of a German Pils. Fine white head and visible carbonation that still left some lacing in the glass right down to the finish. Good aroma of slight hop characteristics with some good floral background. Beer was somewhat sweet with a good mouthfeel and great finish. This was a clean well balanced and flavor beer. Only after I came home and looked it up did I realize that this beer was another product out of North Coast Brewing Company.

Lowkey persistence in the nose, with sourdough, wild yeasts and wet straw, lemon oil and rock salt, becomes more herbaceous as it warms, however, the citrus scents never get past a barely audible mutter. Light-bodied to watery, minimal palate presence, leans heavily on the bitterness and sour grassiness to remind you it's there. The carbonation not helping, keeps the flavors from settling in and elevate texture of Pellegrino thing. Pretzel dough, rye bread, the malts appear to offer naught but a softening effect on the overall texture. As it finishes there's a moment of pink grapefruit and orange citrus but it's totally dry.

3.2,-15.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"I've come to shy away from Pilsners and the like lately but I thought I'd give this one a try. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy, yellow-orange golden color with a thin bubbly head that has lots of carbonation rising from the depths of the glass. Smell is primarily malt, a slight sweetness of lighter grains and subtle hints of honey and a slight skunkiness; the hopping is pretty nondistinct. The taste is very similar to the nose with the difference being that the skunkiness of the beer is much more pronounced and there is a slight hop presence in the form of a finishing bitterness. Mouthfeel is light with a dry finish and slightly mouth burning carbonation. Drinkability of this beer is hurt by the skunkiness. I suspect that the single beer I have is probably far past the ""best by"" date although since there isn't a date on the bottle its hard to determine. Overall, another disappointing Pils.","gmfessen","Aug 13, 2007"

But at least most pilsners have more hops or at least notes of something else that separates them from others. Notes of citrus and grass for example. At least those are the types of Pilsners I'm drawn to drink. This one seemed too bland for my tastes.

Some may call this lifeless and dull, but every now and then, I rather enjoy a beer that is less than 10% abv and doesn't taste like pine resin and grapefruit juice.

I was waiting for that crisp, dry hoppiness of a good European Pils, but got what I've come to expect from American interpretations of the style. I'm not saying that these attempts aren't good beers, they can be. My particular taste prefers the drier, hoppier Czech or German Munich-Lager styles.

4.17,10.6,3.5,4,4,5,4.5,"Foggy off-yellow, pale off-white head. Pleasant aroma of lightly toasted wheat bread, and some left coast hops. Lemony, oily slick and a bit pastylemon tea and crisp hop flavorings. Bitter noble hops become predominately noticeable in the body; a touch and go feeling of some grounded black pepper on the palate. Decent carbonation, pretty well balanced, the nice herbal west coast hops round this one of nicely. North Coast once again deliversthis is a fine product.","GeoffRizzo","Jan 19, 2006"
3.78,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Scrimshaw is bright golden, with just a bit of haze. Carbonation is high. Head is large and thick. Aroma is of sweet, mildly grainy malt with an edge of herbal hop. Taste is of light bready malt with touches of grain. Plenty of noble hop flavor is the highlight here, not very bitter, but just bracing enough for my tastes.

I detect grains and sugar with slight hints of alcohol and pine. The taste starts of with a subtle blend of malt and hops giving an almost fruit-inspired taste that finishes crisp and dry. This a refreshing beer with great smoothness and just the right amount of sweetness for this particular style. The low ABV and the excellent taste make this a highly drinkable beer. An excellent German Pilsener.","jaluria","Dec 02, 2005"

Fresh aroma that's initially bright and lemony zesty, but quickly becomes sweeter and maltier, with some cinnamon spice. Flavor is leaning toward sweet, but not approaching cloying. There are light hints of corn and biscuity malt, some lemon and spice. Flavor thickens up in the finish, and turns to mostly buttery corn. Mouthfeel is a bit slick, not very carbonated. Probably the most drinkable pilsner I've had due to the even flavors and lack of the sharp corn flavor that sometimes hangs in the back of the mouth.","far333","Nov 08, 2005"

The nose is slightly citrusy and spicey on the hop with a very slight grainey character coming through as well. Flavor is a little bland. Mild graineyness, with just a hint of spicey and sweet hoppyness, but not nearly as crisp as I would like it. The feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. Definately needs more of a crisp carbonation. Overall, just a bit lacking. The burps from this brew give me more hop character than I get in the flavor, which seems odd to me. I'm not digging the flavor as much as I would like.","kmpitz2","Sep 17, 2005"

It certainly looked like it was going to be a nice refreshing beer to drink on a hot Houston day. The taste, however, was not what I was expecting. It had an odd earthy, grainy, burnt wood flavour that just didn't seem to fit. Mouthfeel was a little thin with a slightly dry finish.

Scrimshaw is a fresh tasting Pilsner brewed in the European tradition from Munich and Klages malts at 4.4% ABV, Hallertauer and Tettnang hops provide 22 IBU's.

Sweetness continues on the palate, with a honey-tinged malty base accented by subtle notes of those floral hops. Mellow finish leaves a lingering sweetness.

Nothing complicated, but solidly crafted, I love to start the end of the day with a Scrimshaw, or have a glass while I'm getting dinner ready. The color is a light, buttery golden. Not alot of head, but I'm happy to drink this without a glass, and am not into over-analyzing this style. Aromas are yeasty and malty, reminding me of fresh baked bread. Flavors are clean and feature a rubust grain profile, especially malt, some rye like flavors, and just a spattering of hop to focus the beer. Ah so easy to drink. This is a Good choice for all levels of beer drinkers.","moulefrite","Feb 21, 2004"

Aroma of sweet caramel malts dance a waltz with the floral hops and Granny Smith apple background. In the mouth, there is abundant fizzy carbonation and some moderate hop bite. Plenty of caramel malt sweetness in the taste, backed up with solid Munich maltiness. Fruity and floral hops are around to lend a delicate balance. Excellent finish is clean and dry. I could have a couple more of these, anytime. I enjoyed this one with pickled okra. A perfect session brew here.","merlin48","Feb 16, 2004"

The aroma is well balanced between the freshly mown hay and bready maltiness and sharp, slighty herbal and earthy hops. Faint touches of honey and mustiness too. That balance carries over into the flavor, with a firm bitterness holding the biscuity malt in check. Quite a bit of dryness towards the finish, which serves to add some length. The body seems a touch thicker than desired, but bumping up the carbonation a bit would help that.

The hops are certainly there but subdued until the very end, when they linger on the tongue and coax you into taking another sip. Soft, cushy mouthfeel. Between that and the head, I am guessing there's some wheat in the recipe.

The Scrimshaw had a nice crisp taste, and had a bit of an added sweetness that I didn't expect. Smooth, slightly bitter, and refreshing. The visible carbonation didn't quite prodce the fizziness desired on the tongue, but the medium to lighter body was appealing. Very easy drinking, I could easily sit back and enjoy several. I think I would have appreciated a bit more bitterness to give it more of a kick, but it had all the characteristics of a good pilsner. I love the name, too.

Flavor is straightforward, sweet malts may be a touch overdone, but lending a soft initial flavor with no off characters. Delicate apple impressions.

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Is ""American Pilsner"" an oxymoron?  In any event, this is one of the better examples of a beer style that I think is very hard for American concerns to brew.  Most of 'em just don't have the delicate and yet full flavor of Pilsner Urquell or even Crystal.  But this one almost does -- good golden color, nice white head, whiffs of hops and malt in the nose and on the palate, and crisp carbonation.  I like it.","BKotch","Nov 16, 2001"
