"Deep gold(6) with white head. No aroma and skunky flower flavor. Hard to finish..."

"Served in a Pilsner glass"

"I love this beer.  Smooth.  Just the way I like it.  LIke the man said while looking at the nude picture, ""I may not know art, but I know what I like."""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a very fizzy head that trails the glass. The smell was mostly alcohol with a bit of rice on the back end. The taste wasn't as strong as I was expecting with some rice up front and then a bit of hops on the end but nothing too overwhelming. The feel of it was very thin for the alcohol content. Wasn't very impressed."

"This beer do goo, inside and outside!"
"Outlier? Go fuck a goat."
""
"Overall: Another poor offering from a poor brewer. I had this one to get the tick and the bottle cap, but moved quickly to Spotted Cow at my family's Thanksgiving party. Don't waste your time with this beer."
"Had a few of these over the past few days, some ice cold then one at 45° and the taste was much more satisfying..."
"A fine beer with food. Better than standard (American) Becks."

"Bland flavor. Minimal malt. Hint of apple sweetness."
""
""
"Pours a golden crystal clear color. Head is fast and leaves very quickly with no visible lacing to speak of. Lots of tiny bubbles continue their trek to the top throughout the drinking process. Aroma is bready with just a touch of background skunk. Taste is ok, with a touch of bitterness, but not sure if that is the hops or just a mediocre beer I am tasting. I get a grassy-hay flavor. Feel is not that great, typical mass produced beer."
""
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a medium white head. Aroma and Taste sweet citrus, grains, mild grass notes with some sweet lemon flavors and mild bitterness on the end. A medium crisp body, moderate carbonation. Has sweet citrus lemon flavors with some grains , grass and mild bitterness finish. Overall a crisp, refreshing and drinkable brew for a hot summer day. Good for what it is."
"Clear yellow color , medium white head. Aroma of malt and hay. Taste is similar. Minimal hoppy bitterness."

"Overall a smooth, dry American-style lager. No faults and lacks the typical Beck's skunk, but not much flavor or aroma going on."

"One problem with this beer is that it isn't a dark beer, but it nevertheless comes in a black bottle and advertises the name ""Sapphire," which gives you certain expectations that it then fails to meet. It has a very floral smell, and this comes out in the taste, which just isn't much to write home about. It isn't an unpleasant beer, per se, but there just isn't much to it. It is very easy to drink, but also highly forgettable."

"Taste / Palate: There is not a lot going on here. It has a light white bready like malt base with a quick hint of sweetness, a slight touch of grainy alcohol and then a clean dry finish with light hop notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor: combination of mild toasted barley, a bit of bread dough, caramel, some hop bitterness in the finish."

"Beck's Sapphire (2014) - 6% ABV. Pours with a thick head that dissipates to decent lacing. Red amber hue. Decent carbonation. Light mouthfeel. Wet. Very malty and sweet on the front palate. More of an Oktoberfest or Markzen style beer. Lots of barley, bread, and wheat. Smooth syrup sugar-- caramel. Mid-palate there is just a quick hint of hops. A slight alcohol bite. Rolls back to malt, syrup, and wheat. Slight alcohol and maple syrup after taste. Very light taste. Drinkable. Hiding in its ABV. Extremely smooth. I think the problem is that you expect more from the Sapphire hops as you should-- it's a good German beer, but if you're looking for bite you will be disappointed. It is a good beer-- but it isn't hoppy. It's malt and creamy. Had they labeled it Marzen it would be more well received, but it is what it is as they say. 3.5. Good."

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden hue with long lasting, foamy, white head. Nose is of honey and bready malt. Body is light-medium and smooth. Finish is watery. Taste is of bready malt, some honey and hint of hops. Nice drain pour. At least I did not pay for this."
"i WISH SOMEONE WANTED TO BUY THE REST OF THIS CASE I BOUGHT BASED ON THE price. like those beatles,i should've known better! i went out and bought a 6 pk of assorted ipa's so i can drink a great beer,then punish myself by choking down this swill! becks-you are ruining your reputation. or did you buy a warehouse full of schmidts or schlitz. ok i see im supposed to describe the actual experience of this shit-imagine mixing alka seltzer with grapefruit juice ok? got it? the end"

"Overall I feel this is a poor representation of the German pilsener style. It does taste like they want it to be good, but just can't seem to get it there."
""
""
"O: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, there are definitely several other beers in the style that I would pick before this one."
"I probably won't be drinking this beer again."

"I was pleasantly surprised with Beck’s Sapphire. Not too bad at all and I’ll certainly enjoy the rest of this 6-pack."

"16 ounce can, made as a drunk purchase at a Speedway gas station a few months ago. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with an inch and a half off-white head. It smells like sweet malt, light apples and that's about it. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt noticeable. Doesn't smell good, but not awful either. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and easy enough to drink. Moderate carbonation. It's not a bad brew, but I'd only recommend it if you want a tick or if you can get a single can or bottle of it like I did."
""

"Do it once, cross it off your list, and move to the next beer you want to try."
""

"O- not bad nothing i would get again unless maybe on tap"

"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve fluid ounce brown glass bottle, sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O: The use of Sapphire hops makes this beer slightly more interesting than your average pilsener. It's rather easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O: Sounded like a good concept but it does not deliver on it - I was hoping for a showcase of the Saphir hops but it turned out to just be a slightly sweet Euro Lager. Glad that I had the opportunity to give it a shot but I will not be getting this one again."
""
""
""
"A ""friend"" recommended this beer to me. The appearance was great, the taste was a let down. a step above an adjunct beer for me. He either doesn't know the type of beers I like or I need to find a new friend."
""
""
"I am disappointed since my go to beer guy recommended that I try it. One bottle out of the 12pk and I am not pleased. I can buy Old Milwaukee a lot cheaper. Not to say that it tasted like OM, but it didn't taste like Beck's either. Light out of the bottle, lots of ziz on the tongue. Watery in the middle. If Sapphire hops are supposed to taste this way, I guess I'll go along with that. Just a lot of something missing here. The black bottle doesn't really make up for it though. Just which bid at the recycle do you put black empties?"
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Mediocre is too high a score for this beer. Not bad tasting, but pretty much just water."

" Overall- expected a better beer, Not a great pilsner by any mean, Doubt I'll but this beer again, Worth the try though"
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty simple and boring beer; nothing too off putting but pretty bland all around"
""
""
"I'm going to make this really brief and understandable - this beer tastes like Evian water with a slight hint of effervescence, as this brew lacks carbonation big time. Despite this characteristic flaw, I did enjoy the beer with Shrimps cocktail. A worthy one-time try (at least) - it is slightly better than Bud BC. Bon appetit!"

"Not a great pils, but alright. I could see this being an option around here, could do a few before tiring of this. About what I expected"
""
""
"For eight bucks for a six pack, this is an insult. And I'm not even a picky drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Over all, just another lager. It's not bad, its quite alright, I could down a handful of these, they're just alright, worth trying if given but not really worth seeking out in my opinion."
""
""
"Upon cracking the bottle open, it smelled dank and sour, much like a mass produced cheap adjunct lager. And the taste was just as bad. Very bitter in a bad way, yet very watery. Very dry afterwards. To be honest, it tasted a lot like Bud Light Platinum to me. This beer had no positives, other than being slightly better than most cheap light beers. Won't drink again."
"O: Not really anything different or too impressed from Beck's here."
""
""
""
"-Overall 2.50: I have really, really tried to be fair with this beer and not let my anger regarding being fooled into buying this monstrosity seep in. Seriously, are there real ""sapphire"" hops? I looked them up on the interwebs and it turns out that they do exist, but are usually spelled ""Saphir," since they are German hops that are used in place of Hallertau. Two points to bring up for Beck's: 1.) ""Saphir"" is one heck of a cooler spelling than ""Sapphire."" 2.) If you are a German brewery brewing a beer using a new German hop, maybe you should brew it in...I dunno...GERMANY! This beer is not swill, but is not great and certainly is not worth the almost $10 you will pay for a sixer of this brew."

"12oz bottle, brewed in St. Louis, MO. Golden with excellent clarity, frothy white head holds good retention. Aromas are lager yeast, grassy hop, very faint pilsener malt. Tastes are oddly floral & fruity, earthy, grassy, sweet, no sharp finish as expected with a pilsener. Body seems like it's actually fuller than it should be, it's medium & creamy. Overall, I had a hard time with this one. Doesn't have much for pilsener qualities, odd flavors. Not good at all."
""
""
""
"Corn and cereal taste, orange flavoring, winey, dirty, and a hint of Cynar, the artichoke aperitif. Not trace of hop flavor [after I wrote this I see that Sapphire refers to a variety of hop]. Overall, there is some beeriness but it is exactly what I hoped never to taste in a-- whoops! I almost said German-- beer, but it is now an InBev product made by the former AB in the St. Louis factory. All the discussions on ""if you were CEO of a giant brewer"" are interesting when you taste what they DO produce, in contrast with what good brews they COULD produce."
"Totally boring. Can't define these Sapphire hops from this beer. Warning: Not to allow to warm, drink ice cold."
""

"Not a whole lot going on that would make me want to open another one of these, kind of glad I got this one in a mixed 6 pack."

"My pour initially left me with a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that quickly reduced to wisps. Color was a deep-golden yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to peer through walls. Nose had an upfront sweetish malty quality underlain by a grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was slightly thin and the taste was much sweeter than what I had expected. What happened to/with the hops?!? Finish was likewise sweet and not really my cup of tea. It was not a bad beer, per se, just kind of uninspired."
"Not really recommended."
""
""
""
"I poured this disappointing beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was straw colored and poured a nice head at first. However it did not last long. The beer had a srange taste like apple cider and was just flat tasting. I don't think much effort went into this new beer and you could tell. I will not buy again."
""
"This beer is a borderline scam, brewed on Madison Avenue more so than Bremen [bitter laugh] or even St. Louis. Ten years ago, they just called this Busch Beer. It's a high alcohol content Budweiser re-branded as Beck's in a distinctive black bottle. German ""sapphir"" hops aside, this beer is no German pilsner, in any way, smell, taste or form. I'm looking into my empty glass glumly trying to discern evidence of any beer-related sensory stimulus whatsoever."
""
""
""
""
"O-I will not buy this product again, it's apparently created for an audience that wants the big kick of alcohol without having to develop a taste for a fine brew. It's disguised as a flavorful, hoppy Bohemian style pilsener but it's all smoke and mirrors. Much better choices are available for the price."
"Product of Saint Louis USA (really?) and it shows. Pours to a pale gold color and 3/4 inch head that falls to a 1/8 inch layer of foam. Lacing is low to none. Aroma is faint and grainy with a hint of played out noble hops. Flavor is bland and boozy with a cheap beer taste you wouldn't even expect from Becks. Grainy, slightly bready and sweet with a dry, slick finish. Mouthfeel is OK. Overall, a disappointing beer that goes along with the Bud Platinum trend. Never again."
""
""
"This poured out as a clear golden yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The retention was thin and lasted for a little while. The lacing was basically nowhere in sight. The smell of the ever is slightly floral, there is some grainy notes and a tough of creaminess as well. The beer smell way better than any other Beck's I've had in the past. The taste is sweet, there is a dominant malt flavor with some corn-like flavors as well as this hops shining through again. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, it's thin and carbonated. Overall it's the best thing I've tried from Beck's I'm glad it wasn't terrible. If I had to be a cheap date and this was available I would order it."
""
""
"The mouthfeel isn't particularly clean. It's got a bit of slickness to it right off the bat, though there is a crispness as well. Smoothness comes out just at the beginning and fades off. The longer the sip, the more a somewhat numbing, tingly alcoholic touch hits the roof of the mouth and the back of the throat and tongue."
""
"This is my least favorite Beck's product that I have tried to date."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is supposed to be a higher end beer, and a 10$ for a 6 pack I expected something better from Beck's. To me this brings nothing new to the plate, and if anything is a step backwards. The added ""6%"" of alcohol took away from the taste of the beer rather than adding to it. Not worth the money."
""
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Pours a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some grains, not much going on. Taste is crisp, light, some grains, slightly sweet, a bit on the mild side. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is a mediocre beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I liked it much more than regular Becks."
""
""
""
"Overall, an ok brew to sample, they could of done better."
""
"Cool black bottle and label. White head with yellow golden color. Very Faint floral hops, perhaps a hint of sugary sweet and clean citrus aroma with a light bodied feel overall. Straight up this does not taste like any Sapphire German beer I've had before. Needs more hops, Not what I was expecting, I'd pass."
"If you are going to boast about a certain type of hop and even make it a part of the beer's name then you need to make sure it is actually in the beer ... a vague character of the hop does not work. Pass on this one."
"Now I don't claim to have as sophisticated a palate as a lot of people on BA, but I kinda like this stuff. Granted, there are MUCH better tasting beers but for what it is--a lighter tasting, higher ABV beer--it's not as bad as some make it out to be. I keep some around for those times when I want something with a higher alcohol content that is easily drinkable--this does the job."
"O - This is okay. Don't quite understand the D score. It's just average."
""
"This is a pale yellow beer with a thin head and lower than expected carbonation. The beer has a cereal aroma and very faint spicy hops. Mediocre smell and uninspiring appearance. The taste is more appealing....sharper, spicy, a little sweetness....faint malt....clean and crisp. Thin mouthfeel. Macro lager, average at best."
""
"Constructive criticism: Thicken the head. Darken the color. Pleasurize the aftertaste. Make a more honest label. Keep the ABV."
""
"This was a disappointment. After all the advertising, I was hoping for something special. But this is a bland beer with nothing special. I think AB is trying to compete with craft beers. But all they did was raise the alcohol level without adding any taste. Also: the brewery is listed above as being in Germany. That's not correct. The bottle says St. Louis MO (the home of AB) but I suspect the beer is brewed somewhere else. Also misleading is all the references to Germany and German hops on the bottle & carton. It's not a German beer. And it's not better than the original Beck's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it seems like Beck's amped up the alcohol on an already bland base, and possibly froze the result. The new ""Sapphire"" hop? If those were the grass & leaf clipping taste, let's hope they lose the seed stock.."
"O - Far from being a great pilsner, but the reviews do seem a bit biased against Becks. I actually wound up enjoying this beer and would not mind downing a sixer of these on a summer day."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, I didn't see a bottled date. For some reason I was expecting this to be dark, instead its a crystal clear light yellow color with a long lasting white head. The smells are of light crisp grass smells. The feel is medium light. The taste isn't what I like, a light crisp hops, mild malts, not every appealing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty average beer, reminds me more of an adjunct lager than a German pilsener. Flavors a re bland and the smell is almost non-existent."
""
"O - I've never had Beck's before, but was told it was a decent German macro. Not bad, tastes like beer, would definitely drink it again if I needed a stronger session beer, but that's about it."
"Overall I'm not too impressed but really wasnt expecting much. Better to drink it cold. Take a pass."
""
"o - I'm not a big fan of the normal Beck's and I didn't really care for this one either. The nose is bland thought not offensive, but I didn't really like the sweetness in the taste and the body is a bit thin. Wouldn't have it again, and wouldn't reccomend it."
" Taste is decent with floral hop and light pilsner sweetness with low alcohol and hop bitterness adding to the smooth malt taste. Overall a decent lager but it didn't stand out among the style and pretty tame it could provide more of a hop taste considering it has the variety listed on the label."
""
""
""
""
"O. No real flavor or kick. Tastes like a smoothed out Becks. Nothing special here."
"Better off sticking with regular Becks. Not impressed."
""
"Overall-I don't think I will be buying this again, feels and tastes like an American beer not German. Which isn't a bad thing I just don't understand this release other than to make more money out of an inferior product. I like beck's, but this tastes like beck's and Budweiser had a baby and that baby was left out in the sun to long then stumbled into a frat house to become a college beer. 2.25"
""
"There is some lingering dryness on the finish...body is medium...nothing bad about this but nothing to recommend either except its exceptional clarity if you want to look at it."
""
""
""
""
"Below average pilsener. Seems like the goal was to make a cheap lager with higher than normal alcohol."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a small amount of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some grass and hay aromas. There is also a slight vegetal aroma that comes out as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with a grainy bread flavor on the finish. There is an extremely mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with very mild hop aromas and flavors."
""
""
"Poured it into the 12 oz. Sam Adams glass. Clear and gold, with a very short-lived head. No lacing on the glass. Aroma is almost absent, as all I got was a faint whiff of any malt. Taste isn't too bad, but there is very little distinctive about it. It just has a little sweetness (but nothing I can put my finger on) and little hop bitterness on the finish. Moderate carbonation, a little heavy on the finish. Thinner in texture. It might be the one I'd choose out of a selection of mediocre beers but not one I'll ever seek out again. Of note, the beer color on the packaging is decidedly NOT the color of the beer when poured from the bottle. Also interesting, brewed in St. Louis (by the AB part of InBev-AB), so it's not even a German import anymore. But clearly trying to appeal to that market."
"Overall I never really liked Beck's but this one is as advertised, smooth and somewhat hoppy (I guess)"
""
""
""
"A big ole adjunct bomb. Yeah, they smoothed out the beer but it sacrificed whatever flavor the traditional Beck's had. I would much prefer the traditional Becks as it has some resemblance of a german pilsner."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: About what I expected. Should be sapphire, but really fool's gold."
""
""
""
"This is one of the smoothest lagers on the market. No extremely flavors or alcohol content so many will under score this brew. its not imported, thats good news for us beers because this brew is equal to or better than stella. If your looking for an extremely smooth lager this is a fine choice."
""
"Overall a poor euro lager. Stripped of any character in an attempt at smoothness."
"O - Beck's Sapphire manages to bring fourth some hop flavor and presence in an otherwise ordinary ""import"" lager but it doesn't save it from being mundane, like it's awful commercial. This ""German adjunct lager"" isn't worth any elevated cost above the American swill we've already got here. Probably because it's also not made in Germany. It's made in St. Louis."
""
""
"Overall first sip hints at something like a muted pilsner, but then the sweetness (corn?) like taste just starts dominating. The emphasis on making this a hop specialty beer? who could tell.. just another pale euro macro lager for the masses."
"Overall: Not a bad beer at all, doesn't hit you hard in the pockets either it feels and tastes more like a bolder Beck's for the same price why not. Salud!"
""
"I thought this would atleast have some sort of hopiness seeing as its brewed exclusively with sapphire hops, but unfortunately it smells and tastes like most cheap adjunct lagers. I'll stick to prima and urqell when I'm caring a pilsner, which isn't too often."
"Overall – Tastes very much malt liquor like, but without the kick and at much the higher price (and not available in a 40 or tallboy size as any appropriate malt should be). Stick with the classic malts if you are considering this; this is not really a winner for the price."
""
"O: I was glad when I found this as a 16oz single - was interested in giving it a shot but not wanting to invest in the committment that is a six-pack. There was not indication on the can as to what style they were going for and ""Sapphire"" sounded like a Zima reboot or something. BA listed it as a pilsner, which sounds right and it's not a bad effort considering the source. Not exciting, but I've had worse examples from much fancier outfits."
""
""
""
"Picked up a 12oz single for reviewing purposes only. A steady pour raises a nice fluffy white collar...fades slowly. A nice clear light gold underneath. Finely carbonated. Nose - unimpressive domestic lager aromas: sweet malt and a little sourdough thrown in. Average mouthfeel for a light lager, the taste parallels the nose, mainly sweetness with scant hop bitterness. One dimensional. Lightly fruity yet ersatz finish, glad I didn't put out for a sixer. Noticed it says ""product of USA""...'nuff said. Pass."
"I don't enjoy German pilseners with the skunky flavor profile like regular Beck's, but this is worse. Just not a good beer, especially when it touts hops on the label and none are to be tasted."
"the black carp swimming around the bottle in their super bowl ad id's the source, it's from a fish tank."
""
""
"O: I have to say, it isn't completely terrible. Very much in the pilsner vein of things, just a little too safe and restrained. If you're going to feature the sapphire hop as the main marketing point of the beer, I would think you'd want to go a little bigger and bolder with the hop profile. Getting away from the green bottle has done wonders for this beer too, I'm sure. No skunk taste here."
""
""
"O: Don't bother. If you like Beck's stick with Beck's. I'd call this Beck's Ice and price it down about 20%. Usually I'd approve of making a stronger version of the original. If this wasn't so stupidly sweet it would be good."
"The sapphire from Beck's is a smoother version of Beck's regular. The beer pors a golden clear with fuzzy white head that settles quick and does not leave a lace. The smell is very tame, basically nondescript. The taste was a smooth well balanced pilsner. The sapphire hops do not have the same grassy boldness of saaz hops. The mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation. Overall it is a very nice smooth pilsner."
"Overall: bland, unremarkable, underwhelming. This beer isn't even trying."
"12oz bottle. Copper with a rich white head. Loads of thick sticky lacing. Smells floral and earthy wtih some citris notes (lemon sticks out). Touch of Lager must as well. It's got flavor but doesn't remain in the nose for long. The taste has a leafy and citric bite with a bit more sweetness to it than I was expecting (which is maybe brought out even more by the fruitiness of the hops). Feel is medium with a firm snap to it. It's certainly easy drinking for the most part but it plays too fast and loose with the sweetness for a German Pils. The Saphir hops at least add a little something different to what would normally be a pretty boring Lager."
"O: A barely decent German Pilsener. Theres loads of better ones out there."
"I would definitely try again and will be more observant for the next round."
"Overall, it is just an average beer. Kind of reminds of PBR but with more of a jolt."
""
"In some respects I would liken this to a slightly bolder Bud Light Platinum."
""
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket. Pours a light yellow body with little to no head to speak of. Bready malt shares the aroma with a note of spicy continental hops. Spicy herbal hops share the flavor with bready malt. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Not bad. The hop flavor, while far from robust, gives you a good sense of what sapphire hops can bring to the table."
"Not much to add here. I haven't had a Beck's beer since the early 80's and I remember it was decent. This rendition however tastes like cheap malt liquor. What happened? It has no resemblance of the German style beer I remember. It's sweet, tastes of corn and is certainly not worth what I paid. If I get the squirts then I'll know it's just repackaged, beechwood aged spew!"
"O: This is not going to blow anyones' socks off, but for a solid German lager at BMC prices, it certainly works."
""
"Crisp, mellow, and a better defined toasty malt flavor than I expected. Typical grassy hop flavors. A little Earthy. Overall, pretty simple and easy to drink. Worth a try if you like pilsners. I wouldn't mind trying a side by side taste test of Beck's and Sapphire."
"This is barely better than an American Macro beer. Actually, it may not be any better. This was a free sample given to me when I bought a case of Nugget Nectar, and for the price that I'm guessing this costs I would much rather buy PBR or LIon's Head or something...or Genesee"
""
"Overall, regular Beck's is much better than this because it actually has flavor. This beer is seriously lacking the flavor department which is very disappointing. I'm glad I only purchased a single."
""
""
"O - it is what it is."
""
"O-not very flavorful but highly drinkable. Better than your average macro brew, but still not something I would want every day"
"O: Flaws of omission in this fairly well-crafted lager create a smooth, easy drinking beer that's lacking in both flavor and aromatics."
"This hardly resembles a traditional pilsner. More towards a malt liquor without the adjuncts. Catchy name, though. By the way, this was brewed in St. Louis, MO. Beck's has some decent brews for a big brewery, but this is not one of them. Not good."
""
"Not sure why we're still aggregating Beck's under the ""Made In Germany"" banner because I'm one of those who isn't really happy with the move to the USA; but I must admit I was intrigued by an attempt by A-B to provide a Beck's beverage that was a bit different--if not much different--than the green bottled pilsner. I liked the opaque black bottle (no green bottle skunk), though I was surprised at how light (roughly ""gold"") in color the beer was once it hit the glass. I got a decent head of white foam that dissipated quickly and left only a hint on top. I agree with many of the descriptions of the flavor here. Initial biscuity malt and a hint of citrus-like hops in the nose. The carbonation was surprisingly light and ""spritzy"" while the beer itself was light to moderate in density. This made for a strangely mixed yet somewhat refreshing mouthfeel. A tad sweet on the tongue with a mild malty flavor and a hint of that citrusy hops. Flavor profile is one-dimensional and mild. Little bitterness at the end and then nothing. And I mean that in a good way. No off flavors, no skunk--nothing. Clean finish that makes you smack your lips and say, ""gee, I could put a few of these down."" And I did. Bottom line: Unique packaging and very drinkable. Definitely something I'd keep in my fridge from time-to-time."
"Sapphire isn't quite as devoid of flavor as some beers from mainstream producers, but it's still pretty flat for an obvious attempt to siphon from the craft market."

"I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by what turned out to be a decent brew. I don't think that this beer will be a regular addition to my fridge but it may find it's way there occasionally."
""
"Overall I would rate this beer as average. It wasn't as bad as I thought but it was nothing memorable. A good beer to have when nothing else is available."
"Already most bar's selection of beers only include the above list for European beers. Thankfully, I only bought one bottle of this Stuff!"
""
""
"Eh, I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't let down. Maybe if I thought about this as something other than a German Pils, I would be a bit more forgiving. But as it stands, this is anot a good example of that style. If this was a malt liquor or American Lager, I would say that the score would have improved much more. It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't hold a candle to any German Pilsners that I have had."
"Thanks to some boss-ness at my local, the grandiose ticker in me was graced with a single bottle o' this. Always best to assuage that ticking fool... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises partially-artificial-seeming banana, soft wheat, very light sweet flowers, and a hint of biscuit. The taste focuses on the wheat and flowers, but waters them down to keep their edges from showing and adds a heavy splash of sweetness that helps to drown them out regardless. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, if there actually are any hops here, they're completely o'erwhelmed. Regardless, this stuff is meek as all hell for a pils or any other kind of German lager: It's far too sweet for its own good, and any character beyond that is ridiculed into obscurity."

"Picked this up at a grocery store for a dollar a bottle. Poured into a pint glass and yielded about two fingers of white head. The color was very light and clear. Tasted like a very sweet lager with no aftertaste. I would drink this on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn. Overall, it was a nice light change from stouts and IPA's I usually drink."
"3/2.5/2.75/3/2.75"
"Poured aggressively into a glass. Bready aromas, faint skunk noted in previous entries. Golden color, two-finger creamy, foamy head. No lacing, but ring of foam on top of beer. Light carbonation emanating from the bottom. Malty taste and mouthfeel. A whisper, virtually non-existent, of hop bitterness. Being maltier than regular Beck's, it leaves a coating around the mouth. Almost overwhelmingly sweet. A ""fuller," maltier version of Bud. Nothing special."

"Eh. Grain, lightly toasted malt are good, but the skunky character is offputting."
""
""
"Hmm. I had to try this one when it came out. It pours a light amber/ golden with a white head that dissapears as fast as you can pour. what little foam remains leaves some slight lacing. It smells like watered down beer, some malt and what I assume are the ""Sapphire hops"". The taste is soapy to the point that I dumped my first beer out and rinsed the glass, only to find out that it was the beer. It has a light mouthfeel with some moderate, prickly carbonation. Overall, Pretty gross."

"A different recipe from regular Becks lager that dials down the sharp bitterness to a mellow and rounded flavor that is very pleasant and easy to drink, if slightly underwhelming. Unfortunately ""pleasant"" soon turns to monotonous, and this beer simply doesn't have enough character to qualify as sessionable. One bottle is enough, and the palate craves something else."
""
"Taste-Pale malt, very faint hop prescence, rather creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a very ho-hum pilsner."
""
"I'm very surprised by this!! I think it's more in the Euro Pale Lager catagory but their not a huge difference anyhow and I'm no expert. Very different yet cool black bottle, you can barely see through it. I'm short glasses so ill have to stick to that. Smell is pretty faint, average pilsner, nothing ou of the ordinary. The taste however really caught me off guard. It's very sweet upfront then buttery, slight breadlines, followed by more sweet. It's had a really nice creamy velvet mouthfeel I haven't experienced in a pilsner before, but I really like it, goes down real easy. I don't consider 6%abv high but it's more than average BMC's. Overall I can't wait to try this again and this is definetly something I'd keep in my fridge on a regular basis."

"I purchased this beer today with no preconceived notions. I had never seen, read or heard of this before I saw it in the store. I generally don't purchase Becks although I do like German Pils'. I am utterly let down about the beer overall. This beer tastes almost exactly like the Budweiser Platinum without the heavy alcohol hit at the end. It has no hints of hops at all and no malt taste. I read the back of the beer and it plainly states, Brewed in St. Louis MO. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the base grain bill for this beer is almost identical to Budweiser. My guess is InBev is going after the hipster market that won't purchase Bud Platinum. I would suggest this to anyone that likes light American Lagers, otherwise move on."
"Overall a tasty beer but nothing really different. Will be an excellent hot weather beer."
"Big corn flavour, grainy, non sweet malt, light but not pleasant bitterness. Fancy looking bottle but it's what inside that counts and the beer doesn't count for much. An AB-InBev fail. Kicking up the abv and putting it in a brown bottle does not make it an auto better brew."

"Overall this isn't much of a beer. I think it's budweiser in a black Beck's bottle. In fact the bottle says St. Louis , Mo."
