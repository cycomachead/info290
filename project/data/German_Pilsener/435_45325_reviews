"Wonderful color for a pilsner.  A much more full taste than what we're used to seeing at the gas station"

"O: There is a harshness to the alcohol of this beer which is surprising since it clocks in at only 5.5% but I guess I cannot be too surprised considering the price ($.67 for a single can). Not offensive but not a beer that I would seek out again. I could see serving this at a tailgate where the majority of folks were not into craft beers as something different but still enjoyable (maybe a slight gateway beer to trying something different)."

"Overall: There is taste there, doesn't feel watered down, and is of extremely good value. Great budget buy."
"O: I can't hate on it for $4 a six pack. Just like its identical cousin, it's a great choice for cheap drunkery. It's just a bit crisper/drier than its aforementioned cousin, and would make a decent hot weather beer. Personally though, I'd rather drink something else."
"This would make an awesome lawnmower beer. It's very easy to drink and the price is attractive. It gives me hope for the other varieties that are available."
""
""
"I tried this out because I like Trader Joe's other products and I think they only carry quality stuff, but their beer only can be described as ""passable."" It has an average taste but nothing distinctive about it. Its also not as clean and crisp as a pilsner should be."
""
""

"O-I was surprised that in the end this beer was too weak for my blood."

"Mixed six from Trader Joe's in Tally.  Drank in the hotel room while up there visiting FSU for Hadley."

"Simpler times is a brand sold at Trader Joe's for $3.49 a 6-pack. An ale, a lager, and a pilsner are all offered, reviewed here is the pilsner. The pilsner pours a pale golden color, darker than straw, about the same as a Budweiser, with a nice soapy head and some satisfying lacing on the glass. A very pleasing aroma; sweet malts, grassiness, and a slightly metallic scent. The taste is very appealing, a soft graininess, cereal, sweet grass, some herbal and mineral tastes show up in the finish. I feel like this may come from the varieties of hops used and they fit nicely in the profile. A sip sits nicely in the mouth with a medium-thin body and a nice level of carbonation that doesnt over-do it. This is not a complex brew by any means, but it's more pleasant and drinkable than you would expect. A drawback is the sweetness that become somewhat cloying after several beers, but It's become my everyday session beer based on its price, availability and drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. Another of the Trader Joe's bargain brands, it's much better than their Name Tag, but I prefer the tasty Simpler Times Lager. If you're looking for a cheap six pack of beer, it's hard to beat. Much better than any of the macro brews on the market."
""
""
""
""
"O: Better than most macrobrews for literally half the price. I'll take it."
"RJT"
""
"Overall - I would recommend this brew to anyone who appreciates a flavorful non-macro beer that isn't too full of itself. Also, it's Vegan, which is interesting"
""
""
"Overall, however, this beer is just dull and earthy in an unsatisfying way. It is not as offensive as the descriptors I used above would indicate, but I'd never call this a good beer."
""
"I wish the big breweries tasted like this one Great BEER!!!! Thank you trader joe! The two buck chuck of beer!"
"Poured this German Pilsener from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. This Pils poured a clear golden color. The aroma consisted of husked malt and lemongrass. Light in body, this Pilsner had a foundation of malted grain, a husky bite that brings a nice level of complexity to a traditional style. Here is just a touch of citric bittering hops that round out the swallow. Finish is dry. Overall, a nice brew and an excellent buy at 1.00 a can at Trader Joes. If your going to serve a Pilsner on a hot summer day, check this one out your pallet and your wallet will be glad you did!"
"Nothing too special about this pilsner, besides the price ($3.49 for a 6-pack). I can see this beer being consumed in about any whore movie."
"Minhas Simpler Times Pilsner ---3/5."
""
"You pretentious jerks need to get past the price of this beer and realize that just because you not getting ripped off doesn't mean it can't be good I'd bet the farm that if I put this beer in front of you in some foolish glass and told you it was from a brewery in Germany and cost $4 a bottle you simple minded fool would be creaming all over it this is a solid brew for an unbelievable price"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad pilsner, just nothing special. Not a bad go to beer for about 4 bucks a 6 pack. Throw it in the cooler for a hot summer fishing trip day, or mowing the lawn."
"Further proof that there is absolutely no reason to buy a big macro beer. This is a simple decent quality American lager. Nothing special but nothing offensive. Light body with a tinge of bitterness. $3.49 for a 6-pack at Trader Joes. Lawnmower beer at its best."

"-Overall 3.5: I don't understand all the snob reviews for this beer. Yes it is cheap, yes it comes in a can and yes it is brewed with adjuncts, but so what? This is a very good beer and does not do all the nasty things to your system that many more expensive US macros are wont to do. One of my favorite ""go to"" session beers and it will not leave you with a bad hangover. Heartily recommended."
""
"This poured a clear golden straw with light foam that rapidly dissipates. There’s an aroma of cereal malts & corn, followed by … no hops to speak of. The flavor is musty & on the sweet side with some light bittering but not much other than carbonation to speak of. It has all that musty corn adjunct lager flavor with not as much of the nasty aftertaste as a Bud, as well as and a little more malt body. Still, pass. At least it’s cheap."
""
""
"Overall - Very hard to finish... pretty poor. I'd take a coors light over it, there're just too many off flavors to even remotely enjoy it. It tastes very corn forward, but there's no ""crackery"" backend to provide back to the sweetness."
"D"
""
""
""
"Tastes rich and malty/grainy, with a buttery toast character and only a slight hops presence. Nice body, and quite drinkable, though not one I'd pursue again, even at the Trader Joe's budget $3.99/6pk price."
""
"thank you trader joe! 2nd time trying TJs Simpler Times - first time i thought i was crazy. simpler times indeed... this beer tastes like what i thought beer would taste like when my dad and friends were knocking them back way back when... this is what budweisenheimer etc should taste like... its so fresh and so clean but with a malty little snap. and the hops are there just popping up a bit to tell you HI... its more complex than the label lets on - each little sip hits a little different - and your taste buds dont get worn out like with a raging IPA or some such stuff (which is good but c'mon - it is summer in TX at the moment...) its just good easy drinkin beer... but inneresting enuff to keep you looking forward to the next sip... and the price is crazy - really this is better than many other beers for its style and i've had similar in the upper price rangers - and I WISH the big macros tasted like this... this stuff is GOOD BEER!!!! thank you trader joe!!! i'll drive to Ft Worth to stock up no problem!!! good stuff!!!"

"Overall this American take on a German pilsener matches every characteristic of the style. Easy to drink and only $.67 a can or 3.99 a six pack. This is a bang for you buck kind of beer."
"Surprisingly good for $3 a 6-pack."
"Overall - Not sure that I'd call this a pilsener. Would compare favorably to many macrobrews, but lacks any real interesting characteristics."
""
"IF you're considering buying it, then stop considering. Just do it. $4 for a 6-pack is a much better price than you'll find on pretty much anything else and it's actually fairly good."
"Feels medium to light in body, dry to the palate, and yet thirst quenching. I'd say this is not of the German style too. Maybe a strong Czech. I don't know what the preprohibition pils tastes like, so I cannot say this is what it is."
""
""
"For 3.99 I'm not sure as why some people are bashing it. What did you really expect for 3.99? I mean really....It's 3.99 for 6 beers. Find that in any bar or pub. Anyway....It's an easy drinker that actually has some flavor compared to most cheapsters in a can. I'm not goanna fluff up the review with a bunch of adjectives either. Find a Trader Joes and pick up a 6-er. If you don't like it hand it out as a courtesy beer for those that show up and never bring anything."
""
"Overall pretty bad but not horrible, not coors light or Bud level of terribleness, its more of a macro extract like beer but a bit higher level than the crappy crap that's usually out there."
""
"Overall: as I said, it's not a great beer, but it is palatable and moderately drinkable. For a beer in this price range (like $2.50 for a six-pack), it's pretty damn good, actually."
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow with a bubbly white head that tends to vanish quickly. Leaves some lacing as the head disappears. Light malty and mild Belgian yeast aromas. Decent mouthfeel and good carbonation. A pilsner that behaves like a lager, but well worth the few bucks I paid for a sixer of cans."
""
""
""
"Not a bad cheap Pils at all. Yeah, a bit adjuncty, but surprising hop balance helps a lot. Crazy drinkable, I’m thirsty and this is hitting the spot. Considering the price, this is pretty good and my score reflects its price to performance ratio. Noticeably better than other beers in its price range, but certainly doesn't stack up to better and more expensive Pilsners."
"Pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Random dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, light fruits, and alcohol. There is an almost artificial margarita smell to this one. Taste is of grains, corn flakes, alcohol, and some light fruity flavors. There is a mild bitterness in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer but decent for the price ($0.50 a can). I could see myself stocking these for a party with non-craft beer drinkers."
""
"O - an average beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-- Meh. This is better than the regular lager, but it is another beer I don't care to drink again."
""
"Drinkability- I would drink it again. Very drinkable and easy to drink, not spectacular but still pretty good, not bad either. It is also cheaper than Bud and tastes better."
"Unremarkable but not bad by any means."
"O - I paid $2.49 for a 6 pack and I can say I got what I expected. This stuff is incredibly cheap tasting, but, for the price its a solid option. I'd rather drink this than majority of the big beer swill you see everywhere else. Glad to try it."
"Not sure I could drink more than 3 or 4 of these at a time so I can't see it being a lawnmower beer, but for one or two after work this is a great beer. Probably will make a few more trips to Trader Joes to pick this one up again."
"This is a very unpleasant beer to drink. Never again."
"I don’t know. Is it supposed to have this extreme sweetness?"
"all in all, not bad... but not great by any stretch. for the price though, wow. can't really complain that much. it doesn't seem like a true german pilsner, but a six pack is cheaper than most singles, so I'm decently happy and will drink again."
"Average beer..not really a pilsner, but OK."
"Overall, not a bad little beer, and this price is right. This might be a cheap summer sixer that I take hiking and camping."
"O: There are a lot of pictures of The Band during the Big Pink era sitting back, laughing, playing, creating while drinking Piels Real Draft. Simpler Times reminds me of what I think that beer would have been. Maybe it just has to do with the name and how I want to associate this beer with those pictures, a simpler time of just being at the top of your game and creating something timeless. Is this beer timeless? No. But, it’s the times you have and the people you’re with while drinking this that matter. Back yard bbq’s, acoustic guitar songs, the sun setting, a baseball game on somewhere in the background… At least I’d like to think so."
"O: pretty good for the price, nice relaxing beer. I've probably have bought it 4 or 5 times now, so I enjoy it and would recommend it"
"All in all, not bad, and a great deal for the price point at 50 cents a can. Surely I've drank far worse. In some perverse way, it's so jarring to have actual hop bitterness in a cheap beer, and it may have hurt my review; rather than comparing this to its true price-point competition -- Natural Ice, Icehouse, High Life -- I find myself yearning for a Prima Pils. And perhaps that's not fair. I'll put it this way -- the beer was worth the 2.99 that I spent on the six pack. You can draw your own conclusions from there."
"Overall, this is a decent brew which is somewhat appealing at the price point and the fact that it's canned. Not necessarily a standalone brew I'd drink, but definitely would be appealing for a summer BBQ."
"Available in cans at Trader Joes."
"O: Simpler Times Pils was an unexpected and enjoyable surprise. Is it a classical German Pils? Nope, though it certainly is an easy drinking summertime lawnmower beer. All things considered, this a budget friendly session lager you don't have to feel ashamed to keep in the fridge. Thumbs up."
"Minhas Brewery Simpler Times Pilsner is cheap (read: inexpensive) beer that tastes cheap (read: not good). It's a sad and pathetic state of affairs that I would still prefer this stuff to the most popular lagers in America, circa 2011."
"Simply put this is a cheap american pilsener made primarily for ease in drinking on a warm summer day. Flavor wise it has no extraordinary qualities, but no real flaws either. Mild, soft malt flavors with a simple and somewhat thin body. Refreshing in that it lacks the metallic flavors a lot of other heavily adjuncted beers have. I'm convinced this is the same beer as their lager, only lacking in said adjuncts."
"This beer might be one of the best values on the market. I can't believe I waited so long to finally try this, it's a solid Pils at an unbeatable price..."
"From a 12 oz. can. Pours a lightly-hazed solid gold, with low carbonation and two fingers of frothy head that retains well and tries to lace the glass. Floral and spicy hops in the nose, with corn and light malt. Tastes almost metallic, grainy, with sweet corn, piney/citric hops that contribute a moderate bitterness, and a distinct, nearly overbearing apple ester from the yeast. The body is crisp, dry and light. Not as sweet and a bit more hoppy than the other Minhas lagers I've had, which is nice. If you are at Trader Joe's and trying to choose between Simpler Times lager and pilsner, go for this one."
"Pretty much my go-to cheap beer if I'm too broke/cheap to afford 'gansett or PBR, which isn't too often."
"The tatse is not complex, but it is tasty! There is a nice bready-ness to it and the alcohol hits nicely on the tounge. Of course, the name does it justice: Simpler Times. And That is exactly what it is, a great SIMPLE beer. One that I could easily make a night out of."
"D: overall, good beer with a really cheap price tag. got mine at a trader joe's for $3.99. kinda hard to argue with that when macro-canned piss is more expensive."
"D: This is a damn good beer that happens to sell for under $1 a can. Oh, for simpler times!"
"I'm drinking my first can but I can see this becoming a good standby beer when my own Ale keg runs dry."
"Drinkability is ok. I like it better than most budget type beers in its category."
"overall you get what you pay for sometimes, no more on this one"
"50 cents? Can't go too wrong there, even if in a creepy can. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a short finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, grass, flowers, greens, and a hint of pepper. The taste is very similar, with the addition of light orange peel and even lighter banana. The body is rather light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp feel. Overall, a kinda surprisingly nice pils; not the best out there, but plenty of enjoyment for the price."
"D- This beer was a little too much for me. And by too much I mean off putting bitterness to this beer. I didn't really like the taste or the aftertaste. Don't really like this one too much but it does taste about average and on par with more adjunct lagers."
"D- not bad. Ryan gave me this as a joke beer but its not that funny."
"While this beer may not be for every BA type, it does have a strong point; it's cheap at $2.99 a six-pack. Given that and the fact it doesn't taste bad, you'd think beer pongers and broke college kids would be filling their refrigerators with this stuff."
"Pretty good beer, great price, and a bit less harsh (and a little lower ABV) than its lager sister beer. I drink it ""castle temperature"" (stored in my non-heated cement-slab garage) and find it preferable that way to refrigerated. The famed Trader Joe's detectives must have made some kind of offer to this brewer to exchange volume they could never have dreamed of for a bargain price, but I'll raise a can to capitalism since it's to the beer aficinado's benefit. Spend what you save on the beer on some of TJ's awesome nuts."
"Solid all around, everything you want in a Retro Lager--drinkability, clean palate and just enough flavor to be different from the mainstream. A fun, no-brainer beer that is perfect for a few rounds of slop cricket."
"Overall a beer to drink when it is hot and with friends. No frills and for $3.99 a six pack at Trader Joes."
"Did I mention it's inexpensive? $2.99 for a six pack of cans at Trader Joe's in California. If you have to have this kind of beer and it has to be in a can, you can pay more and get worse with little effort."
"I can't say a lot for this beer because it really isn't very complex. Just disappointing. Hard to call it a German Pilsner...more like an American adjunct gone bad or poorly brewed."
"D: This is one of those beers that should be consumed as cold and as quickly as possible. I honestly cannot recommend this beer to anyone."
"Taste is gently sweet, with some malty grain carried by the somewhat creamy mouthfeel. An ok pils, even better price."
"Drinkability: This beer is extremely drinkable and extremely refreshing. Its far from the best beer out there (even of its style), but its low price tag (cost me $4.64 for a canned six pack after tax- in NYC) makes this one a HUGE bargain. It isn't complex, but has enough flavor to be decent. A good session beer, or good to have around as just a refresher. If the price were higher, this would be so much less worthy."
"D- above."
"D: On a hot day I can imagine going through these quickly."
"D - For ultra-cheap beer, this is pretty dang good. It doesn't taste like a pilsener, and there is a malt-liquor roughness to it but hey, what do ya expect for a coupla bucks?"
"[thanks for mnwags for this one!]"
"Light bodied, fizzy. It's a typical Adjuct lager build. And features similar drinkability to other low-rung examples of the style. If considered a true pils, the scores would drop substancially."
"Heavier in body than macros and tastier too. It retains the fizz and refreshing bits and turns its back on the Bud Light version of drinkability."
"A cheap pilsner that is easy to drink and tastes alright too. Nothing spectacular, and has a bit of corn taste it seems, but quite decent for what it is."
"Very clear, clean, golden straw body. Foamy finger of cottony white head. Does not stick around that long. Nose of honeyish malts, a little corn or rice, and some spicy, slightly herbal hops. Soft, slightly sweet toasted malt up front. A little honey and a little cereal-y graininess. Mild hop flavor and bitterness. A little peppery with an herbal twang. Clean finish with lingering honey cereal. Moderate body with not overly fizzy feel. Crisp and refreshing for a hot summer day. Not bad, especially for the price."
"Pours a straw yellow color, with a huge, foamy white head. Smells grainy, sweet and a little like corn. Not a whole lot going on in the taste department either, just carbonation and adjuncts. Thought for the price ($2.99 at Trader Joes), and considering the lager was pretty decent, that this might be a good buy. I was wrong."
"Hey, what the heck is going on, my Trader Joe's is $3.99 a 6er"
"D: Not fabulous, but not bad. Certainly would buy it throughout the summer when I'll have no income. :)"
"This beer is what is says, simpler times. I will actually keep some on hand for myself for evenings on the patio with a fire going in the pit. Is it a Bell's or a Great Lakes? No. But it has it's place."
"This is a drinkable-enough beer. I had some while grilling, and also used it in onion-ring batter which was acceptable."
"D: Probably the best thing about this beer is how sessionable it is, though I would definitely grab something else if given the choice. But hey, at around .50c per can I can't really complain."
"Pilsners are supposed to have a hop presence, and this one does, but it's still too sweet to allow me to drink a lot of these. Still. at 67¢ a can I can't complain."
"Drinkability- I'd rather have one over a BMC, but not by a wide margin."
"Overall a tough one to drink. Oh, and not a pils."
"It is not bad looking it has a very clear finish to its yellow body. It has an average head with loose lace. This beer is sort of cheap tasting it reminds me of malt liquor. It has a fruity adjunct after taste. It has a some what fruity and bitter flavor. It is very thin with some bite."
"Nothing mind blowing here, but this beer is incredibly easy to drink. There is a decent crispness. Hops are present - just not as present as I would like. The fact is that at $3.99/6 pack it's hard to find beer this drinkable. There's nothing offensive here - just a totally decent pilsner. Recommended."
"drinkability - I wouldn't necessarily go for this, but in a brandy glass, it tasted much better than I thought. I would drink this if nothing else was available."
"My pour created a foamy, soapy bone-white head that was bursting with CO2 bubbles, trying to settle down like a group of rowdy freshmen when the principal enters the room unannounced. It had about the same success, finally becoming a thick two-fingered cap. The color was a deep golden-yellow with only the slightest haze, but still very clear, enabling me to read signage on the other side of the room. The nose was slightly sweet, definitely a German-style Pilsner and certainly a lager beer. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant honey/lager taste on the tongue. Not bad, but more lager-like than pilsner-like. Finish was again on the sweet side, not to my taste. Oh well. I'll keep trying."
"Tastes like something AB would come up with to compete with good beer."
"D> This would actually probably be pretty good ice cold on a hot day. Even in the winter time I don't think I would have a problem knocking back a few of these if I didn't have anything else in the fridge."
"M/D - This is a pretty average pilsner, it goes down very easy and even could be called refreshing."
"Quite different than the Lager, this beer is best poured quite slowly to minimize the resilient foam and let the hops participate."
"This may only be $2.99, but it is not worth drinking. I had to try it out of curiousity, but I am surprised Trader Joe stocks such a lame beverage. Terrible beer."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these, but the quality seems way too long for even an attempt at a Pils. Most of the beers at TJs I can do, but this one's something that I wouldn't try again unless it was hot out, the beer was ice cold, and there was nothing else. But I may opt to snag another 6-pack of something else at a local mini-mart, especially if there was one nearby."
"Taste: Less taste then smell it starts out with a sweet taste leading into a very tiny hop flavor at the end. This taste is not at all what I would expect with a pilsner considering there is very little hop flavor at all."
"T/M/D-Expected more based on the smell. Semisweet and a little bitterness on the back end. A crisp, fizzy mouthfeel and an easy drink. Not my favorite style of beer, but did my best to rate it for what it is."
"Drinkability: Not recommended. Again, I'll say it's suspiciously similar to the Simpler Times lager. Even for a simple pilsner, it's a below average, underperfomer."
"Will buy again, probably a case, for the next time I BBQ,"
"Not sure why everyone's beefing on this beer--maybe it's that it's miscast as a macro lager. I'd put it more in the range of a Czech pilsner--tasted like Pilsner Urquell to me, except fresher and thus better. Kind of a hobo's Duvel, without any of the manic yeast or deceptive bulk on its grain. Anyway, at 4 or 5 bucks a sixer, I'm not complaining. Went great with buffalo wings and hockey on the tube."
"Overall: a good lager with nice phenols (which was suprising). crisp and clean flavor, good for a hot spring or summer day. Underrated on BA."
"Pours a clear straw color with almost no head whatsoever. Smells only of sweet adjuncts mostly corn. Not much malt presence in the nose. First sip is bland cereal and just a tad of hop bitterness. Not much positive aspects in this one. Simpler Times needs more complexity."
"Pours clear yellow with a solid white head. Soft, sweet aroma...lightly floral and bready. Tastes like a fairly average American lager. Grainy and sweet. Light and crisp. Obviously not very inspiring stuff. Sort of reminds me of the simpler times though...and how I don't drink beer like this anymore."
"D: Pretty high drinkability. I don't really like the metallic taste. From what I remember, I actually prefer the Simpler Times lager."
"(NOTE 4/2011- review submitted when still classified as an adjunct lager. as a german pils, the score should be lower. for now, the overall score is being changed from 4.0 to 3.0)"
"D: Not terrible (and certainly better than the Simpler Times Lager), but, even at Trader Joe's, there are better choices."
"I gues for $4.99 I shouldn't expect any better - I was just hoping that TJs quality standards might help - to no avail. I will try to pawn the rest off on the neighbors - quite dissapointing."
"Decent head with little or no lacing. Appeasing clean - golden color. Smells of bread and some other unusual corn. The smell should warn you of the taste. Semi-sweet initial flavor that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Light mouthfeel and a generally flat, under carbonated feel. Would not recommend based on that unusual smell and bitter aftertaste - hard to drink more than one."
"Cheap and better of the two Simpler Times."
"Pours a golden color with a small white head that soon fades to a fine film and holds. The Aroma is unremarkable--some faint corn and breads. The taste is much better than the aroma would suggest with a bit of fruit and some good yeasty biscuit emerging and lingering. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the finish is short and clean. In conclusion, not a bad little pils at all."
"Pleasant muted malty flavor. Rather thin body but equally low carbonation. Light hop--not really present in the shortlived aftertaste."
"The taste is similar, mostly a decent pale lager with fruity grain plus noticeable hops, mostly grassy. It starts somewhat sweet before a more bitter finish, but it's all a little off. It has an odd, light, faintly acrid, cooked vegetable-old-grass-burnt butter quality that I have encountered in sub-par lagers sometimes, and this taste and the bitterness are a bit rough and faintly unpleasant. However, these qualities do not detract too much and overall it's still basically drinkable. It's not terrible, but it almost is."
"Not completely sure this is superior to the BMC style beers or not. Tastes like it was fermented hot or with sugar to boost alcohol levels. Pretty sure I won't be buying this again."
"This is barely average but you could do much worse, especially for the price. Nice in a pinch, like the week before payday."
"D'ability - Flavor a bit disappointing - the Simpler Times Lager was cheaper and a bit better in my view. Not a clean, refreshing lager."
"single from Trader Joe's Reston"
