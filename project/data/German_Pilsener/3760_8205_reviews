"There is really not much to write about here. It is brightly coloured and has a finger of fizzy head that does not hang around for long. There is a bit of a floral aroma and some sweet bread in the flavour. I would be hard pressed to tell this apart from most macro lagers. If it's better for our world because it is organic, groovy. As a beer, it's really not my thing."

"Nice touch with the ""organic lager"" marketing but that in itself will not turn an average beer into a good one."

"This beer tasted so close to a a traditional Belgian beer, I couldn't tell the difference.  The beer looks ok, and smells light but the flavor is top notch.  I just wish they would remove the word ""Organic"" from the label.  Adds nothing to the desire to drink it."

"Overall: Easy drinking beer. A bit too sweet and light for my taste, but a decent choice to introduce a commercial beer drinker to craft beer."

"Pours a fairly clear straw color with a huge frothy bubbly white head that persists. Bready earthy light fruity aroma with a hint of floral hop. Bready sweet maltiness with a hint of fruit and spice. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent lager with a nice breadiness."

"Good, but nothing extraordinary. Extremely crisp, clean, and clear. High carbonation, wispy yet creamy head. Medium sweetness. Mildly hoppy."

"Had on tap at a small pub/eatery in Calgary (Blind Monk). Beer arrived in a pint glass, a pale lemon drop yellow with one finger or so of white head. Aroma very subdued but maybe my sense of smell isn't so great ... I do get a little sweet bread pilsner malt and a few floral noble hop notes. Not much of an odor however. Fortunately the taste is more interesting. Oddly enough I get some fruit notes (banana, pineapple, a bit of vanilla creme perfume) and a green malt juiciness. The whole package is quite sweet but well-carbonated, hops could be more pronounced but I do get the sweet hay flavor and watermelon rind-like green bitterness that I also taste in Sam Adams Boston Lager and other lagers that feature Hallertau hops (apparently grown in New Zealand rather than Germany, where organic versions are currently unavailable ... Could this account for the different fruit notes described earlier?). Finish pretty clean and crisp although there are clearly some residual sugars. Its not an earth-shatteringly great pilsner but I will say that this brew is better on tap. Bottles I have had were more flat, bland, and devoid of the interesting flavors I could detect here."

"EDIT: had this again August 1, 2014, and noticed that it did match up with the previous ratings and flavours with one exception. The beer I enjoyed had a much stronger cracker and biscuit like flavor to it than I recall. Not sure why the discrepancy, but it was enough to be noticed. Still a decent Ontario Pilsner."
""
""
"Tastes as light as it is at 4.2%, tastes all-malt (what little malt is there) and with very little hops. Overall the small amount of hops dominates the small amount of malt. One of the few beers I drink cold."

"Overall, not a very impressive beer. I'd rather have Mill Street's Stock Ale over this any day of the week."
""
""
"Overall - 2/5 Side note: A pils plain enough to be mistaken for an american adjunct. Not that it's necessarily bad, its just that it isn't really anything. 'Beer' flavoured beer?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The fact that it's organic doesn't matter to me. What I do like is it's a fairly widely available beer that most people who aren't craft beer drinkers can still agree on. Great for sharing a pitcher with friends."
""
"Far from amazing, a half-decent lager that I would reach for before others at a party or the dock, simply because it doesn't taste like water. Still a lot to wish for tho, middle of the road, but nice for summer session beer."

"Final Thoughts: This beer is as advertised; a micro-brewed lager. They seem to have followed common sense and left out any adjuncts. There are some real nice flavors in this one that stay true to the style. While it isn't more that just a slightly above average beer, it's still a far cry from the macro-lagers that elude all conventional wisdom and fly off the shelves."

"Overall- A simple Euro Pale Lager by Mill Street. The flavours are not complex, nor should they be. This brew is kept clean and simple, making it a refreshing summer session brew."

"O- Refreshing and satisfying, everything you need in a light lager."

"O - A very easy drinking beer and a a decent tasting beer at 4.2%."

""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium light and smooth. Not bad at all. Clean taste and well balanced. Too bad about the clear bottle."
""
"I enjoy other mill st beers but this one is sub par. It could be a great beer but needs more attention in the brewhaus."

"O: Another brew from Mill street that is below par of what they should be selling. Wouldn't have it again."
"This beer is fine overall, nothing I find particularly interesting or flavourful. Throw it in the ""good craft alternative at crappy aal-happy bars""."
"An okay but ultimately dull lager. The flavours aren’t crisp enough and the slightly sweet malt kills everything."
"overall it was better than i was expecting - not spectacular but certainly enjoyable."
"Overall – Definitely better than the countless macro lagers on the market. I could easily drink a lot of this stuff on a camping trip or any activity outdoors."
"This beer is pretty much a standard yellow lager. There is very little aroma, and what there is is vaguely bready and sweet with zero hops presence. The taste is sweet and bready, with very little bitterness, and that's about all. It may be micro-brewed and organic, but flavour-wise it tastes like a mass-produced factory beer. There is nothing bad about it, it's just not that good; and it certainly isn't worth paying any extra money for."
"O - this sat in my fridge for a few weeks after I received it from my wife in a mixer pack - it is not my style and I had no real interest in trying it so I was surpised when I found it drinkable although I would never pass up an average ale instead of it."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. It's great for a warm summer day."
"This is either a different recipe or benefits from not being packaged in clear bottles, but in my opinion this is a much more drinkable, aromatic, flavourful, smooth experience with the can. Good thing, a 12 cost me $31."
"D - Although I didn't expect to enjoy this all that much, and didn't, I must say kudos to Mill Street for brewing this beer organically. Just not really my thing."
"Overall. Not bad, but nothing particularly appealing here except for the fact that it's organic."
"Final Grade: 3.16, a C+."
"This beer is nothing special overall, except the gimmick of being organic. It is refreshing though, only try if your into light beers."
"Definately the least interesting of the Mill Street lineup but not terrible for the style. This was my first Mill Street brew, back when I would scam these baby bottle beers off my pops."
"D - very one dimensional, easy drinking but only because it's thin and generic, one of their poorer offerings, i suspect they are simply capitalizing on the whole ""organic"" buzz, which people don't even understand"
"The drinkability is good. A bit more refreshing than most average lagers / pilseners."
"i'm not sure that thirst quenching should be a priority in a beer. i prefer to savour fine flavors and aromas. but this beer does hit the spot."
"D - Good drinkable."
"D: It is one of the better examples of the style I have had. If you rate this beer to style it has to get a decent review. Not something I would seek out but this would be great on a hot summer day."
"Pours a clear straw-yellow colour that started with big white head after a vigorous pour. Head dissipates after a minute or so leaving a hint of spotty lacing. Smells very clean of grain and faint grassy hops. Flavour has a hint of bitterness, but very clean. Carbonation level is pretty nice for the style. I only buy this beer at bars without better selection (though typically pubs in Toronto that have this also have Tankhouse as well) or as part of the Mill Street seasonal packs when I want the other beers. I usually just leave this and the Stock for guests that come over though."
"Quite clearly made for organic people that are BMC lovers, not craft drinkers. Looking for craft organic? Drink a Beau's."
"341ml bottle from the Seasonal Sampler mix pack. Pours a bright golden yellow with one finger of foamy white head and drapes of lacing on the lager glass. Lots of carbonation in the body. Smell and taste are creamed corn, cooked veggies, metal, light floral, grains of some sort, water, flavourless malts, empty hop spiciness, a bit salty. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium, almost slick, crisp bite mid-palate, fleeting dryness, no aftertaste. Inoffensive but characterless, and sadly I think that's what the brewer was aiming for. An accessible beer for the masses, this lacks soul, flavour, and good traits in general. Not a terrible lager, just way too uninteresting. I won't purchase again."
"Has a thin body, is smooth with medium carbonation."
"D - Nothing mind blowing, but still quite delicious. Very tasty, and would be very tasty on a hot summer afternoon."
"D: Drinks quite easily."
"Mill Street Organic Lager pours a clear light gold with not much of a head. The aroma is slightly sweet and grainy, with maybe just a touch of sulfur (it was purchased in an enclosed six pack and transferred straight to the fridge, but still just a hint of skunk). Not much going on in the flavor, some graininess and just a touch of light malty sweetness. No hop flavor is noticeable, but there is a twang of bitterness in the finish. The beer is fairly full bodied considering the flavor. Organic beers don't have to be bland and boring, but this one certainly is!"
"D- Easy enough to drink but it is not a beer that I would buy again."
"Great beer."
"drinkability is actually pretty good. this is the first time i've tried this one, and i'll admit to not being a lager-head or having high expectations of it, but i've been pleasantly surprised by this. while i don't know that i'd go looking for it since it's not one of my favourite styles, it's a pretty good example of that style and one i wouldn't turn my nose up at. served cold on a warm day it'd be pretty nice."
"Overall, bland and uninteresting. It only really has one note, and absolotely no hops. Not bad as an alternative to american lagers, but nothing I would actively seek out."
"Not bad! This is quite drinkable. I actually bought a six of this to use in making pizza dough but would potentially buy it in the summer to drink ice-cold on a scorching day; it's that kind of beer for sure."
"Mouthfeel is fine and although I don't love it, it would still be easy to drink a few if I was thirsty..."
"Drinkability - this is fairly expensive but this is also a highly drinkable beer that I could easily pack away quite a few of these."
"The clear bottle gives it a Corona look but this beer has a much fuller mouthfeel and great hop profile. Very pale in colour this is decent clean lager that has the all malt taste and not over sweetness that I look for in a craft lager ( not a pils but more modeled on a North American lager). Came as part of mixed six pack but I would consider buying this again next summer."
"hippies will feel good about themselves drinking this organic lager, you however may regret spending the extra money too drink average beer"
"A fairly refreshing quaff, but not really anything remotely near a German Pils. That bit of pedantry aside, it went well enough with some decent chain restaurant pulled pork. Also, no booze essence swirling about me when I head back to the client's offices."
"Light bodied and gassy. It's a thirst quencher on a hot day, but that carbonation is a bit much."
"This was actually a surprisingly decent beer. Came in a clear bottle, which had me worried. Poured pale yellow, with a thin foam. The foam stayed, however. Bit of a light caramel and malt smell, with some light honey and I think apricot scent. Some sort of fruit that I could not quite figure out. Tasted good. Nice blend of honey, caramel, various fruits both sweet and sour, and finished slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is a tad thin. Overall, a good session or lawn mower beer."
"Really clean taste and, honestly, not bad for a lager; it has to be up there with Creemore's for one of the better Ontario lagers. Grains (a bigger grain profile than the average), again that slightly off fruit note, that lager aftertaste. Slightly too much carbonation for my liking (belching like a sailor). Pretty standard craft pale lager - not much to really like but drinkable in a pinch on a warm summer day - especially if faced with this or a macro."
"I've long held the theory that organic beers are brewed more to cash in on the organic trend by brewing a middle-of-the-road, watered down macro-esque beer that won't put people who aren't used to good beer off than they are about brewing a world class beer using organic ingredients, and I think this is a textbook example of this."
"Other than this being a style I don't usually drink, I have nothing to say against this beer. It isn't particularly exciting, but it doesn't seem to have any flaws. Pale yellow pour with a bubbly white head that quickly dssipates to a film. Clean grain, sweet malt and mineral aroma. Flavour is pure pale malts with a touch of lemon and mineral. Not exciting, but very clean and well-executed. Body is refreshing and light, and thankfully not as aggressively carbonated as the style can be. Like I said, its not a world beater, but it is more flawless than most american pale lagers."
"Final Thoughts: All in all, this is a pretty solid Lager but really this is a patio or hot day of work beer. The fact this beer is organic is also a slight bonus, and it probably what gives this beer it's mild characteristics. A pleasant experience and a beer that you should try instead of picking up your favorite macro Lager."
"Pouring into a glass resulted in clear yellow ale with a very fizzy head that quickly evaporated. Smell was kinda sour, not particularly in a good way. The taste is fairly average. Some sweetness that quickly disappears and some slight bitter sourness as the end that also quickly disappears. Overall it is a fairly smooth and light, though mostly unremarkable ale."
"Smooth mouthfeel, a good drinking beer to get drunk with and you can be healthy at the same time!"
"If really committed, the next step for Mill Street would be to invest in a local farm and have them dedicate part of the land to hop production. Offer special local releases made from and made for the community. Alas, until then, as someone who tries to be conscientious about what I put in my body and who also values the importance of supporting local industry and artisans, I'll be happy to have their Organic Lager brewed just down the road."
"It's not bad, but I found it quite expensive. Just based on that alone, I wouldn't really go out of my way for it. But it is worth a try, at least once."
"A shoot-the-shit beer, for sure."
"I tried this beer on April 30, 2008 after purchasing an assorted 6 pack of Ontario Craft Brews from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent gold colour with a generous white head which settled down immediately. Tons of effervescence. The smell was very very sour. Almost a turn off. The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, lots of carbonation. The flavour was a ton of grain with a little bit of hops. Not a beer I would try again."
"Overall Mill St. has some awsome brews, but sadly this is not one of them. Its hard to believe that the brewery survived considering this was their first offering. I wish i could say that this is a step up from your typical macro but thats not the case. I will try the Tap version to make a final review of the beer. And why the mini bottles? Why do brewers do this?"
"D- This is a nice refreshing lager that I could easily have many of in a sitting and the 4.2% is a nice change too from the standard 5%. Very drinkable and thirst-quenching!"
"Time and a place for everything. It won't knock your socks off but it isn't terrible."
"Taste is pretty awful. Sweet, a little too much in my opinion, but it does at least lend flavour to a pretty weak beer. A little bit of grass and graininess. Unfortunately, the skunkiness transmits to the beer as well. This is way past it's prime. It's too bad. Thin mouthfeel, carbonation is about right. Medium-Dry finish. If this was fresh it might not be brutal, but as it is it's nearly a drain pour. Too bad Mill Street."
"Very pale yellow, see through, one finger white head with steady carbonation. Smells of wet grass, an aired out spring basement. Taste is light, grain, wheat, pomegranite. I find not a lot of hops; a very light, thin mouthfeel but a smooth texture just the same. The finish is semi-bitter, dry, crisp, clean. The overly-small 222 ml. bottle is very annoying. Well worth a try, straightforward and easy drinking lager."
"Final Statement: An organic, slightly crafted version of Corona I suppose. Suitable for hot days such as it was today. Nothing to seek out, but probably better on tap."
"What can I say, this would make a decent high end refreshing lawnmower beer, or something light to throw back on a deck or patio on a hot day, even to quench while barbecuing if you don't want to spoil your palate and appetite filling up on beer before dinner. Probably one of the smoothest organic lagers I've ever sampled, that's for sure. Definitely a great stepping stone lager to ween people off of macros, especially the ""lite"" beer crowd."
"D: HIGHLY drinkable."
"Another drinkable beer for the summer. I will settle for their coffee porter instead."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, not much of a kick, it’s a pretty straight-forward lighter beer and isn’t too bad for an organic all-malt lager, but if I’m going to go with something lighter, there are several other beers that I would choose first."
"Poured from a clear 222 mL bottle a pale straw colour with a one-finger white head sitting on top of an effervescent body. The head had good staying power and left sticky lace on my glass. The smell was bready malt with a hint of sweetness, grass and grain husks. Overall, the taste was unremarkable  malty up front with a only a faint bitter bite from hops and a bit of a rough grainy finish that gave it some character. The small bottles and low ABV make it a nice alternative to a gawdawful light macro, but there are so many other beers I'd rather have."
"Was given a bottle of this my a friend (who i'm sure has a BA account, but i dont know her screenname). She is my Mill St. supplier and this one was new to me. Tiny little bottle made me feel like a giant. Poured like watery straw juice. Smelled like corn drippings and old beer. Tastes like the High Life, Canada style. Thin, corny, vaguely sour. Thin and watery. Not a winner, Mill St....maybe that's why it's in such a small bottle: no one wants to drink a full 12oz. good karma for being organic, i suppose, but who knows what that even means anymore. Stick with the coffee porter (i just had another and it's quite a delicious treat)."
"Light gold in colour with strong carbonation. Aromas are of light bread and some surprisingly sweet honey and nuts... perhaps a bit of a spicy hop note hiding in there too. Malt forward flavor with more of the sweetish malt character.Thankfully, it dries out fairly quickly with some nice prickly bitterness and a bit more of those spicy hops. If they could thin out the malt character a bit, this would be much better. As it stands, its average at best."
"A fair offering, but I prefered the Organic Pils. Pours out to a medium golden color with a smaller head of white foam. Medium carbonation. Aromas of malt and grass mix with soured hops. Taste is medium light bodied, and a dry malt flavor dominates, with hints of grassy hay and grain. Not bad, but nothing special. Mouthfeel was nominal and on par for the style. Drinkability borders on average. A fairly unmemorable brew. I've had better from Mill St."
"Pours a clear golden, small off white head that goes really fast, no lacing. Smell is sweet, some honey, grains, citrus, skunk. Taste is sweet and honeyish up front, citrus in middle, but almost no flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Good thing this comes in a small bottle because I would not want to drink a full 12 oz."
"Bottle courtesy of Lubière (215ml bottle): Poured a golden color lager with a medium bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of semi-sweet malt with very subtle hops. Taste is refreshing with some hops presence and a good malt presence. Im not a big fan of the clear bottle but not a trace of skunkyness in this bottle. Im must say that this is not something that I would be particularly interested in trying again but I had much worse beer in my life."
"The beer is almost spritzy with pretty lively carbonation (though you wouldn't know to look at it). Pleasantly crisp, with good hops and a noticeable graininess. Fairly light in body, but still suibstantial enough to come across as a decent beer. Good for cleansing the palate."
"Oh -- and the guy working at the brewery bar told me that the Original Organic Lager is actually their Pilsner with a different label on it. Don't know if this is true or not, but kinda weird if so..."
"This is a highly drinkable and surprisingly flavorful light beer. Its more like Creemore Springs than Blue Light. Decent. The 200 mL bottles are cute bit a bit too small for a 4 percent beer."
"Good attack to announce its presence, grain in finish. Mouthfeel good, due to lasting non-watery finish of grain malt and touch of hop. Mouthfeel also a touch rounder than average light colored lager. Reaches right into the sinuses for a full-head experience. Just doesn't have a whole lot of character... I guess maybe that's due to the style, but the malt is just so ""one note"" that it's not enough to recommend it for anyone looking for a sensory experiece instead of a beer drinking experience."
"This beer is designed for day hikes: a modest container, an ability to maintain good flavor--improve even--as it warms, refreshing and intricate. Pack a dozen in the rucksack and crack 'em for contemplation at the top of Sugarloaf."
"An Ok beer. Pale with above-average carbonation. More promotion of organic term and the 195 ml. size than quality beer. Hint of honey and lemon mid-sip but like a light taste beer. Low carb too? Aroma is a negative - could be apple cider. Thin mouthfeel. Could get a lady to try a beer."
"As pale as yellow can be without being off-white. Bright, lightning white foam. Nondescript yet snappy, crisp grainy aroma -- Grape Nuts or some other crunchy unsugared cereal -- with mildly fruity aroma hops. Dried apricots perhaps? Sort of a trail mix. Very crisp, very balanced, very easy. Refreshing, really. The single best beer in this style to act as a post-lawnmowing beer."
"The retro-leaning logo, sleek bottle and mass-appeal of this beer suggest that it is everything that Steam Whistle tries to be (except for organic, I guess). Only downside is the small bottle which requires you to plow through two bottles to get your usual one."
"In the mouth it's steely and dry with shy fizzics. It doesn't need a lot of gas to structure the malt though, as this beer is almost completely attenuated. Breezy curls of hay, lemon peel and bitter rocks twist on the lengthy finish. This is an impeccably balanced light beer. Outrageously refreshing."
"Drinkablilty: I would probably buy this beer again. While i didn't fall in love with it, it was different enough to make me crave another sample."
