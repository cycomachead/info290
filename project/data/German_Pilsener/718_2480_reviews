"Head disappeared immediately, leaving a watery, thin color; the smell is of onions & feet; and the taste is worse than anything I would ever have in a football parking lot. Really terrible. I will never have this beer again. A rare (for me) actual drain-pour."

"Bavik could be described as ""plain"" lager, but with an added spicy kick. The sweetness found in this lager is solid, not cloying, with the hops to balance. Helping Bavik is its light body and crisp and lively carbonation bubbles. It's a decent lager overall, and a possible  simple alternative in the land of Duvel, Cantillon, and Chimay."

"I tried Bavik on tap at Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, PA, poured into a Bavik glass.  It has a light golden hay color with lots of carbonation and a standard white head.  Smell was minimal, basically that of an adjunct lager.  The taste was adequate.  I would sum it up as a downscale Stella Artois.  Mouthfeel was light and extremely carbonated.  Overall, this is an average, fairly unimaginative, beer."

"Such a great, unassuming light beer. If you want a light, refreshing beer, with a minimal taste this is the beautiful Pilsener for your taste buds to enjoy. Reminds me of Whittkerke!"

"Easy drinker and easy to pair with salads, chicken, and mild cheeses"

"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of pale malt, hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a clean finish with no lingering flavors. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good pilsner. Well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A bit bland on character, but not watery. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."

"Medium bodied with restrained effervescence. A decent, fading, aftertaste. This isn't a BMC brew, the hops are not overpowering, it has some flavor and some balance. There really isn't anything to recommend this but it's no drain pour either. To quote a friend, ""it doesn't suck"". But that is the best thing I can say about it."

"Pours a pale straw color and a little hazy; kind of unusual for a pilsner. Nice lacework as the very delicate foam falls. This beer has a delicate aroma of grain with a hint a grassiness. A very light, delicate pilsner, with a bit of spritziness to it. (This could be the result of my careful pour.) The flavor is grainy with hint of minerals. The finish is fairly bitter and dry. Almost makes me think of light version of Duvel. What attracts me the most with this beer is its gentle graininess in the flavor and dryness. Nothing too exciting here, just a well made, dry pilsner."

"Overall a typical euro quaffed. Nothing offensive here."
""
""
"Sub-par. Can't give Bavik Pils many good marks, if any, actually. Crossed-up between approaches, it seems. This pilsner almost has the yeast structure of a wit or a lighter Belgian Golden Ale. Not my cup of tea, and doubtfully yours."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and a grassy aroma. Taste is much the same with a grain-like flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O- Just not a great style of beer in my opinion."
""
"O: Easy to drink with a fairly low ABV and lighter flavors/aromas - refreshing and sessionable. Pairs well with many foods."

"Overall this is you average premium Euro lager. Easy to drink and quenches your thirst, but at 8.99 for six pack of 11.2 oz. of beer is very disappointing. There is nothing wrong with this lager. It is just there are better or equal lagers on the market."

"It is crisp and clean but too thin to be interesting. I really hope I only bought one of these because I don't ever really want another. I would just as soon drink a Pabst, and I would rather have a Rolling Rock. As with other styles, even with a bad style, I prefer American versions."
""
"O: Not exactly a groundbreaking beer, but pretty well done nonetheless."
"This was a pretty good beer, relatively light and very easy to drink."
"Overall this is a pretty average pilsner. Nothing special but a great thirst quencher."
""
""
"overall this is a decent little run. found on an around the world challenge and given a good once over by yours truly."
""
"Overall - 4/5 - As I said, not a huge fan of pilsener, but this one would serve as a good session beer that I wouldn't mind drinking a few of. Makes me think there is hope for pilseners after all!"

"T:"
"The malt elegance of German Lagers here is met with the dry-fruity, spicy bite of Belgian Pale Ales for a truely unique and thirst quenching session. A job well done by Bavik!"
" If you love the style, it's a must try."
"Prosit!"
"Presentation: Packaged in an 11.2 ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Pretty crisp up front with plenty of bubbles and mild hop flavors. Middle is grainy and a little sweet with the bready yeast kicking in. Finishes dry-ish with a decent bitterness. This is not totally unlike Stella, shares some of the same hop characteristics and the yeast is more notable in both than the Czech/German pilseners. It is pretty tasty and pretty affordable for a 12-pack. Id be just as happy with a Bavik as a Warsteiner or Bitburger."
"O: Started off well with a nice appearance and nose, but the flavor fell short."
"Overall I found this in my mixed sixer place and I was pleasantly surprised. Wouldn't be my go to beer since it was kind of old and carbonation was low but it was a decent beer. Drinkable."
"O: For Belgian pilsner this is as good as it gets. One to seek out if you're a fan of the style."
"While I have to consider that this style--or any lighter lager--will take a beating as an import, this is a good effort ... albeit nothing more than what was to be expected"
"pours a light straw color with very slight haze large white foamy head and a light wispy sticky lace. smell from the bottle was not bad but in the glass smelt like wet rags. very light tasting slightly sweet no real hop character light body. this ones a pass."
"Hay colored with a bit of haze. Dense white head and plenty of lace. Excellent head retention. Plentiful small carbonation bubbles are present. Grassy aroma. Surprisingly soft given the amount of carbonation. Healthy bitterness up front and through the middle, fading a bit in the end. Some residual sweetness after the finish. Medium body."
"Drink- Wasn't all bad. Still a bit different to have a Belgian beer in the shape of a German Pilsner."
"Some hints of fruit and minerals in the aroma. The flavor references day-old French bread with a touch of bitter orange wedded to a pleasant hop profile. Overall a welcome greeting to the mouth, and a suitable partner for some empanadas or pot stickers. Not something to impress the guests with though."
"Drinkability: A pretty standard lager. I was honestly hoping for more from a ""pilsener"" from Belgium but honestly there is nothing to set this beer apart from Stella and its ilk. You can find much better for much cheaper."
"D - Slightly disappointing."
"Pours a hazy light yellow color with a frothy one to one and a half finger head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of citrus and sweet malts. The taste has a nice sweet malt backbone with hints of breadiness and a slight hop bite to it as well. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated. Overall it is a very solid beer, it is an easy drink with a nice flavor to keep you wanting more."
"Drinkability: a nice, smooth, non-challenging but still a bit flavorful, Bavik Pils hits the spot for me."
"D - This is an okay German pils, but I've had better."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink, refreshing and rather sessionable. It's a perfect beer to begin the night with because it opens up your palate."
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle no. 39912. Sampled on June 3, 2010. It pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with a short burst of fizzy off-white head. The aroma is full of grains with thin hops and a slight skunkiness. The mouthfeel is about medium. The taste is also more grainy than anything else with a bit of creaminess and a faint hint of hops at the end. It leaves an aftertaste."
"This beer is hard to compare to anything else. I'd say the closest I could compare it to is Carlsberg maybe, but it has a very different feel. I like drinking this beer, but I am probably not going to get it in the future because it's hard to find and it's not cheap. There are better German Lagers out there for less money. Also I'd be more inclined to buy it if it came in a 12 oz bottle, instead of these stupid 11.2 0z ones."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but not something to call mom about. It delivers refreshment without wow."
"Six-pack x 11.2 fl. Oz. picked up at Bottle King. Pours light and clean gold with 2 finger pure white head that dissipates quickly. Simple and crisp fruity refreshing. Sweet with grass hops. High level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice pilsner."
"Pours a very pale golden color with thick white head that retains well and remains nice and creamy. Nose is faint with some cereal grain and light herbal hops. Palate is also light with malt flavors dominating, a touch of herbal hops, and a relatively watery light finish. Easy drinking, but also not inspiring in the least."
"From the CAN: ""Bier - Biere - Beer - Cerveza - Birra - Cerveja - Pivo"""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, some fruits.Taste is mild, slightly sweet and grainy, finishing a tad sour. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a mediocre brew."
"D: All in all, this was ok. I wouldn't turn one down if offered one, and would take this over Stella anyday."
"D- easy enough to have a couple of, but not really something id like to drink all night. a nice alternative to the beers normally found at my parents house."
"Value: I paid $1.29 for a single can. Shoulda been like 99 cents."
"Tough to rate this one. Do I give it a good grade for its unique take on a pils, or do I knock it for being untrue to the pils style? All I know is I enjoyed it. Hefe's aren't my favorite thing, and pilsner can sometimes be boring or have an unpleasant aftertaste. In my eyes, this is a nice marriage of the two styles, taking the best of both worlds. But beware, this is not your classic pils and some people won't like that."
"D: The low ABV and general lightness make this an easy drinker. Not the most complex Pils out there, but pretty decent."
"Mouthfeel was multi-textured - there was a light burn and it was thinner than expected. However, it finished smooth. $7.49 for a 6-pack at the local grocery."
"D: Some time ago, this one guy was giving out Bavik samples. He told me that Stella Artois is what they drink in America and Bavik is what they drink in Belgium. Be that as it may, there's a ton of better pilsners out there. Let the Belgians stick to what Belgians do best."
"Fresh 11.2oz bottle. Pours hazy straw yellow with a fizzy white cap that leaves nice lacing behind. Sweet corn smell with some note reminiscent of wet hay. Tastes very slightly better, though not markedly so. Some grainy pils malt coming into play, but still a general adjunct fell. Quite sweet, and not pleasantly so. Light feel, though not really watery. Not a great take on a pilsener; really too sweet. In all honesty Jupiler (or any number of other euro lagers) would be a better alternative."
"Marvin's/$6 (!!)/12 oz"
"The beer is very light, refreshing, quite bland, inconsequential, and drinkable. Nothing memorable here other than some tart graininess, some peppery like bite towards the finish, maybe a touch of dry florals in the body of the beer. There is definitely a snappy pepperishness towards the finish. The aftertaste is pretty non existent and the beer is very light on the tongue."
"Notes: A good session beer with overall good balance."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not one of the better beers that I've had in the style but I've certainly had a lot worse."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is nice and easy, nothing offensive. Very wet on the tonuge and finishes smoothly. A very drinkable beer, will have again. Great session beer also."
"Pale straw color, even lighter than most pilseners. Modest white head, no lacing. Aroma is grainy with accents of grass and maybe some esters. Flavor is softer and sweeter than your average pils, with honeyed malt and a touch of stone fruit. Hops are rather subdued. Carbonation is high, body is medium-thin. Drinkable and flavorful but not crisp or hoppy enough."
"On-tap in Ghent. The aroma was a bit funky, like farmhouse character, at first, but that gave way to very clean malts (too clean, I could hardly taste them) followed by very very earthy hops with orange rind, carraway seed, and a musty earthiness. Worth a try when better options aren't available."
"D - Easily drinkable and not unpleasant, but there are some significant flaws that hurt my overall impression of the beer. The apple aroma is hard to ignore and obscures an otherwise nice pilsner character. This is hardly the worst pils out there, but it shouldn't be hard to find a better one."
"First aroma has fruity esters, very orange, along with a good malt backbone. Quaff is getting back to pilsner malt and taste, but still a long way off. But I guess this is just the Belgium interpretation of pilsner, unfortunately it doesn't work well with me. Glad this was a one 11.2oz bottle for sample, wouldn't want a sixer of these."
"Pours a clear golden color. Good 2/3 inch head with decent retention and good lacing. Smells of mostly lager and some malt. Fits the style. Smooth with low carbonation, slightly thick mouth feel. Good malt taste upfront with a good lager background. Also a very slight hop taste in there as well. Slightly watery for my taste; could have been stronger. Overall, not a bad example of a german pilsner, I'm glad I tried it."
"Drinkability: If I had to choose a pilsner, and I could choose anything, I would probably pick this one."
"Been on a pilsner kick lately. Something about that crisp taste that fills a void after you've been hitting the big beers for a while. Picked these up in a six pack of cans, which I can see coming in very handy at the lake next summer. Kudos to craft breweries who are busting out the cans. A hazy golden pour finishes with a two-finger quickly fading off-white head. There's a streaky lacing left behind. You get a little skunk on the nose at first, but no the off-putting kind, which you get with some brews. Smells a little sweet, malty and medicinal as well. Tastes sweet and malty, and not as crisp as expected. It could have been a bit bigger on the hops at the end which usually balances things off. Really good pilsner's have to pull that off well in my book. It's highly carbonated according to the style, and pretty drinkable overall, although a bit lacking in the taste and mouth-feel departments, and a bit softer around the edges than I like in a pilsner."
"This is about average in drinkability. I wish it were a bit stronger in the taste area. I had one bottle and while there was nothing offensive about it, one bottle is really all I'd care to have. There simply are many beers of this type out there which are far more enjoyable."
"Golden brew with thin white head. Head dies down too quickly. A bit too still as well. The scent of sweat pale malt and noble musty hops. The taste follows similar lines. The flavors are crisp, clean and overall subtle. Only knock is that it is not quite rich or big enough to make me do back flips. However, this is the type of flavor, smoothness the American macros could only hop for."
"Poured a pale hazy yellow color with a thin head. Smelled of spices and some citrus hops. Tasted the same, a nice conservative blend of citrus wheat with some spiced hops. A slight zing to the tongue on some drinks. Went down decently. Just didn't desire another."
"Mainly inoffensive (outside of slight metallic touch), soft and easy enough for a ""throw it back"" thirst-quencher. But, that's about all it is, but not bad for that."
"Drinkability is ok here. I'm not too impressed but it's inoffensive and goes down well. I can say that I've had better examples though."
"I got this brew from By the Bottle in Vancouver, WA in standard 12 oz bottle. I'm a Pilsener and a Belgian fan so this was a must try. Poored like a standard pils and about right for the style but the individual bubbles were bigger and dissipated quicker. Nose was almost a bit earthy and reminded me of tomatoes for some reason. Saaz hops or something similar were faintly apparent. Taste is good and within the style, but a bit more saaz hopiness would add to the brew. Mouthfeel is medium but the carbonation is a bit light. Overall this is decent brew and should be tried by my fellow pils and Belgian fans."
"D - Not sure if I would purchase again, but interesting none the less."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in body with a dry finish. Carbonation is about where it should be. This is an easy drinking beer, but I don't see anything that would really draw me back to it. Nothing outstanding, nothing damning. It is a good beer, quite unique with that little Belgian twinge coming from the yeast. Give it a try."
"Really good stuff..."
"12 ounce can. Pale golden color. Thin white foam that lasts well. Nose shows some light malts, a touch of vinous character and some grassy hops. Really clean nose. Flavor has some bready malty character and some tangy, slightly citrus hops. Well balanced, clean lager."
"Note: Hard to find anything positive to say about this one."
"D-simple but very enjoyable,I could enjoy this easy drinker again and again.Not one to seek out but never the less a good Pils"
"Certainly a step or two above the macro euro lagers."
"Easy to drink due to its ABV and very smooth and light body, the ease with which you can throw this brew down might be the best part about it."
"Very average beer.. average in appearance, smell, taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability. Nothing special to report, just that it went down easy and I would recommend having it served extra cold. The only interesting thing that I could say about it was that it tasted very honey-like.. I'm not sure why, but the beer had a definite honey flavor to it."
"Nice euro lager."
"its not bad and I'm okay with paying around 6 for a 6 pack."
"I will finish this six pack (of course), but I probably won't get this again -- especially at $9 a sixer."
"11.2oz brown bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Pours a translucent light straw color with a good inch of white head that dissipates leaving a fair bit of lacing. Smells fruity with caramel malt, yeast, and hints of DMS. Tastes malty sweet with almost a citric or grape-like component, just the slightest hint of cooked vegetable with a fairly clean finish. Light mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation. Not as hoppy as I've come to expect from the style, but otherwise a decent easy-drinking pils that beats the heck out of most Euro-lagers IMO."
"Bavik pours piss yellow with some carbonation. The nose is very grainy and smells of wheat and some malt. the taste is simple and grainy. wheatfunk and some weak spice. Mouthfeel is thin and watery as expected and the drinkability would be that of water, but is too funky. Not a terrible beer, but nothing I would drink again when I can just grab an urquell."
"Ick, bordering on drain pour."
"Drinkability - Drinkable, but don't buy a sixer."
"Drinkability: Great session brew. The flavor in this beer is superior to Stella Artois. Too bad it is not as widely available."
"Overall, I have had this beer on tap once before, and kind of liked the on tap version a little better, but that was a long time ago. This happens to be my favorite tapwerks (local pub) beer on tap. Overall the bottle seemed to be good to the taste, also had the white beer as well."
"Note: I had a beer on a Royal Carribean cruise (called Royale) that is suspected to be a renamed version of Palm from Belgium, and this brew is very similar to that."
"Bavik Pils pours a golden yellow with a large white head that laces nicely from an 11.2 ounce can. The aroma isn't great, there isn't anything too off putting, but it almost smells like a macro. It clearly isn't though, but there is a very sweet malt presence and a not very appealing mild hop smell. The more I smell it, the more I just pick up the sweet malt. I like the malt in the flavor, it's strong enough to give this beer a good flavor, in the pils style, but the hops are all wrong for a pils, they are kind of weak and not especially flavorful, kind of leaving an odd bitterness toward the finish. That being said, it is very light, doesn't actually taste bad, and actually I'm coming to kind of like it. I think the cans may be a blessing for this beer, it could probably skunk easily which would really hurt it. This would make a decent session beer. Better than I expected."
"This beer pours a healthy white head that slowly fades to an island of foam. A respectable lace clings and stays. Macro yellow in color with a greenish haze. The smell is pretty clean except for a faint belgian mustiness, which i really liked. Taste is more of the same fairly clean, crisp and really easy to quaff. All in all bavik is a great beer, even if it isn't quite true to style."
"Poured into a pilsner a light spritzy yellow with a large blooming white head that settled very very slowly leaving globs of lace behind.Light residual sweetness a bit of metallic and firm toasted malt in the nose nothing earth shattering or out of the ordinary but it could be worse.Thin near watery mouthfeel the beer glides down almost like water wich isnt the worse thing in the world but obviously I think most would want more body,slightly sweet and toasty with a bit of a herb smack in the finish,eh its not horrible its better than some other European giants but still it lacks alot."
"I wasn't expecting much from this beer, but to be honest, it's not a bad Euro lager. The golden/yellow appearance and grainy malt smell won't change your mind too much. And while the flavor is generic enough not to really stand out, it is completely inoffensive to the point where it's enjoyable. A slightly sweet, malty taste emerges, with just the slightest sense of bitterness. Personally I like this better than Stella, and it is decent for a Euro lager."
"Overall, this is a nice pilsner. It doesn't really stand out too much, but it is well done."
"Poured strait into the glass a very water fizzy looking golden color. The upside is that the head retains fairly well and leaves some nice lacing. The smell is of wheat, fairly bland, smells similar to typical mass proudced american beers. The taste is not objectionable but doesnt seem to be distinct at all. Not what I was expecting, very fizzy and thin. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and thin. Overall this beer is very drinkable which is its upside. I wouldn't recommend trying it unless you get it for free. I certainly wont be purchasing it again."
"Overall, nothing too special here. Decent for a backyard cook-out on a hot day but I know I can come up with better examples of the style to whet my whistle."
"Pours a light gold, a bit yellow, with constant upward bubbles and a light dusting of head. Doughy and a tad minty on the nose, with a little bit of urine. On the palate, a bit tight and minty first off, with some rough papery notes in the middle that maintain a Saaz tang until the end. Mouthfeel is good for the style -- smoothness overlaid with some jagged hop oils. Overall, this is alright, and there's nothing really out of whack here, but things don't quite gel, either."
"Grabbed a single bottle @ Marty's in Newton, MA. Poured a pale yellow hue with a minimal white head. Not much in the aroma department; even though it's supposed to be a lager I still got a slight spice and fruit smell if you really stick your nose in it. I paired this beer with a pastrami on rye sandwich that really hit the spot. This beer is not really one of my favorites but it is definetley above average for the style. Good session beer."
"This Belgian pilsner is a better one than others. It does not have the fame of others, but it is always looked over. A great color, a decent nose, and standard pilsner tastes, a bit sweeter even. Not one of my favorite styles but it is still better than some."
"Drinkability: It's far from an amazing pilsner, but it's more than serviceable at its Trader Joe's price."
"There are some beers in my fridge that I'm only going to drink when I absolutely HAVE to. This was kind of one of them but I think I chose well. It turned out ok."
"D - Alright. It is a pilsener. I am not really a pilsener fan, but it is better than most of them for sure."
"A creamy drinkable and tasty lager, with some yeast in it. A find at Eagle Provisions in NYC. Yellow with some cloudiness in it, some white head and drops of lace. Smooth drinking. Offset some spicey food. Smartly malted, a versatile beer.I think this beer is underated"
"Easy to drink..has a smooth, clean taste and little residual aftertaste."
"Bavik Pils is firmly in line with the older, more traditional (often -but not always- unfiltered) Lagers and Pilseners of Central and Eastern Europe, many of which have recently been imported in some numbers for the first time in years. So if you've got a sense of adventure and don't mind spending two bits more than your average sixer of Beck's or Saint Pauli Girl, this is well-worth checking out!"
"The mouth is light and clean, and after a burst of bitter hops, actually gets creamy on the end. This is a very drinkable brew, even if it doesn't really posess a wealth of personality."
"Not a great pilsner but a good one and a variation on the style that is unique."
"A light golden color with a quater inch head that forms, with visible carbonation. The surprising scent of floral hops hits my nose, folowed by some roasted barley, but a pleasant aroma. The taste, what happened to the hops, a very malty, mild flavor. There was no sign of the hops in the taste. Watery, a very thin mouthfeel, with a slight tingle from the carbonation. Overall, the smell was nice but it seemed to slack off after that surprise."
"Great Pilsner."
" Mellow, refreshing taste with nice mouthfeel but slightly watery body. Finish is decently dry. Pretty decent attempt at the style."
"The history of Brouwerij Bavik and of this particular beer is fascinating. Too bad Bavik Pils is anything but. It's an decent little lager, but there are scores of German, Czech and Belgian pilseners that have it beat any day of the week. It isn't really worth your time unless you're a 'pils popper'. Probably not even then."
"I'm afraid I couldn't see the beer through the can, and didn't have any opportunity for pouring it into a glass as I was drinking it in an alley adjecent to an auto repair shop. I had a notably crisp, clean and lightly grassy flavor - rare for most Belgian pils I've had. I was having me a good old time with a friend, and this beer was the perfect accompaniment for the first warm spring day we spent drinking outdoors. It actually had some body to it as well. It has since gone up in price by two dollars per six pack/ cans at my local shop. I think I'll switch to Dale's Pale Ale in the can for a dollar less."
"drinkability: certainly a nice summer quaffer, but at $7 for a sixer of cans, there's better value out there."
"Fairly drinkable. Worth a try if you like pils."
"I could also see this beer working well on a hot day. It is more flavorful than BMC and its ilk. Plus I can buy it in cans fairly cheap. I have no qualms drinking this! I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA. I think Ill have to get more."
"A well made German Pils. Poured out to a hazed light yellow color with a medium head of foam that dissipated rather fast. A good amount of lace was present, and streams of champagne-like bubbles surge toward the surface well after the initial pour. Aromas of light malt and hops, with some grain and sweet corn notes. Very fresh. Taste is light bodied and very quaffable; malt, corn, dry hops, subtle notes of hay and sweetness. Mouthfeel was slightly bubbly, but otherwise forgetable. Good drinkability. Very refreshing. Worth trying."
"Poured a blondish bright yellow with a medium to thick white head. Good lacing throughout. Smells strong of hops but I detected an olive-like scent. Taste was surprising as it was very fruity and for a light beer definately worth a try. The mouthfeel was subpar but overall a beer one could enjoy on a night of heavy drinking for it's lightness and flavor."
"Hey, this isn't bad. Very pale and light bodied. Nice grassy hop aroma, very consistent with Euro pils. Medium-low bitterness. Medium-high carbonation with big white head and great lacing. Probably one of the best beers I have had in a can. Better than Heineken cans, and OBVIUOSLY better than Bud, Miller, etc."
"Belch: Non existent it seems"
"(11.2 oz.)"
"All in all, not bad. However, there are a host of solid pilsners that I would reach for before I came to this one."
"selection of the beer-of-the-month club. Poured a pale yellow color with a nice white puffy head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is slightly sweet with some piney hops detected. Taste is nice and crisp but nothing outstanding. High carbonation gives a mouth fullness that leads helps to make it refreshing. An easy drinker, Best used as an expensive spacer."
"Aroma has a nice spicy-woody aspect to it, along with a slightly grainy note. Not very strong-smelling but probably appropriate for style. The flavor is clean, nicely bitter at the end, and dry, with a mild hop and malt flavor that is pleasant although a little underwhelming. The balance is good in this beer, its refreshing but beefy. Not my first choice but for the style I'd say its pretty good."
"Overall I'm very dis-satisfied with this beer."
"Very soft and clean on the palate. Grainy sweet mouthfeel with a chalky quality. Sweetness, slight hop profile and grains provide for a clean drinking pilsner."
"Draught: This beer poured a very light golden color. It was crystal clear. There was a large white head, with a bit of lacing. The aroma wasnt too bad. It was mainly floral with a light maltiness to it. The taste was a bit light, but fairly good. There was almost no hop bite to it at all. Easy drinking, but fairly non-descript."
"Notes: Traditionally, Friends and I start most evenings out sucking down a couple bavik's. A great warm up beer that has character and doesnt get boring."
"Taste is slightly sweeter and slightly maltier than an american lager. Cleaner yet more interesting too, and a nice smooth finish that requires further investigation. Very drinkable."
"With all that said I don't mind this beer at all...sure it's not a trademark pilsner but it is tasty and I like a sweeter flavor to a pilsner anyhow...plus it tastes good out of a can...easy drinking...decent flavor....forget the fact it's from Belgium...there are many better from that country but for what this is it isn't bad at all...solid offering...I'd buy some of these for the golf course..let's call it a Belgium Lager though"
"Hazy sun yellow. Chunks of yeast in suspension. Thin ivory white head. Nice aroma of soft, bready malts and flowery hops. Medium-full body. A little light on the carbonation for a pilsner. Bready malts form the base of the flavor with nice Saaz-like hop tones. Flowery hops add a nice touch. Pretty decent pilsner, especially coming from a can."
"Drinkability: OK for a quaffer; purchased by mistake and it met my low expectations"
"Overall: I have had this before many, many times in Belgium, and I honestly think its one of the better for the masses Pils out there. Its clean, crisp and actually has some Pils-like flavor, unlike the Alken-Maes and Jupiler home-grown contenders, if only Bavik to get this more widely distributed. Nothing outstanding but certainly not one of the worst Belgium Pils on the market. I think I will try the Cans when I see them back in the USA."
"Picked up at Kahn's in Indy on a whim. The can actually reminded me a little of Brahma, especially once i saw ""cerveja"" on it. Anyways, an agressive pour leads to a 2 finger white head with large soapy bubbles atop a straw yellow body with some particles in suspension. Nose is sweet and malty much like a typical euro lager. Taste finishes a tad metallic, not generally pleasant. I'll probably pass on this one next time."
"Not bad, overall, but nothing special. It's probably considerably better becaus eof it's brown bottle packaging. I just hope there isn't anyone out there who thinks this is representative of Belgian beer."
"This beer represents the notion to not judge a book by its cover. Nothing impressed me at first. The label looked cheap, appearance was nothing impressive - very pale with little carbonation, no aroma to speak of. All this changed from the first sip to the last. Fantastic light taste that was above and beyond any domestic light beers or even Pilsner Urquell. Went down great. Bought this in a mix and match single and will definitely try it again. Paid $1.59 for the bottle."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden pilsener color with a fluffy white head. Yeasty, grassy, husky and bready nose, rather clean smelling. Tastes rather fruity in the malt and the bouquet of the hops ties together pretty nicely. Starts rather malty sweet, then there's a watery portion mid-palate and a faint tartness and dryness in the finish. Very atypical for a Euro pils, but it seems right for a Belgian pils. Possesses unique characteristics the the Interbrew adulterated version is missing."
"A Belgian lager? I havent seen many of these before so I decided to give it a try. The beer appeared very lagerish in color with a foamy white head that stayed the whole time I drank it. Lots of bubbles racing to the top but not much lacing. This beer was really sweet for a lager/German pils. The upfront sweetness was almost too much for me but it had a really smooth mouthfeel to it. The base of this beer was grainy and sweet as well. The hops came in a provided a profound spicy flavor to this beer. It seems like there were more spices (clove, coriander?) added to this beer at the end of the fermentation b/c it was almost overly spicy in the finish. This was a decent beer that complemented my cherry bbq chicken well but I couldnt drink this one as a session."
"low."
"Drinkability  I refrained from dumping this with a shaking hand. Its right on the edge."
"Slightly hazy pale yellow, strange for a Lager or more specifically, a Pilsner. Head is very light and rises to over 1/2 an inch, very fluffy in texture. Decent overall lacing on the glass. Weird yeasty aroma, musty with some nutmeg and grass components. Starts light and perfumey on the tongue, sweet and even a little estery. No real hop sense. Body thins markedly later, as does the taste, but strangely, there's little carbonation and a weird slick sensation that's almost like flat Ginger Ale. A very odd beer for style, almost resembles Wittekerke in some aspects,"
"Drinkability - not too complex, very easy to drink. One of the more enjoyable beers I've had from a can."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It boasts of mostly pale malts and lager yeast. It is dry and hopped sparingly. The taste is average as well. It is basically just a pale brew with no malt character that is slighty bitter and dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with above average carbonation. This beer drinks about average. There is nothing special about it. It's one and done for me."
"Drinkable, a solid brew but not outstanding."
"Pours with a two-fingered white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Medium carbonation. Light golden amber color. Light bodied - not your usual Belgian. Nose is malty. Start sweet and crisp; finishes on the sweet side but there are some soapy overtones."
"Anecdote: The other night I invited some folks over and treated them to a 750ml bottle of Kasteel, and they were duly blown away. Later, one of them saw a can of this in my fridge, and asked to try it. ""This is way better than that other one!"" he practically screamed. This is for him and his kind, all the world over, Lord Bless 'em!"
"Very average. Nothing distinctive and too close to water."
"Not a beer that will knock your socks off but a bit better than some of the other reviews would indicate. Maybe it's better out of the bottle. A solid european light lager."
"Had this at a ""good beer that comes in a can"" tasting after work. Pale pilsner color, white head, faint hops and citrus aroma. Tasted very clean, with an oily hop flavor, no skunk or funk as compared to Heineken and Pilsner Urquell. Drinkable middle-of-the-road beer. Pretty good I'd say. Maybe some others had a bad batch."
"I think this beer may get slammed a bit for being in a can and that's what I find especially appealing. A decent (not great) beer in a can. A beer I can take on our local beach, or condo pool (no glass allowed). It pours a straw/gold color and holds a substantial frothy white head and lots of clingy lace. The aroma leaves a little to be desired with a raw malty, hop and odd damp basement smell. A modest sweetish malt, almost oily body blends well with the spicy and slightly metallic hops. A faint citrus taste comes and goes. A light alcohol fuminess is noticeable throughout. Better than Heineken."
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for the sample!"
"I found this to be a rather odd beer. In some ways a sterotypical euro-lager - very sweet and bready with a hint of grassy flavors. Mouthfeel was extremely soft, as though they had been over-tinkering with the water ph. Sweetness and bread flavors went beyond the euro-lager norm, however, and clear Belgian influences were present - it bordered on a Belgian white ale, without the spices."
"Slightly hazy, yellowish gold with a firm, bright-white head that holds very well and leaves excellent lace. The aroma offers a full, grainy maltiness and an herbal hoppiness. The body is light-medium, and it has a very fine, restrained carbonation. Very smooth & creamy in the mouth. The flavor has, surprisingly, a light touch of Belgian ""mustiness"" which is not normally found in their pilseners. The malt is well balanced with bitterness & there's some lightly woody & herbal hop flavor. The hops are confusing - or is that interesting - to me. I can't identify any variety, or even a general characteristic, other than the ""dried leaves"" note it has - and maybe a little bit of light, dried pine. I wonder if they're using aged hops; and yet that doesn't seem the case either! Odd. The finish is semi-sweet / semi-dry with some nice bitterness but also a sticky maltiness, although there's also a gently lingering earthy & mineral quality that helps to dry it out. This one is a quagmire. It's not a very good example of a pilsener at all. And it doesn't have any stand out qualities. But it is interesting & memorable. If it was a touch drier it might be better - but then it would be like every other mediocre Belgian pilsener. I have to give it some credit for its uniqueness (although that's not reflected in the score). I certainly wouldn't buy a case of this, but I found it interesting enough to suggest trying one to see what it's like."
"Notes: A decent Euro lager at best, Stella Artois is a half notch better but I’d rather have a Bavik for the sake of smaller breweries. Though at $5.99 a six pack of 11.2 oz cans it is a bit pricey for what you get."
