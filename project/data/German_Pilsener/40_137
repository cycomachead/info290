Tastes of malts and noble hops, which balance the sweetness. It is just delicious and goes down smoothly. Light to medium body and light carbonation, which makes for an exceptional drinkability. You could down a liter in less than you say good morning. What a simple deliciousness, yet world class beer. Up there with Weihenstephaner as the best Pilsner i have had.","DiUr","Nov 07, 2014"

Sticky lace on the glass; a nice cream ring around the edges. Smelled like citrus, light spice, peppery, and some malted barley grains. At first it is a bit sweet on my palate, but it finishes dry, slightly bitter, and peppery. There is a little lemon zest in there as well. It finishes smooth and crisp; balanced and light, yet fulfilling. Overall, this is a great German pils. It is especially great for an end-of-summer brew. Sad to see the transition into fall.","Jsteez","Sep 05, 2014"

The aroma offers a mild blend of straightforward Pilsner malt and soft, smooth noble hops. It's subtly floral with a hint of lemongrass in its mainly grassy character. Although the bitterness is there from the beginning, it doesn't really make itself known until midway, and then it bows out, simply stepping aside to make up the background of the finish. It's quite nicely rounded and polished to the point of being remarkably drinkable. Absolutely worth trying, particularly if you can find it on tap.","NeroFiddled","Dec 27, 2013"

Let me try to explain why this beer rocks: it rocks because it has something other lesser beers typically lack. It has staying power. By that I mean it goes down extremely well on the first luscious gulp, but continues to go down just like that throughout the whole half-liter can. Very few beers manage to achieve that. And for me, it has one of the best combinations of taste and ""refrenshing-ness"" (if I can coin a term) that I have ever experienced in a pilsner. So, to summarize: go out and get this beer and see for yourself if it isn't really pleasing. I'm pretty confident you'll agree.","","Jan 29, 2012"

Few carbonation bubbles can be seen flowing up the whole time you're drinking this one. Smell is to the herbal-citrusy end on the hops, with biscuity-corny malts. Bitter lemon and maybe a little anise. Taste is like a lemongrass-infused butter with fresh-cracked pepper on wheat toast. A slight medicinal hop note on the finish, along with more of that sweet, sweet grain. Mouthfeel is picture-perfect; medium-bodied, buttery, and evaporating off your tongue. If you know anybody who swears by Beck's, Amstel, or Heineken, hand 'em one of these and wait for them to ask where they can get more.

Mouthfeel was silky with a big, soft hops flavor, like spearmint, on the tongue. Shazam, but this was fantastic! I got some maltiness, but hops were king here. Finish was literally breathtaking. If you have ever smoked a menthol cigarette, you will understand. This was clean, minty, slightly malty, but very dry. Wow! Finish lingered with a minty hoppiness. There was no question that this was hop-driven, but I wonder how well they would have held up in a bottle. This is one instance where I CAN encourage CANphobic drinkers to give a King a chance.

Taste has the requisite sweet barley opening, but the hoppy bitter follow-up is too subdued, even hard to find. There's some dryness in the finish, but malt is the predominant component.

Light golden colour with mild carbonation.Both malt and hops are present in this brew. Finishes off with a quick bitterness. Defines a German pilener very well. My favourite Pilsener, can always be found in the fridge or on the dinner table.","sid","Jul 15, 2003"
3.6,-4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This Konig Brauerei Pilsener was packaged in an American style brown longneck bottle. The pour showed a golden body that was mostly clear or pehaps just a bit hazy. The head, what there was of it, was white and it settled into a thin layer that left some pretty nice sticky lace. Lots of malt nose with a hint of fruity hops. Constant flows of carbonation bubbles help give this beer a crisp mouthfeel, though the feel is also a bit thin. Plenty of hop bitterness makes the malt seem less sweet than it probably is. A good strong Pilsener beer that is fairly true to the style.","AtLagerHeads","May 18, 2003"
3.88,2.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a modest sized white head that fades into a thin and sticky lace. Nose is sweet malts and grains with a bit of citrusy hops. Light in body and very crisp and refreshing. Taste is also sweet malts and grains with some bready biscuity notes followed by some bitter hops and a bit of lemon leaving a dry finish. A very nice pilsner that I will always gladly make room for in my fridge.","Morris729","Mar 18, 2003"

4.5,19.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice thick head. Very good nose too with the hops being super fresh and awakening. Pours quite golden, nice hops in the flavor. Excellent beer that has the hops and malt decently balanced. The mouthfeel is very smooth and ligh with a delicate texture. Very enjoyable beer.","AtrumAnimus","Feb 22, 2003"
4.57,21.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"A nice, solid pilsner. One of my favorite styles and this is def. one of my go-tos.","SaunaKing","Dec 26, 2002"
4.23,12.2,4.5,4,4,4,5,"This is my favorite pilsner! Has a distinctive, refreshing taste. Very fresh and extremely easy to drink (avoid the brown bottle version with the twist-off cap, however. It was stale and skunky. Stick with the original green bottles). In a style filled with so many taste-a-like beers, this one stands out.","JohnnyDuvel","Dec 17, 2002"
3.53,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice fairly thick fluffy head.  Straw body.  Clean and fresh aroma with a whiff of typical pilsener hops.  Flavor is light peppery hops.  Fairly dry although I thought I might have detected esters.","aracauna","Sep 28, 2002"

4.2,11.4,4,4,4,4,5,"Aroma: Clean maltiness with a bit of hoppy spiciness. Pale gold, the color of straw, with decent head retention.  This is the beer Budeweiser wishes it could be - the combination of typically round, sweet decoction mash flavor combined with a nice firm bitterness and hoppiness that is near-perfect in balance. The lingering bitter-hop-malt-spiciness flavors at the back of your tongue after a long sip just screm ""more!!""  One of the best, if not the best, Pilsners I've yet tried. Good in bottle (if it hasn't been skunked), but better on tap.","sponberg","May 09, 2002"
4.3,14.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Forget Becks or the similar ... a fine pils to be had any time of the year. A treat for either the veteran micro drinker or a macro drinker. Goes down well yet very tasty at the same time.","Jason","Apr 24, 2002"
