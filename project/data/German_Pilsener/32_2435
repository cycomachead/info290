2.29,-16.7,4.25,2,2.25,2,2.25,"Poured into pint glass from bottle. Aggressive pour shows two fingers eggshell froth, with fair retention and some spotty lacing. Clear and light straw in color. Light, yet very metallic aromas. Very little complexity. Tastes somewhat skunky, not really picking up much in terms of noble hops. Quite base. Mouthfeel is watery, with light carbonation and a metallic finish, much like sucking on a penny. I was quite disappointed with this beer. I thought it was from Germany--nope, St. Louis. This does not taste much at all like a standard pilsner. I'm willing to bet the version made in Germany tastes quite different, and I wish I could differentiate it on BA from the American brewery. The only one listed (that I can find) is German, and this is definitely not. So are reviewers in Germany rating a completely different beer? If anyone knows, please message me--I'm confused. Bought on sale for less than $1/bottle. Even for same price, will not buy again.","sporklift87","Tuesday at 10:11 PM"

The aroma is not much of really, just some grains. Not 'skunky' though like so many that come in a green bottle for some reason. The taste is pretty much the same just of some grain and hops. Not bitter but just plain for the most part. Overall, it is OK but nothing special but is smooth and refreshing. Bit watered-down though.","BeerWithMike","Jul 22, 2014"

2.73,-0.7,3,2.5,2.75,2.5,3,"Pours from the bottle like any common lager, with a sunny yellow color (with maybe a hint of green) and a white fizzy head. The aroma is a combination of musty hops, a little bit of lemon, and some light cracker-like breadiness. The flavor features sweet cereal grains, a bit of corn, and only a faint earthy hop character. There is also a little bit of a metallic flavor in the finish, which always tends to turn me off. There is some body, but the light, fizzy carbonation cuts right through it. Overall, this beer is fine and drinkable, but not appreciably different than most other common, mass-produced lagers.","devilben02","Dec 27, 2013"

4,45.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I love Beck's. Now, granted, I may not have a discerning taste, as I find little difference in the Original vs. Busch version of Beck's. In fact, I have been buying it with more frequency since it's been brewed abroad, but I cannot exactly explain why that is. Point is, I love Beck's, I've always loved Beck's, its not my very favorite beers but when its available at a bar thats all I'll drink for the whole night, and I dont know many other beers i can say that about as I tend to switch it up throughout the night if I'm not pinching pennies. Skunky, but in a good way, crisp, not filling at all. Hell not even as expensive as a comparable beer. I'll take this over Heineken any day of the week and twice on Sundays. This beer serves me well in any setting, out to eat, with an all day BBQ, or just hanging out watching the game. Winter, summer, spring, or fall, Beck's is a beer that I can enjoy. My tastes tend to fluctuate every 5-6 months, but Beck's always gets regular rotation in my fridge. More discerning tastebuds may notice a dip in quality since its buyout, but I can't and I still enjoy the beer for what it is: a very enjoyable, reasonably priced german pilsner.","bullwinkle88","Sep 24, 2012"

Overall I would not get this beer again based on the skunked smell and it is really sub par in comparison to other pilsners of same style.","Slatetank","Aug 07, 2012"

The smells is of skunky adjunct and slight rice grain. The taste is fairly bitter. More skunk than anything, following the nose. Along with some slightly cooked veggies and sweet grains. The mouthfeel adds some more sweet grain to the mix, But absolutely nothing else. Overall, It is a party beer only. In the case that you do not mind flavor at all. Other than that, avoid. Now I've never had the "" German "" version of Beck's, Nor will I ever take a chance with having it. If they still brew this stuff by the "" German Purity Law "" I think that they should probably stop doing that.

But I recently called Beck's brewmaster & he assured me that they were still brewing to the German Purity Law, which means they're only using water, barley malt, hops & yeast. I'm sure Pabst isn't doing the same. I know why all of you are rating Pabst higher than Beck's. It has nothing to do with PBR's quality. Rather, it's the ""pseudo-hipster's"" rating, i.e. ""PBR is 'cooler' than Beck's because it doesn't advertise & has the patriotic U.S. colors of red, white & blue."" C'mon everyone - get real. No way is PBR better tasting than Beck's. And no, I don't work for Beck's & I'm not German. However, I've brewed my own beers & know a bit of what I'm talking about.","Polecat41","Jul 28, 2012"

The nose was one of malt and biscuit. The taste is pure and clean, just what I'd expect from the style. Around medium bodied with a slight aftertaste. I've always considered this beer to be symbolic of the German pilsner style and as I've grown older and have experienced more beer styles it is not as outstanding as I once considered it, but it is still a mainstay in the style in my opinion. A quality brew that I won't skip over too often.","maleman","Mar 26, 2012"

The taste brings in more of the same, though a vague sense of corn-syrup-style sweetness comes in in a big way. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel.

The taste literally has no character. its a step up from busch and coors light but not much better than either one. The taste is good in that it goes down smooth and is good for anybody who just wants to drink. if you are looking for a beer with character Becks is not the one because you can taste hops and grain with water being the other prominent flavor. because of this I do not like this beer, and probably will not drink it again. this is just because I like beer with multiple flavors and robustness and character. others may think differently this is just what I think.","phenomenologian","Nov 28, 2011"

The mouth feel is watery with a slight oiliness. There is a carbonated bubbly feel against the top of my mouth. The taste reminds me of Pilsner Urquelle I had two days ago without nearly the same level of sourness (The Urquelles were the first Pilsners I've tried so maybe they were light damaged or maybe that's how a Pilsner is supposed to taste). There is a sweetness with Becks that is less evident then the mild sourness in the after taste. I prefer this to the Urquelle I had.","BeerBuggy","Sep 13, 2011"

Besides the skunk it had a grainy malt taste but with a pretty nice hop character that reminds of me of a subtle version of Victory's Prima Pils. Its a very floral bitter hop note that reminds me of the hops in a Boston Lager. It has some creamy mouthfeel which is definitely a plus.

I am less captivated by the aroma, dominated by corn and metal with a frail yet off-puttingly sharp edge of leafy hops and a suggestion of honey. Bizarrely sweet on the palate with an unpleasant sulfurous/fusel alcohol quality that interferes with an otherwise pleasant toasted grain flavor. Hops are nondescriptly bitter and especially noticeable in the finish, which is dry but not as dry as it ought to be. The carbonation is good - not too sharp, not too soft - but on the whole the body feels a bit thick. I must say I found this beer to be much worse than I expected, and my expectations were pretty low.

Color is a light yellow, and not paticularly attractive. I must say that it left pretty decent lacing around my glass. Flavor is short in duration, and a bit watered down in taste, but still pleasant. The hops come throught the most, and I would guess that this would go quite well with food. By itself, like I said, it is a bit boring and watery. Texture is watery again and a bit on the dry side of things. Carbonation is soft and the finish is extremely clean, very nice.

But this does beat every American pils (read Macro) lager I've had. If served this for free I'd be very happy, but there are tons of better (and often cheaper) brews you can usually find. Czechvar was is the superlative beer America's ""Budweiser"" is the mutant bastard version of.

However, the ¬ëmasses¬í that drink this might in fact be the more demanding members of the masses than those who drink Carlton in Australia, or Bud in the US. Beck¬ís, while it does lack some elements of flavour and mouthfeel, does provide a nice, refreshing taste. Is this due in part to the German Purity Laws? I don¬ít know. What I do know is that for an international macrobrew, I am not at all offended by Beck¬ís. I¬ím not that impressed, but I¬ím certainly not offended, and that adds to the drinkability which is top-notch. I would be happy if I found a keg of Beck¬ís at a summertime, outdoor BBQ.","DaveFL1976","Sep 14, 2005"

I was drinking straight out of the bottle so forgive me for not having tones of visual images. It did have some maltyness there but nothing to write home about and it did have a crisp flavor to it but like I said before it is very hard to get past the pure skunkyness of this beer. The thing that gets me the most is the fact that this is a German beer and they should know better. It¬ís just depressing that when your average person thinks of German beers they think of Becks.

The mouthfeel is alright, except that it could use a little more carbonation. If it's going to taste like a crappy macro, it might as well get the whole stereotype going.

The nose is fresh with some floral and grassy hops over a delicately grainy malt. The body is light-medium, and it's gently crisp on the tongue. The flavor delivers a delicate combination of floral and mildly grassy hops over a slightly straw-like maltiness that's solidly backed by bitterness. The dry and lingering finish is simply an extension of the flavor in the mouth with some maltiness and lightly floral hop flavor followed by a distinct bitterness.

It's a pale straw colour, had a decent head, but it shrunk immediately to a faint ring. Flavour is light and crisp, nothing very special, but it's drinkable, I don't mind it much at all, better than a Heinie.

Toward the middle part of the taste the hops appear with a harsh and bitter medicinal quality that lingers well past the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is rather watery.

Just to be sure, I confirmed that this bottle was well within its self-proclaimed window of freshness. Taste is not terrible, just terribly uninspiring. Mouthfeel is fine; this is a very smooth beer but a very bland beer. Just a bit of crispness toward the end, otherwise nondescript grains dominate. I notice the taste of water as much as I notice anything else, which probably isn't a good sign.
