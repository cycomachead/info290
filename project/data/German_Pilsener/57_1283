3.7,9.1,,,,,,"Pours golden with good clarity and lots of shine.  Fat head of off white foam that lasts well but does not leave lace.  Nose is a perfect clean grain scent with a shy bit of sweetness.  No esters from yeast and no hop scents on the nose. Smells like bread from the bakery.  Admirable.  Taste is good. Creamy body with a slight carbonation. Deep but not rich grain and some a faint sweetness.  The beer finishes clean crisp and with a bit of lemon.  Very very good. Drinks so easily. Too easily.","utopiajane","Aug 15, 2014"

Fajitas are fantastic and the beer is cold, the football high level. Lot of emotion. This is a good European Lager made in Mexico. Thank Emporer Maximillian for this, he brought the Austrian and German brewers with him long ago. In the bottle there is gold top and silver top. The silver is a dark and tasty brew if you can find it. Good beer.","WillWillows","Dec 07, 2013"

Bohemia is hoppy and crisp but really blossoms when the cold edge softens. I wouldn't start it at room temp, but it rounds out as it warms up for sure. The mouthfeel is on the light side but the taste packs a nice hoppy punch. It's well balanced too, but definitely hop-forward.","pallison123","Oct 16, 2013"

Golden colored liquid of credible depth and solid throughout, even darker when peering down into the glass, the small bubbles well dispersed. Straw, sweet grains and corn make up a good portion of the nose, however, it’s not simple nor obvious, has a fine quality which slowly draws out pepper, orange peel as well as peach, apple, pear scents, not that sweet while also avoiding any bitter greenness. Light-bodied with a steady, refreshing carbonation which scrubs the palate. The orange, lemon citrus plays to this nicely, as does the pepper to light clove spice and pressed flowers. Shade of natural country bread but not yeasty, more crunchy in feel. The apricot, peach, apple fruit close to evanescent. Maybe, just maybe, a dollop of honey.

But for all it's strengths, it lacks something vital in the aftertaste department. Yup, that's it: the problem is a bit of papery flavor and a slightly chalky, dry aftertaste.

Inoffensive and quaffable, definitely good for a hot day, as it goes down easy and is thirst-quenching.

You can trace its European ancestry with its use of hops and malted barley. However, neither is very prominent, as the beer is medium-light in taste and profile. It fits very well with Mexican food. Another thing of note is that if the beer is made with the use of adjuncts (corn or rice), it is done with a rather deft hand, as it does not taste like it. Again, the taste is of a pleasant light maltiness with subdued influences from the hops on the finish. Good food beer. I could put quite a few of these away.","FacistCannonBall","Oct 16, 2008"

Not much smell to speak of (though perhaps that is a good thing sometimes). Taste was, up front, malt... with a hint of floral hops. No off-tastes, no metallic or adjunct flavors to speak of; just a very nice, refreshing beer with a tiny bit of hops bitterness at the end of the swallor to keep you wanting to raise the glass.

The graininess and malty sweetness dominates. There is a corny hint to it which bothers me a tad. Decent bitterness. Light in the feel but not too bad.

The smell and flavor was what made it good for me. Although it was thin and fizzy, like all hot weather beers seem to be, it had an all-malt taste. It almost had a hint of caramel in it as it went down. It was short-lived after the watery taste bled through, but it was better than drinking more corona or a sugar-filled daquari.","Rudgers73","Apr 15, 2007"

It also reminded me of a less bold version of the Sly Fox Pils. It has a slightly bready flavor with grassy and floral hops. Drinks very crisp and it great for washing down food or just relaxing. Two bottles of this helped me put down 27 jumbo shrimp. Any beer that can do that and taste good is alright in my eyes. Not the best pils, but its in a brown bottle and a good choice is vacationing in Mexico","tempest","Mar 20, 2007"

It's very refreshing and easy to drink, making it a good choice when one is thirsty and doesn't want to drink water. Remember, this is a Mexican beer that's built for easy comsumption.

A bit of carbonation as well keeps this beer from lingering on the tongue too long, but still is not able to get the taste down in enough time.

Noticeable grain like flavors with a fair amount of malt, which finishes with a slight, but nice and noticeable hop taste. This brew is not bad; it was the first one that I came across where I could actually pick up a noticeable hop flavor.

The pale, toasted malt flavor seems more influenced by Pilsner and Munich malts than Vienna. The hops are unbalanced enough to leave traces of skunk in the aftertaste.

Plus I have another 5 to rate that I brought back. OK...Smelled decent. Had a few hops lingering around. Maybe a sweet flowery fruity flavor hiding in the background? Poured with a small head and a bit of lacing. Light yellow coloring. Tasted pretty good for a beer from Mexico. Maybe a cross between a pilsner and a lager? Good carbonation. A few light hops in there too. Maybe the third best beer I had back there. Refreshing, but would take another beer I like over it anytime. Worth a try.","GClarkage","Oct 17, 2004"

The smell was a combination of sweet and spicy with the malts, hops, and yeast all working together. The taste began with a grainy flavor but I didn't get much of the huskiness I get in other Mexican beers. The hops are definitely a spicier flavor and balance out the grain malts really well.

I've read that when eating spicy foods, you should drink beer that has a high ABV because the alcohol is what cuts the heat. The article also said that water won't rescue you from the fire.

Taste was pretty much the same as the smell except for a bit of a sweet taste thrown in.

It's darker than most Mexican beers, so it has some body to it and doesn't need a fruit to make it good. My good friends from college, the Coastas, named so because they were from Coasta Rica, brought me to it. They also gave me a cool little recipe that they use in Costa Rica w/ Bohemia. Take one bottle of it, mix it with a couple dashes of hot sauce and a couple dashes of lime juice. You have to trust me on this one. It'll make you sweat, but you just want even more.
