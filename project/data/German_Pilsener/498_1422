Reading the label it is made with barely malt and wheat so doesn't look adjunct. Pouring into my handy SAPP I get a bright yellow brew with a big bright white foamy head that tops out the remaining space in the SAPP. On the taste this brew is bitter sweet hopping with a nice maltiness in the background, well in line with what is expected from a typical Dutch brew. Very thirst quenching and tasty and will serve its purpose we'll for what it is intended, a lawn mower brew. Actually a quite good lawn mower brew.","mooseisloose","Sep 28, 2013"

3.86,28.7,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Okay, lets talk about the beer. Bavaria is brewed in Lieshout, Holland by the Bavaria Brewery. Note: They also produce Hollandia, which is very similar to Bavaria, if not identical. Bavaria is a typical Dutch Lager, being both medium gold and moderately hopped. It pours brilliantly clear and foamy, with a somewhat short-lived head. The aroma is clean malt with very subtle noble hop and yeast notes. The body is on the light side, but appropriate for the style. The flavor is crisp and clean, with moderate malt flavor and a short, mellow hop bite. I also detected some oxidation in the finish, despite the fact that this beer is only 3-4 months old. This is not surprising since light lagers dont tent to travel well, and this beer probably spent most of that time in a hot warehouse in the middle of the Texas Summer. Overall, I think this beer compares very favorably to other Dutch lagers. While it is not as assertive as Alfa Edelpils or Dommelsch, it is at least as tasty as Grolsch or the Big-H. Ill give this one a 4, based on being true to style, very drinkable, and an outstanding value. Bavaria is one of the best (if not *the* best) throw-down beers available.","SteveDanielSr","Nov 29, 2006"

3.4,13.3,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear pale yellowish-orange color with a modest off-white head. The smell consists of a skunky lemon twang hops and fresh-cut grass. The taste is very comparable to Heineken with the common lemony hop twang (again) and an earthy grain. This beer is very light bodied and finishes with a hint of corn sweetness. Not great, but this one will do in a pinch. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 07, 2004"
3.11,3.7,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Visually this beer is excellent, with a relatively longlasting head and a glorious golden lager colouration. Looks, however are not everything! It has a clean sweetish taste followed by a crisp faintly bitter finish. I would describe this beer as ""modest but likeable"" it doesn't exactly scream out with flavour but what is there is sufficent and certainly drinkable. As other reviewers have said - the price certainly aids in appreciating it!","jahsausage","Jan 23, 2004"
3.12,4,3,3.5,3,3,3,"This golden pilsner poured a nice head which went away pretty quickly. This brew had a sweet smell to it with a taste to match with not much of a hop followthru.

3.45,15,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white head. The aroma is average. There is the presence of pale malts and lager yeast. It is a bit less skunky than most of this style. It has a bit of green glass aroma, but not too overpowering. The taste is decent. It is light and actually tasteful. It has a bit of a malty aftertaste which pushes it ahead of most purely because it has some distinguishing characteristic. It is quite mellow, but has a slight metallic flavor to it. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks well for a pilsner. I enjoyed it.","WesWes","Jan 18, 2004"

2.23,-25.7,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Well, this was the most popular imported beer in Kazakhstan in the mid-nineties. That's about the most I can say for it. It pours a perfectly acceptable, utterly unremarkable clear gold with a small white head that sticks around a bit and leaves a bit of lace. The nose is powerful, actually pungent, with rice or grain or something. The mouth is very prickly, and full of sourish grain. The taste is stale malt and bad bread, with a weak hops chaser that can't break through the mold. The aftertaste is heavy and stale. Not a good product.","Globetrotter","Nov 04, 2003"

It pours a nice light straw colour.. The smell is what i expected from a green bottle lager, but it was lacking the typical skunkiness that I have found so often. The taste was similar to a deskunked fresh Heineken. It was nice and crisp and Clean with the hops giving it a nice slight bitterness in the finish. While i cant drink more than on Heineken ( cant stand it) i found my self thinking that this was not too bad a beer and much more drinkable than Heineken, Becks, or other Green bottle euro lagers.. Overall a suprisingly average beer, but that was not neccessarily a bad thing.","TinusTime","Aug 26, 2003"

Anyways, light and mildly sweet, a touch of corn-like sweetness, with lively carbonation and a sparkling clean mouthfeel. Hops are well done, and adequately provide a crisp, tangy finish. Aftertaste is negligible, disappearing from your mouth almost as soon as it's swallowed. I was happy with this pilsner, and I walked into the beer without any preconceived idea of what it would be like. I honestly had no idea, and was pleasantly surprised.","UnionMade","Aug 17, 2003"

I'm getting a somewhat bitter aftertaste, which is surprising given the thin mouthfeel and watery finish. OK, so they used some hops. Really not much to get excited about here. If you love Heineken, get this instead and save two bucks on the sixer. If you love good beer, get something else. This is average beer all the way, not much different than our domestic macros.","au1sec","Aug 04, 2003"

It pours a golden straw color with decent head that thins out to a layer that stays on top to the bottom of the glass. The smell good without a skunky aroma commonly found with other Hollish beers. The taste was very good with nice maltiness paired with the hops. It is very smooth and very drinkable. This is a great brew that I will definitely get again, probably many times. The best part is that it is imported by a company here in my home city of Dallas and is frequently on sale.","tang214","Dec 08, 2002"

3.45,15,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours an absolutely crystal clear deep golden body topped by a frothy but etheral head which drops to a minor collar and whispy surface covering within seconds. The aroma offers a soft grainy maltiness and a mildly skunked herbal hoppiness. The body is medium with a fine-bubbled carbonation that's just below standard levels (@ 2.4 volumes CO2) and gives a light tingle on the tongue before becoming fairly creamy in the mouth. The flavor melds a semi-rich and lightly sweet maltiness with a lightly earthy and herbal hoppiness so well that they appear almost as one. I'd imagine that this might be a factor of freshness except that the skunkiness is so limited (and the bottle appears quite new). If it's possible, I might suggest that this beer is too well balanced! It seems to lose character as it's become quite one-sided. Bitterness is clearly present, as is hop flavor, but it's restrained. And the limited level of carbonation doesn't help to bring out what is there. Still, there are some nice malt and hop flavors in this easy to drink beer giving it a fairly good drinkability. Nice, but overshadowed by many other European pilseners.","NeroFiddled","Nov 18, 2002"
3.08,2.7,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Typical European Lager aroma, fairly mild skunkiness, and once that fades, a fairly decent creamy-grassy/hay, citrus, and hops bouquet is noticeable.  The palate is similar to the nose; just add in some mouth-watering (literally) sourness.  The body is pale yellow with a white head of a 1/2-inch, good retention and decent lace.  All aspects of this beer are typical for the style... if you like the style, try it.  I feel it is less flavorful that Grolsch but better than Heineken.","bditty187","Oct 24, 2002"

Pleasing aroma consists of grassy notes, sweet malt, lemon, and slight hops.  Flavor begins with slightly sweet malts and a surge of carbonation, mild hops rise in the middle of the taste, finish is dry and mildly bitter.  As other reviewers have noted, this beer is a good value, I paid $3.49 for a six-pack of 12 oz bottles, leaving little to complain about.","Pegasus","Oct 15, 2002"

A little clove to the aroma, not much detectable skunk.  Sweet and malty upfront, a little sense of Karo syrup and an unfortunate walk toward elements of that glue on the back of brown mailing tape.  Finishes quickly thereafter but the hops are mediocre, very macro-like.  Forgetable beer in practically all aspects.","ADR","Oct 08, 2002"

Cooked veggies, grassy hop, pungent sulfur, and grain husk in aroma.  The off putting sweetness and astringent grain flavors coupled w/ the meager hop bitterness and lack of any noteable hop flavor render this brew most unenjoyable and rough.
