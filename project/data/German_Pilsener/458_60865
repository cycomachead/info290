3.46,-10.8,3,3.75,3.5,2.75,3.5,"Overall: I really want to like this beer. Yes, I get that hop-forward Pils is what kinda Märicans probably are hankerin' for, but it still is slightly disappointing for me. It's quite bitter, almost in the high 30s or low 40s IBU-wise, and again, I'm finding a serious lack of enough German Pils malt backbone. It's like, "hey, I can do hops, yeah, hops, that's it, I'll hop it up, and now I got a Pils." Unfortunately, hops are only a part of a Pils, and though a hoppy Pils is good, balance within the spectrum of Pils malt sweetness is essential to make it get beyond just good or serviceable. But after drinking more sips, I'm getting more Pils malt sweetness, even though I can't pinpoint where it's coming from, but it's almost a sickly sweetness that's not complex enough. Hard to explain such nuances, but that's where I'm at for this beer. The mouthfeel, though crisp, is still a major demerit for me. A 3.5 of 5.","boddhitree","Jun 06, 2014"

That said, this stuff right here pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light biscuit, grass, flowers, and a twinge of what almost seems like cilantro way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, the background spiciness now less cilantro-like and more almost lime-peel-like. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice pils, one I could easily see drinking many of in the cruel heas of a Texan summer.","TMoney2591","Sep 16, 2013"

3.9,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Hans Pils has a bubbly body, pleasant mouthfeel, and crispness. The bitter sensations and somewhat sour flavor could surprise some people at first, especially those who are used to plain ol’ American style, mass produced pseudo pilsners. But the overall flavor is tasty and memorable. Add everything together and you have a very respectable effort that can compete with the better American pilsners.","BryanCarey","Aug 29, 2012"

It tastes pretty much the same with grassy hops and a hint of lemon and grain, really not much else, but very nice in aroma and taste. The beer is medium bodied with a good amount of light carbonation and a dry finish.","JMad","Aug 22, 2012"

The smells are earthy, a little grassy hops and some light crisp malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, earthy and grassy, nice amount of hops and very crisp, not bad.","DavidST","Jul 02, 2012"

4.12,6.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a light golden color. It’s hoppy in a way that most pilseners aren’t, with a wonderful Czech Saaz hop profile on the nose and palate. There’s a crisp, dry finish and a some faint biscuit on the nose that reminds me of the Real Ale Fireman’s. Some chew, a fuller body than I’d expect for a pils but not in a bad way at all. This might be my favorite pilsener at the moment.","elNopalero","Sep 11, 2011"

3.25,-16.2,4,4,3,3.5,2.5,"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grassy and earthy hops with some flowery notes. The flavor is grapes and biscuit malt but it is very bitter. The bitterness is well above what I expect in a pilsener and detracts from the overall flavor of the beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The bitterness in this beer needs to be toned way down before I can enjoy it.","Mora2000","Aug 23, 2010"

4.22,8.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"american pilsners are getting better. this is proof. voluminously hoppy and airy feel... now we just need to get the character in the malty backbone... for something worldclass.","rtepiak","Aug 14, 2010"
4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The flavor is everything the aroma promised, and more. Sharp, crisp German hops bite the palate with notes of fresh grass and bitter resin. Hops linger long into the finish like a good IPA, but never are the malts pushed the background, instead balancing nicely with cracker and bleached flour. Uber-clean with no off-flavors. Mouthfeel is superb: light-bodied, well-carbonated, and effortlessly drinkable on a hot Austin day. Han's Pils is easily one of THE best American-made German Pilseners I've come across. Gives Victory's Prima Pils a run for its money.","wagenvolks","Aug 09, 2010"
4.15,7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Well done Real Ale. This is very enjoyable. Nuanced and subtle, just like a good lager should be. Some recurring themes, but well earned. An excellent lager, and highly recommend.","champ103","Aug 07, 2010"
