"This beer reminds me of tastier version of a Budweiser or PBR.  It's very easy to drink and I do enjoy the light mouth-feel.  The balance of hops and malt is appreciated."

"Krombacher Pils -----4/5."

"Overall â€“ This beer is pretty damned good. The flavour profile is pretty much exactly what a Pilsner in this style should be. Of all the German Pils I have had the pleasure to drink this is one of the best."

"draft pint at local tavern. straw-yellow in color. 2 fingers of head, good lacing all the way down. decent german pils, nothing special. drinks easy. could have a few of these. grass/husk aroma. earthy hop notes. decent balance and drinkable."

"05/09/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. A bit heavy on taste & texture. Some flavor which I can't place was a bit up front."

"Poured from a bottle into a beer mug. Large white head with excellent retention.  Golden amber color with a strong smell and taste of hops. The aftertaste is delightfully bitter.  I bought this bottle as part of a build your own six pack deal, and I'm glad I did. It is an excellent beer."
"My mark out of one hundred would be 87."

"330ml bottle. Footed Pilsner glass. Golden color, clear appearance, headed by white close crown. Slight honey & citric aromas & slight sulfur notes. Grainy & pale malty upfront followed by earthy bitterness. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Watery texture. Clean, slight harsh, bitterness & light metallic hues in the middle resolves in a long bitter finish. Refreshing & very easy drinkability."

"Smooth and easily drinkable. Enough taste."

"German brewers are not immune to concerns of cost, efficiency, and consistency - it's not uncommon for bigger commercial ones to do things their grandfathers would never be caught dead doing. By and large, however, they've maintained higher standards; Krombacher isn't a whole lot different from other mass-produced lagers in its price range - but it is a bit better."
"overall an average pils. not bad."

"Tried on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary, a classic lager start to the evening. I have also tried this in bottles. Classic German pilsener in the glass, a gold straw color with a smattering of white foam on top. Aroma was quite subdued, I do not possess the world's greatest olfactory sense but I can usually get more than this, especially from something on tap ... Faint cracker malts and musty hay-like noble hops on the nose, and more of the same on the palate. Fortunately I could taste more than I could smell, the aforementioned noble hops were prominent and fairly enjoyable, fresh grass and hay playing off some herbal notes like mild licorice and bitter watermelon rind. There is a grainy cracker-like malt backbone with hints of green grape fruitiness and a grain husk astringency. Aggressive carbonation along with a little metallic copper afterburn. Crisp and dry with less residual sweetness, DMS, and doughy character than most commercial Euro lagers. A decent noble hops showcase on tap (less fresh in the bottles I've sampled) and a pretty standard German pilsener for the purists, albeit one with a macro-brewed feel: Fizzy, harsh, and rather vapid."

"A Brownish-Amber beer with a very good head and good lacing after drinking. This was the first Pilsner that I managed to get a decent amount of foam with. The smell was good with a sweet overtone and a little bread. The taste was a bit of a let-down as there wasn't much there. You could feel the beer down the middle of the palate and it hit all the sensors, but it just did not thrill me. Overall, an okay beer."

"Overall - a good pilsener that is better than many, but wish there was a little more in the aroma department up front. Certainly a thirst quencher, but would prefer other pilseners in comparison to this one."
"Overall-Easy drinking German pils. Nothing that will blow your socks off but something that you can drink multiple times without thinking or worrying about much."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is intensely skunky after the pour but it dissipates over time and gives way to some malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the initial blast of skunk is quite unpleasant."
""
""

""
""
""
"Overall - 3.25/5 Nothing particularly stand out-ish about this pils. Not bad by any means, but it doesn't stand out either. As compared to other German pils it may be on the lighter side."
""
""
"Overall: A decent pils, but by no means the best from Germany or the most representative of the style. Very easy drinking. Very cheap and widely available in Germany, which gives it a poor reputation in Germany as a 'Fernsehbier' (television-beer). I would not seek this one out."
""

"Bought in Sarajevo, at a neighborhood grocery store. Pours clear golden color with a creamy head that leaves decent lacing. Smells slightly grassy with a touch of sour aroma. Moderate carbonation, some hop bitterness and decent presence of malty sweetness. Smooth and drinkable but not outstanding, nothing to distinguish this beer from other similar ones, just an average German pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special. Easy drinking enough and better than BMC, but not a remarkable in anyway."
""
""
"Overall, a well-made German pils but it doesn't necessarily stick out among the many others out there. Worth picking up for something different."
""
""
"Not a bad beer, depends to what you compared it, still lacks personality (maybe a general flaw of most pilsners, off-course partially you have to attain to the proposed style)."
""
""
""
"The carbonation is quite lively and lends a mouthfeel that compliments the flavor nicely and really holds the whole thing together. I'm a devout detractor of Pilsners, but I must give this one credit for bringing something different to the table and keeping me interested. Krombacher has fuller flavor and substance than I'm used to experiencing in this style, so I will certainly credit them for that. This hardly has made me a Pilsner man, but if obligated to have one, I wouldn't mind having this."

"O: This is a very easy to drink beer, quite sessionable, and enjoyable. Nothing special about this beer but definitely a beer that would be easy to have a couple in a sitting. Would pair well with a meat-heavy German meal."
""
""
""
""
"As a German Pilsner it's right on. Quite nice."
"O: Like taking a yeasty roll in the hay this Pils embodies that simmering hot summer day when you were too stupid, too poor and too sweaty to linger in the beer isle. The problem with his beer boys and girls is that as soon as the chill haze wears off, so does the delightful bitter carbonated refreshment that first excites you. Not unlike young love, this beer is good for a quick July night under the stars, just make sure that there is plenty of ice in the cooler and a more then one."
"M: near medium body; very good carbonation; smooth"
""
"Great little german pils alternative."
""
""
"A dry aftertaste with a slight bitter nip on this light bodied beer."
""
""
"Bright golden colour, one finger of sticky white head, dense with lots of lace. Smell is grainy and biscuity, light floral hop and grassy and earthy notes, a touch metallic as well. Taste is of cracker like malt, some grassy-lemony hops, grainy, more of the metallic character detected in the nose, long malty aftertaste. Medium carbonation, crisp medium body. While not wholly satisfying it was still an OK drink but that being said it is most likely one and done for me."
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 3.56, a manageable B grade. Unremarkable, yet still highly drinkable, Krombacher Pils is one addition to the LCBO's staggeringly huge lineup of pale lagers that I can appreciate. Now if only they'd get rid of all those lame ones, and use that space for something more interesting. But I digress - this is a respectable, affordable pilsener that is at least worth a try for any fan of German pale lagers."
""
"Poured into a pilsner a light golden with a decent sized rocky white head that was gone pretty quickly.The nose is very clean...too clean,a bit of toasted grain and faint hint of iron and that's about it.Mild flavors of toasted bread and that iron note,light sweetness in the finish.Eh I wanted something I could drink while grillin in the heat,I could have done better."
"O - its on the mark in terms of ease of drinking and feel, but it is just a little lacing in the flavour department, I get the feeling this is a 'get it down your gullet' type of mass consumed brew in Germany, not bad but an average pils"
""
""
""
"Overall - While it is very drinkable I was hoping for a little more of a refreshing taste/flavour. It had a grainy/herbal bitterness to it that seemed to take away from the crispness. Still a decent beer, just not something I'd buy again."
""
""
"Overall: A perfect summer beer. I""ll be picking up a lot more of this stuff."
""
""
""
"This German pilsnener can be compared to many premium lagers out of Germany. To me it was nothing new, but what keeps this lager legitimate, is the authenticity of the style. Very refreshing for the summer months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- This is a well-done, clean and crisp German Pils with nothing outstanding, yet absolutely refreshing and satisfying -- and highly sessionable at 4.8. I may have to get more for the coming summer weekends at $13 a 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
"O: Thereâ€™s nothing overly special about this pilsener, but itâ€™s quite easy to drink and would pair well with some German food."

"Overall not the best pils but decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor was perfectly fine, just not out of this world. Tasted like a pilsner but not as much bite on the tongue that I usually like from a German Pilsner."
"Can, half a litre at home. Poured a golden yellow colour with a two finger head that soon went away, but stayed enough to protect the surface. Average bubbles rising to the top. Aroma is of malts and something I can't put my finger on, but quite pleasant. Taste is bitter and metallic. Medium bodied, leaves a dryness on your tongue. Average carbonation. Overall one step ahead of your average german pilseners."
""
"Picked up a single at Euro Market. Tastes like your standard German pils. There's clean bready malts, and as the lager warms, a pleasant herbal lemon hops edge emerges. It's not the most complex pils, but the right flavors are there, it's satisfying, and very drinkable. By memory, it's fairly similar to Bitburger, which is not a bad place to be. I wouldn't go out of my way to pick this up, but it's not a bad option."
""
""
"I picked this one up as a mixed-sixer to sample a brew that I first had on a trip Germany. It was a pleasant trip down memory lane, and a decent brew, but nothing outstanding."
""
"Very light taste, more of the lemony character, mouthfeel extremely faint, almost no malt character, the yeast was nice and neutral. A pretty neutral beer overall, the price is a little much from when I first got turned on to these back in Milwaukee at Koppa's and The Annex. I think the draft version had less bitterness to it. Halfway down it would recede into a smoother, creamier experience."
"This is a good looking beer with light pale yellow in color and thick foamy head that well retain itself also left some decent laces, visible carbonation is high. Smell is like typical Germanâ€™s Pils with bready malt and spicy floral hop in nose yet a bit herbal. Bread/grain malt also dwells in its taste with moderate bitterness from hop to balance. Overall, it is decent and goes down well easy."

"A decent pilsner; crisp and refreshing with a hoppy bite. Slides down nicely - I could imagine sinking a few steins of this."
""
""
"Opinion: Well, I must say that I am enjoying this beer quite a bit. I personally like a Pilsner that is more like a Helles, so this one fits the bill nicely. That said, it is a bit light in the hop department for this style...but you expect that a bit since it is brewed more in the middle of the country than in the North where the beers are notably more hoppy. Either way, if you like Pilsners OR Helles, I would give this one a shot on a clean palate and I don't think that you will be disappointed."

"Decent, but not great. Not the most solid Pils i've had unfortunately."

"Overall: I received this as a re-gift, my aunt received it from a German exchange student. The bottle had a best-before date of mid-August, so I was pleasantly surprised how good it tasted despite being out of date. Brown bottle and constant refrigeration probably helped. Anyway, this is a solid pilsner with a little more corn flavor than it probably should have, but that's ok with me."
"12 oz bottle born on 8/24/2011 poured into Sam Adams glass. Nice two finger tightly bubbled head, pours light straw colored with good lacing. Aroma is bready malt. Taste some subtle spicy hops but overall a bit underwhelming, a little metallic and sour. Nice crisp mouthfeel, but smooth - would make a decent session beer. Always been a big fan of German Pilseners and this one's a decent selection but nothing that really stands out."
"Overall: A very basic, simple, standard pils. It gets the job done but doesn't have that lil' extra something magical to keep me coming Krombach for more."
"My Cuz married a German bird and he and his hottie are Krombacher fans so I bought some for them on their recent visit. This is a typical German Style Pils. The color is golden clear with good carbonation that provides a thin white head that appears to be lacing. Grain and barley power the aroma on this beer...not much else. The taste is a standard German pils with a kick of wheat/barley/grain. Mouthfeel is good, on the lighter side which makes for a good session. Overall...its a good German pils."
"O: This a good representative of a german pilsner. Not bad."
"Tastes a little swilly and metallic. Wet and bready with some pilsner malt and vague residual bitterness in the back after a bigger swig. Clean enough, somewhat crisp and quenching in hot weather. Pretty utilitarian, though you could do plenty worse."
"Nice pour, good golden clarity, plenty of white head and head retains fairly well. Nose is very light, with a whiff of herbal hops, some skunk, and grain. Palate is cereal grain sweet, light and almost adjuncty, with a semi-brisk balance from the hops. Some hops linger on the finish too, but then the cereal grain just won't go away even on the aftertaste."
"A good pilsner, for some reason it's hard to find good ones anywhere."
"Poured a nice light straw color with a good head on it. Very fragrant nose with lots of grains, malty tones and some straw tones as well. Medium bodied that is more grainy on the palate than on the nose. Very good feel that is very smooth as well. This is an excellent session pilsner that scratches the itch perfectly"
"11.2 oz bottle in the Us: not as good but it is freshly imported and isn't too bad."
"O - Its very easy drinking; a good German Pils."
"This is a simple and clean Pilsner overall which makes very refreshing. No outstanding features, but sometimes simpleness is good; worth a try."
"O: I enjoyed this beer at Gathaus Gutenberger with a giant plate of great German food. It wasnâ€™t anything special but it did the job. I would gladly have another glass of this there."
"It's drinkable enough."
"Drinkability - Decent for the style. Nothing to write home about."
"Light body and good carbonation. Very drinkable. Although abit tin in the flavour department it is a worthy pils with no major flaws."
"Drinkability - Unfortunately I poured this before it had enough time to chill properly, so this might have affected my experience. I'm a mere Acolyte and this is my first Pilsner review, and I have to say I think this isn't the beer style for me. The bite of the bitterness really isn't to my liking, but that said, you live and learn."
"D: When your appearance is the best thing by far, and you are a product to be consumed, that is not a good sign."
"D - A bit light in flavour, even for a Pilsner, but still a decent one to drink."
"D Good beer, better cold than warm and one of the better German Pilsners I've had in Germany.Â There is either a lack of good Pilsners, or I had a particularly difficult time finding them. Having tried several nasty examples, I was quite happy to find the Krombaacher. 3.5"
"Pours a nice straw yellow color with a tiny hint of cloudiness. The head does disappear kinda quick but it does stick around for little bit. like a minute or so. Smells like a typical German Pilsener, tastes like a typical german pilsener but overall it does go down fairly easily. Not too over carbonated and has an o.k. lingering aftertaste ( which is not too bad ) but at the same time its not the greatest. Hint of spicy hops? not sure on that one. Everyone i know says this beer is super.. Its just not doin' it for me. Its good, not super. But I think its clean, light, crisp taste would go very well on a hot day!"
"After revisiting Krombacher, I've come to realize that it competes nicely with my beloved KÃ¶nig, with a more satisfying maltiness to boot."
"Something weird going on here: This is the 3rd bottle/can in a row from the same store, all different brewers, that have been somewhat flat.This one poured with a large fluffy, foamy, thick, white head that lasts a while and some lace. Color is a clear yellow. Aroma is malt, hop, grain. Flavor is like nose and has a good bitter/sweet balance but again, the tang of carbonic acid is missing. Body itself is quite good but is hampered by the lame carbonation. Finish is like flavor and slowly tapers off in medium length. Really could have given this beer a much higher score, were it not for the bubbles which are crucial to a Pilsner of any type including the Germans. For some examples: appearance - the image of the clear yellow liquid with a couple little trails of bubbles rising to the top is a key part of its beauty; in aroma - it's that gas coming out of solution that carries some of those components to the nose. Need that gas, man."
"D: Overall a nice German Pilsener. If the taste had been a little stronger and the aftertaste a little longer and more bitter this would have been worldclass."
"D Easy to drink, which is about all that it has going for it."
"Looks like a sexy blonde as w3ell when poured that gives big head ;O) Just kidding but the drinkability of this served cold in a Pils glass on a warm summer night was immense!!!"
"I'd drink this again its a decent beer, I wish our macros had some flavor like the Germans"
"Very pleasant, full flavoured approachable Pilsner. One of the better export German pils."
"A refreshing easy-drinker, I wish all mass produced domestic lagers were at least at this calibre."
"Not bad, very knock-backable. Nothing special, however, and not one I'll actively seek out again."
"A very enjoyable and drinkable beer which can be drank all over Germany. It is a well known and commercial beer."
"A pleasant enough Pilsener, nothing revelatory, yet it works well with the usual culinary suspects. Better beer plus better pizza - what a concept."
"I could drink maybe one more."
"The beer looks just fine, though, with a short-lived head and decent lacing. The taste is hoppier than the nose led me to believe, but it's still very grainy and yeasty for the style. The mouthfeel is light, almost watery, and although it's drinkable, it's definitely not a must-drink. It was much better for washing down my curry tonight than it was on its own."
"Overall: nice, crisp and refreshing pilsen. Well balanced. I could happily have another one."
"A good solid pils, although not the best this country has to offer. And yet another Euro-pils that easily eclipses the crappy and stupidly popular U.S. corporate versions."
"This might work better for me washing down some curry but by itself it is a bit bland."
"Drinkability: I'll bet this beer is pretty damn good ""vom Fass"" in Deutschland, but this bottled version may have arrived a tad late to our shores for a real good judgement on it. Still, if I were a peasant farmer in rural Germany, this beer is the one I'd ask for on a hot summer day after working in the fields. It does go down rather easy!"
"Light pale gold color with a big creamy head on top. This beer has a sweet pale malt aroma, and the taste takes the same route as the aroma. It's very sweet with the usual grassy and floral notes trailing behind. Some might find this to be a little sweet, but I can dig it. It worked well washing down my grilled chicken entree."
"D - Extremely quaffable and easy drinking. Lacks the complexity of some of the better examples of the style, but its still a pleasing beer to slake a thirst after a workout (as I'm doing just now). Not bad, but slightly forgettable. This is one of those beers that I'll probably pick up again without realizing that I've already tried it... then I'll get home and check BA and be slightly aggravated that I didn't recall ever having it. (That happens a lot with German beers since all of the bottles have the same shape and many of the labels lack the cartoony or artistic imagination of Belgian or American breweries)."
"D: Easy to drink, I could have a few of these."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style German Pilsener."
"There is nothing specatacular about this beer, but it is done well, and is definitely sessionable. I will happily drink this again."
"Real pilsner feel to this beer, a good example of the style. I know this beer from old and it has stood the test of time better than some I've revisited lately."
"This is about as refreshing as one can get in the lager family. Definitely totally balanced and is a swell session cervesa."
"Not bad, not good."
"nothing to write home about, but more than acceptable."
"This brew was a decent surprise. A perfect beer to have with some German fare such as some jaegerschnitzel or some wursts."
"This was a a nice solid brew. A good representation of a Pils. Are there better? Sure, but you can do a lot worse than this."
"Very enjoyable, I wouldn't mind drinking this again, and $1.89 for a 17 oz single wasn't that pricey. It's on the sweeter side vs. sharp hops, if that bothers you then find another pils."
"this runs under ""Premium"" in the shop where I bought it, but my best guess is, this being the same brew ... quite surprising quality for a canned lager (to start with), there is everything you would expect from this type of beer: a nice foam, a hoppy smell, a balanced taste (between hops and malt) and unfortunately also a sour aftertaste ..."
"From a Â½ liter can, this brew is light and golden. The head is puffy, white, and nicely soapy. There's a respectable lace. The beer presents a perfumy, hoppy smell that's backed with a little pale malt. Not bad, actually. There's a bit of a bread and dough flavor that comes out in the taste. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a metallic quality that shows up in the mid-taste. The finish is subtle and soft. Medium to light in mouthfeel, with a smooth quality. This is a respectable and nicely drinkable brew."
"Overall an average pils. Nothing too exciting here. Easy enough to drink however."
"Golden orange in color and a nice airy white head dissipating to a thin patchy cap. The nose was fair by standard with a floral hop aroma. Taste is bitter and dry off the bat, and an earthy, woodsy background. Carbonated well and crisp. The finish is dry and a little metallic like but further turns sweeter and crackerish. It coats well for an enjoyable mouth. Nice balance overall with just enough malt character to match the hops."
"Krombacher Pils pours a pale yellow with a fluffy white head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is very mild, a hint of hops maybe. Malt dominates the flavor at first, followed by a metallic hop taste. More malty than hoppy. I'd pass and try something else."
"This beer is not very tastey. Not enough hops, even for an international pilsner, also some funky off flavors. Just a notch or two above undrinkable."
"A fair pils from Germany. Pours out to a medium golden color with a big head of fluffy white foam. Lots of lace. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of sour maltiness and some floral hops. Taste is suprisingly fresh and light; flavors of medium bodied malts cross over to a white bread note, with hints of floral hops lingering in the background. Not bad. Mouthfeel was crisp and enjoyable. Drinkability is north of average. This would make for a good light evening beer. Worth a try."
"Smell is very bready and malty, nice hint of aroma hops hidden in there, nothing much complex, slight veggie smell, but not skunky or unpleasant, very much just a refreshing pilsner aroma. Taste is very pleasant, very malty and a slight nuttiness in the back. Low bitterness, but enough to keep it interesting. Mouthfeel isn't as bitey as I'd like, but it's a mild complaint. This is a slightly above average pils, thirstquenching and highly drinkable. Not the best ever, but good."
"Medium gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Aromas begin with sulfur, then eventually reveal some honey malt and grassy hop notes. Some grassy and spicy hop flavor notes are there, along with some more light malt notes on the back end. Its got a bitter soapy finish too, which isn't as clean as I'd like. Slightly below average for the style."
"Taste is also fresh and has good but not that high dosed bitterness, that keeps hanging in my mouth. Further again good maltpalate but IMO litle too much for a Pils and the whole beer reminds me more of a Helles then a pilsner. Easy drinkable and a good sesionbeer for a heavy night of drinking but there are lots of more enjoyable pilseners that I would prefer to drink."
"Not an exquisite beer but tasty and goes down the hatch quite easily. This is workmanlike, blue collar beer typical of the style."
"Sharp grainy nose on a malt background. Fizzy bite, bitter hops, some malt. No really well pronounced flavours or aromas. Dry and hoppy. Your average Euro pils, good with a sandwich or sausage."
"This is a much better beer on tap, a good session lager"
"I picked up a 6 pack of this stuff for the first time because my wife likes pilsners and isn't crazy about Hefe Weisse which i have been drinking almost exclusively latley. Yellow gold with a frothy but small head. Mild hop aroma and the taste is a little too sweet. Like beer mixed with a sweet white wine. This stuff is smooth and drinkable though. I prefer a little drier, crisper pilsner but this is ok in a pinch."
"Perhaps this better in some other format, or, undoubtedly, when fresher, as any beer is...but this sample was unsatisfactory!"
"most popular beer in Germany they told us?"
"I really liked the initial flavour. But ultimately the bitterness to the exclusion of malt didn't allow enough balance to make it pleasing throughout."
"When I opened the bottle I immediately thought 'damn, my first skunked beer in Germany'. Luckily, that was not the case. Nevertheless it made me very reluctant to take that first sip. When I did I was relieved that it was still 'good'. Color is pale and has the color of urine the morning after a hard night's drinking. Not something that makes you go yum. Taste is drinkable. Its nothing great nothing bad--a perfect 3. Herby flavors are there along with a dominate but lightly bitter hop profile. Mouthfeel is comparable to memories of American macro-lagers and not of any German Pils ive had before."
"Drinkability: I would drink Krombacher Pils again. Beer drinkers in South Korea can't afford to be too particular and I am thinking about picking up a 5 litre keg, because this Pilsener certainly beats most of the other available options."
"Pours out a white head with a beautiful golden colour. Not much nose but that seems alright to me. In the mouth there is a taste of malt and an aftertaste of hops that lasts after it goes down. I like that - its nice to be reminded you just had a swallow of a decent beer. I love that aftertaste. Krombacher Pils is one of those beers that one needs to come back to after trying different brews - it brings you back to basics!"
"The is a light beer where the hops grab you tongue and does the hula. This is a bright and nice beer."
"Light gold color, large foamy head. Aroma is grainy and slightly sweet, A medium bodied pilsner. Crisp and refreshing. Light malt and hops. Nice balance. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full round and smooth. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice pilsner."
"This is a top German pilsner. Clear gold lies under a beautifully contoured white head that lingers all the way to the bottom leaving a veritable blanket of lace all along the side. The smell is a well-balanced mix of malt and flowery hops. The mouthfeel is just a tad tingly and dominated by malt. The taste starts as sweet barley, with a lovely flowery hop bitterness giving chase. The aftertaste is all hops. A fine product indeed."
"This brew has a light and grainy aroma that hints at caramel. Pours a light sparkling golden. The huge fluffy white head has excellent lacing and is everlasting with a full 2 inches remaining at the bottom of my pilsener flute. The sweet flavor has no acidity and finishes mildly bitter. The light watery palate is lively and finishes clean. Probably better on tap, since I did detect the typical aluminum flash of stagnicity in the aftertaste."
"Average German beer with nothing special to make you want to drink this beer in the pubs or with food. It's one of those not-bad-not-good beers which you would go for an alternative if there was one but wouldn't refuse to drink it if there wasn't any other beer..."
"Yeah, i liked it OK. Sweetsih palate, with mild maltiness and hoppiness, quite light in body, thinish palate, but highly drinkable and in-offensive, maybe a bit fizzy aswell."
"Taken from a 5 liter mini-keg. Classic German Pils taste, well-balanced sweet pale malts and Noble hops. I have to believe the mini-keg served this beer well as it was smoother than most German-style pilsners I've had and had no hint of sulfur or skunk. Would be interesting to compare to the bottled version."
"Fairly average pilsener.  Bottle is a lighter shade of brown, needs to be a little darker, as mine had a slighty light-struck (skunky) aroma.  OK, but nothing special."
