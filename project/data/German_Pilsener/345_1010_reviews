"A pilsner with nearly the body of a pale ale and a good taste and equally solid finish to boot."
""
"This the beer I drink. My regular in the keg late spring and summer. Simple and refreshing. Great to come home to after fishing. Better than lemonade."
""
""
""
"Like if Miller Lite was any good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer just a touch fruity pils taste"
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty much hits the nail on the head for the ""hoppy pilsner"" style: crisp, hoppy, and very drinkable. It might go juuust slightly overboard on the hops for my taste, but I could see myself knocking back a few of these any old time. An excellent beer."
""
""
""
"I don't really get the (relative) hype on this beer.  If you want a Pilsner with no flavor, I guess it's a good choice, but there's much better craft Pilsners out there."
""
""
"Pours a light gold. Smells like wheat and bananas. Tastes very refreshing. A really enjoyable beer."
"Prosit!"
"It Looked good, but tasted putrid"
""
""
""
""
"They all taste nearly identical.  But I could drink these all night, if there was nothing more interesting."
"Just sweet and hoppy enough. Would like just a bit more dry and crisp, but I'm splitting hairs. A great Pilsner."
""
""
"Just not that good. Bitter"
""
"Ever since I lived in Prague for six months I've been chasing the dragon for a solid domestic Pilsner. This beer is the closest I've come to satisfying that craving. My hope is that my purchasing large quantities of this beer will help the microbrew movement move away from constant IPAs and branch out into more European-style Pilsners."
"Decent Pilsner. Had it draft, a little skunky that threw me off. Other than the skunkiness I though it was a good representation of a German Pilsner."
""
"Overall, just a really tasty, crisp and refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Prima is a world-class pilsner. One of the first American beers I tried years back that stood up to the classics of that style. It remains at the top of the class in what now may be an underappreciated category here in the States."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into pilsner glass. Beer is clear, bright golden yellow with a white two-finger head that drops down some, but hangs on for the duration. Sticky lacing clings in patches to the glass. Aroma is more assertive than typical pilsners with herbal and citrus hop notes underpinned by bready malt. Taste follows the nose - strong spicy, herbal bitterness with light bread and grainy malt sweetness. Surprisingly medium in body, light and crisp texture, lively carbonation, long bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great hoppy pils.  Taste and mouthfeel are excellent  Smooth coming in, going down and the aftertaste is heaven.  Very good beer."
""
"Too hoppy for me taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really good example of a German Pils. Just all around very balanced. I will get this again in the summer. :)"
""
""
"Delicious! A classic German pils and an excellent session beer. Weak lacing though"
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear and golden with a light head. Nose is sweet with a hint of grass. Taste was spicy hops with a bite. Really clean feel. Excellent pilsner!"
""
""
""
""
"I'd put this slightly above Nooner Pils."
"Looks like a pilsner, good carbonation. Has that wheat smell I like and tastes OK but fades into that thicker syrupy honey taste/feel that I don't really like in some pilsners."
""
""
""
"22oz bottle poured into a Pilsner glass. Pours a clear light golden color with abundant carbonation. Only a thin head and not much lacing. Floral scent. Course feel.  Dry hoppy taste with moderate bitter aftertaste. A very solid, thirst quenching, sessionable Pilsner. It's status as a category leader is well deserved (9.0)"
""
""
""
"O: My go to Pilsener. Great for a lighter less filling beer with good taste and moderate hoppiness."
""
"Pours a yellow color. No head. Smells bready, slightly sweet, and has a noticeable hop aroma in there. Tastes fuckin' great! Bready malt, and a very subtle hop flavor comes through towards the end of my glass.  Light body, easy to drink. Awesome pils."
""
""
"I don't think American Pilsner gets better than this.  Sometimes over carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing pilsner , great taste with a little bite. Good choice when you need a cold one."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not the biggest Pilsner fan..but I do really enjoy this brew if I'm looking for something on the lighter side to drink that won't screw me out of flavor."
""
"I had this on draft at the houlihans in parsippany. I read the other reviews before ordering and thought I was getting more of a fruity beer. It's just a regular old pilsner. Certainly not bad but not anything to get excited about"
""
""
""
""
"Served on tap, almost no head.  Nice bitter finish and good feel.  I'll need to try this from the bottle."
""
""
""
"Outstanding session beer."

"Truly one of my favorite german pilsners. I've had it before and enjoyed it each time. This will continue to be  a go to beer for me!"
""
""
""
"Average. Better than your super mass produced but not as good as others."
""
"Smells sweet and floral.  Taste is initial sweetness quickly chased by bitterness.  Floral, spicy hops slightly overshadow the biscuity malt, but not by much.  Good carbonation, pleasantly prickly bubbles.  Finishes very clean.  Great for crushing in the summer, or as a breather among the heavy stouts in winter."

"Love this one no matter what the season. The hop taste is straight at ya, almost daring you to let it linger. When you do let it linger, the hops taste fades slowly and as the intensity dies down, ready for another swig."

"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass, this pils pours a lightly hazy yellow color with a decent white head and light lacing.  Nose of lightly sweet malt, spicy and bittering hops, and some yeast notes with a light grain background.  Flavors are sweet malt backbone to the fore and back with spicy hops and bittering hops rounding it all together.  Very nice carbonation keeps it lively and high on the ""session"" scale of drinkability.  Lightly bitter aftertaste with some grain background.  Good if you like your pils with a bittering hop background."

"O-Great beer. But, not my cup of tea."
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer, especially if you like hops.  My ideal German pils is a bit more bready and grassy...but I never say no to this beer."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding continental pils malt foundation with the crisp hop profile found across the pond. Awesome example of the style"
""
""
""
"Pours a pale almost clear yellow with a fizzy white head. The head settles down, taking on a nice creamy quality and adding a little sticky lacing. The aroma is distinct, with light bread notes, earthy and citrus hops. The taste is actually a little hop forward, dialing back the malt in favor of the two competing hops notes. The malt is more of a background note. It has a sharp crispness to it and some carbonation on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one is well executed and easy to drink"

"This is a solid pilsner. Crisp and refreshing. Nice hop character before a bready and malty finish. Super drinkable. Nice citrus and tangy profile in the nose."
""
""
""
""
"O:  the definitive american pilsner that will have good competitors but none cant beat.  Rating is based on american pilsner and not necessarily the foreign style.  Excellent!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tangy, clean and crisp pils."
""
""
"Taste starts out with the malt sweetness with a decent hop presence, hops are slightly more citrusy than the nose indicated yet still retain their grassiness, well balanced without any element being overly strong, very easy to drink, carbonation is medium with a body that is light yet not thin which is quite difficult to pull off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: awesome pilsner. Crisp and bright. Flavors are strong."
""
""

""
""
"Well carbonated, medium light body, refreshing, well made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Unlike Pilsner Urquell, it is a lot hoppier. Malt is about the same as PU, but the hops linger and eventually overpower the other flavors. Above average carbonation. About as light as you would expect from a Pislner, but it seems quirky because this level of hops is usually prominent in heavier beers."
"O: Was quite happy to stumble into this one (normally not carried anywhere near my area). Pretty refreshing and drinkable brew to help beat the heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is no hint of malt after the nose and there is no lasting dense head or lacing.   The bitterness is more than expected or wanted, probably too much for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is lightyears better than the last bottle of this I had.  That one was clearly off (always check bottle dates, and thank you Victory for having them).  Still, if the goal is a clear, crisp, easy-drinker, this is off the mark.  The hops on the finish are just too strong.  In terms of enjoyment, I'd put Mama's Lil' Yella and Summerfest (both Czech) ahead of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my go-to beers. Hoppy but not an IPA. Mellow but not a Budweiser. You can take it tailgating or to an oyster roast. Just an excellent, all-around beer."
""
"O:  Very good pilsner.  Should've had it colder, though."
""
""
""
"Everyone has different flavor filters. Mine says this: It's good. On the hoppy side for a pills for my liking. Pleasent earthy flavor. I liked it. Will drink again. I prefer Skrimshaw for an American Pills but this one shows up quite well with a meal. Refreshing and crisp."
""
""
""
"The best Pilsner that I have ever had!  The hops are perfect and finished very dry."

"O: I'll admit that I'm a few steps away from a pilsner hater. They're just not my thing and I've accepted that I'm not going to like every beer style. I picked up Prima Pils for two reasons, honestly. First off, my pop is a huge fan of pilsners and lagers and this is one of the most praised (American) German pils around. And secondly, Victory is a local brewery that offers several beers that I adore, so I felt obligated to at least entertain their pilsner offering. I'm almost reluctant to admit that I love this beer. It's not one of my dearly beloved IPAs or stouts, but this beer, quite frankly, is effin' delicious. It's light, yet flavorful. It's top-tier, yet available. And given that summer is only midway through, you can bet this will be the beer of choice in my family BBQ coolers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I am very pleased with this beer. I don't tend to like pilsner as much as other styles but this one got my attention. I wouldn't turn one down. Thankfully they are offered year round and Victory is located in the state I live in. Definitely bringing more of this home and it might make an appearance at my wedding in September."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"A good overall Pilsener. Smooth taste and easy drinking. Crisp taste with an overall light feeling to it. Ideal for a hot summer day. Not to nit-pick, but the price is a bit high compared to many other beers. Still, very enjoyable- I wouldn't turn on down!"
""
""
""
"o: Have to say I'm a bit disappointed with Prima especially after reading that it is among the absolute best in the style. Same as with Sierra Nevada Summerfest which is nice of course but also fails to impress me in any way. Certainly nothing bad to report but while interesting, also a little underwhelming at its price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Picked this up on a whim and was not disappointed. What I found here was a classic European pilsner done American style with a slightly amplified hop profile, though if I were to complain I'd say the malt profile was a bit lackluster. Still, you could do far worse if you're looking for a good American pilsner. This is the first brew I've reviewed from this brewery and I'm pretty impressed thus far. Cheers!"

"perfect summer after noon beer, definitely hits the beer spot. a victory for victory."
""
""
""
"Very light yellow.. clear see thru.. the nose is a sweet cracker, light skunk hop.. the taste follows with less sweetness and more of the skunk spice hop.. simple malt profile and balance of hops.. thin and prickly.. good pils though i have some slightly better."

"I randomly grabbed this one at the end of work a week ago and I have to say, I fell in love with it! Totally not at all what I expected in the best way possible! It pours thin and clear with a light golden tone and a tall foamy head. Smells very nice with a smooth citrus kick and a light piney undertone. I was completely surprised when I first tasted it! Its crisp and vibrant with a smooth tone of malts. I definitely tasted notes of pine and citrus from those hops! Altogether, its an amazing beer!"

"Like hop devil but a little less pine and bitterness. A pilsner by name but this isn't fooling anyone... its an IPA. Meh. Another highly rated beer completed. Won't be drinking many more of these bitter and piney beers. They just don't do it for me."
""
"Maybe the solution is to make a new beer style, the Märican Pils, defined as being super Noble hoppy and virtually no Pils malt sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Victory's Prima Pils arrests nearly all malt interaction, focusing heavily on the German noble hops and their delicate floral and herbal characteristics. Dry and balanced towards bitterness, Prima Pils is a crisp, refreshing beer that's hard not to gulp down and a stand-out among American-brewed pilsners."
""
""
"O: great Pilsner. Great balance with a great hop presence. Wish there was more aroma."
"Overall: Is this a good represetation of the style? It has more body and flavor than any other pilsner I've had, which is a good thing. Drinks more like a pale ale in my opinion. A solid choice for a summer beer. My favorite pils to date"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely suggest checking the ""born on"" date with this style of Victory beer as it does tend to flatten out as it ages with my expirences and is just not great when it looses that crispness."
"33cl bottle. ours clear, pale golden with small white airy head. Pure malt aroma and taste, hops kick in at the finish, providing nice bite. Pure and simple pilsner. Lots of bread and biscuit malt presence, simple clean hops on the tail end, nice clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an awesome meeting of lager and IPA. Done well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy Pilsner, like an IPA mated with a lager, what else can you say? Very hoppy somewhat creamy in the mouth. Hoppy smelling. Leaves a hop taste in your mouth. A bit of a palette wrecker but you can probably drink past it. Drink this after you're done with the serious drinking for the evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Maybe the six pack I bought was old, but if the beer actually left some lacing and actually had a head this would be an A beer for me. Overall I think it's a fantastic beer, great for the summer, and can't wait to buy more!"
""
""
""
"A great pilsner & definitely up there with some of the best of the style I have tried, in fact it could very possible be the best of the style I have tried. Don't pass up trying this one if you get the chance."
""
""
""
"O- One of the best Pilseners I've ever had, period."

"This has all the tell tale signs of a well crafted Pilsner. Whether it's the bright clean golden body or the heavy froth for a top, this Pilsner sets up well. The nose is bready with cracker and Pilsner malts. The flavor is strong yet light to feel as a cracker, bread, toast, cereal malt and a dash of hops glide across the tongue. This is what Pilsners all should be."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a solid offering and one I'll hit from time to time, but the extra-bitter bite is too floral for my pilsener-taste buds ... still, the fact that it's a bit different from most good German pilseners is a good thing, offering a bit of a change-up from the more classic noble-hop profile found in most of my favorite pilseners"

"I'll have to echo many of the other reviewers that this is certainly not a German Pils by any stretch of the imagination. It is however a SOLID offering from the always consistent Victory stable. I liken this to a consistancy of a Zwickel actually although it is not unfiltered is has a much more syrupy and hop forward flavor then a crisp and clear German Pils lager would. It is however highly sessionable and incredibly flavorful for a lager of its kind and I could put down a few of these easily on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this brew rocks! I enjoy the Gordon Biersch Czech Pils before attending Coyote hockey games and it has been a favorite until now! Seek this beer out if you are looking for a flavorful session brew!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid, sessionable, hop forward pilsener."
""
""
""
""
""
"Prima Pils is rather dark for the style, yet has a nice fluffy head when poured into a glass. What hits you first is the hop aroma. The taste is also hop-accented to the point that I cannot appreciate the malt body. I am not sure why dry hopping has invaded every beer style on the planet, since it was never intended for most of them. Prima pils is a solid American micro pilsener, but certainly not a ""German Pilsner"" as they say on their website. It is way too far out of balance. I taste great potential in this beer, but it lets me down in being just another blast of hops like a run of the mill west coast IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good German Pilsner and a great session beer. Will certainly become a regular in the warmer weather."
""
"The fact that this beer was a Pils after I tasted it was mind blowing. It definitely caught me off guard, but in a good, delicious ""I cant get enough of this beer"" type of way. Normal Pils don't taste as if they'll surprise you and that they all taste the same. Not this one. I'd buy this again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is not an ordinary run of the mill Pils. It presents some robust flavors with an aggressive hop profile for a pils and really stands out. Victory pumps out some good brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Prima Pils is really easy to drink yet there are subtleties to the beer that suggest this isn't a beer to be pounded, despite how easy one could do just that. There's a nice medley of sweet, bitter and yeasty all at play here and I enjoy it."

"Pours light golden color with thick, foamy head. Very strong, pleasing citrus aroma. Fruit filled taste with citrus, apples and pineapples. Mild hoppy bitterness. I prefer IPA type hoppiness and am not really a lager drinker, but this one doesn't disappoint. Probably the best lager/pilsner that I have tasted. Would definitely use as a session beer."
""
""

"This takes me back to the glory days of what Stella Artois was. Great traditional pilsner that takes you back. Thanks for breweries like Victory and the craft industry to bring back quality and great taste."

"O - Simply the best pilsner I have ever tasted. It's not only about what's there, but also about what's NOT there; no stale, skunky, or ""off"" flavors, just clean pilsner taste in a richer package than expected. I honestly can't imagine how it can be improved. When I want a pilsner, this is the beer I will be drinking."
""
""
"Overall- I was impressed. This was refreshing and very drinkable. The reason I was impressed was because the appearance had that of a lager, but did not taste like one. Had a nice amount of complexity as well. True to the fact that Victory is a maker of great beers. Prima Pils has a lot of flavor, give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beautiful pour with light honeyed color, thick creamy head, and just a suggestion of haze. Nose is very appetizing with some herbal, leafy hop qualities and a hint of bready/grainy aromas. Palate offers a whollop of flavors with ample hoppiness coming through, herbal and pleasantly sharp, with some nice malt in the background to tame things just a little. Incredibly flavorful yet drinkable at the same time. A masterpiece of a pils when judged against the American competition. Bravo."

"O: Very flavorful for a pilsner. Truly a great pilsner if you're into hoppy beers. Personally, I found the intensity of the hops and floral notes off-putting and not really justified by the style. So its not my favorite beer but if that's what you're into, by all means have a few!"

"Victory Prima Pils ---4/5."
"I'd say it should be considered a best of the best in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste begins with a notable grainy malt character with a dry yet citrus-like bitterness hanging on at the finish. Really clean finish too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an outstanding German pils. Although I must admit to a sweet spot in my heart for this style, this one is an exceptional example that hits all the notes one would expect from a world-class lager. I wish there were a local option in this style as good as this one for me to support. This is my favorite offering from the short list of Victory brews I've had to date."

""

"O: Great great pilsener definitely world class. Over-hopped and fantastic."
""
""
""
"The aroma is definitely more interesting, bringing some toasty tones, as well as the taste. The hop presence is relatively (to the style) shy in the beginning, but at the end they show up with vigor. This is a good german pilsener, pretty perfect for new england summers."
""
""
""
"But light and I could enjoy it everytime I drink beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Reviewed again March, 2015. Fresher, crisper aroma and flavor (while still maintaining the strong hope flavor reminiscent of German pilsners, but with an American twist). Better than I recall/ remember, perhaps the best German-style pilsner in America?"
""
""
"This is one of the most highly regarded American made Pilsners out there. I'm doing a re-review of this one. I've revisited this beer 2-3 times over the last year and although my pallet is more tolerable of hop bombed double IPAs and such, it has lost its tolerance for this over-hopped and bitter pilsner. I just don't find this beer refreshing nor easy to drink, both of which is a mandatory requirement IMO for this style of beer. I still respect it to some regards but there are several other pilsners now that I would prefer over this hop bombed pils."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad but I'm not crazy about it. Really not a beer I would go for again unless I'm stuck between this and a bunch of PAs and IPAs."
""
""
"I have recommended this to a few die hard pale ale friends because it is a little more refreshing and they all keep it in the fridge now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- drinkable and not too filling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. It looks like the internet suggests that this gem has an IBU in the low-to-mid forties. This is not unlike hoppier German pilseners from Germany, such as Jever, Waldhaus, Alpirsbacher, or Rothaus. Rothaus Pils (Tannenzäpfle) is one of my favorite all-time beers, so that this beer comes close is extremely exciting. A fantastic brew, and one I am planning on buying in greater quantities. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is crisp, snappy and refreshing. Worth checking out but there are other examples in the style I would choose over this one if given the opportunity...prime example being any of Victory's braumeister pils offerings."
""
""
""
"O- This is one of my favorite beers and something I love to have with food. It is crisp, and refreshing and not too heavy. It reminds me very much of the European pilsners but without the skunkiness and corn flavors that you usually find in those. I bet much of that has to do with it being an American brew and can find it very fresh. I wish more places had this on tap so maybe Bud drinkers would give it a shot."
"The Victory Prima Pils is the perfect pilsner. It has a great full bodied pilsner taste with a load of hops to make this a dynamic taste experience. It poured a light golden color with a full creamy head. The first taste was reminiscent of many of the hoppy IPAs I have been having lately but there is enough of the signature German pilsner flavor to keep it well within the style. I had this on a hot afternoon and it was light enough to tame the heat and the dynamic hoppy bitterness kept me coming back for more. One of my favorite pilsners."

"Overall a great pilsner with tremendous flavor without any odd aftertaste like some skunky beers have."
"Great beer! Not overpowering. Golden appearance, with a clean finish and very refreshing. Definitely not too sweet/not too much alcohol content. The hops are just right - present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is extraordinary - big, clear crisp carbonation that isn't fizzy and feels just right. I could see this being one of my standards - especially in the summer. One of my favorite beers."
"Paired this with camembert, fontina, and gouda. Really nice for end of summer. Absolutely refreshing. Straightforward, with an edge of orange. Really outstanding with the creamy camembert. Would recommend as a stand-alone or accompaniment to a sophisticated dinner first course."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a refreshing beer that is extremely drinkable and does what it sets out to do quite well."
""
""
""
"O - My review may not seem to show how much I enjoy this Pilsener. It is a very nice take on the style. I decided to give it a try when the temps soared into the 90's and I was happy to have it to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Extremely drinkable beer, yet there is nothing that blows me away. I'll admit, however, that I'm not a huge fan of lighter lagers like this. But it does what it's supposed to do very well."
""
"O - I'm an IPA guy, but I used to be a pilsner guy who thought Amstel was good. That being said, this is possibly the best pilsner out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really well done."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: So far my favorite of the style."
""
""
"O--Another win for Victory. This stuff is 1.)Excellent for its style and 2.) just freaking excellent, regardless of style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best pilsners I have tried. That being said I haven't had a lot. I'm fairly new to the lager scene in general. That being said this will easily always have a spot in my fridge."
""
""
"Finally got around to trying this well-renowned brew. Pours a light straw color with a foamy white head. Aroma is very fresh, spicy, and hoppy. The taste of noble hops is really the first thing that hits you upon first sip -- slightly spicy/piney, a little bit of malt -- just really well-balanced and solid. Very easy to drink. A nice crisp beer for a hot summer day or an early fall night."
""
""
""
"This beer was not undrinkable, but very hoppy for a pilsner. I didn't hate it but I would not but it again. If you like IPA's this might be up your alley. This beer is to Pilsner what IPA is to Pale ale. I didn't get enough balance of malt, in fact the hops kind of drowned out the flavors of the pilsner malts in this one. The final reason I didnt rate this beer higher was the ABV. Pilsner is a summer beer and I prefer a lower alcohol Pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Admittedly, I am not a huge fan of the pilsner style, but if I could get more that tasted like this my opinion could change in a hurry. I could drink this all day."

"A very nice example of an American take on the German pilsner style. Delicious, refreshing and not expensive. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good, easy to find lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The pilsner style can be known for its sharp herbal hop bitterness, but this one pushes the envelope further than most. Not sure what we're looking at for IBUs, but the perceived bitterness is very high. This is easily the biggest, boldest pilsner I've come across (discounting some ridiculous 'imperial' pilsners). It's damn tasty, and the bite really wakes up the drinker, like in old movies when someone smacks a hysterical person in the face and yells ""Snap out of it!"" "Thanks, I needed that," would be my reply. Pairing options are interesting. Perhaps a fishy ceviche, or some herbal Mediterranean dishes. Spicy Italian sausage is a no-brainer."
"Overall, this one is up there on my list and I'm not a pils drinker. This will be my go to for grilling from now on. Refreshing and very drinkable, but with lots of character. I thought Sam Adams Noble Pils was as good as it got. It was wrong!!"

"By miles and miles my all-time favorite Pils - an admittedly short list, but this is my American champ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. Look and aroma are classic pilsner. Golden straw color with bright fresh smell. Taste is classic pils as well. Very balanced, not too dry, not too crisp, not too hoppy, etc. Doesn't break the mold but rather perfectly recreates a classic pilsner experience."
"O - This compares favorably against the best pilseners I've ever tasted. Granted my experience is limited at this point, but I see this being among my favorites for a long time to come."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is of medium weight, with low to medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a beer that softly, gradually foams up on the palate, then quickly settles to a smooth and slightly placid existence as it moves across the tongue. Never watery, but a bit more carbonation would suit this beer nicely. Closes very dry, with light stickiness remaining on the palate."
"Taste similar to a porter with 159 calories per bottle at 5.3% ABV. Not a fan of this similar porter style taste. The aftertaste is strong/bold, a bit better than the average. You can taste the hops and malt strong and it has the heavy feel of a Guinness with less calories. This pilsner is good but not for me."

"O - I'm a huge pilsener and lager fan, and this is up there with the best I've sampled. So much flavor going on for a pilsener, yet still sessionable and easy on the throat and stomach. Highly recommend this brew to any pilsener/lager fans, or anyone that is looking for an easy drinking beer with lot's of great flavor."
""
""
""
"A hoppy pilsner with character and superb flavor, in my opinion superior to most German and Czech pilsners. Far from boring, which is generally a challenge for pilsners. Actually, I don’t remember having a better pilsner. Highly recommendable."

""
""
"o- for a pilsner for which I rarely drink, I enjoyed this beer immensely, another great job by victory."
""
"A well made Pils with a lot of balance between all elements, with hoppiness matching of exceeding the classic fresh style. A very positive experience--one of the better Pilsners in my memory."

"Pours straw gold with an orange undertone. Slight citrus nose, little yeast with a respectable bit of malt behind it. Some haze. Looks and smells delightful. I did not pour a head but the lacing shows good retention. Hugs the glass like it’s in love. The taste is grassy hops with a distinct oily bitterness. Good malt spine, medium body, medium carbonation. A little lemon and a dry finish. Good example of a classic pils. Substantial hops, engaging aftertaste."

"overall: Between this and Staropramen from Prague, these are my two favorite pilsners. They do the style right, and have the flavor and fullness that the american macros pretend to have. THis is a quality session beer that I could never get sick of. Also, enough hops to satisfy the curiosity of a hophead like myself who normally doesn't buy pilsners. Good job Victory."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This has always been one of my favorite pilsners. A little hoppier than more traditional examples, which is what makes it so tasty. This is a staple in my fridge during the summer months and a go to anytime I'm craving a nice solid pils."

"Aroma & Taste: Had a nice hoppy nose to it, lots of herbs hop notes. Had a bitter, dry, hoppy finish. Finished quick but had a lingering bitterness to it. Slight note of honey, that I really enjoyed."
""
"The Prima Pils from Victory Brewing Company was a pleasant surprise. The beer had a light yellow appearance. It had a smell full of hops and floral notes. The beer had a lighter body mouth feel. The taste was light and earthy with hints of hops. This was a very nice Pilsner."
""
"The Victory Prima had an appearance of yellow coloring and smelled of citrus and freshness which I liked in a beer. However, when I tried it, i thought it tasted very bitter and hoppy. Although I did like the freshness and after taste once you tasted the beer."

"M- perfect for style, not too thick but still foodlike, leaving a lingering taste."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a straw yellow that is semi-translucent and a fluffy white head. Smells of sweet barley and slight floral aroma. Tastes of light grain body with slight floral hop bite. This beer is carbonated heavily, but not overly so, and goes down very smoothly with its light body. Overall, a superb beer."
""
""
"A wonderful anytime beer - and a more heavily hopped pilsner. Good drinkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can't be too style-specific here (outside of my own expectations for the style), as this is the only German pilsener I've ever had. As a beer in general, I found it to be quite refreshing, crisp, and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I'm an IPA lover but I could learn to love this, pils isn't too far from an IPA."

"O - A definite must-try for anyone. Can't wait to have it again!"
""
""
""

"I remember first getting into craft beer; the hop shiv that you get thrust into your mouth right away on this one was off-putting. Almost like a lighter IPA on the palate. Not a whole lot of malt going on here, but it's crisp, dry and all about the bitter citrus bite. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer. Probably my favorite pilsner. Deep flavor with a great finish, my only down is it's smell is not real strong. Then again, I'm really an IPA guy, so I like the strong bite of good hops, but this beer is really good. On a fresh pour, CO2 rolls like a New England snowstorm and holds a nice firm foam head."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a darker gold with a nice fluffy white head. Head retention is good, and the lacing is nice to look at. It smells very hoppy for a pilsner, which is no problem for me. some citrus and floral notes are detectable. The taste shows some light malt up front with lemon peel, but then a sharp hoppy bitterness takes over. It has a light crisp mouthfeel with aggressive carbonation. It's light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel: Crisp medium body with light carbonation. Finish is very long and dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best before 3/1/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, floral, grass, cracker, pepper, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with a good balance of hops and fruity lager esters. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, apple, pear, pepper, pine, floral, grass, cracker, bread, hop earthiness, and floral spiciness. Good amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, pepper, grass, cracker, bread, hop earthiness, and floral spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; with a very hoppy flavor profile; and nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Pilsner style. Great hoppy flavor balance with good complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"As good as it is, it still doesn't blow my mind. I don't really have it miles ahead of other pilsners like other reviewers have. Still highly recommended though."

"Overall- I maybe shouldn't have tasted this before work, The hops really stick around. Its tasty but I think that lagunitas does a better hoppy pils( with more booze) and over all I really like the Oskar Blues little yellow Pils but this one sure seems authentic and is a definite contender!"

"O-Its January, but the sun is out, so I figured I would break up the stout/strong ale parade with a pils, and this was a good choice. It wasn't the best beer I have tasted, probably not even close to the best pils I have tasted, but the little hoppy kick keeps this from feeling like just another light, fizzy beer. I would reach for this again as the weather warms or anytime I need a break from the stronger brews that I tend to gravitate towards."

"Overall, easy drinking but flavourful. I am not a pilsner fan, and my score probably reflects that, but this strikes me as quite a good presentation of the style."

"Best example of a pilsner I've had in a while, though the hops are over the top. But that's good for my personal preference."
"Burst of spicy-herbal hops up front, but it's not overwhelming. Sweet pale malts, bready, biscuity, a little grassy. Finish is peppery, crisp, semi-dry. Body is light, very refreshing, lively carbonated, highly drinkable."

"Pours light gold color with a very slight haze and a head with rather large bubbles. Strong earthy, spicy hops, and distinct bread crust in the aroma. The hops dominate the flavor profile, with a very light honey sweetness and bread flavor from the malt. Finishes dry and bitter with plenty of earthy, spicy hops. Light bodied with carbonation on the loose side."
""

"O- A good pils, very good example of the style."

"This one surprised me. I didn't expect this one to be as good as it was. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pilsner flute, it appears a pale and hazy straw with a nice head, excellent retention, and elaborate lacing. The nose is very subtle, but it is very floral and nice. Taste is nice with an initial neutral taste, not too sweet, not to bitter, but finishes with an assertive bitterness leaving a fairly nice aftertaste. Recommended!!!!"

""
""
""
""
"O: A great, well-rounded pilsener with some big hop presence while also retaining the crisp, refreshing feel of a pils lager."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A truly epic lager, an absolutely huge noble hop character that has gone unrivaled by anything past my taste buds. The balance is way off, and many will find it off-putting, but if hops and sessionability are what you want, then this will do the trick. It makes an excellent change of flavor for any of you who want an overly hopped beer that has a totally unique character."

""
""
"I'm obviously not a pils guy, but this one's not too bad, and it's seen quite often in bottles and on tap. Clear golden-yellow pour, with a bubbly white head that recedes to a thin layer, leaving a bit of lacing behind. Floral hops on the nose, grainy. No surprises here. Taste of pils malts, grains, biscuity, light and crisp, floral hops with a touch of citrus zest, fairly bitter and drying. Light body, pretty easily drinkable for the style, but overall just not my thing."

"a great year round beer, and an excellent pilsner."
"Overall, a nicely balanced, refreshing brew. On the hoppy side for a pilsner, but that's not a bad thing. Comparable to a malty American Pale Ale. An asset to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The overall smoothness of this beer caught me by surprise. BMC beers tend to give Pilseners a bad name, but Prima Pils definitely restores that style to how it aught to be considered. Would I drink it again? It's likely, at 5.3% ABV it's even sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A light copper colored and well carbonated brew. Prima pils has a wonderful hop aroma very enticing. The hops flavors are very noticeable and at the forefront of this beer. I think that this beer is almost too carbonated which detracts from the mouth feel in my opinion. For this style I would appreciate a little less carbonation in order for the beer to flow more smoothly. A crisp dry finish makes the perfect end for this brew."
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice refreshing, bitter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Due to the hops usage here, I suspect if I try every other example of this style, I'd still come back to this one as my tops. Rich for what it is. And excellent."
"Great beer for the style. Nice, crisp and bitter. Perfect for watching some college football after mowing the grass."
""
""

"Overall an enjoyable pilsner."

"Pours a mostly clear goldenrod color with a bubbly white head. Scent is mild with hops, wheat, yeast, and hints of citrus. The taste is initially a sweet wheat tone that turns wet and slightly dry on the palette. Texture is smooth and refreshing as the beer is fairly complex for a pilsner. Leaves a slight chalky after taste. Not bad at all."

"Victory Brewing makes many fine products and Prima Pils is one of the finest. I find myself sipping, evaluating, and continuing to find more and more complex flavors. Everything from the initial sip through the aftertaste is memorable and quite remarkable. Try a Prima Pils for yourself, and see what you think."

"This is hands down the best German Pilsner in the business.A wonderful clean and refreshing brew that can be drunk all day and a great pairing for many types of food. The hotter it gets outside the better the beer tastes gong down.Although Victory makes many great brews this is their flagship brew in my opinion.In my opinion the best session beer out there."

"Pours a slightly clouded straw gold with minimal head that falls to nothing. Nose is a matured and subdued lemon.Flavor is slightly citrus like with a smooth and slightly heavily bodied character that comes off as earthy and leaves a high amount of ink in the mouth. Consistent flavor delivery never drops off; just fades away over time. Very drinkable, though might be a bit too hearty for some."

"Pours a clear golden straw color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is grassy with a hint of lemon at first. A good amount of hops for a pilsner. Slight german malt aroma. A bit of grain as well. Nice smell for a pilsner. Taste is very lemony at first with some subtle hoppiness...which immediately turns to a good amount of hoppiness. Grassy hops with some nice German malt flavor with crisp, earthy flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied and refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is very tasty for this style. Not my particularly favorite style, but this is one of my favorites when it comes to this genre."

"O- Just about the finest domestic example of an German Pilsner I've come across, it's got the assertive hoppiness I enjoy and it's light enough to drink in quantity. Well done, Victory."
"A nice crisp, clean, and refreshing pilsner from Victory. They have done a good job staying true to the traditional pilsner style while putting their own tweak on it giving it a little bit more of a kick, the beer seeming a bit more robust than a traditional German-style pilsner which is what they seem to be trying to emulate. Well done."
"Final words. Try this beer if you like IPA's. You may just find the lager you've been looking for. You get the hoppiness of a good IPA with the great head of a true pils. Taken in this regard, you'll find much to enjoy, just don't judge it as a pils."

"O - excellent American take on a pilsner. This is one of my summer go too beers. It is just flavorful and refreshing. A good times kind of lager."
""
""
"Really very good. I went into the liquor store yesterday (Choice Mart on Mass. Ave.) and spent some time perusing their selection – dece for a liquor store. In the end I came away with a sixer of Prima – nothing exotic, just hits the spot on a hot summer day."
"This was an ok beer, Nothing special. I don't think I'll buy this beer again. It's a little too bitter, and not refreshing enough for me to warrant keeping this around."

"Very clean and smooth tasting with the typical true pilsner aftertaste. Starts sweet and bready, finishes dry and bitter. This beer did not really stick out for me, but looking at the reviews a lot of people really enjoyed it"
"Floral bready aroma. Similar in the flavor. Refreshing and crisp, but not thin or overcarbed. Unexpectedly high bitterness is delicious and smooth and lingers pleasantly. Only criticism might be that the level of hop flavor verges on soapiness, but it is still better than the typical lack of flavor you expect in a pils."

"Possibly my favorite domestic pilsner, and one of my favorite domestic lagers. One of the best finishing beers I've ever had. Great stuff. 4.0"

"Wow this really is an amazing beer. It is extremely refreshing and an awesome thirst quencher. The bitterness might be a little high for a pilsener but it works very well in this beer. This will become a regular in my fridge."
"O: Pleasant, maybe a go to beer in the summer but I can't see myself searching it out again. As far as the style goes, its easily the best I've had."
"O - This is not a style I traditionally enjoy but this is the best I have ha in the class. I can easily see what the hype is about and certainly would not turn one down."
"O - I like enough to make it part of my beer rotation. It's refreshing, has a lowish ABV but also has a lot of flavor, especially the bright lemon citrus and dry, spicy finish. Bolder than a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (another one in my regular rotation) but not quite as well balanced. I like this better than the Sierra Nevada Summerfest or the Stoudts Pils after tasting them side-by-side. Also, while this has a 1% higher ABV than my #1 session beer, 21st Amendment's Bitter American, as of late, this is capturing a bigger portion of my beer budget than in previous years. Really good stuff."
"o - goes down easy with plenty of flavor, but i'd like a little more malt balance. a good fit for a hot spring/summer afternoon, though probably not a beer i'd buy often."
""
"A nice distinct pilsner. I have had a few in recent days and this one definitely tastes different. I can see why it's rated so highly in its' category. I wish I could taste just a bit more of the malt and was just a bit more carbonated, but that is my only gripe here."

"This German Pilsner pours a brilliant straw color with a bubbly white head that provides plenty of lacing. Grainy pils malt, lemon, and some floral and spicy hop character forms a very appealing bouquet of aromas. Bready malt and some sweetness blends beautifully into crisp hop bitterness, with some lemon and honey detected as well. Crisp and clean, this amazing Pils is lighter in body, and features a moderate level of carbonation."
""
""
"O- A great pilsner that is highly drinkable. Sometimes this is not the most interesting style, but this is just a great everyday beer."
""
""
""
"I wonder how i'd feel if this beer went by a different name, maybe just Victory Prima. perhaps I'd be more open to liking it, but as it's currently named and marketed, it's a bastardization of the style."

""
"D: Goes down better than most beer - isn't overly rich at all, and would make a great (temporary) friend on a hot day!"

""
""
"Overall: A fine example of a pilsener. If only Budweiser drinkers knew what they were missing."
""
"O: Drinkability is very good."
""
"Overall: This is a very refreshing beer and great example of the style. Floral hops dominate with grainy malt undertones. Crisp and refreshing. We're very fortunate to have such a high quality German Pilsner available fresh on the east coast!"
""
"O: This is a great beer for the style and nice because a little bit more of the hoppiness comes through than some others. Extremely easy to drink and very enjoyable - I could and will drink several of these in a session. I'm going to have to go pick me up some more of this at some point soon."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best buy July 20, 2012. Pours a straw yellow with a two inch fluffy white head, lots of lace everywhere. Smell is grass, biscuit, pepper, and citrus. Taste is all those things, with a peppery grass beginning and actually a hit of lemon in the finish. Taste is way more aggressive than the smell. Body is medium for the style, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is a very good pilsner, but didn't live up to my very high expectations."

"Light-bodied, fizzy and ridiculously easy to drink. Crisp, just a little creamy. This is pretty much as good as people will generally tell you it is. The embodiment of Summer. You shuck some oysters, I'll go buy some more."
"O - This is a very well made pilsner targeted at people who appreciate hop bitterness. The other elements of the beer are lovely. I think this beer would be fantastic without so much bitterness at the end of the swallow - just a bit more balance. The bitterness does give it some identity, but I don't think it would blend in with every other pilsner if it lacked it; its floral nature and accompanying sweetness are bewitching all by themselves. I'd give it a 4.5 on taste if it weren't for the overbitterness. So instead it's a 4. I'd give it a 4.5 overall if not for the bitterness, so instead it's a 4. Clearly this is subjective to a nonhopper."

"Overall: This is a really nice pils. Light and easy to drink, I'm a big fan."

"Prima Pils pours perfect golden light yellow with a great off-white head. Plenty of hops thoughout the nose and with each sip. Super dry and crisp with plenty of carbonation and hop zip. It is such a great thirst quencher, a great apertif, a great beer...period! Jever was the inspriation for this beer and it shows. Jever would be proud."
"Smooth, full-bodied for the style with a gentle, flowing effervescence that doesn't take away from the flavor, it enhances it. If MillBudCoors could make a beer taste this good instead of the bitter dreck they currently make, I'd drink it."

"This is a very bold and flavorful german style pils. Lots of hops throughout the flavor and aroma, and quite bitter. Decadent for the style, even. But VERY good. Probably more of a hop-head's pils rather than an every man's pils. Very well crafted and tasty."
""
""
""

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy light orange-yellow amber. Half finger fine white head with moderate retention and lacing. Light aroma of sweet malt, hay, faint hops. Taste is sweet malt, a hint of citrus, dry grassy flavor. Blends nicely into a hoppy finish leaving a pleasant hoppy malt aftertaste. Medium bodied. Not very complex, but nice flavor progression and integration. A very nicely done pilsner."
"O: If you’ve read this far, you won’t be surprised to find that I really enjoyed this beer. Good color, the aromas were enticing, and the taste was quite good, with well-balanced flavors. Mouthfeel was on point, and this is one that you can enjoy with a multitude of activities. It’s really good with fried chicken, by the way. Cheers."
"Unfortunately though the beer just kind of drinks like a hopped up light beer. Light and fizzy with a big bitter finish. The lack of any sort of balance ruins the drinkability that a pilsner should have. Good if your hop lover but not as good as I expected."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is interesting- not as quaffable as other pilseners, but certainly lively. Light body, moderately carbonated, the finish is pretty, pretty dry."

"First of all this is not a german pilsner, its more comparable to really awful American IPA. Really damn carbonated and looks like dehydrated piss with seltzer water. Taste was a watery carbonated bud light with hops. And the combination is the least satisfying. Definitely letting all the ""Pros"" that rated this beer so highly share this hillbilly beer to their families because I will definitely not be."
"O: Really good refreshing pilsner. Can't wait to drink this during the summertime on the beach. A session beer for sure. Reccommended."

"On of the better pilsners that I have ever had though, admittedly, I am not a big fan of the style."
""
""
"Taste and feels: amazing. I think they should have an American Pilsener style created based off of this wonderful take on the central European classic. It's much more hop-forward with a crisp bitterness that almost steals the show, as compared to German or Czech styles. So fresh feeling. Lemon-like acidity and citrus combines terrifically with the crackery/grain/bread malt --malt is very delicate as compared to bready backbones in other styles. Drinkability is off the charts. This is my go-to ""light beer", but it's never short on full flavor."

"An excellent example of a German Pilsener and a very enjoyable beer. I think it's very important to serve this at the right temperature. Straight out of the fridge it was all hops and bitterness. After a few minutes it was a lovely balance and a few more minutes and it started to take a less pleasant, boozy edge."

"Have always appreciated Victory beers and prima is no different. This is one of more favorite pilsners they have. Its a perfect example of an America pilsner. The hops are big and floral on the nose, with more malt in the mouth playing alongside the notes of fresh citrus. It is very smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation and low alcohol. I'd say there is a soft bitterness that is followed through the long finish and closes on a sweet hop taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"so so so crisp. an awesomely refreshing beer when you just need a beer. pours s unshiney yellow colow with lots of carbonation and rising head. smells very well balanced, with noticable malts and hops in the nose. taste is quite complex for a pilsner, and more hoppy than most ive tried. could almost be a pale ale, except for the lighter malts and mouthfeel. this is freakishly sessionable and ont of the only pilsners i consistently choose to purchase and drink. also one of the few pilsners that truly excited me. if you are in the same boat pick this one up"

"Pours a hazy straw color with a two finger head. You can see tons and tons of bubbles rising to the top. Aroma is fresh cut grass and lemon. Smells extremely refreshing. Taste is spot on. Nice grassiness and biscuity malts here. Very easy drinking. Overall, the perfect lawnmower beer. Just a wonderful pils. Nice and crisp and perfect for a hot Florida day."
"O - Victory's Prima Pils is the best American-made pilsner I've ever had. It's crisp, flavorful and well-crafted that is light years beyond the fizzy macros that claim to have true pilsner taste. Highly recommended!"

""
""

"The Rest: Medium bodied and a more assertive bitterness than your run of the mill Pils, this is another good offering from Victory."

"Pours a light hazy straw color with a 1/4 inch head. Very crisp taste with some slightly spicy notes. Mouthfeel is good and not under carbonated.

"O: This is a very well crafted Pilsner from an American craft brewery. It's as drinkable as any, but never sacrifices on flavor that you get with lesser, macro versions."
"O: ive heard so much about how great this beer is and i couldn't figure it out until the taste, smell was good not great as was the appearance but that taste blew me away, so complex and crisp for the style, just really extraordinary"
"o - Overall a nice, above average pilsener, thought not my favorite pilsener or Victory beer. The floral and sweet notes and help it a lot, and it is very easy to drink. Would have it again and a good springtime beer."
"Overall: you will find Prima Pils in the dictionary next to drinkability, my favorite beer to session, love it"
"O- A simple easy drinking pilsner and one of my favorite pilsners. just all around a tasty beer."
"o - want more now! this is as good a pilsener as i've ever head."
"O-a very nice drinking pilsener"
"Nice moderately-light body, could use more carbonation though."
"O - I could, and have, drank this all day. Between the low ABV and the simple flavors it is extremely drinkable. It remains one of my go to beers when I am at a place with questionable beer selection."
"Look and feel is definitely one of a German Pilsner. The taste is very smooth, creamy and balanced. There aren’t any off-putting notes like stinkiness or bitterness. Very subtle flavors keep coming out through the mouthfeel. Very easy drinking, doesn’t leave you wanting more. Definitely something you should experience to see what a true pilsner should taste like."
"O: Not my favorite style at first, however this beer was good. I can definitely appreciate what they were trying to do here."
"O- Finally a pilsner that I enjoy!"
"O - a pils for hop-heads; this one is more hoppy than most pale ales."
"Overall - I would consider this among some of my preferred session beers. This is also pretty high up on my list of favorite pilsners. Very well done, Victory!"
"Victory Pils available at the Boulevard in J'Town, PA. The beer's appearance is clear golden color with decent white head and carbonation which led to a good lace. The smell was typical of hay, barley and hint of hop. The flavor is dry strong presence of saaz hops. Mouthfeel is very good...there is enough flavor to keep the beer interesting and tasty. Great for sessioning. Overall it is a very good pilsner."
"Highly recommended."
"This beer has a hoppy enough taste that one might confuse it with an india pale ale. Ignoring that aspect, the quality and flavor are top-notch and it is hard to think of a better variety that is on the market. The problem is that it appears to be one of several newer twists on the tradition of brews that originate in the Czech crown lands of Bohemia: it attempts to redefine pilsner by marrying it to something characterized by an abundance of hops."
"Definitely an enjoyable pilsener. If it was available at a similar price point to Noble Pils, I'd probably opt for it because of the bittering hops. Unfortunately, it's rather overpriced in Australia for what it is."
"The Prima has a full body but not too much - leaves the mouth well hopped"
"Bravo!"
"T: This is right up there at the head of the class for this style. Another gem from a six-pack mixer."
"O - Big and bold for a pilsner. An excellent easy drinker."
"Well constructed and with definite charisma. Personally I find the Saaz-fest just a bit domineering by the end."
"Victory Prima Pils: I usually stick with Colorado breweries. Given that I have Odell’s, Great Divide, Breckenridge, and New Belgium to choose from, just to name a few, I will be hard pressed to sample all of their offerings in any reasonable time period, but it will be fun! So it was a 12 pack of three different Victory beers on a good sale that tempted me to go outside of Colorado. The Prima Pils pours with a clear sunshine yellow body and white even head. The head lasts, but does not lace. The aroma lets you know that some bitter is coming, and it does. While there is an underlying carpet of sweet malt, it is piled high with a dry bitter flavor, from start to finish. I did like this beer; it goes down well and has a balance to it. Better with food than for sipping alone."
"O: What a great pilsner! Now I know why it’s so esteemed by beer lovers. Victory has the right idea here – European flavor with a uniquely American element. This is my new favorite session beer."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp, dry. Overall, one of my favorite pilsners, like I said."
"Overall, a top class craft beer for summer, even if it officially ends tomorrow. True to style and brewed incredibly well, another great beer from Victory."
"O: Makes a statement, but kind of a crass one. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
"Pours a clear pale golden straw hue which leaves a one finger head that settles to heaps of islands of froth and clingy lacing,the smell is fresh cut oranges,herbal hops and golden caramel,the mouthfeel is light bodied almost perfect for style with tastes of freshly cut oranges,lemon zest,pale golden malts,toffee and finished with a boiled candy sweet dryness and overall a very pleasant pilsner that would buy again and look forwards to trying on a nice hot spring day instead of a cold night like tonight cheers."
"Overall, although this bottle was only about a week away from the end of its suggested 'best before"" date, it still provided a bright yet earthy flavor profile that was a bit unexpected but quite nice. I'll have to keep my eye out for a fresher sample, though, to get the full effect of this renowned pilsener."
"poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass. a wonderful little beer with a nice fluffy head and light yellow appearance . aroma of the hops is the main presents. taste is wonder but a tad bitter. for me this is another top notch beer from the people at victory."
"A really beautiful beer with the hop character adding crispness to an otherwise typical German style Pilsner. Really nice."
"Overall: While I can't say that this is my favorite beer it is a great representation of the style and I don't really have many complaints. One that I'd recommend to others looking into this style"
"This beer pours a clear pale yellow with minimal head and no lace. The aroma is of citrus and floral hops. The flavor is very bland with a hint of sour lemon. There is a very strong hop bitterness that lasts past the finish leaving an unpleasantly bitter aftertaste. It has a thin mouthfeel. Victory Prima Pils is a disappointing beer, way too bitter for the German pilsner style, more like an American IPA. Not recommended!"
"Overall: Fantastic. One of the best Pilseners I have ever had. Will definitely buy this one again."
"Excellent Germanic pilsner; perhaps a bit heavier on the hop finish compared to the traditional example, but the drier finish only invites another glass to further quench the thirst. Delicious."
"D-This isn't my favorite example of the style, but it's definitely a decent beer. I need to try this one again a little fresher and see if the results are the same."
"Overall: Its been said before, this is one of the best American pils out there. If I absolutely had to pick a single beer to drink all summer long it would almost certainly be Prima Pils!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. I'm glad I picked up this bottle to try."
"A solid, sessionable beer that is mostly subtle except for the finishing bitterness."
"Overall – This beer shows that the American Craft Brew industry can brew an excellent German Pilsner. It seems that everybody is trying to brew an IPA with 100+ IBU just to enjoy the flavor of hops. Instead they should explore the other end of the spectrum with a German Pilsner."
"This is my go to beer for the near future."
"Overall a very nice pilsner"
"D/O: This bold contribution sets the bar for American craft-brewed pilsner lagers. It leaves no doubt in the mind of the drinker regarding its all-malt pedigree, while also giving a clinic on Noble hop flavors and aromas. While authentic, the flavors struggle to match the smell in intensity. It would seem peerless, if not for the existence of Green Flash's Fizzy Yellow beer."
"This is a hell of a great pilsener, even though it pushes the style envelope for boldness and nose aggression, I love it all the more for it!"
"delicious, pilsy. if the body was a bit less chewy for the style, it would probably be a home run for me. but every time I grab a bottle, I'm always hoping for a bit less. not that it's bad. in fact, it's still one of the best german style pilsners around."
"Overall: Beers like this remind me why Pilsner is one of my favorite styles. I am really glad an American brewery is making a Pilsner this good. Very recommended."
"This is a splendid go-to pilsner beer. A shimmering gold, a remarkable piney personality, elements of citrus, notes of grain. This beer is Bright (with a capital ""B"). Whether you are quenching a thirst or sharing it with one whom you love on a summer's dusk, go for a Prima Pils; It won't knock your socks off, but it will satisfy that pilsner craving."
"O - If you have ever been scared away from German Pilseners, or Pils in general seek this one out, you will be quite fond as I was."
"Great beer, easily the best I've had from Victory. At my stage in the craft beer game, I should've tried this beer a long time ago. Shame on me for taking this long to try this beer. This is definitely in my top two favorite pilseners I've had to date, maybe the best. It doesn't really get much better for the style. This beer is an eye opener! Recommended to anyone."
"Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. The body is easy-drinking and refreshing. The carbonation is not overly apparent but just enough to help this beer's drinkability. The dryness at the end of the taste beckons another sip."
"O: Here's the deal... this is a good to great beer for the style. I would come back to this day in and day out for a drinkable summer beer. It's very refreshing. However in the grand scheme of beers, this is more on the good level. Absolutely worth a try though."
"Still, it's a nice light to medium bodied beer that's one of the tops of its style, it's got great carbonation, and it came from my mom. How could it not be good?"
"Overall= Only picked up two of these but I could definitely see this being a session beer. Only other Pils I've ever enjoyed this much is Pilsner Urquell. Miller Lite should be banned from calling their beer ""Pilsner"" Another solid offering from Victory."
"This is a lighter Summer-style brew that doesn't disappoint. Superior!"
"Crisp and flavorful, the beer equivalent of biting into a cold apple. This pilsner boasts lovely light Grape Nuts cereal flavors in the malt, and a neat layer of light grapefruit hops that lingers on the tongue in a dry finish. Sugars are well-balanced, and emphasize the grain flavors, rather than mask them. I'm not usually a fan of pilsners (having been permanently scarred by the usual American watery fare), but I find this one wonderful. On a hot August afternoon, this is exactly the kind of ice-cold beer I would want."
"O- It's average to below. Hated this beer. Wow."
"o: pretty good beer. i ordered this at a bar that had it sitting on the top shelf of a glass cooler next to the light. i'm guessing that explains the slight offness in the nose. also forgot to check the date on bottle. still an awesome pils and will try again when i find a fresh batch at store."
"Pours a medium straw-gold, translucent, and is capped with a decent white head; it looks the part of a Pils. The nose is nice, revealing dry grainy notes, some herbal-grassy hop and a tinge of mineral. The flavor is much hoppier than the nose suggests - while still retaining the same basic characteristics - and has a pleasantly bitter-astringent finish. Easy drinking, with a nice feel; quite a good take on the style."
"O: I love this beer and drink it often. I think it is one of Victory's best beers and a great summer beer. The flavor is so tasty and the color so appetizing. I just love it."
"O: Great Pilsener. I am very glad that this is now being distributed to my area. Will pick up again in a heartbeat."
"D - Extremely refreshing beer resulting in high drinkability. While not overly complex in taste, it's a very balanced beer with big hops and sweet malts. Would make a great session beer - I wish I had a few more to try. One of the best pilsners I've had."
"Hazy golden with a substantial long lived head and good amount of lace. Malt aroma with a bit of fruit and earthy/spicy hops. Medium carbonation and medium body. Great balance between grainy malt and earthy hops. Lots of bitterness (for a pilsner) in the finish."
"This beer was amazing when I had it out of a bottle, but on tap it is just out of this world. May covert me to a pilsner lover, but I've said that before."
"I just saw the enjoy by date of 1.20.2011. SOB, this ticks me off. I will re-review once I find a fresh bottle."
"O- Just a great American take on the pilsener. High marks across the board. The folks at Victory seem to know that more is not always better, and this shows that. A straightforward take on the style that has everything it needs, and absolutely nothing that it doesn't."
"M - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation."
"This beer tasted like a classic pilsner should. The hop flavor was dominating, very zesty, herbal, and posessed a fine bitter tinge. The bitterness lingers on your tongue for around 30 seconds after each drink. Just like in the aroma, there is a smooth malt taste that hides behind the powerful hops, adding to the drinkability. This beer was crisp and refreshing, exactly what I expect from a pilsner, exactly what I want to drink in the summertime."
"O: I loved this pilsener. So much taste and so refreshing. I want more."
"Final Thoughts: Simple, yet great. German style done right."
"Great mouthfeel, nice and creamy. Crisp earthy finish."
"O/D - Highly satisfied with this brew. Really hits the spot with the thermometer pushing 90. No problem having a few these in a row."
"D. Very good. Probably the best you will get this side of the Atlantic."
"O: A nice refreshing beer. Will have to give some others a shot to have something to compare to. Great for summer."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grains and zesty herbal hops. Taste is of sweet grains and a astringent bitter herbal and citrus zest hop kick. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pilsner with a very fresh taste that is very refreshing."
"Beer pours a clear yellow from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass. Little white head that dissipates into a thin lace. Drink by date of May 21st. (oops, guess I should have checked before I bought it, but I was in San Diego and just excited to see some stuff I can't get back home) Very floral hop aroma with just a touch of citrus and I am picking up just a touch a sulfurous aroma as well although not enough to be off putting. This is like a classic German Pilsner aroma, but beefed up a bit. Clean floral hoppiness on the palate with a decent malt backbone. Again I get just a touch of sulphur on the palate, maybe it wouldn't be there if the beer were fresher? Not sure. Anyway, I do like this beer quite a bit. Not exactly true to style, as others have said, but definitely a hop lover's pilsner."
"O - A hop-heavy pilsner that is as refreshing as it is dry. Unreal."
"O: Great take on the German style pilsner. Great for summer outings if you want a beer with a decently balanced body and great refreshing taste. The noble hop flavor sold me right on the spot."
"Overall, this is an excellent pilsener. It is light and refreshing with complexity of flavor and perfect hop presence."
"D: More like, “A bold pilsener beer.” Very firmly bitter & hoppy. Almost unbalanced. More of a challenge to the palate than I usually think of for a Pilsner. May be pushing boundries a bit, but at least in ain’t no macro swill."
" The tast is light toasted pils malt with a mild floral hop flavor and some spicy grassy tastes that aren't harsh, yet still gives the impression that this pils is highly hop flavored with a very mild yeast mineral quality and light pilsner malt sweetness. The finish is dry and spicy with a nice yeasty tinge. I think this is a great American take on the German Pils style, with a pretty hop forward taste, yet it is still within range to be considered traditional influenced with nice noble hop character and high drinkability."
"D/O- A refreshing pilsner but with much more hops than normal. Was saving this for an outdoor romp this summer but now it's too damn hot for that. A real winner from Victory. Give this to your neighbor who likes the BMC stuff."
"Draft @ Redcoat Tavern. Pours a pale straw yellow with a scummy white head with surprising lacing. Aroma is grassy with light citrus and flowery hops. Initial sweetness yields to significant bitterness and a long grain finish. Getting along extraordinarily well with my burger. Lovely."
"Leaves an oily mouthfeel while the aftertaste consists oddly of that smokey flavor i seem to taste."
"overall i'm admittedly not a die-hard pilsner buff but this is a very good rendition. flavorful and refreshing."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow or straw color white foamy head, decent retention, good lacing. Smells of hops, lemon, grass, yeast esters. The taste, wow, I'm used to pilsners being real light, almost water like with some hop bite, but this is a full on hoppy pils, sort of like I remember SA Noble Pils being fresh, this is very good stuff. I get a tone of noble hops up front, a lemony, citrus taste, then on the way down some grassy, biscuity, sweet malts quickly followed by a load of bitter hops. The feel is medium light with good carb. Overall this is a fine beer, probably the best pilsner I've tasted, I'll be sure to get again."
"Excellent; the best pilsner I've tried. The hoppy citrus flavour is great - distinctive but light. If only I could drink this every day! Too bad it's a bit pricy over here for regular consumption. Highly drinkable and highly recommended."
"O- Nice beer for the style. Not my favorite style, but this beer is a totally solid pick up for those who haven't tried it."
"lots of flavour, light, citrus, hops, begs to be drank in multiples...happiness in a bottle."
"O/D- An excellent pilsner. Easy to drink and refreshing as all get out. Gotta be one of the best of the style."
"Appearance is a light gold, with a modest white head that fades fairly quickly into a few islands of white bubbles and leaves almost no lacing. Lemon and grassy/hay scents are pleasant on the nose. Citrus and grassy flavors continue on the tongue, with a slight biscuity/cracker taste in the background. This has some big hop character, more than most other pilsners. Some prickliness and surprising creaminess make for excellent mouthfeel. I'm not much of a pilsner fan, but this one was a very good and refreshing."
"Overall I didn't hate or love this one. I know that Pilsner is not my first choice of style, but I also know that I have had a few that I really liked. With that being said,this was refreshing and something I might enjoy on a hot summer day. Thanks to McNuts for this bottle."
"Notes: I've had 5 bottles of this and has not grown on me. Stoudt's Pils seems immediately more enjoyable. Prima Pils is almost a drainpour for me."
"O - Great beer that is extremely refreshing on a hot summer day. Worth picking up a 6-pack anytime you have some summer relaxing to do."
"I recognize that this is a well made beer and perhaps I will return to it at a later date. But this isn't up my alley at the moment."
"Overall very drinkable, crisp and refreshing, nice pils malts, nice noble and bit of american hops, great pils."
"Can't like pils and not try this beer."
"O - A refreshing pils prefect for a warm summer day, clean and smooth leaving you wanting more."
"The beer doesn’t have a very big ABV, but that’s okay. It doesn’t need one. The beer is just so good. Plus, the aftertaste sticks around forever. I just love this beer. I might call this a summer beer based on the taste of all the summers I am having this season. Regardless, I love this beer."
"O- Not too shabby. Good session beer."
"prima pils is good overall but i find i actually enjoy sam adam's noble pils much more."
"Overall, a decent enough beer, but I was led to expect better. Good as a beer, but I don't think it represents the style."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden straw color wig a thin white head the dissipates rather quickly. The smell is earthy hops and a slight malt presence. The flavor is dry and slighkty bitter from the hops with some malt and earth qualities to it. The mouthfeel is well carbed and dry. Overall the most enjoyable pilsner I have had"
"A nice pilsner, but a bit too much lemon and bitterness. Nevertheless, one of the better ones I've had that's been brewed in the US."
"Not sure what to make of this as it really doesn't remind me of a german pilsner, but it is interesting. A good beer for a hop head, but if you're a pilsner fan, this may not be up your alley."
"Lots of hops for a pilsner which is why it's so unique. Bright beer, perfect finish, crisp and slightly soapy. Flavor brings more to the table than most other lagers in its class. Not gonna dock it for carbonation though. Another solid beer from Victory."
"Overall a very enjoyable refreshing beer for a summer day."
"D- A lovely flavour profile. Doesnt look the part for me but certainly stands up in the nose and taste! Easy drinking excellent clean pils"
"O- Probably the best pilsner I have had. I loved how refreshingly smooth it was, yet, provided an unexpected dry and bitter finish from the hops. Attractive looking, smelling, and tasting - I would say this is a must try summer beer. You won't be unsatisfied."
"Another masterpiece from Victory."
"Overall, a crisp, hoppy and refreshing pilsner."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a bright, flourescent yellow coloring with a huge amount of carbonation. There was a light, foamy white head across the top. There were light aromas of toast and lemon. The flavors were effervescent and sharp, keeping the beer very light. Lemon essence and toasted malt, with slight sour and hoppy green undertones. The finish is a bit musty and lingering, with astringent, drying, puckering and any other adjective that is slightly uncomfortable, but appropriate for the style."
"Overall: This one will probably come out to about a 3.2, and I'm actually being quite generous here. I'm sure by now you know what I thought of the beer overall, so I need not say more. Pity because I actually enjoy this style quite well. However, I am going to give this beer the benefit of the doubt and will promise to revisit it...just as soon as I finish off my mouthwash and give the scars left behind some time to heal."
"Overall: Hoppiest pils I've ever had. Doesn't deviate from the pils profile- just a boatload of hops."
"I was very surprised at the quality of this beer. It has a hint of dark burnt chocolate flavor and a overall wonderful taste. The after taste runs away too quickly, making you crave for another sip! Carbonation is perfect, appearance and smell...perfect again. I believe the high quality hopps and pilsner quality brewing technique makes this one of the best beers I have ever had role over my tongue! Victory makes some other very good beers....But this one is their best!"
"Overall, it's a beer that I can enjoy drinking if it happens to be around the house, but I would not seek it out. If you really like lighter beers with an undeniable hop profile, you might like it, but it's just not my cup of tea (or beer as it were). don't shy away from it, but not something you necessarily need to go on a mission for"
"Overall I really dont enjoy Pilsners (and I really didn't enjoy this one to be completely honest), but I can appreciate how this is a stellar example of an Americanized pilsner. A staple (or should be) for any light German beer fan who wants a nice American hop twist."
"Overall. Great pilsner. Wish I could get this locally."
"Overall - not one of my favorite styles. this is a decent, light beer for the hot summer days and a good interpretation of the style."
"Overall I will not buy this again. I have had much sweeter pilsners and bought this on the off chance that freshness would make it better. Grassy and bitter with harsh grains this beer is not for me."
"Feels crisp and clean. Wetting and inviting to the palate."
"Overall a complex pilsner, well executed, drinkable as well. Wouldn't mind this as a go-to lager. Thanks Knapp85!"
"Tastes are huge finishing hops (bitter or otherwise), more hops, sweat, a little honey, shoots, wheat malt, clean yeast, saliva, olives and wood. Smells the same, no detection here. I do so love Victory brewing company... and ""victory"" malts!!"
"O: Above average, but the mouthfeel and tastes don't up to the level of greatness I expect in a pils."
"The Pils pours out as a golden color with a white fizzy head on top. The head leaves a pretty nice lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is grassy but also had a pretty strong hop aroma too. The taste was malty, grassy and had a decent hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall it's not a bad pils it's just not one of my favorite styles."
"O: This how a pilsner should taste. A nice balanced beer with a decent amount of alcohol. I could drink this all day."
"Pours a fizzy yellow color with a good amount of head. Not to be mistaken with the likes of a BMC lager, as this has a much cloudier and thicker appearance despite being such a light beer. Smell is of faint grassy hops, pretty muted for the most part. However, after checking the date on the bottle, this is a good bit past its prime. My fault for not checking the bottle. Oops. It holds up surprisingly well, the pleasant grassy hops are still there, just much more muted. I've had this fresh and it is a delight to drink on a hot day. Very refreshing. Just wish it was easier to find fresh around here. Victory bottles always seem to be a good bit past their prime. However, it's still very drinkable and I'm enjoying it. Definitely recommend this for the summer. Just don't be like me - check the date before buying."
"A hop head's summer delight."
"Overall: Many attributes of a typical pilsener but moreso hop heavy then many I've tried. Being that I'm a hophead this beer sits well with me. A great addition to the style. Prosit!"
"This beer poured a bright yellow color, with a nice large head, that did go away rather quickly. The smell was oddly rater hoppy. The taste was complex, it initaly had that bit of a typical spice note that is common with pilsners, but then finished a bit hoppy. The taste stayed on the pallete for a while, and was strong; very strong for a pilsner. Overall a great beer, and a top pilsner."
"you want this beer good and cold. more of a seasonal choice perhaps. but when you are in the mood for a pilsner and would like a little extra hop bite -- this Victory Prima Pils is great."
"Aggressive hop profile, very clean flavors, an excellent Pilsener."
"Overall: One of the best German Pilsners you can find bottled."
"Mouthfeel was on the thinner side of medium. It is a nice crisp beer and it is easily sessionable, but for pilseners I don't think it has the flavors that other breweries are able to produce to make it something I'd drink more often."
"This is a nice brew. The bitter dry finish is nice. It has a tad bit of watery texture, but the flavor is good."
"Taste - Crisp and refreshing. Sweet with a strong and refreshing bitterness. This one manages to be complex and interesting at the same time that it is a great summer refresher."
"O: Such a fantastic, hop forward pilsner; so refreshing and delicious; pilsners CAN be interesting and awesome!"
"Overall a very nice beer, and a good example of not sticking exactly to the style, but improving on it by adding some extra character to it."
"O - I chose this beer for my first review b/c it is my everyday beer, one of the perks of living so close to Victory. This beer could match up with any pils from germany or prague, but it brings its own flavor to the table which you really gotta give a high five to Victory!"
"Overall I thought this was a great tasting beer, but in general it is more of an American foral hops style Pils and should maybe be in a different category than that of a Czech or German style pils, which would have more of a crisp grassy and spicy hop body."
"Overall this comes close to greatness."
"Clear light straw color in body with white bubbly head that fades but leaves lacing. Refreshing aroma of clean hops: pine, mint, light grain, light fruit. Hop forward in flavor: pine, wet grass, mint, hop leaves, light grain and subtle notes of floral/honey in the background.Finishes elegant and clean bitter. Light with active carbonation. Refreshing, clean, a beautiful pilsner. My favorite pilsener."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with nice stings from the carbonation. The spiciness also adds a good tingle to the tongue with each sip. Overall, this is a great beer. Something I'm glad that I can find fairly easily. Goes down easily and offers a decent amount of complex flavors. Definitely a great pilsner here!"
"O: Thought this was a great representative of it's style. Not my favorite type of pilsner so I don't see myself gunning to get it again. It was a little too bitter for me. However, really good beer and perhaps I'll give it another go around in the future."
"T: There's a nice snap of grassy hops upfront and then some lightly bready malts. The finish is a lighter return of grassy hops a bit of white pepper and some lemon. Very clean and drinkable and the mouthfeel is dead on for the style."
"The appearance and smell matches the bottled version, but the taste isn't as sweet. Hops are more pronounced, nice floral bite with big dose of pilsener malt for balance. This is really good, extremely drinkable on tap, one of America's best pilseners. Highly recommended."
"Easy to drink, a bold flavor, distinctive. This is in the upper echelon of the style, without question."
"O: An excellent pilsener and overall an excellent beer. One that I would enjoy having in my kegerator at home. You know, if I had a kegerator."
"Hazy straw yellow pour, white bubbly head. Aroma of crisp grassy hops, faint bit of must in the malt, citrus rind/light fruit. Flavors of dry malt with a decent bit of grapefruit/citrus rind come into play, a slight earthiness/must is apparent as well. Light bubbly body, crisp/bitter/malty throughout with a dry lingering bitter finish. Easily one of my top three session beers: it’s bright and crisp. Overall, just a very satisfying brew that I drink regularly all year round. This coupled with a very fair price point makes it a hard beer to beat. Most definitely my favorite summer brew as well as my favorite pilsener. I don’t see what there is to not love about this beer."
"Overall: Quite good overall, and the flavor is well balanced. I've heard that this one is head and shoulders above typical pilsners, and I can see why. I'm not typically a fan of pilsners, but I can definitely recommend this one."
"Ah, this is a classic from Victory and I never turn down a pint or bottle if it comes my way. That mix of German and Czech hops lends this a distinct kind of herbal or earthy spiciness that I really dig and that close to 5% ABV keeps this right there at that approachable level where you can have a couple of these without taxing the palate a whole lot. I love that I’m able to get this beer fresh at the brewery with relative ease."
"O - You can't go wrong with this one. A throwback beer to the true pilsner enthusiasts."
"Nice clean, clear pale yellow appearance. White, frothy head that dies off rather quickly. Malty and flavorful, without being heavy; more ""refreshing"" than my normal favorite, an IPA. Good sour hoppy aftertaste has a bit of flintiness in it. Some citrusy notes, some sweetness. Good balance, good complexity. Overall, complex enough to be interesting, but remains light and refreshing."
"Pale as can be, a regal light gold translucent body with a moderate amount of sticky lacing, high-carbonation, crisp, very bitter, lemony, grassy, herbal, pilsener malts, bready yeast, noble hops, and hard minerally water. A highly drinkable Summer beer. It's not complex and it's not wowing, but definitely a must try and quite the quality pilsener. I'm not a huge fan of pilseners, but this beer is a good introduction to hops."
"Pours a golden yellow with a one-finger bright white head. Subpar lacing and head retention. Grass and citrus aroma, nothing much there. Well hoped pilsener. Pretty big floral and herbal hops to start. Solid bitterness. Nice grassy and hay flavor adds some balance before a bit of sweet citrus flavor closes the show. Finishes dry and crisp. Big tasting pills."
"Overall: So sessionable."
"Poured a dirty yellow. Small head left a layer of yeast particles floating on the top. Good lacing marks. I have a hard time getting much nose, but I pick up carbonation, if that has a smell, banana and some spice. I think the Hop Devil has the same spicy note. Hops come through the taste with a bitterness that lingers. Banana notes as well. This is a light body beer that is easy to drink. After my last couple Pilseners, I have realized they are not my favorite, but still enjoyable."
"It's fresh, thirst quenching, lively, subtly complex and by far the best I've had in a category that I usually avoid. I would buy again and drink it again and then buy it again and then yeah"
"O – Awesome pilsner. Def the flagship pilsner for me so far."
"O - this is one amazing beer. had heard quite a lot of good things about this one but was still blown away."
"Overall, this is a cornerstone of the American craft brewing movement's history. A beer of legend that delivers. Step away from the stout and enjoy what got us here in the first place!"
"Medium to light mouthfeel with a crisp finish. Probably the best Pilsener I've ever had. Will enjoy this regularly."
"Excellent pilsner. Recently picked up a fresh six pack with late June consume by date. Pours a deep golden color with nice foamy head and good carbonation. Smells of nice floral hops. Taste is great. Crisp bitterness and some floral hops. Very drinkable. This is an excellent beer to pair with food. Highly recommended."
"O - I can definitely see why there's so many people that like this brew, and it's sparked my interest for the Pilsner style. To me this beer is easy enough to toss back a few or more over some BBQ or anything really, very drinkable. The floral and dryness of the beer would be the only thing I might have a problem with after a couple, but with some grub probably not. Definitely worth picking up again and again. Cheers!"
"Knockout pilsner. The only downside is it might get a little too floral/citric/bitter after a few of these, IMHO. Other than that, this lager has everything in it's place and the result is a refreshing, great-tasting brew with a body and mouthfeel that won't wash your pallete away in a sea of malt, hops and yeast. Outstanding."
"Crisp mouthfeel, light body. Very drinkable, though I still don't get the hype around this every year."
"O: Refreshing overall, especially on a nice day. A nice pilsner."
"Pours out a straw gold, good bubbles, some whispy lacing. The beer smells slightly spicey, and rather grassy. The taste is very clean and dry, and slightly sweet. Big grassy, earthy hops greet the palate and come off cleanly, dry, and bitter. Wow, has a nice big green apple snap to it, something you only get from a fresh, hoppy pilsner. Jeez, you know I wonder how different the WORLD would be if people learned how to appreciate what a real pilsner style beer tastes like. Peace in the Mid-East? Maybe. Racial harmony? Possibly. Anyway, not quite as hard and bubbly mouthfeel as a ""true"" Czech pilsner, but slightly smoother. Overall this is a wonderful brew, that could go well with just about anything; bowling, BBQ, burgers, bungee-jumping, the sky is the limit..."
"O: nice balanced drinkable brew. Lots of flavor."
"O: Overall this has opened my eyes to the fact that a bright yellow beer can be full of flavor. I know this beer has a high overall score but I assumed the hop head in me would be sorely disappointed. Great crisp refreshing summer beer. Will seek out this brew often."
"O: This is a fairly good pilsner. The bitter aftertaste causes it to lose some drinkability, but it is still a crisp and enjoyable beer."
"As far as value, it's a little light. For example, this runs me $8.99 a 6er vs Radeberger at $5.99 a 6er and Noble Pils or Urquell comes in at $12.49 a 6er, which are all also excellent examples of the style (and corn free!) Definitely try it sometime though, it's worth checking out."
"Overall: I'm not fan of hopped up beers (Heresy!!!) but this is definitely an exception. I can see myself picking up another six-pack in the summer when it gets hotter and drinking this on the front porch."
"Poured with minimal head, that's not what I came to the beer for. Smells outright hoppy, as it warms up, your classic Pilsen malt honey/grainy smell comes through. This is a hop bomb of a pilsener If you want to taste nothing but Saaz for a while drink one of these. This beer will scrape off your taste receptors and replace them with hop resin. I find that a good thing."
"I have had this beer many times but just now got around to reviewing it. The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the pilsner malt with some grassy hops and bready malt mixed in. Overall, it smells like a classic pilsner. The flavor is heavy on the pilsner malt with some saaz hops mixed in. Tastes like exactly what you expect a pilsner to taste like. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The bitter bite feels good, and the beer is an easy drinker. A good beer to be sure, but probably not my favorite."
"Bright and clear golden yellow with a lot bubbles rising from the body of my Three Stooges Pilsener glass. A fat two finger head that clings in large globs around the sides. A grassy/straw sweetness with a zesty hint of some dried mango and lemon peel. Crisp and bubbly with the first sip. A lot of lemony sweet light malt right after that tingle but then it breaks away into the hop flavors. A floral blast first that has a mild tropical fruitiness that switches quickly to a lemon dry bitterness. A grassy lemon dry bitterness."
"O: Ive found myself very drawn to prima pils as of late as my go to beer of choice and i also find it to be a very nice example of the pilsner style"
"O--This is a very good pilsner. Actually, probably the best one I have ever had. It is perfect for this time of year in Miami. It's a nice light beer that I could see myself enjoying out by the pool or beach."
"Mouthfeel is crisp on the front and a little creamy in the finish, creating a nice balance of both. Overall a good beer. Freshness date on this bottle is almost a month ago however and I wonder how that affects the overall taste. I understand that good pilsners are complicated beers that have a limited time to be enjoyed at their full potential, so I wonder how much this one is affected. Either way I enjoyed it very much and look forward to trying a fresher selection."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Refreshing. Dry finish."
"O - This is easily one of the best pilsners I ever had. Just a great complex taste, clean and crisp. I think this is a great spring and summer beer."
"O- Overall its not bad, but it's not for me. The ingredients tend to be overpowering on almost every aspect of this beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Extremely light bodied and refreshing. Quite a crisp and dry finish. Well balanced between malt grains, barley and hoppy sweetness. Overall a decent pilsner but not outstanding to me."
"All in all, I'm upset I didn't grab a sixer (with a later freshness date to boot), as I'd like to see how sessionable this brew is. Either way great pilsener, probably the best and most unique I've had! Lived up to the hype!!!"
"What a great pilsner, this beer will be accompanying me into those hot summer afternoons taking naps on the deck. Prost!"
"D: Excellent. With only 5% abv and a light crisp taste this is an enjoyable beer!"
"O: This has been, and will most likely remain, my favorite lager. Victory is a true master of lagering. And I normally hate most lagers!"
"Drinkability: This is the best interpretation of a German Pils I've ever had. The sweetness, the appropriate bitterness, the floral hop aroma & flavor, and the color are exceptional. Very refreshing, and HIGHLY recommended!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: The flavor from the hops separates this pilsner from the rest of the pack. Your triple hops brewed Miller Light drinkin' friends might not even be able to handle Prima Pils ;)"
"D- A good pilsner, I wonder if the bottle being a little past its ""fresh date"" was maybe why it wasn't a bit better. I'll be more careful to check the date next time, but I will give a try again soon."
"D - Highly drinkable and although the hop bitterness overpowers the malt, its not too much. Would definitely have again, especially as a complement to a meal."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours a crystal clear gold with a perfect white head and nice lacing. Aroma is crisp, with a good balance of spicy doughy yeast and Saaz hops. Flavor matches quite well, with a pretty strong hop resin bite for a Pils. A little strong on the carbonation, but this is a great lively summer brew. Just hearty enough to not be classified as watery, but light enough to session."
"Wow, what a pilsener. Awesome hops, clean malt characteristics, a perfect summer/session brew. Not a style I drink a lot of but this one is by far the best I've had."
"Overall, probably my favorite pilsener I've had. Tasty, and easy to drink. I don't like Victory, and only like one other beer they make (Old Horizontal), but this may be their best beer."
"I am not a big hoppy beer drinker but this was a clean crisp refeshing beer. Has a nice clean finish and will lead you to drinking more. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"-this is quite good. i have been wanting to try this for awhile and i am not bummed to have 5 more left in the 6er"
"D- Despite the rather odd mouthfeel and the almost bland smell, this is a very good beer. The crisp, spicy hops and the undercurrent of subtle maltiness make for two complimentary flavors that make for one interesting beer."
"12oz bottle drank from my Rodenbach Grand Cru glass... A medium clear dark gold, a nice bright finger cap, great sticky lacing. Could be a touch clearer but looks fine... The aroma is quite pleasant, tons of sweet grain, floral, spice, lemon, bitter finish. Very solid... The taste is zesty lemons, grain, and floral notes. The finish is very bitter and biting, so much flavor. Not a style I enjoy but this hits home closest to the major Euro versions."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied, just creamy enough. Drinkability is high because of the good crisp finish."
"Taste fresh melon up front - honeydew - but the sweetness is barely noticeable as it immediately retreats into bitter citrus, then finishes dry with a tingling spice sensation - bergamot. Has a real nice mouthfeel and is very drinkable."
"Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying this refreshing brew. Next time I'll try for some fresher bottles but this is still good enough. I don't go for pilseners all that much(I like the maltier lagers) but this is one I'll certainly buy when I'm in the mood."
"The CpJ"
"D- Not high, but a good beer non the less! Victory never disappoints craft brew heads. Always fresh hops and some citrus. I enjoyed but wouldn't drink more than one."
"Moderate body and enjoyable all around, will probally only buy this in the summer."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing as it should be for the style, but the citrus in particular aids the mouthfeel quite a bit. Drinkability is fantastic, although the malt gets a bit strong near the end, it is really well balanced for the most part."
"M/D - Medium-light body with lots of carbonation that can be felt on the palate. Finishes with a neutral amount of dryness, not too dry not too sweet. Not the most complex style on the planet but this one is easy to drink especially now that the weather is starting to warm up."
"Great session beer - A pils with a good strong taste and a kick."
"Crisp, and refreshing. A light wheat like grain base was cut by a nice orange rind like hop flavor that was quick to turn nice and bitter on you. Hints of banana flavored yeast and a nice finish that was full of fresh cut grass and a wet hay flavor. This was a nice medium bodied pilsner. Much thicker then you would normally see from the style, but it worked very well. An outstanding session ale, this was one I would have no issues in repeating any day. It was light, crisp and clean with a nice profile and low ABV, all things making this lean hard towards being very seasonable."
"Nice, light, crisp and refreshing. Easy to drink."
"Pours a light golden color, very little head. THis is the type of beer I would use to ""trick"" a budweiser drinker...I love to see the expression on their faces when they drink something with flavor. Smells of bitter hops and light citrus, maybe fresh-cut hay. The beer has a nice, hoppy bitterness that pairs well with a good cheddar...excellent tasting beer. Crisp and dry mouthfeel with good carbonation. I'm typically a one-beer guy, but I could easily drink a few of these."
"Overall a very solid pils. Wish noble pils was as available as this is though."
"Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing without being watery. A great session beer that you sit and drink all night long. Probably my favorite of the style."
"D: The quantity of hops in this are unlike any other pilsner I've had. This is a great drinking beer and something I think anyone from novice to beer geek can enjoy."
"$2.10 a single."
"Pours a decent looking clear golden color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of grain and citrus hops and tastes much the same with plenty of hop bitterness and a little biscuit or grain in there. Medium mouthfeel with a thick carbonation. Drinkability is alright."
"D: if the Uber Pils from HS wasn't available this would be my next pick."
"And yes, I know I'm in the miority on this one."
"Pours a clear gold. The smell of noble hops is very strong. The flavor has a minerally quality, but primarily there's pilsner malt, noble hops, and bitterness. Lots of good stuff to taste here, but in my mind it's too bitter. If they'd ease back on the bittering hop additions, this would be one for the ages. Still, the most flavorful American lager in recent memory."
"Overall this is one of the best examples of the style I have ever had. Its was super refreshing, with a great flavor. I could surely sit and enough a sixer of this without a problem. This could be a great session brew for myself. I would have to say the heavy handed hops in this brew, some people might say its to much. Another great brew by Victory Brewing Company."
"It pours with a 2 1/2 inch white head that has pretty good retension. The color is a very clear pale golden. Smell was a bit skunky with a light hoppy background. The flavor was far better than the smell, slight german malt flavor with a pretty hoppy finish. mouthfeel light and refreshing. this beer would be a great ""lawn mowing"" beer."
"Overall I am a huge fan of Victory, but this one fell a bit short. The hops and color are good, but everything else is lacking. Mouthfeel is too watery, like a crossover brew. I'm not impressed by this one."
"Excellent drinkability. Crisp and clean. Light and flavorful. Very enjoyable. Definitely a beer that could (and probably should) be had throughout a hot summer day."
"D- This beer is definitely drinkable, pretty refreshing come to think of it. The bitterness might get a bit much, though."
"Drinkability is real solid and easy and unique, this is a great beer for summer."
"Prima is an excellent Pilsner. I drank it on a buss trip to the Victory Brewing Co. which was three hours from my hometown. The mouthfeel was easy and smooth and no harshness in the after taste. I'm thinking that it is the little twist that Victory puts in to make it their own. Cheers!"
"D - Very quaffable and extremely delicious, this is a great session lager. I'm still not much of a Pilsner fan, but this is one of the best I've had."
"Overall I though that this was one good plilsener. I enjoyed the fact that this one had a little more hops then your normal pilsener which helped make this beer pretty unique for its style. I am glad I tried this beer and it gave me a good first impression of victory. I would buy this again, hopefully I will find it fresh."
"D - It takes a lot of getting used to for me. I enjoyed it half the time, and half the time I felt like I had to force it down. Some may suggest this is a pilsner for IPA fans since it accentuates the hops, but I just can't really enjoy it. I've never been a fan of pilsners, but thought this would convert me. It didn't."
"Drinkability: It's good, but I would need to pair another one of these with the right meal to enjoy another. I suspect this beer would be better, and perhaps not as bitter, if I had gotten it before it's ""best by"" date."
" A good experience. Certainly better suited to warmer weather than February in Beantown."
"It's not bad and I could probably drink another, but I'm surprised that it is at the top of the list for this style.  Oh, crap--I think the camera man just got eaten by a demon..."
"D: I had pretty high hopes for this one and it just didn't live up to it. The acidic/metallic flavor was just too strong and up front and I found the hop/malt flavors to be a bit one dimensional. This still drinks fairly easily though."
" Cheers - Matt"
"Mouthfeel was smooth and easy as well as being a drinkable beer."
"This is a VERY refreshing brew, and due to the perfect balance, it is one beer that I could have any time, any place. Drinkability is indeed very high. Certainly worth a try, if you haven't had the chance to try it so far. Highly recommended."
"Overall, this is a surprising pilsner. By European standards, this has been way over-hopped. Bear that in mind before diving in."
"Exceptionally drinkable, could have this one all day long."
"D: really tasty brew. easily could down a six of this while keeping my shit together. not my favorite from victory, but a really really drinkable brew."
"Overall: Not as good as HopDevil, not even close."
"D: The strong floral flavors in this are interesting and unique, yet overpowering and slightly overbearing. I don't think I would want to drink more than 1 of these. However, this is a nice once-in-a-while beer for me to mix it up with a lighter meal etc."
"D - Excellent drinkable beer, would work well on its own or a session."
"D - Overall, love the beer. Great sessionable beer with the ABV and body. While it's complex, it isn't complex enough to keep me coming back for another."
"Drinkability: Probably my go to Pilsner. Victory nailed the style with this one."
"D- Very easy to drink and enjoy. Not very filling, could easily drink a lot in one sitting. Would be great as a cold beer on a hot day and something refreshing after work."
"Drinkability - Light malt and plenty of hops. Crisp and clean. A great session beer that is very drinkable. I look forward to this one on a hot summer day."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a fluffy white head. Smells of hops and light malt, very crisp scent. The taste echoes the scent, good hoppy and light malt flavors, very refreshing. The mouthfeelnus medium with strong carbonation. This is a drinkable and enjoyable beer but I don't ubderstand why it scores as highly as it does. It's a great German pilsner, but there are great German breweries that are doing this style much better and have for many years. This is a good American version that I quite enjoyed, but there are people out there who can do it better."
"Mouthfeel like the taste is just above average in my book. The powdery taste also translates into a dryness that I just don't dig. The carbonation is spot on and light body really makes this one an easy drinker. All in all no real badness here. Its a satisfying brew and one that you can drink again and again."
"In the mouth, Prima Pils is light bodied and crisp. Carbonation is moderate and appropriate to style. I could wish that it finished a little cleaner, but that is a mild complaint. 5.3% ABV goes undetected. Drinkability will depend on your taste for hops and European-style lagers. Personally, I'm not a hop-head but despite the strong hoppy bitterness I still found this beer to be incredibly drinkable. It's a very cool twist on an age-old style that I would recommend to fans of pale ale and traditional lager styles alike. Prima Pils is very well done."
"This was the best of the night for me. Pours a pale, hazy, unfiltered yellow, nice stick. Smelled of hops and lemons and flowers. Tasted lemons right away, balanced hops, this is a crisp and inviting pilsener with the right amount of bitterness and is highly drinkable."
"Overall, this is not what I am looking for in a pilsner. I want crisp, hoppy, refreshingly drinkable, not muddled, citrusy randomness with an wheat-like, dense mouth-feel."
"A pale straw yellow with a fluffy pure white head. Nice bits of lace on the glass. Smell is bed of pale malt and crisp spicy hops. Pepper and grassy with lemongrass notes. Some citrus as well. Taste is not you average pilsner. Sweet malt with a bit of dough. Some yeast based breadiness. Firm and spicy hop finish with a bit of grapefruit and a lightly sour dryness. Crisp light feel is softly carbonated. Super quenching and drinkinable. An excellent session beer and anything else you may have in mind."
"Very bready in the flavor. Biscuit present. Definitely yeasty with a bit of astringency. The light citrus in the nose doesn't show up in the taste at all but instead this brew is more and more malt forward as it approaches room temperature. Overly light carbonation gets marks down on this dry finishing Pils."
"To me, this is going to serve as the benchmark for all pilseners out there. Just that good!"
"Overall: My humble opinion here, but taste and mouthfeel-wise, Prima is an extremely fair representation of a beer style that is popular nationwide in Germany, but has few accurate imitators here in the States."
"I could and have drank copious amounts of Prima Pils. I'd love to drink a better pilsner than Prima Pils, but until I make a pilgrimage to Europe, I doubt that'll happen. And even then, we'll see."
"A nice session beer. Will have to try again in the heat of summer."
"I would say that being one who tends to lean towards the darker and more bitter, I was pleasantly suprised and do intend on purchasing Prima in the futer."
"D - I'll just say I'm glad I didn't get a six pack."
"D: Meh overall. Seems like it is a miss on the noble hops, the bitterness is too much, and it lacks the clean crisp flavor I expect for this style. It seems like everyone goes gaga for this beer, but for me it is a pretty big miss. Thought I would give it a second try and I am still not impressed."
"This was poured from a cold 22 oz bomber into a chilled fluted Schlitz glass. I admit this to a group who largely shun a chilled glass, as do I, but this was perfect tonite. Man, I feel like a rugged workin' American man with my chilled glass!"
"Golden and slightly cloudy/hazy with a good looking pure white head. Smells of spicey hops, malts, and it has a grainy aroma to it. This brew has a distinctly bready feel to it at first sip, which leads into an abundance of spicy hop flavor, a fresh,earthy and grainy taste, a biscuity malt profile and a slight sweetness. This beer tastes fresh, has a nice refreshing feel to it, and follows up with a crisp and slightly bitter aftertaste. It's a masterpiece."
"Overall: Best by date well past and probably contributed to a lower quality. I expect more from Victory Brewing. I've always enjoyed their beers and needless to say, I was a bit disappointed that I had picked up a beer with an ""Enjoy By"" date from a little over a month ago. Will definitely have to try this again."
"Notes: not bad for Pennsyltucky"
"d. very drinkable. strong in flavor, but refreshing in its character. recommend above storm king any day"
"M/D - Light body, ends dry. Super drinkable, maybe a touch bitter for some but great to me. At the top of my list for American interpretations of the style."
"Quite good, my first Victory Brewing beer and I am impressed."
"All around an excellent beer despite being in a style that's less popular than stouts or IPAs, and one I wouldn't mind drinking regularly."
"mouthfeel is fairly thick for a pils due to the resinous hops but i am a fan which is why i grabbed the case. probbly wouldn't drink more than 4 maybe 5 in one sitting, but as far as drinkability goes it certainly has plenty of it. a good unique pils to try, but im sure there are better and i will find them"
"Definitely the best pils on the planet. Just an outstanding crisp pils with an advanced pedigree of flavor. Buy this one in a case with confidence. Great in a bottle and the ultimate is to enjoy one on tap at the brewery restaurant. Geat job Victory!"
"D - Pretty drinkable session beer, a good one to have at a wedding and other occassions where the macro and craft guys mix."
"D-Very good session beer and excellent gateway brew for your stubborn American macro friends."
"M/D - Smooth like bodied, perfect carbonation. I could drink this stuff all night. Very well balanced and extremely refreshing. Also very attractive looking when poured correctly. Has a nice glow about it."
"This is another solid offering from Victory and sure to be a pleaser if I were to buy a whole case (since I live in PA and all.)"
"On tap at The Office. Pours golden in color with a nice, long lasting, white head. Aroma is light of grassy hops. Very dry. Earthy hops dominate the flavor from the beginning with some maltiness in the background. Long, dry finish. Well, I'm just not a pilsner lover."
"Try this beer on a warm summer day or night, as a chaser for hard alcohol, or any time really."
"D-very high, it would be easy to have many of these...."
"D: Being a hophead, this is the Pilsner for me..."
"Overall: An awesome beer, and an overall excellent example of the style. It could be a little lighter and a little more effervescent, but I could drink a lot of this."
"D - Not quite a session beer, but close!"
"Finished off the bottle with some ordinary medium cheddar and it was great if not better."
"Prost!"
"Overall, a good take on the pilsener style. There's not a whole lot to say about it since its quite simple, but its still well done. This isn't my favorite style so I just tried to review against the style. It wasn't as hoppy on tap as I remember it being in a bottle. Given the beer's hoppiness, I can't help but think of the Miller commercials claiming it is triple hopped brewed for that great pilsener taste. Well, if you want an actually decent example of that kind of thing, go with Prima Pils. Cheers!"
"Without a doubt the hoppiest Pilsener that I've ever had, and perhaps the best."
"D- Perhaps too hoppy for a traditional pils, I still very much enjoy this one. One of the better domestic lagers in the country."
"Drinkability: This is a highly drinkable, highly enjoyable pilsener. This may be the best pils I've had outside of Europe. It definitely has all the qualities that one looks for in a German-style pilsener. Definitely worth a shot and definitely something I'll pick up again."
"D - Highly drinkable, as expected from a, while the hops flavors allow you to enjoy every sip."
"A fantastic interpretation of a German pilsner, with an assload of hops. You could drink this all day."
"Pours a just slightly translucent gold with a frothy head and some lacing. Smell: Very prominent floral hops with slight maltiness- the smell is quite appetizing. Drinks very smooth -feel the pinch of hops on the tongue with a lingering grapefruit-like bitterness with a not too wet or dry finish. Overall, a spectacular pilsner with a surprisingly high dosage of hops and honestly, in this category, I think holds its own or surpasses the German counterparts. Prost!"
"This is a rather good German beer that I would rather have than a Budweiser; it's sessionable. It's a strong tasting beer that I'll recommend, but probably not encounter again for quite a while."
"This is the first review of my Thanksgiving beers. Poured into pint glass. One finger white head that quickly dissipates. Cloudy pale yellow color. The aroma has hints of flowers, cirus and hops. Nice hop flavor for a pilsner. Hints of lemon and citrus. Finishes nice and dry. I am impressed. Very robust, crisp, refreshing and flavorful. If you are looking to change Miller Lite drinkers this is the beer."
"Pours a golden yellow with a nice white head. Aroma of citrusy piney hops, some light malt and yeast. Taste is similar to aroma. Palate is light bodied, with good carbonation, and crisp mouthfeel. Finish has strong piney hops presence with some light bitterness, light bready notes and some malt. Overall a descent brew."
"When I first poured this I was skeptical, but Prima Pils turned out to be, well, awesome. Thanks to BA for steering me in the direction of this outstanding pilsner!"
"Semi-opaque golden, straw colored pour. Frothy, off white, sticky head with awesome lacy retention. Smell of grass and biscuity malts. Some spicy notes in smell too. Biting herbal hops are beautifully meshed with semi-sweet malt. Dry finish brings back the hops again. Tantalizing carbonation and somewhat oily mouth-feel is very pleasant. This is a fine pilsner. Probably the best I have had. An uncommon hops signature with a traditional biscuit malt character. I can't believe how good this goes down. Another Victory for me!"
"If you like the type this may be a good beer for you, but I don't care for the bitter aftertaste that hangs on the tongue. I won't be going back to this one again, but that's just my taste. I wouldn't stop anyone else from drinking it."
"D: This is a very easy to drink Pilsner. More hop character in this beer than expected but a decent malt back bone balances it out some."
"Great, eminently drinakable beer with a big flavor. This is a pils? I'm not so sure. Regardless, I'll be coming back to this one again."
"Bottle. Pours a fairly clear straw color with a nice white fizzy head. Nose is fresh wheat, gentle grassy hops and a bit of lemony. Crisp, highly refined flavor. The hops are gentle and meld perfectly with the bright, citric qualities. Has only a bit of lingering bitterness. Not quite as good as the CBC pilseners from Victory, but a pleasure to drink nonetheless."
"Drinkability: This is a beer you could really spend some time with in an evening. Enough flavor to keep you interested and light enough to be very sessionable."
"overall a nice overly hopped pilsner, definatly worth a try."
"A good beer, but not great IMO. Admittedly not the biggest pilsner fan, and the taste is pretty nice, just doesn't bring it all together to take it to that next level. Solid brew though."
"Moderate body and a vey drinkable Enjoyable beer."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. A bit unbalanced for my liking and caught somewhere between a pilsener and IPA without getting the finer features of either. An interesting beer but I don't think I'll seek it out again."
"Still quite pleased with this beer but would not buy it to satisfy a craving for a German Pils. I would rate this very highly as an IPA but if you would excuse me, I'm going to go get a Radeberger. :D"
"D - If you're looking for a pilsener, this beer is a well-built one; with pilsener hops packed in every sip, you won't be let down; brewers did a great job making this beer, emphasizing on quality; if I was a big fan of pilseners this would probably be one of my top choices"
"I'm reviewing this beer again since I just bought their mix 12 pack and this was in there. You get that pilsner malt grain smell but it smells sweet and delicious. The hops come through the most in the smell though with a pretty pungent sharp, fruity, herbal note. The taste is fantastic with the pilsner cake malt taste in the beginning then the hops come in pretty sharp and adding some fruity overtones and then the malt comes in again to balance out some of the bitterness. The hops prevail though and leave you with a sharp dry bitterness. This is seriously hoppier then some IPA's I've had. This could almost pass for an IPA because of the dryness bitterness and the fact that they use a light malt to showcase the hops more. You can tell they use German hops instead of American. This and My Antonia from Dogfish Head are very similar but both are my favorite Pilsner beers to date."
"D: If I didn't know any better I'd think this was from a top German brewery. It is a terrific beer despite being a somewhat unpopular style."
"D- Easily sessionable with a surprisingly hoppy taste."
"This beer pours the distinct clear pale straw color with a dense half finger of foam head that is expected with a pilsener. The aroma is mild in nature, but hints at being a spicy lemon pepper flavor. The smell has a biscuit like smell almost combining into an aroma that is akin to lemon curd. The taste however is decidedly less exciting. It's a solid pilsener, but lack any depth whatsoever. It's still above average flavor, but not by much. There is a dry crisp lemon and grass flavor spiced with coriander. The saving grace of this beer is that while there is some bitterness to it it drinks really very smoothly and goes down nice and easy. I could see this being used to pull people away from BMC products. Overall this is a very good beer and a fine representation of the style."
"Drink- I could see at the beach or river downing a 6 pack, that would be quite nice. Heres to summer coming back."
"Extremely drinkable, it's the kinda beer that makes me wish my glass was bottomless. Excellent for a session beer."
"Drinkability - I would without a doubt find this beer again! It offers a well balanced taste while making you want more. The freshness is amazing and taste draws you in for more."
"I tried this beer on a whim at a beer festival not expecting more than a good beer. Turns out it was a great beer. The most unique aspect of this beer was the flavor which I would describe as distinctly fresh and herbal; its reminded me of basil. I am definitely planning on seeking out this beer from a retailer and bringing it home."
"D- Prima Pils is an unbelievable brew. Victory created a brew that exhibits high point in all aspects. This is an excellent brew for warm weather. Very drinkable and delicious. In my opinion, this is the best Pilsner in the universe!"
"D: an excellent and enjoyable pilsner. brilliant execution. I will buy this again."
"D - Not bad really. The hops will slow you down, but the malt keeps it mellow & smooth. In any case, I found the flavor interesting enough to keep me sipping & sipping"
"Pours a niceclear golden straw color with plenty of visible carbonaion bubbles. Nice white head and a bit of lacing. Nose is grain and fresh noble hops. Herbal, floral, and a tad earthy. Taste balances the grain and bitterness quite well. Great, crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation levels. Drinks really well and is a Spring and Summer staple for me."
"D- Overall, Prima Pils is an excellent Pilsner that is one of the best beers within the style. Highly recommended!"
"This is by far the best pilsener style beer that I've had, and probably will remain that way. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I'm a huge fan of this beer. If you haven't tried it, do so."
"Overall: Lots of good impressions on this beer! This German pils style is a bit hoppier than most Bohemian/Czech styles that I also really enjoy, but it is still very balanced. Very drinkable, with great hop and malt profiles."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I would definitely recommend checking this one out."
"Overall, great beer...this is a great pils, one of the best out there, i'm usually an APA fan, but this would do any night of the week"
"The bitterness is a bit much for me for this style, although I like the flavor on the body quite a bit. I'm not sure if I'd reach for this one when I'm in the mood for a pils, but it's certainly decent."
"D-This is one of the better hoppy pilsners on the market, and one of my favorite beers to drink on a hot day."
"D-this is crisp enjoyful beer all the way through! the taste stays!"
"this was over hopped to my palate and had a strange aftertaste of bitterness that was not enjoyable. the normal bitter refreshing characteristics are gone and the overly bitter exotic tastes come through in a way you do not want to drink them. This made Urquell's taste seem amazingly more refreshing and enjoyable."
"Drinkability: VERY drinkable, this would make an awesome session beer, and is even a great beer to introduce others to great beer, without throwing them out of their comfort zone too much."
"It's an extremely drinkable beer. It's loaded with flavor, not filling, and refreshing. All the makings of a great beer."
"REVIEW EDIT 1/29/11! I finally, finally, finally found a fresh bottle of this! This has me enjoying by May 3rd, 2011. Much better! The hops are more pungent that I remember, and the taste is super crisp and refreshing. Drinkability score revised from 4.5 to 5.0."
"This is really a terrific pilsner. At over 5% ABV and loaded with hop flavor, it feels like a big beer, but hits the spot on a sunny September day. It's dry and full of saaz bite. This is one of the most robust pilsners that I have ever tasted, and I believe is a shining example of the style. A quality German pilsner that can stand toe-to-toe with IPAs."
"Drink well my friends"
"I'm thinking this would go great with some wurst and red cabbage. Though only 5.3% ABV, it packs a wallop. Savor, don't pound. Tastes just fine as it warms to room temperature."
"D: I could drink this all day. Once it is colder out not so much, but in Tx when does it get cold?"
"I would definitely recommend this beer. It is a great value. It would be a good beer to keep on hand."
"Overall- I absolutely love lagers. I'm a contrarian when it comes to most people on this sight in that regard. I've just been constantly disappointed by this beer. The Gaffel Kolsch (an ale I know) and the Radeberger I had prior just showed so much more craftsmanship and subtlety that this beer ultimately just fell short."
"A nearly perfect example of the style. A bit under carbonated for my taste. Smell and taste are dead on with a touch of hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel completely leaves you dry wanting more, and the abv makes it ideal to toss these back all day. Love this beer."
"Drinkability: It's not filling and low ABV, so it's very drinkable. Definitely a great substitute for some BMC crap if you're looking to put down quite a few brews. If I had drank this straight from the bottle I would have thought it was unbelievable for a ""lighter"" beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and slightly thin as it should be. Very well carbed which fills it up a bit. Very solid beer. This is an intensely good pilsner. Nice beer."
"D - Very high, the definition of a light beer for any time of year and with almost any food."
"the beer has a higher carbonation, lighter body, refreshing. easy drinkin', good for a hot summer day."
"D: I bought this because I've only heard good things about it. I gave it a pretty good review, but I also don't really see what all the hubbub was about. It was just another good variation of a pilsner in my eyes. Could get something similar for a smaller price in the store and still be more than happy."
"Relatively cLear color, some cloudiness. Beautiful Light straw color.White foam disappears quickly, thin lace remains around edge of glass, expected longer lasting foam for this style.Faint hop aroma. Mild malt aroma with spicy notes. Slightly bitter with medium dry finish. Malty presence in beginning. Don't find hops to be overbearing but definitely remains at end. High carbonation. Beer remains light and refreshing. Very drinkable and well balanced."
"Notes: This will probly be the highest I rate a Pilsner. Pilsners are my least favorite type of beer, dont know why just think they're very bland. I have to hand it to victory though as this is the best one I've had. I will agree with the hype around this and the accolades this gets, but still just not for me."
"Drink - a world class beer that I will be happy to purchase and drink again and again."
"Overall this Pilsner is crisp, clean and refreshing with plenty of flavor. I usually find pilsners a bit underwhelming, but this one has much more hop bitterness than usual and a very nice balance."
"Quite simply, the best pilsener on the market!"
"Drinkability is average. With how bitter and bracing it is, I don't know if I could have had another one. I'm really hoping that the bottle I had was just a bad one. Will have to see if I can find one that's within the freshness date. As it stands, a decent pilsner with an interesting floral taste, but a very bitter character."
"Overall: Balanced a little bit too much to the bitterness for this style. Would have liked to see more hop flavor in finish. Overall, a good beer. Would drink again."
"Its a solid pilsner. Nice flavor. Very drinkable and refreshing. I like it."
"D-Have come to love this beer over time. I love the hop profile of this beer and its ridiculous drinkability. This one is usually loved by any who I have had try it. Perhpas my favorite Pilsener because of the American hoppiness I find to be noticeable in this beer's great flavor."
"D: I usually stay away from pils but this one had such high praise I had to try it. I was not disappointed. If more pils tasted like this I would buy them way more often."
"D) Damn it's a good beer. I'll drink it anytime. It's one of my go-to's for a bomber. It's only $3.29. Great beer, great price, great beer."
"D: as any pils should be is drinkable, and so far haven't found any that aren't, is could be given to be blind and i'd swear it was from Germany"
"D - Refreshing and very delicious with a great ABV and overall taste. I still think Noble Pils is more tasty but this is a close second in my opinion."
"Pours a yellow/golden color. Scents of cut grass, hay are upfront with scents of hops. This beers flavor is slighty dry and bread like. Some herbal flavors but overly hoppy. This is one beer to reach for in the summer. It certainly pairs well with BBQ and backyard cookouts."
"As high as it gets."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a good sized white foamy head. Large bubbles can be seen rising. The liquid is clear and straw colored. There are a lot of grassy hops in the nose. It also is a tad sweet. The flavor has a good pale malt base with whole grain hops that are present throughout each sip (and linger on after each swallow). It has a light body and a lot of carbonation. There isn't much coat, just a little bit is left behind. The beer is quite drinkable and satisfying. I believe any craft beer fan could easily enjoy a few rounds of this beer."
"DB- A hoppy Pils, especially in the floral department. Starts and finishes hoppy. Definitely a refreshing, smooth beer to kick back with on a hot summer day, or session at night."
"If I were a betting man (and I am!) I would wager that Victory has switched hop type here. I hope it's just temporary, b/c it's really done the beer a disservice and I'm rating this current batch accordingly..."
"This is my last in the six pack, which I have drunk slowly over the course of the last week or so. This beer has grown on me a bit, the more I sat and lingered with it. This is a memorable American hops-oriented pilsner."
"Theres no secret to this beer, theres a huge picture of a hop on the front. Smells like hops, tastes like hops, but it really isn`t to bitter and goes down nice."
"M: Feels smooth in the mouth, a bit like water. Perhaps that is a poor descriptor-- but most beers do not fell like water to me."
"Not exactly the same as the versions I tried in Germany but excellent in it's own right and covers enough of what I look for in the style to make it a likely go-to if it were locally available. Highly recommended, probably top five domestic versions of the style."
"I could drink this beer all day everyday and never get sick of it. Prima Pils does every single thing right that all BMC pilsners do wrong, and it shows. This beer is beautiful."
"Really well-balanced and so easy-drinking. I didn't care for this beer the first couple times, but I'm fairly sure the first one was old/flat, and the second time around I was just plain wrong. Really enjoyable brew!"
"D - I could drink this all day. It's one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. It's balanced without being overly bitter and can accompany many different foods."
"D- Nice, smooth and easy to drink. Clean pilsener that is quite refresh"
"D -- Very good, but suffers from the cloyingness I often get with highly hopped Noble Hop beers. I could drink a couple, but they'd get heavy on the palate after that."
"Pale yellow in color with a light haze. Nice white head that leaves behind wet lacings. Light floral aroma with hints of grain and grass. Refreshing carbonation and buttery smooth feel to the body. Light malty-biscuity flavor with hints of spice and butter and a nice bitter hoppy dry finish. A great pilsner on a hot summer afternoon. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable. The 22oz bottle did not last long."
"That sort of knocks down the final 3 grades."
"D - If I was stranded on a desert island and I could only have three things..."
" Completely refreshing with a dry finish. Bravo!"
"An excellent delicate tasting and smelling beer. The noble hops reign supreme. Clearly a great tasting summer beer but just as much year-round. Really appreciate the cleanness of the malt character. Nice & crisp. Really refreshing. If this beer had the right chance, it could turn the tide of all those BMC drinkers."
"The beer is distinctly a pilsner but exudes a majestic and sophisticated construct that sets it in a class of its own. Brilliant work. Phenomenal beer to pair with a wide variety of light fare."
"Wow, how has it taken me so long to drink and review this beer? It pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose is faint (as I've come to expect from these pilsners), comprising only some wheat and light florals. The taste follows, a bit stronger, with notes of floral and citrus peel bitters and a very light background bit o' biscuits. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a solid pils, but nothing to get all that uppity about."
"Drinkability: A faithful interpretation of a German style, well-balanced and enjoyable. Definitely a beer I wouldn't mind drinking again. Highly sessionable."
"Perfectly clear, pale straw color appearance with a nice white 1.5 finger head. Minimal, dot sized lacing. Smells mostly of grains and a hint of alcohol. I love the taste of this beer - the grains from the nose carry over nicely to the palate. Very smooth and clean going down with just the right amount of hop bite on the back-end. Light bodied with good carbonation. This is infinitely drinkable and one of the best pilseners I have ever tasted. This lives up to the hype - great warm weather quaffer."
"You just can't deny how easy this is to drink. It might be one of the most drinkable beers on the planet and it has definitely provoked an interest in the style."
"Pours a clear golden pear with a frothy white head. A subtly hoppy aroma with a little hint of fresh citrus. Flavor is, at first, distinctly hoppy (albeit light hops) and fresh. Later, notes of slight malt and some very light citrus flower develop. Very clean. Very light. A refined palate -- champaign-esque (in some ways). This is the best pilsener I've had so far."
"Has a crisp, lighter mouthfeel. Overall, a very drinkable beer, and a very tasty summer beer."
"A wonderful session beer, I would be happy to drink multiples of this."
"That being said, this is delicious. Prima Pils pours a light golden color with an average head that sticks around for a bit and laces nicely on the pilsner glass. The flavors are crisp and consist of citrus and pine. The hops are obviously dominant in the flavors although a bit of light malt comes through. Definitely a great pilsner to enjoy on a hot summer day. This is up there with Voodoo's Pilzilla and Oskar Blues Little Yella Pils. (The 2 other pilsners that I can actually drink and enjoy.)"
"Sorry for the lame review as I have the hardest time reviewing Pilseners due to there subtle but great flavors."
"Very well put together pilsner, with an added dimension from the amount of hops. Really enjoyed this beer and will be seeking it out in the future."
"Overall, this is a style of beer that I can get down with. A well-focused and 'roided' up pilsner. Definitely something I would take home again and again."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear, light-yellow amber with a white head.The first sip worried me, I thought it was a little lite....like a ""typical Pilsner", but after only a second, the hops introduced them self. This is a very fine example of the pilsner style. Smell of Pilsner hops are prevalent with grass and some scent of lemon. Taste is grassy hops and lemon. Mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and refreshing with some carbonation and a slight malt finish, thanx again Victory for the German malt. Very good beer for a summer day, especially after working in the yard. Or for fishing for Cat's at Midnight."
"This beer has very big bite, bitterness, dryness, and hops. Solid beer. Flavor explodes in your mouth in a huge hop bomb."
"D- Great American example of the style. Freshness gives it a leg up on the import competition. I was glad to finally find a bottle well within its freshness date. It's a great summer drinker and something I'd come back to when I'm in the lager state of mind."
"Drinkability/Overall - Love it, very sessionable, and good choice with Indian food."
"Very very good. A solid brew. The best pilsener I've had yet, and I love the style. Perfect for hot summer days."
"D: a full-flavored example of the style."
"Would def get again!"
"Hoppy rendition of a German Pils. Artfully executed and properly presented. A dynamite Pilsner, pretty much sex in a bottle."
"A nice, refreshing lager, the hoppy bite was particularly welcome, definitely something I would drink many times again."
"D: This would work as a session beer."
"O This is a good beer and I will definitely be having more. I have tried this beer on tap, but unfortunately the tap line was contaminated with a previous root beer selection, so a true comparison could not be made. I am looking forward to trying this on tap in the future."
"D- Very crisp, nice-drinking pilsner."
"A decent sipper but lacks a bit of cleanliness on the back."
"Quite tasty, maybe a bit high on the hop, for a bitter finish. But a damn good german pils."
"Notes: Sampled at a beer tasting at Bliss in Wauconda, IL. Compared to many of the other summer beer we had tasted, this one was the most potent and full bodied."
"Great level of carbonation, with a light yet somehow sticky mouthfeel that goes great with the brew. Quite drinkable on a hot day."
"Wasn't wowed for the price, but a solid beer."
"I rate this beer well, it's a nice brew. It's just not really a pilsner--Victory should market it differently. For contrast, Trumer is another American brew that fits the style better. But this is still a beer I wouldn't turn down, a real nice brew and it's too bad this is tough to find here on the West Coast."
"I've been drinking Prima Pils for quite a while and figured it was time to review it. Great brew! Thanks Victory!"
"D- Highly drinkable. This is probably my favorite summer beer. There's nothing like drinking Prima Pils on a hot summer day or night outside, its awesome."
"Overall, I was disappointed most in the smell, which for me at least, was fairly underwhelming. Flavor-wise though it was surely a vast improvement. You can tell these are quality ingredients, and I enjoyed the earthy and lemon zesty hops. Mouthfeel was also quite a bit more substantial, and still clean, dry and crisp."
"Mouthfeel is light with a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it definitely showcased the noble hops very well. A little malt sweetness and citrus helped balance the flavor out a bit."
"D: A very drinkable brew. Goes down nice on a warm spring/summer day like today. Moderate abv makes it easy to throw a few back."
"Poured into a clean flute from a bottle. Golden straw color, crisp looking with a medium head and even a tiny bit of lace. Smell was of hops, grapefruit and pine. Taste was high-end, spritzy and super refreshing. This type is what other ""pilsners"" hope to be. Mouthfeel was spritzy (my new favorite descriptive adjective) and drinkability pretty high. Crack open a few of these at a bbq and be a hero."
"Pours a hazy, honey yellow, with a tall white head. Smell is crisp and hoppy, some malt goodness. First taste is lightly toasted malt combined with good skunky hops that improves and finishes with a crisp bitterness. Finish lingers. Very good drinkability. Another victory for Victory."
"Pours a clear, golden straw color, with a good, rocky white head. Great pilsner nose: clean malt and piney hops. This beer has a good clean flavor, with the malt balanced nicely by the piney, grassy hops. This beer tastes exactly like a pilsner should-crisp, clean, flavorful and refreshing."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. Proper glassware for a proper beer. A good finger of decently lacing head and a deep yellow color. Nice citrus hops on the nose, highly aromatic. Great Pilsener flavor, slightly bitter finish, mixed in with some great lemony citrusness. Amazingly refreshing, highly drinkable. Masterful lager."
"Conclusion: If you like your American Pils to be full of German Noble Hop Character with a nice, crisp malt background, this one is for you."
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing. A nice drink on a warm spring/summer day, very refreshing."
"D - Easy drinking brew that is a great representation of the style. I really liked the Tettnanger Braumeister Pils better but this is a good one and I would definitely pick this one to scratch that quality Pils itch in the future."
"Prima Pils pours yellow with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit malty, biscuit malt in particular. The flavor is excellent, lots of juicy hops jump out at me with a biscuity malt in the background. Very nice, I could down a sixer of this easily."
"i think this is a great brew and i return to it time and time again"
"D- this is a highly drinkable beer. very refreshing... I opened this up after an afternoon jog and really enjoyed it! I am not a huge pilsener fan but I could drink this beer everyday."
"It does not get any more drinkable than this beer. Fantastic interpretation of the style. A great beer for my 100th review."
"A real treat, and very enjoyable. Thanks Dad!"
"As always, just a very nice beer..."
"Maybe they're trying to reclaim the term American Pilsner? I'll vote for that. This is great stuff, though it doesn't really fit in with the German or Bavarian style. Hooray for the new American Pilsner!"
"D: Nicely light and refreshing, but with enough complexity to really expend some brainpower examining its merits. Very drinkable and I'll be going back to this beer when it actually warms up in the great state of Michigan."
"Notes: I have a lot to say about this beer. First of all, it should be enjoyed cold, like right out of the fridge at 37º. The reason for this is it can't be enjoyed fast enough to prevent that unpleasant sensation that your drink is too warm. Second, I like Sam Adams Noble Pils much better. Finally, it just doesn't have anything going for it. It's a Pilsener with more of a hop taste than a strong malt profile, and as such I just can't recommend it over most of the ales I've enjoyed. Just wished there was more to it, something to further separate it from the mass-produced BMC products that boast ""Pilsener taste."" If this is how a pilsener is supposed to taste, then I'm not sure it's my favorite style. Was pretty hyped about this one, too...oh well."
"On tap at Jerry Remy's Bar on Boylston Street. Served in a standard pint glass. I wanted to order something that would quench my thirst while I ate my spicy buffalo wings. Clear yellow body. Lots of carbonation. Moderate sized white head. Smell didn't grab me at all. Taste on the other hand was excellent. Wonderful and light, it has all the flavor that a well-built pils should exhibit. Just a hint of malt and hops; it's the crispness that stands out. It's a lager, so it may lack a bit in my mind in the mouthfeel category, but that only makes the drinkability that much better. Low abv also makes this beer extremely easy to quaff. A nice fire extinguisher to my wings - a perfect pair."
"Oh so refreshing - spot on for the style and rated as such."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It's refreshing, but substantial in flavor. I could have another (and I might), but one is quite satisfying on its own. Victory Prima is a very classy pils."
"Highlights for me on this beer are the hops. Great hop aromas and very nice balance of good hop flavor while not getting in the way of the classic pilsner taste. As a lover of IPAs and good hoppy flavors this is a nice alternative and a good easy drinking summer beer."
"D: It's a good staple beer, an every day beer. It's light in flavor, has a reasonable amount of alcohol, but it won't throw you into a beer nap. Great if you like hops. Just could use a bit more carbonation."
"D - Very crisp and refreshing one of my favorite pils after a hot day in the yard"
"The lager for those who don't drink lager!"
"Fairly simple beer but drinkable."
"Drinkability: effervescent and refreshing. Quite a satisfactory brew."
"D- ridiculously drinkable. My fave pilsner going today. It absolutely cannot get any better than some Prima"
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is light. This is such a wonderful pils, has a very good character, flavor and is so easy to drink. I wish I had a couple more in the fridge. Thank you so very much boralyl, for getting me this."
"Goes exceptionally well with pizza and when drank ice cold is very refreshing and crisp. Allowing it to warm will bring out more nuances and even mellow out the bitterness a little."
"Very good, doesn't beat Noble Pils for me. Held to the traditional style, though slightly Americanized, being so voluminously and cleanly hopped. This should be a staple pils for one who can aquire it."
"Impressions: I can respect this beer because of its creativity and interesting take on the style, but it really isn't my cup of tea. I prefer there to be some noticeable maltiness, but with this beer there is little. Hopheads will probably love this."
"Overall, a good beer, though not my favorite from Victory. Ii liked their Golden Monkey and Hop Devil better, since I thought they had more complexity in their flavor. But, this is definitely great for a warmer day. Not too many notes on this one, just something I jotted some impressions on after a long Saturday."
"A wonderfl summer beer ... yes; but one that makes for a pleasant quaff even in amidst the doldrum of winter."
"I'm not one who is quick to reach for a pilsener, but this one pleasantly surprised me. Good job by Victory."
" I'm not sure how the hops would work with Korean or Japanese food, but it might be a good candidate if you're cooking korean ribs instead of Hite."
"D: For me this is a style I need to drink while I eat. Not quite interesting enough to want to keep exploring, but sharp enough to want something to balance it with."
"D: Drinking this is a breeze; it quenches your thirst and is a good sessionable beer with a big taste."
"It is very drinkable though, and definitely something I could go back for to enjoy a few of on a nice hot summer afternoon."
"Feel/Drink: Nice crisp mouthfeel. Drinkablity can't get any better."
"* 2 days later, I just started with Prima Pils and my impressions/rating doesn't change. Haven't had Stoudt's yet."
"Drinkability - High. As stated, I was not expecting to particularly like this going into it, but honestly, I could easily see myself picking up a six pack of these during the summer months. This is a perfect summer beer, with it both being sessionable and crisp/light. Not bad, not bad at all."
"Consistent taste over numerous batches but I have found that it does not always age that well in the case- so buy it fresh and keep it cold."
"D-amazingly drinkable, a nice healthy hop dose with a still very light body that can be enjoyed all night easily"
"It pours a very pale golden, yellow color, I had a fine thick head. it smell is mellow, you get hints of its hoppy & bitter nature. It taste complex. The taste is reminiscent of a IPA, yet its not. Its slightly spicy, and not to bitter. Its moutfeel is very crisp, a lot of very active carbonation. Drinkability, this is quite a nice beer. I could easily put several of these down in a row, however, I might tire of its hoppy nature over time."
"Overall: I could see sipping on a couple of these in front of the grill on a nice summer evening. A good rendition of the style, with some nice accents on the hops. As the bottle says: Prost!"
"Pours a hazy yellow, with a big white head and lacing that does not go away. Smell is of freshly cut flowers and a hint of clean yeast. Taste is an herbal, grassy flavor up front, with a hint of malt in the middle, and a bracing, super hoppy aftertaste. The bitterness clings to your tongue, and wont go away. As a huge fan of hop bitterness, this is wonderful. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, nice medium carbonation. Super drinkable, this is 'true pilsner' taste. I would love to get this again, but it will be difficult as it is not available in Oklahoma."
"Drinkability: This is Pilsner for me, the start and the finish. Victory has crafted this unbelievably drinkable beer into what I believe is one of the finest renditions of a really classic style. When someone is just starting off drinking craft beer (or beer in general as well) I not only recommend Prima Pils I'll go and pick it up for them. Excellency in a bottle."
" I will definetly keep this one on hand at all times(beer gods willing!) very refreshing and so easy to drink even my 85 year old mother has been known to slam a few of these puppies,sweeet!"
"Overall, Prima Pils is a very good example of the style and a very good beer. This bottle is a little old and I suspect it might be a little hoppier as a younger beer, but the hops definitely still let you know they're there. This is a great summertime brew session brew and I highly recommend it."
"I heard about Victory a while ago and was delighted they have expanded and are now at my store. Poured a bright golden color with a towering white head and hundreds of tiny bubbles ever floating up to the surface. The smell was wonderful with lemon, bread, pineapple, and other citrus. The taste was smooth as silk with a citrus zest and a good balance of hops. A perfect rendition of a German classic and quaffable as hell to boot!"
"12 oz bottle to a pint glass. Pours very pale yellow with a pinky-sized soapy white head. Big thick carbonation bubbles. Doesn't leave much lacing, but head stays intact nicely. Aroma is quite hoppy, light lemon + orange, still a bit of macro-esque lager smell which I'm not a fan of. Taste is really hoppy, definitely holds it own against many IPAs. Flowery hops, fruity apricot-like zest, nice warm bread aftertaste. Tart, fruity finish. Mouthfeel is good, not watery thin at all, lots of carbonation but fits well for this beer. Admittedly this is not my favorite style but I can appreciate it for what it is. Especially for the warm weather, I wouldn't mind picking up a 6-pack of this sometime. Price is pretty good."
"This is my new summer fridge beer, right up there with SA/NP. It's like all the BMC I ever had and I now am forced to ask myself ""why?"" when this existed and it is made fresh in my very own state! Brewery trip is now required."
"Great beer. Sessionable."
"Drinkability - This is a solidly drinkable beer. All the elements are there. It is perhaps a bit strong tasting to have more than one or two in my opinion. However, if you are drinking this beer for the flavor, this beer does not go wrong."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. Nice and refreshing. I'm a sucker for a good pils and this one is definitely near the top."
"D- This is one super sessionable lager. Finishes dangerously clean and goes down very smooth. This is a very delicate beer and easy to please."
"Pours with a 3 finger frothy white head into a light golden yellowish orange. There is a light hop presence on the nose with a yeast, a hint of piney sweetness and a medium lasting head. It is light on the palate with upfront pine hops, grapefruit, and light citrus. It is a nice adjunct free pislner, light bodied with a bitter dry crisp finish. This makes for a good session brew with nice but light flavors and short crisp finishes at only 5.3%"
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a clear straw with two fingers of white head. Fragrant noble hop aroma. Light bodied. Crisp hop bite with some toasty malt. Drying hop finish. Nice American version of a pilsner. Very easy drinking beer."
"Very good, easy drinking beer. Worked well sitting a spring training game. Nicely done."
"The lighter body and crisp carbonation make this a very refreshing, enjoyable, and drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is borderline perfect."
"D- pretty much the best pils I've ever had. A fantastic representation of the style. Light and refreshing yet full of flavor."
"very nice"
"D - Exceedingly easy to drink, very enjoyable. Would pair nicely with most meat and seafood, would be a great BBQ beer."
"D - The bitter finish slows things down but there's nothing wrong with this. Its more than a sip but not a gulp. I can do this on a summer afternoon on the terrace of my fave restaurant and nursing this."
"Top of it's class IMO."
"M: Medium-light mouthfeel, ample carbonation, and damn refreshing! Definitely a sessionable one, and one I'd highly recommend and looking forward to having more of!"
"D- I could drink a hell of alot of this beer and plan on getting more to do just that... cheers!"
"Drinks very nicely and is quite refreshing. I think this is the best pilsener I've had to date."
"I do believe I have found my favorite pilsener. I can see buying this regularly and I hope it stays available in the local market. Recommended!"
"Tthis would make a great summer lager. I can see myself sipping on several cool bottles of this while camping on a hot summer night. Shame you can't buy here in BC."
"Overall - I would drink it again but only when I can't get Noble Pils. The flavors don't blend well and that soapy flavor is kind of weird."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable, nice lemony pilsner that is one of the better American versions of the style. I feel it is in the group right behind Elm City and Oskar Blues. That being said, I could easily session this especially on a hot day."
"Pours a lovely straw yellow with a delicate bright white head and moderate lacing. Little bubbles trail up my tall pilsener glass as I take a whiff. Aroma is of sweet grainy malt, straw and, zesty hop aromas. Taste is even more zesty with wonderful lemony citrus, herbal and grassy hop notes. The beer has a firm bitterness that makes it nicely thirst quenching, though not as smooth as some other examples. The malt is definitely there, but is light and subdued. This pilsener is definitely showcasing the hops, but at the same time it is quite balanced. Light bodied with a perfect finish, this is a great session beer and one of America's finest examples of the style."
"Drinkability: Well, the easiest way to put this is that this is my 5th one tonight. I would pull the trigger on the 6th but I wanna save it to savor at a later date. Good beer. Very enjoyable. I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"Feels a little out of place drinking this in a snowstorm, but this will make a great refreshing summer drink. Very drinkable with the abv."
"Forms a nice fluffy head and has a pale gold color with good clarity. First whiff reveals a floral bouquet with a touch of lemongrass. Grassy, spicy and citrus flavors floods the tongue, forming a delicious palate. Finishes with a crisp dry bitterness and a slight metallic taste. One of best the pilsners available and probably the best tasting domestic version."
"Overall Impression: This is still my favorite Pilsner! It is also one of the best ""starter"" beerz for Newbeez!"
"Drinkability was OK. The 5.30 ABV was good but the flavor didn't do much for me."
"D- Highly drinkable. I know some people get their knickers in a knot over this statement, but for me, this is a great summer time brew. I'm a hop head who also loves a big stout, but not so much on the warmer days. This has a great hop profile balanced extremely well with the lighter malt, making for a great combination of tasting great and easily drinkable."
"What an outstanding beer fits the style to a T. It's wonderful to finally have some real pilsners available here to cast down the swath of bland euro lagers so omnipresent on LCBO shelves."
"Libation: Very drinkable and tasty. This is a very good pilsner, but not the top of the food chain. In my opinion the flavor falls a shade short while delivering a shade too much bitterness, but these are small nit-picks. I'll be happy to have this one again, as it's a great addition to a style that seriously lacks depth in quality."
"Outside of mass-market brews, I haven't tried very much of this style. Overall, a solid, drinkable brew."
"D - Excellent. Goes down clean and easy but with lots of flavor to enjoy. This would be great on a hot summer day."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Pours a very pale yellow with a big fluffy head that ever so slowly goes into a thin film with some lacing. A doughy aroma. Very clean taste with a bitter grapefruit finish. Very easy to drink, it goes down real easy. More for a hot summer day after mowing the lawn than February with snow on the ground."
"Beautiful golden color, great hoppy aroma with a nice clean and biscuity flavor. Another good one for most seasons and all occasions."
"Taste, begins to excel, reminiscient of Pilsner Urquell, but with a better hop quality to it, more grapefruit. A smidgen bigger heft to it. Grows on the palate, gets better. Extremely carbonated. Extremely drinkable, an excellent summer beer."
"Drinks great-something I would consider highly refreshing."
"D - This is a fantactic pilsner. well done all around. near perfection"
"A pretty decent old world pils, wish it were easier to get a hold of."
"As far as pils beers go, this is the gold standard. I've had countless pilsners, but I keep coming back to the one and only Prima Pils. Clear golden yellow pour into my Stockholm pils glass, one finger head that turns into fabulous lacing. Nose is grass, pine, yeast, and flowers. Taste is a crisp blend of floral hops, yeast, country grasses, pine tree, and mild breadiness. Perfect beer."
"Overall I honestly didn't know what I was getting into with this pils. Having grown up in the good old US of A it's hard to shake the bastardized image of an american adjunct lager being a pilsener. But I think Prima Pils has got the message across. I will definitely further explore the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 3/4"" white head above the cloudy golden brew. Head dwindles gradually, with lasting lace. Aroma is sweet pale malt and earthy hops. Taste starts moderately sweet, lightly citrus in the middle, with a crisp hoppy close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good."
"A most excellent pilsner, lots of taste with an emphasis on the hops, and very drinkable. At $2.99 a bomber, I might just start drinking this instead of water."
"Edit: 2nd bomber pour was much more heady, so i added .5 to my appearance rating"
"pours a golden yellow with a large pillowy white head. slight citrus notes and hops are present right away. very smooth taste, slightly biting and drying in the finish, some slight fruit. extremely drinkable. i am very impressed, this is really solid."
"On tap at Brick Store Pub. Poured into Victory pilsner glass. One inch white foamy head lingers for a while on a clear golden body. Aroma is a mix of a biscuity pilsner and a grapefruit. Comforting and lovely. Taste is similar. Just slightly and beautifully out of balance on the style towards hoppy but not so much as to upset the run of the mill pilsner drinker. Amazingly delicious and over the top smooth."
"A solid pilsner. I can't deicide between this or the Sam. This goes a little to the white ale flavor side vs. Noble Pils so it depends on what you are craving."
"Best American pilsner? Maybe. I have yet to try Boston Brewing's new Noble Pils and Boulevard's Pilsner is right up there but Prima Pils is certainly a nice beer. Its drinkable, balanced, and has an outstanding aroma."
"As with all of the U.S. craft beers in Ontario, I'm really glad this is available. An exemplar pils that delivers on the hops. Can't go wrong with Prima!"
"Definitely an impressive beer; easily comparable to or better than Pilsner Urquell. This isn't really my style of beer, so I don't think I'll return to it that often, but it's both excellent when evaluated to style and solidly good even if it's not your preferred style. A beer I'll likely recommend more often than I'll drink."
"Overall- The amount of lemon in both the nose and the palate was a bit over the top and detracted from the spiciness."
"Well carbonated, light, and dry. Thirst-quenching drinkability."
"Love this beer. Love it."
"Good pilsners are harder to come by than one might think. Subtler beer like these, that don't blast your palate off and wont get a lot of press, but still deliver, are what the craft beer world is built upon."
"As far as drinkability is concerned, I split a six pack and if there was one more left I would have drunk it! The flavor balance, the crisp, dry finish, and the mellow herbal hops all contribute to make this beer a very enjoyable session-able beer."
"D-i completely forgot how good this beer was and passed it up too many times. it brings huge flavor, sweetness with a touch of balance, and so easy to drink. what a sessionable beer!"
"As a final note I recently tried the new Sam Adams Noble Pils... That is one damn fine beer, and maybe the best looking pils I have ever seen. Try it if you get the chance."
"Light body, fairly low bitterness overall but somewhat bitter for a pilsener. The carbonation makes a nice airy mouthfeel. While not the quintessential pilsener, this beer is a great smooth, balanced, light session beer."
"Pours a dirty yellow with a nice two finger white head that settles down to a a nice lacing. There is a good cling to the glass throughout the drink. There are smells of malt of hops that form a nice even balance. The taste starts of in a malty sweet undertone but finished with some bitterness from the hops. Just like the smell there is a nice flavor combination that makes this a very drinkable session beer. Overall a nice easy drinking beer that takes little trouble to polish off a six pack. I first had this as a tailgating beer in the fall and decided to have this again. A very easy drinking quality beer. I will definately be getting this again."
"Is prickly on the tongue, very crisp, and finishes extremely dry with a hop bitterness that lingers, and lingers, and lingers... This is a very drinkable beer and one you could have several of in one sitting, especially on a hot summer day. This is what I would consider a little more extreme version of a pilsner and it's quite good."
"Overall, a great American pilsner. Hoppy for sure but in a great way. A classic and a worthy example as to why pilsner is often an underrated style. If you haven't had it, do so."
"i found this hard to drink. i've enjoyed victory brewing for the most part, and maybe i just expected too much from the prima pils, but i'm really disappointed with this guy. the other reviews seem to indicate that it is a top notch beer. maybe i just need to try another bottle."
"A very nice example of a style that, quite frankly, isn't one of my favorites."
"Not my favorite style, but solid overall."
"Drinkability: Very pleasant beer with a lot more assertive flavor than I was expected (it was welcome). This was only my second pilsner and I found it quite delicious and bold without being overbearing. Understated grace."
"Just a side note, this is an excellent pilsener but in general I prefer Stouts, Porters, Barleywines, etc. which I find to be much tastier and more my style, so while this is one of the best Pilseners I have had this is nowhere near my favorite beer."
"D - Very crisp and refreshing, like a good pils should be. Would be great in the summertime, after a day of yard work (drinking it in the shower). May have to start buying more of this puppy."
"This beer accomplishes the pils style as best as any I've had."
"i liked victory a lot when i first got into craft beers but the more i have them the more they seem mediocre at best with the exception of yakima twilight"
"D- This is a very complex pilsner, and has a great balance of malts and hoppy bitterness that seems to trade back and forth in your mouth. One of my favorite beers."
"Overall this is a great German Pils, im not a huge fan of the style, but this is for sure the best one I have had."
"At first taste, I notice more hay and dust like flavors, but still very clean and crisp tasting. Very light on the palate and carbonated perfectly for the style. Truly a refreshing beer on a warm Sunday afternoon."
"Well made and refreshing."
"M&D: very light & smooth, among the best pilsners I've had. Easy to session, but again this is not really my style of beer. Can't imagine anyone not loving this beer if they're into the pils style."
"One of the finest pilsners I've had in years, which is saying something because generally I find pilsners to be rather uninteresting brews. This one certainly inspired me. I'll definitely be back for a sixpack in warmer weather. A great patio brew, I'm sure."
"D - Very refreshing, and crisp. I'm going to cut this review short so I can finish this beer now."
"Note to Self: Ranked #1 German Pilsener when I tried it."
"poured form the bottle to a pilsener glass, had a big bright white head, that stuck around till the last drip. The beer has the color of honey, alot of carbonation. Smells of herbs and flowers, the hops bring the aroma together. the beer is nicely hopped with a medium body although it is lighter in color the body is not laking. this one is well balanced and goes down easy. crystal clear, refreshing and a very good beer."
"This beer is a slightly hazy pale yellow in the glass with a brilliant, dense white head. Nice, strong smell of spicy Saaz and Hallertau hops invade your nostrils and demand attention. Alternately spicy and floral hops dominate the palate and there is a strong but pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Quality pale malts are there but fairly lean and take a backseat to the hops fireworks going on in the foreground. A hops lovers Pilsner."
"Overall, an excellent pilsner. I'm not a big fan of the pale colour these German pilsners pour, but that goes with the style and I have no complaints in any other category. It's very refreshing and would be great on a hot summer's day. This beer is excellently balanced and the citrus notes added to the mix is what really made this beer stand out to me. Two thumbs up."
"Very enjoyable pilsener - my favorite to date. Very refreshing."
"This is a good summer beer, easy to drink, clean, but still has enough character to be enjoyable. Not my favorite example of the style"
"Picked this up to see why it was ranked #1 among German Pilseners on this site. After paying $9.50 for a 6 pack I thought that this had better be damn good for this price, wrong. Although a decent beer it is far over priced and over scored by other reviewers. Prima Pils was far to carbonated, its carbonation was that of Busch Light which does not boast flavor only drinkability. For the style it has too much hops. To me it tasted very similar to Summit Pisener where you can get 12 for this price. All in all not that bad but why people rate it so high for this style?? I would call it American style hop pilsener."
"Nice drinking beer thats definitely worth a go."
"Poured a clear yellow with two finger white head, spotty lacing. Smell: bready, spicy, grassy, lemon citric. Taste: grassy, spicy, lemon peel, leafy, lightly bready. Mouthfeel: light bodied, prickly carbonation. Excellent pils, hoppy and refreshing. Hadn't had one of these in a long time, excited to see Victory in FL."
"M/D- Light crisp body with medium carbonation, it went down entirely too quickly but would make a great session beer."
"Pretty damn sessionable if you ask me; tasty, clean, moderate ABV, and not a killer on price compared to some other of Victory's brews. Another solid one from the folks at Victory."
"I was very excited to try this beer as i have heard many good things about it. It is rated very high here so thats a good thing. It pours great and has good lacing. The beer has a great smell of hops and citrus. The taste is also good with mouthfeel and drinkability rounding it all up"
"Finally getting around to reviewing this beer after having probably several cases worth of it at this point. Too bad more brewers don't take a cue from Victory and make a hopped-up pils like this."
"D - Very refreshing and crisp, perfect with a spicy meal."
"It poured a pale straw color with a large tight white head; poured into a pilsner glass. The aroma is grassy with a hint of barnyard hay. The taste is like eating Saaz hops in clean water. I have to say that everytime I drink this brew it reminds me that simple for this style is the best, IMO. The body is light and crisp. A session brew worth having around. One other suggestion is that this a good clensing brew when going between contrasting styles."
"One of the best domestic pilsesners."
"This is crisp and clear, amazingly refreshing and thoroughly drinkable. This is a really well-made, spot-on pilsener. This is what beer's about."
"d: After more than 1,200 reviews, everything that can be said about this one has been said. World class pils, I can't get enough."
"D - easy to quaff, and extremely refreshing when you do so. Not bad considering it's the best tasting Pilsener I've ever had."
"Best American Pils?"
"Really Good Craft American Pilsner"
"Notes: not my style but its a good interpretation. light and easy drinking with good bitterness"
"Mouthfeel is good, but the drinkability is very high."
"It feels like this beer could have been crisper in the finish but generally I really enjoyed it. It makes me want to spend more time with non IPA brews. It's worth dropping my addiction to enjoy a wider range of beers."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0909-Sean, BJCP-German Pilsner"
"Very refreshing; crisp and dry. Medium bodied beer; carbonation is just perfect. This is my go to beer when i want a light taste of citrus hops when I want something a little more subtle than APAs. Cheers!"
"Notes: Not being a big fan of the style and noting that I like it quite a bit, this may not be for most pilsner lovers, at least those that may not be very open to the assertive hoppy profile. In that sense something more subdued like the Brooklyn version might be a better transition to craft brews, although this is by far the more attractive brew."
"Easily a session beer, too bad I only have the one."
"Big off-white head. Hazy yellow. Weird that a pilsner would be hazy. Looks like a witbier. Grassy and flowery aroma. Apparently this beer has been infected with brettanomyces. Definitely has a bit of a sour twang. Not really like a pilsner at all. I guess that explains the haziness."
"Overall, very excellent pils for those that like a more assertive hoppiness. Would pair well with spicy foods."
"In case you're not getting it, I love this beer."
"I love this beer. This is not your traditional pilsner. Victory loves their hops and it shows in this hoppy bitter pilsner. Its crisp clean with a distinctive hops taste and aroma. I typically drink IPAs, but because of the IBU count of this beer it is as good as a lot of IPAs. This beer also washes nicely from your palate and doesn't leave a lingering after taste."
"I am being very critical - yes, but this is a good beer, and an interesting one for it's foray into previously uncharted territory for a pilsner."
"D: Without a doubt the best pilsener I've had yet... and I don't know if I'll ever have a better one."
"Overall - A very American take on the European Pilsner style, at least to me. If you like lagers, and hoppier pale ales, you'll love this one. Cheers!"
"D - give me more. probably my ultimate summer beer."
"Definitely a great session beer, very well crafted"
"D:a good beers, a good craft beer."
"Drinkability is great. Its very smooth and goes down easy leaving a nice little bite on the tongue. I could definitely put this on my list as a nice session beer!"
"Definately stopping for a complete sixer on the way home.... very hard to find a good pils or lager in Chattanooga.... I guess you just have to stick with the staple(lowenbrau) or this nice upgrade for the same price... this is like Sam Adams Hallertau Imperial Light in terms of taste... excellent brew."
"Drinkability: About as high as a beer can be. This is a sessionable beer that is tremendously balanced and adheres to stylistic guidelines. An example of what a German pilsner should taste like."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: Highly drinkable but the aftertaste again really kills this beer. It builds and builds but never seems to fade and makes each subsequent sip more and more intensly bitter."
"12oz Bottle. Pours a very golden yellow colour. Very tasty and easy to drink. I could drink 37 of these and not feel a buzz. Solid brew overall, definately the best pilsner I have ever had. Then again I am stuck with canadian pilsners who upset me greatly."
"Poured a hazy gold into a pilsner glass, with great carbonation, three fingers of white head, and great lacing. The smell was decidedly floral/herbal Noble hops, with a dry bitter crispness to it. The flavor additionally yielded hints of malt, biscuit, and lemon, with a super-crisp dry finish. The feel was superb; light and carbonated. An amazingly sessionable brew, but since I've had this one, I've tried Victory's Braumeister Pils, which is even more intense and delicious."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice one inch head over slightly cloudy gold body. Very vibrant aroma - floral with a hint of lemon. Complex flavor and great mouthfeel. Complex flvors throughout your entire mouth. Very, very drinkable. One of the best Pils I have ever had."
"Not as impressed as other are with this one. Lemony, grassy with bananas and other citrus notes in the aroma which was the best part to this beer. Nice color as well. Taste and mouthfeel were average or slightly above for the style. I am not a big fan of this style but I scored it compared to others of it's style. Just not much to offer in the way of flavor or mouthfeel."
"Exceptionally drinkable. I wish it were higher ABV, but I'll definitely buy this again. Props to my borther Alex for picking this up. We are also fans of the Hop Wallop and Golden Monkey. Cheers."
"This beer pours a light straw yellow with a one finger of sudsy head that retains relatively well and leaves lots of wispy lacing on the glass the entire way down. Nose is citrus - predominantly lemon, pale malts and grain. Taste is very tangy up front from the lemon influence, balanced out perfectly with a grainy, biscuity flavoring, and finish lends to a mild pale malt flavoring. Light body, high carbonation, goes down easily, crisp body, clean finish and bitter aftertaste. I can't say that I've found a pilsner that made me love the style - this one does it, and an ABV that allows you to sit with it all night."
"Nice smooth, carbonated mouthfeel and a highly drinkable beer. I'll never drink another lager again other than this one!"
"D: Very drinkable. This is smooth and going down easier than my high school girlfriend"
"Pours translucent pale golden, with a big, rocky head, that subsides shortly, leaving a good amount of lacing. Hops dominate the aroma, with no real trace of malt to be found. At the risk of being branded a heretic, let me just say right now that I'm not really in the camp of the hopheads. I prefer a nice balance in most styles, so bear that in mind as you read on. Taste also is dominated by hops, to me, almost to the point of distraction. Hop fans will probably enjoy this, but it left me wishing for a stronger malt presence to even things out. That said, this beer showed classic hops spiciness/bitterness that some others would probably quite enjoy. Good, smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation for a decent level of drinkability. While I certainly didn't dislike this beer, IMHO, it lacks the balance to be a top representative of the style, in fact, reminding me somewhat of an IPA> That said, those with more of a fondness for hops would probably enjoy this beer immensely, and I think this conclusion is certainly borne out by several other reviewers."
"I will be the first one to say that the pilsener is not one of my favorite styles of beers but this one totally turned me around. This light bodied light golden color brew is a very drinkable beer with a very good German malt finish. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is curious about the style and would like to try a good one. I am glad my curiosity and hope for the style led me to this one because this is a good one."
"Overall an excellent example of the style and one i will surely be revisiting (probably tomorrow, since this sixer is going down!) One of the better examples of a german pils made in the united states for sure. An excellent refreshing beer."
"Its crisp and refreshing with a heavy dose of noble hop bitterness and a very sharp finish. There is some nice sweet notes in this beer but the dry finish that keeps you going back for more makes this one of the most drinkable beers you are bound to come across."
"I've had a few people recommend this one to me, and I'm definitely glad I tried it out."
"Drinkability: Certainly sessionable if you're looking for a decently hoppy beer and lower ABV. It is a good brew, but I'm not craving another one at the moment."
"Would pretty much drink this anywhere, anytime, with anything. Hot weather - this is your beer. Out with a meal - this is your standard. Easily one of the best pils I've had."
"Not a bad beer at all, just not my favorite Pils. It is not one of those that I want to drink one after another. Which is what I pretty much judge the style by."
"After reviewing two disappointing wheat beers this is more than a pleasant surprise. This is a god-send, as in mana from heaven, as in a miracle, as in better than water into wine. If your looking for a Pils style maybe you are going to say 'This ain't a Pils', however it's one f'n great beer. It's like a northern forest with a fresh pure stream running through it."
"THis is by far a good easy to drink pilsner. Another winner by the folks at Victory."
"O- This is an awesome pilsner. The Hops are not overwhelming by any means to the pilsner malt. Very pleasing taste. Will by again."
"D - Low alcohol, but the bitterness builds on you."
"Good body to this beer, and the carbonation is sharp. The drinkability is very high for myself"
"Victory blows by the competition once again."
"Note: Recently revisited for a formal review after many casual samplings. My palate has advanced where I can appreciate the subtle notes a bit more. Other pilsners like Sam Adams Noble Pils have out hopped this beer, but this is still fantastic. Score adjusted upwards accordingly."
"Drinkability: I'm no pils expert. Infact I'm lager-phobic, but this one had more flavor then I would ever expect. Its a bit like an american pale ale but with that lager crispness. Can't say if this is dead on for the style but, a clean hoppy brew for when you get tired of those Pale ales. Because its so clean and hoppy this is a super sessionable beer. Your mouth may end up a bit dry but you'll love every bit of it."
"Drinkability: Not much to say about this, its light, citrusy, and bitter, if you're a fan of those qualities you'll be all over this one. I like beers that have a little more malty flavor which this doesn't provide, but its not bad. It'd be good with a lighter but spicy meal and maybe cheddar cheese."
"Overall: A lighter brew from victory not my favorite by them as a whole but in the pilsner class its a-ok."
"Newly available in Ontario. Yellow, white half finger head. Moderate carbonation, medium large bubbles, some ribbon lace. Smell of fresh cut grass, soda biscuits. Taste is bitter at the outset, malty middle, tea biscuit dry finish is a bit tart with earthy tones lingering. Quenching mouthfeel, malt presence felt. Satisfying, refreshing yet substantial. Everything you expect in a lager and more, I would pick this up again."
"This is quite a drinkable beer, very well done pilsener."
"D-Great version of a pils. Seems more like a bo pils than a N. German, but who am I to argue. This is what american lagers should taste like!"
"My go to beer when I can't peruse a list."
"D- I must say I am impressed with this. I wasn't all that excited about it since they style is similar to a mass produced domestic lager, but it really has good flavor. Maybe has more flavor than Sam Adams Boston Lager. I believe I will buy this again."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear pale yellow color with a one finger white head. The head slowly goes down but sticks around and leaves some lacing down the glass. Smell is almost kind of grassy, don't know what else to say as I can pick up some other smells but nothing really sticks out. Taste has a bit of a lemon or zesty hint. Like the smell I'm not completely sure what else is there. It's not really bitter but it isn't too sweet either. Goes down pretty easily though. I've only had a few Pillseners before and I think it really isn't my style. I can drink it though I just don't dig it. I'm not going to rate it down because of it though. Overall it isn't bad, this one is better than some of the other Pilsners I've tried."
"A little over a finger of white froth over a relatively clear light golden. Good sticky rounds of lace on the glass and a thin cap of head retains. There's a huge hop aroma out of the pour. Fresh cut grass and a bit perfumey. It's really clean on the nose. Flavors are the same. This is a really straightforward and delicious pils. Fresh cut grass, and a grainy characteristic from the malt. No steel or skunked flavors, which is nice! Crisp and medium body. I appreciate not drinking a watery pils. There's some bready malt, honey, and even lemon citrus. I'd have many of these in one sitting."
"Overall: Very nice. Fuller mouth and hoppier than most classic pilseners, but that's a good thing. Whether they're hop deviling or hop walloping, Victory knows how to use their hops."
"A: A very light straw to white color with a thin layer of wispy head, no signs of lacing, there is a slight haze to the beer - 4.00, S: Strong sweet grain aromas, solid backing of pilsner malts, some earthy and herbal hops are also present on the nose - 4.00, T: Prima Pils has a solid hop bite for a pilsner, extremely grassy and green, grapefruit pith and dry, tastes a little grainy and there are some husk flavors - 4.25, M: A touch chewy, noticeable body - 4.25, D: Pilsners are generally not my style but this beer is a standout, hops dominate the malts, at 5.3% this is definitely on my list of best session beers and an ideal beer for a hot summer day - 4.50"
"Not only has Victory set the Pilsner bar for North American brewers...they've set it for the entire world."
"Bright gold with just a bit of head. A small amount of lacing appears with each sip. And sip I did. One glorious sip after another. Clean and full of hops. There was great joy in finding that classic pilsner taste that I love after cracking this open. The hops are potent, not over the top. The mouthfeel is crisp and tangy, balanced with a nice malt warmth. The finish is a hophead dream. The taste buds tingled with joy, allowing for a nice pause between sips to savor the flavor. Good stuff."
"Taste is amazing. Very smooth and hoppy. Basically it's like a Pilsner Urquell with some extra hops, really a good lager in the age of American Ales. Worth seeking out, and worth keeping a bit colder than most ales."
"A pale golden color with a small short lasting white head , small amount of lacing left . Aroma of light sweet malt and grassy floral hops , some light lemon notes. Flavor is crisp lightly skunky hops , lightly toasted sweet malt , a little spice and honey . A surprinsingly full body for the style , nice level of bitterness , crisp clean mouthfeel , medium to heavy carbonation, nice hoppy finish . Very sessionable and a good beer all around ."
"This is probably my favorite of the PA pils, although Troegs, Victory and Sly Fox are all outstanding as well. This one just has so much hop flavor that it's hard to beat. A great beer."
"A fantastic pilsener from the United States, an all too rare feat. Prima Pils pours bright yellow with a big white head that leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is fresh grain and strong, sharp, spicy hops. It smells like a wet barley field with a strong whiff of lemon peel shavings and apple slices. The flavor is fairly hoppy for the style, but there's a wonderful malt presence. It's a thirst-quenching beer that doesn't cut corners. The flavors are strong and crisp. This beer doesn't quite measure up to Moonlight's Reality Czech, but I'd bet the contest would be extremely close if I was working with fresh kegs of each. In the interest of science, Moonlight and Victory should each priority ship me fresh kegs."
"The beer is pale yellow in color, just like straw. Typical pilsner looking. The head is very nice but disappear quickly. Some haziness. The aroma is typically pilsner, malty with some cereal notes. The taste is the most intriguing. The bitterness is light. Thin body. Very refreshing."
"MF&D - medium body, with good ample carbonation. very drinkable and delicious, especially on a hot day like this!"
"D. Very easy to drink. A nice refreshing beer. A thirst quencher."
"I need to preface with I'm not a big Pils guy. There are some I like and some I don't. I'm sorting them in my mind. This beer is nearly clear, like water, it was impressive, amazing really. I stared at it for a while before drinking it. There is little to moderate carbonation, big head that fell away quickly. Smell is a little skunky, proabably not the best descriptor because the beer was not skunky. I can see why people use this as a good example of a pilsner, but I did not enjoy it. Sweetness classic Pils aroma developed or became more obvious as I drank. All in all, not my favorite but a great example of an American made Pils, think Bitburger when you drink this."
"I remember this beer being more forward with hop citrus in both taste and aroma, I last had it at least 5 years ago. Maybe freshness is in question, yet overall I find this beer forgettable."
"Drinkability: Very good German Pilsener. The hops work well with the traditional malty pils. Good balance."
"Pours a super bright, almost clear yellow with a super quick head and good bubbling. Hoppy, earthy, and grassy aroma. Full on nostril assault. Strong malt bill to start, then the sharp hop bitterness hits your palate in the middle. Theextra hops helps give a crisp, sharp finish with some dry toasted mlats as well. A great, flavorful rendition of the German pilsner."
"An exceptional pilsner. This is easy to drink, delicious, satisfying, and refreshing. More please!"
"drinkability is out of this world - a light refreshing beer with this kind of flavor i would never turn down"
"Hell yeah. This is great stuff. Extremely drinkable, this is a pilsner I would buy a sixer of to have around, especially for friends who aren't into the more out-there stuff that I enjoy. I've deleted my old review completely, I don't know what I was drinking last time but it's hard to believe it was the same beer."
"The taste is also bitter, overly bitter in my opinion. The malt tones down the hop bitterness a little. Light bodied, well carbonated. Fairly poor drinkability. Not my favorite Pilsener. I will avoid this in the future."
"D: I've never had a pilsener I've enjoyed this much, but given how subtle a style it is, I'm still not quite ready to incorporate it into my regular lineup."
"M&D: moderately carbonated and medium-bodied for the reported strength (5.3%abv.), this lager is in fact more like a well-hopped blond ale - for, the lingering bitterness and chewy palate in the end is more like that of a blond ale, which comes with pronounced hoppiness not usually associated with a German Pilsener, while the typical clean dough-iness is rather suppressed in face of the hop components. Overall, this American hoppy take on the style is not bad at all - very thirst-quenching, tasty, and well-crafted."
"D - Very easy to drink and a great session beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a one finger head. Aroma has a nice malt backbone to it, but there is also a nice hop aroma present underneath. The taste is what sets it apart, there is the malt backbone like most pils, however, this one has some piney hop character to it. There is a very nice flavor in this. The mouthfeel is a moderate carbonation. Overall the drinkability is good, this is one of the first pilsner's that i have had that had a nice flavor and some complexity to it. Very nice beer."
"I was looking for more head and lacing, but it is nice crystal clear golden color. Hops are crisp and in your face. Floral notes are all over the place, and bitterness lingers more than any other pilsner I've tried. Refreshing mouthfeel, and this could be a great replacement for BMC on a night of many beers."
"Drinkability is stellar - refreshing and well crafted. This is the American benchmark."
"Mouthfeel is refreshingly carbonated and this leads to excellent drinkability. Prima pils is a solid example of the style and I'm glad to have it as part of the regular rotation."
"D - Very nice! Easy to drink."
"Great drinkability. This would be a good beer to have on hands at all times. The hop presence may turn off some traditional pilsner drinkers."
"Overall this is an outstanding example of a great style and one of my personal favorites. Easy recommendation. Props to victory! Im off to the bat cave... urrr... beer fridge to grab another!"
"D: A good drinker indeed."
"crispy mouthfeel but just a touch grainy on the palate. very drinkable though."
"Could be a bit chewier, seems awful thin, but that only adds to the awesome drinkability. Surely one of the best pilsners on the market."
"D - Good, but not my favorite style or an excellent example of this style as well."
"Prima Pils being a great pilsner should shock you as much as water being wet. Not only is Pennsylvania renown for making some of the best German-style beers outside of Germany, but Victory is right up there amongst the best of that state's many great breweries. Besides, this brewery makes a whole variety of insanely highly rated pilsners, one of which, Braumeister Harvest Pils, is probably the best example of the style I've ever tried."
"D - A very well-crafted and tasty Pilsener. A great option for anyone looking for a cold, crisp brew on a hot day. While this is certainly not the kind of brew that will blow you away, it's very difficult to say anything negative about a well-made German-style Pilsener. Now, it's a matter of getting beer like this into our baseball stadiums and big music venues..."
"pours a nice summer golden yellow color with a great head and nice lacing it looks good on a warm summer night..the smell is biscuit and malt and noble hops..oh yeah the taste is crisp it has the saaz hops the bready biscuit sweet malts all balanced with noble hops is this an american pils? this is a really good pils that has it all well balanced crisp refreshing tasty easy to drink.... a budvar clone .. i like this one highly recommended well done for the style"
"Between light and medium bodied. Spritzy carbonation. Clean, crisp, and very refreshing. I think I'll have another now. :)"
"Flavor is also really hoppy, but almost too much so for a pils. I know the malt backbone is there because I feel it, but I need to taste more of it. The pilsners I tend to like the best are a little more biscuity, a little sweeter, but still bitter. A minor quibble however. Mouthfeel is creamy yet light. Extraordinarily drinkable for such a hoppy, flavorful brew. Quaff away."
"D- So refreshing and yummy. How could I not drink this all night!?"
"D - I guess this might be worth your while if you are local, and are into sixers. Otherwise, I'd avoid this beer. It tastes more like an American adjunct lager than a German Pilsner."
"Previous reports had led me to believe that this was a highly hopped pils, and while it is, the accompanying bitterness never exceeds moderate limits. The lack of balance I feared going in was simply a chimera, and this is a great marriage of hops and malts. Call it a lawnmower beer - its simple, clean, refreshing and I can drink it all day long."
" I wish I could get this locally, because this is indeed a perfect summer beer, and one I am likely to seek out in the future."
"This is by a long shot one of the best beers made in america. I know that is a huge statement but this is what beer is supposed to be. It isn't exactly a traditonal pilsner but not far from either. The alcohol content and hoppiness is a bit high but otherwise who cares...It's just damn good. Very well balanced but hoppy enough to please any hop head. Try it, you will not be dissappointed. Way to go Victory! This is my session beer."
"Drink ability is above average. Beer is definitely session able but a bit boring. Would drink again but not in a hurry to buy anymore soon"
"First sub-par brew from Victory and it wasn't even that bad"
"Nice to see this in Salem, Oregon. However, at $1.79 a 12oz. bottle and since not a favorite style, I don't expect to purchase frequently."
"I am not a pilsner fan, but this is the best pilsner I have probably ever had. Just as good on tap also."
"Drinkability: Damn good Pils; in fact, maybe the best. What else is there to say?"
"D: Pretty easy to drink, though you might not agree if you don't like hops."
"d- totally drinkable, could be sessioned easily, very tasty."
"Notes: This is a great example an American craft beer take on a classic Pilsener. The hops are bolder than there Euro counterparts."
"D - Extremely sessionable German style pils. Very nicely done, makes a great summer beer."
"D: This is one of the best pilsners I've had. Great flavor, but still light and refreshing. This would be great for a BBQ on a hot summer day."
"D: Enjoyable. I need to figure out what Victory's bottle dating system says for this beer before I buy it again, but I'll definitely purchase more."
"D: Like water, but not like Bud Light. This is like water that tastes good."
"This is a beer I could drink all day and be quite content tons of flavor, but light and refreshing. I've been waiting to try this guy for a long time and was not let down in the least!"
"Someday, an American pilsner will come; it's not here yet."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle like oh so many beers i've had before: golden yellow color, one finger head, fizzy, active carbonation...yada yada yada. The difference is in the aroma, though. As the head settles into a medium-heavy collar, an aroma like that of no other fizzy pale lager arises from the glass. Wait, that smells like hops! It IS hops, an abundance of 'em!! Citrusy (lemon) hops to be exact. Saaz? I think so. Ist sip has an initial hint of malt sweetness followed by those citrusy, slightly metallic hops. It's a bold, powerful flavor that gets more intense on the swallow & lasts long after. There is active carbonation on the tongue and a medium-light, crisp finish. So THIS is what all those BMC pilsner wanna be imposters are supposed to taste like, huh? Man, the difference is like night & day!! Drinkable? Hell yeah...all day & well into the night!! Bravo to Victory Brewing !!! Tell the big boys in St. Louis & Milwaukee that THIS is what REAL beer should be like!!!"
"D - A very nice and in-your-face pilsener. Has much more character than most pilseners out there. Easy to drink but the grassy taste may get old after a second glass."
"Beer pours a pale gold with health one inch head that dissipates to a white skullcap that laces down the glass. Beautiful aroma of earthy saaz hops, crisp burst of perfectly balanced hop/malt flavor with a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. One of the most refreshing beers I've tasted and an ideal session beer. A bit pricey at $9.59/six but definitely gives the Nashville market a bit of class."
"Besides Polestar Pilsner, this is my faovrite of the style. This is a perfect beer to be enjoying on this brutally hot (95F) summer day."
"This poured a clear pale straw color with white head. It smelled like lemon and orange hops, with cultured yeast and barley and caramel malt. It tasted like lemon hops and cultured yeast, with barley malt and a bit of copper and caramel. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter and sour aftertaste. Overall this had a nice clean flavor, but it lingered a bit sour in the aftertaste. It had good, fitting body and was very easy to drink. This is a good light beer that could be paired very well with a lot of lighter dishes, or it could simply be a nice refreshing drink on a hot day. (Otherwise, this style is not my preference.)"
" pours a pale gold with a thin white head, leaving no lace. The smells is somewhat floral mixed with citrus and of course, the hops. the flavor is mostly hops with a nice lemon background that blended to a comprimised bitterness and sourness. mild taste, light feel, and light carbonation, but great beer"
"Notes: This is a proper pilsner that Victory brewed. A true one for that matter. Cheers"
"This is what a pilsner should tast like. Personally, methinks Miller Lite should not be allowed to call itself pilsner. This is a beautiful beer with a slight head and carbonation. The hoppy finish is what puts it over the top. Although I'm not @ Victory now, I have a Prima every time I go. If Budlight has 'drinkability', we need a new way to describe the 'ability' of Prima Pils!"
"that clinging bitterness is just a tad too much, imo. cuts down on my wanting to have more than one in a sitting."
"Overall one of the best pils out there. When I'm in the mood for hops and drinkability I pick this up."
"Wonderful earthy hop fragrance; the real payoff is in the taste and mouthfeel: hoppy in an herb-like way with a nice touch of sweet malts. This is not your average pils by a longshot. It's scary how much of this stuff I could drink. Best pils I ever had."
"It redefines an otherwise neglected sort of default style of beer reserved for chugging or skunking. This is how beer--all beer--deserves to be made."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is good, hoppy smell. Taste is alright but a bit to hoppy for my liking. Strong bitter aftertaste. Feels o.k. in the mouth, and drinkability is pretty good. this is not a bad beer, but I didn't think it was near as good as the reviews here."
"Taking a sip, it tastes crisp, not too dry with a basic earthy taste to it. Swishing it about the mouth, the mouthfeel is miles ahead of other pilsners with flavor. It leaves you mouth tingling with a light sweetness and all around goodness. Prima Pils is highly drinkable and well worth your time this summer."
"Drinkability: Quite high. I could easily drink this one in sessions. I've tasted it on tap before, and I think I actually prefer the bottle as the flavor just seems stronger to me now. It's got a nice flavor that is refreshing and body that doesn't weigh one down at all."
"D-Good beer for a summer day, but not something I'd go out of my way to try again."
"D - Great pilsner. Enough body and flavor to be interesting but still clean and refreshing like I expect from a pilsner."
"D: Love the hoppiness. Refreshing without going overboard. Beautiful example of the style."
"D- Very drinkable. Good example of the style, although I personally prefer pale ales that will give me more flavor an complexity. Tried to keep in mind while reviewing that pilsners were all about being clean and crisp... so in light of that, this was pretty good."
"Drinkability: Tasty. I'd definitely recommend this among my favorite American examples of the style. I did have to shell out about $12 for a six-pack, though, which strikes me as somewhat ridiculous. Six bottles of Lagunitas Pils can be had for less than $10, and are at least as enjoyable. For me, a drinkable lager should not break the bank. I'm on the opposite coast from Victory, however, which may have something to do with the increased cost. Overall, this is a fine lager, and one I would love to try on draft. At home, it's not hard to finish the first, but it might be difficult to avoid having another."
"Appearance was clear, bubbly and watery. Not much going on at all. Smell was mildly enticing, perhaps reminiscent of a watered down light lager, but nothing notable. Not much fullness. Watery, full of unattributable light malts and a touch of hops in the mouth make this beer average, but not much more than that."
"D: Probably the most drinkable Pils I've ever had. Great stuff."
"Not impressed. Tastes a lot like a pilsner homebrew I dispised. This beer definitely isn't decocted so it's missing that malt sweet-note. Quite hoppy, although not spicy, but tastes very mild in all honesty. Definitely a clean beer, but I think I'll stick with Pilsner Urquell and Budvar. I was expecting the mother of all pils, but I don't think this one adds up to the hype. Good to drink, just not top-line."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Poured a pale yellow-gold with a two inch off-white head composed of tiny, tightly layered bubbles. Copious tiny bubbles present in solution and effervescing to the underside of the cap. Delicate strands of lacing were revealed as the head receded; good retention. Clarity was translucent. Nose was very subdued; perhaps some grains and a hint of citrus. Taste is predominantly cereal grains, but I get a bit of skunk in the mix, as well as a kiss of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel was light-bodied, effervescent and a little prickly across the middle of the tongue. Pilseners are pretty hit or miss for me, and this is a bit of a miss. Didn't hate it, but wasn't a fan either."
"This is a really great pilsner worthy by just about anyone's standards. Enjoy."
"Overall - An excellent example of a Pilsener and one of the best i've had... recommended..."
"Overall, pretty easy drinking beer. This beer is a lot better in the hot sun. I tried it inside and outside and I couldn't have it inside. I will give this a 4, as it is quite delicious on a hot summer day."
"Overall -- fantastic. Probably my favorite beer on the market. I like to see a hoppy beer that isn't too thick and gritty. Good job by Victory. The bottle is nice, but having this one on tap makes a world of difference. I've enjoyed it with Cajun/Creole fish dishes -- remarkable! I'd definitely recommend this to someone who finds IPAs a little too much to handle."
"pretty solid pilsner that hits all the bases but is particularly hoppedr. a nice bitter finish that potent but a crisp mint that sit there long enough to clean the mouth with food. a nice lemon pepper. apple, honey, and mild pollen nose. a nice body but not thick. a true session beer that doesn't get old very quickly."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and clean with god carbonation."
"Drinks easy. Had this out on the beach, and it was great! Very sessionable beer."
"Sunny, straw color with cottony head that bubbles happily for many minutes before fading. Lemony and citrusy in the nose, and also very lightly spiced with pepper (?), leading into a mouthful of fizz that feels great on a summer day. Hops are quite present in the taste but not so much that we enter grapefruit territory. A nice line of malt stays present throughout. Definitely a summer beer, and one to keep on hand. A tad more body than the world-class Weihenstephan lager, and no less wonderful to drink."
"Overall, the best pilsner I have ever had. Also, as a side note, my friends equally enjoyed this. A good choice if you are looking to switch your friends over to more craft brews."
"D: Wow, my new favorite Pils. Now, I'm not sure the German Pils I have had were real freah, but, so far, this outclasses any of them I have tasted."
"Drinkability: Very high - It is really mild overall, which is really pleasing in this style. I like the absence of the alcohol in the taste and the refreshing feel."
"If I could only find this on tap somewhere."
"Easily drinkable, only slight points deduction here for the extra bitterness. Overall I'm extremely pleased with this one, and in fact all 3 from the mix pack. I had seen it in stores, but had been reluctant since it had this pils in it... but then I checked out the reviews here. Definitely worth buying, and this one may become a regular sight in my fridge (along with the other 2 in the pack!)"
"Drinkability: Wow, this is a great session beer. At 5.3% and the light body I could easily see myself drinking a sixer of this over the course of a nice long day of relaxing and grilling. The hop forwardness of this beer really makes it stand out from all of the other pilsners I have had. This has never been a favorite style of mine, but when a beer is this good you have to respect it."
"D: Excellent for a hot summer day. Very drinkable, good session beer."
"D- Very drinkable...a really nice summer beer, well crafted, clean, true to the tradition of the Pilsner style."
"D- Really high. This would be an excellent six pack for a hot summer day."
"D- good session beer.. def get a six and kick back and relax on a hot day"
"Go Victory! I really love this brewery!"
"A total disappointment. Maybe this was just an expired batch."
"The aroma is strongly hoppy. The taste is moderately bitter, and the hop flavor is up front but not overpowering. The mouth feel is a bit thin, but i think that is expected. Carbonation is strong, but it is easy drinking. I'm not a big lager fan, but this is pretty good for hot days."
"Easy drinker, very good pilsner."
"D - A very drinkable/sessionable pils. Very fine example of the style. Nice beer."
"Pilseners have never been my favorite style because most of the ones I have access to are either skunked or oxidized or just plain flowery. This beer on the other hand tastes fresh and piney, it's boldly hopped while still coming across as a strong example of a pilsener."
"D- Although this isn't my favorite style I could get use to drinking this when I wanted something that would be refreshing and not a stout or IPA. I really liked this one and will be getting some more of it soon."
"This is very drinkable."
"One of the few beers I routine buy in six packs still. Great light summer fare and ultimate session beer."
"very, very drinkable. nuff said."
"D - Very high - I could have several of these without question"
"I found this beer to be the light version of the hop devil. It has the same great flavor that Victory puts in all their beer and just a little on the light side. I could see this beer being good for a nice social evening with several friends where a larger amount of beer will be drank."
"D - I could drink quite a few of these, especially during the summer."
"D- A little sticky (for me) to put a bunch down, but good to enjoy one or two."
"The feel of this beer is delightful. Goes down really well and is a really nice beer for a hot day. Something with some really good flavor that could possibly go well with a burger or other cookout food."
"Dr. Looking forward to more."
"This one is easy. For the style it's a great tribute to a difficult and perhaps misinterpreted style. It's the brew a lot of German and Chez Pils yearn to be. Nice pour, smells familiar, but that ends it right there from the norm. Nicely hoppy, not over done, spicy, but drinkable for nearly everyone. This is one great brew, a session beer, a beer for spicy food, a beer for BBQ ribs. It just gets it done. A hard style to compete in but this one will stand up to anything out there."
"overall- one of the best pilsners i've had. the only US pilsner I can think of in comparison is Buzzard's Bay Brewing Co's Pilsner. I've bought this one a few times and I plan on buying more. Highly recommended, regardless of how you feel about pilsners."
"This beer poured a clear golden copper color with a fizzy single-finger head that didn't last long. The smell is doughy malt wit some floral and herbal hops. The taste is almost all hops from the start to the finish. It starts off with some sweet malt and spicy hops that give way to some bitter grapefruit rind hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp, but the lingering hops really cut down on drinkability for me. Maybe I'm missing something here, but this beer didn't strike me as anything special."
"This would make a great cookout beer. It's extraordinarily drinkable; would match well with dogs, burgers, or pizza; and is a perfect beer just to kick back and relax with."
"d - all day long, if you can hang w/ the hops and have a thirst for something crisp and skunky look no further my friend, top notch german pils from an american co. i love it!"
"d: i'm not a big pilsner fan, but this was a pretty solid beer"
"Final Thoughts - Probably my pilsener of choice. Good American made beer."
"Drinkability- Amazing drinkablity, this beer would make an absolute superb session beer, I would have to say I honestly liked this beer alot more the second time around trying it, its a very well balanced beer with loads of hops but yet a nice malt balance, for a good session beer there arent a ton I would look at over this pilsner with balls, give it a try victory made me smile again was happy to see this at the local ball park,"
"Drinkability: A good effort on a German pils that is a nice medium body lager and a great drinkers beer for the spring and summer months."
"Very good Pils."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear straw yellow color with about an inch of pillowy white head. Smells of grassy hops, biscuits, touch of citrus, maybe lemon, toasted malts/grains. Medium in both body and carbonation. Pleasantly bitter, crisp and quenching."
"Taste was quite dry and the dryness emphasized the bitter grassy hops, which were front-and-center in the brew but NOT overpowering. Pilsners are about balance, and I feel that they got it dead-on."
"Poured from a bottle a fairly clean, somewhat clear golden hue with a foamy white head that hangs around for a bit. There is a light malt flavor with a grassy hop being more pronounced. It finishes clean, dry and crisp with a decent bitter note. Easy to drink and an interestingly different pislner."
"I'll admit, I'm not a pils guy. It was good, but not my choice of style to begin with. But, in the name of all that is just and good, I had to pick it up because I haven't had it yet. Will I finish the 6-pack? You bet. Will I buy it again. Probably not. But that's just me. Hell, I consider barleywines to be session ales. ;)"
"I feel like this was somewhat crimped by the time of year I had it; I liked it, but I could see it really being a homerun in July or so. I'll definitely keep it in mind as summer rolls around."
"Beautiful straw color topped with a head of pure white bubbles that fade to a thin foam. Lacing clings to the glass as the beer is finished. Light malt scent matched well with grassy hops. Very crisp taste and clean finish. Hop flavor of a true pilsner pairs with malt without overpowering it. Easy and enjoyable to drink."
"Drinkability is fantastic. Perfect year round, but especially on a hot day while mowing the lawn."
" Not as crisp, light or bitter as many pilsners. Would complement many food choices. This beer defies any particular purpose or occasion. This beer would be a good choice at any time."
"The nose is yeasty, biscuity and floral. The taste falls in line with the smell but with a hint of lemon, too. It becomes more caramelly and floral as it warms. The smell focuses more on the malt, and the taste is slightly more on the hoppy side. This beer is the definition of well-balanced and perfect for the style. It's light and refreshing, yet very flavorful; hops and malt are both well-represented and complement each other superbly. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, which lends to the drinkability. This is nice session beer and a great German Pilsener."
"drinkability: very very easy and smooth. I was ultra impressed"
"Overall Impression: A clean beer, in line with style guideline. Over all the beer was enjoyable beer to drink."
"Pours a yellow/golden, almost straw-like color with full inch head that didn't endure for long. Smells slightly citrusy. Grain, hops and some grassy floralness, some spice character too in smell. Seems promising. Has a clean pilsner taste. Occasional citrus evident, and slight lemon and bready malts noticeable, but kind of unbalanced with hops dominating. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy with light carbonation making it refreshing and crisp, and dries a little in the finish. Drinkable, but probably wouldn't go back for more."
"A brown bomber of Victory's Prima Pils pours a clear golden color with a nice cap of white foam above. Smells of grains and fresh hops linger into the nose. Quick on the palate and O so refreshing. A dash of breadiness upfront is quickly overtaken by strap of lasting bitterness. Slightly dry at the end which lingers from the herbal bitterness. A little more hoppy than the average Pilsner, but that, as it turns out, is not a bad thing."
"Drinkability: Very good, it's nice to see an American micro brewery doing such an underrated yet great style, probably because it is such a challenge to do. Overall, well done, it would be worth buying again."
"A decent, hoppy pilsner, but I'm not sure whether I can say I prefer this over Pilsner Urquell, especially since I can get 12 packs of it on the cheap at school. Nonetheless, Prima Pils was quite the fine pilsner, especially paired with a leftover slice of Pazzo's pizza."
"Overall, a good hoppy pils but I just don't like the overabundance of herbal hop which gives the beer an ointment-like flavor."
"Im not getting anything special from this beer, glad to have a six pack of it, but I won't be seeking it out in the future."
"Between the low alcohol and highly engaging taste, I don't know how you don't drink three of four of these in a sit-down!"
"D: A great beer on-tap, but I still like the bottle version better so that the maltiness is played up a bit more."
"Pours from the bottle a golden yellow with two and a half fingers of dense head. A few minutes after the pour, loads of bubbles still rise from the bottom of the glass, and head retention and lacing are remarkable. The smell, a spicy hop combo of grassiness and lemon zest, is sharp and enticing. Upfront, I taste the same flavors as well as some grapefruit, while a small, sweet backbone just appears in the otherwise quite bitter finish. This drinks very light and leaves my mouth clean and hydrated, all of which contributes to great drinkability. Hats off to Victory on this one!"
"The color is a nice, just slightly hazy golden amber. The head pours into a thick foam that settles like a pillow and leaves webs of lacing everywhere. Carbonation has a lively presence. The smell is earthy, citrus hops before a light malt makes its presence known. An herbal undertone is detected as well. The taste is primarily pure herbal hops with a pronounced malt taste. Earthy and citrus tones present themselves as well to add to an excellent balance of flavors. The finish is dry and lingers with a hops bitterness mixed perfectly with a hidden sweetness. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with a medium body. This is what it seems like the macro posers would be aspiring to. Absolutely drinkable. I'm not as familiar with the pils style as with some others, but I can tell this could easily be a standard-setter for it."
"Side note: I usually don't care for pilseners. I guess it too closely resembles the ""mega swills"" I was told was real beer through ads. This beer and a slim few others are changing my mind on pilseners and lagers in general."
"D: As far as I'm concerned, this is THE session beer. It's basic enough to knock back and enjoy on a hot summer day, but at the same time, it's interesting enough that you don't have to turn your mind off to enjoy it."
"Another great brew for Victory."
"Quite flavorful, nice solid feel, carbed on the high side which I personally like. Has a lingering skunkiness that overides the wonderful hops. Sorry but the skunkiness is just to nasty to ignore here. It just gives the overall experience a really sour ending."
"This is a great beer for everyone. Enough flavor for the true beer lover, but no so aggressive it turns away the novice. Also, extremely easy to drink a few. Enjoy."
"Very light straw colored beer that poured a nice head with good carbonation. Slight sweet hoppy smell. Taste is bitter and citrusy and the feel is very light to this beer. The bitterness lingers for quite a while. Reminded me of an IPA, but way more drinkable than an IPA. I can only have one or two IPAs before I get sick of them, but this beer is very drinkable."
"D - A tremendous and memorable example of the style... This one will definitely challenge your palette and could head to head with any Pilsner found round the world..."
"D: Overall a very nice beers. For a pils, this beer displays a lot of character and I'm a fan of the assertive hop character. The weight of this beer lends it to being a nice session beer."
"Plesant offering from victory however very forgetable. For me, not on the top ten of brews when one goes the the store."
"Not bad overall; drinkable, though overrated in my opinion and certainly overpriced."
"D: For the style it's highly drinkable, this just isn't my favorite style of beer. For a pilsner though I have not had one better and would drink it again."
"Drinkability: If you're a fan of pilsners, this might be one which needs to be sought out. It's complex and far more interesting than other pilsners I have sought out. Not watery at all. A very good beer."
"along with good ole Yuengling Lager (budget...), this will be a fine late spring and summer brew. but it's fine now as a 2nd day of spring brew!"
"Overall - Enjoyable enough to consider for a repeat purchase; would be a definite standby if the bitterness weren't so strong."
"Tap at O'Briens, pouring terribly so they really had to work for my pint. Poured bright yellowish and very clear. Small head that dissipated. Aroma was much hoppier than expected. Pleasant herbal hops. Hop flavor and a biscuity maltiness dominate the tastebuds and it has a long clean dry finish that is quite nice. Highly drinkable american hoppy pilsner, and a great go-to beer IMO."
"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a tall pilsner glass. The way this beer looks in a tall glass is fantastic, a beautiful clean golden straw color with a fluffy pure white head. Smell is a big hit of noble spicy hops. Some maltiness in the taste but well balanced by the hops. Mouthfell is light and refershing, just a little watery for my tastes. None the less, this would be a fine choice on a hot Carolina day."
"This beer drinks perfectly, nice and cold it is perfectly refreshing. Excellent beer."
"D= I guess if you love this stuff, you love it. For me, I won't seek it out but I'd gladly take plenty of it at a party or if it was what was being served somewhere."
"The beer was light with good carbonation. It was smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink. This may become a staple during the summer months or all year round. Probably the best lager I have had to date."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and light."
"Pretty bold flavor for a pilsener with a slightly dry finish. Soft malts give way to the dominant hop character. Lemon shines through. Excellent balance with the hop bitterness and citrus flavor. Crisp carbonation. Medium bodied. Highly sessionable."
"D= pretty high. Not bad for a pilsner. I think its a little too dry and bitter for me but not bad at all."
"Verdict: Prima Pils is a very solid Pilsener and another very solid offering from Victory. Rather unique and quite sessionable, this is well worth a try if you're in the mood for something light."
"The drinkability is what gets me. I followed the thread about how great this beer was to kick back on a day like the Super Bowl. I had one then...didn't like it. I'll certainly consider an update if and when appropriate."
"I usually don't like their beers, but this is the best one I have had from them by far. A smooth balanced taste that works in the winter or in the summer."
"D- All day, especially in the summer. This is a true German Pilsner. Low ABV with a great taste and a nice crispness to it."
"Pours a clear gold with a clingy white head. Smells lemony, very fresh, limes too, with a sweet maltiness as well. The taste is extremely well crafted: perfect balance of zesty hops and honey and grainy malts that finishes crisp but has enough body to let you fully feel and appreciate its flavors. Nicely done! Extremely refreshing. One of the very best pilsners I've ever had."
"Not too bad for a pilsner. Pours a bright yello with a nice tan head. The nose has bready malts, spicy hops and peppery yeasts. Taste is crisp and light. The herby hops add a nice component to this style. Body suits style well. Another good brew from Victory."
"Out of a bottle this classic German styled beer was a hazy golden color with a little bit of rising carbonation. The one finger white head retained nicely as a cap and left streaks of lacing. The aroma was very appealing, lightly spicy hops, big floral hops, biscuity malt and generally a semi-sweet character. The flavors were very fresh and 'bright.' It started with big floral hops, then went to dry biscuity malt and some sweet malt, light spices (cloves?), lemongrass and a bitter, crisp finish. Pleasantly sweet but not in a heavy-handed way. Marvelously complex for a generally boring style and excellently balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation medium/soft and the body medium. I have no problem say that this is the best Pilsner I have ever to date had (02/21/09), it would be an amazing summer beer and you have to check it out. It will change what you think a Pils can be."
"Perhaps I need to do a side-by-side, but at the moment I'd say I like this more than Moonlight's Reality Czech."
"D- Excellent, this is one hell of a Pilsner. Definitely worth a try...."
"Medium light bodied with pretty high carbonation. I love the presence of the hops in this beer. Very herbal and fresh tasting. Despite the strong hop profile the beer manages to remain well balanced, Delicious, refreshing and very drinkable."
"I've tried this before (it was on my list)... but not since early in my craft-beer experience. Picked-up a 6'er at TDL and figured I'd try it again. The change of pace from the dark ales is refreshing now and then. And what a pleasant surprise this one is. Beautiful bright yellow (slightly cloudy) in the glass with a rich body and decent head that disappeared quickly but laced a bit all the way down. Subtle carbonation visible. Smell was a hint of malt with a nice fruity/floral hops scent, something that continued with the first sips. Rich mouthfeel and malty body with a refreshing fruity (as opposed to piney or spicy) hops flavor behind it. No ""mystery"" tastes (as with some craft-brewed ""German Pilsners""). Tart, dry finish that leaves you smacking your lips for more. Something you could down quite regularly (and frequently) and never grow tired of. Will definitely find its way into my fridge all summer. Would be an ideal crossover for those friends who are just trying their first craft beers."
"From notes. On tap at Ginger Man in NYC, a generous 20oz imperial pint. Very clear light golden, modest head fades to film, no significant lacing. SMELLS grainy wiht some grassy and floral hop support. Not strong. Faint, actually. TASTES grainy, almost sweet, earthy hop flavor and modest bitterness. Pretty clean, crisp finish. Some mild lingering hop bitterness. FEEL is of moderate carbonation, light/medium body, texture is a bit more substantial than benign. DRINKS really easy. Light, but with plenty of flavor. Way sessionable and or lawnmower/family reunion, etc. Well done."
"Poured a bright light yellow with a nice white head that retained nicely. Smelled like a hops factory, no surprise there. Really earthy, mineral type notes in the smell as well. The hops dominate the palate at first taste as well, but start to share the stage with the mineral and earth tastes as you continue taking sips. This one really grew on me, it has to be one of my favorite renditions on a pilsner. Typically a pilsner is going to struggle to get and hold my attention, but Victory did the job. A really good beer, could see this sharing my boat out on the lake this summer. I didn't have it with any food, but I have to think it plays quite nicely with spicey foods."
"Mouthfeel: Continuing on the bitterness hitting you in the back of you mouth, this beer has a great mouthfeel. Well carbonated and the flavors hit you mouth in just the right area."
"Drinkability- I've really grown to appreciate this brew. It falls somewhere between an IPA and a German lager. A very good offering from Victory."
"D: super easy to drink and can't pick up alcohol."
"If you're new to Victory brews, this is a goo place to start."
"I liked this beer more and more as I drank it. This is a pretty solid Pils and quite easy to knock down."
"D - Average drinkability. Not a great beer, not a terrible beer, just ok for me."
"Pours a crystal clear gold with very little head. The scent is very nice. There's a sweetness there(honey?) with a hop stickiness too! The taste is great! Citrus hops right off the bat but then that turns to a honey-like sweetness. Then it finishes very crisp and clean! This is one of the go to light beers in the summer and I recommend this beer a lot."
"Poured from a bottle into a tall pilsner glass. The way this beer looks in a tall glass is fantastic. A nice decent head with nice carbination and a transparent golden color. Smell is a big hit spiciness of hops. Some maltyness to it but a bit overwheaming hit of hops. Mouthfell is light and refershing. Overall a decent beer from Victory. This is one I would pick up on a hot day"
"M & D: Crisp & refreshing, with a pleasant bitter aftertaste that begs for more sips."
"I love Victory beers so this one seemed like a no-brainer to try out. While it is my least favorite Victory beer I have tried thus far, it's still above average when compared to other beers out there. Kind of a lackluster cloudy yellow appearance, not much for lacing. Smell is sort of spicy with some European hops smell. Taste is of a lot of Saaz hops to me (not sure if they were actually used), very European taste to it... but also a little hoppier (I'm guessing it was Americanized?). Nothing special but a decent beer to give a try."
"Had on tap and it poured a straw like color with a foamy haead that was gone quickly. Smelled hops and than more hops. Taste was not what I was expecting and maybe that is because i'm not well versed in the style. My problem was the overwhelming hop flavor. Sometimes hops are over done and IMO this is one of those instances. Finish was almost metal tasting. Beer was light and well carbonated. Not my favorite beer. Probably won't come back to this one as there are too many other beers that I like a lot more. But I still think this is a great brewery...just not this particular brew...maybe the style isn't for me???"
"Mostly clear yellow body with a faint white head that dissipates quickly and minimal lacing. Has a distinctly sweet pale malty aroma. I'm not a big lager drinker, esepcially nto pilsners. This smells like a somewhat refined version of Heineken. More going on with the taste, though I am afraid not in a great way. Some nutty and tartness, but also a real medicinal feel. A good amount of residual biterness for the style, though lacking any definable hop-like citric, floral or earthy flavors. Light, effervescent, watery on the mouth. Very dry. For me, maybe the problem is the style. This is probably a great pilsner, given the ratings, but not for me. The flavor profile is very limited, and the bitter dryness, without any real hop or malt burst just gives the beer an unbalanced and unappetizing feel. I won't be back."
"Drinkability: With the balance of mildly sweet malt, its mild hop bitterness, and its overall freshness of taste I could drink several of these. I keep wanting another taste and find this Pils fresh and refreshing any time of year. Note: I find this one a bit temperature critical in the sense that consumed too cold the hop bitterness is strong. As the beer warms a bit the balance becomes better and it is hard to tell if you are tasting malt or hop or both."
"D - I'm glad I reviewed this five years into my craft beer experience. I can appreciate a world class lager such as this so much more. I'm thinking Victory should replace Bud Light in the drinkability commercials because this is a beer I could quaff all night long."
"D - A very good american pilsner, and is a great choice for summer and cookouts. Clean and crisp."
"D - Very good beer, true pilsener with good flavor"
"A fantastic pils, especially from this country. Great value for the price and easily can hold up its own against the european pilsners. Great balance ending with a nice crisp, clean finish. Love it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Appearance is clear pale yellow with a thin white head that dissipates to a thin lace in about a minute. Aroma is of hops -- very floral, quite pungent. Over the top hops pervade throughout the tasting of this brew. Initial hoppy spiciness gives way to a moment of mild malty breadiness and then floral hoppy finish. Hop bitterness sticks around on your tounge for about a minute. If you like a spicy/bitter pilsener this brew is for you."
"A good beer, but I had higher expectations."
"Drinkability- good. I've been wanting a good pils for a week now, and this is a very good one, so I could go through half the pack, if I'm not careful."
"D: If you want to session with a pilsener, this is good choice: flavorful, balanced, crisp and clean."
"Very good pilsner draft."
"Recommend."
"I can't compare this to other pilseners, but for my first one, it was very, very good."
"Drinkability: Keenly drinkable. One of the better American-corn pilsners around."
"(D) A very delicious pils. A standout among many."
"Overall: Best pilsner I've had. Perfect beer for a tailgate or on a hot summer day. Definitely highly recommended."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer with a light body and a nice balance between hops and barley."
"poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a cloudy golden color with thick white heading. Kind of spicey up front with a citrusy dry hop finish. Taste is very nutty with a touch of grains alot of hop tastes for a pilsner. Great lacing for a pilsner. One of the best pilsner's I've ever had."
"D - Great pilsener. Very drinkable and tasty."
"Very light yellow or dark pee yellow if you prefer, moderate cloudiness with a good thick head yet little lacing, bubbles large and dispersed. Sharp focus to the nose, wheat and field grasses, white grapefruit peels, emphasis on hops with zero roasted nor malty notes. Medium-bodied, not heavy but densely packed, quite dry with a refreshing grain and hops profile. Given its weight, has a remarkably clean and concise finish. Undercurrent of that white grapefruit/lemon citrus lends more twist. Appreciate the uncompromising bitterness."
"I could session the hell out of this beer. Very good stuff."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours a slightly hazy straw with a big white head that leaves very minimal lacing. The aroma is big on spicy noble hops, with just a hint of medicinal qualities. The flavor is what sums up a pilsner. There are definite notes of spicy hops, a bit of medicinal qualities, a bit of sulfur, and just a nice clean grainy quality. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is a great beer. I could definitely see myself finishing off a six-pack of this in a night and will be trying this beer again."
"For a pils this is a good drinker with more complexity than most I have had in the past. A good product from Victory."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a hazy piss yellow with a half finger of fizzy head. Smell is light and wheaty. Taste is very clean. All light malts, kinda buttery. Light, slightly dry mouthfeel. This beer really coats your mouth with maltiness. The aftertaste lingers for several minutes after each drink. Drinkability is high. Definitely an easy beer to drink."
"D: Very drinkable. I haven't had many Pilsners out of the realm of BMC, but this has to be the best one I've had to date. A very good pils."
"Probably won't drink it again. Just a very average Pilsener."
"D - Very easy to drink, could have a few more. For this style of beer, we should expect a high level of drinkability and this beer is right on. Could use a drier finish and a bump in malt character to further enhance overall experience."
"Very drinkable lager."
"D - Definitely drinkable if you are looking for a nice hop bite in a pilsner."
"Pours a very light golden yellow colored body with almost no head, white, but diminishing. And has a very malty aroma. An just okay hoppy malty smooth balanced flavor, with a slightly malty aftertaste. Just an okay beer, average."
"I am surprised by such a decent mouthfeel. It has a fluffiness to it that I enjoy. This has summer beer written all over it."
"D, notes: The bitterness/hoppiness is done very well with this beer. Crisp with very good drinkability."
" Overall, an excellent version of the pilsener style-Very tasty! Go get some!!"
"This beer pours a golden yellow with just slight bit of cloudiness and a light, frothy head. The aroma is very fresh with an earthy, grassy smell. Easily drinkable, a touch of sweetness followed by a small bit of bitterness. There are some flowery overtones but they do not over power. I will definitely be buying this one again."
"I could drink a whole keg of this it's so drinkable."
"D. This is a very session able beer, could easily have a 6 pack and enjoy my self. Ill be getting this again for the playoffs. Go Chargers!"
"D - This is a beer that has really grown on me especially after having it fresh on tap. It pleases me."
"Future outlook: I would have no qualms whatsoever about drinking this again."
"D- Extremely drinkable. This is what Bud, Miller, and Coors need to strive for in their beers. This has a perfect blend of noble hops and light malt to make a nice citrusy front and a good malty back. Extremely refreshing and a good session beer. I highly recommend this beer for parties."
"7/3/8/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"(rated May 2, 2007)"
"Taste makes up for the smell and then some. Crisp floral and citrusy hops mingle perfectly with a lightly sweet malt torso. Very crisp and refreshing. Good stuff."
"A lager alternative for hoppy pale ales. And a treat for anyone looking for quality craft lagers. Hats off to Victory!"
"A great beer for a light colored pilsner drinker to try something new."
"Drinkability: Its very very powerful on the taste factor. This beer needs some food with it for sure if you are going to session this beer. Its got moderate abv so you can have a couple of these bad boys but its a diverse and complex beer that deserves to be savored and appreciated."
"Hoppiest pilsner I have ever had, but still very good."
"drinkability is very high. I could drink these all night"
"A beautiful pilsner. Clear gold with a bubbly white head. The aroma explodes with hops, grass, and lemons. Clean, crisp taste that perfectly balances the malt and noble hops. Bitter without puckering. Dry, sweet finish. Very, very good beer. The Germans should be jealous."
"Drinkability -- Smooth, full, and yummy....thank you, sir, may I have another!!!"
"Drinkabilty is very good. One of the better pilsners available in the US. Biiter dry finish."
"Golden pour white foamy head. Slight hops pine, citrus aromas. Very surprised by the malt in this one, complimented with nice grassy body. Not overly carbonated with just enough body. Very clean and bitey at the finish. One of the best pilseners I've had to date."
"D - The pilsener is not my style but Victory has done a nice job with this one...I would drink it again"
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a SA pint glass. It pours a clear, pale, straw color of yellow with a fizzy white head. The nose is a bit of bread, and a bit of grass. The taste is crisp with a pleasant amount of hops. Nothing is overpowering-crisp, clean , and hoppy. Prima Pils has a dry finish. The beer is light bodided and easily quaffable. A good beer that should go well with most foods."
"Pours a light cloudy golden color with nice sized white foamy head. Weak aroma with hints of hops, wheat and citrus. Bland flavor of pilsner malt, subtle hops and straw. Easy drinking session beer that is a little too bland and watered down for my taste."
"Pours a beautiful light golden brassy yellow into the pilsner glass, with excellent clarity. Produces a sturdy 2 finger head which fades before too long leaving some absolutely gorgeous lacing in the glass. As far as the smell of this lager, there's not much to go by... it's very faint but whole flower hops start to come though, fresh grass, etc. The taste delivers a very crisp, tart bite to it. Some malt sweetness lingers in the back of the mouth. The good carbonation balances the hops and malt and creates a light easy drinking quality in this brew. Mmmm... I want more."
"Pours a clear pale yellowish orange into a pilsner glass. The white head dies out quickly leaving a few small fingers of lacing behind. Bubbles endlessly rise to the surface at a carefree pace, indicating a fair amount of carbonation. Smells earthy, grainy and a bit sweet. Tastes of hop bitterness at first, with the malts and a bit of lemon in the background. I'm also getting some very subtle notes of spice with a fleeting astringency at the very end. Mouth-feel is a bit above medium."
"D- Very easy to drink, this is thirst quenching."
"Tasted on 7/19/08."
"The best Pilsener I have had to date. Nice clean taste. Nothing really exciting about this. It is just good and drinkable."
"Overall, though I appreicate what Victory is probably trying to do - make a hoppy, craft pilsner - the bitterness is just a bit too harsh and out-of-balance for me."
"D- easily the best pils ive ever had. the blast of hops puts this one in a class of its own. the low ABV makes it very sessionable, this beer is great. another victory success."
"Notes: Thanks to ububru for prompting me that I was served the wrong beer. I am so glad that I sought this out again. I can certainly see buying this again. Victory's reputation has been saved! Updated ratings, of course, reflected in this real review. Prior scores listed next to categories above for comparison."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow color with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of cooked corn, hops, diacetyl. The corn overpowers the aroma. Taste is malty with a hop bite in the finish. I get some honey and some bready flavors throughout. Medium body, sweet almost sticky mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. Great pilsner I could see a few of these in my future."
"I like it, but it is a little too bitter for me, especially considering the light body, and it takes the hop emphasis a little too far for this style. At the same time, the actual flavour is rather light and almost one-dimensional, without the nice play of malt and hop flavours that I like in the style. I definitely prefer a little less bitterness, a little more balance, and more flavour. That said, it is very, very clean, somewhat tasty, interesting, and different. Additionally, although the bitterness brings down the drinkability for me, it is not so bitter as to bring it down too far and I still find it fairly drinkable."
"D- This is an exceptional german pilsner. I would call it a czech/german hybrid. I will definitely be drinking again, especially @ the 5.3% ABV!"
"Great Pils. If it were clear, it'd be almost perfect."
"I'm not the biggest fan of pilsners but this is an excellent beer (as a hops fan)...definitely recommended. Everything I've ever had from Victory is good!"
"Cheers!!"
"Doesn't really fit the style, but it is delicious."
"Poured into a 12oz glass, the head forms and dissipates quickly, leaves some lacing down the glass. The color is a lemony yellow with quite a lot of carbonation. The smell is not that impressive, citrusy hops mostly. Nor is the flavor that impressive, not bad but not great. Mostly the citus from the hops overpowers the malt. I really don't think this is a bad brew, but it's certainly not one of my favorites."
"4.0 D: Not a boring Pilsner in the least. This Pils thinks it's an IPA. This should keep you happy for a while."
"Drinkability is high. It's a solid pils from pour to finish. The first time I tried this beer I didn't like it, but I've since developed a better appreciation for the style. I'm very pleased I revisited this pils."
"Mouthfeel translates into a level of drinkability. Fair carbonation keeps the flavors from being too cloying, but you know what you are buying here (look at the label!). My drinkability numbers come down as this is very very good, but in the 2-3 in a row range. I just personally have a hard time heavy sessioning super hop-saturated beers. Not a negative, as it is intentionally off balance and heavy-handed in the hop department. Try it."
"With the Phils in the Series I may drink more than a sixer tonight. I could even go one per inning."
"D: Another superstar in the Victory lineup, which comes as no surprise. By far the greatest Pilsner I've had yet, these guys make an awesome big brew out of a style that is usually pretty straightforward. Definetly a brew you should get your hands on, you'll be amazed at the complexity this offers."
"This is now my go to pizza beer, and now that victory is now in Maine It may be my go to brew for next summer. Extremely drinkable for anyone who was wondering"
"Drinkability- Very high, this is one smooth beer!"
"D: Great on this slightly warm day. I'll be looking for this some more in the summer. I could drink many of these. Perfect balance between flavor and drinkability."
"Overall, a fine American pilsner style."
"D: one of my go to beers. i love to have this around because of the great taste and the lower abv means you can drink a decent amount. also very affordable price for a case"
"D: A really nice offering. The hops are really big, but it's not a one-dimensional beer. A lot of complex flavors at work that make this a very enjoyable and drinkable brew."
"Overall: marginal at best"
"I would venture to say this is the best American made pilsners I have ever had, and could easily hang with their european brethren."
"D: Good drinkability and good enjoyment. A great pilsner with an amped up American hoppy influence makes this case worthy and a great summer time drink."
"A bright golden color, with a white three inch thick head, that kaces slowly down the glass. A grassy, spicy scent, that is followed by a malty biscuity fragrance. A light bread and biscuit flavor starts out the taste. It then blends to a grassy and mild citrus bitterness, that lingers on the palate for some time. A watery thin feel at the front, it then gradually gains weight as it reaches the back of the palate. The scrubbing sensation of carbonation finishes it all out at the end. This is a fantastic session beer, easy to drink, great flavor, strong aroma, the low alchol level, means I am drinking several before the night is over."
"Finally I got around to try this one and I wasn't disappointed. Appearance is light and yellow with a bit of head and some nice oily lacing. Smell and taste are very good. Some dry malt up front and a nice hop bite at the back end that fades away quickly. Mouthfeel is good light in body and excellently carbonated. Drinkability is easy going, just like it should be."
"Bravo!"
"I'm not a pilsener fan overall but this one is fantastic."
" The drinkability is SICK, this is my ultimate session brew."
"Hands down, this is my all time favorite Pilsner."
"I have always been a fan of the Victory's beers"
"Pretty full bodied for a pilsner with medium carbonation...extremely drinkable."
"D- great drink, i love this beer, my favorite beer from victory so far. great brew."
"Enjoyable pilsener for sure. One fine session beer. Victory is one of the better American brewers of German lagers."
"A quite hoppy pils. The aroma is a sweet malt scent. Color is a light bright gold with good carbonation and a white head that drops down thin. Taste is somewhat bitter. Starting with a light body it goes down with a crisp feel. Finish jumps out as hoppy with some sweetness and then a bold bitterness with just a hint of malt."
"Pours slightly hazy pale yellow with a few fingers bubbly head. Very carbonated. Nose is crisp and slightly citrusy from clean hops. Taste follows with a great balance of citrusy bitter hops and crisp light maltiness. Goes down easy and makes you want more. I'd have had more if I wasn't full from dinner."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and pretty tasty. Definitely not your typical Euro Pilsener. Give it a shot if you haven't already."
"I first tried Prima a couple years ago and it was one of my first ventures into craft beer. With a lot more drinking experience, most of it limited to ales, I'd put this beer forth as a challenge to anyone who tries to malign lager as somehow inferior. Prost!"
"I'll drink the lot! This is how I want my pilsener."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass.Appearance is a transparent golden straw yellow with a thick two fingers of bone white fizzy head that slowly fell back to moderate lacing. Active carbonation slowly builds up a light cap of white foam. Aroma is classic pilsener, crisp and clean with that skunky hoppiness and maltly earthen undertones. Hop profile is more pronounced in the aroma than most of this style. Taste is more of the same, crisp and refreshing, grassy/floral hops, malt and wheat. Finishes dry and smooth, nice light skunky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little rough, but expected with a lighter bodied brew with moderate to high levels of carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding, clean and refreshing beer with great flavor, excellent session beer. Highly recommend, will seek out again."
"Feel is spot on, silky and easy to go down, very refreshing, carbonation is very pleasing and with the style."
"Pours a clear bright golden color with a small head that fizzles away with lots of bubble action. Smells very german. German malts, noble hop spice. Tastes of more noble hops, doughy german malts, extremely crisp, light, good carbonation, ridiculously sessionable beer. Terrific easy-drinker and highly enjoyable."
"D/O: This Pils is a hophead's dream come true. A sublime beer that is both over-the-top in terms of hopiness and yet understated in it's effect on the palate. You could drink this all afternoon and never become fatigued. I've not much experience with true GERMAN pilseners, but this one is certainly the best-of-breed among many fantastic PA offerings."
"Beautiful hazed almost white blonde with a medium bodied head. Minimal lace. Nice hoppy smell with hints of fresh doughy bread.Tastes like a good euro pils on steroids, delicious, fresh and a nice dose of hop bitterness that doesn't overpower the flavor. This is one of the best U.S. version of this style I've had. Very tasty and very drinkable. Outstanding."
"D- very high , this is one easy drinkin' euro style pils. Victory does it again!"
"200th review! Pilsner glass. Three fingers of bone-white foam sit on top of a bright golden yellow body. Plenty of carbonation bubbles make it glisten. Aroma of big grassy hops, a bit of lemon rind, and husky pale malts. Flavor wave of bitter, grassy, spicy hops, backed up by a crisp, dry dose of pale malt. Slightly herbal in the hop flavor, slightly grainy and cereal like in the malt profile. Bone dry on the finish, refreshing, smooth, full-bodied. A wonderful example of a Czech-inspired, American Pilsener."
"Three fingers of very active off white bubbles fade in minutes leaving dots of lace. Body is a glowing pure golden yellow. Nose is crisp with yeasty wheat and a lite hop profile. With first sip you get a clean fresh balance of hops and wheat. Very crisp and refreshing while carrying a balance of hop bitterness and yeasty sweetness. Smooth drinking. Carries a mouthfeel that is slightly thick and really invites the next sip. Super drinkable."
"D - Exceptionally good drinking pils and really well designed beer, definitely worth your while as a great example of a nice hoppy pils."
"Bought a six-pack of this at Green's this past week. I normally pass by pilsners, macro and micro alike due to the stamp that AB has put on pilsners. Anyway, I saw the reviews on here, and thought I should get over my view of pilsners and try this one out. I am damn glad that I did! Poured from the bottled into a DAB mug (running out of clean glasses). Pours a hazy yellow color with a good head that remains about 1/8"" thick throughout the beer. Smell is grassy, natural, and with German malt. Taste is much more complex than any pilsner I have had to date. Sweet - honey maybe?, grassy, malty, and finishes slightly bitter. This would make a fantastic session brew, and it might have to be a standard beer in my fridge."
"Pours a nice golden color, although with a ton of carbonation and it's a bit cloudy; has a nice bit of head with some good lacing. Nice malty scent, slight skunkiness. It has a good crisp malt flavor, with a bit of pepperiness at the end. It's not the smoothest going down from teh carbonation, but not overly rough."
"Overall it's a very solid offering. I wouldn't buy this a whole lot, but only because I like ales better. If you haven't tried this give it a shot, it's pleasantly surprising."
"This is incredibly drinkable. I think that for my first sunday football get together this year this beer will play a major role."
"Overall, I wasn't impressed, although I would drink this over just about any mass marketed lager. It's not that it's bad, just not what I enjoy. Maybe my palate hasn't evolved to this level of subtlety yet. I'll try it again down the road, and see."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, my first brew from Victory and it definitely lived up to the hype. I'll be grabbing a sixer of this one soon."
"This is probably the best pilsner I've ever had; I'm not a fan of pilsners at all really, but I find this one doing a great job."
"Thanks to swizzlenuts for this one!"
"This is a lot like the moonlight lunatic lager."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Hop bite makes it a little less than very good."
"Clear yellow color with little smell. Taste was surprising considering the look of the beer, not bad but not great either. While it was not awful I cannot see buying it again considering I can get Dead Guy or Two Hearted for the same price."
"This beer poured a bright gold with a big foamy white head that holds for a little bit but fades leaving a thin film the whole way down and lacing some. The smell is a nice mixture of barley malts and agressive hops. The taste is very similar to the smell with the hops coming out more as the beer warms. The beer has a good body and carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer one that I would love to stock the fridge with in the summer."
"D- extremely drinkable, a beer for the usual bud drinker and the beer connoisseur as well. Not my favorite style but you have to recognize good when it shows up though."
"Aroma is crisp with a friendly bite to it, sweet and hoppy could be more pronounced. Poured a very pale golden yellow with an enormous white pillowey head that left some impressive lacing down my glass. Clean mouthfeel that is wonderfully smooth which teams with the flavor to make this beer incredibly drinkable. Flavor falls right in line with a nice crisp and snappy profile. The hops (I believe saaz are commonly used) round out a lightly malted base creating a nicely balanced flavor. There is a beautiful easiness to this pilsner ( I don't want to call it simple ) which is what makes it so very good and easily enjoyable. Not my favorite style and for the price I will likely not re-visit this too often."
"D - Low ABV lends itself to being a session beer. The hops and pilsner style make this quite a refresher!"
"D: perfect beer after a summer long day, im looking forward to picking up a case of this beer"
"Wonderful drinkability. Couldn't ask for a better brew on a hot summer day!"
"D: One fine beer! Who says pilseners can't be flavorful. Insanely drinkable, good any time of the year and a wonderful American take on the style. I was worried that hops would dominate this beer but they play a well defined role in this beer, wonderfully paired with the malts. Tasty tasty stuff."
"Clear and nicely noticeable malt graininess and nuttiness compliment the foll bodied hop taste. Very crisp and refreshing feel. Leaves behind a perfect, slight twinge of hop bitterness on the palate, inviting you to drink more. Maybe a lot more."
"Cannot complain about Victory. Pours clear golden with a nice white head that doesn't stay around too long. Aroma is big floral hops with a grainy sweetness. Taste is big floral and spicy hops, with a citrus taste as well. Finished a little sweet, mild bitterness maybe with a grassy aftertaste. Always a good purchase."
"This is a great beer, it is light and refreshing and packed with flavor."
"Prima Pils pours a slightly hazy yellow/orange color with a monster foamy white head that leaves some sticking. The nose is very impressive and surprisingly large, lots of big fruit esters and (Belgian?) yeast. A metallic note surfaces as the beer settles. The big fruity/grassy character of the nose really transfers into its flavor, over all balanced, decent pale malt backbone and a dry hop profile, it sports a rather bitter but not offensive aftertaste. Spicy and farmhouse funky, this reminds me of a 'light' saison rather than a true pils. Light/medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation on the tongue. Its fairly drinkable, and would be great in the hot months."
"This is an absolutely world class pilsner beer and would compare well with brands from Europe like Stiegl, Warsteiner, Radeberger, etc. So for those of you out there that have shied away from that pale pilsner style, either because of what the macros have done to the style or because many times imports have that 3 months in a cargo hold taste, give this one a try. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
"Recieved in a recent trade, thanks Adam. Poured a pale yellow with a fluffy foamy head. Smell is very citrus, sweet grass and a bit of crisp lemon goodness. Taste was where this is at, I was so thirsty and craving a beer, boy this went down well and quickly, taste is very mild highly carbonated sweet on the toungue with light malt and a bit of hop bitterness not overwhelming. This is one good summer beer it goes down so smooth and really quenches the thirst."
"About $8.50 a six-pack"
"Pours a very light, pale yellow in color. A nice half inch head forms on the pour. Smell is malty with some underlying floral qualities. Taste is much the same, but with more of the underlying floral hops coming through. The taste is much better than the smell. Clean and non-cloying on the mouthfeel. This is a good pilsener."
" This beer could be drank at anytime and all the time."
"This is a superbly drinkable beer, light and crisp enough to win over Macro fans, but complex and subtly hoppy enough to win over craft-beer-only purists. It's hard to do better than this."
"Drinkability was decent - finished it pretty quick but I doubt I'd search out 6-packs of this beer simply because I have so many other options I'd go for instead of going to the trouble of finding this beer. If it was readily available without a struggle, I'd buy 6ers for sure but as is, its availability limits its drinkability for me."
"D: A little disappointed, actually. A real one at a time beer for me."
"M&D: Light body and suprisingly little carbonation, I would have thought that with the crispness of this beer, there would have been more. Drinkability is high due to the low ABV. A very nice summer brew. Good offering from Victory. Skal."
"Of the three victory beers I have had, this is my favorite. I could really just have a bunch of these on a nice summer day bbq."
"D: Definitely a quaffer. This beer is tasty, zesty, and refreshing. Best pilsner I've had yet."
"D: This didn't do much for me. Seemed too bitter for the style in my opinion. Good session beer nonetheless."
"D. A very good brew from victory, and one I will be having more of."
"D- very tasty and very drinkable. One of the best beers I've had in a while, this is a great pilsner, way to go Victory!"
"Drinkability- A wonderful and well made pilsner. I was surprised by Victory on this one."
"A yellow, almost seethru straw color with great carbonation that keeps a constant head. A hoppy aroma dominates the nose, with hints of grass in the background. A medium-bodied beer which holds well since this beer is all about the hops. Has that dry, crispy sensation with a bitter backbite but goes down smooth and tasty the whole time. Some sweetness derived on the sides from some sweet malts, and unlike some pils that are spicy this is more citric/earth-toned based. I'd have another one anytime."
"Highly recommended. I've only had a handful of pilsners but so far this is my favorite."
"D- This one could be drank all night long with no problems. Perfect session beer IMO. Also good introduction beer for many."
"Drinkability - this beer is an easy drinking session beer with a lot of character for the style. I would put it up against any pilsener from the Czech Republic or Germany - simply one of the best pilseners out there. It is agressively hopped for the style but that gives it a uniqueness that stands out. Highly recommended."
"D - Sessionable pils with lots of flavor. Very true to style, this brew is definitely a nod to the classic German pilseners that preceded the American craft beer movement. Prima Pils is certainly worthy of inclusion on Victory's flagship lineup."
"Pours a crisp straw yellow with low carbonation and a lackluster head, it was very quick to settle to a FINE ring. Smells of crisp spicey noble hops and not much else. Those same hops dominate the palate. Good carbonation in the mouth with a nice mouthfeel. Aftertaste is hoppy and tongue numbingly good. Best U.S. Pils I've had. I am yet to be dissappointed by Victory. ""Neat-O gang!"""
"Pretty good for a bottle that is six months past its date."
"Nice and drinkable. I've bought cases of this one on a couple of occasions, and I will generally grab it when I see it on-tap also. This is a stand up pilsner for sure."
"Overall for me hands down this is one of the top pils you can get. Top, top beer. If you like pils, seek this one out for sure."
"Overall, the second half tasted much nicer than the first to me. Ive been waiting to try this beer for some time now, but i think the anticipation got the better of me as I was hoping for more. I liked it, and would enjoy it in the future, but i just thought the flavor would have been more distinct. Abita's 20th anniversary pilsner was a bit better imho. But still a nice beer."
"Overall impression: A refrehsing, classic German Pilsner. Very hop forward but wonderful drinking and immensely enjoyable."
"D: Tremendous drinkability. I wish this wasn't the last in my 6-pack (and my first of the night)."
"I had high hopes for this beer, especially considering other pilsners that I found less than interesting. Overall the taste is a little strange, I don't know if it's a good example of a pilsner or just a heavily hopped one."
"P.S. - it should be noted that I decided to try this one back-to-back with Odell's Double Pilsner. Perhaps not a fair comparison, looking back, because the DP is bigger and ""badder"" in every way."
"Overall, good for a pilsner, refreshing and crisp."
"It doesn't need to 100 degrees as my original review said to enjoy this. Its about 30 outside right now and this is tastuing just fine."
"Great beer that has become my standard summertime beer."
"D: This is how it's done, kiddies. My top pilsener along with the Trumer Pils."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass, looked a golden yellow with small ½ finger head that fades but does leave lacing. Nice citrus odor possibly oranges. Awesome taste not what I was expecting, kind of a mild zesty hoppy citrus flavor followed by the wheat. Another summer classic very refreshing and drinkable. Don't make the mistake of only picking up one like I did."
"This is one of my favorites. You have to try one if you are a Pilsner fan."
"Smells very hoppy, herbal/grassy, very nice. Wow the noble hops taste very strong and spicy upfront, crisp and refreshing going down with medium to light mouth feel. Some maltiness on the back end but still its a hop beer all the way and a very good one at that."
"I am not an expert on Pilsners, but this is definitely one of my favorites."
"drinkability: extremely drinkable, this stuff is sessionable without being uninteresting. It refreshes very well. Just a real solid brew."
"Great beer."
"I hate using the word ""crisp"" given its overuse in marketing from big name beers but this beer's got a lot of crispness to it. That isn't such a bad thing. It's very much alive and wants to be noticed while you sip. I actually think this would serve quite well as a gateway beer along the lines of Sam Adams Boston Lager, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale etc."
"Very inviting. Very good pils."
"Drinkability: Again, very crisp and drinkable at 5.3% ABV. This would make a better lawnmower beer than a macro offering."
"Great pilsner... try it once this summer with some spicy food."
"D- Drinks quite well. You get what you pay for."
"D- I've had many German pilseners and this is as good or better than all of them. This stands up to ones I've had on draft in Germany and Switzerland with no problem at all."
"A good, full body for a pilsner. If it weren't so zesty to the palate I would enjoy indulging in more, instead of hitting something else."
"This is great beer from a brewery that hasn't disappointed me yet. Prima Pils i s crisp and refreshing with just enough malt and hop presence to keep you going back for more."
"Although a little on the bitter side for some, truly a great beer."
"Serving from a 12 ounce bottle. Appearance- very pale straw colour with a slight haze. Head comes and goes quickly. Nose- grassy spicy hops. Taste- quite spicy in the front end, which quickly dries out into an aspirin like bitterness in the finish. Malt is very clean- a little bready. Carbonation is medium. Its tasty- just seems too harsh for this delicate style."
"I thought it was interesting to see an American brewery go so gung-ho at a German Pils. I don't think I've had another American brewery's beer that really attempts it."
"Notes: I am not a fan of the Pilsener,but this will be a staple for summer. This was an experience in that I did not expect to like it so much. A surprise; and yes I can handle these wild hops,the question is can you?"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Dry and biscuity, the pilsner malt really takes a back seat to the spicy, grassy hop flavors here. Noble hops appear with even greater presence in the finish, biting and crisp with greater bitterness than any German pils I've tried. Body is on the lighter side and carbonation is spot-on for the style. The only thing that this beer is lacking is the clean finish that I commonly associate with a good pils; the oily hops take over the palate and linger for a touch longer than I'd like."
"D - Quite good, I like the touch of malt that seems to put this a bit above most pils I've had."
"...and this from the folks that brought us Storm King! How disappointing."
"D - Everyone talks about how hoppy this beer is but I think Troegs Sunshine or NG Home Town Blond are hoppier versions of German Pilsners. I would still drink a Prima as a nice refresher on a warm summer day."
"Normally, I can take or leave a pilsner beer. They simply are a little boring for me. However, this one from Victory is a crisp sharp beer that is so drinkable. Beautiful golden color right out of the bottle that tastes perfect in a chilled glass. Little bit of a an aftertaste brings down the score a bit."
"Victory was new to Georgia when I got this beer so it was an intial foray into their offerings. Now I get the Prima on tap at Trappeze. Had Pilsner Urquell not abanbdoned their traditional recipes, they would still remain my top. In our current state, however, Prima Pils looks prime to rise above."
"Maybe I just got a bad bottle, and maybe I'm biased against pilsners as a boring style to start with, but I just couldn't get into this one."
"Lightly hazy pale lemon color with a fuzzy white cap. Lightly lemony smelling with grassy, earthy hops. Much the same in the flavor. Nice medium body with pleasant carbonation finishing lightly crisp and dry. Very nice pilsner. Extremely pleasant, palatable, and sessionable. Definitely one of the best of the style."
"On tap at The Flying Saucer. It was a fairly hot spring day and after a visit to the zoo, I was thirsty. Served in a pint glass, the beer was a clear straw color with a thick white head. It was a little sticky and left some nice lacing. Nice floral bouquet. It had a pleasant hoppy taste that was crisp and refreshing. Nice beer."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into standard bar pint glass. Hardy pour yields one finger of perfectly white head with slight lacing. Beer pours an exceptional clear straw/amber with no sediment. Slightly floral nose, hints at the heightened hop character of this pilsner. Hops are very prevalent on the tongue, nice light malt character and candy sugar balance it out. Finish is clean. Bravo Victory this is a very nice pilsner."
"D-a simple yet well rounded brew,they just don't get any better,see ya soon Prima!"
"This is a pretty decent pils minus the smell. Would find this especially refreshing on a hot day."
"M/D: Light, crisp, refreshing, slightly prickly, but very easy to go down. A pretty good pilsener. Personally, I like mine a bit more ""Saaz""-ier, I think this one is heavy on other noble varieties. Still a very good beer for a summer day."
"D - Yeah, could definitely drink a few. Trying to expand my palate to pilseners and this is a nice start. Could enjoy some cold on a hot summer day."
"D- really dig this pils, clean enough for a lager lover and zippy enough for a hop head."
"Pours a pale straw color a good lace of head. Smell is mild and slightly fruity. Taste is very perfumy, sweet, and slightly bitter. It goes down very smooth but with some bitterness on the back on the palate. This a very good beer and completely different than an American pilsner."
"D: With the weather getting nicer I find myself reaching for more session beers. Nothing beats coming home from work and having a beer or two while the weather is nice. This beer fits that perfectly."
"D-Light on the palate and easy to drink. Very refreshing."
"Light and refreshing with perfect carbonation to make it drinkable all day long."
"M/D - Very smooth and crisp with excellent carbonation. A very drinkable pilsner."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a crystal clear yellow with a massive amount of white foamy head that simmers down to a thin mostly lasting layer. Aroma of floral hops and a hint of sweet malts. Initial flavor is balanced between hops and malt. No other flavors come out distinctly. Aftertaste dominated by the hops and hint of spice as it drags on. Some lacing, moderate aftertaste, light body, and limited alcohol noted. Overall a nicely done beer when in the mood for something lighter and maybe a good starter beer for people not into the bigger beers."
"The prickly carbonation serves to enhance the hop qualities. The pilsner remains very drinkable and light. A very American take on the pilsner style, but remains filled with flavor compared to the other pilsners commonly found stateside."
"This beer was featured in a ""Sweet 16 of American Beers"" in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. This was the overall champ, so I thought I had to try it. I think they picked a winner, though the piece was a little heavy on APAs (though the champ was not)."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color with a nice white head that has a medium body that laces the glass pretty well all the way down the glass. It has a nice light malty aroma followed by a nice citrisy and floral hoppy bitterness. The taste is excellent for a pilsner with a nice light malty backbone followed by a really nice citrisy and floral hoppy bitter taste that really rounds out the beer and makes it very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very crisp and clean with a nice slightly bitter feel. The drinkability is really good and I could make this a session beer that's for sure. One of the best pilsners I have had."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I've tried a few pilseners (of varying styles of that beer) and none of them has been remotely satisfying. This one is different. Goes down very easily."
"D: Lovely... my favorite pils right now... so glad its local and i can get a sixtel whenever i want this summer."
"D: Ideal for a session. This is one that you can only love for the season. If you havent tried, it is surely worth seeking out."
"D- goes down smooth and easy to put back. Love the pils. I have had it before with a lemon in it. To some people thatmakes it worse but i think it adds more flavor."
"d - barely misses the session beer category at 5.3%, but I could definitely see myself drinking a few of these. This isn't boring or too sour like some other pilsners. Great hops that give a great taste."
"This has quickly moved to the top of my list of favorite Pilseners, a real delight making me wish I had grabbed a sixer of this in addition to the mixed six I snagged. Fantastic."
"D - Great to drink a few at a football game, or while mowing the lawn. A well-balanced, and refreshing beer."
"D - This is a great German Pilsener and one of the better beers I've sampled. I really like this one a lot. T"
"Drinkability: This is a great Pilsener. It's very flavorful, and downplays the grassy, hay-like quality usually found in the style. It's got a great burst of hoppiness that is delightfully unique. Top marks from me."
"Pours a light misty yellow with a thin white head that faded fast. The smell is hoppy and floral, with some sweet notes from some malty characters. The taste starts sweeter with the hoppy notes and finishes malty. A good deal flavor is packed into this beer. The mouthfeel is great, smooth, medium body. This is an easy drinker, and very enjoyable. A great beer."
"D-Outstanding. An easy-going brew with enough authority of flavor to make a perfect session beer. Yummy."
"D - Victory products are great and this is no exception. A great pils."
"Drinkability: This is certainly a great brew, from a great brewery, and one that's brewed year-round? Am I Pils nut? Not really. But this is a damn fine beer, and I really want to try the staples and the real imports to see how close this is to an actual monolith."
"D: if i had been mowing the yard or any other outdoor labor prior to having this, it would have hit the spot. however, it was cold and i was at a bar and this one was enough."
"When I want an American-made Pilsenser, I think I'll stick to Trumer."
"D - very drinkable, very good beer. A well-balanced, refined, delicious, and refreshing beer from the folks at Victory Brewing Company."
"Drinkability: This is probably my favorite session beer, and is always in my fridge. The right level of alcohol and refreshment for a hot summer day (or any other day)."
"D - This is what all American Macro lagers wishes they could be when they grew up..a very good lagered brew"
"d: A great pilsner, wish I could buy it back home (currently enjoying the beer selection of Fort Collins on a job hunting voyage). Its hop heavy, don't know that all lager drinkers will like this fact, but I sure do. Good stuff."
"Compared to the fullness of some of the other Victory styles, this one is a departure from the others I have had. Being light, clean and crisp puts this a notch above average. I like it."
"D: Overall, this is a very nice pilsner. Not my favorite ever, but it's still a fine example."
"Seems a bit too hoppy for the style, but I like hops, so I can forgive. Great summer weather beer for hop heads that want something light and crisp. Will definitely buy more when the weather heats up."
"Pored into a nice pilsner glass and formed a decent head. The beer had a chill haze for a moment but that went away and left a golden crisp looking beer. The taste was hops up front with a light bread like malt backround. This would make a great session beer as well as an apertif."
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit it could be a session beer this beer is definitely worth a try sometime"
"White short lasting head, with a nice balanced smell. Decent amount of bitterness up front with a honey, malty sweetness following and a yeasty flavor. Good hop presence that fades into a semi quick slight bitter finish. Would try again, but not my favorite pilsner."
"Overall? TRY THIS... you won't regret it."
"M/D: Lively carbonation, light body, and extremely refreshing. Smooth in the mouth and very easy to drink. This is the Reality Czeck of German Pilseners."
"Pours a beautiful, brilliantly clear dark gold, with a pure white head of dense foam that remains a small cap on the beer throughout the glass. Aroma is hugely hoppy, with notes of green grass, some apple, and hints of alcohol. On subsequent sniffs, malt sneaks in as an afterthought. Flavor is hoppy upfront, with lots of noble character, backed by a significant malt backbone and a nice medium body to support the strength of the flavor profile. Overall, this is a very clean lager, with a nice clean tail, emphasizing noble hops throughout, but with a significant malt background. Did I mention all the hops?"
"D: Very drinkable, light and smooth yet very flavorful. A top-notch pils."
"Crystal clear golden color with nice fluffy white head. Excellent head retention. Nice lacing. Slight malty aroma with a hint of citrus in the background. More taste of hops than malt, with a nice hoppy aftertaste. Dry finish. Medium body with medium carbonation. Overall, a very good pils, but pils isn't my favorite style, so I won't be rushing out to buy more."
"Drinkability: Could drink them all the time. Might be craft beer's ultimate example of a session beer."
"Pale yellow lager, with a large thick and frothy pure white head. Elegant grassy hop aromas,lemongrass, pink grapefruit. Crisp, lemon, grapefruit sweetened with demerara sugar taste,small malt background, semi bitter and sweet at the same time. Nice drying palate at the end, but with a goodly hop after taste. A very drinkable Pils, slightly unusual but refreshing to the max."
"D: Very good pils. Light, tasty, extremely sessionable. No corn."
"Mouthfeel is full but never thick. Hops grow to provide a bracing finish. An easy choice for a session beer and one of the better American interpretations of the style I've had. Just further confirms Victory's place in my mind as one of the really underrated breweries in the states."
"Lacing lasted into the final sips. Haziness stayed throughout and flavors showed a softer side as the beer warmed. This would be a beer to consume at any time."
"Looks and smells like a witbier... pours a golden yellow color with minimal or no head... Smell is citrusy and very hoppy - nice, light, faint aroma which is not overpowering... Taste-wise, this is similar to a witbier, but with a very hoppy and slightly bitter aftertaste that stings the tongue after taking a sip... A different taste with alot of flavor and character... Mouthfeel is equally good and this makes for a very drinkable brew... My second beer by the Victory company, and I continue to be impressed... Although I enjoyed its distinct taste, the bitterness caused by the hops was the one characteristic that was uninviting to me... Otherwise this beer was great... Recommended..."
"A really excellent pilsner, and pleasantly unconventional in a number of ways. Pours a sparkling yellow with a minimal head. Has a strong, appealing smell of fresh cut grass and flowers. Taste is hoppy for a pilsner, but not excessively so, with a fine malt to balance it. A heavier mouthfeel than your average pilsner, with none of the ""watery"" body that plagues some pilsners. Overall, a very drinkable beer, best for someone who feels the average pilsner lacks backbone and is looking for something with a unique character. The best pilsner I've had in a long while."
"Overall a solid pilsner. Not my favorite style, but I can definitely appreciate this one."
"Taste is good and better than most pilsners out there. A bit of malt and a bitter, slightly spicey finish. It has a crisp finish and no aftertaste. It is also light bodied and abundantly carbonated so drinking it is easy. It must be a really good beer or else I was thirsty because it was gone in no time. Very refreshing."
"Drinkability: I could have a few more, easy. It is refreshing, but the hops are maybe too present for universal drinkability. A good American Pilsner."
"Pretty easy drinking, tasty beer for a summer day. Good representation of the style."
"Final thoughts  This is not really my style of beer but I can tell you that Ive had much better pilsners."
"The bottom line: Victory has put together a solid take on the style. This would easily be up into the 4.0 range if the finish was better though, as the front and middle segments of the taste are easily in that rating category for the class. Altogether, given the price this one probably won't be in my regular rotation, but I would try it again if I ran into it on tap."
"The mouth is crisp yet full. What a great easy drinking beer. This is a wonderful pils that is easy to match with almost all food types. A versatile, enjoyable beer."
"The prima is a light golden color with a little foam head that takes off quickly and leaves a slight carbonation trail on the side of the glass. The smell is very aromatic of flowers and the taste has a nice bitterness up front that mellows in the end of the palate. One of the better American Pilseners."
"Smell is fairly non-existant--the only thing i can really smell is some skunky suplhury notes which actually work to its advantage. I feel bad reviewing this as the hops have diminished quite a bit. I will definately re-review when i try a fresher one. Taste is somewhat dull--mostly malt but there is still a nice bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel could have used a bit more carbonation, most of my bubbles got used up in the swirling display of co2. Drinkability is good, very good in fact, especially if it is fresh and you like hops."
"Mild bitterness on the palate, could use a bigger hop kick to it. Engineered to appeal to macro drinkers, surely. Not snappy, kind of dull overall. Fuller than usual due to a nice level of carbonation. Simple and non-intellectual, drink by the six-pack."
"Drinkability: okay. I had a six pack of this beer spread out over 2 weeks and by the last bottle it had worn out its welcome. (3.0)"
"D- This is sublimely drinkable. It melds a lighter pilsener style beer with a flavor that is so well balanced and smooth it makes you want more and more."
"i got this one because it was the highest ranked pils on ""The best of BA"" that i could get; pours a clear pale yellow w/ a slight white head & good lacing; a nice floral hop aroma w/ some malt undertones; good hop flavor w/ a nice crisp finish good balance; a nice dry, light-med body, a really good example of a classic pilsner,makes my top 10 pilsners, but not #2 status..."
"To be honest, just not as good as a Czech Pilsner, or German Pils. Easy to drink, but when I think Pilsner, I am not going to grab a Victory."
"D- Again, I am not much on the strict, pilsner beers. But, if that is what you like, I would find this beer delightful. Not bad, but the harshness of the taste would get old to me."
"Very drinkable beer and one of the nice editions of the style on the U.S. market. Has a slightly bigger punch than classic pilsners, both in terms of flavor and alcohol. I like this beer a lot and glad I can get it here in Maryland."
"A decent thirst quencher, but not my fave."
"Very drinkable Pilsener. I felt it was better than most American-styled Pilsener's. It had a very, very crisp taste while being great in hop and malt balance. But for being an accessible drink, I felt it could have had more of stronger flavor than its light, golden taste. This was definitely a drink many people could drink that would be a very high quality beer. However, its lightness and watery feel left more to be desired."
"I'm not has a big fan of this beer as everyone else seems to be.It's a pale yellow with average smell.The taste is a strong bitter bang in the face.I'm assuming that this style of beer is not for me.It also seems that I am in the minority.So go out and buy one and judge for yourself."
"A near perfect pils. Extremely drinakable, with a nice flavor. A great example of what this style can be."
"Flavor is wonderfully crisp with perfectly balanced hop bitterness (very different kind of bitterness than the hops in an IPA) from start to finish, with smooth malt all the way through. Very refreshing and supremely drinkable and thirst-quenching. Exactly what I want on a hot day."
"I certainly enjoyed this beer and could drink many. Not sure why I haven't purchased it before, not the biggest Pilsener fan I guess. The bottle confirms what I thought of this on-tap. Good stuff."
"Excellent session beer to enjoy any time of the year. I am always impressed with a brewery that attempts and succeeds at brewing a world class pilsner as this is a very difficult style to brew."
"Lively in the mouth and damned drinkable. It's just so refreshing to have a beer *this* hoppy, but NOT using the PNW-alpha/citrus monsters. Too bad this is so difficult to find on the west coast..."
"Very tasty for a pilsner and I consider it one of the best of its kind even though not one of my favorite beer styles"
"Taste is surprisingly quite hoppy for a Pilsener. Herbs and spices make a strong presence here with a moderate bitterness. A subdued honey-bread, lemon candy sweetness follows up in the background. A bit on the light side, but clean and refreshing nonetheless."
"D - This is by far the most authentic German pilsner that I have had from an American brewery. The flavor and aroma are spot on and I am amazed that they would take the time to craft something this subtle. Stylistically, the only flaw is the somewhat poor clarity. German pilsner is by no means one of my favorite styles, but Prima is beautifully done."
"D- A very impressive Pilsener- the best I have yet to try in fact. I will have to start keeping this around."
"I really grew to appreciate this beer over the life of the six-pack. This beer makes a subtle first impression, but repeated exposure yields rewards."
"Pours pale and slightly hazy yellow with a little head, reasonable lace. Great aroma; lots of fresh cut grass, honey, and mint. The flavor is fabulous too. Very clean honey, fresh mint, and grass notes on the front. Finishes with bitter hop and lingering mint notes. Body is crisp, light, with nice carbonation. A fantastic pils!"
"This is a highly drinkable pilsener, and one of my favorites I've ever tried. I would wholly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a very fine pils. Good job, Victory."
"Feel is bitter on the tongue. Thick for a pilsner, and a bit sandpapery. Still, a clean finish; bitter feel but no film. Fizzy as it warms. It's a lighter beer with some body and rich flavor. Big-time repeater for sure."
"Pours a clean yellow with a small white head that goes away quickly. A sweet european hop aroma is there. In the taste, a dry pils and a nice hop charcteristic. An aftertaste of a dry end and every so small hop. A good body, good flavor, and hops. This was the beer that made me know that I do enjoy a good pils now and again."
"12oz bottle. Pours a pale straw without much head. Not too much aroma to speak of. Flavour is bit of a letdown. I'm not getting much of the Saaz hops that everyone else speaks of. Aftertaste does not linger as long as preferred. Pilsners certainly have their place in my fridge, but this one isn't standing out for me sadly. Based on all the glowing reviews, I wonder if I got an off batch."
"Overall, this is a really tasty pilsner. You could have really put this past me as being made in Germany. For an American brewery, this is an outstanding pils. That said, it stands up to the pilsners of Europe, but I would like a tad more hops in the aroma for perfection. However, this might be solely a function of the freshness. I bet this is fantastic at the brewery from the tap! This is another great beer from Victory, my compliments."
"Good, good beer."
"As pilsners go this is probably the best around, at least in my neck of the woods. It pours a golden color, a bit sharper than most pilsners. Smell is mild. It has that grainy pilsner taste, but goes down fairly smooth. Has a bit more hop flavor than most pilsners, but overall the taste is pretty smooth. Not the best Victory has to offer, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better pilsner. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I was hoping, but I think it's just because I don't like that grainy pilsnery taste."
"Noticed the flavor seemed muddy as it warmed. One of my favorite Pils, but I do prefer the bottles to this draught- would like to try a fresher tap though."
" This is a beer I will be seeing more of."
"I've had this beer a few times but just got around to reviewing it, recently bought the newly available to my region anyway mixed 12 pack of beers from Victoy which included (Prima Pils, Hop Devil, and Golden monkey). I poured this beer into a pilsner glass it poured a beautiful golden color that left a thin white head on top. The body is clear, clean, and left only carbonated bubbles in the glass. The aroma is straw, hay, grass, earthy rustic peppery hops that really make this pilsner enjoyable. The taste is crisp, refreshing, balanced bitter bite with a lemon and honey fruitiness to the beer. I love lagers and due to the main offerings available here in the united states they get a bad wrap but this one helps debunk the myth that all lagers are flavorless, watery, beers. Cheers to Victory for another great offering."
"High drinkability rating. Very refreshing. Great beer for warm summer days. Quaffable for sure."
"Pours a straw yellow with a one finger head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is mild with faint grains and earthy hops. Taste is exceptional for the style. Very hoppy pilsner with definite floral hops that cleanse the palate and leave a strong aftertaste. Easily the best pilsner I have tasted. Light body is good for style. Easy to drink. Very nice beer."
"Overall, this was not a bad beer, and probably typical for the style."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, especially on a hot day. I can see myself having a couple of these for refreshment. Its not incredibly complex, but if youre looking for something refreshing that still has some flavor to it, this is a good bet."
"Victory never lets you down as this beer pours a pale yellow with a great head that leaves a nice lave around the glass. Aroma is lemony with freshly cut grass and earthy hops. Taste is refreshing, crisp and clean; in a word: perfect. Taste is slightly citrusy and the hops really shine though, this beer is teaming with them giving the beer a nice dry characteristic. There a nice sweetness at the end as it goes down. Easily the best American pilsner I have had, something the boys back in the fatherland would love."
"D- This is hoppier than most pilseners and I generally dont get the noble hops in these quantities. This is however right up my alley. A very nice summer brew."
"This beer is tasty and refreshing. It is my first experience with it but I can definitely see it becoming a warm weather regular in my fridge."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good representation of style, I could see myself drinking quite a few of these over the course of an evening. I could also see myself choosing this beer to drink with a nice large meal. It’s a very good beer overall."
"People say it is great outside on a hot day, I would argue it is equally good indoors on a hot day with the A/C on full blast. Good anytime brew. Good job, Victory."
"Overall, I'm pretty impressed. It probably won't become a session beer for me, but on a nice day in a hammock, I'd enjoy it. Something to judge quality Pilsners against."
"I do enjoy a good Pilsner and this one is right in there with the better choices. It is a bright golden color with very active, medium sized carbonation. The head is modest but holds throughout with good lacing, very solid head. The aroma is pretty faint, just a bit of mild hops perhaps, not sure. The flavor is also very mild, not as definitive as say an Urquel or other European favorites. More of a wheat quality to the taste, a suggestion of lemon. No skunkiness here. Fairly light and crispy with a slightly creamy feel that delivers the flavor. Clearly a quality brew but I would prefer a little more flavor in this recipe to fully deliver. A fine choice for a refreshing beer, but I think you can find a few with more personality than this."
"Who would have thought? A pils with hops? After I had this on tap I've picked up a six pack and I think I may drink it regularly."
"I got this in the Victory 12-pack, and was quite pleasantly surprised. I first had this poured into a regular pint glass on a muggy summer day and it was perfect. The beer came out pale, pale yellow with a small head that lasted the whole time, though it left no noticeable lacing. Mild is the best way to describe the smell, with light malt and grassy hops. It felt just like a pilsner, at least my idea of one, should feel, with prickling carbonation and refreshing crispness. All four of these from the 12-pack went down easily on a sweaty day, and in not much time. Prima is as classy as a pils gets."
"D/ I have tried many Pilsners to see why I have been so down on this style. I must say this is hands down the best of the style. It beats Pilsner Urquel (the quintisential Pilsner) hands down. Still not an everyday style, but definitely a great example."
"Light bodied and easily drinkable. I could have done the growler myself but my dad and bro would not have been happy."
"D: Exceptional, very easy drinking beer, with great taste, only drawback is the price, $8.59 for a sixer."
"Pours a typical but attractive clear yellow, not much head. Aroma is malty and pleasant, seems to have a peaty hint. Flavor is fuller than that of most pilsners I have tried - mainly malty, a hoppy hint and a suggestion of fruit flavor, maybe apple. Jazzier than the typical pilsner, not at all watery - savory and satisfying."
"D- Very drinkable. I would have a hard time tiring of these, especially on a hot day."
"Absolutely wonderful. The best pilsener in the world."
"Score one for the Americans...12 oz. bottle in a willibecker...Coors light pall with head that wavers slightly...still, opaque...malt is noticeable in that crisp, welcoming bite that only a good pilsner can deliver...I wonder if, like Brewery Ommegang, the Downington brewers didn't take a few notes from a European master...perfect for the oncoming summer...I'd score this higher, if only pilsners weren't so unimpressively colored or scented... I guess God can't imbue beauty on everything!"
"D- An ok pils but I'm craving something more flavorful, even with the lightness of a pils."
"Cheers."
"M&D: Medium body and mouthfeel. Highly drinkable, especially in hot summer weather, which we still have in NC in mid-September (damn-it)."
"D: One of the best beers I've had. I'd like to pair this with a wide variety of foods. It's also excellent on its own, especially during a hot, humid day. Who would have thought a pilsener could have so much flavor? You'll be burping hops, but I suspect that's just what the brewer intended."
"One of the best Pilsners that have ever graced my tongue. Extremely drinkable and balanced."
"D-Very good, nice summer deck beer. Or post lawn mowing beer."
"At 5.3% ABV this is a nice light summertime beverage."
"D. Weak."
"Pours a clean, clear golden color with a bubbly two-finger head on top which sticks around for a while, but eventually subsides to a thin film over the top of the beer. No lace here to speak of. Smells clean and malty, like a proper German pilsner should, right? Right. You can tell just from smelling this puppy that you're not getting another macro-processed American pilsner-style lager. No corn in this guy. The malt is the dominant aroma here, but there are faint notes of cut grass and old shoe leather as well. Not much fruit that I can sense, although at times there are also faint lemony scents as well. The taste is malty goodness as well, but with a very pleasant hop kick in the finish. Very well balanced, with some subtle buttery flavor as well. And that mouthfeel? Smooth. Almost chewy, but clean and crisp all at the same time. A heckuva a pils for this side of the pond, no doubt. A proper year-round quaffable session beer. More, please."
"Great Job, Bill and Ron!"
"Eric"
"Im not a big pilsner fan generally, but must say Victory did a good job on this one."
"Very drinkable and suitable for a session beer."
"D- Oh so drinkable. Would make a great BBQ session beer and I will test that theory soon..."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is highly drinkable and would be nice to session"
"D- this is very refreshing cold on a hot day. It has a great summer character to it."
"Very drinkable. Quite nice. I could do these all day, and especially with such a great price. Ah yes."
"Taste of hops that are resinous and raw and make an European impression. The malt is present and is balancing the hops. The sulfuric notes I smelled are not coming back in the taste. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky. Body is light and aftertaste is dry and bitter. For a German pilsener this is a good attempt, but misses the fullness of it."
"Pours a clear straw color with a fantastic rocky white head that left very nice lacing on the glass. The smell is of grassy hops, a touch piney. Hops hit on the taste right away, stronger than most pils, has a dry cracker like malt taste the follows. The brew ends a bit bitter and dry but not bad. The feel is a little watery but crisp and refreshing, a tad too dry from my liking. A very drinkable pils, one of the best on this side and the other side of the pond."
"If you have a freind that only drinks bud l.t they might even go wow!"
"Drinkability: I didn't think pilsners could be this full of flavor. I need to rethink my stance. This is the thinking mans pilsner."
"Pours a slightly chill hazed golden color which then turns into a clear pale goal as it warms up. The head is thin with tiny bubbles and goes away very fast. The smell I get is almost of the belgian pale ale variety. A little tart, fruity, and a very tiny amount of hops. The taste starts with a big hop bite, which leads into a fruity finish and a pronounced hop bitterness. Drinkability is much better on the warmer side, as the carbonation + hop bitterness isn't so harsh. Better than I remember it being the first time I had it."
"Smell was mild, but defined. In other words, there was a handful of nice smells that were both expected and identifiable, but they weren't obscene or assertive like ""background music"" played too loudly. This was pleasant and enjoyable with its mildly spicy hops and ""gently sweet"" malt. A session beer for sure. I could drink several of these. Especially with its pleasantly bitter finish. This seemed very well balanced and very easy to drink. I'll probably make this a staple around the house now that Victory is available in Atl."
"O - It's hard to imagine being more impressed. This brew has it all. It's light and quenching but hoppy and dry. It has an uncharacteristic complexity that gives an often rare start, body and finish to it, but it's also incredibly well-balanced and no one component goes over the top. In addition, it wants to be consumed with food. Wow. This beer lives up to the hype and then some. A new standard."
"#200"
"D: This is the perfect brew to enjoy during the summer months. A very clean and refreshing beer that quenchs the thirst. Recommended."
"Pours a light golden color, a little head, big bubbles that disappear. Nose is mild - just a touch of crisp hops, but mostly a lot of sweet malt. Taste is a little gravelly - a good amount of sweet malt through first. Then some strong - almost astringent bite on the tongue. Tight, strongly bitter hops show up as the beer continues. It's almost pointedly harsh, and not particularly flavorful or interesting. It chills out a little as it goes down, but it's still a little rough, and not really too appetizing. Did I get a bad bottle?"
"Prima Pils on tap at the Falling Rock. The beer was golden yellow and clear. The head was white and loosely packed. The smell was earthy, dirty, hops. Some mineral too. The taste was also very earthy and slightly crisp. This might be really good for the style but I don't like lagers so I don't know. This was a good choice for a hot day however."
"Could drink these fast, or slow, all night. A little pricey in Chicago, but well worth it. Outstanding."
"So this is what a Pilsener is supposed to taste like. I think every time I've had a Pilsener, it's been of the bland variety. Fairly standard appearance, but still good. The flavor is pretty full, but the body is surprisingly light. I'm honestly at a lost for words on how to describe the flavor. It's not really a style I'm used to, but good beer is good beer."
"Pours a dull straw color with a slight haze. Displays a dense soap-bubble head; a full fist in hieght, shows decent retention and some spotty lacing. Lemon and citric hop notes are the most obvious aromas, with a light Pilsener malt backing and mild floral hop tones. The first sip is full of pale malt sweetness and sharp pilsener malt. Exhibits a clean lager profile, free from any noticeable off-flavors or yeast by-products. Aftertaste is struck with lemon/orange flavored alpha oils and a background floral Hallertau taste. Solid bitterness is balancing but not aggressive. Med-light mouthfeel with a gentle but crisp carbonation that allows a refreshing and effervescent mouthfeel, yet does not drown out the subtle malt and hop character with too much fizz. Finishes light with minimal buiscuity residues and a mellow lemon/floral hop flavor. A Damn fine Pils with outstanding drinkability and a testament to American efforts to re-create old-world styles."
"Poured into a pilsner glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a clear straw, with lots of carbonation. The aroma is very skunky, with a slight hint of malt. The taste is a nice citrusy hop flavor up front, followed by a not so great grainy finish. Not much in the middle. Light mouthfeel. A very sessionable pilsner. Overall, I was a little let down by this one. Victory is an incredible brewer, so I was a little dissappointed that it didnt measure up to their other brews, IMO. An okay beer, but not worth paying almost $9 a sixer."
"This is a very good pilsner and very sessionable. Enjoy this one!"
"Taste is, wow....unexpected. This is extremely tasty! The hop character is so pronounced and unique and unlike anything I've had. Hop character is decidedly herbal and a little piney too, with a bit of floral grassiness. Crisp crackery malt character as well, slight nuttiness in the background. Body is light and finishes welcomingly dry. This an exceptional example of a pilsener, and drinkable all night long. It's a beautiful day outside, and I wish I had more than one, I'll tell you that."
"As anticipated, this was a very nice example of a Pilsener. Solid, balanced flavor. You could drink many of these, I could drink many of these. We all could drink many..."
"Don't drink and review."
"Highly recommended"
"Drinkability: this is a great summer pilsner. very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Light in body, and very smooth, this is very drinkable on warm spring and summer days. Probably one of the best pilsners I have had."
"Highly recommended. A very nice pilsener - possibly the best American one I've had."
"A tad skunky with the finish."
"Although this isnt my favorite style of beer, this is a hell of a pils. I am starting to develop an appreciation for the lighter session beers, and along with the likes of Hoegaarden, Franziskaner, and Firestone Pale, this one is up there."
"If you need a change from the big dark extreme beasts, this one would be a really good choice. If you just want a great American-made pils, something actually made with some pride, again this is a great pick. And for sessioning, this works too. Great drinkability, and an excellent way to welcome in the warmer seasons."
"One of the hoppiest pilsners out there. Highy recommended. Think of it as an artistically brewed Miller Lite with quality ingredients and a caring hand. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and very smooth. ABV is perfect. Highly drinkable, especially in warm weather. Overall, this is a good beer. It's everything that I wish the American macros could be. Recommended."
"This beer poured a golden straw color with a forthy tall white head. There is a sweet hop floral smell. The head lasts for a while with a nice bit left for the whole drink. It starts with a good bit of carbonation, that dies to a nice bubble from the bottom action. The taste is very clean. Its incredibly smooth with hints of hoppyness and a little sweetness. The hops come in more on the finish. It has a nice light to medium mouthfeel that is very smooth and pleasant. Very drinkable due to its crisp light yet flavorful body. Very good pilsner."
"Overall a very good example of a Pilsner. Victory has done a good job of making a beer that offers a lot in a style that can sometimes be very boring."
"cheers!"
"Prima Pils poured a very bubbly pale lemon yellow color with a cloud like 1 finger head of white fluffy foam. It had excellent retention. It lasted the entire duration of the beer's life in my glass and whenever the beer lowered, the head of foam left behind tons of white sticky lace around the glass. It had a subtle aroma of malted grass, peppery hops, a touch of grapefruit, and just the slightest hint of toasted malts at the end. The taste was clean and refreshing with citrus and herbal hops, a dash of pepper, a dab of dried grapefruit, and just the slightest hint of toasted malts in the background. The mouthfeel was light and not too dry with a mild aftertaste bite of dried citrus fruits and herbal hops. Another winner from Victory Brewing. This could definitely make an excellent choice for a summer session beer or any season for that matter. I should also say thanks to fellow BA HoboAGoGo for pointing out this beer to me. I could see why this is one of HoboAGoGo's favorite F-ing beers!"
"Pours a light straw color, wonderful fluffy white head, with lots of fast carbonation bubbles rising to the head. Smell was crisp and clean, hints of citric tartness, and clean linens. Taste is great, very crisp and clean with a healthy dose of sharp hops. The hops have a distinct bitterness to them, almost sour, and very delicious and refreshing. Also to be found are some hints of grain, pleasantly and mildy malted, as well as some peppery spice in there. Overall, an amazing pils that is highly drinkable/sessionable, something to keep in the fridge at all times."
"Pale gold with a slight cloudiness and a firm one finger foamy white head. The nose is largely spicy floral hop esters, light citrus, dry grains, and some alcohol esters. The medium high carbonation allows some smoothness in the mouthfeel and follows with some cloying. Bitterness is right up front with its sharp hop profile and ends dry with a peppery hotness. Grainy, grassy, corn sugar sweetness rounds this out and just a little musty earthiness brings the flavors together. The finish starts dry, chalky, and peppery and then a sweet hoppy floral character comes into play."
"poured a clear light golden yellow. the tiny head quickly disappeared leaving a thin white ring. light smells of lemon and maybe grapefruit. the taste was good, not great, but still quite good. there were nice citrus notes as well as a slight hop bitterness to the finish, nothing too crazy, but just a bit for the road. the beer just feels light, i could see myself drinking alot of this easily. this brew makes me think what the big companies COULD do if they wanted to make a beer right, luckily Victory Prima Pils is readily available in my area, so i don't have to think about it for too long."
"D- nice hop bitterness, good flavor, sessionable, recommended, good brew"
"Prima Pils poured a clear corn color with a generous amount of carbonation. Lace sticks quite well throughout the entire beer but it isn't that thick. Smell is of mild hops with a fair amount of a malty wheat-like aroma paired with a flowery odor. Very light refreshing taste with mild earthy/herb like tone that is perfect for a warm summer day. This brew is very smooth and well balanced over all which makes it extremely drinkable. I am not usually a fan of pilseners, but I definitely enjoyed this beer. Give it a try. Good job once again Victory."
"This beer is not the WORST abuse of the style that I've ever tasted from a micro -- and of course, it is much better than a macro. But to call it a Pilsener -- no. Sorry. No."
"Cheers."
"Taste was like light biscuits and bread mixed with a little nuts and some mellow hops to round it out. A little racey and i like it. Fresh on the palate with a good crispiness. I'll be keeping a 6er as standard stock in my dbf."
"Session beer."
"I can drink just one in a session or 2 with a meal and would drink several of these if they weren't so pricey. Spent around $8.00 for a 6er."
"I'd this one a try. Really good on a hot summer day,very refreshing."
"It pours a pale, dull, yellow with decent head formation which dissipates quickly but leaves good lacing. At first I was afraid I smelled a bit of skunkiness, but I believe that was just generous amounts of Saaz hops. Flavor is fairly light, but definitely ""European"" in character. At first I thought it didn't taste like much, but as I drank it, significant pleasant bitterness accumulated in my mouth. Mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial. This beer is extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't session this beer as I would other pilsners, because it seems a little more intricate and little bit more thinking about. It's more of artisinal pilsener, and that's a rare find, but it's not what I want when going for the style."
"Victory has done a fantastic job. Their beers are consistently well done. The Pils is a fine example of a European Pils, rarely found in America. This beer is clean and drinkable. I rarely buy the same beer week after week, but this is a fine beer and I seek it out, especially when the weather is warm."
"It's German styled alright, but with an American twist to it. What are American craft brewers known for? Making hoppy beers. Take a standard German Pils, and make it a pinch hoppier. It's a bit grassy and spicy with lingering bready malts following each sip. I expected it to be sweeter than it tasted, as the smell had an appealing sticky sweet scent to it. Very German in character, but don't tell my German stange glass that it was brewed in America."
"Pours bright gold with perfect clarity and a sticky but thin white head that leaves lacing and a collar. Familiar sea-air Saaz hop aroma, very fragrant and volatile. Nice graininess underneath. On the palate, rough hops are at the forefront -- not rough like a bronco, but rough like fine-grained sandpaper. Light barley malt backing on the palate, which provides some smoothness to the beer without being overly creamy or thick. Mouthfeel is light in weight but scratchy with hops. Overall, this is a wonderful pils -- it's got all the hallmarks of the style, but it's also got an American edge in that it's drier and hoppier than most Euro examples. But it's not overdone; it maintains its sessionability. Excellent."
"I really enjoyed this beer, though it was my first pilsener and very drinkable. I will have to explore this style more thoroughly."
"Drinkability- high drinkability for its balance. definitely can drink this one often. Nothing harsh or out there, high marks for its balance, but no flashy experimentation per se."
"This is one that I get when I want a hoppy pils. It is refreshingly light with a hoppy character and a nice taste."
"D: Crisp, dry, bitter, wonderful. I'm not much of a pilsener fan, but this is good stuff."
"~E. Brad"
"Drinkability is great, this is a great one for the summer or for sessioning during a long spell of sporting activities, either playing or watching."
"Beers like this aren't going to blow the palate away like some heavier and stronger styles, but in terms of enjoyablility, this beer could easily be sessioned with this taste and ABV, and thus is judged by style rather than overall impact."
"Drinkability is very high. I've never tasted a pilsner this good before. One of my go to brews from now on."
"I got this beer $.88...waa wee wee waa"
"Drinkability from the bottle was one aspect that beat the draft. I remember being slightly overwhelmed from the draft (which wasn't totally a bad thing) and the bottle is actually an incredibly easy drink. This would be a good case for a get together."
"Damn tasty and drinkable; this is not as outstanding as I thought it would be. I like Blue Paddle and Scrimshaw just as much. Still, I want another bottle or two... or a keg. Thank you RedHaze for the sample, I am happy I finally tried Prima Pils."
"Drinkability is great. Pils have never been the most exciting beers for me, or wheat type beers in general. But this one is refreshing with a strong flavor. Just not my kind of flavor. Very refreshing and ended up being quite enjoyable."
"This would be a nice one to enjoy with the game. Definitely one to try to win over some die-hard big-brewer lager drinkers."
"pours a light golden color with lots of carbonation and a strong hop smell to it, tastes hoppy with a slight malt sweetness to it, with a spicy hoppy aftertaste, the frothy head doesn't stay for long as it quickly subsides, a good beer especially for the its cheap price, a good representation of a tough brew to master"
"I poured this beer into my Magic Hat Hocus Pocus Pilsner glass. Coloration was pale golden...similar to a Budweiser, with a nice little white head. Smell was extremely clean, almost too clean by my standards in that it smelled a bit like dish soap. Taste was also very clean, with crisp carbonation, a definite vegetable presence, and touch of hops. It was pretty easy on the palate....simply an easy to drink Lager. I preferred the Harvest Pilsner much more on tap, but then again, this is a pretty quality Pilsner considering some of the other interpretations out there on the market. Cheers."
"Overall an intensely hoppy beer, but with enough malt to support it. Very fresh, clean lager character. Probably what good German Pils tastes like fresh in its native land."
"Crisp clear aromas and clean pour. Minimal head and a slight heaviness give this pils higher marks. The hops come through after a few sips and finish strong. Semi- dry on the mouth but slight fruity and candy malt sweetness counteracts the hop backlash. This pilsner may be schizoid but it is very satisfying."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability: Very good beer, easily enjoyable anytime. I'm not a pilsner guy but I could see my self making this a regular beer to drink"
"This is a more complex beer than I expected. The hops and malt can both be noticed. Part of a fresh variety pack."
"Prima is a fine name for this beer. Excellent flavor, sessionable in a huge way. Just the thing on this fine, 63 degree January evening. Highly recommended."
"12 ounce bottle says best before Feb 12, 2007. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a light golden color with an inch and a half white puffy head. Lacing and head retention are both pretty good. It smells like lemon, grain and malt. It tastes like citrus (lemon), grain/bread, and it also has a bit of a peppery spicyness to it. There's also a slight hop bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light, but crisp and refreshing. It would be better for a hot summer day, but it's still good on a colder day. Drinkability is very good, it would be a good session beer for me in the summertime. I think this is a pretty good pilsner, I'd definitely buy it again."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I am not a pilsener fan, but this one is worth having."
"Bottom line: This is a Pilsner that doesn't hold back on the flavour so enjoy!!"
"An all around beauty by Victory here. Nice head on the pours leaves lacing down the glass. A lemony, banana smell gleams through and is a medium bodied, crisp beer pouring an unfiltered looking golden color. The kick of this is, it has a lot of hops which are rounded out by the munich malts. Another top shelf beer by Victory."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, nice light-looking semi-thick head on it. Lingers long enough and gives enough lace until the last drop. Beautiful light golden color. It has some hop aroma followed by a touch of malt, but not much. Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated and very light. This is an easy drinking beer that is great on hot days. It has a wonderful hop profile for a pilsner, can taste the citrusy flavor which bursts in your mouth but leaves a clean dry aftertaste and makes you want more."
"D: Highly drinkable German Pilsner assuming you like the style. Looks fairly similar in terms of color to other lagers out there (many people don't realize head retention and lacing have a lot to do with a beer), but tastes completely different as is defenitely not for a ""I'm only a Bud Light guy"". Victory Brewing did an excellent job with hop bittering this beer and balancing everything out."
"Very drinkable. Not a style I would typically go for, but not one I think I would pass up if offered."
"I'm not normally a pils type guy, but I thought it would be nice to start with for dinner. Poured into a tall pils glass, nice two inch thick pure white head, with good retention and lacing. The color of the body is lovely translucent blond gold, with streams of bubbles retaining the head. Smells of pils malt, gentle and elegant, some piny, but subdued hops, pale malts and a hint of honey (like mentioned in other reviews). The taste is crisp and refreshing, a very quenchable beer, I feel as though I enjoy it more the bigger the mouthful I drink. The pils malt is present, with subtle bitterness from the hops. To make an oxymoron this beer screams of subtlety. The quality of the water is even present to a degree, as far as my limited experience with pils this is very nice. I'd buy it again if the occasion called for it no doubt."
"Tight, tasty flavor that opens with malt and finishes with a broad river of open ended, piney hops. Aftertaste is satisfying and long lasting. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Extremely European tasting.. If I didn't know better I'd have sworn this was an import, which is praise, particularly in this style. Tough to top on either shore."
"D- This beer has good depth of hops and the malt flavors are very good for this style."
"This is a nice Pilsener from Victory. I wasn't expecting the full range of spices but the taste does not disappoint. This would make for a good summer session brew. I can imagine drinking quite a few of these on hot summer day!"
"Not a bad pilsner, great for the summer (although this was tasted in the winter). Recommended."
"Pours a clear yellow with a very nice head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of spicy hops. Taste is good with a lot of hops for a pils with a little fruitiness and a little malt. Mouthfeel is good and so is drinkability. Not my favorite style but this is a good beer."
"Stray yellow in color. Very clear. White 1/4"" head that quickly fades. First taste is of hops. More than the average Pils but it helps out. It's very smooth and tasty. Not your average Pils. The malt and hops balance out nicely. I think this one might be a great starter for my meal..."
"Exceptionally easy to drink. A very fine beer, and one of the best pilseners I've tasted."
"Drinkability: This is a really fine beer. It look and taste are exceptional. The hop bitterness and aroma are well balanced, not excessively malty or sour like American style and some European lagers. It's a hard style to perfect, and they've nearly done so. American macro breweries are technically capable of making a pilsner this good, why o why do they elect not to? This could be a benchmark pils to judge all others against."
"The brew is lightbodied and has a higher level of carbonation which benefits this beer in my opinion. The beer finishes somewhat dry, and leaves you wanting more. All in all this is a pretty good beer, but I would prefer something of a different style. I'll probably not buy this beer in the near future because there are many other Pils I've yet to try. This beer didn't make a good enough impression on me for it to become my ""house pils."""
"Happy Holidays!"
"Perfect level of carbonation for this style and goes down well. A good drinking beer and representation of the style."
"You know, there's just nothing not to like about this stuff. I'm thrilled that it's readily available as a go-to pils here."
"Overall, this is what a pilsner should taste like. No doubt."
"A great balance of flavor intensity with drinkability."
"This beer was courtesy of MuenchenerKindl. Thanks for the trade."
"Poured with a thick 2"" head and a golden clear dream. It looked quite yummy. It smelled of fresh hops and bread. The flavor was also bready and slightly bitter. It was a zesty, crisp beer. Through out the drink the retention of the head was good. This is a very drinkable beer."
"D - Excellent drinkability. I could have numerous bottles of this fine brew."
"The mouth is light, but more complex than many pils, as the sweetness, grainy-ness, and hoppy bitterness all interplay with one another; good carbonation. Very drinkable, complex enough to savor, light enough to make a good session beer. Another solid one from Victory."
"My first pilsener, so I dont have much of a grasp on the style. Aroma was very hoppy, sensed a little grass. Light yellow with a snow white head. Nice and smooth on the way in and finishes hoppy and dry. I enjoyed this quite a bit and sure wouldnt mind having it again."
"This is not a bad beer. I like it for what it manages to accomplish, but it's not my cup of tea (glass of beer?)"
"This is my new party beer. Don't get me wrong, this beer could easily be thrown down with some food it's just so fantastic for shear poundability."
"Drinkability: An easy to drink brew. Give a nice hop flavor and profile while still being refreshing."
"D: Very pleasant Pils with a right tasty hop assault. Would definitely place a second order."
"Slainte!"
"What a suprise beer for ,me. I was very upset at the thought of drinking a beer of this nature, but I like it! cheers."
"Overall, a very well made, bold pilsner. I'm not a huge fan of the style though."
"D: If I'm going to drink a pilsener, from now on, it's going to be this one."
"Pours a pale golden straw with very lively carbonation and a thing head that has good retention. Malty body with a big spicy hop presence. Flavor is really hop forwarded. Floral, herbal, spicy, and slightly piny. Maltiness is more of a background element, but this is really interesting. Light body and spritzy mouthfeel. I would buy this again and could see this being a session."
"Drinkability: This is the beer that I wish all my macro-oriented friends would drink. I would go to their houses more. Buy this often, and in great quantities."
"Overall, while Pilseners aren't my favorite of beers, I can truly say I really enjoy this one. It has always been great on blistering hot summer days. Could also be a decent stepping stone for a macro drinker into the world of craft beer."
"Victory's Prima Pils is a rather distinctive cloudy straw yellow when poured and forms a white, almost fluffy head that stays around to the finish. Lacing was minimal. It's certainly an attractive looking beer. The mild floral nose is rather non-descript and belies a very well balanced flavor. Crisp, clean hop flavor is most immediate on the pallate, followed by bitter malt in equal measure. No one flavor outshines the other. It's just smooth. Mouthfeel was unremarkable, which is as much as can be expected of any pilsener. Overall it's a first rate brew, one of Victory's best, if not their best. A highly drinkable beer. Definitely recommended."
" It's a clear, brilliant golden straw with a nice stiff , almost crusty head; thousands of tiny carbonation bubbles cling to glass then rise. The aroma is crisp, clean, citrus, fresh grain, grassy hops a bare hint of yeasty bread. The taste is malty, fresh bread, tangy hops with a perfect, clean bitter aftertaste. It's light bodied and well carbonated, just slightly astringent, both satisfying and crisp and refreshing. Could not be more drinkable. A world-class beer for those with a taste for the refined and balanced."
"What a head on this one! I'd say it was about an inch thick ... creamy white and gorgeous! Body is straw colored and very inviting. Nose is lemony hops and fruit. Tastes much the same ... I really dig the fruitiness. Finish is dry. I can see myself buying this all the time even though I'm not a huge fan of the style ... this is damn tasty!"
"Pours a dark golden with a medium head (.5-1 inches). Smells fruity and grassy. Taste definitely grew on me - at first, hoppy bitterness overwhelms you, but a flowery-fruit aftertaste came through after a few sips. The herbal hints balance out the hops very nicely and you have yourself a very nice brew. It is a very unique selection from Victory."
"Would've liked to see some more hopiness and I don't see why people think it's hoppier than other pilsners. That being said, I didn't brew it so I really can't complain. A very nice representation of a traditional German pilsner. This tastes almost exactly like Pilsner Urquell."
"This beer has a dull yellow color, a small head (white), and minimal lacing. Slight hops aroma, very average taste - like a slightly more crisp macro lager. Mouthfeel average, drinkability average/good Would not seek this one out. This is a very ordinary beer."
"I have to say, I love this brew. It's just incredibly solid, any way you look at it. Victory nailed the German Pilsner style here. Prosit!"
"Appearance is light, clear, well carbonated, and has good head that could stick around a little longer. Smells good, with distinguishable grain, and Czech and German hops. Flavor is an excellent balance, hops are more prominent than a normal pils, which I appriciate. Light malt and grain are still noticible. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, close to perfect. I'm not a huge fan of the pilsner style, but this is one of the few I can drink a many of and I actually WANT to!!!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pilsner glass. Was a nice straw color with good head and carb. Had the typical pilsner smell and looked great but the taste was average for me. Finished a little too dry for my liking and was a little too hoppy. I'm new to the style so will try again as palate develops. (3,RB,ML,O)"
"Deffinitely quite drinkable. I enjoyed this beer. Recommended"
"Bullseye. In a more pleasant alternate universe this is what we get when we open a can of macrobrew. Come back, summer. I want to drink more Prima Pils."
"Prima Pils pours a nice clear gloden color, not too deeper than most macros that claim to be of the same style. Smell is hoppy with hints of a yeasty aroma. Taste is nice and light, but in a good way. There is a nice hop edge and sweet malty background that shows that despite the beers light color, it can still be quite flavorful. Nice hop flavor and aroma as well."
"Drinkability: This drinks like a perfect lager. Very clean, smooth and yummy."
"Overall impression: Great pilsner - I am always excited to see a new craft pilsners on the shelf. Hopefully this one moves fast enough in Colorado to stay fresh."
"Crisp, clean, bubbly feel in the mouth. Leans more to the thin side. Very refreshing warm weather beer. Very easy to drink. I think I know what I will be getting more of for my Labor Day cookout. Another tasty brew from Victory."
"D-Good ""session"" beer,as I drank more, it grew on me.I dont really care for many pils but I liked this one.It was a good change from other beers ive been consuming.I would have this again and I reccomend this to any beer drinker.Kudos to Victory!"
"This beer has gone up in my estimation, so I've decided to review it again. It's simply the finest example of a Pils that I've come across. The edelhopfen aroma, taste, and prolonged bitterness are so heavenly. The incredible carbonation and refreshing character make it my warm weather beer of choice. I've had cases of this, and it's probably my favorite (easy) beer!"
"Recommended."
"The beer pours a light yellow body with a white head that lastes for a decent amount of time but turns to a film across the top of the beer. The smell and taste are very hoppy giving it a floral taste and aroma. It's a light-medium bodied beer that finishes refreshingly dry and makes me wanting another one. This beer is one of my favorite pilsners out there. I mean it's the perfect hop head's lawn mowing beer. It's light in body dry and refreshing and hoppy as no other pils I have met as of this date."
"I did enjoy this one, I am a Pilsner fan. I do feel this one was past it's ""prima"". I look forward to giving this one another try."
"I've been looking for a good hoppy, bitter pils since returning from Germany and I've finally hit the jackpot! This one pourded a golden strawlike color with a nice bright white head and decent lacing. It has a nice strong hop aroma with some grassy undertones. The taste transported me back to Germany instantly. A nice strong bitter hop bite with an ever so slight malt sweetness and a tinge of grassiness. The finish was unbelievably crisp and biting. A perfect German style pilsner that I will definitely keep stocked until I return to Deutschland."
"An american made pilsner that can match up with the best of the best pilsners..probably more asertive than most but very well done...great clarity and look."
"One could definitely rip back a few of these after a tough day at work and be better for it. Especially if you like a side of hops with your pilsner."
"The bitter finish is almost too overwhelming, though I think it really only detracts from this brew in terms of drinkability. I don't know that I think this deserves the title of BA's best German pilsener, but it is quite tasty. A worthwhile summer brew."
"D: Good Pilsner, I never really drink this style of beer but would be very refreshing on a hot summer day. Thanks to nlmartin for this one recieved in a trade."
"D-This goes down pretty smooth, leaves a nice aftertaste, making it very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear pale golden with a foamy white head. Saaz hops jump right out in the nose, in addition to a bready malt with a feint touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and crisp. Spicey Saaz hops are noticeable right away in the taste. Flavor's a little non-descript upfront, but the assertive hoppiness of the Saaz comes through soon enough. Flavors of grapefruit are also present in the hoppy pils. Without the assertive use of hops I think this would be a rather regular and bland pilsner. Nice maltiness toward the back. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish. I had this with Italian sausages and pasta and it paired wonderfully. Definitely one to seek out and give a try."
"The taste makes up for the thin mouthfeel and the ordinary looks. This is quite drinkable."
"Update: It appears that fresh Prima Pils is finally making it's way out west....I've been lucky enough to get it regularly and it is Wonderful...the best there is."
"Edited to add: This beer just kept getting better and better. I thought I should come back and adjust my scores accordingly."
"Drinkability is outstanding, I will put this down as a buy. Prosit MK"
"M&D - dry and balanced, very tasty , im not too experienced in the way of pilseners, but this seems like a high quality one, very easy down, a nice brew, as is the pattern with Victory"
"Its been several months since I last had this beer, and I wonder if I might have an old barrel this time around. Looks great, yellow and gold with a nice white head. Smells sweet and a bit hoppy. Taste is similar, but it lacks crisp flavors. The hops dont have much flavor and he malt flavor is pretty plain. It just kind of tastes like a light pale ale. It thought it was okay and it still drank nicely, but this wasn't the beer I expected."
"The beer poured a vibrant yellow color with a bright white head and some lacing on the glass. The nose was a fresh hop character with a touch of spice. The taste is very true to the pilsner form, hops up front with some fruit notes in the back. The hop character is not overwhelming which makes for an easy drinking, crisp beer."
"Definitely more flavorful than your average pilsener but overall not much better."
"Pours a foamy two-finger head, with a transparent, super pale yellow hue and effervescent carbonation. Smells resinous and spicy. Hops at first, but a little less hoppy than the aroma indicated. Tastes rather hoppy, but in a spicy way--good hop choice. As for the malt/yeast aspect, it's middle of the road--not stale but not quite bready, though malt flavors have improved since the last time I tried it. Clean overall. No alcohol noticable. Mouthfeel is actually too high in carbonation for me, light but not watery. With a heavy pour, the flavors are more balanced. Mind you, it's a pils. Drinkability is rather good, and this is a truly good pils, which are hard to come by. Far better than Brooklyn (at least in the bottle), but still not quite as pleasing as my local microbrew pils (New England Elm City Lager). A big, widely available winner of a pale crafted lager."
"Pours lemon yellow with a short but very lasting white head. The smell is slightly sweet malts with lagery yeast and a very slight hop sting. The taste is nearly perfect for a pils in my opinion. Slightly sweet up front, with a slight cirtus flavor mixed in the with bitter hops. Mouthfeel is also excelent, somewhat dry, lacking the ""slick"" feeling I get from lots of pilsners, and with a perfect medium-high carbonation. Overall I have to say this beer meets all of my requirements for a pilsner, and is virtually free from flaws. Very refreshing."
"Overall a very nice beer, any negative comments are really just nitpicking. I'll definitely drink this again."
"Enjoyed Prima Pils in Philly on a hot summer afternoon. An easy drinking refreshing German stlye pilsner with a light hoppy aftertaste. If you ever experienced the humidity on the East Coast a cold refreshing Prima Pils did the work of quenching my thrist. Would like to try in on draught."
"This is decent, maybe about as good as you're going to get in a pilsener? I'm not a huge fan though I admit they come in handy on these summer days (nights, mornings, etc). It's a good all around beer for the style, with a bit more character than most of the other offerings. Nice bite on the aftertaste distinguishes it from others."
"A great German pils Victory-affied. Possibly my favorite Pils. I haven't had enough of the style yet to judge for sure though."
"VERY enjoyable, one of my favorite pilsners."
"Drank very easy, nice take on the style with a German influence to be sure"
"Probably the sweetest and hoppiest pils I've tasted...good drinkability....this will go well with pizza or barbeque."
"Pours a crystal clear, extra light straw color. Fluffy white head is well supported. Aromas are wheaty, spicy hoppy, and slightly skunky. Body is quite heavy for the style (alcohol?). Hops aren't as forward as I anticipated. Reminds me of a pretty standard American Pils. It's clean and refreshing, though I'd like a bit more carbonation. Exp date of June 28th, 06.... I feel this is a much better brew when fresh. Bitterness doesn't come in any more so than an Urquell, but it is appropriate. Overall, a bit of a dissapointment, I anticipated something more enlightening by the previous reviews. Blue Paddle is local and a mere equivelent."
"Overall: I'm not a huge fan of the style, but Prima Pils has a nice balancing bitterness that I like."
"Its a remarkably delicious and easy drinking lager. One word of wise: if picking up a 6 pack of this delicious nectar, be sure to check the Born On Date. This is not a beer that tastes as good past its prime. Ive walked that road, please dont follow."
"Drinkability: Really clean and then you get hit with a dose of hops. I like it and find it really drinkable. This would be good paired with something that needs some cleaning up of the palate, almost a pizza beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability/Notes - Another really nice beer from Victory, they have such great full hops. Unique, interesting and highly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Well-made pils, perfectly suitable for a hot summer day or and other day of the year."
"D - Very good. Nice summertime beer."
"This is one of my all-time favorites and a ""second step"" beer. Maybe not the first craft beer to advocate to newbies, but a good beer to steer them to next. Very highly recommended."
"Tried at USBTC Tasting at Jungle Jim's Cincinnati. It's a mo-ped for Ale drinkers: they enjoy it, but they don't want to admit it to their Ale drinking friends. In reality, this is about as good as a pilner gets. Though no amped up body, hops, or foreign character, it's simple and to-the-point. A nice pilner malt base with characterful hops (may not be classic noble versions) and maybe an American hop or two for a better citrus and acidic hop finish. Lightly earthy and dusty, and a body that is on the upper end of the style scale. Although many will proclaim the Pilsners should not contain esters of any sort, I find that a pleasant, light estery quality of pears and a nectar-like perfume aroma compliment the beer well. Because of esters and basically no dms or acetaldahyde, the beer may use ale yeast? Finsihes very clean and very crisp. No doubt a best-of-style beer!"
"Not just a thirst quencher, this is a damn fine beer. Very fresh...good pils!"
"Bright and crisp clear golden color with a head that settled to a slight film. The smell is sweet and zesty. The taste is quite sweet and smooth as you would expect from a lager initially, not all that different from most American domestics, but then the subtleties become more apparent and thrusts this well above average. The nice smooth malt gives way to zesty, spicy, lemon-like hops. This beer is really light, easy going, and refreshing."
"It had a light beer taste to it with a zing of hops that was nearly overpowering in grapefruit type of flavors. Was I drinking the hyped beer that I had read too much about? I could see others liking it and a tasting draft might be its saving grace for me at another time, but it was not for me with grilled salmon on the table as I reached for the fridge for another choice."
"D: One of the most drinkable beers I've had, though this may be due to the smoothness, low abv, and very refreshing, thirst quenching taste."
"Note: this was the first of 3 German-style pilsners I sampled back-to-back-to-back this weekend. In my opinion, it was the best of the 3 (the others were Stoudt's Pils and Eku Pils)."
"A highly drinkable beer. Not the best example of the classic German Pils, but who cares. This beer was magnificent. In my opinion, perhaps the best session beer out there."
"Better than most pilsners and definitely not what I was expecting...in a good way."
"I appreciate the effort of crafting a flavorful pilsner...just not the actual resulting beer. Perhaps this draft-offering was just an off-batch. I'll look forward to trying this again, however, as legions of Victory fans can't be wrong."
"Thanks to beerbeing."
"The body pours quite a pale yellow, with a moderate haze and thinnish bone-white head. Aroma is sharp and dry malty, with hints of sulphur and floral hops. Ooh! The taste is light and dry, with a more prominent hop taste than most Pilsners, and I feel like a touch of American hops, although the bottle says no. Overall quite a good pilsner; a little more bitter than I'd like, but it's a clean bitterness that doesn't really compromise the drinkability. If anything, it could stand to be a bit dirtier in the Czech style. But I suppose that's not what they were going for. Still, delicious."
"Look at Prima in a glass and you'd say it might be an offering from BMC. One taste, however, and you'll know there's a bit of pride put into the brewing of this fine grog. The pure white head laces till the very end. The carbonation is nice and suttle. The taste is a light citrus/hop combination. It immediately makes you want to have another sip. I'm picking up a citrus smell, lemon? An absolutely great choice for the summer season. I could pair this with just about anything off of the grill. I am by nature a lover of strong Belgian browns. There comes a time though, when I crave something ligher. This is the perfect beer to relax with while lounging around on a warm summer's day. I would definetly recommend having this one in the fridge for the upcoming summer."
"Very good pils. Very German in style. Perfectly balanced hop and malt. Nearly the same flavors as the nose big on the lemon/lime, with a wheaty finish. Very clean, smooth mouthfeel and drinkable for a day and a half."
"A incredibly drinkable beer, perfect summer thirst quencher!"
"Ok, I'm not a huge fan of the pilsener style. I like funkier punch you in the face ales, but this is very good and very drinkable. Give me a six and a warm day, and I'll call this one all sorts of good."
"It pours a fizzy golden color with a nice white head. The nose is packed with hop spiciness. A bit on the floral side as well. The taste is spectacular. Completely hoppy right out of the gate. Almost a perfumey flavor if thats possible. Not much malt character, but I dont mind... the hops are extremely tasty. Finishes good. The mouthfeel is exactly what I could want from a beer of this style. Excellent body, excellent carbonation. I could down these with ease all night long! I'm really impressed with this offering from Victory. Great job!"
"D - Outstanding! Drinks easier than water. Sessionable and goes with food. You have to look hard to find the few faults with this pilsner."
"Overall this is a fantastic offering and would be very refreshing at a tailgate party on a hot day before a baseball game."
"Very handsome straw color. Crystal clear with a HUGE foamy white head. Defintely a gorgeous offering. Spicy lemon scented nose. Absolutely loaded with flavor.. nice layer of bready sweet malt under grassy and spicy tones - VERY liberally hopped. Very smooth going down with a crisp clean finish. First rate session beer. Perfect on a hot day with a slice of pepperoni pizza."
"Dvery tasty, easily a session beer. Although this bottle was past its prime, I dont think it had much effect on it."
"beats an Urquell any day."
"Pours a pale, clear straw yellow with 2-3 fingers of snowy, fluffy head. Nose is light with notes of musty malt husk, grass and unfortunately a waft of piss as it warms. Taste is light and bright - leafy hop bitterness, grassy/musty malt - very ""clean"" and sterile tasting. Mouthfeel is lager smooth and nicely crisp. Probably too subtle for a DIPA/ADS/RIS/Quad lover, but its sessionability is well-noted. Not something I'd drop $7.99/sixer for, but would certainly not turn it down if offered."
"This beer has superior drinkability and can quench with the best of them during the hot summer months. Shazam beeotch!"
" I couldn't taste any of the alcohol in this, and it went down so easily, but never as anything to be chugged or consumed at a fast pace. Certainly worth a try for the warm-weather beer drinker who wants a subtly and solidly satisfying experience. It's no wonder that this beer is the #1 rated Pils on this site!"
"I like this beer alot....I guess I just didn't give it a fair chance a year ago."
"Arrived a pale transparent gold color, with a white cap that stayed for the duration. Aroma is somewhat grainy, with hops coming up a little short from what I was expecting. Flavor starts off with a nice hop punch up front, then grains and toasty malts before a dry, clean finish, very nice! provides a nice mouthfeel. Definately a sessionable brew. If you see it, try it."
"A great example of the pilsner style from Victory. And the best part is, it doesn't have to come from overseas, so it is much more fresh than imports! I will be drinking this beer during this Texas summer."
"overall, a pretty flavorful pilsner, I think this one stretches the boundaries of the style, but still a very enjoyable beer, nice in the summertime."
"M/D- Prima had ample carbonation, and was extremely drinkable. I actually was drinking this at a buy one get one happy hour and ordered the same thing for my second drink. I was really impressed because I had been looking for a light beer to drink during the hot summer, and this one has enough flavor to be it. It also had a slightly heavier mouthfeel than I was expecting. I look forward to living in a city where victory beers are available."
"Great beer for the summer, nice and crisp. I almost crave beers like this after I've been out in the sun for awhile."
"It's pretty obvious what Victory was going with here. The hop flower prominently displayed on the label should have clued me in that this was no ordinary Euro-pilsner. It's definitely an interesting and somewhat confounding beer, and I'm glad I picked up the sixer."
"Drinkability - this goes down very easy. It' s very good, and I could easily just pound one of these right after another, especially when summer weather rolls around. If you like Euro Lagers ( and really, who as beer drinker doesn't ? ), then this will rate amongst the best, and most refreshing as well, even though this is American."
"Drinkabitly is high. I think I'll knock one back after mowing the grass."
"Hops up front, some hints of spice and citrus to follow. Light and crisp with some subtleties present. Very unique for the style and very tastey as well. It goes down easy and is refreshing."
"This brew pours a clear golden color. The head is massive, cloudy and bright white. The aroma is a perfect blend of spicy, floral and grassy. This is what a pilsener smells like at its best. The taste begins with floral notes than moves towards grass and spices. The finish is a nice clean bitterness that envelops my whole tongue. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. Although this is still a light beer, it is probably the heaviest pilsener I have yet tasted, and I do think that the extra weight really helps the mouthfeel. Whereas most pilseners can be discribed as crisp and light, Prima Pils can be discibed as crisp and smooth. Overall, this is a great pilsener and will hold a rotating spot in my refrigerator."
"Drinkability: Best pilsner I have found on the market so far. What do you think?"
"Clear yellow-gold, thin white head. Great retention. Minimal carbonation streaming. Aroma of saaz hops and lemons and a touch of curacao in the finish. Very crisp and fresh. Taste is wonderfully fresh, citrusy, spicy, and floral. Lasting bitterness despite being a smooth and easy drinker. Clover and grass clippings, orange peal, crazy hoppy finish. Yippie. This is great stuff but I still prefer the big German varieties."
"Poured out of the bottle into the pint glass with a cascading head. Very clear, bright golden body with active bubbles. Smelled of strong, grassy hops, fresh vegetable, grain husks and sweet bread. Taste was very clean, there was a grainy body that had an almost floral, going into a grassy hop taste with a very spicy mouth after you finish the beer that stuck on my tongue for a good minute after the first drink. Incredibly crisp, easy to drink, beautiful beer. I hate the fact I cannot get this beer at home."
"Musings: Obviously loaded with a shitload more hops than most pils. It does work though - and the result is a nicely balanced, hop bang in a highly drinkable brew."
"Prima Pils pours to a pale yellow color with a nice head that fades slowly. It is very clear with some lacing. Hops and yeast dominate the aroma with hints of citrus breaking through. You can definitely taste the hops, but they don't slap you in the face and there is a nice balance of sweetness that accompanies the long hop finish. The body is light to moderate. Overall this is an excellent Pils, one of the best I've had to date. Extremely CRISP and very satisfying. Pick some up if you haven't tried it yet."
"This beer might make a good session beer. It is not high in alcohol, and it is not too strong in flavor."
"I could drink quite a few of these on a sunny day.. hope they are still available come cookout season!"
"Big-time Saaz hop flavor mixed with a light malt. The bitterness is really subtle, though. To be brutally honest here..if we're talking about hoppy ""summer beers", Gumballhead still makes this brew it's bitch. That being said, I'll still try and track down some sixers of this before the brutal Iowa heat gets here. A great pick to sit by the pool, grill, beach, or hell..just about anywhere."
"Nice and refreshing. A touch bitter and a touch too hoppy for a 'refreshing' afterwork Pilsner, but an AMAZING beer when taken on its own field. Man, nice and clean mixed with enough earthy hops to give you a touch of cottonmouth. I love it,"
"A big step up from the mass produced crap pilsners out there. Some time was actually spent into crafting this. Poured out a hazy straw yellow almost like a wheat beer. Light and foamy head didnt last that long. Aroma of pine and hops. Slight skunky aroma in the beginning. Leaves a medium bitterness. Very good carbonation with a crisp finish. Light and refreshing. A very drinkable Pilsner. Just wish they werent $9 a six pack."
"Jim"
"The aroma was somewhat wheaty, lemony, with a little floral hoppiness, but the taste was outstanding: Bitter-sweet with piney tones, alcohol well balanced and very very dry, clean mouthfeel. I would expect this to be a great warm-weather beer, but I could drink this any time of the year. Simply a great interpretation of this style. Cheers"
"Crisp, easy beer to drink. Nothing too complex, but it is a pilsner. And a fine one at that."
"Pils as it should be. Completely thoughtless, yet packed with indescribable nuances. This stuff cleans itself up."
"Color to style, with a nice nose but not overwhelming. Then the taste.. clean and crisp with the nicest little hop punch to it. One of my alltime favorites."
"Over all, the finish was a bit dry, and the carbonation was prohibitive."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a Pilsener glass."
"Aroma is slightly sulpher tinged and sharp with hops. Lemonade yellow with a huge three finger thick head that is frothy and bubbly. Fore is grainy/malty with a lot of sweetness from that malt. Hop profile is lower than I thought it would be. Definitely a great warm weather beer here as it is quite quenching."
"Overall, a nice strong presence of hops in a beer that's lighter, crisper and more approachable than a big IPA for a malt-lover like myself. These aren't the citrus/grapefruit hop flavors so loved by many American brewers. These are the hops of a classic European pilsner punched up a few notches. Though not exactly smooth in my book, it's relatively drinkable."
"overall- this is a great beer for almost any occasion. one of the most easy to drink and refreshing beers ive come across."
"All in all, this is better than most every other american pilsner you'll find on the market. There are better from overseas, but this one is quite nice IMO."
"Another great beer from Victory. Go pick this one up."
"Clear pale golden straw with a short-lived, pristine white head. Pungent noble hop aromas, grassy and sulfuric -- spot on for the style. Grassy hop flavor that's definitely a cut above most pilsners. Smooth malt presence, but this one is all about European lupulin. Crisp, clean mouthfeel; quenching and quite drinkable. Not my favorite style, but when the mood strikes, this is the one to seek out."
"12 oz. brown bottle poured into a mug. this beer poured an almost highlighter-style clear yellow color with a moderate head and no lace. the smell was really bad. a very bad skunky grassy smell with just an over powering of skunkiness. the taste was very disspleasing. i don't know to how to describe the taste, except as a more hoppier version of heineken. i had a high expectation to try this brew but was very dissapointed. maybe i just had a bad batch(hopefully. come on, victory!). i won't buy this again, though."
"Drinkability is great! This stuff goes down like magic. Will probably be a summer favorite for me this year."
"Well done, Victory!"
"heavy carbonation with a light mouthfeel. crisply bitter taste with an overall refreshing taste. simple, straightforward pilsner; somewhat boring. not even close to as good as Victory's others."
"Clear, pale yellow in color. Bright white half inch head, lots of carbonation, with some quick fading lacing. Smells of malts and hops. Also a strong aroma of yeast and bread. There is a slight hint of fruit, maybe banana. Great well balanced taste, lots of malts up front. Finishes dry with some hoppy bitterness. Full bodied mouthfeel, but not fizzy. Easy drinking pilsner, with a low abv, to make for a good session beer. I would enjoy this more during the summer months."
"Verdict- A very tasty, well-hopped pilsner. Close to perfect."
"Poured a clear, pale gold (duh, it is a pilsener!) with nice carbonation and head. Hops really shine in this one. Nice floral, earthy aroma - very pleasing. Bitterness of the hops shines, but there is a mild, faint sweetness that comes through which is hard to place. Very clean and fresh on the palate with a slightly dry feel. Very drinkable, but most of all, really enjoyable. Cheers!"
"This, and I'm relatively new to the category, wasn't what I was expecting, and was overall a disappointment. Not nearly Victory's greatest."
"Drinkability: A great, if somewhat overhopped Pils. For a cold summer drink, I can't think of anything else I'd rather have in my hand."
"Mouthfeel is nice for the style but may be a tad thin, also the carbonation fizzled a bit quicker than I'd prefer."
"Overall: Incredibly drinkable. This is the beer that could convert bud and coors drinkers to craft beer."
"Finally my local grocery store carries this! Probably for a limited time. 12 oz bottle, awesome hoppy-green label(love their design). First of all 99% of the pilseners i have had i have hated so lets see what happens with this much loved brew. This poured a light yellow gold color with a nice but small white head. Mediocre lacing. Awesome stringing of tiny bubbles. The smell is not the most impressive to me, sweet yet simple hops. Clean. This has some nice yet very light and sharp hop flavor. Tastier than most pilsners i have had by far, but it certainly tastes very euro. This is drinkable. but i would take Brooklyn's Pilsener over this any day. It tastes similar to ass macro pilseners, its just that you can tell more time and better ingredients into it because there are no disgusting chemical aftertastes. But still, as As SMF said below ""this is a functional beer""...at this price I am looking for more than functional. Average to me."
"not quite as good as i had hoped, but i had built this up in my own mind a lot. being two months past its enjoy by date may have affected the aroma slightly, but i doubt too much. one of only a few lagers i have had the last couple of weeks, but a good one."
"Excellent, made me like pilsners again. Recommended."
"Again, specially after warming, familiar German malt smell that I don't know how to describe otherwise. Clean, easy drinking, showcase for the spicing hops, detectable quality."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, but I don't understand why it is rated as high as it is by others. Hops are too strong, way overblown and out of balance."
"Prima Pils is golden with good carbonation. Head is medium-sized and fluffy. The aroma is of grain and herbal hop. Wow, the taste is hoppier than expected. Very herbal and bitter. Grainy malt is there, but hops are the focus. My overall impression of this is similar to Victory's HopDevil, the hop bitterness takes a bit much from the flavor for my tastes. I'll probably try this again to see if I can figure out what the fuss is about."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"This is a tasty and extremely drinkable beer. Probably the most drinkable I've ever had. I had four of these right in a row of each other last night, and that's something that I rarely care to do. I look forward to drinking this on a hot summer night after riding around town on my bike."
"Taste; slightly biscuity malts, with some piney hops with a bit of spiciness in the finish and just a little bit bitter. Mouthfeel is light and just slightly oily. Prima Pils went down very easy, my glass was empty before I knew it. This is not my favorite style, but I still found this to be rather enjoyable."
"Flavor is a perfect balance of sweet smoothness and spicy bitterness. A very substantial herbal, spicy, hop flavor is contrasted by a smooth malty sweetness. This is the first Victory brew I've tried, and I am very impressed."
"I poured this beer from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. It is one of the few pilsners that I have had. Appearance is faint yellow with a small white head that disappears rapidly. There is little to no lacing. The smell is flowery hops. The hops are the first thing that hit you when you taste it but quickly fade to reveal biscuity malts. As it warms the hop flavor becomes dominated by the bready malts. This beer feels a little dry in the mouth, but it is still somewhat smooth. Its drinkability is great, I could kill a bunch of this in one night but I wouldn't necessarily always have this on hand..."
"Drinkability: Exceedingly drinkable. This beer's smoothness and moderate alcohol content make it an excellent candidate for session beer status."
"Pours a clear macro-looking yellow with a nice lasting fluffy head. I got biscuts, fruits(citrus), and floral aromas in the nose. Very pleasent. The taste kind of suprised me. It was much more hoppy than I was expecting. Kind of a fruity and grassy taste with some very well defined hop character. Feels kind of thin and overly carbonated in the mouth. You could easily throw a few of these down while watching a football game. I'm not a big pilsner fan, but I will continue to drink Victory's Prima Pils."
"I think as a pilsener, this ones definately stands it's ground and pilsener fans would delite."
"Drinkability is good nice light but lots of flavor. Make a great lawn mower beer."
"I can drink this everyday and twice on Sunday. Such a delicious beer with an ABV that allows you to consume several without a worry. Pilsner lovers NEED to try this beer."
"Drinkability: Pilsners are not my normal brew of choice. I dam BMC and the like for my Pilsner distaste. I am looking forward to this Pilsner and a few others when summer comes."
"This is a very thin, light bodied beer. It poured out with a decent head. The color is a cloudy light straw shade. The smell is not much different than a macro. The taste is extremely watered down. You can detect a very slight hop taste. The mouthfeel is on the edge of revolting. The drinkability could not be very high. A brewer such as Victory just plain out missed the mark with this beer."
"Prima Pils has now become my favorite pilsner for sure. Poured out crisp clear gold, with a big head. The smell of floral hops and maybe some grapefruit. Had just the right carbonation and didn't go flat right away. The taste was ""bitter sweet"" some honey and citrice. Very good served very cold. mouthfeel was nice, sharp and crisp. A great refreshing drink."
"Pours a golden yellow. Head disappears quickly. Lots of carbination, not much lacing. Smell was very hoppy,and floral. Mouthfeel is light. For me this taste was way too hoppy. Bitter from start to finish. If you like a light,bitter beer try it. If not don't bother."
"A good pilsner although I find it a little bland. A little more showing from the hops would have convinced me more. A good selection to pair with lighter dishes, seafood, or pasta. For a domestic example, I prefer Brooklyn Pils over this."
"A well-built pilsner. The amped up hops is a nice addition and isnt so overwhelming as to throw it off kilter or too far out of style. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Pours crystal clear golden yellow with a substantial white, fluffy head. It sticks well and leaves lacing all over the place. The smell is slightly bready with substantial spice and lemon notes. Upfront the taste is full and bready, then gives way to an unbelievable crispness of spicy hops, less lemon, and a substantial herbal, tealike quality. It dries out terrifically through the finish with only a slight lingering bitterness and the enormous urge to sip again. Mouthfeel is quite full for a pils, and carbonated perfectly in my mind, that meaning a bit less than some other examples of the style. Session beer number 1."
"Notes: Crisp, refreshing, smooth, balanced. This pils is stronger on the hops that other pils I've had, and it is great. It has a nice balance with good hop flavor and moderately strong bitterness. Whoa, this beer is going to be hard to keep in the fridge because it is just so tasty."
"I had to try this beer again to make sure I was reading it right. Plus it is very drinkable and really makes me respect pilsners again. Thank you Victory for changing my mind on the way Americans do Pilsners."
"The taste was a thorough cleansing of the post-turkey palate that was both enjoyable and easy going down."
"-Cheers2Beers"
"Pours a clear yellow/golden color, nice carbonation, very small head the dissappears quickly, no lacing what so ever.. Right from the pouring I could smell hops, malts, and some citrusy. Very nice taste for a pils, little bite and dry. Medium body. Very drinkable at 5.3%, would make a nice session brew. Another very good job by Victory, would definitely recommend."
"Overall a very good beer for what Victory was apparently shooting for- a hoppy pilsner. Not bad at all"
"Poured a bright straw colour with white frothy head which dissipated quickly. No lacing in the glass. Grassy and earthy aromas. Dry, hoppy flavour with a dry and slightly bitter finish. Light and refreshing, good to have with food as there are no over-powering flavours. Certainly a very drinkable beer, but I prefer the Czech Pilsners much more."
"My first victory beer and I found it very enjoyable. Look forward to trying their other beers."
"D - Definitley a session beer for anytime of the year."
"A golden beauty with very minimal head that remains for just a few seconds. Excellent carbonation that gives the impression of champagne. Aromas of yeast, malt, grains, and hops. The taste is an excellent example of this style with it's crisp, bitter taste upfront followed by a dry finish. Hop bitterness dominates the malt, but both flavors are detectable. The carbonation simply addes to the dry, hop profile. The aftertaste is quite bitter, but not unpleasant or overly dominant. A refreshing beer with good taste. I can easily have a few of these."
"Bright golden/yellow Beer. perfectly transparent with lots of carbonation. Smells sweet malty with some piney hops. It is a little sour smelling. It really smells like a pilsner...not much more to it. The hops hit you first. quite piney. The sweet malts take over at the end. It is a straightforward beer and well balanced. A little astringent, but not in anyway that takes away from the beer. Light to medium body. Very drinkable. Everything about the beer makes me want to take another drink."
"Drinkability -- Indeed very drinkable. I'm surprised by how much I like this beer. I pretty much wrote-off the pilsner style as being boring; boy was I wrong. I can see myself drinking a few of these every so often. I will be coming back to this beer very soon."
"Prima Pils is always in my fridge."
"After seeing this beer on several top pilsner lists, I finally found it at my local market. After taking my first sip, I realized why. Pours a hazy but bright straw yellow. This tells me this beer has not been refined over and over just to make it clear like budwieser or miller lite. Nice white head that fades quickly, but leaves traces of its self all down the glass. Crisp and clean this beer bites your tongue with a nice hoppy edge, but not overdone. So refreshing and drinkable! Floral hops blend well with malt character. I won't often say this, but this is better than almost every pilsner I ever drank in Germany and Eastern Europe. You have to praise the guys at Victory and all great free-thinking American brewers who never limit themselves. Prost!"
"Mouthfeel is very light and drinkable. A good attempt at an aggressive pilsner for a US brewer, but I'd still prefer the Czech versions."
"from the bottle.was sitting at the bar at kuhnhenns when Brett brought this over to me. poured a yellow, with white head. aroma wheat, yeast, asome sourness, hop, and some malt. flavor, hops, malts grainy, as it warmed got honey and citrus. mouthfeel was dry would be a good session beer."
"Mouth feel is light bodied and highly carbonated."
"Opinion: Now this is an anomaly of beer in my opinion. It definitely has the malt presence of a true Pilsner beer, while the hops is probably more assertive than the most hoppy Northern German Pilsner that I have tried. If I were to guess, this is pretty close to a hopped up version of Jever Pils. Yet Jever has a bit more sweet balance in the finish. This is still a mighty fine beer."
"Overall Impression: A quality pilsner. In the style of Urquell but with a bit more assertive hop presence. For all the bitter, it doesnt pucker. I think the carbonation is a touch high and the transparent appearance kind of throws me a bit, but a quality beer none the less. I cant see this being a session beer; its scratching my beer itch pretty quickly."
"You'll know if you'll like it before you taste it. The smell is that strong and distinct. Grainy flavors. A hops smack stonger and sharper than just about any pils you've tried. Some subtle hints of sweet and tart fruit. This is highly drinkable in the sense that you'll want to have more, not in the bogus sense that it's so, ahem, bland that it doesn't put up any fight going down. This beer is soft and light on the palate, but it's also interesting and for real for real. Probably my favorite Pils. If you have macro-swilling friends, this might be a good crossover beer to shove down their naive palates, or it might just be more than they can handle."
"Pours a clear light straw with a big thick white head and excellent lacing. Smell is herbal hops and grassy with some lemon notes. Tastes very hoppy, mostly herbal but with some spiciness. However there is also enough bready malt to provide some balance. This beer has a very nice clean but substantial mouthfeel. Very nicely carbonated with a dry finish. Very drinkable. Overall- awesome pils. Easily the best I've had of the style."
"D- Outstanding. I will definitely come back to this. Easily my favorite in the pilsner category."
"Straw yellow and brilliantly clear with a fluffy white head. Great lacing and excellent head retention. Crisp aroma with spicy saaz, fresh floral hops, and a bit of lemon sitting on top of light pils malt sweetness. Malty sweetness just balances out contributions from the hops. There's an oily hop bitterness that's quite forward and carries through the finish. Hop flavour is citric and floral with just a hint of spiciness that kicks in towards the end. Light body with moderately high carbonation, but this beer doesn't come close to feeling watery. The texture is a bit slick and there's just a little residual sweetness that keeps the finish from drying out too much. This is a very refreshing beer packed with hops. Definitely my kind of pilsner."
"One of the best pilsners I've ever had, this is almost a perfect session beer."
"This is a very fine beer for enjoying with food because of its dryness. I haven't had this one repeatedly, but it seems to be an ideal session beer."
"The best pilsener I've tried yet. Can't wait to try it on tap."
"Straw colored with a fine white head. Classic pils aroma with hints of hay and pale biscuity malts. Soft, grassy Saaz nose. Becomes slightly doughy, with hints of flowery honey and white toast, staying perfectly crisp throughout. Maybe a tad fizzy when cold. Clean finish. Really refreshing. A nice American alternative to Bitburger Pils, but a little more robust and flavorful, in a good way."
"Outstanding drinkability I could drink this all the time except there was only one case of this at the Pasadena BevMo."
"Smooth, bubbly and delicious, this is an awesome pils and is extraordinarily drinkable."
"A great beer from Victory. Now I know what all the fuss was about. Poured out to a light gold color with medium carbonation and a nice white foamy head. Looks like the proverbial ""Beer"" you see in cartoons and on TV. Aromas of hops, malt and sweet earthiness fills the nose. Very nice. Taste is delectible; hops, malt, sweet spices, citrus and floral notes fill the palate, all the while remaining smooth and crips. Light mouthfeel is refreshing and smooth. A high level of drinkability is found here, as this brew could easily be a session beer or a cross over point for many macro drinkers to see the light of day in a craft brew world. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is a good pils but I had heard so much about this beer I am kind of disappointed. The maltiness is full and crisp as expected from a pils with a nice hop flavor. Certainly nothing to complain about, but I expected more from the number one rated beer for the style (as of today)."
"Highly reccomended pils and at a fair price for this much quality."
"Pours out to a sparkling clear pale straw golden, forming a soft white head with good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate-strong. Mouthfeel is zippy yet smooth, and finished with a slight astringency, making this one very easy to drink. The aroma is very soft with a traditional Saaz nose, freshly mown hay, and delicate pale malts. The taste is initially floral and spicy with Saaz, followed by a subtle grainy pale malt body, nicely balanced with a moderate bitterness. The aftertaste is bittersweet and haunted by spicy hop overtones. Very flavorful and an excellent example of the style. Delicious."
"Drinkability: One fantastic pilsener - my favorite example of the style"
"A great golden color,a full three finger head.Best looking pilsner I've seen.A great dry hoppy taste,very dry,very clear with lots of bubbles.If distribution was larger it would mean the end of the large macro beers.A great pilsner from one of my favorite brewers."
"Rucksicht Bier!!!"
"Slàinte!"
"Re-tried on tap at the Gingerman (NYC) and I was very impressed once again by the fragrant hoppiness of that one. Bottles dont keep their freshness very long, but this particular pint was vibrant with floral, herbal, spicy hops that overcame the soft, biscuity malts. Immensely dry and satisfying to me hence the score bumping up."
"Pours almost clear very pale gold out of bottle. Not much head, it goes away very quickly. Nice aroma that reminds of Pilsner Urqel (sorry for the spelling). First sip reveals a nice smooth lager with some hops bitterness detectable. A bit of meat on this pilsner not like a watery lager. It could use a little more malt taste. A fine alternative to Czech pilsners that don't survive the trip over the seas."
"Not only did I sample this as soon as I could (per NC, oh and Pop the Cap was still in effect), I picked some up for later. A great example of a pilsner, or at least a pilsner on vacation in America."
"Overall: What a great beer, this one of my overall faves. The 1st time I had a Prima I didn't really care for it. However, its now one that I enjoy year round. Very crisp and clean, extremly sessionable, don't limit yourself to drinking this fine Pils only when its hot, its a damn good beer anytime of the year. Another staple of my beer fridge."
"One of the few micro pilsners that I found most enjoyable."
"Pours light and golden with a bright white two finger head that lingers around for quite a while. I did not notice much of a nose with the exception of a light hop aroma. Taste is bright, crisp, and clean with a great hop backbone and hints of malt. Body is light with a long hoppy finish. A great brew from Victory and a great session beer. A favorite of mine for a hot summer day."
"Prima Pils produces a nice finger and a half head of eggshell foam. Pristine and golden. The head fades leaving a ring and lace that clings sporadically along the glass. Smell is faint with hints of hay and apple. Mouthfeel is light, crisp carbonation and dry. Taste is light toast and biscuit malts. A tiny bit nutty, with a light but lasting hop finish. Drinkability is amazing. The most refreshing beer I've ever had. I could see myself sucking down a case of these on a hot summer night. It's THE perfect summer beer and what any Pilsner should aspire to be."
"Overall: The hops and the malt are in great balance and in large quantity!"
"Again, this is the Pilsner that all other should be judged by"
"Taste is that of a real solid gold colored beer. Nothing fancy here, just clean malt with some more pilsener hops. There is a slightly skunky character but it is very subdued. It does have a lemony finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and tingly. A little on the sour side but pleasant. Extremely drinkable beer. Seems like it would be very versatile for pairing with food. I think I may actually prefer the bottled version on this one but this draught is quite good too."
"I would love to have better access to this beer, I would always have some handy for a hot summer sunday."
"Body and Drinkability - Great on both counts. The body is light without being thin and really there is nothing about this beer to get tired of."
"Overall = An outstanding beer and by far my favorite pilsner. Would fit very well on a hot summer BBQ or any warm day when you're quite thirsty. I'd never turn on down and highly recommend you try it."
"Overall a splendid rendition of a very difficult style to nail. I adore the hopped-up approach this beer is noted for. The awesome balance of the dryness-to-sweetness is unmatched. The only thing I'm not happy with is that it's taken me so long to get my hands on some. Move over Sierra Summerfest and Dortmunder Gold, Prima is taking the top bunk."
"I have yet to have anything else like it...no aftertaste at all (clean), pronounced hop flavor, and superb drinkability."
"A very good sixer. Why aren't all pilsners this good? I haven't had any truly ""german"" pilsners other than ""Old German"" which this it is not. Bitter just a bit with rounded grainy flavors and made this better than anything you buy from BMC or even some micros. Again, this is not my preference in beer types, but if I want something light with a lot of flavor, I'll look for this."
"Gorgeous golden color-positvely flawless in appearance. Low carbonation level. Low aroma. Some sweet malt. Almost a trace of citrus. Good malty flavor-very clean tasting. Slight hop bitterness to round out the whole thing. Smooth body-has that soft ""creaminess"" you find in a great pils. Very drinkable. Dont know why I hadnt tried this one from Victory yet. Damn good beer."
"Pours a medium light gold with a huge head, great longevity and great lace. Smells of a sweet malt with a spicy hop presence - exactly how a pilsner should smell. A sweet malt first hits fllowed by a spicy earthy hop flavor and bitterness. A bit to hoppy - I think. A bit out of balance. I realize that they are supposed to be a bit hoppy but its just a too much for me. Upon a second sip I detect some citrus and grassy flavors. A excellent example of the pilsner style, but just a bit too hoppy in my opinion. Still a quality and tasty beer though."
"Light golden yellow color with a big foamy head. Great looking lacing and head retention. Smells nice and hoppy. A banquet of spicy of floral hops hit the nose with a bready malt in the background. The taste is absolutly delicious! Spiced with hops to perfection. Pine like bitterness hits the tounge first and then evens out to a softer floral flavor. It's like the hops are in a tuga-war with the malts because the malts are trying to keep the hops in check. Dry hoppy finish. Smooth medium body and perfect drinkabilty. Damn this is good drinking. I love a great pilsner during the summer time, but this one threw me off guard. True to the style but a lot hoppier. This could be one of the most delicious pilsners I have had."
"Awesome pilsner. Has no equal on this side of the pond."
"A nice change of pace and a perfect summertime brew."
"The smell is somewhat floral with light malts underneath. The taste is quite good, being light yet full of flavor. Hops come through in a solid fashion but do not disrupt the rest of this beer. The mouthfeel is pleasing while the drinkability is very high."
"My bottles says enjoy by 4/2/05, but I've been drinking them and they taste fine to me. Pours a clear straw color with a finger of white head that dissipates pretty quickly to a ring. Nose is pretty hoppy--both floral and citrus coming through over a sweet malt. Taste is a refreshing light malt with an aggressive grassy hop finish, with some caramel and lemon notes coming through here and there. Bitterness lingers for a while after each sip. Medium bodied, this beer has a nice crisp mouthfeel. This is definitely one of the better tasting pilsners I've had, especially for hopheads."
"Victory Prima Pils 12 oz. bottle opened with a smooth hiss and not too much carbonation. The poor was even and left a good head. The head fell quickly, but settled leaving about a 3/8"" cap that lasted through the whole glass. The brew had a light straw color and a clarity that could only be attained through filtration. A hefty amount of Saaz was detected in the nose, likely from dry hopping, and this German Pilsner also had a liberal amount of hops in the taste. I am happy over all with this brew; it pours clean, has enough head to keep its carbonation, and has a good serving of Saaz."
"I was pleasantly surprised."
"Truth be told, I usually dont like pilsners very much, but I highly recommend this beer... excellent example of the style."
"Victory Prima Pils pours a crystal clear golden color with a thin white head. In my Pilsener glass, small bubbles continue to rise through the beer as I drink. Aroma is hoppy and slightly spicy and very crisp. Taste is light malt, with an amazingly refreshing crisp dry hoppy finish. Perfectly balanced. Light mouthfeel, with a lot of carbonation. Very refreshing and drinkable beer. In my opinion, Prima Pils could define the style."
"This pils pours a fairly small head, maybe about .5 to 1 finger. The head does leave traces throughout the whole drinking experience. The color is pale and golden. Quite clear. The smell is defintely floral hops, with a hint of malt. The taste is similar, semi sweet malt with a good amount of floral hops. There is also a very slight citrus taste. The hops are strong and the flavor is somewhat bitter. The mouthfeel and drinkable are strong and enjoyable."
"Pours very pale gold in color with a nice foamy head. Nose has a very pleasant floral aroma. Taste is nice and hoppy-strange for a pilsener. THe malts come through as sweet but then the tongue is quickly surrounded by hops. Slight metallic tinge too, but not bad at all. It is just present. The hops kind of surround the taste buds after a while. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp and full of hoppiness. Very drinkable and hard to put down."
"Pours an extremely clear pale gold color with a bit of white fluffy head that disappears rather quickly. Smells slightly sweet and citrusy, but mostly herbaly. Clean. Taste is a crisp, dry, hoppy flavor. Slightly bitter. But mostly hops, hops, hops, and I kind of like it that way. Mouthfeel is good and bubbly, a very full taste and feel. All in all, quite refreshing and light."
"Andy"
"the pils for the beer snob having a pool party, very good on a hot sunny day being lazy by the pool, I'll definitely be picking up more of this during these summer months"
"The mouthfeel is once again quite crisp. The hops have quite the spicy bite and dry bitterness. Very well done, and VERY highly drinkable. It's a shame I can't get more of this to share with some of my schwag-beer drinking friends. Thanks to GCBrewingCo for this, as well as several other assorted goodies from Victory and other brewers."
"d: downright poundable, up to 4.5"
"Drinkability: Just enough character to keep you interested without making it to loud. It wont burn out your tastebuds and the clean, dry finish makes each sip call for a another. A very good, solid pilsner. Definitely worth a try."
"12 oz bottle provided by FoolCircle as part of BIF20. Pours a two finger fluffy nearly white head over a crystal-clear light straw colored liquid. Smells of grassy and zinging hops (Saaz, probably). A gentle malt is also present, but way below the floral of the hops. Tastes bitter hoppy with some zing to start. Sharp and a bit of metallic. The middle is predominently malt sweet with honey qualities...perhaps a hint of caramel. The ending is another hoppy burst. A bit more floral, but still with the metallic quality. There may also be some hallertauer flatness in the aftertaste. Medium body, mildly carbonated, and great lacing on the inside of the glass. Really nice beer and quite drinkable."
"This poured with a light head, white in tone, which quickly dissipated. It had a very floral nose with a rather light mouthfeel. There was a great non-overpowering hoppiness in the mouth. The finish was very clean, very dry. All in all, a very beautiful beer. Someone needs to remind me why I used to pooh-pooh this beer. I feel as though I am born-again. It is certainly a beer that could be a session beer, and especially during the summertime."
"Take a sip and you get an immediate attack of herbal and citrusy hops. This is a lot more intense than any other pilsner I've had. A touch of sweet malt keeps it from becoming overwhelming, although I wouldn't call it balanced. Still, remarkably smooth and drinkable. Even though I tend to be a bit of a wuss when it comes to the hops, I found this to be a delicious beer that would be suitable for damn near any purpose."
"This pils poured a slightly hazy, golden color with creamy, white foam that persisted and clung to the glass a bit in clumps. The smell was dominated by hops with both bitter hops and light floral hops, together with some malt. The taste was malty and hoppy with some floral hops and some biscuity maltiness. Very nice flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and almost creamy with medium body and good, strong carbonation, especially up-front. The aftertaste was lightly hoppy. This is a delicious session beer, and is perfect for the summer months."
"The hops are really ratcheted up on the palate- a very clean yet substantial bitterness dominates. There is just enough malt to keep things from getting coarse but that is all. The finish is dry and crisp, and the lemon peel hop elements linger for quite a while. As with the nose a touch of alcohol finishes things off. Not exactly my cup of tea, but quality stuff nonetheless."
"A very drinkable beer, that I bought as a hot weather thirst quencher, but I would drink all year round. The only problem I see with this, is my inability to stop drinking it!"
"Overall: so easily drinkable, so superbly hopped! Easily my favorite beer by Victory. Hope that Victory can get some fresh Prima Pils sent out to the West Coast soon. It'll be a DBF staple."
"If I didn't like IPA's so much, this would be my everyday beer. Not too strong, not too weak, just right. A session beer looking for a session."
"I'm hoping the lack of carbonation is a fluke. This sample was hand carried from the East Coast (thanks rapopoda!) but I doubt that could have caused any problems. I'm looking forward to sampling some more ""Prima"" Pils in the hopes that the next one is more typically carbonated. (if so, I'll re-rate to be fair) It's a shame because the taste was so incredible..."
"Perhaps the hoppiest pilsner I've ever had. (I swear that this beer had slight green tinge to its golden hue.) The aroma is wonderfully spicy. Hops show themselves quite a bit in this pilsner, but mostly in the middle and in the nose. The bitterness is apparent, but not as striking as one might expect. The malt flavor is crisp and clean. The mouthfeel is smooth and the body firm. Perhaps a bit fuller bodied than most German pilsners that this beer seems to imitate, but what more can you ask for in a microbrewed pilsner beer?"
"Pours a clear golden straw hue with a half-inch stark white head. Nice carbonation. Great nose of sharp floral, grassy hops and crisp, clean lager yeast. Palate begins with more of the same, then develops a sharper hoppiness. Finish is lightly bitter, with light notes of citrus and black pepper. Medium body is standard for a pilsner. An excellent, thirst-quenching beer perfect fora warm June evening."
"Nice light golden color and tons of carbonation bubbles. 1/2"" white foamy head that disipated a little too quickly. Nice malty smell with a light floral aroma and a grassy overtone. Taste starts out with a grassy and slight citrus note that is followed by a nice bitterness for the aftertaste. Well balanced beer, the bitterness dosn't overpower and actually becomes less noticable as you finish the beer. Very drinkable beer especially @ $25/case. Will be on my regular summer rotation."
"very enjoyable"
"This is an excellent choice for a session brew, or something to have with dinner. I'm impressed."
"Overall, a great pils which is very easy drinking."
"Drinkability is very high. Abolsutely thirst quenching and refreshing. Definitely a bit of an American twist on a great style but well worth seeking out."
"However, when the sun is shining and friends are in abundance, as is almost always the case in the summer months, I make it my business to have a case on hand. Fortunately this is readily available in the area, and it can't be beat for a truly rewarding hot weather brew."
"Great German Pilsner that was only $2.50 a pnt last night at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte. Enough head and lacing and tons of carbonation that tickled the tongue. Smooth tasting, with hints of honey and clove. One of the best, if not the best, tasting pilsners I can recall. Though it could be a session beer, I had this last after a long evening of tasting and took a bit longer to finish. Keep cooler than room temperature."
"All in all, I'm very, very happy that Brixx added this beer to their lineup."
"D: This is a supremely drinkable summertime pilsener even if the carbonation isn't the smoothest. I can't find any reason not to reach for another bottle - even after already having a few. Nice job, Victory!"
"This beer pours a light golden color with a large foamy egg white head. Head recedes to a small layer above the liquid. Not really any lacing, only a few bubbles rise to the top. Smell is slightly hoppy but more grassy but in a good way. Taste has much more of a hop precense than the aroma. I guess I might be used to the whole dry hopping thing but this doesn't really seem dry hopped. Quite a full body which takes the main stage with a nice herbal element. Hops are nicely noticeable but not stinging in any way. The spicyness of the hops work with the rest of the flavors in near perfect harmony. They just work with the rest of the beer beautifully. Finish has little acidity and lingers with a hop bite. Great beer here, probably the best pils I have ever had. I need to get me some pilsners from Germany and compare but this is damn excellent."
"Pours a nice light golden colour, sparkly with a small head that quickly dissipates. Smells like sweet malt, with a little bit of up front hop bitterness. It's tasty, sweet at the front, pretty full and malty, and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Pretty full for a pilsner, lots of flavour and very enjoyable, probably one of the best pilsners out there. Definately a fine session beer."
"Another solid brew from Victory. These guys continually impress me."
"Mouthfeel is light and airey yet maintains a full and rich mouthfeel. This is a good beer for any time, any place, or any occasion. Are all micro-brewed pilsners this good?"
"The taste is great. Not overpowered by Saaz, like the last time. The pils malt is complimented by some specialty. The hop profile is a mix of something noble and something domestic tasting. Slightly bitter but with a perfectly crisp compliment. Also, very drinkable and excellent for beer."
"Light gold in color with a medium amount of carbonation. The smell is fairly malty, with a good dose of floral hops. The malt flavor in this one is quite unique, taking on some wildflower honey type qualities. The hop flavors are both grassy and floral, and contribute a bracing bitterness to the mix. I'd drink this regularly if it were available locally, and it's inspired me to homebrew a clone of it sometime in the near future."
"Light gold color - almost clear - with a small frothy head and good retention. Spicy hop aroma that gave it a unique taste. Very light bodied and carbonated. Slightly dry mouthfeel and very crisp and clean. Definitely a drinkable beer but I don't think this would be my choice to drink all night long. Overall, I enjoyed this beer and it went very well with the chili I made for dinner, but it's something I would only want to drink once in a while, not keep my fridge stocked with."
"An excellent warm weather beer. I could drink these all night and still want more."
"Pours a pale yellow, golden color with a small white head that dissapates quickly, and it is quite clear. The smell is big, juicy hops with a spicy background, seems like saaz hops and there is a light malt scent in the background. The taste is also dominated by hops, you get a resiny hop oil flavor as well as a citrusy tartness to it. The saaz hops really make themselves felt with a spicy middle followed by a biscuity malt flavor to balance the finish. The finish is dry and refreshing. The mouthfeel is smooth like a pilsner should be. This is a great summertime brew and im glad it's available in NC now."
"An absolutely outstanding pilsner. Poured a beautiful near clear color with hints of gold: an amazing site to behold. The smell was faintly sweet, being enjoyable. The taste is just short of exceptional-nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp and refereshing. Definitely a beer to purchase in abundance and enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Great, a great beer for a BBQ out in the backyard!"
"I will be sure to keep extra of this on hand. Now if it came in cans for the beach, that would be grand."
"Mouthfeel... nice. Not heavy, but some depth to it. Drinkability also good. I would go back for this one again, when the mood for this style comes about."
"This beer poured a bright, pale gold to yellow, very clear with a thick white head composed of large bubbles. The head receded quickly, and left a dapple of lace on the side of the glass. I could smell the hops (Saaz?) from 3 ft away. They really dominate the aroma with a crisp citrus character. No malt really comes through in the nose. The taste is a light crisp hop-forward flavor that again has the citrus, a subtle grapefruit character that has an almost earthy tone. This delivers an assertive bitterness to the beer. The malt is completely overcome by the hops. This is not a bad character. Very crisp and refreshing mouth feel. Highly drinkable. What a great summertime beer. Pilsners have not been my favorite beer for several years, but this could change my mind."
"Pours a very light, very pale yellow color with a bubbly white head. Slight chill haze is present. Crisp lemony nose also includes a lot of maltiness. Some grass is noted, as well as citrous hops. Hops immediately bite your tongue and don't let go. Bitter lemon transitions into some interesting spiciness. Bready malt attempts to balance the bold hops. Finish is spicy with some herbal qualities, backed by malty smoothness with some grassiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean and finishes quite dryly. Light and refreshing, drinkability is quite high for this one (especially with the approaching warm weather). I was expecting this to be hoppy, but it exceeded my expectations. I've never had a beer this light that was as aggressively hopped. Quite interesting, and very tasty."
"Maybe this is what Pilsner Urquell used to taste like. Pours a clear straw color, big head that dies down. Good Lacing. Aroma is similar to fresh cut grass, but not as strong. Taste is huge, hops are there, but very well balanced by the malt. Mouthfeel is a tad thick for the style, but I like 'em thick. This is great stuff. About time they distributed into Michigan!"
"[editted because I ddi ont sepll cehkc]"
"The taste is very hoppy, but not powerfully bitter or oily. These are the noble hops that are advertised on the box. They are very earthy, grassy, herbal, and chewy, but not bitter and not palate-shredding. There is some balancing sweetness but I can't say it balances it out completely. This is supposed to be hoppy and it pulls it off spectacularly. Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation and a smooth finish. Something I could drink over and over."
"Drinkability cannot be improved upon. A great session beer with exceptional flavor that will keep me coming back for more."
"The taste was surprisingly bitter. The first couple of sips acclimated my taste buds to this new and exciting beer I had especially for their delight. Faint lemony flavours showed up in the finish . The hops seemed to outweigh the pilsner malts in the taste. Which was absolutely fine with me. Good, bold flavour and a refreshingly crisp and dry ending. I could surely sit around in the summer time and pound these suckers like so many railroad spikes. Nice."
"Drinkability- Probably would be one of my got to pils if I had easy access to it. Nice change of pace with the heavier hop profile. Nice session brew."
"This has to be one of the best Pils I've had. Top notch."
"Bright yellow with slight, oh so slight, particles in the swirl. Foamy 1 inch head, with some lacing. Nose is hops and zest and it flows right into the taste. Crispy, bready, hoppy quenching fluid bathes the mouth. Wonderful not overly dry finish. This is a fine beer that drinks easy and has a lot of character. I bought one to sample, now I'm off to get a sixer."
"Poured from a 12 ouncer labeled Enjoy by Apr 02 05. Pours a bright, clear, golden yellow. Generous frothy white three-finger head makes itself known as the cap is popped, sticks around for a while, leaving some sticky lace. Nice lookin' beer. Nose is delicate but definite, malt and grassy hops. Grain/malts start out, quickly overcome by pleasant citrus and bitter hops that back off but leave a dry finish. Definitely a Pils for a hops lover! Lightly carbonated, drinks far too easily, wish I had another! Thanks kafkaEsb, for the chance to try this one."
"Color is perfect. Nose while delicate has a definite and detectable balanace of malt and hop. The taste is just over the top. Sublte sweetness on the front end with an exceptionally clean, crisp, and dry back end. Carbonation on draft was excellent leaving nice lace rings down my pint glass. Great beer!"
"Pouring into a pint glass, it pours a straw color (pale gold) with a dense white head that tends to not dissipate too quickly at all, which is nice. Aroma is of citrus fruits (grapefruit) and some hops and spice. A touch of alcohol also hits my sinuses. Taste is soft spice and citrus flavors with a mild piney hop flavor. Sugary sweet grapefruits hit your palete on the finish along with some slightly bitter hops. Overall, this is pretty smooth and silky with some tingly carbonation throughout. Overall drinkability is pretty decent but I tend to not be a huge Pilsner fan."
"12 ounce bottle sampled, comes with freshness dating on the label. Pours a nice shade of quite light golden amber.Snow white head,leaves moderate lacing. Nose is spicy,fresh lemony hops. Medium bodied, crisp and refreshing brew. Loads of resiny and cirtic hops stand out in this bold and flavorful quafer. Great with many foods, fine everyday brew/sessioner."
"A bright golden yellow brew with nice lacing. Hoppy smell for a pilsener! Taste is very smooth and malty with a nice hoppy aftertaste. An herbal flavor is present throughout which is somewhat grassy with a very mild bread flavor. Mouthfeel is Dry. Overall this beer is very enjoyable and would be an excellent session beer."
"Pours a pale spun gold colour with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is a little grassy, and spicy. You can tell this thing is gonna have some hops. A bit of biscuit malt shows up but is put back in its place by the hops. Taste is crisp and clean. A subtle malt sweetness gives way to the crush of hops. Grassy, floral, spice are all there in the finish. The beer does stay in some what of a balance however and never goes over the top in terms of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is nice with good carbonation which helps enable a crisp clean mouthfeel. Never does the hoppiness feel heavy. Drinkability is good. This would be great on a summer day sitting on the deck while chillin and grillin. I had not had this in a while and was definitly impressed with the reintroduction."
"Clear gold pour with a thin white head of small bubbles. Smell is malty and grainy with a lots of clean hop scent. The taste itself is grainy and toasty, with a nice dry complexity in there. More hops than a typically expect from the style, but the bready malt flavors are very much to the forefront as well. As drinkable a session pils as you're likely to find; this one is a high point even for Victory."
"Medium bodied with a smooth carbonation that floats over the palate. Incredibly easy to drink...this is a damn tasty, refreshing brew. I think this could easily convert some folks to better beer. I will be looking for a sixer soon!"
"This may be the best pils in existance. Pours clear gold with a fluffy white head. The aroma is lightly malty with a floral spiciness and earthy hop aroma. The flavor starts off clean with a spicy and fruity hop flavor followed by the appropriate bitterness. The malt flavor is light and clean and the mouthfeel is medium light and very smooth with ideal carbonation. This beer served properly, is absolutely delicious and thirst quenching."
"This brew is a pale straw color, nice big bubbly white head. Good lace follows that down the glass. Mix of lemony crisp malt and flowery hop on the nose. Crisp grainy malt front, lemon peel and a good level of bittering hops for this style. Fairly creamy, full mouth. Quite a refreshing beer that i will be enjoying after a day of blading this summer."
"I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. I finally split a 6er with clvand0. This one pours a nice straw color with a small head over top of the beer. The nose is divine. There is just a hint of lager scent in there, but there is also a really big noble hop presence along with a somewhat grassey malt. I like it. The flavor is also very nice, with a very crisp and clean spicey noble hop that hits first and fades to a really refreshing hop flavor, not bitterness. The malts provide just a slightly sweet background. Wow. So good. The feel is thin to moderate with a lively carbonation. Crisp and clean, this beer will definately make it onto my list of try again beers."
"poured a beautiful amber color typical of this style of beer. head was impressive. Taste was excellent, every time I drink this beer I like it more. The taste lingers in the mouth and makes you want to try another taste. I'm g lad Victory is close enough to my house for me to always have available"
"Overall-a fantastic beer and quite possibly the hoppiest pilsner in the world. Expertly crafted and simply worth all the praise that's been given to it. What more can I say that others haven't. A top notch beer in EVERY respect."
"This beer pours out a clear golden color with a rocky, white head. High carbonation level. Lemon aroma with honey and a hop spiciness. Crisp, malty flavor. Bitter hoppiness. Fuller bodied than your average pilsner. Tastes pretty good cold, but takes on a slightly bad husk flavor when warm. I remember liking this beer more when I had it about a year ago. Sadly, that's been the case with several Victory beers that I've had recently."
"Taste: Crazily smooth and drinkable. Has a strong hop profile that is held somewhat in check by chewy malt. Hops kept it slightly bitter, but they were very floral in nature. Not as hoppy as I remember with the bottle version, but still pretty darn tasty."
"Drinkability: crisp, light and refreshing; good session beer"
"Awesome pils, the date had me scared but man am I glad I gave it a shot. A real hop-head's pils."
"12 oz., with ""enjoy by 4/2/05"" on label. Pours into the pilsner glass a bright golden yellow with a 2 finger yead that leaves some lacing. Has a crisp metallic/grassy/grainy hop aroma. The beer has a nice bitterness that lasts and has a grassy/citric/floral taste that is very crisp and refreshing. The malts come through as the beer warms with the slightest hint of caramel. Feels nice and would be a good session beer. Would be easy to introduce this one to macroheads."
"poured witha big froathy creamy merangue like head on a golden colored body. sweet spicy aroma, grassy witha touch of yeast or could be bready malt. smooth delicate taste, good body witha alight sweetness. very solid hop character witha strong but lingering bitterness. I could drink this all day long and never get tired of it."
"Excellent German pilsner with more hops then the typical pils from the motherland. Light straw color with nice small head. Very nice lace that clings to glass. The smell is typical pils. But the taste is what seperates it from the pack. They hopped it up. Victory is the king of hopback. But not just for IPAs, it works for pils too. I love the Hallertau hops and this is a little over the top for the average joe six pack drinker. But just right for me as I love hops. This is a good combination of bittering and finishing aroma hops. Very drinkable. Easy to just reach for another. Ok, don't mind if I do."
"This differs from the bottled version, in that it is less brash and grassy, and more of the ""complete package," as they say. It's hard to say which I would prefer -- only that I would love either after a long summer afternoon cutting the lawn. Delicious."
"another fine victory brew. a solid version on a pils, its deep golden and vibrant, smells spicy and tangy, a bit hoppy for a ""normal"" pils. taste is much like the nose, lightly sweet grainy malt, lots of spicy hops (yet not overpowering), great balance....crisp and clean, finishes a bit dry. very nice. pilsners have few standouts...but i feel this is one of them. overall a very good refreshing beer."
"Judging by the reviews of others I thought I'd like this beer more than I did. I've recently been more into the not so intense beers meaning less stouts, porters, and double IPAs and more ESBs, lagers, and pilsners. Don't know why, it's just a phase I'm going through. Definately a little dissapointed by this beer though. There's nothing particularly bad about this beer at all, and there's nothing particularly good either. Pours a very light and bubbly clear yellow color, almost like a sparkling cider or champagne or something. Smell is vague but I can detect some spicyness and a light malt flavor. Taste is just a dud. Nothing bad, nothing good. I don't see the hop characteristics in this beer, as many have noted. Just some spicy characters and some bready biscuity malts, but nothing special. I've liked every other Victory brew I've tried, but this one falls short. Unless you're in the mood for a really plain beer, skip this one."
"Pours a cloudy, golden/yellow, with a light feathery head and vigorous carbonation. It has a robust and tangy nose, hoppy, but clean. It was hoppy, but with that sort of spicy, whit flavor. I liked it very much, but it defy's my limited vocabulary for beers like this. Very easy to drink, with enough 'tang' to make you feel like you are drinking something. Refreshing, even."
"Drinkability and Overall: This another fabulous offering from Victory. One by one, their beers just knock the styles near dead. This is a great pilsener, almost as good as most imports. A little less crisp than I'd like a pilsener to be, but all in all a great beer I'd have no problem making a session brew out of. Try it."
"It pours a deep gold color with a modest head and good lacing. The aroma is awash in sea air hops with a biscuit malt background. The components are very bold and compliment each other perfectly, incredible. The taste is dense mix of hop flavors with a full malt character. Theres a sharp bitterness up front which leads into Saaz ,earthy, floral, fresh mown hay hop flavors. The malt is biscuity and very thick. The mouthfeel is densely carbonated. This is one awesome pilsner, Id say my favorite of the style."
"Pours a clear gold under a one finger white head that is thin and short-lived, leaving just a few strings of lace. The nose is quite malty, with a bit of must in it and a touch of flowery hops. The mouth is light and very prickly. Very good pilsner taste profile, with a solid sweet malt introduction, followed by a significant flowery hops presence, ever so smooth yet delivering just the right bitter bite demanded by the style. The malt fades first, leaving a good bitter sensation at the back of the throat as the liquid disappears. The bite intensifies in the aftertaste, just as it should. Perhaps the head is weak because it is past its prime; nevertheless this is a first rate pilsner."
"This bottle may have been old as there was a lack of freshness to the hops however this was a well crafted pils that has lots of saaz hops and a full midbody. The finish is nice and bitter with a good ability to go with food. I would buy Pilsner Urquell in tall cans instead because of potential freshness problems in the PNW."
"Poured a pale gold topped by a foamy head with very good retention.Aroma was slightly grassy with heavy citrus overtones.After everything I've heard about this brew I expected something much better , I was ready for a treat, but actually I found this disappointing.I thought the taste was way too acidic and tangy ,kinda like orange juice.I expect a pilner too be much smoother and more balanced. An o.k.beer ..but just not my taste."
"Pours a slightly darker-than-straw color, with a small creamy white head. Grassy malt is very evident in the smell, with a little floral hops. Taste is malt dominated, very grassy, a little skunk, but definitely has a hops presence that the czechs and other euros are missing. Pretty good pilsner, one of the better ones i've had."
"A wonderful golden pilsener beer. This brew is a nice golden colour with a good head. The aromas are of fresh german hops and light bready malts in the background. Make no mistake this pils is a hop monster. The taste is hoppy up front and very fresh. The hops have a wonderful floral flavor and they almost taste 'green'. The malt flavors peak their heads around the corner of this brew before the hops pummel your tongue with a drying finish. The mouthfeel is spritzy and medium bodied and the drinkability is excellent to boot. An awesome pils. One of the best!"
"Light and refreshing. Again nothing special in terms of flavor, but not a bad version of the style. In all honesty, I'm not a big fan of the style, but Prima is a good version IMO. Worth a try if you like the style; if not, give it a shot anyway, you might be converted."
"A meringue-like head of tightly packed, pure white bubbles rushes up the sides of my pilsener glass on the pour. Head recedes very slowly and sticks well. Beer is canary yellow in color with shimmering highlights and exceptional clarity. Full aroma of lemony hops even at fridge temperature; a little warmth brings out a compact, leafy bouquet of lemon rind and wet grass clippings balanced by a slight puffed rice maltiness; finishes with some uric salinity. Lemon and hay flavors fill out the midpalate, with a strong bitterness--but not strong enough to overwhelm hints of starfruit and corn silk. Extremely persistent aftertaste suggests quinine and citric rind. Mouthfeel is light, wet, and very firm. I would rather have this as an apertif than drink it in session. The flavors here have clear affinities with parmesan cheese... ooh, now I'm starting to get some ideas..."
"The pour wasn't spectacular, looks pale yellow like most lagers and pilsners, the head was more frothy, lacing was nice. The smell has a nice toasted grain and yeast dough, a nice floral and citrus hop are very noticable. The taste is perfect, a nice light grain and toast upfront followed by a great but not overly powerful floral hop, a hint of lemon tingle to the hop as well, light bodied and a very good session beer. This is one of those beers than will convert those big 3 drinkers into craft lovers."
"Drinkability: In my oppinion it's way more overwhelming than a pilsner should be, no to mention way more expensive."
"Like a good white wine. Crisp pils with fruit, lemony citrus. Good straightforward pils, for a change. Good hops.Smooth, not much to look at, light yellow with cloudy mushroom head. Neutral aroma.Had it 5 years later, good but drying bitterness.ABove average mouthfeel."
"This was better on tap than my several bottle experiences. Golden in color, I also got a thin white head. I thought there was more malt in the aroma than any hops. Initial taste was of pleasing malt sweetness, with some good flowery hops as well. I did think that dropped out a bit, and I detected some grainy notes in the finish. I also appreciated the crisp carbonation."
"Frothy, initial quarter inch head with light lacing through the remainder. Crystal clear and golden with constant action going on, mesmerizing. Applejacks and juicy mango sweetness on the nose; hints of hop character. Crisp and thin body, though thin in this context still means more body than any of the macro-pils. Gentle sweetness and light hop profile make this a devastatingly endearing pilsener, to the point that I would make it an every day selection, well, at least for a pilsener."
"This is, I think, a great American beer, one which takes the traditional Pilsener style and transforms it into something new, especially with its bold hoppiness. Especially lovely in the warm summer weather. Don't get me wrong, I love the big beers too. But Prima Pils is my highest rated beer."
"Everything a good pilsener should be. Fizzy yellow with a moderate white head. The saaz hops were bling-blinging in the house, fo shizzle. It is every bit as good as a true pilsener such as czechvar or boom. I would go as far as saying that it's better. Great stuff."
"I tried this one back-to-back with another pilsener and I thought this one came out on top. I'd drink another anytime."
"Excellent pilsener, and one I'll be drinking regularly."
"Was finally able to find some fresh bottles of this stuff. Pours out a hazy yellow/golden color with a nice head which seems to stay for a while. Smell consists of hops. lemon, some fresh cut grass and some hidden malts in the backround to round it out. Taste consisted of some nice sharp hop bite with an underlying malt backround which balances quite nicely. Just the right amount of carbonation mixes in as well. Had a medium body which was right for this beer. On tap this has to rock hard. Never pass up on this pils, ever."
"Overall- yet another hum-drum Pilsner. Better than most, but this beer would serve its purpose on a Beirut table more so than served up in a glass. At $6.74 for a sixer I think its a little pricey."
"Great appearance, clear amber with a very nice 2 finger white head. Smell is dominated by hops, I can make out the usual pine, with a little citrus, but nothing else. Taste is hoppy, but still balanced. Primarily spicy hops at first, then more herbal as it goes on... very nice. Good mouthfeel, nice level of carbonation. Great drinkability, goes really well with food. Super-hoppy for a Pils, but overall just a really nice beer, even for someone who doesn't like hops too much."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden colored beer with almost no head. Carbonation is really weak which seems to be a problem with some of the Victory that I had lately. Aroma is quite subtle has I would expect of a pils but the taste is way too sweet for a pils. Im guessing they put too much of cascade hops in this. There is some way better pils out there."
"Taste is well balanced...a medium-sweet malt body is carried by typical pilsner hops profile... lemony, almost sea-grassy, spiced. Excellent drinkability."
"Final Thought: This and Stoudt's Pils rule this country, give it up for the Southeast PA brews..."
"Pours a straw pilsener color with a fluffy, white head that sticks around for a bit and then dissipates into a thin layer of lace atop the beer. Real grassy, spicy floral Saaz hop aroma. Decent pils malt backbone evident, too. Very hoppy and dry for a pils, not unlike Jever, yet even hoppier. A bit dry and bitter in the finish which just adds to its drinkability because it demands that one's palate should have another sip. This is not only the finest US-brewed pilsener I've experienced, it competes with its German and Czech counterparts quite nicely. This beer rocks. It is so balanced in all the right places. Pilseners, believe it or not, are one of the hardest styles of beer to brew to the point of exactness (a quality one that is), and, again, Victory's right on target."
"Wyll-"
"This wasn't bad, even with a little skunkiness. A fresh one of these would probably make a great session beer. It would perfectly suit the kind of weather currently occuring here in Spokane (hot, muggy, etc.). Worth trying if available."
"Sidenote: I'm not particularly a fan of pilsners but I tried this because of a strong recommendation from a friend. Since trying it that first time, I've always made room in the fridge for more, especially during warmer months. Also, be sure to drink this as fresh as possible. It definitely loses something as time passes."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The mouthfeel is ever so slightly thick due to the sweet malt. Good session beer."
"An overall above average brew. I am not a big pilsner fan, but I would definitely try this one again. Appearance was a nice clear medium yellow with a decent lacing head. Smell was light malt with some fruity essence. Taste was crisp with the smoothness of the malt followed by the fruitiness of the hops on the finish. Mouthfeel was smooth and crisp..very refreshing. Smoothness definitely added to drinkability. A great beer for a hot summer day."
"Pilsners are not my favorite style, but I could get into this interpretation. I could see this beer working well at a summertime bbq. Very drinkable beer."
"this brew pours a dark gold with a lacy 1"" head that retains fairly well. lacing is heavy. smell is saaz hops crazy . taste is also very hoppy for a pilsner but, delicious. perfect for a hot day. had a half a dozen at chestnut st. cafe (sharon, pa) after work. paired great with the rueben i was eating. mouthfeel was good. nice carbonation. very drinkable. recomended on draft...terrific."
"Bitter, bitter, bitter at first. If you hold it in your mouth long enough a mild malt characteristic begins to emerge, but the hoppy bitterness still dominates throughout. If you are a hophead, this may appeal to you. I'm not, and it doesn't."
"Quality Pilsener. Pale, pale gold in colour. Probably the most hoppy pilsener that i've had, really bitter aswell, grassy/haylike aromas, slightly honeyed. Pretty soft mouthfeel at the start, but the bitterness hads some sharpness and length to the flavour. Which is a good thing, coz its a tasty brew. Liked it very much."
"This beer pours with a cascade of bubbles, head is moderate. Nose is floral hops. Color is straw. Beautifully balanced beer, light biscuity malt with assertive hop presence that complexifies as you drink. Clean, well attenuated. Opens new dimensions in microbrew pilsners. Bravo!"
"Pilsner is a difficult style to brew a distinguished beer in, but Victory has done it. I wish I had it available here to pass the summers in Hotlanta. Thanks Foxman for the taste of Pennsylvania."
"this pilsner is probably one of the more flavourful brews within the style that i've sampled, and probably the most flavourful of those that adhere closely to the style, but it's still nothing spectacular. it pours a moderate golden colour thats a bit darker than many other pilsners. it's a tad less carbonated than a typical pilsner too, which is nice. head is thin and short lived. the smell is a bit buttery and hoppy. the taste is actually pretty good here, solid for a style i'm not particualry fond of, but still nothing to write home about. there's a slight sulfur flavour in the back throughout, which i find to be typical of the style as well. here it was subdued some which was nice. again, this is more in line with the traditional pilsner style. if that's your thing, than this is a brew you'd probably enjoy more than i. give me a hoppy, sweet troegs sunshine pils or the limited rouge 12th street pils any day over this one. a bit of a disappointment overall."
"A leader in the pilsner style. Pours a light yellow gold, very clear, could use a little more head. Smell is crisp and hoppy. Taste is excellent. Hops are true to style and remain well though the aftertaste. Very light, with little detectable malt. Extremely refreshing, a perfect summer beer that doesn't sacrifice on taste. An excellent pilsner."
"Taste is grassy and with a crisp, bitter hops finish. Floral and hints of grapefruit in the flavor profile. While crisp, the malt is actually a bit sticky in the mouth. I would like the mouth to be a bit more crisp and the stickiness to be muted but this is a damn tasty pilsener anyway. Really smooth and very drinkable. Oh how refreshing this beer is on a warm Georgia afternoon and oh how bitter I will be when this six-pack is gone and there is no more Victory of any kind to be found in this state."
"Beer is good. Happy pils beering."
"Goes down easy...begs you to have another. Six-pack would be perfect on a good relaxing friday evening."
"Overall, this is easily one of the best pilsners I've tried. Future consumption will most definitely be sought out. Huge thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for dragging this one to Ohio for me!"
"D&N: Yum. PA micros rule my world. This is a beer to make men weep."
"Overall: Fantastic European-style pilsner, a great lager for hop lovers. Easy to enjoy, will make a great summertime beer."
"Big ups to Bighuge."
"I've had the beer on tap and always thought it to be more bitter, but definitely a fine drinking pils."
"Drinkability - This was an odd flavor at first, but I did pour another right after finishing the first. The combination of flavors was very interesting, and warranted more attention. Low alcohol in this one, so can be consumed rather easily. I'd reccommend it for a new Pils experience."
"A wonderful beer on all counts."
"Pours a golden, hazy liquid with a big white fluffy head. Nice lacing on the glass throughout. Smells a little grassy and herbal. Taste is a slight sweet taste followed by a nice flowery hop finish. Good level of carbonation. Mouthfeel was fairly thin, which is good for the style. I found this to be pretty darn drinkable. I am surprised as pilserners are not a style I like a whole lot, but I found this refreshing and tasty. After a long winter with big, heavy beers, this was a nice change."
"Prima Pils was served from a 12oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a hazy straw-yellow color and was topped by a large rocky white head that left wonderful rough sticky tendrils of lacing. The nose was quite lively, consisting of a robustly aromatic orange tinged hop bouquet and a subtle yeastiness. The taste was refreshing, crisp, and bold. The firm bready grassy dry malt base was accented with bitter orange-lemon notes. It finished with a zippy dry orange peel bitterness, with very nice lingering qualities. The body was appropriately firm and carbonated to match the flavor profile. Conclusion: An excellent, nicely hopped pilsner that should please those who normally drink bigger/full-flavored beers. One of my favorite examples of the style."
"In the interest of full disclosure, I should state for the record that this is not my favorite style of beer -- so my review should take that into consideration. I liked the appearance more than many Pilseners. An even, full yellow -- hinting toward the dark side -- with a smallish white head that pretty much disappears shortly after the pour. The aroma is a bit malty-er than a standard pils -- but it still hit my nose with that wet grassy smell that I'm not overly fond of. It had a nice, but not big, mouthfeel, and a slightly sweet taste, mildly carbonated, with little or no aftertaste. For me, this is one of the better of this style -- just not my thing. Easy drinking, though -- it would be a good session beer on a warm summer day."
"Prima Pils is, without question, the single best German (American) pilsener that I've ever had. It would be enjoyable at any time of the year, but would be even better, no doubt, on a scorching summer day. Too bad it isn't available around here because I'd never be without it."
"The beer itself is a pilsner with some balls. It has a good malt flavor, robust for a pilsner, but nothing too exceptional. The smell is where you'll learn what this beer is winding up to throw at you. Spicy hops abound in smell and taste. The sharpness cuts through the smooth malt and prickles the tounge. Other herbal flavors run through, as if you just took a sickle to a field of flowers and grasses. The hop blend really is unique, and it stays on the tounge long after. I feel this is the point of contention among reviews. Some like that. Some don't. IMHO I like, or at least don't mind, hops sticking on the palette. This is really an exceptional brew, unlike anything I've had. May sound crazy, but I feel my sinuses clearing. It's not insanely hoppy though. I'd be curious if anyone knows the IBU of it. Let me know if you do. Regardless, it is a great big momma of a pilsner and worth a shot."
"Finding a bottle of this that's not expired is nearly impossible around my area. I jumped at the chance to try this on tap, and I was not disappointed. One of the best american made pilseners, if not the best."
"If my arm were twisted into getting a pilsner, I'd reach for this one with my good hand."
"It fells good going down, a nice light, well balanced beer. Very Very refesning break when going on the town with stuff like Storm King or Ruination. I could drink this all day and night, and, your non BA friends prob could tood. Enjoy"
"This was definitely a surprise. It's quite different from most pilsners I've had. It would be a great way to introduce semi-hop-phobic drinkers to the benefits that hops can offer."
"Light, crisp and dry, better than imported pilsners. I can't wait to try this with food, it should be awesome sitting on the deck in the summer with the grill going."
"Hop-dominated aroma. A little bit of light, dried bread malt is in there, but this is predominantly a mix of herbal, grassy hops and some more floral fragrances. Very light feel to it even though I would hardly describe this as a very light-bodied beer. Unexpectedly smooth from the first sip to the last. Malt sweetness is mild and is wiped aside quickly by a snappy hop bite that offers a really earthy, weedy, plant bitterness. Finishes, of course, pretty dry. Went down in a heartbeat. I was a little surprised, frankly. I was really expecting the hops to be overwhelming, and while they do dominate every aspect of this brew, I think they form much more ""accessible"" type of experience than many super-hopped brews out there. Much more herbal than sharp or outright bitter."
"I picked a six-pack of this up at the brewery. It's a good pilsner. I am not a big pilsner fan, but I would have not problem serving this to company. I believe, on a hot day, I could down a few of these. It's worthwhile picking up a six-pack of these. Victory's stuff is just consistently good."
"Drinkability is great and the flavor never dissapoints. This along with Hacker-Pschorr Hefe are my official lunch brews."
"This beer's head quickly dissipated, but it had a nice yellow lager color. The smell had a good whiff of hops. Which brings me to the taste... It had a nice hoppy taste a decent malt profile. The hoppiness is out of the ordinary for a lager so this was well appreciated. Not using cascade hops was a good idea as well. I really enjoyed tasting the different flavors and savoring the hops flavors. Quite drinkable and enjoyable."
"Bright yellow color with a thick tight white head. Clean aroma, fresh cut grass, wet hay and a bit of malt sweetness. Nothing making it stand out but it is nice. The flavor matches the aroma. A grassy up front with a hint of malt then back over to a bitter hop finish. This beer is smooth in the mouth and very drinkable. This has to be one of the better American Pilsners that I have had to date!"
"Clear pale gold, white head with little retention but some lacing. Smells of sweet pale malt, spicy, flowery German hops. Those leafy hops dominate this brew. Oh what a finish. The beautiful hops slide down gracefully and feel great. Too drinkable. Wow. Malt and hop flavor could mesh a tad better and the head retention should be improved, but damn this is a great beer."
"Pours into a German pilsner glass a clear straw yellow with a luscious and ample tightly knit white head. Profuse lacing and excellent head retention. Lemon pepper hits the nose first, followed by a touch of pale malts. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, and there is noticeable hops bite. Plenty of citric bitterness in the taste with minimal malt characteristics. A bit too much of an aggressive hops presence for my preference in a pils. Still a satisfying and very drinkable offering."
"The feel is full, crisp and quite solid; very nice indeed. Highly drinkable Pils to be sure."
"The taste is a little slice of heaven. Clean and smooth with just a small amount of caramel malt. Lots of hops fill in the end but they are very welcome and not overbearing. Mouthfeel is quite casual and drinkability is off the charts. This one slides down like an oyster with tabasco on it."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a lacey white head. The aroma is of pale malts and hops. It has a very bitter scent. The taste is decent. It is light and refreshing with quite a bit of hop flavor. Again, the beer has a very bitter taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. The beer drinks well, but it has a lingering aftertaste that may deter some from having more than one."
"This probably pales only by comparison to the other tap beers at the brewery. It is a nice clear, golden beer with small white head and almost no lacing. It smelled of hops and other grains. It had a more bitter taste (good thing) than most pilseners. I liked the hoppiness and the bite of it, but I caught a slightly off taste that came after swirling and swallowing. This will not be my choice of beers when I go back."
"It's hoppier than most pilsners in my admittedly limited experience, but this is a good thing. It looks refreshing, smells refreshing, and simply, is refreshing, as the flavor delivers on the visual promise. It's damned good, and demands to be drunk, and not just one either, so I did, but it doesn't haunt like so many higher ABV brews. I'm opening my palate back to lagers again, and I almost can't wait till summer to enjoy this on the deck after spending an hour tending to the lawn. Well, the beer I want, but not necessarily mowing the lawn. But you know what I mean."
"Beautiful yellow and mildy cloudy appearance with a clean white and tight head. Floral hop aroma mild new mown hay smell. Clean taste very refreshing with a salad or mild fish. Nicely carbonated with a mildly strong hop bittering. Overall, a wonderful Pils."
"Sweet pale malt at first fading to a dry harsh hoppy flavor. I am surprised at the harshness dispite only medium bitterness. Citrus flavors abound."
"Drinkability: A substantial pilsner... am glad I tried it and look forward to enjoying several more some steamy summer day."
"Another fine attempt from Victory. Poured a pale golden hue, with a soft fluffy head that I blew out of the way before first drink. The aroma was hoppy and the taste crisp, Pils are not my favorite in general but thiis my best experience with one to date. Drank all I had, so I say its drinkable."
"I have been trying a lot of IPA's and Pale Ale's lately so I decided on a whim to go with a Lager or Pilsner style this time around. This poured a beautiful clear gold, which I haven't seen in a quite a while (since drinking Foster's over the summer). A medium head about 1/2 inch settled and disapated quickly to a thin lace which stuck to the glass through the entire pint. The smell was full and floral with hoppy overtones. It smelled like what I used to call ""beer"" --- just better. The taste was full and light at the same time. A very crisp, not-to-bitter tingle with a nice balance of malt and hops which mellowed out on the tail end. There was a very slightly sweet taste but definitely not fruity at all. The carbonation added some ""lift"" to the glass and this was extremely drinkable. Victory is just amazing.... Hop Devil (my current fave, Storm King....) I have a newfound love for ""German"" style beers and this one may be perfect for winning over friends who ONLY drink Bud or MGD. I'm really glad to have found a nice ""new"" style to shake things up."
"It's a well-crafted product. Giant aromas of sticky, fresh herbs are followed by flavors of same. Slatey, intense, loaded with chewy hop stems and seed oils. The liquid is clear and there is a robust head of pillowy white. I search for malt and turn up honeyed, transparent shades of sweetness and silky texture. I would recommend this pils to hop addicts for sure. But for me, there is never a joyful balance of malt and hops. Overbearing in most contexts I can imagine, yet this hop explosion might serve a purpose in certain situations...like on a hay ride or after bong hits."
"This is another fine beer from Victory. Pours a gold / yellow color with a small head. Sports plenty of bubbles as the carbonation level is perfect. The aroma is pleasant with sharp bitterness and some sweetness. The taste and mouthfeel are wonderful - crisp on the tongue, strong hops, and sweetness that all balance out nicely. The bitterness last long (and still going) on the tongue after swallowing. Super refreshing and extremely drinkable. Love this pils."
"This is one of the better Pilseners I have tried (along with Schell), and leads me to wonder why so many other ones are so bland and tiresome. The beer is a lightly cloudy pale gold color with medium white head that lingered quite awhile. Lots of small bubbles and thin lacing. The aroma is zesty hops. Light-bodied and crisp with a peppery hops flavor throughout. Some malt is evident as well. The finish is dry and hoppy. The Pils style is nowhere near my favorite but I can see this beer being the standard by which to measure others."
"Appearance: Golden yellow, crystal clear, resilient head with lace. Smell: aromatic hops with a nice maltbackbone. Flavor: Clean, tasty malt sweetness very nicely balance by hop bitterness. Also very full hop flavors, somewhat earthy. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a nice tangyness from the hops. Very drinkable..an easy session beer. Not my favorite style by any means, but a good example of how good an honest pilsner can be, especially when it doesn't have to travel halfway across the world."
"John"
"note: freshness date is sept 28 '03, so this might be a little past it's prime."
"Well, to put this pilsner against most of the other pilsners I've ever tried is almost unfair. This has a gigantic hoppiness, the like of which I think I've never even come close to finding in another pilsner. And I don't want to say it's a great beer just because it has a lot of hops, but I do want to say it's a great beer because it has a lot of interest throughout, with a respectable malt base supporting a wonderfully captivating blend of hop flavors that lasts from the nose to the finish, all while still having the very dry spicy finish I'd expect from a pils... only with a nice addition of extra dimension."
"This is a pilsener? Wow - a whole new world of what a pils can be has opened before my eyes. Massive carbonation - took three pours to let the head settle and get the beer in the glass. Candy sweet aroma, but the beer was not sweet in flavor. Hops - this beer is an example of how a pils can be hoppy, and done darn well, at that. As a hop-head, I have great appreciation for a lager that can carry a substantial hop load without an ale's malt to shoulder the burden. Very crisp and clean, and, surprisingly, very little hop bitterness at the finish. If I had regular access to this beer, it would be a staple in the garage fridge."
"Great pilsner, enough said. Probably the best lager i have had in a long time. Looks a pale straw yellow, with a head that leaves an incredible amount of lace on the glasss, bordering on artwork. The nose is slightly hoppy, and quiter herbal. The taste is as smooth as it can get, they should call this stuff perfect pils instead. I will have this in the house all the time. The perfect baseball beer in my opinion."
"The Prima Pils is just a beautiful beer. The head especially comes up just right and is one of the prettiest beer toppings I've ever seen in my life. The rest of the beer is top-notch as previously reviewed, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better American-made effort at the style."
"Another classic from Victory. It has the perfect Pilsner profile: looks clean and refreshing, an immediate balanced sweetness, followed by a satisfying mouthfeel, and gradually finishing with that hoppy bitterness that lasts. Nice lace on the glass. A perfect summer beer that you can ""repeat as necessary"". A definite ""Buy it by the Case"". Don't share this beer with drinkers of ""lite"" or budmillercoors, they just don't get it, so don't give them any."
"Notes: This particular sample seems to have diminished in its hoppy flavor. It's a good beer, but lacking the bold flavor I recall from my last tasting of it."
"A nice bright golden color, that pours with a nice white head that disappears quickly. Has a nice appealing floral bouquet. The first taste is one of a soft malty flavor, which then finishes with a nice sharp hop bitterness that marries well with a bit of hop flavor. This is a great example of a Pils, which I wish I could get on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: Quite quaffable, though I've certainly enjoyed the other Victory beers I've had much more. Definitely a beer for the porch/stoop on a hot summer day. Could easily be a great session beer."
"This is one of my two favorite beers for this summer (Victory Wit is my other). When I was frist introduced to this one a couple years ago I was not prepared to be won over, but won over I was!! It pours a beautiful clear yellow color with a nice creamy head. The wonderfully fragrant hops are present immediately. There is a certain sweetness to this beer. It is WAY hoppier than most Pils, but heck, it is from Victory, and they know how to use their hops!! This beer is crisp and clean and full of flavor and not to be missed in your beer tasting endeavors!"
"Hazy straw yellow color, with a frothy white lingering head. Aroma of corn and hops. Flavor is sweet corn, with some hops, plus sweet malt. Finish has a tender bite with some spice. Nice smooth mouthfeel, with decent lacing. Damn good for a pilsner, perhaps the best I've had."
"I finally got my hands on this highly-touted pilsner. It being a Victory product, I had high expectations, and I wasn't disappointed. A thanks to my friend Dan and his daily stops at Premier. Poured a crystal clear yellow with a big marshmallowy white head. Smell is of peppery, spicy, hops with a slight, lean malt aroma. Taste: WOW! Lightly sweet malts up front that are quickly replaced with a building hop spiciness, punctuated with a sharp, bitter finish. Ahhh! Very crisp and a big feel for a pilsner. This is the hoppiest example of the style I have ever had and I love it. Finally, a lager-smooth IPA!"
"this is a unique beer, though. it's worth a try, just not my bag."
"Deep golden hue and a little haze,good foamy head.hoppy clean and delicate aroma. Bitter Saaz hops noted off the top, some malty sweetness as well, an almost tart on the palate. Seems to be borderline medium bodied based on the maltiness. A unique sweet and sour feel throughout, slight acidic finish. Hopped off the charts for a pils, unique, i tell my freinds this is an ale drinkers pils!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass it produced a huge fluffy head that did die down,yet didnt disapear, and laced the glass till the last drop. To the best of my recollection I smelled and tasted liberty hops this is the only time I have ever been able to pick out an exact hop taste or smell. Nice dry tasting malt comes in with the after taste and is really balanced with the hops. Could drink this beer all day on a nice summer day. Definitely a beer that everybody should try as it has something for everyone."
"This is one unique pilsner. If a brewery in germany ever decided to come out with an IPA (IPL)using their standard helles it would probably taste like this."
"Drinkability - A little more bang than I would normally expect in a pils, this is an intense beer. The freshness date said to enjoy by Jan 24, '03, so technically this is 6 months past peak. A fresh sample may improve scores, time will tell. For as much as I am impressed by the flavor uniqueness, that same character also limits its drinkability as you don't expect quite so much aggressiveness in a pilsner style. Maybe this should be classified an India Pales-ner Ale? :-)"
"Deep golden hue, thin, foamy head. Zesty, lemony, clean and delicate aroma. Bitter Saaz hops noted off the top, some malty chewiness as well, an almost sour palate. Seems to be borderline medium bodied based on the maltiness. A unique sweet and sour feel throughout, slight acidic and oily finish. Hopped off the charts for a pils, unique, might be in its own class, a beer to talk about!"
"Thanks to Francisweizen for the chance to try it."
"Draught @ Victory: The beer is a straw golden in color, with quite the white head. What an aroma: the beautiful smell of hops. An excellent Pilsner. Someone should send a couple cases of this over to Miller so those bozo's can taste a ""real"" pilsner, and maybe they will stop advertising Miller Lite as one!"
"Notes: Delicious little pilsener. Good times."
"Maybe I expected more from Victory...but I have had better pils...this was OK"
"The hop on the label is very appropriate for this beer. The crystal clear golden color and the fluffy white head are absolutely beautiful. This is why the style was devoloped in the first place. Aroma is of saaz hops as a pilsner should be. The taste is very hoppy, IPA level hoppy. For my taste this is fantastic, but I didn't feel the level of hops fits the style. And that's pretty much the only fault of this beer, but if I based my review on personal taste alone, it would be a 5 for taste."
"Victory's pilsner is one of the best around, and one I'd hand to someone who says all lagers are bland and tasteless. I'd heard rumors that Victory would discontinue this beer, and I certainly hope this isn't the case, because this is a fantastic brew!!"
"Kudos!"
"Exploding head was very enjoyable and easily viewable to watch through its medium golden color . Seems to have an aroma and flavor that is what a pilsner beer sould be. The quality of ingrediants and craftsmanship is easily noticable with this one. Just one outstanding beer."
"Just a touch of sweetness up front, quickly gives way to an over the top hop laden finish. Dry, with hints of lemon grass. Spicy, floral, and bitter all at the same time. Just enough of the malt sticks around to keep it from crashing in on itself. Very clean flavor, crisp, and quite refreshing."
"Poured a cloudy pale golden/straw yellow color, with a nice sized foamy white head capping the beer. A mild but very pleasant aroma is present, consisting of hops and a bit of spiciness (the slight scent of apples may also be present). Nice taste of hops, spice, and a bit of fruitiness. Feels very smooth and light in the mouth. This beer has a very nice crispness to its finish, and is probably very enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"A very nice pilsener. Even as I poured, I could smell the hops drifting up from the slightly clouded golden yellow brew which cascaded nicely and rose to a thick creamy off-white foam. Nor did the taste disappoint: lots of hops balanced with a light, but noticeably sweet maltiness and a touch of rose hips. Good staying power too--this taste. Highly recommended for a warm late spring evening refresher, especially when you plan to have a couple."
"I had this pils in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tall pilsener glass. It pours a slightly hazy golden color with the largest head I've ever seen. No matter how slowly you pour this one, the foam is unstoppable. It took me about 10 minutes to pour it. Seriously, this is harder to pour than a Duvel. There is lots and lots of thick lacing left on the glass. The smell is hoppy and grassy, reminds me of springtime lawn mowing. The taste has the same grassy effect, with a little clove or ginger spice. There is a little bit of hops on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is just a tad bit oily. The drinkability is awesome, and I could drink many more of these."
"Wow, impressive head: thickly sticky, prevalent and lingering all the way through. My first bottle I poured recklessly into my glass at my own peril (well, actually handed this one off to my bud who was none the wiser!). My pour took me longer and I let the beer sit a minute or two. When I took hold of my glass once again, the beer looked fantastic  as if it were poured over on the continent (where a genuine pils pour takes longer than a Guinness), with no-quit effervescence. Aroma also matched its profile  sweet pils character, slight grassy but hoppy nose. Taste was great to boot: hop bitterness to match its thin-pils character/mouthfeel. Not a really dry lager, but complex. Prima! Think right now its the best home-grown pils Ive had yet."
"Originally sampled on 19 January 2002. I'm not a big fan of pilseners; HOWEVER, Victory's Prima Pils is well worth seeking out. I even went to a pilsener tasting a couple of months ago and Prima Pils put the rest to shame. It has a clear straw color w/ a nice hoppy taste on the palate. It's very nice to drink"
"With a developed palate, you can tell this is a classic pils. A classic."
"Prima! An exclamation of joy. (Quote from the bottle). Shiny gold body with a nice 1"" foamy head and trails of clingy lace. Great floral hop aroma and taste. Lightly sweet malt with caramel notes. Fairly high in grapefruity and lightly metallic bitterness. Lightly herbal. Its an IPP! (India Pale Pils) Well done!"
"Poured a nice yellow/straw with a medium but nice retained head,pretty highly carbonated.Smell was nice and malty with some sweetness.Taste starts malty and somewhat irony but has a lingering dryness to it,somewhat complex for the style.One of the best if not the best pilsners I have had real nice and highly drinkable."
"Victory, nuff said."
"Malty crisp hop distinctive pils nose. Thick sticky white head that is gravity defying.. rocky. straw yellow color with a slight lace (fine). Complex beer taste wise but all light delicate flavors on the tongue. Almost hypnoticly drinkable. Smooth light mouth. Malty crisp (Hop) flavor. There is a sharp bitterish hop dagger left on the tongue in the finish. A great beer with food (esp italian, mexican etc). This is a master representation of a pils. A wonderful session beer.. a perfect beer to have on tap for a superbowl party... I believeit is the best pils I have ever had! I bet you can't drink just one."
"Nice golden hue. A bit cloudy. Fluffy head could form more easily, nice staying power. Aroma is pleasantly grainy, lemon. Hops add floral, slighty spicy smell. The flavor is more of the clean crisp dry malt. Hops come through on short dry, bitter finish. While Tupper's Hop Pocket Pils suffers from an overattention to the hops, this is nicely balanced and very pleasing."
"Brisk tasting, slightly bitter but mellow overall, just a bit chewy. This is a remarkable beer. How nice to find out about it just as May is ready to appear in hot Virginia. A great hot weather beer, full of character, but not overwhelming. Wonderful."
"Hazy straw color, with a thick, mountainous head. The aroma is fruity, citric, with a sour apple smell. The flavor is fruity, green apple flavors that flow to a nice bitter finish. It is light-medium in body, easy drinking; a definite winner in my books."
"Prosit!"
"Pours a dark golden color with a super-massive frothy white head that towers out of the glass and dissipates (very slowly) in chunks leaving a thick and rocky lace that sticks all over the glass. Truly a thing of beauty. Nose is floral hops, bitter hop oils, and fresh cut grass. Medium in body with a strong amount of fine carbonation. Taste starts off with sweet malts followed by some fresh grassy flavors and bitter hop oils and resins that leave a very crisp and refreshing finish. This is the finest pilsner Ive ever had the pleasure to drink. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!"
"Pours a straw yellow straw amber with a big white head. Malts are bready to some extent. Hops help this brew quite a bit. A hunk of bitter helps out a pilsner out. Malts balance the smalllish hops quite well. I'm not big on lagers, but this is one of the better lagers I've had. Ya can't touch this! Break it down. Stop, Hammer time!"
"Tasted: 03/12/03"
"Pours slightly cloudy and golden in color. Has a monsterous and explosive head that slowly descends leaving nice lace behind. Aroma is Hoppy, floral, maybe slightly sour. Flavor started off a bit sour (lemon), middle had some nice hops and spice to it, end was very dry, slightly bitter."
"Im not sure exactly what to think of this oneI like it, but theres just something that I dont like about it. It pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge rocky head that seems to never die down. It leaves a thick, sticky lace all over the glass. There is high amount carbonation that seems force the aromas right up your nose. Aromas are filled with sweet hoppy goodness, spices, and citrus peel. The taste packs a big punch of citrus-like hops. I think this might be a little to bitter for my taste. Its a good beer, but I dont think its my style."
"prima thanks to frank4sail for the sample!"
"Well a very hoppy pilsener. If you like em hoppy this is the one for you, though the malts do come out in the beginning. It is a good pils and one to be tried on a hot summer day or just to have a few or if you enjoy that hoppy taste. Good with most food and highly drinkable since it is not a high ABV."
"This was a little more then average pilsner due to its bigger bite and flavor. Color was a cloudy yellow, no head, just some light fizzy bubbles on the top. Smell was a bit bitter from a fresh hop and some sweet maltyness. You could tell it was gonna have some bite just from the smell. Which it had, some favorable hop bite and bitterness, not bad, could've been smoother for a pilsner. I liked it more as it went along. Its a pretty decent pilsner and quite drinkable. The bite is right, but a little much for a pilsner in my book."
"This is one pilsner that is enjoyable to drink. It has a nice fruit hoppiness to it that goes nice over the usual barley flavor for this style. This beer does a nice job of staying interesting while still delivering what you would expect from a pilsner. Refreshing, light, and easy to drink. This beer adds taste, the missing link in a pilsner."
"Slightly cloudy...I thought pilseners should be clear? Aroma is very much of spicy hops and a little bit of malt sweetness. The flavor is very very hoppy...a spicy kind of hoppy. It's odd, because I bought this sixer a few weeks ago, and my first try of it was absolutely horrible. Just straight up completely and utterly stomach turning bitter. So I was pissed that I bought a bad batch and let the rest sit in the crisper. And I try one tonite, and it tastes tolerable. It's not great, still very bitter, but now it tastes like I thought it should. Who knows, my palate might have been retarded the last time. I find this beer pretty enjoyable now. A little too much bitterness for my liking though."
"Poured a straw yellow, cloudy with virtually no head. This was a pretty average pour, but lurking inside was a huge brew. It smelled very bitter with lots of citrus in the nose. The taste was bold, hoppy and bitter with a slight malt taste. There were some nice mellow notes of pear and mellon that came to the front as it warmed. This is another great brewe from Victory."
"Victory is amazing, because they don't give in to the masses, and they brew the types of beers that they like to brew. This one pours a slightly hazy gold with a vibrant white head that left a full even lace all the way down the glass. The aroma presents a very quaffable bouquet of aromatic saaz hops, not much sweetness just all hops baby. Victory pulled an Emeril on this one, and kicked it up another notch. The European hops give it that classic lager crispness. The taste has a more balanced malt/hop ratio than the aroma. Slightly citrus edge to it, the bitterness leaves a trail of hop resin as it flows down the gullet. The mouthfeel is standard for a well done pilsner, very unique overall finish from this light to medium bodied beer. I could drink this regularly, very palatable and easy to drink. I can't see how somebody couldn't love this beer, but that's just my opinion."
"Golden straw in color with a fine white head that melted away leaving a very sticky lace on the glass and on the liquid. Beautiful, and dare I say it, nearly perfect pale malt and hop aroma. Yum. Malty, spicy, tea-like sweet fruit what is there NOT to like about this beer. Soft bubbles, but not under carbonated. This was a pilsner like Ive never had before."
"This beer was poured, drank and loved at the brewery itself. It came to me a bright beautiful golden yellow color. Very clear so that one could watch the bubbles dance in the glass. A soft, creamy white head sat on top of my glass calling me to nose and taste it. So I did. The aromas that tickled my nose were fresh, sweet, spicy and hoppy. The different hop smells from fresh grass to citrus to flowers to spices came right at my nose. There were some sweet malt tones as well but the hops were the primary smells. And the taste, WOW, the taste was absolutely great. Hops took the front again, grass, lemons, cloves, hay, flowers and some spices all covered my tongue, again, there was a definite sweet malt presence as well to try to balance the hops, and does so very well. But one cannot deny that this beer was made for hops. Very bold and aggressive from the moment it touches your lips to the middle as it rushes over your tongue to the very dry finish. When I say dry, I mean dry. I swear I could actually feel every drop of moisture get sucked off of my tongue. It was like a desert in there, a bold flavorful desert that I would not mind being stranded in. Great example of this style. Loved it and was glad rotsaruch told me to try it."
"It was a nice golden color and had a really nice whit pillowy head that stayed for a while and rendered a really impressive lace all the way down the glass. It's flavors were hop dominated and very refreshing. Exactly what I expected as the american micro version of a pilsner. It had very good body and a grapefruit tart hop finish. More hoppy than most pils you will come across but good none the less."
"This beer reminds me of some of the European pilsners I've tried, but without the skunky aroma or taste. Another winner from Victory."
"My first Victory product! Pours a slightly hazy gold with a unbelievable thick and dense head that hangs in there for a good, long time. Fades to about a quarter inch fed by the carbonation. Floral and citrus hop aroma is foremost. Taste is also very hoppy for a pilsener, but extremely welcome. Good mouthfeel for the style and nicely carbonated--Left a mother of a lace down the whole glass too. Thanks to aaronh for this fine beer and the other Victory's to follow."
"Cheers."
"Yellow-gold color with a generous 1/2 inch head of crystal-like white foam. Delicate and attractive web laces. Lemony aroma, some Saaz characteristics with a far off malt sense of shortbread. Wow, nicely hoppy flavor, clover, flowers, and a citrusy sense. Malt takes a back seat and is somewhat biscuit-like overall. A very nice dry finish. I know this is an over the top beer for style, but jeez, this is a great brew for my tastes -- memorable and head and shoulders over so many others."
"Flavor? Hoppy, obviously. Very crisp and dry, this beer was made for tantalizing the taste buds. Hiding in the background is the malt character, but it was masked by the hops to the point that I really couldn't discern what I was tasting. Mouthfeel is excellent, as is the drinkability. It finished clean and dry, with the hoppy character lingernig."
"If the Big Business Beers have ruined your impression of what is touted as one of the great beer styles then this beer will make everything alright again."
"Pours a very clear and very pale yellow with numerous bubbles racing to the top to reach the pure white 2 finger head that awaits them. The aromas of floral hops and a light earthy scent make the taste buds antsy. Wow! First off, you taste the floral hops again along with nice lightly sweet mild earthy malt. A very crisp and clean light bodied brew that finishes with a dry hop. This creates a higher drinkability in this brew due to the dryness making you want more as well as a very nice flavor. Nicely done! Thanks again to Rotsaruch for sending this brew! Cheers!"
"That being said, I really, really like this beer. Prima Pils is a very traditional pilsner in every way (yellow filtered body, big white head, and dry, dry, dry) until it gets to the very final taste where it gets ""wet"" and flowerly, if that makes sense."
"if you have a taste for hops that is."
"The archetypal pilsner color, a crystalline gold color, the head dazzling white, modest in size, creamy in its texture, the left over lace a delicate glass covering sheet. Lemon Lime fresh and crisp is the nose, dominated by the malts, quite a pleasure to sniff. Malt start, somewhat sweet, skinny at the top, finish delightful in its hop spicy crispness, spitefully acidic, dry and lingering aftertaste and a true joy to quaff."
"Drinkability: Outstanding. This beer is far from being one of my favorite styles, but this one is incredible. I could drink these all night on my deck on a hot summer night."
"Crystal clear, light gold in color, with heavy carbonation and a thin, foamy head. Husky malt aroma with floral hoppy notes. The hops really come through in the taste, though. This is the first beer I've had where I've really understood the ""fresh grass"" description of hop aroma. The Saaz hops used here have a very huge herbal, flowery taste to them. The German pilsner malt is also quite heavy, making this beer fairly full-bodied and chewy, especially for the style. Finishes dry, and leaves you with an aftertaste where the hops finally start to show their bitter/spicy side -- a very nice compliment to the lingering sweetness of the malt. A very aggressive and pleasant interpretation of a distinctively *European* Pilsner. It would be very easy to drink a lot of these in a row. Thanks to Nerofiddled for the trade"
" this pilsner. Are the fine folks of Downington, PA aware that among their modest ranks walk these brewing gods disguised as mortals?"
"Overall quite a drinkable beer, tastes like a European pils, with an American IPA hoppiness."
"Perhaps I was a bit overzealous to taste this one...my first attempt to drink and review ended with my underestimating the Prima's carbonation. Despite my attempts at a nice pour, half of the bottle shot from the glass and ended up in my lap. My second attempt at pouring was much more successful. It yielded a cloudy, hazy appearance with a light golden color. An excellent head formed (1/2-inch or so), with very nice retention. A luxuriant hop aroma was apparent, as well as a faint maltiness. The pronounced hop bitterness attacked my tongue first, followed by a nice malt foundation. I was really pleased by the taste and excellent overall pilsener characteristics. The Pils has a very full and somewhat creamy mouthfeel, and the fizziness seemed to magnify in my mouth. This filling carbonation made me want to wait a little while longer between beers, but the Pils remains a very drinkable, enjoyable lager."
"This is my kind of pills, golden color , nice foamy white head, leaves a lace in my glass, hoppy aroma for a pils, balanced flavors in this nectar , it has a very tasty hop bite and finishes dry."
"I poured this into a nice pilsner glass and it looked great. Straw yellow and clear with a nice rocky white heat on top. It has a very clean smell- a little hoppy. But this beer is all about the taste. Crisp and flavorful, I kept thinking I was drinking a German or Czech. beer. Wonderful bitterness at first, but mellows nicely. Overall a supreme drinking beer."
"Wow. I guess that I didn't have high expectations, but this is an extraordinarily good beer. Golden-straw colored with a puffy white head...the aroma is slightly herbal and resinous. The taste is incredible. I think it's the hoppiness that did it for me....a big hop bitterness and a dry finish seem to come out of nowhere. This isn't my style, but the beer is fantastic."
"An almost clear golden color with a white, creamy head that holds up fairly well. The hops aroma is very noticable, but not overwhelming with a faint spicy character. It has distinctive refreshing and crisp taste. The hop flavor is plentiful and pleasing with a malty presense in the background. The finish is big and hoppy, satisfying beyond belief on the hottest summer day. An impressive German-style pilsner."
"Perfect with some spicy homemade sausage at Redbones. If you like your pils with more than enough hops this is the one."
"Paired nicely with homemade sausages, catfish fingers and greens."
"Very strong hops aroma with a hint of pine as I was pouring the beer.  Very interesting.  This is a pal golden beer that pours with a very nice head that lasts well and leaves a nice lace.  The aroma is spicy hops, with a hint of something that I can only call a pine-like smell for lack of better terminology.  The mouthfeel is very full bodied and silky.  It has a nice hops kick in the aftertaste, but the malt is very present in the mouth.  This may be my favorite lager(Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is close).  A little aggressive on the hops for the style perhaps, but it works very well.   Might not a good ""crossover' beer for macro friends, but a fine beer indeed.   After a few drinks, this one started to disappear quickly.  And I like to savor my beers!  Glad I have six of them.  I've yet to be disappointed in Victory."
"A friend who works at West Virginia Brewery recommended that I really check out everything Victory has to offer about six months ago when i started getting into beer, real beer that is.  I finally bought some Prima Pils and am glad I waited so long to get it; it allowed me to learn some properties to look for in a beer.  The color is a very slightly cloudish light light golden yellow and the lace it leaves on my pint glass is heavy.  Head was light to non exsistant and first impression of taste of pretty bitter but bitter in the way a grapefruit is-having some sweetness properties deep down in its flavor.  There is a hopiness taste also to it, but of far less stregnth than the bitterness or the hidden sweetness.  The carbonation is light/medium and the lack of weight of a pilsner leaves a good mouthfeel.  Only detraction from this beer is that it's too bitter to drink a bunch of, but in respect to one of the nations foremost microbrewers you probably shouldnt do that anyways. (not to mention your wallet)"
"A hopheads pils. This beer will hook you and not let go. Very suprising how dry and hoppy. Definitely will change the way you look at a pils. I'm not sure if this beer is true to its form (everything is but quite hoppy), but who cares its great. Victory has an ongoing series of single hop pils, all great but different."
"This is definitely not a beer for the uninitiated. The dryness of the hops is very intense but blends beautifully with the whole refreshing, grassy, floral thing rather than just coming off as an astringent afternote. I love this beer and I think it is one of the supreme brewing accomplishments in this country."
"The color was a pale yellow with very little foam and a medium amount of lace of the side of the glass. The smell or malts and hops have a pleasant aroma. The taste of malts and hops were a sort on the bitter side. Flavor wise, it was lacking the flavor I was expecting from a Victory Ale. Just a tad to bitter for my taste!"
"I was told not to try this beer, as two of my fellow beer lovers hated it. So for this reason alone I had to try it. The smell upon cracking open the bottle was quite harsh...overpowering actually. I thought the taste would be similar but the bitterness I expected was not there. Extremely hoppy with a spicy bite both initially and in the aftertaste, but this is quite tasty. Very different from any other Pils I have tasted, and well worth it for its unique qualities."
"Prima Pils: from Victory, strong aroma of hops assaults the nose as soon as it hits the glass.  Huge head, in fact I think we might have a winner in the on-going quest from height above the rim: two full inches!  The beer itself is extremely hoppy, with pine flavors after the initial bite. Light in body, with a nice refreshing clean finish.  Very nice."
"Slightly hazy, bright golden color with a soft, creamy head that holds up fairly well. The aroma is intensely hoppy - bright and fresh - with a grassy and somewhat spicy character. A crisp carbonation and medium body join to create a full mouthfeel. The flavor is bold: Generously malty, but then it needs to be, to support the mouth-watering and solid hop flavor. Quite aggressive. The finish is big and hoppy, leaving a resiny dryness. A bold German-style pilsner, not so much seductive as it is dominating."
"This one pours a golden color with a solid head and some really nice lace. The smell is somewhat grassy. This tastes great. Big hop flavor for the style, which as a hop head, I love. Prima Pils is certainly an easy drinking beer, but probably not for the faint of heart. It's easily the best pilsner I've ever sampled and is another winner from Victory. As one who generally doesn't enjoy this style, I'm impressed."
"Okay, this beer poured a dark yellow color and formed a white bubbley head that left some nice lace.  The aroma, well, let's just say the hops exploded in my olfactory area.  There was also some grassy, earthy elements.  The flavor, once again, was most definately hops.  Also present was malt and citrus.  The finish was fairly dry.  One of the best pils I have had, but I admit to not being a big fan of the style."
"Pleasing pale yellow with sticky head, wonderful hoppy scent. The malts are so mild, they are hardly even there. Just a faint wisp at the bottom of the flavor. Hops are the crux of this beer; incredibly floral with hints of grass, ending with a resoundingly bitter finish. Hopheads should be in paradise, and this is indeed a tasty, appetizing beer... but to my tastes it's a bit too much with the hops, ends up being very American (in the distinctive Cascade/Sierra piney hop way), and the bitterness just borders on the abrasive. Not quite balanced. I would kick up the malt a notch and make the hops less floral and more towards grass/dried hay. The water is a bit hard too, I wonder if they could make it a little creamier. For a truly exceptional American pilsner, my vote's with Brooklyn."
"Pours a brilliant gold-straw with a foamy white head that really stuck to the glass. Very aromatic, you can smell the floral hops in the nose. The balance between the malt and the hops is incredible...the finish is bitter but not in an IPA sort of way. A great summertime beer and truly outstanding example of the style"
"The thick ivory - white head tops a hazy straw - hued brew.  Smooth bready grain aroma w/ a slightly spicy Saaz hop nose.  Assertive bitterness upfront followed by mellow toasty malt sweetness.  Spicy & lightly grassy Saaz hop flavor.  Finishes w/ bready notes ending abruptly and a lingering, clean hop bitterness.  Prima Pils is a tasty pilsner that is refreshingly bitter... probably the most bitter Pilsner I've tasted."
"Yellow gold body. Frothy, but disipating head, very good lacing. Subtle carbonation. Hay/grass nose, floral nor citric. Taste has hops way out front, but with enough malt to hold it together. Still some proper balance despite hop lead. Malt presence is more subtle, more noticeable with each sip. Probably my favorite pils. Unlike many pils, wouldn't give this to a beer novice (I'd use their All Malt Lager instead). Another gem from Bill and Ron."
"252"
"a little spicy and hoppy for me. it was not a bad beer, but i can't say i will buy it again. much like the hop devil, it was a bit much on the sharp side."
"Perfectly golden straw color with a nice fizzy fluffy topped white head. Noticable hop bubbles burst through the head in the Hop Devil fashion. Slight citrus, lemon, hops crisp aroama. Very balanced taste, super crisp hops dominate the start, then a very balanced middle.Unlike any other alleged Pilsener I have had.  Finishes crisp and strong, with a lingering hop/lemon combination on your taste buds. Unbelievable pilsner, I only have memories of Sam Adams Golden Pilsner about 5 years ago, but this is an outstanding beer. I had alone, but would pair perfectly with a spicy bbq, or anyother summertime activity. Another Victory beer that lives up to the hype...."
"Pours a sparkling golden yellow / straw color. Foamy head is huge at first but dies rather quick. On the nose is slightly zesty, bit of citrus / lemon zest,  and saaz hops.  All of the same on the palate!  Very good and very unique, very citrusy for a pilsnerbut I really like itvery impressive!"
"Prima takes Pilsener to a whole new level. It's a nice golden color with a beatiful white, pillowy head. The smell of hops is abundant but it blends nicely with the subtle malt smell. The same is true of the flavor: despite being more hoppy than most Pilseners, the flavor is well-balanced. Victory can do no wrong."
"Golden yellow sunshine. It's hard to compare this to other Pilseners because this is so unique. Straw colored, with a billowy white head that disspiates to a lacy film. Smells zesty, lemony, herbal, floral. Saaz! Taste is unlike any pils I've ever tasted; there are so many dimensions to the flavors, yet there is incredible balance as well. Initial taste is of lemon zest and grass, then a long, lingering floral/herbal earthiness, followed by a smooth, sweet finish. On any level, this beer is hard to beat."
"Last summer, my brother ZAP and I did a blind taste test of 13 pilseners and I rated this Number One.  (It came in second place after combining both of our ratings.)"
"Thick pure white head two fingers deep.  Pale gold color.  Very fresh hop aroma.  Earthy, zingy hop flavor.  Not your daddy's pilsner, but a true to style German pils.  Very unusual offering for an American micro and a great step towards reinvigorating this molested style."
"Pours a Clear pale straw color with a thick, rocky white head.  The smell is all hops with a strong, spicy Saaz presence.  The spicy hop character jumps onto my tongue and dances around.  Good, true medium body to this brew with a nice malt backbone that shows itself in the end of the taste.  Crisp and dry and very drinkable.  WOW.  This is admittedly one of my least favorite styles.  That being said, this is by far the best Pilsner I have ever had.  I will be seeking it out again and again."
"Not my favorite style but really good nonetheless.  The nice golden yellow color comes to a decent head that fades rather quickly, but is to be expected from a Pilsner.  Has a somewhat sharp malt aroma that is not displeasing.  Amazingly bitter for a Pilsner and is probably what makes me like it so much.  All around it's pretty balanced with a solid malt body.  Not very complex in the full scope of beer, but very complex when compared to others of its style.  I liked it's refreshing taste and drinkability.  Another beer that I would recommend."
"At first this comes off as very hoppy especially for a pilsner but it mellows in the mug and finish is not bad."
"I doubt any brewer, anywhere, can do much better than this. Hazy and golden, this creamy textured, smooth as silk brew is among the best. Highly hopped, though this formula exhibits minimal bitterness, leaving the aroma and flavorful, leafy hop character to prevail. Cheers to Victory Brewing. Prima indeed!"
"Deserves all the accolades it gets.  They should call it an Imperial Pilsner, big in all departments.  Don't expect a Beck's kind of beer when you try this one."
"This is a wonderful beer, this is not a session beer.  Have about once a week to keep the wonder of the shock when the hops kick in.  A treasure!!"
