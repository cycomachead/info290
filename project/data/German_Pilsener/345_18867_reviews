"When Victory brews another pilsner it is automatically going to be judged against the excellent Prima Pils. I think it may be even better than Prima, lighter on the hops and a little more body.  Highly enjoyable.  If Victory bottled this, I would buy it in a heartbeat."

"The nose is very clean, simple, lots of dry earthy hops, a little grass, cracker, with good herbal spice notes.  I don't get any yeast character on the nose.  The flavor is classic pils, dry earthy hops up front, well balanced, a little grass, slight dough, spice.  I get a little corn and grain.  Just a bit of lemon/citrus zest on the finish. This is super clean, refreshing.  Really nice."

"06/27/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. A touch bitter for my un-hoppy tastes. Not too much so, but doesn't encourage long term session"

"Enjoyed at pub as well as growler right now - very beautiful golden color, virtually no haze, with medium to full head that is white in color. At least some residual head remains over time. Aromas of bread, grain, and light grass are noted. On the palate this one comes across somewhat dry with a mineral component that reminds me a little of Dortmunder beers. Nice dry bready flavors are noted as well. Good body to enjoy as a filling beer on its own, but yet light enough for exceptional drinkability and pairing with foods. Wish this one was bottled."

"O: Victory really has this style down - between this brew and Prima Pils they dominate the category, especially with the poor shape most imports are in."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, floral, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grassy and floral hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice balance of malt and hops all around."

"Standard lightstraw gold body with lace and a bready, pils aroma and the hops come out to play which I have noticed alot of these new Victory brews are getting hopped up. Crisp, light bodied, easy to drink, there was just a sweetness that is particularly noticeable and slightly askew from other pilsners. Not a complaint, just stating my opinion on the matter. Enjoyable, sessionable, and I would recommend this beer to any pils fan or simply a fan of a good lager."

"Overall: Very nice subtle pils straight from the source. Not overly hoppy nor too sweet, this beer strikes a near perfect balance."
""
""
""
""
"More spice and noble character throughout and generally a tasty pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dry with a good presence of grassy noble hop character, lightly bready with some crackery malt depth as well. Light feel with crisp carbonation, this is a nice sessionable pilsner. Maybe not in my personal top three, but it's very well made and would be a great beer to have around on tap all year round."
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a solid head that lingers well. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of pilsner hops - this version more floral. Taste is consistent with the smell - floral but with a bit of piney background. Compared to the Prima option at Victory this has a little less ""pop"" but still good."
""
""
"Bright, slightly hazed yellow under a thick, pure-white head that settles to a permanent cap and leaves some attractive chunks of foam behind on the glass. Aromas of fresh flowers, peppery hops, dough, and fresh cracker malt. Flowery fresh, leafy hop flavor, biscuity pils malt finish, a bit of honey, and a lingering bitterness. Snappy and super refreshing. I had to try pretty hard to slow down and not just chug the whole thing down at once. Excellent!"
"A true winner for victory here maybe one of the best pils I've had."
""
"It tastes like a very authentic pilsner, the Hallertau present more in bitterness than taste (to my chagrin). Still, very flavorful for the style and easily crushed. Light bodied and so forth, this is an easy choice if you see it on tap."
""
"This is a pretty hoppy pilsner. I was quite impressed. It has balance and drinkability as well as a complexity that I find lacking in many pilsners. Overall, this was a deliciously hoppy, smooth, easy to drink pilsner that I will definitely have again the next time I find it."
"O: I personally thought this was excellent. Victory really rises to the occasion sometimes."
""
""
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, crisp and smooth on the tongue. Victory does some really solid lagers - this is another memorable example I'd revisit."
"D - Not bad, but I think I still prefer prima pils to this one."
"Overall: a very hoppy pilsner for sure. This one is certainly different and stands out from others. This one definitely grows on you as you drink it."
""
""
""
"Overly hoppy, which in my opinion takes it out of the pils category. But since I'm a hop head, I really like this beer. The body is appropriate for the style. Low malt flavor. The aftertaste dies out fairly quickly considering the punch of the bitterness in the mouth."
""
"Medium -light body; medium carbonation. Crisp, refreshing, and delicious. An truly outstanding pils."
"O: Very enjoyable, quite easy to drink, and sessionable. This is a great flavored pils that I could drink all day long. Goes well with lots of different food styles and is quite enjoyable as a summer beer."

"Imperial pint served up at Piper's Pub, this is my favorite beer pours a pale slight chill haze with a brilliant golden body and thicket of white head for days, fine lacing in speckled patterns left behind. Aroma has herbal earthy mild citrus lemon peel notes all from fressh green whole leaf hops, this pale biscuit malt profile and the assertive hops will make you appreciate real beer. Flavor is bitingly bitter for a beer this light in color with fresh hops excellent on draft, biscuit malts and crackers sweetness with a kiss of herbal, lemon, grassy hop notes. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with slick hop oils standing out with sturdy flowing carbonation that carries this beer across my palate so well. Overall world class pils found in a pub in the Burgh, thank God for PA breweries who know how to brew pils like Troeg's, Stoudts, and Victory."
"This is an exceptionally crisp offering that is light and very enjoyable. I could drink a bunch of this all day long. Very solid grain to hop contrast. This brew time and time again proves to be my favorite offering from Victory. The fact that they switch it up with different hops from time to time is an added bonus."

"Braumeister Pils pours a very nice cloudy yellow with a nice white head. The nose has hints of toasted grains and nice amount of hops. There is some sweetness, typical for the style. A very nice pils with a good carbonation and a dry crisp finish. Perfect of the style."

"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a tight white head. The nose is toasted bread crust and raw dough mixed in as a lightly sweet honey balance with a citric hop in back. The taste is sweet grains up front, lightly toasted, very balanced with subtle nuances of honey. Citric hops accompany the light bitterness in the finish. Light body with a playful feel of carbonation and a dry crisp finish. Very good stuff!"
""

"This beer pours with a nice white head which dissipates to a film of foam fairly quickly. It is just a bit darker than yellow and a bit hazy as well. Aroma is a bit fruity. Almost citrus and grapefruit. Flavor is similar with a nice clean bitterness and a mild yeastiness. Not much of a malt profile at all. Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing with a good level of carbonation. Very nice pils. Another great lager from victory."

"O: Great Pilsner, Victory does not miss. Clean and smooth great American style German Pils!"
"Light and well carbonated, and maybe just a touch too much so, Braumeister pils is another standout pilsner from Victory Brewing Company. This just further solidifies them as the best pils brewer in the country, and ranks them high worldwide, I would say."
"Overall, another knockout by Victory. I wish they would bottle this now."
"Damned good, and I mean damned good Pilsner. Absolutely loaded with flavor, great aroma too. Really stoked to get a chance to try this!"
"Overall different, distinct if a little odd, but I do very much enjoy it."
"Had at tasting last night, so this will be from my notes I did on paper that had someone's number on it. Tastes are lemony hops, some grass, chives, German hops, clean and crisp maltiness, lager yeast, age, linen. Smells like a typical American Pilsner with some age to it and some biscuitiness here and there."
"Overall - a great pilsner. I think I'd usually prefer this to Prima Pils because there is more balance between the malt and the hops, unless I was in the mood for something hoppy."
"Basic,simple,and solid."
"Had it again about two months later and it seems to have more of a balance. the hops were backed with a delicate meatiness. the grain hint of toasty vienna malt but with no sweet overtaste. dry as a whistle. i would really love to have this one in a bottle so the flavors integrate a bit in storage. not long storage because i can't distinguish if this is the same batch or a new one."
"Overall pretty good, decent hops and not too bitter, nice malts, toasty, nice lager flavors, dry clean and crisp finish, nice summer drink."
"O: Another great pils made by Victory. These Braumeister Pils' are just awesome. Just such a drinkable beer that wont' kick your ass alcohol wise. As I said, this one is much sweeter and more balanced than the Prima and much softer. Still a fantastic beer that I am lucky enough to have a keg of to enjoy through this Spring."
"O: It is fantasticly flavorful, light, and quaffable."
"D: I enjoy prima pils, this is another great offering I am loving this one."
"Great beer i could drink it all day"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a slightly hazy straw yellow with a nice off white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves just a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild pale malts alongside crisp Earthy hops. The taste is a smooth balance of sweet biscuity malts and smooth Earthy hops. The beer is quite light, smooth and very crisp. This is a very enjoyable pilsner, one I would certainly have again."
"Braumeister Pils is a really great German-style Pilsener from Victory. It has the perfect woody and spicy noble hop aroma and flavor that evokes in me the sensory memory of walking in a beech forest in late fall after an early morning shower. It has a very green, grounded hop character that is invigorating. I would love to try this and Prima Pils back-to-back to compare, I haven't had that beer in months. Braumeister is very clean, dry and has a nice malty taste."
"Pours straw yellow with a slight haze, a two-finger white head that dissipates quickly but leaves lots of lacing. The smell is cut grass and clover, maybe some bitter marigold, crisp well water, sourdough bread. The taste is sourdough starter, wood sorrel, bright minerals from what has to be a great water source, and an earthy, bitter finish. It's a little more viscous than you'd expect, but the high carbonation balances that out pretty well. It's great hot-weather beer, but would also go well on a brisk fall day -- I should've gotten 64 oz. rather than 32. One of my favorite American pilsners."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable sessionable beer at 4.8%. Wish I got a growler of this to go."
"D: This is a very good pilsner, may be even better than Prima. Hops are well at the forefront which I like."
"D: Like Prima Pils, this beer is very refreshing and easy to drink, but the use of a single variety of hops makes it taste a bit different."
"Dr. okay, not wonderful, a whole growler to go, so I can't complain too much."
"D - Tasty & plenty easy to drink. Seems very well-proportioned."
"On-tap at Liberty St. Tavern. Appeared a hazy gold with with a couple fingers of white head. Basically, this is a very American pilsner. It's big on hops, but there isn't much subtle malt or yeast character. Still, the grassy, herbal hops are delicious, plus the bitterness isn't too harsh. I'd be happy to drink several."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink had a gold, slight-amber color that was generally murky. Grassy hops help make a full aroma sense. The flavors were generally bittersweet with that grassy, bready tones. Pretty light with little carbonation but not too watery. Overall, not too bad."
"This pilsner poured a clear, golden color with a centimeter or so or nice, white foam. The smell was a beautiful, aromatic hop aroma, similar to Prima Pils. The taste was a a crisp, hoppy, pilsner, not so bready with malt but a great flavor nonetheless. Again, very similar to Prima Pils. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good, sturdy carbonation. The malt and aromatic hops lingered in the mouthfeel. This was a very nice beer, and I enjoyed more than one."
"D - A great pils in every way, very fresh like few I have tasted -top notch German style lager from Victory, does not fail to deliver at all. The lasting hop in the finish is great."
"Pretty drinkable I suppose, but not something I would have again."
"A solid beer, but not as good as I was expecting. Have to say the I prefer the harvest version of this beer, which hopefully I'll get to try again this Fall."
"NOTE: It seems like Victory put out several versions of beer referred to as Braumeister Pils... and I am making my best assumption as to which I just consumed. I resolved that the beer menu at the bar plainly stated ""Braumeister Pils", and other reviews for this beer indicated that it was unfiltered... there is a chance however, that the keg I sampled was yet another unique one-off batch..."
"Best American Pils"
"Nice use of the Hallertau varietal in this version to impart a nice dry hop bite and spice character that works very well with the crisp nature of the body. I real tasty thirst quencher. More please!"
"Straw in color fragrant noble hops and crisp taste, this is the best pilsner i have ever had. Full of flavor, but light enough to drink all night. I stopped by the brewery and wanted to keep drinkin these even though there was plenty of others to try. I was half tempted, before i left, to pick up a quarter keg to bring home. This beer is lighter in alcohol too, if my memory serves me right, 3.8%. Seriously do yourself a favor and try one of these."
"Had on tap at a beer picnic at B.Paradiso in Georgetown. Best drink of the night. It's slightly hazy, straw yellow with good lacing, and a small head that fades. Nose is yeasts and barny sweet malts with earthy moss. Taste is mild hops, sweet with hints of fruit, and peat from a bog. Exceptional example of the style. Mouthfeel is good, a bit foamy. Drinkability is very high. Nice beer from Victory!"
"Of course, the lack of flavor makes this beer quite drinkable, but I wouldn't order again."
"Draught @ Victory: Another variation of their Pilsner beer, which I believe they only serve at their pub. The beer is a lovely hazy, golden color, with a white head. There is a slightly spicy hop & wheat aroma. The taste is a lighter malty, with maybe a hint of sweetness and spiciness. Very good hop bite, but not as balanced as the Prima Pils. There are definitely Wit characteristics in this brew. Another good reason to visit the brewery."
"This was one heck of a pilsner. A perfect session beer, which I don't normally associate with lagers. This one is just sooo smooth and drinkable. This won't let you down. Although I sample this on April Fool's day, it was no joke. Straw gold with frothy head, until finally a nice lace remains. Taste approaches perfection. Nice malt taste up front with a nice hops bitterness at the end. Makes it nice and refreshing. Perfection at the end of the taste. Definitely seek this out."
"Kudos to the folks at Victory for this single-hop series. This particular version seemed true to the Pilsner style, dry and effervescent, ever-so-pleasing to drink and refreshing, with a nice bite to it. Just what to expect and demand from a good Pilsner! It's not my favorite style, but the quality overcame that for me, much like the Prima Pils does."
"Prosit!"
"Unfortunately the bitterness did linger into the next beer, so make the Braumeister your last pick of the night or your first and only. Great with vegetable dishes and lighter meats like chicken or fish. A prime example of masterful brewing making up for an impaired set of ingredients. I can't imagine what a good year of Hallertaur would bring."
