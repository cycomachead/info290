"Awesome German pilsner, try one!"
""
"O-  This blew my mind for a beer my wife found at Aldi's.  Aldi is a German company, and they had other beer pretty cheap that I'm going to have to try...that is insane!"
"i believe this beer gets underrated. Granted it is not the best example of a German pils, but because it is easy to find at my local Aldi, only 6.00 a six pack, it makes it a go to beer for me. Pours clear golden color with a slight head, some lacing. It has an initial bite and slight bitterness on the back of tongue. But, it gets smoother the more you drink. (dont they all) Also, because it is not a high alcohol content, makes a decent session beer. Paired with a grilled smithfield pork sirloin, some spaetlze or some potato gnocchi and a spinach and tomato salad very nice. Good served ice cold on a hot day. (I know some people say germans drink beer ""warm"" this is absolutely false, they just dont chill beer as cold as americans. Brits drink beer a bit warmer.) Wernesgruner is nice beer for the price."
"Surprisingly smooth and not bitter for $6"

"O: Easy to drink and fairly enjoyable though not outstanding. Pairs well with just about any food."

"Overall - An okay pils, but gets borderline adjunct flavors. Got this really cheap at Aldi so I thought I'd give this one a try. Would make better mower beer."

"Drinks easy and quenches your thirst. It is by no means anything special, pretty, or delicious, but it is good after working in the sun. Not the best, mot the worst. Your best option is probably getting it real cold and drinking it from the can with a coozy if you've got one."

"Poured into a pilsner a clear dull light to medium golden with a pretty well defined white head that left a few broken chunks of lace as it settled pretty quickly.Sweeter aromas with a mild crispness,more like a sweet cereal aroma more than anything.The sweet cereal grain notes are what you get mainly on the palate with just a light drying leafy hop note in the finish.Eh, pretty average but it goes well with food and is pretty drinkable in an average kind of way."
""
"O - a run-of-the-mill pils"
""
"This beer is amazing in its ability to be neither great, nor bad. It's middle of the road, to the extreme. Imagine German Bud Light. Except with more mild/bitter hops, maybe saaz? Better dollar for dollar than BMC. apparently abv is 4.9, but seems lower as I just finished a sixxer and am not too buzzed."
""

""

"Just tried this because it was available at Aldis on my grocery run and I had never tried it. Initially refreshing, nice and light. The aftertaste is a bit strange, almost soapy. I think the appearance was perfectly fine. Poured into a glass the head was light and foamy, not dense. Nothing to write home about but perfectly acceptable."
""
""
"For the price, much better brews can be bought from any grocery store."
""
""
""
"Overall - A good pils. But wish it was a little heavier bodied. Still one of the better ones out there."

"O/D - Not a bad version of the style. Herbal hop note was pleasant. Easy drinking. A subtle but enjoyable Pils with typical flavours that I could have a few of."
"Picked up this brew at Aldi's a great new neighborhood food store that has prices that blow the other supermarkets into the weeds, let's give it a whirl. Poppingthe top I get a nice full bottle with a malty and barley malt smell. No adjuncts here. On the pour into my SAPP I get a clear lightly golden color with a thick foamy two finger head. On the taste this brew is delightfully crisp and clean with a nice sharp hoppiness that is semi bitter right along side a sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel is thin but that is the norm for this style so no down-grade. Very refreshing and a great brew for a hot summer day. I would buy again."

"This is a really great German Pils, especially for the price (8.99$ Canadian for a 4 Can Pack). It is pretty similar to Bitburger, but I would say the difference being that Wernesgruner is more hops oriented and Bitburger is more malt oriented. I think the thing that impresses me most with this beer is how well balanced it is. Definitely a great session brew, especially in the summer time as it's very refreshing but also full of flavour."
"Overal - 3/5. Sidenote: Yes, it's far from the best pilsner, but at least where I'm from (Ontario) it's one of the best for the price (currently $2.05 for a 500ml can - not shabby at all)."
""
""
""
"O: It was slightly above average for me. I wouldn't buy it again but it was okay. Nothing stunning or me. Fairly dull in my opinion."
"Overall- Not bad but it reminds me of a typical beer from the ""big"" brewers."
""
""
"its decent. on the low end of pilsner, nothing id really look for, but ive had alot worse beer.this is a pretty basic beer , but its slightly similar to some better quality imports, which makes it slightly endearing, and its not costy at all, a good solution for a few cheap ass tallcans. if you dont mind a few odd off hints, this beer might be for you, as for me, not exactly my fave. but its better than some."

"Although it had over 7 months to expiration date, there was some metallic hint present, a little oxidized off flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Some nice flavors, nothing complicated though body holds its own."
""
""
"Can pours a light straw colour with lots of fine carbonation and a reasonable but light foamy white head. A green aroma of grass and hops. The taste starts with a bready sweetness before rapidly transitioning into a surprising hop bitterness. This dryness is a very pleasant surprise, more like a Czech-style pilsner (without the Saaz) than a typical mild & sweet Germanic style. Would definitely recommend."
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but find it pretty one-dimensional and the bitterness as the overwhelming character I find make it less than easily drinkable and a touch annoying. 3.5"
""
"I had this beer after mowing the lawn on a hot day. Pours a pale straw colour with a thin film of head. Smells primarily of grass and barley, with a bit of sour notes as well. Tastes sweet at first with the malts, and finishes with some grassy bitterness. Mouthfeel was thin and dry. It's drinkable after a hot day of mowing the lawn, but I won't be seeking this out again."
"O: Decent. How to say this nicely? Beats the heck out of US big name 'pilsners' but that is a pretty low bar so if that were my choice I'd drink this again."
""
"I poured the beer from a bottle into a glass.The head started off thick but faded with some lacing. The color was golden and very clear. The nose is mainly malt with hints of grass and a metallic note. The taste is bready from the malts and fades to a slight metallic bite. Mouthfeel is light, but with good carbonation. I like this better than the Holland 1839 lager that aldi sells. It does make an interesting comparison to American pilsners. I'ld like to try some in making beer rolls."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent but not great. Even at 6 dollars a six pack, I won't be rushing back to buy more."
""
"The Wernesgruner is a bit sharp as compared to other Germen Pils. What I mean by sharp, it has a rougher grainy edge. This beer pours a crystal clear pale straw colour, with two fingers of thin puffy, foamy white head, which yields a nice lace. It smells of grain, and muted floral hops. The taste is sharp burst of grain with bitter hops. The mouthfeel is light in body with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a tough Pils."
""
"O - An OK pilsner lacking in fruity bitterness and earthy robustness. It's unique, however something about it tastes contrived and mass produced. I will say that it is better than most sixers at the $5.99 price point."
""
""
""
"This beer is ok. I don't feel like I'll be making any special trips to Aldi to pick up a six of it however."
""
"Poured into a pint glass straw colored with a decent finger white head that dissipated a bit but retained well. The scent was light grassy with some citrus. I detected a taste of hoppiness with lemon that match well with the smell, maybe even a little pepperiness. mouthfeel was clean and crisp, no surprises or disappointments. Overall a slightly above average pilsner, not bad for the buy."
"O - A tasty pils and certainly a lot better than I was anticipating from what appears to be a mass produced tall can. Still, it reminds you of what lures you to the style."
"Not a bad beer at all, just not a world-class beer."
"Final Grade: 3.62, an acceptable B grade."
"O - This was surprisingly good a $6 for a six pack. Worked great on a warm day while grilling."
"Dr: Why did I buy this? The ABV isn't high enough for the beer to even be considered a crap beer. It's just downright not worth it. The price is especially low, but still doesn't justify the poor quality. This is one for ye lads to avoid like the fecking hiv. (Too far?)"
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Golden, crystal clear, minimal clumped and frothy head that settles into a wispy layering. Bit of spice in the nose with some faint grain husk and honey-like aroma. Unique spicy hop presence is fairly strong up front, very dry and biscuity, little to no residual sweetness from the malt. Grain and hay seem to go side by side with the spicy hop flavor. Very bitter, hoppy finish, mouth is left with a case of cottonmouth after each sip. Mouthfeel is crisp and seems a tad over carbed, dry and light bodied. Overall, it's an enjoyable pils for sure."
"O - Avoid"
"im not a huge pilsner fan but pilsner lovers would probably judge this higher and i would recommend it for them ."
"d-pretty drinkable as all macros are."
"Overall- if you want a generic crap watered down pilsner like a bud but slightly different this is your brew. i can't get over how clear this brew is. without the slightest hint of yellow it would look like water."
"D: Very easy to drink and low ABV."
"D- Very nice, I'd have another."
"D: Eh. Wouldn't buy again due to that strange aftertaste."
"Good beer that will go on my ""won't let you down"" list."
"D: Somewhat drinkable used to love this taste along with Becks and Hienie but tastes have changed not bad though just not me."
"For fans of German pilsners, this should not be missed. It has a unique character that's charming and interesting. It could be more rounded and balanced, yes, but that would be to take away some of its uniqueness. Worth seeking out."
"D: Average pilsener"
"This is a step above most pils in a can as it actually finishes fresh and crisp with a real bitterness to the beer. Pale yellow colour with a very white head. The nose is noble hops and the taste is very dry for the style. I need to have a bunch of these in the fridge this winter to counterpoint the heavy sweetish winter beers that I usually drink"
"Probably one of the best Euro pilsners for your buck (at least in Ontario, where cans of this run you around 2 bucks a pop). A solid brew, easy to drink, crisp, refreshing."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drink - One of the better euro beers out there. It is very refreshing and highly sessionable - especially during the summer months."
"Thin body, crisp and clean, with a palate-cleansing bitterness. A good german-style dry pils."
"D/O- Well if you're a fan of it, I'd suppose these would go down pretty easily. Overall, not a bad German-style Pils. Thanks again Jerdmier."
"Poured to a very white two fingered head. Brew itself was a very light yellow in color. Head hung around a long time. Had some decent lacing. Smelled very light. Almost no smell going on. Just a straw smell and very light sweetness. Had a light sweetness taste to it. Almost like apples. Again very light taste. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. Not a lot of alcohol. You could make this a session beer with no problem. Ill buy again."
"Pours a pale straw-yellow colour with very a finger of white head that takes a long time to dissipate. Small lacing around the glass. Hops come through in the smell with some bready malts. Very clean flavour, some small bitterness. Nice carbonation level. Quite a refreshing beer. I could easily put a few of these back."
"Sorry for taking a shot at American micro-brews and I'm sure many hopheads will disagree but this beer is at a level of hop usage they simply cannot comprehend, without a doubt, my all time favorite beer in the world and only 1 Euro!"
"Light bodied, crisp, refreshing, smooth, and easy to drink. Nicely carbonated. A nice example of a German Pilsener."
"Really entertaining to see a constant stream of bubbles go from the top to bottom of my glass. Can't beat the price or convenience (Aldi's are all over IL) but this is spectacularly average. (I like Noble Pils better, sometimes it is cheaper too)."
"The ALDI grocery store chain carries this beer, along with Heineken and Corona look-alikes. This was a quite pleasant German Pils, Bittburger immediately came to mind. Clean, crisp malt flavors, with a touch of sweet grain balanced by some astringency. Finish was firm with the barest lingering hops bitterness."
"D- No complaints with the exception of wishing the taste lasted longer. There are much worse flaws. I would pick it up again."
"D: Nice, balanced German Pilsener."
"Drinkability: I would like it a bit more bitter and carbonated to call it a pils but it somehow redeemed itself at the end."
"D: a passable drinker, not the best pilsner but it possesses nearly all of the traits that I expect from the style. This warrants a sample."
"The flavour is mediocre. A bit of spicy bitterness which is battling a vegetal flavour. The body is a little thin and too watery. A light unpleasant aftertaste lingers. Carbonation is lower than expected (especially for such a thick head). Drinkable, though not fantastic."
"I suppose I might drink it again? But probably not by choice."
"d- I don't know what it is, but try as I might to put this beer down, I just can't stop drinking it. I would later learn this was the beginning of a love of pure German pils. Just as I keep thinking the aftertaste is awful and I'll never have another drink, I'm washing it away with another swig. If you have an ALDI's in your area, you should give this one a try."
"drinkability - good price good flavor easy drinking"
"An ok one finger head that recedes to a half island like film of foam. The color is a clear and briwght golden hay with some light copper hues. The aroma is strong with wet, cut grassy hops. The malts give just a little milled grain nuance to the aroma. The taste is full of those grassy German hops, but the water gives a little gypsum like mineral quality to the kilned barley. The gypsm also gives a crisp and dry feel to the palate. Your standard German pilsner that easy to drink and enjoy en masse. Or while working around the house."
"Taste: It begins with a little bit of a corn sweetness that finishes slightly bitter but that leaves quickly. The aftertaste is somewhat of that rice/popcorn taste. A little odd, not bad but because of the aftertaste, not great."
"ok so I do not understand why a beer like this could have a worthy. I would drink any major marketing beer over something like this. When I bought it I was not expecting it to be good. But this is the beer that people who drink coors would turn away from. Just because it is german and has a hard to pronounce name does not deem this beer worthy. Arguably the worst beer I have ever had."
"Great beer for the price. Figured I'd try a 6-pack from the local Aldi."
"Not a bad beer, but since I am not a huge fan of hoppy beers, subtracted a little for that. Still, as far as a high hops beer goes, I liked this one, and would rate it among the better high hops beers I've had."
"Great beer. And one of the cheapest ones on sale here."
"A fair version of Pilsener - but try something else first."
"M-Highly carbonated."
"Overall, a decent representation of a German Pilsener veritable, if only a bit on the sweet side."
"If anything, this one is crisp and has a very clean feel to it. The body is light to medium and a moderate carbonation works well in this one."
"A decent German Pilsener for what it is, quenching, and definitely in the running for a session beer. Perhaps the most noticable flaw is how grainy it gets in the aftertaste as it warms, but its nothing major."
"D - Quite drinkable. No complaints. Low price is a bonus."
"Besides its appearance, there's nothing overly special about this beer, everything borders average. That's alright though, for some reason I wasn't really expecting much from this beer. Maybe from the size it came in or from the cheap price. Either way, this bad boy will be finished in no time."
"The mouthfeel is actually pretty good, and it is very drinkable. I bought this beer at Aldi and it was definitely worth the 6.99 for the six pack. I will enjoy the rest of the six pack and I might go back to this one from time to time, just because of the value."
"Congrats Aldi. If you can get some of your other German brands here, I'll be visiting more often... For now, you'll get me once a month to pick up my case (or two) of Wernesgruner!"
"This is one refreshing beer, the ultimate lawn mower pilsener (by that I mean the cost/drinkabiliy/taste ratio). If you want to invite some non-bas over for a party but want a solid German pils, go for this one, at 5.99 for a 6 pack the numbers don't lie, this is a good deal."
"Wernesgrüner (or Wernesgruener, the correct way to spell it if you aren't using the ü) was a surprisingly refreshing treat on this sunny summer afternoon. I was expecting this to be yet another bastardized macro-lager; fortunately that wasn't the case. The fact that Wernesgrüner Brauerei has been around for over 560 years has to tell you something; the fact that they still make a good quality product tells you something even more important."
"Drinkability: Very high. Although there are better pilseners out there, you'd be hard-pressed to find as thorough a beer - at its price - which is a consistent pleasing drink, especially in warm summer months! Nice coup for Aldi at scoring this beer to stock. This is most definitely my favorite ""go-to"" cheap import."
"Conclusion: I drank most of this six pack while cooking out on the first hot day of spring, pairing it with freshly made German sausages and other German fare and it was great...by itself, it's a little one-dimensional and the bitterness seems to overpower the mild flavors...while this is definitely a cut above the American Macros and many of the larger imported lagers (for the price, especially...I picked this up at Aldi's) this is still a ""swig it with cookout food"" beer rather than a sip-and-enjoy kind of brew."
"Overall, unimpressive for a pils of any origin. Almost no hops taste and with a mouthfeel that's too light. I'll pass on this watery pils in the future."
"This is an example of a German classic; German Pilsner. It is not as bitter and malty as others, but has a nice, balanced taste to it. Very smooth with only little hop aroma. Great lawnmower beer. Crisp with decent head, gold in color. Interestingly enough, the only places that sells this beer around here is Aldi."
"Good for a Bar-B-Que when loads of half-friends are coming (you know, the wifes relatives and that sort)."
"overall a good beer but too typical to be remembered."
"Drinkability: Overall not a bad beer, but not really that great either. There are definitely better pilsners out there."
"D: Good again. Low abv, taste is good and not too weak, feels good. The only thing slowing it down is the damn metallic aftertaste."
"Drinkability - lots of better options, I'm not put off by this but won't seek it out."
"Like others, I picked this up for $5.99 at Aldi's. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a perfecly clear, straw-golden color with a thick, lusterous white head that leaves nice trakcs of lacing about the glass. The smell is a combo of a neutral grain malt and slightly grassy, spicy hops. The flavor has a slight sweet, fruity flavor with a mildly skunked taste that I've come to expect from most Euro lagers. A decently balanced beer that finishes slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is light to watery and the carbonation is on the thin side. Overall, a drinkable beer. Since it is economical, it is probably worth the price and just as good or better than BMC stuff."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and, next to Bitberger about my favorite normal German pils. Lammsbrau (organic) German pilsner is the best I've had--but this is a close 3rd. And at a dollar a bottle, you can't beat it."
"This beer is a better pils than many of the American micro-brewed versions of German pilseners I have tried. Very drinkable, especially for the price."
"The mouthfeels is excellent and drinkability is tremendous. If I preferred the Pils style, this would definitely be one of my regulars."
"When you are broke like I was last month, give this one a try, it isn't Westmalle by any stretch but it sure as Hell isn't Heineken either."
" Drinkability is probably the highlight of this fine deutsch brau. 3 to 4 from a sixer is effortless, and you'll probably fight to finish a sixer if you bring this to a party. Solid session lager in all it's glory, for an affordable price. Don't get me wrong I love local micros those are my passion, but if I can get a well put together import for under a 8 bucks a six than I'm pretty much sold especially when standard Sam Adams are going for 9 a sixer right now and Sam Smith's are 9.95 a 4 pack in my area."
"Overall, it is certainly drinkable and even sessionable. But, not a beer I will seek out again."
"This is a light bodied beer with a mild carbonation to it. It's very easy to drink. This is a good anytime beer or something that you could eat with a meal. The flavor would enhance the flavors of the food without being completely overpowered by the flavor of the meal."
"While it's not legendary as the label leads you to believe.. it's not bad either and something I'd have no problems drinking again."
":)"
"Taste is light and malty, again with lagermalt character. The yeast is clean and adds only a taste which I would call bottom fermented taste. The typical sulfur is not in here. The hops whiffs that I picked up in the smell are translated poorly into the taste. The beer has hoppy taste, but is somewhat overruled by the light biscuity taste of the malt. Drinkability is good. I like this beer."
"I tried this beer on February 11, 2008 after purchasing from the local LCBO outlet. The beer pours a clear yellow-gold with a thin white head. The aroma is very grainy and not appealing at all. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. The flavour is a combination of malt and grain."
"overall actually not too bad."
"D-Easy to drink,a good session beer for the money.There are better examples of the style out there but this stuff is hard to beat at five bucks a sixpack."
"Highly drinkable and sessionable, wonderful example of the style."
"Overall impression: considering the price, this is a serious buy! There's better German beer out there, but if you're on a budget, hit this stuff at $4-5 a six rather than the cheaper American ""Pilsner"" attempts."
"D definitely better pils out there. not a fan of the cabbage but still a nice hoppy crispness. Gimme some rothaus pils!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a thin-walled tall mug, bright and crystal clear straw yellow with a full fizzy finger of foam that slowly fell to lighter lace. Aroma is skunky hops and light sweet grainy malt, just like a german pils should. Taste is well balanced between grassy hops and earthen maltiness, finishes with a light and clean aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, light to medium bodied with low to medium levels of carbonation. Drinkability is great, nicely balanced and easy to drink, tasty and refreshing example of the style."
"Clear liquid, clarity similar to apple juice but with a distinct lime green hue - seriously. One finger off-white head, some retention and lacing. Low, lazy carbonation surpizingly lasted throughout tasting. Has a bready smell, yeast, dampness, feintly floral. Dry and bitter pilsener taste,finishes quickly and a bit abrupt. Medium body with some hops and a balance, finishing more with malt in the aftertaste. Overall, not a bad tasting pilsener but with a bit too snappy a finish. I can't say I didn't enjoy this beer but I doubt I'll run off and bring some more home, nothing about it makes me want to have another right now."
"Overall: This one was purchased by one of my family members for me to try while on vacation. It is a nice refreshing brew that goes down nice and tastes pretty good. I would drink again."
"D- It's a pretty decent beer. It tasted best at its coldest on a hot day. At the price, I can see buying it again when the beer budget is being streched or feel like something lighter."
"One of 4 beers I was shocked to find at ALDI's of all places. This one is certainly the best of the bunch. A fine lager in my opinion."
"D- Easy drinking summer beer. Too bland but still pleasant. Drinkability diminished by blah mouthfeel."
"D - Easy drinking. Nothing I can spot as being wrong about this, but not exciting either."
"Wernesgruner was a light golden color with good clarity. The large white head was a little rocky and had good retention, leaving some thick lace on the side of my glass. It smelled of noble hops and was fairly malty with some earthy aromas. The taste was noble hops over a malt base with a dry bitter finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was above average. It's a decent pilsener and worth a try."
"D - Drinkable. The subtle flavours it has are not offensive and the lightness and lack of aftertaste make it easy to go through a few. Very refreshing when cold. Becomes more 'tinny' as it warms."
"Picked this up because it was cheap and looked interesting. Pours an extremely light, clear yellow. Fair amount of carbonation, comparable to a Sprite or 7up. Thick, bright white head which dissipated over a few minutes. Smell is astringent, very hoppy, with a little sweetness and alcohol. Taste is very bitter, with a hint of sweetness, overall a strong astringent flavor, with some hops as well. Mouthfeel is very watery, with some carbonation. Drinkability I suspect will vary wildly from person to person. I could certainly see this being an easy beer to pound back for some, but not for me. Overall, it's not an offensive beer, but it's not something I plan to seek out in the future."
"As mentioned before in this post, 75 cents a bottle ain't bad for this. It's not a classic, it's not an astounding fringe nutcase, but it would be an excellent fridge filler when you have the macro drinkers over and don't want to see them dump out the great ones and you don't want to have to exorcize your fridge from the macro-beer demons."
"So overall: A very good cheap summer pils, but it does not rate up there with the classics."
"Very much a lame duck when it comes to German Pilseners. It's cheap yes, but so are better beers."
"Thin beer that's easy enough to pound but not one I'll find again."
"Classic beer from Saxony, rather hoppy, with pleasant bitterness and a bit tart aftertaste. Well-pronounced malts, a small yeasty note. Pale, sometimes greenish color. Very appetizing aroma. Excellent aperitif but not a thirst-quencher - after a second pint your tongue feels too bitter. Recommended!"
"I am completely impressed by this beer. An astonishing value with a ton of character for the price."
"Can: Poured a light golden color pils with a small bubbly white head with minimal retention. Aroma of faint grassy malt is a bit deceiving. Taste is weaker then expected with some grassy/floral malt which were enjoyable but totally lack crispy hops which could have made this beer interesting. A bit deceiving since I made sure to pick up a can in order to ensure freshness which totally seem to be lacking here."
"Bottle has no date on it. Poured into a Pils glass. A very good egg shell white head sits on top of a pale straw yellow body. The head has good staying power leaving lace down the sides of the glass. A vast stream of bubbles race up to the top. Sweet malt with just a hint of floral hops in the nose. Sweet grainy malt predominately with barely a noticible hop bitterness. A very thin body that is rather bland. Almost no aftertaste and finishes very dry. If you are looking for a cheap beer this sure beats BMC and would be a good start for someone wanting to explore something different w/o going outside the lines of the big three."
"Slightly slick mouthfeel reinforces the sweetness which teeters on the edge of cloying. Drying hops make it work and give great burps. Hella better than BMC...and will continue to get my $4.49 when I need a cheap, relatively satisfying beer."
"FROTHY HEAD! That's pretty much the highlight of this one. The smell was semi-skunk, mixed with malt and hops, just like any Euro lager. I've had better Pilsners though. The taste was similar to the smell, but not so much on the skunk. It was mostly a very malty taste, with a hop finish, as well as some very faint citrus fruits. Overall a disappointment. Just chalk it up as another beer review."
"I bought this more out of curiousity than anything else, figured I would give yet another German Pils a try. Overall I would say that I was mildly impressed. Most German beers are impressive this way for the simple fact that they are simple, clean and get right to the point. This is no exception. Put simply it looks, smells and tastes good. like most Pilseners. Mouthfeel is typical and drinkability is good. This is a nice refreshing beer to be enjoyed pretty well any time."
"Date code L236 seems to tell me it was bottled in Sep05 and I got it mid-November. Not bad."
"This is an unexpectedly taster Pilsner. Ill try it again for sure."
"Good stuff."
"12 ounce bottle. $4.49 a six at Aldi. Freshness dating was in code L1855."
"Drinkability: Usually, Pils is not really my favorite style, but this one is not that bad (especially for its price - cheaper than domestic beers). For someone on a budget, it worths a try."
"I gotta admit, when I saw this on sale for 3.49 a sixer at Aldi's, I only bought it for novelty. I am surprised that it's decent, let alone good!"
"Canned sample. Light gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Fairly rich malty aroma from this one with some milder grassy hop notes. Very crisp mouthfeel, with flavor notes of light malt, clean grassy hops, and a very slight touch of citrus. Very satisfying indeed. A good example of the classic German pilsner style."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, big fluffy white head, decent lacing. Smell is sweet, kind of a grainy malt smell, honey, little bit of discernible hops. Taste is very sweet, not very pleasant, it tastes almost skunked except its in a can. Honey sweetness, almost cloying, no hops to be found. Smooth carbonation, light mouthfeel, and not pleasant."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a small sized white head. It doesn't seem to have much carbonation, little to no fizziness. The smell is of nice sweet hops. It really doesnt have that skunky bitter smell that I notice in a lot of German pilsners. The taste is very subtle at first, almost like a light beer. There is a hop bitterness midway through, and the beer finishes with bready tastes. The mouthfeel is not bad for the style of beer, and it goes down pretty well. Overall, its not a bad beer, but it seems to lack any outstanding or unique qualities."
"As a Pils hound my palate is over worked with the expected Bohemian/Czech profile pils... Im beginning to be more partial to the Northern German Pilsners...this one did not disappoint....good biscuity malt spine balanced with the marvelous blend of herbal German hop varieties one would expect in a rich Marzen...I like the mix...this is a very good, and well made, Pilsner...fresh refreshing slightly dry but with enormous taste."
"Pours a classic clear gold under a two finger white head with lovely contour, great retention and a nice network of lace down the glass. Yup, this is what a Pils should look like. The nose is very malty, smooth but lacking any hop spice to balance. The mouth is medium carbonated and slightly sticky, although light in body. Good smooth bready malt taste with a decent hop bitterness in the background. The hops are floral in nature, not at all skunky. The finish is more malt sweet than hops bitter, while the aftertaste maintains a bit of both. Nice, solid if unspectacular product."
"Its not going to be a problem splitting this six pack"
"A good German Pils this Wernesgrüner, die Pils Legende and at Aldi, check it out!"
"The beer is easy to match with food (except something really spicy). This is not a bad beer at all and I will consider keeping a six pack on hand. An enjoyable no-brainer!"
"never had it and it was $3.99 a 6er. why not? pours out a light golden, vibrant carbonation and a nice fluffy white head. smells of lightly sweet malt and grains with some nice hops, maybe a little straw? flavorwise...alot like the nose. lightly sweet, raw tasting...nice spicy hops...tingly bubbles in the mouth, crisp, maybe a touch thin but still very refreshing. i like this stuff. damn refreshing and at that price, one hell of a bargain. im hyped."
"Wernesgruner doesn't make me feel like shouting the chorus from ""Deutschland Uber Alles"" from the rooftops, but it is a drinkable pilsener that was enjoyable while it lasted. I doubt that I'll seek it out again, but then very few beers of this style are accorded that honor."
"comes out a nice straw gold color with great clarity and a small fluffy head that retains pretty well. smells of musty saaz or hallertau hops. very very earthy aroma. taste is very light with good hoppiness....very similar to czech pilsners like urquell. very little body, but the hops make this beer extremely drinkable. this is a very nice pils, imho. i could drink gallons of the stuff."
"Overall, I would like to try it on tap to see if it gets any better, but I'm not going to spend my hard earned money on any more bottles."
"Pours a pale yellow with a generous white head that laces quit well, especially for a pilsener. Aroma is primarily hops, and a bit of a sour yeast smell. Taste was hops and was pleasantly crisp on the finish, but was bit too carbonated for me. It is drinkable, but as far as pilseners go there are many other things that I would prefer."
"Note: Now in a 12 oz brown bottle. Price at Aldi just lowered to $4.49/six. A good beer at a great price.."
"Doesn't taste as big as it smells. Mild hops, mildly bitter finish that lingered for a bit. Quite light actually. Fine as a light summertime quaff I would say, easy, but not especially memorable."
"This brew pours a light golden colour but is murky, the crown is short but the lace does stick around for awhile..The body is medium/full and the taste is from mild hops to which seem to linger a short while. Slight aroma of yeast..Nothing exceptional but passable."
"Really, they should use the colour as some marketing trick because beer (pilsner anyway) should not look like this."
