"We got two of  these (in cans) and a Cuban cigar for three bucks just off the boardwalk on the Dutch side (on the French side they were more like $4 each in a fancy restaurant on Orient Beach). Good value in the can (and I think it was tastier), and the cigar wasn't at all bad either (a Monte Cristo)."

"A light lemon/mineral water taste, nicely rounded with saaz hops and an apparently endless amount of streaming bubbles make for an enjoyable pilsener. Got this pint can for $1.00. Very refreshing and sessionable."

"Nice maltier pils. Good full flavor, must be the mineral water."
""
"It's surprisingly pleasant for a pilsener !"
"Enjoy"

"This was a crisp beer with a subtle, hard to identify aftertaste. It wasn't anything special but I enjoyed it."

"The beer pours pale golden with a cotton-like cap of foam. The liquid is pale golden with air of breadiness. Very light on the palate---definitely has a ""macro"" sense about it with some cooked veggies through the center and could use a little more bitterness at the finish. All in all, though, its drinkable."

"Nice refreshing brew- not too claggy on the pallet- taste doesn't linger at the back of my throat after two 500ml bottles; whereas other beers do, forcing me to reach for a cider. Onto my third, still finding it refreshing. Good price, 95p per bottle. Might be on these for a while till I get bored.."
"Overall: a good if not unusual beer."
""
""
""
"There is not a single Dutch lager that comes even close to this golden simplicity."
""
""
""

"if you can find it i recommend it it looks fancy and isn't too expensive and its 5% so its no lite beer"

"Picked up a case of these in 8 oz cans, not having tried, hope not to be disappointed, let's give it a whirl. Popping the can top I don't get much of a smell. Reading the label it is made with barely malt and wheat so doesn't look adjunct. Pouring into my handy SAPP I get a bright yellow brew with a big bright white foamy head that tops out the remaining space in the SAPP. On the taste this brew is bitter sweet hopping with a nice maltiness in the background, well in line with what is expected from a typical Dutch brew. Very thirst quenching and tasty and will serve its purpose we'll for what it is intended, a lawn mower brew. Actually a quite good lawn mower brew."

"A fair pilsner that's a tad unbalanced with the flavors. The hop bitterness doesn't quite mesh well with the malts, coming across a bit too strong and leaving a faint metallic aftertaste. The high point is the appearance with excellent head retention and plenty of foam rings down the glass. Certainly drinkable yet just as easily forgettable."

"A decent and refreshing pilsener, better than most of its European mass produced counterparts."

"O: This isn't a bad German Pilsener from a Dutch macro brewery, especially since there are no aromas or favors of adjunct malts."
""
""
"The body is light and it has a very watery and thin feeling."
""
"I could've sworn Bavaria was in Germany... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, light wild rice, and a touch of wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grass in control, but not in an unpleasant way. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little pils, nothing incredible, a fairly tasty choice, especially for the price."
""
"Flavor of light lemony hops and neutral graininess. Smooth and drinkable with a creamy feel given the carbonation level and light sweetness combination. Does finish a bit dry and chalky in contrast. Easy yet unexciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This isn't a special beer in any way but it is certainly drinkable."
""
""

"One of the better Euro/Pilsners around, and at least its NOT brewed under licence in the UK. I never buy anything Brewed under licence!! Not too sweet nor too bitter. Value at £1.50 for a 660ml Bottle (99p if you shop about!) A good session beer and great with BBQ."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a refreshing enough German Pilsner. A bit on the sweet side to drink a lot of, though."
"Overall Impression- An easy going brew that I’ve always seen but never ordered/bought a store. Easy going and good overall for a German Pilsner."
""
"this brew gets all kinds of promotion in bosnia, especially during the film festival. it pours a budlight looking watered down yellow color with a white head that doesnt last. it smells like german malts crystal mostly, no hops to speak of. flavor is the standard german pils cheaply made. it doesnt have much of that dusty grainy character, and is more in line with the adjunct lagers in my opinion. still, with decent carbonation and a very light body, its an easy drinking beer. a lot of the beers here are starting to taste the same to me, watery malt half liters without much sex appeal. this is another one of those."
""
"The beer is pale yellow in color, just like straw. Nice white head that, however, disappear quite fast. The aroma is very faint. Some cereal grain, some wheat... nothing extraordinary. The taste is quite ordinary. Malty. Low intensity in the taste. This is a refreshing beer to drink very cold. Like Heineken. Not bad, but not great too. Average beer."
""
"Overall a pretty basic tasting Lager with a good drinkability, great lawn mowing beer..."

"Just another average pilsener, good thing that is so cheap you can buy 36 bottles for 9,99."
"Overall, the strongest component of this brew was the taste. Judging by the nose, we were expecting something much more bittering, but we got something crisp and relatively well balanced. The flavoring was within the style, but the nose took us for a loop, with a hazy, floury bomb. It just didn’t smell fresh, despite the dating and proper storage. In the end, all of the components could have been better integrated amongst each other, which would have made for a more enjoyable brew."
"This is a decent, easy drinking pilsner. It's not offensive, but it's not overly flavorful. There's just enough flavor to keep me interested. I'll probably have this again."
""
"Another average lager, go down easy, not too bad."
""
""
"Bah - a fairly typical mass-produced lager, dull and characterless. Weak aroma and flavour with some off-notes. Not particularly good; the low price is the only thing going for it. Give it a miss."
""
""
"Insubstantial, watery mouthfeel. Overly slick for some strange reason. Overall, this is quite a bad pilsner. I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone, skunk or no skunk."
""
""
"Isn't a bad beer at all but it isn't phenomenal."

"Overall, this is actually pretty good value in my opinion. I might get it again if I'm looking for a well-priced beer that isn't too bad either."
"Drinkable is the best praise I can muster, and this is definitely a poor representative of the style it has been placed in. Consider this a C if taken for what it actually is - an EPL...comparable to Beck's or Heiny, but much cheaper. And really, the price is basically all this beer has going for it - so if you drink EPLs regularly, you could probably switch over to this and save money without noticing much of a difference. Drink with something salty to munch on hand."
"Overall, this has some features of a generic pilsner, but it seems to work and not bad if you’re looking for cheap beer. Worth a try, and in my opinion, better then Heineken."
"The flavor is alot liek say a moosehead, better than an aal but still shit. German Pilsener? MY ASS. I can't believe the score the Bros gave, must have been pounding the drugs hard that night, this is not to style at all."
"freshness date on bottom of can: 07/2012"
"Overall, pass it up. Couldn't even down half of this one"
"O-I expected some better taste,it has some unusual aroma,which i didn't like."
"O - A decent pilsener, flavour and budget price combine for good drinkability, a much loved beer in my student days."
"Not bad, refreshing and dry. ABV 5%."
"Poured this Pilsner from a 12 oz bottle. The Pilsener poured a straw color and it had very nice clarity. There was a nice fluffy head with above average retention and it produced nice lacing. The aroma of the beer is comprised of sweet honey and lemon. The taste of the German Pilsner was sweet, it had medium body.Overall the beer was very grassy herbal... there was very little if any malt flavor. The beer is nice and smooth, easy to drink."
"Pours a clear golden color with a decent but fastly disappearing head. Scent is rather mild with wheat and bitter malts. The taste is rather weak for a German Pilsner. Slightly grainy with hints of citrus. Rather thin texture that feels about the same as water. It's the kind of taste you expect when they bottle it in a green bottle, but I will say this is better than Heineken."
"As it warmed, it eventually opened up into a slightly watery version of Heineken with the same light and sweet bready malt with a crisp edge to it. Not bad, but not much of a pilsner either. Consider this a pale lager."
"With a little more hops, and some better malts, this could be an ok pilsner."
"Not bad at all."
"Bavaria is trying to be a poor man's Heineken IMO -- it's from Holland, comes in a green bottle, and has similar label graphics, but it's priced quite a bit below Heineken (and comes in those pesky European 11.2 oz/330 ml bottles, which works out to about 1 1/2 12oz bottles fewer per case). Anyway, onto the beer itself. I'm not a Heineken fan; the taste is somewhat similar but the mouthfeel is much thinner -- a lot less body than Heineken, and (relatedly) much fizzier and with a shorter-lasting flavor. Overall not terrible but nothing to write home about."
"O: A beer that quenches the thirst, but besides that - not very interesting."
"Yup, this is actually not bad. Its very crisp and refreshing. Its almost as if I put a slice of lemon in this thing. It has a great aftertaste, lots of hops there. Overall, its a well-rounded beer that is probably overlooked more than it should be. Not too shabby!"
"Overall - I was on the fence with this one.. it had a taste that seemed a little off to me. Maybe even a little harsh. Anyways, it was still worth a try - but I wouldn't buy it again."
"Good thing I have some Belgians I've never seen before on deck!"
"D: Completely refreshing! This is a beer that imo should only be quaffed for quaff sake. Get your lawn-chair out and put on the Oranje game cause your gonna get drunk and go back for more with this one."
"German Pilsener fans would do well to outright ignore this beer's existence and move right along. USC fratboys rejoice (this isn't as much of a slight as it might seem; I attend USC)."
"Food match: Hamburgers, Hot dogs and other fast foods... if you're buying a beer like this I wouldn't recommend spending big on a lavish meal."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable in single or doubles. On a really hot day they are too rich to quaff in quantity."
"D - I think this beer is meant to be a rip-off of Heineken? If so it fails somewhat - in terms of the bottled stuff only, it actually tastes fairly similar to Heineken from the mini-kegs. Overall it's cheap and ok to drink but hardly exciting."
"Gold blond coloured sparkling body with a white head a hoppy spicy aroma a hoppy spicy wattery taste with a wattery bitter finish. Not much flavor. Fair mouthfeel. Lightly bitter and grainy, grassy hoppy and maltish flavour. A very average session beer."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"There might be an average, adjunct-bolstered Euro Pale Lager here (Pilsner? Hah!), but for that acrid skunky odor that was evident upon popping the cap, and carried through to the very end. So not inherently bad, overall, yet it seems to lag in most every respect when held to the proclaimed style, and more so when that light-struck packaging bullshit is factored in."
"if I find this again for a similar price I'll be having it over Heinekin, Grolsch and definitely Amstel."
"M: Crisp, dry mouth feels, very bubbly in my mouth and the nice carbonation makes it very pleasant to drink."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit sweet. Taste is good, sweet, malts, and finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"Notes: Completely typical. Nothing exciting here. Skip this one."
"Crystal clear and gold with a soapy cap of white foam. Sticky, spotty lace and decent head retention. Nice aroma, clean grains and grassy, floral hops, a bit of honey sweetness and bready malt. Mild to moderate hop bitterness that was noticeable throughout and lingered in the finish. Clean malt flavour with floral hops up front and a hint of spice in the finish. Light bodied, moderate to high carbonation, crisp and clean. Quite refreshing and well made. Although nothing stood out as exceptional, it was solid all around."
"I digress - bottom line was that this had a good nose for the style. Mouthfeel was medium with an initial sweetness followed by a hop snap on the tongue. Finish had the same initial sweetness followed by a hoppy bitterness on the extreme finish. It is something like this that makes the madness worthwhile. I would bet that the hops may not hold up as well in a bottle, although I do not speak from experience. I do know that some of the most worthwhile imports that I have drunk in the last few years have been lager beers in a CAN. Definitely cooler-worthy!"
"T: Little bitter in taste with a final very thin, slightly bitter. Body very Light, refreshing, quenching in times of heat"
"Not a great beer but certainly drinkable."
"D: as said above, while heavily carbonated, and it does not taste of any adjuncts nor is there much skunkiness. A good, dependable 'stock' beer that can be drunk at almost any time of the day."
"Agreeable but uninspiring. I can see why they've resorted to media stunts involving hot blonds because the beer just isn't very exciting."
"I might drink this again the price is right, perhaps on a hot day when I feel like downing a 6 pack of tall boys"
"I tried this beer on June 29, 2009 after purchasing fropm one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent pale gold colour with a foamy, bubbly white head, and a ton of effervescent. The aroma was grassy malt, some off aromas, and hops. The mouthfeel was highly carbonated and light-bodied. The flavour was grainy malt with a bitter finish, and some peppery notes."
"Good smooth beer with no off flavors; it's not the best beer in the world but OK for $4 a six-pack."
"What can i say for the rest. It is a very smooth beer with no negative things to say about it. A very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: This beer was actually better than I expected, though not great. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but if I could find it again for the price I bought it for (only $1/can at my local Kroger), I'd buy it without question. Worth a shot."
"Appears golden yellow in color with a small white head that falls to a tiny ring almost instantly. Smells malty with slightly bitter hops. Some caramel. The taste is a lot of rich malt, some dry bitterness, a bit of marzipan. Body is light/medium. Small bubbles light to medium carbonation level. Fairly smooth. Overall easy enough to drink but would likely not go out of my way to purchase again."
"Hmmmm I see that other reviewers have mentioned adjunct. This version of Bavaria I tasted is brewed in South Africa using only malted barley, hops and water."
"Taste is pretty crisp with the grainy malts dominating the flavor profile. There is some hop balancing in there but mostly on the finish. A bit of a musty flavor comes through and a slight metallic bite. It is a step up from Heineken as far as Holland beers are concerned, but not as good as most German pilsners from Deutschland. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Not too bad, but pretty forgettable beer. There are many better options from Germany I would look to before this one."
"Decent Pils, not world class, but certainly affordaable here @ $14 for 6 500ml cans."
"D- This is probably one of the best lagers I've had, mainly because of it's unique aroma and flavor profile...it's a beer that I could drink all night! Alcohol is well hidden as well. It must be the ""pure mineral water"" that is used in the brewing process that makes this different. I highly recommend!"
"D: This is a pleasant brew, but certainly nothing ground breaking here. I certainly would not be opposed to drinking one, and I would probably purchase it again if I saw it on sale and was in the mood for a pilsener. Obviously, the German's do it best, but I found it quite refreshing."
"D - Goes down easy but overall this is a pretty bland yet inoffensive beer."
"Well, a bit of an improvement from the bottled version (skunk-o-rama), but this is still a bit rough for what I expect from an Euro Pils, it'll do in a pinch and it's more crisp than commercial domestics, but I don't have a hankering to consume this on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: A little less than pleasant, unfortunately. While it may be better on draught away from these ghastly green bottles, as it stands, I think you could find far better pilsners out there."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing I would go out of my way to buy like so many other people."
"Served in a glass. Almost no head. Color is gold-like. I smell malt and it also tastes like it and a bit of hops with a bitter aftertaste. It goes down well, really light. Perfect for this hot weather. I'd try it again!"
"Good mouthfeel, very drinkable... obviously this isn't something I'd rush out to get again, but I'm not going to turn my nose up at the overall product."
"D: Taste like Heineken and Grolsch, but much better, very good pilsener, i liked a lot with fish."
"Overall a good beer to buy if knocking back a few at a party."
"Overall: In the same league as Grolsch and Hertog Jan pilsners for me, great for the style. I like this one, especially the quality-prize ratio is excellent (20% cheaper compared to other pilsners). Nice football beer."
"D: A good pilsener that I'll never turn down allthough there are better ones around."
"M&D- The carbonation is impressive and the body is light. High quality drinking here"
"D-This stuff really hit the spot while doing some installation work at home the other day. It was quenching, sessionable, light on the palate, and low enough in alcohol where I didn't need to worry about using power tools after one. It's slightly better than your average macro, and is not bad it it's cold and fresh, although I think the best-by date is pushing the envelope a little (12-2010)."
"This is decent, but nothing that I'd seek out again. Someone gave me a few bottles, and if I found a few in my fridge again I'd certainly toss them back."
"I bought because it was on huge discount and remembered seeing some advertisements :). But I doubt I would ever buy it again."
"Pours clear golden with white head. Smell is slightly skunky, and a bit sweet. Taste is a bit cereal like in its sweetness with a funky bitterness to follow. Crisp and bubbly, watery mouthfeel, but the malt flavor of this tastes a bit cheap. Not my favorite of pale lagers, but drinkable. Wouldn't seek this one out again."
"drinkability: A great choice with limited selection. Not the best pilsner but definitly solid..."
"D: i llove these i can drink alot of them"
"D: OK, but nothing special. Lightness makes it go down easy. I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered to me, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."
"Wouldn't necessarily seek this out, but as a cheap alternative, would drink as a mid-priced German pilsner."
"failed again in my quest for a supermarket label that I'd actually want to drink! pale yellow urine like colour, with a head that subsides quickly leaving a film that looks like someone spat into the glass. I couldn't find a nose, inspite of my best efforts. Taste was not vile like that of many of its adjunct cousins, and that is about the only saving grace."
"The color was light golden yellow. Smell - light, hoppy and 'pilsey'. Taste was of a light wheat and hoppy. 10 times better than the average American pils and lagers. It's mouthfeel was very smooth and light-bodied."
"Taste: I think this needs a bigger bitter finish. If it had more hop bitterness than the drinkability would have scored a little higher from me. It's ok but it failed to wow."
"Bavaria Beer comes in an eight ounce green bottle and pours a golden yellow with a thin white head. There is a mildly skunky aroma in the Heineken vein. The flavor however is more assertively skunky and there is a bit adjunct noticeable. Not much to recommend this one. I'd pass."
"drinkability is easy, but, really, why would you want to? There's nothing to see here, folks, move along."
"Got this in a beer variety pack from World Market. There was nothing at all special about this beer. No different than any of the American Macro lagers in my opinion. Not bad, not good. Not one that I would go out of my way again to get but would drink it if it was the only available."
"Pours a light golden color body, with a medium sized head, big bubbles, but fairly quickly diminishing. Has an aroma of malts. Taste of malts, and is acidic, slightly bitter. Light tasting. Not much flavor."
"Blah, weak lager lacking adequate malt content. Grassy aroma slightly appealing. Average pale gold pour, medium white head, moderate lacing. Light shallow mouthfeel, finishes with a weird emptiness. Flavor is virtually non-existent, really lacking in the malt department I could however detect some mild hop bitterness. Overall a guzzler perhaps, may be refreshing after a long hot day but rather weak."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Pale lager."
"D: Yet another boring, mass-produced, green-bottled beer. Not offensively bad, but simply undistinguished."
"A decent if not insipid Dutch lager. Light in appearance. color, head, aroma, and taste. This makes it crisp and refreshing in a no-brainer type of beer way. Light like some American lagers without the off corn or rice flavors of beers made with adjuncts. Bought a 12 pack on sale at Bevmo for $7.99... good for the price if nothing else. Wouldn't pay the normal retail price of $15 a twelver."
"Bavaria Holland doesn't offer much even as far as Euro Pale Lagers go. Fans of the style might find it tolerable but I just can't see anyone making a convincing case for this beer. It's not something I personally would ever care to go back to anyhow, especially if I felt like having a refreshing beer."
"All in all, the mouthfeel was light to medium, a little creamy, taste was not too sweet or bittery, straight down the middle, but expect some doughy grainy yeasty flavours. I could see me grabbing these (when on special) for a hot aussie day with the fellas & enjoy a session."
"Not bad..."
"It reminds me of a watered down heineken. Probably won't buy again."
"Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. Fairly refreshing, though not the most interesting."
"D: Drinkable, but just not special enough to bring me back."
"D - This is an okay pilsener. At $2 for 22oz it was a good value beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp. Excellent carbonation."
"Easy-to-drink. Could be confused with a standard EPL, but not a bad one at that."
"D: A sub-par pilsener in my opinion. Easy to drink but doesn't deliver the flavours like a good pils should. I would drink it again, but I definitely won't be rushing back to it."
"This was just one of those beers at Total Wine that fell in the miscellaneous group. Had this one chilled in a pub glass. Poured a rich, bright golden with a good white head. Smelled of musty skunkiness, very unique actually. Tasted crisp with hop bitterness and some cooked corn. Light and bubbley on the palate."
"Drinkability: Refreshing but I could use cheaper beer for that."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a basic lager yellow, with a small head. A distinct skunkiness to the nose, and following the initial mild bitterness, that skunkiness popped back up in the taste. Failry smooth with medium carbonation. Nothing special, that skunkiness is irritating though."
"D: I believe a keg of this might be enough."
"Not a terrible brew but not something I would seek out again. Perhaps a notch above other American macros. Mediocre."
"D- Not a bad pils, a nice hop bite balanced by a slight malt sweetness, but a bit watery making it a bit thin and weak. Average!"
"This is a good beer. Way better than I was expecting."
"Aftertaste is short, light bitter and dry."
"Pours a clear gold with fluffy white head which fades quickly. Clinging lacing however. Smell: sweet malts, noble hops, grain/hay. Taste: floral hops, sweet malts. Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, smooth carbonation. It's a bit light even for a Pils, but a decent easy drinking beer."
"Good beer, Woukld be nice to session."
"12oz green bottle with no freshness date. pours a medium gold with a pur white 2 finger head, good longevity and good lace. Nice sweet honey malt smells with slight citrus. Decent malt flavors mixed with honey and lemon. Not a huge typical pilsner hop flavor or bitterness which make it different enough - and in this case different is a good thing. A bit heavy to be super refreshing but good in the winter when tired of the heavier beers. A nice beer."
"Summary: For the price, I believe that this is a better beer for the buck than most others of the same style, could have done without the green bottle though."
"Watery and bubbly, crisp texture. If you like Heinekin you'll like this."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, a little on the thin side."
"A pretty average euro lager. Will avoid."
"D-> Easy to drink, you can drink a bottle in no-time"
"Overall this was a pretty affordable beer, and not bad for the price that I paid. Little over 6 bucks a six pack. This beer felt like a pretty watered down version of peroni, or even Stella Artois. Besides that it was a beer I could see myself buying down the road."
"For the price, this is a decent beer...picked up a 12 at a Latin grocery store in Miami out of pure curiosity...Pours pale gold with a small head with no lace. Smells bitter and hopy, just as it tastes. Decent carbonation and the mouthfeel is very light, bitter, and clean. The only reason someone should drink more than 3 of these if for the price, not really the taste...but worth a try"
"It's a fine thirst quencher and likely works well with mild tilapia or simple pasta. But as a stand alone beer, it's largely forgettable."
"A light golden-brown brew with a big head at first, but little left after a few minutes, solid lacing however. Smell is very weak, A slight hoppy/wheat thing, not bad but not very discernable. A hint of metal no doubt associated with it's cute little 250ml can that a friend brought back from Aruba for me. The flavor is mild cereal stuff, but not too bad. I note some alcohol although this is just 5% ABV. Fair carbonation for a refreshing drink. A peppery/tangy touch on the tongue. Sort of grows on you but with only 250ml to work with I will just say this is OK enough, wouldn't turn it down, worth a try on a hot day, but not to write home about."
"From a can, this yellow brew is unimpressive at best. It has a small head and a very light, clear appearance. The aroma is grassy, with a very slight herbal hop smell. Not much in the way of malt or grain in the smell. The taste is slightly sweet, with a serious metallic quality. No real flavor, and nearly no bitterness. It's quite carbonated, and with the thinness, it gives a bit of a soda-water impression. The finish is pretty empty. I really didn't get anything out of this brew. Not really satisfying, even as a lawnmower beer."
"Nice non-aggressive mouthfeel, but overall this is a very skunk-focused beer."
"D: I could drink a few of these. A notch better than your typical euro-lager."
"Lots of the ol euro skunk yeast on first sniff, it subsides after a few minutes. Hey, the taste is not bad at all, malty and mellow but with a sharp hop bite to finish. I only had one for a sample, but Ive seen these around in 12 packs for under $9  not a bad deal for a lawnmover, or session sucking beer. Better tasting and cheaper than Heinecrap."
"Pours a golden straw color with a lot of chunky white head that laces the glass, not bad. I could smell the skunk when I opened the bottle at waist height. There's also some malty and yeasty smells there and a hint of floral hops. But damn, the skunk! The taste is very smooth and clean, with a tiny bit of hop flavor/bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is a fairly creamy. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, I just wish they hadn't put it in a green bottle."
"not overall inpressed with this one.would be a good sesion beer.for the price you probably could do better."
"Poured a light pale golden color with a big white head and a nice streaming carbonation from the bottom. Smell was very yeasty, with the classic lager smell. Hints of a slight hoppiness could be detected. First impression of the taste was light, crisp, clean and refreshing. Flavors are atypical of the style and nothing exceptional. Overall though it is a fantastic little sessionable lager, I actually prefer to heineken."
"Try this one, you wont be pissed at me."
"Overall I would say that Bavaria is about your average Euro Pale Lager. It is pretty easy to drink, but the aftertaste will make you pretty thirsty. I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for an alternative from the more trendy green bottle beers."
"Pours a clear pale yellow color with a medium bone white head without much retention. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is grainy malt with a bit of hops. Light-bodied and clean mouthfeel with mild malt and hops flavors. The finish is sweet malt and fruit with a touch of hops on the back end. Overall this beer is a straightforward Pils/Lager that is instantly forgotten."
"This is a good everyday beer with its value. Poured with a huge, frothy, foamy, textured off-white head and plenty of lace. Head mostly dissipated shortly. Yellow gold color. Fresh beery, lightly hoppy and malty nose. Flavor's about the same but more emphasis on the hops. Body's a bit thin at first when it's colder. Easy drinking. A session beer."
"Could easily have scored this a lot lower, not a beer I would choose again."
"D - Overall, inoffensive. Not terribly exciting though."
"M&D: the texture is alright, not too fizzy and not too thin, almost clean if not for the finishing sugary touch; nevertheless, the overall flavour fails to make an impression of a quality Pilsner-style lager, if that is the style this beer purports to be."
"Overall good drinkability, but nothing to get too excited over."
"Clear golden straw in color, with active carbonation and a small bit of sediment. Topped off with a finger's worth of tight, white bubbles. The head falls away quickly to an inconsequential ring. Besides the lagery grain base that one expects, there was an appetizing hint of honey in the nose. Unfortunately, this was offset by a bit of dusty skunkiness. The taste was better than I expected, though unremarkable. Grainy and somewhat sweet, with the bubbles adding some crispness. It's all fleeting, though, as nothing about this beer sticks around. As pilseners go, this one is drinkable but uninspiring."
"I really hate wasting beer with so many uneducated beer drinkers out there but this isn't beer...it's fizzy skunk juice."
"Watery mouthfeel but good drinkability - quite refreshing on a hot day or as a session beer, but nothing earth-shattering. Compares well to other European lagers at a better price point. Very true to style."
"It poured a handsome golden color with decent head formation, which left no lacing. It smelled good; not in a ""big beer"" sense, but it was light and refreshing. Taste and mouthfeel were not all that great though. It was thicker than I felt it should be, and not really refreshing at all. Taste was not off-putting, but seemed syrupy almost, which was not was I expecting (a light and refreshing lager)."
"Drinkability is bad. I would go after a Bud Light over this ANY day. If you see this beer, run, don't walk in the direction of the nearest IPA and forget you ever saw it."
"I drank this pilsner stright out of the bottle. It has a little Heineken tyoe smell, but not much. It tastes good for the price, I paid 8.99 for twelve bottles. It is smooth, tastes like a macro but with more flavor, and the flavor is good. Definitely high drinkability, I recommend this beer as a break from the heavier beers."
"Okay, lets talk about the beer. Bavaria is brewed in Lieshout, Holland by the Bavaria Brewery. Note: They also produce Hollandia, which is very similar to Bavaria, if not identical. Bavaria is a typical Dutch Lager, being both medium gold and moderately hopped. It pours brilliantly clear and foamy, with a somewhat short-lived head. The aroma is clean malt with very subtle noble hop and yeast notes. The body is on the light side, but appropriate for the style. The flavor is crisp and clean, with moderate malt flavor and a short, mellow hop bite. I also detected some oxidation in the finish, despite the fact that this beer is only 3-4 months old. This is not surprising since light lagers dont tent to travel well, and this beer probably spent most of that time in a hot warehouse in the middle of the Texas Summer. Overall, I think this beer compares very favorably to other Dutch lagers. While it is not as assertive as Alfa Edelpils or Dommelsch, it is at least as tasty as Grolsch or the Big-H. Ill give this one a 4, based on being true to style, very drinkable, and an outstanding value. Bavaria is one of the best (if not *the* best) throw-down beers available."
"I was expecting a Heineken-type of dutch import, but it was actually somewhat better than that. Poured the expected light golden color with white head, but unlike others of its type, the head lingered for the entire glass and left very good lacing. Has the typical grainy lager aroma, but the taste is flavorful, and the finish is smooth. This actually was not too bad of a beer."
"Bavaria was golden in color with a thick white head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was light malt with a little hops in the background. The taste was fairly light, and about the same as the aroma with a dry finish. The body was fairly light with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's not as hoppy as I like, but is still a decent pilsener."
"Not much to smell or look at, this beer had a pronounced bitterness, with little redeeming malt. I was OK with it, bit could not finish a 500 ml. can and it was not popular with my dinner mates. While not metallic, the taste was a bit harsh and thin."
"There's been better."
"Honestly, it might be a little skunked...BEWARE THE GREEN BOTTLE."
"A deep golden color with visible signs of carbonation, a small head forms, but dissolves away quickly, leaving a visible film on top. The scent of malt is very evident, with some fruity aromas at the end. The taste is very malty, but surprisingly there is no bitterness there at all. Maybe a slight twang of hops at the end, but is not very consistant in the flavor. It is light in the mouth, not much of a feel of the carbonation. Very surprising flavor for a lager, I was expecting a little more in hops from this beer. Still, it is very easy to drink."
"A decent Euro all malt golden lager....clean malty tastem subdued lemmony hopping, soft mouth feel...no surprizes or over complexity....very drinkable....Ill buy more if there is no JR Brickman around."
"Strong honeyish malt flavour, a bit cloying in texture. I feel thirsty after swallowing. Some bland, seedy back palate, without any notable hop flavour to balance the malt. Touch of bitterness. Lacks balance."
"Low body and refreshing. Not a great beer, but for the price, and thirst-quenchiness in the summer, a nice one to have around."
"Poured an average light staw color with minimal lacing and head. Smell was typical lager smell. Taste was also typical, but a bit crisper and a bit more flavor than most american macros. Mouthfeel was light and crisp. Drinkability was good as with most lagers."
"Reminded me a bit of Heineken, slight off-smell. A good mix of malt and hops flavor. A fairly crisp finish. Nothing outstanding, but a solid brew."
"If you enjoy Heineken, I highly recommend that you try some Bavaria."
"Opinion: Well, this is a pretty decent beer, and one that I would put up there with Heineken. It sucks that it comes in a green bottle because it suffered as a result of it. It seems a bit light in the loafers when compared to other German Pilsners, but still the malt complexity and balance is nice. This is not my absolute favorite beer, but for the price I would take it over quite a few others."
"Could deffenitly drink a 12 pack if that is what I chose for the night for that excallent praice who can complain?"
"D - Barely OK. Not much going on here. What's next?"
"Very easy to drink and very refreshing. I liked it for what it was. So it ain't no Prima Pils, but it's still a decent pils."
"Had a metallic smell to it. Low head, great lacing however, it lasted quite some time. Deep golden color with high carbonation I thought. Mouthfeel was medium-watery for a light beer. An import version of a lawnmower beer. I could still drink a few after getting over the initial aroma."
"d: not bad tasting, and pretty easy to put down a few"
"finish is crisp and not too sweet. I'd say that value for money this is ranks highly in the Eurolager heap. Heck, it is only ten cents more than Holsten and Lasko Club which frankly suck."
"Overall, this beer seemed to be a toned-down Heineken (as if Heineken needed toning down). I wouldnt especially recommend it unless you are just looking for a different take on the Euro lager."
"Dutch beer sold in my country, 3 years ago; since my first bottle its flavor was robust, with body; but i´m not impressed because is a dutch beer in a german style; however this beer is good for a european cuisine, not for mexican food; try serve this beer in a tall mug for its foam and appreciate its rich blond color; 65% recommended."
"This was in a jumbo 16.9oz. bottle! Since I was outside washing the motorcycle, I just drank this right from the bottle. Popped the cap and it held a slight white head for quite a while. Had a typical pilsner crispness, light bodied and well carbonated. Decent hoppy finish without being overpowering. Since it was such a big bottle, it started warming as I drank it but taste didn't suffer in the least because of it which was a BIG surprise. Good summer brew."
"In my neck of the woods this is a readily available in supermarkets for not a lot of cash.I thinkit represents reasonable value for money for a Euro macro lager that you dont have to travel to find"
"Yes, in Summertime I'll buy this one again, and again, and again."
"Crisp, refreshing -drinkable."
"this is my favorite pilsener. they used to sell this at dominicks for 10.99 a twelver and i would buy it frequently ... oh well"
"Is this a Pilsener, or is it a poor Amercian adjunct? It would rate slightly higher if it wasn't classified as a Pilsener. It barely had any color, it was a very clear light yellow. It had some head that hung around for a bit. Taste was unimpressive, hops barely detectable. Mouthfeel was like drinking a poorly carbonated light beer. I imagined what Coors light tasted like without the fizz."
"the beer is very drinkable, non-offencive, you could give this to a bud/miller drinker and they might think it a little to bitter. but on a hot day this would go down easy."
"I love cheap liquor store pick-ups. For curiosity's sake I have this sitting in a pint glass in front of me. Pours just a tinge darker than straw yellow. Virtually no head but very slight lacing. Smell has a touch of sweet malt with just a bit of grassy/peppery hop aroma. Taste is... Well, taste is very clean and mildy sweet before a very gentle hoppiness rolls over the tongue. Hop taste has a decent pepper subtleness. Typical pale lager I assume. Unoffending in everyway but not worth repeated drinking in my opinion."
"Overall, quite refreshing and clean. A very drinkable brew, if a little forgettable."
"Not a bad lager, not skunked which is always a great sign"
"Pale gold with a bit more life in the color than the Tuborg I had just prior. The head is fuzzy and dry looking, and lasts for a bit. The flavor is definitely on the adjuncty side, but not offensive. The flavor is soft, a good bit of rice, but not in a foul way. Very low bitterness and very low hop aroma. Very soft on the palate."
"This beer was on special for $1.50 where I watched Lions game yesterday so decided to have one and thats all I could really handle.Pours a deeper yellow than most adjunct lagers with a thin white head that was gone in a blink of an eye,aroma was a little skunky with big doses of corn husk pretty much what I figured.Taste was watery and very bland with a little corn flavor.This brew is pretty bad it didnt even measure up to the Icehouse (the other beer special)so u know it has to be bad,I would take aHeineken over this next time I wont care about the specials it will be Carolina Blond all day."
"Pours to a thin white head that dies out. Color is somewhat darker than heineken. Aroma starts skunky and once the skunk goes away resolves to a sweet malt and noble hops aroma that is typical of the style plus an added aroma of fermented corn and alcohol. Flavor is very unremarkable for the style--not too exciting. Has a noticable alcohol kick that I like. Finishes dry."
"My wife bought this for me this evening and I'm very proud of her. At $4.50 for the six pack I'd have to say this was the find of the year. I might have her pick up a few more for my non BA buddies."
"I doubt that anyone is tripping over Bavaria Holland since there aren't that many reviews. If you happen to see it on the shelves, just nod and walk on by. It isn't worth your time or your money."
"This might be the most heavily carbonated beer that I have ever drank. It's so fizzy that it's hard to swallow right out of the bottle, which is a shame because the bottles are pretty... Once it's been poured into a glass and allowed to set a while, it goes down alright."
"I had a bottle of this on a hot day in Texas. It was refreshing but not very satisfying. Similar to Heineken in its malt profile, being grassy rather than grainy. The head was there for the pour but disappeared quickly. After about half the glass I was thinking about something better for my next beer, knowing there were about 6 better beers in the fridge. It had a slight bitterness which lasted just a bit longer than the swallow. If you don't want to pay more than $3 for a 6-pack this is the beer for you. Personally, I'd prefer something more substantial."
"I paid $6.99 for a 12 pack of bottles of Bavaria Beer. It has to be one of the cheapest imports I've had. Overall Bavaria is a pretty average Pilsener in appearance smell, and taste. Nothing unexpected or great came out of this beer, but overall its solid enough to enjoy at a good price. I would choose it as a session beer over much of the similiarly priced macros on the market and recommend it to beer fans who don't always feel like shelling out a lot of cash for other micros and exports."
"While I could drink some of these, I probably wouldn't if I have a better choice."
"Straw-colored in appearance with a thin layer of off-white head that makes a decent attempt to lace the glass. Aromas are sweet, malty, with a hint of bitterness. And an overshadowing skunked facet. Flavor is also on the sweet side. Very clean, crisp and short-lived. Nothing too hefty or thought-provoking. Finishes again with the sweetness. Thin and low-bodied. Not drinkable."
"This pours like the perfect lager. Looks great. Clear and bright, golden yellow color, a large frothy pure white head of foam. Nice lace on the glass. Pleasant graininess in the nose. Gives off some lemony notes, and some sourness. The taste is full of sweet graininess. Theres a soft citus hop bite in there too, but its hidden well and has no harshness. Light malt body and leaves a sticky sweetness in the throat. This is a light and enjoyable Macro-Euro lager. Comparable to say a Stella or Orangeboom. I could drink more of this."
"Too bitter to have more than one. Overall not a great beer."
"Cheaper than Heineken, but it seems to smell and taste that way as well. It poured to a decent pilsener gold, but that's where my kind words end. Is that rice in the taste? The colder it is the better, which doesn't speak well for this beer's quality."
"Pours a clear pale yellowish-orange color with a modest off-white head. The smell consists of a skunky lemon twang hops and fresh-cut grass. The taste is very comparable to Heineken with the common lemony hop twang (again) and an earthy grain. This beer is very light bodied and finishes with a hint of corn sweetness. Not great, but this one will do in a pinch. Cheers!"
"Visually this beer is excellent, with a relatively longlasting head and a glorious golden lager colouration. Looks, however are not everything! It has a clean sweetish taste followed by a crisp faintly bitter finish. I would describe this beer as ""modest but likeable"" it doesn't exactly scream out with flavour but what is there is sufficent and certainly drinkable. As other reviewers have said - the price certainly aids in appreciating it!"
"This golden pilsner poured a nice head which went away pretty quickly. This brew had a sweet smell to it with a taste to match with not much of a hop followthru. It has a very thin mouthfeel to and is a beer I would drink again if offered to me but one I would not seek to buy."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white head. The aroma is average. There is the presence of pale malts and lager yeast. It is a bit less skunky than most of this style. It has a bit of green glass aroma, but not too overpowering. The taste is decent. It is light and actually tasteful. It has a bit of a malty aftertaste which pushes it ahead of most purely because it has some distinguishing characteristic. It is quite mellow, but has a slight metallic flavor to it. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks well for a pilsner. I enjoyed it."
"Green Bottle. No Fresh Date."
"Well, this was the most popular imported beer in Kazakhstan in the mid-nineties. That's about the most I can say for it. It pours a perfectly acceptable, utterly unremarkable clear gold with a small white head that sticks around a bit and leaves a bit of lace. The nose is powerful, actually pungent, with rice or grain or something. The mouth is very prickly, and full of sourish grain. The taste is stale malt and bad bread, with a weak hops chaser that can't break through the mold. The aftertaste is heavy and stale. Not a good product."
"not something i drink much, i only get it if im in a hurry and theres nothing better. it does go down the trap ok overall, but not one of my favorites. the dutch should just go all out and brew a mull beer. that would at least make their beers more interesting than this type of thing."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a typical straw yellow color with a good head that lasted, and some good lacing on the glass. Aroma is floral and sweet. That is all I can say good about this! Taste is just awful. Watery and thin, with some bitterness in the finish. This is one beer I won't bother with again!"
"Found this beer for 5.99 a 12 pack and as i was having people over for a bbq- i figured id get this as a back up.. I was pleasently surprised. It pours a nice light straw colour.. The smell is what i expected from a green bottle lager, but it was lacking the typical skunkiness that I have found so often. The taste was similar to a deskunked fresh Heineken. It was nice and crisp and Clean with the hops giving it a nice slight bitterness in the finish. While i cant drink more than on Heineken ( cant stand it) i found my self thinking that this was not too bad a beer and much more drinkable than Heineken, Becks, or other Green bottle euro lagers.. Overall a suprisingly average beer, but that was not neccessarily a bad thing."
"Light gold color, medium white head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. Light tasting, slightly hoppy. Fairly standard pilsner style beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Nice balance. Nice, but nothing special. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is hoppy, slightly bitter."
"Flavor is clean and crisp, with that distinct dutch flavor. I don't know what it is, maybe the yeast, but it has a specific flavor. Maybe the hopping. Anyways, light and mildly sweet, a touch of corn-like sweetness, with lively carbonation and a sparkling clean mouthfeel. Hops are well done, and adequately provide a crisp, tangy finish. Aftertaste is negligible, disappearing from your mouth almost as soon as it's swallowed. I was happy with this pilsner, and I walked into the beer without any preconceived idea of what it would be like. I honestly had no idea, and was pleasantly surprised."
"This beer pours a clear medium light yellowish golden color with a moderate clingy white head that has large bubbles. The smell is malty with fading skunky hoppiness. The taste is cookielike/syruppy sweetness with a balancing sharp hoppiness and a thin to moderate mouthfeel. This is a suprisingly tasty beer that I think would be extremely nice if it were available fresher."
"Beer pours a typical pale yellow for a pils style, head dissipates quickly. There is an arome, but I can't describe it well...somewhat floral. I'm getting a somewhat bitter aftertaste, which is surprising given the thin mouthfeel and watery finish. OK, so they used some hops. Really not much to get excited about here. If you love Heineken, get this instead and save two bucks on the sixer. If you love good beer, get something else. This is average beer all the way, not much different than our domestic macros."
"A bad beer. not worth having twice."
"This beer is a crystal clear golden yellow with a minimal white head and no lace. A delicate nose is actually very nice and leaves a pleasant bouquet that is quite clean and bright. The flavor is sweet with very little hop bitterness, if any. Clean, crisp taste with no lingering aftertaste. The body is very light, but not watery, and the overall sense is of a nice sweet light beer that finishes with great dryness. Not at all hateful."
"This brew poured a white head that dissolved fast and it had fine-small bubbles. There was very little lacing on the sides of my glass with this brew. There was carbonation observed with this brew rising to the top. In my opinion the aroma was fruity and citrusy. There was a bitter taste to this brew as well as an aftertaste."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to large sized white bubbles that soon disappeared. It had a straw yellow body with carbonation continuously rising from the bottom of my mug. It has a strong hop aroma and a fizzy somewhat bitter start that lingers well into its bitter finish. There is actually some hidden flavors other than those from the hops that hides itself well in the finish. They were somewhat floral in flavor."
"Not that bad, actually, just not very good. And, lucky me, I chose a pint can to sample. Wee, wee, wee, all the way home!"
"Believe this could be an aquired taste in the making."
"Pours out a pale gold, with loads of carbonation bubbles rising to the top, where they meet up with a fluffy white head. Theres nothing much to this beer, seems to be a standard lagar from holland. Quite similar to a few other ""green bottle"" beers ive had from the area."
"Pours a golden color. Little head which leaves quickly. Smell is floral. Taste is full bodoed for green bottles, lightly malty with nice carbonation. Very refreshing, as a Pilsner should be. Floral accents in the taste. Hops present, but the malt is where the action is. This is a decent pilsner."
"Pours a clear light to medium golden color with a foamy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin and patchy lace. Nose is sweet malts and stale grains with a bit of skunkiness. Very light and crisp mouthfeel. Taste is sweet grains blended with some notes of dried grass and hay and is somewhat astringent. Some faint notes of citrus give a bit of a tart flavor to the finish. This is not a beer I would drink often."
"Pours a clear gold with a persistent white head that leaves quite a bit of lace on the glass. Aroma of honey, cooked veggies, and hay. Also a very slight skunkyness. Flavor is overly sweet, with a herbal/vegetal finish that is slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth but watery. Not terrible, but not a beer that I'm likely to buy again."
"Poured a very light golden color, with a white frothy head that faded into a light glaze over the top of the glass that left a good lace all the way down. The taste was not at all what I expected. It had no hint of skunk like its other more famous Holland brew and was very fresh and drinkable. I would seek it out again but I have not seen it anywhere in my town outside of the Beers of the Season box that I got for my Birthday. Very good."
"The beer pours a translucent gold or straw color if you like, the head average and white, lace covers the glass. Malt is dominate in the nose, lemon like crispness, somewhat sweet, and so is the start, top cadaverous, finish astringent, minimally hopped, droughty aftertaste and not a beer that Trips My trigger."
"If I were a fan of Heineken, I probably would have liked this more, but it wasn't bad, nonetheless. Barest touch of skunk slunk behind a grassy/herbal soft aroma. Sweet grain, hinting at sweet-feed, with a sourish finish. Just enough hops to be noticed. Finish was very clean and crisp."
"This is easily my favorite Hollish beer that I have tried. It easily beats Heineken and is even a step or two above St. Pauli Girl. It pours a golden straw color with decent head that thins out to a layer that stays on top to the bottom of the glass. The smell good without a skunky aroma commonly found with other Hollish beers. The taste was very good with nice maltiness paired with the hops. It is very smooth and very drinkable. This is a great brew that I will definitely get again, probably many times. The best part is that it is imported by a company here in my home city of Dallas and is frequently on sale."
"This is a great refreshing beer on those hot Florida summer days."
"Pours an absolutely crystal clear deep golden body topped by a frothy but etheral head which drops to a minor collar and whispy surface covering within seconds. The aroma offers a soft grainy maltiness and a mildly skunked herbal hoppiness. The body is medium with a fine-bubbled carbonation that's just below standard levels (@ 2.4 volumes CO2) and gives a light tingle on the tongue before becoming fairly creamy in the mouth. The flavor melds a semi-rich and lightly sweet maltiness with a lightly earthy and herbal hoppiness so well that they appear almost as one. I'd imagine that this might be a factor of freshness except that the skunkiness is so limited (and the bottle appears quite new). If it's possible, I might suggest that this beer is too well balanced! It seems to lose character as it's become quite one-sided. Bitterness is clearly present, as is hop flavor, but it's restrained. And the limited level of carbonation doesn't help to bring out what is there. Still, there are some nice malt and hop flavors in this easy to drink beer giving it a fairly good drinkability. Nice, but overshadowed by many other European pilseners."
"Typical European Lager aroma, fairly mild skunkiness, and once that fades, a fairly decent creamy-grassy/hay, citrus, and hops bouquet is noticeable.  The palate is similar to the nose; just add in some mouth-watering (literally) sourness.  The body is pale yellow with a white head of a 1/2-inch, good retention and decent lace.  All aspects of this beer are typical for the style... if you like the style, try it.  I feel it is less flavorful that Grolsch but better than Heineken."
"Pleasant medium gold in color with a thick and creamy off-white head with good retention.  Lots of carbonation, sticky lace coats the glass wall.  Pleasing aroma consists of grassy notes, sweet malt, lemon, and slight hops.  Flavor begins with slightly sweet malts and a surge of carbonation, mild hops rise in the middle of the taste, finish is dry and mildly bitter.  As other reviewers have noted, this beer is a good value, I paid $3.49 for a six-pack of 12 oz bottles, leaving little to complain about."
"Clear as a bell, just on the gold side of straw in color.  Head is very white and a pretty dead affair after 40 seconds.  A little clove to the aroma, not much detectable skunk.  Sweet and malty upfront, a little sense of Karo syrup and an unfortunate walk toward elements of that glue on the back of brown mailing tape.  Finishes quickly thereafter but the hops are mediocre, very macro-like.  Forgetable beer in practically all aspects."
"Crystal clear golden hue.  Efferevescent & topped by a thick, fluffy head that settles into a moderate, lace - leaving layer.  Cooked veggies, grassy hop, pungent sulfur, and grain husk in aroma.  The off putting sweetness and astringent grain flavors coupled w/ the meager hop bitterness and lack of any noteable hop flavor render this brew most unenjoyable and rough.  Finishes w/ a lingering cabbage soup flavor & dextrin sweetnesss.  A drop or two of isomerized alpha acid would make Bavaria more palettable... barely.  Craptastic!"
"Sort of the poor-man's Heineken. I can get a sixer of it in the 16 oz. cans for $5 by me. It's good on a hot Summer's day, but that's about it."
"Whoa. its drinkable, but that doesn't make it good or interesting, cheap though, so its not a total waste."
"Bavaria: Ive only had it in 16 ounce cans they sell at the ballpark. Clear golden appearance, with nice, white head (the plastic cups dont do much for appearance). Never had it skunked, unlike its comrades Henie and Becks. Rich malty taste and very pleasant hops taste toward the end. Nice pleasnt Pils taste. A winner."
"Notes: A semi-clean Euro lager, better than the usual mass-marketed import and at less than $5 a six pack it is a steal!"
