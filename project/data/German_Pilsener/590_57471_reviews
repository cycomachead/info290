"O: All-around just an excellent lager.  Somewhat reminiscent of the amber “Landbiers” that one can find in remote outposts in Bavaria and Franconia.  Exceptional when consumed fresh."
"This is an edit on my previous rating/review. Pours a nice honey amber color and has a subtle herbal hop scent.  Light bodied and smooth. Classic lager flavor with a hoppy finish. Infinitely drinkable."
"Exceptional lager..a very well balanced brew..I had this on tap and in the bottle..the tap seems to give this one more life if that makes sense..I  am not very good at writing reviews but I have sampled enough beers  to know  a great one when I taste it and as far as lagers go this is one of my favorites"

"O: great offering from new Glarus, must try, little heavier than other German pilsners I would say"
""
"I'll skip the real review, but need to mention there's an amazingly striking lemon juice element that fronts this flavor profile."
""
""
""
"Be the instant hit of backyard BBQs by bringing a case of this lager!"
"It was a little bit above average."

"Good beer, excellent smell / color, great body, awesome taste"
"Overall / Drinkability:  A very tasty lager and one that I could easily drink another of.  I wish I had a six pack of this as the beer is very drinkable, but I got this one bottle as a gift so it will be awhile before I can locate another.  Overall, a well crafted pilsner/lager, but not as hoppy as I would have expected for a German Pilsner - the malt is the theme for this beer and it shows nicely.  This beer went very well with food (Chicken schnitzel, green beans) and I think it would go very well with a wider range of food as well.  A great overall lager."

"Slightly hazy medium golden color with a decent head. Aromas of rich sweet bready pilsner malt with hints of light fruit and extremely faint floral hops. Sweet bready maltiness without much to provide balance. Fruity flavor seems out of place in a clean lager. Easy enough to drink but needs some tweaking."

"Solid Lager. No technical flaws. It would be nice if the beer had some more hops. The malt profile is enjoyable and the yeast created a nice mellow smooth beer. Reminds me quite a bit of mama's little yellow pils."

"It's probably a terrific lager, but I'm not a fan of the style and this one is very malt-forward. Bad news for a hop-lover like me. It certainly has much more flavor than your run-of-the mill mass-produced lager. It has a fairly deep golden coloring with lots of lacing on the pour."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours red orange with a fluffy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Smells of nice malted barely, slight fruit. Tastes of fruit, especially berries, nice grain and fruit balance. Beer is light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."

"On our way through Rt. 90 across the great midwest, Wisconsin was a gem of a state.  After countless hours of SD tourist trap desperation, our very first WI gas stop produced a store with a full aisle of New Glarus, cheese and meat sticks.  After days of Wyoming evil eyes and South Dakota biker madness, Wisconsin was amazing.  My first purchase was a mixed 12er of New Glarus that  included Two Women Lager.  I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot after a couple bottles of Spotted Cow, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This one pours a little darker than your average pils, and has a very pleasant, soft malt flavor.  The hops are understated, but I don't feel like this is a nouveau-american pils with a blast of spicy european hops.  I like that, but I'm enjoying the mellowed feel of this beer.  It may not be flashy, but this is a rock solid beer worthy of attention.  I'd happily host a BBQ with a few of these."

"Classic German Pilsner. Not at all what I expected from reading the label and description. Overall nice aroma and mouth feel. Not much staying power of the hops at the finish. Did take me back to my travels in Germany. Will try again given the opportunity."
""
"O-pretty tasty pilsener, great summer beer and easy drinking"
""
""
""
""

"O - Very drinkable beer.  Very good body for this style of beer.  Not heavy, but not excessively light either. 4/5"

"O - New Glarus' Two Women has a great story behind it, representing two craft beer companies run by women in a male-dominated industry but I think with all his talent, Dan could do a little better with this beer. Balanced hopping brings the tasty malts to a very clean and drinkable level but, I find the lack of carbonation to give the beer a somewhat slick and flat feel; it's not quite lively enough which would coincidentally reflect Deb's personality well!"

"New Glarus Two Women ---4/5."

"Fantastic Lager, the best that I have ever had. It has a beautiful crystal clear coppery color. Smells and tastes very smooth. It has a rich dark color but a light body, great for summer. There is a very low bitterness, just enough to complement the malts. Can't say enough good about this lagered sweetheart of a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A marvelous craft lager from New Glarus, a brewing company well known for their traditional styles. This is a good US produced German pilsner, but I would have liked to see a more significantly bitter brew to make it truly old-world in style. Nonetheless, for lager lovers, this is a must try."

"Two Women is a really well crafted beer. It's straightforward, satisfying, and off the charts drinkable. Clean and crisp. This is a beer I find myself buying each and every time I head up north."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is delicious and well-balanced. Malts dominate, naturally, but there is a nice and fruity citrus hops edge in here near the finish. Exemplary for the style, and a superior lager!"

"O: Absolutely delicious lager/pils. Such low community ratings for this beer confirms BA Rube bias against lagers as a genre."

"Overall- Very nice year-round lager, nothing I didn't expect from New Glarus. It's a nice mix of Märzen and Czech Pilsner."

"O: An excellent lager with distinctive aroma and flavor. Can't wait to have this again!"

"O-Much better than it smelled, nothing special. But for a style I'm not usually fond of this was decent."
""
""
"For me this would be a better summer sessionable brew. Very easy drinking as I believe pilsners should be. Great example of a pilsner. There is a sweetness there, though, that may prevent me from drinking too much. I'll have to get more to really put my finger, er...tongue on it."
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. This seems like a brew caught between a marzen and a czech pils but leaning more towards marzen. Not bad but not great either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not a German pilsener fan at all, but this beer I am a big fan of. That's all there is to it."

"I say this without hesitation... This is the best lager I've ever had. Easy to drink and doesn't fill you up - a perfect session beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is very clean with hints of malt and hops but not much else."
""
"This pours a rich caramel color with generous foam. It has a light malty-sweet caramel aroma that gives way to a delicately bodied slightly sweet ale with a hint of caramel. Two Women is a pleasing session ale. I did not think of this as a pilsner while sipping, however."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a superb pils. One of the best I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A crisp, clean, hoppy german lager. NG does the style well, but personally I like the sweetness to be a little more subdued. Its not over powering by any means, just a personal preference on the style being more balanced."
""
""
""
"O- This is a solid lager. No characteristics make it stick out as amazing, but it was a good drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While it goes down pretty easy when cold, this brew still reminds me of something that belongs in a green twist-off bottle. Its something in between BMC and Boster Lager, which I realize is a large spectrum, but for me everything on this side of the lager scale just showcases why this isn't my favorite style. Still a fine offering and a good brew for what it is."
""
"Amber in color with great clarity. Minimal foam on the top. Lively carbonation. Simple aroma of pale malt and lager yeast dominate the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. The flavor showcases the malt and is meant to be pretty laid back. A decent beer for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very tasty, slightly malt-forward pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into pilsener glass; golden orange with a fluffy white head that fades into a thick disc of foam after a bit, leaving some spotty lacing. Smell is sweet caramel malt, slight crisp hops, and some light notes of lager yeast. Taste is toasted malt, very crisp and clean lager flavor with some crisp light hops finishing out the end. Simple and delicious."

"look is a pale straw color with a bone white head. retention/lacing is ok. smell is wheaty, yeasty, with a light dry hoppy smell. taste follows, along with the taste of signature NG yeast and nutty grain/malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"thanks to my friend from rockford il for the 2 women sample. this beer is everything that a solid lager can be. to me, it represents the simple, yet fresh and enjoyable, taste that can be created with water, malt, hops, and yeast. it has a full, rich taste profile and goes well with just about any food from nachos to burgers. so easy to drink...i will gladly have this brew again."
""
""
""
""
"Low C"
""
""
""
""
"Toasty malt forward. Toasty crackers mix up with grassy, earthy hops on the finish. Pretty good carbonation bubbling on the tongue too. Crisp, malty, but well balanced, and very easy to drink. Would be a regular go to beer if I could get my hands on it in IL."

"Pours tan with a high fluffy white head - way darker than any pilsner I've seen. The smell is bread dough and green grass, with something sharp and almost spicy in it. The taste is rich and doughy, with some savory notes going into a bitter twinge at the end. It's a little thick, highly carbonated. All in all, this is a very good lager, but I don't buy it as a pilsner - more like a dortmunder or even a bock. I'd drink it if I saw it again, and gladly, but it's not at all to style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Ok beer. Straightforward but enjoyable for what it is."
""
""
"Don't get me wrong; this is a VERY good brew. But it's not New Glarus's typical level of stellar."
""

"O- A very nice beer. I have never had a German Pilsner, or not that I know of. So comparing styles is a hard one for me. This is a very clean, crisp, and refreshing beer. Not a very light beer, but something that would be nice on a warm spring day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice lager beer and a good choice for sessioning."
" Not your typical pilsner. Fairly light in mouthfeel, but the darker malts and unclean fruity character add more complexity than anticipated."
"Well done."
""
""
""
"This beer is crisp and clean, much closer to a Vienna Lager. It very creamy and rich on the mouthfeel.The hops give it nice bitterness that I didn't think i would like but it fits the beer very well. I can crush this beer all day long while watching a football game."
"Had this back to back with Home Town Blonde, and this is smoother, while also far less hoppy and crisp. This tastes closer to a Vienna Lager by my palate. The barley is almost creamy, with subtle caramel and toffee. You might even mistake it for an Irish red. The hops just provide balancing bitterness to this amber lager. Maybe I taste a touch of citrus in the finish, I can't say for certain. As it warms, I get a touch of grass in the aroma. There's a little fruit, but I think it's coming from the malt. This is an easy-drinking crowd-pleaser, but also a finely-crafted lager. It's closer to Spotted Cow than Home Town."
""
""
""
"I really like this beer. Startlingly refreshing, crisp, clean. Spiciness is delicate, pleasant, but could be a bit higher. Just an all-around good pilsener."
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the stronger entries in this style class that I've tried. New Glarus does it again!"
"Overall: A very good all around take on a Germain style Pilsener. Good bready malts with a nice soft fruit kick and hop spice."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid pilsener, always a fan of these easy drinking and tasty lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours medium dark amber with 1/4 inch white foam. Almost see through. Very light malt smell - like a an ale trying to fight through the lager. Maybe mild corn too. Very mild light flavor, with a light hop. Everything in moderation. Flavorful lager, simple."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a crystal clear lighter amber color. There was a small off-white head that didn’t linger long at all. Just a little lacing. The aroma is nice: a little musty, bready, malts and biscuits. The taste is pretty good. Bready, some malts, touch of bitterness and dryness. Another good beer from them!"
"O- Pilsener's aren't my favorite beer in the world, but this one was very well done for the style. For the style there was a decent amount of flavor and aroma and is much better then most of the mass-produced pilseners that tend to dominate the style. If you like lagers I definitely recommend trying this out, but not going out of your way to seek it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours golden with a solid sheet of fine white foam, a little dark for the style. Smells of apple, grain, crsytal malt, some sweet corn and some bits of bitter, noble hops. Taste is smooth with some apple juice, some metal, some grain and bits of white grape juice over hay and standard lager flavors. Thin with low carb and a semi dry yet wet finish. An okay beer, very drinkable but lacks the assertiveness and lightness a fine pilsner should have. This is a lager, but not a pilsner."
""
"O – This is a really tasty pilsner, but I’m not sure how well it fits the German pilsner mold. Good German pilsners are very pale and have a touch of grainy malts, but most of the taste and mouthfeel is dominated by bitter hops. This particular beer, as evidenced by the color, has a much stronger malt presence than is indicated. Don’t get me wrong – it’s still a really good and drinkable beer. However, I think it would fit better in the Bohemian pilsner category. After checking New Glarus’ website, I can’t fault them on trueness to style (even on the appearance) since they list the beer as a “classic country lager.” The “German pilsner” is probably just the BA category that it happened to be boxed into. Regardless of any of that nonsense, this is a solid pilsner. Nice job, New Glarus."
""
""
"Everything I look for in a great Pils."
""
"Notes: Really enjoyable, albeit different pilsener. Darker and slightly different flavors than what I expected. Hop profile is dead on and very tasty (also the hops have a significant presence/bite here). Really enjoyable and easy to drink beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wasn't sure what to make of this lager at first but the label and description get the taste buds going. Thanks to Dave for bringing this down in the sampler pack. New Glarus made another stellar beer."
""
""
""
""
"Crazy good malts and a deft use of noble hopping. Drinks like a champ. Do they have enough summer in Wisconsin to drink this many delicious summer/lawnmower beers? Who cares! Drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice malty, and light treat. I like the caramel and the complexity of this one. I would certainly have this stocked in my fridge if I could get it easily."
""
"O - The munich malts in this beer reminded me much more of a German Oktoberfest. The color through me off a bit also. The cinnamon I perceive gives the beer complexity yet nowhere near stole the show. The beer tasted fantastic but I find it difficult categorizing the creative twists this offers. I scored the beer well because I recognize this beer is intentionally brewed out of style and I appreciate the craft exemplified."
""
"D - Very easy drink; pleasant roasted malt taste; a fantastic lager experience"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great german lager, not boring at all. Wonderful option here from New glarus for a hot summer day that you are out being active. You can tell that Dan Carey learned how to brew in Germany."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is solid and enjoyable. Drinks well."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Medium mouthfeel, kinda grassy tasting with emphasis on malt. Also finishes a tad on the sour side."
""
""
"Smells plain. Slight grassy, earthy notes on the nose and palate. Typical sulfur notes like most lagers. Really refreshing, better than most lagers. Not very remarkable otherwise. Not bad by any means, great summer beer."
""
""
"Overall I find this to be an exceptional lager, one of the better I've had. It's not a Pilsner, but it's not an Amber either. This is what a good lager should be. Drinkable, but with a few layers of flavor. Many lagers are very one-dimensional, but not Two Women. I'm not a huge Pilsner or even Amber Lager fan, but this one kinda changes that. I would definitely drink this one again; would love to try it on tap. Recommended to any who can get it. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is really tasty and very well made. Definitely enjoyed it a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a classic lager beer. Pretty well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I won't be returning to it, though. Not for me. I won't turn down a good ""Classic Lager", but I won't go looking for any, either. My feelings on lagers have already been made plain."
""
"Overall - An excellent tasting Pilsener. If you're ever in Wisconsin, pick this up; You will not regret it"
""
"O- A pretty nice pilsner, very drinkable, good choice for an easy drinking session beer."
""
"Much thanks to my wife for bringing me this one."
"O - Highly drinkable, fairly straightforward great summer beer."
""
""
""
"O: Very good flavor and aroma compensate for a so-so feel and look. Very refreshing and easy to drink, which hits the mark with most pilsners. Happy to have tried. And now I can say that I've had 'Two Women' on the kitchen table..."
""
"This poured out as a nice clear looking brown color with a white head on top. The head settles pretty quickly leaving behind just a thin white film on top of the beer. The smell of the beer has some typical lager aromas, some light earthy funk to it but nothing unpleasant. The taste of the beer has a really nice smooth crisp flavor. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, a little watery but has enough carbonation to keep the beer enjoyable. Overall this beer is a good Lager, for being just that it's a good brew and I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O= This is a unique beer from NG to say the least. NG does well at making average styles extraordinary and this is no exception. A German Pilsener that tastes like apple juice and is super drinkable. Drink this beer if ya can because it's tasty."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this a solid sessionable beer with enough flavor and substance to make it worth pounding down for a long time."
""
""
""
"Beer is light in body and really nice, I thoroughly enjoyed htis beer, probably the best beer I had from them all night. A great lawn mower beer with a wet finish, no graininess or aftertaste, a nice yeast palate in the midpalate and great lead off with this subtle pilsen malt sweetness. The finish is good as well. Mild hop character, could probably get away with more hops in there without making it hoppy but overall I'd have this again."
"Pours a somewhat-dark golden color with a thin white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries some bready malt and a very faint hop presence. I pegged this as a non-adjunct American lager, and was disappointed to see if called a pilsner. The hop presence in this is quite subdued, and instead there's a bit of light bready malt. Body is a bit too heavy for a pilsner without the refreshing dryness."
"This beer pours a light bodied distinct and polished bronze in clor with a half finger soapy white head. The nose is simple and malty. It features Carmel malt, perhaps Munich even, and perhaps some adjunct esque, corn aroma. Regardless, nice for a German style lager. The flavors too are malt driven. I get a lot of Munich malt and even a touch of rye esque spice. It's unique and nice for the style. It drinks light in body and has nice flavor. It's a really nice take on a darker lager. This beer would make a great gateway into craft. I'm a fan. This beer is incredibly sessionable."
"The beer is clear and golden colored with a half inch of white head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma offers grain, light fruit, malt, biscuits - smells like a German lager. A tad sweet, refreshing, highly drinkable. A fine choice for a session beer. Light in body with appropriate carbonation."
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty beer - one of the better pilseners I've ever had."
""
""
"D: Very nice, especially for style. Excellent session brew."
""
""
""
""
"It's way solid. Two Women is yet another quality addition to the large and usually very impressive New Glarus roster. I like when they get more experimental than this, but they also do sessionable, traditional beers the right way 99% of the time."
""
""
""
""
"Yet again NG delivers on a traditional style. I wish the hop bite were a little crisper at the end, but still a good example that lighter beers can have flavor too."
""
"It is pleasant-tasting enough that you can almost not notice that you have drank 10 of them in just about an hour’s time. I imagine if you are a big lager fan then this one would hit the spot nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a crystal clear amber with nice head. Aroma of toasted bread with some floral-ness from Hallertau hops. Well balanced flavor of malt complexity toasted grain with a hint of sweetness from the malt. Just enough bitterness to balance. Very smooth, a great session beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, the beer gave a generous white head on top of its gold color. A mild aroma was present which would best be described as malty. The initial taste was slightly hoppy with a smooth but slight wheat flavor. Made in the style of a pilsener, there is not going to be anything to knock the socks off of most beer drinkers aside from the smoothness. It is a gateway type beer for non-craft beer drinking. It is certainly better than a macro. The middle of the road feeling I get from this beer makes me miss New Glarus Stone Soup."
"overall: honestly, im not a huge fan of pilsener styles, but i can recognize quality when i come across it. this is a great brew and a solid choice at any time. goes down very easy, but enough flavor to satisfy. another great one by NG!"

"This beer has been growing on me since I first tried it in a sampler pack a few months ago. Definitely one of the best traditional pilseners I've ever had. It's amusing to take a drink of Miller Lite and follow it with this, by the way. Interestingly enough, I've also found that a good many steady BMC drinkers really enjoy this beer, so you might think of buying your non-craft-drinking buddy a sixer of this sometime."
""
"They should put this in six packs and make it a year round offering."
"O-well balanced with good flavor and easy to drink"
""
"O - overall, it's a good anytime beer. not quite sure the abv on this one, but i'd be careful since it seems easy to drink this one down fast and easy"
"Notes: Fuller in body for the style with yet a very lively mouthfeel. The balance of hops and malt is unlike any lager I have ever had. This is a session brew for all seasons. An extremely well-made brew from the folks at New Glarus. Each sip has me wanting more."

"Toasted malt up front. Sweetish, biscuity bread malt settles in. Moderately bitter, grassy, noble hops blend in smoothly. Hint of honey near the clean, crisp finish. Lingering vegetal hops and biscuit malt. Moderate body, with a nice, crisp feel. A very well-made, easy drinking lager."
""
""
"O: The flavor on this one is stunningly good. Very easy drinker and a far better than average beer."
""
""
"The bottle of Two Women Lager pours a very dark golden to copper color with a big cap of foam. The aroma is a nice mixture of malts, like a basket of bread. A little metallic twinge is mixed in. The beer is smooth, but still light on the palate. The bread malt mixes with a hint of caramel to produce a very pleasant flavor. I really enjoy the way that the different malts in this beer combine to produce grainy flavors. The bitter, earthy hops at the end provide just the right amount of balance to the malt. Another well made beer from the folks in Wisconsin."

"golden hay color with a huge head of nearly three inches that never seems to let itself go down coating the sides with some nice lacing and tons of carbonation. Aroma is light grains, bready notes, hints of l;ight clove maybe and a touch of some earthy grass notes. Nothing crazy but it does the job. Very light and clean flavor, crisp, refreshing nothing out the ordinary in any way. Was easy to throw down with a clean and refreshing aftertast"

"Overall: A very good lager (an easy style to make poorly), with a perfect balance of tasty malts and earthy hops (and neither overpower the other). Will definitely drink this one again...would be a perfect session beer, from the bottle or on tap. Another New Glarus winner!"
"A buddy brought home a bunch of samples from New Glarus. The Two Women Lager poured a golden color with decent white head that formed a slight lacing as the beverage was consumed. The smell was slightly fruity and pleasing though not a pilsner like aroma. The taste was had some hop flavor balance with the malt. The mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation. I would drink this beer again."
"This was one I had never had from New Glarus but I had the chance tonight. I was a at a supper club for a gathering and generally a place like this is only going to have your typical macro brews. I asked if they had anything else from New Glarus other than Spotted Cow and the bartender gave me this. I proceeded to have 4 of them and although I was in a setting where I didn't get to analyze it too much, it was good enough that I kept having more and it seemed to go down rather easy. It goes under the category of ""A beer that you can pound a lot of"" which means it is good but it is not some epic beer that I would save only for special occasions."
"O- New Glarus doesn't make a bad beer imo. This is no different. 4.0 is good...and this is a good all around beer."
"O: seems to represent the style well, but the grain profile is a little off putting to me, the slight sourness seems a little off"
"An awesome lager. Get some if you're in or going through Wisconsin. I always stop and grab something from the New Glarus people every time I'm in the state, and this one is another that makes it worth it."
"Great lager, from Riley's in Madison. Generous retained head on noticeable yellow. Smooth mouthfeel, something I could drink lots of. Light toast, hint of citrus lemon and lime. Mild but noticeable bitterness.Simple and nicely executed.Floral aroma."
"This is one of the best lagers I ever had. Another winner from New Glarus."
"Poured a light brown color that was still fairly clear. Had a fluffy white head that diminished gradually. I picked up scents of malts and yeast. The taste was malty with a little bit of spice and a little bit of citrus. Had a smooth taste that ended with a crisp, dry finsh. Another fan favorite from New Glarus. I just wish the beer coming out of the tap was a little colder."
"overall it was not very good and I was quite excited to finish and move on."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Troegs pint glass. This beer pours a golden amber with a big 3 inch cap that leaves just a bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. After about a minute, a good half a inch of head is still sticking around and does so for the entirety of the pull. The aroma is fairly complex for a pilsener. Candy apples mixed with caramel and toasted bread. Nice yeasty esters. Malt backbone is pretty prevalent with just a bit of earthy hops. The flavor tells you that this is a pretty malty lager. Caramel apples with toasted bread and yeasty biscuits. Underlying the malt is just a hint of earthy hops. Very clean and straightforward. Really tasty. The mouthfeel is clean and dry with a medium carbonation. This is a great lager by a great brewery. Definitely wish I could get this year round."
"Not as easy to drink as a less sweet pilsener. Still well crafted and a very good example. One of the better New World attempts at the style."
"BA lists this as a pilsner but there is less brightness and more depth of flavor than is typically found in this style. The beer pours beautifully but has a muted scent. I would call this closer to a marzen than a pilsner. Definitely worth a try."
"This might have faded a bit in the 3 months I've had it in the fridge but still refreshing, balanced flavor. Not the best example of the style of I've had but I'd certainly enjoy another bottle."
"Two Women Lager pours a dark golden color, with little head, but the head stayed throughout the beer. The smell was just slightly hoppy, and a bit strawery. The taste had a bit of hops in it, and a bit of spices, maybe a little citrus as well. Easy to drink, good flavor and carbonation, would deffently go for some more. Overall this is a great pils, very enjoyable."
"Two Women pours very clear, with slight bubble action and very little head. This is a nice caramel color beer. This beer is very crisp and clean, with a smooth aftertaste and mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good offering from New Glarus and is worthy of your time."
"New Glarus Two Women really gets the job done for a German Pilsener."
"D/O: While some features of this beer raise questions, it comes across as fairly composed when considered as a whole. Flavors fail to uplift the experience, appearing too predictable and even unaccomplished. The texture provides the biggest surprise, showing more resistance than one might expect from the style--which is also not helped by the lack of effervescence. As for the style classification, its position here as a Bavarian pilsner does the beer no favors. It seems like a decent Munich-style helles, but only the most mediocre of pilsners."
"O- Pils are nowhere near my favorite types of beers, but this one really does the style justice. A nice refreshing example that tastes damn fine as well."
"This was another one my dad was pushing on my from New Glarus. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but pretty generic in taste. Nothing I could pull out and distinguish. It simply tasted like beer. If this is in the fridge I'd have it again but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."
"Sometimes when you do something right, it's like you did nothing at al, I suppose."
"Overall this is certainly an A quality beer and, as usual, New Glarus rocks everything I try from them. Makes me want to move to Wisconsin so I can drink their beers all the time."
"A great beer to have available year around."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The was about a half inch of foam that formed a slight lacing as the beverage was consumed. The smell was slightly fruity and pleasing though not a pilsner like aroma. The taste was had some hop flavor balance with the malt. I would drink this beer again."
"Feels more like a red layer than a pilsner. As a pilsner its not good...take away the style category and its quite lovely. (Also my dog really likes it...shared a ""SIP"" of a few different beers with her and she really liked this one. Good girl.)"
"Excellent, excellent beer. I wish I had bought more than one!"
"Overall: Without a doubt the malt used for this brew helped make it a stellar lager. Wow ..."
"I recently got more into lagers which has been hit or miss. I like the smell of this it very fruit like melon and Hallertau Mittelfruh Hops bring out the best of this malt. the taste is bit light although not too watery or syrupy. very smooth and highly drinkable so it hits that sweet spot. Best lager I have had in awhile."
"Pours out translucent amber in color with a tiny froth for a head, no lacing, very disappointed in the lack of carbonation but every thing else about appearance looks fine. Lighter side of medium bodied, nice and crisp texture. Smells of strong biscuit malts, lager style, and floral / earth hops. Tastes of the same but also includes grassy hop notes and a medium bittering back kick which I would estimate at about half the bitterness of a normal Pilsener. Not the most complex NG offering I've ever had, but than again it seems to be another of their lineup that sticks to the basics and do the simple things as well as possible. Nice balance of sweet and bitter, but I just wish there was a bit more pizazz. A sturdy and solid workhorse, very sessionable."
"This is by far the best session beer i've ever had. Refreshing, crisp, clean and it also pairs well with many foods. i love this beer! thank you Dan Carey! It takes a lot of guts to do a beer like this because if you don't do it well there's nowhere for the negatives to hide. This beer is a winner through and through, grab one whenever you can."
"D - I've enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. A particularly sessionable brew in my opinion...I'll be stocking this in my fridge in the future. A brew that makes me glad I live in Wisconsin!"
"o - overall, i'm not the biggest fan of german pilsners, however there are a few i've had that blew me away. this is not one of them. if you are trying to baby step someone off BMC this might be a good choice into exploring other beers, but i imagine your buddy will say ""it tastes the same, why spend more?"" since it does pretty much appear to be the craft version of BMC. kind of surprised this one has the grade it has."
"Drinkability: Is it a pilsner? A lager? Neither. It is a tasty hybrid adding to my eagerness to make a return to trip to New Glarus."
"O) A nice pilsener. I'd have another."
"O -- I'm giving this a 5 overall because it's such a fresh, beautiful take on a true European lager and comes across as so because of no Pasteurization (I'm deducing). While not a Pilsner to my palate, and NG calls this a ""Country Lager," it's a darn good Oktoberfest. Year round beer too -- even better!"
"This beer pours a dark bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of toast, hints of light toffee, and a splash of spicy noble hops. The taste is very well balanced with a bunch of toasty malt, and ample hops. There is also a very faint metallic note in the background that adds to the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture and fairly high carbonation. Overall, this is a really good pilsener that I will surely drink again when the opportunity presents itself."
"Palate mirrors the aroma, though it's a bit less sweet than the nose implies, though still plenty malty. Crusty bread and caramel, dark fruit, faint sulfur from the yeast. Medium bodied, fairly hefty for a 5% ABV lager. Clean, malty finish, not much bitterness or bite. Enjoyable stuff, but not my favorite New Glarus lager. I recall liking it more from the large format bottle, though it seems like a different beer now."
"O: A really clean and delicious lager. Great stuff."
"Overall -- Another exceptional lager from New Glarus, the titans of easy-drinking beer. While I'm not usually a lager person, I really enjoyed this."
"O- A fantastic all around session beer when you don't want to sacrifice substance for drinkabliity."
"o - nice session lager and one i hope to try again."
"To my mind, this year-round bottled version of the R & D beer is a little bit different than the original; A little bit darker in color and a just little bit sweeter, and overall it's slightly better than average for the style. Of course, there are some very impressive (and authentic) renditions of the Pilsener style out there from the Craft brewers these days, so this is by no means an 'average' American beer in this respect. Rather, 'better than average' for a German-style Pilsener is a *very good* thing to my mind."
"O. I didn't have very high expectations for this beer but it easily exceeded them. I don't mind a lager every so often, say once a month, but Two Women is something I wouldn't mind drinking all the time, especially during the summer. NG has crafted a great beer here - kudos."
"Drinkable by the gallons and a near masterpiece for some Summer Pilsener drinkin'! New Glarus has a big time keeper with this stuff!"
"D: Highly drinkable, though maybe the to-style carbonation is too much for me to have to many."
"Overall: it is a very good easy drinking beer for this summer. It's well balanced and put together very well. A German Pils it is not, but as a Dark American Lager this thing is outstanding. I rather like the malt profile. While I personally would like a touch more bitterness to finish this beer out, the hops does it's job. I like it."
"Flavor speaks to the Pilsener style with an easy-drinking body and flavorful malt bill that suggests nutty toffee, toasted pilsner malt, and bread crust. Hops are floral and spicy with a nice balance of bitterness. Mouthfeel pops with carbonation while the medium-light body finishes clean and dry with a crisp bite. Overall, Two Women is a solid example of a Pilsner and yet another case of New Glarus dominating the less popular beer styles. Looking forward to my other bottle."
"O - I just honestly couldn't get into this beer. I don't doubt it is decent, but maybe I just got a bad batch or something. Also, I hold New Glarus to a very high standard, and they usually deliver, so it may just be a tough grading."
"I can see how some would love this beer, and I did appreciate some of the flavor complexity, but I'm personally not a fan of the grassy herbal tea notes. I will be spending most of my free time searching out some more of their exquisite IIPA."
"Thanks to FrankenBrew for sending this one my way. Although I wouldn't pursue it (due to the number of great Colorado beers available to me) I really enjoyed it. Poured a nice golden color with a good white head. Aromas of sweet malt, honey and biscuit. On the palate, this one is light bodied, crisp and refreshing, with flavors of sweet malt and honey."
"Poured into the trusty ol' shaker glass. Poured a clear amber/gold color with a creamy white head that quickly disapated. All I got on the nose was sweet malt. Taste was sweet malt, a touch of honey, and a touch of lemon with no bitterness whatsoever. Mouthfeel was pretty thin; unless it was a hot day back in the midwest, I doubt I'd pursue this one again."
"O=The best lager that I've had in a long time. I'm not a huge fan of New Glarus beers, but this is enjoyable, especially between Spring and Autumn."
"O) This is an excellent offering from New Glarus. I have scooped up several six packs, and have savored each bottle."
"""Two Women"" finds a way to be both full flavored and refreshing."
"Over all I think this is one of those beers that get better after you have 2 or more of them. Very good anytime beer"
"Pours a clear amber to deep gold. A solid pour forms a dense rocky head that leaves a significant amount of lace behind with each gulp. I say gulp because this is a very quaffable beer. The aroma is quite simple; fresh malt and maybe some grass hops. The taste reminds me quite a bit of Bohemian lager more than a German Pilsener, something perhaps like a Czechvar...but upon further reflection it is also reminds me of a Wurzburger Pils which I suppose is what the brewer is really trying to emulate. A touch of caramel malt, some toasted malt, some very fresh (almost worty) malt flavor is present here with a touch of bubblegum and mild graininess. Maybe I just worked extra hard today, this is very quaffable, with the right amount of hops to make me wish I picked up a case of this stuff."
"I've had this a couple times now and the first time I thought this was incredible...this time I'd say just good. I've been critical of NG dumbing down their beers in some cases but beers like this that are well made and sessionable will always have a place in my fridge...watered down crap like Back 40 and the Honey Bock will not."
"D: Could go back to back with this in a comfortable setting, contemplating the beauty, power and wonder of women."
"Medium+ bodied with a carbonation that fades fairly quickly. It's by no means heavy or cloying, but it lacks a bit of crispness and drinkability for the style. It's a bit like Staghorn's skinnier little brother. And that's not a bad thing."
"of course, now that's not an r&d beer with the attendant exclusivity and whatnot, and given that it's an untrendy sort of lager, it will probably take a dip toward 3.7 land despite the base of NG hype. it deserves more. it--they--deserve to be appreciated, held, cared for ... loved. suddenly i have the urge to befriend two solid german women who know what's up."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a light orange color very clear and transparent with active carbonation present however not too big of a clean white head. The aroma is soft and subtle of quality malt slightly roasted. There is not much more than a mild hint of citrus from hops. The taste is crisp and clean with a good malt body and a nice nutty after taste. No real hop presence to speak of. The carbonation is mild and the body is light to medium. This is a good sipping brew. I prefer the Czech pilsner myself, but this is a solid brew."
"O: I swear the previous recipe was slightly different, but I have no notes and no proof. Either way, this is fantastic, as Dan Carey's German styles always seem to be."
" ~ I'm fairly certain my review up to this point has been pretty self-explainatory. This is a very well crafted German Pilsner... for that matter its just a great beer."
"Overall, this is what I want in an American Pils. It isn't watered down, it isn't too sweet, and it isn't boring. Good job, New Glarus."
"12oz. bottle courtesy of k2pantan. Served in my SA Noble Pils glass. Pours a translucent copper with a loose, one inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap. Some lacing but no legs. Nose expresses noble hops and a grassy character. Taste consistent with nose; however, it's a bit more watery than I anticipated. There's also a trace of citric acid in the mix. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a slight acidity and a fairly clean finish. All and all a very drinkable, style consistent German Pils. Definitely one of the better domestic tributes to the style I've tried to date."
"Overall a very nice german pils. However, starts to fall apart toward the middle to end of the glass, as it warms up."
"GET THIS LAGER; GOOD TIMES!"
"Soft, light body with medium carbonation. Very refreshing."
"D - I should have saved this guy for a hot day, but I thought it would go well with my salmon, which it did. New Glarus does another fine take on a lager with this one. I wish I could get their lighter beers down here for when the summer rolls around."
"Overall, a nice, pleasant, easy drinking pils."
"The grain and bready yeast character comes through strong in the taste, very smooth and a little sweet, just excellent. Some bitterness in the aftertaste, but it feels proper to me. Medium-medium plus body, full filling while still going down quickly. I loved this beer."
"Original 500mL bottle score 4/4/4.5/4.5/5"
"O: I don't usually drink lagers but this one is pretty good. If this were on shelves here I would be buying this before the other lagers available here."
"O- a classic easy drinking german lager ..only comment i would like a little more noble hop taste to this one..but still quite tasty"
"reminds me of a less skunky Heineken. Malt forward and very easy to drink. Got the 6 pack on my way back home from Madison. I would recommend this to anyone that appreciates true to style beer."
"Poured clear dark amber into a pint glass. Nice white head that dissipates to a film with a thick ring. I get no commentable smell. There's something there but it's faint. Taste is malt, a little bitterness with a little honey at the finish. Clean crisp and easy to drink."
"Poured a cloudy brownish golden color with a good amount of fluffy white head on it. Smells malty/grainy. Taste is nice and light. Good flavor on this beer, malty throughout. This is a very sessionable beer - I could definitely put down at least a 12 pack of these babies. Very good beer overall. Another quality product from New Glarus."
"Wasn't what I was expecting (a crisp slightly hoppy lager) but good regardless. Approve of their experimentation!"
"Well rounded and easy drinking. Not sure how to rate a ""country lager," but BA certainly has it categorized wrongly as a German Pils, so hopefully people consider that when reviewing. THIS IS NOT A GERMAN PILS!"
"Very nice Pils, I would buy it again."
"Overall this is an extremely drinkable beer. I had this when it was an R&D beer at the brewery in October and was shocked. I am not a fan of this type of beer normally but this is really very good. I'm glad they decided to distribute this beer."
"Drinkability: Incredibly easy to sip on. If this wasn't a brewery only beer it might end up in my crate more often."
"overall nicely done and very drinkable."
"4/4/4/4.5/4.5"
"In terms of mouthfeel, there is a nice medium carbonation and light body - this drinks just like one would expect a handcrafted lager from a brewery like New Glarus to drink. A nice, clean aftertaste with a mildly bitter peak ends the taste on a positive note. Very drinkable, clean and enjoyable. This was a nice change of pace and could be a perfect gateway craft lager for a BMC drinker."
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of cereal and grain taste is very particular and enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by clean cereal and grain notes with a light vegetable note. This is a though one to judge as it is not a style that I have easy access to. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Refreshing and well brewed with a different malt bill then I am used to with limited use of hops."
"Pours a deep golden color with a big white head that leaves a good lace. The aroma is pretty gosh darned faint but it's got some complexity. Some fresh cut grass some citrus and a good clean malty character. As it warms alcohol is very apparent and kind of annoying. The flavor is nice but it's also just kind of faint all together. There is a nice soft hoppiness but the flavor is pretty hop driven (despite the softness there of) There is plenty of fruitiness and some light alcohol and honey with some citrus rind. This is nice but I like Yokel, Cabin Fever, Edel Pils, Bohemian Lager, & home town much more. I've got a few other bottles, if this merits a re-rate I'd be happy to do that."
"Drinkability:For a pilsner, this one is very pleasant. It's pretty true to style, except for being a little sweeter than normal. The sweetness is not cloying, so this beer is certainly sessionable."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth is pretty full for a Pilsner. Good carbonation level. Refreshing finish. Flavors full of lemon, breads, grassy hops, and a fresh clean zip on the back end. Pretty lively beer here. This is perfectly drinkable. I wish I had more. Refreshing, tasty, satisfying. Great beer."
"D-Pretty easy drinking rich and flavorful lager. I'm glad I got to try it, but the availability and price point make me seriously doubt that I would search it out again."
"Easy drinker, good and middle feel, could have this any day."
"Drinkability is stellar as well. Not much to say; Unplugged Bohemian Lager is one of the best lagers I've ever tasted, and this absolutely holds true to that experience. Brilliant beer."
"I'm sure that this is very drinkable, at least according to style. I love New Glarus, but I'm not a huge fan of pilsners, in general. I had hopes that this might be the one for me. Alas...it is not."
"Very nice and flavorful for a lager and amazingly drinkable. I would definitely try this one again..."
"Clear golden yellow body. Bubbly white head. Lacing is quite full. Great hop aroma. Love the Mittelfrueh. Crisp and flowery. Biscuity malt nose blends in nicely. Flavor is very smooth and balanced. This is really holding up well with age. Crisp, crackery and biscuity malt base. Flowery hops balance everything out nicely. Nice accents of hay as well. Herbal and eathry. Body is medium full. Moderate carbaonation. Very good pilsener."
"The grain character of this beer in the nose is exceedingly exquisite and something I can't get enough of; I really can't shake that freshly griddled, white corn tortilla comparison, it seems so apt somehow and so appetizing. Sometimes even a Lager can be quite sublime, this has to be at least a bit past its prime and it is still quite fantastic."
"This is my least favorite style of beer. I did enjoy this more than others I've had. Well worth the purchase."
"Very nice lager from NG. Would love to try this super fresh, but still enjoyable with a little age. It would be nice to see this added to their regular lineup."
"D/O- This one is refreshing. it just goes does smooth, plain and simple. This is a hard style to separate yourself from the rest and New Glarus gives us it's best interpretation of it. A real treat after a hard days work."
"D: A good overall brew, for the style this is the up most perfection."
"MF/D: a very smooth lager that leaves the palate wanting more following each sip, certainly a sessionable 8% abv."
"The palate opens with a delicate hop character, with the aromas I picked up on the nose all being represented. Mostly hay-like with some wet earth, the hop character segues into the very rustic malt character. While this beer has a very light body, it isn't lacking for malt flavors - the raw grain, graham cracker and light toast bring to my mind what was (IMO) Dan's best beer, the Unplugged Bohemian Lager. Very, very clean, there are no off-flavors here. Again, despite being light, there's enough flavor to tingle every tastebud, making this seem about as far from watery as you can get. Carbonation is medium-light, lower than I'm used to but sufficient. The finish is long and delicate, with the lemon characteristics appearing along with the earthy and grassy flavors lingering a long, long time. This is on par with the Victory Braumeister Pils in terms of quality. Exceptional stuff."
"Not a lot else here. I cannot say I am a fan of pilsners, but this one is a bit more boring than the average."
"Overall a nice easy drinking lager."
"This was a pretty good pils but I suppose I am spoiled living in PA where there are so many good ones available. A solid beer nonetheless, and if it were part of their regular lineup and I lived within their distribution area I'd grab it on occasion."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with creamy carbonation. Overall it's just really refreshing and a pleasure to drink. I could drink a large amount of this very easily with a smile on my face. I know the ingredients and process for this one were a bit more expensive, but it would be a joy to have in six packs. A really well done lager."
"(D)- A solid brew fitting the style it is under. Crisp and refreshing. A solid one for this time of the year."
"New Glarus Two Brothers is a wonderful German Pilsener, and is up there with the best of the very best. Highly recommended; please buy some as this is a style that does not get enough respect. A stupendous hot weather beer. I want more."
"A good German pilsner, though as someone who much prefers an all Saaz Bohemian pilsner not something I would pick up regularly in the shop."
"D - I haven't drank a beer this fast in I don't know how long..."
"Very drinkable and good for the style. This is a solid beer, although it's pretty much doomed to bad ratings given the style."
"d - A pretty nice pilsener. Has a pretty standard pilsener smell and taste, would give another shot."
"I was surprised by the Two Women Lager. It really doesn't seem like the type of beer you would typically find sold in individual pint sized bottles. It seems like a beer that could easily be sold in a traditional six-pack. That being said, Two Women is a very good German Pilsener. If you enjoy typical German Pilseners, I highly recommend trying this."
"A beautiful German lager bier. Crisp and refreshing, with an excellent hop profile. In a sea of ales, this style is often dismissed; what some call insipid and overt simplicity, I call nuanced and restrained complexity. I applaud New Glarus for creating another finely crafted lager. Please make more..."
"M: very good mouthfeel"
"D - I only bought one bottle of this. What a dope! i shoulda bought a case of this. Amazingly drinkable beer."
"This was a great take on a Pils, with crisp full flavor and a super easy drinking body. I could down bottles of this all summer long. New Glarus rocked this one!"
"I could drink bottles of this all summer long. This might be one of the best craft ""lawnmower"" beers I've ever had. It really doesn't get much better than this!"
"Overall, a very solid pils. This one is very drinkable. Lots of good thing going on for the style."
"Overall I'm not a fan of this style but I could easily down a few of these on a hot day."
"What makes for a full-bodied and highly flavorful pilsner also makes for a good, yet common, Vienna lager."
"Overall, another very good beer from this top-notch brewery."
"D - Seems like a watered down version of Bohemian. Still tasty but I would prefer the other."
"They now sell it at discount for a more reasonable 5.99 and it will soon come in 6 packs for about 7$."
"D - This is a very good session brew, that was highly appreciated while sitting out on beach chairs on a warm summer day. The only real problem is that you have to go to the brewery to get it - and that it's not as good as the Bohemian Lager."
"Drinkability - Certainly not a bad example of a Bavarian pilsener, but nothing world-changing. Exclusivity of the beer makes it a little more fun."
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is high. Drinkability is good, it was a very good tasting beer. It was very well balanced with some great flavors which definitely aid in the drinkability. It isn't my favorite style and it didn't have a ton of extreme flavors, but it was just a very well made beer and version of the style."
"d: the definition of drinkable...at it's best, pilsner is one of my favorite styles out there - the craftsmanship required to excel in this arena is impressive, and NG has pulled out some of the best domestic examples to be found"
"D: This has got to be the definition of drinkability. So easy to get down with a taste that's just complex enough to keep my interest through all 16 ounces. Goes down super easy and is incredibly refreshing. I feel like I could drink gallons of this stuff on a hot summer day. Definitely another winner from New Glarus."
"New Glarus hits again. I would get this all the time if it were in 6pks for $9 or so. Thanks for the chance!"
"Very drinkable beer, New Glarus sure knows how to brew!"
"I bought a few bottles last week at the brewery on the recommendation of the workers. I hate to say but for the price, it was remarkably forgetable. The smell is nice and malty. The color is average, but a little too MGDish, and there is nothing that stands out in the taste. I didn't dislike the beer, but I wouldn't purchase it again. For the price, there are many other lagers that are better. This beer would appeal to the masses...someone without an experience palate."
"Drinkability- Like I mentioned in my review of the smell, this isn't necessarily my favorite style but I do appreciate it. I don't really like Noble Hops all that much and this brew if full of them. It is really drinkable though as its crisp and refreshing. If you like this style, you'll love this one."
"Paired nicely with some Muenster."
"drinkability: high"
"overall - a good clean beer. this will be great to drink over the summer."
