Crisp, malty aroma has an overtone of apple, rather like a nice dry cider. Malty flavor is crisp, like a pils ought to be, with more than a hint of apple, just slightly sweet.. Texture has average body and fizz. A refreshing one. Happy Oktoberfest!","Cyberkedi","Jan 07, 2015"

3.62,-2.7,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"O-This brew is a decent example of a German Pils. As noted above, it packs a bit too much dry malt flavor that mostly overwhelms any suggestion of hops. The taste is so dry that it verges on metallic and grainy, and while that is sort-of what I expect from a German Pils, a little more hop balance or sweetness would go a long way here.","spoony","Aug 25, 2013"

Lacing is left on the glass as you drink this and a little lacing is retained at the top well into the consumption of this beer. The aroma is of lightly toasted barley malt and it is also grassy and a little sweet. The taste is bready and slightly sweet, with some hop bite. Obviously some of the hop character and other flavors have likely diminished due to the age of this beer, but I can still taste the distinctive characteristics I would expect from this beer. The mouthfeel is light and this is well carbonated. It's crisp and very drinkable. This is very easy to gulp down. This is a pleasing pilsner that I could enjoy on a summer day.

Some hop flavor (grassy) comes through at mid-palate and rides into the finish. Light apples come from the grains, and spices from the yeast give enough roundness and variety to keep the beer from becomming dull.

I've been a fan of this brewer for many years, especially of Salvator and the Hefe-weiss. But whereas Salvator is a great, beefy ""winter-y"" beer, the pils is the perfect compliment to a warm summer day. If you like the Hefe, I'd definitely say you'd wanna give the pils a fair shake.

The hops persuasion is excellent, mild bitterness with pleasant herbalness, a hint of spice, and a note of grass minuscule maltiness trails.

Feels crisp and clean, with an excellent blend of bitter and sweet in the finish. Pilsner isn't my favorite style, but I could definitely enjoy one or two of these now and again.

The body is medium with a very fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor is more hoppy than the aroma indicates with a firm bitterness and floral/grassy hop flavor.
