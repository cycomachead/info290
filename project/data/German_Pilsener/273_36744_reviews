"Decent beer, more like a pale but you can feel the Pilsner in the finish. It is different enough to get a second try in my pils rotation."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, corn-yellow coloring with a ton of slow carbonation in the body, and a fluffy, dense, small bubbled, white head. Aromas of citrus sweet, bubblegum, toasted grains, subtle herbal notes, and some nutmeg and clove spice. Flavors are sweet and herbal forward, with a subtle cracker and bread backbone, and lemongrass, clove, and all-spice highlights, with subtle tart citrus characteristics. The herbal tones overpower a bit, and there is subtle hops bitterness that enhances that imbalance. Light, effervesced body, that moves close to astringent as the beer leaves your palate. The aftertaste is lemon-citrus and heavy spice, still. Dry, again almost astringent, finish."

"O-Everything was there for me but the taste didn't seem to correlate with the other features. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"And with that full golden haze, one thing's for sure- Sweetwater isn't about to over filter the beer for eye appeal when the removal of its cloudiness would also remove flavor. After all, taste appeal wins in the end!"
""
""
""
"This beer is a good beer. It has a sweetness taste to it. You can tell it is a pilsner. The golden color it has is a great look. I like the sweetness to this beer. It does not have an after taste like some beers have. It go`s down smooth. It does not have an after taste like some beers have. I liked this beer, I know that I would not mind having it again."
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, strong pale malt, hint of wheat, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a German Pilsner. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, strong pale malt, slight wheat, and a hint of hop. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma and decent body."

"Overall, not at all what I expected but still a good brew. Bottle says it started as a pilsner but ale yeast was added as a spare. Sounds like an experiment that went right."
""
"O - decent enough, well made, if unspectacular."
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad Pils but nothing I would seek out on my own."

"O: Pilsners are not my favorite style, and this one is probably an average pilsner. Glad I tried it once but would probably not buy again."

"Poured into a glass,it has a golden color body with a small head to it. The aroma has that pil smell of floral/corn to it. The taste has a sweet maltyness to it with some spice to it. The mouthfeel is nice, very drinkable and overall a really good take on mixing styles."

"O- A very straightforward and simple, yet impressive pils."

"Ale pours a cloudy yellow with a white two finger head. Pleasant herbal hop aroma. Brisk hop forward taste balanced nicely with bready malts and a crisp aftertaste. Very refreshing, quenching summer ale. Not sure if it is a true pilsner but I enjoyed this very much."
""

""
""
""

"Overall a great summertime brew. An interesting twist on a pilsner from the brew wizards at one of my favorite breweries."

"Road Trip is a bright tasty beer. Bright citrus and spicy hops are the rulers of the roost on both smell and taste here. There's some pilsner malt that isn't quite as sharp as is typical, but the spicy hops make up for that. The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is solid - but probably not sessionable. Overall, Road Trip is a solid pilsner-style beer."
""
""
""
""

"Overall; was hoping for something crisp, refreshingly, and hoppy enough to make it interesting; this wasn't that."

"Road Trip is a nice little treat after a six mile bike ride."
"4.09/5.0"

"o: a nice if unexceptional pils, good flavor set with a nice refreshing structure"
""
"O: A nice, drinkable beer. Perfect for a day outside"
"Hoppy pils with ale yeast. Pours a slightly hazy (sediment) gold color with one finger thick fluffy white head. Smell: light pils malt sweetness, floral and spicy. Taste: spicy, grassy, lemon, biscuit. Medium body, feel is prickly into creamy. Nice quaffable pils-ish beer."

"overall not quite my cup of tea. It's more like Americanized pilsner halfway between regular ale version of a pilsner and imperial pilsner, overdone in most of the things it tried to do. Not sure how much of that is age as it seems overdone and not attenuated too much on anything, maybe hops. I'll take most of the flavors with a grain of salt as it is a bit older, but still not a great beer IMO."

"12oz bottle . Bright yellow color, fizzy, small head. Smells a little sweet oddly, bit of malts. Flavor is crisp, slightly sweet (very slight), mouthfeel is a little slick which kind if makes it less drinkable. Overall not bad but not the most refreshing pilsener and not one I would buy again, glad I got a single."

"This is a really nice and unique take on a pilsener. It isn't as ""clean"" as a lager might be but the ale yeast adds a little extra character. A perfect summer beer."
""

""
""
""

"O - Sadly Sweetwater has yet to truly impress me with any of their brews and this is no different. An average pilsener with some fair balance is all to be had here."

"This is an easy drinking, refreshing springtime beer. Great for warm day."

"O - Very drinkable decent beer while doing some yard work."
"O - Very drinkable in large amounts, a nice refreshing brew,but not to extravagent."
"This is a nice, easy drinking pilsner; perfect for the southern spring weather. It's flavorful enough to keep you interested but also light enough to be sessionable."

"O- a solid takon the style and an enjoyable brew"
"Tap: This comes closer to true pilsner territory. Crisp and grainy with a stronger noble hop character. More bitterness, more herbal and spicy bite, kept somewhat in check by a smoothish, lightly sweet body. Not an actual pilsner, but certainly a step above your typical golden/blonde ale. Good stuff."
"T: Nice"
"O- A refreshing pilsner. Well balanced and some nice citrus notes. Nothing really stands out, but a decent brew."
"It’s light and refreshing and altogether unorthodox. It’s an innovative brew that just tastes good."
"A tasty hybrid brew of sorts, good substitute of there are no authentic pilsners available."
"Overall: This beer blurs the outer boundaries of what I am familiar with for a pilsner. I like that it is different, especially since I am not as much of a pilsner fan, it mixes things up."
"O: An interesting beer - I think the ale years gives it a unique twang, but the taste was not something that would make me seek it out again."
"O - Easily a session beer which holds it's own in the Pils category. This beer doesn't take you to any extreme as it is a simple version which delivers a great balance of Hops and Malt, with whatever chemistry they used to hold the edge. IMHO, this is a very medium to light and easy drinking beer which won't let the buyer down"
"O- This beer was a very nice simple pilsner. I enjoyed the fact that they didn't overdo the hopping this which lead it to be a very clean and easy drinking beer. Sweetwater I think has a balance on making both easy drinking beers along with huge over the top beers."
"Average...a little spicy, but otherwise nothing that strays too far from your typical pils. Drinkable."
"A slight notch above your everyday pilsner. No adjunct corn sweetness and a light floral hoppiness that differentiates it. Its a pale hazy yellow with thin white head that fades fast and leaves minimal, spotty sea foam lace. The smell is crisp, dry biscuit malts with faint floral and earthy hops. The taste is dry biscuits and floral notes. Crisp, dry, and refreshing. Nicely done pilsner, but nothing that stands out."
"O: Great session beer. Nice clean and crisp. Great beer for a hot summer day."
"Overall, a good representation of a classic german pils. Very nicely done."
"O: Meh. I think it's pretty average and no real notes on taste or smell really jump out."
"Road Trip feels fine enough on the tongue, though it does nothing to distinguish itself. Overall, this is a below average pilsner, primarily because of the spurious decision to ferment the beer with ale yeast of some kind. This is a fine enough summer drink when it comes in the Sweetwater variety pack, but this is certainly nothing to seek out on its own."
"It has a slightly slick mouth. I thought it was an easy drinking representation of the style."
"O: Good solid brew here, this one is going to be a summer staple."
"O - A pretty good pilsner by sweetwater. I could drink multiple of these in the spring and summer."
"MF/O: Prickly carbonation, light in body, with a fruity and wheaty finish"
"O - Uhg. Not much here. Pretty bland."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this! Not hugely aromatic, but extremely tasty and yummy! A nice and unique German Pils!"
"M Thin body, dry, carbonation seems a little higher than a typical Pils, but good. 4"
""
"Great brew. Not as bitter as I expected. Clean finish easily could finish a 6-pack on any given day. This brew has just enough bite to keep you on your toes. Sweetwater has yet to come out with a brew IMO where you say well it is sorta like... they are all different from each other. Another great brew from the best brewery in the south. Keep them coming guys"
"This is refreshing beer. Nothing really stands out, but I could drink a couple of these in a session."
"D - It seems low ABV, and it is a fairly smooth beer. A decent 6 pack for a day on the lake, but nothing here is all that special."
"O: Very drinkable. Good malt character. Not as crisp and refreshing as many of the style. Bet this would be good with dish if wanted a relatively ""light"" beer but still wanted to cut some spice or fat/oil."
"""It started out as a pilsner"" reads the label. That may be but the end product is a decent lightly hopped pale with a slight bitterness against a light malt backbone. Sadly there wasn't much that stood out about this beer. While not ""bad," I don't know that there's anything here that makes this beer memorable. If you're looking for something that's light, crisp and easy to drink, you can't go wrong here. If I had to pick just one word to describe this beer, it would have to be ""inoffensive," and that's not always a good thing."
"SweetWater Road Trip 12oz into pint. Pours yellow, like a bit of real beer into a glass of water.. Has a small 1/4"" white head that doesnt stick around. Smells of steamed veggies and other adjuncts in the corn department. Tastes like a adjunct lager, honestly one of the lower grade ones. A touch of pale and crystal malts, and a bit of noble presence. This is another that I wont be getting again from SW, these summer creations just aren't up to par with the rest of the others. Overall, if you get it from a pal, or an extra in a trade its worth a shot, but if you see it in the store and are pondering on purchasing, your best bet is to grab whatever is sitting beside it, even if its a pack of swill in my opinion. Cheers!"
"O: This is a solid Summer beer all around."
"Got a decent head however is was pretty weak and died quickly. Coloring is light yellow that I didn't expect at first but now I see this is a pilsner thinking it was a pale ale. Smell is sweet and slightly citrusy. I always have trouble picking up what to describe the sweentess as in lagers and pilsners. I guess corn? Anyways has quite a nice pilsner smell. Taste is sharp and pleasantly bitter. Has a nice underlined sweetness in the aftertaste. Is this beer a hybrid? The label kind of suggested it was. But it really does have a pale ale quality to it. One of the more flavorful Pilsners I have encountered. Carbonation is cranked up pretty high but I actually like it in this style. This beer is solid! Hats off to Sweetwater for making such a tasty pilsner for the summer."
"Well done. Pretty good hot weather drinker."
"O: Very drinkable and a nice represenation for the style. If someone asks me to recommend an American made pilsner, this will be one that I mention."
"This is flavorful and a bit off kilter for the style, and I like it a lot. I could see banging these back on a hot summer afternoon."
"O - Just bad beer; I don’t know what else to say about it. This beer has diminished my view of Sweetwater’s standing as a brewery."
"overall i think this is a different beer from one year to the next!"
"O: Definitely not a keeper from Sweetwater although it matched pretty well with our freshly-caught trout for dinner."
"Overall, it's sort of the ""pilsner"" you'd expect from a popular american microbrewery but definitely refreshing. This will be a common purchase for me during these upcoming summer months."
"O: A nice beer, especially for the summer months. This pilsner is definitely geared more toward hop heads"
"D- Id drink again, bring it to the beach and enjoy it in the summer time for sure."
"D - This would be easy to toss back several of these especially with the hot weather this is a good summer offering in my opinion. I will surely keep this in mind for a day on the lake or some such"
"D - This was a pretty enjoyable beer it hit the spot in the Georgia summer heat has a good refreshing flavor worth trying sometime"
"Served from bottle into an Ommegang flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a two finger pure-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, wheat, and citrus. The flavor pretty much followed the nose with wheat, citrus, and subtle malt. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was not really that great, but not horrible either... I think it could have used a little more malt character to coverup some of the citrus. It was quite refreshing if that counts for anything."
"Drinkability: Flavorful yet easy drinking. A good example of what this beer could beer instead of what you often see it becoming in the world of macros."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a thick, foamy, white head. Aroma is crisp, malty and just a little bit fruity, mainly apple and banana. Flavor is mainly malty with an undertone of fruit and a bit of hop bitterness. Strongly fizzy texture leaves behind a nice tingle on the lips and tongue."
"D: As far as standard pilsners go, this one is definitely drinkable."
"A pilsner style beer with an ale yeast,hmm now thats different.Poured lighter lemony yellow with a fluffy egg shell colored one finger white head that left broken lace as it settled into a creamy mass.A mix of toasted bread dough with a bit of sweetness and iron/mineral,very pilsner-like.Flavors are crisp with that doughy character,a nice shot of herbal hop gives a nice spicy smack in the finish.A different kind of hybrid thats pretty good,I would buy again."
"Pours a clear golden, with a nice eggshell head the leaves pretty lacing. The aroma has some citrusy and floral hops upfront, along with biscuity malt, lemon zest, bread dough, and a little metallic note. The flavor is similar to the aroma with citrusy, floral and minty hops initially, along with some metallic notes, biscuit and hay, a corn syrup sweetness, and some alcohol.The mouthfeel is appropriately light and drinkability is pretty good. A tasty but strange beer, almost seems more like an American pale ale than a pilsner, but it doesn't have the esters or caramel malt character of that style. Worth trying, but probably my least favorite of Sweetwater's seasonals."
"Not impressed. Sweetwater continues to disappoint."
"Notes: At first I didn't even know this beer was a pilsner. It doesn't hop quite the hops or body of a pale ale or other hoppy ale, but it isn't a subdued pilsner. I like it though. The flavor could be a little better, but this is a good beer. Its a little different but still has that pilsner character."
" D- This beer has some nice lager qualities that keep this beer mellow and smooth with some nice fruity ale hints as well. There is a nice flavor as the beer is cool but when it warms there is a bit of the bitey sulfur and field corn that comes through."
"All around solid little offering here from Sweetwater, with a surprising bit of depth in the taste (for a Pilsner anyway). Tasty and quaffable. Perfect for summer imbibing."
"The taste is relatively sweet with a grainy malt bill. There is a nice smoothness to this beer which adds an interesting element. There's a nice sharp hop flavor as well as a slight skunk taste. It's a little bit drying on the palate. All in all not a bad beer, this may be the first middle of the road German beer I've had but I'm not sure if I'd be interested in trying this style again."
"D: Very drinkable. Perfect summer beer for anyone who does not particularly like wheat beers."
"Overall: This would be a fine aperitif, or to go with a minimally-prepared light fish dish, or perhaps a summer salad. A fine summery brew. No complaints on this one."
"Overall, nothing too special, but a bit refreshing, inoffensive and tasty."
"This didn't really seem all that imperial in my book. A decent brew, but not exactly one that seems to fit the bill for this style...kind of a one and done for me (but if someone offered it, I would most certainly not turn it down!)."
"Overall not bad, and again for a double it went down like candy, but I am not sure I would pick one up again, not really intresting enough."
"Overall a nice beer, not too exciting, but definitely could drink a few at at time-perhaps the first 'Imperial Pilsner' type that I have had. I have a few more from Sweetwater that I'll try-hopefully they are a bit more memorable."
"Very easy to drink a few."
"It's a grassy beer - a bit floral, and quite tasty. It has a hoppy bite, with nearly no fruity tones. It's almost got a brown ale sort of taste. Nice good but not great beer."
"Finally got around to this last bottle from my sixer I purchased about 6 months ago. Age has not hurt this beer at all. While I've not tried ""cellaring"" any beer, I find this bottle to have benefited from some time in my bedroom. This beer has the typical straw yellow color associated with the pilsner style. The taste is very nice with that unique grassy flavor. In my opinion, this beer is as good as Victory Prima Pilsner. Try it."
"Definitely a beer for out back by the grill in the summer. I could also see sneaking this to my non-craft friends & them enjoying it a great deal. Well-made brew."
"I was really impressed and I liked the story on how it was made on the bottle, clever...."
"The beer pours a hazy gold with a frothy bone white head that leaves a nice film and a bit of lace. The aroma is full of bready malts along with spicy and floral hops. The flavor has a subtle malty sweetness but is dominated by spicy and floral hops normally found in a German Pils. The mouthfeel sports a light-medium body with effervescent carbonation. Overall, its kind of an American Pale Ale/Blonde ale with German hops. I find it to be an enjoyable and refreshing summer seasonal with enough hop bitterness to please."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, but lacks the noble hop intensity of a true pilsener"
"Mouthfeel-Medium hop bitterness hits the tongue and finishes clean. The label says it started as a Pilsner and by golly it sure retains almost all of the charcteristics. Crisp hoppiness, clean finish. A froth on the plate releases some sweet malt flavors. The ale yeast maybe took some of the bite off this one. Very tasty, thirst-quenching, a lawnmower beer for sure. Sessionable too."
"Road Trip is a pretty well made brew but it seems to fall short in a few ways. Not really sure what they were going for exactly, but it's interesting. However, this is kind of boring for a seasonal release. Usually I like seasonals to be a bit more special and eyebrow raising. That being said, I could definitely enjoy this beer on those hot Georgia summer days like we are having now, but I won't be seeking it out."
"D - Moderate, with the 'unknown' ABV..."
"Average head dissipates down quickly, but the last bit sticks around to the end. Pale golden straw color, with a little bit of haziness. Fairly strong, sweet and grainy aroma. Initial flavor is a balance of malt and hops, with a much hoppier finish. Good flavor overall. Mouthfeel is alright, with average carbonation, and leaves a smooth mouthcoating."
"Overall this isn't that good of a beer. There are better pilsners out there, and I can't really discern the purported ale portion of the beer. Worth a try, but I wouldn't buy an entire 6 pack."
"As I said, this isn't representative of anyone's experiences, and I believe the Sweetwater dudes thought it should've laid down for a bit longer before serving it, but whatever. I totally liked it!"
"After sampling this brew a few times, I'm downgrading taste, drinkability and mouthfeel. Not too impressed. Can't get over the weird grassy flavor."
"Pours a clear, bubbly gold with a decent puffy head that dissipates quickly leaving a little bit of lacing. Smell is very grainy with some faint hop aromas in there - smells like a fairly generic pilsner to me. The taste was more of the same with grains and bit of light biscuity malts before a slightly bitter and very crisp finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a bunch of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable brew though it's a little tough to discern what they were trying to do with this one, as it doesn't seem like a double pilsner to me."
"Very nice."
"M/D: very easy to drink and a very clean beer i think the word clean can be used negatively, not in this case. its very good."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Decent flavor and undetectable alcohol make for easy consumption."
"D - the drinkability is very high for the hot summer months and if anything this beer seems like a good representation of what beer may have tasted like before prohibition and before the big boys took over with their mass produced rice beers."
"D- Best aspect of beer. It is highly drinkable on these hot ass GA days."
"D: This is a good beer, but not as drinkable as it would seem. The finish is a bit too drying/sour for me, and the body isn't quite as light as I would prefer in a beer of this style."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Expecting an ale but got more of a pale ale, just a bit more hoppy. If that is your bag (like it is mine), this a beer for you."
"OK, nothing special. Decent hopping, but not a lot else going on. Medicinal/soap tinge not a plus for me."
"This one is a cloudy yellow, with some white foam that didn't leave much lacing at all on the glass. Smelled mildly of yeast. Tasted of yeast and bitterness, and a slight touch of citrus. My palette was somewhat fried from eating jalapenos not long before drinking this, though, so there might have been more to it. At any rate, this is a solid and very drinkable beer."
"A blonde with saaz hops. Starts neutral creamy, bitterness is understated, grassy and there's a little cutrus. Mouthfeel is above average and creamy. Its sessionable, its smooth drinking beverage, and it should appeal to lots of people. Creamy cloudy yellow."
"Overall: An Imperial Pils, huh? Not like any double pils Ive ever had, but good nonetheless. A good hoppy, drinkable brew, suitable for sessions, and worth a try."
"Sweet blast of perfume malt, moves over into the quaff along with a kick of hops  more are actually needed to balance out the overly in-your-face perfume malt. Does settle down by mid-bottle and becomes much more drinkable. Quite surprising brew, covering the spectrum of taste."
"Not bad and a rather interesting concoction."
"This beer can't be classified as anything really. I'd say, if I were making a pilsener at home and ""something happened"" to it leading me to add an ale yeast and it turned out like this, I'd be pretty thrilled. Its pretty interesting, but a little tweaking needs to happen to the recipe next time."
"Poured into a mug a clear golden color with a decent white head that slowly faded. A thin lacy was visible throughout the entire beer. Smell was of citrus hops. I really enjoyed the taste of this beer. It started off smooth with a nice bite at the end. I could drink these all day, not as good as the 420 but still a solid brew."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean. ABV is not listed, but I'm guessing about a 6-7%. Very good!"
"This beer doesn't just use any old ale yeast. I am convinced it is a Belgian yeast. It has that Belgian spicy twang to it. IMO, it's brilliant. Take a pilsner grain and hop bill and throw in a Belgian pale ale yeast? Excellent twist, and thank God for something different available in Alabama right now. If it weren't for the occasional interesting beer coming out of Sweetwater or Terrapin, i'd be in the funny farm."
"Drinkable; yes, drink cold when your hot, does the job Atlanta."
"Road Trip pours crystal clear with a bright golden hue. The head is snow-white and dense and the aroma is dominated by noble hops. The hops (Saaz?) dominate the tongue as you sip this beer but do not completely overwhelm the malt. The mouth is not crisp like a pilsner but softer and creamier (I'm guessing from the ale yeast...). To call this a double pilsner is incorrect; it's what may be the world's first Imperial Cream Ale! (The extreme beer movement's next logical step...) I have a soft spot for a good cream ale so this beer is right up my alley."
"Easy to drink but the whole thing is a little out of balance."
"D-meh. I am having this after a 90 minute so I'm not too thrilled. Not bad but seems a bit out of wack."
"D - This would be easy to toss back several of these especially with the hot weather this is a good summer offering in my opinion. I will surely keep this in mind for a day on the lake or some such"
"Pours a clear straw color with a one finger head. Very mild aroma is primarily biscuits, grains, and earthy florals. Taste is very malty with grass and some hop bite. Astringency ruins the beer. A little too heavy for a summer seasonal for my taste. I didn't finish the bottle."
"Too much astringency here. It is mouth puckering and not very pleasant. I feel like I have been sucking on aspirin or Goody's headache powder. Blech! I suppose its drinkable but I wouldnt have more than about two or three in one sitting. Nice carbonation but that doesnt save this one."
"I once had a discussion with Michael Jackson (the bearded one, not the gloved one) about tasting beers stylistically vs. hedonistically. Basically the conclusion that we came to is who cares about the style? What really matters is simply how the beer tastes. Well I looked at the label for Road Trip and didn't see anything about style. I didn't bother to actually read the writing to the side that explained it, I just poured it and figured I'd figure it out. It was golden. OK. Slightly hazy. OK. Smelled a touch spicy. OK. I figured it was a witbier. But it wasn't. It was very dry. Not brashly bitter, but assertive for sure. There was a bit of fruitiness to it... kind of like grapefruit. And a subtle tartness in the background. I teetered. I kind of liked it, kind of didn't. I supposed I could take it or leave it, which basically means I'd leave it. Then I read the label, noting that it was intended as a pilsner and changed my opinion of the beer completely. I just didn't see it as a pilsner with an ale yeast. It seemed like American hops were used. Or maybe it was a bad bottle or off batch (it was within code). Hmmmm. How easily we're influenced. So, taking a step back, I can say that hedonistically I didn't really dig it. It was OK. I think it would go great at a back-yard barbeque. I might have one at a bar. But otherwise I wouldn't go for it. Just my opinion."
"d - easily quaffed and overall enjoyable. i wasn't sure what to expect from this and i've never had a double pilsner before but this was a solid sipper and one i'll go back to."
"If this truly a double pilsner, it misses the mark. But frankly, I think it is very flavorful and quite enjoyable."
"flavor is just wierd. Ale body and texture but a pilsner flavor. Is there such a thing as a bi-polar, schizophrenic beer? Malts and biscuits and something akin to wet paper. I would almost say this beer is passed its prime but the bottle says best before 9/17/07 (plus it is summer and this is the summer seasonal). hops give off a wierd sourness that is like sucking on cardboard. Ale-like body is a bit heavy for the style. Not something I would grab on a hot summer day."
"Flavor was a mild spicy hop, though no spice in particular jumped out. Finish was thirst quenching and of medium duration. Overall, this was a pretty decent beer, with a low enough ABV (5.3%) that it would be a good session beer."
"I find myself buying it repeatedly because it's unique and really works with this typical Georgia summer."
"Drinkability: This beer didn't come together for me at all. So far, these Sweetwater ""Catch & Release"" beers are 0 for 2 with me. Release! Release!!"
"By the time I finished the beer, I had forgotten about my hand."
"Road Trip is an interesting tasting beer, but it although it taste is unique it is easy to drink."
"Pours a fairly typical Pilsner dark gold with a nice initial head that fades quickly. No lacing. The smell and taste have some of that lager tanginess, but the finish on both goes in a different direction an smells more like a pale ale. A double pilsner this is not, but a pilsner with added ale yeast I could see it as. Nice heft and crispness, but a disappointing lack of hops on the finish. Refreshing, even fairly tasty, but this could have been more."
"At first, I liked this as it was different. When I purchased a six pack, it did not seem as good. The pils malt was overpowered by the saaz haops, which to me, gave it a skunky flavor. I may buy more in the future as I may have purchased from a bad batch, but if it is the same, this beer is not to my personal likings. It's not a horrible beer, in fact, this could be a decent gateway beer for Bud drinkers. It is just does not please me."
"Easy-drinking, enjoyable beer. On-tap, poured clean, light-straw colored appearance with a big, frothy head. Aroma was light and woody, with a note of hops. This was a smooth, crisp, clean tasting beer, with a mild hop presence but a good bitter sensation. Would make for a great session beer."
"Drinkability: OK going down, but the bitterness may hinder some people."
"Served in a pilsner glass, this beer is a nice clear yellow with a foamy white head. There is a good amount of carbonation in the beer. The smell is somewhat like a wheat. The taste is light and the yeast used gives the beer a strange flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth with the flavor lsating a while. The beer is light and easy to drink but different."
"I'm having a hard time finishing this beer. But my daddy didn't raise a quitter."
"Poured out mostly like a Pilsner for sure, with a pale clear body and lots of carbonation. However, unlike the lagers from Bohemia, this one seemed to have no trouble forming and holding a pillowy, and foamy head. The aroma was spicy which I presume was due to use of Saaz hops. There was very slight hint of DMS in the form of cooked corn, but it did not smell out of place for a fresh Pilsner. The taste was softer than a Pilsner, with lingering sweetness that was very pleasing. The hops were present the form of a mineralized backbone. The mouthfeel was creamy and soft. It was hard to shoehorn this into a style, but I'd put it somewhere between a Strong Ale, Cream Ale, and Pilsner. No ABV listed on the label, but the alcohol was not a big factor, so I would venture a guess at this being in the neighborhood of 5-6%. Very easy to drink, with no flaws found in any department, which I'd say is a pretty damn good piece of work considering the major departure from the original recipe."
"Enjoyed this one on my back porch. Beer pours a golden straw color that's somewhat hazy at the top of the glass. I soon discover this has more to due with the 80 degree heat than the characteristics of the beer. Lots of carbonations bubbles float to the top, where sits a very loose one-inch head of very large bubbles. Looks like a run-of-the-mill pilsner. The nose, however, is something different all together. Had I not read the label to discover this a pilsner hybrid brewed with ale yeast, I still would've known something was up from the nose. It smells like a pilsner, but there is something unique about the aroma that I can't quite put my finer on. There is a big biscuity malt smell present. Whatever it is, its appetizing to say the least. The taste is a quick snap of hop bitterness, not overwhelming, but perhaps a bit more than, say, a Pilsner Urquell. This gives way to a long, biscuity middle before fading into a dry, crisp, clean finish. The aftertaste is pretty long and dominated by a citrus note. Pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is thin, but that seems to be the aim. All things considered, this is a pretty exceptional summertime beer. Great for a ball game or hanging out by the pool. Its clean, extremely easy drinking, and flavorful. I'm sure some hopheads might find it to weak or dull, but this is indeed a session beer and a refreshing one at that. I will be hitting this one up again very soon."
"the beer looks like budweiser or any other pale gold beer out there. not much for a head, i couldn't really pick up much of a nose on it. drank great though. nice session beer."
