"3/29..poured from a can. Clear gold, active bubbles. Sticky white foam. Clear pilsy nose, very light. German pils taste and a firm bitter. Light citrus pokes through. Simple but good."

"Hazy straw color. Good head with nice lacing. Nice pilsner with a slight bitterness.  Overall an excellent pilsner.  Real Ale never disappoints."

"12 oz. can at Ginny's Little Bighorn on Sun., 12/28/2014 (Chicken Shit Bingo), unknown brewing/packaging dates, poured into plastic cup, drank over 30-45 minutes"

"A bit rough around the edges, but this is a good stab at a German-style Pils with a ton of drinkability."

"Great flavorful and tasting pils, this one is a winner."

"This is one of the very few German ""style"" beers that actually tastes exactly like a German beer. It very closely resembles a northern German ""herbes"" (=bitter) Pils. The closest German beer as a comparison might be Flensburger, also knows as ""Bölkstoff", for those of you who love comic books. As a German-American Texan, I love Hans Pils."

"Golden beer with a pillowy soapy head. Smell is a little stale with faint hops and grains. Taste is clean, dry, and crisp. A little bready with a slight skunk that is common with the style. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall a nice german style pilsner."

"This is a pale pale straw colored beer with a substantial head on it--a good inch thick from one can's pour. Clean malt aroma, a teeny bit grainy, with grassy hop notes. Very good pils flavor, with a good amount of hoppy bitterness, floral, grassy hop flavor, and, of course, pils malt. Not all that much to say, except this is a very good, very easy drinking German style pils."

"Overall: I really want to like this beer. Yes, I get that hop-forward Pils is what kinda Märicans probably are hankerin' for, but it still is slightly disappointing for me. It's quite bitter, almost in the high 30s or low 40s IBU-wise, and again, I'm finding a serious lack of enough German Pils malt backbone. It's like, ""hey, I can do hops, yeah, hops, that's it, I'll hop it up, and now I got a Pils."" Unfortunately, hops are only a part of a Pils, and though a hoppy Pils is good, balance within the spectrum of Pils malt sweetness is essential to make it get beyond just good or serviceable. But after drinking more sips, I'm getting more Pils malt sweetness, even though I can't pinpoint where it's coming from, but it's almost a sickly sweetness that's not complex enough. Hard to explain such nuances, but that's where I'm at for this beer. The mouthfeel, though crisp, is still a major demerit for me. A 3.5 of 5."

"This beer pours a nice golden yellow with a huge head even with a conservative pour.laces the glass big time,it almost glows in my pilsner glass.the appearance is the best thing about this beer.from here it goes down hill not much smell to me.the taste is a little strange to me,not bad just something's not right.the best pilsner I have had is noble pilsner from Sam Adams I also like victory prima pils but this one just seems not right.overall I would call this a good beer,it goes down good on a hot day but just falls short IMO .pilsners are such a diverse style that it makes them hard to judge to me some times it seems as if you drink one and ask yourself is this really a pilsner?"

"Overall, I'd go to this again even if as a sessionable brew. Almost up there with Prima for me (Where Victory's take on the style stands out with a perfectly grassy characteristic, Hans Pils to me has a character defined more by a smooth & tasty-grain type of finish). And this being canned is a plus."

"The only Hans I know is a rambunctious ten-year-old who's likely gonna be quite the badass when he grows up. That said, this stuff right here pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light biscuit, grass, flowers, and a twinge of what almost seems like cilantro way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, the background spiciness now less cilantro-like and more almost lime-peel-like. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice pils, one I could easily see drinking many of in the cruel heas of a Texan summer."

"O: Noble hop forward, crisp, refreshing, trad. german pilz. I'm a big fan of this beer and the style in general."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great example of the style. Other examples of the style are a bit dryer and a little easier on the hops. I'm pleased with this interpretation."

"It poured a clear gold with a substantial white head and with an aroma of spicy hops. The taste was light, crisp and refreshing with a smooth body and surprisingly full mouthfeel for a lighter brew. The Hans’ Pils was a full flavored pilsner with just the right amount of hops to give it a good bitterness without going over the top. Real Ale really dialed this one in and created an excellent Pilsner."

"O: wow. Real Ale nailed this one ... a fantastic recipe that offers a ton of a lot of things ... spice, grass, some grain, loads of malt, enough sweetness to keep you from turning green (at 52 IBUs, this thing is loaded with the Tettnanger!) ... it's a perfect Texas option if you want a strong hopped-up pilsener that is still drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Crisp, clean, refreshing beer that prominently features noble German hop bitterness. Loses big points in the appearance for lack of a head (maybe due to bartender error), and the hazyness. It also looses out a tad in the mouthfeel department. Still, it's a phenomenal summer beer, and at 5.3% ABV you can toss back 2 or 3 without becoming inebriated."

"Starts off very hoppy, mostly lemony, spicy and grassy hops. Sweet pale malts in the background, slight honey. Clean-bitter finish. Body is light and crisp, carbonation is very active."

"Hans Pils has a bubbly body, pleasant mouthfeel, and crispness. The bitter sensations and somewhat sour flavor could surprise some people at first, especially those who are used to plain ol’ American style, mass produced pseudo pilsners. But the overall flavor is tasty and memorable. Add everything together and you have a very respectable effort that can compete with the better American pilsners."
""
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a thin white head that quickly disappeared. The aroma is nice and grassy with a hint of lemon and grain. It tastes pretty much the same with grassy hops and a hint of lemon and grain, really not much else, but very nice in aroma and taste. The beer is medium bodied with a good amount of light carbonation and a dry finish."

"(O) Well balanced drinkable especially on a hot day. Definitely will try it again in the future."

"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is light and refreshing and a pretty solid take on the style. I could see myself throwing down a bunch of this pretty effortlessly."
""
""
""
"o: If i'd do anything to this is dial the sweetness back a tad, but not very much. The balance of hops to malt has to be just right and this is very very close. This beer feels decadent despite it's pale, fizzy look. Recommended."
""
"I really can't find anything wrong with this. Good fix for hop heads, super drinkable. The only Pils I can think of liking more is the Victory Braumeister series. Okay I thought of something wrong with it - it doesn't stay in the glass long enough...it does leave a lotta lacing though."
""
"Nice job Real Ale...this one is probably one of your best!"
"Poured from on tap, unknown freshness. This was poured a slightly hazy light straw color with s short lived white head which leaves a lacing. The smells are earthy, a little grassy hops and some light crisp malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, earthy and grassy, nice amount of hops and very crisp, not bad."

"Overall: Good representation of the style. Old world sensibilities, bitter and a bit earthy, a great summer treat."

"It offers a great mouthfeel of a lingering, tingling bitterness."

"O - This is a refreshing and flavorful pils that is perfect on a hot Texas day. Solid example of the style and highly recommended."

"Overall: This is definitely one of the best Pils I've ever had due to the complexity that is not usually associated with the style."
"Pours a light golden color. It’s hoppy in a way that most pilseners aren’t, with a wonderful Czech Saaz hop profile on the nose and palate. There’s a crisp, dry finish and a some faint biscuit on the nose that reminds me of the Real Ale Fireman’s. Some chew, a fuller body than I’d expect for a pils but not in a bad way at all. This might be my favorite pilsener at the moment."
"M/D - medium thin mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Excellent example of style."
"Not quite on par with Victory's Prima Pils, this is still a delicious beer."
"Lots of hop bitterness and leafy hop flavor. Good pilsner here, I think this one could hang with some of the better versions from PA I have had recently. Mouthfeel is good, not thin at all and pretty full flavored. I could certainly drink alot of this one."
"D - Easy to knock back a few of these"
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grassy and earthy hops with some flowery notes. The flavor is grapes and biscuit malt but it is very bitter. The bitterness is well above what I expect in a pilsener and detracts from the overall flavor of the beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The bitterness in this beer needs to be toned way down before I can enjoy it."
"The mouth has decent heft. It is an interesting take on the style. Sourness would limit me to a couple."
"american pilsners are getting better. this is proof. voluminously hoppy and airy feel... now we just need to get the character in the malty backbone... for something worldclass."
"The flavor is everything the aroma promised, and more. Sharp, crisp German hops bite the palate with notes of fresh grass and bitter resin. Hops linger long into the finish like a good IPA, but never are the malts pushed the background, instead balancing nicely with cracker and bleached flour. Uber-clean with no off-flavors. Mouthfeel is superb: light-bodied, well-carbonated, and effortlessly drinkable on a hot Austin day. Han's Pils is easily one of THE best American-made German Pilseners I've come across. Gives Victory's Prima Pils a run for its money."
"Well done Real Ale. This is very enjoyable. Nuanced and subtle, just like a good lager should be. Some recurring themes, but well earned. An excellent lager, and highly recommend."
