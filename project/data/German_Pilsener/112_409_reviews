"A good beer from north coast. A little too bitter for my taste but they have a great wheat beer I prefer over this brew."
"Great pilsner! Crisp and lagery without bing oversweet."
""
""
"Lite gold pour (16oz draft) with white head. Baked bread with hint of floral notes; bready with a little floral finish. Lite, crisp mouthfeel. Overall, a nice lite way to start the day."

"this is one of the better widely available pilseners made in the united states i think. its super refreshing and bright, but its got a little body too it, nothing watery about it at all, and has a ton of flavor, nothing adjunct about it, with just a little sweetness in the middle before the more bready or crackery malts come in, fresh and sturdy for the style. hops are light, enough bitter to balance a higher sweetness, but not real intense at all. some grassy notes, really fresh this is fantastic. a great beer with greasy food like pizza and wings, not filling at all, and more than just a palate cleanser. i havent been the hugest fan of north coast over the years, never really thought they stood out much, but this one is awesome, and im not usually too excited about pilsener. delicious, different, worth buying for sure. this may become a go to for me. sessionable forever at this abv too."

"A disappointing beer from North Coast, a normally great brewery.  I have had this a few times over the last few years, and it's always the same: a little flat; flavors that don't belong (a bit sour with funky vegetables); watery; unpleasant aftertaste; and very reminiscent of macro beers costing half the price.  There are so many better pilsners than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mild hop bitterness and malt sweetness work well together, though the latter is unexpectedly prominent. The body isn't overly light and crisp but rather softly fizzy with just enough bite to be refreshing. Pleasant and satisfying."

"12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods. Pours clear gold with a lasting off white head. Some noble hop aroma with a hint of citrus. Slightly sweet, with a graham cracker malt base. Clean, slightly floral mid-palate with mild hop bitterness. Fresh, crisp, refreshing and tasty. Love the low carb, low ABV. A very well crafted Pilsner."

"Beautiful beer.  Golden color pure white head when poured from tap at Silver cow. Refreshing change to all the Ipa out there . Very sessionable"
""
""

"A bit cloying on the palate"
""
""
"My tastebuds love this and I'm no expert but I LOVE this. Crisp. Bubbly. Clean finish. Slight dryness. I hate flowery. I hate hoppy. I hate CRAFT for the most part. XLNT. BRAVO."
"well placed lighter pull with a bright smack and a clean finish."

"Overall: I've tried four different American brewed German Pilsners in the last 2 days and this is BY FAR my favorite of the 4. I honestly did not expect to be nearly as amazed with this beer as I am. I would even say that it is one of the better German style pils available even including German brewers. I am shocked by the average review rating, but I think this has a lot to do with BA being biased towards specialty beers and tending to overlook more subtle beers or not appreciating how difficult it is to brew a beer to such a high degree of excellence as this."

""
""
"Delightful on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste: Some barley and hops. A subtle citrus and orange-like flavor in the background. A mildly hoppy beer. A good one to introduce someone to what pilsners are all about."
""
"O - very nice American brewed German Pilsner. It's easy to drink and ended up being a crowd pleaser. I'd get it again for that reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm hoping this was an old bottle (no date). The flavor was bready and malty, with very little of the crisp, hoppy bite I look for in a Pils. I'm being generous with a 3.4 just because I do think this bottle was well past it's prime. I'll have this again when I see it on draft to see if my suspicion is correct."

"Scrimshaw Pilsner brewed by North Coast Brewing Co, with an ABV of 4.40%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is nice with some grains and malts.  There is nothing over powering so far. The taste is nice with some malts and grains. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Scrimshaw Pilsner  has a smooth  finish. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5.  I would buy this brew again."

"This is my first beer from North Coast. Served from a 12 oz. bottle. Pours a light to medium gold with a decent head that doesn't leave much lacing. Hops are very noticeable in the aroma, but there is a lack of malty or grainy notes. Taste is good, with hops out in front again. I would have preferred more of a grainy dryness here as I think it's more consistent with the style. Mouthfeel is decent if a bit thinner than I would have liked. Carbonation is significant and nicely refreshing. Overall, this is a decent warm weather beer, and while I would certainly drink it again if offered, it's not something I would go out of my way to get my hands on."

"Poured a deep, very slightly cloudy gold with a thick foamier white head. The head has minor retention and leaves a smidgen of lacing. The aroma is very good, with notes of a nice biscuit and fresh grass nature. The taste has similar components with just a light hint of sweetness on the finish. There is a nice crispness to the finish and good thin weight to the body. Very good, certainly"

"Wow, just keep coming back to this one. Poured into a shorty. Has a lively pumpkin glow. Inviting for sure. But what really makes it special is the citrus aroma. It's outstanding with every sip (or gulp). Non of the mustyness that comes with many pills. And the taste is exceptional. Scrimshaw takes you on a nice bright flavor ride before pulling back to a clean satisfying finish. Could drink this one all the time -- wait, i do!"
""
""
"Pleasantly surprised by this one.  Clean drinking and tasting pilsner.  Minimal lacing, clear golden color and barley aroma.  Just like a pilsner should be.  I could drink this one all day.  Carbonation was a little on the fizzy side, but did not detract from the experience."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a nice, refreshing Pilsner. It's perhaps not as crisp as I'd like, but that is a bit more in-style to a German Pils rather than a Czech one."
"Overall: Best pilsner I've had up to this point. Excellent session beer, tasty and refreshing especially in a warm summer evening. Very well priced as well."

"O: Perhaps my current favorite. Definitely in my top 3! I love this and consider it a great representation of the style. The low ABV is also quite a plus to me. Perfect summer brew. I would drink these all the time if they weren't so damned expensive ($11/6)."

"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a flute. This is a deep golden yellow beer, nearly light orange, with a creamy white head resembling whipped cream that settles down quite quickly. Aroma is classic white bread-like pale malts predominantly, with a subdued stronger cereal note and noble hops notes, slightly floral and fruity. The cereals are stronger on the palate, and truth be told this is one of the best German pilseners I've had from a malt standpoint. There is a rich and sweet caramel-like maltiness along with the more expected cracker and sourdough bread notes (there must be a decent dose of crystal in this) and the hop flavors are really popping out as well ... I am getting some tangerine and orange in here, unripe stone fruit galore, faint brown spice (!), grass and fragrant hay ... The citrus is quite prominent in the finish. Body is thin as per the style but with a shade more chew than mass-produced adjunct lagers, and the carbonation is pleasingly toned down but still robust enough to remind you that you are drinking a pils. Finishes fruity yet dry and a little chalky, with a massive citric presence that lingers. Absolutely brilliant stuff. The green malts provide most of the heft but the hop flavor and bitterness keeps up admirably."
"Pours a hazy gold in color with a good almost 2-finger head that settled down to a think layer on top and sides of the glass. A great deal of lacing is seen, like most German Pilsners. The aroma is mostly of just grass and fresh bread. The taste is well...fantastic! Not overly complicated at all for the taste. Very refreshing and goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Very surprised as I wasn't sure of how this one would be overall but very pleased!"

"If God himself were to drink a beer, it would be this one. It has the light, drinkable texture, all of the alcohol content, and no nasty aftertaste. I can drink this while i eat dinner, or I can come in after mowing my grass and this beer is absolutely amazing. I have had it semi warm and ice cold. Of course Ice cold is the best. The one thing that I truly admire about this beers flavor is that is goes great with any food you make. I truly love it best with a big plate of fried Cod, Fried chips and hush puppies!"

"For the style this beer is amazing. North Coast rules. Acme pale and Old Ras are very good as well. I am the beer manager at a store located in MD and I recommend this beer all the time for anyone who drinks any style of beer. Surely a favorite to many."

"Good pilsner, it just lacked a bit more bittering hops."
""
""
"Overall, I'm partial to Czech pilsners and this one is very much more German in style. It is good, but just very safe. Drinkable, that's for sure. Overall, an ok session beer, maybe on a summer afternoon. But not one to run back to any time soon."

"This is a welcoming beer to my winter-weary taste buds. I love the Pilsner style of beer, and this one is ""just right"" in the hops and malt department for me. It pours beautifully, a light amber with a thick head and lingering laciness. Smells of summer to me. Taste is crisp, with just the right balance. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and leaves the palate dry and refreshed. I could enjoy this one on the deck this summer with a grilled burger and potato salad, or right now with a tasty Reuben sandwich and chips. Sooo much better than the mass-produced pilsners being offered in the U.S. these days. I'll be back for more!"

"Pouring a rich 1-1/2 inch head topping of loose bubbles lost in tinier ones. Color is bright, ""warm as yellow"" (™ Innocence Mission) in my weizen glass. The lemon note hit me right away. Comfort of herb telling sugary sweetness to take a hike. Mouthfeel didn't notice the lack of carbonation's persistence as it was savoring this evocation of summer, in denial of today's winter chill. I find myself reaching for peanuts at the ball game or something salty. Herbal lingering on the palate and a dry finish. Put me in, Coach, I'm ready to play TODAY~"

"O: Very easy to drink and it pairs well with most foods - I enjoyed it with some Tapas personally and it matched well with many different flavors in the dishes. The beer has a very low ABV and is quite sessionable."

"Overall Drinkability: A great pilsner. I might not know this was a pilsner if I were blind-folded."
""
"The mineral character is slightly offputting. Overall,a fairly refreshing brew that could benefit from less bready malt character and no diacetyl."
""
"A decent German style pilsner, nothing unpleasant, nor anything memorable. The malts seemed a bit different than a typical pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is much like the nose with a slightly sweet and malty character. Maybe I have not had enough German pilsners and while I enjoyed it for what it was I thought it seemed a bit unusual for the style. But there's nothing wrong with adding your own touch to a brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"There are more enjoyable craft German Pilseners, but Scrimshaw is respectable and drinkable. A solid choice for a summery lager six-pack."
""
"O: This is not the most textbook example of the style, but it isn't bad. Sits just a little bit heavier on the palate than most pilsners."
""
""
""
""
"The Pilsner quality is found in the taste as a sweet barley malt, roasted kiln grain and tea leaf flavor comes out. Very smooth, crisp, and refreshing this is as advertised. Nothing complex but simply a quality tasting refresher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A refreshing pilsener, but it doesn't bring much to the tab;e."

"Overall: Excellent Pilsner, this is my 2nd 6 pack and could'nt wait to pick it up. It is a very balanced beer, light and easy to drink. I was a bigger fan of Kolsch beers, but this pilsner has made me re-evaluate my own palate, practically a perfect beer for me and for my everyday drinking."

"This pours a clear golden straw color with impressive head retention. There’s an aroma of a light grassy, lemony note. Some mild cornflake contrasted with lemon zest. It tastes softly crisp, with a subdued sweetness, a touch of grass & a great effervescence. Much better than the one I had on tap not too long ago! It’s light, easy drinking & priced right for repeat visits."

"i got this scrimshaw in my beer club this month.. and its a good example of why i do the beer club, bc i might over look this beer in the store. its a good beer. looks clear and golden. nice color and head. it smells about like what you would expect a pilsner to smell. but i really thing it has a good balance of drinkability and flavor. its a really solid beer you could drink on any occasion."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy and cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, apricot, floral, grass, bread, honey, and floral earthiness. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and strength of malt, fruity esters, and light hop notes. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, apricot, floral, grass, biscuit, light pepper, honey, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, biscuit, light pepper, honey, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity esters; with a fair amount of hop flavor; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a light creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a nice Pilsener. Definitely not as dry as most I have had; but has a nice balance of fairly unique flavors, and is very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall - Great German style pilsner. Flavors are fairly simple, but pronounced and present a dual layered experience. Really easy to drink. Sessionable."
""
"OVerall - Not bad, too weak and watery for me. Very easy to drink, just a little too light on the hops and malts. I can see were alot of people would like this, as i do to, but just way to may better pils out there. Its still worth a drink."
""
"overall, eh, decent . . . . not much of a fan of pils, but i can see how a few of these could be easily absorbed over a good conversation. still prefer a bit more of an abv but i guess this is typical of the style. i can do a few of these.... heck, i'm a sucker for anything that's seriously crafted- i gotta give it a 4.5 overall. i do like it..."
""
"Not much in the way of aroma, but this doesn't reflect the taste which is moderately floral, fresh, and slightly salty. Very satisfying. The mouth feel is perfect for style, not too thick or thin. Not much head, but this could have been the fault of the pourer. I'd drink this again."
"I drank this beer out of my arrogant Bastard pint class. I have very little experience with pilsner's and it happened to be my last beer in my custom made 6 pack. I was not expecting anything out of the ordinary, however i was blown away. Taste is hard to explain, but the easiest way to explain how this beer tasted was clean and to the point. Was brewed like an authentic german pilsner using the German Purity law and it tasted like it. Tasted like it was brewed with real spring water. Light caramel finish with just the right amount of hops. The absolutely only thing that i would saw, for me was that the carbonation was just a tad overwhelming. outstanding beer A+. Coudos to North Coast Brewing company."
"North Coast local and loyal drinker forever thanks to fantastic beers like this one."

"Overall: A good pilsner overall, and this one packs a good amount of flavor."

"Very good pilsner. Complex yet balanced. Flavorful and easy to drink."
"Served in a pint glass. Straw colored with half finger of head. Normal pilsener stuff. Had a honey smell to it and some dry grain. Spicy taste, wet bitterness and clean. Crisp and light body with moderate carbonation. A great pils that had a bigger body and flavor than most other pils."

"I'm a bartender at a very popular Tap Room in Durham, NC. This beer is one of my ace in the holes. I often encounter patrons that are new to craft beer and need guidance. We don't sell Anheuser Busch products which alarms some guests, but North Coast Scrimshaw Pilsner allows me to engage guests and challenge their tastes."
"Scrimshaw pours a bright straw yellow with a huge white head, leaving some nice lacing behind. Tiny bubbles come up from the bottom of the glass. Scent is malty with some spicy floral hops. Flavor is light, peppery, lemony with some maltiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and oily with medium carbonation, a dry finish and a slight lemon aftertaste. This is a highly drinkable pilsner, very sessionable and perfect for summertime activites that require a low ABV beer. I will definitely revisit this guy. Cheers!"

"*Edit: Just reading at the N. Coast web site that this beer has won medals in the category ""American Lager Ale."" While I'm not sure of the BA's definition, if it's anything close to a Kölsch, and NC had labeled this beer as such, I'd have given it higher marks."

"I was excited to try this beer. Got it @ Whole Foods tonight. Honestly I am a bit disappointed as this doesn't stand out much from a macro pils to me. Part of it is that I am not a huge pils fan to begin with, but when reviewing it objectively I would not prefer this much over a PBR. It has a bit of a bitter taste to it. The smell is pretty good, not skunky. This mouthfeel is generally smooth and not a turn off. Overall this is NOT a bad beer, and I could throw a few back and enjoy. But it is clearly average in my opinion."

"O - Seems a bit more pale lager than pilsener but none the less good drinking. Went great with the SF oysters and little neck chowder"

"This is a good clean, crisp lager. It is simple as a lager should be, and it was decent priced at 8.49 @ Bevmo in Los Angeles area which is the going rate (low end) for a craft 6 pack. I find my self spending 30 bucks on a 12-pack these days. I am searching for the perfect lager and so far Peroni (yes Peroni) is the closest I've gotten!"

"O-a refreshing pilsener with good flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at La Sirena in South Laguna Beach. It was $6 for 15 oz pour, at least they're honest about their ""pint"" glasses."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours hazy golden with a foamy white head that slowly dissipates, leaving minimal lacing around the sides of the glass. Aromas of lightly toasted malt and grassy hops. It's the sort of smell you'd expect from this style. The flavor is slightly sweet and bready. There's a mild citrus flavor and the hops come in on the back end. The flavor is well-balanced. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, yet also crisp and dry. The carbonation is appropriate and not overpowering, making this very easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid and very drinkable Pils. I would recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber, thin white head dissipates to a ring, no lacing. Moderate aroma of sweet malt and bready yeast. Light taste of sweet and caramel malt, light fruit. Somewhat dry but sweet finish. Subdued flavors, but well balanced and what flavor is there is pleasant. A good low ABV standby."

"O: Damnit if I didn't get a kick out of North Coast's Scrimshaw Pilsner. This is easily one of the better German style Pilsners being brewed in America - make that anywhere. And with such a low ABV, it's great to find such flavor without having to wreck myself with too much booze. A big thumbs up from me. Heartily recommended, and something I eagerly look forward to getting into many times again."
"Taste is fairly average, with the barley coming through pretty quickly, and a light citrus tingle in the finish. It's subtle, though. Not bad, but I can't say I'd return to this one anytime soon, either."
""
"Overall – This is a good beer. Although this comes from a guy who generally prefers porters and IPA, this pilsner is fresh, clean, and tasty. I would drink it again for sure, I think it is a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
"This is a light and very refreshing beer. It's to style and it's sessionable, and for the style it's full of flavor. I would have this again."
""
""
""

""
""
"O - good grass mowing beer but needs more hops"
""
""
""
"If I was really picky I would say the beer could be a tad more carbonated, other than that this is the best pilsner I have had to date. Very tasty, nice clean hop taste that doesn't overpower the malt flavor. Nice golden color with tiny bubbles. Great taste, goes down incredibly smooth."
""
""
""
"Pours out a sunny straw yellow, lightly hazed. One finger of head, no lacing left behind. Smells like a ginseng green sweet tea for some reason... actually it is probably a combination of herbal hopping with a Saaz-like ginseng spiciness. Also I can detect the aroma of a honeyed pale malt underneath that. Everything present in the nose also shows up in the flavor, but there is also a lot of floral and white bread elements that I wasn't able to smell. Body is on the light side of medium thick and sufficiently carbonated for the flavors within. This one is a really tasty German Pilsner."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Another well made Pilsner that I really enjoy."
""
"Well worth looking for if you're in the mood for a classic pilsner. Soft and subtle in character, yet completely hitting the mark in the style."
""
""
""
"O - Overall I like this beer. It's not over carbonated or sweet, and it's very drinkable to me. There's not really anything I can say bad about it, although I probably would prefer a Prima Pils over this. I'd buy this again though, pretty tasty. Cheers!"
"overall: there's a lack of bittering and flavoring hops when it comes to my ideal pilsner. The carbonation could be toned down a bit too. an OK beer at best."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, as usual with north coast, hidden freshness date. This pours a nice golden color with a white head. The smell is a nice crisp pilsner, grass, hops, malts. The feel is light and crisp. The taste is some of the same, nice and crisp, a fine pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid Pilsner quite nice. It's been a little warm today so I am enjoying this one, feels right."
""
""
""
"This is a good, clean, thirst quenching beer. I would have liked a touch more bitterness and a little less sweetness but I would seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Would have liked a bit more hop balance, but overall a very refreshing, satisfying beer. Worth a try for pilsner fans."
"O: This is a beer that reminds me of a macro. North Coast makes some great brews, but this is something that could be passed on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer had a light feel to it, but the beer was clean, crisp and refreshing. The low ABV was also a plus for me, as I could enjoy a couple and it not really affect me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Poured nicely with a large head with minimal aroma. Smooth light taste. A quick finish with little after taste. Easy to drink and refreshing."
"Nothing like a new Bliss tasting to show you how many everyday beers you haven't tried before. This case-in-point pours a clear straw topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, light wet hay, grass, and flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a light twinge of lemon zest near the edges and finish. Not bad. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a very nice pilsner, one of the best American versions I've had in a while. Right on."
""
"Pours a clear golden color with large, three finger wide, fluffy, pillowy white head. Retention on the head is impressive, and there is a little lacing on the glass. Aroma is of delicate hops, faint yeast, subtle malt, lemon citrus, and various grains. Faint grasses and hay also make their way through. Taste is of lemon, straw, hay, faint malt, a touch of hops, and some scattered grain and floral notes. Mouthfeel is crisp, amply carbonated, and finishes cleanly. Overall, a good, easy-drinking pilsener that I’ve found myself hooked on lately, especially when I can't decide on anything else to drink."
""
"Overall: Nice smooth light malt taste. Very easy drinking. The pilsner malts by themselves do not overpower the rest of the flavor. Nice balance of corn and lighter malts. Super easy to drink, would make a great summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite good and hoppy - used to drink it in Chapel Hill at university. High carbonation with a dry after taste. Has a good ""nostalgia"" feeling for me and would happily drink again if available. Never really noticed the smell - always drank straight from the bottle. Was well worth it in NC as it did not have to travel far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a small hazy orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet malt and small hop. In the taste, sweet maltiness, note of caramel, and a small floral hop. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, and a small dry floral hop in the aftertaste. Sweeter and more floral that expected, almost ale like."
""
""
""
""

"Yeah, finding this slightly deficient mostly in the pilsener stakes. The hop character is just not assertive enough and as a result a weird adjuncty grain note comes through instead."

"O – Decent pilsner, much better than anything from BMC."
"3.5 D: This beer would be really easy to pound one after another. It's super clean and easy to drink, but the downside is that there isn't much going on."
"O - Not bad. Kinda boring. Easy to drink. Not much going on. Like I said, drinkable."
"O: This was a pleasure, I had a tough time finding this beer for some reason, and it was well worth the wait. Great Pils North Coast!!"
"overall: very good beer, very drinkable. it balances the flavors well and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste. good all around beer."
"O: Very refreshing beer."
"RJT"
"Overall Impression- A very typical Pilsner but with an awesome Aroma! Very clean, refreshing, and finishes crisp! I've had many times and will again (when I'm in the mood). Another good one from North Coast Brewing Co."
"O: An enjoyable pilsner, who's to say if this was old or fresh due to lack of bottling date (still...)."
"Overall Drinkability - Greatness for the style. Best pilsner I've had."
"That being said still refreshing and tasty."
"O - Definitely a good pilsner for what it is."
"Pours a clear dark gold color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of biscuit-like malt, earthy/herbal hops, and a bit of an off funky aroma. Taste is better with grainy/biscuit-like malt and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the funky aroma I picked up in the smell knocks the score down a bit."
"This is a good, crisp beer. It pours as i would expect-- straw color, loose head. It smells like dried fruit and hops.The taste is all dried apricot. While this is not bad, it is not what I was expecting, and I am not sure I would drink this one too much. The mouthfeel is perfect for a lager-- crisp and refreshing, with a clean finish."
"Overall: this was a good change of pace.. I don't drink pilseners routinely, so it was nice to enjoy a crisp, clean, and refreshing beer."
"O: I enjoyed this beer a lot more than I expected I would. North Coast is definitely an underrated brewery. Scrimshaw Pilsner is a really nice session lager which could really challenge the top tier with a little less residual sweetness. Great beer nontheless."
"O: It's crisp and drinkable but isn't the most flavorful pilsner."
"Clear light amber color with a thin white head that left rings of sticky lace all the way down. Visibly carbonated - a blizzard of bubbles rush up from the bottom. Smells like clean malts and not much else. Taste is better, as a floral bouquet of hops start to come through. Buttery diacetyl is quite refreshing. A well-made American pils."
"It's Saturday afternoon...just got done with my responsibilities for the day....and it is time to start relaxing. The first beer today is a North Coast Scrimshaw...and it was a great lead off. The appeance is great for a pilsner....golden clear great carbonation thin white head that is lacing. The smell is typical of most pilsners but seems much fresher. There is malt, hop, grain. The taste is very easy for a pilsner and quite good....probably the best pils I have had in a while...and possibly ever. The mouthfeel is smoot like butter and very easy to drink. Worth a try!!!"
"Light, well carbonated, and easy to drink. Overall it was a nice pilsner that went down easy and I'd certainly try it again."
"This beer has a bit of a bite to it, partly due to the hops, partly the carbonation. This helps it stand out above the pack of pilseners. I love pilseners, so it doesn't necessarily have to stand out to please me. That being said, it doesn't go down nearly as smooth as other pilseners (part of the reason I love them), so I don't always go for this one, but it is a good beer and worth trying."
"Overall, it's drinkable and really isn't that bad. In fact it really is a good beer but doesn't stand up to the brewery discription or style in general. For me, the thin smooth soft flavor and feel are the sticking points."
"Pours a clear golden straw hue which leaves a fluffy two finger head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is fresh cut grass,lemon zest and a touch of caramel,the mouthfeel is nice and silky smooth with perfect carbonation and has tastes of floral hops,lemon/lime zest,white grapes,a touch of candy and finished with a crisp dry grassy hop finish and overall better than most macroswill but there is better versions of this style out there and i would not revisit anytime soon cheers."
"D: An easy drinker with some flavour."
"O - Pretty average. Nothing special by any means.. needs more noble hop flavor."
"Just an okay pilsner in my opining. For sure a big disappointment."
"Overall: Seriously! I'm yet to cross a beer brewed by North Coast that isn't worth my money. Even though I'm a bigger fan of ales, this beer contains the nice, light funkiness of lagers and the thick malty body of ales. As a session brew, it's crowd pleaser for sure, yet a slightly complex beer that beer geeks can enjoy as well."
"An interesting Pils, that's for sure - Continental influence, NoCal edge. In the end, the crispness factor keeps this offering afloat, rendering an enjoyable and flavourful lager. A nice change-up from all the heady IPAs that I acquired along with this on that trip Stateside."
"O: Super easy to drink and really refreshing and clean. I would definitely get thing again."
"Overall: A decent malt leaning Pilsner. It would be more enjoyable with a stronger hop presence, but it's not bad by any means."
"Scrimshaw Pilsner is nothing at all like most bastardized American examples you'll find in the corner store fridge, but despite its clean, confident, wholesome maltiness, it's not quite on the same level as the best micro (and especially German) examples either. Still, if you're not picky and just looking for a simple, easy drinking beer, this will do you no wrong."
"T: Bready malts, yeast and a very slight touch of hops. The hops were a little too faint for me. I feel like maybe this wasn't the freshest bottle. I'd like to try this again a bit more fresh."
"O: Really great pilsner. One of the best I've had. A nice drinker that I will look for later."
"Mouthfeel: This one comes across rich and almost creamy with a crisp, clean, and light body that doesn't compromise flavor. A definite recommendation is presented here."
"M: The best part of this beer. Mouth coating is nice with crisp taste. Not overpowering with carbonation. The finish is great. Dry finish."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice golden straw color with a decent 1 finger clean white head. The beer settles a nice transparent and lightly bubbly look. The aroma is very mild but crisp. There are some slight hints of malt alone with a bready note. The taste is very clean and crisp. There is a good malt front with a very faint bitter hop finish. There is also a dryness to the after taste, but at the ABV not likely from alcohol content. This is a very well made and balanced brew. Nothing over powering but that is what the style calls for and this is a good example."
"So easy to drink, settling on the tongue and beyond - highly sessionable given the ABV."
"O: This beer is ok. It is by no means bad, I just did not find it to be my personal favorite. I thought the grassyness was too strong and there were not enough complexities to the beer. I will probably be sticking to other Pilsners."
"Nice light feel with good carbonation. Overall a great pilsner. Real good for summer."
"Overall this delivers a nice refreshing beer that is true to style and complex as well. One regret i have is passing this up on tap while in Hawaii a month or so ago. Good beer!"
"O- a decent pils but not one i would choose"
"Overall: I am a person who prefers malts to hops and this is one of the maltier pilseners I have had in a while. With the low abv I could session this. I am glad I bought a six and will look for it again."
"Pours a very slightly hazy, deep gold. a white head patches to the glass as a nice-sized ring. Smell is nice and biscuity, with light fruit and straw-like notes. Taste is a nice wash of citrus on a very light malt backing, followed by some decent, bitter hops. Finishes not-too-dry and satisfying. Good, refreshing brew."
"D - Goes down easy, inoffensive, not bad at all. If you happen to see one around, and have a thirst to quench, go for it."
"This beer pours a semi-hazy golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of grassy hops and pale malt. There is a hint of sulfur in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma. Nothing in the taste or aroma really shines, but nothing is out of whack either. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is a little too high for my liking. Overall, this is a decent beer, but there are much better pilsners out there on both sides of the pond."
"An average pils. It does very little to discriminate itself from other generic pilseners, and while it does a reasonable job at emulating a style, that doesn't necessarily make it a particularly good beer."
"Overall, excellent for the style. The aroma is right on as is the flavor."
"O. It just doesn't have much flavor."
"Scrimshaw is a decent and refreshing craft beer that has some nice flavors and would go well on a hot and humid day like today. Unfortunately it does not measure up to many of the other fine American craft brewed versions of the style. I would have to say that this is one I will pass up any time in favor of something like a Prima Pils or Noble Pils."
"A decent pilsner but it lacks a touch of depth and bitterness. The graininess is also a little over the top for my tastes."
"I have been drinking a lot of pilsners, mostly American, and this one is highly accessible, but almost a bit bland. All about the yeast, being the dominant flavor and smell. Good brew."
"Overall: A good American pilsner, but I think it could be better if maybe the citrus notes were turned down and the spicy/floral hops kicked up a few notches. This is still a good, easy-drinking beer though, and one I could see myself drinking frequently in the summer months."
"M: Very good mouth-feel a little sweet at the beginning changing to some bitterness at the end, with good not to dry finish that last some good time."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I could see myself grabbing a sixer of this stuff on a hot summer day. I wish the alcohol was just a touch higher though."
"Overall I am glad to find another North cost beer this far across the map and this is a very easy drinking one."
"This is a solid Pilsner. Not a straight forward Pilsner. Has a lot of Wheat beer characteristics only with out the heavy spiciness. A certain refresher for the hot days of Summer. Easily drinkable. Got a little too sweet and sour for me after a bit, but it was still tolerable. Almost like I was sucking on a ""lemon drop."""
"Well made German style pilsner. Simple, sessionable, very good!!"
"Golden brew with about one finger of head that sticks around for quite some time. Smells crisp and grainy with hints of spice and citrus. Fresh, grassy flavor with sweet citrus. Never seen this one before in this area, but will definitely drink again if I see it."
"Overall - This is an excellent example of a highly drinkable pils. The taste was very refreshing and it would be a perfect warm weather beer."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is light. This is a very crisp clean easy drinking beer for a very hot day."
"O= Not a fan of this beer I'm sorry to say. Overly sweet in an unfermented sort of way. I prolly won't buy this again."
"Grade: B+"
"This is a wonderful beer. I love it. Highly recommended if you want to see what a real pilsener ought to taste like vs Miller-Bud etc."
"Pours a clear light goldfish yellow with a nice big white head that falls pretty quickly to a blanket. Nice lacing. Smells of pale malt with some definate fruitiness. I'm not getting a ton of complexity but as a pilsner that isn't out of the the ordinary. The taste is the same lightly sweet with some fruitiness though it is balanced with a nice lightly crisp hop presence. Finishes a little sweet then a dry aftertaste. Body is light carbonation is medium and nicely put together making for a smooth easy drinking brew. Overall this is a tasty refreshing light bodied brew. Summer time is made for this beer."
"D: a refreshing, mellow german style pils. not my favorite, but definitely worth a try."
"I instantly fell in love with this blond, frothy, pilsner-style beer. I had it on tap at a pizzeria chain with a seriously respectable draught list (Brixx in Chapel Hill, NC). Scrimshaw has the best possible hop character as far as I am concerned--floral without being too aggressive or bitter. Some Belgian-style lacing on the glass. Dangerously drinkable. I've had it from a bottle since (okay, a few bottles), and it is just as great. I plan on making this the beer of Summer 2011, as it is important to have a plan."
"Poured a nice cloudy straw color. Not much head on it. Good tasting beer. Nice balance. Light mouthfeel and very smooth. This beer went down really easy, can't complain at all. This was a good beer overall. I liked it quite a bit."
"Nice looking pure gold beer, clear with an ok looking head. Smells very fresh and has a nice hoppy twang to it but also balanced. Taste is very bright and somewhat floral and lightly fruity with a hint of balancing malt. Emphasis is on the hops here, which gives it a nice clean fresh taste. Eminently drinkable pils with a nice hop profile here. Recommended."
"Final Notes: A solid, all-purpose pilsner. This would be a great beer to serve at parties. It's very sessionable and would also make for great summer refreshment. Overall, I'm impressed."
"This is a great beer for a hot summer day. Nice example of the style."
"I could definitely see myself enjoying some light fish or pizza with this. I'm going to have another!"
"Good drinkability. Would recommend to a fan of pilsners."
"Drinkability: This is a highly drinkable attempt at a pilsner. I would call this a California pilsner. This is a perfect beach beer. It's a beer to share with good company."
"D - I love a good pilsner but this left me underwhelmed, just not enough flavor and character"
"Color is very light straw with a nice frothy head. Color is quite clear and pretty. Aroma is typical of an German Pilsner, combining light hops and light malt. Flavor was good and refreshing, will be perfect his summer if I can still find it. Overall, a very drinkable beer that can be enjoyed in large quantities."
"D - The drinkability is pretty good here. This is a decent pilsner, and I could easily drink quite a few of these in a sitting. Definitely worth giving it a shot."
"This is a very, very smooth pilsner. Even if you're not a fan of this style, I'd recommend giving it a try. Like all the other North Coast Brewery beers I've tried- it's just great."
"The flavor isn't the best. It is very flat and grainy, whit a little bit of diacetyl. The hops are very nice but the mundane malts kind of deter from them, if it had a better malt flar it woudl have been at least a 4 for flavor. It all seems very thin as well, one of the lightest mouthfeels I have come across in a beer."
"D Very easy to drink, and light. I did not get too much taste or smell, which some people would enjoy, but I like a more robust taste. I could drink many of these in one sitting, but would probably choose something with more obvious tastes and complexities"
"Beer is rather bland. It is mildly sweet and has a decent finish without grain astringency or any bad bitterness. The overall feel of the beer is nice, no aftertaste, wet finish. It's OK, decent. A light beer, very drinkable."
"Had this on tap at the North Coast Brewery and I thought it was terrific. Very, very refreshing. It was the first time I had this beer. That same night I drank a bottle of it and it was a completely different story. It didn't taste nearly as good. From the tap it had exceptional drinkability but from a bottle it tasted way too carbonated. It was refreshing at all. I would get this beer again if it was from a tap but not from a bottle."
"Plentiful grass and hay plus a touch of citrusy sweetness in the light malty nose. Tastes much the same at first, but a rather pungent earthy hop flavor soon kicks in and has a fairly stinging bitterness in tow. Toasty with lingering musty hay in the finish. Pretty nice little pilsner here."
"D: Hmmmm... Not something I'd intentionally grab again, but very crisp. Might be nice on a hot beach."
"Drinkability: I'm wondering if this one is past its prime since the flavors are so mild. It's just okay. I guess I was expecting something with more bite and crispness to it, which this does not have."
"Not a bad pils, but not much hop character. Far more lemon than I expected."
"A quality rendition of classic German brewing, perhaps a little closer to a helles than a pils. Nothing stunningly out of the ordinary, but nothing wrong either in a beer that leaves the brewer no place to hide. A good transition beer for a BMC drinker. Nothing they haven't tasted before, just a bit more of it than they're used to finding in a single glass."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, hazy yellow with a short white head of less than an inch. Not sure just what the nose is but it is sort of fruity and the flavor although light is different than what I normally consider a pilsner. Would like to do a side by side with another well know pilsner."
"D: Average drink for the style"
"Not bad, but true pilsners are supposed to have somewhat of a hoppy snap to them, and this one just sort of fizzles out without much hop character at all."
"Overall: Decent beer overall. There are far better pilsners out there so I wouldn't seek this one out; however, I wouldn't avoid it if better options aren't available."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Mouthfeel was ok but again the musty flavor kind of lingers, but very easy to drink."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head. There was no apparent lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of slightly bitter malt, wheat, and rye. The flavor was of bitter malt, wheat, slight spice, and slight fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice and smooth brew. The aroma unfortunately was lacking bigtime as I had to almost hyperventilate to find anything in it. The flavor was also just okay as it was very light. I would have liked them to have made both the aroma and flavor a little more pronounced in this one, but hey, you can't win them all."
"This might not be everyone's idea of the best beer, but to me this beer was superb. It has a strong inviting wheat smell and pours a golden yellow with a great head on it. It has a medium body feel that's not too heavy or too light. It goes down well with a smooth delicious taste. Definetly a must try!"
"Pours a bright gold color with a small white head and tons of carbonation. Smells of sweet malts and a little minimal hot aroma. Tastes very clean and malty and some little hop bitterness. A fairly average beer as far as taste. Average on mouthfeel and body. Drinkability isn't bad, very clean."
"Great brew, fun and enjoyable, distinct notes in the taste but nothing that distracts it from being a refreshing pilsner. Try it out. I do take a little off the drinkability however, solely for the low ABV at 4.4%. Not cool."
"This poured a yellow straw with a nice thick, lacey head that sticks to glass. Malts and hops highlighted in taste. Sweet, grassy goodness is very well crafted against a wall of classic pilsner hops. Good feel. This one has a sweet, smoothe finish after a sticky feel that has good carbonation which produces a smoothe finish. This is a mainstay pilsner at my house. A must for anyone who likes the style."
"MD- This is an extremely easy drinker. Very refreshing. A good pilsener is exactly what this is nothing extreme or getting in the way of the clear crisp taste."
"D: Excellent session beer. As refreshing as a Kölsch with the complexity of a Dortmunder, yet still quintessentially a German Pilsener."
"Overall, a very nice example of a pilsner and quickly becoming one of my favorite standards."
"D - Subtle, tasty, nothing harsh at all. This is a tasty beverage. I believe it defines drinkable."
"I first tried Scrimshaw at Show Dogs in San Francisco. The girl working recommended I get it to compliment my pickled hot link (a surprisingly classy variation of our spicy friend)."
"Sure it's a 4.4 abv little wimp, but even then the taste is lacking. Watery is an understatement. It feels like drinking club soda. You can drink it quick, though."
"D - Great drinkability. If I had to go out and wanted a pils, this would be one of the first I'd get. Since it's pretty available, that's a bonus."
"Definitely a refreshing beer, I like it. I was surprised at the lack of hops, but it's forgiveable."
"Value: In my opinion, one of the best things about this underrated brewery is the price of their beers- under 10 bucks a sixer."
"Overall, i feel what this one might sacrifice in flavor makes up for with drinkability. It comes close to replicating the malt flavor of classic European pils such as golden pheasant and pinkus ur-pils, but could use some more bittering hop character."
"D - easy drinking. not an award-winning beer (IMO), but I could throw back several of these on a hot day."
"Light-moderate in body, feeling a bit fuller due to lower than normal level of CO2. A touch more spritziness and this would be a killer pils. It's damn drinkable as it is."
"Ordered this one in a taproom and was vary pleased. This beer is solid, as one might expect from North Coast. It's is as good as any pilsner I've had. It drinks easy, has a hint of subtle fruit flavor, and smells very good. It also pours very nicely from the tap with a fluffy head. I'd pick this one again on draft and might pick it up as a favor for a host when a house guest."
"Overall I remember this beer tasting crisper and having more hop influence from the bottle so I'll have to give it another shot at some point. Even as it is, it's a good beer and an easy-drinking one for the summer months."
"Pairing: Tostada of grouper ceviche, pickled nopales, and cherry tomatoes"
"Overall, very very decent for the style. Not that the Germans have anything to worry about. You can put these down easily. It misses a bit in some areas of structure, but overall pretty decent."
"Drinkability - Another beer that is making my list of favorites. I would drink this again."
"I think this is a nice intro to craft beer for those getting off the bud bus."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white head that retains OK, but leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some bready and biscuity malt upfront, along with floral and spicy hops, lemon, mineral and a little alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with biscuit and bread dough upfront, a little graininess, some lemon soap, cane sugar, and some hay. The mouthfeel is light and drinkability is excellent. Overall a decent and impressively drinkable pilsner, but not particularly tasty or complex."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and also quite sessionable given its low alcohol content."
"DB- Good price and very smooth flavor. I like the malt profile and the fruit aspect of this beer the most. Would be a great session beer for a hot summer day."
"Brilliant carbonation with body on the light side of medium, and one of the easiest drinkers around. I think the carbonation of this beer, with the tiny bright bubbles, is the best of any beer I have ever had. A standby."
"Pours a medium yellow with a frothy white head that fades quickly. Smell is malty, with some hop aroma, with a slightly sweet smell. The taste is crisp, very balanced, with nice depth to the flavor. Starts sweet with the malt, and finishes with a light hop flavor. Mouthfeel is almost medium, nice carbonation. This is an easy drinker, probably what comes to most peoples minds when they think of beer, but this has more depth and flavor. A very enjoyable pilsner, definitely worth checking out."
"Pours out a hazy iced tea color with a thin head and a few bubbles.Smells mildly sweet and floral. Taste is dry and malty with a tartness becoming more evident as it warms. It feels crisp with no lingering aftertaste. To me this tastes like a very good example of relatively generic beer. It's very drinkable and reminds me of time I spent in England. I would drink this again."
"D: Very high. An easy drinking session beer that would go well with an afternoon of mowing the lawn followed by an evening grilling up some eats."
"D - At 4.4%, this is a serious session beer candidate. Definitely worth trying."
"D- At 4.4 it's highly sessionable. A good beer, a well made pilsner, on par or a step above SA Noble Pils, though very similar."
"I could buy this again on a warm weather day. Pilsners are always a bit light on taste for me but I do enjoy them in the summer."
"Definitely recommend giving it a try."
"A good attempt at a lighter style, but I don't think I would put it in my top 5 pilsners. Definitely worth a try, though."
"Light body with medium carbonation. Not gonna blow anyone away with this one but definitely sessionable and great for the hot days."
"Overall a good to very good pils - tasty for sure."
"Scrimshaw isn't bad by any means; it's pretty solid for the most part. I just with the flavor held up to the impressive aroma. Most likely I'll pass on this one in the future, with the possible exception of finding it on tap."
"Most of North Coast's beers I really dig. This one is decent, different, but not high on my list for domestic pilsners. Guess I'll have to sample more pilsners this summer (including this one again) and see if I'm buggin'."
"Drinkability> sure"
"The body was much fuller than average, but not at all heavy. Drinkability was very good as well, this would make a great session beer while listening to a ballgame and watching the grass grow."
"drinkability - very session-able, light and easy to drink"
"Very good example of a Pils and a highly quaffable one at that."
"D: Very drinkable session type beer. Not a whole lot going on, but for it's style it's very smooth and enjoyable."
"D - Not too bad, that aroma is light and clean but the flavor is not quite as smooth. There is a hint of fruitiness and some husky, grainy qualities to the malt character that I didn't detect in the aroma. The hop character is a bit weak for my taste as well; I would like to see a bit more bitterness and aroma to balance this level of sweetness. Enjoyable, but there are certainly better pilsners out there to be found with little effort."
"D: When I shock wheat this summer I will bring several cases of this and will drink till its gone."
"A lot of German pilseners have a lemony taste, but most try to balance it with a malty sweet. This one didn't."
"Drinkability: decent, but the flavor profile is a bit mellow which may have you looking for a bolder lower alcohol pils."
"A pils that I wouldn't turn down, but there are others that I would go to first."
"Hop bitterness comes through a bit more in the flavor but has me questioning my initial guess at the Hallertau varietal. Still has a hint of fruit to it and the malts are too heavy for a pilsner. While I'm complaining, I wouldn't mind more flavoring hop additions. It's still a fairly enjoyable beer to drink, but I think I will limit my exposure to this as a tap-only occasional purchase. It is a damn shame there are not more fresh delicious pilsners brewed in the U.S. (excluding you lucky dogs in PA)."
"D: Easily could put down a few. It's a good, sessionable pilsner."
"Drinkability- Easy drinking."
"I will buy again."
"This poured a clear gold with some white head. It smelled like creamy yeast and toasted barley and bread crust, with a bit of copper and lemon hops. It tasted like lemon and copper hops with bready yeast and some light barley malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very simple beer with a taste that was good enough but could have been cleaner. It had nice body and was very easy to drink. It was just hard to get excited about this beer, and I would have expected something a bit bigger and cleaner from North Coast."
"Mouthfeel diminishes as it goes on, becomes more typical pilsner. Drinkable on a hot summer dsy."
"Drinkability: A Nice beer. I Will have again"
"Mouthfeel is light. Drinkable beer. Not spectacular, but I could go through a couple of these if I was bumming around."
"This is a pilsner with excellent flavor and it has an average drinkability compared to other pilsners that I have consumed."
"Surprisingly complex malt character for a pilsner. Unfortunately, the grainy malt and light fruit notes seem to muddle the 'crispness' I would usually associate with the style."
"D - would give this another try only in that maybe this was just a bad bottle but maybe its just not my style."
"Very drinkable. This one might give Prima Pils a run as my favorite craft pilsener!"
"Overall I wasn't happy with the beer. It reminded me of Blue Moon far too much. This I found disturbing because I was under the impression I was drinking a Pilsner, not a watered down wheat beer."
"I tried this beer at a wine restaurant called The Vine in San Clemente CA. Trying a beer sight unseen at a wine place is not always the best idea but I will provide the blind test, prior to my knowledge of the style or brewer prior to my remarks. Good pour into a pint glass with a pale golden color that struck me right away as being the perfect color of a German Pils. Fine white head and visible carbonation that still left some lacing in the glass right down to the finish. Good aroma of slight hop characteristics with some good floral background. Beer was somewhat sweet with a good mouthfeel and great finish. This was a clean well balanced and flavor beer. Only after I came home and looked it up did I realize that this beer was another product out of North Coast Brewing Company. To date this place has not let me down and I just wish more of their products were available in Texas. Great showing for the style and definitely a beer I would enjoy again."
"D- This is a very drinkable pilsener that I enjoy. Good standout beer to introduce to the BMC crowd. Quite surprised this beer doesn't get more praise then what it does. Taste could be a little more but then again this style doesn't call for that."
"This is my 2nd favorite German Pilsener, behind Saint Arnold Summer Pils. Fantastic complexity and taste. I highly recommend Scrimshaw."
"Drinkability is better than most Pils IMHO for my preference, nice work NCBC!"
"D: This would be very sessionable, if it only had a more pronounced flavor."
"Not a bad pilsner. Would not buy again considering the superior Prim Pils is available for the same price. Worth trying once."
"Prost!"
"Has a nice light golden yellow body with a thin white head that thins rather quickly. Aroma is a sweet wheat smell with maybe a hint of citrus. Taste is similar to the smell; the hops are there, but the citrus gets more distinct after it warms. Nice and crisp with a good hop aftertaste. Taste and aroma could be more distinct/strong, but overall a good beer."
"A grain forward brew, with just a slight sugary sweetness. Hops may be there, a bit metallic but not necessarily balanced. A good drinkble pils though, clean and delish."
"Scrimshaw is a pleasant summer beer that doesn't have much to excite but is more than adequate for a little refreshment."
"Notes: North Coast again demonstrates its understanding of another beer style in a very good pilsener."
"d - refreshing, easy-drinking beer. i'll be going back to this one when i want a great session beer."
"Drinkability-Why when there are so many much better pilsners out there, especially those made within 30-45 minutes from me. This isn't awful just mostly bland."
"This is very drinkable."
"Not full-bodied enough for a cold weather brew..just my opinion."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer very enjoyable. A nice, cool, crisp beer that made me ready for the summer months. Very easy drinking beer."
"D- Very drinkable, very good all around and does nothing wrong"
"taste is crisp and tangy, some lemon, light grain, a little malt, and subtle hops, ends on the dry side with just a tad bit of bitterness."
"Drinkability: This beer has a nice flavor that is really easy to drink."
"Straw colored with good clarity and a fine white lace that sticks around. Fresh grain/hay in the aroma. Slightly grainy pale malt character on a light, bubbly body. Hops are earthy, green, and subtle, with only a fleeting hint of lemon. Dry and minerally on the palate, with a clean finish that leaves a very slight graininess. A nice drinkable American pils; lacks the creamy depth and honey undertones of a good European pils."
"D - Refreshing, clean and crisp. Its also very dry!"
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Light earthy nose. Flavor is lemon and hay with balancing hops. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Not your typical pilsner. Less tradtional, but certainly worth trying. The low ABV is a nice bonus on top of that."
"Had this as part of a late night session few days ago. Poured a golden straw color with medium head that faded quickly and left no lacing. Smelled of corn, earthy hops and light malts. Tasted malty with a light hop kick. Very smooth, just a little bit dry. Quite sessionable."
"D: Very tasty. A great summer beer but might be a little overpriced here in Vermont."
"a very mild pilsner. with a small head unless agitated... then nicely lacy. nose fruitier than most. prodominently apple and honey. palate is not particularly pollen or earthy bitter. a brighter pils with not much bitterness in the finish. i tad sweet but nothing that would diminish the beer really. not very clean in taste... or well i guess a better word to use is astringent. a good go to for a very mild american pils."
"Prickly initially. Medium bodied, somewhat bready but also quite crisp. A rather nice, certainly drinkable pils with a nice feel. It leans a bit more heavily towards the malt than I'd prefer."
"D: Solid pils. Very drikable and won't dissappoint."
" in the fall."
"Slightly cloudy gold with active bubbles and no head. The smell is lemons, slight pepper, and sharp hops. The taste is lemmons, farmyard funk, and slight malt. It's slightly slippery and a bit thin. This one makes for very easy drinking. Its very balanced. You could make an afternoon of it & I intend to."
"Pleasant bread malt flavors continue on first sip and the slightly bitter hops are more present than on the nose. Very good balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and well carbonated. Thicker than most Pilsners. Drinkability (as it should be in this style) is amazing. Had a second while typing this up. Possibly my favorite low ABV beer this year."
"drinkablity is good - but for the money i would drink a honkers instead"
"D: a no-nonsense brew. A solid pilsner"
"Reviewed from notes. Had this at the Houston Flying Saucer on tap. Poured into a pint glass. Apears a nice thick golden color with a one inch head. Lot of bready and biscuity malts and some hops in the aroma. I was hoping for a bigger hop bite but it is still great to drink. Lot of malt presence which provides a sweet dry enjoyable finish. Paired nicely with some brat. Will try again."
"D- A great session beer. Not all that unique, which may cause this to be a bit forgettable, but it is enjoyable for what it is."
"Very drinkable. I enjoyed it a lot."
"Tap @ Clocktower Cellar in Mammoth. Poured clear yellow-gold with a short, puffy white head. Average lacing. Floral, sweet grass and lemon peel aroma blended with the pilsner grain and hops. Well carbonated mouthfeel without stickiness. Clean, lemony-citrus taste throughout, strong yeast and grassy hops as well. Pleasant cereal grain flavor towards the finish. Sweet, dry finish. A very, very good pilsner"
"The drinkability on Scrimshaw is high overall given the abv and the easy-going nature of the brew. $11.29 for a sixer is too high, but overall, North Coast has crafted a pretty tasty pilsener."
"Have to say, this and Prima Pilz are the two best pilsners I've had."
"D- Solid easy drinking beer. A fresher sample would probably be even more tasty with just a touch more hops to it."
"D: Perfectly crisp and cleansing. Marvelous companion to a spicy stromboli. As mentioned, I have ignored North Coast as a brewery and have heard many good things. I have a feeling these claims are founded. Well done pils."
"I appreciate beers that respect their style, yet still manage to stand out from the pack. Scrimshaw's calling card (for me) was the sweeter, almost fruity malt presence that stood up to the hop flavors. I would definitely try this as a stepping stone beer for a few of my friends."
"This is a drinkable pilsener that goes great with spicy food & has a surprising hoppiness to it."
"Aside from not quite meeting my hop expectations, it was very enjoyable with good balance throughout."
"Verdict: Would definitely buy again, but unlikely to make it into heavy rotation."
"This is a good interpretation of a pilsner, but hardly the best available. It is a delicate beer that should have a freshness date. It is too costly a six pack to chance the freshness."
"A good Pilsener. Something I usually have around. Nothing extreme, but very enjoyable."
"Overall, I would recommend this if you have never had it, but I will not be getting it again."
"M - Mouthfeel is rich and enjoyable. Overall this could be an easy session for when one isn't inclined to drink anything too harsh on the palate."
"Hazy golden color with one finger head. smells tart, like green apples. taste...tart like green apples.pretty sweet finish, and not as tart in the end. All in all this isnt a bad pilsner, although not one of my favorite styles, i could drink this again."
"Good session starter, could be a session beer if one likes the flat background."
"Ran about $10 a sixer - ain't cheap though."
"Generous, if delicate, bone white head, thickness complemented by sticky lacing. Light brass orange color, fading to yellow where glass tapers off. Lowkey persistence in the nose, with sourdough, wild yeasts and wet straw, lemon oil and rock salt, becomes more herbaceous as it warms, however, the citrus scents never get past a barely audible mutter. Light-bodied to watery, minimal palate presence, leans heavily on the bitterness and sour grassiness to remind you it's there. The carbonation not helping, keeps the flavors from settling in and elevate texture of Pellegrino thing. Pretzel dough, rye bread, the malts appear to offer naught but a softening effect on the overall texture. As it finishes there's a moment of pink grapefruit and orange citrus but it's totally dry. It either has to be a lot crisper or offer more flavor diversity to excel in its category."
"Appearance is a light yellow with a thin white head, looks like a pilnser to me ! The smell also has a lightness to it along with a very faint citrus element. Upon sipping it, it tastes like some fresh baked bread, not bad. Mouthfeel is great for a pilsner, with more pleasure involved than most others in this style. Drinkability is most certainly here; 1. it is a pilsner 2. it is a very good pilsner."
"Drinkability: Lacking a sourness I was looking for, but otherwise large in flavor. I could definitely fill up on these, but I may get a bit bored. Also, heavier than you'd think for a pils."
"I think this would make a nice transitional beer from BMC to a pale wheat ale or even a pale ale. It looks like BMC but adds more to the table."
"I was hoping for more from this one. Not bad, and a fair take on the style, but not really one I'll make a point of getting again. Some interesting stuff going on, but not quite the complexity or crisp bite that I was hoping for. I wouldn't turn it down if it were the only pilsner option, and I was really craving a pilsner... but the chance of those two coinciding is fairly slim."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I was really expecting more from this beer. The beer though lack is complexity and truly lacks in the crisp fresh feeling I want from a nice Pils. I would say it's worth a try if you can find a single bottle. However, if you have to get a six pack look for another Pils out there."
"The same brewery that makes Old Rasputin makes this beer as well??? Oy vey. I have to say, I didn't like this at all. I hope I just got an old bottle or something. Picked up a single of this because of the cool looking label and I like pilseneres so it seemed like a good idea. Pours a yellow color with ZERO head.. and I mean zero, like I haven't seen anything like it.. no lacing either (obviously). Taste is kind of sour and doesn't have a good mouthfeel at all.. had this following a Prima Pils and the difference was very apparent. Would not prefer to try again, like I said I hope it was just a bad bottle I got."
"D- If it didn't drink well, this beer would be more of a looker than a drinker"
"I have not been a big fan of pilsners as they most remind me of the BMC days. Scrimshaw has a lot of flavor and while it is not complex, per se, it has some things going on. This is a damn solid beer and one I will pick up when the weather gets warmer. Great value as well."
"The creamy feel and sweetness of the beer kills any more refined Pils malt flavor involved however. It's present but subdued to say the least. In the end an orangey sweetness overtakes and limits drinkability. A bit drying and harsh in a raw grain sense."
"I picked this up because the weather was unseasonably warm and a pilsner sounded just right. I can't say I was disappointed with this one, however, it doesn't quite stack up to victory prima pils."
"D- Great beer for activities and hot weather. Quenching yet flavorful for the style. Aftertaste is clean and not too long lasting, so you can keep reaching for another."
"Drinkability: Most everything about this beer was exceptional, with the exception of the oh so important taste. Not sure exactly what the off flavor was, but it was enough to ruin this beer for me."
"Poured from a fat squat North Coast 12oz bottle. The beer is slightly hazy pale yellow color, 3 finger foam. The smell is toasted malt, grainy malt, all malt. The taste is likewise strong with bisuit and toasted malt, a little bitterness but not much. Very tasty but I'd like a little more hops in it."
" ~ This is a solid brew. One I would recommend to my friends. It has a character and pizazz that most pilsners struggle to find."
"This is a superior pilsener, worth seeking out."
"Notes: This is not a beer to sit and ponder over, exploring different flavors and feelings. This is a beer to enjoy while eating, cooking, or hanging out. Definitely a good choice when you're looking for a flavorful beer without the heaviness of something better (better being opinion only, obviously)."
"Shimmering golden with stead carbonation and a decent fluffy white head that fades quickly. Smell is solid with a good earthy hop character and lightly sweet scent of bready malt. Great taste that is well balanced and has pretty big flavor for such a small beer. Light grain and light sweetness. Again, earthy hop presence and biscuity bread. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, very refreshing. I could session this one with ease. Just an overall great beer that I wouldn't mind savoring again, maybe a little closer to the summer."
"D: Decent drinkable pilsner with some hoppiness keeps things interesting throughout the course of the drink"
"Two fingers of head atop a golden sunshine, pilsner yellow. Good center column of bubbling beneath a solid film o' foam. The aroma is a soft, herbal grass and mint note in the aroma. Along with the dry malt aromas as well. Clear palate helps creat definition between the super dry, toasted sweet malts with the herbal,grassy hops. The palae is dry and hoppy for this German pilsner. Very rich, malty finish for this pils. OK drinkability. Maybe a little bit better if it wasn't for the dry sweetness."
"Out of a bottle this ""German Style Pilsener"" was a perfectly clear, bright gold color with a pure white head. Poor retention and weak lacing. The aroma was mostly clean, pale malt and some hints of sweetness in floral hops. The flavors were at first very malty, with some dry grain notes hiding in the beginning as well. It then got more hoppy as it went on leading to a crisp finish. Nothing too deep about it but pleasant enough. The body was medium/light, the carbonation lively on the tongue and the mouthfeel a little prickly as a result. An OK beer, but one of the weaker offering from this world class brewery."
"D- something i will seek out this summer, its absolutely refreshing even on a cold winters night."
"An exceptionally drinkable brew and overall a nice pilsener, but nothing mind-blowing or extraordinary. A superb session beer, though a little more dry bitterness would be welcome."
"A go-to beer for many cuisines and many occasions. Fantastic."
"D: A good beer from North Coast, I liked it, nice drinkable pilsner beer."
"I could've had quite a few of these tonight."
"Tastes like pale malts, then moves into a spicier profile with a hint of citrus (grapefruit?) before finishing with hops. Carbonation is just right, with a nice creamy mouthfeel."
"For this type of Pilsner, I'd rather have a Brooklyn. And this doesn't compare to a Victory Prima Pils."
"D: Imminently drinkable."
"This beer was incredibly easy to drink, and if it were cheap, I would but it constantly. As it is though, I would not pay the price it sells."
"Light straw color with a medium white head. Aroma is grassy, lightly floral, a touch spicy. The flavor is light - mild and well-balanced. Creamy mouthfeel, lightly fruity - almost apricots - with a dry but not crisp finish. For the most part it is enjoyable, but certainly not a favorite."
"Pours a light golden color with a small off-white head. Smell is yeasty, with a hint of hay, and an ever so slight whiff of sulfur. Taste is wonderful, light bready malt, with a taste of fresh cut grass in the finish. Fantastic bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation levels slightly high. Drinkability is off the charts, relatively low ABV, and light flavor make this a great beer to have when drinking more than one at a time! One of my favorite Pilsener's for sure."
"Very light gold in color on the pour. A little froth, but it's quickly gone before a second sip. Smell is slightly hoppy, but pretty floral and somewhat spicy. Taste is more of the spice, some lemon and some slight hops. This is absolutely wonderful on draft. Much better than I was expecting. Very good pilsener, maybe one of the better that I've had."
"Really nice beer to drink. Well done. Not much to talk about on the appearance, nor the smell, however. I would say that the taste is simple, balanced, and well done. A very solid pilsener, certainly worth the buy. North Coast brewing ompany scores well here. Delicious on the palate, and leaves you much inclined towards another."
"Bottle: Poured a dark golden color pils with a huge pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of Noble hops is more dominant then expected with a clean malt profile. Taste is also a mix between clean and lightly sweet malt profile with some distinctive dry Noble hops. Full body with some good carbonation. A bit hoppier then I was expected but still very enjoyable."
"Prost!"
"Pours a hazy and somewhat dull gold with some large chunks of yeast that settles quickly. A soft white head is medium in size and leaves some lacing as it drops,no bonus points for hang time here. The nose is subtly sweet and smells of fresh grains and some nice earthy aromas. This has good flavor for a Pils,grainy pale malts and some fresh dry hop flavors compliment each other nicely. Slight metallic flavors kept me from giving it a better grade. The body is light to medium with good carbonation and nice clean slightly drying finish. A good old easy drinkin Pils,I'll have another."
"The taste is as above with bread, toasted crackers, lemon, a hint of grapefruit, honey, and a little vanilla, esp. in the finish. It's very clean and easy to drink, zesty and fairly lively with strong, persistent character that stays interesting."
"D - This is what macros should strive for. You can have this anywhere with anything."
"drinkability is perhaps the highest i've ever drank.. tastes great, goes down smooth, just a touch of hop on the clean finish just asks for another taste."
"North Cost presents an excellent example of what a pilsner can be. This one is very refreshing, and worthy of sharing with the buddies. Scrimshaw certainly is a candidate for enticing the more timid over to the craft movement. Bring enough to accompany any activity during a warm Summer day"
"This is a really good beer. To say I'm pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The color is a brightish golden topped with a very nice frothy white head. There ends up being a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly malty with grassy and grainy notes with some fruitiness to it. This might be one of the best tasting Pilsners I've ever had. It is crisp, a little sweet with a great blend of malts and hops. A hint of a lemon zing is mixed in. Nothing seems out of place. Clean, smooth and very refreshing. This would be a great choice for an everyday beer you don't get sick of. A true winner!"
"Edit: I had this beer on tap at North Coast's own taproom and the flavor came through a bit better this time for me."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking great beer for anytime. ALL DAY LONG"
"A pleasant pilsener. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I can see how on a very hot day it's a welcome change of pace."
"Drinkability is moderate. Definitely sessionalbe and decent flavor, but just boring."
"This was on tap at The Desmond Hotel where my fiancee (heretofore known as ""the wife"") and I will be having our reception in October. I decided I must try it after wedding person at the hotel mentioned it in the list of beer available. I'm looking forward to having this along with the Yuengling and Sam Adams that will be available at our open bar."
"Recommended..."
"Drinkability is somewhat ok. I've had better pilseners though."
"Lots of flavor here, with a pale malt base and herbal, spicy hop accompaniment. The texture is also smooth and surprisingly creamy for the style. There is a good deal to like here. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy orangeish hue, similar to alot of hefe's out there. Has a nice sized head that dissipates quickly, but the beer still has healthy carbonation. Smell is surprising, with it being a pilsner one would think that it would be more hoppy, but there is alot of malty sweetness that comes through, almost dominates. Taste is smooth, has a slight tanginess to it on the tounge, but then becomes smooth. pretty good beer all around."
"D - It's a so-so German Pils."
"D - Unfortunately, the buttery presence detracts from my overall enjoyment of this pils. It really hinders the crispness of this brew, in my opinion. It's not bad, but I don't think I'll go out of my way for another."
"Notes: A perfectly drinkable but fairly average American pils."
"Mid gold with a frothy head and a great brewery smell that makes this beer unique. This is well made pils with a crispness combined with a certain breadiness in the mid body. I could drink a bunch of these in the summer time. This does not taste like every other pilsner which is a selling point"
"The mouthfeel is fairly thin, with less carbonation bite that I would have expected. This is not a bad beer, but there are better pilsners out there."
"light mouthfeel, easily one of the most drinkable beers i have had to date, this is my new go to summer beer."
"D: Definitely drinkable, could have a few of these. North Coast continues to impress."
"Scrimshaw pours slightly hazy golden color with a bit of an amber tint to it, and a cap of fine white bubbles. Lightly grainy and toasted with some herbal floral and spicy hops. Same in the taste. Pleasantly bready, lightly toasted, bit of spicy bitterness. Mellow and lightly crisp, medium with a solid amount of lightly sharp, fresh carbonation. Pretty good for the style."
"Served a crisp yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was some Earthy hops slightly overpowering sweet malts. The taste was a nice balance of sweet malts and crisp hops. The beer is light, crisp and very Summery. This is a very decent Pilsner, one I would have again if the mood hit."
"D: The taste more than makes up for this beer's unattractive appearance. North Coast did a very nice job with the style. Low ABV makes it super drinkable. I would happily revisit this one."
"Enjoyed on tap at Mahaffey's in Baltimore. Hallertauer and Tettnang hops, that impart a light bitterness that feels higher. Creamy, easy drinking above-average for the style.Nothing to look at, neutral aroma. Fresh, crisp but a bit drying. Abou right carbonation."
"This started out well, a very good-looking beer. Gold, thick white head, good lacing. Nice floral, outdoorsy aroma. The taste was pretty much all piney hops, way too much so. Not very crisp or refreshing. I've enjoyed other pilseners more. My wife, however, liked this beer a lot."
"Pours transparent honey-gold with an inch or so of rapidly dissolving head. Leaves a good layer of foam and lacing. Smells grassy and a bit minty, with an unpleasant metallic & coppery edge. The light grainy flavor develops into honey notes in the center. Finishes with restrained hop dryness, mint, and copper overtones. Body is faintly heavy, a bit oily and viscous in the mouth. A yeoman-like effort."
"12oz stubby bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with a really nice two finger white head that sticks around forever. The aroma is slightly floral with some citrusy hops. The taste is a touch of malt with some faint citrus hops in the finish. Overall, Scrimshaw Pilsner is a pretty nice thirst quencher to enjoy on a hot summer day. Worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Crisp and clean in the mouth, with a somewhat drying finish(but only drying to the bitter receptors of the palate, the rest of the mouth is left quite refreshed and quenched.). The beer is light on the palate with spritzy carbonation. This is one I'll be glad to buy again, though I think I'll try to get my hands on some more before coming back to this one. Overall a great brew, one you should not pass up, definitely worth a try...however it is not going to be my ""house pils"" still searching for that....perhaps I'll give Prima Pils a second try."
"A very smooth drink with a substantial body for the style, the beer has nice carbonation and superb drinkability."
"What can be said, very drinkable. With a lower abv. Anytime! Good job with this beer. Top shelf quality."
"The pour is clean, the smell is clean and the taste follows suit accordingly. Its slightly dry in the finish and the taste itself is slightly citrusy and that of very light malt. Nothing over the top, just a refreshing beer with that nice carbonation that dances a bit on your tongue."
"Drinkable, but seems somewhat off, can't quite place it."
"I felt this was a very drinkable beer, just what I was looking for on this warm day in Vegas. I'll enjoy this one again for sure."
"M/D - Almost chewy feel in the mouth. Medium bodied and well carbonated. One of the better pilseners I have had."
"A nice beer from North Coast."
"This is a very nice pilsner beer, and quite a bit sweeter and more medium bodied than is characteristic for the style. The beer pours a nice golden color with a slightly frothy head that does retain. The smell is a very typical musty lager aroma, with a faint hint of hops. The taste is quite sweet for a pilsner. There is a lemony citrus flavor to this beer, and nice biscuity malt base, some slight hop tastes in the finish where things dry out a bit more. The aftertaste is a bit thin and insubstantial, and I knocked the beer down a point for that, but there is a slight creamy mouthfeel that more than compensates. This is a very drinkable pilsner worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"I was disappointed by this one overall. North Coast generally puts out some good to very good stuff and the Scrimshaw just wasn't up to par with that or with the best from within the style. It just blends in as average amongst a sea of Pilsners."
"Pours a bit darker than any average pils. Smells of red apples, and yeasty background with malts. Hops actually dominate the palate, with a grassy style but not completely overwhelming the palate. The malts play a fairly good role on the background, which balances the beer. A good pils."
"The taste is malty through the drink with a crisp clean finish of bitterness of the hops. In the mouth you are left with some malt on the tongue. One of the better American Pilsner's I have had. Another solid effort from North Coast."
"Scrimshaw Pilsner pours a crystal clear golden with a nice head. The aroma is sweet light malt and some graininess. The flavor is crisp and smooth with a nice light bitterness and hop flavor. This is definitely a nice session beer and could easily be a training wheels beer for a BMC drinker."
"M/D: Easy drinking, lower ABV makes this a beer that I can make a session. Does not have the typical sharp pils feel, but, it's nice none the less."
"Mouthfeel is pretty average. Plenty of carbonation and a semi-crisp finish."
"See this all the time at the store and have never tried it, decided to finally give it a go, not my favorite beer from North Coast but not bad for its style, might drink again"
"Drinkability: An nice light easy drinking beer. Would be good in the summer (or a warm spring day). Low ABV and very sessionable. I got two bottles as part of a mixed six pack. I would buy this again."
"The Scrimshaw didn't blow me away. As I said, it was simply too thin in the taste department. Not a terrible beer, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Poured a light gold/yellow color with a very slight haze to it. Had nice white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is of grain and noble hops. This beer is malty with a subtle hop flavor and delivers a crisp, clean finish. Lacing on glass was minimal. Drinkability was quite high."
"D: Butter. These are too easy to drink."
"Quite disappointed by this North Coast offering. In short, it poured, smelled tasted and lingered like a highly-advertised, poorly brewed BMC lager. Grainy nose and taste, with few redeeming points. Might make an okay thirst quencher if served very cold on a very hot day, but I doubt that I'll try to find out."
"This wasn't bad, but expect a smoother less hops type pilsner."
"Drinkability is good. Not the best Pilsner I've had, but this is still a tasty and easy to drink beer. Will have to revisit this one when the heat of Redding returns..."
"Had this tonight at Mellow Mushroom. Good pils appearance, light golden, moderate head retention. Smells a little hoppy for a German pils. Flavors are good, light creamy, but as mentioned a little on the hoppy side for me. I like this beer, drank well. For a German Pils though, a little too sticky and hoppy and not creamy and malty enough, side by side with a Paulaner Pils for example will explain what I'm saying...notheless a highly drinkable session beer."
"Bottom line, this is a session beer. Very drinkable and crisp. In fact, I drank it while the Giants beat the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII!! Anyway, it pours a clear golden color, small-medium head, with a small amount of lace. Good carbonation throughout the drink, which made it very drinkable and great with food. Typical Pilsner taste, perhaps a little milder, but definitely worth stocking your fridge with. Although it's January in Chicago, I can imagine drinking this beer in June-July while flipping burgers on the grill! Definitely buy this one!"
"Light gold pour with a nice thick bright white head and significant lacing as I drink. Smell is fresh, clean, slightly malty and a bit more hoppy. Taste is smooth, clean, with a mild hop flavor. There isn't a big bitter bite, like in a lot of pilsners, but it is simple and refreshing. A touch of hops and sweetness in the finish. A great easy drinking session beer. I really like this one, even though its not exactly what I'd expect in a pilsner."
"Little to no malt flavor with some citrus notes that quickly fade. The carbonic bite overpoweres anything else that might be here. Almost an Alka-Seltzer taste on the finish but still drinkable. Very high dollar for the beer in my opinion. I'm not a Pils guy and this has convinced me to stay of that persuassion. If you're thinking of this one, you can get a Miller Lite for 25% of the money."
"A decent beer that would be alright for session drinking but otherwise unmemorable. If this was on-tap, I'd view it as a safe session pitcher to share with less adventurous friends."
"Edit: Wow.. this really is pretty good... reminds me a lot of Paulaner Pils."
"I normally don't prefer too much of the lighter stuff, but this one is pretty good actually. It's smooth and even and extremely drinkable. Bottom line. I'd say this beer is more of the kind that you would get a case of for a party or the weekend and just relax and drink. It doesn't have the type of characteristics or personality that would make it a unique or interesting brew to check out."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, not much of a kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer if you want something mild. However, I normally look for something stronger and when I do want something mild, I typically won’t for a beer that’s as pricy as this one tends to be."
"On the drinkability scale, this pilsner scores very high with me. I could easily settle on this pint after pint. I've already recommended it to my friends."
"It's an easy drinking pils. I would have liked to see a touch more hop presence, but not bad as it is. It does have a nice, refreshing quality to it."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with small fizzy white head that disappears quickly for the most part but leaves a small amount present on top for a while. Aroma is of bready malt, fruit, and hops which are citrusy and slightly fruity. Taste is slightly sweet at the front quickly giving way to hops. The hops are slightly spicy and are fairly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium and it is an easy drinker. Decent pilsner that would be a nice session beer in the summer."
"Feels bubbly and fizzy, like champagne. It's a sipper. Once the bubbles go away it feels dry. Not an amazing beer. A bit simple. Has a decent flavor with some frut, but too spiky for this Advocate to love."
"There are a lot of great beers out there, but I wouldnt include this one among them based on this experience. Not recommended."
" Quite drinkable, good beer, slightly off for the style."
"not bitter at all; sweet and with some tealike hop flavor. the hops take on a spicy character, as well. a tasty german pils"
"I picked this up on a whim at one of the local Beerporiums, and I definitely don't regret it. It poured with little to no head and a nice dark straw color and smells a little bready with a hint of malts. The flavor is very smooth with a little malt bite but very little bitterness and a pleasantly unobtrusive aftertaste. It is a very drinkable beer with a very pleasant carbonation, and if it fit the budget I wouldn't mind drinking this one all night. Not exactly full-bodied and flavorful, but excels in drinkability and mouthfeel. A nice light beer perfect for a relaxing summer day."
"Pours a hazy golden sunshine. This beer smells like a beer, it's a beery beer smell. A cross between Miller High Life and St. Pauli Girl. Tastes a little creamier and fuller than a european pilsner. I like it. It has a wide mouthfeel, a shot of hops, and well carbonated. If you like the North Coast offerings, you wont be dissapointed with this one."
"Quite dry with a crisp carbonation. Has a clean finish with very little aftertaste. Pretty good. Quite refreshing and easy to drink. Kind of a departure from the pils I'm used to, but it's not bad. I would drink it again, but probably won't buy a whole sixer."
"drinkable?: sure, not enjoyable but drinkable for sure."
"A servicable german style pils which tastes a bit like an ale and it decent but there are better examples out there."
"D: Very high."
"Color is a clear straw yellow, rather like a typical American lager, not impressive. Aroma is remarkably strong, overwhelmingly malty, with a whisper of citrus. Flavor is rich, malty, a touch of lemon or lime, not complex but very nice. Smooth, with a bit of a hoppy bite, it is a refreshing pilsener."
"to be balanced just perfectly. An awesome pilsner!"
"I've come to shy away from Pilsners and the like lately but I thought I'd give this one a try. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy, yellow-orange golden color with a thin bubbly head that has lots of carbonation rising from the depths of the glass. Smell is primarily malt, a slight sweetness of lighter grains and subtle hints of honey and a slight skunkiness; the hopping is pretty nondistinct. The taste is very similar to the nose with the difference being that the skunkiness of the beer is much more pronounced and there is a slight hop presence in the form of a finishing bitterness. Mouthfeel is light with a dry finish and slightly mouth burning carbonation. Drinkability of this beer is hurt by the skunkiness. I suspect that the single beer I have is probably far past the ""best by"" date although since there isn't a date on the bottle its hard to determine. Overall, another disappointing Pils."
"I thought something was missing in the taste, though... I know Pilsners are relatively mild as they are one of my favorite types of beers. But at least most pilsners have more hops or at least notes of something else that separates them from others. Notes of citrus and grass for example. At least those are the types of Pilsners I'm drawn to drink. This one seemed too bland for my tastes. Perhaps i've been spoiled by the Eagle Pride Pilsner of my local brewpub and other solid examples? I must be more of a traditional Pils kind of guy..."
"This poured up a golden straw colour, but had a bit of chill haze to it and actually appeared to be a bit cloudy. Perhaps it was just the chill haze. Smell was slightly bready with some very mild spicy hop aromas. Everything in the smell was very gentle and mild. Pleasant. Taste, to was quite mild and ""soft", I guess you could say. Some may call this lifeless and dull, but every now and then, I rather enjoy a beer that is less than 10% abv and doesn't taste like pine resin and grapefruit juice. Mouthfeel is very slightly ""fuller"" than your average pilsener which I wasn't really a fan of. Other than that, this was fairly drinkable."
"This is one simple and easy drinking beer yet it holds such simple complexities it makes it very fun to drink."
"Despite the lackluster mouthfeel I enjoy the taste enough that I would order this beer if I saw it on tap but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to buy it retail again."
"I liked this offering, even though it doesn't best represent the style, it is traditional and well-balanced. Clarity is its strong point, and the nose is clean. Refreshing and easy to drink. I would drink this again, mostly if I wasn't paying for it. Recommended."
"I like this beer quite a bit, but don't think that you are getting a German style or Traditional Pilsner because your not."
"D - This is a very good american pilsner. Nice hops."
"A very American version of a pilsner. The hops are a little bigger than normal and very fruity as opposed to spicy and earthy. Theres a mellow pale malt backbone that doesnt match a Euro pilss flavor, but is nice nevertheless. Basically a light and hoppy beer for the summer, maybe a lawnmower beer with hops."
"D: I enjoyed this quite a bit. The low level of bitterness would make this a great session beer."
"Drinking this beer cold poured into a snifter. The beer is a bright yet slightly hazy gold in the glass. A bleached white surface layer forms and quickly fades to an edge layer. Aroma is grainy and some herbal hops but relatively mild. First sip reveals an average body with fine crisp carbonation. flavor is again grainy malt and some caramel. The beer is clean and slightly sweet with limited herbal hops. No hint of ABV anywhere. Easy drinker, clean and simple. Not bad."
"I think the nuttier flavor and less sweetness makes this more drinkable than other pilseners I've had."
"Taste of a light malt backbone with lemon and hard candy (Napoleon candy). This beer is so light, but not in a pilsener way, more like a light blond beer. For sure it has nothing to do with a German pilsener. The yeast give very little character and is quite clean. Hardly any bitter in the beer and aftertaste is dry and refreshing."
"This is what I expect a good pilsner to taste like! Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pilsner glass. The beer pours a pale gold, forming a fluffy white head, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is of light hops, and a little grain. The taste is a nice balance of hop flavoring, and malt thickness. Only a slight grainy flavor. Smooth light mouthfeel. I dont usually drink lighter beers, but when I do, this is they way I want them to taste. Very light and refreshing. A great offering from North Coast. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall this is a nice and generally refreshing pilsner. A bit hoppier and more carbonated than I would like, however, and the taste wasn't the most interesting. It's certainly worth trying, though I probably won't get this again (it's too expensive!)."
"An odd, ill-defined brew. Not bad but not great."
"D: Pretty drinkable. A fine example of a German Pilsener."
"Mouthfeel holds its own, but is not great. Considering the state of other domestic pilseners this is excellent. Light body and very drinkable. Slightly dry finish, but very clean. This would make a good summer beer. Recommended."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden honey , with a decent whiter head - nose of oatmeal , mild hops , bubblegum , salt , dried bananas , and barley  taste of citrus hopps , lemon zest , slightly sweet , and honey - body refreshing , and slightly acidic , with medium carbonation  aftertaste of lemon zest , and hops , dry and clean"
"A tasty little Pilsner. Crisp hops and sweet malts. This one would probably go well on a hot day."
"Great drinkability, easy to session due to the low abv, yet full of great pils flavor. Had this before & it didn't impress me. I think finally came across some that's fresh (no packaging dates to verify this). Maybe a little pricey @$7.99 a sixer, but worth a look, I'd say this compares favorably with many german & czech competitors"
"Pours a golden orange yellow with a medium white head. The head,though small,leaves very good lacing. The smell has floral and sweet malt along with a ""bisquity"" aroma. The taste is crisp with floral,sweet malt, hops, and bread yeast. A real good pilsner with flavor and body. The m/f is light and the flavors mix very well. A damn good beer that could be an everyday summer brew."
"A decent all around pilsner. Thirst quenching."
"Scrimshaw Pilsner, brewed by North Coast Brewing Co. of Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout fame, is a very solid German Pilsener. It pours a nice hazy gold with a big creamy head that eventually settles down leaving a fair bit of hazing. It's got a hoppy nose with a bit of citrus and floral notes. The flavor is even better. It's got a dry, slightly sweet malty flavor up front before the hops come in and really makes itself known in the finish. It's definitely got a crisp hop flavor. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin as is expected of a Pilsener. No complaints here. It's a very drinkable, well balanced beer. One of the few I'd call truly refreshing."
"The body is light with a dry finish that isn't too chalky. A somewhat higher carbonation feel but helps with the bitterness taste. Overall a easy beer that has a crisp finish. But I would suggest to not drink it from a whales hollowed out bones."
"Pours a pale amber colr with a huge high head the slowly comes down with some, very little lace. Smell is earthy, maybe some caramel in there, corn even. Taste was very malt, with a slight dry hop finish. Some nuttiness maybe. Perfectly carbonated, and an easy drinker. Could probaly do a few of these, though I wouldn't really seek it out. Good pilsner though."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin bodied. Very minimal carbonation was present. Some zestiness when held in the mouth. I would try this again only if I could determine the freshness."
"Pours a hazy gold with a minimal, delicately white head. Much more cloudy than most pilsners. Aroma is rather subdued, with clean, slightly salty and vegetal hops backed by some spicy dextrine malts. Not terribly appetizing. On the palate, way too sweet on the mid-palate before a drier, vegetal finish comes in. This beer is just OK. Drinkable, unoffensive, but not the flavor party I was hoping for."
"D- This beer has a nice balance of malt and hops with some interesting depth to the malt. It would be nice to have a bit more flavor or depth to the hops to make them a bit more interesting."
"D- very drinkable, some good flavor in there, i'd have another down the road if i were curious another than that, I'm happy saying that i tried it."
"D: Very easy to drink. It's well-crafted, slips past the palate and tongue with laid-back charm."
"12 oz. stubby served in a pils glass. It pours a lightly-hazed golden/yellow with light carbonation and an inch of white head that doesn't leave much lacing. The aroma is pleasant with lemony, almost perfumy hops and a touch of grape. The flavor disappoints, however, with little more than minty or piney hops that don't impart much bitterness on top of a light, almost prickly body that leaves a short finish. Definitely some room for improvement on this one."
"Looks like dirty orange juice, perhaps a mimosa gone wrong. Little head, little lacing. Murky. Scary. Nose is not so icky. Lemon, malts, but something is off in here. Taste is reminiscent of spoiled fruit and rotting garbage. There's still some good in there but you have to sift through the sludge to get there. Mouthfeel is watery and thin. Drinkability is... not so much. This beer and I did not get along."
"from the bottle, poured light honey, with a off white head. aroma, yeast , hops, malts, lemon, citrus, sugar. flavor, weak, got some citrus, a little sweetness kind of tasted like very weak lemonaide. was a clean finish and easy to drink. a little on the watery side"
"This is a great easy drinking pils for the hot days of summer. IMO its EXTREMELY sessionable (I could chug this baby no problem, but why waste such tasty beer?), but it's a bit on the uncomplicated side, and that makes it slightly less interesting to me. As much as I like it, it could be better if they gave it a bit more depth of character and a fuller mouthfeel."
"Light bodied, decently carbonated, easy to drink and refreshing."
"Scrimshaw Pilsner pours a golden color with a thick fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. At first I got a whiff of malt, followed by some mildly floral hops. Crisp and nicely balanced malt and hop flavor. I could drink this all night, definitely sessionable. Recommended."
"Pours transparent golden with white head the recedes quickly. Aroma is mostly floral hops, not bitter, but lots of hop flavor with a good malt flavor. Medium-light body. This would make a good session beer, plenty of flavor with low alcohol content. This is an above average beer, worth trying."
"I'll be brief with this one. IMO, pils have a very narrow flavor profile -- you either get it or you don't. This, er... don't. I found the flavor weak and a bit off. The appearance is nice, a bit deeper gold than most, and the body is appropriately crisp and light, but in the end, alas, it just didn't happen. Great brewery, mediocre offering."
"I don't get into the hot weather cold light beer dark mishmash way of thinking of when how to drink a beer. You're the mouth and the bottle is the servant. You drink it when you want to. Then again maybe you don't. I only drink them to do reviews seeing as 95% of the stuff I've tried I never will again. Anyway this is citrus drop on a bronze platter. As the bottle banner pronounces, you won't rip your sails on this one and the whales will swim next to your paddle boat sometimes leaping across the rigging and smiling in sync with your tangy pils and your laughing kisser."
"very refreshing, drinkable beer that won't wallop you."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Bold white frothy head, had to really take my time pouring this one. It leaves a satisfying lace on the glass. Very active carbonation, bubbles dance the entire time. Color is a clear golden yellow. Smell is biscuity and floral with a slight lemon note, a very nice blend. Taste is bready malt up front but finishes with more floral and lemon. It's nice to have a pilsner with some hops characteristics. Mouthfeel is very crisp with the carbonation. A light to medium body. Finishes dry. This is most definately a hot weather beer, very refreshing."
"Overall and amazing beer. Great complexity of flavor and aroma unlike any in this catagorie I have had before. One of my alltime favorite Pilsners."
"Fits the profile of a continental pils better than German, with a delicious malt profile and hops that are pleasant but not too bitter. Quite a drinkable beer, in any case."
"Overall I really like this beer when I am looking for an easy drinking lager. A local brew pub sells quite a bit of this and it is usually my lager choice there when I dont feel like an ale. Although this is not nearly as complex as Budvar or Urquell it is a really nice American style pilsner for a warm day."
"Overall: A nice rendition of the style and quite refreshing. The drinkability is extremely high on this brew. I still haven't had a North Coast brew that I wasn't completely satisfied with. Another great brew!"
"Pours a hazy gold color with a bright white head that fades fast at first, and settles to a thin white collar. Aroma is sweet malts, with hints of grain, pear, and a slight hoppy note. Taste begins with some sweet malt, some hops are there, but not enough to overpower. Finish dry and clean mild malt aftertaste. Pretty carbonated compared to what I normally drink, but also very balanced. This beer goes down as smooth as anything I've ever had....perfect summer time beer!!!"
"This is an outstanding example of a pilsener that has body and substance that most macrobrewers don't capture. It has a light, crisp, smooth finish that is very clean and tasty. It makes for an excellent warm weather session beer. The North Coast products have only been available in my area for a few months and I'm very glad to have them. I have enjoyed many styles of excellent beers from this brewery."
"Overall, a no frills beer. quite drinkable beer with nice flavors. seems like a nice one when you want a lighter beer with nice malt character."
"A definitely West-Coast interpretation of the style that holds on to some of what I've come to expect, but has a definite character of its own. Stands up better to pairing than some other pilsners I've tried - did very well with barbecued chicken, baked beans and boiled red potatoes."
"Dnot a bad pilsner at all, very mild and a good transition beer, perhaps, would also be good for a pool party."
"The is a pretty pilsner that pours with a lot of foam that leaves lace and a sustaining head...but looks can be deceiving. The nose has a decent bit of toasted grains, but the hops are lacking and mouthfeel is a little rough and grainy. I'm glad I tried it, as I like the other North Coast beers, but I'm just not impressed with this one."
"Drinkability: Exciting stuff. For a pilsner."
"This is not a huge heady brew to get your head around; but this is a tremendously drinkable beer with firm characteristics, a great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation."
"Cloudy, orangey yellow with an extremely thin scumy head. Smells light and slightly bready, faintly floral--german hops here? Not too spicy, but a little. Maybe I'm just hoping... Taste slightly booring, little hops. A similar malt profile to brooklyn pilsner. Overcarbonated, and has watery finish, but yes slightly spicy in the hop profile. Am I tasting an alcohol wash in this low abv of a beer? Yuck. If this is what most people think of from a german pilsner, no wonder most people don't care for them. This is okay, but I won't return. I can see a few people liking this, but there is far better out there, for a style that to me is so enchanting when done right."
"On a hot day I could drink these all day."
"Scrimshaw drinks easily enough, pretty soft -- not nearly as spritzy as some Pilsners are wont to be -- simple and pleasing."
"North Coast just continues to produce excellent brews."
"Definitely better cold. Decent drinkability."
"Poured a darker gold than I expected for a Pils. Clear and clean-looking with mild carbonation and a medium white head. The aroma was hoppy and malty, a little more intense than the Pilsners I'm used to. The taste was a combination of floral hops and sweet roasted malts. It wasn't terribly bitter but unfortunately wasn't as dry as I would have liked either; sweet up front, slightly watery and bland in the aftertaste. I was waiting for that crisp, dry hoppiness of a good European Pils, but got what I've come to expect from American interpretations of the style. I'm not saying that these attempts aren't good beers, they can be. My particular taste prefers the drier, hoppier Czech or German Munich-Lager styles. I am doing my best in my search of a good American Pils to rate what I taste objectively. That having been said, this was a decent attempt and a pretty drinkable beer."
"The mouth is nicely crisp with a bit of a snap. Very easy drinker that goes great with mild food."
"overall, a nice refreshing pilsner, not the most exceptional i've had but certainly something worth trying."
"Low abv. Tasty. Super easy to drink. Session beer!! Hell yeah. I could drink a lot of these. I will drink a lot of these now that I can buy them in Council Bluffs, IA. Score! Ive like about everything Ive had from North Coast, add this to the list. I am sure this beer would kill with fish and chips or burgers or anything spicy. I am happy I finally tried this. Purchased in Council Bluffs, IA; I will buy more."
"I love what American breweries are doing with pilseners, and this is another great example."
"drinkability: Nothing off about this beer, but it lacks hop and malt character. Still, easy to drink. Could've been a good summer sipper, but I doub't I'll be revisiting this one."
"Poured a cloudy deep golden color with virtually no head, however the thin ring left attractive lacing as the beer was consumed. Smell is fruity and lemony and very nice. Taste is of ripe summer fruit with a very pleasant sweetness. Finish is mainly malty with a very slight dryness present. An enjoyable brew. Very nice for a hot spring afternoon."
"D - A nice, easy drinking pilsner. Certainly sessionable. Not the tops, but still pretty damn enjoyable."
"Typical pilsner. Not bad. Crisp and refreshing. Enjoyable but nothing to yell about."
"Nah, not for me."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is a nice light bodied well carbonated beer. This is a very drinkable and sessionable beer. Overall not a bad little pilsner."
"An underrated beer and extremely underrated style. North Coast has created an above average pilsner and certainly worth checking out."
"Poured a very slightly hazed , goldenrod-yellow with a bubbly white head. Smell is of the malts , also some slightly spicy / herbal hop aromas. Taste is focused on the malts at first , pale malt , clean , hops provide a nice , crisp , straw and grass flavor that finishes very clean. Mouthfeel is light. A very drinkable German pilsener , not quite as much an effervecent showcase as many , but very drinkable and nice hop profile."
"Opinion: I really enjoy this Pilsner, and think that it rivals some of the best German brews. It has a smooth and uncomplicated malt profile, and the hopping is sufficient to balance the beer and add more complexity. I will definitely be drinking this beer again."
"This beer pours a foggy lager-like straw yellow with a hint of peach and a porous white head that left a little lace. Smells of coconut, cantaloupe and honey with a slight nip of dryness. Starts with a dry nip of earthy hops and then flows into a strong honey with a strange taste of roses and a hint of oranges. Finishes dry with a strawberry sweetness. After a few seconds, theres a dry pasty marshmallow flavor lingering on my tongue. Mouth feel is medium with a small, sharp carbonation. The garden flower feel of this beer is really surprising, unique and deliciously drinkable."
"I suppose this could be slightly aged. I can't tell because there's no readable date. There's a code inked on the bottom of the bottle reading ""116 A-2 0831"" August 31...what? There is nothing really ""pilsnery"" about this beer. It's ok, but nothing to write home about."
"Definitely worth a try or a six pack. If it is the only micro available, definitely get it!"
"Foggy off-yellow, pale off-white head. Pleasant aroma of lightly toasted wheat bread, and some left coast hops. Lemony, oily slick and a bit pastylemon tea and crisp hop flavorings. Bitter noble hops become predominately noticeable in the body; a touch and go feeling of some grounded black pepper on the palate. Decent carbonation, pretty well balanced, the nice herbal west coast hops round this one of nicely. North Coast once again deliversthis is a fine product."
"Scrimshaw is bright golden, with just a bit of haze. Carbonation is high. Head is large and thick. Aroma is of sweet, mildly grainy malt with an edge of herbal hop. Taste is of light bready malt with touches of grain. Plenty of noble hop flavor is the highlight here, not very bitter, but just bracing enough for my tastes. Drinkability is great, this is a session beer for sure."
" It's been a while since i've had this classic. So much better than the bland European pilsners that get sent here."
"D - Super drinkable. Great first beer for converts."
"Taste is grassy and peppery malt backbone. Nice hops. a bit of a metallic finish. A bit thin in the mouth. Crisp up front and then creamy. Damn good drinker. This may be a new regular summer beer for me."
"Drinkability was quite good. Not my favorite lager, but high up there. Thanks to GClarkage for the bottle."
"A soft yellow color with plenty of white-colored head that seems to linger indefinitely. Plenty of carbonation that adds character and elegance to this beer's appearance. I detect grains and sugar with slight hints of alcohol and pine. The taste starts of with a subtle blend of malt and hops giving an almost fruit-inspired taste that finishes crisp and dry. This a refreshing beer with great smoothness and just the right amount of sweetness for this particular style. The low ABV and the excellent taste make this a highly drinkable beer. An excellent German Pilsener."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Nice head,but did'nt last long. Smell was sweet. Mouthfeel is light and crisp,with a good amount of carbination. Taste was refreshing. Good mix of malt and hops.Finish was dry. This is a light beer,but good flavored,and very drinkable. Sorry I only brought home one bottle!"
"Light straw colored, crystal clear, with a thin low white head. Fresh aroma that's initially bright and lemony zesty, but quickly becomes sweeter and maltier, with some cinnamon spice. Flavor is leaning toward sweet, but not approaching cloying. There are light hints of corn and biscuity malt, some lemon and spice. Flavor thickens up in the finish, and turns to mostly buttery corn. Mouthfeel is a bit slick, not very carbonated. Probably the most drinkable pilsner I've had due to the even flavors and lack of the sharp corn flavor that sometimes hangs in the back of the mouth."
"Pours ever-so-slightly hazy yellow with brilliant white head. Smells of sweet grains. Taste of malt, then some kind of fruit character in the ballpark of apples, then finally, refreshing hops cleansing. This beer is very lively and light in the mouth. Extremely drinkable. Most definately a session beer."
"I could throw back quite a few of these on a hot summer day, but on the other hand, I could think of a lot of other beers I'd rather have to quench my thirst. A decent offering from North Coast."
"Drinkability: This is a mighty tasty and refreshing pilsener. Lots of malt flavor and a very light hop make this a wonderfully tasty session beer."
"Pours a very slightly hazy light copper color with a finger of head that falls very slowly to a healthy coating over top. The nose is slightly citrusy and spicey on the hop with a very slight grainey character coming through as well. Flavor is a little bland. Mild graineyness, with just a hint of spicey and sweet hoppyness, but not nearly as crisp as I would like it. The feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. Definately needs more of a crisp carbonation. Overall, just a bit lacking. The burps from this brew give me more hop character than I get in the flavor, which seems odd to me. I'm not digging the flavor as much as I would like."
"Straw coloured with a big fluffy head. Nose has an astringent twang, but this smells far too much like an adjunct lager. This has a decent hop flavour (it isn't one of those lame pilsners) which is followed by an idiosyncratic popcorn flavour and a very creamy finish. It was a little too creamy for me, but I liked the carbonation. I could knock a few of these back, but would generally prefer something rather more challenging like Victory's Prima Pils."
"Darker than most Pils I have tried, richer yellow, almost golden. Not much head. Crisp and fruity, indeed, more fruit than hops. Apples, combined with a citrusy hops makes this one taste more like an English IPA than a pils, although the saaz come out as the beer warms."
"Balance seems to be the optimal word for this pilsner. No aspect is overpowering. It's crisp, clean and almost effervecent. This is a beer I will drink again."
"light in body, easy to drink and nice subdued flavor. seems almost closer to a helles than a pilsner to me."
"Doesn't dissapoint. Malty with just a touch of hops in the middle to give it an edge. I really didn't notice the wheat/grain I come to expect with lighter beers which was nice. Highly drinkable. Easily a session beer of choice as the price/alcohol%/drinkability all add up to seeing DogFood's stomach often."
"This was one of the new beers on tap at my favourite watering hole, so I had to give it a try. It appeared a light golden colour in the glass with a thin white layer of foam across the top. No too much of an aroma detectable. It certainly looked like it was going to be a nice refreshing beer to drink on a hot Houston day. The taste, however, was not what I was expecting. It had an odd earthy, grainy, burnt wood flavour that just didn't seem to fit. Mouthfeel was a little thin with a slightly dry finish. Perhaps it tastes better in the bottle then from the tap, but its probably not a beer that I'll order again."
"An above average Pilsner, made better by the fact that it is fresher stateside than the imports."
"a solid euro tasting pils, nothing extraordinary but solid. worth picking up for a BBQ if it is available near you."
"Appearance is a light, cloudy yellow with ivory (get it  scrimshaw?) foam and nice, long lived lace. Aroma is of sweet grainy malts and hops that caress the nose. Initially the taste has aromatic grapefruit hops complimented by bold malt. Finish is a fresh, cleansed palate experience. Well crafted Pilsner."
"Overall- a tasty Pilsner to help cool off or wash down the veggie nacho's on a hot day!"
"A good American rendition of a classic pilsner beer. Looks a stron straw to golden in color. Pours a loosely knit white head that fades. Smells sweetly and crisply malty with some toasy and bready aromas. Tastes tosty and mildly caramelly. Mild sweet malts are defined and well balanced with flavoring American hops. A little more citrusy (grapefruit) than I prefer in a Pils. Finishes sweet and clean. Mildly creamy through the body. Well balanced."
"this brew seems lodged somewhere between a definite pilsner and an amber, but it's lovely nonetheless. Bare bones brew and delightfully so. Cheers!"
"This is a fine pilsner and one hell of a session beer. Another grand example of it's style from the folks at North Coast."
"Drinkability- Hmmm, one of my favorite pils to date. Had a different flavor than most of them. May snag a sixer of this for the summer."
"Get some MF!"
"North Coast has me very interested in their offerings. This pale straw Pilsner is named for the delicate engravings popularized by 19th century seafarers. A beautiful pils white head the fell and a nice collar supported by beading. Aromatic spicy-hops give a pleasant nose. Scrimshaw is a fresh tasting Pilsner brewed in the European tradition from Munich and Klages malts at 4.4% ABV, Hallertauer and Tettnang hops provide 22 IBU's. Scrimshaw has a subtle hop character, a crisp, clean palate, and a dry finish. Its a nice Pils, if that is what you like."
"Goes down easily enough, but doesn't maintain a whole lot of interest beyond one or two glassfulls."
"Pours a golden straw color with a pretty, half-inch, stark white head. Aroma of fresh floral hops and nice German yeast, with notes of sweet fruit (strawberry?), honey, and a touch of sweet malt. Sweetness continues on the palate, with a honey-tinged malty base accented by subtle notes of those floral hops. Mellow finish leaves a lingering sweetness. Nice medium body becomes a bit foamy at times, but is good for the style. An excellent session beer, perfect for an 80-degree day in April."
"Easily drinkable in a variety of circumstances, and a very good brew!"
"12 ounce, stubby brown bottle, put into stream of commerce w/o freshness dating. Pours the expected golden straw, clear, looks as a pilsner should. Nose is heavily rye and flowery, with spicy German hops. White slight head and leaves a decent amount of white lacing. This one seems to lack the hopped for crispness and snap of a fine example of the style. Its way too ""mushy"" in the center to garner higher marks. Middle of the road pilsner."
"drinkability - overall this is one good pilsner, excellent anytime of year."
"Comments - This is the best pilsner I've ever had. Have you had too many skunked pilsners in green bottles? This is the beer for you. All hail the folks at North Coast Brewing!"
"Approach this beer with an open mind to avoid potential disappointment."
"Overall impression: Nice tasty pils - well balanced and very drinkable. Much better than many pilsners I have tried."
"The taste is quite robust. Sweet and almost chewy malts, mild nutty finish. Slight bitterness dries the mouth after swallowing. Mouth is left a tad too sweet, but not offensive. Drinks well and would be perfect with most meals."
"Tap@North Coast. Started off with this one, probably a good one to start of at the North Coast Pub. Pretty much a bland lager, had some odd burnt flavours though, malty. Sorry to slam it as the reviews are quite high here, but i just didn't get into it at all. Thin and kinda boring."
"Deep golden body, moderate white head, not much retention. I mostly noticed the fruity hops aroma, some orange/citrus. There was a smell that reminded me of old pennies when I first poured this, but it seems to have gone away and be replaced by the malt. This is a very refreshing beer. It has a light sweetness, sugary, a little lemon taste. Some hoppy bitterness at the end balances it nicely. This would be great on a hot summer day. The drinkability is great, I could go for a bunch."
"A polished and well-balanced lager. Great choice to serve to non-BA's. It won't alienate anyone, and beer fans will enjoy it."
"Reflection: This beer is better than anything you can get from a big commercial brewery but I don't plan on picking up more of them."
"Drinkability: Nice and refreshing; a good session brew"
"I drank my first glass of Scrimshaws after driving all day in a Camaro convertible from San Francisco to Fort Bragg. I was pretty thirsty, to say the least, and it probably makes my review a bit biased. The tap version of the beer has a very distinct bread taste, perhaps too distinct for some. It's almost like eating ""knackebrod"" as we say in Sweden. No large scale commerical brewer would go this far, but it gives the beer a strong personality."
"Thanks to Tinus time for the $6 a CASE deal. round of applause for thid fine BA."
"Taste starts out with modest cerealy malt. Light sweetness. Clean. Big hop bite comes in. Bitter, floral to citrus (grapefruit). I like the strong hop presencne. Light bodied, refreshing, snappy, and very drinkable. Not the best American pilsner Ive had, but one of the better ones."
"Overall, an okay pilsener. Nothing to get all excited about but not a dumper either."
"very nice head, lasts long long time, beatiful head and color of golden bliss.. nice... very fruity smell... very nice... taste comes across a bit sour on the start but mellows out into a nice aftertaste that fills the mouth... not bad.. was expecting more from the flavor as everything else up to that reads crisp, dry and exciting."
"Pours a clear golden color with a billowing, puff, white head. Nice malt-hop mix.floral, a bit peppery, with a little citrus. The aroma could have been a little more intense, with a more of a hop smell. Decent carbonation, with bubbles rising through the end of the glass. Theres a touch of malt in the foretaste, which fades by the finish. Clean, crisp end. Not bad, but not outstanding for a pilsner. It seems just a little ordinary and underdone. Ive really started to appreciate pilsners in the past few years, and Im looking for the flavors to really shine throughthis ones just a little too subdued."
"Pours a yellow/orange with gold highlights, the head is decent, lacing will coat the glass. The smell is of nice blend of sweet toasted grain, lemon zest and slight pine hops. The taste is sweet and a caramel smooth maltiness with a nice citrus pine hop taste. Medium bodied and smooth. Very good."
"Well, don't ask me to describe a pilsner, eh. I usually despise them. Maybe this is brewed like a pilsner but if I didn't know otherwise, I'd'a thunk it wuz ein hefe-weizen. The smell is citrusy and spicy and you definitely smell lemon in there. It pours thin with no head at all and has a pale gold, almost straw color. Some carbonation can be seen. The taste is smooth and light with lime adding to the lemon and spice flavors. This beer has a good body to its taste and it sits well in the mouth. There is depth to this character, even if it is trying to fool you into thinking it is a pilsner. Pour me another."
"IMHO: A well-balanced beer ? very drinkable. Sweet for a pilsner, but enjoyable."
"Quite a drinkabke beer..but its far from being a pils..however I enjoyed it anyway and judged it from taste rather than style."
"North Coasts website suggests that Scrimshaw may actually be a top fermented cream ale. (They havent returned my emails.) It still has a full mouthfeel and possesses some admirable quaffability. But Scrimshaw is neither bottle conditioned nor freshness dated and its shelf life may be a limiting factor for casual consumers."
"Very hoppy, especially considering its style and a mellow fruitiness throughout, mainly peach, pear and lemon. The hops are herbal, floral and well pronounced. The malts are toasted and biscuit-like. This is a great example of the style."
"Two fingers of crusty, off-white foam on top of the brassy-gold, hyper-carbonated beer. Burnt crackers, corn syrup, pepper/spice in the nose. A tangy, fruity front. A fizzy, foamy, sweet middle. Roasty nuts in the end. Almost some milky chocolate in the aftertaste. It's a nice, sweet, roasty pils."
"Drinkability: I want more! I got this pilsner in a sampler of summer brews and I will definitely be going back for more! The combination of a light, clean taste with a solid feel on the tongue makes this one a real keeper..."
"Notes: The quick finish, and the solid sweetness that is balanced by the dryness seems to make for an almost perfect summer time beer. This beer would be a perfect choice for an outdoor party, or just anytime that you might want a 'lighter' choice. One of my favorite American Brewed Pilsners."
"I like the overall feel of this one and could pretty much drink them all day. The low alcohol makes this perfect as an afternoon break, or even session beer."
"The taste is somewhat citrusy as well. Definitely fruity with a trace amount of hops. Being a pilsner, it is like the first ingredient on the list, watery. This is a good pilsner, however, one that I would recommend and try again."
"Much more bitter than I like. It's as if the aroma characteristic traded place with the flavor ones. Hops take priority here, with a weak malt backbone. Overall somewhat acrid, with a dry bitter puckering finish."
"Scrimshaw Pilsner is what a macro light beer would taste like if I was king of the world. Looking for a good lawnmower beer? I may have just found a pretty good one."
"How can a lager really look all that good? Tha being said it had a nice golden yellow body and a thin white head. Smell was much more malty than most macro pils you can get. Something a little buttery and bready about the smell. The taste was truly exceptional for a pils. Very complex taste full of yeasyu biscuit notes, slight charcol residue, grainy and slightly hoppy finish with just a bit of lemon. Mouthfeell was actually less carbonated than I expected, but not so thin that it took away from the crispness of the beer. A good effort from North Coast."
"I tried this beer three times before ripping it, I really tried to like it."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a grainy pale malt scent with some bitterness and a dry feel. The taste is good. It has a clean and refreshing pale malt flavor that is grainy and slightly malty. It has a crisp bite and low hopping; no skunkiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine pilsner. It has good clean flavor and a low bodied smooth finish."
"Pours a beautiful yellow-gold with an ample, white, chunky head and plenty of carbonation. While the head dissipates at an average pace, the lace just will not stop 'til the bottom. Smells mild and bready with a hop crispness that lets you know this is a PNW beer for sure. The taste is likewise pure PNW, with a solid bready underlayer that lays a fine foundation for the floral, herbal (not too bitter) hop finish that is as dry and refreshing as I could want. Mouthfeel is thin-ish, but it's already 80 plus here in Reno, so I'll not complain. Drinkability is formidable. New summer session brew? I think so. Yet another fine effort from North Coast."
"this is a good solid pils. no need for an in depth review. its golden, well carbonated, it has a nice grainy malt matched with a nice bittering hoppiness. its crisp and clean, everything a pils hould be. top notch summer drinking and a fine all around beer. deadly in its drinkability."
"Pours hazy golden-straw color with a good fizzy white head that doesn't last long, not much lacing, light grassy and flowery aromas. Bready and grainy mild sweetness turns hoppy and bitter with some dryness in the finish. Light bodied with a soft but crisp carbonated mouthfeel, very clean and crisp, very nice."
"This beer pours a light golden color with bronze highlights and a moderate creamy white head. The smell is a little stronger on the malts with a grainy precense but I do detect a floral hop characteristic. The taste is very similar to the smell. The flavors mix well and are almost too smooth. They seem too refined and don't have that rough edge that I would like to taste in a german pilsner. The finish is very dry. Goes down easy enough though. This could definitely be a transition beer for macro drinkers but it seems too underwhelming for me (ie-it needs more skunkiness, rawness)"
"Poured a nice clear golden yellow with a thin white head and a little lacing down the glass. The smell was lite on the hops, a little heavier on the malt and very little bit of skunkiness? The taste was medium bodied and crisp with a bitter hop bite up front that mellowed out in the end. The malt backbone was solid and very ""German Tasting"" if that makes any sense. The mouthfeel was pleasant with perfect carbonation and the hops really made this one sit well. I could drink more of this than most beers. It's really tough (in my opinion) to find a great Pilsner.... well, more than just one great Pilsner beer right now (ie. Prima Pils). Maybe I'm not looking in the right places. But this is a solid offering and is probably really nice on tap at a cookout or with seafood."
"Overall, this is really nice. I need to get more of this stuff."
"Very nice tasting brew extremely clean and well balanced. Sweet almost honey malts are quickly followed up by a snappy hops bite. Clean clear finish, not very much aftertaste at all. Very light bodied, with a very effervescent mouthfeel. Light and tasty, an easy session brew."
"Very Drinkable."
"This beer pours a nice golden/yellow color. Very bright, clear beer. The aroma is somewhat lacking. There's nothing really there. A very slight hop nose. The flavor is a nice balance of malt and hops. It has a slight bitterness and a nice, soft hop flavor on the finish. It also has a slightly sweet flavor that kind of detracts from the hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin. A good session beer, overall."
"One of my favorite slammer style brews. Nothing complicated, but solidly crafted, I love to start the end of the day with a Scrimshaw, or have a glass while I'm getting dinner ready. The color is a light, buttery golden. Not alot of head, but I'm happy to drink this without a glass, and am not into over-analyzing this style. Aromas are yeasty and malty, reminding me of fresh baked bread. Flavors are clean and feature a rubust grain profile, especially malt, some rye like flavors, and just a spattering of hop to focus the beer. Ah so easy to drink. This is a Good choice for all levels of beer drinkers."
"Pours a hazy yellow/light gold with an offwhite head that quickly drops into patchy lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malts dance a waltz with the floral hops and Granny Smith apple background. In the mouth, there is abundant fizzy carbonation and some moderate hop bite. Plenty of caramel malt sweetness in the taste, backed up with solid Munich maltiness. Fruity and floral hops are around to lend a delicate balance. Excellent finish is clean and dry. I could have a couple more of these, anytime. I enjoyed this one with pickled okra. A perfect session brew here."
"I actually had this beer this summer when I went out to Northern California at the North East Brewing Company and had it on tap. I liked it so much I got myself a shirt. It pours a light gold color. As people said here the aroma is very ""floral"". I found the taste a bit citrusy which I like and which I didn't expect. It is nicely carbonated and very drinkable. I actually found this beer out here in NJ recently but it didn't taste as well out of the bottle as it did on tap."
"A high quality American style pilsener from a great brewery, and one I could drink several of in a row. Other than the mild metallic note, it is not offensive in any way, well-balanced, and very drinkable."
"The appearance of this beer was light clear gold with a small head. It had a pleasant floral hop aroma. I was expecting another boring pilsner when I was surprised by a flavorful hop taste (citrusy with orange peels), bitter with some slight sweetness. It had a dry finish and a good aftertaste. This pilsner reminded me of a light pale ale. For me, it would be a good summer beer or something to drink with chips etc."
"Pours a pale golden straw typical pils color with a two-fingered sized white head. Decent lacing. Aroma is malty and sweet with a moderate botanical, hoppy background. Slighty metallic aroma in there, too. Malty and sweet, this pils is balanced on the maltier side. Eastern European hop background in the finish. Maintainins high drinkability due to low ABV. Not a bad American pils at all, I prefer pilsners a bit hoppier and drier, but you wouldn't find me turning one of these down."
"Overall: A very well made and nicely balanced Pilsner. One that I would most certainly purchase again. I wasnt wrong when I decided to pick this up, North Coast certainly make some quality beers."
"This is a great intro beer for the masses.You can easily say to your Miller or Bud drinking friends, ""Hey, give this a try"" and they'll like it.Highly drinkable, light but consistent mouthfeel with an easy hop finish.Pilseners tend to have a metallic taste to me, but this one is void of that.Very nice."
"Thanks to morris729 for the sample."
"This was a pretty good beer. I heard some good things about it and it held up to all the talk. It was a great clear golden color just like a lot of macro's but this had a lot more flavor. This is definitely be a beer I would give a macro swill head. A well rounded beer and is very drinkable both with flavor and alcohol content."
"The flavor is clearly bready and yeasty, but balanced enough as to not be overpowering. The feel is a bit thin, but the crisp finish keeps this dimension in bounds. A very drinkable and refreshing Pilsener."
"A very good Pils. Pours out to a pastel golden color in the glass with a moderate head. Aroma is that of baking bread, light yeast and light fruit. The taste shows off a nice use of hops which for most beers are lacking in this style. The balance is good though as the malt to hop presence is good without either overpowering. Nice finish and extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability - not a show-stopper, but an all-around great selection. Easily could take good care of a sixer of these."
"Drinkability  This lacks the smooth texture and hop dominance of a classic German Pils."
"Overall Impression: This beer tastes great! My only beef is that it just doesn’t say “pilsner” to me. Maybe closer to a Dortmunder Export in style? If you are in the “style smyle” camp, I can only say this beer is good, but fairly bland. I also found it fairly filling, which counts against drinkability. I love North Coast beers, but this one just didn’t float my boat."
"Pours a mostly clear pale gold topped with small white head that quickly fades away, leaving only a small ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. The aroma is well balanced between the freshly mown hay and bready maltiness and sharp, slighty herbal and earthy hops. Faint touches of honey and mustiness too. That balance carries over into the flavor, with a firm bitterness holding the biscuity malt in check. Quite a bit of dryness towards the finish, which serves to add some length. The body seems a touch thicker than desired, but bumping up the carbonation a bit would help that. This is a solid brew, and one that I could quaff on a regular basis during the warmer months."
"My kind of pilsner....nice munich malt backbone....a nice otuch of herbal/spicy hops...pours a light gold color....nice white head that rims the glass....nose is spicy more than anything....mouthfeel is more creamy than crisp....body is firm and about medium...flavor is really balanced nicely between the predomiant munich malt and spicy/herbal hops...this slid down the hatch very quickly...not a big fan of Pilsners but I do favor German Style Pilsners and this is a good example....I would buy this again if looking for a pilsner"
"Yellow gold color, large white foamy head. Aroma is grassy, grainy and slightly sweet. Malty and mildly hoppy. Light and refreshing, Good hop to malt flavor. Somewhat fruity (orange). Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Golden straw color with a sizeable white head and active carbonation present. Nose is doughy with earthy hops and lemon zest and other citrus present. Flavor is diverse with notes of herbal hops, sweet, bready malt, citrus and a super clean, dry finish. Mouhtfeel is quite smooth at first, but subsequently turns watery and underattenuated, which is perhaps the sole drawback to this pilsner. Scrimshaw is refreshing and very drinkable. German in nature with some definite West Coast US characteristics. Nice stuff."
"On the nose it's loaded with decadent, sticky, dark-green buds and murky, tea-like malt fragrances. This is obviously a high-quality beer, loaded with choice ingredients. Chewy texture for a ""pilsener"" with lazy, toasted malt richness that succumbs to a vegetal, raw spinach-like bitterness in the mid-palate leaving a dry, metallic impression. I'm impressed with the cloth this is cut from, but there seems to be a lack of dynamism. Perhaps this sample was accidentally pasteurized."
"This pilsner poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled but left lace on the glass. The smell was mild: malty with a trace of hops. The taste was mildly sweet with fruity, herbal hops. Other flavors included citrus, caramel, and grapefruit (hops). The mouthfeel was smooth with a puckering, tangy finish but a sweet aftertaste. The body was medium with low carbonation feel. This was a pretty good pilsner, but with quite a few additional flavors that I would not normally associate with a pilsner."
"pours out a slightly hazy bright golden colour. a few flecks of sediment float around in the glass. a snow white head is supported by ample carbonation. pleasing aroma of sour dough malts and grassy, herbal hoppiness. rather light bodied, but with creamy smooth mouthfeel. biscuit like malt flavours abound. a just right tinge of hebal hop bitterness rounds out the taste profile in the finish. extremely easy drinking with enough taste to mimick true european pilseners. a nice beer."
"I originally sampled this beer on 19 June 2002. I am writing this reveiw from my notes. I admit that I'm not a big fan of pilseners. However, I actually happen to like Victory Prima Pils and Dogfish Head Prescription Pils. This beer is nowhere close to either of these. It would pass as an OK lawnmower beer."
"Golden color, but slightly hazy. Nice bone white head. Carbonation level seems moderate from viewing. Nice noble hop aroma on the nose (seems like Saaz). Hay and a subtle pils maltiness as well. Onto the flavor....Pils and biscuit like malt properties lay the backbone. Grassy, herbal hop tones are present througout. The bitterness is substanial and pleasing. Pretty solid taste. Body is a little better than medium. Carbonation seems about right. Not too bad."
"Thanks to MJR for bringing this one back from his vacation for me!"
"Had a moderate dry finish, just enough, and a nice ease to the mouthfeel - watery but moderately thick, different but good. This beer is nice for a style thats been commercially destroyed. I'd never thought I would respect a pilsener this much that I didn't drink in Prague. Hmmm.... memories...."
"($6.99 / 6-pack)"
"Flavor is a little strange. It starts off malty and light, with good effervescence and mouthfeel, traveling into a hoppy finish, but I don't think the hops feel clean enough. A touch of bready flavor in the aftertaste. A pretty decent pilsner, but maybe my expectations were a little too high."
"Overall, a good pilsener. Not as much character as some, but light, tastey, and refreshing."
"It is smooth and it has a great mouthfeel. A very enjoyable simple pilsner. Can I have another?"
"Overall this is a very good beer to drink on a hot day and i would definetly buy this one again."
"Clear golden yellow with a quickly dissipating head. Smell is very faint (or my old nose isn't what it used to be) and hard to discern. Taste is smooth, with a medium to full body. Very slight bitter aftertaste that was fine. Mouthfeel was well-rounded, with a drinkabilty that was good, especially after a nice summer's walk."
"Not a huge pilsner fan, this one isnt bad though. As it got warmer, it definitely had a more acidic metal taste to it though, so I liked it more straight from the fridge."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden orange hue with a white decent sized foaming head, which leaves a healthy amount of trickled lace around my glass. Aroma contains primarily biscuit malt, a citrus tone to it, along with mild floral tones ties it together very nicely. What a great little sipper this beer is with the rush of sweet all grain malt profile slight fruit tones thrown in with a background of nuttiness and the delicate bitterness brought on by the hops. Mouthfeel is light but not thin by any means nice amount of carbonation very smooth perfectly constructed beer. Doesn't completely strike me as a pilsner not much Saaz floating around here, but this one gets my approval. Drinkability is addicting I want another one, definitely the type of beer a could by a case of and use it as a summer sipper."
"The taste had a little citrus but was over come with the clean bite from this pilsner. I enjoyed this and will not hesitate to buy it again."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a hazy golden color, with a small head. Some fine lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt and hops, with a faint floral nose. Good carbonation, almost a fruitness that comes through, with mild bitterness in the finish. An over all enjoyable beer."
"Pours pure gold with a snowy white head and some sticky, if spotty lace. A fragrant floral whole hop aroma awaits you and slowly fades as you drink. There's not a lot of malty character to discuss...even for a Pilsner. There's a mild grainy sweetness and just the faintest herbal quality to be aware of. I would have preferred more assertive hop flavors instead of this weak acidic citrus and mild metallic bitterness. Not a bad American Pilsner, it just doesn't compare well to most Czech and German varieties"
"This is a decent and dry pilsner. Finishes clean and is very crisp. Good malt character with an easy drinkability. I think there are better pilsners out there, but this is a nice and satisfying American version."
"Unlike most BAs I have a predisposition for pilsners but the good US microbrewed ones are few and far between. This is at the top of the heap. Brilliant gold with ample head and lace. Delicate, fragrant aroma of flowers and lemon bread. Surprisingly malty for a pilsner although this isn't too far from the Czech version. Tons of flavor. The hops are certainly there but subdued until the very end, when they linger on the tongue and coax you into taking another sip. Soft, cushy mouthfeel. Between that and the head, I am guessing there's some wheat in the recipe. I can't imagine anyone, be it the most intrepid imperial stout loving Beergeek, or the most timid macroswilling bargain-beer-buyer, not finding something to enjoy about this beer. I've had it on tap but I am currently enjoying the bottle more."
"The art-work on this bottle is some of the nicest I have seen in a while. What is inside is almost as impressive. Pours a hazy straw color with a quick thin lace. The aroma is sharp and hints of toasted malt. The body is smooth and takes the edge off an aggressive bitterness and a little floral spice. The finish brings up a delicate malt, but a good amount of bitter carries the brew all the way from rim to base."
"This pilsner poured a nice pale straw color, with a small head that stuck around for a while. Very attractive looking for the style, with very noticeable bands of active carbonation. The mild hoppy scent had a subtle floral bouquet, with a touch of malt. The Scrimshaw had a nice crisp taste, and had a bit of an added sweetness that I didn't expect. Smooth, slightly bitter, and refreshing. The visible carbonation didn't quite prodce the fizziness desired on the tongue, but the medium to lighter body was appealing. Very easy drinking, I could easily sit back and enjoy several. I think I would have appreciated a bit more bitterness to give it more of a kick, but it had all the characteristics of a good pilsner. I love the name, too. Scrimshaw's a pretty cool word, and a pretty good beer."
"This beer looks close to perfect for a pilsner. Clean, golden yellow. Decent head when first poured, but not much sticks around. Wonderful aroma for a pilsner. Smells refreshing. Tastes pretty good. Crisp and clean, but a scoots in my mouth a little too much. Semi-bitter aftertaste at first, but it smooths out to a pleasant lingering."
"This was poured into a pint glass,it would have been nice to see in a pilsner.Poured a nice yellow color with fluffy head,smell was fruity and slightly bread-like.First thing I noticed on the palate was the hoppiness,probably the most hoppy tasting pilsner I have tried.Taste was rounded out with some malt backround in the end,a real drinkable beer that I was somewhat impressed with."
"A very crisp carbonation starts this beer off right. It has a pretty light body, but there is no flavor missing. Lots of grass combined with floral hops to merge well with a grainy mass of pale malts. Cereal comes in the aftertaste like wheat cheerios. It is not very complex or amazingly interesting, but it is a good old pils. It is a great drinker, and probably anyone could drink quite a few. It is refreshing till the last drop. This would be an excellent beer to have with almost any food, or to just hang out and take a few down."
"Nice white head that only lasted for a bit. Smell was not very strong and very faint. Color was a cloudy-ish yellow. The taste was a bit different than the usual Pilsner. Grassy/Nutty flavor that. It seemed heavier than most Pilsners I have had. A nice drinking beer though."
"Semi-opaque medium gold color (odd that its murky) with a great pale head of 1/4 of an inch of persistant creamy bubbles. Decent cross-lacing in a tall Pilsner glass. Bright and grassy hop aromas, in the noble vein (Tetnang influenced?), but with associated bready and yeasty notes. Flavor is straightforward, sweet malts may be a touch overdone, but lending a soft initial flavor with no off characters. Delicate apple impressions. A decently crisp hop attenuation at the close and a light feel to the finish. Perhaps slightly malt-laden for a Pilsner but a well done and highly drinkable beer, here."
"Poured out of the bottle with a fluffy white head sitting on clear light golden liquid. Nose is crisp maltiness, grassiness & some flowery hoppiness. Taste is first malty sweetness that lingers on the palate a bit followed by a restrained hop bitterness. Finishes up neither here nor there...I was expecting just a bit more in the hop department...just an average Pilsener."
"Pours a single finger deep foamy head that dissipates in about a minute. A good number of mid-sized bubbles line the glass and stream upward. The color is a somewhat cloudy golden yellow. Pleasant toasty malt smell with noticeable citrusy hops. Tastes fruity and sweet to start, moves into some toasty malt, but is then overtaken by an unpleasant alcohol quality. Medium to full bodied, this beer is pretty ""in your face."" It's kind of rough with a lot of hoppy bitterness. Overall, this ""pilsner style"" brew doesn't seem to be properly balanced and as such won't find it's way back into my refrigerator."
"This one pours very golden with a weak head. The nose is also weak with definite hop tones. The taste is strong and aggressive with hints of the north coast signature flavor that lies at varying strengths in all their beer I have tasted. The finish is hops also but is clean. The mouthfeel is fluffy and rather enjoyable."
"The color the prototypical Pilsner a sparkling gold color with a unboastful head, creamy in consistency, bright white in color and as it dissipates the resultant lace a fine coating upon the glass. The nose dominated by the malt, crisp and fresh, clean to the senses and pleasant as aromas go. Sweet malt start, the top skinny in its feel, finish has a boastful acidity, the hops as expected were pleasing and not overpowering, droughty long lasting aftertaste. A decent drinking beer, that satisfies the thirst and decent for a Non-Ale!"
"First time sampling this in many years, and better than I remembered."
"Pours a beautifully clear golden color with lots of bubbles and an impressive white head. It has a nice pungent fruit and black peppery hop aroma along with faint grainy notes. Smells great! The taste repeats the smells contents with the bold hops as well as a nice smooth malt background. The taste is blended superbly and is quite bold for the style. This is a very nice representation of the style IMO. Its light body and smooth yet crisp clean characteristics make this one tasty blend! A great pils! Cheers!"
"Pours a golden straw color with a large creamy white head that eventually gives way to a nice sticky lace. Nose is a nice blend of sweet malts and floral hops. Taste is slightly bready with only a mild amount of hop bitterness in the finish. Excellent quaffing material!"
"Looks the classic pilsner part: pale golden with pure white head. It's the taste that got me. I've been kind of off lagers lately, but the flowery hop flavours are exceptionally balanced and well-placed. Fades well without any unpleasant bitterness. A winner all around."
"Pours a slightly hazy darkish gold.  Aromatic and spicy herbal hops dominate the aroma with subdued malts as well.  Lots of micro bubbles continuously renew the small off-white head.  Lace is scant and broken.  Taste begins with slightly sweet malt, which fade into bread flavors.  At mid-taste, the hops begin to dominate, carrying through to the finish, which is crisp and dry.  A bit off trail from the typical Pilsner, but very good, nonetheless."
"A very nice pilsner.  It is not a Weihenstephaner, but then what is?  This is a smooth and clean pils that starts easy and finishes even easier.  North Coast makes some of the finest brews available.  Prost!"
"This is there palest beer. Although the aroma and apperance was very promising, it lacked the flavor I was looking for in a pilsner. Although it had a crisp, clean taste and a mild dry finish, it just lacked the something, that would seperate it from other pilsners of it's type."
"Clear, bright golden in color with a foamy, bright white head that holds quite well and leaves an excellent, full lace throughout the glass. The aroma expresses a good combination of grainy malt and mild, pleasant, and slightly floral hops. The body is medium-full, and combined with a median carbonation level it gives a soft, almost chewy mouthfeel.  The flavor is a perfect melding of bready German pilsner malt and slightly spicy & gently floral hops. The finish, like the flavor and aroma before it, offers a intertwining malt & hop character that gently lingers. Only slightly dry, but clean and crisp. Very well balanced. Certainly not overly bitter. A great beer from a great brewery."
"Pours a straw / golden color with a decent white head, leaves a nice lace. On the nose the aromas where of malt, grainy, and slightly grassy. On the palate there is a nice malt-ness to it, slightly spicy, grainy, earthy, green apple peels and clean and crisp. The mouth feel is some-what chewy. The finish is slightly dry but clean and crisp though. A good pilsener..."
"This beer poured a dark straw color and formed a white head that left some lace.  The aroma was of spice, malt and hops.  The taste was of malt and hops.  The finish has a slightly unusual bitter aspect to it.  Interesting flavor for a pilsner"
"While Pilsner beers are not what I seek out nowadays, I decided to try this on a warm day recently.  That this beer is from the highly regarded and one of my favorites North Coast, I felt less guilty about ""stepping back"" if you will. This beer is a pale straw that had a nice bubbly head and lacing was pretty good. I liked the soft malty refreshing taste and there was just the right amount of hop presence for the style. Very refreshing for warm weather drinking."
"Notes: A choice American brewed pilsner with eight awards, as of 1998, for proof."
"This brewery puts out some fine products, but this one seemed to fall short.  Straw color with moderate carbonation, and little grain in the nose.  Flavor was light, mild and slightly sweet.  While I would take it any day over a macro-brew, the beer was not particularly notable.  Would fall into the upper spectrum of my lawnmower beer category."
"I think I got a bad bottle of this.  Pours a golden straw color with an almost nonexistent head.  Faint hop aroma with a slightly stronger grain smell.  Light hop bitterness with a slightly sweet malt flavor.  Overall somewhat of a bland taste.  Sticky coating is left in the mouth, almost syrupy (sp.?)  Not very drinkable.  Now I should mention that this is probably one of my least favorite styles of beer.  I will pick one up every now and then to test myself.  This is not one of the better pilsners that I've had and even though I think that I might have gotten a bad bottle I still won't buy it again."
"Is ""American Pilsner"" an oxymoron?  In any event, this is one of the better examples of a beer style that I think is very hard for American concerns to brew.  Most of 'em just don't have the delicate and yet full flavor of Pilsner Urquell or even Crystal.  But this one almost does -- good golden color, nice white head, whiffs of hops and malt in the nose and on the palate, and crisp carbonation.  I like it."
