"A very clean taste, I get some hops, just enough"
""
""
"Overall: One of the best US-produced German pilseners available. If you're a lager head, you've got to try this one."
"Appearance 4, Aroma 4, Flavor 3.75, Palate 3.75, Overall 4"

"had three so right about now this may be a little biased. finger of head with yellow body. good carbonation. dry bitter smell. taste is hoppy and dry at first but it doesn't linger. crisp as advertised. very good beer just wasn't expecting it to be so bitter but I should've noticed the 44 IBU on the label which is fine but just not expected. more of an IPA to me than a pilsner but lighter. good beer but I like other pilsners more"

"Not my style the name sounds do good but the beer falls flat got some hay smell and nothing else taste just bland with a earthly hop finish"

"O:  Good beer.  Not one of 6point's better offerings, though.  Definitely prefer sweet action to it."
"An excellent pilsner.  I can't believe it took so long for me to try this.  Clean pilz flavor with a nice hop presence,  which is standard for sixpoint at this point.  Will definitely become a year round in my fridge.  Thanks sixpoint for another amazing beer that takes up little fridge space"
"Overall: Ok brew. I would have again if I was offered."
"Best beer from Six Point!"

"Whether it’s the brewery or the BA, Sixpoint rocks! Unlike many American pilsener-style beers, this retains the classic feel and drinkability of an Old World example, but has some American hop character as well. Eminently drinkable, I could consume this all day. When the summer weather is here, I know I’ll miss having this on hand."
""
""
"O-  Great taste for a pilsner, but mouthfeel not what expected in a pilsner."
"Would be a 4+ if it was a light IPA but calling it a Pilsner doesn't seem right.  Still.. great smell with an even greater taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good Pils.  Nothing special, no bad though.  Would purchase again."
""
""
""
"One of the best pilseners and one of the best beers I've ever had hands down> These cats can brew."
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer! My favorite pilzzz"
"One of the better pilsners out there that you can buy nationally."
""
"Thin. Watery. Hoppy for a pilsner. A bit of a banana-y taste from the yeasts. Also so hop aftertaste. Probably wouldnt buy again."
""
""
"The worst beer I have ever consumed.  I'd rather redrink my own puke.  Horrible, horrible and it is a lager, not a pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delightful aroma/nose developed hoppy body & finish!!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There may be a decent pilsner hiding somewhere beneath the piney hop haze, but it's impossible to tell. Any mention of ""pilz"" or ""pilsner"" on this beer's labeling is misleading. Not a bad beer, just not a great one."
""
""
""
""

"Came flying out as soon as I cracked open the can. But I caught it all in my goblet. Of course this resulted in a beautiful 1"" foamy head. Typical aroma that you would expect from a German pilsener. Flavor wise there is nothing surprising here, it's just a very clean, refreshing pilsener. Very drinkable, went down very easy. Looking forward to my next beer from Sixpoint."

"Pours a clear straw color with a big white head that descends to a scummy coating.  OK retention a touch of lacing.  The smell and the flavor are both flatly bready/bitter.  Really clean fresh aroma with some herbal/citric hop smells.  The flavor is bracing with green herbal hop characteristics (almost like mint or basil), there is some definitely clean malt and yeast character to it.  Super drinkable with a light body and a medium finish (in kind of hangs around but is pretty clean).  Excellent pilsener.  Stays true to being fairly inoffensive and drinkable while still cramming in some flavor from the European-tasting hops.  Would have again; excellent 'good' beer for pale lager lovers."

"This beer truly lives up to it's name. The pour is a light golden yellow color with a thin head that dissipates quickly. The smell is light but has distinct floral hop notes and some light malt sweetness. The taste was a quick bite from the hops and malt that mellowed and had a bright finish with little aftertaste making it a very refreshing beer. Would highly recommend."

"Bought a sixer of this a couple days ago, and have really enjoyed it! The name gets it right - it is very crisp, with a citrusy grapefruit aroma on the pour. The head is full, but dissipates quickly. On the first sip the grapefruit taste comes thru, with some mild bitterness that ends in a clean finish.  All in all, deeelicious!"
""
""
""
"Pours a straw yellow with white head that lasts a while. Almost no lacing on the glass. From the smell you can tell this is a lager but it has a nice amount of hoppiness. Very citrusy. Taste is like a cross between a pilsner and a pale ale. You get that smooth bready malt up front with a nice hop bite in the finish. Grapefruit, maybe some pine and fruity sweetness. Mouthfeel is awesome. Really light and not overly carbonated. Goes down easy and really drinkable. Overall a very solid beer. Sixpoint can do no wrong in my eyes. These guys just put out awesome stuff."

"Rather tasty for such a light beer, but it's got an off-putting whiff of ammonia that reminds me of cleaning out a cat's litter box."

"O-excellent pilsener, easy drinking and great for a hot summer day to quench the thirst"
""
""
""

""

"a good hoppy American lager, I don't get much german from this at all, maybe a little dusty yellow grain base, but this beer is one heck of a hoppy lager, more so than any from Europe I have seen. nice snow white head, good clarity, and a powerful hoppy aroma of some bigger American hops, maybe simcoe or something similar, centennial or the like. I wouldn't quite call it an india pale lager, but its getting there stylistically with all the hops, for me at least it is. big hop flavors pick up about mid palate where the hefty pilsener malt base leaves off. its never too biter, but has a resinous dank hoppy dominance to it. a little filling, fuller bodied for the style, and I didn't find it to be as crisp per se as advertised, but I like this beer quite a bit. an easier drinking summer hoppy brew than and ipa, but this will likely not please those in search of an authentic german pils."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy and light gold color with lots of head that dies quick with lace patches around glass. Beer is light, smooth, the minor citric hoppy crispness is dominant but there is a little big of sweetness coming off as well thanks to a good balance. Finishes dry and crisp and is a simple and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've never had anything like it, the hops are up front (and familiar, for someone who drinks more hoppy beers than anything else), but the combination of the hops and super light lager mouthfeel and appearance make this one pretty unique. I gave this to my dad and a friend who drinks more Steel Reserve than craft, and they both really enjoyed it. I think this is a great ""gateway"" beer for those who are used to AALs and the like. Light, while having no shortage of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm pretty much blown away. This is definitely my favorite beer I've had from Sixpoint. I'm disappointed that it took me so long to try this. Awesome stuff. Highly recommended."

"O: a decent pilsner, but compares poorly to the SN/Firestone Walker Beer Camp Torpedo Pilsner that preceded it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice enough, but could be crisper for something called 'the crisp'."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Absolutely the best pilsner I've had and likely to please the IPA fans who are normally wary of malty lagers or pilsners."
""
""
""
"but if I'm missing the good bread malt balancing notes and if I'm going to dock points for a lack of clarity, I also have to give The Crisp full points for being fantastic at what it wants to be -- a super-hoppy pilsener with American hop flavors. I get why people love this brew, and it's one I'll likely revisit."
""
""
"Kind of new to this style but I really like this one. Works great in these hot humid summer days. a lot of flavor packed in to this beer but maintains a light refreshing body. Well done once again by the boys from Sixpoint. Seek this one out!"
""
"Beer has a typical pilsner head. Beer has a wonderful aroma of hops. Strange because they actually smell more like American IPA hops vs. the usual European Noble variety. The taste is excellent for a pilsner. Very hop forward with maltiness balance. A little over hopped perhaps but a tad more balanced than say, Prima. Overall I thought this was one of the better pilsners out there and a high quality brew from SixPoint."

"O: A nice lager that is more or less in the German style. The body is a little too slight and not quite dry enough for me to fully accept this beer as an authentic German-style pils, yet it is still very good."

"Sixpoint The Crisp ---4/5."

"This is another quite delicious beer from Sixpoint. It's close but not quite to a traditional German pilsner."
""
""
""
"overall; the perfect american pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a darn good lager, just very well done."
""
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Crystal clear light gold color, with fine streaming bubbles flowing from the bottom. Large initial head, though it fades somewhat quickly. The nose features plenty of hop aroma--very nice, though more American than German, with grassy piney notes. Oh, this is a fine hoppy pils, with lots of bitterness and grassy hop flavors. Malt is light but holds up reasonably well. Light, clean finish. Nice spritzy carbonation level. One of the best pils I've had in a while."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste echoes the aroma with the same sweet, grainy, malty characteristics that leave a dry but clean hop bite at the end. Often I rate a beer on whether I would remember it a year from now if someone asked me about it. I think I could give a future customer a pretty good description of what to expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a tall Spiegelau Pilsner/Kölsch crystal."
"It was a good pilsner and definitely one of the better ones I have had. Would definitely drink this again."
""
""
"make better versions of domestic styles."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a murkey orange color body with a small fizzy head. The armoma had a citrus, lemon aroma to it. The taste has a crisp pilsner flavor, hop and citrus, malt. The hops also gives it a earthy, grassy flavor also. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp and overall a good pilsner."
""
""
""
"O: The more I sample from Sixpoint, the more I start to 'get' them. Maybe it's the way they hold up a middle finger to style conventions (this is some weird hybrid between a German pils, a kellerbier, and a good ol' fashioned hoppy 'Murican lager; even better, it actually works), I don't know. All I know is I would definitely buy this again."
""
"A decent pilsener & not a bad offering from Sixpoint, although it wasn't in the same league as their Bengali Tiger. Nice & crisp, living up to the name at least but there are better pilseners out there."

"Overall, this is seems to be close to a kellerbier in presentation with a heavy bitter pils take. As it warms up the flavors come through pleasantly, but the nose seems off and mouthfeel a bit overdone."

""
""
""

"A disappointing beer. The aroma and appearance are great but the presence of acetaldehyde in large quantities seriously lowers the palatability of this beer."

"Can @ Duckfat: This one pours a hazy, darker golden color. There was a somewhat frothy off-white head on it. It didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The nose is OK, but a bit bland. Faint earthy hops and some malts. The taste is much better than the nose. Bit of bitterness, some malts. Very smooth."

"O: best pilsener ever...sixpoint crushes everything they touch and this beer is no different...definitely give it a shot if ur skeptical about american takes on german pilseners, u will be pleasantly surprised."

"A competent attempt at a pilsner by Sixpoint."

"Had on tap at Five Horses in Davis Square. Humid day and it seemed perfect for a crisp pilsner. Very clean taste right away - classic German notes. Very surprising. Very lemongrass and wheat smell with little head. Not overly carbonated but the beer kept its crispness throughout. Very refreshing beer - nice change from overly hopped regulars always served. Very good beer"
""
""
""
""
"notes: perhaps the best German styled Pilsner I have ever had. refreshing, tasty, delightful."
""
"Ill be back for more!"
""
""
"O- There is not much hop flavor in this beer and there is no malt flavor to be found at all. It is very clean and crisp just a bit boring."
"I am really pleased with this beer. This is not really my go-to style, I think mainly because it often reminds me of beers I drank before discovering the diverse offerings of the craft world. Sixpoint has taken the style that is typically a staple of college frat parties and day-drinking cookouts and turned it into exactly what we all want it to be. Drinkable, refreshing, and simple, but also flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Really delivers on the palate in a big way for the style. Nicely done."

"Light crisp Pilsner taste and feel with a bend towards lemon zest or lemongrass. Malty cereal grains hold the backbone but the light lemon fruit keeps the taste and feel properly refreshing. Nice summer quencher that accompanies smoked pork or beef very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really solid German pilsener that nails the style perfectly. If you happen to be looking for a flavorful summertime beer, this one could definitely fit the bill."
""
"Final Thoughts: My first ever Sixpoint beer and definitely lived up to my expectation. Nice and flavorful. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"Slightly hazy and golden with a fair head and no lace. Powerful yeasty and grainy aroma. Big bodied for a pilsener. Slight amount of spicy hops in both aroma and flavor, but this might be an age issue (beer I had was a few months old), as I recall more in previous encounters. Holds it's ground with the better German pilseners. Nice acidity and lively carbonation mouthfeel."
""
""
"Another solid offering from Sixpoint. Not as superb as 3Beans or Resin, but a pretty good pils all the same. Great mouthfeel, looks excellent in your glass, could use maybe just a tad more carbonation to give it more oomph. But refreshing and fine for these lazy, hazy, days of summer. Could drink this often. Give it a try."
""
""
"Very good beer!! Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: A full flavored, clean, hoppy pilsner that doesn't get fatiguing. A great choice for a german pilz in the US."
""
"Pours straw gold with perfect clarity, champagne effervescence and exceptional brilliance. A creamy two finger white head that fell fast but left gorgeous lace, a ring and cap. Nose is outrageous simplicity. Outstanding malt, spicy hops, yeast and a touch of lemon. Subtly floral. Clean. The malt is deep and strong but not sweet. Bread and grain. Taste is is terrific. Crisp like the name suggests. It has a slight bitterness, a bit of pucker from the lemon but no sour or real fruitiness. The malt is outstanding and playful. It adds a grainy bite of it’s own to go alongside the hop bite and the carbonation and really shines. Deep & full but not heavy it offers just a little honey to keep it soft on the palate and to keep the palate interested. Finishes dry with some oil and bitter, a good lingering aftertaste. Body is a touch watery but smooth and slightly herbal. Earthy and flavorful. Easy to drink. Uncomplicated."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Though I admittedly don't prefer lagers, this one leaves no lasting impression on me compared to other more flavorful pilsners I've had. Still, it's easy to drink and there's not anything necessarily wrong with it."
""
""
""
"Another disappointment from what I had expected to be a really great brewery based on the buzz out there. This was a weak-tasting, underpowered beer that left me with a feeling of loss and unfulfilled potential. It didn't taste bad, just muted and diluted. And it was very fresh. I liked the larger can size, I will say. For a beer that you'd want to session, that was perfect. But for me this was not only forgettable, but somewhat lacking. Would not buy again even for outdoor sunny sessioning, which I had figured it would be perfect for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Crisp as properly named. A nice canned pilsner that seem to have everything a pils should and tastes good. Definitely would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a great golden color. smells like lemon, grass, wheat. Initial taste is one of very little as far as complex flavors but I guess just what it claims to be...'crisp'. Mouthfeel watery, smooth and slightly bitter. Not one of my favorites and likely not added to my must have in fridge list."
"Poured into a pint glass. Cloudy and gold with a two inch foamy head. Smell is faint but fresh and ... we'll crisp. Wow, that is some classic pilsner hops! Hops is big but not overboard with a quick bite that seems a combination of the hops and carbonation. This is a pilsner with flavor yet without being a bomb, or seeming to much like an IPA. The bite gives it a clean and crisp finish, yet just the right amount of hoppy goodness lingers long on the palate. Sixpoint definitely hit the mark on this one. Did they kidnap some Munchland meisterbrauer? This tastes the beers I had in Munich, but with volume turned up. Great pils."

"One more good brew from Sixpoint."
""
""
"O: There should to be so many more flavorful lagers like this available in the market. This beer is mostly straight forward noble hops with some pilsner malt and a clean lager fermentation."
"Overall - My first craft lager, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very complex for its type yet at the same time it stays true to the formula and the goal, to quench and refresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers! Abort!"
""
""
""
""

"It's a pretty good German Pilsner, would make a good fishin' beer. I like that it's in cans."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sorry, this one was just not for me"
""
""
""
""
"O: I seldom reach for a lager, but this is an exception. The evident quality of ingredients and hoppy twist make this a new favorite for this IPA-lover. I will be going back to this again and again."
""
""
""
"Dark, golden yellow in color with a heavy haze. Poured with a short, rich, rocky foam that quickly reduced to a thin wispy cap. Lemony and minty hop aromas with bready and biscuity aromas beneath. Carbonation creates a pleasant, slighty grainy, medium bodied feel. Light lemony and minty hop flavors with biscuity flavors beneath. Finishes with a crisp, lingering, minty, lemony hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"A very easy drink, and a nice clean finish. Nice version of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
"O-it's an okay beer, reminds me more of an herbed/spiced lager than a pilsner. Maybe it's just not fresh. Still an easy and fun drinker though."
"Would recommend straight from the 16oz can So Satisfying"
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a clean bitterness. Dry finish. Decent balance with the hop and malt. I find it to be a nice change of pace between stouts this winter. A well done pilsener."
""
""
""
"Overall: I appreciate a more American take on an Old World style, but this attempt fails in my opinion. The dry-hopping sounded like a good idea, but the flavors and balance are all off. If I am going for an Americanized pale lager in 16 oz tallboy, I'll take a New Belgium Shift any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A different but welcome take on the style."
""
""
"Excellent drinkability, could be a session beer or for a slow enjoyment. Slightly different from a traditional pilsner, given the fruity and citrusy tweak. A pilsner with an American twist, in my opinion enhanced. Didn`t get any off-flavor and has less than 2 months to expiration date."
"A spot on pilsner that brought me right back to my memories of being in Munich and Prague. Excellent representation of the style and by far the best beer I have had from Sixpoint to date. Highly recommended, especially if you are looking for a quality American lager."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a pilsner glass. Pours a orangish straw color with a white head that all but disappears. Smells of slight citrus but not much else. Tastes of citrus and hops, great taste. Beer goes down smooth for its light body and is perfectly carbonated. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Consumed on tap in a standard pint glass. Pours a rich golden hue, appears clear with some white head that fades, some limited lacing but not much. Smell and taste are very much of clean light malts, a bit more pilsner than lager on the taste. The hops balances out the malts nicely. This one is very easy drinking and could be consumed in quanity or enjoyed as a single."
"Golden-amber with a thin creamy head, nice citric noble hop aroma with notes of sweet, toasted malt. The taste is similar to the nose, it starts with a nice hop bite and then becomes refreshingly grassy and herbal with elements of citrus. The malt is not very prominent but does give a nice balance to the package. Very smooth and almost creamy in comparison to other examples in the style. This is a very good pilsner!"
"This is a lovely pils. Very clean and very drinkable. It is definitely reminiscent of a German lager, but it has some serious American influences. I could drink a lot of this."
""
"Overall: tasty and drinkable ... what more do you need? I'll definitely look for this again the next time I'm in New York."
""
"The Crisp is crisp....not very smooth. The appearance is clear yellow with thin creamy white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The smell is mostly wet grain. The taste is sharp with Saaz hops and tinges of alcohol...plus a lingering aftertaste. After several swigs the beer smooths. The mouthfeel is medium to light in body with good carbonation. Overall it is ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another extremely well-crafted beer from Sixpoint. I'm loving the cans and I'm loving what this brewery is doing."
""
""
""
""
"16 oz can pours a medium amber with persistent fluffy white head - truly a beauty of a beer. Aroma is grassy with lemon, and caramel malt. Bitter pepper and grassy hops mark the flavor, although a bit soapy. Crisp is a perfect description for the mouthfeel - a nice hoppy bite, sharp to the tongue, mellowing in the finish. German Pilseners were my first ""quality"" beer love after making a trip to Deutchland and this one is a nice representation of the style. Would think this would make a great session beer for both craft and Miller Lite drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. This is a good go to pilsner."
""
"Taste is like the can says, crisp, very very crisp, carbonation is sharp and active, sweet malt presence up front and very clean, a bit bready, hops are still subdued but there is a light grassy bitterness in the aftertaste, finishes very dry."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real solid lager/pils. It's more hop than I think malt, and I usually like more balance and I want everything and the kitchen sink, but this is a worthy drink."
"O: A decent beer, but there are much better examples within this style. I don't think I would recommend this."
"Perfectly clear with an equally flawless coloring. Two fingers of firm frothy head and good lacing. Delicate clean aromas show the art in this one. Light bready malt underpins a melange of hop notes with lemon and grass giving a delightful fruitiness with a spicy a faintly peppered edge. Taste has me teetering on the fence of perfect. Balance is superb with a light sweet malt base that pushes into lemon and grass. Firm bitterness is quite smooth followed by a gentle buttery biscuit that lingers after the swallow. A bit of drying mintiness a herbal hops as well in the finish and swallow. Feel is crisp with a softness on the tongue from the mild but active carbonation. Deeply thirst quenching and satisfying. Medium light weight is spot on. Drinkability is off the charts as is the overall character to this beer. A Darn near perfect pilsner imo."

"Overall (4/5): The Crisp might not move the needle that much amongst craft beer enthusiasts, but it's a pretty special, respectable beer–one that gives craft lagers a good name. Eminently drinkable and refreshing, and conveniently packaged in 16 ounce tallboy cans, I would go to this if ever I want a change of pace from the hop monsters and bold Belgian ales I normally drink."
""
"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, hazed, orange-copper color with a filmy, sparse, white coating on the surface. Aromas of roasted grains and buttery sweetness. Light and subtle. Flavors are buttery, as well, but with a crisper feel at the end with some heavy roasted qualities. Slightly tangy with some floral highlights throughout, also. Buttery and tangy aftertaste leading to a slick, crisp, clean finish. Heavier than most Pils brews, but tasty."

"O: Nice summer beer."
""
""
"O: I like how I notice the blends of the German and the Czech styles of pilseners. I know its labeled as a German, but that doesn't bother me. I would have this again."
"Overall, this just isn't my style of beer. Pilsners just do not do it for me in any way shape or form. The flavor is sapped by the lager yeast and it just tastes like lightly hopped water. Water is cheaper and better for me so I will stick to that and look elsewhere to satisfly my session ale necessities."

"Medium to slightly light bodied; crisply carbonated; just a super refreshing, clean drinker. Very tasty indeed."

"O - The Crisp from Sixpoint is a very clean and drinkable brew with plenty of spicy, herbal hop characteristics balanced out but simple malt and lagered for a delicious and refreshing outcome; it's an exemplary American-brewed German style pilsner!"
"Another success from Sixpoint - the hops turn this from another bland lager into a flavorful, refreshing treat. Would get again."
""
""
"O - Nice crisp pilsener that is quite refreshing on a hot day. I would definitely get this again."
"Pours a darker yellow with a small frothy head that fades fast. Smell is not very potent, bready with a slight hop presence as well as yeast. The taste is sweeter than expected, with the bready flavor coming through followed by a slight bitter but nice hop flavor. The beer finishes with a more classic lager feel, light mouthfeel, and the hops coming on a bit stronger in the aftertaste. Overall a nice beer, the flavors are great and not overpower, a nice beer for the summer."
""
"Notes: Dam this German Pilsner is tasty in other words it's freaking remarkable. The dry finish is incredibly spot on. Oh yeah and one other thing I wanted to mention it's a Lager oh hell yeah. Cheers."
""
""
"M- Light and refreshing, carbonation seemed a little low to me."
"The palate opens with a moderate bitterness with flavors of lemon peel, really green grass and dusty earth. Very snappy IMO. The malt profile is a blend of pils, honey and a little bit of caramel-like malts. The pilsner malt does taste a little raw, lending a mild doughy flavor. However, the sweetness is a little bit on the high side (and the solution isn't to amp up the hops, which are already a little too high for the style), but still does work. With flavors of mild honey and a lingering bitterness (lemon peel, earth) on the finish, this light bodied beer is pretty clean (I can't pick out any sulfur) and enjoyable. The mid-palate is faintly watery, but it isn't too much of a distraction. Light in body, moderately resiny and with a medium-high level of carbonation, this feels good on the palate. In some ways, it seems like the higher hopping level was chosen to add a snappy, resiny feel to offset the relatively soft water, and it does strike me as a bold and distinguishing step. Nicely done, this is possibly the most enjoyable Sixpoint beer I've had."
""
"O: I love the fact that the lager yeast takes a back seat in the flavor department, allowing the real flavors of the beer to come through. Crisp, enjoyable, and easy to drink. Definitely worth a try"
""
""
""
"O- This is really an outstanding, fresh, flavorful, refreshing, and like the name implies a crisp pilsner."
"A great hot weather drinker."
""
"The body, light but almost medium, is extremely refreshing, balancing a constant crispness with a likewise constant smoothness that makes for easy sipping and refreshment. While a very nice beer all around, the feel is perhaps its best aspect."

"16oz can, pours a darker golden color with a fizzy white head that holds decent retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are fresh with pilsner malt, grass, yup - crisp. Tastes are, well, crisp. Pilsner malt, grassy, sharp hop bite on the finish. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium, but sharp, crisp, and clean on the slightly drying finish. I had this one last week, but didn't give it a full review; then picked up another one yesterday when I thought I missed something when I saw the high scores it has received. I still think it's good, not great."
""
"Just a plain good pilsner with tons of flavor and perfectly clean."
""
""
"This pours a golden straw color with a musty pilsner aroma. It’s not a heavy grassy Saaz hop assault but they are definitely there. Some hoppiness on the flavor as this beer certainly lives up to its name. Was it good? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Definitely? But I wasn’t as enthusiastic about it as some other craft pilsners I’ve had recently from the central Texas area. Still glad to see this and I’d definitely drink it again if given half a chance."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is crystal clear yellow/golden with great carbonation. The best on date was a week ago, but this was still a good experience. Smells like cheap beer, but in a good way. The taste was sweet, like straw, buttery. I do not normally drink pilsners, but I enjoyed this one. I’ll have another."
""
"Pretty darn drinkable, nice pils. Would take this over many German Pils I tried over there (01-04)"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Lightly toasted malt sweetness upfront. Then the Lemon and grass hoppiness takes over. Bitter and a little tinny to the finish. Crisp, bright, metallic palate. This beer is refreshing and almost energizing."
"a pretty good pilsner. this really isnt one of my favorite styles, but it is one of my favorite breweries so i would drink this again. be that as it may, i feel this is a bit overpriced considering what it is, id almost be just as happy with a sixpack of PBR or urquell."
"Taste-Faintly grassy, pilsner malt, subtle citrus. Nice bite from generous amounts of German hops, indeed leading to a very ""crisp"" finish. Tasty and sessionable. A fine match for a plate of ""loaded"" nachos."
""
"Cheers!"
"Poured out a lightly hazed pale straw color with a fizzled collar for a head and only minimal lacing. Aroma is very florally hopped over the top of a biscuity / cracker malt and at times the flavor reminded me of chamomile tea with a side of honeyed buns for breakfast. Yet the hops retain a spicy character through and through. Body is light and just as crisp as the the name promised. Overall this is an excellent pils in a can."
"O: This is a really enjoyable, easy to drink, and refreshing beer. This is definitely sessionable and a very well balanced beer with respect to flavor. I have had this one many times and will likely have many in the future as well."
""
""
""
"Drinkability- Easy drinking, nicely hopped Lager. It’s got enough of a hop bite to keep me interested yet still remains crisp and clean. I really enjoyed all 4 cans and will get more of this when I can. Thanks Adam!"
""
""
"O. This is an interesting beer that has a nice refreshing sweet lemony taste, but it's got an American craft beer feel to it. Kind of like a Brooklyn Bitburger or something."
""
"This ""pilsner"" is not for the purist, but it quite enjoyable and refreshing just the same. I would not describe it as crisp as there is a somewhat heavy sweetness present."
"O- This is the best pilsner I have ever had, hands down."
""
""
"Flavor is similar with grassy hop bitterness and light crackery pils malt, and a bitter crispness that certainly lives up to it's name. Light and easy drinking with plenty of hop character, unique and flavorful in the vein of Prima Pils, maybe slightly more balanced and less bitter. Definitely traditional though, and plenty drinkable."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very good and flavorful pilsner. Quite drinkable and well done overall - things nicely in balance and yet forward in flavor rather than going too smooth and mild. I think my only disappointment is the aroma, which is quite mild and only gets a tad better as the beer warms up. Otherwise definitely worth the 4-pack I purchased so I enjoy it a few more times."
""
"Another treat from Dino! Thanks man! A style I wouldn't normally turn to but that's ok! Poured to Pilsner glass the beer is crystal clear straw with a nice 1.5 finger white head, good retention, and some lacing. The nose is as the name suggests, crisp, clean, a hint of earthy hops accompany the pilsner malts, makes for a very inviting beer. The flavor is very much the same, very approachable. Lighter bodied and very refreshing with a clean, sharp flavor, not too much, it's really good. Overall, this was a treat!"
""
""
"Not bad. I may get this again in the future given the right circumstances."
""
"O: I really like this beer, if I can't get Prima Pils in KY (and I can't) then I will happily ""settle"" for The Crisp. This is going to be a summer staple for the pool and yard. Excellent beer, worth seeking out if you like a good pils."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is full of grass and bready pilsner malt, as expected. The flavor is very clean and crisp. I get a lot of malt, with some grass and a lot amount of bitterness. Easy to drink and quite refreshing. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Not as carbonated as I feel a Pilsener should be. Sweet grain malt bill, some tart flavor. Herbal and earthy hops finish. Some lemon peel. On the heavier side of medium body. Clean finish. Some lingering grainy sweetness on the front of the tongue. Clean sweet and smooth. I really think something called the crisp should be a lot crisper though."
"D - Pretty easy to drink - I had no problem finishing the entire 16oz can while watching a TV show. I enjoyed this significantly more than Resin, but I prefer Metropolitan Flywheel which is available to me locally."
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance is approriate for the style. As it warms, this gets bettetr, as you would expect for the style. I have tried 5 Sixpoint beers and they all have been outstanding beers that I intend to buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very smooth, easy to drink, balanced very flavorful. About as good as you can get for the simple style. Balance is what makes this beer so great. Recommended for sure."
""
""
"O: I can't believe how big the smell is, and how small the taste is. I could literally drink this until I couldn't move any longer. Just so smooth, tasty, and smells great. Absolutely recommend you try this."
""
"On tap. Pours a semi-translucent dark amber with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. Aromas of citrus, grass, malts and a bit sour. Taste is a nice sweet maltiness with some citrus hops. Flavors of grains and cereal. Almost a cookie aftertaste. Creamy mouthfeel. This sure does taste like a hopped up Pils. Overall, a Pilsener worth trying."
"Although The Crisp shows a lot of finesse, many of the minor nuances may go largely unnoticed to novice drinkers of those of us who are not in analysis mode, I would prefer to see a more assertive balance toward hops while keeping the stern malt profile constant. Perhaps I just prefer drier and hoppier German Lagers, but this is no slouch as it reels closer to Dortmunder Exports at least in malt profile."
""
"Pours nice golden yellow with a nice off-white head. Some nice grainy malty notes and slightly sweet. Goes down smooth but some nice grassy hops throughout each sip. The mouth feel is light bodied and crisp with the persistent carbonation and it ends on a slightly sweet note. I was surprised that Beer Advocate classified this as a German Pilsner, it reminds me more of a Helles - maybe because of its soft sweet roundness. My palate loves the North German pils (Prima Pils and Jever). Overall, it is a good lager though."
"O - this is a perfect anytime beer. had it last summer and it was great in the can. poured this one in a glass and it's march - still perfect!"
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I thought this a quite drinkable Pils and one I’ll be happy to have again. That said when given a choice I’d opt for either Prima Pils from Victory as a North German style Pils or the Stoudts’ Pils as a more South German style. Both are a bit more crisp that this. My overall impression of the beer is that this is a good one and while not my favorite Sixpoint beer one that is well made and enjoyable. It would be especially nice to have at a dinner that features good food and good conversation with friends."
""
""
"Overall: Truth in advertising. This is a nice and crisp lager. I could have several of these especially in the summer. Nothing mid blowing like some other Sixpoint brews, but solid."
""
""
"Excellently made lager. Fantastic lager."
""
""
"o- really nice to see a craft lager with a punch of hops, I always love when I run into one of those."
""
""
"In the fast paced craft beer movement lagers have been trying to catch up, Crisp is proof that things are turning around and gives a better view of what a modern lager can be ... taking from old while brewing from new minds."
"I'm assuming because this is out of date it's no good but I don't think fresh my scores would improve much."
""
"This beer just arrived in Indiana last week. It pours a light bodied honey gold in color with a one finger head. The nose is essentially smooth and mellow pale malts with a touch of honey. The flavors are mild and dry. You get plenty of pale malts with a touch of honey and it finishes dry with moderate bitterness. The level of bitterness is surprising, and more than I anticipated. The more I sip it the more floral components I get, yet not in a hoppy manner. The hop presence is minimal. This beer drinks light in body with a dry finish. The dryness and bitterness keep me from really endorsing it but it’s a decent pils in a can."
""
"Medium body and carbonation would be great in a pale ale or any number of other styles; but not in a German Pils. It's too creamy and, frankly, not crisp enough. In fact it's nowhere near its namesake. I was disappointed by this, especially after hearing many good things about Sixpoint. I will gladly give them another shot though."
"O: a good pilsner, I quite like this beer and will be tempted by it on tap, but its not worth the price for 4 pack. It is not, however, among my favorite American pilsners (Prima, Sly Fox, Stoudts, Holy City)."
"Overall, a great pils. Clean, crisp and full flavored. You're not going to get much more flavor in a 5.4% beer. Delicious."
""
"D: these are very, very crushable. well balanced flavors make that possible. tasty brew."
"Technically classified as German pilsener on here even though it's a mix. I get more of the Bohemian side out of it as it's got more bready character is less clean with less hops. Gut, but sehr gut would lean more toward the German pils side."
"Poured out as a nice golden color. The head was creamy and white in color. The head settles and just leaves a thin retention on top of the beer. The smell of the beer is a loaded with some noble hops. It's got the pilsner\lager aromas as well. The taste of the beer is pretty solid, good amount of bitter hops in there along with a malt bill that leaves your taste buds tingling. The mouthfeel of the beer was light and soft, it leaves a sharp tingle on the tongue that I liked a lot. Overall it's a pretty damn good brew honestly. I was impressed."
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a good balance of earthy notes, pale malts and crisp, earthy hops. Slight dry bitterness up front with a spicy, pine hop presence that is nicely balanced by pale, biscuity pilsner malt, grass, straw and light fruit. Well balanced and sessionable but kind of standard for the style."
"I really wish this were available around here for a hot summer day. I’m not a big Pilsner guy, but this one would hit the spot in June vs this cold January afternoon."

"A marvelous crisp lager in a can! I think I'll spring for a 4 pack next time instead of singles."
"Im not sure if I would consider this to be a German Pilsner, but its deff a great brew; unique and full of flavor."
"O- This beer really threw me for a loop. I have not idea whether this beer was designed to come out like this, or maybe I just got a bad can. I'll more than likely get another single of this just to make sure I didn't get a bad can. If it turns out different/better, I'll definitely re-review. Cheers."
"O: Pretty good pilsner, easy drinking and refreshing."
""
"Overall this (again) is a sixpoint brew that I would love to try again."
"Disappointed. After the amazing experience of the Righteous Rye, this is just lousy, enough so that I have no interest in finishing the last twelves ounces. Sadness is a wasted beer."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, doesn't have that malt presence that is in great German Pils or even something like Prima Pils."
"O: The most hop presence I have ever had in a pilsner. Very drinkable and bitter, it was almost like a pale ale. I wish they all were like this."
"For you pilsner fans out there this beer is killer and I definitely recommend it."
"O - A really nice Pilsner, stacks up well with Oskar Blues' Mama's Little Yella Pils as one of my favorite American-made Pilsners. Glad I gave this a second chance!"
"Nice job, Sixpoint! ""The Crisp"" would make a sublime urban poolside summer beer."
""
""
""
"Transparent orange in body with petite white head that leaves a mist on to the brim of my pint glass. Aroma of citrus notes, light grass, lemon zest, and floral notes. Flavors of herbal hops, pine, light citrus, floral notes, booze note as the drink warms, and a slight hop spiciness as well. Light in body with light carbonation. A spicy, herbal pilsener that can be enjoyed straight from the can. Redneck-style for the reserved craft beer yankee."
"The Crisp is the poet laureate of the beer world: it has a sweet, clean, honeyed maltiness, a heathery, lemony hoppiness that is like a soft voice whispering in your ear and a gratifying finish that is not cut but patiently untied. It pays homage to the old world but still toes the official line that American craft beer must be bolder and juicier."
""
"D: Drinks nicely, I'd call this a staple. Along with Joe's American Pilsner, it's one of the best ones that I've had. It's just what dinner called for."
"This was an OK quaff but seemed to play a little too loosey goosey in the flavor and feel department for a Pilsener. This could be tightened up a good bit in spots."
""
"O: A unique American-flavored German pils with a lot of maltiness but a bit too much sweetness for me. Still a very nice brew."
"Light body with good carbonation. Overall this one isn't anything special, but I don't hate it. I could see myself getting this again on the right occasion. It's sure easy to drink."
""
"D - very likable beer with delicate pilsner flavors; not too malty, not too floral, no bitter bite at end but just hoppy and tangy enough to maintain balance; similar to a Belgian golden pale without the Belgian yeast and ripe fruit flavors; very drinkable"

"D/O- First Sixpoint beer. I thought it was good for what it was. The weird citrus thing going on at the end of each sip...wonder if it could be remedied by a fresher can, I shall find out someday. If so, I'd like to put down quite a few of these. Thanks mcb4538!"
"Nice crisp, refreshing beer. Enjoyed it a lot, and I still have another 4 pack to drink."
"M: A good beer, sweet malts and enough hops to leave a mark."

" I really warmed up to this one after a few servings. A nice beer to bring hiking and make a fine treat on the summit."

"O - A nice pilsener, perfect amount of hops used = worth buying."
""
"Overall it was good and enjoyable, but I'll need to try this again as there seemed to be something just a tad different (don’t want to say “off”) about the taste so I need to give it another chance."
"Sixpoint marches to the beat of their own drum, and this offering is no different. Not quite to style, but a good beer nonetheless."
"O -- The complexity balanced with light body make this a very interesting and tasty beer. The balance of flavors and fruit esters aren't terribly clean for a Pilsner, so that loses points, but this is well worth recommending to anyone looking for a lighter-bodied, yet far from bland beer."
"O - Nothing special for me, can't quite put my finger on it, but it didn't do it for me."
"SENSATIONAL, MUST TRY!"
"O: Overall bittering, but the grain base and hop palate seems to fall south of expectations of german standard pilsners. Drinks better as a pale lager in my opinion. Not ideally what I envision when grabbing for a german style pilsner. A bit outside the box, but maintains a decent enough flavor to warrant purchase as long as you are not as concerned about the style as the flavor or enjoyment. Drinks a bit big style, not your typical light summer time affair."
"Too hopped? Maybe. Doesn't much matter to me; The Crisp is really good one way or another. I would drink it regularly if I could."
"Hazy blonde with a thin white head of different sized bubbles. The aroma is grainy with a touch of lemony citrus. Untoasted grain and plenty of funky herbal hops, this beer is unlike any German Pils I've encountered but I like it. Lightly creamy and effervescent with a hop oily finish. Good stuff albeit a little weird tasting in a good way. Recommended."
"O: Nicely balanced between the malt and hop bills. There's some huge flavors in this for a Pilsner. The dry hopping is very apparent in the finish. Very light, easy drinking, refreshing and sessionable. A very satisfying Lager!"
"Overall - Overall, a damn good pilsner in my opinion. Such a wonderful change of pace from what I have been drinking (things like big stouts, imperial porters, DIPAs, and stuff like that). Would I session a number of these cans? Probably not, but this is a darn good pils, especially for what the weather is here right now (hot as hell, with some humidity to boot). I'd say this one is certainly worth a try. Thanks trxxpaxxs! Also as a side note, I just have to say I love that these come in 16oz cans! That's probably my favorite container type out there currently!"
"Great beer, best served outdoors in the sun."
"Pours a clear yellow and orange color and grows a massive, three-finger head that is pillowy, eggshell white, and fluffy. It hangs around for quite some time, and leaves generous patches of bubbles on the glass. It smells of orange, lemon, watermelon rind, some wheat, straw and grasses, and a touch of yeast. Some bread and hop notes find their way into it as well. Tastes of citrus (orange and lemon), bread, yeast, floral hops, some grass/straw notes, and finally a bit of malt in the very rear. Mouthfeel is light, crisp on the tongue, smooth going down, and clean on the finish. Very refreshing. Overall, a very good pilsener that is going to get me back into the style."
"O: A very drinkable, delicious beer with just enough complexity to keep you interested. Mostly, though, it's all about the aftertaste."
"o - Overall a really good pilsener from Sixpoint. Very refreshing and some nice fruit and hops with the usual grains and bread. Could definitely have a few of these and would want to. Would have it again."
"It does pour a nice gold color with a good amount of head -soapy and foamy. Aromaa is clearly the German/Czech type hops and it is delivered in the taste too. I guess its the drinkability where this beer suffers as I just dont want more than 1. I am confident that these will only get better as Sixpoint is a brewery I think quite highly of. It almost seems that these are better than the same beer off the same 4-pack were a cpl weeks ago"
"It's still kinda OK tasting, but it's not really good. Maybe a visit to the brewery would reward me with an amazing fresh version, but this just goes back and forth too much between being ""yeah this is pretty good"" and then suddenly going ""yuck."""
"72."
"D: Not at all what I would expect out of a pilsener..."
"Overall-nicely done Sixpoint, Seek this out."
"i think beers like these come down to differences in reviewing. personally, i rate a beer very simplistically: did i enjoy the beer or not? some other users tend to rate a beer by how true-to-style said beer is. while this is by no means a ""pilsner"" by definition of style, it is still a good beer. i don't think it's very reasonable to slam a brewery just because they made a beer that wasn't brewed exactly to a certain style. all that being said, i like this stuff."
"Either they just aren't accomplished brewers or were smokin some serious crack when making this recipe."
"O: I'm not typically a pils kinda guy, but this was a pretty darn good beer. Something different than the usual spread I enjoy and it was a nice change of pace!!"
"A really great pils. I was very surprised by this one, I'd be drinking a lot more of this stuff if it were around."
"O: Excellent beer, an easy drinker. Hell of a lot more than I ever expected from a can of beer. I guess I'll check to see what else Sixpoint has to offer."
"Mouthfeel is hits the nail on the head with a name like the Crisp. Light body feel that is a bit dry but oh so crisp and refreshing. Overall, I've been impressed by each of the Sixpoint beers I've had so far and the Crisp is no different. It's amazing a delicious beer like this is the same style the gave the world BMC. Long live the traditional Lagers!"
"O: Pretty much defines a great american pilsener. Might be tied with Victory Prima Pils for that title."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is very floral and herby with some bready malt aromas. Very nice. Taste is of very tasty floral and herb hops up front with a malt backbone. I am also getting some citrus flavors on the aftertaste. Like the name implies, this beer is very crisp and clean in the mouth. Overall, this is an awesome beer with delicious aromas and tastes. Probably the best beer of the style I have ever had."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice flavorful beer to drink for a long time."
"16oz. can served in a Spiegelau pilsener. Pours the color of straw with a semi-hazy clarity and a three inch, dense, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Thick bands of textured lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is grassy with a trace of citrus zest and a ripe, earthy/floral character most likely attributable to the hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a light, bready quality that comes out behind the citrus. There's also faint spiciness in the flavor profile that adds a little additional interest. Mouthfeel is light-medium, but closer to light, with an even, refreshing carbonation. I was actually expecting more of a semi-dry finish to this. Overall, I found this beer to be immensely drinkable and refreshing. I feel like there's a little more happening here than you would generally find with the style, but I'm okay with it. A really easy drinking offering and a nice bridge beer for BMC drinkers in my opinion."
"This is how a a german pilsener should be. Its crisp, and without flaws. It is crisp, refreshing, and very balanced. Stacks up with any of the great German pilseners out there. For those of you who appreciate pilsners, this is a great micro option from a great brewery in Brooklyn. It goes great with grilled sausages, and any other type of great German food."
"Overall, this is 2nd best American pilsener I've had. Prima Pils has a MUCH stronger hop presence and is bit more ""crisp."" This is an incredibly solid brew in a style I don't really care for. I certainly would seek this out again for the summer months and for friends who are used to macro. To me, this is a good beer. To others, I'm sure it is a very good beer. I wish I had it fresh."
"Overall, this is a quality pilsner that is welcome in my fridge anytime. Definitely lives up to the name."
"O - Oh, I'll be getting it again. Very enjoyable, just can be deceiving from the name. It comes off as a light, refreshing lager; and its just not. Still no let down here from 6pt. So far, their stuff is spot on great!"
"O - excellent; very drinkable and maintains interest; summer session that rewards reflection"
"Overall- huge disappointment, this does not live up to the name ""The Crisp"""
"16 ounce can. Pours into a conical pils style glass quite nicely. A slightly hazed golden color going on with a bright white head. Aroma has a nice cereal grain complexity lightly toasted malts with an herbaceous grassy kick to it. Nice rounded sweetness, mild grassy herbaceous bitterness. A rolling malt profile is like fresh baked bread lightly toasted with a nice crisp fruitiness a touch of sulfur and lingering bittering hops with herbal/citric flavors arising. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a sturdy level of carbonation going on, overall a pretty nice beer. I could definitely get comforable sipping on this on a warm fall or hot summer day, refreshing quality makes it go down way too easily."
"The Crisp pours into the glass a subtle yellow color with faded golden highlights. A inch of burnt sugar tinted foam on top that vanishes and leaves little stick. Scents include pale malt, a heaping of German hop variety, pilsner malt, Etc. Taste comes on pretty strong which is a good thing although a bit too big for a pils. If I were mashing styles i would put this at German IPA. A lot of grassy earthy hops with a nice bready bite. Biscuit flavor is very large, pilsner malt as well. It's amazing how much taste this has with such a low ABV. Feel is bitter and in between light and medium. It's carbed up well in the 1st 1/2 but the second flattens it out. I enjoyed the first half but struggled through the 2nd. It's just too much of a good thing, that being the German influence/ingredients. This screams USA interpretation of a style. If I opened a second CAN right after this I would not be able to get through it."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. A very nice bitterness, quite refreshing. As the can said, there isn't much for this beer to hide behind, and they did a good job with it."
"Overall I'd say it was a good solid pilsner. I should point out that I am not a fan of the style, but I would have this beer again if it were available. It's perfect for a warm summer night when you don't want to be assaulted by hops or drink some viscous stout."
"O - Heavier than the average pilsner, especially on the first sip. Get past that first hump and your diligence will be rewarded by a solid drinker. Not exactly the light, refreshing 'lawnmover' beer you expect from a pils, but worth trying."
"O- Would be so much more disappointing if I tried this outside on a hot summer afternoon. Just too heavy and not refreshing or crisp like a pilsener should be with this name!.. Damn, this beer is officially NOT Crisp"
"Overall so far I am impressed with the brewery so far, wasn't the biggest fan of the cream but every other offering seems to be very drinkable and full of flavor. It's amazing how this beer makes me question where Miller goes wrong with the typical pills. Even the price is close to a 24oz Miller lite and I would prefer this one hands down to anyone. Recommended."
"I was a bit skeptical picking this beer up. Boy was I wrong! The can captures all the flavors of the hops and malt bringing together a really well put together beer. Pours a yellow color with a fair sized head and plenty of carbonation. Will definitely give it buy again."
"Pours a bright golden body with a fluffy white head that leaves behind plenty of lacing. It smells very malty, bready. It smeels a little grassy as well. The taste is very clean and well balanced. It has a malty sweetness at first followed by a lingering hop bite that is pretty crisp like the name would suggest. A medium bodied beer with plenty of flavor makes this pilsner a great choice for a session beer anytime of the year."
"I've had hundreds of new beers since my last review on this site, but this one has inspired me to come back and share my thoughts. A really enjoyable pilsner, and brewed locally (I'm in Brooklyn now), so I'm filled with pride. A wonderful beer."
"all out i must say reminds me more of a good czech then a german. must be the bohemian in the wort. looks the part with a clear golden yellow body... not yellow almost green gold but yellow almost orange. nose is a bit off... older can. a hint of banana a bit too much for my liking. but nice nose of sweetness only a czech can have. floral pollen and hay. palate is crisp indeed. dry end but not as aggressive. formally proper. hint of stale banana but otherwise holds nicely. will have again as my next itch for a pilsner."
"Goldenrod color, just shy of completely transparent, as there is a tiny bit of haze. Airy head leaves a nice trail down the side of the glass. Aroma is bready, spicy grass, a hint of fruit. Taste is surprisingly complex for a pilsner. There is a touch of fruity hops to add depth to the malty backbone, and the Saaz flavor adds some - yes - CRISPness. It all cleans up in the end for a beer that's simply a pleasure to drink."
" "
"Pours a mostly clean golden straw with decent cap of white froth, good retention, little lacing. Scent is of grassy hops, bready and lightly sweet malts and a touch of lemon. Taste brings the components of scent together nicely, mostly clean, bready taste combines with light grassy hops, the sweetness is quite low and the lemon only peeks through occasionally near the somewhat bitter finish. Medium bodied, good carbonation but more hefty than crisp. A decent pilsner, quite clean overall."
"Pours a very clear moderate golden color with a huge white head and tons of sticky lacing as it goes down. Thin cap throughout. The nose brings some lightly-sweet grain and bread notes plus some floral and herbal hops. The flavor is a bit hoppy with mild sweetness. Good balance between grain and hops. Light body and fairly crisp, though a bit too sweet in the finish. Pretty good, though not quite as good as Sixpoint's other brews."
"O: What can I say? It's a remarkable beer. For a style that is ubiquitous and often poorly done by the imitators, The Crisp really stands out. A bit sweeter than I am used to from the style, but I welcome that. It is perfectly balanced and, frankly, a pleasure to drink. Who said lagers have to be boring? Will be seeking this when it hits DC."
"Overall: Definitely a great take on the style. Easily one of the best offerings from Sixpoint at this point. A very solid beer overall, and almost crazy drinkable."
"Overall: Very good but I would have enjoyed more aromatics as it says on the can it was dry-hopped but I know for a pilsener that is not generally a punch in the nose. Very good taste and that certainly raises my opinion of it. I have bought a lot of this over the summer and certainly regret none of it!"
"Has a wonderfully malty pilsner smell. The hit of honey-like sweetness up-front in the taste is off-putting. The bitterness eventually balances it out. Extremely short finish. Can't get past that initial sweetness, though, which seeming jarringly out of place in a pilsner. Might be good outside on a hot day, though"
"Overall (4.0): This is good. Real nice and solid, this is a good pilsner that’s exactly what I want a pilsner to be. That said, it’s not exactly rocketing into my top 10, but if I’m looking for a pilsner you can bet I’ll be coming back to this one. Good job, Sixpoint!"
"O - This has great drinkability. I could put down a 4-pack of this stuff easily on a hot summer day. This is a perfect beer to sit back and enjoy on a hot day in the sun. I definitely recommend trying this one."
"Craft Lager in a can, love it. Poured in to a SA perfect pint glass, the color is hazy gold, with a finger of white heading on top. Raw grains come through in the nose, though it is very clean smelling. Flavor is a bit metallic, with a sweet back end. Mouthfeel is indeed crisp, and refreshing as hell. Overall, I love this stuff."
"O- Really impressed with my first SixPoint brew. Especially since it's a style that isn't really up my alley."
"Too bitter for style if anything. Overhopped, maybe, would just appreciate being able to distinguish the hops in here."
"D - Pretty drinkable. I can't see sessioning with this one though, because of the numbing hop/sage combo. Or whatever that is that's numbing my tongue so hard. Might just be super hopped without the sage. Solid beer, nevertheless."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet on the front, sweet on the back, with a hint of bitterness overall. It is quite enjoyable as a pilsner goes, very drinkable, nice creamy mouthfeel, good finish. I like it. I'd have more it."
"A good domestic rendition of the style, quite dry and fresh."
"16 ounce can, best by Sept 29,2011. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a fairly dense 2 finger white head with great retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts. Some decent lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of honey, bread, lemon, grass, citrus, and a bit of spiciness. Very nice and inviting aromas. Taste of big breadiness, with lemon, grass, and citrus. Finishes with a grassy and spicy hop bitterness that is decently strong and lingers for a bit with lemon and citrus sweetness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body. Nice crisp and refreshing finish, as expected. Extremely drinkable and delicious stuff with no alcohol in the taste or finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Outstanding stuff, and a perfect summer beverage I would drink on a hot day."
"M/D - Medium body, no residual sugar, maybe a tad undercarbed. Ok to drink, hoping my palate is off or something because I love the 16oz cans."
"Poured into a pilsner a lighter lemony color with a nice fluffy white crown that left multiple broken rings of lace behind as it settles.Wow what alot going on in the nose,herbal and floral hops overtop of sweetish bread dough,the doughy aspect of the beer really stands up well to the hefty dose of hops.Herbal almost minty-like hop flavors really stand out at the onset,light caramel and crisp pizza dough malt flavors are fantastic!I have never even come close to rating a pilsner a ""5",I really liked Sudwerk pils,but this is the best pils I have had,its delicate and ""crisp"" but assertive,I will search this out and buy again,just fantastic."
"This is a very nice beer. I'll be happy to sip some more of these. I'll be taking some of these cans out on the waverunner for sure!"
"D - Uber refreshing with a ridiculously good mouthfeel... An outstanding German Pilsner... I would gladly welcome one of these in my glass any day, but especially on a hot summer day... Now that Sixpoint cans are readily available, I have yet to be disappointed..."
"This is good, definitely - but to me this beer is much heavier for the style than what I've had recently. Still quite quaffable and straightforward; I prefer a touch less body and more carbonation in my pilsners."
"O/D - What a refreshing and drinkable brew. It is a nice hop forward pilsner that has big flavor yet does not dominate the palate. This was my first Sixpoint beer and it has got me amped to try more."
"O: A nice German pilsner with lots of authentic taste and a very crisp, clean flavor and finish. The 5.4% ABV is nice and sessionable, and although this brew is a good summer option, I couldn't see having it on a regular basis. Still good for what it is though."
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, drinks incredibly smooth and quick. A nice pilsner from Sixpoint that I could drink regularly, although the $10 per 4 pack price point makes it a bit on the higher end."
"O: Simply put, Sixpoint's Crisp is the best American interpretation of a Pilsner I've ever had, and is easily a top two or three session beer in my book. I don't care that it's not ""imperial"" or ""wood aged", it's a damn fine beer that you need to seek out ASAP."
"Very tasty and a worthy dedication to its German brethren."
"Taste follows the nose, starts sweet, lemony fresh in the middle, closes with a hops bite. Everything comes together nicely. Mouthfeel is way smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Talk about a thirst quencher."
"Overall – A very tasty beer that would definitely work very well as a summer refresher. It actually kind of reminded me of a ginger-ale soda. It's worth seeking out and I'm happy I have another 7 cans in the fridge. Looking forward to trying the other Sixpoint beers i bought as well."
"Overall an excellent beer. I hope I can find these for sale in CT. It was delicious!"
"Overall decent, and slightly tasty for a Pilsener, but I wish that there was a bit more going on here."
"O- excellent beer. Very easy drinking"
"WOW!"
"Overall: Another excellent brew by Sixpoint. The name is pretty descriptive, and helpful."
"Hazy orangey golden color with some brown mixed in. Cream colored head which stuck around for almost the entire beer. Some lacing. Smell was sweet and grainy. Flavor was malty at first but finished up with some dry hops. Sticky mouth feel at times but smooth overall. Sweet, bitter, flavorful, and fresh. CRISP is a perfect name. Really enjoyed this beer and I plan on seeking this one out again. Happy to see Sixpoint on the shelves."
"O: A good pilsner. Not the prettiest, but it's nicely hopped to make it both flavorful and refreshing."
"O: A refreshing, clean, crisp pilsner. Good for hot summer days."
"Not bad, but not great. A decent pils that doesn't really hit the high notes, but puts together a solid package nonetheless. Still below my favourites of the style."
"o - overall wanted to try this, but not a huge pilsner fan, this beer however shone through as fairly solid in my opinion. it really hit the spot."
"O: A supremely drinkable beer and yet another solid offering from the brewery which is rapidly becoming one of my favorites."
"Okay, this one is hitting the spot like crazy. This has to be in the top 3 German Pilseners I've tried. Kudos to Sixpoint and kudos to Joe, but where's the reference to the ""Sehr""(very, in German)?? ;^)"
"While sixpoint does many wonderful things with this beer, I think it is important to point a few things out. Lager beer is not traditionally dry-hopped. Dry hopping is traditional in english ale brewing. I find that the aroma in the crisp is too ale like. While the mouthfeel and taste are purely pilsener like, the aroma is misleading. Also, Lager beer should be drank cold. The 16 ounce can gets too warm before you get down to the end, releasing that DMS flavor, they so cleverly tried to mask by dry hopping. Great can. great story. But the crisp is too malty sweet. The bitterness is an after note. There are some great Lager moments in this beer though."
"The beer pours a light golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice all malt lager scent along with an array of German hops. It's crisp with actual malt character. The taste is great! It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor along with a damn fine German hop bitterness. It's flavorful with a solid malt base; easy drinking with just enough sweetness to balance the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a lager I can get behind. It's ""crisp"" with sacrificing the flavor."
"This is a highly hopped pils. Good starting pale malt flavor (no grain as in the smell). Peppery bitterness that lasts long after the swallow. Very rich for a pilsner. A very special beer to drink if you prefer your pils bitter."
"Excellent entry for a novice to appreciate real beer and complex enough for the advanced aficionado. Thanks Sixpoint for creating this beer."
"Nice light pour, golden straw in color with a tight fizzy head of white foam that quickly gained ground and rose up through the glass. Nice an light aroma, clean, light spice and yeast notes, hints of light citrus, wheat, light cloves, really well done. As I take the first sips, clean, crisp flavor, tight citrus, rich light grains, spakrling carbonation. Really it just worked. Light bready finish left a light touch of flavor on the palate but mostly clean after the last sip."
"LOVE PILSNERS AND LOVE THE CRISP"
"O: A pretty decent pilsner, especially for an American made one. Pretty refreshing."
"NOTE TO THE HARD WORKERS AT SIXPOINT: PLEASE CAN MORE BEERS! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"
"i look forward to trying the other ones"
"D- the crisp is a great german pilsner. Put it next to prima as the ultimate lawn mowing brew. I want more"
"Well balanced with an initial doughy sweetness followed by a crisp clean hoppy finish. Light and zippy mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation. All around great beer. Probably the best American made German pils I've ever had."
"O - Overall I really like this beer. An incredible surprise from sixpoint. One of the best pilsner i've had. A definite buy for me."
"I was thrilled to see the beer in the can. Just as refreshing and flavorful as the draft version. I'll be buying another four pack soon."
"O: This is what you imagined beer tasting like, when you were a young lad, and you saw the big imposing American macro advertisement in your favorite team's ball park. Until the day you realized that the american macro is for frat parties, and beer pong, and to be disrespected. This is what a pilsner should have been my first time around."
"Clear gold with a soapy cap of white foam. The frothy head fell quickly, leaving a thin skim of bubbles on top of the beer and quite a bit of clumpy lacing on the glass. Floral and grassy hop aroma, a little spicy, with some dry malt and fruity undertones. Hoppy and malty up front, fruity, then dry bitterness kicks in towards the end. More floral and spicy notes, light citrus. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel rather than crisp, moderate carbonation. Overall, pretty solid and a tasty beer."
"Overall, quite an impressive German-style pilsner. Worth trying."
"Lighter body, nice carbonation. Very easy to drink. Nice amount of character."
"O - I wouldn't have pegged this as an American pilsner. It is extremely balanced in almost every way. Mouthful could be a little more round but the flavors are so nice its a small detail. Excellent summer drinking."
"overall, its a decent hoppy lager that doesn't quite excite me like Noble Pils or a fresh Prima Pils, but one that I wouldn't mind drinking again or recommending to a crossover drinker."
"A delicious, highly drinkable beer in the Pilsener style. One of the few American Pilseners that adds it own unique character to the style but keeps it right in the pocket its known for."
"Would I buy more of it? - definitely. Great beer. Loved all 16 oz. of it and will certainly be buying more cubes!"
"Many thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a deep golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malts and hops are in there. Taste is a bit hoppy for this style, some malts are present, finishes bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall while not a bad beer, I feel it is a little bit over hopped for this style."
"Overall a great beer, pretty much the definition of sessionable, great crisp lager flavors, a nice malt flavor and aroma, and just the right about of fresh grassy mild hops of which get just a bit too spicy and bitter on the finish, but I'm just nitpicking at that point."
"Overall, its a good offering from sixpoint. I should probably get out to the brewery this summer."
"These boys know what they are doing in the CAN! The Crack & Glug netted two foamy fingers of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a very grassy hops flavor, Saaz perhaps, but I could not quite place it. Mouthfeel was medium with a soft, grassy hops presence on the tongue. It was definitely a German-style Pils as opposed to a Czech Pils, given the muted nature of the hops. Yinz want to know what to CAN next? A Czech Pils! Go for more than just a kiss of the hops, you buncha Schlitz! I have to admit, it was crisp, both in terms of taste and finish, but it wasn't crisp enough. It should have been as crisp as lettuce or celery, but it was only carrot crisp. I'm feeling pretty crisp about now. CAN I see myself putting this into the cooler? Sure! I'm not that hung up on crispness."
"At first I get reminded of macros I have had but with a few sips and some time it really gets better."
"Golden yellow with a large amount of fluffy white inch high head. Lemon grassy aroma with a hint of soured malt. The flavor has a lemon citrus bite. A sweet and light malt body with a grassy and sour lemon finish. Crisp and biting at the end but not dry."
"Overall: Really an outstanding beer that is now a candidate to be drank all summer long. Between this and Sweet Action, Sixpoint is really killing it on the lower side of the ABV scale."
"O/D-Third Sixpoint I have tried (still need to try the Sweet Action). This one is my least favorite. Not horrible, but just not what I'm looking for. Bengali Tiger absolutely blows this one away, and the Righteous Ale also beats this one out quite easily. Give it a shot. For me, not my style."
"Very nice, refreshing pils with spot on carbonation. Crisp indeed, tingly, palate cleansing carbonation. Earthy, pine riddled hops showing spicy qualities with some floral accents on the finish. Bready throughout and really just a quaff monster. Would love to have these cans at my disposal in the lovely land of Ohio, well maybe not lovely."
"Best Before 18AUG2011 1029OK+"
"O - I'm really liking how Sixpoint crafts their beers to be quite uniqur and enjoyable. Loving the nanokeg cans. I enjoyed this by the pool and recommend this as a summer beer for pilsner lovers."
"Overall, this beer tastes very fresh, very crisp, and goes down very smoothly. Each ingredient really stands its own, yet the whole package just goes so well together! Though a relatively simple lager, there is nothing cheap about it. Really a fantastic session beer."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and can be considered sessionable."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice mix and balance of flavors that mix together well and avoid from feeling empty. It also stays super light and crisp without feeling empty."
"Previously, my favorite lager was Samuel Smith, but I now have a new favorite. And yes, it's now clear to me that the best brewery in Brooklyn doesn't have Brooklyn in its name."
"Thanks to Joe at Black Rock Wines and Spirits in Fairfield, CT for the sample of this, I will certainly be drinking more as this is one of the smoothest, most drinkable beers so far this year."
"This is the recently canned version. Pours a standard but very clean looking yellowy color, thin head. Nose is subtle grassy hops and some faint apple notes. Taste follows suit with a nice kiss of hops, earthy and musty, and a faint fruity notes of grain and some husk. Crisp (had to) and prickly on the palate, very very refreshing and drinkable. Great to be drinking Sixpoint at home on my couch - can't wait to try their other canned offerings."
"A well made pils, great grassy flavors. I wish it was just a bit more carbonated."
"O - this is one damn tasty brew that drinks so well. this beer definitely has it going on and would definitely recommend trying this one."
"O - a fine example of the style."
"On tap at Spritzinger in Brooklyn for $6/pint. Poured clear golden yellow with a short white head. Clearly an American take on the style, the hops dominated the character. They were the more floral, less spicy, type of Nobel hops, pretty similar to Sam Adams' Noble Pils. I'd guess Tettnanger. Overall it was a tasty, hoppy pils, but I wanted a little more depth from the malt (of which there wasn't much flavor) and variation in the hops."
"Bight golden, lively, with a creamy white foam head. Nose is very delicate with soft bready malt and floral hop aromas, and a hint of hard-boiled egg. Prickly carbonation up front. And, like its name suggests, this is one crisp--""very crisp""--beer. Nice bite of herbal and pith, with a quick snap of dry bitterness, and suggestions of mint and green wood. It eventually yields to a smooth, but firm, body. Malt character is expectedly light. Touch of honey and a complementary biscuity note that pairs well with the beer's crispness, and adds more depth to the overall dryness of the beer. Very quenching, more-ish and insanely drinkable. One of our favorite Sixpoint offerings to date. Tastes like a fresh import. Zwei Maß Crisp, bitte!"
"Good representation of the style and another fine effort from Sixpoint."
"twas finely poured from the taps at the Commons. Low, low carb barely floating atop the clear beverage. Morning toast, some granulation and grassy, earthy hops are in my nose. The beer is tasty, Munichly malty with some hop presence, fairly low bitterness. It is okay, good for an American rep of a German pils. I was in no way offended by this beverage. Quite drinkable in fact."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, with a clean, crisp character; a very well made pils"
"Six Point has crafted a relatively modest (in alcohol content) session pilsner that's exceptionally quaffable and deserves a higher ranking among the ""big"" craft breweries and their mediocre lager offerings."
"I would like a little more hop bite to my pilsner, but I don't think that is what Sixpoint was going for with this one. It certainly is crisp and quaffable, which means it was a success."
"D: A really nice pilsner. Not quite Prima good but a nice addition to the Sixpoint crisp lager line."
"MD- The nice amount of carbonation just add the drinkablility of this beer. While at the Spinnerstown with a coworker that doesn't get much beer variety I chose this over a bunch of DIPAs and stouts. It was a good choice for both us."
