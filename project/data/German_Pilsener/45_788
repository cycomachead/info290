3.85,5.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into a pilsener glass, an orange-yellow hue with an ample fluffy white head. Smells like doughy pale malt and assertive floral-spicy noble hops, pleasantly tangy and vibrant with a subdued rounded sweetness. Taste is saltine crackers, subtle lemon-lime citrus, faint celery stalk, white pepper, blackberry, maybe hints of apple, and a rounded corn-like sweetness: I think Brooklyn did indeed capture some preProhibition flavor here. Not overly green but does feature a more rounded floral citrus hop note, almost like perfumed tea, with a sweeter than usual malt backbone. Moderately carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel and thin but not watery body. Great pils in my book. I dig the sweeter malts and noticeable fruity hop flavors, although things don't stray too far from style guidelines. Top notch patio beer drinkable in quantity.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 25, 2014"

Some bubbles race to the top and the head falls slowly leaving lots of lacing. The nose is Sweet grain and herbal. It's got a bit of hop perfume on it and and is lightly lemony. The taste is clean , crisp and terrific. The mouthfeel is creamy but the carbonation is crisp so it's a nice tease to the palate. The grain is just sweet and the herbal is a touch spicy. The lemony hops take the back end and bring this to a medium dry finish with a small little hint of bitter. Lively and malty this has plenty of flavor to keep you satisfied as you drink three or four of these.","utopiajane","Feb 12, 2014"

Taste follows suit, nice sweetness from the malt, fruity hop notes, a fresh light note of that typical 'pilsner' flavor. Very nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, feels like you can drink a lot without feeling full. Overall a really great pils, very happy with it.","Twobeards","Jan 15, 2014"

3.84,5.2,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best before March 2013. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, pepper, apple, cracker, bread, earth, floral, grass, and herbal spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; but are quite mild. Taste of lemon zest, pear, pepper, apple, cracker, bread, earth, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal spiciness. Light grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, pepper, cracker, bread, grass, floral, light pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor complexity and balance of malt and hop flavors; quite dry on the finish; with zero cloying flavors present on the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pilsner style. Well balanced with nice complexity; very smooth a crisp to drink. Very enjoyable and well put together.","superspak","Dec 16, 2012"

I live in Hong Kong and we have quite a few Pilseners from Germany and Czechoslovakia to choose from but very few beers from the US. I love the style and have to say that this beer is very true to it. It has a lot of that clean, pilsener hop flavor that I love. A bit more than say a Konig, Krombacher, Bitburger or even a Rothaus, which is my favorite. The malts and hops are very well balanced and I highly recommend this beer even to a European or ""authentic"" pilsener fan such as myself. I was shocked by how good this beer is.

There's some honey as well, and the hop character is surprisingly restrained with a blend of floral and earthy with a little lemon. The hops are much more assertive on the palate. Opening with a blend of spicy hop flavor and doughy, bready malt, this beer has a very rustic malt character. Particularly bitter on the finish with some lemon peel, this beer is light in body and is amply carbonated. The bitterness is too high for the style (IMO), but apart from that, this is a solid pils.","DefenCorps","Apr 05, 2011"

Earthy and grainy with just a hint of sweetness on the back end. Mouthfeel is mildly dry and very lively. In the end, this was much better than I expected but won't be a regular in my fridge.

Great visible carbonation evident in streams of bubbles filtering up from the bottom. Smell was light, lots of grain with some hints of maybe corn or an earthy cereal, but nothing spectacular. Taste was good, you typical pilsner. Light on the flavor, big on carbonation. Smooth crisp mouthfeel. Not a real lingering flavor, but what was there was lots of grain and corn maybe, something else but it was hard to place. Very sessionable, as it was very light.

The taste confirmed that something was missing; either in the form of a less pronounced grain bill or a more pronounced noble hops bill. That being said, it did finish on a crisp dry note.

In general the taste, while good, may be missing a bit of assertiveness.

Crisp and invigorating nose of hops, grapefruit pith, cigar ash, dried corn, oats, not truly complex but its freshness keeps you pleased. Light-bodied with an enduring bitterness which dries out your throat in such a way that you take another sip to try and wet it down some. Orange and grapefruit citrus present, little malt or any sort of sweetness. Grains and straw, can't lose that suggestion of ash. The carbonation level is moderately high and adds to the overall high tone. Stylistically correct, requires both high summer temperatures and the outdoors to show best.

Start is sweet but quickly gets into some bitterness that doesn't linger at full strength, but stays a little longer than expected for a pilsener. The finish is a nice gradual dryness, not abrupt like macro pilseners. Good range of flavors for a pilsener. A usually simple brew style, hats off to Brooklyn this one that has fresh and more complex flavor. I'd pair this one with a real cheesy mushroom quiche.","mooseisloose","Oct 24, 2008"

Now I'm looking at the category and the German Pilsner is supposed by be much lighter -- light straw or golden. A respectable head, but not particularly dense. The smell is pleasant, but can't make out the hops. First swig really gives off an unpleasant metalic taste. Wonder if this may have suffered from mishandling during shipping. As I drink the beer, what I first considered metalic seems to mellow and gets less objectionable, but still not on style. The hops are in the background...can tell the balance is close but not quite there. Got better the more of it I drank. The citrus notes of the hops began to come out. Left a very dry crisp mouthfeel.

At first, the aroma was quite hoppy, I'm thinking Saaz hops, but as the beer settled, the more floral, honeyed notes came out. There is a bit of grainy husk in the nose, quite characteristic of a pilsner. The taste is sweetish in the mid section, a bit honey and floral but not all that lemony; the peppery tartness really raises itself towards the finish and it lingers into the aftertaste. The beer is reasonably crisp, there is a touch of butteryness in the middle as well. The beer is fairly light, not much creaminess at all, and it lacks biscuity malts. There is a dryishness as the beer segues into the finish, and the initial sweetness departs. Mouthfeel is a product of the lingering peppery tartness, fairly watery.

Smells rather hoppy here, but herbal and citric rather than spicy, with an intense and stinging aroma. Taste is rather mellow, herbal again. The malt and the hops do balance, while the malt is rather husky and robust rather than bready. Overall the beer is light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is actually rather low on carbonation--the initial bubles must have escaped and left it rather flat. The feel is light on the tounge, and finishes dry. This is a good beer for relaxing, but I must say something about it's taste seems...stale, less than fresh, with a lack of desirable bread or dough overtones. This is not simply due to bottle, as I've noted this when on tap as well. It just tastes somewhat second rate, as do most brooklyn beers, to my palate, sadly.

The aroma has some citrus notes initially, followed by some mildly spicy german hops, sweet grain, and toasted bread, interesting if not stylistically appropriate. The flavor begins with some lightly sweet malt flavors of brioche and toasted biscuit, along with some lemony tartness, and some slightly spicy german hops. The mouthfeel is crisp, light and refreshing, and drinkability is near perfect. This certainly isnt a traditional german pilsner, but the predominant lemon flavors suit me well and make this a great hot weather brew.","silver0rlead","Apr 15, 2006"

The start of this brew is a bitter hop bite on the tongue, with a lemon rind acidity that follows a small malty sweetness.

Some herbal/floral notes in the finish. Very clean tasting maybe a touch of white bread in the beginning and middle, but nothing that takes away from the overall crisp clean bite at the end. Mouthfeel is good as it is nicely carbonated which helps keep the flavour clean. Drinkability is good. Perfect for a hot summer day especially while grilling and doing yard work.

The smell was bready and slightly sweet with notes of malt and grain. The taste was slightly sweet malt with a tanginess. It was mildly hoppy with some floral hops overtones. There was a touch of fruity citrus as well, and the finish was good and hoppy. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. There was a light feel of tangy, soapy hops. This was a nice pilsner.","UncleJimbo","May 23, 2004"
2.89,-20.8,4.5,3,3,3,2,"A very average beer, and a decent representative of the style, however it's not my thang. The empty bitterness and lack of malt body really doesn't satisfy me in any way. Honestly, if I was blind-folded, I would call this a product of the big three (until it warmed up). I'll pass on seconds.","Mitchster","May 18, 2004"

While I loved the lagers there, it was ONLY lagers there, and when I came back, I delighted in ANY kind of beer that wasn't a lager. This is the first true pilsner I've had since then, and I'm happy to say I remember why pilsners are awesome. Pours a very light golden color, much clearer then most beers. A light lacy white head with good carbonation. Hoppy and light, this is a true summer beer, extremely drinkable, with a nice spicy hoppy taste. A good show from Brooklyn Brewery.","RocketWidget","May 04, 2004"
3.44,-5.8,4.5,3,3,3.5,4.5,"Neon white head radiates brightly from its position atop my beverage. Clear, crisp gold straw colored brew. Herbal and lightly flowery potpourri aroma -- very faint, as though you were smelling flowers from a few rooms over. Very light. The hops present themselves in a more earthy, floral way than a firm bitterness. Certainly, there's a little kick at the end of this brew, but this is by no means clear of estery sweetness. It lacks a certain crispness. Of course, it's nonetheless a very quaffable, tasty beer. Just not quite right in my book.","marburg","May 02, 2004"

Very refreshing, and drinkable especially with a good BBQ or with any fish or meat dish. Thats about all I can say about this brew.

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured into the glass a clear pale yellow gold color and was well carbonated. The head that was created was of the consistency of a cloud. Thick, rich, full, good height and was white in color. When poured it rose fairly quickly and lasted for some time then fell to a small light covering with presence on the edges. Some lace seemed to be present but not overly present. The aromas that came from the glass, were of clean and crisp citrus notes, sweet tones of fruit and malt, grains, floral hops, fresh grass and some bread or yeast tones in the finish of the nose. The flavors that came from this beer were also very crisp and clean, tastes of fresh floral hops, lemony citrus, grains, some spices come through in the middle, firm malt flavors all through, tones of grass and finished with a bit of yeast on the tongue. Bitter bit in the beginning, a bit creamy in the middle then finished crisp and dry. The aftertaste was light and fresh. Light bodied. With the light ABV this beer is a really good choice to just sit back and drink all day. A good representative of its style.","Jarod","Oct 16, 2003"

3.76,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Brilliantly clear blonde hue. Dense, dogged, porcelain white head leaves Belgian lace. Grassy hops meld with sweet, bready pilsner malt tones to lend a mellow, mowed lawn impression in aroma. Very clean. Clean, lightly doughy malt upfront in flavor is complemented by drying, permeating, but well integrated hop bitterness. Understated, sweetly grassy hop flavor mirrors that of the aroma. Trace earthy, hay like notes emerge mid palate, accentuating the crisp, dominant grainy dryness. Very well attenuated, and although nearly bone dry overall, the mouthfeel retains a supple viscosity conducive to easy quaffing. Finishes abrupt, with quickly fleeting notes of husk and sweet cracker. A quinessential German pilsner, with a concomitantly thirst inducing and satiating dryness. With a more pronounced hop flavor and a firmer malt backbone this would be outstanding. An immaculately crafted pilsner, nonetheless.","marc77","Sep 06, 2003"
3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Golden and clear in appearance. A big white head sits on top and stays quite well. The aroma is characterized by a lemony presence, along with a nice spicy hop twang and some smooth malt underneath. Spicy hops are the most present in the flavor, making themselves known all over the palate. Lots of sweet and grainy malt backs the hops up. I'm detecting just a little yeasty spiciness in the back, which is very nice. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall, this is pretty impressive for a pilsner. Nice job, Brooklyn! Thanks to francisweizen for this bottle!","hyuga","Aug 23, 2003"

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Give me a gulp light golden color, almost fruity, grainy aromatics. Taste is very redolent of rye? A touch of fruity bread-dough mid-palate. The beer finishes mildly tangy, with a pleasant dose of hops and a kiss of sweet (again) rye flavor. A nice choice for pizza or perhaps a corned beef on RYE!? I wish we could get this in Chicago-it would be a hit. Thank you Bundy Brown for the sample bottle!!","moulefrite","Jul 06, 2003"
3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I think the odd funkiness of pilsners is an aquired taste that I haven't quite aquired; I'd rather reach for a well-hopped IPA or a hefe.. but this is definitely drinkable, and the lack of skunk is a big plus.","shirfan","Jun 14, 2003"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Best Before August of 2002, well so far this beer has held up the best of my sampler that includes the lager Pennant pale ale. So it pours an impressive crystal clear bright golden tone with high bubbly carbonation and a foaming white two finger sized head. The aroma contains some delicate floral hops and some Saaz some where up in there alon with a nice sweetness. The flavor is also sweet with a nice spicy kick of hops going on, wonderfully balanced and I can't believe this beer is still this good. If it didn't have a best before date this one would be fresh by my palate no off flavors at all. Well constructed resiliant lighter bodied beer with plenty of flavor to make this a classic representation of the style. Very drinkable just had a sub with one a little earlier very good food beer ex. pizza and beer.","WVbeergeek","May 09, 2003"

The body is light, it's flavor is good, crisp toasty malt but only light, floral hops in the flavor and traditional dry, crisp finish. A decent summer quencher but could use a little more hop and malt flavor for my taste.","jeffboo","May 09, 2003"

3.6,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Well, this bottle must be one-off 'cause it definitely ain't straw, or clear, or gold. It is a hazy light amber with a one finger high off-white head and a little loose lacing. The nose is malt and the taste is, well, light and delightfully full of malt and an ending hop bitterness; slight notes of apricot in the warmed brew. Steady streams of small bubbles. Quite crisp and light bodied - typical of the style. But the look is not a typical clear, golden pilsener; no way, no how. Significant filmy bottom sediment.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 29, 2003"
3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The Brooklyn Pilsner poured a very clear and bright golden color. A nice foamy head appeared and was fairly well-maintained throughout. Some loose lacing on the glass, as well. A nice malty scent was somewhat overshadowed by floral overtones. Very intriguing smell. The taste was very crisp and refreshing, a good balance of hops and malt, with a nice bitter bite near the end. A faint sample of lemon or citrus characteristic was also perceived. The light body could have been somewhat heavier, but was still very appropriate and fitting for the style, and made for a nice mouthfeel. This pilsner was a great thirst quencher; very crisp and inviting, simple yet well-balanced and refined. Definitely a good session drink or one to kick back with after a long day.","SchmichaelJ","Apr 17, 2003"
3.41,-6.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Had a light floral nose, a little sweet and almost fruity. A very clean smell. Taste was of a light malt body with a crisp, quick, and clean bitterness. Slight buttery taste and finish, too. Had a fairly quick and dry finish, though it brought on the worst part: no other finishing flavor besides a bitterness that lingered. Didn't taste all too pleasant, especially the lurking lemon flavor thats a little too soapy for me, and the ill-tasting cloy it leaves.","nomad","Apr 13, 2003"

The aroma is limited but offers some light floral hops and a clean, softly sweet maltiness. The body is light with a fine, gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth in the mouth. The flavor is well balanced with a lightly sweet & grainy malt against a grassy and lightly spicy hop flavor. The bitterness is restrained but backs up the malt that's there. It finishes fairly dry with just a minor lingering malt and some residual hop flavor. A pretty mainstream pilsner that exhibits some of the F.X. Matt house character. Somewhat dissapointing compared to the other beers in their bottle line-up.","NeroFiddled","Oct 18, 2002"

Good mouth feel, and good finish, again with the slight hops, sweet though. Good color, yellow, gold. Little head, but it stays through most of the glass. A little more body and a little more hop finish would make a world of difference. Would I have another one? If I ran out of Victory Pils, yeah, I guess so.","HopheadEd","Sep 22, 2002"
3.68,0.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear golden color with a thick pillowy white head that sticks around nicely and leaves a great lace all the way down the glass.  The smell is pleasantly hoppy with a spicy edge to it, but it also has a nice bit of sweetness in the background.  The first thing to hit the tongue is the sweetness of the adjuncts which is immediately followed by the spiciness of the hops.  The nice hoppy flavor fades towards the end however, first giving way to the seetness of the brew and then to a slightly metallic taste that finishes the brew.  The metallic quality definitely detracts from the brew and the strange finish makes the brew less refreshing and crisp than would be appropriate.  The brew still remains rather drinkable and would fit in nicely after a hot summer day of working in the yard.","Murph","Sep 13, 2002"

This is a solid, delectable pilsner that is not only refreshing but excellent at stimulating the appetite. Marries well with practically any food, pilsners being among the most versatile beer. Light golden color, frothy head that subsides, gentle hoppy aroma that manages to be both musky and clean. Excellent malts, light but substantial, and the hops bring it all home. I wish they sold this at the ball park. Hell, I wish they sold this at my local bar. Brooklyn is one of the country's top breweries and this beer is probably the best pilsner brewed in the U.S. -- strong words, but prove me wrong.
