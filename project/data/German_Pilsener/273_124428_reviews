"This is easy drinking so if you're into Pils this is a decent option. Nothing I'd leave the house to acquire, but totally preferable to the Budweisers of the world."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I did rather enjoy this pils. It's not a brew I'd actively seek out nor one that is worthy of a world class rating, but decent and worth a shot. I'd take this over a Budweiser anytime."

"O:  Really good Pilsener, Sweetwater has created a great beer that fits this style well."

"Ok beer for what it is"

"Pours a clear deep straw producing 3 fingers of frothy, white, somewhat lasting head that leaves a nice coating of clumpy, webby lace. Aroma is cracker & biscuit malts, floral, earthy, grass & lemon hops. Taste is clean & slightly dry, biscuit & grain malt, floral, grass, lemon hops balanced with just the right amount of pepper & bitter. Finish & aftertaste malty & nicely bitter balanced. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, smooth,  dry, mildly oily with a moderate prickle."

"3.18/5: These pils aren't doing a whole lot"
"Hoppy like a Czech-style pils.  Nothing spectacular here, but drinkable."
""

"Take Two pours a hazy yellow color with a small white fizzy head. It smells very citrusy and floral with a slight undertone of grains. The grains are more pronounced in the flavor but are balanced nicely by the citrus and floral hops."
""
""
"Still can't find a Sweetwater beer that doesn't taste like lake water."
""
"O: ok for the style but not incredible"
""
"I could not drink this beer."
"Really did not enjoy this beer.  I actually poured it out.  I NEVER pour a beer out.  I just could not drink it.  Gross! LOL"

"The body is light but almost fuller than expected with a firm crispness and a smoothness that keeps up almost to the end.  Graininess takes away from the cleaner aspects, but not exceedingly."

"Has a strange flavor to it.  Not on board."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and malts. Taste is grassy, malts, hops are present, bitter at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

"Overall, pretty easy drinking, if you like the type of hop used.  I prefer a bit of a heavier body more of a malt focus.  This is pretty distinctive for a pils, a bit malt light though."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Sweetwater Taphouse in the Atlanta airport. Pours golden yellow as expected, a bit of haze and darker than other in the style, with a super creamy half finger head on top. Aroma of plastic and dusty, dry hops, not much pils malt influence on the aroma. Meh. Flavor is dirty malts, unpleasant adjunct lager flavors, light generic hop bite, some hay. Light bodied with high carbonation. Yeah, this isn't very good, even for the style I don't get very excited about in the first place."

""
""
"Appears filtered golden colored body with a bright white head fine speckled lacing.  Aroma crisp hop notes including citrus, dank qualities, and herbal fresh cut grass light biscuit malt base.  Flavor is bitter and brash but is balanced by the delicate two row and pilsener malts, punch of dank herbal grassy hops really does well in this beer.  Mouthfeel finishes bone dry easy drinkability what more can one ask for in an accessible craft beer pils?"
""
"Overall- Not bad, but I would rate this pretty average."

"Slightly hazy straw colored body with a small, quickly disappearing head. Aroma is a nice, fresh blend of spicy, grassy hops, sweet, bready grain, and lager cleanliness.  Flavor is more rough and raw.  Grassy bitterness, spicy hops...much less malty balance, which is too bad.  Pretty crisp, light enough body.  Too rustic and bitter for my Pilsener tastes, but drinkable."

"a liitle too metallic for my tastes, but im going to give this another shot sometime based purely on reputation"

"O: Sweetwater has a good pils here. Not the best but better than most new ones I've tried lately. I would buy this again."
""
""
""
"O: The pilsner style isn't the most complex one, but Sweetwater makes the most of it with this beer. Light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if it was a production error or what. I tried one bottle poured into a glass, it was very rusty and metallic in flavor."

"soft floral hops and malt come through on the nose."
"Easy drinker. Ok alcohol taste."

"This is a pretty good take on a German Pilsner.  the noble hops are spicy and prevalent.This is an easy drinker for sure. The pilsner malt used is crisp and refreshing, sweet and smooth.  the hops are biting and sharp but don't overtake what the beer is trying to be.a good Pilsner that I wish I had found earlier in the summer."

"I hope they don't take 3 because this is a borderline drain pour."

"O: One of my favorite offerings from Sweetwater and a nice Pils for the summer - easy to drink, crisp, and refreshing. Very enjoyable and one I would get again."
""

""
""
"O - Well, Sweetwater is trying to nail a lager, and they do. Much better than any macro Lager, easy to drink and enjoyable."
""
"Overall I think it's great drinking an American pilsner and not having to wallow in corn, rice and mediocrity. I'm glad Sweetwater included this in their summer variety 12-packs."

"Remarks: not my favorite style, but it came in a ""Tackle Box"" from Sweetwater."

"Pours into a pilsner a pale light golden with a thinner bone white head atop with good carbonation.Toasted bready notes in the nose with some lingering leafy hops,pretty delicate aromas.The palate is great for the style with pizza crust and mild sweetness with quite a smack of herbal hops that are pretty assertive and lingering.I like the hops on the palate and it goes down pretty easy,a good 4th of July warm weather beer."

"O: A very nice refreshing Pilsner. Well done."

"3.93/5.00"

"Clear, pale golden, textbook Pilsner body, with lots of gentle streamers. The smell was grainy, grassy, and clean, with just a touch of canned corn. The hops were definitely abundant here, and were the first thing I noticed. They provided a spicy start, and then they turned floral, and herbal. There was a creamy finish with still lingering hops and a hint of caramel. The body was soft and silky, and the beer was easy to drink. Nicely done."

"O - It's a text book Pils and a much better rendition than Road Trip IMO. Well done Sweetwater."
