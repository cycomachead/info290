"Very plane and simple, but slaughered by the reast of the German field."
"Just a ordinary pale lager. Nothing special"

"Keg of veltins pilsner drank"

"Buy unfortunately the taste is kind of foul."
"A textbook pilsner, with average noble hop taste, significant carbonation. Crisp, drinkable and refreshing. Not going to blow you away by any means but sticks true to its’ style."
"O: very easy to drink;"

"I'll be synthetic: this is like drinking a daisy."

"I really this- a solid, affordable German import. A thinner-bodied Urquell, almost."

"This makes me want to go out and find a Jever to compare it with. I think this has a slightly more mineralish flavor than that brand (my favorite authentic pils), but is fairly similar. For $1.29 a bottle, I’d definitely have this again."

"A delicious pilsner with a classic balance between hops, malt and yeast. If you are a fan of exceptionally hoppy beer, then this may seem to fall short but I think this is a perfect example of why German beers in many ways still set the standard. The hops are bitter but not over-the-top aromatic and provide a fine counter-balance to its essentially malty character. An excellent value at $11.00 per 12 at Binny's in Chicago."

"O - I can't think of a lager beer that tops this one, it goes great with fries and schnitzel or pizza and even spaghetti's with red sauce. Plus it leaves no hangover when you drink a few more of this beer which is brewed according to the strict German purity laws. If you like lagers, Veltins is a must try!"
""
"O -- A decent Pils overall, something to quaff without thinking, but still won't take the place of a Trumer or EKU Pils."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but nothing really stands out in the taste when it is compared to the top beers in the style."
""
"Above average German Pilsner, a bit more malty and flavorful."
""
"Won ""Best Pilsner"" at the 2007 World Beer Awards. I love the Dortmunder style German beers. My family home town of Hagen is in that region. I have noticed that there is a consistent lack of appreciation for German lagers. These styles of beer are among the world's favorites. The balance achieved is nearly perfect for my tastes."

"Overall it would be interesting to see if this was any better than the other industrial euro lagers. It doesn't speak much for the German brewing tradition except for being clean and inoffensive. On tap at the Kaiserhof in San Diego."
""
"Overall a decent every day german pilsner"
"C+"
"O: Goes down easy, somewhat tasty, not filling, mild kick, this was perfect for a hot summer night. Not sure I would enjoy this as much any other time of year, but it is definitely a great for a summer night."

"So-so. Above average for most lagers, but only middling when compared to other German pilseners. A hint of noble hops and a more obvious bitterness, but otherwise this doesn't stray far from the standard lager template. No need to seek it out."
"Bit of a skunky smelll to start which quickly blows off this looked reasonably pleasant. Typically medium yellow for the style this kept some wispy head throughout but showed minimal beading and lacing. A bit hollowy thin all and all and just overly dominated by a carbonic edge which creates an atypically unpleseant bitter edge. A bit too malty for my taste and there isn't much harmony in the integreation of these two elements."
""
"Pours a nice clear amber with a decent white head - typical, but still appealing. Well, it is a pilsner. Strong aroma has a malty core and a robust fruity overtone, pear and apple with a touch of banana. Flavor is crisp and malty with a bitter hoppy undertone and a bit of fruity sweetness. Body is a bit thicker than I expect with this sort of beer, and is quite fizzy. I’m not a pilsner fan, preferring dark beers such as stouts, but I will give any good beer a try regardless of variety."
"O: although very bitter, and unlike any pilsener I've personally tried, it's enjoyable and very classically German!"
"Overall quite average."
""

"“Yes” pilsner but could be better to add more carbonation to bring more refreshing touch to palate."

"Drinkable, as industrial beer."

"4.5 because it is nostalgic - love drinking this out on the wandernweg in Sauerland. The appearance is light and clean. Taste is not overpowering and finishes clean. Mouthfeel is a little thin (watery), but is very refreshing in summer. Great water source that makes this Pilsner taste so fresh."
"What I like about this beer is that it is always reliable and I know I can go back to it when I just want a fresh, cold beer and not worry about taking tasting notes. It doesn't produce the excitement of craft beer and it's not innovative in any way - it's just a fine and mature product. For what it's worth, it does the job perfectly for me."
"Overall: Not too sweet, not full bodied, but easy to drink"
"A very standard pilsener IMHO."
"O: Very easy to drink, very tasty. This is how I like my pils!"
"Herbal, earthy and grassy noble hop flavors hit the tongue first, followed by a touch of sweet, bready pils malt. It dries up quickly in the finish, ending with a bitter herbal and mineral bite. Very light and dry; punchy but refreshing."
"Pours a pale yellor with light head. Aroma is sweet malts and a little floral scent. Taste is sweet with herbal flavors and a light hop bitterness in the finishing. Aftertaste is typical German pilsner with a heavy sweetness and light herbal hops. Pretty much your average, run of the mill Pilsner."
"NOTE: a second tasting of this a couple weeks later, and there were metallic notes in the aroma and taste, interfering with positive qualities."
"The body was good, a bit fuller than is typical for the style, which I enjoyed. Drinkability was good, I could have a couple of these. Overall, a decent version of the style, worth trying if you see it."
"For a cheaper pilsener, Veltins is good. I respect that they do not use hop extract. The use of real hops adds a lot to this beer, which exceeded my expectations."
"D: Good"
"Veltins Brauerei--Grevenstein, Germany--Veltins Pilsener. 4.80% ABV. 30 IBU's? (2.5 / 5.0) Thin mild lace white head. Clear thin bright yellow color. Bavarian stank hint noble hop front. Thin crisp dry Pils body fades to weak mild end. Bland but easy smooth & crisp. 5 oz Taste @ Fremont Oktoberfest 9/24/2010."
"One of my favorite pilsner beers for sure, highly recommend!"
"D: Nice German Pilsener."
"I was in Paderborn Germany for a few days and, of course, was very excited about trying as many new Pilsners as I could. My hotel had Veltins, which were available in many sizes including a full liter. The beer was kinda light on flavor and color. Aroma was pretty good. Not a bad beer but not outstanding."
"The is some bitterness and dryness in this beer which makes it an average German beer, siply not spectacular."
"Overall: Maybe intended for a light beer drinking market (such as Greece). An Average pils with nothing too special, but also nothing really bad about it either."
"It's not as bitter as I expected from the nose, there are some toasty malts, and it finishes dry. It's not memorable though, just sort of passes through as a thirst-quencher but not much else. It felt like it got metallic as I went through the glass, too. Not bad, but probably not something I'd buy again."
"It brought back happy times and the days of my courting while in germany back in the 70's, glad I stumbled across it again (I have two old Veltins glasses that I use to review lagers and pilsners in)."
"D: A nice pilsener, wil surely drink this again. My favorite of this year's holiday after the Mythos Red."
"Sharp hop on the tongue upfront combined with a bit of carbonation in the mix. Mouthfeel is hoppy, not complex, yet nicely balanced and dry. Finishes tart and slightly bitter making this pretty good for the type. A good and fairly common pilsner that is worth trying."
"Drinkability: Not much goin' here. Just a pretty simple, slightly skunked/off pilsner, not unenjoyable, but not one to have again. Give me a Prima Pils any day."
"Not a lot to it, but reccomended."
"D - About as drinkable as cold water. And about as flavourful."
"It was kind of noisy and dim when I tried this beer, so I was a little distracted. It's an easy drinking pils."
"Pours a pale yellow, huge long lasting head and lots of lacing. Aroma of continental malt and a small faint hint of charred wood. Flavor of german pils and a firm hop presence as much flavor as blunt bitterness. Quite a well crafted and refreshing pils, don't let the boring looking can turn you off this lager!"
"D: Very drinkable. Well-balanced malts and hops. Can drink more than a couple...and did."
"Light yellow in color. Head disappears quickly, but leaves nice lace. Smells light and grainy, slightly sweet. Lots of hops, a little too much carbonation. It's thin and light, but not watery. There's a definite note of malt/sweet dextrins that become more apparent if you let it warm up a little. It finishes with a slight peppery tingle in the throat. Not a particularly complex brew, but I suppose that's expected for a lager."
"D: A really enjoyable German pilsner which went well with my cheese pizza. Easy to drink with a distinctive dextrin sweetness playing off of a woody hops gives it a unique slot in the German pilsner style."
"M&D: semi-clean, moderate in carbonation, medium-bodied for the mild flavour profile... All in all, not a bad pilsener, but not something I'd go for a second pint. I have tried it on tap as well (@ The Rake nr. the Borough Market, London), which was superior to this bottled version."
"Having this beer in Sibiu, Romania. It's interesting given that I just read my last review which is just before this one. the body is good, but sweeter than a good pils; ditto the flavor, body, and finish. So, the bottom line is slightly different, but neither better nor worse; just slightly different."
"Very nice. If these where on tap locally I could pound them all day on a nice sunny patio."
"Notes: I suspect this is better on tap than the green-bottled version we get in the US, but if I could get it to taste like this in the bottles, this would make a decent summer pilsner. A good start to the evening on a hot summer day."
"(I'd still take a Victory Prima Pils over this and other Pilsners)"
"d: i was incredibly impressed with this pilsener. it is still entirely pilsener flavors just more complex and more of them; not to mention 4.8 abv ain't bad; definitely worth a try and maybe a good way to convert your dingus friend who only drinks macro lagers"
"Slight citrus tones in the hops, and a good, sweet, baked bread malt. Crisp hop profile in the flavour, good malts to balance it out. Nice and clean carbonation, a good summer beer."
"Had this with dinner as a pre-tasting session with the one and only BA BlackHaddock. Poured your typical golden lager color into his .2L Veltins glass. Lovely frothy white head which is to be expected of a German lager. The taste perfectly mirrors the smell: malts, plain and simple. Taste is malty with subtle floral hints. Bottom line is that this is a better than average German lager, and one of the best ones I've had out of a bottle. Well worth a try if you fancy yourself a lager lover."
"D: I quite like this pilsener - its's increadibly easy to drink and is very refreshing. Nice flavour and nice presentation as well. I will certainly be buying this beer again."
"An okay pilsener, which would probably have far more justice done to it if it were more fresh and not so close to the best before date."
"This was a pretty drinkable brew. Nothing to put in the beer hall of fame, but enjoyable and pretty typical in style for a Pils. Worth checking out if you come across it."
"d) Very enjoyable"
"D- almost got a 5 up in this piece but pilseners aren't my forte, and i think i need some more experience before i hand em out."
"T & M : Très mince en bouche, séche et fuyante, le houblon s'affirme pleinement. L'amertume, dominée par le houblon, dure longtemps."
"This beer is an easy drinking one with a fresh crisp feel taste that could be drunk anytime and easily consumable for quite a few on a hot summer day.Worth a try,i enjoyed this one."
"Overall a good middle of the pack pils."
"D - This is much more drinkable than others of it's ilk due to the more balanced and malty-sweet flavors that don't have the aggressive peppery notes of some Czech and German pils."
"A refreshing and pleasant pilsner. Worth trying if you like the style."
"D: Veltins is actually a very drinkable pilsener. Perhaps not the best in each category, I'd say, but certainly nothing to shake a stick at. An above average offering that would suit fans of this style, or lagers in general."
"Overall - An OK Pils... a few too many macro hints to be better than average... worth a try maybe once.."
"Picked up a bottle at Finger Lakes Beverage Center in Ithaca. I was ecited to try a new pilsner, but this turned out to be a little more of a Euro pale lager than anything else. It was pretty bland with a bready flavor and aroma and a touch (not enough) of grassy hops. It could be worse, but it's not really worth trying."
"Overall: Veltins is an elegant round beer. I would recommend it for anyone who would like to taste a nice example of a German Pilsner."
"Overall, dull, but oh so drinkable. Very nice but can you believe that Opus charged me $5.50 for a 10 oz poor of this?"
"Drinkability: A refreshing, easy drinking pilsner that is good on a warm day"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden color with a slight orange tinge and a pillowy off-white head. Smell is primarily sweet with malt, slightly spiced. Taste is similar to the nose, although the hops are well balanced with the malt, there could be more. There is also a slight metallic taste that ruins the experience. The mouthfeel is very light and has a velvety consistency. This beer is pretty decent even with the nasty metallic taste, I would be interested to try a fresher bottle. Pretty drinkable given the good balance of hops and malt, as well as the light body."
"Poured out a golden yellow color, thin filmy white head. NOse had a strong pilsner malty note, with some spicy hops backing it up. The taste was a bit heavy, but pleanest. Bready, tiny bit of hops, very full flavored and refreshing. Has a medium carbonaiton mouthfeel, appropriate for the style. Finishes smooth and refreshing with a slightly bitter bite at the end."
"Quite nice! There's just enough here to keep it on the dinner table, yet it would also serve extremely well at a sporting event during the summer. Flavorful and refreshing!"
"Taste was bitter with malty backbone, with the prickly sensation of the carbonation. Also some breadiness and a dry finish. To me a very good pilsener, too bad for the smell, but taste was as good as it gets, it could be a little more hoppy, but that's it."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very slick light mouthfeel. The beer is well carbonated. This beer is very easy to drink. The beer goes well with food. I had this with burritos."
"On tap at the Cock & Bull in Covington, Ky. Appropriate medium straw color. Not quite crisp, but still pleasantly sharp malt profile. Hopping was nondescript, but adequate. Some hard-water mineral notes. Finish was clean, with a lingering, slightly acidic hop bite."
"Smooth and creamy in the mouth, but light in body. An easy drinker and a good, solid Pils...cheers!"
"Nothing too special here, just a solid pilsner with no real weaknesses and no special strengths."
"Pours a fizzy golden yellow color with very little head, yet it does leave nice lacings. The smell is crisp and hoppy. It tastes well-hopped. One of the better tasting german pilseners I've had. I'm really surprised this beer is rated so low... I'm actually quiet impressed. The mouthfeel is adequate for the style, and the drinkability has got to be great because I'm sucking these ones down in a hurry. Cheers!"
"Nice light beer...even though it's not a light beer"
"All in all, a very serviceable German Pils that I'd enjoy on those hot summer days."
"11.2 ounce brown bottle (new packaging?) w/o any freshness dating. Pours prety clear light straw, white head, showing some retention, scattered lacing, nose is mildly earthy. This is a fairly light bodied, crisp pilsner. Light notes of honey and grainy hops in the finish. not a bad little summer quaffer/quencher."
"Part of the ""Summer Brews"" pack from Cost Plus World Market. Bottle says 5.1% abv. Label shows this being about a month past the sell by date, so buyer beware. Poured a light gold with the big fluffy white head you would expect from a good pils. Lots and lots of lacing, too. The taste is focused squarely on the herbal hops, with a dry finish. Thankfully none of the skunkiness I have experienced from other popular pilsners. A good beer to pair with hearty food, but not necessarily something I would want to drink a bunch of. Still, a perfectly good pilsner."
"Yet another euro pils in da can. This is ok but really a shadow of Konig or Topvar. Not enough body and hops and not much of a finish. Drinkable , yes in the way that Becks is better than Canadian. Seems there is too many German lagers in a can available and not enough duppelbocks and vienna lagers ."
"The beer poured a pale yellow color with a finger and a half of head composed of rather large bubbles that fell to slightly ring the top ofthe glass. The nose was slightly grainey and touched with a hint of noble hop. I would like a little more gusto flavor-wise. The flavor was much the same. A big dose of graineyness hovering over a very light bed of spicey noble hop. The feel was light and bubbly. Very refreshing on a summer night on the patio of our local watering hole. Drinkability was not all that bad. It was easily consumed and quenced my thirst after not having beer for a few days of being sick. Overall, average, but refreshing."
"A decent German Pilsner. Poured out to a nice golden yellow color with a good head, typical of a well crafted German brew. Odors of rice and bread were noted. Taste was a bit one sided, reminding me of a light lager. Flavors of hops and grain were most present, as was a touch of a lemon like quality on the finish. Overall, quite refreshing and crisp. Worth a try."
"Impression: Glad it was served in a nice glass. A good transition for your yellow-beer-drinking-buddies."
"The case of the six pack I bought says ""The Best German Pilsner!"". I figured it probably wasn't true, but it still might be good so I bought it.Pours a clear straw color with a small creamy white head. It is more pale than other pilsners I've had. Sweet smell with underlying bitter hop aromas. The sip tastes sweet, with a nice bitterness at the end. The aftertaste is sweet and sicky. Not as crisp as I would like a pilsner to be, but well balanced for what it is. The mouthfeel is light with nice carbonation. Overall, it is not the best German pilsner I've had, but it isn't bad either. It is good enough that I want to drink the other five bottles, instead of pawning them off on less beer educated friends who would just get drunk with it. On the other hand, I will not buy it again."
"This is okay beer I guess. It doesn't change my mind about the 5% rule (which I just made up) that says that 5% of European lagers are actually good. Veltins is in the other 95%, but it really isn't too bad in the final reckoning. It is ultimately forgettable though."
"Pours a hazy golden-straw color with a good creamy white head that doesn't last very long with some lacing, grassy and flowery aromas. Bready, cracker like flavors with a mild sweetness that turns hoppy and bitter with some dryness in the finish. Medium bodied with a soft but kind of watery mouthfeel, a decent pils."
"I'm not usually pulled in by fancy bottles, but this one was sharp dressed. Thick, dense, pale cream colored head fades slowly leaving a few random strings of lace. Pale malt, crisp citrus, and spicy hops in the aroma. Transparent, brilliant golden beer with a few medium sized bubbles rising briskly from the bottom of the tall slender pilsner glass. Lightly sweet pale malt mixed with a solid dose of spicy and floral hop flavors. The flavors are crisp and there's just a slight grainy flavor that's barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is on the light side, but thicker then expected. This is a pretty solid beer. The flavor is light, but there's enough hops in their to keep it enjoyable. At $12 a 12pack it would make a good gateway beer."
"Overall: A strange Pilsener, light character, light bodied, rather lite overall, but not that bad. The funky nose is something else though.."
"A nice golden pilsener with a very nice white head that leaves a ton of lace around my glass. It has a nice grassy, sweet aroma with just a touch of hops, pretty much a standard German Pils aroma. The flavor is crisp and has a malty sweetness that is pretty well hidden behind a generous hopping. The nice hoppy finish of this beer makes it stand out when compared to other macro German Pilseners. I definitely will be revisiting this beer in the future."
"Pours to a white foam head and pale yellow-gold color. Good carbonation, good bit of head retention and lacing. Aroma is grainy and spicy-hoppy. Flavor is nice and dry but has a weak wateriness to it. Hop bitterness is on the low side for the style. Finishes dry, grainy and spicy. Not too bad. It reminds me of the Czech style of pils than German."
"This one pours a clear yellow color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little grainy, but there's nothing much there. A slight skunkiness. It has a metallic taste. Slightly bitter and a small bit of malt is found, but there's not much to this beer. I really didn't enjoy this one as it came across to me as the typical Euro lager."
"Drinkability  This isnt a classic by any stretch of the imagination but is rather inexpensive and worth a look."
"A light sweetness appears at around the halfway point, but I feel the brew lacks the mildly sweet malty and herbal character one normally expects from the style. Nice, should try beer!"
"Classic Bavarian styling from start to finish."
"I ordered this one online cuz I had never seen it in a store. It reminds me of Radeburger -a simple straight forward German pilsener. Fairly poor head retention. Standard German nose (ie. Spaten, Warsteiner) mild with a hint of malty bitterness. Taste is also fairly straight-forward with a bit of a bite on the finish (like Pilsner Urquel). It is safe to say, I don't think too highly of these other beers I have compared to the Veltins. These are the Bud, Millers, Coors of Germany/ Czech Rep. Mostly 3.5s here though cuz it is better than average but nothing exceptional-- I wish USAs macros were this decent !!!"
"Pours a yellowish gold color with one finger of head. Not much lacing. The smell is classic pilsener, with a malty background and some grassy aromas. The taste is light, a little sweet. Balanced malt and hops. The body is very light, but the drinkability is pretty good. Not too shabby."
"Appearance: Yellow golden body with a nice sized frothy white head leaves nice lacing down my glass. Aroma: Mild sweetness clean grassy hop profile not bad at all, clean with some hops. Taste: Upfront hop bitterness crisp german pils a bit one dimensional and boring at times but I like the hop bitterness that comes through the flavors are of grassy herbal hops. The sweetness is balancing but very nice slightly bready. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied meant for the summer season carbonation was a bit much, other than that nothing special. Drinkability: A nice German pils that is decently flavorful and refreshing."
"Front flavor is bright and crisp with hops and spicy flavor that leads a honey malt into the wayward valley of finish."
"Served on tap at Eli Cannon's. Arrived in my pint glass a pale and just slightly hazy maize yellow, with a moderate layer of foamy white head. Aroma is surprisingly floral hoppy, just a bit sweet and malty. Flavor is refreshing and crisp, there's more to this pilsener than I expected, and none of the skunkiness that others have noted. Taste is bitter and hoppy at first, hint of lemon in there, then easing into a nice simple sweet malt flavor. Hops come back for a clean fresh finish. Body is light and mouthfeel is very smooth. I could drink this all day it's so drinkable. Not sure how the bottled version would be, but damn tasty on tap. Seems like a perfect summer beer, plenty of flavor, not too heavy or alcoholic, goes down easy."
"Pours a standard clear gold under a two finger white head with good body, decent staying power and some lacing. The nose is slightly skunked at initial pour, then morphing into pine and barley notes. The mouth is light and prickly. The taste is classic German pils - lots of crisp bordering on harsh hoppy bitterness above a mild malty backbone. The aftertaste is strongly bitter, inviting the next taste. It's much better on tap in Germany, but still a very drinkable beer."
"Zum wohl!"
"This fine pilsner is crystal clear with a flowery aroma; it is not as hoppy as some other beers in the style. This beer starts with a slight sweetness reminiscent of honeysuckles and ends with a dry balanced finish that seems to last for some time. It is above average, but is not something that I would give a second thought."
" About what youd/I'd expect from a German Pilsner."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has that typical pale malt and yeast smell that so many of these type beers have. It is not as skunky as some I've tried. The taste is awful. It is grainy and bitter. It doesn't smell skunky, but it sure as hell tastes skunky. The mouthfeel is decent. This is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. Over all this is a terrible beer. It looks good, smells good, and has good mouthfeel, but it tastes awful. It's one and done for me."
"At first impression the beer looks very thin and watery. But, after one notes its massive head retention and lace the contrary becomes apparent. Taste is mild with a mildly sharp hop bitterness that lingers well after the beer is gone. Fairly drinkable but somewhat boring."
"A rep broght me a sample of this the other day claiming all sorts of wonderful things about this beer and how it was huge in Germany etc etc.. I wonder if he had ever tasted this beer? It poured a medium yellow straw colour with a decent head that didnt last too long. The smell was crisp and a bit hoppy with a weird sort of metallic tone and a touch of le skunk. The taste was underwhelming.. Hoppy in that German Pilsner way, yet it left a long odd aftertaste. It reminded me way too much of St. Paulis Girl and Becks. Not the worst beer i had ever had, but not at all worth the hype and definately not one i would shell out 7.50 a six pack for."
"Medium body and light carbonation...finishes short which is its downfall."
"The smell is lightly sweet with a nice hops presence. The taste is nothing fancy, very simple and light on the palate. Lagers typically aren't my style of choice, but this is a smooth, easy drinking beer that I picked up on a whim. I'm happy with it."
"Label proclaims this as a ""German Pilsner Beer", but it's a pilsner like Miller Lite's a ""true pilsner beer"". Clear dull yellow color, moderate white head. Aroma: dry, vegetal, flat, hints of corn, flinty, and overall off-putting to this nose. Absolutely no body, texture, nil, nothing, nada. Not a single bit of taste to be accounted for. It passes through you, without a trace of it having been on your tongue at all."
"A nearly infinite bitter hop finish sets this Pils apart. Golden straw under a clingy lace. Aroma of dry crackers and lemon pith. Crisp and refreshing. An awesome hot weather brew. I could see myself pounding a few of these, lakeside, sprawled out on aromatic pine needles with a fishing line tied to my big toe. A bitter and enjoyable beer."
"More or less a typical Pils as far as I am concerned. Not really bad but nothing really stood out either. Golden color with some carbonation evident. Hops and spice in the aroma. Crisp and dry with a somewhat bitter aftertaste. I guess it wasn't too bad for the style."
"Clear gold, good dense white head of 1/4 of an inch.  Light sweet aromas, similar to many Pilsners.  Malt is pleasant and nutty, straying toward papery but not too off-putting.  Hops are acidic in quality and have a slight tobacco sense, as well.  This brew has a definite flavor profile along with its crsipness.  Nothing incredible but I liked its impression well enough."
"Notes: A nice brew to suck back with some food, but nothing fancy. Went quite well with my Kesselgoulasch."
"Bright clear straw color with a thickish white head.  Head retention was better than expected.  A sweet fruity flavor with a hint of citrus.  Moderate carbonation, I found it as drinkable."
"Pretty nice, easy drinking pils. Dryish flavour, with a slightly herby dry hop finish, not big on body, and not big on complexity, but very nice drinking, a slightly better than average German Pils."
"A light pilsener without much outside the ordinary."
