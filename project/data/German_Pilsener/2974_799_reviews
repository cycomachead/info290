"Decent pilsner. Could do worse. Snow globe type carbonation. Has that typical German hop, pale malt scent. Not too much variations in these German pilsners. But they are consistent with taste and feel. Which is good. Nice head that holds up well. Nothing to brag about here. Good beer to drink on a hot day. Not much to knock except how forgettable it is. Not something i would pursue again. 11.2 oz is lame and hurts sales here in my opinion. Would drink again knowing its better than those American macro lagers. The price point on the beer is too high also considering the alternatives. Overall good. Cheers!"

"An excellent pilsner.  One of the best.  Not to be underestimated.  Smooth, clean flavor, with a nice rich malt backbone and bright finish.  It is really good beer.  Never disappoints."

"Overall: A mildly hoppy beer. Good introduction to pilsners. With its history, I conclude that this is how pilsners must've tasted."

"Mouthfeel is solid."
"I'm usually very critical with my reviews, but this one was a pleasant surprise. I purchased a can from the LCBO. Pours a beautiful amber, with very little head that doesn't stay long. Smells slightly musky and spicy with a grassy overtone.  Initial mouthfeel is very pleasant: beautiful carbonation, taste that is expansive but stops just short of full bodied. The hops character is well balanced.  A very nice lingering aftertaste and refreshing and satisfying overall.  For $2.45 CAD a can, this is a very light and refreshing brew. Definitely not the best German style Pilsner around, but it is authentic enough and quite good. The irony is that I lived in Germany for many years and never had a chance to taste this particular beer :-)"

"I am no Pilsner fan, but this one was just aweful."
"Overall: this certainly ain't a good pilsener. Awkward aroma and flavour with a bittering aftertaste that is vinegary instead of hop-driven. I'll leave this one alone, even for AU$43 a case."

"This is good valued German Pils!  It's readily available at my favorite liquor store, always fresh (a good seller obviously)and priced handsomely in 12 pack containers.  The lower price may fool you into thinking it's a cheap beer, but it's not.  Quality exudes with it's pure, golden color, thick white head, and generous lacing glass side.  It's flavor is a wonderful balance of dry/bitter hops, yet with a very faint hint of sweetness...It retains it's carbonation all the way to the end of your glass keeping things interesting.  This is an excellent session beer...4 or 5 go down very easily and the taste lingers on..."

"Pours a straw yellow, little to no head. I detect a slightly fruity smell, like a Granny Smith apple. Taste is spicy, bready, and has a hoppy and dry finish. Lively carbonation, crisp and refreshing. A fine pilsner. I have been buying this one for a while and it is usually found in my fridge."

"Nice pils!  Good looking golden beer with a big foamy head.  Good staying power on the head.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Nice subtle hoppiness.  Clean finish.  Very reasonably priced - a six was less than most craft brew sixes.  Great value.  I'll buy again for sure."

"This is plenty drinkable if you're looking for a light lager with a little bitter tang. But it's a below average Pilsner. From the 16 oz can purchased at Pioneer Market in La Conner, Wash. - 3.5  3.0  2.5  3.0  2.75"

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a above average example of a Pilsner, it had all the aspects that I look for in a German made Pilsner and it seemed to be just a nice and easy drinking, straight forward example of the style.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, fairly crisp, dry on the finish, not filling at all and the taste did a decent job of holding my attention, I could drink a few of these especially when it's hot outside.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's exactly what I expect from a German made Pilsner.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there's nothing that I disliked or would change about this beer.  I would buy this again when in the mood for the style and I recommend it to anybody that loves a good, easy drinking and traditional example of a Pilsner.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it delivered just what I wanted it to and I'm glad I took a chance on it.  This made for a nice first impression for this brewery and I would be interested in trying more of their beer and I think it's up there as one of the better German Pilsners I've had.  Good job guys, this was an enjoyable Pilsner, keep up the hard work."
""
"Overall this is a well done Pils, I have had better but this is a good representation of the style."
""
""
"I dig this beer.  It is an easy drinker that pairs well with grilled pork chops, burgers and of course sausages."
""

"Near medium body with medium carbonation."

""

"I like the beer...as I do many others. The point being there are a lot of beers in this world to chose from - and now Radeberger has decided to cut their bottle size from 12 oz to 11.2 oz in the name of profits. So it's time to move on to one of the many others available that are every bit as good if not better and still use 12 oz bottles."
"Grains, clean hops, mild sweetness are the terms i would use to describe this pilsener. And it is a pilsener. Nothing more. Nothing less. Stylewise - OK."
"07/2013 On tap. Way behind on this one. I've had it many times but not made any notes. At first blush it's tad bitter with a lingering finish. Refreshing but not too light. As a matter of fact it's definitely on the robust side. Old school money's worth of flavor."

"DATE REVIEWED: May 17, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ommegang footed... OCCASION: a day of home prep for Joey's 4th birthday party... APPEARANCE: clean, light golden body; white head reams unevenly... AROMA: yeasts produce a bubble gum aroma; soft floral hops also make this pilsner an intriguing encounter--improves the pervasive zinc/copper metal scents... PALATE: soft start, hard finish; medium-bodied but lingers at the throat; pretty similar pilsner profile... TASTE: slightly fruity, with pear and apple, tempered by a water hose-like hard water finish; adequate, but not to be distinguished or sought after...OVERALLL: wasn't sure where to place expectations--closer to Bitburger or Warsteiner; this beer carves out its own niche, a bit floral and yet with enough rough edges to add strength without disturbing the overall enjoyment of the beer...."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a pilsener glass. A moderate straw yellow color with an impressive thick white head collapsing inward from the middle, this lager has a nice sulfur and cereal grain nose, laced with herb and grass hops (including some light lavender, chamomile, and seed spice notes). Smells clean, brisk, and green with pronounced noble hopping. Palate is a fine synergy of pale malts (maybe a hint of sweetish corn) and minty green hops, along with subtle lemon, cashew, dried vegetable, licorice, hay, and sour grape, with a vegetal celery-like bitterness slowly building over time. Robust and flavorsome but no one element goes berserk on the palate. Moderate body for a German pilsener, with the carbonation restrained for the style and a dry, grassy, faintly nutty finish. A kindler, gentler pils (looking at you Krombacher) but nevetheless full of flavor and body. Fantastic."

"Overall - a very tasty and well made pilsner that is comfortble in its skin. A keeper."

"I am generally not a fan of pilsners, and this one is no exception. This beer is very thin and bright-ish yellow, with no head to speak of. And it tastes thin, and very flat, and bland. The lack of flavor only accentuates the flatness, and vice versa. I've had this beer before and disliked it then too. Will definitely avoid in the future."
"A bit thin on the mouthfeel, but still very crisp. The flavors aren't very exciting, but it's still clean drinking and good for the style."
""

"Found this one at a local beer pusher for $6.99 a sixer and figured it was worth a try... Generic look/color, average foam, good carbonation/mouthfeel... Crisp, clean flavor... Yeah, I could pound back a boat-load of these... While Nothing spectacular, there's also nothing offensive or heavy--a good drinking beer with friends. Worth a try. Cheers!"

"O: Overall, at $0.75 per bottle, this was an excellent deal. A refreshing pilsner with an excellent flavor palate and great mouth feel, I'd recommend this though it is not ground shaking, it's still good."

"The Brewery dates to the previous century in Radeberg near Dresden. The communists took over E. Germany but kept the brewery open. In fact, it was the favorite of the Dresden KGB chief Vladimir Putin. Interesting story. Thank goodness this brewery survived long enough to see the fall of the iron curtain. It is thriving now that it is free."

"Excellent beer, crisp, sharp, excellent taste, excellent aftertaste, well balanced bitterness, fresh, nicely colored and transparent with 'beer-ish' hue. One of the best beers. Was served in bottle, properly cooled and consumed late night among several others."

"The creator of the canquest, woodychandler, comes through with yet another canned beer. Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Lots of carbonation. Smell is a bit of malts, some sweetness. Taste is light and mild, some malts, thirst quenching but not overly flavorful. Feels light in the mouth and overall would make a good hot weather beer, but lacking a bit of punch."

"O- A really good pilsner. Tasty on a hot day."
""
"Poured from a 355 ml bottle. Pours a pale lemon yellow which belies its bold flavour. Nose is classic pilsner: crackery/grainy malt with with crisp grassy hops in the background. Taste is also well-balanced. A little sweetness up front with nutty/crackery malt notes and a decent dry, bitter finish. Ample carbonation offers a refreshing mouthfeel. Very solid."
""
""
""
""
"I got a good Crack followed by an inverted Glug, resulting in two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head that resembled the top of a soft-serve ice cream cone before it began to settle. Color was a bright sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a smell like field grain, light for a German Pils, and kind of cereal-like with no discernible hop presence. Mouthfeel was soft, light, very smooth. The taste had that same cereal-like quality that I noted on the nose, and maybe a light grassiness of hops. Finish was still cereal-like, prevalently, and the grassiness lingered lightly in the background after the finish. I feel like the style should be slightly sweeter and exhibit more Noble hops character, but YMMV."
""
""
""
""
"Good and easy to drink but with a funky offness at the finish."
""
""
"Overall - One of my favorite pilseners. I like most of them but this one always seemed just a bit better than many of the others in the style."

"Golden color with a two finger head with low retention. Traditional aroma of pale malt and a touch of grassy hops. Again, balanced flavor of sweet malt and grassy hops. Notes of pepper and lemon. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Light body with good carbonation. I was positively surprised with this beer. Good drinkability, flavorful, plain though assertive. Great German Pilsner option from a macro brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I can see how people could sit around and drink a beer like this all day. I would be very comfortable plopping a barrel of this on a table for a summer BBQ or pool party. Or any event where people should be drinking for a considerable amount of time."
""
""
""
"What a surprisingly good macro pilsner option out of Germany! I really enjoyed drinking this. Very simple, but gets to the point of what it's trying to be: gently flavored, well seasoned, refreshing, and super quaffable. I paired this with fish and chips and it worked well with me. Far more interesting than Warsteiner, Paulaner, and Spaten in the realm of macro pilsners. Why are people buying stuff like Beck's?? This is super affordable, crowd pleasing, and easy to drink, and a far better example of this style. Great stuff!"
"To the Point: just lacks character; as far as pilsners go – it’s only decent;"

"I was at the brewery on a tour from the Dresden Dampflok Treffen and after the brewery tour was given a tase. It is a very old beer brewery and produces a quality pilsner. I feel it too like most really good beers in Germany they have suffered from success and if they are producing enough beer to keep 60,000 bottles an hour bottling machines busy the beer is being mass produced and is suffering from its success. I have tasted the bottled beer and it is not as tasty as that at the brewery also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice, no astringency or off putting skunk flavors I normally find in the style. On the heavier side of being light bodied, creamy carbonation. Initial bready sweetness. Sweetness through off by nice brisk carbonated bite and a spicy and earthy hop character. Bitterness is moderate and the beer is more balanced then anything. Flavorful and very drinkable."
"O: This is one of my favorites, can drink it everytime; seems to be the beer of choice for ""Two and a half men"" (meaningless fact)"
""

""
""
""

"Upon tasting, I am also picking up apple, and a very slight herbal hint, (perhaps rosemary). 'Bready' is a very apt descriptor here, and the hopds are almost lemony. The mouth feel is light and crisp. Overall, very refreshing and refined!"

"Appealing brown bottle with white and gold labels with a freshness date that is most welcome. It has that perfect herbal hop aroma smell that projects a fresh crispness. The mouth feel is light and clean with some pleasant spicy bitterness and fair amount of carbonation. Yet another example of a quality German Pilsner. So what are you reading this for, go get some! ;)"
""
""
"A very tasty German pilsner, one that I’ll be adding to my favorites of the style. I would very much like to return to this in the spring or summer, as it would be an outstanding “backyard” beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a golden colour, large foamy head, moderate retention, had some lacing, clear. Aroma was nutty, mushroomy, and hoppy. I also picked up some booze which was surprising given the moderate ABV. Tasted a malty rather than hoppy bitterness, notes of grain and grass, a bit bready. Finish was sour dough like. Medium body, well carbonated, fairly coarse edge. I remember liking this beer better in the past, fairly average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel is also nice - the carbonation is frothy. And, despite its look at style, there's actually a rich, creamy feel to this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I cannot say many things bad about this beer. I am a big fan of Pilsner beers and this brew is definitely a more appealing brand than others. A case was available for a very reasonable price at a wholesale store. Considering this was my first time drinking this brand, it was a bit of a gamble to commit to such a large quantity of beer. It proved to be worth-while and I would definitely drink this again."

"I bought a 6 pack at Whole Fools on sale, and would buy it again."

""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and sessionable - refreshing and it pairs nicely with just about any food as it feels like it cleanses the palate. Also, the beer is well balanced between the flavors of the malts and the hops - not overly bitter or sweet."
""
""
""
"Brown long neck half-litre bottle -- six months before the sell-by date."
""
""
""
"It's a good German pils but the bitterness is too much on my scale."
"Overall - Well executed German pilsner. More malty, but there's enough hop to bring solid balance, especially in the finish. Got it on sale for a buck-fifty at BevMo, and it was well worth the price. I might have to buy a bottle or two more before the price goes back up."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Better than some pilsners, worse than others. Pretty good for the style, but nothing really jumps out. Would have scored higher, but the un ripe apple aspect threw me off."
""
""
""
""
""
"This yellow, somewhat sweet pils is a little light on hops, both in the taste and in the smell. Some of this style have considerably more going on. That said, it is refreshing and very drinkable. Although I will not seek it out again, it is not something to be avoided or anything - it's worth trying."
""

"Popping the top this brew has a classic grassy pilsner smell with a nice pungent hop odor. Pours to a straw color with a light foamy head that dissipates fast. Taste is consistent, more bitter than sweet, with a strong bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light, on target for the style. A good beer very in line with the style, nothing spectacular but solid nevertheless. Great to wash down a bratwurst with sauerkraut."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Pilsner malt, faintly floral, a soft herbal hop note comes in at the finish and quitly hangs around. Very refreshing and sessionable."

"500 ml bottle, clear yellow color. slightly flowery smell, but overall not very aromatic. Taste is light, floral and watery with a slight hop bitterness thats hangs around on the back end. mouthfeel is smooth with good carbonation. Overall this is a good beer. slightly above average. Refreshing very easy to drink and no off tastes. Good for a hot day."
"Staw with a finger of fine whites, brilliant clarity. Sweet pilsner malts with a nice, woody and piny nose. Interesting take on the style for the geography, takes on a almost peppery nose. Flavor is grain with a hint of corn and some dry, earthy hops. Flavor not as interesting as the nose. Thin with moderate carb and an off-dry finish. Decent, but nothing to call for seconds on."
""
"Overall: a middle of the road Pilsner which is highly quaffable. It comes together well on this sunny spring day."
"Ov: It doesn't blow you away but it isn't supposed to. You drink one, it becomes two then three. It's engaging and invites you to keep drinking. I'm glad this bar has it half off. I hope the keg doesn't blow. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: I like it. It's not my first choice, but not my last either. There's nothing standout about it in any regards."
"-Overall 4.0: Very good beer. This would be amazing with rich food as I could see its dryness cutting through the rich food like a razor. As a session beer, it is excellent, light and satisfying. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"On the nose, the beer is floral... mainly floral, but light. Refreshing in the aroma. Taste is thin and light. Malty with somewhat of a bitterness but nothing to call your mom. Similar as Bitburger. Nice summer beer, nice pilsner but not aggressive at all. Thin bodied. Refreshing. Overall a good pilsner but it is missing some punch to be great. I like it for thirsty and hot summer days."
"I found it quite average, although it comes in a bottle with lots of golden colours on the label and a golden foil on the neck, so I expected it to be one bit more ""premium""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes very malty, much more is present than hides behind the faint smell. Strong carbonation the whole way through, but strangely little head remains on top. Overall, this beer makes itself known in your mouth, and that's not a bad thing. I'd definitely drink this again, though I'm not sure I'd seek it out especially."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Again, not a style I would normally seek out but didnt want to waste 10 beers, so what the hell. The next few beers should prove enlightening."
""
""
"d) Quaffable, but not all that interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a good example of a vibrant pilsner out of Germany. I had alot of fun swishing this beer around and getting the full extent of it. I would not chug this beer, it does great taking medium mouthfulls and taking in the character of the beer. As a fan of pilsner beers, I will chaulk this up as a ""buy again"" brand."
""
""
""
""
"Flavors are non-distinct, nothing jumps out at you. The overall experience is what I love about this beer. Mildly bitter with the taste of fermented barley. It doesn't get any simpler or cleaner than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly baked pilsner malt, some water cracker malt combined grassy hops. This is a classic, clan, mineraly pilsner that can be drank, and drunk, and so on till the cows come home."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is crisp but smooth and goes down easy as it has a medium sized body. There is a nice drinkable feel and is easy going down."
"I brought a can of Radeberger home from Europe. I forgot I had tried this beer while at the German village in Epcot Disney amusement park. Anyway, I will review the can since it traveled so far!!! The beer from the can was a clear golden beer with decent carbonation that provided a decent head. The smell was mostly of grain, standard for pilsners. The taste was nicely balanced that the grain came off the pallete clean. Very easy drinking and highly recommended! Much like its draft sibling, the can is not too shabby."
"Poured this German Pilsner from a bottle into a pint glass. This beer poured a nice clear straw color, produced a nice thick head that had excellent retention. Lacing was average. The aroma was grain, and smelled much like white wine. (Grapes). The body of this brew is light, has a malted grain base, bitter, earthy herbal hops that gives way to the taste and finish of cauliflower. Nice example of a traditional German Pilsner, easy to drink, good session beer and great buy at 1.99 for a 22 oz bottle. Prefer this to many mass produced German Pilsners."
"I really like this beer. It goes great with Mexican food, and I crave it every now and then even though I'm a registered hop-head."
"Simple, solid, what do you really expect from a German Pils..."
"Gotta differ with the Alstrom’s on this one…yeah you could session this but there are SO many better, more interesting sessionable beers on the market I’d have to wonder why anyone with interesting in flavorful craft beer would choose to do so."
"Notes: A very good year round Pilsner. Cheers."
"Yellow with almost a tinge of green. decent head, and ok rising carbonation. Metalic hops, dirty/gritty malt smell. Grassy hops, relatively rich in flavor. Almost mildly metallic. Approaching a medium body. Nothing outstanding, but perfectly drinkable."
"Great clarity to a pale golden brew. Moderate head that fades rather quickly. Smell has lots of light bready malt and a peppery spiciness. Some fresh cut grass and a bit of citrus. Taste is again malty with a zingy hop spice and firm bitterness. Dry finish with bits of lemon and grass. Light crisp feel is refreshing and thirst quenching. A good representative of the style that you can session with ease."
"This beer pours with less head than I'd expect from a German Pils, but its fairly normal-looking otherwise. Earthy hops and mineral notes comprise the mainstay of the nose, with bready-doughy notes underlying. The flavor is along the same lines with clean finish. As the brew airs out a bit, it gains a modicum of floral honey sweetness. The various elements at play make for less crispness than the style calls for, as it has a bit of a soft sweetness that is more befitting, say, a Dortmunder. All-around, the beer is pretty good, but I'd reach for a Jever or Flensburger over this one if at all possible."
"Final Grade: 3.73, a B."
"Pours a clear gold color with a small 1/2 inch puffy head that fades to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grains and grassy herbal aromas. Taste is of sweet grains, grass, and an herbal/zest hop finish. Mild hop bitterness sticks around on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation making for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good German pilsener. I am glad I got to try this beer as I have never seen it anywhere else for sale."
"Crystal clear and bright yellow with a white, foamy cap. Looks nice. A bit of lacing clung to the glass. Floral and grassy aroma, a hint of hop spiciness, malt and grain. Moderate bitterness that was never aggressive, but ever present -- it also lingered in the finish along with some herbal and spicy hop flavour and a faint mineral character. Mild malty sweetness up front, followed by lemony and grassy hop notes. A little more than light bodied with crisp carbonation, off-dry, nice texture overall. This was really easy drinking. It's no hop-bomb, but there is plenty of hop character and it's well balanced. I enjoyed it and would happily purchase it again."
"D: The smells and flavors of this beer are mostly on the mark, but they really don't come through very strongly. The metallic taste brings this one down a few notches in my book."
"The beer pours out a very light yellow in color, with a very small pure white head and light lacing. The smell on our pour was really light, but it's slightly hopped and somewhat grassy. The beer is crisp, smooth, and on the lighter side for mouthfeel. The taste is slightly hoppy, somewhat herbally, and finishes dry. Overall it's an unimposing beer on the palate and drinks extremely easily."
"Overall: I like this pilsener very much. Nice levels of malt and hops, but not a complex beer. Good on a hot day. I'd have another."
"Overall a solid choice to go with a meal but nothing so special that I would particularly choose it on any other occasion."
"This is good German brew. I really enjoyed it."
"Solid pils to come out of Eastern Germany. An adequate pick to wash down lunch."
"Poured a 2"" white head. As I drank the glass gradually successive rings of foam stayed stuck to the glass in a pretty cool effect. Clear straw yellow body. Smell and taste are both pretty much BMC style with a little extra edge. Minimal finish. Certainly a nice pilsner but not sure if it's among the elite."
"My second brew during my first visit to the Brauhaus. It pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, flowers, and rice. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong undercurrent of mineral-rich water, which somehow helps things a bit here. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather crisp finish. Overall, despite the great pilsner feel, this thing just was too meek and sappy to be taken seriously as a pils. Shame, really."
"Good, crisp warm weather beer. I've had way too many better pilsners to grab this often, glad I got a sixer though."
"The carbonation is not as sharp as it is on most good pilsners. I don't find it to be a detriment here because the softer mouthfeel (in addition to the flavor profile) makes this beer very food friendly. Overall, that food friendliness and vibrant fruit character makes this a good change of pace from other pilsners. I'd happily drink this again."
"Beer is awesome, overall it is quite good. Very drinkable. Wet up front with a mild malt sweetness, mild yeastiness in the midpalate clean finish, awesome beer, truly great. One of the greats."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Served cold and finishes clean. Well constructed yet the corn notes are a bit too prevalent. Give it a try."
"Golden yellow, quite clear, big ole fluffy head. Some toasted malt, earthy, grassy, and citrus hops. Pretty solid bitterness, well-balanced with the maltiness. A very easy drinking beer, too. Good flavor, the grassy hops start becoming really evident halfway through the beer with the toasty malt. Quality."
"330ml (11.2 oz) into a snifter...large head with ok retention and lacing on top of a pale pils body, appropriate for the style. Good funk in the nose, not the whiffiest pils I've ever had, but nothing objectionable and a respectable hop and malt profile for the style. Clean refreshing taste with yeast characteristics coming through well. It's not mind blowing or anything, but it is a good session pilsener that I wouldn't have a problem drinking anytime."
"Nice easy drinking pils. Dry, clean finish, not a lot of head retention, compared to other German Pilsners. Very refreshing, with just enough bitterness. I do agree with others reviewers who say it could have a little more oomph, but nonetheless, a good beer."
"D- Solid German Pils. Like most, you can put back a bunch. Could use a little more ""umph"" to set itself apart."
"D-very drinkable and a tasty pils low abv is a plus"
"Seems like something that would be much better in Germany, rather than canned, pasteurized and flown here for it to sit on the shelf god knows how long before someone purchases it. Not bad though for $2 a pint."
"Dr: Highly priced by Berlin standards and not particularly good. Stick to the Czechs for your pilseners, lads, and leave this tap untouched."
"Mmmm. I could go for some German sausages now."
"This is an awesome beer. I think we have a high quality brewing process coupled with great ingredients here. In my opinion this is a fine pils up there with Starkenberger pils or Schweiger pils and in the highest German tradition of a Pilsener."
"This is a very good pilsner. Nice bright yellow with a small head. Aroma of grass and hay fields with a touch of dry biscuits. Flavor is again dry and grassy with a great bitterness. This is a great clean drinking pilsner. A good pilsner needs to clean your palate everytime and make you crave that bittnerness. This one does just that. This is a beer that needs to be in your fridge year-round."
"M/D) Medium body. Does not leave the mouth feeling overly dry. Seltzer-like prickle of carbonation in the back of the mouth. Very easy drinking beer. Highly sessionable. Pairs well with many food varieties."
"Light body and carbonation. Very drinkable. An excellent go to pilsner."
"overall it was alright, above average barely and not really worth a revisit."
"Clean, quality budget brew. Needs a touch more flavor, but I can easily swallow a gallon of this."
"T: very light body, bitter taste sort of metalic, not sweet notes not a very clean beer"
"Another easy drinking Pils. A good example of this style."
"Well-made, incredibly easy to drink, cheap as all get out at the LCBO, making this along with Urquell my standard pilsner pickups. At maybe 20 cents a can more than Canadian and Budweiser, this one is one well-worth stocking up for the summer!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink, quite refreshing and goes down very quickly. It really opens up your palate so it is a good choice to start out with."
"Watch out. This is a werewolf in sheep's clothing."
"Kind of reminds me of Kölsch, which is not good for a German Pils. Though it's definitely not the best out there, it's also not the worst."
"Drinkability: This is a top-class pils.This is an easy-drinking refresher that doesn't compromise on flavor."
"D - It's an average tasting beer, but when you combine that with it being light bodied and a <5% ABV it leaves it pretty drinkable. I'd find it more desirable if it didn't have a grainy finish/aftertaste."
"D) An alright pilsener. Not a standout."
"D - Very good pilsener that is easy going. Would definitely recommend it."
"Radeburger ExportBierBrauerei Gmbh. Radeburg, Germany--Radeburger Pilsner--Tafelgetrank S.M. Konig Friedrich August Von Sachsen--Koniglich Sachsische Braukunst--2009 11.2 oz. Bottle. 4.80% ABV. 25 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Rich mild lace dense white head. Clear thin bright straw yellow color. Crisp mild Pils hop not Saaz aroma front. Zesty mild butter caramel butterscotch crisp refreshing mild citrus body. Clean mild hop spice smooth Pils end. Nice German Pilsner. Sampled 3/14/2009. 6-Pack $9.29."
"Pours a light golden colour with about 2 inches of light white foam in my Pilsner glass. Smell is about average for a Pilsner, maybe some grassy overtones.Taste is a little bitter and malty with some sweetness. Nothing too special but tastes okay. Mouthfeel is good but not great. The effervescence from the foam is there; it is a relatively light tasting/feeling quaff. I am happy I tried this but it didn't really impress me. Maybe a good session beer after a long bike ride. That is when it tastes best!"
"Drinkability: very easy to drink but it down a notch as the flavor profile is a bit weak in flavor overall."
"I agree with the reviewer who said that this would be good with spicy food. I drank it alone and found it to be pretty pleasing - not overwhelmingly good, but a pretty solid pilsner nonetheless. I would recommend it (and would be curious to try it on tap)."
"D: Drinkability slightly hurt by the finish, but a decent beer. Seems like it could cut spicy foods well."
"D: A pretty nice German Pilsener."
"Looking for a straight up, everyday Pils? Here it is."
"Quite sweet on the nose, one feels a little alcohol and sweet fruity white wine with a fairly dry. On the palate, it is little appreciated. There is also a bitter and unsavory side where the resin, represented by white grapes, or even hides them, displace a hop unappetizing. Not really good in the mouth, this beer is even still in the niche for pure thirst."
"One of umpteen beers that are drinkable but offers nothing to seperate itself from the pack"
"drinkability - the on-tap version of this beer I remember being so much better than the bottled version, I'd love to have this fresh. Overall, an easy drinking beverage that I wouldn't mind keeping in my fridge"
"This is one of the local beers and I am probably a little biased but really the best Pilsner ever! One can drink all night and wake up early for work. So pure and delicious like bread on the tongue and a great slight barley malt aftertaste that demands futher drinking. When poured properly in the proper glass, this beer forms an amazing rocky head that sticks around for a while and leaves beautiful lacing. It's rare to find a Pils with such a great head. The smell is a very mild, yet spicy hops and bread dough tickle the nose hairs. Carbonation is perfect! Delicate bitterness that again demans further drinking as it teases the senses and one must have more. This beer is a must for all Pilsner fans! I suggest anyone who visits Dresden or Radeberg try the Zwickelbier on tap as well. It's more bitter with an unfiltered thickness that remains me of Franziskaner, like a Pilsner/Weissbier mix."
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt. A dull golden color, clarity isn't great and the head drops off fairly fast. The aroma is grassy, herbal, mildly sweet with floral and honey undertones. Initially malty and bready on the palate, this is a bit sweet for a pils, and the hop flavors are delicate, floral, lightly grassy in the finish. There's very little bitterness or bite, and it doesn't dry up as much as I'd like. Decent overall, but I prefer the more crisp and hoppy pilsners."
"D- Very easy to drink, could drink a few in no time."
"Drinkability, inexpensive and not bad, would buy again:)"
"D: A German pilsener for the ages, at just under 5% ABV, this pils has the integrity of a classic example of this style, and is perfectly boring. It's not bad, and if you love a good pils, this is as good as you'll get. Great balance, light body and ample flavor."
"Drink - I think this is a fantastic pilsner, definitely sessionable."
"D - This one goes down easy. Another good example of a Pilsner."
"D=Could drink this all day on a hot summer day very drinkable and can hold its own against any beer in this category, so if you are looking for a true German Pilz here ya go. PROST!!!"
"D: Yes I will grab another. This is highly drinkable and pleasant. I would gladly give it to friends that are used to pilsners and to my Dad and Uncle who love them too."
"Taste is crisp and clean with a nice hop presence that offsets the sweetness resulting in a wonderfully balanced pilsner. Finishes clean with a lingering light hoppiness. I really liked this pilsner a lot, one of the best I've had. I'll definitely buy more of this one."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"D: Very easy to drink indeed!"
"Looks really good. Clear golden with a fluffy white head that sticks all the way down the glass. Smell is aromatic herbs and bitters. A decent wallop of dryness for the taste, it stays upper palette and lasts for quite a while, turning even more bitter at the end. But a hint of base sweetness adds some needed balance.. but it needs more. Carbonated well. Glad I tried it, but I'd rather select another brand of German Pils."
"Note: Had this on tap a month ago and remembered it having more hop character. Still not a bad session pilsner."
"D: A classic example of a north-German pils."
"Drinkability - Probably a decent German Pils, but I'm just not used to the better ones. Maybe a little too prevalent of an aftertaste for repeated trips to the fridge, but a decent German Pils."
"D: Super easy to drink. This would be a pretty sessionable beer, if not for the price. Definitely not the best pilsener out there, but it is more than decent. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this beer again, but I wouldn't avoid it either."
"There must have been a miscommunication between the brewery and its brewer. They asked him to brew an authentic German pilsner and he brewed a plain-old Euro lager. Although it was a confident, very drinkable effort, a beer this bland and toneless frankly does not speak to the distinguished and esteemed tradition of German pilsners."
"D- Easy drinking and tasty, I've enjoyed some pilsners more"
"Disappointing. Clearly an unfresh or somewhat ""skunked"" bottle but also seems to lack the right floral notes and balance. Would like to taste a good fresh one to see if the shipping is to blame, but this bottled sample was a bummer."
"A little too hearty to drown yourself in. Still, its perfect amount of carbonation lightened the body enough to support its uniquely bold flavor."
"It has a crisp, light-body. It's a refreshingly dry, classic northern German pilsner."
"Overall it's a drinkable beer though I didn't realize it was going to be this hoppy before purchasing it (just saw it on the shelf and noticed that I haven't had that one yet). Don't think I would drink more than one at one sitting though. Prost"
"Drinkability is pretty decent. My only complaint is that is gets more muddled as it warms which causes it to seem a little bland. Other than that, it's around average."
"Overall, a good, clean German pilsner. I think it's one that I needed to sit down and review to appreciate its qualities, because I could see myself thinking this is just another beer if I was drinking from a can with friends."
"Of the three pilseners I've had tonight, this one looks the best, with the fairest golden color, the tallest and most structured white head, and the best head retention. Nice aroma as well, with some really pleasant, almost rye-like whole grain notes, graham crackery sweetness, and subtle cress-ish hops. Nicely fresh and grainy flavour as well, kinda like chewing on a kernel of barley malt and all the sweetness and tang that ensues. Sharp but not too sharp hops, with a flavor of hay and lemon rind, balance things out and contribute to an overall refreshing character emphasised by a dry finish and full carbonation. A very nice, robust German pilsener that could just about be called exemplary."
"D: Very drinkable. Nothing really stands out, but this is a really high quality beer that relies on the ingredients and brewing art, just as it should be."
"I'm not sure what caused me to pick up Radeberger Pilsner for the first time, but I'm glad I did. Very refreshing."
"This is a good pils and definitely can be a good session beer. i've got a cold so rating the smell is a bit tough but the flavor is there, sharp and crisp with a very good golden color. Pours a good thick head and the lacing is pretty good. Definitely would buy again as many Pils I've had lately miss the mark."
"Pours very pale gold, no haze, and a large white creamy head that retains nicely at first but recedes to a thin layer. Laces well too. Nose has some light skunk, faint herbal hops, and a cereal-malty component. The clean malty component comes through on the palate with lightly herbal hops near the end and onto the finish."
"All in all a beer you can sit down and enjoy a few for sure. Give it a try if you want something that is smooth and tasty!"
"Overall - An OK German pils"
"This just goes to show you (or me...) just how different a beer can taste and feel depending on what you've had beforehand."
"D - very drinkable. I could toss more than a few of these back. great with some beer battered chicken mmmm"
"This is a good German Pilsner beer. It is light in color and in light in body but is very refreshing and tasty. Excellent served chilled, this beer is a good companion to German foods, and I have found it to be very well paired with Japanese Sushi. I enjoyed this beer very much. It is hard to find a good Pilsner."
"Sinkability - I've got much better things to do in my life than finish this dud."
"The taste is of distinctly bitter and earthly hops and a grain flavor the whole way through, with a bit of citrus Mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, adds up to a decent session beer (especially .65 cents plus Pfand for half a liter!) but nothing too memorable."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Light to medium bodied, crisp and refreshing, a very drinkable beer and a nice pilsner."
"Could drink barrels of this stuff. Nothing out of the ordinary, just an extremely well made German pils."
"Served from a 500ml bottle. Pours a pale medium gold with a moderate head; it quickly dissipates, but it leaves impressive lacing on glass. Smell is very faint malty character, and while inoffensive, it's definitely underwhelming. Taste is slightly offputting, with not much character, but also an odd dryness or bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue. Not a bad beer, but certainly not among my favorites of the style."
"D- Pretty easy drinking but the taste detracts from this for me. Not one I would I go back to."
"D- High. Keep 'em coming, I can drink these all day long. Light enough to session with just enough flavor to cut through many a food pairing. I really like this beer. Not as hop-forward as some of the US pilsners, but it is great in its own right."
"Poured from a 500mL tall can into a pint glass. Clear golden color with a foamy white head. Grainy, hoppy aroma. Bitter taste with some spicy hops. Decent mouthfeel and well carbonated. Dry finish. Not a bad pilsner, I'd enjoy this on a hot summer day."
"Growler pour from DeCiccio's in Ardsley, NY. This one flows out quite clear, light, near straw, capped by a near white puffed up head. Tiny bubble film, sheeting ring and slippery fine lace. Unexciting nose, just a hint of grass and lime. Clean tasting pils, German hops, crisp and dry. Some more light lime and an unremarkable finish. Run of the mill pilsner."
"D- I bought a case of these at Costco. I had a few and didnt touch the rest of them until I had company coming over and I put them out. My guests seemed ok with it but I honestly dont think I would buy this again."
"Nicely drinkable. I would dub this the second most drinkable pilsner at work. Sure, it's not saying much, but it's good."
"D-overall i would say this is by far one of my favorite beers to drink with dinner, it seems to compliment almost any style of food and quenches your thirst while inspiring your BA side. excellent pils."
"Was fortunate enough to obtain a fresh case at Costco, as part of their autumnal offerings. This is a very good, no-nonsense German pilsner. I poured this into a non-stem pils glass, but with foil wrapper below the cap, this beer is perfect to drink from the 1/3 liter, brown bottle. Although the golden bubbles are fun to look at, this beer is unpretentiously designed to be consumed happily. You know sometimes a good beer is simply that."
"Flavor is slightly bready initially, clearing out quickly as the sweet malts sweep the tongue clean and finishing with viscous citrus notes. Warming allows for more complexity on the palate and a softer finish. Carbonation is good and holds steady after an initial release of gas and gives a good feel. Drink is good but kept in check by the rich body of the beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- As it should be, the texture is active enough to cut through the fat of the bratwurst... on its own, it seems that the enormous head might have taken some wind out from its sails. Definitely a great food pils for any season, emphasizing the simple and real ingredients that Germany has to offer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, there are several other beers of this kind that I would pick first. Overall, I found this beer to be just mediocre."
"The aroma was typical pils grainyness with a slight skunk scent. The flavor was also typical for the style. Guess what? The body was as expected for the style as well. The drinkability suffered due to the skunkieness, but I bet having this close to the source would be a treat. Worth trying if you see it, but not worth going out of your way for."
"Drinkability: Excellent, a wonderful session beer."
"Overall a good representation of the style, and one that i enjoyed consuming, but it can't touch my Bitburger with a 10 foot pole. I might buy it again, but probably not regularly. A good pilsner."
"D - pretty drinkable, haven't had it on tap in a while but should be pretty tasty."
"D - One of the best pilsners I have tasted (if not the best), really a great beer. I would like to find Radeberger on tap somewhere, and taste it at it freshest. One of the most drinkable beers I have come across, and with a relatively low ABV it can be happily enjoyed as a session beer. I urge people to try this, as I think it is easily one of the best pilsners in the world."
"M/D sharp, crisp and very nice drinking how a pilsner should be"
"D: Alright pilsner."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonated on the higher side, spiced with hops."
"On tap at Bukowski's Back Bay. Served in a tall pilsener glass. Bright yellow color, with a very clear and clean body. Tons of carbonation. Smell was a bit musty. Taste was a very crisp barley flavor. Slight vegetable-like aftertaste. Very thin beer, but not watery. I would say that it's a very easy beer to drink quickly. Not overly flavorful, but a nice straight forward pils that you can pair with a nice sandwich, or sit and drink a few in one siting. A fine example of a quality German lager."
"D: If you like pils you owe yourself one (or several). Not really my thing but I have to respect the execution and would have no problem drinking them as long as someone felt like serving it to me."
"Pretty good for a beer with a lot of words on the bottle I can't read."
"One of my favorite pilsners in the world, this was better on tap in Berlin germany than in the bottle in the United States, where i usually have it. Had a half-liter and it was bright, clear, perfectly carbonated and perfectly bitter. I could drink 100 of these."
"Drinkability: average abv and pleasant taste makes this highly drinkable for me"
"Cheers!"
"D/O: An easy-to-drink German Pilsener that's much better than most of the popular imports, but not quite as good as the best German and American interpretations of the style. Regardless, this is still a fine alternative to Heineken, Beck's, Amstel, etc., and has more complexity than a domestic macro. It's light, refreshing, crisp, clean, and quite sessionable. It also should appeal to most domestic and mainstream import drinkers."
"Review from notes. Highly recommended."
"A pretty rock solid German Pilsner. Unless you completely dispise the style, I'd suggest giving it a try."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is easy and has a mild astringent feel from the hops. Yeasty on the end with nothing foul. Very drinkable, but not for the price. (8.49 6pk)"
"This is a really good session beer, you could easily drink several of them (if you wanted to). You don't feel the alcohol."
"A fairly drinkable, well balanced German Pils. Like its brethren, there is only so much you can say about these offerings. I could see myself enjoying more than a few of these, in a tied house, Oktoberfest-related or not."
"pour is golden with a tight head a first. bubble expand and become rather soap like in a few minutes. mild lace. smell of apples, mild earth, some hop. taste is rather mild. everything comes through light hop, light apple, a moment of earthy straw. rather neutral. the carbonation is a bit... much. the beer seems to be a bit better as it get warmer though."
"Could definitely see myself throwing back a couple of these (and I did) on a regular basis when I'm not trying to get a strong buzz."
"Looking for an excellent German Pils, try this one. Drank this one on draft in NYC at Lederhosen. Very tasty light brew with a nice aroma. Decent head that lasts. Left minor lacing. Very drinkable. I wish we could get this one in upstate New York in draft. I'd have it on in my house."
"Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with soapy pure white head that slowly settled. The aroma is a bit grainy and grassy. A dry cracker like malt and grassy hops. The taste is of a grassy stale hop, very light lemon, a metallic twang and a barely there malt presence. The feel is light with prickly carbonation, has a bitter presence and finish. Could be a little crisper. Drinks very easy, good beer to drink on a nice spring day. Could use more of a grassy flavor and malt presence but still is good. Nice clean flavors."
"I enjoyed this Pils very much. Could easily be an all night session beer."
"The taste is nice malty grain, yeasty dough, with strong malty sweetness balanced by nice pine-herb-lemon bitterness. It's smooth and rather full-bodied yet lively and zesty, with the feel and taste leaving a crisp, lightly bitter herbal finish."
"Great german pils."
"This one is a clear golden color that pours a pillowy pure white head that sticks around for a while, though it doesn't leave a lot of lacing. The smell is more than I expected: some light fruit notes with a mix of grains and hops and a light spicy herbal aroma as well. The taste is a good blend of lightly spicy, herbal and earthy hops with light malt and a balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel is typical pilsner: light to medium body, crisp and clean. This one is pleasantly more balanced and complex than I expected going in and generally quite drinkable."
"Kind of interesting. Got this bottle at the nearby Supermercado Disco here in Recoleta, Buenos Aires. 2nd bottle in on the shelf. Served it chilled, but not cold. Poured with a nice white head that went down to a light partial cover and some lace. Clear gold color. Aroma is beery, a faint whiff of skunk when first poured, some malt, grass, grain, hop, and light fresh sawdust. Flavor had the barest hint of skunk that disappeared right away. Not too bad bitter sweet thing but the sweetness is without character. Good body and carbonation. Drinkable. Better nearer to the brewery and fresher no doubt. I'd have another."
"D: Nice German Pils. Low ABV is a bonus. I normally would not buy a bottle so far out of date - was 07/08, it is now 03/09, but, for 2 bucks, what the heck. The beer didn't seem tired at all, but, maybe a bit light struck."
"A very pale yellow gold color with a modest white fizz of cover and similar lacing. The aroma is a fairly typical clean wheat with just a kiss of citrus and plenty of pumpernickel bread goodness. The flavor kicks in as solid pilsner deep bready goodness. Delicately carbonated, a chewy body feel for the style but still maintains the crisp refreshing drinkability. This is a simple tastey treat, another excellent German pilsner, definitely worth a try."
"When seeking out exports, I look for the ""good before"" dates. This batch I tried was about 7 months out from that date etched on the bottle's wrapper. This is the best German pilsner I think I've ever had. The appearance and smell are very nice, and the taste did not let me down. Overall, a very fresh, hopsy taste, not too bitter or sweet. A fine body. I can't wait to try this excellent German pilsner again."
"Nice looking, better than average pilsner. It's a light golden beer with a big creamy white head. It smells and tastes fairly fresh and clean. The malt is light and easy to drink. The bitter finish is spicy and crisp. My only real criticism is that it doesn't quite stand out, but then I'm not the most refined connoisseur of European lagers. There are some floral and citric hops with some light vegetable tone. It's a very solid beer, but it doesn't really stand out. At any rate, it's a good beer."
"Golden yellow with a big fat sudsy head that leaves globs of lace on the glass. Grassy, noble hops dominate the nose with some bread dough and lemon. Tastes much like the nose would indicate grassy hop bitterness balanced nicely with a light citrusy graininess. Light on the palate and easy drinking. Finishes dry. Refreshing."
"Not my taste. very hard to be fair. I was told that this is typical of German Pilsners. Almost tasted stale and skunky to me. Might me my noobish taste buds. Please go to other reviews for the time being."
"Overall, this was a great starter beer before a meal. Won't overshadow food, and could be a great session beer anytime or terrific for hot summer days."
"Drinkability - very drinkable. I would definitely pour another of these."
"Drinkability - a good sessionable pils that will pair well with food and/or hotter weather (said on the eve of the season's biggest winter storm due tomorrow night - yikes)."
"Notes: I would pick this up way more often if I could find it easier here in BG. As it is I had to go to the big city 30 mins away from me to get a single bottle that might have been overpriced. But I'll pick it up again every once and a while when I pass through the ""big city."""
"D: Very drinkable, very easy going down. I liked this as it wasn't too strong in any area and was very drinkable and a lower amount of alcohol."
"D: An authentic German Pils with exceptional drinkability."
"Sunshine and a fresh six pack of this would guarantee a pleasant afternoon. My thanks go out for the fresh beer delivery."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this, particulary because it's got more character then alot of the borings Pils on the market. I'm glad I tried this from tap."
"D - While it's not as good as a Pils poured in Germany, this is an excellent example of the style. Crisp, clean and malty. At $3.29 per bottle this is highly recommended."
"This is a typical German Pils. Clean and refreshing and a great compliment to the darker heavier sauces of German food."
"This is one of my favorite pilsners, one of the best in my opinion. I poured this one out of the can into a pilsner glass, nice head after a medium pour. You can really smell the hops in this one, nice and inviting. This is truly a delicious beer, goes down with good hop bitterness up front, and finishes hoppy and crisp. Delicious. Drinkability on this one is perfect, I can knock these back all night. Truly a nice beer! Highly recommended!"
"M/D- good amount of carbonation and not too fizzy. This is a very drinkable beer- what American light beers should be. Definitely a step above your average German pils."
"D - This is a pretty good pils. It brings a nice hop bite for the style."
"First thought after first sip ""Oh geez - now THAT'S a good Pilsner!"" Loved it. Classic German Pils. Drink it cold. This beer does fine on it's own but would really make a great accompaniment to any good meal. It's like water - but better! Not that they really compare, (and just in case you're not a BA person - and don't know what a Pilsner is) a very classic American Pilsner is Budweiser (which - I happen to enjoy, but would take the Radeberger in a heart beat). So, where you may happen to enjoy a good Bud - consider switching to a Radeberger. If you can find it, you won't regret it..."
"Drinkability is good for a warm day. It is light, crisp, and refreshing, but there is not a ton of crazy flavor or taste to this beer. Fairly average..."
"Had on tap at Atwood's. The drink had a darkened gold look with some great lacing on the side. Awesome aromas with some good, yeasty tones and a herby, sweet aroma. Very tasty with a light, yeasty and bready balance. The mouthfeel, I must say, was excellent and perfect. Wickedly crisp and refreshing, was really a treat drinking. Overall, a really, really good pilsener."
"Next summer Prima Pils will have to share some space with this one.I am not saying the two are on the same level,just that this was good enough to get a shot in the rotation."
"pretty much has good quality macro lager written all over it. not all that unlike a cross between bud and canned heineken, and perhaps slightly better."
"Overall I was impressed by this beer. The thickness is the biggest thing, very solid for a pilsener. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall-very well made German pilsner, a highlight of the style, nice flavor, nice balance, and nice drinkability, a great job. American brewers should take notice."
"WTF is earth shattering?? This is a lovely beer regardless of its lack of earth shattering potential. It's highly drinkable, with a wonderful German maltiness, covered up nicely by firm bitterness. Bitterness is definitely in the mouth feel as well. A masterpiece in the brewing arts."
"D: Good drinkability, good to style, and very nice to consume. Goes down nicely and one that is enjoyable."
"D - this is probably my favorite pilsner I have tried thus far."
"The taste is quite crisp, a bit grassy, there is some spiciness to the beer in the finish, and a bit of a floral taste, almost perfumey, in the mid section. The spicey florals hang on into the finish and beyond. The beer is quite carbonated, light bodied, refreshing, but I'm knocking the mouthfeel down a few notches because of the florals that linger way too long."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Fairly good example of a pilsner. A nice, summer beer as well as a decent session beer."
"D - This is a killer pils! It does everything right for the style and nothing wrong in any department. This well rounded pils is one of the best out there honestly. It may not stun anyone with outlandish hops or spice, but it's just a damn good beer."
"This is a good, if not world shattering, German pilsner. Pours a beautiful yellow with a large fluffy head. The aroma is sprightly and lemony with a little sweetness. The flavor is smooth and surprisingly complex, though distinctively pilsner, with a slight hop bitterness and a little lemony character. The mouthfeel is light and has a nice carbonation bite. Delicious and refreshing."
"pours a clear light straw yellow with a huge fluffy white head that holds very well with lots of lace. smells of corn and husk and earth. taste is clean and fresh with a good hop balance and a dry finish. light and refreshing keeps you wanting the next one, will be looking for it again."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that leaves a good amount of retention. The aroma is grainy malt with some grassy hops. The taste is extremely crisp and refreshing. The taste starts off with some malt and finishes with a quick spicy hop finish leaving you craving the next sip. This beer accomplished everything I was looking for, it is highly drinkable and packs enough flavor to keep me from getting bored. Very sessionable in the warmer summer months. Overall, this is a pretty solid German Pilsner that is recommended."
"Recommended..."
"Bright clear yellow with a huge sticky pure white head. The smell is faint light grain and soft floral hops, very nice. The taste is again light grain bittered with floral hoppiness light and pretty clean. Finish is pretty dry with just a hint of lingering grain and spicy hop bite maybe a bit too sticky in the finish, just not clean enough for my taste. Overall quite good hard to beat on a bright sunny day after long day at work, I'd have it again."
"If this is the only choice for Pilsner, it's still a good one."
"pours a brilliant pale yellow w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving a little lacing in my pilsn glass ; not a strong smell, cereal grains and some herbal hop ; a crisp taste, bready malts well balanced w/ spicy noble hop bitterness, nice clean finish ; a fairly dry, light-bodied brew w/ a decent level of co2 ; a very drinkable beer and an excellent pilsner, i'll be sure to pick up more of this one..."
"Not a bad beer but I wont be looking for it again."
"Booooring!"
"Very easy drinking and great tasting. This beer lends itself to drinking with a low ABV and a light body. If you can get this fresh definately try one. The beer has a best before date on the back label."
"Pours straw yellow and very clear with a nice light bright white head. Carbonation is assertive but on point for style. Smells of husky grains and noble hops. This is a well above average German pils that is clean and crisp with just the right bitterness to grain sweetness balance. Dry and drinkable, as it should be."
"A bit heavy handed on the carbonation and, combined with the hops, this numbs the tongue a bit. Not bad, but I can find better examples of a German pils."
"Truly an above averge beer with great drinkability."
"Drinkability is very solid, I could see myself at a summer BBQ having a few of these over the course of the day while eating some good eats."
"D: Easy drinker but there are a lot of local pilsners that are fresher and I would even prefer a Warsteiner."
"You can drink it, though, that's not a problem."
"A very pretty clear golden amber, rather appealing. Aroma is typical of this kind of beer, but strong. Flavor is full, malty, crisp - average for a pilsner except richer than most, and not watery. Texture is smooth and lively, and the aftertaste has just a touch of bitterness."
"Great drinkability ..."
"This is a very easy-drinking German pilsener, most of these lighter lagers are very underrated on BA (and certainly aren't as good as some beers with more flavour and edginess) but as representatives of their styles they are very tasty."
"D - Very nice quaffer and quite sessionable at 4.8%"
"Drinkability: Crisp and refreshing. Very sessionable. Great lawn-mower beer to. Why drink a Miller when you can get this at a buck more?"
"500ml bottle. Pale ,clear yellow lager, with a good sized thick/frothy pure white head.Pleasant bready aromas with a good backing of fresh grassy hop, nice. THis one has quite a luscious malt taste to it with the hops popping through like pinpricks, hops are grassy/lemony not harsh. I loved the pleasing silky thick ( for the style) palate to this one. Very nice Pils indeed"
"belle couleur blé, le collet est d'une blancheur immaculée, la mousse est épaisse et durable, le nez est frais et malté, la bouche est piquante, épicée, elle est longue, bon goût malté, rafraichissante à souhait. bonne lager blonde."
"After helping to administer a final exam today, a group of graduate students, the professor and I went to a local restaurant and enjoyed sandwiches and a couple pitchers of Radeberger. Not bad. It pours a clumpy thick, white head, a couple fingers thick atop a light golden body, with the head modestly lacing on the way down the tall mug. The nose is quiet, with a good whiff of hops. Same with the taste for certain, with a nice bitterness coating the tongue. Were it not for driving in some snow, I would have had more than one in a heartbeat. Not spectacular, but a pretty decent Pilsner."
"500 mL can purchased at the LCBO. Pours darker than the average pilsner (gold, rather than yellow), with a 1/2 finger white head. Very little aroma; what's there is faintly spicy with a little bit of a metallic note. Taste is good and clean, lightly hoppy, and an excellent mouthfeel. Nothing to write home about here, but better than average swill."
"Drinkability: crisp and refreshing with nice simple tastes. I will definitely revisit this beer again."
"A passable lager but not really a Pilsner to my taste buds. I had been expecting at least a Pilsner Urquell but this doesn't get there. Don't buy in quantity."
"Drinkability: A pilsner with little to offer and lacking much of an identity of its own, it was hard to get too excited about it when Victory Prima was also readily available."
"Served out of a Radeberger pilsner mug with a nice head of foam on the top. It went down with a decent aftertaste. Nice golden color and body. A beer that would be good if you are not in the mood for something heavy, but don't want to drink a macro. Overall a decent beer."
"As far as pilsners go, this one is fine. High quality, good substance to it."
"D:	A nice German pilsener that goes down easy and would please anyone looking for that authentic pilsener flavour. Because of its light body, this would make a great session beer but I quite enjoyed sipping it, trying to figure out its flavours. Nothing outstanding, but an enjoyable taste experience. I would definitely buy this one again."
"Light spice and mild herbs and pine come at you thru the nose on this one all going down refreshinly crisp,with some bitterness hitting your tongue quite well,a hint of fermentation as it goes down your throat,quite easily consumed,not a bad beer at all easy to drink and would be quite enjoyable on hot summer days.Well worth a try."
"Radeberger Pilsner. Saw it on sale for $6.99 a six pack and thought ""what could I lose?"". Straw yellow with a nice soapy head, lots of carbonation. Smells pretty clean like a good German pilsner, just a hint of skunk. Crackery malt with a gentle hoppy bite. No skunkiness detected on the taste. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Clean and simple overall. I'm impressed with the lasting head and lacing as I work my way down. A good imported pilsner and at $6.99 a six pack it's deffinately worth a try. But... what's up with the 11.2 ounce bottles?!"
"Overall: A pretty nice pils. It is good tasting, light and refreshing"
"Light and body and crisp too. Not bad for a more mainstream pilsner."
"Overall not my favorite pilsner. Not nearly as flavorfull as Pilsner Urquell but a decent german style pilsner that will easily find its way to porches and patios over the days of summer and fall."
"Taste is pretty bitter, hoppy and has no real yeast taste, like sulfur or anything. The malt is fresh and pilsnerlike. Not the most exciting beer ever, but decent."
"Overall: a boring pilsener. No news, no special characteristic. Dont deserve a higher grade."
"D: Another drinkable German pils, nothing to blow you away, just a good drinkable, refreshing lager beer."
"As for drinkability, this was a smooth, flavorful and easy-drinking pilsener. Though it may lack the hop bitterness and lively carbonation that some of its counterparts possess, it is nevertheless a refreshing beer, perfect for summer barbecues."
"Well it's got the bitterness down, but the malt profile and hops flavor leave something to be desired. It did have a little nice lacing and it was a proper light gold. Still, the aroma was too faint, as were the grains and spicy flavors of the hops. Still not a bad beer, I enjoyed it on a hot day."
"Will certainly take the time to search this one out again."
"Poured a clear gold color. Very heavy carbonation. Nose was clear and slightly malty. Something was of with the flavor. Like wet paper. Tasted like I was licking a stamp. Light mouthfeel. Just a tad sourish. For wahtever reason I could just not wrap myself around this beer. Thebartender told me it was a fresh keg but I was unable to ignore the paper flavor."
"Drinkability- One of my two go to pils. This and Warsteiner. Can't beat the $2.50 deal at the Toronado either."
"On tap, served in a pint glass. Flimsy white head sits on top of a nice, clear golden straw pils. No head retention whatsoever. Smells of spicy hops and somewhat fresh grains. Medium body with a crisp hop flavor at first. Hop flavor rolls into a nice bitter stage and then finishes off with a bit of sweet, malty gain flavor...almost biscuity. Not quite as herbal or fresh tasting as I would like, but certainly not bad by any means. Very drinkable as well. A few of these soothed my stomach just fine after a very large meal."
"Very carbonated with decent head head retention. Slightly stronger yellow than most pilsners I've seen. Nothing remarkable about the aroma, taste or mouthfeel, just better than most American pilsners I've tried. I didn't have any problem getting it down, but then again pilsner is not my favorite style of beer."
"Edit (8-17-08) mouthfeel and drinkability better than recollection upon recent tasting."
"Sickly yellow, I was actually amazed at how clear light this beer was. The head was nice and long lasting. It had good carbonation, very balanced. The taste was another story though, amazingly bitter for pilsner, yet didn't have any outstanding flavor profiles to speak of that could make up for it. There are hundreds of German pilsners, no reason to settle for this one."
"D = Drinkable. I just don't like pilsners."
"An easy to drink good German Pils, but nothing good enough to really seperate itself from an already crowded pack."
"Not bad. Nice bit of bitterness for a pilsner. Worth a try."
"In general, not a good German Pils. Poor King Frederick August III of Saxony, I hope he had better drinks than this to console his abdicating soul..."
"Why scored so high? My Radegerger was delivered to me by my roomate's house-guest who just flew in from Berlin two days ago. Eight hours on a plane sure beats 2 weeks on a boat followed by uncounted weeks on various loading docks, warehouses, and a retail shelf. This the classic taste of German pilsner that I remember from my first trip there 14 years ago. It is crisp, dry, a little soft, and has a firm, light malt character that whispers toast or crackers beneath a delicate minty hop flavor and aroma. Balance and finesse are the watchwords of the style as these beers go down way too easily, and recall fond memories of my excursions in Germany where I intentionally allowed the beers to follow one after the other in rapid succession. The golden color and malty aroma beg to remind me of the long walks I took through vast wheat fields; in love with the beer that soothed the hurt for the German girl I was in love with. After all those years, it was the beer that stayed true."
"In the nose, grassy, herbal, floral, and mildly spicy hops sway atop a delicate, subtly sweet, and grainy maltiness. It's medium bodied and gently crisp in the mouth, leaving it to lightly tingle the tastebuds before it warms to become almost creamy smooth. The flavor is fuller than the nose suggests, but remains the same with the addition of a light touch of lemon amidst the grassy, gently herbal, and floral hops. Again, it's remarkably well-balanced... polished even! An excellent, gently crisp and refreshing pilsner of the highest caliber!"
"The taste started bitter and hoppy before yielding to a malty middle. It ended with a distinct spiciness and I was impressed with how harmoniously the different flavours worked together. The carbonation was high in keeping with the style, but the mouthfeel was a bit sticky for my liking."
"I would gladly order/buy this pilsner again. Subtle and fine."
"The mouth is light and crisp, with a touch of buttery-ness at the end. Not a whole lot of complexity happening here. The drinkablity is high, but the flavor is somewhat lacking. I truly like a good pils, but this one is average at best."
"Gold color , clear  minimal white head nose is sour , grassy , cereal , melon , hopps , and detergent - taste of sour / bitter , grassy , hops , and wet hay  dry harsh mouth feel for a light beer  sour , cereal , and grass aftertaste nothing special for a pilsner"
"Everything about this pilsner was sort of average. The color was an average yellow and with some foam and very little lace of the glass. The smell was pleasant and not over powering. The taste was pleasant with just enough of bitterness as to not overpower the average hop taste. Great quincher on a hot day and cold day too. Little better than average taste than other pilsners!"
"Pours a clear yellow color with a towering and firm white head. Its an attractive and impressive Pilsner appearance. The aroma is a little weak, but presents an initial shot of floral and slightly herbal hops, backed with a hint of grain. The beer could have used a dose of malt aroma, and certainly more intensity in the hops. The flavor is pretty tasty, with a little sweetness up front. The centerpiece of the beer is certainly the hops, which are a little more pronounced in the taste. The finish is a little bitter, and pretty clean. Fairly high carbonation, and light-to-medium body. All in all, this is a drinkable and respectable German beer."
"D: A very drinkable beer"
"Drinkability - Appealing to look at like most german pils. Rather good head retention i felt as i find some pils to retain no head at all from the bottle. Hoppy taste does not linger too long in the mouth which may make if forgetable however the medium level of carbonation is easy on the stomach making this pils a nice example of the german style and easy enough to have a few."
"Standard and typical of German Pilsners. Perhaps a bit of a standout, is a heaping helping of saaz, earthy hops. Though the malt profile is moderate, more grain flavors than malt sweetness persists in the aroma and flavor. The look is a very clear moderately carbonated and retented foamstand. Feels fairly smooth, but not with the pilsner creamy texture that I wanted, leaving the grain profile to come across a bit astringent (grain hulls). Finishes pretty clean overall with a light grain and hop lingering. Undoubtedly a good beer to pair with a weinerschnitzel dinner."
"First taste is a bit muddled. A slight metallic twang presides, which is a bit offputting. A nutty maltiness and a lot of alcohol for a 4.8% beer. Strong hop presence that becomes very prevalent as the beer warms. Slight sourness that is very refreshing. This is a good refresher beer, sticky in the mouth, good bite on the tongue. Drinkable, and better if it isn't ice-cold. A good summer pilsener."
"Pale straw color with a bright white dense head leaving lots of clingy foam. The nose is bright and fresh, with only a hint of sulfur and something vegetal, cabbagey. The taste starts with plenty of hop bitterness, plenty of carbonation, decent malt and an interesting aftertaste, apples and Earl Grey. Very refreshing, ultra drinkable. The flavors are quick but true. It doesn't get sickly sweet as it warms, remains quaffable all the way."
"Classic pilsner from Saxony. Lighter than most its German counterparts but tastier. Malty sweetness gives way to hoppy bitterness in the finish. Nice complex aroma, too, pleasant aftertaste, impeccable appearance. Good honest beer, much loved in Germany."
"Notes: Overall this is a damn fine example of a German pilsner and one I'll go back to when I see it fresh."
"A very pale yellow with nice head retention. Not overly carbonated. Unfortunately it has a detergent smell to it and is far too sweet in the aftertast. It says it's just water, malt, hops and yeast but it actually tastes corn syrup to me. Not the worst beer ever but i will pass it by the next time."
"Overall: Drinkable, but not a lot of flavor that makes you want to drink it."
"Mouth: Nicely balanced flavor touching all parts of the tongue. It enters with a sweetish flavor of grains/bread. As it moves back there are notes of kitchen spices, predominantly of coriander. All the way in the back the bitter, metallic hop flavors dominate the mouth. This is a refreshing beer but the over-carbonation piques the nerves a bit too much. I recommend a violent pour to loosen the beer up a bit."
"Had a slightly cloudy golden appearance with a little white head. Nothing stood out in the smell department. Had a slightly sweet, wheaty taste. Little bubbly, but generally a smooth pour down the back of the throat. Great beer to drink on a sunny afternoon or a hot afternoon or a cold night or a windy day or a...you get the idea."
"Very drinkable on tap."
"Black 500 ml can with gold writing, BB date stamped on the bottom. Bought a 4 pack and got a free logoed glass. Pours out a clear, straw yellow color, topped off with a large billowy head of white foam, very good retention, with thick chunky lacing. The smell is quite light, with light floral hops and some graininess. The flavor is a nice balance of sweet bready malt which blends into a lightly floral hop finish. There was a bit of a metallic twinge. Light and crisp mouthfeel across the palate, that leaves a dry, crisp finish. A good pilsner, it's not really unique or overly flavorful, but fits the style well."
"A decent German Pilsner that I'd be interested in trying in a bottle to see if that metallic quality is still present. I'm not a big fan of floral hops either and that combined with the metallic twang lowers the taste quite a bit. Looks fantastic, could be a bit more golden, but the mouthfeel, drinkability and weak aroma don't stand out in any way. Worth a try."
"Pours a very light yellow with a large, billowing white head that is slow to dissipate and leaves some lacing as it recedes. A floral hoppiness overlays the nose, with spices, yeast, and some malts as well. Taste is sweet with some fruits and malts in the mix, and a hoppy tone throughout which becomes more noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp, light and well carbonated. Drinkability is solid. A very acceptable example of the style."
"Better than average. I'd say it's a ""milder pilsner"" that's easy to take."
"Excellent session beer. good beer to keep in the cooler at a barbecue."
"Comments: Very disappointing. A pilsner can be so much more than this."
"I would recommend this, not to light and not to strong. A good example for a German Pilsner."
"I've also had it in a bottle, with the same experience, except that one had a slight bottle-iron taste."
"well, kind of disappointing. where are the hops?? these guys should know better shouldnt they?"
"This is a beer that deserves way more credit. And as a whole, pilsners seem to be overlooked but they are really becoming one of my favorite styles more and more these days. But back to this particular pils. It's very well made and true to style, with out being too textbook. Appears a perfect pale color, straw like, with excellent clarity. A decent dense head lasts for a while. Once again, this style seems to be overlooked, and if you're looking for a beer that's going to smack you in the face with flavor, go to the west coast and drink some IPAs. This beer has a lot of subtleties to it that all seem to work together. A sturdy base of pale malts and light honey tastes combine with a really spicy and herbal hop profile. Nice black pepper hints and general zestyness. A bit of lemony zang in there as well. One of the smoothest beers I've ever drank, and perfect for when you want to drink more than a few in an evening. Definately do yourself a favor and check out some pilsners, it'll make you rethink a few things about beer in general. Well I guess I'm just speaking for myself when I say that, but regardless, this beer is great."
"A solid German Pilsner. Poured out to a clear mellowed blonde color with a respectable 1/2 inch head. Some minor lacing around the glass. Odors of grass, grain and dough are prominent. Taste is mild and enjoyable; flavors of hops, malt and grain, all the while remaining light and fresh. Lighter mouthfeel leads me to believe that this could be a good session beer. Probably even better on tap. Worth a try."
"Radeberger Pilsner is a generic pilsener. To be fair, though, it's a decent, drinkable generic pilsener. Having said that, I doubt that I'll remember it past the point when I click the 'review' button."
"I'd drink it again... And again..."
"Slight spicy (peppery) hop bite followed by a smooth malty finish. Very smooth mouthfeel --the carbonation is tickly and pleasant. It does have some stickiness but it is in a velvety way. Extremely quaffable golden pilsener."
"Won't blow you away, but all-in-all, pleasant and easy to drink."
"Canned. Poured out a clear pale straw pilsner with an impressive fluffy white cap that laces the glass well... very light nose; gentle grassy aromas with diminutive wisps of sweet grains. Starts malty and citrusy then the hop bittering takes over the malt spine ( which is too thin IMHO) and it ends in a dry bitter finish. I can take or leave this one...with more substantially malted, distinctive German beers like Konig, Wernesgruner and Gosser on the LCBO shleves for the same coin why would they offer this marginally premiun beer?"
"A very decent German pilsner."
"Quite the pleasant change of pace after sampling some high quality stouts, Belgians, and old ales. This pours a pale straw yellow body that is clear as a pristine mountain stream. Fluffy white head quickly diminishes into film and patchy lace. Aroma is grainy malt and spicy German hops, with a grassy hops component. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Light medium body. Taste is just right for a well constructed German Pilsener. Grainy and bready malt is happily married to the grassy and herbal hops. Aftertaste is dry and mildly bitter and astringent. Very clean and crisp. I would love to have a case of this one in the ""Fridge"". Ideal lawnmower beer, with elegant German class."
"I try and stay away from cans, but there are certain exceptions, most of them Germans. A classy black and gold can, definitely not your run of the mill type. This lager is a very pale straw colour, with great clarity. The head gives it an above average appearance; creamy, extremely consistent: it poured with only about 1 finger of head, but it simply did not seem to move. Bright white, ice cream, velvety look to it. It actually looks much like milk from the top, that is how tight and creamy it is. Some large bubble lacing, better than many bottled lagers. The aroma is typical of a German pilsener, but it is appetising and has all the smells I was expecting: subdued fruitiness, pale malt, hop grassiness. The aroma is well balanced between the three. Fresh, adjunct free aroma. Typical taste too, but well brewed. All the regular suspects here: grainy malt in the front and middle, and a very respectable dryness, grassy and even oily. I taste some good caramel, wheat cereal, and hard water. The hops leave some earthy notes and metallic ironlike ones. A balanced taste, with the hops slightly more dominant in the finish. Toned down carbonation compared to many canned pilseners, which is a nice change. Mouthfeel is dry, but not overly, and medium bodied. Just full and just watery enough to make it highly drinkable. Radeberger is a typical, unexciting but well done lager in the German tradition. This is worth a try on a summer day."
"What a remarkable pils. Nothing tastes better than a hard day a work and coming home to a golden CRISP taste of Radeberger. I believe it comes from this region of Germany where the pils taste like heaven. The best beer from Saxony and the best German pils hands down."
"Not the best pilsner I've had, but not bad. I wouldn't kick it out of the fridge for eating crackers."
"OK pils with tons of creamy foam. Can metallic influence, but the only choice at LCBO. Light mouthfeel. Points as not sticky dry finish, rather nice bit of clean and somewhat sweet aftertaste. Herbal character and would go with smoked foods in meal. A beer to be had on the colder side."
"Pours a light gold color. The head is frothy and big with average retention and a patchwork of lace left behind. The aroma is of barley, some grassy saaz hops and a sulfury note. The taste is a great mix of robust bready malts, and sea air saaz hops. The mouthfeel is light but very smooth and pleasant. An above average pilsner, very tasty and full."
"drinkability: is not bad, a fairly good pilsener, that I wouldn't mind trying again, but nothing to get excited about."
"Came in a black 500 ml can. Pours out a clear, crisp straw colour, capped by a large billowy head of white foam, excellent retention, with thick chunky lacing. The nose is faint, with metallic grains and light floral hops. The flavour is a decent balance of sweet bready malt, moving towards metallic grains in the middle, which blends seemlessly into the floral, slightly herbal hop finish, and carries through the aftertaste. Excellent quenching mouthfeel across the palate that turns on a dime into a dry, crisp finish. The hops are contained and do not turn astringent. A very impressive pilsener, it's not overwhelmingly unique or flavourful, but has everything in the right place and stands on its own as a good standard for the style."
"Recommended"
"Crisp, autumn leaf colour that reminds me of fishing at sunset. Big, fluffy head pours straight outta the can, but slowly subsides to about one lasting finger. Lace sticks to the glass at random intervals. Hard to describe, but basically a chaotic pattern of lacy foam. Bakery bread smell, with not much hops. The nose is almost fooled into thinking this is a solid food, not a liquid; the bread smell is so convincing. Taste is more balanced than the scent. Their is that malty flavour upfront. It's like drinking fresh white bread. Tasty, and settles great in the stomach. Yet the aftertaste has a bittering dryness, a quick slap letting you know hops are used in this pilzner. Mouthfeel is a bit thick. Pretty drinkable as a session beer, and something most people would at least like."
"This beer pours a standard yellow color with a small head that quickly fades away. Skunky aroma - not even slightly interesting. Maybe it was a bad bottle, maybe it was a standard pilsner from that area. The taste was not interesting to me. Crisp and slightly clean, but still skunky in the taste. Didn't care for this one."
"Pours a pale straw colour and has a nice floral smell. The taste is decent but it does not have as crisp a finish as i like in my Pils. The finish fades away but this is a very drinkable beer - great for sessions but a little pricey compared with other Pilseners that i prefer."
"BC has a lot of Euro lagers in 500ml cans which is good because they can be purchased individually and are never light struck. Radeberger is the newest available German lager and it is pretty decent all round. The colour is pale gold with a hoppy nose. The profile is fresh and full bodied with a hoppy finish. This is much better than any BC lager due its balance and big flavour. At $2.10 a can this is a great deal and well worth buying."
"This is just another run of the mill German lager. Boring, boring, boring. The beer pours typical lager, except it has quite a large dense head. Smells faintly of earthy hops. Flavour comes through the same: crisp, clean with a strong earthy hop character. Not bad, but not something I will return to."
"This is a disappointing beer; I was expecting something similar to a Czech Pilsner (German style). This was a very distant in-bred cousin. Thumbs down."
"Pours a clear greenish gold under a one finger white head that fades quickly but musters a few spots of lace. The nose is sweet malt. The mouth is light and prickly. There is a decent malt base taste, overlayed with a light hoppy bite. The hops are neither flowery nor metallic, just crisp and clean. This bite lingers a bit into the aftertaste, but is mild and short-lived. Radeberger is better now than when it was the flagship brew of the GDR, but it still ain't no great shakes."
"This pours with a clean yellow body. There is a nice foamy head that leaves a little lace. There is a distinct fruity aroma ( grapes), a wine like aroma. The flavor starts out with a light sweet graininess and finishes with a smooth bitterness at the back off your tongue. A mildly refreshing easy drinking Pilsner."
"A very drinkable beer... pretty much sums up all the things that are good about a pilsner. Overall a great drink!"
"I am not a pilsner fan but I did like this one."
"Radeberger pils is firm-bodied and flowery, a nice crisp clean beer with no hint of diacetyl as a proper German pils should be. It has a nice balancing bitterness to it, which leaves a lingering tingle on my tongue requiring another imbibation. If my taste buds were not so adulterated by homebrewing with excessive hop levels I might even say it was bit bitter. Radeberger is a fairly dry beer, which helps to accentuate the hop bitterness."
"ng"
"The beer pours with a very clear straw color and a frothy white head, like you expect from a pilsener. The beer itself has a nice earthy and grassy smell, with some nice malt notes. The mouthfeel is rather light, but not watery. Tastewise, this is a very good pilsener, with nice malt flavors and a bit of hops for kick. Enjoyable, and drinkable."
"A nice break away from the other light colored beers. Since not a lot of people know about here at the local beverage store the price is a measly 4 bucks! An even better deal for a great Pils. Cheers!"
"i still prefer the czech versions better (czechvar and rebel especially), but i might revisit this one again."
"This beer pours a clear light strawlike yellow color with a very large white rocky head. The smell is breadlike malt, spicey and earthy. The taste is mild pleasant breadlike malt with ascending spicey hops. The mouthfeel is moderate with a rounded quality to it. Overall a very pleasing smooth bodied beer with a nice bitterness."
"Bright light golden color with a nice pillowy head. Nose is somewhat malty with light grassy hops. Fresh hoppy aroma. Body is spritzy with crispy, leafy hops and a touch of malt. Not a bad pils, although it could stand for a little more malt flavor. Good clean and crisp flavors with a nice hoppy bite in the finish. Better than I expected."

"This crisp Pilsner is shiny straw in color. Though light in malt body, it maintains a refreshing herbal malt flavor. The aroma is lightly malty sweet with hops being the dominant smell. The sharp metallic and citrus hops blend in nicely with the malt which reveals itself further throughout the glass. A hint of herbs and lemon can be detected. Nice white head lasts awhile and leaves behind a nice lace. Bright and clean finish."
"Good beer, worthy of atleast 2 a night.."
"A very impressive brew, colour is a very light golden hue, almost clear....This pilsner starts with a hoppy bitterness then switches to a minor malty sweetness that sticks around. Well carbonated, with a nice crown. After taste is very pleasant, a little to sweet, but not by much.....This 3 pack came with a mini mug....Bonus...."
"Radeberger:  A Pilsner from Germany.  A yellow beer, with a pure white head.  The aroma is a little unusual for the style, as it seems to have a prominent aroma of caramel malts, with a hint of skunk.  It seems as if the hops are initially present, and then the beer rounds out with very nice and favorable malts.  Very smooth, and easy to drink with a clean aftertaste that leaves a hint of the malts.  To top it off, it was on sale, and the nice sample lady gave me a free pilsner glass to enjoy it with."
"Notes: An easy to drink traditional German Pils, clean and quick. A very refreshing light session beer. Surely a step or two above St. Pauli Girl and Beck’s. Could make for a most excellent fall back beer to have in the fridge year round."
"Easy drinking ... with some character."
