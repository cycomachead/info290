"Overall: I'm trying to think when I last had beer from a can and I honestly can't remember. What I do know is that it wasn't nearly as good as this. Cans seem to be making a comeback and if this is typical of a canned craft beer then bring it on. Calling this a proper pils is probably wide of the mark, but as an American interpretation of same it more than stands on its own merits. Well worth tracking down - it'd make a superb summer drink."

"My beer guru picked up a variety pack of Skyfox and this is one off the ones he left for me. No recommendation one way or the other so Not sure what to expect. Decent looking beer for a pils. Surprising taste, as a non fan of pils, I actually enjoyed this one. I have a couple more of Skyfox and I now have a little expectations. Good beer."
""
"Overall - Its a fine beer. Not the best flavor profile representative of the style, but is still a good summer brew and enjoyable."
"A hoppy and refreshing pilsner. Would drink this again."

"O: A really fine German pils with a nice bready, crackery malt character and good dose of bitterness from noble hopping."
""
"Nice - a tasty pilsner with good depth. It looks superb (perhaps enhanced by the glass), while the aroma and flavour have subtle hop and malt notes that balance perfectly. Good body. A great little brew - crisp and refreshing. Well worth grabbing if you come across it."

"O: This was really quite tasty. I'm not sure the higher hop presence is appropriate to style, but I really enjoyed it. Maybe my favorite Pilsner I've had."
"This is a soft, mellow take o the Pilsner style, and it's yet another example of an American craft brew that, if it ever saw mass marketing, would likely be widely enjoyed by the mass public. (Philadelphia Brewing's Kenziger strikes me as another example of this.) I would not posit this as my go-to for the style, but it ain't bad at all, and I think would session extremely well. Also a good pick to introduce a conservative friend to craft beer -- shouldn't be that far out of anyone's comfort zone. Mildly recommendable."
"This is a real interesting take, Czech added hops with German ingredients to boot. Came out with a nice contrast and very enjoyable."

"Decent thickness but could be thicker. VERY disappointing."
"pale yellow color, slightly hazy. thin bright white head. grassy earthy aroma. mild flavor, slight corn/grain taste and mild earthy hops. thin body, medium carbonation. easy drinking. not my favorite style, but easy drinking summer beer."
""
"Not a bad pilsener at all. It has a great light and refreshing taste that goes down very easily and would make a great session beer."
""
"D/O- The orange pithy aftertaste would make me keep coming back if this were available to me all the time. Highly drinkable. As is, it will stay on my ""wants"" list in hopes for another try in the future. Well received by this dude and recommended to pils fans. Thanks a ton to PAbeerdude for getting me a couple cans of this long time want!"
""
"O - I enjoyed this brew on a hot, almost-summer day and would be glad to have it again."

"A great pils, one of the better I have had. I normally don't session pilsners, but this is one worth sessioning for sure."
""
""
"On draft at The Pony Bar. The beer appears clear and pale golden with a thin white collar. The aroma brings floral hops and grain. The taste follows suit. Nicely balanced with a lovely hop finish. I may need to get another round of this. I love a good pilsner."
""
""
"A good pilsener."
"Overall it is light and crisp, refreshing and extremely easy to drink. Definite session beer and perfect for the summer, I liked it a lot and thought it was a great American representation of this style."

"Pours a transparent golden yellow with a thin bubbly head. The nose is great, light vienna malts, hints of bread and dough with a floral perfumy hop and light note of grass. The taste has vienna and pale malts, lightly toasted bread with hints of dough. The hop balance adds perfumy hops and some light grassy notes with a touch of resigny hop in the back. The body is thicker and a touch viscous with a nice carbonation. Very tasty but a little on the heavy side for a pilsner."
""
"Overalll: A very nice flavor profile that goes great with excellent drinkability. This is the first brew i've tried by Sly Fox and i'd sure like to see what else they have."
"O: A great craft pils. One of my new favorites. Glad that this is local beer as I'll surely be having more."
""
""
"O: Great drinkability, and its in a can so its great for summer."
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing and drinkable brew and I could easily have another without hesitation. As I have in the past I'll continue to include this beer in its rotation along with some of the other favorite Pils style beers so there is no question I'll be having this beer again."

"O- Very refrsehing, nice flavor. This is a very good beer. I wish someone in Quebec would make something similar to this (and others like Prima Pils). You got a Heineken loving friend? Have him try this. Help him understand what his beer drinking life could be like."
"O: The beer has some crisp refreshing properties and would be a good aperitif or accompaniment with food."
"12oz. can courtesy of Soonami. Served in my SA Noble Hops Pilsener glass. Pours the color of straw with a translucent clarity and a creamy 1.5 inch, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid, 1/8th inch skim with textured clumps of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Great nose - clean, grassy and a trace of cereal grain sweetness. Taste expresses noble hops, citrus, cereal grains, a bit of skunk and a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a crisp carbonation and a light acidity from sip to swallow. All and all, a solid Pilsener in my humble opinion. Generally not a go to style for me, but I would drink this regularly if I had regular access."
"A good entry to the pilsner category. It doesn't have the softness that I associate with this style. The hop bitterness, in particular, is more harsh than one would expect."
"O - A very refreshing offering, and a great choice for the summer!"
"Morey's Bottom Liine: Definitely not a classic example of the style, but it's a nice American twist on a fairly predictable style. Almost taste like a Pale Ale. Normally I can tell a Lager from an Ale with incredible ease, but this one's a little tough."
"O: I'm not a huge pilsner guy but I enjoyed this. Very drinkable and would go good with fried foods. Also good for grilling or a hot day."
"O: This is a really enjoyable Pilsner and in a can! I would certainly pick this up for summer parties as it is very easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"Poured a light pale yellow color, with a large foamy white head. Lots of foam and head retention, great retention leaving lots of sticky lace. Smell was light, but had nice aroma of lemon citrus and grass hop flavors. The taste was just very good, smooth, and refreshing. Actually had lots of hop character, slight pine and grapefruit. Dry, clean finish. Very good example of this classic german style. To steal a line from Woody's CANquest - I would have lots of these in my virtual cooler for the summer months."
"O: If you can't tell, I like this. Really like it. I'd been stuck in BMC hell when it came to canned beer. Now that I have choices, wow. Sly Fox is on my radar now and has made my ""hit list"" with a traditional-style German Pilsner in a can of all things. I used to have to get swill in the can, but with the ""Oscar Revolution"" as I refer to it, everything is changing. This will be my summer ""crush'em and recycle'em"" beer from here on out if I can keep getting it."
"Drinkability â€“ Not the worst beer I ever had. Not really impressive though. The bitter finish is less than pleasant and lingers. Perhaps the fact that is came in a can has something to do with this?"
"The flavor is that of a well-built pilsner with dry malt notes, mineral water, and grassy hop bitterness. Pikeland could stand to turn down the IBU's just a touch, but that is a minor nit-pick. Crisp carbonation level with big bubbles that roll across the palate. Sharp, drying finish leaves bitter grass notes on the back of the palate. Overall, a tasty beer from Sly Fox and one I would gladly reach for again if given the chance."
"Ample dry hop bitterness, floral and very grassy in the finish. Dry lingering grass notes really hang on, noticeable a minute or two after taking a sip. Some cracker and white bread in the middle balance things out. Moderate carbonation, low enough to suggest German/Euro style origins. Body is light and quenching, seems like a good warm weather session beer. Thanks Mike!"
"D: Very drinkable and smooth a good tasteing beer and I always worry when it comes to canned beer, old stereotypes are hard to break."
"D: While I'm not a huge pilsner fan this is much better than some of the other versions out there I've had. Definitely better than a BMC option..."
"In this one, though, the yeast isn't integrated enough with the rest of the flavors and competes and drowns out what should be clean, crisp and refreshing. I drank it, and I didn't dislike it, but it just didn't work out."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it had some nice balance and flavors to it. It was clean and crisp and a nice version of the style."
"d- good, not the best pils i've ever had but this is very drinkable and affordable at that. i'd pick this up for any event i couldn't bring glass bottles."
"A bit fuller and hoppier than a real German Pils. Second place behind Prima (but ahead of Sunshine) among hopped-up American versions of the style."
"Mouthfeel is light, effervescent, tiny bubbles, no stickiness at all. Very easy to drink far too quickly; have to remember to sit back and enjoy!"
"D: This would be a great all night beer when hanging out and watching football. Flavorful enough to keep me coming back but not so much so that it becomes overwhelming. Truly a beautiful simple beer. Nicely done."
"Good drink."
"One of my favorite pilsners. Maybe not spot-on to style, but tasty nonetheless. Pours golden/yellow with a rocky off white head. Lemony citrus nose with some grassy undertones. Palate is unique and tasty. Cracker malts have good balance from a strong bitter bite. Finish not as clean and crisp as it could be. Drinkability is high from start to finish. Traditional or not, this is a worthy pils."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day if this were available here. On tap this is one of the cleanest and freshest tasting beers I have had. This one is a perfect session ale. Great for the style."
"Drinkability is really where this beer shines I think. It goes down in gulps and the levels are such that I don't think you could ever get sick of it. Great job."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a magnificent and quickly proliferating thick white head that eventually breaks apart in shifts; leaving prolific arcs of lace behind. Smells lemony with a bit of malty sweetness, some dry hay, and a bit of spice. Initial notes of lemon and orange float on the palate with a some resinous hops resting underneath. A bit of graininess exists, along with some orange peel. This tasty brew is dry on the edges and creamy in the middle which makes for some kickass drinking. If I could find this beer locally I would definitely have found my new favorite session brew."
"The beer pours a clear, light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get some bready malt, along with some grassy hops. The flavor is pilsener malt, grassy hops and a medium amount of bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice German pilsener."
"Straw yellow with one finger of white head that had good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Herbal, grassy hops dominate the aroma. This seems to be a very hoppy pilsener from the aroma. And so it is in flavor as well. All 44 IBUs can be tasted. Very herbal and grassy that made the first sip a bit of a surprise. It seems to get tamer the deeper in the glass I get. The malt is dry and cracker like. Light body with abundant carbonation that stops short of being harsh. Just like a pilsener should be. A light, dry pilsner that has more hops than just about any other beer of this style I have encountered."
"D - It's a pretty average German pilsener, with some ups and downs. I'll probably forget all about tomorrow."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet maltiness and a small hop presence. In the taste, a clean, sweet malt and a nice Bavarian hop. A small bite and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry Bavarian hop aftertaste. Refreshing and clean, somewhat like a standard pils."
"With all that hop jazz going on, you'd think it'd drink like an IPA, however, the malt meat is light and distinctive pilsner essences are found underneath. The elements are balanced fairly well, overall, as the beer bursts with flavor. An accessible and interesting twist on the style."
"D: Here is where I think this shines the most. Very clean, dry with the grains being the highlight of the drink with just enough hop indication to be appreciable to those who like an added punch to their pils (maybe not so much as victorys prima) but still a nice compliment. Exceptionally smooth going down, and down and down. Keg worthy."
"D: Seems like this one has been getting some hate lately, but I really quite enjoyed it. A nice flavorful and easy to drink pils."
"The taste really showcases a punch of herbal hops right off the bat and I am still getting this mild rubber aspect that is not altogether displeasing, but I am sure it is from the hops. Malts are very light and I would not be surprised to learn that no specialty malts were used in this beer. Hop bitterness and flavor are about equal and the finish is quite dry. Good pilsner, PA folks are lucky to have so many."
"Poured from 12 oz can into my pint class. Forms a very high head that sticks for a few minutes and slowly fades away. Satisfactory lacing, but nothing spectacular. The color is a clear and light orange and only slight carbonation. The smell initially reminded me of the BMCs, but after the head subsided I was able to get a whiff of pleasant malt and some sweetness. Slightly bitter, I taste none of the malt and sweetness that I got from the smell, just the bitterness. very thin on the palate and almost no aftertaste this beer is only slightly a cut above a Miller Genuine draft. I've had other sly fox beers and expected a lot more from this one. I could probably drink a ton of these, as my drink of choice for beer pong."
"D: Pretty tasty, and easy to down, but overall lacking in effort."
"D - Drinks very nicely. Crisp and refreshing."
"This is a pretty pils. No aroma, that really hurts, but other than that another great addition to the American Craft Pils scene. A darker blonde, pils clear, head reataining spritzer. A bit thick and oily, hop resiny center, dry spicey hop finish. Lingering light bitterness and toungue popping dryness. Roundabout lacing rides the glass, a touch of Urquell in the nose, and a simple yet elegant malt approach. I like it. Im glad to see another top notch pils around town. Shyfox, I salute you."
"Taste is quite tame as well, it's got some light sulfur that's refreshing and sweet. Light hoppiness is really good. Overall it's a great beer for the style."
"D - you could tell the effort was good, just didnt really follow through. about one (modest) step above any BMC offering. only went down somewhat quickly to get to something different."
"D: A very nice session beer (if I'm allowed to use that here these days). This is probably my second favorite American pils (just behind Prima Pils). This is well worth seeking out."
"The closest thing, along with Victory Prima Pils, to the real German pilsners. Nothing can really match the originals or the freshness when had on tap in Germany. But the Pikeland Pils is really good. Pretty darn authentic."
"D: Drinkability is high even for style."
"Easy to drink. Extremely sessionable. I wouldn't put this up with Prima Pils from Victory but its a good stab at the style."
"D: I really love it when an American brewery nails this style. This is a great example of the pils, and you don't have to pay for it to be imported!"
"Pretty drinkable, yet another solid pils from PA."
"D - easy drinker and crisp flavors make it a sure bet"
"Overall, a nice Pils and I will definitely revisit this one."
"Very easy drinking. Goes down quickly."
"D - They almost don't get more drinkable than this, but the noted carbonation is the only thing stopping me from gulping this brew down. Very, very nice. Lives up to the Pa. hype."
"I usually do not expect a whole lot from pilseners but this beer really blew me away. Like the other offerings I have tried from Sly Fox, Pikeland Pils was amazingly flavorful and remarkably drinkable. Well done."
"And just as I finish gushing about the nice, warm weather, the heavens open up and unleash a couple huge claps of thunder. Oh well. Pikeland Pils goes well with thunderstorms too."
"Pours a pale straw color with hints of honey, with a nice and fluffy pure white head. Seems to be a shade darker than most Pils. The aroma is of pale malts, a bit bready, and light grassy hops, a touch sweeter than expected. The taste seems to be spot on for a German Pils. A light cracker like malt, with some bitter stale grassy noble hops, a bit metallic and hints of honey. Seems to be more bitter than most Pils and dry, perhaps this is a take on the Northern German Pils, like Jever. A solid body, holds well on the palate, very dry with a bitter finish; typical pils. A nice example of the style, dryer and a tad more bitter than most. Gets a plus for being in a can. Recommended."
"Goes down easy."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, even taking into account that this is a rather basic and understated beer style, this beer just didn't do anything for me."
"D: Quite an enjoyable brew, the can really fits the image and makes it the perfect BBQ brew. I've had several Sly Fox now and they've all been good experiences, looking forward to trying a few other of their brews. Highly recommended for the summer BBQ season, give it a shot!"
"Could definitely knock several of these back. Nice cans."
"I like this very much. It's quite hoppy, and the can I'm drinking is less than a month from it's best by date, which tells me that it's probably even hoppier fresh. It took me a long time to come to this beer but I will certainly be coming back for more."
"Overall a very tasty brew that fits it's style well. A nice light body with a mild ABV that give this brew an easy drinkability and a very sessionable one at that. And it comes in a can which makes it poolside friendly."
"Mouthfeel is light in body, bit dry, crisply carbonated, but not too much so. Nicely done."
"Poured a super clear golden yellow color. The frothy white head was chunky and uneven. Smell is full of tasty bitterings hop and a surprisingly sweet light malt aroma. Refreshing and fairly light, perfect for a session. Taste is biscuity. Hop flavor is earthy and peppery. This is an excellently balanced pils. Feel is moderate to light with a slick stickiness. Perfect for a long can session!"
"Now all I need is a 6 pack!"
"Overall a great pilsner that if I had easy access to it I would buy it more often but I'm not going to waste a trade trying to get it."
"D: This would be very serviceable as a go-to beer for summer sessioning. Perfect for cooking out...or whatever. Nice!"
"drinkability is good. pretty good balance, though the bitterness feels a touch high. light and refreshing. this would be a great summer beer."
"D - A german pilsner should certainly have some staying power and this is a type of beer I could be drinking pint after pint. Nice balance of flavors, a crisp enough bitterness combined with a pleasing dry finish help render this beer's fantastic drinkability."
"Sly Fox Pikeland Pils is a very clear, straw colored beer with a thin white head that fades pretty rapidly. The aroma is soft, fruity and wooden. There may be a note of lemon. It is thin, crisp and dry on the palate. The bitterness is nice. It tastes fresh, fruity, wooden and resiny. Pretty darn good for a pilsner in a can."
"drinkability: high"
"Pours a very transparent yellow color with a large, slightly sticky white head. Standard nose of grassy hop bitterness and subtle pale malts with looming aromas of machine funk. The hop character is definitely dominant in the nose, but instead of a fresh hop blast, im getting more of a stale hop dud. The pale malt semi structure falls a bit thin and out of balance, the body is thin and the carbonation is bright. The largest downer to this beer is the overly bitter and plant-like aftertaste. I do not recommend."
"D: great pils, I really enjoyed this one, especially with the higher IBUs and advanced hop character. not my style of choice, but this was really good."
"I really enjoyed this German Pils from Sly Fox. A nice drinker in a nice looking can."
"Pours a light-golden color, with a very sturdy looking two-finger head, fades slowly into a 1/4"" layer of foam, and leaves behind thick sheets of lacing. Lots of pungent hop aroma, slightly floral/herbal. Very clean tasting beer, slightly bready tasting through the middle, but very hop-forward beer, aspirin-like hoppy bitterness. Crisp as hell, refreshing, and with a ton of lingering bitterness. This is nice, glad I got the chance."
"Nice overall but a bit less hops would be more to my liking."
"Wow. Microbrew in a can. It pours a crisp golden cear with 2 finger head that fades after a few minutes. Lots of citrus hops in the aroma and much more in the taste. Very crisp and very tasty. The mouthfeel was a little creamier than expected. Drinkability very high. It travels well in a can and therefore is allowed in many more places such as festivals and the like. Way to go slyfox. Haven't had that many cans of east coast microbrew. This one is great."
"Pours a golden color with a decent head. Smells of grainy malts and some fruit. Tastes pretty good, just not my style, but I guess right on for the style. Nice bittering hops at the end, finishing slightly dry. A clean and crisp beer for the summertime."
"Overall, a solid pils that I definitely wish I had more of."
"D/O: A great offering from Sly Fox that is bound to please craft and macro drinkers alike. A great summer session beer, and the cans make it easy to take with you on the road. Yet another shining example of a great German Pilsener made in PA."
"Pours a clear gold with a thicker creme head. Nose is clean and extremely mild. A barely noticed sweetness to it. Flavor is smooth and clean. Nice sweet overtone and an earthy back tone. Doesn't really bring much complexity, but it's smooth and east drinking. Good for a hot day or a starter."
"D. A very drinkable Pils, one of my favorites from the style. Glad to try some Sly Fox. Wish I didnt have to pour so much down the drain when it foamed out.."
"Overall it's easy to put one of these down and reminds me a lot of Trumer Pils. An in your face pilsner that is easy to drink and is quite refreshing. Can't wait to crack open my Phoenix Pale Ale tomorrow night!"
"An excellent summertime pilsner."
"Bracing, clean pils hop aroma, with nice maltiness. The crispness and bitterness hit full on start to finish, exceptionally clean and refreashing. Great job, nailed the style. Perfect to anjoy several of these on a warm day. I love that this comes in cans, too, so convenient!!"
"12oz can poured into a pint glass. Clear golden color with 1 finger of dense head that dissipates leaving slight lacing. Earthy hop aroma with a hint of lager yeastiness. Taste is initially sweet with the hop balance coming through in the middle for a nice, crisp, clean, dry finish. Medium-light bodied with great drinkability. Nice session beer; refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Pours a clear light straw yellow with a light two finger white head that quickly descends to a thin whispy layer of bubbles. Not much webbing to speak of. Noble hops and sweet caramel malt in the nose up front. Some buttery biscuits, lemongrass, and a hint of pepper in the nose as well. Decent aroma, but very faint. Taste is a lemon peel up front with a bready malt as well. Very clean hops that leave the mouth fairly dry. Buttery biscuits towards the end with an earth-like hop aftertaste. Light and refreshing body with a lively carbonation. Great summer session beer, I really wish I picked up a six-pack of this instead of a single. If you're looking for a hoppy low abv lager, this is one of the best. I'll defintely be picking up more of this one soon for my next golf outing."
"D: Very easy to drink a ton of this. I need to track down a fresher stash."
"Poured this into a pilsner glass. It pours a nice yellow color with a 1 inch tight, white head that fades and leaves a layer of foam on top of the brew. The smell is typical of a pilsner ( a little malt and a sulphury smell) but it has a noticeable hop presence that is very nice. The taste is just right. You get a nice bit of the traditional sulphury pilsner taste down the middle of the palate and then sweet malt, corn and flavorful hops on the side. Its actually even got a nice mouthfeel for a pils. I could drink this one all summer long, outside in the hot Texas sun. It is extremely refreshing. This is most definitely my favorite Pilsner and I am typically not a fan of the style."
"I like this but there are better pilsners made in our great state.Great job though."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger foamy white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is a good blend/balance of malts/hops, some spicyness, with a touch of caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, slight bitterness/dry, with some spice and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"I really like the flavor and easy drinking combo of this particular brew, this is one that I will be serving if I have a party of beer heathens. Very good stuff, it's superb drinkability and the genuinely good (not superb) flavor. Makes this a big winner in my book."
"Poured a light pale yellow with a huge fizzy white head. I had to actually wait to pour the rest in the glass. Cans give awesome head retention I must say. The head had a nice slow fade and left behind lots of lace. This color was very very bright and had lots of sediment in the bottom. Smell was very light and crisp. Smelled very lively. Nice light lemon and grass flavors, with a hint of yeast and grain. The taste was just great, smooth, big carbonation made it very refreshing. Very very hoppy for a pilsner with a nice pine resin flavor and hints of grapefruit, and pineapple and lemon. Big dry finish that was nice and bitter. This was awesome and really awoke a rekindling of the pilsner. I normally find them a bit bland, but this has renewed my intrest and I look forward to trying some again in the warmer months to come."
"Worth as shot..."
"Drinkability is good. This is a pretty good pilsner. Especially nice to see another good crafted beer coming out of a can."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a good pale and pilsner malt scent along with a mild German hop aroma. It's light and refreshing, but a little sweeter than most. It's not as crisp as a traditional pils. The taste is decent as well. It's got a wonderful hop bitterness along with a solid malt bill. My problem is that it's too hoppy and malty. I like a lighter pils. The hops are a bit too aggressive, IMO. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker, but it's just an above average pils; nothing special."
"A solid, refreshing pilsener. Overall - what a good pilsener should be and a very good example of the style."
"Feel is fizzy but smooth at the swallow. The feel is the best part of the beer. It's actually as it warms up, but not great overall. It's a rather musty pils."
"D: Certainly a beer that is suitable for most any occasion. You can drink this all day and night."
"Finish is long, refreshing and dry. Shows off a very nice balance between the sweet malts and herbal-like hops. Quite easy goinÂ’ down and enjoying a few of these would be no problem ."

"Crazy check--I seem to be right on or the low side compared to other reviews. Several noted the hoppy character for the style, which is nice, but the smell and the fact that the taste suffers after warming even for a short time keep me from pushing the score higher. My ratings of Sly Fox are always higher on site when I've been there, so might try this one there next trip to compare on draft."
"D - a poor match with my dinner but a pleasant enough brew for the summer."
"D: This is baseball tailgating beer. Not too strong, but very easy to put down three or four or more before you go to the game. The cans really make this a portable beer as well."
"Nothing is as pronounced in the taste with the exception of the nip from the leafy, dry hops. A seltzery texture, just a twinge on the way down; easy as water. Just a good classic & simple pils longing to be stowed away on a long trip to the beach. With the recent price increase, I guess $8.50 is decent for a sixer. Something like $7.49 would be perfect. :)"
"Thanks again, Todd."
"Drinkability/Notes: I don't know what is about Pa and Pilsners but these guys seem to dominate the domestic craft beer pils style and Pikeland Pils is right near the top. Everything I want in a pils. Crisp, clean, and dry in the finish with a strong hop presence. Super drinkable, would easily make a great session beer especially during the summer months when you want something that is light but full flavored. Right up there with Prima Pils and Sunshine Pils. Now only if there distribution was wider, plus the cans are an added bonus. Highly recommended seek and enjoy. Glad I'm heading up to Pa in a month so I can re-stock."
"And LETS GO REDWINGS!"
"Pours a clear yellow/gold, thin white head forms, some nice lacing, decent retention, keeps a nice layer. Smell is sweet, caramel, citrus and floral hops, very fragrant, bit of vanilla, I like. Taste is sweet, some malts, honey, citrus, bit of floral, but very watery, iron and light bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and light bodied, low carbonation. Refreshing but a bit thin. Thanks Jay!"
"Great summer beer! A well made, nicely balanced pils."
"First time that I have seen this at my normal beer stop so decided to pick up their PilÂ’s offering. Brew poured from the can to a clear light golden color, maybe more yellow with a medium sized white head that had some retention which left some lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma is very nice, has a snap to it which I would imagine come from Saaz hops. While the hop note is the most noticeable I am also able to pick up a doughy/biscuit sweet scent. The taste is nice, very fresh feel, highlighting grass, slightly citrus with a biscuit malt taste, though that seemed to be more evident in the aroma. Over all this is a very nice Pils, one that I will get again during the summer months. I think it is a bonus that it is in a can since it is such a good drinking beer, will be great for those summer excursions."
"Pours a hazy yellowy gold, effervescent, with a big fluffy white head that slowly recedes and laces on the way. Aroma is a nice clean lemony sweetness, not a tart lemon but a soft sweetness, slightly grainy, and grassy as well. Light soft lemony sweetness hits up front in the taste, a rubber and grassy bitter hoppiness comes in midway and lingers into the dry finish. Light to medium in body, not extremely crisp, but a small amount of pepperiness and a good sized dryness in the finish. Very nice clean tasting beer, highly sessionable and being packaged in a can could make this an ideal summer camping beer."
"Big thanks go out to Nutbrown for this sample!"
"Drinkability- A bit more hoppy than the usual pils I like, but this is one of the most flavorful ones I have had. Very tasty and quenching. I was a bit hesitant going into this after my fist beer from Sly Fox (Pale Ale...bleach!), but this one impressed me."
"Into a pint glass, pours a very hazy grassy yellow, waaay too much head, but man it was lovely, fades away after quite a while, lacing in mounds, sheets, heaps, and traces, all kinds of stuff going on. Aroma is full of grassy, herbal Noble hops, a little bit of malt, pretty decent. Taste is better, the Noble hops are done better, balance is better, citrus is nicer, grassy herbal hop tones are nice, but also a little metallic twang to it that was a little distracting. Mouth is good and carbonation is high, and overall, its just a pretty good and drinkable beer."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks Dr.Jay for bringing up.Good small head on lighter yellow. A nice bitterness and drinkability at 44 IBU. Clean and fresh and refreshing. Unfiltered gives it a cloudiness and a tad complexity to the aroma more than the flavour.Carbonation about right."
"drinkability is affected negatively by the taste bud mugging, but it's light and fizzy enough to create a party in the oral cavity. not one of their worst beers by any means, but not something i'll bust my ass to get. glad i tried it."
"Could knock back a few of these especially during the summer months. A very good pilsener."
"D: So easy to drink, an excellent pilsner."
"$8 for a 6 pack at Whole Foods in Manhattan? Yeah, I went for it. And I'd do it again! Pretty solid stuff. Pretty flavorful and overall pretty easy to drink... just not as drinkable as other examples of the style."
"This pils poured a clear, gold color with white foam that settled and coated the inside of the glass. The smell was bready malt with noble hops, a very German pils aroma. The taste was bready malt and noble floral hops with mild hop bitterness. A good lager flavor overall. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The hops lingered nicely in the aftertaste. This was a very, very good and enjoyable German pils."
"I've heard people recommend this to beer noobs, but I dont think I'd do the same. The flavor is really all in the bitterness, so if you're not into that, tough."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 3/4"" eggshell head over the slightly cloudy light golden (yellow?) brew. Head froths down at a reasonable rate, with ample delicate lacing. Aroma is sweet pale, maybe a bit chalky, with a bit of a hops tinge. Flavor is also sweet to start, but mostly defined by an amorphous bitterness that fills the mouth, and closes chalky. Mouthfeel doesn't do much for me, but there's not much debate that if you like it, you could keep on drinking it. Still a better can option than swill, easily."
"Light wheat color, with a slight head, white with a touch of lacing. Some spicy malt (marzen) in the nose, tiny little bit of green hops as well. The taste is totally hop forward, not IPA huge, but still announcing its presence with authority. Finishes slightly bitter and lingering, but also really refreshing. Good session beer."
"Nice blonde color, a little hazy, but not much head retention, although not bad for a pilsner. Light smell of clean German hops, nothing outstanding or overpowering but very nice in a subdued way. Taste is a mix of citrusy hops, with a twinge of honey sweetness. Tart, lip-smacking bitterness. I could probably have quite a few of these. I'm not an expert on Pils, but this is a very nice, refreshing little beverage."
"Overall a nice quaffable pils. Authentic to the style."
"Poured into a pint glass,A white creamy head,a little on the thin side.A light gold,straw color.The head dissapated fariley quickly.A fruity,slightly bready aroma.Not real aromamatic.A clean taste,slightly grainey.A light mouthfeel,A tart,tingly,with a citrusy hop finish.A light bodied,very drinkable,session beer.Not a real flavorful brew,not a bad brew either.Would be a good summertime tailgate party beer,were bottles are not permitted."
"Thanks to ggaughan for DFH bocce weekend trade."
"D: Very drinkable, even with the restrained hop character. Good for a lazy summer beach day."
"This poured with a huge, fluffy, off-white head that threatened to spill over the sides of the glass before settlling back down. The color was a slightly cloudy lemon-yellow and the nose was absolutely fragrant with Saaz hops. The mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant bitterness on the palate. On the finish, I noticed a brief malt sweetness, followed closely by the return of the same bitterness noted before. It was the hops that really lingered. The relatively low ABV makes it a highly drinkable beer, especially as an alternative to hefeweizens on a hot day."
"This one was on NolanGTI."
"Clearly labeled on the can that this was produced and canned at the Royersford locale so here it goes after stopping in at Mad Mex looking for some Sly Fox draft products I saw the beer list that said Sly Fox cans ""New"" and I was like I take one of each for eight bucks...ouch!!! I wanted to taste the can product before diving into a case so here it goes...appears a crystal clear pale golden hue forms a rocky large white head leaves magnificant fine even layers of lacing done my pint glass. Aroma is full of noble Saaz galore...very hoppy aromatic herbally goodness with biscuit mineral malt character very nice mix of tones coming to my senses. Taste is slightly grassy with a mix of citrus peels in there as well mineral water with all of the herbal hops and light toasted malts bring a biscuit crisp mild sweetness but overall this canned product finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is light bodied by no means though is this one thin or watery crisp carbonation capable of tickling the back of the throat but not overly bitey very smooth on the palate. Drinkability...what can be said some one has brewed an incredibly tasty and drinkable pils and offered in cans thank the beer gods for those guys out in the philly suburbs. Oh yeah and if your interested and I went along and picked up a case for 25 bucks great investment you'll love the packaging little mini cases each with 12 cans...cute."
"This one was alright. I've enjoyed the Sly Fox bottled brews quite a bit but have been somewhat underwhelmed by their canned offerings thusfar."
