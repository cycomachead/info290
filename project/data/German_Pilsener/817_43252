A bright golden amber color with a decent dose of creamy white head, I get a pleasing, assertive but not aggressive aroma of fresh bread, grain husks, some fruity esters that almost grade into orange-like citrus, apple, and faint sulfur that recalls coconut flakes along with noble hop grassy and spice notes (dare I say cinnamon). Palate largely mirrors this, if a little more rough around the edges, some grain husk and darker than usual malts that almost enter nutty territory for a moment, a yogurt-like lactic tartness, slight vinous character, and a moderate degree of carbonation for the style. Nice body that has a bit more substance than the average macro-brewed pilsener. Finishes crisp but also rather bready. Nice hop aroma and flavor throughout. Quite a lot is going on here and this is one of my favorite continental pilseners, relatively easy to track down and with an almost ale-like fruitiness that makes it stand out from the pack.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 23, 2014"

An excellent looking pilsner. Scents of crisp lager yeast, grainy malt and flowery hops. A very crisp and clean aroma, a nice classic pilsner scent. Flavor begins with a crisp combination of herbal and floral Noble hops and some nice grainy malt. Moves into more herbal and floral flavors, some more dry grainy flavors and a slight hint of sweet pilsner malt. Finishes dry with a nice hit of floral and herbal Noble hop flavors. Aftertaste is floral and herbal Noble hops. A very nice, simple, one-note, clean flavor profile, just like a pilsner should be. It is refreshing and pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a semi-drying feel. A good, crisp, clean and refreshing mouthfeel. Very true to style. Overall this is an excellent German Pilsner. It is crisp and clean in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel, as the style should be. It isn't complex at all, but for this style that is a good thing, and for a nice refreshing lager it is amazingly well done.","Auraan","Apr 22, 2014"

I did drink it straight out of the bottle, but it was a very cool commemorative 2013 holiday bottle. As soon as it was opened, a half inch of large bubbled foam appeared on top of the beer. The smell was actually quite pleasant; strong piney-hop smell. The taste of this beer is pretty standard for a pils; if anything it is a bit on the weak side, but I do appreciate that it is less harsh in the mouth than many other brews in the style. Overall, I would say that as far as pils go, this is a solid choice and very drinkable, but there are many superior Austrian brews to choose from.","bamberger603","Nov 28, 2013"

The body had some heft, supported by moderate carbonation and an off-dry finish making for an enjoyable, drinkable texture. Not bad overall.

The taste holds notes of light grass, flowers, wheat, light banana, and green apple flesh. I'm actually a little surprised at the fruitiness here.

Grassy, spicy aroma, quite hoppy with a clean lager yeast character behind the hops. Pils malt is faintly noticeable. Noble hops are strong on the palate, lending a big kick of spicy, herbal and grassy flavors. The malt base is light and dry, while the finish is strongly bitter and lingering, somewhat mineral.

Drinks very easy too, it's clean on the tongue and very refreshing. Mouthfeel is also good, it's quite crisp.

Taste is grassy and bready up front with some very nice buttery notes giving way to a dry, slightly bitter hop finish with some subtle caramel on the linger.

Mouthfeel is typical of the style - light to medium bodied and very crisp with quite a tingly, spicy carbonation hit mid-sip and a very clean finish.

The noble hops are on full display. Earth, herbal, pepper, and floral elements from the hops. No malt comes through in the aroma. The hops dominate the flavor as well.

There is somewhat of a sharp malt flavor, grassy notes, with a touch of spicy hops which is nice. Finishes crisp with a fuller mouthfeel than expected. Anytime I see the words ""malt liquor"" on a bottle I get flashbacks but overall this beer is decent albeit a bit middle of the road.

Carbonation has fine bubbles streaming upward from the bottom of my 16 oz Gordon Biersch glass. Head forms thick and dwindles down leaving behind even thin lacing with each sip. Labeled a pils but definitely hits more along the lines of a Euro lager or pils than a German or Czech style. Aromatic starts off with a snappy skunky hop flow with grapefruit peel Saaz and herbal tones galore, light pale malt doesn't offer much sweetness here. Only clean mineral water notes with a touch of metallic character coming across my senses. Flavor wise this beer is clean with a crisp bitterness and dry finish, definitely a mass produced Austrian beer. Herbal skunk weed hop notes run rampant I can't even say pure Saaz here more cluster hops than crisp classic Noble hop flavors. Bone dry on the mouthfeel carbonation is crisp carries this light bodied pils well, but this just can't compete with the likes of Penn Kaiser Pils, Troeg's Sunshine Pils, or Stoudt's Pils.
