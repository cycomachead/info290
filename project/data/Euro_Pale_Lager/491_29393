Fresh nose, almost akin to mineral water, dry presence, dried orange peels, doesn't appear either distinctly malty nor hoppy. Medium-bodied, sort of toasty but this fades into vague citrus and straw, hay and corn notes. Almost suggests raw breadiness. Smoothness one of its major attributes.

Aroma is slightly corny with a nonspecific fruity aroma. Taste is about what you would expect for a pale lager. It's slightly corny with a mildly bitter after flavor. It doesn't present a hoppy bitterness, but just a slightly bitter aftertaste but nothing off putting. Mouthfeel is average and highly carbonated. Coopers Premium Lager is definitely a yard beer.

3.66,15.1,4,3,4,4,3.5,"the best part about this beer is the way it looks in the glass. pours like a picture. very nice. the smell is kind of what you'd expect from a euro lager, except a little cleaner tasting. comparing this to other beers that shall remain nameless in their green bottles, this is damn tasty. you really have to rate on style here and style-wise this is pretty good. i'd never really seen this beer before so i wasn't too sure on it's rep but i'd try it again if i was in the mood for the style.","scarletfire79","Jul 09, 2007"
4,25.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a crisp, clean, and refreshing pale malt scent that along with light fruity yeast esters. The taste is good also. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and refreshes. It's clean in the finish along with some light hops as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking lager and probably the best beer I've had from these guys. It's nothing special, but it does the trick.","WesWes","Jun 06, 2007"
3.45,8.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a clear yellow with a ½ inch rocky head. The aroma is mostly of hops with slight malt sweetness evident. The taste is bitter and sweet from the malt. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied - crisp. Overall, this is a refreshing lager that Id definitely consider drinkable.","barefootbrewer","Jun 01, 2007"
3.33,4.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall Impression: A well executed lager. Clean, basic, lacking any real flaws. You could do worse, but so much better.","HardTarget","May 25, 2007"
2.68,-15.7,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Best thing was the pour  lite straw yellow, with a dinky white head on an easy pour, decent head if aggressively poured. Sweet cooked veggies in the aroma, mixed with molasses in the taste. A funky vinous aspect creeps in along the way. Dry and woody in the finish. Ugh beer.","Vancer","May 13, 2007"
2.4,-24.5,3,3,2,3,2,"D: A little tasty, doesnt go down too easily, not very filling, I really didnt like this beer very much and would drink it again if there were much else to choose from.","TheManiacalOne","Apr 08, 2007"

3.18,0,4,3.5,3,3,3,"I don't know what sort of reputation Coopers Brewery Limited has in Australia. If it's good, I doubt that Premium Lager is responsible. As far as I'm concerned, Best Extra Stout is the only one of their beers that warrants a second purchase.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 14, 2007"

1.85,-41.8,4,1.5,2,1.5,1.5,"Not a bad little macro lager, but unchallenging in all aspects. It did pour beautifully with a thick, creamy white head that made the beer look wonderful. Hops utilization was a distinct Pride of Ringwood, but only a tiny amount. If you like Fosters, but want a beer with a little less of the aluminum flavor, then give Coopers a try.","GooberMcNutly","0"
2.83,-11,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Of course it's a drinkable, non offending, easy to have more than one beer. BUT, at $4.25 a bottle? This is not that special. I had this because I wanted to try something different, but at that price I'll force down the big Foster's.","BigRedN","Dec 18, 2006"
3.76,18.2,4,3,4,4,4,"Taste is light as expected from this style, with a predominantly malt taste and a slightly hoppier finish, making for an excellent mouthfeel/experience from start to finish. Very drinkable session beer and overall nice example of a lager.","clparker11","Nov 20, 2006"
3.49,9.7,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Poured from a 12.7 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light yellow, forming a thick 2 inch head, that left very slight lacing on the glass, once it faded. Not much in the nose, but what is detectable, is very much like any of the light lagers from the Big 3. The mouthfeel is light, like a lager should be. The taste is alot better than your average lager, IMHO. Very clean finish, making this an easy beer to session, especially on a hot summer day. I'm not a big drinker of lagers, but this one was very enjoyable.","beeragent","Sep 24, 2006"
3,-5.7,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, small head, not bad lacing around the edge's. Scents of hops, malts, slight yeast, and spices. The taste is hoppy/malty, nice clean finish. Light-Medium body. Not a bad lager at all. Would recommend, but most likely will not buy again.","Wasatch","Mar 27, 2006"
