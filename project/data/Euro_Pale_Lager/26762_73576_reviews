"Great and very smooth beer. On the lighter side but with a good body with it too. The smell and aromas have been average but the taste is phenomenal"

"TASTE: Crisp, smooth, moderate sized body, herbal, assertive bitterness, grainy, dried hay, slightly biscuity, earthy, orange zest, drying hoppy finish"

"I like this beer it's great!!!. I have had lots and lots of different beers, wines and distilled spirits in my travels and having lived in various countries around the world.  This is a beer like the Lager/Pilsen types that I've enjoyed in the Czech Republic, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Hungary. The Micro brew movement in the U.S. is turning out some really world class brews. Cheers mates! and keep up the bleedin' great work!!!!!"

"Overall:  Nothing too complex here.  Just a solid lager with a decent hop bitterness.  Reminds me a lot of Carlsberg or other European lagers without the skunkiness."

"Overall this is a drinkable lager but not exceptional. A good example to be sure, but not my favorite either. I recommend trying it and seeing if it is to your liking."

"GREAT PRICES THOUGH HERE IN HOUSTON - $6 a sixer.... Hmm..."
"Nice funky nose, slightly sweet taste, brilliant golden yellow colour, slightly crisp hop bite in the after taste. Very nicely done indeed."

"Aside from the fact that I am thrilled beers like this are finally being brewed in Texas on a larger scale, this is just a damn fine beer. Not fancy, but clean and refreshing and very very drinkable. I don't brew myself, but I've always heard that lagers are harder to brew with consistency. Karbach has obviously figured things out. I really like this beer. Cheers."

"Overall- Judging based on the EPL's I've had in Europe in the past, this is far too full bodied, sweet and sticky for my tastes. If I'm going to drink an EPL while traveling or mowing the lawn, I'd want something with lighter body and crisper, more refreshing mouthfeel."

"I did a quick review on this gem awhile back. Got a bad habit of being lazy and not doing write ups. For some reason I have passed this beer up for the last 4 months since I first seen it sitting along side it's counterpart brews from Karbach. This is one of the finest lagers available. I picked up a six'er at HEB. I like cans, they are the next thing in craft beer, stays fresh and gets cold fast. This beer taste like a lager should. Clean, crisp and refreshing with a nice balance. Good lacing if poured. The can taste great as is. Maybe a good BBQ beer, beach beer? You decide. Don't be afraid to try this one. I'm happy with it. Support Texas breweries!"

"Highly recommended. I'm getting more impressed with Karbach's beers each time I try a new one."

"O: not bad. something different but the color wasn't what I was expecting but that might have been my fault. Even though it might be a bit off the mark I like it better than some other Euro Pale Lagers."
""
""
"Pours a pale light coppery color, thick fluffy white head and loads of lace. Aroma was mild, but, theres crackers and biscuits, light sweetness, and a touch of crassly hops. Taste is much better. Sweet bready notes, biscuits, tinge of caramel sweetness, grassy floral hop notes with the slightest of bitterness. Light bodied, good crisp carbonation, and a refreshing lager. Great lawn owner beer."

"Karbach is doing things. I saw it on tap all over Houston this past weekend."

"a clean golden/orange pour with 2 fingers of detergent-like head. smells of orange, lemongrass, lager yeast, bread. slightly hoppy bitterness up front, then it goes staight to the sweet malty typical lager flavor.. finished off by more earthy bittering notes. one of the hoppiest lagers i've had.... the name suits it well. medium-light body with modest amount of carbonation. sticky on the lips. a great lager.. not one of the best offerings from the brewer, but hey, this is a great gateway beer if you ask me!"
"A cut above most standard lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor profile is butter and biscuit malts. Some bittering hops, but mainly bready type malts. I couldn't drink a lot of this. It was just a really bad lager. I like the other stuff they make, but this I couldn't handle."

"O: a beer that attempts to restore the good name of lagers. I'm not typically a huge lager fan, but this is pretty good."

"Houston - cut me off into space, I'm not coming back. I'll say ""Hi"" to Voyager for you..."
""

"Very foamy mid yellow bodied lager. Nothing interesting in aroma department. Mid mouth feel, decent drinkability despite slight acidic edge in finish. Always giving a lager an even break. Decent malting, not sweet, some spiciness. Not bad, and Vienna is a style I can like."

"Another of a seemingly endless supply of canned beers from woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is malts, grains, some hops at the finish, sweetness from the smell is missing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
""
"O - this was quite a surprise, I had asked for it because I've been looking for a good Lager and was not dissapointed, this is a tasty beer with a degree of complexity I was not initially expecting. Kudos to Karbach you're doing the style and state of Texas proud!"

"From Karbach Street to Chez Woody, I began with a standard Crack, followed by an inverted Glug, resulting in cascading action at the juncture between liquid and foam. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. The tawny head was massive and lasting and resembled the top of an ice cream cone. Nose was pleasantly malty and sweet and I am OK with that, especially in a lager, following so many AAL clunkers on The CANQuest (TM) to date. Mouthfeel was medium and the grassy Saaz hops were immediately obvious on the tongue. Finish was dry and moderately bitter and I CAN get behind this! I would take this to the beach or put it in my cooler for Hula in the Coola Day (01 February, annually). Houston, I have no problem with this beer! Bravo to all involved."

"Drink- One of the better lagers. Still cant get into the style."

"A fine, tasty lager. Very easy drinking with noticeable yet well-balanced lager flavorings throughout."
""
""
""
""
"This is actually quite pretty for a lager. Overall a very solid all malt lager, perhaps a bit sharp and somewhat pilsner-like. Good amount of taste. Goes amazingly well with soft pretzels and good mustard."
""
""
""
""
"Smooth graininess with a pretty big punch of hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is surprisingly full and rich for this type of lager. Id actually place it more in the American Pale Lager category or maybe a helles as opposed to an Amber/Red lager. There is nothing amber or red about it. Whatever you call it, it is damn tasty. Iâ€™ll be buying this one again, for sure."
"Overall, the hubby and I like it and appreciate it for how big it is for the style. A full flavored, complex lager worth trying. Karbach Brewing Co. continues to impress."

"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Flavors are very floral, yeast, light hoppyness, amber, wheat ""bockiness"" is strong. definitely a lager, not a huge fan of the style, but this is pretty drinkable. Aromas and flavors don't appear to match however."
"O-one of the most flavorful lagers I've had yet. Well done"
"Very enjoyable, and a nice addition to the Houston beer scene. I will continue to drink this again, but I think there are better lagers made in Texas. Karbach blew me away with their first release. Not so much with the others. Still very enjoyable and worth a try."
