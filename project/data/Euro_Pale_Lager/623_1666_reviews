"Straw and grainy aroma. Golden pale body with a thin foaming head. Malty with a touch of caramel sweetness. Faint bitterness."

"Beer not bad I could drink a few"

"Basic european supermarket/industry beer. Not Bad, just a default simple blonde beer."
"i dunno something in this one has always given me a headache..tried it about 6 times over the years in bottles and cans.."
"Definitely not a beer that I would recommand. Alström review is totally accurate"

"Not my favorite. It was an okay beer."

"When your in the mood for a European beer try this."

"It strikes me that this is Poland's answer to Budweiser or MGD, in fact, it shares many of the same characteristics. There is nothing terrible here, but nothing special. It is a very typical Euro Lager. There is less skunk in the nose than some Euro's, but everything else is pretty much what one would expect from this style."

"Pours a golden yellow, very clear, very little head even after an aggressive pour. Head faded to nothing after about 30 seconds, no lacing. Aroma was pretty weak, with some ver slight grainy malt notes, no hop or bitter notes in the smell. Taste was sweet malt and corn with just a touch of bitterness, not much else. As it warmed, I got a bit of a metallic taste - not good. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, but nothing special. Overall, this one's not among the better beers out there, probably won't buy it again."

"I like this beer it has a little bitter taste, It was pretty cheap at Cosco 24 pack of 16.9 oz cans for $20.99. For the money taste and alcohol content this is a winner.  Better than domestic adjunct (corn,rice)  for about the same price. It seams  heavier than most common imports and still has a high  alcohol content ."

"Focused and rich, tastes like sweetened chamomile iced tea. Light gold in color; honey, grainey and hay aromas; Light-bodied and sweetish with medium acidity and a peppery finish."

"Pours a clear golden straw-yellow in color with a thin white head. Some spotty lacing is seen that clings to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of grains, malts and hops with a hint of citrus zest. Pretty much the same for the taste. Does have a slight bitter finish as many of these type of brew style has. Medium bodied and carbonation. Really not a fan of this style of brew."

"330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 10/22/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, pear, cracker, bready grain, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with well balanced pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with weak strength. Taste of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, bready grain, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, bready grain, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid pale lager. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."

"Interesting packaging and design of the bottle although I found the taste to be just average. Since it was moderately priced and a rare find here in Melbourne, I bought it out of curiosity. Will try to find the Porter next time which seems to be more popular."

"Overall, it's not a bad beer, it does feel a tad generic, but it's something I could definitely drink. I would take Zyweic over Heineken, Amstel, Stella, etc not only because it overall I feel is a better beer, but also since it is much cheaper."

"Final Thoughts: This is the kinda beer that makes people flock to Macro lagers, as I can see someone trying it and not ever wanting to try import beer again. It's not very smooth, not very flavorful, and all around not very good. It got the drain a little bit over the half way point, so you'll definitely want to pass on this one."
""
""
""
"O: not bad but not worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Drink it cold and it's an average EPL. Letting it warm shows you its inner demons. Do not let it warm."

"I drank about 400 of these during a recent trip to Poland. Very standard lager, but very refreshing, especially when fresh. Not at all surprising to say it was way better there than the imported bottles I’ve had in the states. Most Polish lagers seem to take on a gasoline aroma when they warm up, but Zywiec’s flavor held - nice light malt character and really drinkable."

"A bubbly, consistent white head with a very bright, very clear straw colour. Faint earthy hop aroma. Mouthfeel is full and dry, medium-carbonated. Taste is very light and crisp, with delicious and subtle hints of corn, green apple, hop and malt - a great balance. Vague acidity and a touch of metalicness but overall an extremely satisfying pale lager experience."
"The body is very light and it's crisp, almost smooth but for a slickness that carries through and tries to transition to a sort of smoothness with little effect."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: Just another pale lager, nothing really stands out. Could probably down a large number of these but I wouldn't really enjoy it. It's alright, if you like the light stuff, here it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good, but certainly nothing terrific. Good, easy drinking lightish beer."
""
"O - Not very pleasant tasting and a little boring in the flavour department. One to try but maybe not to buy again."
""
""
"Zywiec has a thick, white head, a clear, bubbly, straw appearance, and a little bit of lacing left behind. The aroma is pungent, full, and bready. Taste is of bold barley malt and nice, hefty hop spice. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Zywiec finishes crisp, clean, refreshing, and mild. This is just a great beer! I look forward to trying it, again. RJT"

"Date tasted: July 12, 2013... Glassware: Baltika stange... Occasion: waiting for Matt and Jerry to arrive to begin the golf weekend....Appearance: pale, sallow golden body; large bubbles collect and release for the glass's bottom; frothy, soupy uneven white head that leaves uneven tracings... Aroma: odd, pungent doughy malts leave a locker room funk in the nostrils; not thee fresh pilsner hops hoped for... Palate: oily, almost buttery consistency with minimal presence at the teeth; drinkable, yes--this could be a backyard barbecue accompaniment ...Taste: a rather nondescript lager, with little profile and discussable points; almost perfectly rinsing the mouth... Overall: being a parishioner of a Polish church, the Zywiec is a presence at adult functions for sure; the bottle trumpets itself as Poland's #1 beer, but unfortunately Budweiser does similarly in America, and the parallel may be fitting...not bright or crisp, not refreshing enough to garner future interest, this beer files in behind many better, more engaging lagers..."

"What can I say, I like my beer. I had this one for the first time on a whim the other day and was pleasantly surprised. After the first taste out of the bottle, I had to pour it to see what was hiding in the bottle. My wife who generally likes pale ales said she liked it after the first sip. She asked me what it was. ""Well"" I said, ""it looks like a honey ale but has an aftertaste like a lager."" Very nice over all and at least as good as Fisher and three of that of Peroni, without the price."
""
""
""
"Overall – Not a bad brew, but nothing too exceptional. It is rather easy drinking and refreshing but lacks much complexity and is fairly simple overall."
""
""
""

"Zywiec (Gee-vee-ettes) pours a crisp golden color and omits a citrusy lemon zest aroma. The beer itself has a cereal grain taste with a medium to thin body and has a medium bitterness as well. Moderate amounts of noble hops in the flavor profile give this beer a little bit of a spiciness. The beer finishes dry and moderately bitter. Got the beer as a gift from good friends, one of which is from Poland, thus I do not know how to rate this beer by price. For what it is, it is good, but not normally my style."
"Very light colored lager with obvious carbonation. Crisp taste without any depth. Could might as well say Zywiec Light. Crisp initial taste tails off and is replaced by a lighter flavor and carbonation. Could work well in a summer situation as a refresher."
""
""

"Clean dry crisp finish. Probably wouldn;t recommned this one to anyone."

"Nazdrowia! That's how you say cheers in Poland. This is the Polish equivalent of a Bud or Molson Canadian, and it can be found in every bar, in every city, in every Disko, right across Poland. Living there and being a young guy, I was naturally drawn to the social aspect of this beer. Everyone was drinking it between shots of wodka, this was pretty good stuff. The women usually got a couple of pumps of raspberry syrup and drank it from a straw?? Weird, not really my thing. Until I discovered Tyskie and Okocim, this was my go-to/have a fun time/party beer! It pours an average light yellow, smells pretty blah and isn't really something worthy of writing a long review about. So I leave you with this: when in Poland, drink what the Polish drink and that is Zywiec!"

"O-Surprisingly tasty for a macrobrew. Way more character than most domestic American offerings."
"A pretty boring, very average beer, nothing bad, but nothing to get excited about."
""
""
"Light body, but denser than pilsners. The 5.6% alcohol is perceived more than usual. Regular beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An okay lager that didn't quite live up to my expectations based on appearance and smell. Still, it's light, refreshing, and easy drinking."
""

""
""
""

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and a slight skunky aroma. Taste is of malt, grass, and a slightly fruity flavor. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but nothing special for the style."

"Clean as most Central European pale lagers tend to be. And perhaps a bit boring."
""
""

"This has a light, crisp aroma. It’s not a big grassy hop aroma—far from it— but its definitely fresh and vibrant for being what it is. Flavor is decent. Decently fresh, decently crisp, decently…well, decent. Like a macrobrew with actual hints of flavor. Finish is crisp, with a touch of honeyed sweetness and an easy-sipping effervescence that makes me think I’d try this again sometime. Nothing stands out but it wasn’t offensive to the palate in the least."
""
""
"Had this one on tap at a Polish festival in Omaha and man did I enjoy it. It was a hot day and the beer couldn't have been any fresher. I bought a glass and the head curled up along the top and dripped down the outside perfectly. My first smell I noticed more hops and character than I'm used to having in a Euro Pale Lager. This beer was balanced and rich in flavors but refreshing and delicious. No skunk either. I may make this my go to EPL."

""

""
"Overall not something I would seek out again. Kind of terrible actually."
""
"Overall: good for the price. 500mL for AU$4 (for one bottle, not for the case etc). Pretty good value. Can't get it much better for that price."
""
"Overall, pretty nice tasting beer that falls short in the more subjective areas."
""
"O/D-This went down very nicely at a barbeque. Not as poorly produced as many other Euro Lagers. I enjoyed it to a certain extent."
"Didn't realize that it was 5.6 percent alcohol, doesn't really taste that strong. Just noticed it on the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - I'm assuming this bottle is a bit past its prime, but even then I don't think this would have been anything spectacular when fresh."
""
"O: A typical macro mainstream beer, for those who care more for buzz in relation to the cost rather than high quality."
""
"Overall, this is a boring beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is awesome from the tap in Poland. Funny though, when I bought a six pack in the US it was not as good. I love the taste and like many other beers in the area it has that common European taste to it. This beer is a lower hopped beer with just the right amount to let you know you're drinking beer, but yet not all overwhelming. Look for this beer on tap when in Poland and enjoy. Also, ask the bartender the proper way to pronounce the name. It's tricky to say correctly."
""
""
"Overall: An everyday beer that you shouldn't runaway from. A notch sweet but creamy well worth your time drinking. Salud!"

"500ml bottle.Dimpled mug.Bright golden.White,small bubbled, froth.Quickly dissipated head.Floral & slightly sweet aromasClean bitterness.Grainy palate. ABV is felt.Medium body,medium carbonation.Intense & flavorful mouthfeel sensation, mineral thick backbone -as displayed on the label: pure mountain water- An Euro lager above the medium average -no adjuncts indeed-.So... a good reference to the style."

"O - Feel like I'm drinking an upscale Bud, crisp finish would be very refreshing on a hot day."
"M - Light body, initial burst of carbonation that settles down in the mouth pretty quickly"
"Overall, quite good beer"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not much complexity in the flavour or aromas, but certainly is refreshing on a hot summer day. Another Polish favourite that I like to have once in a while."

"O- This may be Poland's #1 beer but it's heading down the drain."
""

""
""
""

"The most common beer from Poland available in the states has some aspects that make it a very drinkable beer. Poured into a pilsner glass, the beer was a pale yellow with a half inch head. There was a mild earthy aroma that lends nothing to the beer. The taste is surprising. A sweet fruity flavor with hints of banana and sweet bread is present. This yields to a sour fruit aftertaste that stays in the mouth well after the swallow. The beer is quite flat, lacking any distinct carbonation. However, it goes down quite smooth with a slightly higher ABV than most macros."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good for days when you know you will drink more than you should"
""
""
""
"Appearance is gold with a nice aray of white foam. Smell is typical of the euro brews, lacks hops in aroma. Mouthfeel is somewhat lingering. Lays in the mouth for a short period. Taste is ok for this Euro Pale Lager. Reminds us of all those other Euro lagers. Drinkable, but not something we will run out a buy. Overall we will not turn this beer down, but we will not go out seeking this one. Give us some peanuts with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Obvious 11 years has done good for this brew – but by looking at the other review it didn’t hurt it either."
"O: a good example of EPA, an ok all around beer, light on flavor and a bit more fruity than I like my lagers to be."
""
""
"12oz bottle pours a golden yellow with a nice medium fluffy white head. Aroma and Taste has a kind of barnyard grassiness with some light malt. A light to medium mouth feel with low to moderate carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet malt, grassy and light fruity notes, with some funky flavor and light hops. Overall your typical macro brew, light on aroma and flavor but drinkable (barely)."
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice drinkable beer that would work well with the warmer weather. Nothing groundbreaking, but also not offensive. I wouldn't rush out to get it again, but I'm happy o have tried."
"Pair with Doritos."
""
"Not a brilliant beer by any standard. Too many unpleasant off-notes lurking in the background. If you're gonna drink it, I recommend keeping it ice cold...."
"After two sips I am looking to wash my mouth out."
"Drink- Its a free beer so cant complain. Euro all day long."
"D- This is a pretty standard Eastern European lager. Nothing special."
"Food match: Polish food seems too exciting a food match for this. I'm going to recommend a bowl of soup, cream of celery, with a crusty (but make sure it's plain!) bread roll. Sorted."
"o: one of my favorite polish beers. great to kick back a few of these and relax with some friends!"
"I guess this brew is a cut above some of the other Polish/Ukrainian/Baltic mass-market lagers, but that isn't really saying much."
"O - a drinkable lager but certainly nothing to seek out - I can not imagine someone preferring this style over all others"
"O/D - I couldn't session this, but it is drinkable as a lager. Doesn't taste great but much better than others available in those parts. This was fresh and domestic, I've never tried it at home, but I don't imagine travel would be kind to it."
"O: A standard Polish lager - average in most aspects. It would mix well with traditional Polish bread and cabbage-based dishes."
"O - Fairly drinkable. Bitterness is more than expected. Typical pale lager I tried throughout eastern europe."
"O - For $1.99 bomber its ok, but there is a lot better out there and this one will be passed on in the future"
"O-Reminds me of a european version of bud. Very drinkable but thats because it lacks flavor and body. Fairly close to the style but still not alot going on in this beer"
"Overall: Not my beer"
"Poured a golden pale yellow, no head, no lace, but a nice visible stream of carbonation, classic euro lager look. Smell was very light, corn, grain, bread, sort of a musky smell, again pretty run of the mill for the style. The taste was crisp, and clean, classic lager, grainy malted taste, slight hint at the european hops. Very smooth and a classic session beer. Overall it was ok"
"A top macro lager - if that seems like a back-handed compliment, it is."
"Notes: It's not too bad not anything to write home about but it could come in handy on a hot spring or summer day. Cheers."
"This is beer at it's most basic. It's good for summer when you just want to drink a beer to quench your thirst without giving it a lot of thought. A much better alternative to most AAL's."
"First Poland Champion #1 Beer of Poland look good. It have gold body. Many head for style. So much fizzy. Smell is like Poland springs water. Much nice for you to buy. With corn. Is clean taste you want have. Make for you now. Zywiec has delicious beverage. If feel you like drink to make proud family. Buy for you want have. You will like."
"Pours a rather clear semi-copper color with a rather thick head of foam. Scent is mostly of malts and it's not a very good scent either as it sort of reminds me of vomit sadly enough. There is a ver fine and thin taste to it. Semi-sweet malts and a touch of almounds is what I pick out. Still very drinkable but too thin and watery for my liking."
"Pours a light golden color with a thin soapy white head which recedces to no lacing and no real head. The aroma was of grains and some bland malts. The taste had a grainy and corn backbone, but then there was a nice sweet undertone from the middle to the back end. A slight hop bite but hard to find. The mouthfeel was heavily carbonated. Overall it was an above average euro. The sweetness makes it stand out a little bit from the others."
"A decent lager....accompanied an excellent Hunter's Stew at a local Polish restaurant. Crisp bite, nice combination of malt and hops; but would have liked it to be a bit hoppier. Fruity undertones, fairly strong carbonation. Nice dry finish. Hazy gold with a fluffy white head that held on for a good bit. Probably served a bit too cold, so I let it sit for a while. Easy drinking and complimented the hearty stew nicely. If I'm back at this place, I'll have another. I may, however, ask them to serve it in something other than a Stella glass..."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink but there’s nothing interesting enough in this that would make me want to try this again."
"Final Grade: 2.95, a C."
"Darker side of golden with a stiff off white head. Smells sweet with some soapy leather. Taste is a lot higher quality than smell. Although taste is light and refreshing its a bit more flavorful than your average adjunct. I would have liked just a little bit more bitter hop to balance the cereal sweetness. A little more enjoyable after the leather burned off. Really enjoyed this one with a steak fajita. I'll get it again. Na zdrowie (Pronounced ""Nasdrovia"" - to your health in Polish)."
"This beer pours a clear, gold color with half-inch head and some lacing throughout. The aroma is citrusy with hints of honey and bread dough. It's flavor is well balanced beginning with honey followed by lemon. It has a medium mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. Zywiec Beer is a very good brew, very refreshing and drinkable. Recommended!"
"Pours a clear, super-lite, yellow. A white head disappears soon. Smell is fragrant biscuit, grasses, and a bit of mineral. Taste has a predominate bitterness that I can describe as ""green bottle-like."" Very grassy, litely citrusy hops and some malty lagerness. Finishes very dry, and with some simple sugar, and with some heat. Interesting beer, but may be a bit too bitter for my tastes."
"must pour out."
"5. Drinkability - a good refreshing lager with that European taste. $6.50/six-pack is a good value."
"If you're the type who likes simple, conventional pale lagers - or if you're in the mood for one - you could do a lot worse than Zywiec. Even with the pasteurization, preservatives and (suspected) adjuncts, these Polish lagers aren't too far a cry from the more esteemed beers of Germany or the Czech Republic. If that's your scene, why not give it a try?"
"Had this at Blue Mountain Beer Fest last year for the first time. Poured out into a small cup that was given out upon entry. The beer poured out as a pale yellow, nothing overly exciting there. The aroma was a little skunky, Flavor was on the bitter side also a little light. Nothing made a major impact on me from this beer. I probably won't be seeking this one out anytime soon."
"O - A foreign BMC. Not a bad drink, but not something I would seek. Easy to consume but no great flavors. Noticeable odd bitterness after warming 2.5"
"drinkability is high because there is not that much going on here. Even for summer i rather have a nice APA since there is WAY more flavor in a beer like alpha king but im a hop head so what do you expect. This beer is simply boring and just like any other boring macro lager but more expensive."
"D- Very sessionable just not much taste here, I wouldnt pick this up if i saw it. Stick with Sam Smith if youre looking for a good Euro Lager."
"Overall, a non-offensive, but unmemorable beer."
"D- was high its pretty tasty and crisp easy to drink the 500 ml will buy this again"
"Pours clear golden colour with a brief white head. Aroma is grainy and grassy with subtle citrus. Flavour is similar with hints of straw and light malt. Light bodied with lots of carbonation and a fairly short finish. Overall a decent lager which is very easy to drink but doesn't have a whole lot to it. You could do worse. Wanted to try a Polish beer."
"D - Easily drinkable, but a fairly average offering and I wouldn't purchase it again. Oddly enough, I found it to be similar to Heineken, and found it humerous that they were a subsidiary of the aforementioned brewery."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is somewhat sweet, malts. Taste is good, sweet, malts, bitter at the finish, surprisingly flavorfull. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall a good quality brew."
"I had it on tap while killing a layover in Wasrsaw, given I was traveling, it was a nice treat. I wouldn't go out of my way for it though, almost any beer would have done nicely on a 5 hour layover in Warsaw."
"D: Disgusting beer in my mind, I tried hard to finish one bottle, never will again."
" D- This beer is nice and clean in the aroma with a good hint of grain. The carbonic acid is just to big and bitey but it does scrub away much of the flavor. It would be nice on a very hot day but I would prefer more grain flavor and less fizz to show some of the hops."
"D-Fairly bitter lager tastes great with fresh polish sausage and pierogis. Dziekuje! Let's polka!"
"D: The back of my bottle had a ""beer thermometer", when logo appeared making it ideal temperature.Was playing cards at the time, and went back to my beer, thought I had a complete different beer.I prefered it warmer the recommended."
"D: OK for style, not something will reach for again."
"Picked up a half litre bottle at the Al Campo store for about a buck fitty. Pours a decnt white light foamy head. Has that tradition Euro Lager skunky smell which I personally don't mind. Taste is a bit better than the other macro euro lagers although somewhat sweeter than normal. Mouthfeel is lightbodied and carbonated. Drinkability is slightly above average although I would prefer something a tad more bitter on a warm spring day."
"Pours a straw yellow color with two fingers of head that fade slowly with some streaky lacing. The aroma is mainly grainy, with some faint sweet malt and metallic notes. Slightly dry and chalky on the front end, mild malt flavor in the middle and then a slight bitterness and more chalkiness on the back end. The finish is slightly lingering, body is medium and drinkability is so-so. Nothing special about this one."
"Full review @ http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/"
"Drinkability: a very plain, light-flavored pale lager; I wouldn't want to drink a ton of this but, boy, it sure goes down easy."
"D - As far as cheap Polish lager goes this isn't all that bad. Not a world beater by any stretch but still better than most of the local Australian mass-produced crap."
"high drinkability."
"Pours a very clear and bubbly straw color with very little head and no retention. Scent is extremely light with notes of damp straw and yeasty bread. Taste brings the qualities from the scent with a touch of stale earthy hops... no lager twang. Lighter side of medium bodied, bubbly for a while. A decent BMC alternative but not much more."
"Pours a clear, pale, straw color with a decent white head that retains fairly well. Smells of cereal grains, yeast, and a touch of earthy hops. Tastes of doughy malt, lots of yeast, light noble hops. Light and crisp mouthfeel. It's not bad. I'd take it over a BMC beer. It's along the lines of a Heineken."
"Good stuff. If more fresh European lagers were available I'd probably drink more of them. Some one get on that. Thanks."
"D - not much to it, a slight step above its American counterparts with a bit more ""real"" and less fake adjunct flavoring. might accompany some Asian food or a simple salad nicely."
"Drinkability - I wonder is this like Heineken's ""slow"" cousins beer...jealous of the successful family but just couldn't make it happen. overall its just a clean tasting beer that i would not hunt down."
"there's really no need to write a full review on this beer. i had one of these with lunch at the hippy food store and i didnt know it was in any way related to heineken but the first thing that came to mind upon drinking this was ""heineken with a slight apple taste/smell"". not really a beer to complain about in general but its pricier than heineken and i dont really see any way that it's a step up. overall its a good beer i suppose but you wont catch me buying any more of it."
"Notes: I haven't had too many mass produced lagers but this was better than I expected and very drinkable. Definitely a C for this style."
"500ml bottle at Paddington's Pub in Grand Bend, ON. Zywiec pours a pale golden yellow with a sliver of white froth and zero lacing. Smell and taste are flowery, grassy, and herbal hops, light bready malts, mineral water, mild cereal-like graininess, bittersweet aftertaste. Typical Euro Lager flavour. Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, creamy palate midway, bitter and chalky finish. An easy drinking EPL that fails to stand out from others in the style. Neverthless, this is worth a sample if nothing better is available to you. Quaffable."
"D- Didn't sit perfect, but wasn't harsh. I don't expect to try it again, but it didn't offend me much."
"Taste, not a lot to speak of. Light malt, little to no roasting, barely noticeable hops combined with big carbonation. Does at least have a greater than average bitterness to it. Cheap hops, long boil I guess. At least it isn't overpriced."
"I'm sure discerning Poles consider this to be Poland's #1 Premium Beer much the same as Americans consider Buttweiper to be #1 in America."
"D-I look at this as the ""Bud"" of Poland. When in Poland, I will go for other choices."
"Drink: Well, I'm running low on beer so I'll quaff this one down. Nothing to write home about."
"Mildly high carbonation, but not enough to cut through the sweetness."
"M/D: The dark caramel aspects give a heavier feel that seems out of place. I'd like it better if it were more crisp and light. Carbonation was very rigorous after the pour but soon settled to an appropriate level. Overall there are a few things I don't like about it, but it's not too bad. Pretty typical EPL."
"Taste reminded me of the nose. Was rather bitter on the palate and not really in a good way. I also found it to be a little dry. Very simple beer."
"D: Not bad"
"Pours a clear medium golden with a thin white head. Not much retention, and just a bit of laceing. Aroma is of pale bready malts. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is bready with a sweetness throughout. Crisp finish with hints of honey. Worth a try"
"simple but decent, I would drink this again but I wouldn't go looking for it"
"Poured a nice clear golden yellow with a two fingered creamy just a touch off white head that dissapeared quickly to thin lacing. Aromas of light sweet crackers and grass with a touch of gun metal.Taste pretty much like it smelled on the palette but the metal finish was kinda weird. Medium light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Wasn't truly impressed with the overall of this brew but the abv's kept it from a total washout."
"Pretty pleasantly surprised with this one, would reach for a Zywiec over an American Macro any day of the week..."
"The crispness will allow you to drink many of these and the higher ABV will get you trashed faster than with American NASCAR beers and after three or four you'll forget that it's basically an average beer. I'm trying to figure out what the medals mentioned on the bottle were for."
"The body was surprisingly full for the style. drinkability was very good, I'd happily grab a bottle of this to have with a sandwich at the park for lunch. Overall, a very nice brew that's worth a shot if you see it."
"Overall a good lager with a nice hop presence. The dry/chalky mouthfeel is great. It's clean and nonintrusive. It's simple and satisfying."
"I bought a 4-pack of 16.9oz cans for $4.99 at the famed DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY and drank two post-haste. The only real problem with Zywiec IMO is that it has an unpleasant alcohol-y edge that makes it taste spiked, as if they tried to take a shortcut and enhance the ABV by means other than fermentation. (A brewer would probably be able to diagnose this better than I can). If it were possible to separate that aspect this might be a decent European-style lager; as it is, I'd pass it by for any number of better offerings."
"Slainte."
"D - Read the definition of a Euro Pale Lager and this is what you get. Nothing that particularly stands out for the beer, but also nothing offensive about it either. Just gets average scores across the board from me."
"I'm sure it would go well with almost any food, and would probably go down like water on a hot day. It was interesting to try something different, but it's not one that I'd likely buy again."
"D: A higher abv session choice"
"I initially got two foamy, soapy fingers' worth of bone-white head that settled down pretty quickly. Color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a soft hoppiness, present but not in-your-face. In fact, it really smelled like lager should, no adjunct scents to get in the way. Mouthfeel was medium with a lager sweetness on the tongue. I have not had Zywiec since my Bloomfield Bridge Tavern days and it brought back fond memories of their Red and White dinner platters, sitting around with Stosh, drinking Polish and Baltic beers. Finish was smooth, soft, very lager-like. This was quite the hook-up and very welcome in my cooler at the beach!"
"Overall, it is always fun getting to try new beer and a Polish beer is never an exception. This tastes a lot like American macro lagers, but it definitely has that European tough to it with the hops and malt flavors I can taste. Relatively drinkable."
"Pours a pale golden color with a white head that quickly disappears. Aroma of malt, grass, yeast, and a slight metallic smell. Taste has some sweet grains and more grass. Average body for a lager, with mild carbonation. Not too bad, but not something I'd buy again. There are better Euro Lagers than this."
"Pours dark golden colour with a thick white head. Hoppy aroma with grains, also with some floral accents. Both fairly faint though. Taste is malty sweetness,grassy hops, honey, and for some reason reminds me of a malt liquor. Decent. Bottle from the LCBO."
"Again, as in the aroma, the flavor is pretty bland. Very soft carbonation up front with pilsner malt being the most prominent flavor. There is also a touch of the light crisp fruit notes from the aroma and subtle grass/straw."
"D-Definitely tasty but a bit on the heavy side so I can't see myself drinking more that two or three of these."
"D: High, but the store I went to had this beer price ridiculously marked up."
"Pure malt in the aroma, straight forward and enticing. Transfers into the quaff nicely, big malt backbone with some light grass and hay notes. Very nice pilsner beer to enjoy with the Saturday football, not an average beer at all."
".66L poured into a pokal. Pours an amber gold with an initial one finger head that settles quickly to a thinning ring. Sweet malts are immediately apparent to the nose. The malts take to the fore in taste, leaving a mild, slightly hoppy aftertaste. As for drinkability, this is not a bad beer for mass market, competing (as it does) with Lech Premium in Poland. I could easily spend an evening enjoying a few, but not something that I would go out of my way to find."
"Now, while the Beer Advocate Brothers have graded this beer a pretty low grade, it was my understanding that Zywiec had won a gold medal in 2007 I believe for best Polish beer? I could be mistaken. Anyway, as much of the beer I have reviewed this beer is available at the store I work at. I was impressed originally only because I thought it was going to be terrible. The beer has a decent crisp taste, especially severed cold. Zywiec has a golden amber color, which leans toward a mediocre head. Some lacing occurs, but nothing to scream about. Overall, a decent beer, nothing great, better than I expected."
"Not a bad beer from Poland, certainly better than most of the beer sold here. I don't think I'll have this again, but it was fun to try."
"Pale colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is macro like.Taste also tastes like a sweet version of a macro.Overall it's a decent beer that is probably best for summer outdoor festivities.It's a good buy at 22.00 for a case of 16.9oz cans.I would recommend and would purchase again."
"D-It's a great beer for regular consumption and on sale for 5.99/6pk. it was a good deal."
"Notes: Being Polish, I've wanted to try a Polish beer for a while. I'm not disappointed, but not overly impressed. This beer is about what I expected, a standard Euro lager. Flavors aren't bad, but not bold, at least its cheap."
"Nothing special. Kind of boring, but not picking up any major faults, either. There are worse things you could be drinking, but life is too short for boring beer."
"Zywiec is obviously a mass market beer in Poland and is widely available here in Chicago, making it easy to lump in with average-costing imports like Becks, Heineken, etc. But, be aware that this is a far better beer than any comparably priced import. Nothing offensive here in the taste dept. The taste is fresh, crisp and clean. The carbonation is perfect and adds just the right amount of bite. The alcohol content is a bit higher than others in it's class, but with the richness of the taste it blends right in. This is what mass market American beers dream of being, but can't seem to pull off. This may be a buck or two more than Bud, Miller, Pabst, etc., but well worth it. This is a real quencher and goes down smooth and tasty. An excellent beer for getting out of hand and pounding down a few with an added touch of class! Very tasty!"
"Drinkability: For the style this is decent. It is somewhat more tasty than others in this category. I would have this again if I was looking for a beer in this style, but otherwise would pass."
"The taste is a bit lemony, tart, metallic, grassy, a bit biting in parts, a little bit of citric lemon comes through. The beer is refreshing, watery, lagery, drinkable, with some bland mustiness in there as well. There are some grains that could be nice but are covered over with mustiness and the metallic flavors. A compromised lager, but it's okay."
"D: a delightful brew offered at a decent price. Nothing to seek out, but great of you're looking for something new."
"Overall: There are better choices for Euro Pale Lagers."
"Overall an average euro pale."
"D - Much better from a can than I remember previous bottles I have had but still not as flavorful as I would like."
"Overall this beer is thoroughly underwhelming and doesn't stand out much. If I was planning on getting tipsy with a few friends, however, this brew would likely be a step above other beers of this style."
"D: Not too flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, since there isn't much to this beer there are a lot of others I'd pick first."
"It's worth a shot, and it isn't bad, but I probably won't come back to it. There's nothing memorable about it."
"11.2 oz bottle"
"Mouthfeel - smooth and creamy while watery and refreshing. Carbonation is held well."
"Poured a very pale yellow that I personally found somewhat unpleasant. Smelled very skunky (like someone said, despite the brown bottle...which is intented to avoid skunky taste and chemical changes which can occur in the bottle under bright lights and when exposed to heat). Tasted nothing special, very malty, but not in the saltine cracker type way. The malt was more like a bland piece of stale bread which has lost its flavor. I think there was lots of hops present in the 4 bottles that I tried on 4 separate occasions, so I can only assume that this beer tastes this way in every bottle a person would buy. The flavor that sticks out the most in this beer is the fruitiness of the lager that persists until the bottle is done. I actually somewhat appeciate it, but it's not enough to redeem this lager as something I would regularly drink/buy. It does it's job at 5.5% ABV and although you would think this would make one think that it's a great ""session beer", I'd say reconsider and try some other Eastern Euro-Lagers before diving into this one as your first choice. It's passable as a decent E-E.L beer, but only barely."
"Poured crystal clear blonde with a modest head that quickly reduced to a collar and eventually, nothing. The aroma is pretty quiet, not a lot going on. The taste is sweet, I can not find any bitterness. Feel is light bodied with very little carbonation. Drinkability: you should be able to drink a lot of these and under certain circumstances, probably would. As you can tell from the review, the one remarkable characteristic of this beer is... Bland. At $1.99 for a 500 ml bottle, the price was right though."
"D- not the best, not the worst. kind of boring. after one or two im looking for what else is around."
"Nothing offensive here, but nothing exciting either. The high point is the nice light golden color, and the light bubble column of bubble. Slight bitter on the finish a little steeley, very drinkable. Faint green apple, grassy on the nose. Would be nice on a scortching hot day."
"A crisp body. I could have another I suppose."
"Drinkability is slightly lower as the ABV is higher and although the taste is pleasantly unusual, it's not something I'd want all the time."
"A Euro pale lager made in Poland and imported by Heineken. What do you expect? And yet it was a bit better than anticipated. Served cold, poured frothy yellow in the glass with a decent head and a bit of skunk (despite the brown bottle) but some malt in the nose. Taste was both a touch sweet, a bit biscuity and somewhat balanced with fruity hops, though far less than one might expect. Very easy drinking beer--almost too much so. You could put down a few of these on a cold night in Warsaw (or War-shington). Hand-delivered by UF from Pittsburgh. (Thanks UF!)"
"Drinkability - Yes very, but not in a good way. Just not a lot of flavor."
"Beer looks good, rich golden yellow. Nice 2 finger head, looks a little foamy, not that rich. Mmmmm. Took a deep wiff, annddd Nada. Already turned 180 degrees from appearance to smell. Let's take a sip. Ah ok, a good drink, not great. Could easily drink a handful of these. I will go get another and enjoy this day!"
"I could have put back a few of these. Very drinkable. Great summer beer."
"Zywiec beer is everything I thought it would be...very average. Come to think of it, it might be slightly better than I expected. I didn't have high hopes. It's biggest flaw is that it lacks any real flavor or character. I suppose it's worth a try. Generally, it's tough to find a Euro Pale that's worth a damn. This one's run of the mill for the style. But, I'm sure there's worse."
"Pours clear gold with a modest white head. The head recedes to a white ring. Some minor lacings. Aroma is grassy. Taste is mildly bitter hops with a sweet malt component. Well balanced and easy drinking. Carbonation is just enough. A mildly dry bitter finish. A very non descript beer for the most part. It would make an awesome session beer."
"A so-so Euro-lager, the sweetness a bit much at times, but the graininess does have its charm, especially when enjoyed in quantity with friends of Polish extraction, who will hear no such criticism."
"D: Just about the most safe and inoffensive beer I've had in months. It's light in flavor and body, and goes down easy. Keep it cold to fend off the odd metallic finish. A hard beer to judge, as it's a well made example of this style, but oh so boring to drink."
"D = Drinks pretty easily."
"At first swift you get a hint of skunk weed giving it any points this beer has to save itself. It has a great heavy feel of grains, followed with a great consistent clear body and proper amount of lacing. Better than most large capacity American lager, it does have some appeal when compared to bud, coors, millers and pbr. It wasn't awful."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth European lager, but it's nothing special. It's much more of a drinking beer than an enjoying beer (does that even make sense?)."
"Didn't arouse my spidey senses, but much respect to the offering from the ""Mother Country"". The ""new beer thermometer"" on the back cracks me up."
" Overall, while I'm happy with it and could drink more of it, it is not a beer that I will seek out in the future."
"Back to the beer, I found it to be an above average macro import. It was very smooth and crisp, even moreso than most of the imported stuff. Has a decent ABV of 5.7% but it was very drinkable and went great with pizza. Sure it's nothing spectacular but I'd have it again for sure."
"Overall, nothing offensive nor spectacular. Perhaps this is just a bit better than all of the other macro Euro lagers out there."
"Beer now employs a freshness date. Before Jan 20, 2009 in this case."
"Pours clear gold with a bubbly white head. Stale hay-and-sugar nose. Thin but sweet taste. Grainy and saccharine, and very watery, just like its mouthfeel. Feels and tastes cheap. Better than a Budweiser. Probably would not drink again. Doesn't come close to its Porter cousin."
"It has a golden clear body with a lot of carbonation in the middle. The head is thick and bubbly with light lace. It has very crisp aroma with some mild hops. It has more hops than malt and is also very clean in flavor. The mouthfeel is thin and lightly carbonated. It is easy to drink fast or sip and is very refreshing."
"D--Smooth going down...maybe not so much as it warms. Scared of a hangover from this stuff!"
"D - Since it is not wild or intense, you are able to drink it repeatedly. The flavour is good and won't get on your nerves if drinking a considerable amount. It also helps if you are in Poland buying it on tap at a bar where it will run your roughly $2 a pint."
"drinkability: Easy drinking beer and I had in lovely square when I visited Krakow, Poland"
"Definitely different from its domestic counterpart. I was hoping to be transported back to the Krakow student bars, but I was unsurprisingly disappointed. Still, it's crisp, light, refreshing and very drinkable, I just don't know if I'd pay $2/12oz for this over a cheaper American lager."
"Na zdrowie!!!"
"A decent, frothy head that left receeding ring on top of a golden body. Has a leafy, earthy aroma that is a tad pungent. A drying sensation over my tongue from hop bitterness; goes down with a crisp and biting backbite. Not much in the malt department. Seems like anothe Euro-macro trying to make a dent in the states."
"It's good, I could drink a couple of these in a sitting and have no complaints."
"Light body, with a good amount of carbonation. Seems pretty simple, and average."
"D: Drinkable enough; clean and refreshing. Nothing real special though."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable."
"Well, it's not horrible on a hot-ass Phoenix night. Very thin, mildly sweet, and fairly crisp overall. Lots of skunky DMS flavors, although the bitterness of the Euro hops is nice and prominent, which I find interesting and enjoyable. But not enough to overcome broad shortcomings on all other fronts. Finish is semi-dry, minorly astringent (enough to lower the drinkability index), and not pleasant enough to make me want another."
"Pours nice clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy white head that disappears quickly, very minimal sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, with some hops, grassy, with some spices. The taste is sweet, very slight hops, grassy/spicy. Light-medium body. Drinkable, not that bad, but would not buy."
"Drinkability is good. While it doesn't have much as far as appeal, it does have good taste. A six pack of this is plenty for a good dinner. Decent."
"D: Standard, average Euro lager, nothing outstanding, but cheap and goes down easy."
"Golden color, no head, very little carbonation. Maybe this stuff doesn't travel well, or its older than it should be. On the back it has a ""thermometer"" when the zywiec label shows on a picture of its beer it's ready to drink (similar to coors light rocky mountain deal) which makes me think they want it to be so cold I can't taste it. I smell a cabbage skunk malt and noble hop on this. Tastes similar to how it smells. If my memory serves me well it reminds me of a St. Pauli Girl. The barley and noble hops pull through but it's a little skunky and pilsner-like. Fairly drinkable euro lager, more flavorful and more barley than your average american macro. Don't usually like this style but I've yet to try anything from Poland and I've gotta cover the globe. Not horrible."
"Pours a clear gold with two fingers of fluffy white head. Head dissipates in 1-2 minutes, leaving a thin haze on the top of the beer and a few gobs around the rim. Nice carbonation visible. Smells musty, like damp hay or grass. A little yeasty. Apple sweetness turns bitter very quickly. Sharp carbonation and a very thin, watery body. Bitterness lingers too long for me to enjoy this beer; I'm not enthused about finishing this one, let alone opening another one."
"Has a normal pale yellow appearance to it, minimal head. Strong hop aroma, along with a hint of blackstrap molasses even a smaller tinge of honey. Tasted sweet to my palette-probably a beer I'd have after a meal but not during. Actually left a pleasant aftertaste. Not great, but not bad, either."
"slainte"
"I tried this beer on March 12, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBOI outlets. The beer poured a nice translucent gold colour with a minimal white head. The aroma was mainly grainy malts with nothing else. The mouthfeel mwas medium bodied with ample carbonation. The flavour was similar to the aroma in that it was very malty with very little other discernable flavours. This beer is readily available in Canada, but is simply an average brew at best. Not something I would consider buying again."
"I believe this is the first and only Polish brew I have had. I could never pronounce the name correctly until I actually asked a Polish couple. (For those who are unsure it is zi-vee-ic). Unfortunately it wasn't too impressive. Probably considered the Budweiser of Poland. I had it well chilled in a pint glass. Poured a bright yellow color with a decent white head. Smell was faint with some grassy hops and mild malt sweetness. Taste was thin with a little balance of malt and hops. It is pretty easy drinking but that is all it has for itself."
"Yellow golden - light straw actually with a fine puffy white head. Aromas of sweet grains, faint sulfur, and a touch of metal. What can I say - the flavor is very much the same with a neutral balance of malt v. hops. The mouth feel is just below medium and it has a sweet grain finish with a little sour edge. Not quite a beer to seek out, but it came in quite handy when washing down two andouille sausages with sweet relish, mustard and chili."
"Eh, it's beer. It begins with a crisp malt character, mixed wiht some cereal, raw grains with a pilsner malt sweetness and mild astringency. lightly hopped, adding a mild tea-like flavor and bitterness that barely offsets the sweetness. Moderate acidity takes the shape of tomatoes and sulfer, however kinda add to the complexity in a wierd sort of way. A buttery flavor becomes more prominent in the texture, but does add some flavor -- like pop corn. Both crisp an dslick in the mouthfeel, but finishes with a hearty grain flavor. probably a fine beer to chase down the polish sausages."
"D: Hey, this is an o.k. lager, a bit too sweet and not as clean as I hoped. Nevertheless, it's pretty easy to drink. Worth a try, but Poland offers much better beers than this one."
"A drinkable beer after you've had a few. Nothing to go out of your way for."
"Drinkabilty is also fine I could have another but I'm not sure I would want to."
"Won't buy again but fun to try."
"Overall- Seems like just a standard macro lager. Nothing special here, just a little stronger on ABV."
"Poured a sparkling clear yellow into my standard mug. This beer is heavily carbonated, creating a frothy white head that lingers for a few minutes. The smell is a little hoppy, some grains present. There is a bitter hop taste that is up front with this one, and I also detect a honey-like sweetness in the background, malts, or corn. Although I wouldn't expect corn in a beer of this quality. Overall, a descent Polish Pils."
"D - Clean and somewhat refreshing. Really not a bad lager at all. I might have to try this one again when summer rolls around."
"Pours a nice golden color with a good head, but little lacing. Has a nice malty scent, slightly sour. Good taste, an excellent cold beer, it has a nice malty flavor without being too sour. Goes down very smoothly. An excellent lager, one of the best I've had in quite a while."
"The drinkability is good a nice refreshing and easy drinking brew. MK"
"Received as gift from a Polish co-worker. Pours clear and golden, nice thick, fluffy head. Very good overall appearance for this style. Smell is somewhat bland with grains, straw, grass, and malt all in the profile. Taste is on par with smell. Strong malt taste followed by a grassy/grain taste and a touch of the ""skunkiness."" Really couldnt distinguish much else. Light and crisp, heavily carbonated. Overall this is not a great beer but a very good mediocre one. There is a little kick to it with the 5.7% ABV and does go down smoothly. After my first bottle it was easy to pour another. This really is not my favorite style, but I could see this scoring very high with someone who is fond of the Euro Pale."
"Eric"
"Taste has a moderately bitter aftertaste, watery body with high carbonation. Flavors were subdued, some pale malt and grassy hop at the end. A step up from swill, but not far from it. One to have several of when you don't want to think much about it. Better than BMC, but not any better than Heineken or similar Euro lager."
"Interesting beer. It pours a yellow color with a short white head. The aroma is interesting, sweet bready smell. It smells kind of like Malta Goya - malty and a little pruney. The taste at first, is like the smell. It then mellows out for a less offensive taste. It is nicely carbonated for a beer like this. Good mouthfeel but not a very drinkable taste. I would not recommend this beer but it was interesting to have one of these."
"A golden yellow beer with a soft velvety head. A pleasant hoppy flavor with fruit like overtones. A robust full-flavor, very refreshing and satisfying. Thirst quenching yet leaves you wanting more. A great beer."
"This is better than most light lagers. Although flawed, it still is a decent offering."
"Drinkability : bière pilsener de Pologne, correcte mais sans plus"
"D - This is a pretty descent lager. It tastes better than it looked or smelled."
"This beer was everywhere and everyone was drinking it, but it was not the beer I traveled to Europe to drink."
"Good for the style. Non-flavorful, lager, i.e. Polish Bud."
"Pours very nice golden ""apple juice"" color. Head is small a deminishes quickly with no real lace. Looking in Zywiec I see small bubbles that shows on the palate just enough carbonation. Smelling this beer reminds me of that skunky smell from green bottles. Taste is exceptionally clean with just enough carbonation. As I drink Zywiec bubbles and lace disappear on glass. Very drinkable for 5.6% ABV. I would suggest this as a very drinkable session beer with salad may not hold up to spicy foods"
"A fuzzy white head on pouring that settled quickly with just a thin ring around the glass and a wisp in the middle. This is carbonated alright but the bubbles are large, similar to a ginger ale. Colour is clear, almost yellow, make that yellow/orange. No discernable smell at first but, as it warmed, I thought I detected a whiff of tarragon. Mild bitterness and mild hops with a clean, almost malted barley in the finish but feint at best. Toasty mouthfeel, a bit piqued but not too sharp really for this style of beer. This is a reliable quaffing beer to be enjoyed with friends on a hot day, not to be taken too seriously."
"Skip it, lots of better stuff out there."
"D-This is probably the best of the Polish lagers but still it really does nothing for me. Living in a Polish neighbourhood I have tried pretty much all of the beers the country has to offer and the Porters are where they shine. This is basically the leastoffensive of the bunch of pale lagers."
"Summary: A well-built Euro Pale Lager, but nothing outstanding about it. Hops dominate the beverage. A decent mass-market Polish beer that deserves a look if you're into the style or in Poland."
"The aroma is fairly funky, but I can't tell if it's supposed to be like that or if its from the travel. It sort of comes off like barnyard hops, but the flavor isn't really present in the flavor. The taste is clean and slightly bready, nothing real fruity like in a Heineken. Basically clean and drinkable."
"pours a light golden color with a two finger white head with a easy pour, head settles to a ring on the glass and some lacing to the finish. aromas are earthy with hops there. taste is bready, yeasty, slightly sweet up front ending with a slightly salty taste. mouthfeel light and nicely carbonated. i happen to like a good lager and this one is not bad. good session beer."
"Although not my favorite style of beer I did indeed enjoy this beer. The color was a nice straw color leaving a white lace on the glass. The smell was overall sweet and that sweetness continued with the taste, If i were to come across this beer again I'd give it another try."
"Certainly this is an easy beer to drink. Pretty much this is in the Heineken class of beers with a bit more in the hops department."
"Overall, good but not memorable."
"this person again...lol...In appearance, this beer pours a pale pale yellow, with a 2-3 finger white foamy head that thins quick...Taste is wheaty with light hops and water...the warmer it is the more sour it gets. It's thin and crisp in the mouth. I was really in the mood for a tasty surprise tonight, and I must say that I was let down...nonetheless, I did only spend 8 bucks and this is a fairly drinkable beer so it wasn't a complete loss, just a little dissappointed."
"Borrowing from their marketing campaign in Poland, you could say this is ""Prawie jak pilsner"". Translation: Almost like a pilsner."
"Poured a short, but sturdy, bright white head. Streams of tiny bubbles rise through the glowing golden beers. Weak aroma of sweet grain, or corn, or something foul. The sweetness carries over into the flavor and doesn't allow anything else to poke through. Well, maybe there is a bit of herbal hop flavor towards the end, but the finish is grossly sweet. I've seen good beer in cans here in Germany, and I figured this would be a nice Pilsner type beer. Boy was I wrong. This is like the European version of malt liquor."
"Dark, see through golden in color, absolutely no head. Faint grainy hops, touches of biscuit notes on the nose, blah. Raw, grainy malt, grassy/hay like tastings in the initial quaffs. All signs point towards another bland Euro-lager. Very cloying and massive on-slaught flavorings of corn and malt infused adjuncts. Wet, stale cardboard and more hay like offerings. Bland and stale, even when fresh. Skip, unless your playing Scrabble."
"Notes: As this warms up the flaws become bigger and bigger. Drink this baby cold."
"Sadly I actually have a Zywiec glass, which this was poured into, but nothing can save this monstrosity from itself."
"Pours a light golden color with white fluffy head that clings to the glass. Smells very spicy & hoppy and a little light struck. Tastes very clean, a tiny bit sweet but balanced with hoppy bitterness. Finishes very clean. Mouthfeel is heavy and a little creamy but with some carbonation on the tip of the tongue, very nice. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, clean but still flavorful. I'll probably be getting this again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lackluster in mouthfeel, thin and watery... yet still syrupy from the elevated sugars and resulting ABV. A lead zeppelin."
"The Poles make a damn decent beer..I'll be trying this one again"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is light golden-yellow color with a foamy white head. Smells like sweet malt, grain. Beer is well balanced with a slightly sweet corn taste with a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very light with not too much carbonation. The beer is pretty drinkable because of the light body and bearable taste."
"Poured a 500 mL bottle into a glass mug. It had a light, golden hay color with about a half-inch white head that reduced to almost nothing but then held okay. After a few sips, the head was gone all together. A malty fruity smell that almost seemed sweet. At first, it has a slightly, bitter, fruity taste but by the middle of the beer the malts really explode, the bitterness disappears, and the sweetness of the beer comes through. Tasted very smooth with a pleasant, malty aftertaste. A nice mouthfeel that I can only describe as smoothly thick. A nice, drinkable beer; very easy going and an all around solid brew."
"I wonder if they brew in a different location for bottles and cans? This was a completely different beer to the canned one, everything was better from the bottled version!"
"This is one of the most popular beers in Poland, especially with young people. Pours a light golden color, large bubbly head dissipates quickly. Not much nose going on here but lightly metallic, a but skunky bitterness too. Taste is fairly bland as well, light malt, a very faint hoppiness and some starch. It has a very dry and crisp finish and its drinkability is high due to its lightness. Somewhat typical of other euro lagers/pilseners."
"Well for a free beer I can not knock this one too much. Poured a crystal clear yellow golden color. Disappointing snow white head that disappeared as fast as it came. No lacing at all nor was I expecting any. Smells rather sweet with a pungent bread like yeast. Some subtle hop florals and a hint of a pale malt. Taste was alright, rather bland with a sharp pungent aftertaste. Sticks around the back of the mouth for a while. Not bad but it reminds me of drinking Heineken way to much. It is a rather watery brew very light bodied. Not a bad beer but I would not want to drink it very frequently. It was neat to try a different beer being my first from Poland. I liked the bottle quite a bit. They had a cleaver color changing logo on the back label that turned red when the beer was at the best temperature for drinking. I can't wait now until one of the mass American beers takes that on. Clearly marked with a best by date. It was an alright offering but clearly not a perfect match for my taste."
"zywiec is nice on a hot summer day, goes down smooth. i used to live in michigan little poland (hamtramick) and zywiec was served in all the polish resturants and it goes really well with the combo plate!"
"Slightly lingering skunky aftertaste, other than its a great beer. Honesty I've had worse. It's not as bad as it sounds. Out of the eastern European selections I have tried recently I would say this is not nearly as good as Czeckvar. The label shows a happy couple dancing in typical Polish dress. I like that."
"Poured straw-coloured with a very small head (and the glass was clean and residue-free). Smells of sweet malt and hay. Nice sweet malty straw taste with a medium mouthfeel. Very lively on the palate as well. Not bad, but I can think of many better eurolagers. Will definitely buy it again if it's on sale."
"Man this is good. It has a slightly deeper malt taste than alot of other lagers which helps temper hop bitterness. Metallic taste is rather big here but it isn't harsh and actually kind of works. Its a little like licking a new penny. Alcohol comes out a bit toward the end. Every now and then an almost fruity taste pops up through the light sweetness. I guess this is kinda flawed and funky but its also flavorful and smooth and I like it. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and lively and I doubt this beer will last long."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" white head above the clear light golden brew. Frothy head is active, falling but being rejuvenated as well, with ample lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet, with some floral hoppiness. Taste is also finds the sweet pale grains, coupled with crisp Saaz hoppiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, but this just doesn't quite come together as nicely as I hoped to be a warm weather thirst quencher. Still not a bad brew."
"Drinks okay, pretty tasty for the style IMO. This tasted a little better in Germany, but still worth a shot"
"D: This one gets the ""meh"" rating, but I should say that I don't think that euro lagers really float my boat. With that said, it seems like this fits style guidelines and is everything that it is supposed to be. Overall, not bad."
"Zywiec Beer pours a pale yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle with a beer thermometer that says the beer is ready to be drank if you can see the logo. Aroma is mild and grainy. Taste isn't quite what I was expecting. Grainy yes, but also a good amount of hops. Frankly, I think this is better than a lot of Euro macro lagers. That said, it still leaves something to be desired. Fairly average, I wouldn't turn my nose up at one, worth a try."
"Not the worst of Polish Lagers, but another representative of this style brewed at Zywiec subsidiary in Cieszyn, is far better."
"Not much aroma, but a decent looking beer. Tastes like they used Hallertau bittering hops in this but forgot the aroma hops. A sort-of sweet and heavy mouthfeel on this brings drinkability down a tad. It's not bad, but not outstanding, either."
"Over all, I found this beer to be very crisp and extremely refreshing on a warm summer night."
"It is drinkable, but not anything special. On par, or not much above, with the typical euro-lagers. At least it's in a brown bottle - might be worse in green. Certainly better than Heineken, Beck's or several other popular Euros."
"My first Polish beer... I had never seen this beer before prior to drinking it, and I had no idea what to expect from it. It pours golden, and has a surprisingly nice head for a pilsner. It tastes a bit like Heine (which is no surprise, considering that Heine owns this brewery). Overall, a pleasant, though unremarkable, beer. The best thing about it is its beautiful label (complete with a ""beer thermometer"" that tells when the beer is at drinking temperature.)"
"Drinkability: Overall a decent Euro Pale Lager that I probably wouldn't buy again, if I ever see it again. Something you only need try once at that's it."
"Smell, not much there. A decent head is formed when poured, but dissipates quickly. This beer starts out like a robust continental lager, finishes with a little hop spicyness that hints at a Pilsner. When frothed on the palate, a few subtle citrus notes are released and a little malt sweetness can be detected. Dare I say this, but it tastes slightly like a Dortmunder with its no-nonsense taste,cold, refreshing, not weak. I was hoping this brew might be a little more complex but feels like a Euro-macro if there is such. I applaud the Polish for making a nice full-bodied beer and the 5.6% alcohol adds a little backbone. Cheers, Joe"
"Taste is all nice bready malts, a bit alcoholic, and a refreshing bitterness from the noble hops. Flavour wise this is a really well balanced and pleasant lager. Better than average. Nice tongue bite, goes down pretty smooth. I think this would be a really good summer session beer. Nothing majorly special, but as Euro lagers go, it isn't too bad..."
"Another Polish pale lager, coming in the 500ml brown bottle. Nice enough labelling: white with lots of red and traditionally-clad figures of a man and woman--the cap has the same logo. The label on the back has a little gadget I have never seen before, and I thought it was cool: in a little box are the words ""Beer Thermometer"" and then beside that it says: ""Refrigerate, wait until Zywiec logo appears that indicates ideal drinking temperature."" Sure enough a little red Zywiec symbol appears after cooling the bottle. First time I have ever seen that. Zywiec is a super-clear honey-golden colour, with a fairly dense but quickly moving aspirin-white head. Rapidly moving lacing. The head settled as a patchy paper-thin covering. A typical and average looking Polish lager. The nose is a mixture of honey and fresh green grass. Dusty continental hopping, some sweetish light malts, and a hint of spritzy alcohol. There is a bit of a creamy marshmallow aroma too. More malty than a Dort-export or Czech Pils. The hops are well balanced with the malt though, and all in all this is a good aroma for its purpose and style. No ""off"" smells. Again, average. As the beer warms, the aroma seems to exhibit too much sugary maltiness, like malt-liquor. The beer's taste is rather light overall, with honeyed malts and the faintest hint of dusty bitterness. There is a bit of a sourish/underdeveloped malt note here, adding some unpleasant cardboard tastes. It finishes decently, leaving equal parts light sweetness and coppery dryness. The poor malt flavour seems to be at the front of the tongue, because in the middle and back the malting is all right, adding some toasty bread flavours. There is really nothing much else to describe. The mouthfeel is medium in carbonation, and light bodied. Quaffable I grant you. There is really nothing to complain about here, despite Zywiec's commonality and average flavour. Still better than a plethora of lagers out there."
"Overall - A very average beer... worth a try maybe once...."
"Bham UK Dec 2005"
"Feels ok in the mouth - cold, crisp, medium carbonation. Drinkable but nothing special."
"I would recommend this."
"My first Polish beer but not my last. In a way it reminds me of Grolsch....another European Pale Lager but a bit different. If you like Grolsch, you like this beer.:)"
"This beer had a nice thermal label that changed color when the beer was the right temperature to drink. The beer poured a real pale straw color, clear with a dense white head. Strong sweet malt aroma, with faint floral hops and a little skunk, as it warms the malt aroma opens up with hints of Vienna or Munich malt. The flavor is malty sweet, not very bitter at all, and a touch of hops and a creaminess in the finish. The body is solid for a pale lager, and the sweetness stays around longer than most others. The malt flavor is amazing for such a pale beer, making this beer a must try."
"One note: although I was immune, many of the ex-pats I worked with in Poland avoided the beer for it's suppossed reaction on their bowel movements, giving it the nickname that rhymes with it's pronunciation of ""JIVY-ITS"" (Jivyshits). To be fair though, we drank an awful lot that year so I wouldn't neccesarily blame the beer, more the lifestyle. Give it a chance if you can find it. Nastrovia!"
"Not a bad beer at all. Has some nice aspects, but is far from being spectacular. Poured out to a nice golden color with a foamy white head. Some lace was in the glass, something that was quite a suprise considering the style. Aromas of malt and hops was appealing, but rather ordinary. Taste was pretty quaffable, flavors of malt, grain, corn and hops were in balance, with a touch of a sweet character toward the middle. Mouthfeel was slightly weaker than I would have cared for, but not what I would refer to as watery. Good drinkability, this is a decent beer at a decent price. This is what I would think of when the term ""European Macro"" was being used. Not bad, worth a try if you come across it."
"Like many Euro lagers, this one was not impressive in anay catagories. One of the few beers I could not even finish, dropping it to one of my lowest reviews yet. Best part was the bar itself, not the beer."
"M&D: the merit is the semi-lively fizzy palate turns more and more dry, whereas the mouthfeel inevitably feels thin-ish in the end due to the lack of body and a residual sugary undertone is not so much appreciated. Overall, quite easy-drinking this beer is, sitting in-between a dry-Pilsner in need of more assertive hop aroma and a Bavarian Helles requiring greater malt presence."
"Not a bad lager, but nothing spectacular. Not bad"
"I bought it in a 500 ml bottle for what most other 330mls cost ,so as well as being a pleasant drink is reasonably cheap."
"If this was sitting next to Miller, I'd take this unless it cost more."
"This is a decent beer that won't blow your socks off, but does display an interesting battle between the malt and hops throughout the profile. While there isn't anything wrong with this, I'm sure I can probably find something cheaper that is as pleasing, or something the same price that is more satisfying."
"BB 10-4-06. Good poorout with lasting head and nice and clear golden beer. Nose is lot less; very papery, sweetish, oxidised and a far from fresh maltarome. Taste is as the smell, oxisidised maltiness, sweetish empty and hardly any bitterness. Empty watery and unfresh mouthfeel makes drinkability to undrinkable. One of my worst lager expiriences recently; one to avoid!"
"Bottle: Poured a golden color lager with a large head with minimal retention. Aroma of crispy malt is quite enjoyable. Taste is constituted of crispy malt with some floral hops. Very refreshing beer but this bottle version may have not travelled that well overseas since there was a subtle skunkyness to be found at the end."
"This is easy to drink, but I think it might be an acquired taste. The beer thermometer is a fairly useless invention, but neat none-the-less. Would I buy this again? Maybe. Its not bad, but it could stand to be better."
"Overall: Much like Heineken really. Buy this for the folk-dancing mascots only."
"This is a pretty nice beer, and it sure as hell warms you up with its 5.7 ABV, but it's nothing to write home about."
"Zywiec is an average EPL, making it a below average beer in general. More hops would help, but if it's been brewed since 1856 (with the same recipe, one would guess), then it's doubtful that we can expect a change at this late date. Besides, maybe there are those who love this stuff and buy it by the case. It isn't for me though."
"Quite a drinkable brew brought to us by Stanley Stawski from the biggest Polish city outside of Warsaw (Chicago)."
"A clean golden yellow beer. Has abig bright white foamy head. There is a sweet grassy aroma with a light biscuty background. The flavor is a little light sweetness at first with abit of grainy smoothness in the middle and a nice even hops bite on the finish. There is a good clean refreshing mouthfeel to this beer which makes it easy to enjoy."
"This isn't a bad beer at all. A bit of a hop aroma, sort of mineral-like as well. Medium gold body with a tight white head. The flavor follows the nose, with crisp hops and a mineral-water finish. Mouthfeel is decent, ad the beer is overall refreshing. Not an impressive beer, but not something I'd refuse like most BMC products. I wouldn't buy it, but I'll drink it."
"Not at all bad for what it is. Compared to a typical macro type import it stands up well. Its a pale lager, what do you want? Good clear body and a frothy head. Aroma is very muted. Flavor is fair, a bit bland but there is a tiny note of bready malt and a touch of spicy hop finish. Strongly carbonated. Fairly refreshing beer, I could put them away all night, but there are better beers I'd rather be drinking."
"Not as good as the porter, but not too bad. average, but still refreshing beer."
"I found it pairs well with somewhat spicy or sour foods whether hot peppers or cabbage/sauerkraut , as well as pork rather appropriate for a brew from Poland."
"This is a rather standard Euro-lager all the way. It doesn't offer much that will tantilize the tastebuds but it remains drinkable. Na zdrowie!"
"It pours a very pale straw color with a few lazy bubbles. The head is shortlived, almost instantly receding to a small ring. Lacing is moderate. The aroma is stiff malts, some grassy hops, and a little bit aof DMS. The taste is much the same with a grainyness and a few cooked veggie flavors. Hops at least are present. The mouthfeel is grainy and quite full bodied. This a bit of astringency in the finish that could mean skunk. Overall though, this is an inoffensive beer with a bit more flavor than Blue or Coors, but still not a lot of flavor."
"Drinkability- Nice and different beer. Can't say I have had one exactly like it before. Interesting; I'll give it that. Would have again. Good price for what I got to sample."
"Oh yeah it has good fuzzy,clean mouthfeel and drinkability is excellent."
"Clear medium yellow appearance, mousse-like head of intermediate bubbles and staying power. Broken thick horizontal bands for laces. Grassy, lightly sufurous, pale grape jelly mark the aroma. Lighter body, prightly carbonation, livens up the start of the flavor profile. Not too sweet in the malt department, a fruity astringency shows and intertwines with a solid hoppiness that's crisp and well-attenuates the close. Refreshing and not complex, a decent mix of toasted grain and balancing hops, some alcohol sense. I'd keep some cans around for the warm weather."
"Pours a straw gold color, slightly hazy. Head is bubbly, and not long lasting. Smell is of grassy malt and light skunk. Taste is cliche euro lager. Grass, small hops, nothing interesting. Not even a good fallback, I would rather (shudder) have a Budweiser."
"The taste was bitter, with a mildly sweet aftertaste. Now don't get me wrong, I love a bitter beer. But this one just didn't stand out."
"Yeah, I admit it, I sometimes fall back on this beer. Hey, at least it's not a Bud or Coors, or...Corona. Pours out a straw gold color with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell consisted of hops but then died off after a while. Taste was decent enough. Some malts and grains show up with some hop spiciness that comes in at the middle and lasts into the aftertaste. Seemed a little light, but it wasn't in a bad way. There seemed to be a touch of citrus at the end as well which was refreshing. When this is fresh, this beer could be on."
"A grassy, metallic malt taste predominates; almost a burnt popcorn note works its way into an otherwise passable malt backbone. Slippery, not quite wholesome mouthfeel. Poland can keep the rest of this."
"Nice beer. Nothing outstanding, but a good chugger."
"As part of a tasting including a Polish friend of mine, at the sous-bock in Paris, we decided to try their national- Zywiec. However, I was very disappointed in it. first off, the weak lager perception, a simple straw clear pour, with a bit of a head and not much else; a smell, clearly hoppy and with some malts reminding me of pilsners (which are not, btw, my favourites). The taste, shared among an initial malty slight sweetness, a posterior metallic pilsner like feel and finally a considerable bitterness, is not excessive, but not watery either, enhancing the mouthfeel."
"Poured a clear, golden straw color with a very impressive white head that slowly dissipated into a sheet of lace that clinged to the glass. A pleasant malty aroma was noticeable with a slight floral hop fragrance. It had a biscuity, sweet malt taste that was balanced by a floral/spicey hop flavor. The body is medium with a fine to moderate carbonation that leaves a slightly creamy mouthfeel. It finishes smooth and light with a fairly dry aftertaste that lingered. Overall, a pleasant beer with some nice malt and hop character."
"Overall- absolutely undrinkable!! Man I know they drink antifreeze and petrol in Poland but this is worse!!!"
"Pale golden body with a thin head of white foam fed by forced carbonation. Slightly sulfurous hop aroma is typical of mass produced European lagers. Slightly sweet malt taste is pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is thin but appropriate for the style. This defines the average of the entire spectrum of beers for me."
"I wish this was their porter; Appearance: Golden straw tone thin white head, not too impressed thin lacing. Aroma: Grassy hop nite with a mildly citrus grassiness from the grains there, not bad clean smelling not too complex. Taste: Not very flavorful touch of grainy sweetness very bland, hop bitterness is untraceable to my tastebuds, dissapointment. Mouthfeel: Very thin weak carbonation, watery not going to waste my money on this one again. Drinkability: Unoffensive and light bodied seems like too many would leave me with a cracking headache, one is enough."
"Served in a iced branded mug. Clear dark yellowish tone, bleached white head that faded quickly. I couldn't smell much of anything other than some light hops on the nose. Remarkably ordinary lager that impersonates a pilsner on occasion. More malty on the tongue than expected, finish was clean and it was crisp troughout. Typical feel and drinkability. I did find this was the beer I liked most of the Polish beers I got to try in Warsaw and Rzeszow but that isn't saying much."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a spotty white lace head. The aroma is decent. It is typical lager scent; pale malts and lager yeast. It does have a refreshingly sweet aroma that grabs my attention. The taste is average. It is light with a simplistic malt makeup. It finishes dry and clean with no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent lager, but nothing I would drink again."
"But at least there is a ""Beer Thermometer"" on the bottle. So I am assured that I consumed it at the proper temperature. What a revolutionary device!"
"Nice pour on this one. Frothy white head and a very pale golden yellow color with a low carbonation. Very lucid. Huge grassy hop note emanates from the beer, along with lively and spicy sweet grains. The taste is very smooth and crisp. Grainy character comes through, with a touch of lemon zest. The body is light and finishes with some oiliness. This is my second Polish lager and I must say this is another winner. Very nice and highly quaffable. A beer of high quality. Very good."
"It has the most enticing aroma, a clean finish with a bit of hoppiness, and a gorgeous head. I buy Zywiec whenever I see it, and I have never been disappointed. It is a very consistent bottle, and a pleasure to drink. My only negative is that it seems a little thin... something that always takes my by surprise."
"I bought this beer on a weekend trip to Poland earlier last year and haven't tryed it untill now. It has a nice golden colour with a nice head. The smell is weak and it smeel wheat. It has a little sweet taste, but not to sweet for me and it has almost no bitterness. I like beer with more bitter taste than this beer, but it is a beer you can drink alot of. If you like strong Polish beers..."
"I drank quite of few of these over the past few months and I can say that I've never been disappointed. Quite a nice looking beer--straw gold, foam for a brief moment--but nothing out of this world. I don't recall anything out of the ordinary about the smell--certainly not anything negative that others have noted. I don't mind the flavour, but a friend who tried it when I first brought it home was immediately turned off by it. A good brew to have now and again, but nothing to die for."
"Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with a small amount of fine, wheat head. Nose is dominated by crisp grains with just a hint of skunkiness. The smell actually outclasses the taste, which is characterized by yeasty notes that the clingy mouthfeel keep hanging around even longer. Its best feature is a bit of hoppy crispness that is too fleeting. For a beer that looks and smells this crisp, the sticky mouthfeel is rather surprising. This is OK, but nothing more."
"Also, one has to note that with the exchange rate at time of review I paid scarcely 1,25 US for a pint. Any qualtity beer that priced this reasonable can not be knocked."
"It forms a large head, which disappears quite quickly. I do like this stuff, I always pick up a few bottles of this at my local store."
"Light gold color, small head. Lager-ish aroma, corn or rice? Typical euro-lager, some malt and hops. Kind of harsh and somewhat metallic. Ah corn. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is a little metallic. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. It does have a high tech thermometer thing in the label for letting you know the correct temperature to drink this stuff, but why bother? Is Zywiec the Polish word for Budweiser?"
"When I saw Zywiec, I thought I would be getting the Zywiec porter that everyone's raved about. Instead, I got this pale lager. Another blah macro lager, and certainly not one I'd rush to find again. On the other hand, the serving thermometer was interesting, but that's about it."
"Yet another imported pale lager. Nice golden color with a decent looking frothy head with some dimples even. Grains, backyards and leafy hop aromas are dominant. Leafy hop bite and cereal grains are the tastes, nice to have no skunkiness here though. Overall, better than some domestic macros, but nothing special."
"This is rather sweet, syrupy, and malty. Kind of a ""rough diamond", if you will. It could use a bit more carbonation. I feel like this beer is too assertive up front, and not assertive enough in the finish. Sweet to begin with and finishes a tad thin. There are some nice violet notes in the hops department. There is also some weird skunkiness going down. Overall, it's decent."
"This lager poured a clear, golden color with white foam that clung to the glass. The smell was a very pleasant malty and floral hops aroma. The taste was biscuity malt and floral hops; nicely balanced and very tasty. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with low hop bitterness but good floral hop taste. The body was medium with good carbonation. The aftertaste lingered. This was a very enjoyable lager: easy to drink and a good session beer."
"Notes: Worthwhile only as a reminder of how weak a pale lager can be."
"If you remember this beer it'll be for the novelty label that shows a red Zywiec logo when it cools down to proper drinking temperature. Cover it with your thumb to warm it up, let go, watch it magically re-appear. And that's pretty much the highlight reel for this one."
"Brown 500mL bottle, I waited until the magical Zywiec logo appeared on the back label whilst chilling in the fridge, letting me know it is the proper temperature to consume. Shows that they put a little thought and effort into the proper consumption. Pours out a clear gold with a fair sized head that is retained halfway through consumption. Nose is yeasty and metallic, with a little bit of butter and a hint of citrus. Taste is buttery sweet with an astringent finish. Somewhat dry. A decent offering for a pilsner, it doesn't blow my skirt up, but I wouldn't say no if someone bought me another one."
"This beer poured a light gold color and fromed a nice foamy white head that left some trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of hops and grain with a touch of caramel. The flavor was of hops, grain and citrus with a touch of sweetness slightly hinting of caramel in the finish. Now technically I believe this to be a pilsner rather than a lager, and I think it does a fine job of it. Some of reviews had me fearful from getting it from less than my steller store manager who would never allow the clear glass to be exposed lone enough to be subject to skunkiness."
"Crystal clear gold with good head retention. Aroma is not too noticeable but if you search, there's some slight yeast mustiness and even a sickly candy-fruity-sweet aroma that I found unusual and appealing. Caramel malts come on as you would expect for a lager of this type and color; hops don't really present themselves and the finish is a bit wet. There is some light crispness in the middle but it does get railroaded. For the finish, the sweetness increases exponentially and leaves quite a fruity trace behind it. Very nice. There is some masterful yeast going on in this beer. I can understand some may be disappointed by the lack of hoppiness in this pilsner-style beer, and that is understandable. Some may even find it bland. Well I really liked it; the yeast is the most volatile, temperamental, complex part of the beer and this beer is nothing less than thrilling if you're into that, like I am. Like a good Belgian, disguised as a bland Euro-lager. Drink with strawberries or maybe raisins (this is just guesswork here; I am not eating either of those things at the moment)."
"Basically how a lager should taste and look. Nice, goldish color with great medium lasting foam. Nice bubbles after pouring into a glass. Decent aroma. First few sips and tastes indicate that it is better than a bud, then the malt aftertaste comes into the play, which is fine for a lager."
"pours out a clear golden color, slight head and little lace. sweet light malt aroma, slight skunk and grain. tastes very earthy...lots of heavy, dirty grain and maltiness...medium body with a very dry finish. seems hard to swallow, but i don't find that undesirable. heavy mouthfeel, and some alcohol notes. quite crisp, and ""heavy"". different from a malt liquor or ice beer. very unique. can't really say that i find it all that drinkable...or really enjoyable. a brutish lager to be sure."
"A great Pilsner in my opinion. Has that nice bitter taste. Color is what you would expect, a nice copper with very little head. I expected it to foam up a bit more. It is one of the better Pilsners I have tasted actually. Would be a great sumer beer and one that you could drink TONS of."
"Every beer should have this for entertainment value alone."
"Maybe it lacks a little flavor for comparative beers from two other beer countries that both edge on Polands Borders. Nevertheless, I like this beer, and it really complements and goes well with a kick ass Chicken Madras I can tell you."
"So I went to the 2 bottles in my OTHER fridge, and, voila, there's the logo! I opened a new bottle to find out how much better it is at this ideal temperature. To find...it was colder, yes, but only so much that the lack of flavor, taste, or any other enjoyable characteristic was well hidden! Good job, Beer Thermometer!"
"My 2nd true import Polish brew. Not very impressed. Seemed remarkably similar to domestic, macrobrew beers. Gold color, little lace. Corn husk smell. Excellent taste, which saved it from being a dissapointing beer. Strong mouthfeel, but nod dry. I would definitely buy this again, but I preferred Lezajsk."
"A cloudless gold or straw color on the pour with a mountainous white head that erodes into fine sheets of lace that cling to the glass. Aromas of malt, and light citrus tones, clean and crisp, with a skinny top. Start is sweet, finish has a scarce hop presence and is overly acidic with a droughty aftertaste. While it is drinkable, its just way to light in all categories to score well with me."
"Ill pass next time."
"I wasn't sure for this beer but after i read the other reviews i was sure this was the one. This beer is VERY sweet compared with other European Lagers. If you prefer strong types of beers and bitter ones then this one is not suggested at all."
"Very clear, golden-straw colored beer with a medium sized white, puffy head. Initial taste seemed very sweet to me, but the sensation quickly fades and the finish is almost tart. Aroma is faintly floral, but it takes a good bit of sniffing to detect. Its a smooth and refreshing beer, but not all that impressive. Flavors and characteristics seem muted throughout. I did like beer thermometer on the label, though."
"Pale straw, just slightly darker than Budweiser, with a fairly mild, somewhat grainy aroma. A smooth beer, especially when drunk at the fairly low recommended temperature (neat thermometer gizmo).  Initially mild hop bitterness becomes more pronounced as beer warms.  Metallic tastes mid-palate, reminiscent of soda-water.  Very little malt body, and a somewhat harsh finish, with a soapy aftertaste.  Medium-light bodied."
"Not an overly impressive pilsner, just a shade below average, colour is fine, head retention is good, mildly hoppy in flavour but somehow lacking in personality....however the temp gauge on the rear label I find amusing.....Don't know why...just does."
"This is still a good beer at a good price and I may buy it when they were out of the other 2 of my favorite pils."
"Good malt mixed with a well bittered presence of hops that will not have you wondering is there malt or isnt there. No small beer this Zywiek Beer from Poland. At 5.7% alcohol by volume with barley and hops well represented, Zywiek Beer will not disappoint."
"Clear, amber color with a thin white head that cannot hold. It does, however, keep a decent collar and some surface foam. Lacing is minimal. The nose is of a lightly sweetish, bready malt and a light herbal hoppiness. The body is medium with a fine & moderate carbonation that leaves it lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is a reflection of the aroma with a softly sweet grainy malt that's supported by an underlying bitterness; and enriched with a non-distinct herbal hop flavor. It finishes smooth and light, and fairly short and dry. An pleasant beer with some nice malt and hop character."
"The bottle was kind of cool... red white and blue attired Polish dancers, and a beer thermometer... a little stip on the back which shows the name of the beer when it's at the right temp.  The beer, hever was pretty boring. Translucent gold, with almost no head.  Very high carboantion, crisp, with a light body.  Kind of malty / grass aroma, with a bit of a biscuity flavor.  Nothing distinguishing or complex."
"At Polonia Restaurant in Hamtramck. My friend ordered this and I poured a little in my glass to taste. It is absolutely interchangeable with Becks. Clean, flavorful, a real Hanseatic emblem. High quality to appeal to the bourgeoisie without unneccassary, earthy complications of non-pasteurization or excessive dry-hopping. It embodies a wealthy, industrial aesthetic that, right now, I find attractive if not comforting."
"Light golden in color, very bubbly and typically clear.  The large bubbled head isn't quite as thick as other pilsners but is persistent enough to leave a decent lace.  Mildly grassy Saaz hop nose upfront followed by a hint of graininess, but there's not much else there aromawise.  The flavor is clean, but a bit bland.  Hop bitterness is clean and light but malt sweetness and body is light as well, resulting in a balanced but prosaic flavor profile.  Finishes clean, dry with a barely perceptible breadiness and a touch of sweetness on the tip of the tongue. Take domestic Bud, get rid of the corn and rice adjuncts and you'll have this brew.  Definitely lacking in both malt character and hop bitterness for a good pilsner."
"Fresh looking with a moderate head. Light amber in color. Kinda spritzy, slightly more hoppy than malty.  Needs more body to be an impressive beer."
"I think this was pretty good, not overly complex, but a nice drink all the same, nicely bitter finish, i kind of dig it."
"My Polish father-in-law brought this over. Decent. Light malt and hop taste with a slight bitterness. Refreshing. Made me want pierogies and kapusta, but necessarily another of these beers."
"Odd little coloured paper thermometer on the back label  Id rather see a freshness date than odd gizmos. Good frothing white head and very good clarity for a beer that comes from Eastern Europe. Orangey and mildly skunky aroma from the hops due to an obvious pasteurization or over boiled hop, a little grassy in the nose. Big fresh cut hay flavours from the hops as well as a think graininess  both flavours dont let up and try to dominate each other. Lightly metallic and salty in the palate. Mild crispness with a light body, malt flavours are mostly dry and grainy, the only sweetness is upfront and it does not stay around for long. As the graininess kicks in the hops double up with bitterness and show some astringency though in a semi cleansing way to the palate. Comparable to the usual mass produced imported lager."
"Zywiec: half liter bottle, 5.7% abv.  What is the deal with the beer thermometer on the back label?  Pale, golden color.  Nice thick head (got the head ½ inch above the rim without breaking).  Cripes, this is the most middle of the road beer I have ever tasted.  Little better than the American Macros, but without the grainy adjunct after-taste.  Lots better beers out there."
"Maybe this could be a lawn mower beer, it has some hops and malt but not a good mix, its lacking something.  The bottle has a ""beer thermometer"" on it, beer does not need a gimmick like this if its good."
"I didn't mind this beer.  Maybe my sample was fresher than others, but there was no skunkiness.  I found a good herbal hop presence and decent body for a pilsner.  There was some adjuct qualities in the finish.  I won't buy it again mind you, but not bad."
"Well...... Not he best light lager on the block. Although mine was not skunky the flavor was just not there. Light malt presence a touch of bitterness but not much of anything to get your attension. I would pick an Okocim Mocne over this."
"Notes: Kind of blah. I mean it's okay, but there's nothing shouting ""Hey! Todd! Have another!"""
