The price this beer usually runs ($6 for four 16.9 oz beers) is hard to beat for what you get. It certainly is not ""swill," just a pleasingly low-key, well-executed European lager.

I had never even considered that aspect of CANned beer, but now I live for it. My initial pour resulted in two fingers' worth of rocky bone-white head that fizzled like the time one of my bunkmates tried to hard-wire his alarm clock into his rack lamp. Arc & spark action, baby! Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see THROUGH the Sunday comics. No, not really, but it was crystal clear, just like the water they purported to have used. My oh my, but I CAN really get used to putting my nose into anything that is not an AAL. This had a pleasant lager sweetness without anything getting in its way. That also included hops, so don't look for a hops fix here, you lupulin junkies. Mouthfeel was medium with a very malt-forward sweetness on the tongue. Finish was incredibly smooth, relatively sweet with a mild hop bitterness at the extreme finish. Baby, where you been hiding all this time? You are getting a special place in my cooler! Relatively low ABV means that I won't stumble off the beach in a stupor.

The mouthfeel is light bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a bad beer. I try not to review beers which I think might be skunked.

3.03,11.4,3,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer was pretty much what I expected it to be: a fairly average Euro macro. Appearance is a nice wheat color, head is average, fairly high carbonation. Smell is rather weak, but clean, about what is expected from a Euro pale lager. Luckily no skunking here. Taste is middle-of-the-road enjoyable. Begins with rather weak hops bite, and finishes mildly sweet with some honey taste. For the money this is a nice, solid euro lager. It won't wow you, but it is a decent session cheapie. By the way, this beer tastes a lot like this brewery's Bavaria beer, except that one is a pilsiner.","Gagnonsux","Jul 13, 2004"

The taste mainly is composed of a sweet corn characteristic. The finish is mostly sweet, but transfers nicely into a hop bitterness that dries out the palate. This brew is completely average. I'd call it a better version of heineken.","Hhawk06","Mar 27, 2004"

The slightly skunky/earthy aroma wasn't too exciting. The taste was slightly malty and sweet with some hop bite and crispness. The finish was dry and inconsequential.

2.65,-2.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Not too much to say about this beer. This is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill lager replicating something from Miller or Anheuser Busch. It isn't bad, but it is far from something good. This review is on a 16 oz can, and that is about 12 oz more than I really need. If you have very simple-drinking guests, this one might not be bad.","ALESwhatCURESya","Jan 25, 2004"

It is mildly skunky with that green glass smell, but it has a nice pale aroma with a bit of hop scent. The taste is average. It is dry and watery, but it has a fair malt and hop flavor. Again, it is skunky, but it goes down relatively smooth. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with less than average carbonation. This beer drinks decent; an average European lager.","WesWes","Jan 18, 2004"

The retention is good and it holds a thin, creamy cap as well as leaving sheets of dappled lace. The nose is clean but offers little more than a mildly sweet, slightly grainy malt that's just lightly infused with leafy or herbal hops. The body is light bordering on medium; and it's crisp in the mouth. The flavor delivers a mildly sweet and lightly grainy malt that's solidified by an undercurrent of hop flavor and restrained bitterness. It finishes with a touch of sweet malt that dries fairly quickly.","NeroFiddled","Oct 22, 2003"
2.82,3.7,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"A light yellow beer with a small, quickly diminishing white head that left no lace whaysoever.

2.63,-3.3,3,2.5,3,2.5,2,"12 oz green bottle. Poured a typical straw yellow, with a moderate head. No lacing to speak of. Fairly descent carbonation with numerous small bubbles. Aroma is slightly skunked, which cleared after sitting. Taste starts off mildly sweet but quickly fades, leaving a faint bitterness behind. Wattery and bland is all I can say! This is another one of those beers you could sit and drink all night, because it's so much like a macro lite beer, nothing there to fill up on.","Indybeer","Jun 27, 2003"
2.26,-16.9,3,2,2,2,3,"Pours a pale golden colour with a thick foam head that fades slowly, some lacing left, and some carbonation is present. The smell has more than a few hops and some maltyness present. The taste, nothing special, is rather watery and bitter leaving behind most of its true possible flavour, and this gives it a less than sterling mouthfeel. Good to try, but just to get it out of the way: won't be at it again.","Andreji","Jun 06, 2003"

2.21,-18.8,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Pale hay color, absolutely clear with a whitish head of 1/8 of an inch of soapy bubbles. Sweet vegetal aroma, slight skunk, and little to zero hops. Flavor is slightly better than the aroma, slightly sour but with some peppery hop sense to offset the absolutely tasteless sweet mash. A bit of a weird hot cinnamon in the aftertaste. Doesn't generate enough flavor for me to have much of an opinion -- other than it doesn't have the dryness of a decent Pilsner nor the drinkability of a mid pack Lager.","ADR","Mar 04, 2003"

This beer is just not happening at all.","Jason","Apr 09, 2002"
