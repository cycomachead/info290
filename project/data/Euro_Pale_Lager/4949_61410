2.93,-9,3.5,3,2.75,3.5,2.75,"as gluten free beers go, I like this one, still has the flavor of barley, not sorghum or some other brutal sugar. however, as regular pale lagers go, this is pretty bad. its over the top sweet, and even with its very pale golden color, it drinks like a glass of molasses. way too much residual sweet here, it kills any subtle malt flavors and makes all the jovial carbonation for naught. almost tastes like a wheat malt base, light and floral a little. it is similar to the mother beer, the regular damm, which I liked quite a lot for what it is. this one lacks the cleanness in the finish that made the other one so great. the sweetness hangs around and the beer feels heavy as a result. still, for the gluten free folks out there I would recommend this, only because there are so few good options for you. omission pale ale still ranks as the best gluten free brew ive had, hands down. this does avoid the usual macro euro metallic malt vibe though, which is a great service to itself and its consumers!","StonedTrippin","Oct 13, 2013"

It had a really nice grassiness to it without being ruined with adjuncts and believe me, I am able to spot the difference at this point! Mouthfeel was soft, lightly carbonated with a grassy, slightly metallic taste on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and definitely lager-like in its mild unobtrusiveness. I will not say that it was the best example of the style that I have ever tried, but its gluten-free status makes it highly recommendable to anyone that has that as a concern. It was decent, but it could be good under the right circumstances.","woodychandler","Feb 25, 2013"

It wasn't outstanding, but it would be perfectly acceptable if I couldn't consume gluten. Actually, it was reminiscent of a slightly-sweet Stella Artois. I'll certainly recommend it to celiac-disease friends who like beer.","TappaKeggaBrew","Jan 23, 2012"

The nose consists of slightly sweet pale malts with a grainy side to it. It smells like a Dortmunder really. The flavors are light with a slightly sweet pale maltiness and a cereal-esque, clean dry finish. It's not too bad. It's like a lighter, easier to drink pale lager. It's really light and refreshing. Overall, this beer isn't too bad and at $8.99 a four pack not overpriced compared to other Euro lagers.","aasher","Jan 13, 2012"

Aromas typical for the style: grains and honey with some light hay or straw. Taste is consistent with the nose and is better than most other Euro-lagers in that it is free of any sort of artificial/chemical funkiness. Easy to drink, nothing super ponderous.","droomyster","Beers"
3.11,-3.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Crystal clear and light yellow in color, with a half inch of white head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is subtle, but offers some light scents of malt and pilsner. Very light in body. Smooth feel and goes down easy. Lacking complexity, but easy to throw back a pint or two. Just a slight sweetness, with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Overall, a good choice if you are seeking a gluten free beer.","Huhzubendah","0"

3.76,16.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I'm trying one of my wife's beers, who has been gluten free for almost six months, and this is easily the most akin to a regular brew. Clear gold, with a thin white head and good lacing. Nice crisp pils malt, zippy carbonation and a surprisingly bold saaz finish. Clean and satisfying. Truthfully, I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between this and a standard continental lager, tasting blindly. Very similar to Warsteiner, in my opinion. If I were gluten free and wishing for "real" beer flavor, this is hands down the most authentic, gluten free brew I can find for my wife, in one of the best beer towns in the US. We've tried just about everything available since she removed gluten from her diet and this is the best by far, in terms of an authentic beer taste. Now if only this magical, gluten removing process were applied to an IPA, Lambic, or another of her favorite styles. Until then, this will do just fine.","UnionMade","Sep 29, 2011"

Taste is again average..not too sweet though which is a blessing, some honey tones and a drying bitterness at the end. OK. Nice on the palate..good carbonation..dry finish. Overall a nice enough lager and if i had the medical need this onen would suit me fine.","Reidrover","Sep 23, 2011"
3.41,5.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O-Very easy drinking, just not anything to get real excited about, which has more to do with the style than this particular beer. Huge plus is that this is real beer that is gluten free, evidently from de-glutenizing the barley during the brewing process. I am currently on a gluten free diet and if I need to avoid gluten in the future, I would prefer to drink this before wine.","velosuds","Sep 23, 2011"

3.4,5.6,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours to a creamy head and pale gold-straw color. Brilliant clarity. Aroma is spicy noble hops and slight sweet grain. Flavor is a bit strange, with a syrupy sweetness offset with a nice blend of tasty European hops. Mouthfeel is light with good CO2 but slightly sticky (why?)

3.06,-5,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours in typical lager fashion, dirty brown with little head and obvious carbonation. Nothing really offered in the nose, not sure what that smell is but all euro lagers have it. Taste is a little more than I expected from a gluten free beer; I assume because it's not sorghum based, and therefore not overbearingly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and surprisingly refreshing. Not a beer I'd search out, but not bad for gluten free.","tdm168","Jun 07, 2011"

And the kicker is, it tastes better than a good lot of the regular adjunct-laden continental lagers out there too. I guess I'm ok with the Frankenbeer approach, where they make a beer with barley, but then strafe it with enzymes or something to remove the gluten - as opposed to heavily compromising, and going all the way with sorghum, or millet, or rice (Heya Budweiser!).","biboergosum","Oct 30, 2010"
