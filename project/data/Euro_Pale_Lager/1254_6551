Aromas of toasted grains, hints of baked bread, and some buttery highlights. Yikes. Flavors are toasted grains forward, with a fruit sweet undertone that I'm not sure is supposed to be there. Floral notes throughout, too, but otherwise light in flavor, jacking up the drinkability to the levels of water.  Light, crisp bodied, with a toasted grain aftertaste. The finish is smooth and clean. Fairly unremarkable, and fairly innocuous. I can see drinking this in large quantities on a beach in Aruba, devoid of other options.","GarthDanielson","Sep 11, 2014"

Very clear with lots of micro bubble action. Smell is crisp with scents of roasted wheat, corn, and malt. Taste is clean with a little bite. Flavors of wheat, roasted corn, sage, black pepper, sweet malt, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel was moderately creamy, and tingly, with a wonderful after taste that was present when I exhaled.

The beer is made by Aruban water - so fresh and crisp! The beer has a deep golden color totally clear and transparent, with a bitterness which is soft to the tongue and nose however with an aroma of fresh hops, a short aftertaste and easy on foam. The combination of all feels fresh and smooth to the mouth when cold, perfect for Aruba's hot climate. I brought a beer back with me to the states to give to a friend who went to Aruba years ago and he shut his eyes and sighed, ""That's the Balashi I missed in Aruba"".
