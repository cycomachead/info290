Smell is light, some malts, a bit of sweetness. Taste is somewhat unusual, metallic, some grains, a slightly medicinal aftertaste. Feels light in the mouth and overall is mediocre at best.","tone77","Feb 14, 2015"

Aroma of sweet biscuit and bready malt with grassy hops and a slightly stale vegetable component. Flavor is sweet, mild biscuit and a hint of toasted malt, finishing with faint malt and slight hops. There is no evidence of the odd stale part of the the aroma. Medium, surprisingly slightly creamy body. A pleasant slightly sweet malty lager and with more character than most macros and Euro pales.

The taste is slightly better, leaning on light wheat, some minor floral bitterness, a light sprinkle of corn syrup, and a subtle metallic twinge. The body is quite light, with a light active carbonation and a crisp finish. As decidedly unimpressive as the smell and taste are, this thing does go down really easily (and, thankfully, pretty quickly, too).

The taste was not bad, but thin: sweetish malt with a bit of floral hops and some bitter hops, especially in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and fairly dry with medium-light body and low carbonation. There was a light lingering hoppy flavor. This was a decent, light, refreshing lager.","UncleJimbo","Feb 22, 2004"
3.48,23.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"One of those plain, simple lagers that is likeable, but not lovable. Pours into the mug with ample carbonation, leaving a pristine white head atop a maple gold liquid. Strings of lace were left on the glass, which slowly crept down to meet with the beer. Fruity, citrus hop smell, with a bit of malt on the front of the nose. Hmm, nice taste. Somewhat complex. Sweet malt, citrus hop, bitter hop, lime, oranges, almonds, pecans and something uniquely else, something unique. Some sort of African grass? It was grainy/grassy, and bitter. Whatever it was, I like it. Crisp, biting mouthfeel that leaves the tongue and cheeks refreshed. One of the best pale lagers I've had. Highly drinkable. If I can find this back home, it'll be a staple in my fridge.","slitherySOB","Jan 17, 2004"
3.46,23.1,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Taste is creamy and grassy. Lightly fruity of all things. Hey, someone hopped this euro-style lager! Nicely hopped for the style but not crisp like a pilsner. An odd combonation that makes for a nice flavor. Mouth is creamy vs. crisp with a bitter hoppy aftertaste. Very smooth and tasty. I, like others, had this at the Moroccan area at EPCOT and was pleasantly surprised. Tasty and easy to drink.","ViveLaChouffe","Jan 16, 2004"
3.63,29.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Aromas of Saaz hops and malt. This follows in the flavor with a decently hoppy bitterness following the malt. Good feel from the highly ample carbonation. The is a reasonably dry finish. Highly drinakble for a pale lager.","AtLagerHeads","Dec 01, 2003"
3.26,16,4,3,3,3,4,"12 ounce bottle. The bottle is a very light brown color with a pretty nifty label.","GCBrewingCo","Oct 19, 2003"
2.83,0.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"I thought this must be a little different, since it was from half a world away, but I guess not. Regular macro-yellow in color, with a fluffy head. Tastes like any US macro (nothing offensive, but nothing with any big hops, malt, or other flavor), only they slapped a different label on it. (The label may be the best part).","TastyTaste","Oct 17, 2003"
3.58,27.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Sampled at the Moroccan Pavillion at Epcot, it poured with an average white colored head that settled over deep golden/amber liquid. Some lightly toasty and sweet malt with light hops in the nose. The taste is medium-dry maltiness balanced by some out of place ale-like fruitiness and a pleasant hoppy flavor. Finishes slightly sharp and bitter, very interesting flavors in this beer.","beerluvr","Oct 03, 2003"
2.48,-11.7,3,2.5,2.5,3,2,"A rather odd, liquor-like flavor here, a distinctive tequila whang, sort of like Tequiza, without the lime and less corn. Beneath the liquor flavors was a huskyness that bordered on harsh, but held back just a bit. Sampled at Epcot as I tried to drink my way around the world, glad this was not the end of the Earth, as it would be a sorry beer to end the day with.","Brent","Jul 27, 2003"
1.95,-30.6,2,2,2,1.5,2,"As good a a beer from Morocco could be, and better than most internationl lagers. Strange flavours of rubber and sand (bit salty aswell). Sweet malts to start. Crisp finish, stale hops, not a very good beer in the end, bland and plain crappy, but as i said before, not as bad as some.","rastaman","May 11, 2003"
3.79,34.9,2,3,4,4.5,4.5,"For once, a Lager that I really enjoyed drinking and rating because of the flavor. When poured into my glass, it had a medium sized white and creamy head with fine-medium sized bubbles. The body had a lot of lively carbonation and it was cloudy. The hue of this beer was yellow-gold and it left a good lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose was lightly malty, hoppy and fruity. The flavor was hops and it was also smooth. The mouthfeel was tingly on my tongue and somewhat thin. The more I drank of this beer, the more I liked it.","hotstuff","Beers"
