"Not bad.  Refreshing and straightforward."
"One of the better examples of gluten free beer. It is very good and is perfect for an afternoon"
"Palate- This is a light bodied brew with moderate carbonation.  not terrible but there are better  beers out there."

"Yes. 5s all round. When a beer drinker gets diagnosed as gluten intolerant it's a rather large downer. Condemned to drink wine, spirits and cider for ever. This beer is a godsend. Love it."

"Being a celiac in Indianapolis - this is the closest thing to beer as you're going to find.  Growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and only recently discovering my gluten intolerance, this beer is a God-send!!!  If you can drink normal beer, I can see how it'd be a 3, but here in Indy, it's a 5"

"Brilliant gold in color with a fingernail of eggshell white.  Excellent clarity and light lacing. Heavy aroma of corn with a hint of skunkiness.  The flavor is corn on the front of the palate and then a familiar well water edge from what I think is Danish lager yeast takes over.  The mouth is thin and watery."
"Mouthfeel: Light+ body, not quite crisp enough for my taste."

"Golden color , small white head. Aroma of grain with hint of fruits and grass. Taste is malty sweet with specific , light sourness. Bitterness in finish and and aftertaste."

"O: if you would've told me this was below the gluten threshold, I would've went ""oh...""... tastes like a fine, malty everyman lager to me... preferable alternative to the slough of sorghum beverages that still mostly fail to taste like cerveza"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It 's actually not bad. I was expecting something horribly and am pleasantly surprised. That said, it is not a great beer. It is better than an adjunct lager so celiac disease sufferers can enjoy that."

"A well-made but ultimately not very interesting Euro lager. This compares favorably to some others in the style, but it’s nothing I would ever go out of my way for, or feel the need to try again."
""
""
"not overly expensive considering the novelty of gluten free ... $5.99 for a 4-pack for me at local big liquour/beer/wine chain Spec's. that's under 13 cents/ounce, which puts it in range of most craft beers."

"Pours a medium-pale straw yellow color, with a thick, foamy head. The aroma primarily features sweet, bready malts, with only a small contribution from a must European hop profile. The flavor is likewise sweet and grainy, with bready malts up front and a more earthy bitterness dominating the finish. There is a fine, sharp carbonation, but the beer feels a little heavy for the style. Overall, this is more flavorful than most Euro lagers, but it is still not something to go to often."

"O: Good drinkability. Standard Euro Lager. I've bought this beer because I suspect that I'm intolerant to Gluten and, coincidentally, I'll be making blood exams this week to figure this out. Interesting enough, I'm feeling quite well after drinking this one. Not because it's a good beer but because I have the impression the the exams will confirm my suspicions. In this case, I feel happy that I can count with this sort of initiative."
""
"Overall this ins very drinkable and enjoyable lager. Much better than my expectations based on some other review. I would really like to drink this one again."
"O: meh....probably will not have again unless in spain, which I don't see happening in the near future"
"as gluten free beers go, I like this one, still has the flavor of barley, not sorghum or some other brutal sugar. however, as regular pale lagers go, this is pretty bad. its over the top sweet, and even with its very pale golden color, it drinks like a glass of molasses. way too much residual sweet here, it kills any subtle malt flavors and makes all the jovial carbonation for naught. almost tastes like a wheat malt base, light and floral a little. it is similar to the mother beer, the regular damm, which I liked quite a lot for what it is. this one lacks the cleanness in the finish that made the other one so great. the sweetness hangs around and the beer feels heavy as a result. still, for the gluten free folks out there I would recommend this, only because there are so few good options for you. omission pale ale still ranks as the best gluten free brew ive had, hands down. this does avoid the usual macro euro metallic malt vibe though, which is a great service to itself and its consumers!"
"this is the best tasting gulten beer i have ever had taste more of a apa like a heny weinhard but i love it a good beer good beer color so if you neeed a gulten beer drink this and even if you dont drink this you wont be disappionted this beer makes me happy so enjoy"

"OK, an average lager/pilsner with no ill effects by being 'gluten free'."
"This is a simple beer, and honestly not in a style I'm a huge fan of."
"This is one of the worst among those for which I have paid more than $2.00/beer. It has a terrible metallic taste that is also overly sweet. It tastes of adjunct, and aside from pouring with a large head and a nice bottle design, it is no better (and actually worse) than most macro beers I can get from a gas station. It has a sticky mouthfeel. Overall, save your money unless you're looking for an offense smelling lager that tastes like corn syrup and the bottle that it comes in."
"O: As a gluten free beer, way more body than I thought before. Nice bitter hops. But a buttery feel affects the rating, in a bad way."

"The finger of rocky, fluffy, bone-white head looked like meringue atop the beer as it slowly fell like a souffle. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose was redolent with Saaz hops, not skunk as one previous reviewer misidentified it. It had a really nice grassiness to it without being ruined with adjuncts and believe me, I am able to spot the difference at this point! Mouthfeel was soft, lightly carbonated with a grassy, slightly metallic taste on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and definitely lager-like in its mild unobtrusiveness. I will not say that it was the best example of the style that I have ever tried, but its gluten-free status makes it highly recommendable to anyone that has that as a concern. It was decent, but it could be good under the right circumstances."
"Overall, for a mild celiac, this is a dream beer in the lager realm. I'm going to have to say in that arena its in the high 3's."
""

"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a pint glass, a date of 8/13 on the back. This pours a light golden color with a mid sized off white head. The smells are of light malts, light hops, a little adjuncts. The feel is medium. The taste is good enough light malts, some green bottle funk, okay."
"Overall I'd say this is a good version of a light lager; not a bold or flashy beer, but does the job of a light thirst quencher."

"Poured a 1"" white head with a decent lifespan. The body is a clear straw yellow color with fairly lively effervescence. It smells faintly of grass and not really much else. The taste is extremely light, a touch sweet, and has a very low hoppy finish but it persists. This is on par with BMC beers, you're just paying a little extra for the import from Spain."
"Tastes overly sweet and adjunct, too. To me, this is little better than the major lagers out there. Didn't know it was gluten-free, but I can't get past the generic taste. No, thanks."
""
""
"Surprise to me. I'm enjoying this beer. By far the best Euro pale lager I've had."
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is heavy with grains. Taste is a bit unusual, grains, wet hay, some bitterness, not very good. Feels light in the mouth and overall I did not care much for this beer."
"Cons: Simple; Expensive."
"O: There’s nothing overly special about this beer, but it’s pretty good considering it is gluten-free. It definitely doesn’t taste like a watered-down adjunct lager macro."
""
""
"I kinda like this because the aroma is not exactly what you get with the taste, quite surprised and like that, although the taste was to light for my palate."
"I'm pretty sure that this beer smells like a skunk's ass. Which is one of this things that you will never smell in your life (God, I hope so), but somehow, you just know that's exactly what it would be like. The flavor, however, is quite nice. Especially considering that this is a gluten-free beer. My experience with these types of beers in the past have mostly been abysmal. But this is a good drinker. The girl at Whole Foods talked this one up pretty high, and I have to say that she was absolutely right. This is the best gluten-free beer I have had to date."

"Still a cool refreshment on a really hot day"

"O: Pretty good for a light lager."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a medium lasting white head with some light lacing visible. Aroma and Taste is fruity, grainsm grassy with some malted barley and light bitterness. Palate is a light crisp body with moderate carbonation. Finishes with some fruity, grainy and light grassy notes and light bitterness. Did not know this was gluten free until after I had it, but overall an ok, slightly crisp lager,."
""
"The body was fairly typical for the style, light-medium, clean, and with a dry finish. Drinkability was very good, you could easily drink these all day or all night. Overall, a nice little beer. It won't get a permanent spot in my fridge, but I can see grabbing a bottle sometimes when I'm in the mood for a crisp, light brew. Worth trying if you see it."
"Overall: very drinkable. A nice beer considering it is gluten free and actually pretty tasty."
""
"I gotta say I enjoyed this Euro Pale Lager because the hop character stood out more than other brands."
"O-when I was pouring this it looked really thin and watery and while it was thin it was not as bad as I thought and the smell was a lot skunkier than the taste. So overall not bad if you need a quick thirst quencher"
""
""
""
"This is not something I'd grab by the 6er but for what it is, it's not too shabby. Best gluten free beer? I'll take their word for it as others I've tried were no ways near this good and I'm not about to make it my life's mission to find a better one.."
""
"Good grass-cutting beer. Beer for the hot days when you want a refreshing light beer."
""
""
"O - Good, but not great lager. Would be a nice beer while doing outdoor chores as it goes down nice, but not what I'd want on most occasions."
""
"O: I'd never had a gluten-free beer, so I gave this one a try to find out how it stacked up. It wasn't outstanding, but it would be perfectly acceptable if I couldn't consume gluten. Actually, it was reminiscent of a slightly-sweet Stella Artois. I'll certainly recommend it to celiac-disease friends who like beer."
"This beer pours a very light bodied and crystal clear bright polished gold in color with a one finger quickly dissipating white head. The nose consists of slightly sweet pale malts with a grainy side to it. It smells like a Dortmunder really. The flavors are light with a slightly sweet pale maltiness and a cereal-esque, clean dry finish. It's not too bad. It's like a lighter, easier to drink pale lager. It's really light and refreshing. Overall, this beer isn't too bad and at $8.99 a four pack not overpriced compared to other Euro lagers."
"received a 4pk as a gift - reviewing while drinking the 4th(not in a row) - pours a straw-yellow with a 1/2-finger head - significant lacing down the glass - has that beer hall smell - lots of grain/cereal - I found the taste almost off-putting, but in this last bottle I'll say it's not terrible - good carbonation helps - kind of a dry finish - so if you gotta go gluten free..."
"Overall: Among the gluten-free beers it truly shines, as I've never enjoyed the use of repellent sorghum."
""
""
"O: With exception of the mouthful, an average euro-pale when compared within style. Mediocre drinkability, an overall average experience and what you would expect."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden body with three fingers of bright white foam that beautifully laces the glass. Aromas typical for the style: grains and honey with some light hay or straw. Taste is consistent with the nose and is better than most other Euro-lagers in that it is free of any sort of artificial/chemical funkiness. Easy to drink, nothing super ponderous."
"Crystal clear and light yellow in color, with a half inch of white head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is subtle, but offers some light scents of malt and pilsner. Very light in body. Smooth feel and goes down easy. Lacking complexity, but easy to throw back a pint or two. Just a slight sweetness, with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Overall, a good choice if you are seeking a gluten free beer."

"I'm trying one of my wife's beers, who has been gluten free for almost six months, and this is easily the most akin to a regular brew. Clear gold, with a thin white head and good lacing. Nice crisp pils malt, zippy carbonation and a surprisingly bold saaz finish. Clean and satisfying. Truthfully, I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between this and a standard continental lager, tasting blindly. Very similar to Warsteiner, in my opinion. If I were gluten free and wishing for ""real"" beer flavor, this is hands down the most authentic, gluten free brew I can find for my wife, in one of the best beer towns in the US. We've tried just about everything available since she removed gluten from her diet and this is the best by far, in terms of an authentic beer taste. Now if only this magical, gluten removing process were applied to an IPA, Lambic, or another of her favorite styles. Until then, this will do just fine."
"330ml single from ""Lifesource",Salem. $2.15 Typical bright yellow lager..with reasonable bubbly white head. Light aromas..mostly hay like,slightl earthy. Taste is again average..not too sweet though which is a blessing, some honey tones and a drying bitterness at the end. OK. Nice on the palate..good carbonation..dry finish. Overall a nice enough lager and if i had the medical need this onen would suit me fine."
"O-Very easy drinking, just not anything to get real excited about, which has more to do with the style than this particular beer. Huge plus is that this is real beer that is gluten free, evidently from de-glutenizing the barley during the brewing process. I am currently on a gluten free diet and if I need to avoid gluten in the future, I would prefer to drink this before wine."
"I was curious about a Spanish gluten free beer and it was pretty good. This was the best tasting gluten free beer that I’ve ever tried. I’ve had a few gluten free beers because a friend needs to drink them, and this one is clearly the best and scores extra points to help those with this dilemma."
"Pours to a creamy head and pale gold-straw color. Brilliant clarity. Aroma is spicy noble hops and slight sweet grain. Flavor is a bit strange, with a syrupy sweetness offset with a nice blend of tasty European hops. Mouthfeel is light with good CO2 but slightly sticky (why?) Overall, This beer is a decent example of the style with some quirks to distinguish it among its peers."
"Overall: Can't tell that this had the gluten removed at all, as it tastes like a Euro Lager should, and a better than average Euro Lager at that. However, this is not my favorite style. This makes me wonder if the gluten could be removed from other beers (say an IPA) and still retain its flavor."
"O- Overall, it's decent- but that's about it. I don't think I'll try this one again, but glad I tried it."
"Pours in typical lager fashion, dirty brown with little head and obvious carbonation. Nothing really offered in the nose, not sure what that smell is but all euro lagers have it. Taste is a little more than I expected from a gluten free beer; I assume because it's not sorghum based, and therefore not overbearingly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and surprisingly refreshing. Not a beer I'd search out, but not bad for gluten free."
"D-Very light and easy drinking beer, but not all that complex, which is all too typical of the style."
"An average pale lager. Which is to say, a beer that I'm fine drinking, but doesn't really impress me in any way. It has the pale malt and noble hop character I expect, but nothing to distinguish itself in a positive or negative sense."
"O: For what it is I thought it was drinkable. If I was going the gluten free route this would be my beer. Seems like a regular euro lager to me."
"Drinkability - A true refresher and thirst quencher. Made for warmer climates for sure. It was pretty good. Easy to drink and could be enjoyed by most anyone. Nice little change of pace for me. It's nice to have one of these easy going, no frills beer on occasion."
"Daura is one of the two best gluten-free beers that I've ever had (can't remember the name of the other one). It's decent and drinkable for those of us with healthy bowels, but is a godsend for beer lovers with celiac disease."
"Consumed at a paella party. Great choice and a gift from a neighbor. Pours a pale golden color with fluffy white head, decent lacing. Smell of anything dominant was not all apparent. Some grainy sweetness. Which shows up in the first taste. Sweeter, malitier and crisper than I expected. Not bad. Smooth mouthfeel make this an enjoyable lager. Went well with paella."
"D: just a heavier version of the Damm"
"Estrella Damm Daura is by far the best of the admittedly few low or gluten-free beers that I've yet tried. And the kicker is, it tastes better than a good lot of the regular adjunct-laden continental lagers out there too. I guess I'm ok with the Frankenbeer approach, where they make a beer with barley, but then strafe it with enzymes or something to remove the gluten - as opposed to heavily compromising, and going all the way with sorghum, or millet, or rice (Heya Budweiser!)."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Sweet grassy nose. Flavor is sweet grass with hops in background. Not a bad gluten free. $2.35 for a 330ml bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH. Best by May 2011."
"It is very good for gluten free beer, and it s an average Euro Pale Lager."
"Now, if only someone would make a gluten free version of Two-Hearted and serve it on tap, or better yet, hand pulled."
"A fine lager that is loosely based on authentic German Pilsners. Simplified and weakened in recipe, the beer can't compete with fuller flavored Lagers."
"D: I'm impressed by this gluten-free offering's taste. I'm not sure how they pulled it off, but the website talks at length about the scientific research they did to remove the gluten from barley. I just wish that the brewers had picked a style to emulate that's more interesting than this. So color me mixed."
