"Not much flavor. Tastes like miller high life."
""
""
""
"Definitely one of my favorite Euro lagers. Kronenbourg is consistent, and has some very endearing qualities. I like the fact that it has a frothy head that lingers and leaves intermittent ridges of lacing. It far less skunky than the average Euro, so you can actually smell and taste the hops. It's light on the palate, nicely carbonated, and very consistent, regardless of how it's served. C'est une biere delicieuse."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has much more complexity than people give it credit for. I happened to think that it was very good. It was refreshing and a very easy beer. Something for the golf course or something."
""
""
"3/1 (Bottle). Light golden pour with minimal head. Nice hops aroma. Very light beer taste and texture."
""
""

"Feels wonderful in your mouth L"

"The European version of Coors light is not for me. Maybe I'm still in my beer snob stage. But I do not drink light beer for the taste. When I drink beer I drink for the rich, malty, maybe chocolatey or nutty tastes. Obviously that's not Kronenberg, but I tried it to try it and my suspicions were verified. Sorry for the rating pulling it down, but I gotta keep it 100."
""
""
""
"A light tasting lager.  Very little carbonation and not much upfront taste.  A smidge of a bitter beer aftertaste.  Decent flavor and enjoyable."
"Leave it to the french to do a trashy blonde euro lager with some modicum of style."
"Good clean lager with high drinkability."
"Enjoy"
"As mentioned in other reviews this is easily the best of the mass produced on the style and always a safe bet, as it is widely available here in Europe."
"Overall this isn't an exciting beer, but it's ridiculously clean and well-balanced. I've never given much thought to the style, but this was surprisingly pleasant and in my opinion, definitely beats its competitors."

""
""
"Best mainstream beer in the UK"
""
""
"I enjoy this beer.  Great taste, good carbonation.  Not too strong, not too weak.  Very enjoyable."
"Had at Chef de France at Epcot... I was hoping for more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all a nice crafted beer and quite an enjoyable drinking experience mainly due, in my opinion, to the complexity of the flavours. Truly a well balanced beer."
""
""
"I like this beer and will look forward to my next drink."
""
"Good served ice cold on the train from Brussels to Paris at 10:30 am.  A good eye opener for sure.  If you are in the mood for a cheap euro lager (and when are you ever not in the mood for that?).  Prefer it to stella or heineken."

""
"decent beer, even for the frogs."
""
"500 ml can poured into a lager glass. Pours clear straw colour with light fluffy head. Very little nose - slightly skunky.  Very little flavour and slightly skunky. Slightly better than some North American mass produced beers but not great."
""
"I was expecting a tasteless industrial lager. But this is crisp and balanced lager with perceivable hops. Didn’t get me off my feet, but I would sure session this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This maybe my favorite session beer of all time-  light but flavorful. Smooth with a hint of hop- great with food- especially pub/comfort food.  A delight!"

"Just ok.  A little bready/biscuity with a pilsner-like floral hop aroma.  Not that bitter.  Probably a little skunked from the green glass bottle."
""
""
"Overall – This was the main beer I had at my wedding. We got hitched in rural France in the summer; the guests were a mix of Dutch, British, Irish and French. With all that in mind I needed a drink that would suit a session so the guests could drink it all day; be refreshing in the heat and suit a lot of different tastes while not being too over powering. I tried a lot of different beers that were available to me in the area and this one came out on top for me. It suited the eclectic taste of the French guests, the crisp pilsner like tastes of the Dutch and the darker hoppy taste of the British and Irish. This was not completely perfect but it was more than good enough to keep everyone happy. That about says it all, this beer is an awesome all-rounder and I have very fond memories of it every bottle now takes me on a magical memory journey and as we live in the UK I’m pleased to say this beer travels well."

"O:  a very solid beer; the green glass bottles are no good and did allow some skunkiness into part of the six-pack, but the beer still tasted good -- a kind of muted pilsener, with some decent bread malt notes and a bit of bitterness but way less than a good pilsener; it's interesting how the green/grassy hop smell doesn't translate into taste ... this brew's good enough that I might seek out others from the brewery, though this particular beer is most likely a one-off for me -- everything it has to offer, while good, I can get in a better German beer"

"From 500 mL can. Aroma of hay and bread. Pours a clear slightly golden pale with frothy head. Slight sweet taste. Light body, oily texture, lively carbonation, and a slightly bitter finish. Seems to me like a slightly creamier and sweeter version of the Euro Lager."
""
""
""
""
"So choose the 1664 blanc over the 1664 original, u won t get disappointed"

""

"Overall: not a bad Euro lager - one of the better macro offerings. At AU$50 a case of 24 x 330mL bottles (2014), the price is pretty darn good too (and funnily enough, $5 a case cheaper than a couple years ago)."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 21, 2014... GLASSWARE: Blanche de Chambly pokal... OCCASION: Willow Lake orientation day...APPEARANCE: cascading bubbles round out a clear golden body; thick white head--exhibits excellent white cloudy lacing... AROMA: fragrant Saaz with soft lemongrass and some wheat yeasts--fresh and energizing (and unexpected)... PALATE: soft, almost creamy champagne-like (unavoidable comparison?) and smooth; light, clean, dry aftertaste... TASTE: a bit maltier than anticipated; refreshing with some fruitiness and honey accents... OVERALLL: a surprisingly strong profile for a beer--a French beer, at that--I had long forgotten since our trip abroad in '03..this beer poured fresh, presented well, cleansed the palate as a pilsner is apt to do, and offered just enough flavor to elicit a satisfied night...."

"For his first sampling of a French beer, Bucky selected Kronenbourg 1664 (""1664""). The beer came in a 500 ml can with a best before date of May 2014 printed on the bottom, and was 5.0% alcohol by volume. 1664 poured an absolutely clear golden colour with some large, slow rising carbonation bubbles visible. Pouring produced about 1"" of bubbly, white head that faded to a thin collar of foam and patchy film within 2 minutes. The retreating foam left some modest lacing behind. This is certainly a good looking beer. Its aroma was of sweet, light malts with hop undertones. I see on the list of ingredients that the beer is made with hop extract...the first time I've seen this in a beer. The beer's taste was sweet caramel malts up front followed immediately by a secondary burst of sweetness, finishing with a mild hop bitterness which lingered as a noticeable, but unobjectionable aftertaste. 1664 was light bodied, had a typical level of carbonation and a bit of a thin mouthfeel. Essentially, this is very similar to, though slightly sweeter than, most European lagers. An inoffensive but uninspiring brew. 1664 sells for $2.60 per 500 ml can...a bit on the pricey side given its run-of-the-mill profile."

"Really didn't like this witbier. Have had a lot of good blondes from craft breweries and finding myself in a pub with no actual microbrews available, thought I give this big brewery blonde a try. Couldn't get away from the feeling I was drinking fizzy apricot water--not just apricots, but dried apricots with the sulphur preservative hints."

"Overall - Might have been a bit skunked, but was definitely a tasty brew, albeit not as good as when i previously enjoyed it. Viable option in the Euro Pale Lager field."
""
"1664 white is really a superb experience as well, both highly recommended."
""
"It's an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is also very nice - initially there is slight sweetness which is followed by nice hoppy bitterness. The finish is also pleasantly bitter making this beer a very enjoyable experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing special about this beer. If not for the harsh carbonated finish, this could be a decent lawn mower beer."

"PS I always give a score of 3 for non-smelling lager/pilsners."
""
"I'm a lager fan and this has to be one of the best I've had from a bottle. Very crisp and refreshing with nice light hops and enough complexity to keep it interesting. Beats Stella Artois handily. The thinking man's EPL, if there is such a thing. Nice downing just one but this would make a nice session."
""
""
""
"O: Better than the American macros; there's at least some flavor to be had here. Fairly aggressive hop character for the style too. Still skunky and watery though, and there are other Euro lagers I'd turn to first."
""
"Taste – rather refreshing with a crisp, slightly spicy finish created by the hops. It produces a tang on the tip of my tongue. I would say it is a little maltier than Heineken but remains very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: drinkable enough, this is probably great on a hot day. It's pretty clean with an emphasis on grain, which I like, but it's a hair to sweet to just guzzle away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My mark out of one hundred would be 55."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a standard Euro pale lager straw with a thin layer of bubbly white foam that quickly dissipates. Aroma nondescript, a sour breadiness, sparkly white grape, maybe a hint of bubblegum. Beer is overly carbonated, making it difficult to nail down the flavors. I got pale malt, dilute lemonade and red sour berry notes, and a floral tang ... Not sure where the hop extract used in this beer hails from but there was a distinct floral top note that added some interest to an otherwise dull Euro industrial lager. Harsh metallic flavors and a bit of skunk, albeit less of the latter than comparable beers. I'd drink this before Heineken but alas that is damning via faint praise."
""
""
"O: One of my go-to European lagers. This holds up well to many European Pilseners and Lagers I've had whilst living in central Europe. I quite enjoy this brew. It is easy to put many of these down, and the interesting flavor never seems to get old. Truly a well balanced beer. One I will be seeking out even as I return to the US. Worth a try? JUST DO IT! You may be pleasantly surprised!"
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice lager, ubiquitous in Paris and quite enjoyable if you are not to busy drinking wine"
""
""
"O - Won't drink it again,boring industrial lager."
""
"Overall not sure how old it is or why I even got it, all I know is these guys make a pretty decent Witbier yet not a good, clean, crisp tasting lager. Pass if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a really great Euro lager. Pass on this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really great beer and one of the better Europ pale lagers I have had. The flavors are so clean and crisp and it is an extremely refreshing beer."

"This is a nice, easy drinking and refreshing beer. Light in colour and alcohol content it has a subtle taste of apricots and sweetness that goes perfectly with the summer sun and a hot day. To be honest, I have difficulty choosing anything other than the blue bottle any time I'm buying beer. This is a solid offering and could easily be enjoyed by someone who does not even like beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty average beer; not much to it really, other than some wheat, bread, and biscuit malts. Easy to drink, cheap, and easy to find, but I stopped ordering them and stuck with the Belgians I could find when possible."

"Overall: One of my favorites while overseas. I tried this one first, and kept revisiting. I'm kind of kicking myself for not trying more while over there, but it's a testament to this beer I think. Great quality while on tap. I can't say how it survives that terrible green bottle if shipped over here."
""
""
""
"Have to retry then repost review because I believe something was off for it to taste that badly. Maybe the french just like weird tasting beer though."

""

""
""
"Very simple beer. Clean profile and refreshing. Similar to an american adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""
"Clear gold body, decent head with spotted lacing. Aroma is kind of shy with mild fruit and cereals. Taste is more of the same but with a grainy mineral-like background. Average overall and inoffensive though not particularly exciting."

"I wouldn't turn this one down on a hot day, but I really can't see paying good money for this one again ($3.29 CDN for the can)."
""
""
""
"Overall, well, not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Just a hint of skunk from the green bottle, and touch of metallic hot lager yeast like off flavor. Otherwise a light profile but crisp fairly clean and drinkable pilsner, with lighter but decent malt profile and touch hops. Could use a bit more overall for just about everything, but still drinkable. Great for a hot summer day I bet, but still could do without the green bottle."

"Kronenberg 1664: This Euro Pale Ale got decent Beer Advocate ratings. I’m switching over from my summer wheat beer habit to other fare, and thought a few pale ales were in order before the big IPA and stout season begins. Coming from France, I was not sure what to expect. What the Kronenberg turns out to be is a Moosehead, basically. The 1664 has an amber body, light carbonation and white head. The aroma is mostly malt. The flavor is spot on Moosehead, with layered malts up front and a smooth finish. Text book Canadian Lager. Why is this? Well, the French did settle eastern Canada, so is what I think of as a Canadian style beer really a French style beer?"

"From the 11.2 oz. green bottle. Sampled on June 25, 2012. The pour is pale to golden yellow with a fizzy white head that sticks around. It looks like it is supposed to so I will give a high mark for that. The aroma is pretty weak as far as traditional lagers go with light malts, crisp hops, corn and grain. The body is light to medium. The taste is grassy, slightly malty, and clean at the finish. The green bottle makes it weaker than it otherwise could be."
""
"Overall, no surprises here folks, just move along."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not worth refusing if it is the only thing on offer, but you can do better, even in this genre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An above average euro pale lager by Kronenbourg. There are some well balanced grassy grain and malt flavours, which sets this brew apart from others in the same style category."
""
""
""
"Overall it hit the spot on a hot day."
""
"Overall: I had this for the first time at McDonalds in Paris. Just now had it to review it. Not bad for what it is."
""
""
"o: a pretty enjoyable pale lager. maybe a tiny step above the typical ""imported"" lagers of heineken and stella"
""
"O: Easy enough to drink and definitely sessionable but not one of my personal favorites. There is nothing very distinctive about this beer - the flavor and aroma are very generic."
""
""
""
"For the style this is really, really good. It has flavor and character. It's drinkable, sessionable, and ultimately enjoyable. I've never been a big fan of this style due to the seemingly regular off flavors (metallic, skunky, grainy), but this beer doesn't have those characteristics. It's worth checking out if you want something light and sessionable."
""
""
""
"O - Another lager with no distinguishing features really. Sessionable but well ensconsed in the pack of mass produced lagers."
""
""
""
"worse than stella and heiniken and carlsberg."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing that really blows you away but in comparison to others in this Euro Lager catagory, this one seems a little better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is appropriately thin and very carbonated. Very easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably a good beer to give to my Bud drinking friends and a beer I could drink a bunch of because it goes down easily, but not my favorite"
"O/D-Just a slightly beefier Euro Lager. Went down easy, and that will be the biggest compliment I will lend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) I've enjoyed this beer here and abroad. I think it is a notch better than most of the mass produced Euro Pale Lagers."
"Been a long time since the Chumley's passport day that first introduced me to this beer. Wasn't a fan then, but maybe things have changed after all those years... It pours a clear very pale straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises rice husk, light funky wheat, and hard water. The taste holds notes of funky wheat, rice, hard water, chalk, and what seems like fake lemon creeping in from some dank room in the back o' the place, ax in hand. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I'm still not a fan of this beer: The supposedly arrogantly quality hops don't come through very well, and things just taste super watery and super adjunct-y (if that makes sense)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It was just pretty average. I wont knock it for what it is. Its a staple in Europe and France but just too bland for my liking."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has a better taste and thicker mouthfeel compared to others in the style."
"O - The beer is okay overall. The taste isn't great which greatly brings down my opinion of the beer."

"I brought a 500ml can back from a recent trip to Europe. The beer pours out looking like a pale clear yellow with decent carbonation that forms a white head that eventually vanished. The smell was weak and slight grains. The beer flavor of the beer was typical of most Euro pale lagers in my opinion. Mouthfeel was a light body and overall it was just ok."
""
""
"O: Decent Euro lager. Nothing to write home about. Will be in Strasbourg in less than a week. Would like to compare to a fresh one at its home, but there are so many other beers to enjoy."

"Served on tap at Brasserie Les Halles; seemed like a good selection to go with a classic French meal. Clean golden color with a thick white head, served in appropriate glassware. Sweet, slightly grainy aroma. Taste was enjoyable compared to some of the other brews in the style. A little grassy, a little bitter, but it at least had some degree of flavor and was relatively light and enjoyable to drink. Not my favorite style, but for a pale lager this was a tasty option."
"O: Well... Overall it wasn't awful, but the smell was distracting. Don't inhale when you drink this beer. Taste was decent, but it maybe a little too sweet. I wouldn't buy again or recommend."
"Overall: Good lager. Bought this for a friend because his wife just got back from Paris and recommended it."
"Overall – Highly drinkable, but not worth the 'premium import' price the bar was charging for it. It's just another slightly above average euro-lager that is a dime a dozen in my area."
"Dr: High price by French standards. Very easy to drink. I'd have it again. It's refreshing and pairs decently with a burger."
"O a decent pale euro lager which is easy to put back on a warm September day - not my style but certainly drinkable and worth a try"
"Overall: Very drinkable and not heavy. Would pair well with casual fare. Good for warm weather drinking."
"I recommend it as a decent tasting lager without much of a flavor challenge."
"Overall: Try it and you probably won't look back. The best French beer I've tried yet."
"smooth and refreshing brew. damn good cold. it's own twist because it's French, I suppose. they like to have their own twists."
"However, I am in love with this beer. This style (and similar styles) are hard to stand out in, but this one does. There's some sort of ineffable magic here. Maybe it's that special hop they talk about on the package. It's simple, crisp, smooth, refreshing and all too easy to put back a few."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a 1 inch fizzy off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random spots and streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. There is a slight skunky aroma upon first opening this bottle. After that, the smell is of sweet grains and some grass/hay aromas. Taste is of sweet grains, grassy/hay notes, and an herbal hop bitterness on the finish. The bitterness is pretty mild and fades from the palate after each sip. I am also getting a slightly metallic taste. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this a pretty good European lager that is pretty enjoyable."
"O - Really nice lager, a great step up from the AAL and an EPL of note, one of my personal favorites. It goes under the radar for most, but it shouldn't."
"Now I remember what stuck out about this beer! The taste is quite distinctive. Its slightly sweet to start, with some graininess coming through. There is quite a lot of hops for this style of beer, and makes for a different flavour with a nice bitter finish. Highly drinkable!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was how the taste was surprisingly distant and clean from the abrasiveness from the nose. While the aromatics offered that classic metallic adjunct lager vibe, the taste was crisp with a cleaner finish. Although the flavors didn’t pop, they were mellow and light enough to keep this beer refreshing and not entirely undesirable."
"Overall: Maybe based on my sentimental memories, but for me a perfect example of the style"
"No, this is not for me, reminds more of a candy shot than a beer."
"Cheers!"
"O: There’s nothing special here but it’s a pretty good beer. My favorite aspect was how clean it was on the finish. Very refreshing."
"D- There is no reason why I would go out of my way to buy this when it tastes like most all barley lagers, but as far as Euro lagers go this is one of the better ones."
"Overall: Goes toe-to-toe with most other European macros."
"Picked up a bottle of this as part of a mixed 6 pack from Crazy Bruce's in Connecticut. This beer pours out looking like a pale yellow water with some carbonation. The head was white and vanished almost immediately. The smell was funky, almost had a sour aroma to it or skunked even. The beer flavor of the beer was a lot like a Beck's in my opinion. It just wasn't anything great or even decent. This was thankfully the first of the 6 I had that night so I have 5 more to get the taste outta my mouth."
"Poured clear golden-yellow with a slight white head, and fizzy carbonation. Grassy aroma, some sickening sweetness. Sweet malts in the taste, very light, grassy hops, moving on to mulch and leaving a skunky taste in the mouth. Light bodied and not very drinkable at all. After one glass, I was done drinking for the night."
"tinny sharp finish. mineraly carbonation. mass produced malt and hops profile. beer is drinkable but totally passable."
"Overall a good clean Euro lager. Have had this in French countryside before, so the bottle brought back good memories."
"Overall: Meh... This is your average adjunct lager under another label. Save the money you would spend buying this import and buy domestic; you'll get practically the same thing."
"O: Overall this seems to be a nice Euro Pale Lager minus the right amount of hops bitterness. Malt quality and water and brewing process is fine but hop bitterness is low but that might be the standard for a french made lager. Still a nice drinking beer."
"The beer starts off like you would expect from a French lager. Pale gold color, fluffy white head, just a hint of skunk familiar with green-bottled European lagers that you get here. The taste, however, is a bit surprising. There's still that light sweet grain, but there's some honey and a little bit of spice, too. Just a touch of clove, maybe. The mouth feel is fuller than similar beers. Really good lacing, too. Worth a try if you want something light, refreshing, and with at least a modicum more character than anything with ""light"" in the name."
"Poured from 330 ml can into my pilsner glass. Nice fluffy white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Some very mild lacing. Light golden color. Smell is eurolageresque, slightly sweet with just a bit of bitter aftertaste. Tastes a little sweet, but acceptable or slighly above average. Mouthfeel is nice, light, and slightly bubbly. Overall a decent beer, I could drink a few lounging around the house or on Rota beach. One side note is that the can said 5% vice the listed 5.9% ABV."
"D-Good, extremely drinkable."
"RJT"
"Very enjoyable on a hot spring day in Texas. It's what Bud heavy is supposed to taste like. Simple and good. I'll be back for more."
"Appears a light orangish yellow with a soapy head and lacing. Aroma of euro hops and pale malts. In the taste, pale malt, a trace of hop and a mild cooked veggie taste. Not the cleanest example but it's alright. Mouthfeel is light bodied and feel is soft with medium low carbonation. Average is written all over this one. eh."
"Overall not the most interesting Of beers but it nails the balance between drinkability and taste. I would prefer more flavor and complexity but It is what it is."
"O: Pretty foul stuff, though probably not the worst beer I've ever had."
"Drinkability- Enjoyed two back to back. Would like to try in a can or on tap if available. Could easily start off a night with a few of these but wouldn't go straight to it. Got a nice buzz from these two beers as well (or maybe it was the bottle of wine earlier in the night?)..."
"All in all, this is pretty decent lager with all standard qualities and with good drinkability."
"I'd say this beer is very drinkable. I'll try it again."
"D: This beer is certainly clean enough and easy to down. However, it's so bereft of flavor that I have no real desire to revisit it."
"It is easy to drink, but I find the smell and taste of this one too pungent. Also, the few times I've tried single I co-incidentally felt really rough afterward, so I have no need to try it again after this review."
"I am French-American but to be honest, I did not expect much (France is more of a wine nation obviously)...I was very pleased however to find that I very much liked this beer. :)"
"Overall I liked this beer very crisp and light for being aalmost 6% I would recommend this beer"
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D: Much better from the taps than any other kind of serving type, I've had the beer in London in three forms - cans, bottles, and on tap, and while the bottled and canned versions still taste better than most, getting a draft of 1664 is the way to go. Definitely a must try if you have access to it on tap."
"Drinkability: I enjoy this beer a lot. I could drink quite a few of these without regret"
" D- This beer has well blended subtle flavors but a good depth and a lot of flavors I look for in a good Kolsch. I was very surprised and impressed this came out of a green bottle."
"D- Very drinkable, well balanced basic lager"
"I had a lot of trouble separating the ingredients on my tongue to analyze the taste at all. Stick to wine, France. Stick to wine."
"This beer pours brilliant gold with a loose single finger foamy head which remains for nearly the life of the beer. Nose is grainy with a hint of citrus and grapefruit. Grain with floral notes and corn flavors. The beer is thin and falls down throat with ease. Has a sweet finish and leaves palate cleansed. This is a decent pils, wouldn't turn it down."
"Refreshing and very drinkable. I'd say it is better than most beers of this style. Just don't expect to be knocked off your barstool."
"12 oz bottle. Would never bought it myself, but my friend braught it over. Not very appetizing color. I'm not sure if there were any aroma. Maybe very slight, bread and sweet malt. Very watery on the palate. Taste of sweet corn. I could not finish the bottle."
"Color is somewhere between straw and golden. Crystal clear with a bleached white head with good retention. Light lace. Aroma is predominantly resinous/grassy with a touch of grain. Some metallic notes are also present. Clean up front with a nice amount of carbonation. Hoppy middle that quickly fades to a grainy finish. A mouthfeel is a bit soapy on the finish. Medium body."
"Very drinkable, my fears of this being another skunky European beer in a green bottle were unfounded. I imagine I will buy a few more of these from time to time!"
"pours a nice goldish orange color with very little head. Smell is a bit skunky almost like a Heineken or a Straub. Taste is light and more on the sweet side. Very smooth and is extremely easy to drink. Very refreshing and is an easy beer to sit back and drink."
"Bottle solicited from Cold Storage in Singapore"
"Half litre can. Looks like a typical euro lager, clear, a bit pale and lots of bubbles. Can taste hints of caramel and chemicals. Lots of carbonation. Can drink a few pints of this but not too many, it's not the best. Ps it's the 5% abv brewed in GB version, would be interested in trying the brewed in france version"
"Taste, weird yeast strain seems to jump on my tongue, not allowing any taste of very light Saaz hops I'd guess to do anything. Slight breadiness. Just really put off by the taste. Evolves into a slightly more tolerable bitter hay feel. Dry, but eh. Had this at the Paris, France casino in Vegas. . . might have been old, but it just wasn't agreeable with me."
"Extremely drinkable. Best euro lager I've had in recent memory. Would make a great session beer."
"Drinkability- wow a very very nice lager drinkable to the extreme with a very lot of flavor for the style, definitely worth trying and so much better then most lagers out there today"
"Taste is similar, pleasant, lightly sweet appley grain with light, zesty grass and lightly spicey herb hint. It has light bitterness underlying the sweetness. Hay and grass dominate the aftertaste. The character that it has is pleasant, firm, and with enough going on to keep it interesting while it is highly drinkable. Feel is fairly good, solid, and not watery or rough."
"The hops are mild and add a spicy blend to some of the alcohol flavors that smooth it out and add too drinkability. All this said, everything else is quite typical. A pretty crisp and refreshing beer that I would reccomend to get to know the style."
"D- Very easy. Not my favorite style, but very easy to drink."
"It's like a French Miller Lite. It's not bad for a French beer seeing that the French have very few beers that they actually brew inland in comparison to other countries"
"For the record, the other two Kronenbourgs I've tried were Kronenbourg, and Kronenbourg Blanc, both in Paris. As far as I can recall, I like this one above both of those."
"Pours a nice gold color with an one finger to one and a half finger head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of musty adjunct malts and a hint of hop and sweetness. The taste is a adjunct malt backbone with a little hop bite and a nice candy sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is good, its a nice easy drink, nothing to reall dislike, and the flavor is enjoyable. You could easily do a session of this, a nice flavor for this class."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. The foam that was produced was a fair amount of a 1/2 finger. The smell that aromatics from the beer is that of wheat and fruit tones. The taste follows that of the aroma but adds in a maltiness to it. Giving a warmer feel on the tongue. Overall a good beer to sit back with during the hot summer days."
"D-Not a bad tasting beer at all. Nice flavor. I don't know about style conformity because of the flavors but a good beer. I would drink this again."
"MF/D: very flat in taste, though that may be due to the can. the flavors (what little there are) do not linger long on the tastebuds."
"d- i'm enjoying this one, sessionable for sure, really refreshing and tasty, maybe cause it's french haha. who knows, but i would drink this one again!"
"D - Not a bad beer. Could easily drink a few in a sitting."
"D: When it comes to Euro Pale Lagers, I've had quite a few (since I live in Europe), this is one of the better ones."
"D- This beer I find to be rather average. The flavors in this beer didn't mesh well for me, but I suppose the general nature of this beer permits to be drinkable to those who find the flavors acceptable."
"D - High drinkability if you are having several beers."
"A good beer for quenching thirst on a hot day, nothing impressive."
"pitchers at Galaxy Hut, Arlington"
"D: On the right night, this is quite drinkable."
"Light flavor. Some husk and vines, and again with some clove. This isn't outstanding, but it's not bad. Easy drinking without that over stale malt aftertaste I expected."
"O: Quite drinkable and honest Lager, which is something really difficult to find. Recommended"
"Not a bad drop but a little more pungent in the proper French version. But unfortunately don't have the real stuff here, very difficult to get the real thing here in Australia."
"I was hoping this would be a decent offering since their new wheat beer is actually not too bad."
"Drinkability - not one that I would go back for in the store, but if it were on tap, I could certainly enjoy a pint or two of it."
"Too thin and sweetish without balance. At $2.55 a half liter this is totally overpriced."
"Final Grade: 3.62, a B."
"I imagine it would taste a bit better in France and that maybe the trip to Virginia took it's toll on this one, but who knows."
"What is up with imports with green bottles being so skunky? This is why people turn their noses up at craft beer. This is posh to most BMC drinkers but have no idea what else is out their after judging all on stuff like this. There are way better euro lagers out there some are actually pretty good but not this skunky mess."
"Changed my ratings as I wrote this. I would drink this over heineken any day. Fairly smooth and balanced, just lacking intensity. That first whiff of skunk was nothing. Other than that, no offensive elements here -- just wish they made this a bit stronger in flavor. Real surprise -- not that bad at all."
"D - Very drinkable. Perfect if you're looking for a light foreign lager on a hot summer day. Refreshing and delicious!"
"Drinkability - Absolutely, the beer that is adorned in every brasserie in Paris has a spot in my fridge anytime."
"I poured apprehensively into a pint glass to a pillowy white head. European beers with green bottles always make me cringe. It is gold in color. The aroma is weak, bready malt. The taste is sweet and bready. It has that metallic taste that often accompnies green bottles. The mouthfeel isn't bad but I can't get over the taste. This is probably my last dabble with Kronenbourg."
"Drinkability: OK. I don't think I'd try it again. Nothing special."
"Drinkability: Average Euro pale lager that I am not likely to get again. I love the glass, unfortunately not the beer. I would not turn this down if offered to me but will not likely pick up again."
"Has a good refreshing lager flavor."
"D- Fantastic, I can drink this beer alday without becoming tired of it"
"Wouldn't mind drinking more of these if I was drinking all night... But this is not something I will buy again or stock in my fridge. It just seems like a generic all-weather, no reason, all-season beer that just wouldn't get called upon to do battle with my thirst. But the 5.9% ABV earns it some extra points, because it is quite smooth!"
"Finishes nice, beer is light in the body, light in flavor overall. No aftertaste, finishes completely. Wet, not dry, drinkability and mouthfeel are good. Its just boring."
"Another French beer, usually not the best...Very corny on the nose, smells like pilsner malt and adjuncts. Very watery with a good crispiness like a nice pilsner, a definite corn like taste comes through. Hard to believe the abv. Not much to this one, but nothing bad either, a very crisp and clean taste, seemingly void of unpleasantries of most green bottle macros. Even though it is February here in New York, I could see this going very nicely with a light dinner in an outdoor café somewhere on the French Mediterranean. Holds a decent head for the style."
"Had this beer in a restaurant, on tap, the 1/2 pint. 1 finger head, nice light blond color, good smell. The thing I liked about this beer was the taste/ it is ncie and easy, there is no weird taste like the Stella Artois. I would recommend this beer to a friend."
"D: Not one that I would reach for again. I always enjoy trying something different, but when I try something different that turns out to be just like every other pale euro lager/beer, then I need to do better research on the brew before buying it. Good thing I just bought this as a single for 1.79. Last time I will do so."
"Notes: Easy to drink and inoffensive beer, but nothing special about it. If you want something light and easy to drink at a bar, this isn't a bad choice."
"I don't dislike it, I just don't find the flavor anything special. It has a great color, it is fairly drinkable, has a decent mouthfeel, and smells like your average euro pale lager."
"Tasted at ""Le Village Buffet", Paris, Vegas, once poured in a pilsner glass: Look: Bright golden color, just like french gold, the foamy head looks like a snowflake with a finger thick, good lacing; Smell: Sweet malt, grass-herbal hops; Taste: Sweet malt, slightly smoked, herbal hops and some lemon; Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing, light body and high carbonation; Drinkability: I regretted paying $ 6 dolars for this beer, nothing special, but finally walked though the onion cream i ate."
"It's the first thing I've consumed all day (a part from a glass of water) so I don't think my palate is tainted. This just doesn't taste much. Not bad though. Having tried it a while back, I thought I really liked this beer."
"D- This is a drinkable beer. Would I want to drink it all the time? No. Maybe a couple times a year if I'm in a pinch. Most macro drinkers will enjoy this beer though."
"Pours a very clear macro yellow with a white head. The aroma is basic macro with some hops in it. The flavor is more basic macro with some grassy hops in the finish. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the better beers I have had in this style. I was worried about skunking due to the green bottle but this one survived alright. Not a beer I would like to have again, but not terrible either."
"Notes: Euro pale lagers are a hard lot to rate, just because they are all pretty mild, so I'm not expecting one to jump out at me. However this one seems to do everything, except maybe smell, better than the average European import. While I wouldn't say this beer is outstanding in any regard, it is a good choice for a refreshing import."
"This is an OK drink. I wont have it again but the French can drink it all day long."
"Drinkability: These go down pretty nicely and get moderately high drinkability points. Not the best European lager that I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. Worth a try if you're a fan of the style."
"D - A simple European lager, but it's pretty refreshing if that's what you're looking for."
"Yuck the smell of adjunct grains and that in a mock Helles for a Munich man - yep that s Reinheitsgebot central! Whatr can i say other than OK to look at but with athin body wa<tery and the sickly aftertaste of adjunct grains. Drinkability goes down by the sip since the sickly aftertaste keeps lingering - drink only in emergencies!"
"Overall: A very good Euro Pale Lager, and the best example I have tasted yet. Also the best French beer I have tasted to date. If you like this style but have constantly found it to be disappointing, try this beer."
"Aroma is a little skunky. It pours a pale straw yellow. Taste has malt, big carbonation. Fairly bland lager, not much character other than the skunky smell gets in the way of tasting a lot of the flavours. This is not the best that France has to offer."
"Wouldn't turn one down if offered, but definitely not my first choice, even for a lager."
"As for drinkability...with enough belgian beers being available here, I'd take any of them over 1664 or any French beer for that matter. The taste, smell and appearance are mediocre, and much is left to be desired."
"I don't expect much from a big name French beer but this was not bad for a macro"
"D- Had this on tap in Vallauris, South of France, on a very hot summer day and boy did it hit the spot. Crisp clean and refreshing."
"Drinkability: High. I could drink this beer all night. Goes equally well with pizza or the obligatory fish and chips. I can't believe it's from France!"
"Pours a crystal clear, pale yellow with a modest head that quickly fades to a collar. The aroma was le skunque. The taste started with that lager sweetness, but an underlying bitterness kept pushing forward. The feel was light bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability was fair. All in all, it reminded me of a Heineken that I choked down years ago. Seriously, it wasn't that bad, just seemed like it. Late note: 1664 improved a little as it warmed, I gave an extra 1/2 point for taste."
"I'd never buy a six of it but I wouldn't turn one of these down either."
"This beer poured a light transluscent straw color with a very small head and a ton of visible carbonation. The smell is a little skunky with some malt and grassy notes. The taste is crisp and clean, but there isn't a lot there. Some malt in the beginning that gives way to a very clean finish. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp and the beer is very drinkable. If you can find a cheap six-pack you can have a decent night, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to enjoy a single anytime soon."
"The drinkability is very high with such a mild unassuming flavor, and the satisfication factor is equally high. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but the carbonation helps to liven the palate. Definitly a beer I'd recommend."
"D - Good complexity of flavor that is very drinkable in a light bodied beer. Overall a nice Euro beer."
"Bold sunflower yellow (bordering on orange), filled with champagne bubbles struggling to support a full and pearly but ultimately volatile and short-lived head. The nose is fruity and sweet with a harsh twang of minerals (it smells a bit like dishwater) but otherwise pleasant and robust malt and hop aromas. Caramel and loads honey meet up with a fresh lemon-thyme quality, carnations, and even a bit of parsley. The off-aromas fade over time to make this rather nice to smell. Firm and full-flavored, with a bready malt quality and a nice smack of citrus hops. Very good except for an intrusive metallic twinge and a bit of soapy astringency. A bit heavy on the palate; carbonation is airy, but the body is sodden and thick. However, it is still refreshing, and this beer's flawed but pleasantly robust flavor keeps it quite drinkable, especially if very cold."
"Not quite as bad as I was expecting, but not something I could recommend in good conscience either. Too reliant on the perfumed acetone character, and certainly prone for a quick passover, should we meet again."
"D- an ok beer and ok for the style, the aroma is the heaviest thing on this one. refreshing and thirst quenching."
"Mouthfeel is a light body with a sharp carbonation"
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with sufficient head. There is a flavorful yet light and crisp taste, with a slightly bitter after taste. There was not much in the way of aroma but this was a very drinkable beer that I will certianly buy again."
"The biggest disappointment is the artificial color and glucose syrup added. Other than that, this is not a horrible beer. I am drinking the 5.5% French version rather than the 5% import and it pours a deep gold, one inch head, with a mild sweetness, tinge of green veggies and a mild hop mouthfeel that lingers longer than usual and finishes with a malty, carmel burst. I have had it in bottle, can and on tap and the biggest difference was the tap was a bit dryer and the lacing was much more intact. If you are seeking a good French beer, look for Pelforth Blonde."
"Pours a clear golden color with one inch of white head. Retention was not that good but heavy lacing is left on the glass during consumption. Has a pleasant noble hop aroma. Some graininess but overall a decent aroma. Definately on the dry side of flavor which will automatically gain some points when it comes to lighter lagers. Good hop flavor of pepper and other spices. Light body with ample carbonation. This beer is an easy drinker. Definately one of the better European pale lagers I have drank."
"Drinkability: decent beer. More of a beer I would be drinking after mowing the lawn or as a session beer"
"D: nice combination of flavor and drinkability. it's like heineken but tastier and cleaner. i could throw quite a few of these back."
"M/D: The beer had a light body to it, clean, refreshing and smooth. The beer was very easy to drink with a slight bitter aftertaste. Would be good on a hot summer day. Well done."
"pours beautifully as golden yellow with a thick head that stays, and leaves it's mark as you work your way through the beer. It smells very grainy. It taste smooth with quite a bitter after taste but not to overpowering. Just enough bitter to let you know it's beer and not watered down. Smooth with easy drinkability."
"Poured from slender CLEAR bottle into pint glass. yellow golden color with a super thick, resilient head. Smell was earthy and grainy, dry and clean with a mild bitterness. Taste was fairly light bodied but crisp and refreshing, not at all bad for a light lager. very flavorful and earthy, grassy, bitter aftertaste. Very nice light lager, excellent for what it is, I will definitely have one again if I get the chance."
"Overall, a nice brew. Not really a style that I'm in to but I didn't take away from my rating. Clean, crisp, refreshing and well balanced. Would love one of these on a hot summer's day."
"D - This is an ultra drinkable beer. Would be great for summer days or an evening of drinking."
"Definitely the best of the pale euro lagers I've tried. A good fridge filler if you can get a good deal on it."
"DA nicely balanced and not to thin helps alot"
"Ordered a bottle while at lunch with friends. Poured into a standard pint glass. Yellow color, lots of carbonation. Pretty large head, but that disappeared quickly. Not much lacing. Really lacks in the smell department; not much there. Taste was just average. Typical macro lager flavors, bit of corn, not much hops. Pretty watery body, which makes it semi-easy to drink but kinda blah on the palate. Got it because I have not had one in years, and I don't plan on another any time soon."
"Drinkability - a fine product, all-in-all, I would have this again. Gotta plan ahead to late July- early August to have another."
"Not too bad really as I was expecting something much much worse."
"Poured a color of golden straw as others have noted. However, after tasting it, I might rather compare it to the color of skunk urine. This is most likely a case of my palate overiding my sense of sight, but it can simply not be avoided. I generally follow the ""respect beer"" philosophy, but this is absolutely horrendous. I'm sure the trip across the pond doesn't help in the taste department, but I enjoy plenty of other European beers, which allows little credence to an extended shipping process as an excuse for the taste of this beer."
"A little side note, having had this in France, Germany, Holland, England, and in Minnesota, Freshness seems to make a huge difference in the flavor. The green bottle makes the beer susceptible to ""skunkification"" for the lack of a better word if it has to travel too far to be enjoyed"
"That said, I'd like to try this again on-tap. I'm hoping it was just a case of improper storage and not the actual character of the beer that gave it such a miserable taste."
"Given as a gift in a ""Beers of the World"" package. I would avoid this package at all costs!"
"Pours a typical clear straw-yellow with a little white head - nothing special. Crisp aroma is typical of a macrobrew lager. Flavor is, well, lagerish, no complexity, not much bite, fairly tame. Texture is smooth and tingly, at least not watery, but still not memorable. OK."
"Pretty solid atmosphere. Solid flavor and feel. Really nice drinkability. Light, and refreshing. You could really power these down, if that type of thing does it for ya'. All-around solid quaff."
"Overall a nice brew though I am disappointed to see glucose syrup as one of the ingredients."
"D: A fairly easy euro-lager, moderate drinkability by style, dry with a nice herbal hopping drinks more like a pilsner."
"Mouthfeel is inexistant, tast is impossible to be declaimed as it's totally not present... Smell has nothing special and appearance shall be a good one, but... hmmmm awful"
"The name cracks me up, a name like that for a french beer? Anyway onto the review. Nice bright yellow color, with a nice 1 inch head. Smell was not good, smelled like apples, and metallic. Slight hop aroma in there too. Not good. This was a weird tasteing beer. I've never tasted anything quite like this, it literally tasted like apple flavored beer. It was just weird. I did not enjoy it. Mouthfeel, was nice and full with a good level of carbonation. Decent. Drinkability, even when cold i really couldn't drink a lot of these, it just tasted too much like apples. I wont drink this again."
"Pretty skunky lager. Smaller bubbles now they say, since the new recipe for Kronunberg 1664 it seems to have started tasting worse, it used to be just about an ok lager. Real disappointment here. A bit like Stella Artois but somehow quite a bit worse in the end, if thats possible."
"Seems to me that this is what the American macro breweries are aiming for when they brew their pale lagers... except this one is really good."
"Conclusion: In my opinion, this simply isn't a style that lends itself to greatness. That doesn't mean that they're not drinkable; often quite the contrary. It's just a style made for mediocrity it seems. Euro pale lagers are great for washing down burgers and fries, pub food, or when you want an easy drinking session beer. That being said, this is probably my favorite example of the style. It's got a little bit of depth, and nice clean flavors. I would deft. choose this over St. Pauli Girl, DAB, Heiniken, etc if given the choice."
"This was a pleasant surprise, mainly because there was no green bottle skunk. One of the better Euro Lagers I have had."
"This beer is representative of French food and culture in general. With the beer, as in their cuisine, flavors are much more subtle than in America."
"One of the better European macro imports I've tried. Has the same sort of bland taste they all seem to have, or lack of taste I should say, but this one has a little more body and mouthfeel to it. It went down very smooth and had a nice crispness to it. Wouldn't seek it out but if offered some I wouldn't turn it down for sure."
"I had this beer when I visited Budapest at a Greek resturant. Weird..."
"Came across a cold and sweaty giant mug of this brewski at Teske's German restaurant in San Jose.It's a very light transparent yellow gold with a fair white head and good lacing. The aroma is deep wheat and light grass hops. The flavor follows suit, much the same, well carbonated, lively and refreshing, very drinakable. Clean and satisfying."
"I was very impressed by this beer. I had low expectations I guess, and it proved to be a very good pilsner. I wanted to give it higher scores on aroma, taste and mouthfeel, since they all fit the style precisely, but I must reserve those higher numbers for beers that somehow go beyond what is expected, right?"
"But hey, if you're into that kind of thing..."
"Drinkability: While 1664 isn't quite 1337, it's better than a sizable portion of the endless parade of Euro lagers available."
"Pours a clear sunshine and hay yellow. No head or foam and very sparse bubbling. The aroma has grassy hops with gypsum pilsner malts and soem dried fruits in there too. Dry malts a mixing with very soft herbal hops. Maybe some fruits here and there. Pretty plain palatebut prettyeasy to keep drinkng. Doesn't taste as bad as it warms like other mass produced lagers worldwide."
"Another brew that'll get tossed in a mix-and-match case every now and then, but which I'd never get a) in a bar or b) in a pack by itself. Threes across the board."
"Decent pale lager, easy to drink."
"This beer pours with little head, but the deep golden color is very pleasing. A slightly malty nose draws you in to a full smooth mouthfeel that delivers a pleasant taste on the palate that is not overly complex, not dry, and even with a hint of sweetness in the malt. It finishes with just a hint of bitterness. This beer is a bit too heavy to be considered refreshing for hot-weather drinking, but it's plenty refreshing for the milder late-summer weather in Paris, which is when and where I drank it. The effect is increased by the nicely measured carbonation. Overall, a very nice and drinkable beer for the mild seasons."
"All in all, I was surprised. As my first beer from France, I didn't know what to expect. A light beer, but very clean and not too bad. If you like a slight grassy flavor to your hops and a light beer, give this a try."
"Finished clean and light. At a little french resteraunt was an OK palate cleanser and went well with the food a little better than the Pike pale ale I drank before. I wouldnt pick this up again but it was worth a try."
"Poured like a usual lager, golden with an average white head. Nose was citrus, some slight wheat even with a decent malt backbone. Taste was of light malt and grains like rice. Overall it was a an average lager. I would probably go for something else given the chance or selection."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Clean and crisp on the palate with a dry finish. The beer is light in body, with high levels of carbonation that seem appropriate. This (thus far) is my go to Euro Pale Lager. When I want something good, light and refreshing for a hot day, with an overall light flavor, I'll reach for this."
"This beer pours a thick fluffy head but disappears quickly, while lacing heavily. The color is a dull gold. It smells sweet and has a dank like aroma. The balance of the beer seems to be accurate with no overpowering of hops or malts. This is a very light beer that is easy enough to drink, however it seems a little light for my tastings and I don't plan on buying anymore of this."
"D: Goes down smooth enough all right, but the taste would keep from drinking much."
"This was my first French beer. As much as I would like to say it's my last, I will not do so. I'm not so ""close-minded," and I'm sure that there are some (at least one, hopefully?) good French beers out there. Over time the smell seems to die down a bit, but it still doesn't taste that great either way. Use your discresion if you choose to purchase this beer - I certainly won't buy it again (even though I'll still try other French brews)."
"not impressed."
"D: I remember enjoying this beer in the past but I can't say I enjoyed the beer. I might have another bottle to confirm that this bottle just hadn't gotten super skunked."
"If you're going to drink a major market lager, this would not be a disappointing choice."
"The drink is crisp and thin-bodied with good carbonation, making it a very easy drinker."
"The beer was very pale golden colored with a grainy smell but very light on the nose. There is some white head and a bit of lacing. The label on the beer (bought in Canada) mentioned glucose syrup. I think that pretty much nails it on the head. The beer had a really bad adjunct flavor to it, maybe some cheap hop like extract, and a light wheaty maltiness. There wasn't heaps of taste to this beer, and when it settled ... watch out. The beer became quickly undrinkable. This was really bad euro pale lager, and I can't think of any reason to return to it. If you like the style, there are plenty of better macro euro style beers to choose from."
"Recommended..."
"This is a decent gas station beer, and was a good alternative to the high cost of beer in restaurants in Paris."
"Pours a crisp pale amber with a decent frothy head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is a slight bit of sweet malts and fruit, but not much else. The taste is a somewhat enjoyable balance of sweet malts and citrus hops, just not anything all that special. The beer is light and crisp, and I wouldn't guess it's almost 6%. This is a decent beer, but not something I'm likely to drink again."
"I pour this beer in a pilsner glass. Poured a solid gold color. It was darker then I expected. Smell was of hops, but not great. The taste was good. Shows good hop balance and a bit of sweetness as well. More sweetness then I expected as well, but it was all in balance with the rest of the beer. Mouthfeel was just ok. Overall this is a very drinkable beer. Another beer that seems to go down well. Should make a good summer brew."
"A solidly drinkable beer, if only that it is always on draft in France."
"12oz green bottle obtained at Tiger Town in Gardiner. Pours a golden-yellow body with a good half inch of nearly-white somewhat rocky head that slowly dissipates clinging to the side of the glass to create some nice lacing. Great looking for a Euro-lager. Smells somewhat sweet, peppery, some cooked vegetable... Tastes sweet, sweet caramel malt, some pepper, hints of hops and DMS/cooked vegetable. The more I have, the better it tastes. Light in body and very drinkable. Definitely could see having a few of these on a hot day, but for the price I'd probably go with something domestic instead."
"Overall- I've heard raves about this beer and it doesn't measure up, the sourness is unpleasant and other than that there is nothing that jumps out at me. Not worth the price or the reviews."
"Oh, Et La Bouteille..Très Chic! ( That Bottle Is Really Stylish)"
"Overall a slightly above average euro lager."
"D - Average I suppose, to be honest I probably wouldn't go for this again, being that the sea of euro pales is a large one. Not a bad brew by any means, but it's lacking some consistency that would really help it out."
"D-As long as I finish it cold, it's pretty good and refreshing. Not bad for an old French beer, and it's nice to rate it after all this time. Much better than it's Kronie cousin."
"I'm rating the drinkability of this brew highly because of how smooth and attractive the beer is. A light, crisp beer like this is delicious on a hot day and is also an excellent, excellent session beer. I personally like this beer better on tap (and it would have garnered a higher rating had I been reviewing it on tap) but it's not terrible out of the bottle either. Certainly an above average green bottle beer."
"D - I like it, but not enough to buy it all the time."
"""Il boit bon ne fait pas il?"""
"Much tastier than the other biere options in eastern France, like its cheaper counter-part ""Kronenbourg", Bravaria, or the dutch bieres with their obscene alcohol volumes."
"D - This is okay for a Euro Pale Lager. I've had it on tap in France and it was a little better that served that way."
"This was sampled at Chicago Ale House, only because it used to be available at Johnnie's Lounge (3425 N. Lincoln Ave), which imparted some small amount of nostalgia."
"D - There is not much going on with the Kronenbourg 1664. I will not be having another."
"Most of the beers I've had from this style have been skunky and unimpressive. This is nothing to rave about, but it manages to stay sweet and drinkable."
"The Kronenbourg is not a drinkable beer. The bottle I got might have been skunked, but it wouldn't even be that good straight from the factory. Pass."
"By far the best of all the green bottle euro lagers and far better than my latest run-in with a ""craft"" American Pils."
"Another beer I have a fondness of from good memories. Years and years ago I went on a class trip (when in high school) to France. At one of the hotels there was a vending machine with this beer in can form. We though it was ""French soda", much to our surprise it turned out to be beer. We young-uns virtually emptied the vending machine. Years later, I'm at the store and I see Kronenbourg on the shelves, so I figure why not."
"Typing the next few on the mobile they will be short. Poured a nice pale dull golden abler with a nice two finger head of frothy and fizzy lace that quickly faded and left behind nothing more then a thin film with no side glass representation. Smell was ll grain with a touch of euro hops, but mostly your classic light lager smell. The flavor was actually more then decent which suprised me. A nice crisp clean feel gave way to more then a decent swelling a grain and hops with hints at cereals and fresh cut grass. A long subtle and dried out finish only served to add on to this one and really make a great overall impression on me. It went down like water and I was suprised at just how drinkable this one was. Overall I would have to say not bad at all and I would definitly order this one again as for a session lager,."
"D - Nothing special. Typical pale lager."
"Overall, the Kronenburg is a solid beer and is tasty and easy to drink. Certainly, a great option for a sixer every now and again. It beers well with fish, calamari and chicken dishes."
"Pours a crystal clear slightly gold with minimal head that leaves a lot of lacing as it drops. Nose is mild with a touch of sweet malt aroma. Flavor is actually pretty decent for a mass produced brew. Has a fair amount of sweet tone to it that lasts long on your tongue but carries a slight touch of body from the malts. The sweet stays on your tongue longer than anything else. Mouthfeel is good. Thick carbonation and a lasting flavor. Drinkability is very high. I could go for these all the time. This one is a surprise for me and I am glad to have 5 more to be drinking."
"Very light and fizzy, easy to drink but not even remotely interesting. Appearance is the best feature here."
"As a result this is a easy beer to consume. I dont usually associate France with beer but Kroenbourgh 1664 was worth the try."
"Pours a clean golden/ yellow with a white head. In the aroma, small sweet malt. In the taste, malty and a bit sweet for a lager. A smooth malty mouthfeel and a sweet malty aftertaste. Not skunky at all, as some European lagers tend to be, yet notheing really say than it was a lager."
"Certainly one of the more balanced Euro Lagers I've tried. Scored it a 5 on appearance due to the excellent head rentention and awesome lacing."
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking lager, could be a lot worse. More hops than your typical Euro pale lager."
"Best described as inoffensive, mildly drinkable and good for what it is."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easy, not filling at all, decent kick for the style, I didnt think this beer was too bad, if my only other choices along with this were American Macros and other Euro Pale lagers, I would probably select this."
"pours a light gold in color with a two finger frothy white head with an easy pour with a fine network of lacing. grassy and herbal nose going into a slightly skunky smell. your typical lager taste but kicked up a notch. mouthfeel is light with a crisp carbonation. clean, light, well balanced, easy to drink."
"1664 pours to a clear and bright, dark golden colour, with a thick and creamy, white head which is reasonably long-lasting. There's a very lively carbonation with masses of tiny bubbles and a respectable amount of lacing on the glass. It's medium bodied and as you'd expect with such high carbonation, it has a sparkling mouthfeel. Ever so slightly acidic, with some good malt flavour upfront, a little sweetness and a tiny hint of cloves. The flavour is a little disappointing after the promise of the aromas but its not unpleasant, just underwhelming."
"Review translated from french 6-17-2008."
"Pours out a honey color with numerous bubbles lazily floating to the top. The head is really tight and leaves some raised lacing. Nose is of noble hops, faint, bready malts and unmalted grains. Taste has a mild sweetness with an apple-like flavor in there somewhere along with a nicely bittering and noble hop finish. Ends rather dry. Mouthfeel isn't too lightbodied, but never gets sticky. Carbonation never oversteps its boundaries and becomes too obnoxious. Solid drinker, but I could see the ABV catching up with me."
"I had this on my AirFrance flight from Paris to Munchen. Not a bad little lager. Poured a bit more golden than the typical pale lager with a good head for a plastic cup. Nose was a bit bready and had a decent hop kick. the taste was a bit of the same with a good grassy noble hop flavour coming through. The canned version is much better than green bottled one. it also helps that I am close to the source. All in all one of the better plane offerings I have had."
"D: A below average Euro pale for me, drinkable, but probably won't buy again, too pricey for what it is."
"Not bad, but nothing I would regularly order at a bar."
"I am not a large fan of European pales or French, so suffice to say Kronenbourg really surprised me. I do not like the hoppy/""skunked"" taste of many European beers of this nature, such as Heineken and St. Pauli. The Kronenbourg has much less of a bite and is a little smoother to my palate. I would definitely not mind drinking a couple of these in a session."
"From a can, exp 06/08. Clear, yellow or hay colour with a 1 - 2 finger fluffy white head, never completely went away, some lacing. Very light carbonation. Smells of wet grass and green apples - but not a whole lot. Taste is sharp, tart, bitter with some hoppy dryness. I find the taste quite agreeable for the style, there's refreshment value here. Not a difficult beer to put down in small quantities, perfect after a long walk on a warm afternoon or on your way home after work."
"A quite average Euro pale lager, with a bit higher ABV than I would have expected. Nothing bad (making this recommendable as this type of beer), but nothing particuarly redeeming either."
"12 oz single. Usual light golden coloured lager, large frothy white head. Slightly better aroma than anticipated, it actually smells of biscuity malts and a touch of hop. Semi-sweet malts in the taste at first then a small but cleansing bitter hop burst , quite nice actually. Nice mouthfeel, rather ""crisp"" All in all quite a nice macro lager. Drinkable."
"Got this one on-tap in the Fox and the Hound in Philly, mostly because I'd tried everything else there. It was basically the same thing as most standard Euro Pale Lagers, and not worth the 'import' price associated with it. Color was straw with a touch of head, nose was mild but mostly malt. Flavor was actually a bit better, malt and grain and a very light hint of hops at the end. Feel was standard for the style. I won't get this one again, although it wasn't as bad as a Heineken."
"The best mainstream lager I have tried by far. This tastes fresher, and more interesting than any of the other euro lagers I have tried. It is a little pricey, but not too bad value in my opinion, compared to the alternatives. However, some local ales are cheaper and more interesting to taste."
"I'm not sure why there's such a low score for this beer. I'd drink this over any ""mainstream"" Euro lager on the market. Very very solid lager from the French brewery."
"From a green bottle with a unique shape, this brew pours a rich gold color, but with a small white head. The aroma has some hops and a little grain. It's a faint smell, but fairly inviting. The taste is light, with an mild herbal hop tone. It's not as sweet as a lot of other European Lagers. It's light in body and in texture. A touch of pale malt comes forth as the brew warms. The finish is clean, but a little watery. It's a nice, pleasant beer, but that's about it."
"Another? I'll pass. I suppose it is relatively refreshing, but I'm pretty sure I'd drink water, lemonade, or iced tea before I'd consider another green-bottled skunk-laced french effort at refreshment."
"Average beer. Nothing really stands out. Nothing against it though. It's a better choice than most macro's on the market. Not bad, not great."
"Easy drinking euro lager. Not the worst, not the best but it will do."
"I wish to heck breweries would turn away from green & clear glass bottles! That said this beer poured with a large off-white head. Sweet aroma off set with some hoppy bitterness. Color is a burnished brass. Flavor is pretty much like the aroma. A hint of being light struck, although the bottle isn't too near a high energy light source. A bit of head and lace lasts all the way down. Decent body. Pleasant finish. Refreshing and very drinkable. Session beer."
"The delicate, soft mouthfeel from the billions of tiny bubbles is the best part about this brew and makes it highly drinkable."
"I tried this on June 30, 2007 after purchasing it from my local LCBO store. Having tried the Kronenbourg Lager, I decided to try this. The beer smoothly into the glass with a nice light gold colour, clear, with a thin head. The aroma is faint, but malty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some mild carbonation. The taste is more hops than malt and has a slightly bitter finish. Overall, a decent beer that I may try again but I prefer the lager."
"This beer is reminded me from the first sip of a Beck's. Pilsner malts in the forefront with a light hoppy flavor. Kroney's doesnt have that underlying bite that Beck's has. A smoother malt flavor protrudes. If you are looking for something crazy in this beer, pass on it. If you'd like to try decent import beer, go for it. Kronenbourg is all gravy in my books."
"Does 1664 meet all my needs in a beer? No. Is it what I would drink in the USA if I could find it here in western Minnesoa? No. Did it do the job on that unique warm day in southern France with my son, under an umbrella, blabbing about life, waiting for my wife to find some fabric in a local shop? Yes! You bet! France is France! French beer is French beer! Vive la France!"
"having never heard of this beer, after ordering it on tap (nothing else worth trying at the place i was at), i have to say i was disappointed from the get-go. appearance is of your typical macro lite beer. aroma was very faint, i did detect some vegetal/grassy aromas. taste was a hint of sweet malt with a sour finish. hops were almost undetectable, but maybe i'm jaded. mouthfeel was light. drinkability is ok, this has a little going on, but not a lot."
"Pours a one-finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear amber color. Slight malty nose. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is balanced with some sweetness, nearly clean finish. Part of meal at La Nouvelle Eve Paris, France. 750ml green bottle - best by Aug 2007. Label has ABV at 5.5%."
"The taste also has a good hoppy taste up front, mostly in the form of of lemon citrus, but that's taken over by an earthy malt flavour. After a few more sips, the flavours seem to let up and it tends to lean on the watery side but it still isn't bad. Quite refreshing so I won't have any trouble finishing the 6 pack over the next few days."
"Overall: another bland and characterless adjunct lager. If this one is an example of the beers made in France I suggest that they stick with wine."
"Drinkability is high, since i had a lot of these beers, and with a hot weather it can increase."
"DA; not too jazzed with this french-imported offering."
"D: Simple to drink, but simple on flavor as well. Not a very impressive showing, but still somewhat decent."
"Looks good: colorful, golden. Served to me with almost no head and a light lace. Smell was fairly weak, I could only pick up some floral hops. Taste was favorable, but average. Weak malt base, with an aftertaste of floral hops, and light hints of fruit (potentially citrus fruits, maybe orange). There was a slight taste of yeast as well. Mouthfeel was good, a heavier body than I expected, and carbonated well, leaving a hoppy tingle on my tongue."
"Pretty good lager with good character."
"Overall this brew isnt too exciting but, on one of those days when your just looking for a nice refreshment its better than your typical macro. Worth a try."
"Poured beer from bottle to a 45 degree tumbler. Beer was straw colored with a big bubbly head that had huge bubbles. Very creamy but head disapated rather fast. Bready nose and decent lacing. Beer was very refreshing and has a nice clean finish. I would buy again."
"Kronenbourg 1664 was light golden in color with good clarity. It had a white head that soon became a thin layer that did manage to leave a little lacing in the glass. The aroma was mainly European hops. The taste was Euro-hops over a light malt base. It was crisp and clean with a mild bitterness and dry finish. It was fairly light bodied with good carbonation. It's a decent, easy drinking, refreshing lager."
"D- Ok mouthfeel and look but the flavour detracts, which is a serious problem in a beverage. The flavour is weak enough that you can ignore it and get through the beer. I found the whole experience somewhat unpleasant. I'll avoid this one in the future."
"12 oz. bottle- color of straw yellow, with a decent frothy white head - nose of straw , hay , chardonnay , mild hops , skunk , and metallic  taste of yellow corn , straw, wet hay , hops , and acidic/chalkyness- body is light , raw , and medium carbonation aftertaste of skunk , sweet corn , acidic , and mild hops"
"It didn't take me long to decide that this Euro Lager was pretty average and nothing spectacular. It seems more like a low-end Czech Pilsner to me."
"Kronenbourg 1664 pours yellow with a thick, fluffy, white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. Immediately upon opening the bottle there is a skunky aroma that is quite common among Euro lagers. Grainy tasting with some skunk too. Not particularly good or interesting."
"Pours a clear pale golden amber color with a short white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is a bit subdued with notes of sweet malt, fresh grain and a bit of grassy hops. Taste is spot on with the aroma with sweet honey malt and herbal grassy hops. Clean and easy-drinking."
"The taste is initially honeyed, but watered down, with a metallic bitter finish that doesn't seem to give its all. A bit of delicate roasted malt is noticed, but over time it wears to become too astringent. Through the glass, the notes become more tart and tangy, but it all adds up to an unlikeable clash. Not bad. Not good. Somewhere in the middle of the beer void..."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. Beer is pleasantly sweet, bitter enough to supply flavor and not overly heavy. Could easily become the downfall of an otherwise standard night at the pub."
"."
"Another solid entry in the competiton, but Bass Pale Ale remains in the lead. But will it hold off the last entry, Birra Moretti's La Rossa, for the grand prize of the competition? We'll find out soon."
"Lawnmower beer? Sure, but there are better. I actually bought this because I had Kronenbourg 1664 *Blanc* on tap when I was in UK last August for the Great British Beer Festival (not *at* the GBBF mind you). I remember liking that well enough, but this doesn't hold a candle to the Blanc. I wouldn't mind finding that in the States, but I probably wouldn't buy this one again."
"The most exported and most popular brewed beer in France is Kronenberg 1664 made in Strasbourg. It's an easy drinking lager akin to Stella Artois. A beer to not be actively sought out but neither one worth avoiding. Sometimes it can be the best there is, sometimes the worst. It's a pale lager with a slight sweetness to it. It's a mile better than the Bud / Coors / Miller staples here in the states. In France, it is everywhere and if you actively like drinking beer and are there - you will drink it."
"D: This is drinkable for sure, would definitely try this fresh in france if i get the oppurtunity as i think any beer fresh close to the source is mile different to anything exported. Nevertheless, drinkable for the style"
"Drinkability/notes: A fairly typical Euro lager, bland and unassuming. A brown glass bottle would be a distinct improvement."
"Drinkability: not a beer to go out of your way to have. Typical mass produced European bland tasting lager."
"This beer poured a very clear straw color with a nice head  nice lacing  good appearance. It has a sweet, floral smell. The taste is a bit floral but other than that lacks not much more character. The mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. The drinkability of this one would be ok because it is fairly non-offensive."
"Finishes crisply, so makes a good thirst slaker... but that's about it. Inoffensive."
"D- I prefer this to most Macro lagers from Europe. Softer and smoother than say Warsteiner or Pils Urquell. Highly sessionable."
"Shining lighter golden color with a nice frothy head. Good lacing, bubbly. Smells really wet and immature with some skunky notes and aluminum. Taste is decent at the front but in the end it really loses appeal. Some kind of sulphuric bitter finish kills any good the beer might have displayed before. Fairly watery as well. I don't think it was real old, just not good for my taste."
"Overall. Its one i neither like or dislike. Have qualities to make it drinkable, but really nothing to make it stand out. But i dont think i would ever order it at a bar (other than when in paris)."
"This is a really terrible effort, so generic and boring I can hardly drink it. Funny thing is, in France, fresh and on tap, it dosen't seem like a bad thing on a hot night out. Too bad the bottle can't survive the journey."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a sticky white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. I was surprised at the appearance and lacing. Aroma is very lagerish with grain and a slight amount of hops. Taste is pretty clean that starts malty and finishes with a grassy hop bitterness. Overall, this is a pretty good lager. Nothing I am dying to go out and get again but it is pretty decent."
"Doesn't smell or taste great, but it'll wash down a burger just fine."
"However, I must remark about the bottle. A styled green bottle, embossed with ""1664"" and a distinct torpedo shape with the red-white-and-blue label only covering the neck and cap, must be one of the most attractive bottles I've ever found. The French may not be a brewing powerhouse but they do have an eye for design."
"Fairly smooth and refreshing for style. Occassionaly, I buy this when in the mood for a Euro-lager. Better than some of the more popular Euro-lagers."
"Def. a drinkable beer during the summer that you can take big sips of if your really thirsty."
"Ever buy a beer and wonder later why you bought it? Sure we all have. This beer was one of those for me. It poured well enough, straw yellow with a good head, but then the head went away to thin lacing. The initial smell was skunkiness I associate with Euro-Lagers. The taste was a bit more than I was expecting considering the smell. Mild malt with a light hop background and a relatively dry finish. Not bad summertime beer but I could do better or cheaper for summertime swilling beer."
"I could probably drink this in quantity if it was the beer on stock at a party or bar. I have no complaints. It's nothing outstanding-- just a good safe old standby."
"A fair, albeit lackluster beer. Pours out to a light yellow color with a dense head of white sea-like foam. Some lace, medium high level of carbonation. Aromas were light and grassy, some malt and grain. Taste is acceptable and decent enough, but doesn't distinguish itself from any other pale lager; wheaty notes attack the tongue, with elements of bland malt and smooth grain filling in the gaps with a touch of floral hops, and that's about it. Mouthfeel was good enough, but the lack of flavor and depth took away from the bubbly-pleasure that the mouth experienced. Drinkability is slightly above average."
"Not impressive but definitely drinkable. Although after it warmed up a bit is was pretty skunky!"
"The taste is similar to a warm Heineken (i.e., ratty), no matter how cold you manage to cool it (this beer also freezes quickly in a freezer). The aroma is akin to a skunk, the head is fleeting, the color is dull and uninspiring in the glass, and the mouthfeel is watery."
"Opinion: I don't think that this beer is nearly as average as a lot of my fellow BA's do. This is a clean and well-made beer that has a finish delicate enough to require interpretation. This is less hoppy than a Pilsner, but more so than a Helles. I think that it is a pretty good beer and one that I will be dinking again."
"Overall: A friend puts it at ""a little more refined Miller High Life"". I find it rather disappointing. Perhaps not enough of the skunkiness managed to air out of this bottle, but it still doesn't have a presence. It seems more overwhelmed by what's lacking than what it brings to the table. I must say that it hides its neary 6 percent alcohol well for something with as little presence as this lager has."
"D: I think it's a pretty good drink for the style. A good sitting-around-with-friends beer or after-mowing-the-lawn beer."
"Overall, the taste was just too terrible to even make having another a possibility. I'm usually pretty forgiving, but the taste was just beyond bad. Don't bother with this one."
"Clear yellow-gold with a pillowy head that dissipates all too soon. Smells skunky, like so many Euro imports. There's a hint of mild bitterness and malt on the palate but altogether things are quite light. Drinks easy, light, kind of thin... in other words, like a macro-lager. I would drink this beer only under special circumstances such as the one described above. Or if I went to France and it was available for a nickel."
"Kronenbourg 1664 is a pleasant brew, clean and refreshing. There just is not a lot of Kronenbourg 1664 in Nebraska to make my regular list."
"Overall, this beer is greatly lacking in character."
"Yellow piss color, lighter than the regular Kronenbourg and less skunky too, although the bottles of this stuff that Ive had in the states are just ridiculously skunky. This one is similar to Busch but with some of the better aspects of Stella mixed in for fruity measure. Finish is slightly acidic and hopped. Clean and crisp. Almost as good as Budweiser."
"The taste was smooth, crisp and sweet. Definatly a hint of grassy hops. The aftertaste is a bit dry, nothing to significant. I kind of liked this beer. Nothing to insane, nothing horrible, just kind of refreshing. It's very similar to more popular European Lagers."
"Drinkability: pretty decent. Nothing I'd ever buy again but I could slug the whole sixer down and still enjoy it."
"It poured a very bright golden color and had a medium sized dense head that disappeared quickly. It had a hint of citrus in the smell and malty but not too hopy. Taste was of light malt and grains like rice. It was a pleasent drink and was had at a nice little beach cafe in Agde, France and that helped me enjoy teh beer more but its nothing amazing just an average Lager."
"Expected better from the smell, but what are you going to do? In my opinion, there are much better Euro Pale Lagers out there. I wont be getting this again."
"Pours a clear amber/golden, big fluffy white head, some lacing and decent retention. Smell is fresh, clean and malty, some citrus/floral, smells quite nice. Taste is malty, bready, not much hop flavour. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, not bad."
"Poured a pale yellow color with white puffy head, that leaves some light lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is slightly sweet with a light malt texture to be found. Taste is very crisp with a moderate dryness to be found that a leaves a pleasant, slightly dry aftertaste. Finish is mostly dry and enjoyable. A nice easy beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: Easy to drink and quite tasty. For a macro this is heads and shoulders above a lot."
"Pours light straw colored with a nice foamy head. Actually, looks rather like Bud. Smells rather like Bud. Not surprisingly, tastes rather Bud-like. Although, a bit lighter in texture and slightly (very slightly) citrusy. It was OK. Did the job."
"Surely the French can do better than this (albeit now owned by the Brits)"
"I don't really have anything bad to say about this one. It seems it is quite unpopular and many people dislike it, but I rather enjoied it. I'm not a huge fan of lagers, but when I do have one, I like it to be like this. Clear and straw in colour. Very clean looking. White head that diminishes after a few minutes leaving a ring of lace around the glass. The smell and taste are both fairly malty up front, with little else present. Very, very low key stuff with only a tiny hint of hops on the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. I thought it was a great brew for having several in a row in a social type setting. It most certainly isn't your delicious complex abbey ale. It's a consume in mass quantities while watching a sporting event or in a social setting brew. I'll buy it again."
"Looks pretty average for a Euro Lager, pours a golden brown with a moderate head and little lacing. Smell is mainly of hops with no evidence of skunk in the least. which gives this beer good marks. Taste is typical of other Euro Lagers, Smooth, not overly bitter taste with a grainy finish. Carbonation is evident but not excessive, bitterness is minimal and taste is actually rather pleasing which makes this a great beer to have in the fridge when you're feeling thursty."
"Pours a pale yellow with a thin head that dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells grainy and bitter, and the alcohol is palpable even though this is a pretty modest beer in terms of ABV. Flavour is not impressive, there's not much of it and what there is is sharp and bitter, leaving a slightly rotten aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't terrible, but isn't anything to get excited about either, being pretty watery on the whole. The aftertaste is what kills drinkability for me. I was glad to be finished the one I had, and I just didn't want another one afterwards."
"Not great but pleasant and refreshing."
"A run of the mill Lager with enough qualities that I wouldnt shy away from it. Its clean, refreshing, and easy to drink."
"Good for what it is."
"Overall it's an ok brew. Not great, but not bad."
"Add this to the list. France comes up short again."
"Drinkability: An OK Euro Lager but I just can't get excited about the style"
"No, it's not Duvel or Magic Hat, but it's great drinkability means you can serve it to your mother, your wife, and your friends at the next tailgate party without another thought. Yes, you can even serve the backwash to the slugs in your tomato garden, if there is anything left over."
"Pours golden clear with a decent white foamy head that fades relatively quickly. A few sparkling bubbles precipitate, but no yeast residue. Unremarkable nose primarily of hops. Taste is primarily of mild hops and light malt, slightly bitter. Watery, bubbly mouthfeeth. Dry, wheatish/hops finish. Drinkability is above average. Overall, a decent lager."
"I wouldn't buy this beer again. (unless it was on sale for really cheap) It was ok as a summer quencher but would prefer other Eurolagers for this task. Just didn't seem to be a star in the Eurolager world."
"All in all, I dont think this specific pour I got is truly representative of the beer. The taste and body are fine enough, but I wont order another one here."
"I am fairly impressed with this beer. I didn't really expect too much after the last beer I had from France (Fischer Traditional Blonde). This is actually a nice refreshing lager that has a flavour profile that, while not mind blowing, is a pleasant switch from North American macro lagers."
"It's actually pretty decent per style. Strong straw color with loosely knit carbonation and laced decently. Lightly malty and bready to the smell. Less earthy and yeasty than a Bohemian. Light hop aroma that boarders on light strickenness. Tastes the same bready and malty with slight apple or pear flavors. Slightly spicy from noble hop late additions. Thins out in the body and reveals a fresh alcohol flavor and moderate graininess. Other than the grainy texture, the finish is crisp, clean, and lightly bitter and dry."
"Bitter and floral aromas emerge from the tawny yellow. Trying again, there is roasted malt sugar to be detected, caramelized. A gustatory image of brown white bread crust is partially filled with airy, neutral starch and sugar flavor. There is little suggestion of herb, something absolutely crucial here I feel. It ends in a fallen mess of watery caramel flavor. No guts."
"Ironically had this French brew while visiting Norway. (What can I say - it was there). The beer was light and very clear served in an appropriately branded glass (the bartender was very persnickity about this). Lots of lacing on the glass. The mouthfeel was pretty good and tended to have a creamy texture. A very long aftertaste was the only thing that kept this from being a superior brew."
"Easy to drink on this warm afternoon but otherwise nothing too memorable about it."
"Plus, I've seen a few reviews out there bashing American breweries. American breweries like Ommegang, Rogue, Anchor Steam...etc., are some of the greatest beers the world has to offer, you just have to not buy your beer at a local grocery store."
"Drinkability: This beer leaves a lot to be desired. It is mildly refreshing on a hot day like today, but water would be just as refreshing."
"Drinkability: Poor. I didn't even feel like finishing this beer, let alone several. I got sick of it early, even though it's pretty good for the style. Give me something with a bit more substance instead."
"In a green glass bottle. The color is about standard for a euro pale lager: golden yellow. Head is actually pretty nice-sized with some fluffiness. The aroma starts with a quick whiff of skunk upon popping the cap. After that tiny initiatial skunk burst, the smell settles into a pleasent sweet graininess. The taste is lightly sweet with distinct graininess. Flavor has a nice balanced attack. There is definently a higher quality of flavor here than the standard euro pale lagers on the shelf (ie Heineken). Mouthfeel is assertive enough to impress. If this were less expensive I would find myself buying this often in the future. Good session stuff."
"Drinkability: A good heavy drinking party starter. I like it. It is not exceptionnal, but it is good enough to drink it."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale malt scent that is light, yet malty. I detect some adjunct use as well as some carapils malts for body and color. It also has a dry, skunky aroma as well. The taste is poor. It is virtually tasteless except for some weak pale malt flavor and a skunky finish. It is another terrible Euro lager from France. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a poor example of a lager. It has very poor drinkability. It's down the drain with this one."
"Pours out to a golden color in the glass with a medium-sized head. Very faint grassy aroma. Taste is decent, albeit straightforward with a less of a Euro-style taste than I was expecting. There is a slight caramel and light fruit, citrus, present. Average overall."
"Poured a clear amber yellow with a minimal amount of head. No real aroma to speak of, but the taste was pretty good  somewhat hoppy and tangy. Body may have been a bit thin, but was appropriate for this style. A person could drink a few of these, but any establishment that carries 1664 would probably have other, tastier options also."
"Considering the scent, it tastes shockingly average. A nice, clean lager, with nothing in particular either standing out or detracting. Not a hint of bad taste to be found here. A pretty good, if unimpressive lager."
"It pours a dark yellow. The smell is of rice/bread. Foams when poured but the foam does not linger. Not too carbonated. A bit pricey in Australia, especially for what it is. But ok. Much better when on tap. If you find it on tap. Give it a try."
"In other words: Yet another adjunct lager. I've seen worse."
"One of my friends claims this is THE best beer in the world after he came back from France a few years ago. It's taken me quite a while to find one in the states and was happy to see it at the Paris Las Vegas hotel and casino. I noticed lower reviews for this on the site so my expectations were not high. tried it our at a fabulous French restaurant in the hotel and was very pleased with the result. It was poured perfectly in a tulip shaped glass that really accentuated the fruity and floral scent with each sip. Much more enjoyable than expected and I made sure to bring back a few for my friend."
"Finally, the light taste of this beer makes it easy to take down, but as I usually like to start with a more flavorfull beer at first and then I don't really care what I'm drinking after, I call those ""fillers"" this is a little better than a filler, but not that much."
"My beer of choice as I traveled accross Europe 4 years ago. Found it imported at a store in Columbus, Ohio but later was unable to find it. It reminds me of my great trip. The imported to US version did not seem to taste as good as it did when drinking it directly in France."
"Drinkability  The only reason I didnt pour this down the sink is because I just worked out and ate a bag of Funions so Im friggin thirsty."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Pretty good drinkability--easy to have several. No real strong impressions here. A decent beer but really nothing special at all."
"Smooth and refreshing in the mouth with nice even carbonation. Eh, this stuff not all bad, but it's like a french kiss from the bearded lady."
"Purchased LCBO Sarnia, Ontario. Tasted 10/13/04. 5.0% alc/vol. medium gold color full white head that collapses quickly, medium level of carbonation. nose starts malty but has a hop presence to it. light malty flavor is sweet and nice, crisp and quenching mouthfeel finishes dry leaving you wanting more. Very good beer for style."
"It's unfortunate that the appearance was the highlight of this entire experience. I've had worse beer--much worse--but I'll forget Kronenbourg 1664 like it was never here."
"Not too bad of a lager. Poured the typical light yellow colour with a light, two finger head. However, the head disipated rather quickly. Kinda sad. Not much lace on the glass. However, I suspect the glass was recently cleaned, so water may or may not play a factor. I'll give the benefit of the doubt in this cae. Grassy/dry hay smell, with a bit of herbs and honey. Malt is light on the nose. Tastes a bit dry. The grassiness is the dominant flavour of this beer. Bit of herbs, honey and slight dough as well. Dry, crisp mouthfeel. A refreshing pale lager."
"Better than expected better than a Heineken but not a Pilsner either."
"This was a seriously strange smelling beer, not containing any real enjoyable aromas. Rather displeased.."
"Green Bottle. Upon opening, Pepe Le Pew made a grand entrance. Mon Dieu! It was sickening. This has to be the worst case of skunking I've ever encountered. I'm not kidding. I had to let it sit a while to air out. Gold in appearance with typical eurolager head. Flavor is very typical cheap continental light lager. Not very exciting. Maltiness and residual sweetness and noticible alcohol. Finishes sweet."
"Draught: What to say about this one. It pours a standard yellow, with a big white fizzy head. There is somewhat of a beer aroma, although it is not unpleasant. It has a fairly typical macro taste. Not even a French accent to it. Non-descript commercial brew."
"A yellow malt and fizzy carbonation, replacement for ginger ale. Hey, carbs but less calories and more food value. Comparable to Moosehead. Nothing here, can't even disguise the alcohol. A little grains and tad of citrus and some hops and bitter aftertaste after sweet dries."
"I ended up at a cookout this evening, and there was nothing available to drink other than four kinds of macro-swill, Kronenbourg 1664 being one of the imported varieties (along with Corona). The domestic swills included Budweiser and Yuengling Light. I took this as an opportunity to try beers I had not tried in over two years. Frankly, I wish I had just left when I had the chance. To its credit, the Kronenbourg was the best of the lot. It poured a dark yellow with a thick white head. The smell and taste were akin to thin and weakly hopped soda water. But there was at least a bite to it. It was the only one of the four I did not pour out after a few swigs."
"Clear pale gold color with a pure white head that leaves a little fine lacing on the glass. Not much in the aroma department... maybe a little grassy hop aroma. Mild malt flavor with a little hop bitterness and grassy (Saaz?) hop flavor. Average mouthfeel. Tastes best served very cold. I guess it's OK but it kind of reminded me of a Coors with a bit more hops. Not a beer I'd seek out!"
"Reminds me of some of the cheap Southeast Asian lagers I've been drinking lately. I really wouldn't want to have another."
"Offered on draft at D's Sixpack, Appearance: Golden hue nice white head leaves even lacing not bad. Aroma: Mild European hop dose herbal grassy slightly sweet but relatively clean and lager-like. Taste: Some cereal grains with actual hop flavor overall dull mass produced lager but not bad. Mouthfeel: Light body high carbonation but a decent Euro lager. Drinkability: Nice crisp lager no off flavors doesn't challenge my tastebuds but not a bad summer session lager, but at four bucks for a pint I will pass."
"On draught (pression) at Planet Hollywood in Paris. Clear bubbly gold color with a thick and rocky white head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is mildly hoppy. Light and crisp body, with a decent amount of hops in the flavor. The finish is lightly bitter. Better than expected."
"A pretty average euro lager, along the same lines as becks etc, nothing world changing bu certainly better than then big 3 US lagers"
"I remember having a bottle of this at some outdoor concert a long time ago, and being less than impressed. The tap version is actually very, very good. I know my palate couldn't have changed that much, I dimly recall a sourness I really didn't care for in the bottle. Probably skunkiness or oxodization that I didn't recognize as such. Nothing that really sets it apart from other continental lagers, but absolutely no flaws, either. The balance is right on, and I was what might be described as happy. This stuff kicks the hell out of more than a few pilsners made by craft breweries. Good enough for me."
"Clear pale gold under a thin and short-lived white head that tried, but ultimately failed to generate any lace. The nose is strong with moldy grain. The mouth is medium carbonated and moderately heavy with sweet malt. The taste is mild, with some malt tones at first, followed by a somewhat metallic bitter finish. The aftertaste maintains that hoppiness, but it is too weak, and therefore ultimately inadequate. Strasburg made better beer when it was part of Germany..."
"Poured a nice golden color. Crystal clear with a fluffy white head and decent lace. Smell has some grassy hop overtones with a bit of skunkyness. Taste is average for the style, perhaps a bit too hoppy. Could be better balanced. Standard Euro pils. Clean and crisp, but I wouldnt call it refreshing. Its drinkable because its just standard, it won't offend anybody."
"1664 is available almost every in France, but it destroys many US macros. Unfortunately, the more I have this, the less I like it."
"came to the table a nice golden with a big ol white head. smell is faint, grainy and slightly hoppy. simple clean taste, light hops, grain, just a good lager. crisp in the mouth and refreshing. this is a simple good lager that is a step up from popular imports like heineken. it did a great job of washing down baby backs."
"This then would be the blue label 5% abv version, in that slick green bottle which I think is a nice touch. It's a clear golden in colour, a fizzled out head that's not even worth mentioning, really. Crisp grain and honey on the nose, backed by floral grassy hops. Flavour also possesses that crisp grain/bready character, rounded out nicely with light herbal hops. Smooth and crisp, it has a thirst-quenching mouthfeel, very easily made into a session ale, and one of my new favorite lagers. I'm pretty impressed, as I'd sampled this first a year ago and it never left much of an impression on me at the time. It is what it is, and that would be a clean drinkable lager with some character."
"This is a review of the UK brewed, canned version of this stuff. It loses points on appearance as I drank it straight from the can. The aromas are all adjuncts, and grains, with some slight floral hops and light bready malts in the mix. The taste is exactly like the aromas hint....grainy! The mouthfeel is very light and watery, and the drinkability is not the best. This is a great euro-lager in bottles in the US, but in cans in the UK, it is no better than bud!"
"Thx"
"Poured out of the can a pale yellow with a thick white head that left lots of lacing on the glass. A slight smell of malt. Some bitter hops to the aftertaste but nothing to get really excited about. Very thin and almost too close to watery for my taste. I'm not too crazy about this beer. If I was visiting someone's home in France I would accept it but I'm not going out to buy it."
"Light golden body with large bubbles cascading towards the thin white head throughout. Sweet grainy malt in the nose. Flavor has a mild malty sweetness, though not as sweet as I remember trying it on draught. Slight hint of alcohol as well. Mouthfeel is clean and uneventful. Nothing special, but better than many a European lager."
"The beer pours a typical lager golden yellow, head portly in size, the texture frothy, the color a brilliant white, the lace forms a concealing sheet upon the glass. Fresh clean malt sweet nose, the start malt and sweet, top skeletal. Finish is moderately acidic, hops apropos to the style, drinkable, but offers little to separate it from a googol of other lagers/pils."
"Bottle version 25 cl - green bottle. Golden lager with medium that disapear in no time. As for the taste: Can you spell SKUNK, can you say bad brew. Why? Why? Why? The bottle format is the most inetresting thing about this beer. This is so bad I won't spend more time writing about this."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours an amber color with a medium head that dies off quickly - poured into the Kronenbourg glass. The aroma is a little grassy but some malts are detectable as well. There is a faint sweetness as well. This one drinks a whole lot easier than expected. I expected it to be somewhat skunky since that's my experience with French beers - but it was very good. Drinkability was good and the mouthfeel was very pleasing. The finish is dry and leaves a bit of the grassy/wheat taste on the palate."
"On tap poured into a Kronenbourg 1664 glass. It pours a light gold color with one finger of head that dies down to a small collar quickly. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly light and grassy, with a bit of hops. The taste starts malty, and just a little bit grassy, and ends with a crisp hop bite. Not bad for a lager. The mouthfeel is a little light and oily. The drinkability is fairly good though. A nice solid pale lager."
"Wheaty and very but nicely and controllably bitter, this beer does a nice tasty effect that proves it is at least somewhat elaborate."
"This beer is brewed in the largely Germanic Alsace-Lorraine region of France, but even with the Germanic roots it comes out a unimpressive beer. It was somewhat easy to drink, but this beer really didn't do much for me at all. Simply put, it's just another skunky Euro-macro."
"Dull."
"This is not a bad lager at all. There is nothing spectacular about it, mind you, but it is pleasant, very refreshing, and highly drinkable."
"Golden pour with a medium head. Absent nose, almost no detectable aromas. Very, very, very dull taste. Not much in the way of flavour. Purely a smooth and creamy beer. Easy drinking, no taste. Nice mouthfeel howvever and i think it's a decent but not ""good"" summertime beer."
"Marvelously clear golden color with a modest, fleeting head that leaves little remnants to lace the glass. Light, grainy smell with some pleasant grassiness. Malty-sweet taste is better than I expected and is complemented by a smooth (not sharp) hoppiness. Mouthfeel is clingier than I prefer in such a light beer, but this one excels in smooth, refreshing drinkability."
"My dad went to Switzerland last week and brought me back this. With all the good beers in Europe, he brings me back this?!?!? Served in a 16 oz. can, this brew poured a golden pilsner-like color with a very large head. Aroma was pretty skunky - either this went bad on the trip over or it just smells bad all the time. However, no skunk in the taste, basically just a low quality rice beer flavor with a little sweetness from the middle through the finish. Not bad, but not something to stuff your suitcase full of on the way back to the states - thats for sure. One of the best features about this beer - for both my sake and for the brewer's sake - is the ABV"
"Taste is just mediocre, light malty beginning with a hoppy cushion and finishing weakly the same."
"Poured a straw yellow, just like any macro. With a big head that didn't last long. Then came the skunkiness! Why would they use a green bottle? I let it sit for 5 minutes and the skunk disappeared. Aroma of malt, of floral and citrus. Taste was slightly sweet, with a little of the citrus and a little bit of a hoppy finish. Overall it was plain, and wouldn't buy again."
"Clear bright gold appearance, big-bubbled and fizzy head that powers down in about 40 seconds but leaves nice and delicate lace. Sulfur aroma, right up there with a St. Pauli Girl, also a sense of grassiness. Simple malt profile, but with an off note of white vinegar. What puts me off is an unsettling finish, a combination of too much carbonation and a leafy cilantro herbiness. With a world of beer out there, I have no intention of drinking this again. Looks nice, though."
"This beer poured a very clear golden color. The big fluffy white head fell quick and left a nice lace on the glass. I really liked the smell of this beer  It has a pungent lemon/grassy hop aroma to it. The beer is highly carbonated and has a light body. There is an oiliness left in the back of the throat. Somewhat reminiscent of maybe Ballantines XXX Ale. Finishes well, easy to drink. Not bad."
"One of my friends fathers buys this stuff by the case so I decided I had to try it. First off, interestingly shaped bottle, but it could do without being green. Never a good sign. It poured straw yellow with a fair sized head that was retained for a long time. Probably around two thirds of the glass. The smell was a tad bit swillybut there was some sweetness and complexity that I did not expect. The taste was a little too sweet for my liking, I think I could feed hummingbirds. The consistency was a little thin as well. Overall I cannot complain. The bottle decieves you, but it tastes more like some Belgian pales than most swill you would find in a green bottle."
"Drank this in Paris. Clear, golden, forming a thin white head atop small to medium-sized bubbles. Retention is ok, lacing is good. Aroma is light, with a corn smell and lacking any hops. Mouthfeel is very wet and soft, with a thin body, making it very easy to drink. Carbonation is mild. Taste is light, fruity at times, with a corn beginning, a pale/munich malt middle, a champagne-like yeastiness, and a very mild bittering hop finish with a dry mouthfeel. Decent, and easy to drink, but not very distinct."
"Average European lager. Pours a golden colour with good carbonation topped by a thin head that disappears quite easily. I could detect spices and bitter hints in the taste. Nothing special in the aroma. Goes down quite easily... nice lager beer to enjoy with your stake."
"Color is clear golden yellow with a white foamy head that faded quickly leaving some patchy ring lace and changed to a weaker consistancy as it went along. Smell is faintly bright floral hops and pale malt grain. Taste is bittering hop, piney and clearing throughout and has some grain malt that sits there and does nothing. Feel is a lighter fared medium body with a somewhat unpleasant piney hop sting that remained bitter the whole way through. Needs some help but isn't all that bad."
"Poured a gold color with not as much head as u might think for the style.Kind of a malty/bread like smell but not much to it,taste was kinda skunky but the smell wasnt so I think it was the natural taste.Realy nothing special here I wouldnt buy again for sure."
"This lager from Strasbourg, France has some German influence, though with its own dry French twist. Lively pale gold in color with a fluffy snow-white head light. The edgy raw maltiness balances nicely with a semi-wild and raw resinous hoppiness. Fair floral hop nose. Great beer for a hot summer day! Think Becks but less metallic taste, less sulfur in the nose and a tad more noticeable alcohol whiff. The French can brew good beer!"
"The green glass bottle with the large & fancy neck label pours a clear golden/amber with a short-lived, big-bubbled head that drops readily to a thin collar. It leaves a decent amount of lace upfront, but retains less-and-less as you progress through the glass. The aroma is highly skunky - but I'll ignore that as a fresh bottle should be more neutral. But there's a touch of dimethyl sulfate as well (DMS; cooked corn) that can't be ignored. It's minor; but detracting. It does, however, express some grainy maltiness that's nice - and a touch of floral/herbal hoppiness shows up in the background. The body is medium with a fine carbonation that leaves it crisp in the mouth. The flavor is mainly of a grainy malt, although there are some light floral hops involved. A firm bitterness balances; and it finishes dry with a light residual malt and some nice hops."
"The flavor of this beer is just bitter and boring. It has a bready taste and light malt flavors, but it just does not have complexity for me. Body is light and a bit crisp. It is just unimpressive."
"Sampled from a funky phallic 750ml bottle. Pours a deep golden under a thin cream head. Nose of day-old cheese danishes iced with sugar. Sweet malt wears the pants in this beer, hops are well subdued. I could only be wishing it, but it seems this brew has a manifest Franconian quality to it that sets it apart from your typical Euro-Lagers. Interesting and worth a try."
"Drinkability & Notes: Very refreshing as I could put down more than just a couple. Simple and clean with a kick of hops and slight slap of alcohol. This one brings back memories and I am glad they are making an other push into the US market as this puts other mass produced Euro-lagers to shame."
"Crystal golden color with lots of bubbles in the pint glass. 1/2 inch white head after the pour leaves quickly. Slight hop bitterness notes in the nose. Rich malt taste with a ""tin"" (metalic) hop finish. It is an ok brew.. but nothing special. It was everywhere in London.. It was like Budwieser is in St.Louis."
"Clear gold. Good looking white head. Aroma is light malt, biscuity, slight suggestion of oily hops. Flavor is very typical of the pils style. Mouthfeel is light with effervescent carbonation. Nothing very remarkable here, but a solid refreshing lager to wash down a pizza with spicy salame di Napoli."
"This beer should be reviewed two different ways. When I drank this beer in France, it was hoppy, sweet, and just the right carbonation. I thought it was fantastic. I get back home and buy a six pack. I end up dumping 5 of them. Is the American palate that bad? Or do the French hate us that much?"
"Sweet fizzy and yellow. That should say enough, but i've got to write more to complete my rating. Doesn't really have anything which distinguishes it from other mainstream lager, and its very boring to drink."
"Rather strong hops bitter aftertaste."
"When my friend brought this over from my local specialty carry out, I at first cringed.  France has never been seen as a beer country.  This beer was a typical light tan lager color,  a slight aroma of hops.  A slight sweet taste."
