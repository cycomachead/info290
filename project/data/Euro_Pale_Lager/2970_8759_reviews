"I haven't drank Beer Lao for over 10 years, and I came across it in 99 Cents store. They have a sticker on the can now that denotes it's Gluten Free. Did some research and found out that Beer Lao is made from Thai's Jasmine Rice. I'm not sure about this Gluten Free fad, but didn't even realize what was the ingredients. Finished a whole 6-pack over the weekend."

"Spend a couple months in Laos for work and got to know this beer fairly well.  Compare to the local Thai beer offerings like Chang, this is definitely a step above.  Keep your expectations low, and you will be happy.  Taste is similar to Asahi or other Asian beer with rice adjunct.  However, one of the villages I stayed in did not have refrigeration, and we drank these beers at 80 degrees in the evening.  I couldn't do that with a Bud or Miller, so I give this beer a little love.  Or maybe it is nostalgia."
"No review needed, it's an Asian lager like any other. It is a good one however, near as good as Singha, and went really well with spicy Laotian food.  Try it if you see it, but no need to seek it out."

"I am surprised to be honest I wasn't expecting much. From a handsome 500ml can."

"I like this beer and will look forward to my next drink."

"O: For what I can only assume is a mass-produced beer, this is OK, but hardly memorable."
"There was a nice, long lasting head when I poured it into the glass, with plenty of carbonation rising to the top. Many of these type of beers have heads that fade quickly, so I was impressed that it lasted almost as long as it took to drink it. The aroma was slightly sweet, expected from a beer made with rice & malt. I was prepared for the worst when I took my first swig, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. I would equate the taste with Budweiser. For an import from Laos that may have been months old, and could have suffered the consequences of traveling half around the world, this lager was still fresh tasting and enjoyable!"

"Serving type: can."

"Great lager for Asia. Easily one of the best available around here in my honest opinion."

"A very nice one, must say."
""
"If on one hand, it is hoppier and uses rice as opposed to corn; on another hand it has a strong oxidation and sulfuric notes. Don’t let it warm, I started with a higher note and was forced to downgrade it along the degustation."

"Good carbonation along with a slight acidity make this a very drinkable and refreshing beer. Great on a hot summer day with a plate of spicy peanuts."

"O: Goes best with a tropical climate."
""
"Aftertaste: Those same sweet notes carry over, and every time I swallow it begins to dry. (The burp is pretty boring. Tasted more like my lunch than it did the beer I am drinking.) This is a beer, regardless of the ABV, is easy to drink and I can see myself drinking a pitcher of this. I would also like to visit Laos for that food. I am also going to look into other Laos brewing companies. This is good. It's not great, but I could drink a bunch of this carbonated sweet nectar. Yummy!"
""
"O: Good body, nice taste but not outstanding. Certainly great for this part of the world. Hits the spot and is cheap for this area, cool can. Goes great with pub food, and would be great with Lao/ Thai fare."
""
"O: This beer is rather drinkable but nothing really stands out about the taste that would want to make me want to try this again."
""
""
"Overall, another run of the mill Europ pale lager although this one is better than average. Paired really nice with curry and pleasant to drink on a hot day."
""
""
"O/D - From the bottle it's much better, with the bubblegum and grass coming through a lot more. Not a poorly made lager by regional standards and for the style, it can hold its own. Drinkable as the flavour can hold its own just barely. Not bad."
""
"Overall: While this is definitely not my normal choice of beer style, it’s not bad…it’s crisp and flavorful without lingering or dominating my palette…I would drink this beer with some guacamole and chips around a poker table…like I said, not my normal style, but for a lager, it’s good…(3/5)"

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a pale yellow amber. Thin film on top with a ring around the glass leaving a bit off slippery lacing. Faint aroma of biscuit malt and wheat. Taste is mild, but pleasant sweet bready malt with a somewhat dry crackery finish with a slight hop kick. Not much here, but overall well balanced and refreshing to drink. I'd definitely consider this again as a beer with dinner."

"Overall: quite a surprise. I expected this beer to be awful thanks to its origins and the bottle, but it turned out to be quite good. Decent lager with an unusual rice sweetness undertone, as opposed to the rice simply being filler in most Asian beers."
""
""
""
""
"I had this one in Ventiane. Pours clear light golden with a small white head. Aroma is nearly nothing. Taste is mild sweet grainy, thin body, some wet paper as well. Definitely nothing special here. A locally popular rice beer that in my opinion is just something cold to drink."
"Drinkability is good on this beer. Very crisp, refreshing, balanced beer. However, after a while the sweetness and strong kick to the mouth gets old. Surprised by how nice this beer is."
""
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but not intriguing at all."
""
"I decided to just dive right in with my pour and get the party started. I got two-plus foamy fingers of bone-white head and it looked like Fluf atop the beer. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and I knew that I was not going to be winning any points in Greg Koch's eyes by drinking it, but I am not in the business of trying to impress others. Nose had that sweetish lager-like characteristic that I find hard to define, but easy to recognize. I also did not recognize any adjunct smells, so things were definitely looking up. Mouthfeel was medium and I was getting the honey-like sweetness of pure unadulterated lager on my tongue. Winning! Man, I CANnot tell you how many bad AALs I have put up with in pursuit of The CANQuest (TM), but it has been enough to make me appreciate a simple lager, free of adjuncts. Mmmmm. Finish was semi-dry and it begged for a pretzel to go with it and by coincidence, I had a bag of Hammond's Pretzels on-hand for just such an occasion (like any time that I am drinking beer). Don't bother to seek this out, but do be aware that better lagers exist than the BMC AAL type of lager."
"O: Excellent on a hot day, especially in Laos (I imagine). Nothing particularly distinguishes this from a number of similar lagers I've had, especially from countries in Asia or Africa without a strong brewing culture."
"O: I was surprised, I was not expecting the beer to be quite as refreshing as it was due to the average score. I found the beer to be quite refreshing and easy to drink. While I might not run out to get this frequently, I certainly would not turn it down (and I consider myself to be a bit of a beer snob). This would pair nicely with real spicy foods - in fact I wish I had some to go with this beer tonight."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, some malts. Taste is crisp, malts and grains, not bad but kind of mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is easy drinking but nothing special."
""
"O: A pleasant beer. I think it would be great ice cold in the tropical heat of Laos."
""
""
"O - At least they use a brown bottle."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D: A little flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not a beer I would drink too much of unless my choices were very limited."

"O - when looking for a beer during the thick weather of this region, i'm always genuinely thankful when this is available. it is clearly meant to be crisp, clean, and simple (rather than thoughtfully analyzed), as well as to be consumed very soon after bottling. i've had very few other beers of any style that hit their intended mark so well"
"O: Not terrible. Actually, it's pretty solid for an Asian lager, even displaying some likable qualities. Not something I'd reach for on a regular basis, but not bad."
"Beerlao Lager pours a golden yellow with a white head that dissipates quickly from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy and a touch sweet. The flavor is very light, grainy, perhaps a touch of grass. A tad astringent, such that it's making me thirsty to drink it. I can't really taste any hops and only a note of sweetness that I would identify as malt. Not terrible, I didn't expect much, nor does this deliver much."
"O: I probably wouldn't drink it again. Fortunately, the reason I picked it up is because it was the last one available in my store and I didn't want to miss out at least trying it. It has some interesting notes but it's a little too foreign for my personal taste."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Pale Lager."
"Well, for a lager from one of the tropical countries, one doesn't expect much more than a pale watery thirst quencher, whose headiest attribute is its lack of distance from the nearest fridge. This offering, on the other hand, is stamped from a slightly different press - it possesses a decent malt component, balanced by an adequate, if not overly evident, dryness. I could easily have another of this, given the right conditions."
"Overall, reminds me of the bargain beers in Canada. Good for the novelty of drinking a beer from Laos (a country not know for beer). If you get ahold of a bottle, don't hesitate to try it out for that reason. Nothing special though."
"Taste is interesting but not really in a good way. I mean, yeah, it's just grainy rice with an astringent, sawdust like finish but there is something else foreign on the palate. Mouthfeel isn't helping at all. Not quite a drain pour but closer than I'd like. But, hey, Laos..."
"This was my revisited after I had plenty during my trip to Laos good to see it available on local beer store. Good drinkable and nice refreshing against the local climate here."
"Beerlao Lager is a slightly hazy pale gold with a fluffy white head that has nice retention and lacing. There is spice and funk in the aroma. It smells fruity and sweaty. Is that a touch of coconut? It smells strange, but sexy. It's pretty light bodied and sudsy. The quick finish leaves the tongue a little numb. There is no bitterness and no sweetness. A strong, funky taste washes up and then vanishes. There does seem to be a touch of coconut in here. Am I crazy? There's a fusel taste toward the finish. It took me a lot of willpower to finish this little bottle."
"Not bad, but not a top-tier beer either. I could quaff a few of these on a hot day. And hey, it's from Laos!"
"D - A mass lager that's of surprising quality in all sense; pleasant, well-balanced flavors with a watery-foamy smoothness that makes it so drinkable and sessionable. Beer Lao is definitely impressive for its style. (4.0)"
"Pretty good for the price it is, i could drink a six pack of this next time im getting smashed."
"Had a bottle at Wave Thai in Queens with my street noddles dish. It wasn't anything special, but it was a nice, well-made lager completely capable of washing down spicy food. Frankly, I'd take this over most Euro lagers. This actually tasted faintly like a Dortmunder Export with soft bready malts and a little bit of body to it. It's certainly the best Asian lager I've had at a Thai place."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Its very tasty and easy to drink. One of the best examples of the style I have had."
"I think there is a nice lager yeast in here, because I find this beer pretty smooth. I'd like to pair this beer up with some Thai or Chinese food. An interesting beer. Drinkable."
"Not half bad, drinkable and refreshing for what it is, and a few odd complexities make this one interesting."
"Drinkability: boy, this has been one middle-of-the-road beer. It's drinkable in a pinch, but it isn't outstanding in any particular area (for better or for worse)."
"I've never tried a beer from former French Indochina but this one did not disappoint. It was a full bodied lager that was enjoyable. I hope I can find a six pack."
"But hey it's Laotian Beer! So why not if you have the chance."
"D: Not bad but extremely watery beer. Very ""Asian"" Lager with notes of rice which does not help too much"
"you may see me drink this if I'm in some south east Asian jungle and this is a safe alternative for water"
"Would pair well with Thai food."
"Poured into standard pint glass revealed a minimal head which did not persist the requisite amount of time to impress most folks. Carbonation seems to be minimal. Yellow color typical of many beers of this type. Smell was pleasing despite being minimal. Taste was surprisingly good with hints of the normal ingredients for this type of beer. Mouthfeel was about as good as it gets for this type of beer. This was an average lager but not without merit. I would consider drinking this brew again if ever I encounter it in a package store."
"The teen waitress found my swirling and sniffing in an attempt to find something in the nose quite humorous. Surely she sees foreigners do strange things, but smelling beer??? There is a general consensus among travelers in the region that Beerlao is better than the other, especially Thai, regional beers. While I am agreeing, also note that the competition is extremely weak. As with the others of this ilk, it is best slammed colUd before being allowed to warm. It is common for locals to pour it into a glass with ice to keep it cold, and the thinning isn't all that noticeable since it is pretty thin to start with. Gives you an idea of the beer scene in SE Asia..."
"I would drink this again, I wouldn't go to a store looking for it, but it is something cool to get once and a while or bring to a party of beer drinkers who don't mind trying strange and new things."
"Can Chen!"
"Definitey first beer from Lao. Pours a very clear yellow color with a small foamy white head. Skunky, corny malt malt, bitter hops, overall pretty clean and light, refreshing and very easy to drink. Would easily pick this over any BMC or the like, especially if i knew it was fresh. Not bad, not bad."
"A decent Premium American Lager but it lacks the crisp, dryness of a good lager."
"so thats it. beer lao is the beer over there"
"I guess it could be worse, but I'd avoid buying this as an import."
"Very drinkable, not much here, but nothing too offensive, and there is enough structure to make it better than an american lager."
" D- This beer isn't offensive in flavor or aroma it is just bland."
"The bone white head crests over a finger, finespun enough that the it collapses down to the surface with ease, nice thin traces of lacing, retains a thin layer across the surface. Washed out orange to worn gold in color, transparent but not squeaky clean per se, few bubbles visible within. Bready nose with a honeyed touch, buttered corn, hay, caramel, no real fruit or citrus presence, just a slavish desire to please by maximizing sweetness and minimizing anything which might offend by requiring thought. Medium-bodied, lowgrade fizz for carbonation, no surprise that the palate has the same character as the nose, all poised to please the lowest common denominator and blend into the pack. Corn syrup, maple syrup, caramel, all this makes it stick to your mouth pores. The hay or grass is without edge, has sufficient hops to have good posture, that's it. No problem taking another sip, A step above domestic macrobrews, that is its best attribute."
"D: Average drinkability and average enjoyability. Better then anticipated, no qualms about finishing, but unlikely this would ever draw me in again."
"This is not a beer I'd care to put to my lips again."
"Should I ever find myself in Laos, I wouldn't mind going for this, but it is certainly not worth seeking out here in the US. Thanks to my local bottle shop for the sample."
"The appearance is a very light yellow, mostly see-through with a 1/2 finger head to it. The smell is some sugar and light alcohol, that is all that my nose detects. The taste is more of a light sweetness, some of the basic barley tastes coming through. Mouthfeel is about the same, below average. Drinkability is ok, would work to pair with food when you are very hungry or had a few beers... So I can say I have drank this beer now, but I do not plan on drinking it ever again."
"Badly flawed. To be avoided."
"Not bad at all, one of the joys of drinking round the world (as I am trying to do) is finding little gems like this in the most unlikely places."
"I won't try this one again. Went ok with my Vietnamese cuisine, but I could have chosen any beer offered and it would have had the same effect. A mouth washer at best. I can't imagine sitting at home and sipping one of these, let alone having a 6 to get through."
"Drinkability: Not a beer I would go out of my way to buy at home, but I found it more drinkable than most of the options in Thailand."
"Notes from 7/29/06"
"Drinkability: A beer to not only unite an entire nation of peoples but also to supremely represent a country that traces its ancient origins all the way back to the Kingdom of Lan Xang -- Land of a Million Elephants. Man, that's a pretty tall order, but as Laos is a relatively impoverished and oppressed place, I'd say Beer Lao really fits the bill."
"From a twelve ounce bottle - Pours a clear pale yellow. Below average carbonation, and lacing. Smells of mild malts and mild hops...maybe some rice? First sip is surprisingly lighter than expected , some mild bitterness. Weak malt backbone. On a whole not very good."
"Many ex-pats in Thailand look forward to a Lao visa run so that they can stock up on Beerlao. It's nothing amazing, but it's very drinkable and you can down several bottles for cheap ($0.70) without suffering the Insta-hangover that comes from Thai beer. It must be the sand-filtered water."
"D-Actually quite decent. This is one of the better lagers I've had from countries not known for their brewing know-how."
"D - Not horrible & I guess OK in hot SE Asian weather. Wouldn't drink by choice though."
"So in the end, Beer Lao is really nothing special, in the grand scheme of things, but it's cheap and cheerful; it's tastier and far more drinkable than anything else out there in Laos, or in the rest of SE Asia. It won't leave your skull thumping after a few (like Beer Chang), and it just tastes better than Singha. Drink up while you're there, but don't bother bringing any home."
"Beerlao is best enjoyed in a large, extra cold bottle on the banks of the Mekong River. I was recently in Laos and consumed, on average, 10-15 bottles a day (it's hard not to at $1 for a liter; and that's bar prices!). I bought some in the smaller bottles upon my return to the US from a Thai supermarket and it wasn't as good. May have been a combination of the hot/humid storage conditions and the amount of time the bottles had been sitting on a shelf. Regardless, this is a very refreshing beer that I much prefer to Singha/Tiger/Leo/Chang and other SE Asian beers. Nice crisp taste with no bad aftertaste. Pours a good head and is quite carbonated. Worth a try (if you ever visit Laos, the stuff is 100% unavoidable: only 2 beers served in the whole country)..."
"Notes: Pass on this one. A filthy finish leaves the palate greased and filmy. Sweetened malts are annoying as well. Ughhhh."
" Fits in well with most of the other beers from this region."
"It's not overly different, but it's done quite well. It is, however, different enough from the generic swill in Cambodia to make a nice change..."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Very light carbonation and light bodied. Skunky nose. Starts almost sweet, corny just as bad as Macau beer, hops at the finish. Far eastern countries have trouble making good beer. Bought this only to add a new country to my collection. $1.50 for a 330ml bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"On a hot day to quench a thirst it would be just fine"
"Believe it or not this beer has won awards in international competitions and is supposed to be one of the most consistently brewed beers in SE Asia."
"A crisp, fairly clean finish, not overly bitter like so many other lagers. Body is medium for the style. Considering I usually don't drink lagers, I thought this a good brew for the style."
"I've actually drunk this in Laos, where it comes in lovely big bottles. The nicest beer in Southeast Asia in my opinion. It's very much a hot country's beer. Beautifully hoppy and refreshing.I think some of the tasters here have sampled compromised stock."
"post script...halfway in, it's not so bad...maybe I warmed up to it?"
"Clear gold, visible carbonation, decent head. Very light grainy malt in the nose, and not much else. Taste is that of many-a import macro styled lagers, maybe a bit mroe grassymalt than the rest, but still not anything great. Carbonation is pretty good, although it does little to help out the overall experience of this beer. Probably only distributed here because of the far flung brewing location, other than that, there is no reason to buy this."
"Light malts that fade into a clean finish that has a generic hop flavor. Way more balanced and clean than domestic macros. Better than the average mouthfeel. No awkward flavors or rabid carbonation."
"I'd grab it over most of the usual suspect US macros."
"Beer Lao was something of a surprise. It's definitely different from anything that I've had before and is pretty okay, though offbeat. I'll order it in a heartbeat if I ever find myself in a Laotian restaurant. Strangely enough, I was recently given directions to the favorite Laotian restaurant of a Laotian acquaintance of mine. Perhaps I'll pop in some evening and see if Beer Lao is on the menu."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow with large army of bubbles racing to towards a modest white head. The smell is a musty sweet corn and light malt aroma. Almost American macro-ey. The taste is a couple notches above the macro scene though and is fairly interesting. It unleashes a nice wave of black pepper, light fruit, faint malt, and a hint of hops. Nice! This is a light bodied brew that finishes slightly dry and it drinks down super easy! I have to say that I enjoyed this beer and would have it again if the scenario was right. Cheers!"
"This beer poured a clear, light yellow color with very little carbonation but with creamy white foam that settled fairly quickly. The smell was mildly malty with a bit of hops and a touch of grain. The taste was light: malt, some hop bitterness, some sweetness, and a grain/corn flavor. The mouthfeel was crisp with light body and low carbonation. The slightly sweet flavor lingered. This beer was OK as a complement to spicy Laotian food, but I would not seek it out otherwise."
