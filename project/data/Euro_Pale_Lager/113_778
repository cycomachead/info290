5,31.2,,,,,,"This is just my favorite beer ........ever.  Such a simple brew solution yet the product of this labor is perfect!  It's the only lager I've ever found to have malty legs.  Its perfect blend of barley and hops gives you the sense that its malty and bitter attributes are released on to your taste buds for an epic battle (which is ultimately just won by the hops army).  The finish is crisp but doesn't leave your tongue feeling dry.  The complexity of the competing flavors makes for a fantastic taste interrupted by nothing as the malted barley and hops in this beer are organic.  It clearly makes a difference.  I would enjoy this beer in the company of the most boring and annoying people in the world.","Larry_Moon","Nov 06, 2014"

Very nice looking and true to style. Scents of lager yeast, grainy malt and slight earthy hops. A simple but well rounded and bright aroma, very suitable to the style, quite pleasant. Taste begins with sweet malt, moving into some grainy and bready malt in the middle, before finishing with sweet malt and slight hints of hops. The aftertaste is sweet, with faint undertones of herbal, earthy hops. A good, crisp, bright flavor, befitting a pale lager. Maybe a touch on the sweet side and needing a little bit more hops, but otherwise quite good. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a crisp feel. Very nice, quite easy to drink. Overall this is a good lager with a nice refreshing aroma and flavor profile. My only complaint is the relatively low hop character, but otherwise it's a nice beer.","Auraan","Mar 08, 2014"

Mouthfeel was mild, not flat, not overly carbonated.. just average. And that pretty much explains this beer -average in every sense of the word. The hops were almost non-existant. Tasted like a watered down Miller High Life without the hops and malt. As if the MHL is malty in any way. Considering the price I paid for this experiment (4 or 5$ for the bottle maybe? I forget, kind of like how this beer is forgetable), i'd take the Miller hands down every time. It's not that this Sam Smith brew is bad in any way -there is nothing obviously ""wrong"" with it. It just doesn't stand out at all or do anything ""right"". The malt is light as expected, the aroma is milder than expected, carbonation was right on -not high or low. More hops would give this some decent flavor -something it is lacking. It is drinkable but the question is.... why would I ?","Curtis","Feb 15, 2013"

The carbonation is ferocious, but it gives the lighter mouthfeel some character. I love that is is organic,but I just wish that there was some more body behind it.","silverking","Feb 08, 2013"

Mouthfeel was soft, not overly carbonated, but I am unsure of their claim about it being a hoppier lager. Instead, I got a good bit of clean lager sweetness and by clean, I mean adjunct free. If you really want to understand the impact adjuncts have on lager beers, have and afternoon of AALs followed the next day by one of these.

Popping the top I get the immediate farm smell, like I am feeding hay to cows. The smell then accelerates to a golden grain meadow but quickly goes white grape. The pour is nicely golden with an off white mutli bubble head that laces nicely. The taste is all grape as the smell might preclude. This is a sweet lager with minimum hopping that would pair well with seafood and light fare. Not my cup of tea, but rated for what it is, not bad and refreshing. I think the chunnel was a bad idea.

The nose brings forward a bit of grain and a slight fruitiness. Some English yeast present; not much, but it's there. Slight earthy feel to it as well.

Some mellow middle-of-the road cow cheeses such as Pleasent Ridge Reserve, or Montgomery's Farm Cheddar will pair well with the delicacy and acidity of this beer. A fresh, local goat milk cheese, such as Snowdrop from Haystack, or Cabra Blanca from Avalanche Goat Dairy will be a nice compliment as well.

A hint of doughy sweetness. Dry clean finish features excellent hops with some bread crusts and crackers. Feel is light, crisp, and quenching.

That being said though, I am willing to bet my paycheck that if you gave this beer to a stone cole BMC drinking in a blind taste test with the BMC product of thier choice they would choose this beer every time and then immediatly after realizing this they would commit suppoku for the unbearable amount of shame such a realization brings and spill their entrails right on the floor of the tasting room.

The bready flavors have faded a bit, but there is still a nice clean graininess coupled with very light herbal and earthy hops. Not as much lager yeast tanginess as is often found, which gives the grain and the clean flavors of this lightly hopped beer to shine. Very smooth and easy to drink, I've converted a number of macro ddrinkers with this. The organic hook seems to work with a number of people.

The body of this beer is rather light, which with the evident but moderate hops bitterness makes for a very sessionable brew. At 3 bucks for slightly over a pint, it's not a bad value, but I'd rather enjoy some of SS other more assertive offerings for that price.

The beer is clear and golden, with a thick white, lace producing head. The aroma is clean and a bit malty, with some graininess. Theres a herbal hop aroma as well. The taste is similar, lightly sweet and a bit malty, with some fleeting caramel flavors. Hops come out stronger in the taste. Soft mouthfeel, with a medium body. Its well rounded and very smooth.

I must admit, I was unsure of what to expect from ""organic lager", but saying ""Tadcaster"" on the bottle reassured me that I would not be dis-satisfied. It poured a medium orange gold colour with a snow white foamy head that lasted approximately 90 seconds or so. The liquid was crystal clear with a steady stream of carbonation bubbles trailing towards the surface. A lovely sight, indeed. The smell was a bit malty, and perhaps a bit biscuity. The wonderful English hop varietal aroma that I enjoy so much was present, as well. The taste was terrific. Faintly, faintly sweet with mostly bitterness / dryness dominating. The mouthfeel was light weight and smooth; very easy to drink. A fantastic lager and wonderful product from Sam Smith!","SilentSabre","Jun 02, 2006"

Perfect clarity in this straw colored beer, with a decent white head, which fades slowly. Sweet malt in the nose, with plenty of grains and a dry English hoppyness. Very sweet in the taste too, as the malt takes over up front. Grainy too, and even slightly fruity, and ripe. Hops take a backseat here, but they are actually there, dry, dusty, and spicy. Very smooth and drinkable, and not at all light. Not as crisp as some lagers, but it's more well rounded.

Barley, a little caramelly (typical of English beers) and bready. Sweet malt character and estery fruitiness takes away from the crispness or refreshing Lager quality, but substitutes it with better malt character and complexity. Still a bit grainy with a lightly oily finish.","BEERchitect","Mar 18, 2006"

Aroma doesn't seem too bad, but a deep whiff brings up some sweetness, a little bit of jelly beans. Tastewise, I am not picking up as much sweetness as indicated by the aroma. It's actually pretty refined grainyness, with maybe just a touch of honey in the end. I do enjoy the mouthfeel, medium with nice, small, not overwhelming carbonation.

The lightly herbal and slightly sweet malt is a perfect compliment to the citrusy and tea-like hops. This heavenly liquid is balanced, rounded and smooth, but flavorful. The complexion and flavors change ever so subtly as the glass warms and the change is good. One is not enough!","BeerResearcher","May 21, 2003"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability/notes: I had rather low expectations for this beer; prior to trying it, the ""organically produced"" statement concerned me, as if it were the reason for producing this beer. These concerns proved unwarranted, this is a very good beer, organically produced or not.","Pegasus","Apr 24, 2003"
3,-21.3,3,3,3,3,3,"It poured a nice yellow color with somewhat of a head. But the taste, typical. It tasted like Bass. Non-eventful, perhaps they should add some non-organic ingrediants and ""spice"" it up. That's the ticket! Maybe some industrial strenghth hops.","bewareOFpenguin","Mar 07, 2003"
3.63,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I hope this wasn't just an afterthought for one of my favorite brewery's in the world. There is no reason that I know of why an ""organic"" beer should taste any different than a...what...""synthetic"" (?) beer. But this has an overall much more rustic, awkward character than Tadcaster's other Lager. Notes of pine-infused water, brick dust, and ragweed adorn respectable lager texture and glycerin. For the finish, which manages to come into decent balance, I say it is pretty drinkable.","putnam","Feb 03, 2003"
4.05,6.3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The fact that it is organically made is a plus of sorts. Not a typical clear Samuel Smith bottle, another plus of sorts.","bditty187","Jan 06, 2003"

3.3,-13.4,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"On the pour an opalescent gold color with a modest sized head, the lace is a fair sheet to cover the glass. Nose is malt, slightly earthy, clean and crisp. Front is slightly malt sweet, the top skimpy, the finish is purposefully acidic, hops are meaningful, the aftertaste dry and long lasting. As I normally don't care for lagers/pils, this one is clean and fresh, and a good beer for the ""Long Hot Summer Months"".","Gusler","Nov 27, 2002"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Golden glowing lager juice sports a thin top and a few skeletal lace fingers. Breakfast in bed as the aromas of toast, a wedge of melon and a fresh mum drift through your nose. Less sprightly than your typical lager makes for prompt and easy drinking. A fine, toasted malt base flows into a loamy hop flavor that turns a mild bitter and strolls across the backsides of your tongue. Good stuff.","inebrius","Oct 30, 2002"
4.51,18.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"By far, the BEST lager I have ever tasted. Clear golden color underneath a beautiful fluffy white head that won't go away and sticks all over the glass. Aroma is somewhat spicy, almost that of a Belgian ale. Good malt character, and a smoothness to kill for. Slight hop flavor towards the end. This is what all American lagers wish they could be.","IrishRedRock","Oct 16, 2002"
3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Light straw color. Pillowy white head. Bready, light grain aroma. Plenty of flavor packed into this light brew. Biscuity malt flavor with oily but reserved hops. Carbonation nips at the throat. Light mouthfeel. An appreciation for a fine lager like this should not be understated. A quality brew.","John","Oct 10, 2002"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pale golden color and clear as possible.  Fruit and flowers dominate the nose and flavor.  Good mouthfeel and nice finish.  Definitely worth checking out as it is a pretty unique beer.  Just beer worried about skunked bottles as the bottles are clear.","jreitman","Aug 25, 2002"
3.58,-6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Its good to know that there are good organic beers out there, as for buying this again it is more of a novelty item. No great shake here, just a good drinking lager.","Jason","Aug 07, 2002"
4.12,8.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"a great clean lager. lighter in color and smooth down the chute. my first experience with an organic lager, and it was a good one. it was great like sam smith's lager, but this was toned down.","ElGuapo","Jul 05, 2002"
3.89,2.1,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Golden in color and slightly hazy.  It's topped with a head that dissipates readily. The mild noble hop nose is herbal, a touch spicy, unassertive, and is coupled w. a mellow graininess.  The aroma is pleasant overall.  Lightly bodied. Soft, bready malt flavors and mild sweetness is very well balanced by hop bitterness.  Hop flavor, although secondary, seems a bit grassy. The finish is clean and mildly grainy.  This is a lightly bodied and flavorful brew, but seems more like a Dortmunder Export rather than a Helles, since it was a touch shy on malt character.","marc77","Apr 17, 2002"
4.26,11.8,5,4,4,4,5,"Frothy golden, slightly hazey, bit of sediment in the glass.  When pouring it's almost like looking through water.  Raw barley, clove, ginger on the nose.  The flavors on the palate have strong resemblance to the scent on your nose.  Crisp? Yes.  Refreshing? Definately.  Healthy? I'd like to think so.","Jordan","Dec 13, 2001"
