"Light in flavor , alright beer, had it at epcot"

"Wow, 1st time I saw this beer in the states. I haven't had it since my trip to Morocco in 2004. Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is light, some malts, a bit of sweetness. Taste is somewhat unusual, metallic, some grains, a slightly medicinal aftertaste. Feels light in the mouth and overall is mediocre at best."

"there is a wheat malt taste so better than bog standard macro lager"

"Pale golden colored lager with a bit of haziness. A quarter inch thick head is on top. I see plenty of carbonation bubbles inside. Aroma is slightly metallic and not much else. Mouth is a bit salty and thin. Taste is faintly that of bittering hops,and pale malt with a quick and slightly metallic finish."

"O: There's nothing really special about the smell or taste of this beer, but it is rather easy to drink."
"O: This beer is not anything special about this beer but it is not offensive or anything like that...it is just very average. Easy enough to drink with well hidden alcohol but a touch sweet for me."

"Dull and flawed. Take a pass."

"Macro all the way. Quite dry and lifeless."

"O: This could probably work in Morocco after a warm day in Marrakech, but in here in Sweden - not so interesting..."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet biscuit and bready malt with grassy hops and a slightly stale vegetable component. Flavor is sweet, mild biscuit and a hint of toasted malt, finishing with faint malt and slight hops. There is no evidence of the odd stale part of the the aroma. Medium, surprisingly slightly creamy body. A pleasant slightly sweet malty lager and with more character than most macros and Euro pales. I wouldn't hesitate getting another bottle of this in Morocco or a restaurant."

"o - Overall not that bad of a beer; I think I liked it a little bit better then most. Certainly not the most flavorful beer, but easy to drink and not bad or offensive at all. Overall an average beer probably not worth checking out, but I've had much worse."

"O-quite enjoyable! wasn't expecting to enjoy this but its refreshing and slightly complex. i could drink this a lot when i just want something easy going"

"330ml can served into a Pilsen glass.Enyoyed,once again on agtÂ´11.Pale straw.Clear appearance.White dense froth.Fairly well retention.Nice lacing rings.Citrusy floral aroma.Slightly sweet citrusy flavor.Quite fat mouthfeel.Light body,medium carbonation.Cloying aftertaste.Smooth dry bitter finish.Bland overall sensation."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised with this beer out of Morocco."
"O - In one word, no. Not an enjoyable beer, and would not want again."
"I was able to taste a Casa Beer whilst walking through the Morrocan village of Epcot amusement park at disney. Casa Beer has a nice amber color with white foamy head. There are slight hops on the nose and in the taste. The smell and taste are predominately powered by grain, but it is very smooth and drinkable. Definitly worth a taste."
"Overall - this is one of the worst beers I've ever had. If I ever say this in a friends fridge I would ask what he paid for it and then give him that amount and pour the beer down the drain. Avoid this."
"Not a great beer, but it is clean and refreshing. Can see this as a good summer beer, worth a try."
"My first ever beer from Morocco. Pours a clear straw-yellow colour with thin white head. A little bit of lacing on the glass. Smells quite grainy and clean. Not too much in the way of flavour, but nothing off either, which is a step up from many adjunct lagers. Big carbonation level."
"Meh. Maybe if I was in Morocco."
"D: This is a OK beer, but it is one that I won't buy."
"Drinkability -- If it weren't for a few defects (sulphur taste, tannic finish) this would be an above-average Euro lager, but as it stands it's a curiosity from the black continent. Regardless, a brewery making *anything* in the Middle East is a marvel in and of itself."
"African beer #4. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a rather short-lived half-finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises grass, light and dull florals, rice, and mossy tree bark. The taste is slightly better, leaning on light wheat, some minor floral bitterness, a light sprinkle of corn syrup, and a subtle metallic twinge. The body is quite light, with a light active carbonation and a crisp finish. As decidedly unimpressive as the smell and taste are, this thing does go down really easily (and, thankfully, pretty quickly, too). Call me Western-centric, but I have yet to have a solid brew from this continent. Oh well, the search continues, and hope lives on..."
"Had from the bottle in Florida in Disneyworld at Epcot while wandering around the World Showcase, Morocco section.. . Pours a light yellow mostly gold/copper .. . light caramel malts with touches of bitterness .. . lacing is an A for sure .. . a simple brew in the mouth, made to refresh.. no harsh off flavours .. . An absolute winner for a 90 degree day .. next, a Grand Marnier slushy served by this hot french chick.."
"Notes: Best before Dec. 2010. Overall, about an average beer across the board. Pretty inoffensive and easy to drink beer with a decent amount of floral and grassy hops. It was a nice beer to drink, but pretty forgettable."
" D- This beer has a nice flavor to the malt but it is covered by the carbonic acid except for the hop note. The slight sweetness to the sulfury finish has a nice Kolsch quality its just covered up."
"knock another country of my list, and I could swallow it without issues. I honestly expected less from North African beer so I was pleased with a straight across the board average beer."
"d: Better than I expected, but not worth revisiting."
"Beer from Morocco, who'da thunk it...yet the night's still (relatively) young...stay tuned."
"Drinkability: Quite average from top to bottom. Casablanca: a fantastic movie, but a not so great beer."
"The beer is golden orange in color. It has a white foam head and lots of carbonation bubbles in the glass. There is a little earthy yeast in the aroma, but there really isn't much going on. The taste has a lot of cheap malts and some corn. It tastes better than some American macros, but still not that great. It has a medium body and a lot of carbonation. It goes down easy, but it isn't that enjoyable to drink. I didn't order a second bottle, and probably never will."
"This is very drinkable stuff. I'd have no problem drinking these at the oasis."
"Drinkability: on a warm day, pretty drinkable. Otherwise, pretty average. Certainly not the worst macro lager I've had, but not an outstanding beer."
"D- I'm trying hard to find something positive about this beer and this is it...it's easy to drink because it's quite bland and well carbonated. I would think this would be a suitable beer brewed from an African country where it's hot all the time, as this would go down easy on summer afternoon! I don't think I'll go out of my way to get this again however."
"Light bodied and fairly smooth drinking, I would reccommend this to a macro drinker who wants to try something new. A very decent brew for what it is."
"Pretty average for the style, but points for lack of skunkiness."
"Back to the change in taste, it would have been pretty damn good before the flavor shift. It could have been quite drinkable. I'm not sure if it was old, not cold enough, or just me, but it just tasted funny after just a few minutes. If only it stayed the way it started. That said, I would try it again if either I found a bottle with no sediment or I was in Morocco again."
"Casa Beer is a very sparkling golden lager with a small, dense, slightly off-white head that has good retention and lacing. It has a faint, light grain aroma with a note of fruitiness; noble characteristics. It is light bodied and smooth with a crisp, dry finish. It has a light, inoffensive taste with notes of lemon and pepper. There is a slightly roasted flavor that surprised me and a slight hint of fruity wooden hops. This is much better than I expected."
"D: If I'm ever in Morocco, it looks like I'll be able to grab a beer that is at least inoffensive. This beer is about as generic as beer can get."
"I like this beer, no idea of it's style, typing this up in notepad. It is not a lighter beer, though the appearance might fool you into thinking it is. Good medium body and very light on the carbonation. I could drink a few more."
"Pours light golden color with very thin white head. Smell - malts, honey, some grassy hops. Taste - clean, a bit of honey upfront, followed buy malts, semi dry somewhat bitter finish. Pretty smooth and refreshing beer. Above average lager. Drinkable."
"Notes from: 2/14/05"
"A bit thin and watery, great for a sunny day by the pool maybe, but not a cold winters night in the UK. I should have held my lager evening in the summer. This had no great flavours or tastes to elaborate on, just a lager and another country ticked off in my quest to drink around the world."
"Bottle from Maaza resturant. Pours a clear light golden color with a small white head. A light malt and grassy aroma. The taste was quite nice; smooth and clean, light malts and grasses. Very crisp and clean flavor. A nice Pale Lager. Smooth and enjoyable, but not my favorite style."
"Overall this is just another average beer. It was quite refreshing but it is surely nothing special."
"Drinkability was pretty top notch. It's a good lager, not great, but not terrible either. An average beer with a cool bottle."
"Not clean or refreshing. Honestly not sure how this can sell other than for the novelty factor or beer hunters trying everthing once. Pass."
"Finish is a turn off, but otherwise it is palatable."
"Decent looking enough lager, richer head than most and it sticks around as does some lacing. Some cooked veggies tend to mask the bready malt and floral hop that is there. Taste is quite decent given it's classmates. Aforemention bready-like malt and hop make an appearance as does a slight metaliic twang. Lighter in body, but also slick and smooth going down. Wouldn't mind another in a cafe in Maroc if I could avoid detection by the religious police ;)"
"Pours a slightly hazed straw gold with a white head that leaves a pretty fair amount of lacing on the way down. Nose is barely there with a dried lemon tone and a bit of grain attribute as well. Flavor is slightly bitter citric. A touch of metallic edge to it. Feel is standard with carbonation. Drinkable, I guess. Nothing to really write home about. If I were in Morocco, I am sure my choices would be limited, so it would have to do. But for here in the U.S., no great shakes (but a little bit better than I had expected)."
"It is essentially non-descript, yellow, white head, little retention. Aroma and taste are bland, little noticeable malts, no hoppiness at all. It went decently on a very hot day in Florida, but not a lot better than Bud or Miller."
"That being said. I had this beer in Morocco. If you can get any beer in a Muslim country you are lucky. Its just hard to come by. This is a beer that you drink because you want a beer and you want to tell people you had a Moroccan beer. Thats really it. I wouldn't go out of your way to seek this beer out but I would certainly recommend it if you are in Morocco just because the others are not very good. Its very much like the Bud of Morocco."
"Review added 11-20-2007, translated from french 2-5-2008."
"D - At least some boring beers are sort of refreshing, this isn't."
"D-This tastes like a non skunked Heineken, which I suppose could be a good thing for somepeople but it just doesn't interest me that much."
"From my notes 6/9/07 pours a two-finger white head that quickly goes to a ring, leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Musty nose. Light carbonation and light bodied. Flavor is typical hoppy lager that tends to be bitter at finish. S.Fr. 3.80 ($3.09) for a 330ml bottle from Drinks of the World Lucerne, Switzerland."
"Overall: almost unpleasant. I will not be visiting this one again."
"D= wish I could find more of this stuff!"
"Had again 3.5 years later, fresh from Morocco and decent mouthfeel."
"It's drinkable enough and just a tad more interesting and satisfying than most bottom shelf lagers but not worth the $1.69 I paid."
"I wonder how well this sells in its home country?"
"Taste well about the same as the smell. The style says it all, American Macro Lager, its just like a big name American Lager. This does seem to be a bit more drinkable to me than the large american ones. The mouthfeel was like water. Nothing really stood out with this beer. It would be a beer for a warm summer day at the lake. It was refreshing and light which makes it an easy drinking beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a mild dry sweetness. Ok if there's nothing else laying around."
"Pale gold lager with a rocky white cap that has modest retention. Leaves light lacing on the glass. Sweet bready malt over herbal hop tones in the aroma. Light bodied, silky-sweetish lager with a sharp hop bite and a nice biscuity after taste. Tastes way better than it looks."
"All that being said, Casablanca is otherwise an alright beer."
"-UF"
"Ok for quenching thirst before moving up to something better."
" I could definitely drink a few of these if I ever get stranded in Casablanca, for a few days. This one has a few faults, but is better than the American macros."
"Bland, a waste of the ingredients."
"This lager poured a clear, light golden color with white foam that settled completely. The smell was modest: a thin, sweetish smell (corn?) with an ever so slight touch of floral hops. The taste was not bad, but thin: sweetish malt with a bit of floral hops and some bitter hops, especially in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and fairly dry with medium-light body and low carbonation. There was a light lingering hoppy flavor. This was a decent, light, refreshing lager."
"One of those plain, simple lagers that is likeable, but not lovable. Pours into the mug with ample carbonation, leaving a pristine white head atop a maple gold liquid. Strings of lace were left on the glass, which slowly crept down to meet with the beer. Fruity, citrus hop smell, with a bit of malt on the front of the nose. Hmm, nice taste. Somewhat complex. Sweet malt, citrus hop, bitter hop, lime, oranges, almonds, pecans and something uniquely else, something unique. Some sort of African grass? It was grainy/grassy, and bitter. Whatever it was, I like it. Crisp, biting mouthfeel that leaves the tongue and cheeks refreshed. One of the best pale lagers I've had. Highly drinkable. If I can find this back home, it'll be a staple in my fridge."
"Taste is creamy and grassy. Lightly fruity of all things. Hey, someone hopped this euro-style lager! Nicely hopped for the style but not crisp like a pilsner. An odd combonation that makes for a nice flavor. Mouth is creamy vs. crisp with a bitter hoppy aftertaste. Very smooth and tasty. I, like others, had this at the Moroccan area at EPCOT and was pleasantly surprised. Tasty and easy to drink."
"Aromas of Saaz hops and malt. This follows in the flavor with a decently hoppy bitterness following the malt. Good feel from the highly ample carbonation. The is a reasonably dry finish. Highly drinakble for a pale lager."
"12 ounce bottle. The bottle is a very light brown color with a pretty nifty label."
"I thought this must be a little different, since it was from half a world away, but I guess not. Regular macro-yellow in color, with a fluffy head. Tastes like any US macro (nothing offensive, but nothing with any big hops, malt, or other flavor), only they slapped a different label on it. (The label may be the best part)."
"Sampled at the Moroccan Pavillion at Epcot, it poured with an average white colored head that settled over deep golden/amber liquid. Some lightly toasty and sweet malt with light hops in the nose. The taste is medium-dry maltiness balanced by some out of place ale-like fruitiness and a pleasant hoppy flavor. Finishes slightly sharp and bitter, very interesting flavors in this beer."
"A rather odd, liquor-like flavor here, a distinctive tequila whang, sort of like Tequiza, without the lime and less corn. Beneath the liquor flavors was a huskyness that bordered on harsh, but held back just a bit. Sampled at Epcot as I tried to drink my way around the world, glad this was not the end of the Earth, as it would be a sorry beer to end the day with."
"As good a a beer from Morocco could be, and better than most internationl lagers. Strange flavours of rubber and sand (bit salty aswell). Sweet malts to start. Crisp finish, stale hops, not a very good beer in the end, bland and plain crappy, but as i said before, not as bad as some."
"For once, a Lager that I really enjoyed drinking and rating because of the flavor. When poured into my glass, it had a medium sized white and creamy head with fine-medium sized bubbles. The body had a lot of lively carbonation and it was cloudy. The hue of this beer was yellow-gold and it left a good lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose was lightly malty, hoppy and fruity. The flavor was hops and it was also smooth. The mouthfeel was tingly on my tongue and somewhat thin. The more I drank of this beer, the more I liked it."
"I found this in the Morocco section at Epcot. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. A solid, refreshing lager."
