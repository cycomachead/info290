"By far my favorite beer."
"Overall: a pretty average macro lager. If I'm looking for a cheap lager, I would rather get a case of Oettinger for $31 a case (which is also a better beer) rather than a case of this for AU$45."

"This is a crisp, malty Danish beer.  I haven't tried anything like it in the United States.  The Danish version tastes much better than the Tuborg pilsners produced in other countries (e.g., Italy).  This is one of the best beers I have ever had.  Ice cold or room temperature.  They taste great either way."

"Overall - Tuborg Green is not a terribly bad Euro pale Lager, it's just more muted and less offensive than many, but also lacks the boldness and tastiness that some of them due have. Basically, akin to the flavor, this is a muted representative of the style, that's fine after a hard day's work or some yard work, but definite;y won't blow anyone's socks off."

"Purchsed in Oslo, Norway in August 2012 - consumed March 2013. 4 pack was like $25 or so...lugged the last two home (no way I would leave 2 of those in the hotel at that price). Poured from 0.5L can into tulip. ABV says 4.5%; but all writig is norwegian. Pours a golden color with a finger of head - actualy nice lacing and rim of head remains. Smell is skunky fruity ""heineken""like. Taste is a bit fruitier than most of the style, but its not bad at all. Nice euro lager flavor, sweet, slight hops, but honestly its pretty good. Maybe its the slight ""age"" and transport in a suit case, but its pretty good."

"As a general rule, it's a good idea to stay away from all the Tuborg products available in India. The sweet malt liquors and lagers available here, in their hop-less sweetness, have a kind of charm. This one fails even to deliver on that level. If you must drink something and this is your only option, you still might pause and ask yourself just how thirsty you are before trying it."

"Not impressed."
""
"Piss - not a good lager. The initial aroma/flavour seemed vaguely acceptable, with a hint of noble hops. However, everything went downhill fast once it began to warm up. Bland and boring with disgusting off-notes. Best avoided unless ice cold."
""
""
""
"not as bad as folks are making it out to be. pours bright yellow with an average white head. smells like a boring euro brew, old malts and some run of the mill yeast. flavor is surprisingly good, its crisp with some hops throughout, and the malts arent as rotten as the smell suggests. it leaves a bit of a gross aftertaste but it is down easy and nice and refreshing on a hot day. feel is good, its bubbly and light. i can drink a whole lot of these in a sitting. not a good beer, but in a market saturated with bad beer it stands out to me."
""
""
"Finish is not profound, a kind of apple sourness pervades and it's not terribly memorable. Not one to seek out, fits into the style of mass-produced 'golden' lager without doing much to draw any good attention to itself."
""
"D - Other than the wild bouquet of aromas this brew went through, it was pretty much the 'same old, same old'. I was hoping this brew would be something like its Danish counterpart Carlsberg, but it didn't really deliver the same delicious profile of that. An unoffensive lawnmower beer at worst."

"In exchange for this swill being forever banished from the shelves of the LCBO, I am prepared to sacrifice myself in favor of my fellow beer drinkers in Ontario (I am prepared to be defenestrated at the LCBO head quarters if that helps). In fact, despite my profound apathy towards most anything, I feel compelled to write a letter to the LCBO to vent (although I will point out the good brews they have gotten right lately (Fullers and Garrison series) in order to avoid seeming like a complete whack job) about this shit. Enough is enough!!!"

"Tuborg Green is no better (or worse, really) than Tuborg Gold. Colour me shocked. This brewery may release cans in all sorts of shades but they really only make one kind of beer: bland, borderline off-putting swill. Tuborg may be one of the oldest European breweries to offer pale lagers, but that doesn't mean they even approach being the best at it."
"Easy to drink, easy to forget."
"O- Drink this as cold as possible and it will feel like a decent and refreshingly easy beer"
"D. I was done after one. Too sour and tart, no flavor, bad aftertaste."
"Decidedly average in almost every respect. I would never turn this down as it's quite inoffensive and mildly refreshing, but there are other EPLs that are both easier to find and better."
"if you like Tuborg Gr√∏n, i would not recommend drinking those bought in Norway"
"Overall - This beer isn't spectacular but it also isn't offensive in any way. I wouldn't rush out to buy it again but it's very drinkable. The slight sweetness make it stand out a little bit from the hundreds of other beers in its class."
"Got a gigantic mug of this in Rome, basically I was sick of red wine. Was pale yellow with little head. No prominent aromas to speak of save for a whiff of hops. Flavor was mostly like a watered down Euro-pils, light bitter and some hops. Was good softness to it, but as drinkable as it was so is water when you're thirsty. It's good when you're desperate for a beer."
"Drinkability: Decent, if you like this kind of beer."
"Overall, an unimpressive generic Euro Lager. No features that are worth bragging about, no reason to drink this"
"(http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com)"
"Not nearly the skanky mess that is its ""Gold' sibling, which may have everything to do with the can vs. green bottle deal. Still, a sub-standard Euro-lager, and not a 'Pilsener' as proclaimed on the label. Not something I would be happy to see available at venue-pricing levels, given that sporting event sponsor-happy Carlsberg is the ultimate owner of this pseudo-swill."
"Drinkability: Hey, it's cheap, innit?"
"Pours a pale straw colour with head that seems to stick around longer than I expected. Very small amount of lacing. Smells a little bit grassy with some grains, but mostly faint. Flavour is slightly sweet, nothing off about this. Carbonation is nice for the style. I actually prefer this to the Gold by quite a bit."
"D: Drinkable? Yes. But medicinal hop taste is slightly off-putting."
"D - This is an okay lager. I'd like to try it out of something other than a green bottle."
"nothing worth trying here I can only imagine how skunked a green bottle of the stuff would taste, I wouldn't go looking for this beer if I was you"
"Overall, this beer is nothing special at all, dont look to find or drink. On a positive note I drank this at the same time as a Carlsberg and this blows it out of the water. But I rated carlsberg an F so its not saying much."
"Overall this certainly wasn't a terrible beer but it's not worth seeking out. A step up from BMC in the states but not by much."
"D- I can expect only so much out of this style. So when enjoying something like football on a summer afternoon, I'm content with something about as pedestrian as the actual activity. It also wasn't entirely offputting considering the potential skunkability. Decision- run of the mill macro"
"Can: Poured a bright golden color lager with a small bubbly white head with average retention. Aroma of light sweet adjunct and corn is not as bad as expected but no great either. Taste is dominated by adjunct with corn note easily distinguishable. Another cheaply brewed lager with no interesting feature."
"D- Another dull mass produced lager. Not much else to say really. Boring and instantly forgettable. I think on a blind taste test of Tuborg, Stella, Carlsberg, Budweiser,Miller etc i would be struggling to detect much difference really. Pass"
"Color is pale golden and has a light head. There was not much of an aroma to speak of, bland. The taste was crisp and was a bit refreshing with light carbonation. This beer comes across as a typical middle of the road Danish beer that does not offend."
"Well then, here's a big pass here, makes me question what additives managed to make their way in here to give off this sort of result. It's crisp, I'll give it that, however I question whether this was attained through natural methods. The burning sensation still hasn't gone away either."
"D: This is very easy to dring, but it doesn't stand out at all."
"Pours a rather pale straw body with plenty of carbonation. Produces a bright white head that disappears quickly, leaving only a ring of residue clinging to the glass and body. Aroma is lacking - smells slightly like wet grass. Taste is almost non-existent, slight bitterness. There is a crisp mouthfeel when served just above freezing, but overall it's thin and watery. Drink it fast and cold. Wouldn't reach for another."
"This pale Euro lager is made in Turkey. No to slightly annoying aroma, alevel above a bit skunky. Yellow body with fast fading white head. A bit thin and burning mouth feel, some taste of malts, and some other astringency. A beer for homeless alcoholics."
"Picked this up for about 7.50 euro for a 6 pack of cans. Pours a light straw yellow into a pint glass with plenty of bubbles, head dissipates quickly leaving scattered patchy foam on top. Smells sweet but a bit skunky and just not very pleasant. Taste is mostly what you'd expect from an EPL - quite watery with a slight hoppy bite although that's followed by a strange metallic flavour. First few mouthfuls feel quite full and fizzy followed by a cleansing dryness on the palate although the carbonation seems to wear off in the glass very quickly. Drinkable enough beer if you're looking for something resonably refreshing and very light in flavour - could potentially quench a thirst when eating something spicy."
"This beer pours a pale straw yellow with a thin fluffy one finger of white head. Head retains alright, leaving big soapy lacing on the side of the glass. Nose is sweet, corn based adjuncts, with a hint of grass. Taste has a malt character that is not detectable in the nose. Definite presence of grass, grains, and corn. Finish has a bite to it, though no real hop is present. Light bodied, high carbonation, feels very thin, somewhat watery. Goes down easily, but nothing very special."
"Poured into a beer mug from a 22oz bottle. Dull yellow colour with a 1 finger head that vanished by the time the first glug was over. Smell was nothing to relate to except that of a normal lager, although smelt rather fresh. Taste was a pleasant surprise, nice and crisp with a sweetness that lingered for a while which ended with a bitter note. Mouthfeel was rather thin and was very mediocre on fizz. Drinkable anytime of the year, in the genre of a Carlsberg / Heineken."
"D: They were free and I only drank one. I switched to Vodka and OJ for the rest of the trip."
"D - Although it does lack a certain fizz, it is still a refreshing lager when served ice cold. However, there are certainly much better lagers out there."
"The taste is better than I might expect--I like the burst of bitter Eurohops with a very crisp finish--but there's no complexity to it. It's fairly drinkable and nicely light in the mouth, but I chafe every time at having to pay as much as I do for it, and hell, it's not even that much."
"Notes: The first in a long line of failed attempts at finding a gem while on vacation in Italy....I did eventually find some good stuff but it was after too many of these...."
"I wouldn't recommend this"
"Final Thoughts - To me, this beer would be a good substitute for a macro beer. However, the cost of importing makes that prohibitive. If I was living in Denmark, this would probably be my generic beer of choice, but over here it's just too little bang for my buck."
"Drinkability - not a lot of beers still taste like the can but this one certainly does. I'm a little put off by it and probably won't get it again."
"Very light yellow, clear with almost no head and a lot of large bubbles. Grainy smell, along with yeast and slightly grassy. Crisp, dry grainy taste with a slightly bitter finish. Nothing to go out of your way for, an easy to drink beer when there is nothing else around."
"Clear, not that great in taste, kind of a tangy bitterness. It smelled o.k. but just not very easy for me to drink. I tried it on more than one occasion to make sure I wasn't wrong about it. And while others drink a lot of it, I just didn't care much for it. I love to try beers from all over and would give this beer another chance, but first few impression where not very impressive."
"I bought this on sale at the Co-op. Buy one get one free. That's really the only reason to get this."
"Well i picked up this up cheap at the lcbo. Pours out a nice golden yellow color, with a thin line of laceing. Smells off, grassy hop smells, mixed with metallic ovetones. Bad. Taste was average for a cheap euro lager, it states its a pilsner, no where near that. Goes down smooth, with slight bitter after taste, and a metallic twang. Mouthfeel is full and carbonated. Meh i could have a few of these, but why would you? An inoffensive cheap, euro lager. On the fence."
"Where I come from, Tuborg has somekind of classic status. Now, being a bit older and at least a little bit wiser, I wonder how that happened. Tuborg green (or ""gr√∂n"" as we say here) is a bad beer. Smell and taste is sweet, grainy, doughy in a, I would say, almost musty way. The whole beer feels half-baked, unfinished (""unripe"" - green!). It was pretty ok once when I tried it together with crisp bread with ham and mustard. But otherwise, avoid this beer."
"Notes: I don't think I'd pick this up again. It's light, but not refreshing. It doesn't have a lot of taste, and where it does, it's not very good."
"I liked it, but have to admit I was quite thirsty, I suspect the taste would possible seem worse some other time."
"Very drinkable, light, cold, refreshing. Nothing huge in the taste / flavor department, but everything else I had in Italy beer-wise was so bad, this stood out. Drink the wine. Average, but very drinkable."
"D - Drinkable, but nothing special. Kind of bland and there is something strange and unpleasant about the aroma."
"Lawnmower beer...decent carbonation, easy to drink...nice served ice cold on a hot day. But really not that great."
"D & Notes: Not really impressed at all with this one. Too sweet, and the malt sweetness is not pleasant at all. Had a hard time even finishing one bottle I poured. It was served a bit too warm, but in my opinion, this brew would have to be ice cold to even consider having more than one. Plus, I cannot imagine buying this in the U.S. after it traveled overseas."
"I tried this beer on February 11, 2008 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a translucent gold colour with a thin white head. The aroma was very grainy. The mouthfeel was watery with little carbonation. The flavour was as grainy as the aroma. Not a pleasing beer to my palate."
"This beer has a very unique taste to it that you will not find anywhere else. The best thing to drink on a rainy winterday in the middle of the baltic see. Beatiful name too: Groen Oel. Golden color, nice carbonation. Unique hop aroma. Some kind of hey taste. Well it is a mass product. My favourite mass product Pilsner."
"A competent German pilsener, easy drinking with only the flaw of a skunky aroma. Cheaper than most euro lagers and better than some. Not a bad session choice, but a very average beer overall."
"Had this on tap in Europe... One of the better brews I drank while in Israel... This was one of the pricier ones in the bar being an import, but still wasn't very impressed... The appearance was decent, with a nice golden color, but the smell was rather bland... Taste was pretty good, crisp, clean and satisfying... Mouthfeel and drinkability were equally average, and the beer went down easily without being too bitter... Would definitely go for it again in similar circumstances, but would never cop a sixer of this.. Recommended for being an overall decent sample..."
"Uninspired tastewise - corn, grain, unmemorable. Nothing special, just your typical macro pilsner."
"couleur bl√©, dor√© tr√®s claire, mousse blanche qui se dissipe rapidement, nez un peu moufett√©, en bouche la bi√®re est d√©salt√©rante, elle coule et descend bien, elle est tr√®s agr√©able, tr√®s bonne bi√®re de grande consommation."
"The hops are light on the palate. Also has notes of sweet malt and veggies. The only reason I bought this was to get the glasses that came with it, its nothing I would turn down just not something I would ask for."
"Just about the worst beer I have ever had."
"D - I know this isn't the most exciting style out there but there are better shit boring euro lagers out there."
"A clean Danish pilsner, without the sweetness of many Scandinavian beers."
"Pours a pale straw yellow, thin fluffy white head forms, settles down, big bubbles, soapy, lace, unhealthy looking. Smell is sweet, corny adjuncts, grass, honeyish vanilla, average euro lager. Taste is average as well, but a bit more malt character, caramel, rice/wheat, dry middle, honey, grass, citrus, bit of floral, above average bitterness for the style. Mouthfeel is light bodied, kind of thin, medium carbonation, easy to drink, but nothing special."
"Came out of a bottle with a strange pop-top that reminded me of the plastic pull-off from an orange juice carton. Poured fairly carbonated, 2-finger white head. The beer had a generic off-yellow color. Smell was standard, grainy malts with some bitter-ish hops. Smelled like the basement of my fraternity house the morning after a party. Taste was like that of any light macro, but slightly worse: watered down, runny, a little gritty, with a kind of funky, bitter-ish aftertaste. Not enjoyable. I think this is suppose to be a session beer, but I was definately done after one."
"I did not have to take the full bottle, or I may just empty more than half of it."
"D: Since it has a bitter finish, your palate gets slightly tainted."
"Promises lots, delivers less."
"The only thing pleasant about this beer was drinking it with swedish girls somewhere along the Kompagnistraede."
"Pours with a big white head, fairly creamy at the top, lots of tiny bubbles in the rest. Straw yellow color, clear and not light yellow as some. Dominant malty scent, also a bit sour smell. Rather medium body at first, but turns a bit watery. Not too malty, but still a bit sweet taste. A tiny fruitiness in the flavor as well. Fairly low to medium bitterness. Sweet and malty long aftertaste. Fairly refreshing, but a bit ""old beer"" taste on the toungue after a while."
"Drinkability: We can call it beer, but not premium quality beer. It is drinkable only once or maximum twice per drinking session."
"I will not buy this beer again."
"It is drinkable, if you are into sparkling water, but whether it is worth picking up when you want a brew, I would say no."
"D- All in all a pretty run of the mill boring lager ... its bad enough that they send the gold to the US, I hope they don't send the green. We have our own ""Green Death"" here in the US. ;-)"
"Taste is tolerable, really not too bad considering the price. Light malt, & ricey like Bud, but a faint winey/syrup hint in there too. Good foamy mouthfeel but not overwhelming. Definitely more substance that it's American counterparts."
"Poured a golden color with a white fine head that went away pretty quickly, leaving a ring around the edge and that's about it. Smells a little skunky, with a hint of citrus. Cascade maybe. Not too bad. The taste is all of hops, and not very pleasant. Not good at all. Mouthfeel is very watery, not too great either. All in all, I won't be getting this again. I should have known from the green bottle. Oh well, waste of another $2.50"
"Mouthfeel - naturally quite thin. But what did I expect? Drinkability is acceptable I guess, for the style, but I'm making concessions here. I don't know how much this costs but I wouldn't pay much. Having said that, it's not the worst, only slightly below average."
"Overall- That was a waste of $10 bucks. I could have drank from the sink in the wc."
"This beer is a pale gold color with a thick head, thick bubbles that look good right after the pour, then fade away. The aroma is kind of sweet with a little hops mixed in. Light hop flavor and balanced with some sweetness. Taste has a bit of sourness toward the end of the glass. The finish is somewhat dry. Thin, almost watery mouthfeel. Average, but nothing special. Thanks to Carson for bringing this back."
"not much to add as the drinkability score sums it up. passably average."
"In-flight. I will hand it to Scandinavian Air: they serve only Scandinavian beers, even if they are pale lagers. Not a Bud or Heinie in sight. This pours out a big meringue head that keeps you from getting to your beer for a while. Smell is very sweet, in Rolling Rock territory. Sweetness is not as evident in the taste however. Maltiness is a little hard to taste until after a few sips. Then some malt and hops come out as you swallow. But it also comes across a little too thin."
"I suppose one should avoid these big, evil breweries who aim for total domination of the beer market, but what can ya do. It's a cheap, ok beer, and I'm a poor student. I'm sorry."
"All in all, a drinkable effort, but nothing special"
"Golden colour; OK head. Rather anonymous aroma. Modestly hoppy taste w/ a decent crispness, but lacking in the finish. Good drinkability. A very typical Danish golden lager, neither better nor worse than most I've had. A solid thirst-quencher, nothing more."
"This beer is a pale gold color with a medium thick white head. Rather bubbly too. The aroma is fairly sweet with just a little hops. Light-bodied with a light hops flavor and an underlying sweetness that turns more sour toward the end of the glass. The finish is somewhat dry. This is an uninspired beer."
