"An acquaintance brought this over. He didn't know any better."

"Not a lot going on but it was drinkable."

"Didn't check label for freshness. Six months past drink by date. It had an aged apple thing going on. Sweet malts and a bit of hops still shone through. I like it. Will try a fresher bottle in the future and update this tenuous post."
"Overall, nothing special here."
""
""
"Overall the carbonation is a bit too high, as well as the malt sweetness turns out to be too one-dimensional at the end."
""
"500 ml bottle poured into a Pilsner glass. Pours a transparent straw color with virtually no head to speak of. Slight metallic scent with tastes of sweet malt and grains."

"Better on draught than in bottles."

"O – This one goes down very easy and I am now a fan of this. I would probably not drink this regularly at home in Ireland but in the summer or when in southern Europe if this is around I would be very happy to order it and even happier to drink it."

"The alcohol was where I expected it to be and there wasn't a point where I could feel it in the taste. This was much better than other examples of the style that I've had and should I find it again, I''d give it another go. This will be on my list of ""guilty pleasure"" beers, like Pabst Blue Ribbon and Miller High Life and sometimes, it's good to have something light that's also refreshing and enjoyable. For me, this certainly fit that bill."

"Golden Hue with a white foamy head. Not an overly aromatic beer, very light, subtle smells of grains and grassy notes. Slightly bitter taste, with hints of corn and wheat. Finish is crisp, with little lingering. Poland's ""favourite beer," for me just a tastier version of a coors or budweiser. Nothing special here."

"probably underrated as the imports go. yeah its a classic yellow beer, best consumed as a classy alternative to a natty ice during the college years, but serviceable in other contexts, especially a food one. blonde and fizzy, slightly skunked, but refreshing just the same. metallic and stale, but maybe still a little too good to throw it in a beer pong cup. its brightly carbonated and medium in body for a light lager. one of those imports you dont see too much anymore, but it probably better than most of whats out there, despite the weird flavors and old lager yeast. polish beer certainly can get a whole lot better than this, but in a party context, it works. a lot like a skunky becks or something, german more than anything, but nothing special obviously. im sure on tap where its made its a whole lot better..."

"A decent lager, perfect for refreshment."

"I may buy this again out of sheer wonder wether or not i got a bad one.. but if it does remain as flat and basic, there are much better beers for the price...otherwise.. its an unoffensive euro. and might be just not travelling well."

"Overall - No problem downing a cztery of these on a night out with my Polish przyjaciels! I'll try to let you know how it went in the morning."
""
"O - Overall, this is on the sweeter side as far as Polish lagers go, but, that is basically what the region wants and likes. Least it was not skunked considering it's a clear bottle."

"overall: Not bad but not good. I could see this going over well at an old guys bar in down town Szecien"
""
""
"Overall - not a great beer, but the taste makes up for some of the other deficiencies in this beer. It's not great even by the standards of the style, but better the some and wet and clean and no funny aftertaste and it actually tastes like beer."

"The feel is almost, but not quite, par for the course: very light-bodied, big on crispness, a bit heavily carbonated. Eurp pale lagers can even be good, something I don't believe of AALs or adjuncts in particular, so I know this mouthfeel isn't to par. Light doesn't have to mean thin. It is clean, though."
"O: Well, as soon as I saw that the bottles were twist off, I immediately knew it was probably not going to be too good but it wasn't bad, just another beer. I'd recommend but it won't be great, but not bad either."
""
""
"Overall – A decent and easy drinking lager with a fair level of refreshment. It is rather simple, but has no off flavors making it a good brew to drink when wanting something crisp and simple on a nice hot day while sitting and chatting with friends."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink and is pretty good when compared to other beers in the style. It has a good amount of bitterness to help cut through the malts and hide some of the adjunct flavors."

"The Crack & Glug was masterful and resulted in a finger-and-a-half of dense, foamy, bone-white head with great retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and both Midas and Croesus were seen licking their chops. Nose had the sweet, honey-like quality that speaks to me of adjunct-free lager. I did not have an appreciation for lagers until I embarked on The CANQuest (TM) and came to realize just how many adulterated versions of lager exist in a CAN. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very dry, driven by biscuity/cracker-like malt and grassy hops. Mmm. Finish was likewise quite dry and very tasty. I CAN see drinking more of this, especially on hot summer days."
""
"Overall, OK but not great. I had very low expectations and it wasn't quite that bad. It did at least have some hops, the lager yeast was not too happy it seems or got unhappy at some point, and it tasted like adjunct sugars added that also added some weird impurities. However, it did have some decent malt flavors. At least it's not skunked."

"I haven’t tried many Polish beers in my day, so I have little with which to compare this beer, but I find it non- offensive at best, bland and boring at worst. It reminds me of some of the American lager products so common and popular in the past. There is little going on with this beer, but it does have enough going for it to make it competitive against most of the beers from the Big three."

"330ml can. Dinkel Acker Lager glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Golden color, clear appearance. White, slowly dissipated froth. Close & thick crown. Hops & slightly metallic to the nose. Fizzy & sparkling at first sip followed by rough bitterness. Light body. Medium to high carbonation. Watery texture. Slightly sweet maltiness in the middle overwhelmed by citric astringency. Dry bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: it's drinkable, nothing more"
""
" Notes: this is a below average lager. I could name several American lagers that do the adjunct thing much better. And what's with the 5.6% ABV? That gravity is unnecessary. Why not cut it to 5%, add more malted barley and make a better brew?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I have to say better than average. I wouldn't ever turn down another if it were offered to me."
"It's a nice stock beer. Excellent for the price and casual summer drinking. Certainly worth the $7/6pk. average."
""
"Don't know why this beer doesn't get better reviews. It was the best beer I had in Poland. It was served cold from the tap and went great with my schnitzel. It's crisp and refreshing with a little hops to it. Definitely has that traditional European style and taste to it. I highly recommend when in Poland! I had it in Kracow."

"500ml bottle polish beer"
"First thing that comes to mind is expired Heineken. Looked like any cheap lager you buy on sale at local supermarket. About 1 inch of foam that hung for a while. Was a little bitter but nit horrible. Left a skunky taste in mouth that lingered for a few minutes. Keep this in Poland....no need to make the world suffer with another cheap tasting lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could drink lots of the Tyskie."
"Weak sauce. This is poor and tasteless even by macro lager standards. An unpleasant chemical note detracts even more - at least the average lager is inoffensive. Avoid."
""
"Little to no mouthfeel. Worth trying if you are interested in pale lagers, but not my bag."
""
"Overall your typical lager."
"Overall - An easy drinking lager from Tyskie. Like similar ones to this style, nothing extraordinary about the flavour but has a refreshing quality to it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice pilsner for sure...to style and just basic. I've had better, but worse as well. Would drink it again."
""
"Pours yellow/gold w/ orange tinge from pint bottle to pint glass. Almost headless. Sweet aroma, apple juice? Not a horrid taste, quite a sweet maltiness but negative notes in the finish including a vodka like alcohol. At least, it's crisp and refreshing. First time i've tried this, may or may not be the last. Uninteresting but beats a lot of the domestic mass produceds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a forgettable beer that is certainly drinkable but nothing remarkable or worthy of the gold medals on its label."
"500 ml bottle. Pours pale straw hue with a foamy, lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of grassy hops and hints of grain. Medium, smooth body. Light grassy hops and sweet malt combine on the palate. Medium finish is dominated by bitter, herbal hops. Drinkable brew."
"Drink one if you want a beer from Poland. Drink one if you want a beer that's more difficult to pronounce than it lets on. But don't expect much beyond the bare minimum."
"O: This beer is better than nothing if served ice cold on a hot summer's day in Central Europe. Otherwise - No, Thank You. Rumours say this beer used to be better."
"D - Of the euro lagers I tried, this was at the bottom. Zyweic euro lager was a better tasting beer and I preferred that Polish brew over Tyskie."
"Half litre bottle, poured into Fullers Honey Dew glass. Three finger head which stayed longer than expected. Nice amber colour. Slightly grassy smell, was a bit like an export beer. Sweet taste with a slightly bitter finish, also notes of grain. Has a bit of gas. Decent beer for what it is"
"Crisp apple, pale malt, corn, and... plastic? Weird plastic aftertaste. Everything was fine until that odd note surfaced. Pretty pedestrian and utilitarian Polish lawnmower lager. Feel is prickly and a bit gassy with CO2. That light astringency is the biting carbonation (or industrial processing), no actual hop bitterness is perceptible unfortunately. Extremely light, one note, and ultimately pretty forgettable. Sort of a euro macro summer cookout beer... there are many better Polish lagers out there."
"O - Not bad but not worth seeking, it'll be a refresher with my pizza and garlic bread. Very typical for the style."
"Final Grade: 3.43, a B-."
"All in all I think this is a good beer given the style. It's nothing I would seek out but if it was more readily available I would make it a default beer."
"Overall - For appearing so light this beer sits quite heavy. The taste is what has me sold on this beer. Everything else doesn't really catch my attention. This is the kind of beer id like to kick back and drink out around a fire in the early spring."
"Not the best beer I've ever had in fact very average but very refreshing. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this but wouldn't turn it down if it was a choice at a summer picnic and I wanted something refreshing."
"a very average beer that happens to come from Poland. so far the best of the worst i have tried in my latest lot."
"Overall this is a very nothing better than average beer I would not have this beer again there are better one to try"
"Notes: This is a well made, clean and fresh Lager beer."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-"
"This isn't a bad beer, just rather simple. Bottle says best before 08/09, but it's been refrigerated since purchased. Golden yellow with a white foamy head it's got a very cereal-y, sweet, grainy smell to it. It's got that sweet grain taste as well with hops just in there to bitter it a bit. A little burpy, it's an okay beer that I could see drinking as refreshment at a BBQ."
"I also visited plenty of other bars in Poland's cities, but the common re-occurrence everywhere was Tyskie, and plenty of it. And it's not hard to understand why: this lager is all too easy to drink, especially in high volume, and is void of all the off-putting calamities of most industrially produced lagers. The Poles drink it copiously with good reason."
"Nothing I would search out or order in a bar."
"with all the Polish brews out there I'm sure there's better options then this"
"Aftertaste isn't bad. It's not yucky like Coors or nothing like Miller or stinky like Bud. Fairly drinkable. Not bad for a random small grocery store pick-up, but not something I'll ever get when there's any kind of selection."
"Again, nothing special, but there's nothing overtly wrong with Tyskie either. It's drinkable and actually much better than other Euro Lagers. Now I can say I've had a beer from Poland!"
"Taste: Slight sweetness initially that changes into a alcohol type bitterness. It finishes off pretty balanced but the flavor doesn't stick around too long."
"This is a pretty decent euro lager, just don't pay to much for it. The flavors are well balanced yet still weak. The malt profile is most present yet weak and the hops are leafy, yet weak. Did I mention weak... Still this is a refreshing, yet boring drink. I like it but no real adjectives come to mind. In the same league as Heineken and Stella Artois, not quite as good as Kronenbourg. Pretty pale yellow with a white head, moderate dissipation and some light, patchy, lacing. If you see it at a party drink it but don't buy it for a great experience, just to party."
"D: This is a nice choice for a euro lager, but I feel there have been some other favorites."
"D: Sorry Poland, this was no good. A pretty bad iteration of the pale lager."
"Hardly the best Polish lager I've yet had, but still well in the, um, stadium, I suppose. Maybe I just need to drink many, many more of them (Superstore-style), which is my strongest association with these kinds of beers. Not bad, just not really worth seeking out."
"Nothing special, but a decent beer worth accepting if someone (like my father this Thanksgiving weekend) hands one to you to try. Other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to procure this."
"A pretty good beer overall. Good initial & aftertaste with good clarity. Head retention wasn't the best but other than that there isn't much bad to say about the beer."
"This beer was crisp, refreshing and, overall, quite impressive for the style. If only SABMiller could produce a domestic beer this flavorful."
"Pours a slightly copper, transparent body with a nice head to start. Head dissapated rather quickly. Smells slightly metallic, slight bit of floral hops, bit of malt, pretty much a standard euro pilsner. Tastes like a pretty standard euro pilsner (i.e. Pilsner Urquell) but with a bit more of an alcohol dryness. Overall, a mediocre beer but there is worse out there."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is full and creamy but without anything that makes it stick out. Relatively bland. Very drinkable lager that is far better than most American Adjunct lagers and I could make an evening of if nothing else was available."
"D - High if you like weak Euro lagers."
"Overall: I felt this beer is much better then its rated on the site. Very good beer for hanging out watching some football, you know just chilln. I don't believe that I have ever had a beer from Poland before, and so far so good. I was about 10$ for a six pack and you can diff find a better cheaper beer, however it is worth a try for sure."
"D - It's not a bad beer but it's too light flavour wise."
"D: Nothing seriously wrong, but nothing special. Didn't really like the aftertaste."
"Drink - An average euro beer."
"D-very nice, balanced. I would put this up against a Czech lager. I would drink this beer again."
"Overall: I actually see some promise here. I have a feeling this beer goes bad quickly. Reminds me of Beck's."
"D: A standard Euro Pale Lager - nothing to write home about."
"This beer has a light caramelized grain malt and light syrupy (maybe corn) taste with a light sourness throughout the drinking and into the aftertaste which also has a very light dryness to it."
"I had very big expectations for this beer because my grandfather was from Poland and drank this a lot, ever since i was a young kid i wanted to try it so you could say my expectations were pretty high. poured with very little foam, clear and gold. Tastes very smooth and is very drinkable with a quite dry finish, could drink these all night long. Aroma is descent, but not the best. Considering the best by date was 2 weeks ago, this beer was quite impressive. Tasted much better than most other euro pale lager beers."
"D: Drinks like these kind of lagers usually do - it's clean, doesn't have a lot of flavor, easy enough to drink but doesn't really leave you wanting more after each sip."
"D- Goes down smooth enough to earn a '3' on drinkability in my book... but otherwise, this beer does nothing to impress."
"D - I barely finished the 12 oz bottle."
"Crystal clear and pale golden in colour with a big foamy white head and significant amount of carbonation. The aroma is reminiscent of Czech pilsener, with lots of grassy hops, and a light toffee malt giving it a sweet edge. The taste is clean crisp at the front with a light hoppy bite developing throughout, however it does lack body and feel a bit watery at times. Not a bad beer, just distinctly average, although the lightness does make it quite drinkable."
"D -- Drinkability is good, nothing at all offensive or off in flavors. The skunky aroma doesn't linger. Not the first Pale Lager I'd reach for, but there's no reason to turn one down."
"Eh, it's easy drinking, a euro lager in brown bottle, so not nearly as skunk prone as others of the style, and quite refreshing giving the right situation. Overall good for the style, but not all that flavorful."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pilsner malt scent along with some light hops and a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is average. It is a crisp, clean, easy drinker with a simple pilsner malt flavor. It has a light sweetness and a bit of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is your typical Euro lager. It's light and refreshing and quite quaffable."
"Not bad but really only worth a try if you want to see what folks in Poland are drinking. I'm sure they have some better beers/breweries than this."
"I wouldn't reach for this again. Not very good even for a macro."
"Not too complicated, but well brewed and thoroughly drinkable."
"Worth a try only if you are wanting to say you have tried a beer from Poland. Other than that, it's like pretty much every other Euro Lager out there: mass produced, processed, industrial and middle of the road."
"As for drinkability, its alright, but that ""second stage"" of each taste as well as the aftertaste is something I don't like."
"Drinkability- definitely one of the better lagers, will drink it again, pretty good lager"
"This certainly isn't an offensive beer- it's typical of many of the Polish lagers I've tried- but at $3/bottle I'd be unlikely to purchase it again."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich gold color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is good, sweet and malty. Taste is not very flavorfull and a tad bitter. Watery and bitter in the mouth. Drinkability is pretty average. Overall a so-so beer."
"Hahahaha This one caught me off guard! Got a can here in Scharbeek, Brussels, Belgium in a little shop across from the train station. Poured with an excellent, big, white, foamy, frothy head and just a bit of lace. Color is a very clear rich gold. Aroma is a hoppy bitter malt, nice and beery. Flavor is a big let down - instead of the clean hoppy/malty qualities of the aroma you get an over sweet malt with a touch of hop. Undercarbonated. Bleh. Don't like the body; in one way it seems heavy malty sweet and in another thin. Weird. Me no like."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with a small pure white bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of grainy malt with no apparent hops and not much else to report. Taste is also dominated by some grainy malt with a stale aftertaste and no hops to clearly speak of. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Probably a bit better fresh directly in Poland but this is not something I would need to buy often."
"I'd get more if only because of the drink by date."
"Looks, smells and tastes similar to some of the macro lagers we're familiar with, but with a hint of skunkiness, but not in a bad way. It's fine for it's style and it doesn't have some of the bad aftertastes that I get from similar style beers. It's pretty clean and refreshing and it's easy to drink. I probably wouldn't pick it up again now that I've tried it, but if I was in Poland and saw it on tap I'd probably have one if I was in the mood for a cold pale lager."
"Would drink again, especially if narrowed down to other macro lagers."
"Definetly the pick of the litter when it come to other mass produced Polish lagers. Would also prefer over other production domestic lagers."
"One of few beers I've enjoyed more from a bottle than a glass."
"D: You could pound this but why would you want to? Better than American Macros but not by much."
"Drinkability: A decent, light-hearted brew to cut through barbecued foods on a hot day."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It was yellow and fizzy in appearance, the head did not have great staying power. The aroma had the slightest hint of grass. The flavor was much better than expected. A very pleasant bitterness was up front and it had a dry finish. It tasted more like a helles lager than a pale lager. It was light bodied, and had average carbonation. The beer went down very easily and bleneded in with the snacks i was eating."
"Heavier than average carbonation light, refreshing but not much in flavor."
"(rated Dec 1, 2007)"
"Six of these were included in Costco bargain pack of 18 European beers (pitiful categorization, I know) that was at a party I attended tonight. My expectations of this beer were pretty low from the start but I tried to keep an open mind. It poured a clear yellow with a white head that instantly fled. Its aroma was almost non-existant but at least non-offensive: it smelled faintly of camomile tea. Tasted of almost nothing except light and unspecifiable malts and a faintly floral hoppy lingering . The carbonation in the light body was actually quite pleasant but not enough so to redeem this beer."
"Drinkability: Nice, crisp, and refreshing. This beer was a pleasant surprise- being a Euro Pale Lager I expected it not to be as good as it is. This is also a beer I could drink very fast and have many of, and for a beer that drinkable it has good flavor. Worth a shot!"
"The mouthfeel is tangy in the beginning and smooth at the end. This is a pleasant, quite sessionable production beer. It feels like a light beer to the stomach, and it's hard to believe it's 5.6% ABV."
"Poured form a 500ml can into a pint glass. Poured a yellow straw color. Beer is very clear. Forms a frothy head that subsides into a white film. Smell has slight hint of hops, malt, and corn. Taste is nothing spectacular. Beer is sweet with a little hop aftertaste and some cereal. Watered down yet very clean and crisp. Mouth is light and vary carbonated. A very drinkable beer but lacking in flavor."
"Overall- Bland. Easy to drink and good on a warm day but not worth seeking out."
"D: Overall not that great a beer. Decent for a session, or with food."
"D: this is a kind of beer you drink once to try it, but it doesn't desserve any more attention"
"D- This is a simple, but very tasty euro pale. It'd be a toss up probably to choose between this and stella, But i think this one might have a slight edge. I will probably be drinking this again."
"D: Easy to drink and the taste was a decent surprise that was tolerable, if not somewhat enjoyable. Not interesting or different, but okay."
"Had this beer in a 500ml bottle at the Polish Centre while I was there for Salsa Night (dancing not the sauce). Drinks ok with a decent malt sweetness. Not a grassy pils but rather a middle of the road lager with a seemingly cornless finish. Worth a try especially after a tiring merengue."
"D: Wasn't to thrilled about the drinkability here. A little coarse hopping and balance wise leads this to a subpar average experience."
"Taste? eh...ok...highly carbonated. Went well with my braunschweiger and onion sandwich...so I'll give it that. However, now that I'm through my 6 pack, I highly doubt I'll ever pick up another."
"Borderline drinkable, there is much better out there even in the realm of mediocre eurolagers."
"Definitely not worth the $1.50 I paid for it, there are better American options for the same price."
""
"Final Verdict = I have tried this beer, now its time to move on. I would not buy this beer again. Not because I hated it, just because there are many other beers that are better than this."
"D-Good, but pretty run of the mill euro lager. A good lawnmower beer on a hot day."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the pale lager style."
"Still trying to figure out the ""European Pale Lager"" style, and how it differs from an American Pale Lager. Same thin, watery appearance, frail head of bubbles, and sugary, husky taste. Maybe I see a similarity between this and some German Pilsners I've tasted, but there's not a ton to recommend this beer or, honestly, the style."
"When poured into a mug, this beer was not a straw yellow, but more of a golden urine yellow with a thin head of white foam. This head of foam dissipated into oblivion. It left no sign of rings or even lace for that matter. The aroma was that of candy fruit slices, a splash of apple juice, and some sweet malted grains at the end. The taste was lightly sweet with malted grains and nothing else. The taste was just the malted grains. The mouthfeel was light, heavy on the carbonation, and had a really faint aftertaste of carbonation and sweet malted grains. In the end, it's just another plain alomst tasteless lager. It's a good thing it's cheap!"
"D: This is a pretty good little lager, nicely balanced flavours and a smooth, crispness that makes it an easy-drinking, refreshing Euro-lager. Better than many other Euro-macros out there and at a good price. I will certainly buy this beer again - perfect for a summer session @ the beach."
"Try a Tyskie for yourself i would much rather drink Zyweic or Okocim and especially a Lomza if I were in the mood for a good Polska Lager."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Overall, I found myself enjoying Tyskie Gronie. It had way more complexity in aroma and taste than I expected. I found myself surprised to see it listed as a Euro pale lager (aka: Euro piss beer). No complaints here."
"It also packs a different taste. I don't get any of the usual skunkiness. I do note some yeast spiciness but somewhat weak malt and hop influences. It also has a slightly heavier body and lighter moderation than similar beers. All this combines for a beer that sets itself apart in the Euro Pale lager world. But it still isn't something I would seek out."
"Enjoy!"
"12oz brown bottle from a European sampler pack. Pours translucent yellow/light tan very lightly colored body with virtually no head. Smells grainy-sweet with a hint of DMS. Tastes like biscuit and caramel malt with hints of hops and DMS. Medium in body with slightly less carbonation than expected. Tastes much better than it looks, and one sip definitely invites another. A beer that I wouldn't necessarily seek out, but would not refuse either. Very drinkable with few flaws."
"Looks like a typical straw-yellow pale lager, but actually smells of clean malts with biscuit and toast aromas. Those fade, however, once the beer hits your palate and you get a macro-Euro lager tang that dominates the flavors with only a touch of grains and hops edging on around the sides."
"I like this for now but my tast change alot so this may be hated by me in the future.I would have it again."
"Plenty of carbonation made for an above average mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer, especially for the warmer summer months. I could see my AB drinking friends enjoying it on a regular basis."
"The first time I had this beer I had the feeling that I was drinking very dilute and somewhat alcoholic shampoo. Surprisingly, though, this was not altogether unpleasant. Refreshingly malty with a grassy hop finish and almost no bitterness, this beer is good to have a meal with because it's not distracting but only adds that unique malt character to whatever you're eating."
"Recommended"
"Was a tap beer and came with about 1/4in head with minimal lacing. This beer had a malty aroma and was pale golden in color. This beer had good carbonation and had a nice feel in the mouth. There was an initial taste of malt, but had a hop finish. This was a very nice drinking beer for a warm day outside. I could sit in a pub and have a few."
"Exp 14/07/08. Clear, light golden, not much head but a ring around the glass with large bubble carbonation to begin with. The smell is pretty much ... not there, not in this bottle anyway. Crisp, dry, cleansing macro lager feel with a mildly bitter finish and lemony aftertaste. I found nothing particularly noteworthy in this beer and I felt much the same way when I was in Poland two years ago and had my share of these. While it doesn't offend, it doesn't distinguish itself either. Set against the other popular Polish imports, I prefer a Zywiec or an Okocim."
"drinkability is good, just because this is so light and lacking character, lovers of macros will probably go for this one."
"Easy to throw these back. Like the advantages of a nice American Lager, but with no offensive corn sugar sting. Great for summers."
"Summary: In the battle between the major Polish macro brews (Tyskie and Zywiec), I'd take a Zywiec."
"Poured out of a brown bottle a golden color with a white head that disapears quickly. Very clean looking. It had the aroma of a sweeter malt and European pilsner hops. It had a sweet taste with a nice dry bitter end. A very smooth beer, kind of filling in the mouth."
"Pours very light gold, perhaps more of a yellow, with a very delicate, perfectly white head that fades quickly to just a dusting. Weak aroma of cooked grains and very mild hops. On the palate, corny sweetness first off, then some sourish bitterness that sticks to the mouth unpleasantly. Mouthfeel is zesty with hops, but suffers from a strange heaviness for such a light beer. Overall, this beer is just your average macro lager, which means it isn't good."
"While vacationing in Rehoboth I picked up this polish brew at the liquor store from the singles for about a dollar or so. Appears a pale golden straw hue with large bubbled rather creamy textured head leaves behind some even fine lacing after dwindling slowly down the edges of my pint. Aroma has a mild skunky dose of hops that fits the Euro pale lager style quite well to offset the hops come some cereal sweetness blended with a cooked veggies tone. Flavor contains mild bitterness and more of that characteristic skunk not too much green bottled gone wild skunk but the edge is there along with this comes mild lemongrass blended with hints of light toasted malts and corn/rice adjuncts in there as well. Mouthfeel is light moderate factory made carbonation does tickle the back of the throat a bit, but smooth and unihibited for the most part. Drinkability is decent but not a brew I'm dying to try again, solid for a Euro pale definitely refreshing I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"D-bleh. Polish for Bud. Kind of crappy, I will not be buying this again."
"Definitely a step up from American macro lagers...really not half bad."
"For me Tyskie was a really enjoyable beer. It was easy to drink, and was a nice suprise from the Christmas Party pack, since Atlanta does not carry it usually."
"It's color is a clear pee yellow. There's not too much of a smell to it. It has a very smooth taste, and it tastes like most other pale lagers. It goes down easy, and is a good general drinking beer. It is a beer that you can easily drink a few of them and enjoy each one of them."
"Taste is pretty standard. Cereal adjuncts, sweet sweet malts, little hop character, a touch of skunk, and a pretty smooth finish. Mouthfeel was fizzy, a bit thin, and somewhat sticky. Drinkability is ok. Honestly, nothing stood out about this beer, good or bad. A week from now I won't remember I had it. Not awful, but completely forgettable."
"Short white head pops its way to a thin film. Bright golden beer holds a few streams of bubbles. Lightly sweet pale malt in the nose and a pinch of herbal hops. Crisp clean Pils malt flavor up front that becomes corny towards the finish. The hops a tea tasting aspect to the beer. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Without the corny flavor it would make a nice Helles. It's not bad. You should be able to get past the corny notes, but I'd rather drink something different."
"I do not know why this is listed twice (also as Gronie). There is some hop burps here and a decent white head on top of pale yellow. Nothing attractive about the scent. OK serviceable with above average carbonation. Not too malty, but not noticeable hop effect. There are far better Polish beers within reach."
"I have no doubt that my somewhat favorable impressions of Tyskie Gronie are due to the fact that I laid my hands on a pretty fresh bottle. I've always suspected that most European beer doesn't get a fair shake from us Yanks because of age issues. If you see a single that looks freshly minted, I'd say snap it up since decent versions of this style are so hard to come by."
"This is a good beer. It went on sale in the local A&P so I picked up a couple of 12 packs. I am no expert but I know what I like and I liked this beer. The only fault is the cheap packaging. I grabbed the carton from the cart and the beer came crashing down ...what a mess.... oh well. Nice beer, nice buzz. I will definitely buy Tyskie again when it goes on sale."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, light-golden color with lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and a two finger, bubbly head. Smell is sweet with malt, not much hop presence. The taste also has a malty sweetness to it, but it is pretty well balanced with bittering hops. The mouthfeel is light in body with a foamy carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable beer, but the taste isn't outstanding, but it's not offensive either."
"Pours nice, clear, with a little head. Not too much smell really, but didnt expect too much from this lager anyways. Tastes nice and easy, but nothing remarkable. Feel is nice on the tongue with little bubbles here and there. Easy to drink with no real negative aspects-something that one could enjoy for a decent session as long as they can take the 5.50% ABV."
"To my nose and palate most lagers have very little aroma or defining tastes that can be pontificated about. I do however, try to give an honest view on these beers. I could find nothing positive to write about this beer, so I'll just say it is one of the worst beers I have ever had. Strangley, the canned version faired a lot better."
"From the Sams Club import sampler pack at a Christmas Party, this was the first time Id run across this beer. Pours a golden clear with numerous bubbles and a nice creamy head, white and pillowy. Slow fade leading good lacing behind. The appearance, unfortunately, is the best part of this beer. Nose is dominated by yeast, dry malt, and adjuncts (rice?). Tastes bready, of dry malt, dry character overall, with a slightly bitter finish, just a touch above average macro swill. Mouth is nicely carbonated, watery, but not too thin. Drinkability is just a touch above averagethese are drinkable if nothing else is around, and are certainly preferable to most domestic macros. Overall, a good-looking but overall rather average Euro lager."
"Better than many of the other east-Euro lagers out there, inoffensive, drinkable."
"Nothing overly exciting, but above average for what it is."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, mild taste pairs well with almost anything. Not much to criticize (or commend) here. I will gladly drink again, but I will not seek it out."
"Adjuncts not evident in the taste, very grainy with a good dose of bittering hops, a slight lemony sourness to balance it out. Herbal taste begins to show itself as the beer warms. There's not much in the way of sweetness in this beer, which is a godsend, as I though it would be more cloying than it is. Very clean tasting, a bit overcarbonated and thin bodied, sticks in the throat a little. but non-offensive really. Easy to chug to be sure. Fits the definition of average to a T."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"Although I find this lager very unassuming, I can't really point out any serious flaws in it either, except perhaps that it is a bit one-dimensional. I can't comment on any interesting points or characteristics about it as well. To sum, a decent looking lager with great head retention, neutral aroma and flavour and a decent mouthfeel. A good quaffer for a hot day, and it puts most N. American macro lagers to shame. However it simply doesn't leave much of an impression with me either."
"Poured a pale golden color with modest white puffy head. Smell is minimal with a slightly bitter note. Taste presents more hop bitterness, yet has a nice refreshibng taste. Finishes with a distinct dryness, that is fairly pleasant. Nothing sticks out about this beer. Typical for the style."
"Not bad actually. Typical of most Polish lagers."
"Tyskie is a pretty basic European lager from Poland. It pours a clear deep-golden body with steadily-streaming bubbles beneath a short head of creamy bright-white foam. The head retention is average and there's only limited lacing left about the glass. The nose expresses straw-like malt and an herbal hoppiness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp. The flavor is clean with a surprisingly broad malt and hop character. It has a bit of a nutty character that's interesting, and I can't really place where it's coming from, although I suspect it's the grain. And although there's also a very light touch of fruitiness to it, it's really quite one-sided with just the grainy malt and herbal hops dominating. The bitterness is remarkably well-balanced though. The low-key sweetness of the grainy malt and the kept-in-check bitterness of the hops do more to dance together more than they do to lock horns in a stalemate. Eventually, the bitterness prevails at the swallow, and the herbal hops linger amidst a dull bitterness. It's decent enough, but not really memorable."
"I found it to be okay. I'm not going to stay away from it but I won't have it unless it's purchased for me."
"Received a 6er of these in a beer of the world pack. This is my first Polish beer so lets see how it goes pours a bright gold color with a small head thats very white, it leaves a light lacing effect. The smell is very faint and consists of malts, mild hops and an extremely light scent of fruits. Very interesting, not what I expected this to taste like after smelling. Its got flavors of hops, some deep almost chocolaty malts a very light bubblegum taste and an overall earthy feel. Pleasantly surprised to be honest, the smell was a let down but the taste is pretty darn good."
"Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This beer is a nice choice when a warm day beckons, you crave a lighter beer and you won't settle for a macro."
"Bottom line: A decent enough lager but there's a lot of them out there that I can say that about. Worth a try."
"Grainy taste with an herbal grass quality. The finish is extremely crisp. Mouthfeel is clean and neutral with a touch of honey sweetness. I was surprised at how easy this was to drink. Served rather cold, I was able to down this quickly as it was so refreshing. I must admit, I am pleasantly surprised. Better than average Euro Pale Lager."
"Doesnt appear to be anything too special, almost looks watered. Crisp first taste, a little sweet, but definately some hops and goes down smooth. Not a lot of aftertaste, it hangs but is by no means overpowering. Would recommend for someone seeking to begin exploration of Polish or Chezch beers."
" This is a good beer to drink if you're getting bombed in a basement bar in Krakow or Wroclaw but not if you're looking for a top beer experience."
"Drinkable, but not something to buy again."
"Mouthfeel is watery, corny, and pretty gross."
"Overall - A very average beer... worth a try maybe once...."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium. Almost seems a little watery at first but becomes sticky enough to provide some satisfaction. This is really an easy drinker, shows no faults, and has a nice delicate and refreshing flavor. I personally would prefer a little more bitter, bit it's no big deal. At $8.99 a 12pack this should make a great summer refresher and a nice changeup from the Dinkel-Acker CD-Pils that I frequently get for a cheap cold beer."

"Drinkability was average, this would be a good session beer to break in a beginner to the wonderful world of hops."
"I would rate this beer as average, it does differ itself from some of the bad East European beers, but there are better beers from Poland."
"M&D: overall the mouthfeel remains quite refreshing thanks to the medium fizzy body. But the flavour is too timid and quite bland to be honest, while the body is way too thin for this 5.7%abv lager, tasting more like a weaker and cheap lager. Not awful, but certainly not recommended."
"Light copper in colour and well carbonated. A little bit of grassy hops and skunk on the nose. Cereal malts, herbs, and subtle spice flavors are apparent. Thin bodied, and a short finisher. A fairly average and drinkable pilsner, but it needs considerably more bittering, flavoring, and aroma hops to be of any interest."
"Clear medium yellow look, white head of a half inch in hieght, decent duration -- but breaking up with cheap large bubbles exploding. Laces in sparse downward dripping strings. Alight maple syrup aroma, some glue, some slight grape suggesting bare hops. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation a bit too fizzy for me. Flavor starts out malty, some corn syrup elements, but backed up by a medicinal bitterness. Becomes flat and thinner mid mouth. Finish is a little below par, chalky and slightly unpleasant in the throat. A little more hoppy than some, average drinkability, some off things going on."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a white head that fizzled away shortly after the pour. The aroma was mild. It has a light malt smell with no real hop aroma coming through. The taste is refreshing. Light malt flavor with a little bit of hop in the finish. Leaves a little bit of a dryness on the tongue. Good mouthfeel, medium carbonation, and a light body. Its a drinkable beer. I would recommend it. It's a good drinking beer. I could see putting a few of these down in one sitting easy."
"Drinkability is decent, but this one fails to impress."
"Pours a very standard clear gold under a very standard one finger white head that fades pretty quickly to leave absolutely nothing behind. Standard adjunct corn and malt nose with a run-of-the-mill metallic hoppy scent. Standard light and pretty prickly mouth. The taste is pretty standard for a macro - some sweet barley and corn, followed by a touch of hops with a hard edge and a lingering bite. The aftertaste is like chewing on a tin can. There are so many better beers in the world, but this is nothing less than a mass produced, least common denominator product that I am sure sells well within the standard. Yawn."
"It took me this long to get to a Polish beer. This one was on clearance for 99 cents at Cub Food, so why not. This is pretty good as this style goes. Pours a big temporary head over a golden body. Definite bitter hop taste seems to impart slight toasty quality to the malt. Smell is pleasant, but with slight oxidation, but thats the chance you take."
"4th of the 10 LCBO bland euro lagers. This one pours like a labatt product golden, clear, fizzy white head that doesnt last...faint aromas of boiled grains with light medicinal hopping. sharp front side (mostly from too much carbonation obviously injected to bulk up the mouth feel of this thin lager) light malty taste...medicinal hops increase into the fast finish where they leave a light bittering taste... a bland forgettable Polish pilsner."
"Mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery with tiny bubbles of carbonation. A nice brew to drink in the summer or when you're just looking for an uncomplicated lager to quench your thirst."
"This beer pours a super pale gold with a quickly dissipating head and minimal lacing. The aroma is quite weak, with sweetish cooked corn and just a wiff of hops. The taste is a little better. The downside is the adjunct laden malt profile. The up side is that this actually has some hop character. Theres nice herbal, grassy hop flavors on the palate. Unfortunately the plasticy adjuncts detract from the hops. The mouthfeel is processed and there is a slightly chemical aftertaste. Overall this is only an average beer. The extra hoppiness distinguishes it from most of its Eastern European Brethren but its still not great."
"(Dec 2005) Second taste...same. But the price has gone up to $1.19. Put another buck in and buy a 24 ounce Becks Bomber."
"A deep honey colored liquid and butter-colored head that holds up pretty well actually. The aromas are fairly intense with piles of cracked, raw grains including barley, wheat and corn plus a dose of sweetened, candied hop resin. Fruits are strawberries and canned, fruit cocktail. On the palate it's broad, creamy, dry and nutty. The texture is full and chewy. The finish lingers on a harmonious note of roasted herb and dry honey flavors. Wonderfully executed beer that is plagued with none of the usual Warsaw Pact lager nonsense such as extreme alcohol presence, sewery hops flavors and jagged, industrial textures. It falls short only on one point - ambition. This is a rather straightforward, even simple lager - however generous and rich."
"Okay, most Polish beers I've had were sub-par. Essentially, skunked pilzners. This was a bit different. Better. Tyskie pours a crisp, light yellow colour. The head starts out around two fingers, and disipates to one. What impressed me is that the head lasted until the end. What confused me was that for such a long lasting head, their was no lace. Take a big gulp, and the lace quickly runs down the glass and back into the head. It's as if the foam is calling them to come back, in fear it will disappear. Smells somewhat skunky. It's a brown bottle, so I doubt it was from light. It's a faint skunk smell, so I'm assuming it is the saaz hops. Their's also a unique malt smell. Not sweet, but starchy. Like stale bread. Tastes like bread at first, followed by a bitter aftertaste. No skunky taste whatsoever. The smell is still their, but the taste of skunk is nonexistent. Dry, carbonated mouthfeel. A bit light. Not a bad beer. One I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"Pours to a quickly retreating head and pale yellow color. Aroma is weak, with grainy malt and typical import hop smell. Flavor is dry and bland. Decent hop and alcohol bite in the finish. Bland as hell and boring. The best thing about this purchase was the price. 99 cents for a 500ml bottle can't be beat for an import."
"Pale yellow. Really sweet and flabby, slightly syruppy texture, pretty bland in general however. Oh well. Another challenge for the character minimum, i'm really sorry, but i couldn't write more, there was nothing to write about, i could write stuff, like the size of the bottle what the label looked like, but theres really no point."
"Mouthfeel was kind of thin, but drinkabilty is ok, if youre looking for a no brainer type beer."
"What can i say other than this was another clear, golden lager with little distinction. The headed faded fast. The nose was dull...very mild on the hop count. The taste again, was mild and bland. A crisp and clean mouthfeel. Drinkable but...what else? i dunno. The bottle claims that Tyskie won ""Gold Medal and Grand Prix at the Brewing Industry Awards in London."
"Nice, light, golden colour with a dense white head. Strong lagery aroma with some sweetness. Medium-bodied; Sweetness in the taste, somewhat different than the normal lager. A sweet malt taste in the finish. Overall, a nice and refreshing brew. A pretty good beer for the style!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, lacking the fluffiness of a good pilsner style beer. Drinkable, sure, memorable, no."
"Pours a light golden and features champagne like carbonation, and sports a moderate head for the style and a trace of sticky lace. Aromas are clean and typical with grainy malt aromas followed by very light hopping. A refreshing brew that goes easy on the hop and just right on the malt. This is exactly the kind of brew that you want when you stock up at the local Polish deli. And, we have alot of em here in Chicago. Just right with a deli tray, and some perogies."
"Taste leans to the sweet side and has a mouth coating that will not quit."
"Anyways, in hopes of freshness still being a possibility, I pour it. SKUNKED! Yuck, the aroma was noticeable from across the room. It smells like Heinekin times 10. Well not so fast skunk! First sip, and....well...it was ok. I didn't taste but a smidgeon of skunkiness. What I did taste was a little bit of that pale lager sweetness and a touch of hops in the finish. Zingy carbonation, slightly watery mouthfeel, not all that bad. Smell? horrible. Taste? passable as semi-fresh. So I pinch my nose and finish, not as bad as I thought. I thought the drain beckoned it's call like the devil. But this beer was tolerable, maybe even better than tolerable. I will eventually get around to buying a FRESH bottle of this and re-reviewing it. Until then, make sure you check the dates!"
"I had reservations but they were unfounded, as this was a decent brew. My major complaint is that this beer seemed way too overcarbonated. Otherwise there was nothing offensive about it and I look forward to trying Tyskie's other offerings. I noted that ""Surgeon General"" was spelled ""Sugeron General"" on the label. Insert Polish joke here."
