"Obviously a great world wide rebound beer."

"Nice Amber look and pleasant feel, however I have always found this beer to be a litter bitter"
"As with Stella, this is one of the first beers that got me in the door to appreciating beer so it will always be one of my favorites.  I personally would give it a 4.5 with Stella, however it is much better on tap than in the bottle and there aren't very many places around here that have Heineken on tap."
"My go to cheap beer"
""
""
"Beer without any interest, just made for people who wants to drink something fresh or for parties"
""
""
""
"Excellent taste.  Very crisp and distinctive."
""
""
""
""
""
"Must drink 8 to enjoy full effect."
"I've had this beer several times, and it almost always comes skunked. I have no clue why this overpriced crap is so popular. It's the Budweiser of Europe. I have no clue why people here in America think it's in any way a fancy beer."
"Smooth, dry, cracker taste. The hops are nice and peppery on the tongue. Excellent anytime beer."
""
""
"Have not had one of these in years. I can't believe I actually used to drink this stuff. Bland, thin and watery. Won't be buying again."
""
""
"Nothing special.  Average lager beer"
"Can't beat Heineken's taste When very cold"
"Skunked.  Every bottle I have ever had tasted like this one…Friggin skunked"
"I personally don't like it"
""
"Very average beer, is all i have to say."
""

""
"Served in a Pilsner glass"

"One of my favorite go-to's. That's all there is to it"
""
""
"Smooth and foreign. My first favorite. Refreshing on a hot day"
""

"Taste good but still not the perfect one"
""
""
""
""
""
"Another lite beer with a little floral/spice. Ok."
"Very bland beer with a watered down taste."
"Good beer, slightly more bitter than the average, but a clean crisp taste, very refreshing."
""
"Don't want to review, just my opinion."
""
""
"Great taste to begin with. Fresh, hoppy and a nice bitterness. Although for me it goes flat rather quickly and the taste then becomes sickly. I am referring to bottles bought in the UK i dont know if the US version is different."
""
"Love the skunkiness!  Always will."
""
""
"too bland for my liking"
"Very mild flavor and watery body, I really don´t like heineken for regular drinking, I get some at my friends house who thinks this is the best beer available from watching too much tv."
""
"Decent lager, good in the summer"
""
""
""
"One of the better big name lagers you can get. For those who have never tried, a word of advice. On tap, it's best. in a keg/mini keg, it's also great. In a can, it's often gone sour, and in bottles, you can have a hit or miss experience. I've rated it based on tap and keg performance."
""
"One of the better big brewery offerings.  It has a light bitterness, light body and a subtle background biscuit sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable and refreshing beer for everyman and the first step into the Euro import market. Much better than any American Adjuncts  but pales in comparison to its pilsner competitors."
"Standard lager, nothing offensive or inoffensive about it."
""
""
"So skunky, I've tried it half a dozen times - just bad. I've heard it's totally different fresh?"
"Looks okay, smells good and very smooth to drink."
""
"Is better than other domestic out there"
""
""
""
""
""
"2/3 - Work Event. Drank a lot while I was younger. Decent beer. Overall 3.0."
"A throwback from the past, this one usually has a skunky smell that greets you once you pop the cap....built for college kids...this is just a watery mess that somehow has a massive advertising budget to keep it afloat"
""
""
""
"It an OK beer.  But why pay more for this when you can drink Bud or Coors for cheaper?"
""
""
""
"Good lager that's often skunky.  Better in the canned version and always stands out with its German malt flavor."
""
""
"A good, solid commercial import."
""
"Used to drink this somewhat regularly before the craft revolution."
""
"I personally like the skunky smell in a beer, but this is too intense. Other than that overall this is a drinkable but very bland beer."
""
""
"Mild beer, a bit skunky. Something to get if you're not really into beers."
"It's a classic beer when you got nothing else."
""
"Its my favorite skunked beer"
"Poured into a 500ml Paulaner glass from a pint can.  No green glass issue with the can.  1 finger head.  Yellow appearance and  smell is what you would expect a little malt but not much more.  Taste is refreshing and goes down easily.  When I need a break from the IPA and imperial stouts this is still a solid choice and at $5 for a 4 pack of pints it is half the price of my SunKing addiction."
""
""
""
"This beer has a tremendous sentimental value to me. Growing up in former Soviet Union this was the first foreign beer I tasted. Still a solid brew to me after all these years of having the amazing American brews, the best in the World."
""
"Heineken is something I return to every now and then to remind myself about the journey that I've taken as a beer drinker. This was the first brew that I ever sampled on draught. In Holland in fact. I was all of 15 years old, and no one batted an eyelash when I ordered up my first glass. Ahh Europe... Well, decades later I picked up a 6-pack at a local gas station and was a bit disappointed that they  have departed from their signature stubby bottles in favor of a more generic looking longneck. I had no plans to actually review this beer so I never even poured it in to a glass. Even so, the bottle still emanated that familiar sulfurous skunk aroma. I've come to actually enjoy that lightstruck lager scent. There isn't much else to the nose. Maybe a little corn sweetness. In the flavor department I was a little disappointed. It's been awhile since I've had a Heineken, but I seem to recall that it had more pop to it with that Euro pale lager funk. This rendition was very light on flavor. Smooth, crisp, slightly drying with just a hint of dankness. It was so much cleaner and less controversial than I recalled. Watery, with fizzy carbonation and popcorn-like hints of adjuncts in the finish. I was able to crush that 6-pack without any problem. In fact, when I was done, I wondered what happened. If not for the buzz, I couldn't be sure that I even had any beer at all. Still, there's nothing to complain about here. I only wish there was a little more of that aroma and flavor that has come to define Heineken in the US. This was so mild that it really gets lost in the lager mix."
""
""
"better than bud or coors but not much..."
"This is a World Class Beer......NOT!!!"
""
"My first love, but taste buds have grown towards other flavors lol"
"Very bland over priced lager"
""
"Actually it tastes in Holland as draft drastically different from US bottles. My Gringo friend when he tried it in Amsterdam brewery said: Wow, if this beer would taste in US like that he would be drinking just Heineken all day long. May be pasteurization kills the bottle taste. In Holland they use premium A1 yeast strain and that what makes this beer very interesting. Plus a tradition..."
"Your average Euro Pale Lager; nothing special here. Some sentimental value for me, since this was the first beer I ever finished alone, but that's pretty much it, folks. A tell-tale tinge of lemon in the first sip, but that's probably just me and my oversensitive palate."
"Nothing special just a nice lager"
""
"Enjoyable.  Drinkable.  Nothing special.  I always consider this beer an American Pale Lager with an attitude."
"Purchased at the LCBO for $2.70 in a 500 ml can. Much better options out there for a cheaper price, and that's really my biggest concern."
"Wouldn't drink this farmers piss."
"Skunk flavor & smell from the light spoiling the drink inside the green bottles."
""
"I was thrown off with a strange taste."
""
""
"Way better out of the can in summertime, the bottles are usually skunky."
""
"Unbelievable high-grade drinking beer (on the expensive side). A 5% Pilsner lager with a faint but crisp hops aftertaste. EuroBud basically."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Go-to Pilsener for me. Probably not a huge surprise as this is by far the most sold and served beer in Holland. Heineken is quite good, but not special in any sense of the word. Of course, as a macro produced pilsener this is not the best beer in the world, but in my opinion, it doesn't deserve the hate it often gets."
"This just tastes pretty bad"
"Green bottles should be a big enough red light. It was all that was in the fridge at a party lol."
""
""
""
"Where's my PBR?"
""
""
"Really nice beer in comparison to other production beers."

"Taste was alright but didn't like the lingering taste"

"I had a bottle of this at a diner on my way back from Lancaster, PA this evening.  The place didn't have anything on tap, and all their domestics were lousy AALs.  What hit me right away when I grabbed the bottle was the very strong skunky odor.  The appearance of the brew matches other Euro pales I've had.  The taste is mild, with a nasty edge of skunk on the back end.  Moderate carbonation is prominent on the mouthfeel.  Overall, this is a passable beer, but not much more than that.  If I am going to drink a Euro lager, I'll go with Peroni or Stella."
"Solid beer but nothing to brag about"
"I could swear that back in the 80s, and in Europe this was a great tasting beer.  But what you can get now just doesn't live up to the memory."
"The taste is a quite distinctive yeast flavor with a tiny hint of hops, crisp and smooth it goes down easy. The aftertaste is clean and refreshing."

"For a pale lager, Beats Budweiser or any BMC macro.  Really beyond that, not better than my Craft beers, But For Mass produced beer, This is a good offering. can skunk though. Be a good idea to get this one fresh if you can. Kegs would be best option."

"Overall, it's completely drinkable, but there's just not much flavor to it.  I don't think it's as bad as many people seem to think, because there are no out and out BAD flavors to it, but there's not really much of a good flavor to it either."

"It never ceases to amaze me that the “normal” flavor profile of this beer is skunk-like. I'm not sure if it is the ingredients, the brewing process, the storage process or the green glass bottles but I have experienced the same thing each time I have sampled it over the years."
""
"Although not bad, it is a forgettable beer. To me, this is a budget lager. I normally would only buy this if I was low on money. Nevertheless, it isn't a bad choice."

"When I was like 14 I used to go down to the shore every summer and pound these ""green grenades""  on the pier away from the lights with my cousin Ronny. Now I don't know a ton about beer, but any beer thats light and airy enough for a 14 year old to kill 9 of in a single sitting is doing something right. Shortly after I moved on to harder stuff for a while but rediscovered the joy and memories of that slender green bottle when I got a couple years older and started hitting the clubs. Word to the wise - no girl doesn't like a good Heineken so that puts it pretty high on my list."

"A classic beer that is a no brainer to enjoy. Pours a light yellow, with a good head, this is a flavorful Lager that is one of my favorite beers. I find Heineken to be a pleasant tasting brew, one that ranks among the best imported beers I've had. I've had better beers, but Heineken is a classic and refreshing beer. I grew up drinking this beer, so it's only natural that I love it the way I do."

"O – An odd Euro lager. It is not straight down the line for the style as there is more sweetness in this than I would be used to or even expect. That aside this beer is more than drinkable and certainly deserves a higher rating than it is presently enjoying. Is this super exciting? NO. Is it worth the heavy imported price in the USA? NO. Are there better dutch lagers out there? YES.... But is it drinkable and even enjoyable in the right circumstance and setting? YES most definitely!"

"I don't like when people give Heineken a bad rap and continue to promote other lagers full of garbage preservatives and additives but everyone is entitled to their opinion that's what reviews are for. Not the best GMO free beer but its good and has good availability. I would choose Amstel over it but I enjoy it. I like its fizz. Smell isn't great but it really doesn't taste like it smells. Good for any occasion really. But once the temp raises its awful."

"From what I see people here give really negative reviews for this beer. I don't know, maybe worse batch? In my humble opinion - this is basically the best ""quick"" lager beer you can get on the market. Wanna have a quick light beer? This is the perfect choice. I'll choose it over any other lager for a casual talk with friends. The taste is really good (cooled down), it doesn't smell terribly BAD and has an okay color."
""
"In my opinion this is the worst beer on the market today. Or I should say the American Heineken is the worst. Apparently if you get it in Europe it is way better but I have yet to see. It was near clear with a little fiz. The smell was skunky as was the taste with a bad lingering aftertaste. It's one of the most popular beers in America and I just don't understand why."

"Overall 3.25: Lagers are lagers and this one is one of the best, which isn't saying much. It's always trendy to slam the ""mega-brews," but there is a reason Heineken is one of the world's most popular: it's actually pretty good. Excellent with all food types, this Dutch juggernaut just keeps on rolling after all these years. Certainly not one of the best beers in the world, it is, nonetheless, one of the better lagers and imminently sessionable. Found 24 of them on sale for $20 at Total Wine in Atlanta and could not say no."

"I gave this another shot. Was really good. Originally i thought this was bad. But since my tastes have changed from light to stronger and different styles, this is good. Some say its skunked, havent really come across that, since i buy mine from a website and its fresh. when buying from a store, you never know how long it sits on the shelf. when buying from a website you can get it fresh. Fresh heineken is some of the best beer i've had. First time i bought it from a store. Good quality when fresh."

"WAY back in the day there was a time when the big stadiums didn't have anything except bud, bud light, miller, coors or heiny. Back in those days I was willing to pay nearly anything for a beer with some flavor, and heiny was a lifesaver. Today I can't say I really think heiny is at the top of the eschelon of beers, but I also can't say it's changed much. So the rating I give it here is what it gets, and I'm unapologetic for it. Thanks heiny."

"Heineken Lager Beer brewed by Heineken Nederland B.V. with an ABV of 5.0% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a white head. The smell of this brew is skunky with some grains. I will have to say this it is a lot smoother than most brews that come out of a green bottle. The mouthfeel is nice at the end. Heineken Lager goes down smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5. I don't believe I will be getting this brew again."

"Overall: It's Heineken. You gotta take it for what it is- a cheap, mostly flavorless Euro Pale Lager in a green bottle that people buy because of advertising. The beer gives off an aura of sophistication due to the advertising, much like Stella, but I'll take a Stella over Heineken any day of the week."

"O - You know what you're getting with this one. It looks nice, but it is like the European version of our cheap adjuncts. Save the money and head for the bargain section and get something you used to drink in college, because the quality is the same, if not better, in many of those."

"Heineken is a pretty good beer. Im a bit of a beer nut. I like high gravity dark ales generally, but a relatively light lager like heineken is good for a sunny day at the beech for a refreshing thirst quencher. I like this beer and compare it to Tsing Tao in overall character. Im not a hop nut. I like a good balanced beer with floral notes (fuggles,wilamette hops etc). Heinekens noble hops is really its driving force. I wouldn't call Heine's the bees knees, but Its by my estimation better than most domestics. I like the skunkiness of heineken. This skunkiness makes heineken the perfect beer for any beer batter recipe. I make onion rings and breaded mushrooms with heineken based beer batter frequently. For you hop nuts, and other beer snobs complaining about Heineken, dont drink it... Stick to your hopslammer, and Belgian Triples, and your beer ego will not be compromised. I know you like to think you have an evolved palate, and your beer smugness is dually noted."

"Overall: The craft beer era seems destined to sink the popularity of beers like this. It's perfectly decent, but it's also not cheap, and there are much more adventurous beers out there at this price point. It's the beer your dad's annoying friend drank in the '80s to prove he wasn't on a High Life budget. In the modern era its only real selling point is that it's better than Stella."

"O-its a heineken..solid beer but nothing special, would rather have a lot of other beers over this"
"Good beer out of Holland. I've tried many Heineken's and they all pretty much taste the same. It is a clear yellow beer with an average size head. It can go great with any food. It has a simple taste that most people would surely enjoy during the summer time"

"Overall: Decent, the skunk flavor detracts from it overall--but otherwise a decent beer"
"Update:  When I originally reviewed this I poured it out of its green bottle.  I have since had it out of a can and it tastes and smells much better.  The skunkiness is less pronounced and the flavor is slightly sweeter and less sour.  I am not going to change the rating but its worth noting that this is one of the few beers that is better from a can IMO."

"overall consider these things. its not adjunct, it has noble hops, its the same price as A-B and Miller-Coors adjunct ""specialty"" beers. yes it is skunky. the green bottles need to be stored very dark. and most beer coolers have florescent lights everywhere, skunking this brew. my palate and taste has grown and i would have to say it is a OK beer. i don't drink it like i used to, but it does bring back old memories. Better than any adjunct brew, but not a solid noble hop brew."

"I really don't kno why this beer gets such bad reviews. I think we all know what it looks like, but the aroma is actually grassy, doughy and smells pretty good. The flavor follows with a funky kinda bitterness that u know your gonna get with this beer. Now that I have had several belgian pale ales and light belgian ales I can say this reminds me of a light belgian ale but a little more crisp. Pretty nice id drink this over any bmc beer. Plus there's no adjuncts and no gmo's. If it were slightly cheaper id buy it a lot more."

"I'd reviewed a couple of beers that I love, so I thought I'd review one I hated. It was probably thirty years ago that I had my first-- and last-- Heiniken. It was like carbonated vinegar. I probably got a bottle whose seal had been broken & whose contents had been contaminated. That's the only thing I can think of, because no company could stay in business selling carbonated vinegar, could they? It may well be that Heiniken is pretty decent by ordinary standards but so help me God, I've been afraid to try another since that fateful day."

Nothing extraordinary but wouldn't pass one one up if offered to me either. They keep raising the price for a six though which causes me to only take a brief glance at it in the case then pass it by. Drinking the can version seems to be betyter than the bottle. It is much smoother and easy on the palate. Enjoy!"

"This is a good beer. Heineken is a sweet, well balanced, mildly bitter, easy drinking lager. This is an all malt lager with no additives. Better than an AAL. Good quality. If you prefer hoppy ales then you might not like Heineken. If you appreciate lightly hopped lagers then you'll probably like Heineken. I find this to be an enjoyable beer for down here in the Arizona heat and sun. I could drink this as an everyday lager. A widely available, affordable beer of good quality."
"Heineken Lager pours a bright straw like yellow color with no head. There was an overly sweet aroma, with skunk notes. The taste was very pale, bland, incredibly sweet, and tasted the way a skunk smells. Over carbonated and fizzy, nasty flavors, gave me a stomach pains. Overall its not the worst beer in the world, but its close."

"Usually don't do short reviews, but I just wanted to say that this beer is by far better in this mini-keg format than it is from the bottle. It is comparable to pilsner urquell from a can (newly available and delicious)- but with not quite as deep of a maltiness, and certainly not as bitter as pilsner urquell. But still, quite delicious, and my mini-keg is working quite well. Bought it cold from the store, brought it home (gently), tapped it right away, first glass was a little foamy, other than that just fine!"

"Dreadful, dreadful product in all guises; tap, bottle, can, whatever. May have been good in the past but now suffers from mass produced chemical headache inducing awfulness with no redeeming features. Pale, gassy, industrial foam head, unnatural aroma, unpleasant taste/aftertaste. Trying to think of something positive to say about it and the only thing I can think of is that it is probably okay for extinguishing fires; sorry, but it really is p*ss poor and not a good advert for Dutch beer."

"Inoffensive and completely unexciting is the only way to truly describe this beer. There is nothing unpleasant about the colour, smell, flavour or mouthfeel, yet when all of the elements of the beer combine into the overall product, nothing stands out. There is not enough hops flavour, it somehow feels quite heavy for a lager, and the after taste I am still waiting for..."

"Well the reviews are all over the place for this one. For Years Heineken was a premium Beer in Texas since we had certain state laws protecting the local breweries and imports were limited to those distributors that had paid their dues to the State Legislature. Heineken wil continue to have that prestige in Texas. I have not had one in a long time but I bought one today and I still like it."
"Poured from the iconic green bottle. A pale straw color that fizzes and pops with too much carbonation. This classic Euro lager is quite variable depending on age and storage conditions, but at its best yields a doughy sweet carmelized or ""cooked"" aroma with some musty grape notes and hop spice that round things out a bit. Tastes much the same, with a cooked DMS flavor, some tannic grape skins, some hop bitterness in the chalky dry finish. The classic skunk although this can vary from mellow to rank. A metallic ting and rubber flavors show up if you pay close attention (a reason not to pay close attention). Heineken is an OK beer for what you get, a mass-produced industrial product with some historical cachet. Do not pay exorbitant sums for large quantities of this. Drinkable in quantity when you do not feel like analyzing a beer to death."

"All i can really say about Heineken is that it's basically inoffensive. It's a pale lager whose obvious comparison would be to Budweiser. It has some decent wheat flavor, the refreshing feel of a lager, and that's it. It's a high quality pale lager. The problem is high quality or not, pale lagers are almost always far too bland for my taste, and Heineken is not an exception."

"I confess, I'm drinking an Aventinus wheat dopplebock right now, which I never had before, and man what a beer. Its been sitting there getting warm while I wrote this, and it actually tastes better the warmer it gets! And no, I'm not putting Heineken quite in that category. But the kids of today need to thank their lucky stars you can walk into any gas station in the country selling beer, and get a six of Heineken. The primary ingredients of beer are hops barley yeast and water, and you can work alchemy with those ingredients without adding chocolate flavoring or what have you."

A true luxury beer that is available everywhere which is the other great thing about it."

"Drank straight from the bottle, so little to review in appearance. I'd assume it pours like any lager, clear yellow, thin head, goes away quickly. Scent was mostly grassy hops and sweet crystal malt. Not bad, but not amazing. Surprisingly there was no skunk, despite this coming from a green glass bottle. Flavor was mostly sweet crystal malt, maybe some adjunct sweetness, and some grainy flavors. There was slight hit of grassy hops at the end, but no where near what I want in a lager. Mouthfeel was light bodied, which is good, but with a high, aggressive carbonation that I didn't care for too much. Overall it's a stunningly average beer. It's better than many American macro-lagers, but it lacks the flavor and bitterness that defines a truly good European pilsner or lager."

"Beer is a funny thing,or should I say ""Personal Taste in Beer is a funny thing""~I Suppose Beer is just like anything else,what I myself find top notch and stellar,the next guy may find to be pure crap,guess that is what makes the world go round eh? and what a boring place this would be if we all liked the same tastes,smells,flavors ..and so on & so forth,..However it really blows my mind that ""Heineken"" is sooo poorly rated here on this site, ""Heineken"" a Poor Beer?..seriously? now I totaly understand that Heineken is far from a world class beer,and there are much better beers out there,I am sorry,but by no stretch of the Imagination is Heineken a ""Poor Beer""..it is a smooth,easy drinking,Crisp Lager,and I pretty much suspect a lot of the ""Poor"" reviews are from ""Hop Heads"" and IPA Fanboys that bash every Beer with an IBU less then 80,I just find it almost impossible to believe that the average beer drinker[guys like me] would cringe in horror @ the thought of having to consume an Ice cold Heineken,utter Bulls*&t IMHO,to be fair,I drink a lot of Heineken & perhaps am a bit biased,but I Honestly enjoy it a gr8 deal,and think it is a wonderful Mass produced Macro Lager Beer~and how the ""Beer Snobs"" LOVE to bash ALL Macro Beers,but I myself personaly feel that ""Macro Brewed Beer"" has it's place in the wonderful world of beer,and I am not the least bit ashamed to say that,I drink ALL kinds of beer,from small batches of special seasonal beers from Micro breweries,to Chocolate stouts & Porters,Wheat ales,IPA's,APA's,Scottish ales,English Ales,and a Ton of others,and YES! I like some ""Macro Brewed Beer"" also,and to me, ""Heineken"" is a glowing example of just how damn good a ""Macro brewed Beer"" can actually be~Cheers."

"I think just like most people Heineken was one of the first imports I have ever had. I have drank it in bottles, cask, and can. No matter which one I drink it from there seems to be no consistency. It really is hit and miss with me cask in Amsterdam was my favorite. I just got back from a week in Holland, I am Grolsch and Heinekened out. It usually has an alright pale gold body with decent white head and lace. It has a thin body and is usually over carbonated. The taste is where it varies the most. Sometimes it is super crisp and other times there is nothing to it. It is usually grassy with some bite at the end."

"This beer shows little character and is high on carbonation. I avoid this beer in my snobbery nowadays, but if given the option, I would try it in favour of most other macros.

"O - This is very low on my 'to drink' list. The taste is very grainy, not something I like and the carbonation is far too much. For some reason or another this beer causes stomach pains probably from the harsh level of carbonation. Even given a limited choice at a party, I would take almost anything over this."

"Ok so we all realize this is an average brew at best. Ok average might be a bit generous. This is Europe's ""Budweiser"". They win this time. So I guess that I don't hate this beer. I mean compared to American big brew beer this kicks their ass and stands over them and tells them how bad they suck."
""
""
""
"It's a lot better in England and Ireland. This is probably due to the decreased shipping distance, which would limit the skunky taste. I've had it in America and hated it: the smell and taste were very skunky. However, when I was in England and Ireland, it tasted exponentially better."

"The best thing going for Heineken is its advertising campaign. Contrary to popular belief, the ""skunky"" smell and taste are not unintentional, but the adjunct flavors certainly don't make this the elite European beer that it claims to be. This lacks complexity even when compared with average European pale lagers. Flavors of dry hops, yeast, bread (?) and sulfur. It just never tastes fresh. One thing I will say is that if you are opposed to the skunky scent, you can avoid this to some degree by choosing the beer on draft or in a can as opposed to the green bottle."

"The aftertaste kills me. That WEIRD bitterness ruins this. It almost tastes like a chemical. Has to be my least favorite adjunct lager -- definitely one you want to pound and be done with, because it certainly doesn't taste good... maybe after a buzz I wouldn't notice the aftertaste, but sober? Yikes. No thanks. Better off having yourself a Budweiser -- it'd be cheaper, and be less offensive... this wouldn't be awful if it didn't taste metallic."

"O: I really do like this beer as I have some good experience with a lot of beers (adjunct and non-adjunct) and I consider this beer pretty exceptional! For a mass market Lager, the brewing company has not resorted to adjuncts and it's definitely showing that they know how to please consumers. But more can be done with adding a little more Hop profile do give the beer some more taste as well as some more defined malts to give the beer a little more flavor."

"I like Heineken's beers. They are so Euro and give me nostalgia. This one is good in the sense that it's drinkable and great for any occasion. I enjoy the lager but sometimes I prefer an ale. Luckily, tonight I'm all lager and love this one. I'm curious to see what quality their other brews are."

"This was my dad's beer, along with Samuel Adams so I grew up drinking this, he also bought me and my brother a 24 oz each for doing some yard work so the beer is still fresh in my mind, appearance is wonderful, and brings back great memories of siting out watching the beach with my Fiance and my friends, I dont know why but the green bottle just looks so, beautiful on the beach, The appearance has the looks of a fine pilsner, the smell varies, but last time I had it It smelled delicious, with alot of hops, almost tree like, the taste is the best part of it though, it taste like God giving you a kiss, they use alot of hops in making it so if your like me and you love that grassy taste you will love Heineken, just the right amount of bitterness, almost spicy, Mouth-feel is pretty good too, overall this is my Favorite beer, If I was a richer man I would drink this everyday, absolutely love it, and I believe it to be the best beer outside of heaven."

"Out of the bottle it pours a beautiful golden yellow - I truly like that shade of what I call ""beer-yellow."" The smell is your typical lager - mostly hops and barely - although at times I would say there is distant citrus smell. Taste is above average - not much, not spectacular, but better than most other lagers. Mouthfeel is close to perfect - just the right amount of carbonation with no aftertaste or stickiness. Overall, it's better than most lagers I've had, not the best, and I'm always happy to pick one up and think of my dad..."

"After years of not trying this beer, I was amazed by how awful it actually is. It might be decent on-tap, but the green bottle took away any hope of a pleasurable drinking experience. This is truly one of the worst beers I have ever consumed."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass, the beer is a pale, yellow gold coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy white coating on the surface. Aromas of toasted grains, some floral highlights, and a touch of skunky weed. Seriously, there is a touch of cannibus in the aromas. Flavors are fairly watered down, with a toastiness for the backbone and some tangy, sweet overtones. Floral highlights, with some spicing of oregano and peppermint. Very light bodied, with a minimal aftertaste. Toasty flavors linger on the palate, with a skunkiness that is hard to shake. Watery, clean finish. This one really doesn't do a whole lot for the palate. It's a bit awkward on the flavors, limp on the body, and not overly refreshing at all."

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe Chalice. Golden colour, clear, medium head that didn't hang around long. Aroma was fairly faint malt, detected more hop content towards the end. Tasted a slight hoppy bitterness that was balanced out by a malty sweetness, had hints of wheat and minimal yeast. Finish was slighty sour dough like. Texture was smooth but had an initial coarse edge from the carbonation although this faded. Slightly thick body. Overall this is better than quite a few Euro Pale Lagers out there. Not that interesting but well made and not offensive in any way."

"O- This is my first sampling of Heineken EVER. That being said, it won't be my last. The beer seems to have more complexity than your typical macro swill. I won't try it in a green bottle: skunkiness isn't my thing. Give me a can of this and I will say "" thank you"" and appreciate the fact that it isn't BMC."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The skunky nature of the aroma detracts from this beer, but overall it's not that bad compared to other beers in the style, particularly since the hop bitterness helps to mask this and the flavors of adjunct malts."

"O: A decent mass-produced lager. Pretty average in most respects. Better than American mass-produced stuff. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it, but if given the opportunity, it is easy to down several of these in a sitting. Which is pretty much what I expect from lagers, anyway."

"It's funny. Growing up I used to think this was the creme de la creme of beers. Have tried it both from the bottle and from the can, and even if you manage to find one that hasn't been skunked, there's nothing to write home about beyond grain and an off-putting aftertaste. I wouldn't turn one down if offered one, but I definitely wouldn't seek it out."

"Two Words. European Budweiser. Heineken is what it is; a decent Euroswill. Prefer it over American Macrolagers yet it is way overpriced in my opinion. I do have the privilege of saying I had it on tap in Amsterdam (@ Amsterdam International) but when choosing a lager I would rather go for BMC for the price. The bottom line is you can only expect so much from a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pint can poured into a pilsener glass. Golden brown lager with a thin, bubbly head. Aromas of berries and grain. Tastes of sweet, tart berry and dry oats. One of the better macro lagers out there, in my opinion, provided it's been stored in a container that protects it from the light."

"Overall - Refreshing, simple beer that's easy to serve at a house party, at a tailgate, or a BBQ. However, it's uninteresting, unremarkable, and not worth seeking out..."
""
"Bleh, I'm not a fan of this one at all. Hated this when I first tried it, long ago. Tried it again thinking maybe I was just inexperienced earlier - still don't care for it."
"O - Most seem to hate this a lot more than I do, but it shines the colder it is and is easy to drink. But if you want the real thing go with Hofbrau, Spaten, or others like them."

"Heineken was always one of my favorite beers from the very first time I drank one. Heineken is a very skunky green bottled beer with a slight bite, finishing slightly bitter when swallowed. It's a bit of a full beer, meaning some people might not choose to drink a six pack of it, but might have one or two with a meal. Heineken is a trendy beer with good marketing, but that's not why I consider it a top ten for life. I consider it a great beer because I love the taste and texture, slightly skunky, with a bit, into a smooth bitter finish. For me, it's a good anytime, anywhere kind of beer, every now and then I may opt for something a little ""lighter"" but not very often."

"Heineken’s taste is similar to the smell. Some corn, some malt and good alcohol kick for a 5%. Someone referred to the sweetness as “manufactured sweetness” and I thought it was interestingly put. I don’t know how to explain it but I agree. It’s got the same old metallic, bland, cooked vegetable feel as other inexpensive beers and for that, I have to say that Heineken is not worth your money. You can get the same thing for a couple of bucks less on a case of 12."

"Pours a clear light orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is mainly of malt and grain aromas. Taste is much the same with a sweet finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer but it's much better on tap than in any bottles I have had in the past."
"O: I'm lucky enough to live in California, where all but the shittiest bars carry SNPA. However, I don't hate this. I used to. But now I recognize it for what it is. As one reviewer said, a great ballpark beer."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Nothing special about this beer IMO. I have friends who claim this is the best, though I know now that they know nothing about beer. It's got this kick to it like it was mixed with some cheap vodka. Definitely not a beer I would try again soon. This beer is way overhyped."

"Great interpretation of a Lager, Heineken is always a safe choice when you don't know what to drink. It is a strong Lager with very strong flavor and pretty decent alcohol content. It is golden yellow, creates minimal head when poured into a glass. It has a very strong taste with many hops, it is bitter and you might put a bad beer face if you are not used to strong Lagers. Overall a very good beer."

"THE TASTE- kind of follows the smell as well. Pretty strong pong beer. Actually perfect for pong. Taste stays with you for a minute. This beer in particular has a corn taste with a different little hint of wheat or barley, I'm not sure.. but mix that with some bud light and that's what you got. Like I said, a stronger, heavier, easy to down ballgame beer. Buy this if you're looking for a quick buzz or going to a game."

"One of those beers that you can unfortunately find almost anywhere you go. Pours a clear pale yellow color with an average head. I was pretty fierce in pouring this into the glass to actually get a head. Smells like stale wheat with some citrus. Taste is cheap, thin and grassy. Basically what I call beer flavored water. A simple and overpriced beer that mass advertises in the Asian markets to gain popularity. Why anyone would buy this more than once is beyond me. Thankfully I got my 12pk free after a rebate."

"O - I've tried my best to leave any beer snobbery out of this, I have to say that I enjoy chugging down this beer in social sessions, drinkability is its best quality, but to really break it down its generally an average lager"
"Well, it aims pretty low and hits the target. As macro lagers go this isn't actually too bad; it's well-balanced and clean. Quenches a thirst. But it's boring - where's the excitement? Oh well, nevermind. Worth trying (once)."
""
"Final Thoughts: This beer wasn't as bad as I expected. In fact, it sort of went way above my expectations. However, I would not seek this beer out in the future. I'm not sure why it is so popular and world renowned (then again why are any macro-lagers so popular?) but it's not the worst beer I've tasted."
"While I normally really like Euro lagers, I have to make an exception for this one. Really it is an unbalanced mess. Not something I will have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Simply reviewing this as an Adjunct Lager, I would say its not a great beer, but its not the worst either. Avoid the green bottle and the experience should be a little better. A good beer for parties, backyard BBQ, or a yard work refreshment."
""
""
""
""

"Revisited this beer with the canned version. This is a completely different beer than I remember. I thought that I had also read that they had dropped any adjuncts that may have been in the recipe. Maybe it's just the can. I don't know. This beer is very refreshing. Very Malty. Pours the same dark straw color that you would expect from a Euro-Lager. A bit of bitter hops. Since I have tried this in the can, I had also stopped by at a local pub and have had this on tap. This beer is actually a decent beer. It is not Paulaner or Spaten, but for the price it's pretty good and not much more than American swill."

"A skunky ass smell from the moment the cap is popped off leading to a fairly enjoyable taste however somewhat bitter. Had it at a party for my 22nd birthday. I've tried other German beers in the past with no particular avail to my taste buds but this is definitely a more similar to what I am used to drinking. Only real complaint is that this beer is wayyy too pricy. It just doesn't bring enough to the table for me to constantly be shelling out $28 for an 18 pack. The mouthfeel was pretty bitter, Though oddly enjoyable. The appearance was like most other beers around here, just with MUCH less carbonation and a darker color. Overall a very clean, Enjoyable Lager, Which is even better out of a keg"

"Pours pale yellow with a big white head that goes away rather quickly. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is of typical european macro brew and a bit of skunk. Taste is of corn and a bitter finish that lasts a bit too long on the palate. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. Overall not a good beer and a typical of a macrobrew."

"Ov: Heineken is a step up from the average adjunct lager, but it still is a generic beer. At this price point, you can easily find a better beer or accept the inexpensive BMC lagers willing to get you just as drunk without breaking your wallet. Hollandia is extremely similar and much more affordable but there are always beers light years ahead of this one."

"Light bodied with good carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as any of the style. The body is easy-drinking, crisp, and washes over the tongue well. The carbonation is a little fizzy, which is to be expected for the style, but does not seem to detract from the beer at all. A nice, sharp finish ends each sip (or gulp) nicely and allows the drinker to return to the beer time and time again."

"Large can in Lebanon. Was ice cold when taken out of the fridge that was set at -3 degrees Celsius. Gave it 5 mins. Sounded like a was opening a pepsi can. Was extremely refreshing, taste was a bit weak, and carbonated just as much as a coke would be."
"Overall: Being a Euro Pale Lager, which is basically the European version of an American Adjunct Lager, it’s not so bad. Just do NOT drink it from a bottle unless you like the flavor of skunk. It reigns supreme in a can, hands down."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is the norm at all restaurants and bars. It is played out and overrated. The taste of this beer is bitter and it gives you a bad aftertaste. This beer shows up at every place I go to and I don't understand why people think it's such a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. pours a clear straw color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells like sweet grains with not much hops. Tastes of sweet grain with a little bit of a funky aftertaste which is not surprising of a beer that is in a green bottle. Goes down smooth and definitely can be one that can be drank all night. Overall, a very average beer, but better than some adjunct lagers."

"Really not a bad beer at all, for me Heineken is the quintessential lager, and an excellent representation of the pale lager style. There's a good amount of taste going here that I would assume comes from an all grain mash. Prefereable to the American adjunct style for sure. If this stuff sold at regular price for less than a buck a can/bottle then it would make an excellent fridge stocker."

"Overall: If only more breweries embraced this style of packaging. The beer is fresher, there is less packaging involved (perhaps an issue environmentally) and it presents their product in the best light possible. I have bought 3 kegs of this, and they have all been the same. Highly recommended, but like me, you may find that 5 litres is not enough! (a bit like V8s really...)"

"Not a lot of flavor with this one. Would pass"
""
"This beer poured out as a pale yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. There is basically no lacing on this at all or retention. The smell of the beer has the standard lager yeast aromas and fresh cut grass notes on the nose. The taste of the beer to me is decent, I don't find that this brew is too overpowering with the lager flavors of grass and such. There is a little bit of a metallic flavor to it from time to time but I somehow manage to look past that when I drink it. The mouthfeel is light but it does feel heavy once you drink a few of them in a row. Overall when it comes down to it... If I'm stuck choosing between several American Adjunct Lagers or this one, I'll take thsi one every time. I don't mind this beer at all."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, the reason why I considered Heineken lager as a step above the rest of the adjunct lagers is that this one has a better amount of hops and less taste like pisswater. Heineken lager has character and actual taste. I like it and drink it every so often. If you like the lower pisswater adjunct lagers, give this one a try as its a step above and is better I promise. Its not my favorite though and could have more character and boldness that I like which is why I don't rate it higher."

"this beer is really really bad in american form. the green bottles are skunked 9 times out of 10, and its as boring as can be on tap. the keg cans save it a litttle bit, but theyre only good if your already shitfaced. pours a quickly flat yellow color with a disappearing head. smells like dead beer (most of the time). tastes like watered down malt juice with a metallic tinge, and a bitter aftertaste. it must just be poorly handled, because ive heard its excellent at the source. ill update this when i get there and try it, but for now i will never understand why this beer is at every bar in the world and thought to be a classy brew by the corn lager masses"

"Clean yellow with a fluffy, pure-white head. Pretty high visible carbonation and some drippy lacing. Sweet, somewhat spicy noble hop aroma along with cereal grain and pale floral notes. Sweet, crisp pale lager flavor with some grassiness. Surprisingly not bad, though the sweetness wears on the palate a bit. Thin, slick body. Really not too bad, though the price is too high for me to bother and the green bottles are an obvious turn off."

"O - If you're into the typical adjunct lager this is for you. Personally, not a big fan. Only drinking this because its free."
"Overall: Only advantage to this one is that it's almost like drinking water. But then, i'd rather drink water."
"Warning: Do not let warm, will taste like piss"
"Overall, another ho-hum euro lager"
"good ice breaker for the macro drinker, but once they find out they can buy better local beer for the same price it will be shelved."
"Overall: Pretty much what you expect from a Euro pale lager. Sweet and watery. Not bad, but pretty bland."
"Life is too short to have any more of these, had enough as a kid."
"I only drank this because it was free at a recent bar-b-Que and did not have ""lite"" on the label."
"Pours brassy and golden, with evident carbonation, and a soft mat of white frothy micro-bubbles atop. Heinken is tinny and skunky by nature; this can... is only slightly less so. It is actually not very skunky, but metallic flavors are certainly to be found. There is some residual sweetness, and alcohol is readily discernible. This stuff tastes very similar to Colt 45, truth be told. Not a huge fan of the beer in any regard, but the can is definitely better than the green bottle."
"O- I'm not above crushing a few of these, but this is not a good beer."
"This would still never be my first choice but I think mass market distribution is a bigger enemy to this beer's flavor than the original recipe."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: The drinkability of this beer is just fine but the flavors don’t challenge of excite. My overall impression is of a clean fresh crisp well made beer that is made for those who don’t want strong flavors in their beer."
"I won't go into what I taste much further than to say that it has a bold flavor and smell that you can either appreciate and enjoy, or not."
"It's a decent beer, plus it costs a few dollars less than Stella in most places I've been."
"Reviewed out of the bottle. Classic Euro lager. Straw yellow with moderate carbonation and a fizzy head. Has the 'skunk' nose so prevalent with the style. Taste is mildly bitter with some hops and grain coming through. Also a hint of sweetness. I prefer the canned version or tap as it always tastes fresher. A staple beer and one pretty much everyone should try. On tap, it's a nice beer to have a few of."
"The most marketed foreign beer I can think of, moderate taste and price. if you're a Heine guy, you're Heine guy, all there is to it."
"O- Yes, this review is quite enthusiastic. BUT that does not mean for a second that this is a perfect beer. It has rather discernible flaws. However, I really don't think this deserves the utter contempt it gets from snobs. Yes, we all understand that there are much, much better beers out there, but for what you are drinking, it's not half bad."
"Over-all I cant hate this beer too much, being the #1 best selling beer in the world, and for its neutral, non-offensive qualities. Good for anyone who wants to ""just have a beer."" Defiantly a step up from any of ""the big 3"" here in America."
"This a tasty, full-flavored brew that's light on the stomach. You could drink this all day."
"Taste is above average compared to other light beer and cheap beers; corn and grains are felt just like any other pale lager beer but nothing great. A bit of a grassy aftertaste is left along with medium carbonation."
"Not for me really. I'm not a fan of the burnt flavor in the finish or the odd graininess."
"Poured this pale lager into a pint glass from a bottle. Poured a clear straw color. Produced a thin head with pour head retention. Only a small amount of lacing was left behind on the glass. The Aroma of this beer is not pleasant...can someone say skunk? The taste of this Euro Lager i light in body, smooth, some grain, slight hop and broccoli. Finishes dry. Overall, not my cup of tea. If I wanted something similar i would pick up a German style Pilsner, Spaten or Hoffbrau."
"D - I seem to remember enjoying Heineken in the past, but this certainly didn't help me remember why. Humdrum lager."
"O: Bad stuff. I don't know how anyone would consider this to be an ""upgrade"" over, say, Bud or Coors. I don't think I've ever had a Heineken that wasn't skunked; at least a cold, fresh BMC in cans doesn't reek of skunk. Drain pour."
"Overall - I would bet if they switched to a brown bottle and eliminated the skunkiness this would be a decent bottled beer from Holland. Otherwise its just ok and somewhat boring."
"A Chameleon. Careful"
"The esteem of this beer baffles me. I'd take most other Euro Pale Lagers over this, and I'd never pay full price for it."
"T: It's pretty easy to drink, but not especially good. Some lemon and slightly bready malts, a touch of grassy hops and that's about it. I happened to be very lucky on this bottle and got un-skunked beer. Cha ching!"
"Pours a transluscent light amber color with an inch of quickly fading white head. Minimal bubbly lacing noted. Aroma is faint, yeasty, slighty grassy. Mouthfeel is light, fairly carbonated. Taste is light. It is yeasty, grassy, and very watered down tasting. Overall, eh."
"Overall: A decent chugging beer, and good for a buzz. get it in a can to avoid skunkiness."
"O: Not bad, actually liked the can since it had a bit of a texture to it as a grip. Would be fine with cans of this once in a while if it wasn't so highly priced. Can get much better options for only a little bit more money."
"During my semester in Madrid, this and Guiness were pretty much it at all of the main bars. They were always highlighted on signs and menus for 5 euros a pint. Instead of struggling to find something different, I just went with it everytime. It's fine if you are just trying to get your buzz on but it's really not all that enjoyable. I can't say I would ever purchase it in the stores. It looks like any other common beer out there and doesn't really have a uniqe taste. I think the average person considers this some special high quality beer but it really does not taste like one. I'd take a budweiser over this any day."
"O: It's pretty good out of the can. A nice pale lager."
"O: Pretty Awful in my opinion. The green bottle does not help the beer, other than for marketing, perhaps a can might be better, but I doubt it. Where's the beer?"
"PS I didn't know that your beer Karma could go down? Maybe I'm just not drinking enough?"
"So, that does it for my Canadian tour. While nothing really stuck out to me as beer gold, I can honestly say that I’m happy with my choices of brew for the weekend. At the very least, it makes me appreciate the great craft we have just miles across the border in America!"
"D- Without the skunk this would be a nice beer, it feels good in the mouth and smells and looks like most lagers, but that skunk flavor is a killer."
"Feels cold, some carbonation. Bad aftertaste"
"This used to be my go to beer when traveling thru Dakar and Kampala in Africa as well the numerous places is S.E.Asia. This was always good for a few and still is."
"I wouldn't say that this is standout beer, but it worked well on a 95 degree day."
"Poured a 2"" white soap suds head. Clear straw yellow in color. Smells just a little skunked but not enough to turn off, and theres a little grassy smell too. Taste is a mild sweet corn. This is a big step up from their light beer though not dramatically different or better from American BMC beers. Just an average."
"O: this happens to be my favorite beer in my least favorite category; that being macro lagers. Still, not the best but drinkable when only weaker options are available."
"O - Not the best from the bottle due to the skunkness, it tastes much better from the can or the mini-keg."
"Slightly above average EPL for one of the most famous beer brand."
"M/O. The mouthfeel is a crisp clean smooth easy to drink feel that is made for the masses to drink. Overall I was not impressed with this beer. After hearing how great this beer is all I can say is I'll stick with Stella for a Euro pale lager that is massed produced."
"Drinkability: Honestly, I was expecting this beer to be fairly abysmal, but it's very easy to knock back. It's a lot better than some of the other big brewery lagers I've had."
"D: Mass made made for the masses."
"Cheers!"
"o - Overall this is not a good beer at all. Tastes and smells like corn and worse than most american adjunct lagers.This is one of my least favorite beers; I'd take a Bud or Coors product over it."
"O - While not overly impressive, Heineken is an excellent lager to enjoy with friends. It is prone to skunkiness, so take care where and when you buy it. Best if served on tap."
"Had a can of this on a recent flight. The only even slightly drinkable option, so what the heck- I didn't feel like any hard liquor, although that's usually the way to go on a flight. The one good thing I can say about this is that it's not skunked in the can. One thing I always hated about Heineken was the green glass bottle- that always increased the risk of a skunky beer, and I've had many a skunky Heineken back in the day. So this is a huge improvement in that respect. As good as the can is, it's only as good as the beer that's in it. Unfortunately, that beer is Heineken. Pours golden with a thin white head. Smells relatively clean, with earthy bitter hops, and notes of lager yeast. Of all the bmc type beers out there, I always did think Heineken was one of the hoppiest, and kudos for that. Tastes grainy with some more bitter earthy hop notes and a noticeable lager yeast twang. Tastes somewhat creamy with a crisp finish. It is what it is, but it's better than it was."
"drinkability: prime example of typical European-style lager, nothing damning nor spectacular, decent abv and drinkable in quantity."
"O- No thanks rather boring."
"Overall another average beer all the way around. It definitely seems strange that this among other ""average"" beers, are so widely popular. C'est la vie...avoid this one if possible. If not, it will quench your thirst, barely."
"Final Grade: 2.95, a forgettable C."
"O:This beer is a classic example of a Euro Lager. Nothing outstanding but it has great drinkability, color and aroma. It only falls short with a bland taste"
"D - I had a can so at least it didn't smell skunked, but it still doesn't improve the flavor. I have never been a fan."
"M- A bit watery, but nothing to ruin the beer."
"Dr: This beer is sort of the Ottoman Empire of Europe; it's the sick man's beer. Avoid unless you're on a student budget."
"I had a Bavik a few days before, and I must say this is not even comparable. Skunky skunk skunked. As Singaporeans would like to put it ""cannot-lah""!"
"Pours clear, pale, straw color with a thin, receding head. Not much in the aroma, stale and vaguely grainy. Bland taste, somewhat reminiscent of what is known as a beer, with light grains and barely noticeable hops. Very light and watery, and a bitter aftertaste. To be avoided."
"*2/21/13 Note to self, $2 more for a 12 pack of Spaten over a Heineken sale is worth the added expense."
"I like the way Heineken tastes via the big oil cans. The skunk funk of the green bottle has gone and here is a nice drinkable beer. Beware of people who tell you this is no good just because there are better beers available. This is a classic that has a unique taste almost like corn?"
"No skunky elements from the can serving, unlike the green bottle. Still a mediocre beer and probably not worth the calories."
"Smells like metal and cheap malts. That's it. The taste is pretty good. It's got exactly the right amount of hops. So, that's always nice. Not too piney of a hop characteristic either. Still got that cheap, bad malt taste. It's refreshing, but I've had better. The malt characteristic is just not my thing. It kind of reminds me of the flavour of corona, which I'm not a fan of either. So, I wouldn't consider this worth the price."
"Has a very smooth pour to it, which I can appreciate. It pours a one finger creamy looking head, kinda surprised at how creamy it looks, I'm sure it will be gone soon, but still. Pretty large amount of carbonation coming up through what I would call a barely darker than piss yellow color. The beer is completely transparent, the head is now gone, but it looks like I'm getting pretty good lacing out of this beer. Overall it looks like an adjunct lager, but it's got some nice areas. The smell is very faint, what I can pick up is some sweet malt, which is nice, not a bad smell for adjunct lagers, usually I get a more sour malt smell. Underneath that there is a small note of hops in there. I have to say the smell isn't horrible, for sure an adjunct lager, but not a bad smell. The taste is very smooth, it goes down pretty easy with little interruptions. This unfortunately means that there isn't too much flavor, but I was expecting that. The flavors I can detect are much like the smell, small amounts of sweet malt, and underneath that a small amount of hops, the rest is all water. I mean the beer is a very weak beer, super light, super watery, but the flavors that are there aren't bad at all, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. I also appreciate that the smell and the taste are exactly the same. Overall not a bad taste, unbelievably weak, and barely any taste in here, but where it is, it isn't bad. Mouthfeel is decent, bigger than I would expect, and not as much carbonation as in some adjunct beers. The drinkability is exceptional, this beer just goes down like it's nothing. Overall not a bad beer, for sure one of the better adjunct lagers out there, bottom line - there is nothing really that wrong with this beer at all, other than the fact that it's ridiculously light."
"Minimal carb and thin watery body. Easy to smash down."
"I was at a bar where this was the ""best"" beer being served when I had this. When it's the best option you've got, it's fine. But I have no idea why anyone would buy this beer when there are so many other great options around. Smells kinda skunky but has no real discernable taste whatsoever. I cringe when I hear people say, ""Oh, heineken! Now that's a good beer!"""
"Overall? Why bother, I mean yeah it's refreshing when ice cold and I could pound a case in an evening if I felt like it but I feel like a fancy Lawnmower could do the same job with more taste. I just don't really see the point in buying it when I can drink a better beer..."
"Overall: one of the worst adjunct lagers you can find. The skunk is quite pronounced and well, I'd prefer a Bud over this. Avoid. Cheers!"
"Heineken Nederland B.V. 2011 Heineken Draft. 12 oz. Draft @ Fremont, Seattle Hop Scotch Beer & Scotch Festival on 4/01/2011. 5.00% ABV. 25 IBU's? Thin white light lace head. Clear bright very thin gold color. Crisp Saazish hop pilsner front. CO2 zesty sligtly herbal pils pale lager body. Refreshing light herbal hop adjunct hint end. (3.75 / 5.0)"
"O: European macrobreweries are better than American macrobreweries."
"Buy some marketing, buy Heineken. Ha, wow, value is the worst thing about this beer, and for that it gets a 1 overall."
"Taste is thin, watery -- almost like a rice lager. Rather bland and inoffensive. Or offensive in the lack of body or character (or flavor). Very very boring and lacking. Will not return to these unless desperate..."
"Overall... Very average macro brew. I'm not crazy about it, and it's way overpriced."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/"
"Cheers! (but, not to Heineken)"
"Overall: You can do a lot worse when it comes to fizzy yellow beers, but there's not much to inspire any passion."
"O: about what I expected for something that costs so little for an import; I see a lot of college girls drinking it at parties, which pretty much sums up the quality of this brew"
"O: I don't understand how people pay an extra $3/6pk for this garbage over bud; it's essentially the same stuff. Definitely not worth importing. If you want a taste of Amsterdam, give Amstel a try, as it is vastly superior."
"O: Not a beer I would willingly purchase, but does the job when at a wedding. It can be refreshing on a hot day."
"D - It was easy to drink, but I do not think I would get again. Although it did pair great with the food I had to eat."
"O: Adjuncty, yes, but flavorful, crisp, and refreshing."
"D- Not even that much drinkable given it's simple character and low ABV. Nicely refreshing but i'd like a lager to feel at least smooth, this one does not"
"Next time i'm in Vegas, I'm getting one of these bad boys for old times sake."
"Overall grade: C- / C"
"D - I had a can so at least it didn't smell skunked, but it still doesn't improve the flavor. I have never been a fan."
"Poured a pale yellow with weak fizzy head that disapeared quickly. Nose was skunked and grain. Taseted horrible, total skunk flavour and weak grain lager. Watery mouthfeel. Mild drinkability If cold but I may end up drainpouring the rest of these. Never repurchase."
"Goes down nicely and it's easy to drink a few in a row."
"A clean and easy to drink beer, but offers nothing of interest really. It is q clean tasting beer though."
"A bit flat in whole dimension but easy to drink anyway. Not too bad for macro beer."
"Drinkability: You could drink this like water but why bother. Water, if your choice, is better alone. Beer, if your choice, can be had far better than this. I can not believe that in days gone by...I considered this top-shelf!"
"D-Most everyone has had a Heineken. Some love it, others hate it. It's a nice drinking session beer. I picked up a 12 pack on sale for $12. So at this price it's comparable to a local craft on sale. Also good for cooking with."
"Will re-review if I ever get another straight from the brewery."
"Too me its too bitter for just an ordinary beer. I have tried it on tap too and the same thing."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. Goes down almost like water and it's very refreshing, especially on hot days. Definitely not going to please you if you're looking for taste or complexity, and it's definitely not the best European lager out there, but it's widely available and relatively cheap (at costco) and it does its job."
"It's a real shame that they make beer this bad in the Netherlands/Europe. Then again, most people who drink it are probably from the US. I'd pick it up over BudMillerCoors, but that's about it."
"Drinkability: Not a terrible beer, but this is far from special. It is possibly a step above most American macros, but not by much. Even if it's better than American macros, there are still European macros to be had that are better."
"Like going to a chain fast food joint when traveling, you're pretty sure of what you'll be getting, and you won't be taken by surprise by either a wretched or wondrous experience, unless someone's left these green bottles out in the sun."
"D- This beer is drinkable. Not a large ABV makes this beer a sessionable one. The sweetness in it does kill it a little bit but it is not as bad as other adjunct lagers. It is what it is...nothing that I would seek out but then again not one that I wouldn't refuse if offered to me."
"Heineken is a ubiquitous beer, and while not novel, it's a good beer to have around. When I need a beer in a can, like camping trips, my standard is Heineken. On pour, it has a light bright color and decent head. The aroma is mild. For flavor, it has a perfect mix of light malt sweetness with an overly of bitterness. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Easy enough to drink, but not one I would seek out."
"Verdict: Unsurprisingly, Heineken is just another forgettable, bland, but somehow wildly popular Euro Pale Lager. It's preferable to a Bud/Miller/Coors, but not by much."
"Pale yellow color; unpleasantly sweet malty aroma with faint hop presence, luckily it´s even mild; mouthfeel is thin and watery; sweet malty flavor, even slight bitterness to my surprise, though unfortunately the hops are bit metallic and not fruity. It´s got surprisingly lot of taste for a mass-market product like it, but then again the taste is not very good. I only have it when there's no better alternative (e.g., at a wedding)."
"A lite and easy drinker, I have never been a fan,but with the can the skunked out light struck flavor is gone.Palatable brew but not great."
"Cheers..."
"Taste is very light and crisp. It's a bit malty with almost no hops, it's quite easy drinking and better than most BMC beers, but it's much better on tap."
"This one was pretty enjoyable. I've found Heineken's to be a bit hit or miss though. Had it on tap in Amsterdam last summer, now that was a great beer. The American formula just doesn't live up though."
"D: I don't know how people can get through the first couple bottles of this stuff, it seriously makes me want to regurgitate. My body isn't designed to drink cat-piss flavored carbonated alcohol water. I'm just a third of the way through the glass and I don't think I can stomach anymore. Drain pour here we go."
"Overall, I would rate this as an average, but good beer. Not my favorite, but it won't ruin my day if it's all that's available."
"This is tolerable, though i've not had enough other euro pales lately to compare."
"*note* I've been told by certified beer judges that the skunk taste and smell disappears when this beer is drank from can of keg. this may give the beer a better score."
"I had this on tap along with a Bud Light which was bought by a friend. This one definitely beats out a light beer. You can tell it had a bit more flavor and Bud Light made this beer seem not as watery. Have this beer on tap and you will be able to give it a better score. No green bottle no skunk at all. I got some grainy malt that was slightly sweet which by the way wasn't a bad malt taste at all with some sharp metallic like hops. That's pretty much this beer. It tastes so much better on tap and I'd pick this beer over any of the light beers any day. I don't really have much to say about these types of beers though they have no complexity, very straight forward."
"-Dotson"
"D - . Don't think I couldnt drink more than a 24oz of this stuff. Would only drink this if my options were terrible or if I was given some free at a party. :)"
"D-Very drinkable I could put away quite a few (That doesn't mean they're great though)"
"D: Run-of-the-mill cheap lager. Nothing special about it. Perhaps better than some, but certainly not very good. Probably taste a lot better ice cold, out of the bottle, while eating junk food."
"decent drinkability if its around at a cookout or a buddys house but not a huge winner that i would buy myself."
"Widely available, try it or don't."
"D- drinkability of this beer is very easy. I drink these now and again good summer beer."
"Not happy on that note."
"Drinkability: Heineken's Lager is not quite a go to beer anytime my selection is limited but it is a better mass produced lager than most on the market. For Heineken to make this brew a winner they would have to improve the head retention and the brews consistency/mouthfeel. Making the beer bottle conditioned and letting it age might do the trick."
"D - The flavors and smell seem artificial and cheap in this one. Don't think I couldnt drink more than a 24oz of this stuff. Would only drink this if my options were terrible or if I was given some free at a party."
"Clear and golden with a thin, whispy head that quickly disappears, leaving behind some frothy remnants of what once was. Nice aroma, slightly sweet and malty with some cooked asparagus making its way into the nostrils. Taste begins with a crisp, dry and bitter hoppiness, followed by a smooth and faintly sweet maltiness that lingers around after each sip. The bitterness of the hops in the brew also brings about some very faint citrus notes (lemons/oranges/limes) that accent the sweetness and hop presence nicely. Mouthfeel is nice, light, and dry and with just a tad bit too much carbonation. Another easy drinker, in my opinion. Again, not the best beer around, but it always seems to satisfy during any occasion-"
"I don't really give a Schlitz about Heineken, but it'll do in a pinch."
"Has a tasty, floral hoppiness to it. Very good mouthfeel. Nothing special to look at, but quite delicious."
"typical mass production beer, very light but drinkable, especially if there is no local brewery."
"That said--I don't hate it. I've stolen a few from my wife's side of the fridge. It's great on a hot day or good party. Just not a beer for nuanced reflection."
"Traded some leffe blonde for this... I instantly regret this decision."
"Poured from a 12oz keg-can: golden-yellow body with ~2finger head which dwindles to minimal lacing sitting on top of the body. Smells of faint sweet corn with traces of metal and alcohol. Tastes relatively ""skunky", sweet malt, somewhat banana-breadish and oily feeling culminating with a dry feel on the tongue. Overall, Heineken is an okay lager with no real merits which make me want to come back to it frequently. You will be able to find better beers in this style."
"crisp, thin-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. pretty drinkable in that it's non-offensive and goes down easily, though with so many more appealing option to be had, the question is, why would you bother?"
"Drinkability is there. It's very easy to down, and barely noticeable in all facets. With that said, I have a feeling the next time I set up my beer pong table I may be buying a case of Heinies. Then again, I probably won't."
"One of the most popular beers in the world for a reason. There is nothing great about this beer, but you also can not go wrong with it. You will run into this beer at any local grocer or gas station next to Budweiser and Coors, but that doesnt mean its terrible. Pretty much anyone on this site has probably had a Heineken at some point."
"D-Although not the greatest beer, it is still heavily drinkable and heavily available."
"drinks about as good as any macro. way too expensive and not worth it IMHO."
"The one attribute that I detect in Heineken is a delicious feeling and taste of clean water. Why would any drink beer just to taste water? Beats me. But whenever I drink Heineken, I think of ice cold artesian water and that just makes the beer completely worth buying. It's just something about the extreme crispiness of the carbonation when it's served cold that I've never found in any other beer I've ever drank. While this is by no stretch of the truth a ""good"" beer in my opinion, I would gladly replace all the Budweiser and Millercoors in the world with it."
"D: Quite, but since there's not much going on here, it's not an experience I particularly enjoy."
"D - It is what it is. A relatively drinkable beer. It's light and refreshing, especially on a hot day."
"I swear, every time I drink this brew is like drinking a rose garden, quite floral for a beer. Must be the hops. Always a good session and you get used to the brew quickly. Tops my favorites despite the grade. Given the choice between similar USA commercial brands and I'm up on the fence. It depends on the mood your in. So go ahead, enjoy - if the timing is right!!!"
"Pours clear golden with short lived white head. Aroma of hops with some light grassy notes. Taste is light malts and hops with some grassiness. Palate is light to med body, moderate carbonation. Finish was not very flavorful, taste was very bland. Overall did not enjoy this."
"Poured from nitro tap a golden yellow with a thick creamy white head that subsided rather quickly into a small few patches of white film. Smell is slight buiscuty malt and rice with very little to no hop smell present. Taste is very simple clean sweet malt taste no hop presence. Mouthfeel is thin and watery a very clean carbonated feel. Drinkability is high on this beer as there isn't much body hop presence or alchohol....not that I would want to buy and drink this simple lager often."
"D= Would drink if I was forced to. It's better than a miller lite but that's not saying much... I think people just order this to be cool."
"D-very drinkable imo some people don't like it because they think its too skunky, im in the age range where people rate beers on how fast they can drink them i always take my time and enjoy heineken though-one of my all time favorites when served right, i've been to some bars where they don't sell enough and it gets old and loses some of its edge but that's only sometimes"
"D: A relatively drinkable beer. Would be a lot better if I could get over the mouthfeel. All the same it's light and refreshing: basically exactly what it purports to me. Basically a slightly upscale, mass produced light lager."
"12 oz bottle. I had to order this beer, because the place was out of Brooklyn lager. Pours golden with a white, lacy, strange head. Aroma is of some grass, not much else. Taste is sweet grain, dough and some earthy hops. At least it was not disgusting."
"The beer goes down rather easy and has a bit of a spicy mouthfeel with nice carb. For a pale lager it is sub-par. But it is better than just about ANY adjunct."
"This thin body beer has a dull bitterness which is surprisingly not as skunky as it smells. The character of this beer is kind of like old, knock-off brand cereal, like if you left a store-brand version of cheerios in your pantry for several months and then decided to grind the box up and drink it. Horrible raw grain taste with a short, chemical aftertaste. Honestly, why make a beer that smells and tastes like this?!"
"Served in a pint glass. Pours is a clear golden color with plenty of visible carbonation and a white head. The nose is quite a bit of skunked hops plus some grain. The hops are definitely skunked and a bit grassy. Some very light grain. Skunky hops somehow fit this brew like they don't with any other; maybe I'm just used to it. Really not all the great. Crisp and light. I really don't like this and can't suffer through it any longer."
"D- Undrinkable drain pour. Thin, watery and skunky. Don't waste money on this. Only drink if you are already drunk and its offered free. Even then be prepared and approach with caution."
"Ok, poured out of a keg can and all I can say is, ""Heineken! F*ck that sh*t! Pabst Blue Ribbon!"" Anyways, it looks pretty damn boring, pale, straw yellow, but pretty effervescent. I actually do see some very slight lacing. I bought the can to avoid the skunk but I swear, did they make this one purposely skunky as well? I am either already drunk or I am smelling some off skunk smells, along with some hay, sweet corn adjuncts, and a tinge of some noble hops. Hmm, taste is somewhat dry, some euro pale maltyness is the middle, actually finished very clean...ok so I cheated. Heineken is saying they only use malted barley, I swear this beer does have a residual corniness to it. I don't know, something isn't quite right. I think this one is pasteurized, cause although it is slightly drinkable and ok, it still just kinda tastes, ""canned"". Too bad, cause I would love to try one of these in Amsterdam, fresh, unpasteurized."
"Drink- Eh, if it was free and already drunk."
"Was at a restaurant and there was nothing better to get. I haven't had Heineken in a long time so I decided to see if it was how I remembered. Poured a clear pale yellow with a finger of white head with no lacing. Smells mostly of grains, no real hops. No bitterness at all really. I'm glad this bottle wasn't skunked so it tasted clean, just almost no flavour. Carbonation was way too high."
"It is what it is, so-so Euro style lager, not great, not bad. Not something I would seek out to drink just for itself, but it compliments some food okay."
"D: Very easy to drink; just not much there."
"I do recommend this beer, however there are many out there that are so much better and so much cheaper. I will be getting the Draughtkeg again though."
"D - easy to drink if you're looking to get drunk because of its watery texture; nothing much else to it; if my only options were the BMC's of the beer world and this, I would definitely reach for a Heineken Lager Beer"
"Pours a deep yellow piss color with a thick nasty looking head and zero lacing. Smells like corn and barley some apparent sweetness. Tastes much the same a little corn and a little grain maybe some raisin. Mouthfeel is really thin and watery. Drinkability is poor. I hate this beer."
"D- Very good. Easy to throw this back."
"Avoid this sickening beer!"
"drinkability; quite drinkable and light. Not overly complex but still has an agreeable flavor. This is a good party beer, a typical European Macrobrew, tasty but not great. I still like it."
"Lighter body, crispy tones, and relatively easy feel. It's just too bad the flavors are so awful, otherwise this would be fairly drinkable. I can't believe I used to like this beer."
"Got hooked on this during my honeymoon in Europe. Its better on tap, but still good out of a bottle. People typically can't get past the somewhat skunky smell, but this beer is real drinkable. Its unlike any other beer. In the summer, I'll post up by the pool with a heineken light."
"Yet another Quizzo beer. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises funky wheat, hard water, and a light smattering of flowers. The taste is very similar, with more water, air (yes, I tasted some air in there...trust me...), and mowed grass. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, an overtly watery weakling of a beer, something I really hope those wacky Europeans don't consider a fine brew."
"Flavor is strange.. a bit off. I believe this to be a characteristic of heineken that I have tasted before... not skunky, just a weird metallic aftertaste. Finishes dry and mildly refreshing. Not a great beer, but it is either this or amstel light on special."
"tastes like funky with a hint of aluminum. beware. it might be skunked... so im not sure how valid this review is... i may try it again on tap sometime and edit this review."
"Beer is medium to light in body and has a grainy bitterness at the back of the beer. There isn't much of an aftertaste, or a forward taste, or a back taste, its a wet, watery beer. Its OK."
"This is one of my least favorite beers. I'd drink Old Milwaukee before I'd grab this out of a cooler. I simply don't like it. After about 5 it taste like someone has sprayed the inside of my mouth with bug spray. It seems to get more and more bitter as you drink it. Flavor is lacking if you can call anything it offers flavor. I rarely rail beers, however, a great ad campaign can't make up for a poor beer at best."
"Hollands best known beer is still one of the worst Dutch beers one can think of. It's taste is too chemical, and you have to keep drinking if you do not want to feel sick immediately. Of course, it looks pretty good, maybe even better than a lot of Dutch beers like Bavaria or Lindeboom, which look like tap-water, but still looks are deceiving. When compared to Belgian lagers, or even the German lagers, it just can't close the gap. Yes, it's easy to drink, and yes, it's cheap, but please, get real, it's just not the good stuff! One can only drink this brew when it is ice-cold, and when it is consumed in large, very large quantities. It is just not the real deal. I would even prefer a Bud, than having to drink this. I'm sorry, but for real? Heineken?"
"Crisp and refreshing, kind of coming around on Heineken, used to hate it."
"Overall: For what it is, Heineken falls flat in my opinion. As an import, it's extremely overpriced and too hyped for its own good. I will say that its crispness does help to cleanse the palate while eating heavier dishes at restaurants and adds a contrast, but on its own, I have a hard time enjoying this brew."
"To me this is the definition of a truly average ""premium import"". Tastes of a decent mixture of hops and corn, as the smell is the same. The carbonation seems pretty manageable and the head was a decent two to three finger amount. All in all, I could drink a decent amount of these but if I was faced with a choice of any import it wouldn't be my first. I purchased these because of a 2/$3 16oz can deal and poured them into a chilled pint glass."
"Light amber gold color, 5 on the SRM chart. Thick, white, tight head of three fingers. Head disipated in about a minute leaving thin lacing with little body or cling. Smells like mild wheat bread with a overtone of hops. Tastes like wheat and rice with a slight bitter hint of hops. Nothing great about the feeling of this beer in my mouth, slight twang from the bubbles, but quite thin otherwise. This beer goes down smooth and gets better with a little warmth. Not one of my favorites, but some like the name, and the price is good enough to bring it to any party."
"A bit of metal, a bit of bland yeastiness, and no alcoholic taste (I guess that's OK) and you don't even think you're drinking a real beer. This is not suggested."
"A bit of metal, a bit of bland yeastiness, and no alcoholic taste (I guess that's OK) and you don't even think you're drinking a real beer. This is not suggested."
"Looked better than the can version, less metallic flavor, but not really any different."
"From the US 24 fl. oz. bottle no. 0167528D1540. Sampled on September 10, 2010. A highly agitated pale yellow pour leads to a two-inch thick puffy, soapy white head that lingers more or less. The green bottle causes the inevitable skunkiness but still there are bits of grain, grass, and light hops in there. The taste leads with a good dose of barley malts and a slightly hopped by sour ending. Heineken, the one served at parties as the alternative to Bud-Miller-Coors. But their TV ads are good."
"That being said, it's not the worst option available at the store or bar. It's definitely better than the ""usual suspects."" Ultimately, it has a bitter taste, where you can really taste the alcohol."
"All in all, a so-so beer, but a notch above some of the blander US fare."
"There are a few things I find offensive, namely the persistent underlying sulfur and the gritty teeth finish, but overall it does quite well against other macros."
"to sum it up i COULD drink it all night given its ABV and the fact that it doesn't fill you up too much, but i'd rather go for something a little less proccessed and a little more tastefull"
"Indubitably I will."
"Nothing too spectacular, nor offensive."
"D - I would probably have this as a last resort. I bought it for the sake of economy and to revisit somethign I have drank for probably at least 5 yrs -not something I would recommend."
"Drinkability: When out for dinner and the selection is limited, Heineken is a good choice, but I wouldn't buy any for the home."
"I switched to wine."
"Pretty light for a lager. I think it is a little too heavily carbonated, and seems a little like an alcoholic sprite. The carbonation definitely overrides any truly distinctive flavor in the beer. Despite this, i do think heineken is more refreshing than most beers, and i never turn one down"
"Overall, this was the first beer I ever tried. I hated it then, but now I could drink this with ease. However, I rarely ever purchase this beer. This is just a middle of the road beer. You could do much worse, but also much better."
"Heineken is a great go-to beer when you're in the mood for something above the American macro-brew. As a matter of fact, I could probably drink it as my regular beer, with occasional rotation to something with a little more kick. Not the best beer on earth, but absolutely worth trying if you haven't, and worth retrying if you have!"
"RJT"
"Large head with an agressive pour. Pale gold with sharp clarity. Smell has the familiar musty, grassy aroma that the european lagers are known for but is very light. Taste is clean and fresh. A little honey flavor from the malts and a little bit of grass from the hops. Again, very light on flavor. Very easy drinker, hence the popularity. Not anything special but I've had worse."
"D: Hey if you want to show your friends that you can spend money buy them Heineken. I would treat my friends better and get some Bitburger, Pauli Girl, or Yuengling if I didn't want to give them swill. Not bad but not great either."
"M/D: light bodied with a lot of carbonation in the mouth surprising considering the almost non existant head. Drinkability is good if kept in the bottle and served at suggested temperature."
"A european lager very basic and a bit simplistic. Mouth small but also affected by low acidity and a touch of course, like the green fruit that is found in both the bitterness in the aftertaste. She recalls as a little European standards such as Carlsberg. Easy to drink but no real flavor"
"D- Not bad. Interesting flavors that make me want to try it again and again, but not something I'd want a lot of. Too much cheap hops for me."
"Pours a clear golden color, head dissipated quickly. Smells a little funny, but i did get that grainy smell. tastes like nothing spectacular, a little bitter, a little grainy, and you can taste the alcohol in there. it feels thin and carbonated. overall, this is not the beer for me. Heineken is the sophisticated beer of my grandfather's generation. To me, it is just another bland import lager."
"D: It is a refreshing feeling beer. If not for the persistent skunkiness I could see this being enjoyable in large quantities."
"O: While the beer is cold drink it quickly, don't let it be just a couple degrees warmer."
"D - Meh. Better than BMC, but not by much."
"It's drinkable as are most mild Euro lagers. There is a time and place for Heineken and it's widely available. I'm thinking summer into fall, when fishing perhaps. It does taste a bit better from the 5-liter minikegs that are now widely available."
"This is one of those beers appropriate if you're looking wake up in the morning around the toilet. It doesn't have a terrible taste but the smell is horrendous. Also, I don't recommend it for any significant food pairing because of the potent aftertaste."
"Tried this again in a mini keg and it was very decent it would rate this beer 3.5. The taste is so cripser and cleaner. I dont know what it is about the bottle that makes it skunkier, but tap makes better. Keg has no skunky taste or smell and mouthful is refreshing"
"I've had this numerous times and I'll probably drink it again. I would encourage others not to believe the marketing, step away from it, and try something better. This was a beer I use to think was very good."
"While Heineken probably isn't good enough to warrant its expensive price or ubiquitous worldwide reputation, there are other factors that distinguish it from many mainstream, industrially-produced lagers; namely, that it's palatable and still recognizable as a traditional European-style lager. Beyond that, however, there really isn't much else to say."
"cheers!"
"Not sure I like this beer. It's very well advertised but I think it should be placed a little above the big three light beers. Absolutely not worth the price. Blah what is next."
"Drinkability- It's crisp and goes down easy, but it's price is prohibitive. Better beers could be obtained for the same cost."
"Mouthfeel was very thin but was carbonated quite well. Overall, this beer was minimally different from other standard American style lagers. Quite bland, but I guess it would be ok as a lawnmower beer."
"D - it's not that good. The overwhelming bad flavor ad aroma combine to make a bad beer. Pass on this in the aisle."
"D- It's popular and drinkable. Not necessarily my thing, but it remains something of an icon in terms of imported beer."
"Gets weaker and thinner down bottle, there is no real taste other than the skunkishness, which is actually agreeable in a strange way to a hophead I guess."
"This is a nice example of a pale lager, probably one of the better ones of that style. A good one to go to if the craft ales are not to be had, and a nice one for warm weather."
"D - if your looking for flavor this isnt it if your just looking for something to quinch your thirst here you go"
"D- Mass produced lager with a weak flavour profile. Not much else to say really. Pass!"
"There are few bigger triumphs in marketing than Heineken's campaigns (Corona's is one of those few)."
"Taste has decent hop over mild malt sweet. Has a czech pils minerally bitter bite and tin-like hop flavor (also oranges and graham cracker). Some nice dextrinous mouthfeel that washed clean due to the prickly cleansing finish. Light and drinkable. No 'skunky' flavor like many people claim. Purchased from Superior Liquor in Colorado."
"Drinkability- Probably deserves a lower score but i drink it time to time and is available in a lot of bars"
"Served from bottle into an imperial pint. Poured a pale yellow with minimal white head. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma consisted of a musty and sour note. The flavor was of wheat, sour, and nutty hints. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew is very bland. Definitely needs more flavorings to be competitive with others in its style. Aroma would help as well as it is not appealing. Not horrible if you are in a pinch but if you have a choice of something else, choose it."
"Had one of these at a Memorial Day party in honor of the late, great Dennis Hopper. ""Heineken, Fuck that shit; Pabst Blue Ribbon."" Rest in Peace, Brother. Not much else to say here...A watery looking light golden color, a finger or so of bright white foam, a skunky aroma and a taste to match. A disappointment all around; I should have went home and watched ""Blue Velvet"" instead."
"One of the better ""on a budget"" beers that ill go to if I am low on funds."
"Its 85 degrees today, this beer is cold, and as refreshing as can be. Ive never had a Heineken this fresh out of a bottle."
"Overall: A very drinkable beer, though lacking somewhat in the flavour department, but still very crisp and nice. The local version of this beer is much poorer."
"Poured into mug, and seems kind of light for a lager. It smells like marijuana. Has a decent taste, but is not very drinkable as it starts to have a ""funky"" taste after one or two bottles. Not sure why this is the ""go-to"" beer for some of my buddies."
"It has been years since I last had one of these, and honestly it is better than the last time since this bottle isn't skunked! There's no hint of grains and grasses - just pure adjunct flavors and a hint of hops."
"Pours a bright clear light gold with a small white head. Smell is some herbal hops and light sweet malt. Pretty flavorful. Herbal hops. Good light malt backbone. Finishes a bit dry and medium bodied. Well carbonated. Very drinkable. This is one where the serving type really matters. The green bottles skunk this beer. Way better on tap or in cans."
"ok,found this next to a dumpster at work. a vigorous pour into a pilsner glass reveals a pale clear yellow liquid with a quickly dissapating head. fairly heavy carbonation with not very much lacing.smell is skunked,part rice and corn with no apparent hop aromas present. taste is pretty close to the smell not much going on. but hey,it was free and ill take it over bud light anyday.good for the style if your into euro pale lagers.ill give this one a mediocre review because its good for what it is."
"Overall: This is way better in a can. However I will say (as I said in my can review) that I will take this over a Bud any day."
"Overall this beer really is not worth the money, and I don't really enjoy drinking it, because of the mineral aftertaste. I could care less if it is from Holland, because it's just not that good."
"Pretty crisp, solid swill for someone that is seeking a Euro alternative to the typical party beers. If you try comparing this to the finest from the local craft breweries, of course you'll be disappointed. If you're a more typical, mainstream beer drinking kind of person and don't drink your beer from a glass, it's worth a shot."
"D. East to relax and drink with. Not a beer you can down a whole bunch of."
"D: It makes me pretty happy that this is one of the best selling beers in the world - if the majority drinks this, then there will be lots of quality-beer left for me (and most of you guys)."
"The body, like most pale lagers, is extremely thin and wet. This is made to be drunk quickly. Spot on for the style, but I don't care for it. Very light, weak flavors make this one up. Some buttered corn and a bit of a lemon-y twang on the finish. This is a drinkable beer because it's light, wet, and quasi-refreshing, but I'm gonna pass."
"Not very drinkable. I would call this beer ""bad", and overpriced as well."
"Value: Hell no."
"drinkability ok. better than i expected. it's not bad for a grainy, watery pilsener."
"Got one of these for free at an art show I went to, might as well review it. Thought it would be amusing for my 100th review as well. Came in a cute little 7 oz bottle. Pale straw color, fizzy white head that only looks foams up and looks decent only after taking a sip so it gets shaken around, then quickly goes away. Smell is barely anything at all, I suppose you can pick up that ""beery"" smell. Taste is pretty blech, but I've had worse as far as macros go. Instead of the bready corn taste in an average American macro it's kind of a stale fruit taste. Definitely some Euro-ness. Even some booze detectable (lol). Mouthfeel is actually decent. Seems well-bodied and carbonation is not bad. I am not a fan of the taste but it is pretty easy to drink. Even after this small bottle I was all set. By the finish, I wouldn't say it was god-awful, but I have at least a handful of macros I'd pick over this."
"One of my friends bought a 12-pack of these last month, so I was mooching them off him for a while before I turned 21. From this experience, I can accurately say that I've never had a beer that so accurately replicates the ""keg experience""-- with every sip, I felt like a bro with a popped collar was pouring awful frat keg beer directly into my mouth. That said, Heineken is a typically unpretentious American beer that's easy to chug, bong, or do typically stupid college things with. In fact, it's probably better than most beers, in that respect. It's not really a good beer, but it's not really, really bad either. Not for aesthetes."
"Not my favorite beer style but certainly better than most of it's ilk. I had this in Ireland where it's supposed to be better because of the proximity of a Heineken brewery in Cork and yes, it was better."
"This is a good, not great beer. I would drink this with some friends and not complain, but it would not be my first choice."
"As mainstream lagers go, this is probably one of the better ones."
"Overall: I think Heineken might be a bit overrated, at least compared to what other people and commercials tell me. Let's just say if I go to Amsterdam ever, I'd choose the competition."
"I'm a Heineken fan, I'll admit it. For some reason, a lot of my friends don't like it, but I really enjoy it. It's not too light, not too heavy, and I really like the taste. They have a great carbonation, which seems like an odd thing to say, but I like the bubbles. I think the mini kegs are even better. Go get one"
"d-very drinkable, if yo have never drank a beer before this could be a good first even thought this isnt the best it is not the worst you could have"
"D - Terrible. Unless this beer is on sale, and nothing else is available, I tend to stay away."
"Overall there is nothing about this beer that is worthy of any serious down rating. It is kind of a ""just because its not good doesn't mean its bad"" situation. In this way Heineken is kind of a lager benchmark of sorts for me. I consider this an perfectly average lager, no better, no worse."
"This is the first time I have had this beer since I started drinking craft. The funny thing is that I used to think this beer was far and away the best beer out there (at the time I drank mostly Rolling Rock & LaBatts), now that I have been exposed to other good lagers I can see that this is mediocre at best..."
"Overall i wouldn't try it again probably. But hey, there's different beer for everybody."
"D - Definitely not a beer of choice (if there is any)"
"Nothing really stands out. This is an average beer. I have seen better, of course."
"Yay, an import! It is therefore different and good, right? Wrong. This beer sucks, bottom line. I can honestly say nothing good about it, and I think it is pretty simply a waste of money. If I want a macrobrew, give me just about anything by the BMC folks instead of this awful offering. Just not good."
"I could drink these during any time of the year but it surely isn't anything close to a specialty beer."
"Notes: Decent for a Euro-lager type beer. Not good, but decent for what it is."
"That's not to say Heineken doesn't have a place in beer drinking. Just have to pair it up with the right things."
"Cheers!"
"O: good drinkability. Heineken has somehow, personality. Its smell and taste are a trademark"
"Not impressed, or depressed about this beer. Has some flavor, but not a whole lot. Pretty convinced there's a lot better lagers out there."
"The apperance is average with a light straw color. The smell is nice with a real nice hint of skunk. The taste is good though quite light considered to the smell. The mouthfeel is light but noticable wich finishes to a nice drinkablility. Pretty good beer in my opinion. Go out and get one you want be dissapointed."
"So far, I've seen very few exceptions to the ""if it's brown, I'm down, if it's green, flush it down the latrine, if it's transparent, skunking is apparent"" rule, but Heineken is no exception. Subpar appearance, an overpowering skunky nose, only somewhat remedied by a crisp mouthfeel. I'm just not impressed by this beer."
"To make a short review longer, Heine., on draft, excells when compared to the cans / bottles."
"You gotta' love the Euro inspired directions included for tapping the 5L mini-keg. Trying to avoid catastrophe by breaking the plastic induction molded parts I referred to the professionals on you-tube for the answers. It's amazing how many videos depict troubled souls attempting to put this thing together when the only desire is to pour a cold one. Who wouda' thunk it was as simple as push and pull! Yet I digress....Like most who have poured from the 5, one instantly realizes the extraordinary difference by the lack of the skunk-funk that is omnipresent in the bottle version. With this, H pours a crisp 14k gold with a impressive head that is not seen in the bottle variety. Clean, crisp and almost velvety in the mouth, this brew will provide massive drinkability and extended session enjoyment for all who partake. Cost wise at 16 bucks a keg, it's more price efficient to draw your beer from the keg than pop those mean green bottles. Tap one today!!"
"D- While this is a fairly average beer in my opinion, I don't mind it and think it's very easy to drink. It doesn't have a heavy flavor and goes down easy. A great palate scrubber and a very good beer to enjoy in hot weather, but it's also okay as a beer for everyone to enjoy in the pub."
"a Very mediocre beer to say the least. Way to commercial for my liking and basically just a typical euro lager. Heineken has a very pale appearance and whats noticable about it, it has a strange aftertase unlike anything ive had before, ill admit once you get a few in ya it becomes a lot more tolerable and even slighly enjoyable. Its mouthfeel is average at best with no outstanding qualities. I would not buy this again but i would certainly drink if offered."
"Drinkability: I have to rate this above average. Very sessionable and enjoyable just enough to have another one when nothing else is available. I feel like I had to settle for this beer, but, it does go very well with food. Sure, there may be better, but this one works in a pinch."
"Heineken isn't very exciting beer to drink. Something seems missing to the equation, and it also seems they added one wrong thing to the formula. I can cope drinking a few, but it won't be my first choice."
"Pours with a very light golden color, transparent in body, and a minimal head. Has a prominent malt smell, almost skunky. Definitely a euro style beer. Tastes are malty, but with a crisp finish that I enjoyed. It's an easy beer to drink, but getting over the bitterness is a task. I could drink this easily but I definitely see why one might have a tough time."
"Drinkability: Above average, but the bitterness puts off which could be an excellent drinkability. Nothing really that spectacular about Heineken, I'll stick to the American beers."
"drinkability is ok - i would drink this over any american macro"
"However, if you're in europe and it's available on tap it is much better."
"This beer is one of the staple beers my peer group enjoys for many reasons. In the American beer drinking culture it is exactly what people are looking for: a easy-drinking lager with a light body and a light hop presence. For the American light lager fan it is great. However, for the seasoned beer drinker, it lacks any outstanding qualities yet still offers a good alternative to Miller and Bud. Light in body and easy to drink, this sparkling clear beer is a textbook lager. The taste offers slightly earthy and crisp hop notes, but lacks an attractive aroma. Also lacking in mouthfeel due to watery quality. Although, on a hot summer day around a backyard barbeque, you can toss me about 6 or 7 Heines and I won't have a problem with that."
"Clear, pale yellow, and devoid of head 5 seconds after the pour out of a 24oz. bottle. Smell has a touch of skunk, but not too bad. There are also touches of grass and sweetness. This sounds odd, but I also sense a hint of coffee in the smell and taste. There seems to be nothing roasted here, so I'm not sure what gives the beer this quality. Goes down easy and is pretty refreshing. I am actually enjoying this beer which I wasn't expecting. I've had some pretty skunkified versions of this in the past."
"D: Certainly not a great beer like so many people seem to think it is, but it's not the worst pale/adjunct lager out there. It's tolerable when it's not skunky, but still not my first choice."
"M/D: The beer felt light, crisp and pretty refreshing with a little bitter aftertaste. I am certainly not as disappointed as I expected to be going into it. Overall, not too bad, but I would not buy it, but I would drink it if I had limited options."
"Poured from a 12 ounce green bottle with no freshness date. Good light, light golden appearance. No real head or lacing to mention. Smells like malt and sugary sweetness. There is a slight bite to the taste. Sweet and bubbly, not bitter at all but a solid bite on the end of my tongue. All and all a pretty easy drinker. I probably pound a few of these in a row."
"It always amuses me that this is marketed as a go-to beer at ""clubs"" I've been to. Not that I go to clubs often, but it's just a strange beer to think of as classy and superior. Smells and tastes skunky. Kind of like old dishwater and weed. Somewhat metallic in flavor as well. A slight sweetness lingers. High carbonation that hits your tongue. Somehow it's not terrible though. I would still take this over a Bud Light."
"Tastes very different to the Heineken on tap around this fair city, very pleasant on the tongue and very drinkable."
"I personally like it when it is skunked. I really dig that taste and Heineken really provides that for me. Great session beer."
"Served on a glass. Nice golden colour and a white head that stays for a little while. Smells herbal-like and a bit malty. Tastes a bit metallic, but still a touch of sweet . Nice carbonation and it goes down easy. It's really refreshing and a lot better than the beers made around here. Not so bad after all."
"D: When i'm drinking i imagine i'm watching Champions League games."
"I have had alot of good times, many years ago drinking Heineken,...but with the thousands of craft brews on the market, why bother. I have heard rumors over the years that a Heineken over in Europe tastes alot different than what is available in the U.S.... next Heineken review may reflect that!"
"Pours a golden body with a large head but not much retention or lacing. Smells just awful. Smells like a skunked beer, I feel like if I put an adjunct in the sun for a month this is what I'd get. Tastes is not that bad however. Standard weak graininess on top of an already weak hop/malt body. Mouthfeel was poor on this, could use more carbonation. It's fairly drinkable, but the small is just such a turn-off that I wouldn't put myself through smelling a second."
"Pours a bright, clear golden straw color. Huge white frothy and prickly head. Suprisingly sticky lacing towards the top of the glass. Smell is of pale pale malts, but clean and lacking the lager twang of bottled Euro Lagers. Taste again is pale malts, hints of grass and straw and also lacks the lager twang. Light, crip, refresshing... yadda yadda yadda. Much better fresh on draft than in the bottle... MUCH BETTER"
"Drinkability? This is an easy quaffer, more so in this big old can than in the bottle. No worries about being light struck-skunked-whatever. A nice, decent tasting Lager that is simple yet tasty. If you are going to give Heineken a try, I thoroughly recommend trying the canned version. I think it is much closer to what the brewer intended for it, at leat, tastewise."
"i like this beer alot, ive been drinking it for a while now, and the only beer i would take over this is a sam adams octoberfest. it doesnt look like anything special but i am a huge fan of it cuz ofthe drinkability and flavor, alt of people would probably disagree with me"
"This bottle is brewed in Shanghai by the China branch."
"Notes: This is what my grandpa drinks all the time. I can appreciate it for what it is. It really lives up to being a premium macro beer I think. It is superior to BMC on every level, but is still in the same category."
"D = Although (or perhaps because) this is an incredibly light, almost ephemeral, tasting beer, this is quite drinkable. Goes down smoothly and easily and is not hard to take the next drink nor to imagine sharing more if in a social situation."
"even the cans aren't much better, but they're still the best option in the USO sandbox when stacked up against the murderer's row of BMC's"
"Drinkability- A highly drinkable beer, although its fairly expensive for what it is."
"D: easy to drink"
"Overall, a decent lager from the Netherlands. Good for a night out with the friends."
"Overall Impressions: Draft (draught keg) is better than the bottled (more skunky) Heineken and is very nice experience for the home. OK beer for what it is, but it really drinks like water. The tap spigot continues to drip for some time and was a bit messy."
"I wouldn't normally choose this anymore, although I used to like it when I first started drinking beer in my 20s. It's drinkable though--I finished this one."
"In general much better than standard american adjunct lagers, but not incredible."
"Drinkability: Okay ice cold but becomes borderline undrinkable as it warms, even to 40 degrees."
"The feel is crisp in a light body with a moderate carbonation and a little less thinness than I expected."
"Drinkability: Pretty much what I expected. This is adjunct/macro territory here."
"Drinkability: Whenever, wherever. It hasn’t changed a bit over the years and depending on your prospective that might be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, that’s a good thing. This is not a great beer, but rather a solid choice. I can think of 50 other beers I’d rather be drinking and 200 other beers I’d rather not be drinking. Heineken Lager is available everywhere and along with a handful of other beers is a default choice when a personal favorite is not on the menu."
"Drank five of these and slept for the entire ten hour flight to America."
"It's been said here numerous times, but this is something that needs confirmation, over and over: this beer is skunked and it is awful. Taste and smell (odor), if this doesn't throw you off, you need a nose and palate transplant. Nuff said."
"Heineken is a great beer. I love it. Nice to have while watching a game with the boys and relaxing. A lighter taste with a slight bite to it I guess you could say. The Bubba keg also is great, and from my experience, keeps well even after a day or two. :o)"
"I've always thought this beer to be mediocre, but after reviewing it, it really is not all that bad."
"I still have a Heineken when there's little else available but there's plenty better beers than this. And it's not worth it's premium import price."
"Drinkability- Definitely highly drinkable and enjoyable, its only downside in drinkability at all was it came off pretty sweet, I am shocked honestly I enjoyed this beer to the extent that I did, had bad experiences with this beer in the past and this was actually pretty good to me, is it the greatest beer ever no but not bad what so ever and now that its price has come back down quite a bit it will be one I will definitely have time to time for a cheaper light beer for session, I was definitely one who avoided this beer like the plague but no skunk here,"
"Drinkability - Low. If consumed cold from a chilled glass on a hot day with lots of salty food it might serve ok."
"D: The long, harsh laundry detergent with black pepper aftertaste defeats the initially soothing, citrusy, floral experience."
"On a hot day, these go down well while working out in the yard. I keep at least a 6 of Heineken in the fridge when not in the mood for something heavier and more complex or when guests drop by."
"Overall: Not my favorite pilsner, don't understand why it is one of the worlds most consumed pilsners..Still decent"
"D: A fairly drinkable macro-lager that, strangely, works slightly better in a can than a bottle. I have to admit I was fairly surprised."
"By far not the best beer in the world, but one that is readily available in most places. Given the choice between bottle and can I'll pick can every time."
"D: Easy drinking, not particularly special. Good thing its cheap as heck in Europe!"
"Gotta love the Dutch though"
"D - You can drink a lot of them if thats what you mean...not for taste though."
"Drinkability: Decent, I guess. Just don't let it warm up."
"Pours deep straw gold with a fingers worth of fizzy white head. It has poor head retention, and doesn't leave any lace. It smells faintly of honey, grains and grass. The aroma of this is very muted. Mild sweet cereal flavour up front, with a kiss of noble hop in the finish. Light bodied with somewhat spritzy carbonation. It's easy drinking and refreshing, but bland."
"~ 12 oz bottle. God, what a boring lager this is. Typically found in mass quantities at local teenage house parties all across the US. I really want to give this beer a fighting chance, but I just cannot. As scary as this sounds, I've actually had worse! :-0 ~"
"Not a bad beer & a beer that often presents itself as an OK substitute when the choices are things I wouldn't feed to a monkey-killer."
"Now that I think of it, it's almost like a Miller High Life Plus. It's Miller HL with a little something extra..."
"Very pale golden color with not much head at all. There's a grainy aroma mixed with an almost vegetable-like smell, somewhat like wet broccoli. Not a whole lot of flavors but pretty much tastes like it smells. There's a light, easy-going drinkability, which is clearly why it's so popular. Definitely something you can pound at a party but also something that has a little bit of flavor at the same time."
"beer made for drinking. no ill effects on the palate. brew goes down smooth and crisp."
"edit: no this wasnt a drain-pour, i didnt want my sink to smell bad. i flushed this shit."
"This beer is nothing special. It's hyped beyond reason...for no reason. I'll take many other Dutch beers before this one. Heineken has no drinkability for me, it is very sour and putrid tasting and I even ignored my own senses and drank a 12 pack of these on New Years to at least ""try"" to like them. All I got was a massive hangover. Also, it's worth noting that this beer tastes even worse coming up than going down. I really hate to be graphic, and I usually have no problem with any given beer or brewer/brewery...but this beer tastes horrible. They need to rethink their formula because this one is not right. Also...green bottles...bad. If this brew came in a brown bottle, I'd give it a second shot. Until then, my experience with this beer has not been a pleasant one. No disrespect to those who like it either, beer is all about individual opinions and experiences after all. I just have mine and there it is."
"Drinkability: OK. The colder the better."
"I sadly couldn't think of a way to tie this into the review so here's an out of place quote from the movie Blue Velvet, ""Heineken? Fuck that shit! PABST BLUE RIBBON!"""
"D-Refreshing...had to wait until I was back on the Old Continent to rate this one to ensure maximum freshness, and next I'll compare it to the local macros."
"But the wedding was very nice though."
"Bottle. Smell of skunk and urine and maybe some grain. Transparent yellow in color. Very light body. It tastes like I imagine urine would taste like. I don't understand why Heineken is sold as widely as it is, as there are plenty of more appealing choices."
"D - I can't drink any more of this. It tastes so bad, I'd rather have water. I'd rather have Miller Light, Bud Light, Coors Light, anything besides this. It is absolutely disgusting, which is too bad because they have great commercials."
"D: I have to admit, this beer is much better out of a can instead of a bottle. The nasty skunky aroma that you get from the bottle, which makes it undrinkable for me, isn't present. At least out of the can you get just the generic macro flavor."
"T/ M/ D - taste is crisp, but dominated by the skunky, sulphury tomes. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied. Drinkability is very high, since this is one of the biggest beers in the world it has to be, but personally for me I can barely get through about 3 before I need to move on."
"D - a highly drinkable euro lager. more flavor than some of the mainstreams, but an average one at best. leaves you wanting a bit more flavor and complexity, but in the ballpark."
"Drinkability: Lousiest Heineken I've ever had, and Heineken is already a lousy beer. While the flavor sucked, this was still pretty easy to finish. I'm assuming I had a bad can. I'm willing to order this again only to prove myself right."
"D: Goes down easy and smooth."
"D- Despite the fact that this beer is one-dimensional, it is somewhat refreshing, and quite drinkable."
"nothing special going on here a little too much money for what you get"
"Poured into glass. I was not impressed with the smell of this and the taste was even worse. Recommend that everyone pass on this..."
"Mouthfeel is fine and this is eminently drinkable. Just try a pint in a comfortable chair on your shady deck!"
"D- Pretty crisp, I could see how it would easy to session, just not by me."
"Pours a very light pale yellow with a slight head. The smell is very crisp and of rice and corn. The taste is crisp and sharp but of corn and rice, maybe a faint hint of hops. There is not a lot going on in the taste, it is the same as most american adjuncts. The mouthfeel is good, moderate carbonation, and a crisp clean feel. The drinkability is slightly above average, you could drink a lot of these, however, since there is not a lot going on it would be easy to get bored."
"meh. poured light, clear yellow with a small fizzy head. smelled kind of bitter. Tasted bland, with a little hop bite. Light bodied and definitely easy to session, but not impressive at all. Just like any other crappy mass produced lager and over priced for the poor quality."
"Any american mass market lager tastes great compared to Heineken, and for much less. Not to mention all the other europen imports that are in the same price range."
"Poured from a bottle; golden yellow color with a thin white head. Smells okay, nothing special or too distinct. Disgusting metallic bitter taste, somewhat skunky. Bitter aftertaste lingers too longer for its own good. I would never buy this for myself."
"I don't know what they do to it but they need to get the ""skunkiness"" out of this beer. They would then be left with something that would be worth its wieght in salt to stand up to, lets say sam adams or something else it the price range."
"Can't believe I never reviewed this.. probably because the only time I have it is when it's left in the fridge by someone else. For those of you looking for a macro beer at a micro price (usually $13 or $14 a 12 pack) this is your beer of choice. I mean it's a step above Budweiser/Miller Lite for sure.. has some a little bit of hop flavor to it. But it' just too watery, no head or lacing to it, barely any flavor.. just blah. And you're paying a premium price for it.. just for the label and the commercials everyone sees. Like most people already know, there are thousands of better imports better than this one... but hey, its beer and it ain't terrible."
"Drinkability: Not bad. It's a little bland for my personal taste, but this is something I could drink again if I were in the proper mood."
"D - I like this beer and haven't had it in a while. Delicious for a standard and easily drinkable. I could put quite a few away."
"D: I wouldn't turn this one down on a hot summer day. I'd like to see other brews from Heineken!"
"It smells and taste hoppy and in the American version has a horrible bitter taste, and in Amsterdam it is leseened and makes it tolerable."
"Overall, there are worse beers out there. It is fairly clean, which helps in the drinkability department, but it still is lacing in so many areas that you have to really want a beer - any beer - in order to drink this. Not the worst, but why this is one of the top sellers in the US is beyond me."
"Quality ingredients, smooth malt flavor, and sharp hops all ruined by that stupid green bottle. Usually the beer is skunky, so it just makes me blanche. When it's not skunky, an above average lager. It beats the hell out of any US production beer though, except for Sam Adams."
"Overall, I find it a highly session-able beer for a warm summer day."
"After visting this brewery before and tasting alot of this beer i think it only right that i at least review it as ive def drank enough of it(not my choice),this beer pours a pale golden colour with a one finger creamy white head with perfect carbonation and definately looks like a euro lager,on the nose its got quite a florally smell to it with nice hops and yeast aswell,and on tasting its pretty much your standard euro lager nothing special but its definately alot better than some other euro lagers i have tasted and must say anything that reminds me of amsterdam cant be too bad a thing."
"In terms of mainstream, crap beer - I'd rather just drink mickeys than this stuff"
"I wouldn't really want to drink a bunch of these but it would do when the other options are Budweiser, Molson and Labatt."
"D: i dont dog on heineken it is a big company but at least they use barley and not fucking corn and rice adjuncts in there beer i can drink a whole lot of these"
"I love drinking this by the 6 pack , Very easy to keep drinking , that's why I suggest the mini keg for partying purposes."
"D-There's nothing much better than this beer on a warm summer afternoon to quench my thirst and cool me down. Well, perhaps one thing better: enjoying this beer on a warm summer afternoon on an airplane on the way for a quick vacation. But, air travel aside, Heineken from the can has a much fresher flavor than the bottled stuff and is overall a ver easy-drinking brew."
"Notes: I think of this beer as a classier, upscale alternative to Bud, Miller and PBR. The kind of beer that well-to-do if ignorant, beer drinkers would drink at a cookout. I suppose it is better than most American macros but this is not a particularly good beer. I would drink it again at a cookout if there weren't any good micro brews or tasty ales available or if i just wanted to get drunk without getting full."
"Mouthfeel is on the high side of the carbonation scale and the beer has a thin body"
"Given it's pricing, I can't help but review this compared to similar priced craft brews, and confirm that this one simply fails the test."
"Drinkability - very good alongside a plate of nachos or other pop culture fare. Goes down easy with moderate character and superb cleanness as always."
"D- Enjoyable, but lacking in depth of flavor. Good one for a barbeque."
"Hey, if you're on vacation, and Heineken is a choice on the plane...go for it! You can't go wrong!"
"Grabbed a freebie bottle at a work event, so why not? Pours with a clear and yellow body. Fizzy amount of carbonation. Puffy white head, but fades fast. Smell was a bit grassy. Run of the mill taste. Kinda malty. Thin and watery, but easy to drink. Sometimes you get a slightly ""skunky"" Heinie in due to those green bottles, but this one was ok. It's one of those whatever beers. Nothing great, but you can knock one back if there's nothing much else being offered."
"Outside of any bias anyone may have for the beer, it pours a wonderful golden color with a nice head that fist dissipates fast, but some of it stays for the round. The smell is not that strong and a little watery which is not good for its gender (does not suppose to be an American Light Beer). It has a slight bite to it with just a touch of a salty taste that you can only tell if trying to notice it. It is a very drinkable beer. Suggestion, I you want to power drink and import, drink Heineken. But, it is not a taste friendly beer to the diverse beer drinker."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. There is a gold color with a small head. Not much aroma to speak of. The taste is crisp and refreshing. Goes down very smooth. A watery feel in the mouth. I prefer it from the bottle. Highly drinkable and overall a good beer."
"I'm not a fan of pale lagers, but this seems even worse than others."
"Notes - Apparently canned Heineken lacks most of the skunk of the bottled variety. That would be good, except it leaves almost nothing left. Back in the day, this saved me from having to drink Bud at certain parties. In these days of better selection, though, Heineken just doesn't cut it."
"This is not a good beer; it's actually more offensive to my taste than most BMCs."
"Drinkability: Definitely a Euro lager. It might be a decent selection in the style, but not something for me. The malts are too bitter and light, with a little stale imported beer taste."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head. Smells of cooked corn and sulfur. Taste is thinly malty, watery, with a hint of Euro lager yeast strain. A bit of bitterness from the hops, but not much. Mouthfeel is watery, high carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, a step above BMC IMO, but for the same price you can get real craft beer, so I doubt I will purchase this in the future."
"According to the Heineken aficionados that I seem to spend a lot of time with, the tap version is much better than the bottled one. I don't really particularly care to argue the case, or even validate it, but suffice it to say, it sure doesn't bode well for those green bottles in yer better beertubs around town."
"Conclusion: This isn't all that bad; it's good for washing down a good pizza as I'm currently doing; this is better than the typical BMC lager, but I wouldn't buy this to drink on its own."
"D- It's great with meals and it's also great by itself. This is one of my first beers actually. I think this is and Sam Adams Brown Ale are the beers that got me to love Beer. I love Heineken and I get it every now and then."
"Pours a pale yellow and lots of carbonation. The smell is floral with some hint of malt, but very little. The taste is not great, it is below average. Not bad, not great... just an ordinary beer, in my opinion."
"Taste: Nice balanced flowery hop presence in the taste. It actually tasted much better from a can than I thought it would, having only had it from green bottles in the past."
"Not a really offensive beer, but just plain boring."
"This beer is a pretty light and crisp beer. Has a bit of dryness to it but is pretty easy drinking and is easy on the palette."
"I think six packs are 9 & change around the corner. $26.99 even at CostCo. $24 for the mini keg. I know everyone is scared of change, but why not try something else if you're spending that much?"
"D: Sessionable lager for the Euro Pale enthusiast. You either like Heineken, or you don't. I personally do not, but you could do a lot worse if you're out of other options. On a hot day or evening deck party in the summer, I could probably last longer with this than Coronas."
"D: Pretty tough to force down. I don't know how much of that is due to skunkiness versus being inherently shitty. If I wanted to be fair, I'd try it from the keg can or on draft. But I'm sick of their commercials, so fuck them."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is mostly mild and dry with minimal offensivness. Highly drinkable and very enjoyable in mass drinking situations."
"Fairly refreshing, although I would prefer a little more character in the flavor profile."
"Although lacking in body and character, this was still a refreshing beer on a cold day and had a fair amount of balance for it's genre. Good on a hot day. Give it a try."
"D: The less you taste, the better, but manageable overall. Clearly the best aspect of this beer is its looks, so probably best to just hold it for a long time and never bother drinking it."
"Final Thoughts: Well, it's Heineken and it's everything you'd expect from a big name brewer. However, I'd say out of the Macros the green skunk is probably one of the better ones, although that's not saying much. I get the feeling if it was closer to the source it would be even better. All in all, pretty much the beer I'd pick if I was surrounded by other big name beers that were lacking."
"D - Unfortunately the skunk flavor is consistent within every sip which keeps me from coming back. Not exactly hard to drink though."
"Drinkability - good beer, but not spectacular. The taste is a bit too bitter for my liking. I will still definitely finish the 6 pack, no question."
"It's not bad, but I just have a hard time seeing why this one is so famous."
"The foam was light wheat/white color and smooth. Color was a light honey. The smell was light, crisp and good hops flavor. Taste was light, hoppy, pilsey, a little fruity undertones - basic but 10 times better than most American mainstream beers. Mouthfeel was smooth and light. Drinkability - was average and crisp."
"OK drinkability. Honestly, this beer is not as bad as I remember it being. It is pretty decent. However, with the price tag it carries I could pick up a case of Troegs or Victory or Penn or a million other things available in PA. Unless I'm at a party (as was the case here) I don't see myself buying too many Heinekens."
"It's best served as a draft or even out of their draft kegs, it tastes poor out of a can and to me a good beer tastes good no matter how it is served."
"Poured from can into a pilsener. Color is light pale yellow, almost clear like water. Smell is standard for a BMC, maybe a tad more hop aroma. Tastes a tad more malty than a BMC, mouthfeel leaves much to be desired. Honestly it is very drinkable, since it tastes like nothing."
"I poured it into my standard tasting pint and found that this beer looks like an average fizzy yellow beer. Head disappears almost immediately. However, i feel it has a slight degree of depth. Light aroma, not very much in the way of any appeal. My friend really believes this beer tastes like bananas, and maybe it does. I dont get much of anything beyond the taste of diluted malt, and slight sweetness, and a euro mild lager. I wont disagree with the bananas interpretation. An acceptable beer if there is nothing else around... Decent mouthfeel, and i could pound these back. I dont think this is a bad beer...just not something I would drink on the regular."
"It's crisp with a malty taste that's consistent, but again just above average; easy to drink and always seems to have a slight skunky odor. Good carbonation and the ability to pound a ton of these any time, day or night. An ice cold keg can always seems to be fun to drink."
"For its style it actually is lower than I would have thought. The slight skunk builds up for me and limits my consumption to probably about 2 or 3."
"D -- Suffers due to a nasty smell, with an equally nasty taste. The dutch can keep this garbage, for all I care."
"Funny how this used to be somewhat exotic back when I knew absolutely nothing about beer. It's still okay, but not terribly remarkable either. Certainly amongst the best of the pick when you're faced with the usual boring selection at Wal-Mart, a smalltown grocery store, or wherever."
"D: another one thats easy to plow through when you're not going for quality"
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty easyt to consume and due to its lack of intense flavor and 5% alcohol could definitely be a session beer. However, I personally do not enjoy."
"Overall though it was fun to check out and yes I drink this from a bottle if there's little else to choose other than bud, coors or miller at a bar or restaurant. The mini keg could be something for those parties to which the non-beer drinker may find some novelty in the process of pouring a glass...other than that, I doubt there's much worth to it."
"D- Easy to drink considering there isn't much taste. Not terrible just nothing special."
"Taste is a dull toasty malt flavor with a fair dose of hop bitterness. Very little actual hop flavor and missing any sort of sweet malt subsistence. I've heard the Heinie in Europe tastes much better...I hope so. I dont see why anyone would spend premium beer prices for this, I find it to be offensive in almost every way. Yuk."
"D - Very drinkable light beer. Not bad from the can."
"this to me is a good but less then beer,,,,some freinds swear by it but my self i can take it or leave it....it was drinkable but barlely,,its funny now that i think about it,,i used to drink beers like this all the time but then after finding so really good beers it seem the run of the mill everyday beers just dont see to do the trick anymore,,,,"
"Notes: This is your very simple, basic Euro lager for trendy people to say hey look at me I'm drinking an import. Still it's not bad."
"D- Good because my friend paid for it. I have had worse cheap and expensive beer. For a free lager I am not complaining."
"P.S. Keg can! Keg can! Keg Can!"
" Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable I order it alot when im out to eat its usualy the best choice (the other crap they have is bud or bl or cl) and i think it goes good with italian food. Never really buy it in cases though"
"The main reason I don't drink more Heineken is the price. At 8$ a sixer it's often more pricey than some better local micros."
"This beer is crisp and light and full of no frills. Not bad, but it's pretty flavorless."
"D~ This is a good session beer for import drinkers. I'd personally prefer a micro domestic lager. Good overall and it's a lager people, judge it that way!"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink and refreshing."
"Drinkability: I could drink these all night. I have in the past and I will continue to. Great drinkability."
"This is certainly not a beer I would drink frequently but it's better than many other options out there."
"Lots of carbonation here. Nothing great but it works for what its trying to be. Pretty refreshing and I have family members who love this stuff so if they were to offer me one of these after mowing their lawn, I doubt I would turn it down. Of course, I wouldn't be the guy to run out and buy this myself."
"I guess you could pound a several without noticing anything but the bad aftertaste."
"Drinkability: It is a beer that is very easy to drink so I tend to grab these for parties because most people will drink them."
"Poured a clear pale yellow with a white head that quickly settled. Smell was sweet but was ruined by a chemical aromas of seltzer and natural hot springs. The taste is doable but less than good. Slightly sweet malts backed by an unnatural-tasting bitterness that I could easily live without. There's something about this beer's smell and taste that evokes images in my mind not of a brewery, but of a chemical plant. This beer does not deserve to be associated with sophisticated taste - it comes up short in every conceivable way."
"Smell and taste both have a bit of sour or bitter tinge to them. Fairly thin beer and nothing impressive about this at all. So many people talk about Heineken and what a good beer is, and I honestly have never been a fan. Often skunky, and even when not, just an average beer I guess. Give me a Coors or Miller Lite anytime over this. Drinkability is good, light, crisp and fairly refreshing."
"D- Very drinkable. Not enough flavor to offend the palate."
"but right now i could drink plenty of these little bastards"
"Pours a clear straw gold with a quickly dissipating head and surprisingly, some lacing. Smells of straw and skunk. Tastes straw, a little bitter, but definitely skunk. Above average carbonation and light mouthfeel, average drinkability. I'll drink it if offered to me, but buy this stuff? No way, especially not at a premium price. Don't buy into the marketing machine."
"*I am drinking both the Heineken and Heineken light simultaneously to gauge the subtle differences between two beers that probably fulfill the same roles in our beer society... identical tawny orange-yellow bodies.... more effervescence in the original; head overfills the Javer pokal and holds to a half-finger head... pingish, metallic malts, as expected... an active (?) early bite that finesses into a soft, bubbly faux champagne finish.... straw malt that lacks an offensice or offensiveness; either way, another green beer meant for mas consumption.... gassy ending doesn't endear... only visiting the brewery itself can softne the otherwise droll rounds this beer makes at backyard barbeques, holiday celebrations, baptisms, birthdays, etc..."
"d: because of its clean taste and light body it goes down easy, but thats what this beer is made for right?"
"Overall: Not bad. I'm usually not into lagers but this is quite drinkable."
"Overall: its time has passed"
"A bright light golden color,with a sudsy white head. Aroma of very faint pine,and maybe lemon grass.Taste starts off bitter and ends sweet,common pale malt and faint lemon grass taste.Lots of carbonation,crisp clean finish,very drinkable but over priced for what it is.Much better from a can than the bottle in my opinion."
"Interestingly enough though, I do really enjoy Heineken Dark..."
"Pretty standard, nothing too special here. Light flavor but it tastes alright with a meal or snacks. Good party beer if you're looking for an easy taste that everyone can agree with. Not to go off topic but you might be better off trying Heineken's Dark Lager. It has an overall better taste and won't disappoint."
"Anyway, definitely recommended, if your looking for an easy to drink beer that's crisp & refreshing. Than try Heineken, cheers!"
"This is serviceable. Flavor is okay, but the nose is really pungent and distracting. The feel, especially the aftertaste is a bit of a turn-off as well. It is light, and moderately refreshing I suppose. Okay quaff, I just can't take more than one."
"D- Crisp mouthfeel and overall cleaness make this one pretty drinkable."
"Thin body with a high level of carbonation; Pretty good hop bite but the malt is nearly missing. This beer had me looking for a lawn to mow."
"Easily my beer of choice when I'm stuck with a limited selection (90% of the time in bars)."
"Mouthfeel is light, and carbonation is medium, lending itself to a highly drinkable beer. This beer has a crisp clean finish and has to be one of the most refreshing beers around!!"
"Pours a golden straw colour with a one finger white head that comes down quickly to a fizzy ring. Smells a bit sweet with some spices and a little bit skunky. Initially has a very sweet taste but becomes less and less noticable as you keep drinking. Carbonation is decent, pretty straight forward lager but without the skunk. Has a little bit of a funky bitter after taste. Over all, this beer is really easy to drink but I prefer it in the mini keg more than anything else. I would rather knock a couple back at a party than sit down and enjoy one."
"obviously a decently drinkable beer, just a 'crowd pleaser' type of brew, where the flavor is so understated a typical pallate will eat it up."
"D - I'd give it a higher score for drinkability, because it goes down like nothing, but the smell turns me off and the flavor isn't good enough to make me want to drink it, so I give it a 3.0"
"3/1/1/1/2 (1.8/5)"
"this beer has flavor and drinkability that can be appreciated."
"With its straw yellow color, lace-less white head, and skunky aroma it behooves me why Heineken is so popular. Everybody always makes it sound like you're upper-class/high society if you bring Heineken to a party...those people are stupid. It doesn't taste great, nothing exciting about it, just a typical boring lager. I say either lower the price or it's not worth it. I guess they market the hell out of those keg cans."
"(rated Jul 30, 2008)"
"D= Not bad on draft as it is blessedly free of the skunkiness usually found in the bottle."
"After having time off the grof due to an Op, my palate seems to have changed to enjoying less 'strong' beers...I am actually enjoying the refreshing taste of lagers (Gawd I hope this changes ;-)"
"Still though, its not all that bad. A brew I will never turn down if offered. At least its decently drinkable"
"Out of the awesome 24 oz. keg can. That thing can withstand nuclear winter Pour: dark yellow pee, with a huge white head. Aroma: skunky pee and sugar water. Why does Heineken smell so awful? Taste: Surprisingly pee-free. Good flavor of pale malt and sweet hops Better than most macros."
"From the keg, the beer is on par with Stella and Kronenburg. Not bad, just average. For the Heineken reputation, this is good news."
"Poured a golden to straw color, with a white two finger thick head on top. Visible carbonation in the glass. Surprisingly fruity fragrance at first scent, that is followed by bread and yeasty frgrances. It finishes with a metallic scent. The taste starts with the bread and yeasty characteristics from the aroma, then a metallic taste comes out midway. It finishes with a bit of a grassy and grapesfruit bitterness. A typical lager in feel, a light to light-medium bodied feel, with a crispness and dryness left on the palate. In the world of macro beers, this is not half bad. The distinctive metal scent and flavor is a bit of a put off, but the fruitiness in both the aroma and taste make up for that short coming. Plus there was no skunkiness that is usually typical found in this beer, which was a surprise."
"I really want to like this beer. I really do. It's one of Grandfather's favorite beers, and a lot of my good friends love it. I just can't. It stinks, and it tastes of stink. Every time I take a sip, I try to concentrate on the piney, hoppy taste that there is, but the skunkiness is so overpowering that I just cannot enjoy it. It's also relatively watered down. There is some taste there, but the drawbacks are so severe to it that I just can't bring myself to enjoy this beer. Somebody recently suggested to try this beer canned to avoid the skunkiness from the green bottle that kills its taste, so I may have to do that. But I think the watery aspect of the beer will keep it from ever being one that I prefer."
"Well, I really have no idea why this is such a popular beer. Anyway onto the review. I've had this many times, out of the bottle, out of the can, and on tap. It is best on tap, but even then I will avoid it at all costs. Nice golden yellow color, with a one inch frothy head. Smells cardboardy, and a bit stale, and a bit grainy. Not good. Taste, this is just brutal in my opinion. I just dont like it. Goes down rough, with a bit of hoppy bitterness, then leaves that typical euro lager after taste. Just bad. Mouthfeel is full, about the best thing going for this beer. Drinkability, i just cant enjoy this beer, ice cold, or what ever temperature I just dont enjoy this one."
"Overall this beer is just what it's advertised as, easy to drink but nothing special."
"Drinkability is pretty high considering the price and how a lot of people seem to enjoy this one, but the taste would grate on me after awhile."
"When all is said and done, this is not a beer I will purchase again, however if I'm offered one at a social gathering I won't turn it down."
"Better than Red Stripe and some other lagers though. This beer may sponsor the champions league but is certainly not the champion of beer."
"Pours a golden yellow colored body, with a nice big white head, lastingish. Doesn't have much aroma to it. A slightly malty, taste. Smooth mouthfeel. Grainy. Somewhat watery. Not too bad considering the bashing this one seems to get, at least from my friends."
"Has a light, golden color to it and is extremely carbonated. The taste is somewhat metallic, but certainly not too much, because it is very drinkable. This is definitely the kind of beer you can throw in the same category with the Budweiser's and Beck's of the world."
"Drinkability: Not that I couldn't drink this but for what it is i expected more from it."
"Drinkabiliy: For what it is, it's drinkable, I can defintley quaff a few of these in under an hour, yet this beer is in no way a stand out at all. It lacks in the smell and taste department but it seems like something that can be fixed. If your looking for something similar in style, try a Beck's instead, it's a cleaner taste and more appealing."
"Drinkability is not bad. This is an ok lager. I like this beer a lot more on tap, but in a bottle it's not a bad beer... it's a bit funky smelling, but it's kind of refreshing, and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is the beer to go to in a non-beer restaurant, as it's always the ""quality"" import on their beer menus. However, even these types of places are trending towards better beer, and most have either one solid local or at least Sierra Nevada PA or SA's Boston Lager. This is one I haven't had now in over a year (since getting in to ""good"" beer), and it's sort of amazing how bad I find it now, compared to what I think I USED to think of it, heh. That being said, it's not undrinkable - the abv% is low, and while the cornyness/extract-like tastes and aromas are sort of offputting, they're not unbearable."
"This rating is for Heineken lager I drank on tap at the KLM lounge in Schiphol airport, although I had this beer many times in the Netherlands. I know it has a weak reputation, but dammit I like this beer. It's smell when fresh is really good, nice clean malty aromas. A solid choice when only macro lagers are available."
"This beer pours a clear pale golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of skunk, but that is what they are going for. The taste is as skunky as the aroma with only a faint hint of malt. The mouthfeel is thin and watery. Overall, this is a horrible beer. I don't understand how someone can drink this, and I most certainly won't be again."
"The taste is light and a bit minerally, but with a pleasant character of faint grain and light herbal hops. It's inoffensive and very easy to drink, staying at least mildly interesting and pleasant. Compared to one of its big rivals for the same market/niche, Stella Artois, it seems to be largely similar but with less hop flavour or bitterness."
"drinkability: Easy drinking beer and when there's little choices at the bar I can always count on it being there."
"Had this on tap recently after being given a choice of Coors Light or Bud. The color is a deep amber with a white fluffy head. Smells that distinctive Heineken smell of pine and herbs. The taste is significantly better on tap than from the bottle. A sharp malty herbal bitterness with a respectable slice of citrus in there, along with the usual Heinie pine flavor. But the flavor doesn't seem as thin after a few swigs the way it does from the bottle. Surprisingly drinkable."
"Can't help but think this one's living on its reputation from days of yore (OK, check off the ""chokehold on the blatantly obvious"" box). This was not enjoyable to me."
"D- Honestly not too bad for a major brand, just beware of the green bottles(in most cases I've had it from a mini-keg)."
"Man, even before I appreciated ANY craft beer... and I liked BMC with miller lite my favorite of over bud light (LOL) and thought becks was something special (Double LOL) ... I HATED THIS BEER...and still do obviously. But dammit someone brought it over and it's all that's left. So here's my review. If you haven't tried heineken;.. don't./"
"I would drink it if it were less expensive, or free."
"Not great for the style though. Try a Stella Artois, its a better version of this style."
"I poured a 12 ounce can into my SA pint glass. It pours a pale urine color yellow with an abundant head. On the nose it is slightlty sweet, no scent of hops. On the tongue sweet with a slight bitter finish. It is thin bodied with decent carbonation. The beer goes down like water. This beer is a typical mass produced lager-easy drinking and nonoffensive."
"lightish-bodied pilsner type (uhemm euro pale lager brew."
"Drinkability is low for me. I had a hard time finishing one and I can't drink another. Just not my thing."
"Drinkability - For those who like it, it may be high. But to me, this one is a drain pour!"
"Very drinkable and thirst quenching. Far superior to any U.S. pale lager."
"M & D: About the only good quality to the canned version, is that it is smooth and goes down easily."
"Tastes better out of a bottle. Had a blah smell like alot of euro lager. It tasted like a bitter herby lager. The color was simmillar to honey with a white head. Taste was light, not impressive not memorable but not making me want to spit is out either. It felt in the mouth a little seltzery, Not an overly drinkable beer."
"This big seller is not a very big beer. It is a rather typical looking lighter lager with pale gold color and almost no head. What little head might be coaxed with turbulent pouring dissipates rapidly, leaving no aesthetic tracings on the glass. The nose is weak, but with a slightly sweet malt aroma. The taste is almost purely malt with a grainy character and very slight bitterness on the finish. Nicely carbonated Average mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Poured off the tap a pale yellow color with a white cap. Poor retention but somer lacing. Assorted macro grains in the nose with some clear lager yeast and hops notes. The flavors were pretty standard, corn mash, some yeast and a semi-sweet malt finish. Medium body and lighter carbonation makes it smooth. Old men tend to think this is a classy beer to drink. That's because it is a good beer for a macro and before the rebirth of micro/craft brewing it was near the top of the line. These days however it is a merely a mediocre lager that reminds me of a pilsner. Save your money for a real beer."
"Impeccably tasty, seriously good. I fully expected Heineken to be crappy like so many other ""cheap beer""s. I am delightfully surprised to see that Heineken now challenges the position of Beck's as being my favorite no-brainer beer. Next time I'm out I'm totally going to Heineken Light to see what it can do for me."
"Never really liked this one. Pale color with some malt and some of that corn/rice/grain mix and a little bitterness. There's probably a little more flavor than some other mass marketed swill. I think the problem is I've had way too many skunked bottles of this. Even fresh one's seem a bit skunky."
"Mouthfeel is not too bad for this type of lager, has some substance but is very refreshing. Honestly the carbonation is very pleasing."
"The beer has an almost flourecent-like yellow color with a small head that fades before you can blink. The smell is only of unroasted malt...it has absolutely no depth. The taste is similar but with a touch of butteryness. Has an overall poor taste. Sorry, but there is not much more that I can write."
"A good sunny day beer. Some light food might go well as not to overpower. Good to quench your thirst. A small hope in a macro world."
"I recently bought a six pack of Heineken and was down to the last one when I realized that I haven't rated this yet. Pours from the familiar 12 oz. green bottle a pale yellow with a half inch white head. The head vanishes immediately, leaving a modest collar. It's quite fizzy, as expected. The aroma is lightly hoppy, with some corn and a slight hint of skunk (the Curse of the Green Bottle strikes again!!) 1st sip is dry, with some corny maltiness that gives way to a lemony, metallic bitterness on the swallow, as if low grade Saaz hops were used in the brewing process. Mouthfeel is light & crisp. Drinkability is ok...I used to go through a few of these in a session im my macro days, when this was somewhat of a ""status"" beer. It's better than BMC, but not on a level with any craftbrew. I'll take it if it's the best option available...as it was when I purchased the sixer...but I won't seek it out by any means."
"Caveat: The Pink Taco at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas is the only bar I've come across that does not sell Heineken. I'm sure there are many others."
"HV"
"Most people (non BAs) fame this to be an amazing beer but I thought that it was the exact opposite. I definitely will not be drinking this one again."
"heineken seems to be the most drinkable of the common beers popular in America. Obviously the pour and look are barely noticable for anything, like the rest of the beer's qualities, but it seems that taste and drinkability-wise it is the least-terrible. Nothing to smell either. The taste, which, again, is fairly similar to most beers popular throughout America, is mostly just wheat-like with only the faintest imaginable trace of hop or barley. The reason it is better than others, at least, is because I'd say it's got a very clean feel to it and it's easy to drink as a lawnmower. The taste isn't really good, but it's not offensive either like, say, doors or bud, etc. That basically sums up the beer. Yeah, you'd never select if you had at least slightly-decent options to pick from, but it's better than the other typical options."
"O. Decent euro lager, for a mass produced brew, its quite decent. A ok option if there are no better choices."
"Poured a pale, straw yellow with a thick white head. Smell was all skunk, as with the taste. Terrible aftertaste of stale cereal grains. Mouthfeel was watery, not much texture but a lot of carbonation. Overall terrible, there was not much enjoyable about this beer."
"Taste is metallic, with slight hops, but smooth enough to drink without unpleasantness. Maybe a tiny touch of sweet maltiness, but not much. Mouthfeel is unexciting. There's a decent amount of carbonation, but this is a very typical, average feeling beer. Overall, well-marketed, but forgettable."
"definately not my favorite beer, but it would suffice if thats all there was, and its better than drinking the bud light the idiot brought in the 30 pk. ..."
"Well carbonated beer pours with some head. Taste is very basic lager but good for a European lager beer. Not much of a aftertaste. Extremely easy to drink."
"the purffict ballance of sour malt and pungent hops, sightly to much carbonationin this one. this is an easey drinking beer. it pours a clear golden yellow with a good head to it. the first sip has you coming back for more. this is the top shelf of euro lagers"
"Mouthfeel was medium in density and somewhat syrupy. Smooth with enough carbonation to keep it interesting."
"Although highly overrated and definately overpriced Heineken is still a solid all around european lager. I have always enjoyed drinking a few of these (especially if somebody else is picking up the tab). I don't know why but I am drawn to the ""skunky"" qualities that this beer has become known for."
"Wow. Seriously. I am surprised as hell that I am liking this so much."
"I just had this for the first time on-tap instead of from a bottle. Every bottle has had a skunky flavor, so I figured that was how it was supposed to taste, but now I'm pretty sure that sunlight had just gotten to every bottle I've had and skunked them. This one wasn't skunky at all- more of a corn flavor, that is, what flavor there was. Not much to it at all. It was so bland that the skunky flavor of a bad bottle is preferred to what it's ""supposed"" to taste like."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Well, as stated earlier; pretty over-rated. It is a very sweet beer, almost to much for me. I like one on the rare occasion but for the most part I stay clear. If I drink to many of these I also get a headache right after from the sweetness. Drinkability.... so-so, the mix of sweetness to bitterness along with carbonation isn't anything to rave about.... Still worth a try if you have never had one, like I say I like to have one on occasion, but nothing I want to have every day of the week!"
"M + D: It's been a while since I've had a Heineken, but this can wasn't all too bad. A bit of a sting of assertive carbonation as many of the style will have. Easy to swig back, as expected. One to keep a bit cooler, but I could manage to quaff a few of these on a hot afternoon."
"Pours a very clear and light straw color with a white soapy head that quickly dissipated into nothing. The aroma is of stale grassy hops and a cracker malt, sweet grain, sulfur, and cooked veggies. The taste is quite grainy and plenty of DMS, some pilsner characteristics makes the taste a notch above macros. It has noticable, though stale, hops and a dry cracker like malt. The feel is light and watery, decent carbonation, finishes with a light grainy sweetness that gets a little sticky as it warms. Leaves kind of a nasty grain aftertaste. An ok beer if it is left over from a party and you need something light. A notch above the American macro."
"Drinkability: I would look for this at a party that had all macros."
"Overall, its a lawn mower beer. I just washed my car while drinking the one before this. Its a Sunday Chore beer. Something to keep you grounded while you do the usual yard work, cleaning, etc etc."
"D- easy to put down but i fyou like good beer this isnt for you. those of you who enjoy bud light and bud this might be a good beer for you to have."
"D - Extremely drinkable, if you like it ok. Easy to session, but as a sidenote; not that interesting in itself. Will buy a can every now-and-then for the fridge, may order it when put in a place where it's the best option."
"I just didn't like this one."
"D: This beer does not deserve to be the second best selling imported beer in the US. If other breweries had the money to spend the money on adervts they could easily subplant this brewery as one of the most popular in the country. Pretty easy to drink and just as easily forgotten."
"It would be a better lager if it had a little more body and lessened the sour aftertaste."
"Not a very complex beer, still it is clean, a little crisp and quite gulpable. I have had worse lagers."
"The pour resulted in a beautiful, thick, creamy two fingers' worth of marshmallow-like head with great retention. It looked like a pillow on top of the pale-yellow beer with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a slightly honey-like quality that has always been their trademark with me. Mouthfeel was medium with a lightly honey-like taste in the mouth. Finish was light, sweetish, very much a lager. Not bad, but with so many quality beers available now, why bother?"
"Overall: Promising appearance in the glass is let down by harsh, off-putting astringent characteristics."
"D: A lot of my friends would buy Heineken when they wanted to drink ""good beer", but I can't really agree with that assessment. It's just barely above average at best. While there's nothing wrong with it, and it's not difficult to drink, some of the flavors, especially the metallic ones, seem less than desirable."
"D: Drinkable although there are definite better lager options. In many establishments where this is the only import option I would not be opposed."
"Notes: My father loves this beer,but I have to write it like it is. The beer is mediocre and I can understand that one could get used to this beer yet this is just not for me. Still not the worst beer ever and tolerable to drink."
"OVERALL - 3.4"
"A very good example of the style. I'm growing less and less fond of Euro Pale Lagers, but I'd like to find one that's really good. A refreshing beer and better than some other EPL's out there, but still just unimpressive and uninteresting."
"D - Overall it's not a terrible beer, but that late palate/finish weird-fuck taste is really bothering me."
"If you haven't tried a Heineken Mini Keg or on tap Heineken you haven't tried Heineken!"
"I agree that the flavor is a little weak, but the skunk smell fades as the beer warms, like a couple other beers I have tried."
"Used to drink this in high school but not so much anymore. I only drank this one for the purpose of review."
"mouthfeel is decent, not too watery, not too thick, goes down smooth and could definitly continue on these babies if you like flavor-less brews. if this was super cheap I might even buy one again. well, too bad."
"Pours the same light straw color. Poor carbonation as well, head fizzles out quickly. Smells of mild spicy noble hops with a noticable amount of skunk. Skunk mellows as head settles, cat urine becomes more prominent. Light crisp mouth feel. Some hops tingle the tongue. The minimal malt sweetness that was noticable from the can is more of a toasted graininess. Perhaps since the hops are out of whack the malts become more prominent. This beer may benefit from swigging straight out of the bottle (gasp!)."
"Just casually offhand analyzing other reviewers' experiences with this beer, it seems drafts and cans are consistently better-reviewed than bottles. It leaves me thinking it isn't Heineken's brewing process that is at issue with the oft-mentioned funky skunkiness, but their poor choice of green-bottled packaging."
"Heineken does a nice marketing job, but needs to tweak their brewing methods a bit. This stuff pours a clear yellow color and has a fizzy white head. The nose is of bitter grassy hops and stale malt. The flavor is bitter and unenjoyable. Extra light yet heavily carbonated body."
"drinkability- as a mass produced lager goes this is ok. like i said if forced or choosing to drink do it extra cold."
"Had it right from the bottle. A very drinkable macro, with a lot more flavor than many other (American) macros. Like others, however, it's best very cold. On a side note, I was amused when I ordered a ""hiney"" and the bartender had no clue what I was talking about. Made me sorta chuckle."
"D: Just about anything is drinkable for me, I could drink it at a wedding, maybe a bar-b-que, but I wouldn't purchase a six pack just to have on a Friday night."
"Drinkability- Heineken is a very drinkable beer. It's light and tasty. It's at least more interesting than most American lagers."
"I tasted this alongside a bottle of Miller Genuine Draft, and the Heino wins! But pretty average euro lager fare."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't drink this again if I had the choice but I am glad that I was able to at least try it. As far as I can tell this tends to get lumped in with the whole Budweiser-Miller-Coors party beer conglomerate so out of those I'd have to say that this is probably the best of its competition."
"More enjoyable in the bottle so leave it in there."
"D- This is one of my favorite session brews, mainly because its widely available, and much better IMO then the macros usually offered alongside it. I'd say its also a good gateway beyond macros if that's all you've ever drank (which is true for a lot of people, non BAs of course)."
"D- Heineken is that beer that is one step above the BMCs but not really a micro or craft brew at all. I think it gets a lot of flack but on the whole, if the beer isn't skuned from the green bottles, it is not that bad especially for the style. It is one of those beers that if you are out and the place doens't have any micros then I'd go for a Heinken, especially with seafood or other lighter fare. Actually reminds me a bit of a lighter flavor Pilsner Urqell."
"D: OK, but nothing special. I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered to me, but I wouldn't go out and buy it."
"I don't know why this beer is popular (marketing, I guess) as it offers very little. It has a displeasing aroma, no body, and odd flavor. It's light enough and not so offensive that it wouldn't be any trouble to drink a few of these in a sitting, however."
"Had Heiny again while doing taxes with my accountant (4/8/08) and it was much better. Crisp, somewhat clovey, bitter taste with no strange smell. I think that what I got at the trade show (above) had gone skunky. I upgraded my smell and drinkability ratings somewhat as a result."
"Taste is bitter and mouthfell is carbonated to me. I have always thought that the taste and smell of this beer is what sets it apart from the BMC crew. During my teen years, the green bottle beers from Europe and Canada were definitely a step up, but I dont think these beers measure up to most of the craft brews being produced domestically. If I am out at a bar and buying a beer I am probably buying a Yuengling. If I am picking up a case for $25-$30 at my distributor I am buying Victory or Sam Adams not Heineken."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol and lack of flavor makes for easy consumption, however overall blandness does not encourage you to do so."
"D: You could have another...or you could go with any of a thousand other and better beers. Two thumbs down."
"Straw color, thin fizzy head; par for the course in as a standard macro lager. Sugery sweet smell of bananna nut bread. Taste is of that, along with an grassy, acrid overtone and an omnipresent, cloying sweetness, which becomes too much before too long."
"What the hell? I was not expecting this at all. I guess others' testimonials on this brew are a load of garbage. I was not impressed, and most likely won't bother with it again. There's better and cheaper beer out there."
"This beer has a light and refreshing feel to it. A decent summer lager, i suppose. The taste is a little less complex than i would like for as much as it costs. Would make a decent session beverage, but, again, it's a bit more than i prefer to pay. Still, it's not a bad beer, but for lagers, you can do better (and cheaper) just getting a domestic brew."
"Aftertaste is back to sulfer and sweetness."
"So I guess the real answer is that it bores me. Not bad, not stinky, not skunky, just boring."
"Heineken pours a light straw color with a one finger white head. The head fades quickly and there is no lacing down the glass. True to a lager though, it is crystal clear. The smell is very earthy and I detect subtle hints of corn. The taste is clean but has a disturbing adjunct taste I would expect in much lower priced beers. The lager yeast presence is noticeable which is a plus and the aftertaste is mild like a lager. The mouthfeel is average, it is not watery thin but lacks good body; just average. Heineken is very drinkable at 5% abv and goes down smooth with no poor aftertaste. Overall, if you're out at a swill bar and this is the top of their line you will still have a decent night of beer if you're out to session drink. The next day may be a different story..."
"The skunky and sour tastes may ruin it a bit, but it's actually a pretty crisp beer."
"Descent enough lawnmower beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. It's refreshing for what it's worth. Not as bad as I was expecting."
"D: Fairly easy to drink. It's below average for an import, I'd rather buy a cheaper domestic."
"Drinkability - Okay in a pinch."
"Poured a 22 oz bomber bottle into a flute glass because my Pils was chipped. Poured and left a decent size head that quickly faded w/ no lacings on top of a yellowish, seethru body. Smell is hoppy and grainy. The taste is hoppy and not much else, but it isn't well balanced and leaves a drying feeling in the mouth and there's not reason to keep drinking this. The beer's popularity is more because of advertising than a high quality product (duh)."
"Not my first pick but sometimes its this or BMC and I will take this over Bud anyday. Pale yellow in color with a white head that quickly disapeared. Smell a little hops not much else. Taste a little hop bitterness and a hint of unplesent sulfer not much of an aftertaste. Drinkability a good choice if your in a bar that might not offer much else."
"D: I never liked this one from the bottle. I recently re-tried this beer (from the can) and am moving it up from my original C- assessment."
"if i am going to buy a lager i usually pick this or budweiser, it just depends on my budget!"
"This is another one of those beers popular popular among the yuppie crowd. It's famous only for being a brand name, not much else. It's essentially a below average imported beer."
"only reviewing the nitro can. The rest is just crap. The nitro can is probably the best way to drink Heineken. Zero skunky flavor. Color is golden straw. He'd is big, but disapates. Little lacing. Flavor is sweeter than the cans, bottles and kegs. Ok finish. I never buy this beer in any form, but when you are at a party and it is this or Bud Light, I will choke it down."
"Tried to make this one fun. . .DraughtKeg (i.e. HeineKeg) for POWER HOUR! No smell out of the Keg. Small frothy white head. Actually pretty fair lacing all things considered. Clear light yellow color. Taste is corn and faint skunk. Well it goes down well if taken one shot at a time for powerhour. Light, watery, fizzy, and metallic are the four things you need to know."
"Notice the serving temperature and enjoy!"
"D: Drinkable but many other readily available macro lagers beat it by a long shot."
"Nothing horrible going on here, but that said, nothing good or exciting. Not going to finish this one. Below average and boring."
"Overall, a good macro-ish beer. Tends to be on the sweet side, but there is enough acid and bitterness at the end to offer some balance. Not much malts going on, and hops are bare. However, the fruit forward tone of this beer makes a nice refreshing summer beer. Solid everyday beer, but not great."
"All the intangibles are there for this style, but the flavor and aroma are crap, this may be the worst beer I have ever had."
"drinkability - I never liked dark beers, and my taste buds changed to like dark beers. So I thought its been a long time since I had a Heiny. Same old stuff. Didn't like it then, same now. I'm sticking with Sam Adams when I go out to eat, I was on the roller coaster ride to try other beers."
"Poured a white head, thin, and it did not last long at all. Smelled a noticeable sweetness of honey, especially as the beer warmed and neared the end, but also a bit of skunkiness. A quick nice bitter bite to the aftertaste. Overall, this wasnt as watery tasting as some pale lagers, and had a decent enough flavor."
"Hey Baby, Get your hands off my Heini---Austin Powers.Poured a clear pale yellow, retention is that of a macro lager and minimal lacing down the glass. Aroma includes sulphur, light grain, and the trademark skunky hop. The flavor leans towards the hops, which is fine. Not much malt flavor, mostly adjunct-light grain and huskiness. The hops are still sulphur-skunky, finish is thin, body is light medium to light, and dry."
"It always bothers me when I ask people what their favourite beer is and they say ""Heineken."" Either they have they too have fallen victim to Heineken's massive marketing budget or they really haven't embraced the opportunity to open their horizons to real quality beers from around the world. Their loss I guess..."
"Appearance is a very light golden with a crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell slight skunk, corny and light grass. Taste is a light bitter sweet that cloys in your mouth. Mouthfeel is light and crisp although I personally wouldn't consider it a session, one 1 pint, 8fl.oz. bottle is good enough for me."
"Not really all that drinkable due to the sweetness. Out of the EPLs, I found Stella much better than this."
"D-Aside from the mouthfeel being so poor, I could see being able to pound these down."
"Heineken Lager is the British Empire of the Pilsner style. The sun never sets on a Heineken! You can get it virtually in any bar, save a few holdouts. Nice and crisp and refreshing, it goes well with most regular foods and does a good job washing it down. Employs a nice yeast that was originally developed by Pasteur for Heineken. A solid C student, but not a lot of character. Hate it or love it, Heineken represents its style consistently."
"This beer is my guilty pleasure. Many people assume that all Heineken is 'skunked'. Sometimes it actually is, but most of the time that strong malty smell and taste is how it's supposed to be. I love hops as much as the next guy, but it isn't the star of the show here. It's a decent example of a Euro pale lager but it really has some character of its own. It's the perfect companion to deep-dish pizza or some Zaxby's style fried chicken."
"For BMC its something that can go down easy when you are smashed. While that's not necessarily a good thing, it makes a difference when its a choice between this and Bud Light, so..."
"Thin fizzy body. It's probably been 10 years since I've had one of these and will hopefully be 10 more."
"If you enjoy the scent of a skunk during spring rut and a taste to match, then this is the lager for you. Otherwise you'd best serve yourself by paying far less and drinking some generic beer."
"This is the only Dutch beer that is very populair in other country's, and as a dutchman, I have no idea why. As far as I know, all the younger people in the eastern part of the Netherlands think it tastes like horsepee, but no one really knows what that tastes like:). It is exceptionally easy to drink... because it drinks like water."
"D- Better than most domestic lagers, Heineken has some subtle flavors and is very easy-to-drink, I would pass on this for just about any other style of craft beer but my options are severely limited while flying Southwest"
"Despite being a popular cultural icon, I was never a particular fan of this brew... always thought it was rather bitter with an uninviting aftertaste which just didn't do it for me... Appearance and smell failed to impress and the taste was just above awful... not for me... the mouthfeel was equally poor and the brew isn't too drinkable... I know many people who just love this beer, but I still can't see why... not a horrible sample, but would never cop this by myself... Not recommended in my opinion..."
"Not too bad. I had heard Heineken in the can was vastly different from the green bottles and those people were right. I don't like the bottled version, but I would definitely drink this at a ball game or while mowing the lawn."
"Drinkability - mild taste therefore can drink loads of them... if you absolutely had to anyway"
"D - Very low drink ability tastes terrible how is this crap trendy I'd rather drink a BMC over this stuff"
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a minimum of bubbly white head that disappears almost immediately. As for smell, I caught the aroma of skunkiness as soon as I opened the bottle, and it got stronger as I was pouring. Now that it's in the glass, all I can really smell is faint skunkiness. Other than that, there's nothing. The taste is clean, slightly hoppy, but no real bitterness, and I can't really make out the hop flavor. It has a very plasticy taste to it as well. Mouthfeel is very watery. Overall, it's sorta drinkable, in the same way McDonalds is edible. It's very similar to beer, only with less of what makes beer good."
"Overall, very average. I would probably buy it again after some time just to remind myself about it but for the price there are lots more interesting things out there."
"With the smoothness, one could drink this all day...if they liked the taste."
"I can only drink this beer when I am on vacation and don't have to wake up early for work the next morning. Heavy, heavy lager taste and a true, and I mean true, hop inclusion. I am wondering if Heineken is really brewed in Holland and then shipped to us. I heard the it was also brewed in Canada and the lable is misleading. Yes, it is brewed in Holland, but the united States gets it from Canada. Is this true?"
"Bold, really good lager, certainly two steps above American macro counterparts such as Budweiser. Pours a nice thick white head atop a light golden body, with decent lacing on the way down the glass. The smell and taste bring a prominent wheat and corn flavor with bold hoppiness. Though the finish was slightly bitter, it didn't detract. Well worth the try, and just as fine on tap."
"You see Heineken's everywhere. The usual green, short bottle. I hate to make comparisons, but Heineken reminds me a lot of Stella. Same European lager, with that same wheat/corn husky taste. Really dry and crisp taste, but goes down real easy. Overall, probably a step up above American lagers in quality, but not on the level of microbrews from anywhere, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Heineken, a beer that will punish you bad flavors if you don't drink it fast and absolutely ice cold. Forget the skunky bottles, instead stick to the cans, draft, or mini-kegs (delivered by robo-chicks)."
"Smell weak and grainy. Taste watery and plain. I'm searching for descriptors here, but there just wasn't that much to it. Mouthfeel was okay, but given the weak taste, it wasn't really supporting anything. I didn't enjoy this, and won't be back to it if I can avoid it."
"D- I felt a little bit sick after a ""holiday 5 pack"" and couldn't go on... I made it past a few though."
"Not a bad beer, not a great beer. This is a vary middle-of-the-road beer. It is better than the BMC's since there actually is some hoppy taste. Back in my youth when I drank mostly mass-produced american swill I thought Heineken was pretty spectacular. Now I rate it as a drinkable average beer."
"Poured a mid golden colour with a fluffy head of about half an inch which quickly disappeared. Smells faintly of yeast and hops A rather mild taste with minimal bitterness and not too high on the fizz. Not overly flavourful though. Is drinkable but not something I'd actively seek out."
"perfectly drinkable in a can or on draft. avoid those dreaded green bottles when you can..."
"D - Not the worst I've had & I guess it's sessionable. There are countless others I'd go to before this."
"D: A decent lager with an odd aroma that will keep me from having it again."
"Drinkability: A great light bodied beer. I feel the canned version is consistently superior to the bottled version."
"I've had this beer plenty of times in the green bottle and many times the beer has been light polluted and skunky. So this time I tried it in that can that looks like a hand-held keg. I think it may have helped. The typical skunkyness is not present. Unfortunately, neither is the hype about the taste that the commercials have us believing. This beer is marketed as a premium import but it's nothing fancy. Simple light gold see-through beer with plain white disappearing head. Smells OK. Light hop and Malted barley scent. Nothing special and nothing jumps out at you. Tastes just how it smells. Slightly better than your usual macrobrew. Light and watery in the mouth but I sure could drink a gob of these if I had to."
"Heineken pours a clear light golden color with a decent head that lasts for a minute or two. The aroma is sweet and grainy with hints of malt and not much else. The flavor is crisp with more of the grainy flavor and a hint of sulfur. There is less malt sweetness than in the aroma. No real hop flavor to speak of but there is a slight bitterness. My only real problem with this beer is that it is priced at the same level as craft beer, but has the flavor of a decent macro. Why waste the energy getting it across the ocean when you can get a similar tasting beer locally."
"Heineken used to taste different 20 years ago than it does today. I think they changed the beer. Out of a magnum can it's OK, a drinkable macro, but not as good as Beck's in the same price point. Heineken is just lacking character, and the hop taste I remember is no longer there."
"This beer is no good. Skunked. It poured a light piss colored yellow that smelled alot like, well, a skunk. The taste was not much better as it was pretty skunked. This is not the first Heineken I've had, just the latest. They all have tasted the same. Skunked. Don't drink this beer or let people fool you into thinking this is a good beer. In all my years, I have never had a fresh tasting Heineken, all have been skunked. Maybe it's better in Holland, but until I get to Holland, this is all I can get my hands on."
"Anyways, Ive had quite a few of these in my day. Ranging from a decent, average beer, to a beer so skunked I have to quickly choke it down so I can get on to the next one. Its always a simple yellow/golden color, a tad on the fizzy side, with very little head retention. Easy to drink when tried on-tap, but still not that great of a beer. This one is more of a marketing success than a brewing success. I'd suggest trying it on-tap, but where I'm from if a place actually has heineken on-tap, they probably also have something better available."
"This one came in a 500 ml tall can,and i must say i enjoyed this one a lot more than the one in the green bottle.Straw yellow clear color with a bubbly white head and little retention and mild lacing.Nose had no skunk to it at all,not like the bottled version,musty grass aroma along with grains and mild floral greets the nose,taste is a little bitter and tartiness at the same time,grass and grains comes thru,goes down thin with some carbs bubbling in there,easy to drink,not a bad beer,quite refreshing too."
"I know this review is going to seem atypical from the majority(bottles), but I felt compelled after I was pleasantly surprised by the actual quality of the beer when it isn't full of impurities. I will buy the kegged version again...The bottles...not so much."
"D - Decent, although I suspect too many would give me heart burn. All in all not a bad beer, I'd drink it if it came at domestic pricing."
"Fairly light in all respects. Smooth...not hoppy (which is ok by me)...and quite sweet. The aftertaste was almost ""candy-like""...not exactly my favorite quality in a beer's aftertaste, but inoffensive nonetheless. Drinkable because it's not too heavy, and again, it's smooth. Worth a try if you've never had it...but I'm pretty sure it won't be your favorite...and not really worth going out of your way to get. Decent macro lager, though. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, there's almost always something else that I would pick over this beer no matter where I've been. There's nothing endearing about this beer that would make me want to drink it."
"overall, much blander of a beer than i expected because of its popularity...although bud is popular go figure"
"Vito says, ""You might dig Heineken. But more than likely, you'll conclude that Heineken isn't worth the money. Decide for yourself!"""
"While certainly not the greatest European lager in the world I do enjoy a Heineken from time to time usually with pizza or wings, or at a restaurant when it's the best option. I'll be sticking to bottles or tap however."
"You can get better for the price since it is an import. But it is superior to a bud or coors or that kind of swill."
"The color is about average for a lager - golden-yellow and clear. Aroma is malty and not strong or complex. Flavor is crisp and refreshing, malty with just a touch of hop edge, nothing special but not awful either. It goes down smoothly and easily. An OK beer, acceptable if nothing better is available."
"In my younger days I thought this was a really good beer. A pale yellow color, pretty carbonated. Faint grain (corn) aroma. Virtually no taste. Somewhat refreshing, but then, so is water. No mystique to this beer. It probably is a better entry-level beer than Bud or Miller, but not one I'd want to drink regularly."
"I don't know why so many people go out for this beer..I think it's just a trendy thing to do to like Heinie's...I found this beer to be very lacking in anything substantive..it was a little over carbonated and had a bad after taste..I didn't enjoy it that much at all..I had several during this wedding reception I was at because it was this or bud light (I don't think so). After 2 of these I switched to wine. The only thing positive that I can say is that it was thrist quenching in the hotter part of the day"
"A familiar green bottle pours a pale, clear straw colour with a tall foamy white head that settled soon after. Some decent lacing remains. Not much carbonation. Smell of a damp basement, old socks, but not offensive. Is that a hop odour in there somewhere? The taste is mildly hoppy, tart and sharp mouthfeel. There is a dry, refreshing finish that is altogether too abrupt, gives a cleansing sensation in the aftertaste. A bit astringent at times. A long time favourite with many beer drinkers on the pub circuit, this is a short, sharp break from routine drafts but not too many people with alternatives would choose to drink this all night."
"D-I could drink a few of these, all the time. It felt good to get away from the traditional American beers. Plus when your drinking a Heineken, people tend to notice. Not that Im a showboat, but some people make comments."
"Heard the beer at the brewery in Amsterdam is one hundred times better but they only let you have about four ounces"
"When I see this listed at premium prices I want to vomit. Truly a nasty, foul brew that if you put in a more noteable U.S. macrobrew label would be fairly undistinguishable. The taste is bereft of any hops, myabe a hint of malt backbone...just dreadful."
"Bottom line: it's not horrible. It's a good lawnmowing beer, and it does contain hops, which I can't definitively say for some of its macro-competition. Best of the swill in my book."
"Overall: A mediocre Euro-lager. If I were to drink this on a regular basis, Id definitely buy the mini-keg. Its handy and easy to use, and keeps the beer fresh. Heineken is nothing special, but theyre on to something with the mini-keg. (Anyone remember Coors beer balls?)"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability : Easy-to-drink beer, nice one,overprice maybe. The 7 onz bottle have good and bad things, good - It would be cold 'till the end and bad - two sips and is over."
"Pours a very clear, very pale golden color. Two finger, short lived head with no lacing on the glass. Actually very fizzy looking, as carbonation is very noticeable in the glass. Aroma is a bit lacking. Not the typical skunk smell from out of the bottle (due to the green bottle letting UV light effect the hop isomers, creating a skunky flavor - I hear they now purposely expose the beer to UV in order to expedite this process, but it may be untrue). Smells malty with very little hop aroma. Tastes like it smells, but watered down. However, I like this aspect. Along with the fizzy, thin mouthfeel, I think this is a great brew to drink on a hot summer day. Perfect for this heatwave in SoCal."
"It's been a while since I have had this beer. But from what I remember i enjoyed this beer. it was a pale golden color, with a bit of a hoppy taste and smell. All in all it was a good beer, but like I said i haven't had it in a while and I would probably want to try it agian just to be 100% sure."
"Aroma is of grain and skunk. Taste is crisp with grain followed by some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin with a lot of carbonation. I can see why people would drink this, but I won't be drinking it too frequently. It is very drinkable. Light, can be refreshing, and might be one of the better beers available in some bars. Thankfully I haven't been to a bar that Heineken was the best available."
"Over-rated because it was one of the first widely available imports and was better than Miller and Bud. Better on tap than in bottles as bottles do often attain a skunkiness. Thin mouthfeel and fairly high carbonation. Not much aroma except for skunk when in a bottle. Pours yellow with head that doesnt last long."
"On tap, served in a 23oz lager glass. This pale lager poured a crystal clear golden color with visible carbonation running up the sides of the glass. A small off-white head dissappeared almost immediately. The aroma of this beer consisted of grain, sweet malts, and some skunky hoppiness. I was a bit surprised to find the fairly strong skunkiness since this was not a bottle. The flavor was mildly dry and bitter, with a faint lingering skunky aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and heavily carbonated. Decent enough."
"Pours a light yellow color with a nice amount of foam. Aroma is sweet, crisp and malty, dare I say a tad bit fruity. Taste is much of the same with the sweetness and crispness shining through. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter/dry. Not too bad. Goes down easy. Still a whole lot better than most American macro lagers."
"Drinkability is something to be desired though when cold it is quite refreshing and I imagine would go marvelously with a dog or some wings. All in all, this reminds me of a standard ""party lager"" to be consumed in vast quantities by people who don't care much about what kind of beer they drink."
"Pours a clear, light yellow color with decent head, retention and little lacing (poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass). Has a slight malty, grainy aroma. Some corn, little hops. Not an incredibly tasty beer, but I blame much of this on the style itself. Malted corn taste to is, mixed with alcohol and some hops. Has a light mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, an alrigh good beer considering the style, although lighter. Check it out if you're into it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- After a horrific piranha-like attack on the tongue, the beer eventually smooths out and becomes pleasant in the mouth. Overall, a weak and fake selection even on a hot day."
"D- if every heineken were like this one, i'd give it a 3.5. otherwise, 2.5. this is hot weather beer in my opinion, i would not drink it in the winter."
"Poured from the green bottle into a glass tumbler at a friend's place. Served very cold. Light/pale golden color with a skinny, thin head. Some lacing. I approached it objectively, but it still had the usual ""skunky"" aroma that Heineken is known for. Lightly carbonated. Detected a slight grain and hop aroma. The flavor was lightly bitter with a slight malt flavor and a touch of toasted/overcooked grain, which eventually smoothed out and left a very dry, ""cotton mouth"" feel when complete. Heineken is not very drinkable in my opinion. I didn't want another. I really didn't enjoy it. The smell is a huge turn off and I get ""cotton mouth"". Bummer."
"I'm 30,000 feet in the air, somewhere over Pennsylvania probably, and this beer sucks. But I'm enjoying the hell out of it anyway."
"Pours a straw colored body clear and bubbley that leaves a thin white lace that is stayed only from the carbonation. The aroma is grain, husky, some light fruit esters but really not much going on. The taste is quality, some crisp, citrus like mouthfeel that has a smooth refreshing finish. This beer brings me back to the days when everyone was drinking ""BMC"" and I was drinking my Heineken and Guinness classic beer to go back to but I'm glad I moved on."
"This bottle was either not skunked or I was very thirsty. Poured the typical very light golden/straw yellow. Smell of very slight hops, but I poured vigorously so I could smell it. Smell faded with the head. Very slight taste, bitterness then a quick clean finish. Mouthfeel was like drinking a soda, I don't like soda. I could probably drink more than one, but someone left only one at the house. My first Heineken in many years, nothing objectionable here. But in a way isn't that objectionable? Not much to like either."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a quickly diminishing white head. Clear body with medium carbonation. Hoppy, but not very strong smell. Doesn't really taste of much, except for a weak taste of malt. Short finish. It has a light body with a very watery mouthfeel. All this combined makes it a pretty uninteresting beer, simply because it doesn't taste of anything."
"D: The skunk really hurts this one. I could get if it was a single bad bottle, but of the 7 or 8 Heines I've had in my life, only one wasn't skunked, and even then it wasn't much of a beer, so I'm reviewing it as is. If I'm ever in the Netherlands, I'd like to try it from the Source, but since I'm in the States, I'll only drink it if there isn't anything else available. This beer is not horrendous if it's in a can, but in a bottle, it's the biggest crapshoot out there."
"The Draft Keg does prevent the light-struck skunkiness that many of the ""green bottle beers"" are notorious for (Beck's is the worst - take away the skunk and nothing remains). What's left is a straw colored beer with a fair amount of head composed of consistently-sized bubbles that smells a bit of Saaz hops and tastes like straw or grass and leaves a sticky film in my mouth. Even from this package, which has to be a high point for this beer, it is still at best mediocre and IMO Pilsner Urquell remains the best of the European green-bottle imports."
"It's been a long time since I've tried a Heineken. Its well-known skunky smell/taste drove me away long ago. On a lark, I grabbed a 24 oz. can to enjoy at the end of a long dayhike. The difference between the canned and bottle versions is striking. The skunkiness so prevalent in the bottled version is gone, making this one enjoyable, highly quaffable brew. Straw colored in the glass, it has a wispy white head that doesn't last. Tea-like hops and grain are balanced but there's not a lot going on there. The taste is slightly sweet, but the tea-like hops are evident as well. One of the few brews better out of a can than in the bottle."
"D - This isn't a bad beer. It works quite well as a lawnmower beer."
"D- not bad, it would make a good session beer as long as you stay away from the bottles."
"The beer has a yellow/champagne color with a 3 finger head (which reduced with no lacing) on a ginger pour. The beer has a skunky hoppy aroma surrounding it, and is followed by a first taste of grain and a very little amount of warmth. Very carbonated. The beer goes down easy, but just has a skunky taste to it and is not very filling."
"D-this just tastes of skunk. Even on tap it tastes like skunk. Why am I even bothering? I guess I have too much time to kill in between flights. This reminds me of what beer used to taste like before I discovered the good stuff."
""
"From my notes 6/5/2007 part of an 11 ($15.10) tour where you get three 250 ml glasses (on-tap) of their lager. Pours one-finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving a very good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Slight hoppy nose, not skunky. Light carbonation and light bodied. Flavor is balanced with hints of sweetness, slight bitter finish. At one of the bars it is served ice cold which killed most of the taste. At the Heineken Brewery Amsterdam, NL."
"This is a great session beer, as well as a good one to win one over, then to imports on to craft beer."
"Heineken is a beer that I expected more from. With it's place among the classic beer of the world secure, let's get down to the review. The colour is a straw gold colour that it representative of so many North American style lagers. The aroma is slightly hoppy and not too overpowering. The taste is pretty mild with nothing to really distinguish it from anything else. Not a bad beer, but it isn't a favourite of mine either."
" A crowd pleaser, and generally drinkable."
"D: I could drink multiples. Not quite a session beer, but I would grab one of these on a hot day, and it was the best alternative. All snobbiness aside, not bad."
"Drinkability: The keg cans are so much better than the bottles it's ridiculous, but they're still not worth the premium price tag."
"Large keg-can. Straw yellow clear body with an inch or so of white head that leaves a fair bit of lacing as it dissipates. Smells sweet with just a hint of hops. Tastes sweet and malty with a hint of hops toward the finish. Fairly drinkable. Fairly full-flavored, though a bit on the sweet side for my taste. Decent for what it is though."
"I bought a keg can with hopes that I would actually try a Heiney without the skunk. Poured a 24oz keg can into a 22oz tall glass. Pours clear with little head and no lace. Nothing if any in the smell department and no shunk (good on the skunk part, so I thought). Next thing I noticed is that the beer is very sweet. I wonder if it needs the skunky flavor to cover the sweetness. Other than sweet nothing comes to mind to discuss. Mouthfeel is light and the finish is sweet. For me, I don't like this at all in a can. Back to the bottle or tap if I have Heineken."
" ~ This beer is usually over priced. However, for the price of the cask, my buddy, Mr. Finnel couldn't go wrong. This is an easy beer to kick back and throw down. As far as being a complex beer for someone really looking for a great brew, look elsewhere."
"D: Smooth, easy-drinking beer, to be expected from a macro. Not bad on a hot day, or if the bar doesn't have a decent craft/import selection."
"The old stand-by here. I'm not a huge fan of lagers but when I want something cold and refreshing, this is where I go. The appearance is almost head-less, crystal clear, yellow. The smell and taste are skunky with no hint of hop. The mouthfeel is weak similar to others in class. The drinkabilty is awesome. This is my choice for session. Love it."
"This is truly overrated European beer and the Dutch could do so much better. The smell is skunk, the head is light and leaves an ugly ring in the glass. The taste is bland and uninteresting. This could be one of the worst beers coming from such a wonderful beer-centric part of Europe. It is too bad. This is the beer that you see at bars and package stores that have no selection, and at weddings where you have choice between Budweiser, Miller Lite, Amstel, and Heineken. They add this crap to the list as though they are appealing to people who know decent beer and have taste. Unfortunately, it's European Budweiser and nothing more. I would no more reach for this than I would a dozen or so other crappy American macro lagers."
"Es una de las cervezas que mas se venden en el mundo, es una cerveza para quitarte la sed y nada mas, su publicidad es muy amplia y patrocina la champions league. Su envase es verde y la etiqueta es de papel en version short neck y en version long neck la etiqueta es de plastico. Hay versiones de 650 ml, 1.5 litros y 3 litros."
"It was drinkable but the taste could turn you off."
"Not a great beer, but would do in a pinch."
"With so many other options out there these days, it will be a long time before I order this beer again."
"this stuff is good only if you don't know any better. hey assholes, the skunk aroma is not intended! or is it? yeah, those green bottles coming from thousands of miles and sitting under the neon lights create the defining charcter of this beer. skunk. man, i used to think that was flavor! this shit is better out of the can if you must drink it. blonde, fizzy, and a little more light malt character than most macros. i don't detect any adjuncts in this beer but it is so light in body, and flavor that maybe i just can't tell. at least from the skunkiness you know there were some hops in this beer at some point. hey, don't i look cool in the club with my heinie? i spent more money on this shit, bitches! come give me some!"
"Overall: a balanced, nice lager. Depending on where I am, I will chose Heineken if I have to pick between this one and a selection of local macro lagers."
"I could drink quite a few of these and be very happy."
"No headache so far."
"Pours a clear yellow with a nice foamy head that lingered until about halfway through drinking. Smells very hoppy, slightly sweet, strongly alcoholic, and with a slight hint of apple. Slightly skunked, started very hoppy and finished crisply and very alcoholic. Overall a pretty decent lager. The alcohol is very easy to taste, sometimes so strong it masked the full power of the hops. Not incredible, but an acceptable session beer and good value and/or fallback."
"D: It's ok.. heavier than their girly beer flavored water, probably good for funnels frat parties and yuppies not really anything to enjoy here cept for a slight buzz"
"Overall, quite drinkable and a good session beer. Fits the style. It was actually better than I expected."
"Very easy to drink, which is probably why so many do, not much daring or adventure in it. Just lift, drink, and swallow. I need a lager with more taste."
" I hate the fact that all the ignorant ""hipsters"" in bars think this is a German beer. It is from Holland. Hell, it even states that on the freakin' bottle. I can't see why this is all that popular. Just goes to show you what a good marketing campaign can accomplish."
"Not a bad beer by any means. It may be one that I thought was the best at a young age but things change and we learn, right? Light color with a thin head that is gone fairly quick. The smell is what many say, skunky. It reminds me of various skunky, funky things and I like it. The smell carries over into the taste and the skunk remains, which isn't quite as good as the smell. Definitely crisp and smooth even still. I could easily find something better for the same price but it's not bad to have a few of these after a hiatus."
"This is an easy to find easy to drink beer. It has a smooth clean taste that goes down easily. However it lacks in depth and has a skunky smell. It is also somewhat pricey for what you are getting. I still enjoy Heineken but for my money id rather get Anchor steam, or SN pale ale. That said its still a good beer to try, its also a good beer if you are new to beer. Its not too aggressive but a good deal better than alot of the other watery options."
"It's great if someone else has already bought it, but at $8.50 a six pack there are many beers that are much higher quality and cost less. Offerings from Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada, and Founder's come to mind."
"Into a pint glass, pours a solid yellow with a good half inch of head that shinks to a thin white film, light lacing in spatters. Aroma is not so bad, classic pale lager with herbal tones. Taste is similar, herbal hops are pretty nice, grains and a little citrus, a respectable mouth to go along with it. I remember hating this beer before, but now here in a controlled environment, not so bad. Not that good, but not that bad."
"Ahh and old stand by when I was younger and hopefully a breath of fresh air is this mess of macros. This had long neen a favorite in my teens years, I want to see if it can stand the test of time. Poured a decent dark yellow, almost to amber color, but no quite there. Smallish white head, faded pretty quick and left a slight lacey film along the top. Lots of visible carbonation, chains of bubbles through the glass.Smell was not at all bad. Decent malt presentation, light grain and bread. A little bit musty, but at least had some character. Taste was crisp clean and refreshing. Very light, with lots of carbonation, very lively feel to it. Taste was a classic lager, very thin but had body, big malts with nothing to really balance. Overall this was the best of the bunch I have tried over the last couple days( check my last couple reviews) and overall was not that bad. I must say that this has actually withstood some scrutiny."
"Pretty average beer but still a nice change from Bud or PBR."
"The taste out of a can is not too skunky at all. It's actually a bit sweet, bready, and non-offensive. It's also watery and fizzy, but I can live with that. Heineken was always one of my least favorite macro Euro beers, but this actually isn't terrible. From now on, when I have to drink Heiny it'll be out of a can."
"This beer poured with a head 1 finger thick and a dark yellow color. This is a good tasting beer that you can keep as a standby, a lot of the ""beer snobs"" won't admit to it because it is a macro, but it is always a good call. Get a 12 pack because six just won't be enough."
"Pours very pale gold with a fine fluffy white head that stood tall for a while. Almost no aroma -- a little hint of grain, that's it. Taste is . . . wow! Was this stuff always this sweet? Is that what the skunkyness was always covering up? A bit of bitterness on the finish, and overall a bit more full bodied than the average Euro macro. But still too sweet."
"D - Higher than expected; it's one of those beers that for some reason gets a lot of hype, but you could drink a bunch of them if you needed to; nothing particularly offensive, but definitely nothing great here"
"areal mass beer, not bad but not for beer connaisseurs. hardly any bitterness! Just an average beer for the masses, not bad but also nothing outstanding. No ""moreness"". I had just one pint, no desire to drink a second one, I rather shifted to GROLSCH afterwards."
"Pours the typical light, super filtered clear, golden color. Maintained a very thick, slighty rocky head. Far longer than a normal Heineken has. A slight malty aroma, and no skunk. A light buttery taste tagged along with the typical euro lager. Also, to me, Heineken has always had that ""skunk"" to it, but this special bottle I could not notice it. I dont know if it was the cork or what, but this beer seems to have aged superbly, especially for as boring a beer as it normally is. I bragg about the champagne bottle being superior to the normal 12 oz one, but my ratings reflect the typical, normal Heineken."
"has a kick to color ratio like no other...I get a lemon zest up front as well...I usually leave this for the masses...not bad with greek food...real cold....i can attest!"
"A refreshing beer served cold. I drink if there is nothing better."
"maybe i haven't been having enough beers lately but for some reason this heineken tastes suprisingly good. decent hop profile makes up for the slightly off smell. the taste is real smooth and definitly not offensive. it doesn't really look that bad in the glass, nice golden hue. it is what it is and you have to keep that in mind. compared to budweiser and the like this is a stand out. but saying that is not saying much."
"Again, this has slid a long way in my book, but still a beer I can enjoy when none of the good stuff is available."
"Mouthfeel isn't anything to brag about. Simple and nice refreshing beer. Actually a good lager."
"There's better stuff out there. Especially from the Dutch."
"Is the green bottle myth true?"
"Poured out of a 24oz. keg can. Color is a clear yellow with a decent white head, not much retention or lacing. Faint aroma of grain. Taste is sweet grain, not too much there pretty clean. Just an average import, although I think the can does keep a the skunkiness out of this beer."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a thick foamy head. The head then very quickly disappears. There was bearly any smell at all maybe just a hint of hops. Taste was very boring and a bit skunky. Best thing I can say about this beer is that it's smooth so at least it goes down quick."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is clear-yellow with a foamy white head. Smell is of corn malt, slightly skunky. Taste is like the nose with a small amount of hops to balance. Beer is light-medium bodied with little carbonation... not a good sign when the best characteristic of a beer is it's mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is drinkable but in my opinion, overated."
"I don't know what all the buzz is about. This beer is no European Pale Ale either. Had a bottle poured into a glass and was looking forward to it until I brought it to my nostrils. It smelled like an American macro: bitter and watered down. It looked like a light beer. yellow with a thin, white head that did not really retain itself throughout the beer. Tasted like an American light beer as well; same with the mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable if you want a light beer, but overall, I was not impressed with this beer at all."
"I've had this from cans, bottles and tap, and I generally don't recommend it in the bottle."
"Definitely have this again... out of the keg only of course."
"I have sinced moved on to other prefered styles. But when I was a teenager (notably as a 16 year-old travelling in Greece), this was one of the first beers that I enjoyed and actually drank for the flavour."
"If it mysteriously appeared in my fridge, I'd drink it. So it's rated ""above sink pour."""
"D - Pretty damn good for your average ubiquitous ""restaurant beer."" Something good to get at the steak house if they don't have any Sam Adams or Guiness (IMO those are the best two beers that you can find anywhere)."
"A classic. Every time I enjoy this lager, I am reminded that it wasn't a commercial juggernaut in America until recently. The aroma is ""skunky", which reminds me I will be enjoying a crisp lager. The flavor is afforementioned, and has a fairly clean finish. Perhaps my review is biased, as this is an old fallback for me. The fact that I keep purchasing is a cue to it's drinkability. This beer is refreshing, if you are looking for consistency in the same old thing: quality."
"Nice pour from the tap, with a short lived but nice carbonated head. A sweet bitterness with characteristics of light grain bread and airy fruits. I liked the smooth flavor, and light body of the beer. It is truely a nice drinkable lager, great for a mild summer afternoon. It has a nice clean after taste, without that characteristic green bottled paleness we see in the US. Overall I have always enjoyed Heineken for what is was, a standard European lager from the Netherlands, imported for it's exotic appeal in the US. After touring the brewery and tasting/reviewing several beers from the source, I have a new opinion of a good solid pure lager, with great history and tradition of brewing excellence, but still with a slightly dismal masproduced lackluster quality to it."
"Overall, its tasty, but a tad too sweet. Drinking this as my ""cheap swill"" bring back good memories of my Canadian youthful days, of when I didnt know any better. Classic in a harmless novice kind of appreciation."
"It's a Heineken."
"Drinkability: Decent - Heineken is a good session beer, not overly filling or dominating."
"D: Pretty good; I think of this beer as a good beer among bad beers. If that makes sense."
"Heineken Lager Beer was a clear yellow color with a white head. The head was medium in size, but within a couple of minutes it fizzeled to a very thin spotty layer. The aroma was grain and hops. The taste was crisp with hops, light malt, and a dry, somewhat bitter finish. The body was medium-light with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was decent. It's a beer that is easy to find and better than your average macro lager."
"Surprisingly, not skunked. Not surprisingly, nothing special. Very pale pour with a thin, fizzy head. Not much to note in the smell other than some notable hops of decent character. The taste is weak and unremarkable. Overly carbonated with a burning sensation in the mouth. Watery enough to give it some decent drinkability."
"I may have gotten a dud, but I think this confirms for me a decision I made years ago. Whether Heineken has grown too big, whether they've changed their formula, or whether my tastes are just different, it's a beer that I grew up on that I don't plan on purchasing for quite awhile. Way too expensive for its own good as well."
"Not the most drinkable beer but could be worse I guess. On a side not it just gets annoying paying money for a beer that always seems to be on the verge of going bad"
"This was out of a party keg and I'm not quite sure what that means for serving type. Anyways, when fresh and not skunked, this isnt too bad a beer. Its inoffensive, light and a bit fruity. Not too much adjunct flavor, but also almost no trace of malt or hops. Easy drinking and I wouldnt refuse a free one, but it'll be a cold day in hell when I pay for one."
"Heineken is one of those beers that make people scratch their heads and wonder....how the hell do they charge me an extra 2 bucks for this. I know, I know, its an import, but come on, except for going down smoother and less bitter than ""the American swill"" theres no recognizable difference. The only beer where I can truly say there is no discernable taste, which i suppose is amazing enough in itself. It's only good quality is its drinkability, its a small step up from water, so its no problem. It smells and looks like piss, so i guess that offsets."
"Pours a little head that stays around for a little while, but eventually dissapears. The color is clearish yellow, very see-through. Smell is euro-lager smell, bitter and lagery. It's sweet and a little mettalic, but the taste doesn't stay around, it goes away. Overall if it was fresh I would think it wouldn't be so bad."
"Pours out pale and lifeless with some head. Smooth and easy to drink I won't argue, but alas this brew is as lifeless a lager as most other major brands available. Does the green bottle skunk flavor actually help Heineken? Perhaps, but it won't help me buy one. But I guess I'd slum for another if it were the only in the fridge as this bottle was.l"
"This beer poured a golden/straw clear color with a thick head that lasted for a minute. The smell is hoppy and a bit skunky. The taste is mild and with noticeable hop flavors. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. Id consider this an easy beer to drink."
"NOt as bad as some others can picture it, but if you compare it with other Dutch beers this is absolutely water, Golden without greenish features and good foam, but that is all, no character no nothing. It worths a¡only for a barbeque with friends where One does not want to get drunk."
"My parents bought a sixpack for an after-party for relatives that attended my wedding...they don't drink, so they weren't really sure what to buy and ended up giving me the remaining 5 bottles. It made for a good sitting-around-so-might-as-well-try-something selection. I'm not trying to knock a macro at all - that's not my style - I just didn't happen to find this very appetizing."
"nice light gold color pours with half inch head which fades fast no lacing at all. smelled a little like cooked cabbage to me. taste is slight hop not over carbonated slightly salty. mouthfeel light but does leave a lingering after taste. very drinkable good for more than two or three definitely a buy again beer."
"As far as drinkability, I can't say anything bad. I would actually drink this, it goes down smooth and the moderate ABV makes it a good candidate for a session. Think I'll go crack another, in fact."
"Flavor and mouthfeel are where Heineken shines. Flavor is sweet and herbal. Dry finish with a nice hop bite. Crispier than fried chicken thats been kept under the heat lamps too long. The mouthfeel is wonderful. Very lively carbonation yet smooth and endlesly drinkable. Even though Frank Booth prefers Pabst Blue Ribbon, this one is a winner in my book."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink, because there is not much too it. The off-odor just puts me off. I know the green bottle has become a trademark, but I don't understand why a beer company would package its product in a container they know will allow it to be damaged. I'll give this a try sometime in a can or on tap."
"Not a bad drop. I found it to be more approachable than its compatriot, Grolsch."
"Clockwork"
"Get my buzz on- maybe"
"Pours a clear, plain yellow with large sudsy bubbles. The head subsides quickly into small tight patches which look like broken icebergs. The smell is rather skunky but some how balanced by clean hops with a small note of lemon. The beer is note very depthy on taste but sure hits the palate high with a strong clean, slightly bitter hop taste. Good taste though, very drinkable."
"Poured from it's 24oz keg can into a pint glass. Pours a clear pale yellow with decent white head that quickly diminishes into a thin lace. Faint lagerish aroma with just a tad bit of grain. Taste is malty with a slight hop finish. I always get an unusual and unpleasant aftertaste from Heineken. Overall, this is a not a very good lager in my opinion especially considering the high price tag."
"Yes I do! It is so I can appreciate proper beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth with fast moving carbonation. Goes down easily and ends up being refreshing. Not a beer I would actively seek out, but I don't mind having it now and again at a party or when it's offered to me. One of the better mass produced euro pale lagers."
"Thus, Heineken is not the greatest tasting beer in the world. However, it is much superior to Macro-crap, and is quite refreshing in warm weather."
"D: The lack of flavor makes it come across like water. But unlike water, this dehydrates you quickly, a real negative."
"Heineken is actually a decent Euro Pale Lager, and one that goes down quite easily."
"D- A good choice when the only brews at the ballgame are of the Lite variety. A good premium lager but average when compared with the crafts brewed locally and the expanding selection coming over from Europe. Can be expensive if the beer store carries this as their only premium offering."
"Poured into my pint glass a straw yellow color with little to no head. Very macro in appearance. Taste was ok at best. The beer had a very average taste that left a skunky finish. Overall not impressed with this one. I would much rather save the money for a higher quality brew."
"Eric"
"Heineken is one of the lager beers I respect. Its very drinkable, and very balanced, even if two out of every sixer is probably skunked. Honestly, it is a very good session beer because it won't offend you or get you ripped like an Aussie. Some say its better from the can, but I say its better from the bottle, and drunk from the bottle. In a glass it just seems way too bland! In a bottle it kinda concentrates the hop presence and carbonation with you throughout the drink. Anyways, the color is typical euro lager, of course, you knew that already. Produces a tall head at first, and leaves some lace here and there depending on how fast you drink it. The smell is fairly bland; of course thats if you dont get a skunked product. Now the taste is pretty balanced, and thats what I like about a Heine! A good part malt and a good part hops. Mouthfeel is decent for a lager, doesn't have a stickiness to it like an ale has and the drinkability is its best part I believe. You can session with this the whole day. They say their beers apply to the RHB, and I cant find any adjunct flavors in it, so Im assuming/hoping its true!"
"Note: Stella Artois is way better and about the same price."
"If you absolutely MUST try Heineken, get it on-tap or in any vessel other than the green, light-inviting bottle. I've sampled it once from a large (I think it was 1.3 liter) bottle in the past, that came boxed..and it was actually not that bad. What I find funny is that some people in this area actually LIKE the skunk taste (after all, they think that's what it's supposed to taste like)...ridiculous. Overpriced and perpetuates the ""Euroskunk"" beer stereotype."
"Opinion: Well, I definitely think that the Heineken is better in a can than in the bottle, and this is simply because it is such a hoppy beer and that they like to use green bottles. This beer is not bad, but it is pretty neutral. It has a dominant hoppy presence, but this doesnt make up for what I assume is the use of adjuncts. Its not a bad beer overall and it goes great with pizza, but I would much rather have a Helles or true Pilsner."
"To me this is basically the average Euro Pale Lager. I put this out there as the one to compare others to as to whether they are better or worse than average. There isn't anything exciting about this beer, but there isn't anything offensive either. Much better in a can (or on-tap) than in a bottle. Don't let it get warm, or it's pretty much undrinkable."
"Sorry. I would prefer any American macro brew to this and I will drink alum for the buzz before I'll drink those so this must be a bad beer."
"Rich toasty flavors, good carbonation, good drinkability. Nice bite of hops with the malt to balance. Not a bad lager but lacks complexity. Many better brews out there that dominate this at the price point."
"pours out of the 12 oz. keg can a very light straw colour; not totally clear and brilliant, but with an active carbonation that produces a thin fine head and slight wisps of lace. aroma is skunkless...a bit malty and a hint of adjunct. there is some floral hoppiness that is nice, also. taste is predominately on the malt side...there is some corny flavours and a pleasant floral hop note as well. it's all pretty tame and lacks the skunky shenanigans of the bottled version. it's a huge difference. a nice euro lager aimed at the masses. drinkability rates higher because the sturdy little keg cans keep the goods cold and fresh. not sure if it's worth the extra $$$ compared to the BMC offerings, but worth a shot every now and again if your aim is to avoid the ""skunk"" green bottles. and the keg cans are kind of cool, too."
"Cheers"
"I remember a distinct period of my life every time I think of or drink this beer. It was seemingly melancholy and the Big Sur coastline and forests seemed like a foggy northwest wilderness painting that one was foisted into with no harp or harpoon to fight off the predatory beasts of self-infliction and natural beauty. And when a large elk-like beast walked near the side of the winding coastline highway and looked like he was the mountain and we were the little knee fence in his way I nearly lost it. Then of course the pint sized bottles cost $5 a piece and the firewood consisting of tinder and oversized and fermenting popsicle sticks perfumed with spray paint wood scent was even more than that and only burned a few hours. Such nostalgia wasted on a so-so beer. I wanted to remember it tasting like the bitter dregs coughed up by the ocean but a recent taste made me realize that it was more like a tapwater beer than a fine nectar."
"D- Ok I guess, could either slam it or sip it, but can't really drink to enjoy"
"Drinkability: I guess since it's more expensive than American macros, shallow people might be impressed if you order one of these instead. Beyond that, hard to think of much use for this."
"The appearance is pale and clear. Its the lightest colored import Ive ever seen. The smell is my least favorite part of this beer. It has the dreaded ""skunk"" smell alluding to the photoreactive damage on the poor beer. The taste makes up some for the smell but has a hint of the skunky taste that the smell has. The mouthfeel has a crisp clean feel and is by far the best part of this brew. I wouldnt recomend this for people with more refined taste but its a good start to get out of the mainstream."
"Enough hyberbole. This beer is overhyped and offers distinction from other green bottles in all the wrong ways."
"I'm not going to have another."
"It's fairly drinkable, but boring. The sulfur tends to stick around, but something about it makes it crisp and it can be refreshing. But, it's not a good beer by any means - and overpriced. I know that it is popular - but wonder why. (Marketing I suppose.)"
"I would consider Heineken a really good session. This is a great import beer that you can find pretty much anywhere. I like the 5 liter mini keg version the best. In bottles it has a bit of a skunky taste to it. The mini kegs and regular kegs seem to loose this skunky taste. The empty keg makes a great lamp. I have one in my fridge today that I plan to get into later on. Good overall beer though."
"I recently bought one of the mini-kegs of Heineken and was very impressed. In the mini-keg the beer lost all of it's usual skunky characteristics and really became a nice drinkable lager. The malty sweetness came through and was backed up nicely by a slight hop bitterness in the finish. If your gonna drink this beer, get it in the keg cans or the mini-keg. It's very fresh and very tasty."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its not real robust in terms of flavor, but I think its a fair representation of the Euro-Lager style. 25 years ago Heineken was he class of beers in the crowd I ran with. Nowadays it seems very average. I dont think Ill have it again."
"Clearly drinkable, but for the price there is so much better out there. I don't really see any occassion where this beer would be called for. Its not the best Euro lager and is over priced."
"So I've never gotten around to actually drinking a Heineken. Finally, due to poor selection, I ordered one of these tonight. I think this beer is probably tastier than lets say Bud...but definatley not so much better that it's worth the extra money. Therefore, I think my first Heineken was probably my last. It's just not good enough to pay extra money for. When I got this beer, the first thing I noticed was the ""skunky"" taste. It went away as I drank a bit longer, but there was definatley something weird about this beer."
"Drinkabilty - this goes down very easy and I could drink several in any one sitting. A pretty good beer."
"Overall: I've heard this beer is much better in Amsterdam, but here is is merly average. If one is bought for you feel free, but this isn't a beer I seek out."
"Better condition than the bottled product"
"Taste is that quite sweet/nutty flavour that I get from a lot of Euro beers, almost all-malt, not much bitterness at all. I think this beer errs on the side of being too sweet and is certainly not well balanced. Very carbonated, slides down easily but that's probably because there's no hop flavour at all to keep this sticking to the mouth or throat. The cheap malt taste is a bit too much as well. This isn't dreadful, but I've had much better."
"Mouthfeel is light and watery, though the carbonation level is not blaringly antagonistic as in some other macro lagers. Finish is mildly slick and leaves a bit of a slick film on the tongue; not appealing. Drinkability is awful: little smell and taste, an unpleasant mouthfeel, about the only thing ""correct"" was the carbonation level. There is little reason to seek out this beer: other, tastier (a bit of an oxymoron) macro lagers exist and are just as easily available."
"Not a great beer, but not a bad one either. The main problem is its price; there are far, far better choices in this price range. Also, it tends to have a different, skunky flavor in those green bottles. Be on the lookout for the keg cans on sale."
"Drinkability is good , a nice lawnmower beer. This is a nice beer when cans are a must."
"End of the history: I'm glad to say that finally the Brazilian edition is pretty close to the original one."
"Pours out to a light yellow with a thin head. The smell is of plastic and hops (faintly). The hops and malts balance out fairly well, although the taste isn't very strong. The hops taste a bit like plastic whish is unpleasant, but it's still drinkable. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and the so is the carbonation, but whatever CO2 is still in there makes it fairly interesting. This is a fairly drinkable beer that I might get again, but I tend to stick to tastier beers. I don't mind drinking this with friends who don't know so much about beer."
"Drinkability: Moderately drinkable. The smell is unappetizing, but if served very cold and with the right food, this would do nicely."
"Decent drinker really. has a nice hop bite at the back. there's something medicinally acidic in the middle here, not sure what it is but it's not welcome. If you swallow fast enough it's not that noticeable though. Also, I know these are listed at 5%, but for some reason I get hammered way quicker with this one than other 5% beers I've had."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a bit of creamyness coupled with loads of carbonation. The beer has an average drinkability if it is cold."
"Overall. not a fan."
"I've had this beer in Monaco and in the States. The beer is really completely different from the one in the states. It has a much more pleasing taste and smell. I've never really been too impressed with a yellow beers appearance, and this was no real difference. For being a mass production beer i feel as though they do a nice job with this one. It's a bit of a bitter beer, which masks the actual sweetness in the after taste of it. A must have if you ever travel over seas. However still not a bad beer here in the states."
"I remember the first time I had a Heineken,I popped off the cap and got hit by that smell of fresh roadkill skunk. I went on to drink it anyway and really liked the taste of it! After a couple of beers I could no longer smell the beer which really makes that much more enjoyable. The taste is above average and it goes down smooth for an imported beer."
"It is a Beer worth having."
"This looks exactly like what it is, a pale lager. Clear golden body under a dense white head. Smells faintly of malt and hops, nothing special. The taste is better than I had remembered, fairly sweet and malty for a pale lager, just a tinge of bitterness that lingers pleasantly for a while. Strong carbonation. I've had so many bad Heinekens from the bottle that I swore off drinking them forever. But this keg-can stuff is a better representation of what they are trying to accomplish."
"Poured a clear yellowish-straw color with a head of about an inch that dissipated to a thin lace. Smell is of light maltiness , tinge of hallertauer like hop and alchohol aromas , and slight bit of light struck skunk. Taste is on the lighter , bitter side , with some slight grain and grassy hop , also some more light-struck qualites. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall not a bad Euro lager. I find it to be more drinkable than many mass produced beers out there. Much better on tap as well."
"Cheers!"
"As it was a scorching Saturday afternoon, the nice mouthfeel and drinkability were a pleasant surprise. Sometimes you don't want a monster beer but something that will slake the thirst. This did it nicely on this day..."
"The taste is classic Euro Pale lager. Nice, simple. A little on the watery side. There are better examples out there."
"Lighter, hazy yellow in color with a medium white head. Moderate lacing around the glass. Aroma is skunky at first but also a bit grainy and prickly to the nose. Taste is quite similar. Husks from the grains provide a majority of the malt. Not really astringent and not sweet either. A mineral water taste rides with the malts and I keep getting the taste the whole way through. The skunk from the hops comes at the back end at full force. Quite grassy are the hops and not really too bitter. This is flavorful enough but I just didn't really enjoy the flavors too much."
"I nearly loathe this style. I haven't had one yet that I would actually consider good. But of the one's I've had, this has come the closest. At a friend's house, where the choice is this, Corona, or a BMC product, I'm probably picking this."
"This isn't something I rush out to buy, but would accept it if offered. Probably a good summer lager."
"Drinkability - Too sharp of a drink for me. The bitterness lasts a good 5 seconds between sips which will certainly ruin my drinking experience. Considering the price of the import, would not recommend."
"Poured into a small Heineken labeled glass with a fizzy white head that subsided into a thin white layer atop a crystal clear straw color with vigorous carbonation. The aroma was skunky with a light touch of a bready malt as well. I think that by using green glass bottles the hops became light struck. The flavor has a very clean and restrained bitterness that is quickly overtaken by a white bread malt flavor but none of the adjunct like flavors of an American macro lager. It finishes with a slight lingering of a spicy, skunky hop flavor and a bitterness lingers on lightly. The body was light and added to the overall quenching ability of the beer, though I would have enjoyed it more had it been a bit heavier."
"An avarage, not so refreshing lager."
"Heineken seems to get pretty beaten up on Beeradvocate, but I like it. The apperance is average -- golden and clear. The smell is nothing to write home about -- bitter w/ the ""skunkiness"" most comment about. The taste however has a little bit of a kick and is crisp. This is the perfect beer for a hot summer night. Mouthfeel is fine. Beer is a little heavy, but the drinkability is good. It's easy to have this be the beer you drink all night."
"D: I don't particularly like pale lagers, but I sorta enjoyed this one. I might even have another under the right circumstances..."
"Overall a decent beer. Better with spicey food or pizza than on its own. On a really hot day, this would be okay. When the windchill outside is -10 (like tonight) it's a bit lacking."
"This is my preferred session brew when low on funds."
"Taste is also very good, tastes like it smells. Again lightly bitter which is just how I like a lager. It's a very drinkable beer. This was a very good drop, and it definitely reminds me why this is one of my favourite drinking beers. It's simple, but in its simplicity it hits upon just what I ask for - light bitterness, good smooth flavour characteristics and mouthfeel, just easy to drink and enjoy."
"This beer pours a clear, medium yellow color with a half inch head that sticks around. Smell is slightly malty, with a very faint hop aroma. Other than that, not much smell. Taste is typical for a mass market lager, very light with just a little bit more malt and hop flavor than most U.S. macro lagers. Interestingly, I did not detect any of the infamous skunkiness that this beer is known for. This beer has the distinction of being the first beer I ever tasted as a kid. One of my dad's friends used to let me taste his Heineken whenever we went to Miami Beach in the 1970's. I thought it was nasty back then. Now as a BA, it's tolerable."
"I purchased a twenty four ounce keg can, I figure its more likely to be in decent condition than in green bottles. Initially I detected a slight metallic taste that quickly went away. This is a pretty drinkable Euro lager, nothing spectacular, but defintely a step up from bud/miller/coors."
"Pours a golden yellow in color, some carbonation, small head, some lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, hops, and kinda skunky. The taste is not too bad, but not that great as well. I really use to like this beer, but my taste has changed drastically for the better. Light body. Drinkable I guess, but not by me anymore, well at least I will not buy it anymore."
"Pours a light, clear yellow with a small, fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells hoppy, with some grainy notes and a skunky note as well, which seems to have been present in every Heineken I've ever had, and appears to be part of the intended, or at least accepted, character of this beer. Taste is grainy, with some hoppiness that is matched in equal proportions by the aforementioned skunkiness. Mouthfeel isn't bad, well-carbonated and crisp, but isn't exceptional either, being pretty thin. Drinkability is along the same lines, not bad, but this is a lager, so I expect that. Mediocre at best."
"Cheers!"
"Howeverm very drinkable. Not a ""thinker"" beer, but I'd have a few in front of a [insert sport] game."
"Drinkability - Since it is a bit sour, I had a hard time making it through all 24 ounces of this beer."
"So, Nothing special, Heineken just is very popular."
"This beer pours a pale golden with a frothy white head that does not hold or lace. The smell is faint smell of sweet malts. The taste is also of sweet malts with a hint of skunkiness. THe carbonation is harsh with moderate thickness. The beer overall is not too my liking."
"Alright, I'll admit it, I am a little biased against this beer. I don't like the price, I don't like how a lot of fans mindlessly bash American beer while they drink Heineken and think they are sophisticated. Plus they do not pack this beer well. In the bottle (which is my personal preferred way to drink beer) the green color and transatlantic voyage combine to skunk this beer very often. For a long time I thought this was the absolute worst beer made because I only had it from the bottle. I don't think I've had a non-skunked bottled Heineken yet. Anyway if you sample it from a nice opaque keg instead, it goes from horrible to just sub-par. The color isn't bad, there's a little bit of amber to soften the neon-yellow of its nearest competitor (that's Budweiser, the only brand in the world that sells more). But for me taste usually determines how appealing the color looks. The head is pretty small and weak too, though better formed than the very worst American lagers. Smell is pretty weak on tap and a little on the nasty side. You can smell a little grain, and that's not too bad, but the hops do not smell very good. Taste still isn't good, but at least I could almost finish the beer without an effort. The malt was weak, but strong enough that I didn't have to concentrate to find it. The hops are middling in strength, not very interesting and definately too bitter. They are also a little on the funky side, though not enough to make you think they purposely brew the beer to taste like its spoiled like in the bottle. There was also a nasty aftertaste that kind of grew as I got further down in the glass. Then, I thought it was the hops which like I said, are stronger than in your normal American macro-lager, without being better. But now I'm wondering if it wasn't from cheap grains. I notice some other reviewers seem to have tasted adjunct grains, which I assumed weren't in Heineken. Anyway, the mouthfeel was on the thin side, like its American macro cousins. And drinkability was bad both because of that aftertaste that made it harder to drink as I got deeper in my glass, and in this case because I was paying for my beer by the glass and the bar hand my favorite beer in the bottle for less money. Anyway that's Heineken for you- better than Bud or Highlife, worse than almost everything else. Drinkable, but barely. And ridiculously overpriced. If you do happen to like this beer, the one thing I can say to improve your drinking experience is don't drink it from the bottle. If you like bottled Heineken you should save your money and drink Natural Ice. Or maybe just hairspray. Oh yeah, drink it cold too. I'd hate to think what room temperature would do to a beer like this."
"Overall this beer is okay, kind of watered down but it's taste isn't offensive at all. Would recommend this at a bar or there are better beers with a stronger taste for the same amount of money."
"A beer with new presentation in the mexican market, 650 ml, a rare volume of beer, only one brewer make this: SMBC; one improved and generous beer,little crushed hops and yeast smell; round and soft taste, it high fermentation represent its clear yellow color, recommended with the mexican food; heineken it is doing what the Corona makes in Holland; 70% recommended.In a pilsner Glass of course."
"All said, this beer goes down easy and isn't that bad. It certainly isn't good, though. About average for a weak style. Conclusion: if I'm going cheap, I might as well just stick with PBR."
"This is crap and poor old Mrs Anna Heinekin , who cracks a mention on the label woulod be turning in her grave."
"I ""acquired"" these brews from my roomate Pete's fridge while he was away on Thanksgiving break. The numbers 5263528G0254 and 5263528G0256 are screenprinted on the back labels of the beers I drank for this rating."
"It is fairly drinkable if you're in the right mood (like at a bar for a night of friends and sports) but hardly something I'm going to have if I'm only having one beer or if there's any selection whatsoever..although it can be nice while wandering around the seedy parts of Amsterdam, so would be almost any beer."
"Quite possibly the most undeservedly adored of the ""readily available quasi-premium"" beers."
"Notes: I only drink this one place. Vegas. Used to think it was cool to drink an import for free. How times change. I used to drink this only in the bottle because I convinced myself I like the skunk. Ughhh now the only way to even consume one of these is in a can or if I'm in Holland."
"poured a pale yellow color with bountious white puffy head. Smell is a very sharp maltiness that is not overly pleasant. Taste is slightly of malt with a strong hop bitterness also present. Finished more bitter than malty and somewhat enjoyable. Not a great beer but OK to have on occasion."
"If it is offered, I'll gladly take it. Not horrible and it goes down easy but doesn't give you much to write home about."
"i give heinney extra points because i think it is a good beer for this category, drinkable."
"The original skunky beer, drinkable but that's about it. I actually have some feeling for this beer only because these were the ones I would chug bottle after bottle during visits to Las Vegas. They only cost whatever the service was like from the serving girls. I just drank this again recently and it still has that ol' skunky smell and flavor. It's not horrible but constantly present. I don't know if this is intentional or just because it comes in a green bottle. Would I drinbk it again? Maybe the next time I go to Vegas."
"I guess I'll really be impressed by one of the best of this style here on BA since I think Heineken is perfectly passable if you're looking for a lighter beer with some flavor."
"It's basic, flat, and exotic to most beers drinkers that have yet to dig any deeper into what Europe has to offer. A bit more hops and boldness in the color would do this brew a lot of good - not like most fans of this will ever see the light and abandon it for something better!"
"the bottle I had was of course not the original one, but brewed under license in Switzerland ..."
"In a pinch this would do, but it's not one I would seek. Certainly better than American macros, but it's insipid and not very interesting. It's also too sweet for me."
"One thing this overpriced import does better than it's macro-American peers, it actually smells and tastes like beer. Wow, what a concept. Color is a bit too pale for me though."
"Overall it's an alright beer. Definitely better stuff out there in my opinion. It's nice to have around if you don't feel like dropping a ton of money on a night or two of drinking with the boys, but I'll definitely take my Belgians or even a nice seasonal craft beer over this."
"D- The first sip had a nice hop note to it but as I keep tasting the finish and aftertaste seem to dominate any other flavors. It would be nice to have some more character of grain or hops or something."
"Years ago this was the beer I abandoned the large American macros for. It was cool, hip, and I felt so superior to the mindless masses drinking Miller, Bud, etc. That was years ago, and a life time of learning. What was once my ""apex"" of beers has now been relagated to be a mediocre beer. Don't get me wrong. I still drink quite a bit of the stuff. When Im out with friends, often times this is the only other beer available besides the American crap. And yes, I still do enjoy it at home. In fact, there is one sitting in front of me as I write this review. Poured into a tall pilsner glass, it's easy to get caught up watching the bubbles rise in it's golden, crystal clear liquid (ok maybe that is just a throwback from my drug days!). Overall it is a mild and unoffensive beer. A little more full flavored than the American macros, but not much. But that makes it a great beer for drinking one right after the other. My biggest problem with Heineken is its inconsistency. Due to the fact that they bottle it in a green bottle it can very easily become skunked. I know it has become a ""trademark"" but they really should get it right and bottle in brown bottles."
"I know this one gets slam-dunked by most beer lovers, but if I have a choice between Heineken and most macro lagers at a restaurant, I will take the Heineken. Appearance and smell are average. Light gold color, thin head, no lacing. The taste is fairly good, no Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but not tasteless like Coors Light either. I had a couple of bottles at an Indian restaurant tonight (they were out of Yuengling and had nothing else there of any interest). Even in the 6 oz. plastic beer mug, they were still enjoyable and complemented the food well. I can't see paying premium prices for Heineken as a session beer, ice cold macro lagers are fine if you are planning on having four or more and the company is good!"
"Honestly folks. As far a true macros go, this is about as good as it gets. Again, I'm talking macros. This is the best beer you can get at most convenience stores, etc. When some one makes a beer run to a local mart, I tell 'em ""if you can't find my ""A" list beer, grab me some Heinekin"". Can't go wrong if you enjoy this style."
"Also for the record, Heineken and TBC & SAC go hand in hand."
"A little watery for those who like stronger flavors, but drinkable and refreshing. Should work well in hot weather or with most lighter food."
"This is one of those timeless classics i'll never get tired of. The appearance I find is not unlike that of most european lagers. Smells pretty skunky, most certainly not the nicest smelling beers. It does however taste pretty good, and it does feel nice on the mouth. slightly bitter but not completely overbearing. It is as drinkable as other beers of this genre. Overall this beer isn't really exceptional, but it's really not that bad either. Certainly worth a try."
"Wow, a truley unimpressive beer. Heineken pours a golden straw color with an instantly-flattening head. After a minute, there was no head to be found at all and it looked like I could be drinking a pint of apple juice. Smell and taste are strangly metallic, with a hint of sweetness. Tastes sort of corney, too. I find it amazing how widespread and popular this beer is. Great marketing, I guess."
"Notes: I haven't had it in a long time. Its so bland, thin, and uninspiring, you can't help but feel ripped off. At least the can was free."
"This lager is a big commercial brewer trying to make a good beer and making a typical macro seller..It has good color and a good head,but the smell is screaming of skunk.I enjoy this beer for summer grilling,but it is weak.Alot of people discount this beer,but it is what it is.A very drinkable beer,not good,but a beer to get drunk on."
"A slightly deeper gold lager color than I expected. A frothy head that thins quickly. But I still can't find anything resembling a ""taste."" Almost a total lack of malts and a very slight bitter ""tone"" instead of bitter""ness."" Nothing ""off"" about it, but also nothing that makes me want another. True ""barley pop."""
"Drinkability: When Im in the right mood, this beer can be really satisfying. And being here in central PA, I often find myself at a restaurant with the choice of this or some crappy domestic macros. And this is usually a small step up. However, I dont think the step up from macro swill warrants the heftier price tag. And compared to other euro pales out there, there are better ones out there that cost less (such as Aass). So overall, I find this beer average at best."
"Massive 1pt sized keg can. Oh how i love my keg cans. This pours a piss color with a frickin huge airy light head.The smell isn't skunky like i mentioned in the review i did with the bottle. I really wonder why. The smell is actually pleasant, sweet and malty. The flavor is simple a little hopyy a little malty and sweet. Jesus, never get this in bottle form, i actually like this! i mean it is no microbrew but or what it is it is good in keg can form. Very drinkable. Watery mouthfeel."
"Sampled from a 12oz keg shaped can poured into a pint glass. Makes a clear yellow color with a light white head, not really any lacing going on, head dissipates quickly. Aroma is light caramel malt, not really anything else going on here, and I am honestly surprised to see anyone call this beer ""skunky"" when sampled from a can or on draft... in my experience the only skunky heineken is the stuff in the green bottles that has had some exposure to sunlight. Flavor is clean with nearly no bittering, sweet, light caramel and cream with a slightly fruity finish. Light bodied and smooth on the palate, spicy carbonation and a dry finish. I'll only drink a heineken if my choices are severely limited and never when served from a green bottle."
"I really wanted to dislike this beer. I don't, not in the can at least. I enjoyed this brew on the ferry home from wall Street / nicely chilled from a sixteen ounce can. I usually smuggle craft brews aboard for the Friday ride home. I was beerless and a friend was buying. Poured a pale yellow with coarse bubbled short-lived white head into a plastc cup. Aroma was pleasing and floral with hints of malt. Dare I i say it? Balanced. Flavor was the same mild, balanced, some floral some biscuity malt. Not too sweet. None of the skunkiness that I remebered from past bottles of this stuff. Not bad stuff."
"This beer is overrated and overpriced. I would call this a good beer. I think it tastes good, but not as great as its cracked up to be. Definetly a drinkable beer. I would buy it again. I drank it out of the bottle. I don't know why all beer companies don't put it in brown bottles, I guess they want it to get skunked. Good beer."
"Wife purchased this on sale at Kroger for $10 for twelve 12 oz. bottles."
"Heineken's hops are it's success. Both the aroma and flavor deliver a combination of herbal and floral hops that seperates it from other pilsners. It's got a decent amount of bitterness to it as well, and it's perfectly balances a solid, medium-bodied, grainy maltiness. It finishes dry with some quickly passing, lightly sweet malt up front; and then lingering hops amidst a dry, long-lasting bitterness. Refreshing, satisfying, and highly drinkable!"
"Pours a straw color with an excellent three finger head. Exceptional head retention and lacing, even for a euro lager. The smell is perhaps more hoppy than it's style should allow, but the quality malts blend to make it a pleasent bittersweet aroma. Taste is predictably hoppy; Again a poor job of balancing light-struck saaz with a pale malt sweetness even for euro pale. Accordingly, the aftertaste hinders mouthfeel, which would otherwise be a fairly smooth. Lighter body and medium carbonation. Despite the overpowering skunk, its finish is smooth, boosting drinkabilty. There are better Holland Lagers less expensive than this import."
"I was looking for cans to try and avoid the skunk aroma, but only found the evil green bottles. I will try this again someday when I work up the courage... but it won't be from a bottle."
"I've always thought Heineken was the best mass-import, but haven't had one since I've been rating beer. Here goes. The apperanace is decent---light golden yellow, a small bright white head, and even the slightest bit of lacing. Smell is fairly faint, some grainy malts, some corn, a little skunkiness. Flavor is much better than the smell, with a fairly strong smooth maltiness accented by a detectable hops presense, a suprise for a macro. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Overall, this is a very good macro, but the fact that it's an import prices it more like a craft, meaning it's a colossal waste of money."
"Mouthfeel is thin with tingling bubbles."
"Note: I noticed the cap they used was not an oxygen absorbing cap. I always remember this beer being easily ""skunked."" I wonder if that is why."
"""beer""..."
"The carbonation is too weak for my taste, but I have to say--there isn't any alcohol taste, so that's good. I am totally unimpressed with this one, but I don't hate it."
" Now I realize why I haven't had one of these for years. If I must have a Heiny, make it a dark."
"Good advertising for a foreign beer, but really just another mass produced money maker."
"This is one of those beers that you have to double check to make sure the mug isn't dirty or you aren't drinking it out of some old gym shoes. Then you realize you are drinking it straight from the bottle. The smell is bad, the taste is bad and the feel is weak. Heck i'm surprised people still buy this stuff, let alone that it was once such a popular beer.."
"Taste is a standard lager taste. To me-this is a good example of a plain gold colored easy drinkin' beer. Corn and malt with some lemonny essences. Pretty good but not too great on drinkability--you can grow tired of these rather easily."
"330 ml green glass bottle. Pours into the glass with a golden yellow color, large foamy head that sticks around the edge of the glass for a little while. Very active carbonation that causes constant bubbles. Personally, I can't get passed the ""euro skunk"" smell. Once you get that smell stuck in your nose, the taste is that same skunky bitterness. Slightly watery mouthfeel, with lots of carbonation giving it an acrid bite. Overall pretty average. The green bottles just don't do anything for me."
"The mouthfeel is light but clean and adds to the drinkability, which is where this brew scores highest."
"There's 1cm of fluffy white head. It's flat but bumpy. The beer underneath is extremely clear and bright gold. There are strings of carbonation. Aroma is sugar and nuts. Not bad. The front is fruity sweet. The middle is a fairly nice, fruity, milkiness. Apples. In the end it's quite bitter, nutty, fruity. A little chemically with some alcohol. You know, this isn't a bad Euro lager. There's a fair amount of taste. Very fruity with a fresh finish: nice hop crispness."
"Fancy can, Euro name, kind of a boring beer. Taste is probably superior to most macros, but not by much. More watery than I like from a ""premium"" lager."
"Pours a translucent gold color with a little head (when poured correctly). Smell is very pungent right off the bat with wheat and hops, pretty inviting. The taste is similar to the smell, with strong hops and wheat with a slightly malty finish. There is a certain graininess to it that comes from the abundance of wheat. A great beer if you are looking to have a few, or are just kicking back and relaxing."
"A clear pale yellow color with a white lace for a head. Smells like grains and cooked veggies. Light carbonated mouthfeel. Grainy taste. Some grassy flavors and faint hops. Very clean finish with a good drinkability. All around an average Euro lager but not worth the price though."
"Boy, one of the *premium* beers on American Airlines. Decent golden yellow filtered pour with a white head that actual left some glass lacing. A small malt aroma can be detected behind a little of the ol European sulfur skunk. Taste was a little weak and thin, but some decent malt and grain flavors made their way through. OK, give me a couple more."
"What a horrid description of this beer. Its actually quite nice though for a Euro lager. Nothing great, just decent. The hops and malt are bigger than your average American lager that makes you realize why so many people consider this quality but basically its just"
"Overall, this is pretty good as macro beers go. I give it a thumbs-up."
"The beer poured a pale yellow with a bit of white head. It's aroma was lightly of malt and hops. The taste was pretty indistinguished. It had a bit of malt and hops in it and not much else. It was pretty subdued. It was light bodied. I wouldn't purchase one, but wouldn't try to avoid one either."
"The keg can is one heck of a novelty item and the beer isnt all that bad compared to its neighbors in Macroville. Looking in-house, I have tasted worse cans of Heineken, but this was better than most."
"I would highly suggest drinking Rolling Rock over this beer."
"On tap at a local wing joint. Even from the keg, this has the typical green beer taste. Smells and tastes slightly skunky, but from memory it is less so from the keg than the can. Still, it is a very drinkable beer - refreshing and pairs well with the spicy wings. Better than many of the BMC offerings that were available."
"Verdict: I guess it's not that bad as long as it's ice cold, but God help you if it starts to warm up."
"Drinkability: Definately the drink of choice in a club. Drink Heineken over corona anyday."
"Yeah, not a top notch drop this one... Very standard, and reasonably unlikeable. There are far better lagers out there..."
"Here's the caveat: This was tasted freshly poured from a cold bottle. Over time and as it warms, there's no question that this beer deteriorates a bit. After 30 minutes of sitting out, it degrades to a bottom of the pile lager. But let's give credit where credit's due: They made me eat my words. Henie's fine by me...when it's nice and cold."
"Drinkability: I can't stand more than one bottle per event. Two is risky and three or more is pure danger. Too foamy, too much skunky and its chemical taste turns my stomach upside down very quickly. US Budweiser is much better than Heineken for a macro!!"
"The skunkiness really makes this lager tough to drink a lot of IMO. Another case of the power of marketing."
"Overall Impression: Better than most Heinekens Ive had before, but nothing to make me want another."
"I am reviewing a chilled sample in a pint glass. The beer pours very light yellow with a 2 in bleached white fluffy head with large craters foaming up and fading quickly. A slight skunk aroma is present on pour but fades through sampling. SOme caramel and grainy malt is present on the nose as well. First sip reveals a light body with small and gentle carbonation. Flavor is mild but crisp with some grainy malt and some spicy hops intertwining nicely. The finish is clean and a little empty, where did that beer go? The beer is very easy to drink and you could drink lots of them in a sitting, I would choose not to."
"22oz keg can picked up when I stopped for smokes. I have to say the keg can was a great decision on Heinekens part. This was my favorite beer for a looong time before I encountered BA and such. The keg can enables me to actually enjoy one of these from time to time that isnt a skunky piece of shit. I poured this out into a tall pilsner glass. It looks like a good Pale Lager should, crystal clear, straw colored, light carbonation moving through the body. A nice head is produced, doesnt have the best retention or leave any real lace, but no biggie. Let me say again how nice it is to have a Heineken that doesnt smell like skunk-spray, it lets the fact that it does have a bit of character be revealed. The malt on the nose is like buttered sour-dough, spicy green hop aromas are present as well. The flavor comes across a bit sweeter than I remember it beingsame light buttery-biscuit flavor that I picked up in the nose, little spicy hop in the finish. Its really light, slick, and finishes really clean, I can see the appeal to the less educated crowd. The flavor is a lot lighter than I remember as well, leaves me wanting a little more (even from a Pale Lager). I still stand by the fact that is a decent beer, and Heineken gets its propers for the keg can. An especially good beer for washing down food."
"A true session beer, not other reason to drink this stuff. Looks surprisingly nice coming out of the bottle, pours with a decent head and an ok color... but then comes the aroma and worst of all the taste. I don't pick up a lot of the rice flavor that other people seem to notice. Corn however in abundance in this one."
"A really good brew, horribly underrated due to it's omnipresence in the marketplace, crystal clear, yellow/gold, firm white head, firm hop fragrance, maltier than anticipated well balanced with a nice hop bite at the end, everything you expect out of a good pilsner, very dependable, but yes, pricey"
"This beer is far from good. It isnt that bad either. It's bitter to start, but that isnt ALWAYS bad. It is a popular beer and it is a step up from the Bud and Coors line of beers, so it give it credit for that, but it falls far short of a beer i would drink regularly. Once you get past the biterness it has a steady refined flavor, not wonderfull but not swill. I'm sure it must taste better in europe fresh."
"Overall-there are reasons why this beer sells so well and in this case I can't blame it all on image. Heineken is an extremly smooth euro lager and while it doesn't have a bold flavor it has enough to carry it over while going well with just about anything. Don't expect to be floored like this like you would other beers but expect to be relaxed and calmed by this smooth and well-crafted (if overpriced) lager."
"Bought a 24 OZ. bomber of this out of impulse at a convenience store. I remember when I first started drinking beer (early highschool) people always said Heineken was good, but I never enjoyed it. Tonight I'm giving it a second chance. Appearance isn't too shabby. Color is golden yellow, head is about average size, but quickly dissapates. A wave of skunkiness hits as soon as the bottle is uncapped, thankfully this smell almost disappears completely after the initial whiff. The remaining aroma is grainy with a bit of light sweetness. Taste is grainy and balanced. Nothing too exciting here, but no major detractions. A little taste of sweetness pops out at the end of the sip. I liked Heineken much more this time around, but it still isn't a great beer. It's overpriced too. I can finding cheaper imitations that actually taste better."
"I'll only drink this in the canned form. If this is fresh and in a can, this isn't all that bad. Also, the skunkiness isn't in full effect in the can verison."
"My friend swears by this beer. While I don't share his passion, I can't totally hate on this."
"Pours a pale ass crystal straw color almost like the consistency of water but just a little more tainted. There is a nice white head that forms, but it quickly recedes without leaving the slightest hint of lace on the glass. Aromas are quite simplistic for this brew showing off just a faint hint of bready malt, a limey citrus consistency of hops, and something else which doesn't make me excited at all (I'm going with something between metal and skunk but I can't just put a finger on it). For flavor this beer is extremely crisp with a grassy hop flavor and just a slight bit of biscuity malt tones. There is honestly more flavor in this brew from the carbonation I feel than from the malts and hops but heck it is smooth. The finish to this brew is just faintly bitter with just a slight hop presence. The mouthfeel to this brew is extremely light and the carbonation creates a decently effervecent quality to this brew. Overall very quaffable, so I understand why people can do keg stands of this shit, but aside from that I just don't understand it."
"sitting at the Kof C with a friend did not have a big choice but to order this, the only one that sounded half way good. poured, golden with a white head. aroma, malts , wheat, corn, malts. flavor, a sweetness but can not figure out hat it is, malts. hops. I guess this would be a good beer to have with burgers or pizza or just to slam a few"
"Mouthfeel was all right. Drinkability? Yeah, but only if nothing else was available."
"It has a nice hoppy flavor, and an excellent finish. Light and refreshing. In the Caribbean it sometimes comes in 250 ml baby bottles which is about a half pint. At the airport in Sint Maartin, they are only $1, so I had a few to make my flights back to the states more pleasant."
"In the shadows of the wildly successful Halloween party, in which people obviously spent a lot time on their costumes, I'm certain the green sticker of Heineken had some gravitational pull. The truth behind that green facade was that of an average beer served to party-minded masses dancing to '70's disco and rock hits until midnight."
"Drinkability: extremely drinkable, but not enough to make up for its other short comings. you are better off saving your money and buying something a bit cheaper."
"Never really a fan of Heineken due to the cost versus other typical pale lagers. However, this was free last night so maybe it just tasted better that way. Nicer appearance than most light beer, kept a head longer and pretty good lacing around the glass. I'm trying to compare this to its style (which is not my favorite). Therefore, I think it's better than most, but you still won't catch me buying it."
"Drinkability: Not a bad session beer, except for its blandness."
"I havnt had a Heineken in ages so I figured I'd give it a shot.Left behind by houseguests.It has never really been a favorite.Poured a pale golden color with a slight head that was gone quickly.It has the same sulfury smell that I have always assocoated with Heineken.Wouldnt call it skunked, more chemical like.Crisp taste though very metallic.Ok body for the style.Nothing too special-I have never seen the appeal in this beer.I dont think I ever drank it on a regular basis growing up to be trendy.Give me a Bud,MGD or hell even an Old Milwaukee over this any day."
"Tried the 24Oz ""keg"" can. It poured a medium gold with a clean white head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was an old fashioned ""beery"" smell that could have come from an adjunct lager. Flavor was fairly good with balanced malt and hops. Hops were assertive enough to make this mildly interesting. Aftertaste was mildly bitter. Overall not a bad beer, maybe a step above Michelob but certainly not in the same league as a Sam Adams. At $14 a 12 pack it is overpriced."
"730"
"We picked this up on vacation in the keg cans. I was always aware of the skunkness factor, so I was shy on thisone. It poured a clear pale straw color that brought forth a average white head that didn't stick around or to anything. No lace was to be had. Carbonation took the head in a low level fiz. Left was a gold brew that looked abit flat. The aroma was of grain, sulpher and metal. The taste carried that sulphery metal husk, mellowed by a sweet malt. A slight hop bitterness only dried the finish. Over-all it was all I could get at the time. It goes down easy on a hot evening, but not one I would order if given more of a choice."
"Its been a while since I last had this one. Again, one of these was in my fridge after a weekend of people over at my house. The beer pours a clear pale yellow with about a finger of head that falls to a sparse covering over the beer. The nose is a bit more complex than others I've had that I put in the same league. There is the requisite malty sweetness, but I get just a hint of hop hiding in there as well. This is not my favorite, ut its definately not bad. The dominant flavor is just sweetness, but there is a decent bite from hops that linger just a bit on the side of my tongue. The beer is thin to moderate with a good carbonation. I am not the biggest fan of the light lager beers, so the flavor just doesn't grab me and keep my interest. One of these every so often when it is left after a party is enough for me."
"After its evacuation from the 12-ounce green bottle, it resides in the glass unblured gold with a personable sized bright white foamy head and as it dissolves, the lace forms a thin sheet upon the glass. Malt dominated nose, sweet and crisp, with the start sweet and the malt adequate, the top skeletal in feel. Finish is reasonably acidic, the hops standard fair and the aftertaste dry, drinkable for beer, and there are certainly worse lagers on the market."
"Well I can't really say you're missing much if you've never had a Heineken. I suppose I was doing the beer-tasting equivalent of slumming on this one, but my only other option at the time was warm beer - and I wasn't NOT in Germany. This brew has practically no noteworthy characteristics, except for an exceptionally smooth feel and a biting aftertaste. The appearance and smell are bland and somewhat monotonal. It starts sharp and clear with a very slight metallic flavor. This beer is light bodied and has a sort of wheat or grain taste throughout. Finish is much smoother than the rest of the beer and it leaves a distinct weight and papery feeling on the tongue. In a beer crisis, reach for this green bottle... otherwise, defer to quality, not quantity."
"It's been awhile since I had a Heinie, but here goes, it poured a pale golden, slight head, no lacing, I'm trying to distinguish a smell here, but a sweet grainyness is all I get, taste is same, sweet grains, with a dry crisp end, very carbonated, I suppose the drinkability on these would be pretty high, but personally, There are a lot more beers I'd rather suck down, than this one, it's amazing to me how many people think that this is one of the best beers! fair, is the best I can say."
"This is my beer when I go out and I have the choice between a Molson Dry or Heineken, you guess it right!"
"Clear, pale gold, straw-like colour with bright white head. The aroma was predominantly of sulfur and skunk... not much else could get through. Sharp flavour to start, with some sweetness, sulfur, and a light bitterness evident. Dry finish with little aftertaste. Light body, quite fizzy."
"Not a great amount of flavor but no bad flavors...not my cup of tea as I don't care for the real dry, almost sourish finish...to be honest I'd rather drink Miller or Pabst any day."
"Appearance was golden with a one inch head that left no lacing. You could smell the skunk from 10 feet away as the server brought it to our table. Taste started as lightly skunked and finished with a light dry hop finish. Mouthfeel was very thin. Overall drinkabilty is barely tolerable, decent for a hot desert afternoon."
"This is a thouroughly average beer. It's appearance is that of a typical macro lager. It is a straw yellow, with minimal lace. It is on the light side of medium bodied. It has a bit of a skunky taste, but the taste is not unpleasant. Overall, this is a beer that I would rarely drink, unless i was in a pinch."
"Drinkability: Okay, I guess... I'd certainly prefer it over the macrobrews but there are some much better lagers out there."
"Comes in a rather stubby greenish hued glass bottle. Pours clear, light amber hue. Very carbonated with a thick head that does not dissipate too quickly. Its smell is more of a stench of hops mixed with alcohol and some animal byproducts. Once you get past the smell, the taste is medium-strong with bitter overtones (hops and alcohol again). It is surprisingly smooth for its taste. At least it has oomph. Also, quite filling."
" Overall: This is a very average, if not a below-average, European lager. It's definitely not recommended, though it beats American, Canadian and Mexican macro-lagers anyday. This is a very decent hot weather lager beer, though there are much better ones available, and ones not as overpriced and grossly overhyped as this one."
"Everything that is wrong with mass brewed beers can be seen in one bottle of Heineken. Avoid like the plague."
"ng"
"Never had a good beer in a green bottle and this lager is no difference. It had a pale yellow color with a little bit of white foam and no lace. The taste had a bitter bite that was sort of unpleasant for my palate. The smell was grainy and had no depth to the flavor or aroma. This is one beer that may be good on a hot day when you just gulp to cool down and worry about flavor!"
"From the can this is a light golden color. I drank this out of the can, which I know is wrong so forgive me. I could still smell the skunkyness of the beer. I have never had a Heineken that was not skunky smelling. Tastes slightly grainy, but very sweet. There was a slight hop bitterness, and I mean slight. Very thin body and heavy on the carbonation. Overall, this is not the worst in the world. It did quench my thirst after a round of golf, but I just can't get past the smell. I would probably pass, unless I was desperate."
"Watery, boring, overpriced. It tastes good in Amsterdam, yes, but I don't know if that's because of a recipe difference or ... well ..."
"Overall- this is an absolute horrible beer! It is a beer to use for drinking games only. This beer should cost half the price!"
"I can't believe this beer is getting a 2.5! Sure it's not the best beer out there, but it beats most imports and just about every macro. It is a little skunky, but in a good way. Not something to drink everyday, but I have a couple extra bucks to splurge on booze, it's always high on my list."
"drinkability- i give ""heiny"" a high drinkability rating cause it just goes down so damn easy. its taste is more than O.K....slighty above average...but still as ive said plenty of times: nothing special. heineken just goes down without a problem."
"impressions: Why do people bring me this for parties? Time to stop the BYOB policy! This must be consumed cold to miss the funkiness."
"On draught at Chez Bernard in Fontainebleau, France. Someone had suggested trying a Heineken on my trip which I planned on not doing, but due to my poor French speaking I ended up with one at lunch one day. I literally had to ask the waiter what I was drinking to be sure, even though it was served in a Heineken glass. I was assured in answer to my ""qu'est-ce que s'appelle""? that it was indeed Heineken. Wow. Looks the same but the taste is definitely different. Clear gold with a medium white head and little lacing. The nose is lightly hoppy with a pleasant grape character. Very smooth body with a fruity and hoppy flavor that just somehow tastes like this beer really should. It all makes sense now. The finish is refreshing and vinous with a touch of hops. One of the only good beer surprises on my trip."
"crystal clear straw with a pure white foamy head that disappears to nothing. light aroma of cooked grain and slight skunkiness. light bodied and crisply carbonated, obviously going for zesty. lightly sweet over-cooked ceral flavor with hints of lemony hopiness. hops are vauge. finshes with that trademark skunky aftertaste. i had this many times on draft in holland, and it was much better there where it was presumably much more fresh. doesn't travel well, i suppose."
"This best serves as a thirst-quencher or a placeholder when nothing better can be found. Its best attributes are wide distribution and better-than-garbage quality."
"Bottle  Poured a blond type brew with minimal head with below standard retention. Aroma is in part skunky with some touch of malt. Carbonation is below average. Taste is really light with again that bit of skunky taste coming out. Overall, this is not a great beer but [probably on the same level as those American macros and I also believe we dont get the same version they produce overseas which is probably a shame."
"It is drinkable for the whole game."
"--Joey"
"This beer frustrates me. Mainly, it's because many friends of mine consider this a ""good"" beer worth paying a premium for, when in fact this beer possesses no remarkable characteristics whatsoever. I'll admit, this beer is quite drinkable. But that stems mostly from it's plain taste and the extra cold temperature it is typically served at. Pouring a plain yellow with slight head, this beer basically has a crisp, clear and boring smell to it. Though you can taste the hops in there, I highly recommend almost any Czech lager over this bore fest. Nothing remarkable to speak of here."
"Very easy to drink if you dont care what your beer tastes like. If youre feeling frisky and looking to whap back a case of beer go for Natty Light, its much cheaper and you won't be missing out on quality."
"Pours golden yellow with a slight head that disappears after a few minutes. Smells like nothing special. Just your regular European lager. The taste is slightly hoppy, but is pretty bland. The only real good thing about this beer is that it is easy to drink a lot of and I always seem to get pretty drunk when I drink Heiney."
"Light body, sweet."
"Pretty easy beer to drink... tastes good and is easy to go down. Could easy drink a few... tastes pretty good but overall it's just an average beer."
"So why did I try this again, knowing what I knew well from my younger days? Because I believe that to truly appreciate the good, you have to understand the bad. And while this is far from the worst, it's bad enough to give some kind of baseline. That aroma...check that...that smell, is something I could never get around, even years ago when drinking it was considered hip and enlightened. Now, if I could hold my nose while drinking, it would indeed be drinkable, because it is light and crisp, but I just can't live with that smelly critter under my nose. Gone are the days when I could drink this to try to look cool. I'm old, with kids and a mortgage. I'm drinking what I like now. And this is not it."
"white head on this yellow lager quickly disappears. faint citrusy smell, with another slightly fruity smell that wierd faint skunky smell is there too. pretty standard euro lager aromas. i don't really smell any hops. tangy, citrusy, with almost some sort of vegetable flavors. just enough hops to say that they're their. mouthfeel is sort of watery with tingling carbonation on the tongue. drinkability is average or even below for the discriminating beer drinker, but i feel that there is a time and place in which it could be higher, a warm summer day for instance. i enjoyed drinking it, sort of like i like to drink soda."
"This is like any mass produced and over marketed Euro-Lager. It pours a bright golden yellow. The taste is a little watery and it has some soury citrus to it. Very little hints of hops or malt but just enough to pass as beer. Overall a beer that i wouldn't choose if i didn't have to."
"Heineken is usually the best of a bad choice of beers for me. I hadn't one in a while but was kind of forced to drink nothing or Heineken at a Jersey shore establishment that was not prepared for a crowd on a warm winter day. Heineken pours the same clear, yellow as any mass-produced lager with a little quickly departing head and no lacing. It smells of old alcohol and a little of the barley. The taste is not awful by mass-produced lager standards but it is very thin, and almost watery in the mouth. The taste is definitely beer, but not much more distinct than that. If it had been Heineken on tap, it would have been more drinkable. I had one and left to find a bar that had better beer, happening upon one that was ready, was doing 10 times the business, and had a wide selection of beers on tap."
"While being faced with a choice of drinking no beer, Heineken, or a US macro, Id always choose Heineken. Thats what I did last night, and what I got was a nondescript Euro Lager with no overly offensive characteristics. Pale clear color with bubbly artificial carbonation. Thin white head is very short lived. Aroma is clean to grassy with little touch of hops, and due to the bottle having been protected no skunk. Taste is dominated by grainy malts, but is not sweet like a US brewed macro lager. Body is also more substantial than the big three US products and does not project a watered down cheap image. A note of what I think was fusel alcohol became pronounced as the beer warmed up, resulting in the mouthfeel becoming harsh. Drinkability is quite good and beats the other choices mentioned above any day."
"Pours a very clear light gold color with minimal head. Smell is sweet malt and grain (maybe corn?) and alchohol. Taste is similar. Has a little bit of that sour fruit flavor so common in american macro lagers. Mouthfeel is light, watery, but very slightly oily and malty. Bottom of the glass tastes better than the first few sips for some reason. Beats most macro lagers, but barely. Fairly easy drinking, but only marginally enjoyable."
"12 ounce can. Pours light almond, white head, not much retention. Just picked up a hint of ""skunkyness", and wet cardboard in the nose. light body, faint malt characteristics, mimimal hops, some grassy flavor, hint of cabbage. Crisp carbonation. This is a refreshing brew, w/o much flavor or other positive qualities."
"Sure it's drinkable, but I can find 100 better beers."
"Heineken Lager is a beer that I haven't had for at least 15 years. I never thought much of it then (and still don't really), but it is a damn sight better than the stuff that BMC puts out and is often the only drinkable option in those places that don't carry good beer."
"Every time I drink a Heineken it brings me back to High School. I guess now that I look at it, it is not a very good beer, but for high school, drinking imports made me a minority while other swigged the beast. I must say, I liked this beer a lot more back in the days. I do, however, don't think it is as bad as many others say. This is an easy beer to drink all day. There are times when this is the best looking thing on the menu at a restaurant. From what I hear, this is phenomenal in Amsterdam."
"This may well be my least favorite beer. Just due to the fact that it is imported, it seems that a lot of people think it is better than the US macros. They are greatly mistaken. Many US macros have little or almost no taste. I would take that anyday over the aweful taste of this beer. It is lightly carbonated, light colored and has a wretched smell. You get an aweful aftertaste and the taste of alcohol is too overly present and not disguised by anything else except for an almost metallic taste. Avoid this beer, but if you must have this beer, have it on draft, it is somewhat more tolerable than in the bottle."
"This beer is completely different on tap than from a bottle. No skunkiness whatsoever. Has a very carbonated sharp flavor that goes well with the sulfur flavors in the beer. This makes the beer go from awful to just average. I would actually consider ordering this on tap again."
"Overall: Hate to call imports this bad but it is. It wants to be a strong, good beer but it dosen't make the cut."
"Ok, but nothing special. I think I like the bottle better as it seems a bit more crisp."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with a moderate white head. Spotty lacing. Aroma is bitterly skunky, like rotting carrots and onions. Taste is unpleasant, with an acrid bitterness that mirrors the nose. Has a bitter, metallic aftertaste that lingers on the palate. The metalic taste is also present in the mouthfeel, which is also highly carbonated. This bottled lager has nothing in common with the fresh, draft version I've enjoyed many times in cafes in the Netherlands. This bottle is undrinkable, and the rest of it goes down the sink. Perhaps they should get rid of the green bottles. This doesn't travel well, to say the least."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It's simple pale malts and lager yeast with a bit of skunky scent. The taste is average. It's a light and refreshing beer with little malt flavor and little hop taste. It seems a bit watery, but it goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks well; a good sessions ale."
"This is basically a better version of Rolling Rock thats imported. Taste is all corn and so is the smell. Its quite drinkable, as it doesn't have that dirty gym sock taste that Rolling Rock has, but at the same time, it doesn't really taste good so way drink it? And more importantly, why pay an ""import"" price? Most places will sell this for the same price as your average craft brew. It'll at least be the same price as a Sammy A. I'd rather have the Sam Adams... much more fulfilling lager thats not made out of crap filler."
"I wish this beer was my favorite beer because I've seen it everywhere I've been in the world. They must have one of the better distribution networks in the world."
"This is crisp and clean on the tongue. Very light bodied and good carbonation. The grassy tones of this beer make it less desirable in the drinkability category. One for lunch was more than enough."
"This sample was much better than previous tries as the bottle was not skunked. A passable macro lager if it's taken care of."
"Overall, I'd take a Bud or Coors over this. It's basically the same as any mass produced american lager, except that it commands an imported price. The popularity of this beer is obviously image, because it's really not good at all. Bud is cheaper, cleaner and overall a better beer. Probably one of the worst imports I've ever drank. If this is my only option for beer, I'll take a water."
"I don't mind this stuff and it'll certainly do in a pinch."
"hey, its not going to change the world, but it wont make it come crashing down around you either."
"This was the only beer offered at a colleague's holiday party, so I tried one. I expected skunk, and was surprised not to find it. Poured a standard clear gold under an unremarkable but decent white head. The nose was malty, while the mouth was prickly and fairly light. The taste was clean, with lots of malt followed by a touch of hoppy bitterness. As a standard eurolager, this stuff strives for averageness. In that, it is very successful."
"I suppose that I shoul try their ""keg can."""
"The first time I had Heineken I wasn't much of a beer drinker, but after givign it another shot the other night, I was very impressed. This stuff is great. Especialyl if you throw a lime in it. It has a nice head that sticks around for a few minutes, and actually goes down pretty smoothly. Recommended to anyone."
"After the carbonation settles a bit it's a drinkable beer. I wouldn't prefer it, but it's easier to stomach than many beers."
"It's hard to believe that I once considered (and many still do) this to be a premium, top of the line beer. Very unimpressive appearance, bland tatse and smell. Certainly has a bit more body, and is of better quality than the ""big three"". Not by much, however. A strange, slight malt feel, but so much less so than any decent import lager. Have an Original Munich, or a Samuel Smith lager, or a DAB, etc. etc. Too expensive for the mediocre quality."
"watching poeple drink this and rate it as a top beer makes me laff. merely proves the naievete of most beer drinkers out there. they wouldnt know a good beer if it hit them in the back of the head, coz this definately isnt one of the greats."
"This is the only macro that I can drink without feeling substantially aggrieved. The aroma is a problem."
"Big keg can without any size listed on the can 24oz? I got it at the gas station by my office, I figure it will go good with my Jack in the Box tacos, I am sitting at my desk at work and I can't find my pint glass, I have to use my coffee mug. It pours clear straw golden color with a decent white head that doesn't last very long, light grainy and flowery aromas(no skunk).Bready and grainy flavors, light to medium bodied, finishes clean with a mild sweetness, not all that bad."
"The first thing that hits me opening the bottle is the smell. I smell it when I open it, and after swallowing the smell lingers. Pale gold in color, medium head like brine in the sea. Its what people always seem to buy me when we go out. After 4 or 5 beers I could drink this fine, but not to start the night."
"If your buying, I suppose I'll have one. But when it's my turn to pony up, expect something else."
"that heinken is wierd though; skunked or not, i always seem to have a good time. or is it just nostalgia?"
"Gross"
"Got this on tap at BW3's, a crowded place with what I assumed was high turnover of their barrels. Beer was dark golden color, nice hop aroma, nice carmel malt and hop first taste, but it thinned out pretty quick. I'll take it over Bud and Miller, but only if a micro brew is not available"
"Golden, clear beer pours from a green bottle and displays a bright white head. It's all downhill from there. High carbonation and a continental hop aroma mixed with corn. Light, watery body with a vegtable-grainy taste. Dry, crisp finish. Strictly unsatisfying."
"I think it is a great beer to start exploring with. Better than a lot of popular beers it helps the newby start to explore the world of beer. The more they explore the more they will lean to other brews and the less they will choose Heineken. The other thing is that Heineken is consistent around the world - well, in my limited experience: Europe, North America and the Caribbean. So, if in doubt about the water; drink Heineken."
"The taste is okay until the aftertaste comes along. A very bitter aftertaste turns me off the the heineken... even the heine-can"
"I will take the middle between what it taste like here and what it taste like in Holland. If possible always have this beer on tap it's much fresher and the taste is not as skunk like. This light bodied straw colored beer with little Belgian lace is good serve cold, but also very quenching and drinkable due to its ABV. 5% so enjoy but try to get it on tap."
"There are much better foreign beers out there, but this beer still goes down well. Still, I find myself bypassing it when given other alternatives."
"Green glass bottle, somewhat nice and easily recognizable, iconic labeling. I give the beer an extra .5 for the packaging. Pours a pallid yellow. Standard lager foam cap with a standard green bottle aroma. Skunk seems overused, but its a hard word to replace. And its accurate. Taste carries some of that sour flavor, minimal and rusty malts in the background, but the overwhelmingly thin liquid leaves the mouth somewhat offended. But willing to drink a little more. Which is good, because there are 5 more bottles. Time will fix that."
"Thus, the drinkability suffers for me. However, the mouthfeel is not bad, especially given the horrible taste. This is a beer I do not want to ever have again."
"Drinkability: overall, not as hideous as I've heard. Smell and taste were within my limits. Still, not worth the risk to drink a beer which has the characteristics of a beer-flavored soda pop. For an import, I'd expect more."
"Personal note, tonight somebody took a picture of me in a ""cool pose"" with the Heineken that was bought for me. I guess I'm really cool."
"This beer really does reek. I mean, it stinks to high heaven. I ran over a skunk once on the freeway and my tire smelled like this for about three weeks. The beer is a lot easier to drink if you exhale just before diving in, and then quickly set the glass away after getting your swig."
"Pale yellow/green color. Not a bad head on this one. Smells skunky, sulfur, hints of grains. Some grains in the taste, a little bit of hops, a bitter funky aftertaste. All flavors are muted. Why is this beer so popular? I think this is more drinkable straight out of the bottle, which isn't saying much."
"Light gold color, large head. Light tasting lager, slightly citrus taste, slightly hoppy, not very malty. A little skunky. Mouthfeel is a little thin, kind of watery. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is neutral. A mass-market beer, nothing special or different. Also, not very fond of the ""green bottle beer"" taste."
"Just bought one of these at the corner store. This bottle gets points for not being skunked. It's hot (around 90) and I actually had a taste for this beer. Yes, I occasionally get the taste for a Heineken, even though I make my own beer. What I like about Heineken in the sort of grassy hops ( a Heineken signature flavor), smooth body and dry finish. If I have my choice between one of these or an American macrobrew, you know what I'm going to pick. (I'm not so snobby that I want have a beer.)"
"Not a beer with a lot of character, but it is one of the better mass produced. I have had it numerous times on tap in Europe, and I remember it tasting better. This aint a great beer, but it has done in a pinch."
"This beer pours a light yellow color with a small white head that dies off quickly and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty skunky - not much else. The flavor follows suit of the aroma. It's pretty skunky to taste and very plain. It's a pretty crappy beer for its style, but nothing terrible."
"In conclusion, it sits in gas stations next to the old macrobrews, doesn't taste any better, and costs more. Not sure why it costs more, but it does. Probably a need to pay off the advertising bits in every movie that comes out these days. A rather dissapointing beer."
"(See disclaimer at my review of Bud Light.) I got this one in the can that is shaped like a keg, a pretty cool gimmick in my opinion. The beer had a head that was much more foamy and robust than any of the American macrobrews I had in this session. The brew was extremely clear and was a nice rich golden color, much like the Ice House. The aroma is more pronounced, however, featuring some malty notes and something else as well, almost a faintly fruity or spicy note. The flavor itself is dominated by maltiness too. In this case, the malt notes are soft, with some complimentary hints of hop flavor as well as hop bitterness. The carbonation level is a tad lighter than the light American beers. Prior to this sample, I had always had Heinekin in isolation and didn't really think it was much more robust than a typical American beer, but after this tasting I think I'll conclude that it is, indeed, a step up."
"It is okay. That is all you can say. No head. No lacing. No aroma. Just a mouthful of light maltless beer."
"Drinkability...absolutely none...I could barely finish the free one given to me."
"First Heiny I've had in about 2-3 years.Poured yellow with a short lived fizzy white head. Skunky aroma with cooked corn. Taste was even worse. Cooked veggies with nothing else to report. Just skunk. Worsens as it warms. The most amazing part of this is that I actually used to like this beer. Today it was plain awful. Unable to finish it."
"Drinkability - The world has this love affair with Heineken, I'm not sure why. It is an adequate, albeit overpriced session beer for anytime of year, anywhere in the world, as long as it's in the minikeg. A little malt, a little hops, enough to ride the fence, satisfying macro drinkers and hitting the low end of the bar for some craft lovers, too. I'd drink a minikeg if it was given to me, but I wouldn't buy it again, I demand more value for my money."
"Not as insipid as some of its American counterparts, but still plainly a mass-produced beer for a less discriminating beerdrinker. I'd only want spicy foods if I was drinking this, like a good salami or some tabascoed oysters, something that could slap the flavor of the beer right back in its face."
"Ah, Heineken. You suck. First of all, Heineken could be a very drinkable beer, perfect for throwing back with the guys except....ah yes, we forget that Heineken Lager Beer IMPORTED FROM HOLLAND is more about advertising and overpricing than taste. That's why all across the country there are 20 something buttcracks throwing away $5 to get a bottle (not a draft, mind you) that they can hold label outwards to show all the women at the bar that they know and can taste a good beer and that they have money to buy such luxuries. Whew! Ok--beer. Pours a very pale yellow with a head that dies faster than that on my urine. Taste is always skunky corn, somewhat less when taken from a can. Very light hop taste comes through. Mouthfeel is very thin following in the macro-pisswater fashion. Drinkability is fine, as there is nothing intersting going on. I apologize for this review, but the sad fact is that to the majority of bar frequenters around the country, Heineken is a good beer and something to splurge on. I know better, you know better, and I even suspect the people who routinely show them off know better. Like most beers, I'll drink them for free, but you'll never catch me buying a heniehole."
"12 oz green bottle. Pours a crystal clear macro straw yellow, with no real head or lacing. Aroma is what a typical macro smells like, if you didn't have the bottle in front of you, you'd be hard pressed to tell what you are drinking. Taste is that of the average lager. Nothing outstanding. And to think at one time I thought this was great beer! Still an enjoyable beer great for session drinking, but just average."
"While this is somewhat drinkable, I will reiterate what countless other BAs have said and say that this would be so much better if not for the green bottle. Perhaps I should give the ""keg-can"" a whirl to see how it compares. Overall, a slightly sub-average Euro-lager that is way overpriced and overhyped."
"Wow, it really is better out of the can! Couldn't believe it, so I had to try it. Straw yellow, with a thin white head of tiny bubbles that runs away. Very light aroma of malt, perhaps some floral. Flavor is smooth, no skunk taste, but low on malt and hops flavors. Tastes a bit like corn. As the aftertaste settles in, I can feel the slightest essence of skunk, but maybe only because I'm super-sensitive and looking for it. This stuff is fairly inoffensive out of the can. Pretty average, but pretty drinkable, especially if it's all that's available."
"Presentation is a green 650ml bottle with white foil around the neck and cap. It looks alright, clear straw colour, rather impressive white head that recedes into a ring and some lacing. Smell is.....not really there. Not even the skunk from memory. Nose is slight, a tiny bit of grain malt, could have been my imagination. Flavour is not very apparent as well in the first few sips, but the graininess of the malt starts to become more apparent farther down the glass. Aftertaste has a bit of bite to it, it lingers, and isn't very welcome. This is the Corona of Europe as far as I see it. Still, it seems to taste reasonable when mixed with a V8 (the only way I can finish this off)."
"oh heiny, i always disliked heineken but drank it from time to time like everyone else but eventually gave it the boot. i have a friend who drinks it my the gallons so i figured id give it another try. pours a straw color and after the initial skunk smell it smells of sweet grains. tastes like a typical ""import lager", grainy, skunky, sweet too.it is light in the mouth and somewhat refreshing. drinkability? not my favorite but, im not gonna say no."
"At least I know why they call these things ""Heinies"". To me, at least in the bottle, it's because it tastes like your posterior area.."
"This beer and I have a long, angry history. This is a beer that fools people into thinking it is good because A)It costs twice as much as other beers, and B)it came across the Atlantic Ocean to get here. Well, somewhere along the way, it got scurvy and died. Drink at your own risk."
"The bar that my fall softball team goes to, has this on tap. It is the special on the nights we play. Flavor and smell are much improved over the bottle. I would give it a much higher rating if I was reviewing the tap version."
"Heineken is a beer best served from a can. Though their is still a tin flavour, the bottle version is usually skunked and awful. Poured a bland gold colour with a 1/2 finger head that disipated after a minute or so. With the skunk smell removed, some hops were detected. Though the aroma picks up little malt, the tongue does. Watery, but their is flavour. Still has the grain husk mouthfeel that reminds me of my granfather's farm. Average drinkability. Much better from a can than a bottle."
"Do the Dutch hate us, or do they have a wicked sense of humor and like pranks. Do they sit over in Holland and laugh there asses off as they pump this crap into America and we make it the #1 selling import? I hope they just like playing pranks, but cause if they hate us that bad I am suddenly afraid, very afraid."
"EDIT REVIEW: after having tasted this beer in a can..much better."
"-F"
"Let me start out by saying that I have had many bottles and cans of Heiny in the States, as well as in Europe. Heiny on tap in Europe is a completely different beer. It' s not even remotely similar. I had this at the old Heineken Brewery which is now a museum in Amsterdam. For 7.50 Euro, you get a tour, (3) 33cl glasses of Heiny and you get to keep the glass. Remaining completely objective, I was floored by this beer. BRILLIANTLY clear light golden, forming a thick white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma is clean and crisp, with delicate floral hops, soft water, and a distant sweetness. Mouthfeel is extremely soft with a great wet finish. Carbonation is mild. Taste begins with lager yeast, minimal flavor hops, giving way to a pleasant and unique tea-like maltiness, followed by mild husken character and a soft, wet, well-balanced delicate bitterness with darjeeling/muscat character. This beer is infinitely superior to the many Heineken's I've had over the years from bottles and cans. Why they continue to bottle in green is beyond me. This is a wonderful brew, easy to drink, with alot of character and nuances."
"Like oh so many beers of its kind, it pours a nothing out of the ordinary golden colour, but with a rather small head which easily fades, unattractively. No abundant smell and when noticed it becomes unappealing. The taste is no better: a very bitter beer which suppresses any other flavors- if any present. this is truly a deplorable beer, not to try ever again."
"I used to think that this beer was quite good, but tonight when i had it i was not impressed with it much. A golden colored beer, white head that booted before we had a chance to get to know each other. As for taste, nothing much to report here, i would say that it is like a good bud or something like that. I think this is a good benchmark to judge regular lagers by, but not something ill be dreaming about tonight."
"Pours a predictable light gold/yellow color with a white head that is decent, but too quickly gone. Very little aroma; slight grain sense. Grain also in the weak, watery taste. I observed no skunkiness, but I believe I'm less sensitive to that since I regularly drink other green-bottled beers. My sense of this beer is that it is drinkable in warm weather settings and with light food offerings."
"Gets undeservedly slammed for being a mega-brewery (many mega-breweries world-wide). Should only get criticized for brewing a run-of-the-mill lager. Before microbrews existed and beer life sucked, Heineken was one of the finer beers available. Now it's just an average Euro-brew. Shiny gold in color with a grassy average malt body. High in Euro Hops. Smooth yet sharp edged. Liquid and Drinkable. Nice white head lasts an average amount of time. Green bottles prone to light infiltration and skunkiness."
"Pours out a golden/straw color with a thick white head. Not much of an aroma and the aroma that there is, is skunky. Taste is not smooth at all and skunky also. Not an appealing brew. This is the only beer my father drinks and has been drinking for over 30 years, was first introduced to this beer by him didn't like it then don't like it now. There was only one time that this beer tasted good and it was on a trip to Montreal, only time it tasted non skunky maybe it's because I was completely shit faced."
"Would drink this in a pinch, but wouldn't necessarily enjoy it."
"This was the Firesale at the Saucer last night. It is hard to put too hard a rap on this beer. It is just what they advertise it to be. It came with a nice head on a clear golden liquid. Beyond those good words, the rest of its attributes were average or less. I could not smell an aroma and the taste was milder than mild. But again, I knew what I was getting and was not really disappointed. This might make a nice beer if you have a friend you are trying to lure away from Bud. This could be a first stop on his way to real beer."
"I'm working from notes here since I had this at a friend's house a few days ago. I don't really feel that I need the notes though since this used to be a staple of mine before I discovered real beer. Typical yellow lager color with a thin and short lived head. Boy do I remember that smell which I used to think was exotic because it contrasted so sharply with the smell of American macros. Now I understand that it is the smell of a spoiled (aka skunked) beer. The taste is just as revolting as the smell. The only time I ever had an unspoiled Heineken was on tap in a bar in Brussels and my recollection is that without the ""skunk"" it tastes just like every other macro brewed lager..bland and without distinction. Don't buy into the marketing campaign and don't buy this lousy beer."
"I've definitely seen how my tastes have changed with this beer. When I was younger I thought this stuff was great. Shortly after joining BA I've seen the error of my ways. This pours a pee-yellow with a minimal lace. Some sulphur and a lot of skunk in the nose. Taste is crisp, but smooth with an underlying malt sweetness. Other than that, just skunky with that macro ""cooked vegetable"" taste. As far as drinkability, it would not be hard to down quite a few of these if the skunkiness wasn't there. I usually only drink this if there is nothing else around."
"It is what it is, a good lager. I prefer to drink it more...and more of it for that matter, in Summer, outside during the Summer to be more specific. It seems to have a so-so rap amongst the other B.A.'s here, but I do find it quite drinkable, with a bit more body & flavor than other comparitively-priced Euro-lagers..although Grolsch beats it with a fresher-tasting product. I also prefer to drink the keg cans, so I'm sure not to get a skunked 6."
"Heineken in the can = golden lager, small to middling head, quickly dissipates. Light lacing left in glass. Medium carbonation. aroma = hops and malt. Taste is sweet with hops bitterness on the medium finish. Crisp mouthfeel. Light overall feeling, one can easily drink several of these without feeling full."
"Clear golden yellow with a small amount of white head that dissipates almost immediately. Crisp, grainy smell--not particularly complex but without the skunky component of some of its green-bottled counterparts. Taste is unremarkable but not offensive--crisp and somewhat sweet, fading to dryness. Mouthfeel is stickier than one would hope for in a beer that is both somewhat light in texture and crisp in smell and taste. Adequately drinkable, as demonstrated by its popularity. Not something I'm going to buy, but I'll drink it at a party hosted by someone who doesn't know that better beers are out there."
"Light and golden color (appears watery). Oh what a surprise, it is! Head lives about as long as a sea monkey and is bright white. Flavor is watery and sort of has a 'peppery' trip to it. Heavily carbonated and weak tasting, this is not what anyone who knows anything about beer would call 'good'. Light hops is the only discernable flavor."
"Drinkability: Decent. Often a good choice as the lesser of evils."
"What can I say?? Glad it's not just me who thinks this has to be one of the most over-hyped beers in the history of beer making! I suppose if given a choice between this and Budweiser I'll grab the Heinie... but overall this is just way too skunky for my tastes. I have heard that it's actually better in Europe, and that it's altered for American tastes before exported... but I don't know if there's any truth to that?"
"Pours with little fanfare... Almost no head or lacing. Smell is slightly skunky. The taste is malty with very mild hoppiness. This struck me as very dry lager. This beer is very hyped (and expensive). People I know who drink this do so I think because they think it's cool. Overall, I didn't care for this. Maybe in Holland it's better on tap?"
"if you're have to drink a heineken, at least try to find it on tap or in a bottle culled from a 12 pack, as it won't have nearly as much of a skunky flavour as a bottle from a six pack that's been sitting day and night exposed to light (but rest assured, that skunky flavour will still be there to a lesser extent). pours a light yellow with a head that almost immediately disappears. it's got the typical euro-lager taste to it but with, as is common knowledge, a bit more skunk. if given a choice, go with a peroni or stella artois instead."
"Not impressed with this one at all. It's golden in color with little or no head. Really light on taste, except for the faint taste of skunkiness. I can't really say too much about this one. It did finish quite smoothly, so I guess that's good. The aftertaste wasn't too bad either."
"Pours a golden hue, with a little white head. Skunky aroma is par for the course, average lager with the addition of a little bit o' skunk. I grew up drinking these, so the skunkiness is part of the beer. An average lager, not worth having around all the time, but not bad to drink one every once in a while."
"Nothing to drink or enjoy at home, however."
"All in all this beer has the image, as many have stated this is the beer that people want to be seen with. The beer that doesn't even have beer in their commercials anymore. As far as appearance goes it is golden in color with a white head that does not last very long. There was some minimal lace as I sipped on this beer. It has been a long time since I have had this beer, and I never recall ever liking the beer. I had always spent most of my time trying to figure out why everyone liked it so much. Well, that is something I cannot answer, because when the bottle is cracked the skunk is uncaged. I wonder if this is the smell that they are going for, or is it from the green bottles that is my question. Suprisingly I did not want to gag after my first sip of this beer, but I realized that it is not as horrible as I had remembered it to be. There just is not much here a bitter after taste that is pleasant, nor is enjoyable. I rate this beer unoffensive, except for the smell of course."
"Rich gold color, thick white head. Grainy taste with medium bitterness and restrained astringency. This is a decent beer, far more respectable than bud or coors, because it does have some character (be as restrained as it is), but like most lagers, this beer is devoid anything really special. It is boring."
"Pours a very clear pale golden color with a foamy white head. Aroma is sweet malts and grains. Sweet malts up front with a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Light in the mouth and quite refreshing. This is a nice beer to enjoy outside on a summer day."
"This pours a clean golden color and has a moderate yet lively head. The head is white and fluffy and somewhat long lived. The nose is excellent sharp hops. the body is somewhat soft and watery. The flavor is sweet malt and medium hop bitter. Overall Heineken Lager is very satisfying and drinkable beer."
"One of the most known brands around but still it doesn't makes me change my opinion about it. Average refreshing taste, good smell (which reminds me of an ingrdient which i can't really remember the name right now) and nice sparkling gold appearance..."
"A lager with a fine reputation,....yet I find it thin bodied and somewhat flat tasting. Very light in colour and thin laced. Carbonation seems fine. Maybe it is because it comes from a can....maybe I got a bad batch......I'm so disappointed. Maybe my expectations were to high?"
"Golden beer with head that all but went away rather quickly. Soft, grassy hops aroma that can only be described as uniquely Heineken. The hops bitterness is probably the most distinguishing characteristic of this beer. I'm not saying it is anything out of the ordinary, but one must keep in mind that Heineken is quite often (unfortunately) a novice individual's initial attempt at soemthing other than American macro. For these people this is a very bitter beer. Other than the hops, there is not too much other taste here. A little sweetness and some salt are the only things that keep the taste buds distracted from the assault of the big carbonation. Also, it has a thin but appropriate mouthfeel. I'll buy cases of Heineken if someone wants me to pick up macro for a gathering, but that's the only time."
"I used to really like this beer when I was younger, but now it just seems to be lacking in anything that would make it stand out. Not bad tasting, so much as no taste at all, but for the import price you can do much better."
"Had to retaste the ""original"" import. Still too sweet for my palate. The hops are a good addition, but this stuff keeps me in the men's room too long. Tasted it in Europe and it was a whole different beast. Would drink it in Europe, but not here."
"This is a great all-around brew. It has a clear golden straw color. I the smell has a skunky-twang and another undefineable quality. The taste is balanced and guinuine. It feels good in the mouth and is very drinkable. I could drink this stuff all night."
"Pale yellow with rare, tiny bubbles joining a sketchy lattice of white on the surface. Aromas of metal, summer blooms, lemon and green herbs. Flavors are nice, bright and feature biscuit, citrus (lemon), cream, steel and raw almond notes. Very light overall and balanced. Cleansing. Chiffon-like. The flavors melt in your mouth."
"Remember only hip, cool people sip Heine... are you hip and cool??"
"I only reviewed this because it was at a restaurant with poor, poor selections!!!  Poured a very pale yellow color with a thin white quickly dissipating head.  Smells and tastes like a semi-hopped up Amstel Light.  Seemed to really be light bodied for a beer that's not supposed to be light.  Not really a very good brew.  Drinkable, but that's about it.  Cheers anyways!"
"   If my review seemed a little ""bitter", then I must blame the theme of things here."
"First off let me admit to be drinking a Heineken brewed in New Zealand not in Holland (according to some people this makes a difference).  Heineken tastes to me of mild malt followed by a fairly large and flavourful hop bite.  I bludged a bottle of my flatmate (i'm too cheap to buy something like this myself) and I must say its probably the best beer i've seen advertised on TV.  It may not be the best beer i've ever had but for something as mass-marketed as this you could do a lot worse."
"I find the number 2 imported beer to be bitter, tasteless (except for the skunk), and watery. Smell is awful. If a Heineken were left on the roadside, eventually a male skunk would try to mate with it. Not my favorite, but wouldn't avoid if there were no other choices."
"I know that some BA's won't drink this beer simply because it comes in a green bottle, but it is not a bad beer overall.  It is fairly drinkable, although the excessive carbonation is a bit of an irritant.  Out of the tap there was no skunk aroma, but the light golden color told me I might not get much in the flavor department.  Aroma was quite hoppy in my mind, and it carried through into the flavor, although the flavor did not last long.  I would not pay more for it over macro lagers, although it is more refreshing than the Lights (slightly more flavor)."
"Don't know what it looks like - drank it straight from the can ice cold. It was free, it was at a picnic, it was ok. Light (read watery) and a little too carbonated. But it had a mild dry finish and that worked for me. No skunk taste/smell noticeable. Like many others, this was my first foray into foreign beers so very many years ago. I'll drink it if that's the best choice (as it was at the picnic) but I won't go out of my way to buy it."
"Very little flavor, outside of the obvious skunky aftertaste.  Little head.  Little to like."
"better out of the can which seems a bit odd to me. this beer is just not great. it is intensly carbonated with a bitter flavor that is not enjoyable. it is drinkable, and somewhat affordably priced, but not worth it. i will not buy this, but i will drink it"
"And yet some people I know swear by this stuff.  I never understood that, but I try what I must in an attempt to advance out cause.  This beer is bland and really character-less.  Not bad for an upper echelon lawnmower beer I suppose, but the aroma and tast would get to me after more than one or two of these."
"Yellow color with almost no head.  Skunky aroma.  Sharp bitter hops flavor with a hint of sweet and nasty skunk flavor.  Lacks body.  Fair beer when ice cold."
"Notes: Not a bad imported lager ... one of the top selling imports in the USA also. Though with a wide selection of Dutch lagers in the US now which are comparable if not better for a cheaper price. We have seen Heineken range from $18-$24 a case!"
"If St. Pauli Girl and Becks can get it right, why can't Heineken!"
"Sampled at a Carolina pig pickin'. After I drained my supply of good beer I still craved one more and Heineken was the best offered. Little thought, little taste, inoffensive but too expensive. Put it this way: There are too many better brews sitting on the shelf right next to the Heine'. Why bother?"
"Tickles the back of your mouth and tounge."
"Very clear yellow...head is spidery after 20 seconds, bubbles upcharge in streams.  Slightly yeasty, and yes, skunky aroma.  Taste is muted in slightly apparent malt and a definite hop finish, adding crispness.  Aroma has a big impact on the taste.  Since smell is a ""memorable"" sense, it probably adds to this brew's popular appeal.  Try it while holding your nose -- practically nothing other than a very vague sweetness and a decided finish with a lot of gassiness.  This best seller gets a big mediocre rating from me."
"Pale gold in color with a modest head, a little lace, lots of carbonation.  Aroma is slightly bitter, with grain notes, also sulfur notes and yes, skunky as others have said.  Tasting yields grain notes and hops followed by a malt sweetness, finishes with a bitter slightly metallic aftertaste.  A local convenience store offered this in the 16 oz cans for $1.25 each, not a bargain as it turns out."
"If there was a ""value"" category for this beer, I will have to give it a 1.0. No--if there were a ""0" to give for value that would be it. This is the Natty Light of Europe, The swill of swills, and what's worse, it's everywhere and it is more expensive than beers that are much better.  To add insult, it is so popular in Oklahoma that they (the importers) have commissioned a watery 3.2%abw version that can be sold in grocery stores in the Sooner state. Doubly damned. It is better than a Bud, but it isn't worth paying $3.50-$4.00 a bottle or $8.00/sixpack.  Give me a Mickey's."
"I have a friend that likes this, so I drink it more than I care to. It has to be one of the skunkiest beers I have ever had. Have never been able to get past that and understand why some people like my friend love it. So reviewing it is hard because I still do not know if this is just how the beer is supposed to be. It poured a light yellow color and formed no head to speak of. An aroma of light hops. Flavor of hops and grain. The aroma of course was ruined by the skunk aroma."
"I had no choice but to have this at a pizza restaurant.  As for a mass-produced beer, it has some value, especially when nothing but Bud is available.  Smells skunky, but served ice cold, it's fairly crisp and drinkable."
"This is a prime example of what glitzy advertising campaigns can do for a beer in the US.  It's always skunky.  More than two of these leaves me with an awful taste that can't be removed absent a good brushing and some Listerine."
"Other than being a typical lager-style beer it had an unpleasant note to it that made it a little hard to drink. Not a very good beer."
"Nothing too impressive. Light, somewhat watery and quite often skunked. You think they would go to a brown bottle to keep it fresh.  What I find amusing is people who think the skunked taste is part of the import mystique.  Very average."
"Smells like cabbage.  Very carbonated.  More bite in the taste then its American counterparts (Miller and Bud), but overall weak mast produced BEER."
"Yellow average color with no real impact.  Overcarbonated with a slight musty malt nose.  Taste of slight malt and is very watery.. no hops detected at all.  Tastes like it is very mass produced and rushed."
"This stuff is like soda...carbonated and watery. It isn't absolutely terrible...I can handle it with a meal but when drinking is the only thing going on, Heineken is a bad choice. It has a bitter, acidic taste."
"Henie has an awful, awfulness that I have never been able to figure out.  At best, it’s a bad euro lager, at worst, it is skunked.  Why do people drink this beer?  We have catered parties two or three times a year.  If the caterer recommends Henie as the premium Beer, we will not hire them."
"Standard light gold hue with excellent clarity. Thinnish, wispy head lacks the retention that a good pilsner should have. No lace. The aroma is of sweet, vegetal DMS along with a lightly skunked noble hop nose. Not particularly appetizing aromawise. The carbonation is high and approaches prickly, and the body is fairly light. Grassy hop flavors dominate the flavor profile, with soft hop bitterness and dilute, non descript grainess secondary. The green bottle of course allows skunked hop oil flavors to detract from enjoyment. Even from a shielded case, the hops retain a mercaptan twang. They must expose this brew to sunlight prior to packaging... The beer finishes dry, but thankfully clean and somwhat bland. Yes-- skunked and forgettable. Even if it wasn't I don't think this is a particularly good pilsner. I'll still take it over a macrobrew, since it's more flavorful. There are so many better pilsners brewed here in the US and abroad... why bother with this one?"
"If not for the green bottle, I would say it has the potential to be above average."
"Brisk and fresh.  Has a refreshing zesty tang in the bite.  Herbal skunky notes on the nose.  Great session brew on a hot summers day."
"The epitomy of skunk, this is an easy drinking beer, with an often funky flavour (green bottles), at least its drinkable though."
"Mass marketing does wonders for average beer. I won't turn one down if it's free and there's nothing better, but I would never pay to drink this beer. There are just way too many better beers out there."
"Heineken is king of skunky green bottled beers. Never had one that wasn't. Tolerable (barely) if there's nothing else to drink."
"This stuff would get a big fat 0 on taste from me.  The fact that I wince when I drink it tells me all I need to know."
"always tastes alittle skunky."
"No wonder the Dutch export so much of this...They don't want to drink it"
"""What are you doing?""  You know a beer has problems when Bud can poke fun at it."
