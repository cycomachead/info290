3.23,1.3,3.5,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"this is either new to the market here or so poorly distributed as to be irrelevant and overlookable. its an interesting euro lager though, quite frothy in creamy in both look and feel, and has a nice wheat sheaf sort of body to it, different in its grain base for sure, bigger, not adjuncty at all to me. its a little sweet throughout, but its nicely carbonated and the finish is pretty quick, so i dont mind that. its just a lot more beer than some of its peers, and i definitely can get behind that. its sort of a cream ale meets a lager in a lot of ways, pretty boldly flavored, but fresh, not macro tasting, not tinny, not oxidized or anything, and its actually a pretty passable beer for something i have never even heard of. i could drink a ton of this, mindless beer, and you sometimes need that. good for sporting events and the like, dont think about it just drink it kind of stuff. one of the better of those types i have encountered in awhile. maybe this will do well here? the creaminess makes it.","StonedTrippin","Feb 13, 2015"

Sweet corn & sour hop along with the prevalent skunk aroma made me think of Heineken & Presidente. The aroma was killed by the skunk & had no real notes of worth.

Not much finish, yet reminiscent of younger days walking the streets with my open container in hand. There is a slight sweet grain character as I go along.

Sweetness lingers on the palate juts a bit. Maybe just my imagination, but I can almost taste a hint of peatiness in there a swell, like drinking the melted ice out of a long finished glass of scotch or bourbon. I have had a few Dorts that exhibit a similar sweetness (Great Lakes used to be sweeter than it is now, for example.) Mouthfeel is solid. Carbonation is a bit restrained for the typical lager.

3.65,14.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"a fine example of how a lager should present itself, tennents lager is one i keep coming back to when im in the mood for the style. its not easy to come across in oz, but when i do im always compelled to grab some just to remind me of how pleasing a lager can be when the situation calls for it.","diablo14","Nov 12, 2003"
3.35,5,3,3,3.5,2.5,4,"I was surprised this wasn't lightstruck and skunky because of the green bottle. I must have received a fresh batch and it turned out for the better because this is a good beer to use as a thirst-quencher or to wash down some hot food. This was a decent surprise altogether, because instead of getting a skunky Euro-lager, this turned out to be a good, clean, crisp and refreshing lager.","Beastdog75","Sep 30, 2003"
2.88,-9.7,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Light gold color, large white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Medium bodied lager. Light and refreshing. Slightly hoppy, malts evident. Nice and crisp taste. Mouthfeel is full and smooth . Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is smooth, slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Sep 26, 2003"
3.68,15.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours up a light clear golden colour, mild carbonation, and a big foamy white head. This stays for half of the glass before falling to a decent cap which also leave intermittent lacing. Nose contains sweet grainy malt, almost bready, with a slight floral hop presence. Flavour is grainy and metallic, mild hop finish. Creamy full mouthfeel for a lager, a bit oily. Very satisfying. As far as lagers go, this is what I first reach for aside from Charlie Flint's Original Lager from Alley Kat.","IronDjinn","Sep 10, 2003"
3.26,2.2,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a white head that stays, leaving a some lace. Light-medium carbonation. Pale golden color, light bodied, starts malty/hoppy, finishes hoppy. Nose seems like it is skunked but it isn't. Malty hoppy flavor improves as it warms. Smooth finish. The ABV on the bottle is 4.0%.","jdhilt","Aug 16, 2003"

2.28,-28.5,3,2.5,2,2,2.5,"This beer pours a darker yellow (slightly amber) color with a nice bit of carbonation, but a small head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma has hints of maltyness and just a tiny bit of skunkiness to it. The flavor reminds me of really cheap domestic beer such as Coors or something like Rolling Rock. Kinda skunky taste. Not a fan of this one.","clvand0","Jul 10, 2003"
2.97,-6.9,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Tennent's is not the best beer I've ever had but it is drinkable. The light flavor makes it a good sesion beer as well as a dinner beer with spicy foods. I wanted to like it more than I did so I was a little disappointed.","kindestcut","May 19, 2003"
3.58,12.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours golden amber in color with a thick and creamy white head that loves to stick all over the glass as it dissipates into a heavy lace. Nose is light malts and mildly spicy hops. Very light in body with a very soft carbonation. Taste is mostly malt sweetness but there is a touch of hop bitterness towards the finish. An easy drinking crisp and refreshing lager and a definite step up from the macros.","Morris729","May 06, 2003"
4.08,27.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This one pours a clear golden with minimal orange tint. The head is thick and lively and well lived with some lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is subtle and sweet with a spicy/woody hop nose. The taste is a very good lager. The sweetness of the malt is perfectly balanced with the hops leaving a clean mouth with a subtle rise of hops on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a very satisfying lager and I am glad I got it.","AtrumAnimus","Apr 19, 2003"
3.38,6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Color is a off pale golden yellow with a fluffy white head that got about two fingers high but faded fast to leave little lacing effect and just skimmed into a misty, bubbly top. Smell is mostly light malt thats soft and clean with a bit of grainyness lingering in the back. Taste starts slightly sweet, delicate in its acidity, with spotty hops and the finish going into dryness. Feel is light bodied and thin but is pretty drinkable, not bad, but good be better.","tavernjef","Apr 14, 2003"
3.85,20.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Tennent's Lager is a good beer to drink cold on a hot day. Appearance-wise it is a pale yellow with a fine white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma and taste are similar to Heineken lager, which I'm not that crazy about, but Tennent's has more body which makes it work! It's good enought that I've been a repeat buyer, which says something. Overall, a nice session beer.","astrobrewer","Apr 14, 2003"

3.83,20.1,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"OK, I know I'm not supposed to like this beer. The export's not what it is at the home tap, the bottle's the wrong color, and it has that skunky smell on most opens. Still, I keep going back to this when I just want a nice lager for eating or when it doesn't matter what the flavor is because I'm not reviewing it. The appearance is a pleasant, light-ish golden hue, and the head is fluffy white, if not long-lasting. It does usually have the skunk, but maybe that's not a problem for me because of the taste. I like the background alcohol taste that blends with the very light hops overlay. Frankly, it quenches and pleases. What else is really important?","AtLagerHeads","Mar 07, 2003"
2.63,-17.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The typical translucent golden color I expect form a lager, the head modest, white In color, the texture frothy with decent lace to cover the glass. Nose all malt, lightly sweet as is the start, top slim in feel, with the finish mild in its acidity, the hops sparse and the aftertaste dry. Mediocre at best and drinkable I guess, but not something that appeals to me only once every 3 years when I re-sample, but that may change as my list is to big, a beer that is destined be added to the Â“Dead BeerÂ” database along with all American macroÂ’s.","Gusler","Jan 19, 2003"
3.8,19.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer poured a light golden color but had good foam that left nice lace down the glass. The aroma was lager-like with a light hop and malt smell. The taste was a bit light, but good: nicely hopped with the malt coming through. The mouthfeel was good, with light carbonation. The drinkability was very good.","UncleJimbo","Jan 08, 2003"
3.4,6.6,3,3,3.5,3,4,"I was pleased to find this at my local store. I admit, I was expecting something a little stronger. Pours light in color with hardly any head. Taste is quite grainy, but surprisingly smooth. Very slight hop taste. Malt flavor was almost non-existant. A little fruitiness evident in the aftertaste. I would call this the ""Budweiser Of Scotland"" being a far cry from Mcewan's Scotch Ale. It doesn't even compare to the European macros. I can only hope it is better on tap. Glad to try it though!","Rifrafboy","Jan 03, 2003"
3.63,13.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I was really surprised by this! I was expecting a thin and bland generic lager but found something that had more body, some hops, and was remotely interesting! It pours a deep golden body with a creamy bright white head that holds exceptionally well and leaves some nice lace throughout the pint. The bouquet, however, is only of the ""generic beer"" type with a light touch of hop thrown in. Still, it's way above average! The body is (surprisingly) firmly malty in the Scottish tradtition. Very well done! The flavor offers a rich and sweetish maltiness, a very mild fruitiness, and some hop flavor towards the finish which is semi-dry with a lingering malt characteristic. Quite the charmer! Worth trying if only to see what Scotland's best selling lager is like!","NeroFiddled","Dec 31, 2002"
3.1,-2.8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"clear golden in color. adequate foamy head which dies quickly, leaving a bit of lace. a very light euro lager aroma, not skunky though. medium to light mouthfeel, smooth and creamy in the middle; somewhat crisp in the end. pretty grainy taste, bordering on astringent with a slightly spicy and earthy hop finish to balance. just an average euro lager but decent nonetheless.","budgood1","Dec 05, 2002"
2.28,-28.5,3,2.5,2,3,2,"Appearance and mouthfeel are just average for this brew and these are the fine points, it is down hill from here. The taste can best be described as metallic/hollow and sorry.

3.28,2.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Tennent's Lager pours a golden colour (a bit pale) with white head that lasts very limited time. For a European-Style Pilsener i would say that this beer is quite impressive...","ipogios","Nov 24, 2002"

3.08,-3.4,3,2.5,3,4,3.5,"Clear gold color, little head that's just a skim in 20 seconds.  Hoppy and slightly skunky aroma.  Aroma adds to a slight skunk in the flavor, also hoppy with well-balanced but non-descript malts.  This brew is very similar to many mass marketed Euro-lagers that end up getting imported to the US, but with a fuller mouthfeel and less overcarbonation.  Middle of the road but drinkable in many instances.","ADR","Jul 05, 2002"
2.85,-10.7,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Another beer that tastes like Heineken but a little worse. Nothing really good or bad stands out about this Lager. Typical skunkiness can be expected.","Dogbrick","Jun 27, 2002"
3.55,11.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Some people (not refering to this site) totally trash on this beer. I like this one for what it is. As a light lager this is stuff is good beer. Light, malty, with a nice floral hop. Not something that I would walk a mile for but it does put a smile on my face and it is some EASY drinkin'. One thing though, with its light character it does have to be resonablly fresh. With the light green glass to does turn fast","mattmaples","Jun 23, 2002"
