"DATE TASTED: February 8, 2015... GLASSWARE: Baltika stange... OCCASION: post-workout protein during the Cavs stomp of the Lakers... APPEARANCE: clear as crystal golden body--classic pilsener build--with vibrant effervescence; promising white head settles swiftly to a reasonable quarter-inch coverage; zero lacing... AROMA: biscuits and bread, with funky bad-breath elements forcing their way through the glass--a turn-off ... PALATE: mildly effervescent, oily, fizzy and long bitter, astringent ending ...TASTE: mildly sweet, with faint caramel; a pungent finish, with awkward, cloying unbalanced corn maltiness--were are the hops? ...OVERALL: the dark offered a malty character; this suggests the palest lager with enough malt to affirm its allegiance..."

"O: Not a bad brew.  Got it at the Russian Import store in Kunming, drank Jan 26th, 2015."

"This one is a Russian version of a classic pale lager, and it's comparable to other European beers of that style.  I like their porter a little more, but this works when it's warm outside."
""
""
"Your run-of-the-mill pilsner. It doesn't say ""light beer"" on the bottle but it kind of tastes like one. Easy drinking. Not bad... but nothing about it is particularly interesting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An OK beer, if you haven't tried it I would suggest it to knock it off your list."

"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, clean, malts, some sweetness, just a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and pretty good beer."
"O: The best thing about this beer is the fact that it came in a 16 oz tallboy can with a big orange 99¢ sticker on it. There are a lot of adjunct malts in this one and it is a little too sweet for me. Easy to drink but not one that I will get again."
""
""
"O: Although this beer seemed a little bland, I didn't mind drinking it because it was pleasant tasting, wasn't that sweet and went down easily."
"The taste is about what I would expect from a pale lager with grain and barley leading the charge, a slight sweetness, ending with a clean finale. It is a pale lager that is typical and average for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but it’s something that I would only choose if my options were quite limited."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some slight vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with some corn flake and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer but it's drinkable and pretty refreshing."

"Served this Russian Euro Lager from a bottle and poured into a pint glass. Poured a clear, golden color, produced a thin white head, poor retention, and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain, apples, and hints of spicy hops. Light in body, this Euro Lager had a foundation of cereal grains, honey, and spicy hops."
"Tastes and feels better than it looks or smells. Overall, it's a fairly easy drink. Could use more alcohol, but I think I prefer this to Budweiser or Czechvar."
""
""
"O-Will drink it often if i could find it often."

"I was sampling this because it's listed as a classic example of the Standard American Lager so I figured I try the Russian's take on this style. This a bit better the average lawnmower beer, not that I'll be stocking up on these but I'll try a few of the the other styles from Baltika."
"Overall, an average to slightly above average pale lager. It is definitely drinkable but probably not something I would seek out again."
""
"Overall: this beer is drinkable but poor enough to earn an avoid recommendation."
"Food match: I'm going to be lazy and say Russian cuisine. Done!"

"This beer is silky and smooth and easy to drink like most of Baltika's offerings. Crisp finish."
"500ml bottle.Lager glass.Enjoyed on mar´12.Pale straw.White crown,good retention.Close froth.Earthy& grainy to the nose. Slightly DMS.Pleasant maltiness,smooth adjunct flavor slightly hoppy.Light body,soft carbonation.Fine matches as a session beer in sunny days.A common Euro Pale Lager."
""

"I hope for the best to anyone who tries this beer though."

"The Rest: Meh. Pretty standard, unremarkable lager. I'd rather have a Genny."
"A pretty good lager"
""
"I've been meaning to shore up this Baltika series, but have been pretty lazy about it. Thankfully this bottle was sent to me. It pours a clear pale straw topped by about a finger of lightly dirty white foam. The nose comprises damp wheat, light corn syrup, grass, light flowers, and a touch of white bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of painful sweetness that bludgeons the tongue. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty sad beer, one with little character at all."

"Appearance is straw yellow with a crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell has a clean aroma of grain with a spice not and hops. Taste of corn sweetness with the grain leaving a lingering sweetness thats dry at the end. Mouthfeel is light with good body and carbonation. A classic euro lager a bit on the sweet end."
"D: OK, this one is pretty light... I could drink a few of these in a sitting... but is it anything really special.... Well not really. A pretty average Euro Lager."
"O: Not complex at all, but a good thirst quencher."
"Notes: It's decent drinking all the way around. Cheers."
"This is a decent lager, but nothing special. I wouldn't jump at the chance to have another."
"Dr: It's not cheap, nor is it particularly good, but it's a better lager than budweiser (not that that's saying a great deal). 4.8% ABV is concealed, but normal."
"O: This is actually one of the better beers of this style that I have tried. Some I find skunky. That honey aftertaste it left was also a nice change. This would work well for a session beer and I would have no problem trying this one again."
"This beer pours a light amber color with a decent white head. the smell is light and slightly malty. the taste follows through with a slightly sweet malty background. the mouthfeel is medium to light with good carbonation. for what it is its not a bad beer, would drink again but would probably not buy it."
"Overall - The carbonation levels are a little too high on this one. And the taste is just average. It's not undrinkable, but I wouldn't buy it again for sure."
"overall not recommended."
"overall its not that good. Its very boring. Very much a summer lawnmower beer. A touch better then a macro lager but thats not saying much."
"The cooler needs some multi-cultural status, plus what hot Russian babe doesn't dig Baltika?"
"D-True session beer, but I prefer other examples of the style."
"Avoid."
"Worth checking out..."
"Drinkability - I actually like this brew, despite it's other ratings. Not complex at all, but not bad-tasting either."
"excellent session beer i could drink this stuff all day long, and accordingly gets the maximum drinkability score available. lager category limits smell/ taste score but i still would give strong points for taste and finish, ability to quench thirst. baltika do a fine job on other offerings too."
".5 L bottle. Pours straw color with large head and soda like carbonation. Taste is soda like as well - bread, sugar with some herbal hops struggle to provide some balance, some skunk as well. There are some light hops in the finish. Medium body is smooth and sweet. Not very good brew."
"Got this a few days ago and just opened it out of the fridge at my friends house. Poured with a smallish, fine, white head, and no lace. Color is a clear, slightly pale yellow with small and large bubble trails. Aroma is malty and sweet. Flavor is like nose, very little hop, heavy grain flavor. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and totally forgettable."
"Straw yellow colour with some nice white head and very mild lacing. Smells a little grassy with lots of grain and bread. Quite a clean flavour, but way too mild to say this actually tastes good. Very high carbonation level. Easy to drink a couple of these, and I ended up doing that last night."
"i agree w/ the other reviews that this is a very good example compared to many other macro lagers. this is a solid beer and something good to turn to when you want to just enjoy a cold one"
"Drinkability: this beer may not have much in the way of flavor, but it is extremely quaffable. I'm sure this stuff is fantastic on a hot Russian afternoon."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat, grain and lemon. About what I was expecting. The flavor is a lot of grain and wheat with a tad bit of lemon. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing offensive, but nothing too exciting."
"I think Baltika 3 is about as good as it gets for industrially produced, mass-exported lagers. If this is, in fact, 'the famous beer of Russia', as its brewers claim, then I'd argue that it's rightfully earned that title; it's not hard to imagine how something so refreshing, clean tasting and easily drinkable would enjoy such mass appeal and worldwide success."
"DB- Cheap pint. Improved version of Bud with lots of flavor. Good for the style for the most part. Crisp and refreshing but still what it is."
"D- This isn't the worst beer out there, but it certainly isn't anywhere near the best. I think this is a good chugging beer, as the alcohol is well hidden and it's easier to handle if you aren't trying to figure it out. With this said, I would probably have no more than two bottles of this, then move on....it's just so sweet and malty."
"My second in the Baltika series. The beer pours from the half liter bottle a golden color with a wispy head. The nose above is mainly bready malt with a touch of grassy bitterness there too. This would be a very refreshing beer if it were not so sweet with pale malt. The beer does have a little dry bitterness at end. One could drink these for quite a while, I believe."
"Baltika 3, not a bad brew for the buck. Far worse ways to spend your money than this."
"Overall - It was a very nice light tasting lager. It's different than most lagers with the surprising hint of malt in it. Very good. I would highly recommend."
"Pours a clear golden color with a white head that quickly dissapates and leaves a thin ring. Light aroma of malt, grass, and yeast. Taste is similar to the smell. A bit sweet, there's not alot of hops in this. Light bodied. Overall this is nothing great, but is still quite drinkable."
"Pale lemon yellow brew. Bright white head settles from 3/4"" to a thick fizzy layer. Smells just like a barnyard- silage, wood chips, and a bit of skunk. Not appealing. Taste is just as bad. Fizzy corn water with a bit of citrus. Bleh. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Pretty awful all around."
"D: Well...maybe on a humid Russian summer day this would be okay. When I was in Russia in the Peace Corps, this beer did the trick many times, but now that I have a better appreciation for better beers, I can't see diving into this for too long."
"Coming out of the bottle I really did not expect there to be any color at all. I was somewhat surprised to see a bright yellow (almost urine color) liquid accumulating at the bottom of the glass. No head at all. Smell is almost identical to an American (BMC) lager. A fairly plain tasting lager - not altogether bad, just nothing to make it stand out at all. Some malt, hops and water. Mouth feel is also kind of meh - very thin body. You can certainly drink this and probably many of them, I am just not sure why one might want to."
"Not that bad, actually. I'm unlikely to pick this one up too often, but still I can't say it's a terrible beer. Certainly better than most other cheap, eastern European pale lagers out there."
"Baltika 3 is a very clear, pale golden lager with a big, waxy, lumpy, white head that has good retention. The aroma is funky, grassy, and corny, with notes of DMS and vegetables. It's medium-light bodied; scratchy and papery with a sandpaper finish. One taste of this and I feel like I'm going to go live under a bridge. It's all fusel and DMS. I think my eyebrows are falling out. If I had this at a blind tasting I wouldnt've guessed it was beer. Poison. This is challenging-- and not in a good way."
"Notes: This beer pretty much takes the place of a light beer. While it isn't anything special in regards to all of the beers in the world. It is however, a decent attempt at this style, and better than other beers that taste similar. It is light while remaining somewhat flavorful. It definitely has a bigger hop presence than most lighter beers."
"Very light yellow with friable 2-finger head, some lace. Grain aroma with tones of dough & paper. Medium carbonation. Proper grain taste, less hop, paper, alcohol & vegetable notes, not very pleasant aftertaste however, drinkability is low, beer only for 1 time!"
"Enjoyed this more than the other two pale lagers I've had from this brewery."
"At least the carbonation isn't too high."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Clear very pale strw color with a foamy head that disperses quickly. Had that typical imported lager smell and I did not have high hopes for this one but it tasted not bad and it washed my grilled burgers down very nicely. Nothing really special here but not bad."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable, quality beer. You could do worse for the style."
"Nothing special, but definitely an above averge quality mainstream lager."
"Overall: I am impressed by this beer. It is brewed by the second largest brewery in Europe, so I would expect it to be more generic. It feels high quality though, and rivals some good German Vienna Lagers and Pilsners that I have had. My bottle poured with better head and better retention than many stouts and porters!"
"nothing offensive but nothing worth looking for"
"D - Could easily drink a few but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this."
"Maybe this bottle isn't that old but it's impossible for me to tell with the dating system but it appears as though this beer is a few years old, the brown bottle might have saved it, a nice suprise."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this one is my favorite Eastern Euro Lager thus far. Great example of what this category should taste like, in my opinion."
"Out of a bottle hand-delivered to me by my beautiful Russian bombshell this beer was a pale, golden yellow color with three fingers of head. The retention was ok and the lacing about the same. The aroma was of pale malt, stale grains and faint hops. The flavors were similar, dominated by the grains (mostly corn) with some sweet malt and herbal hops. I liked the bitter/sweet balance and it finished crisp. The mouthfeel was average, the body light and the carbonation on the high side. Nothing amazing, aside from the fact that it came all the way from Russia just for me. In this regard, it was great!"
"Feel is nice, with a pleasant tingle, although the body is overall a bit sticky. Yeah, flavours are just a bit skew-whiff and they don't taste fresh or crisp, which means this isn't all that pleasant or drinkable. It's close to being both though."
"mouthfeel is light and crispy. drinkable lager."
"Poured with little head into a pint glass. Medium carbonation and a light straw colour. Initially looked like a macro lager, which it is, but I was astonished to find it had a slight malty aroma and a nice malty flavour with some grassy notes. It was pretty dinkable. I had this over dinner with a Russian friend and Russian food so the context added a lot to the enjoyment. All in all this is a slightly better macro lager that was thoroughly drinkable and a much better alternative to the average Australian swill that gets passed around here. I'll have this again no doubt even though there's a lot of superior euro lagers out there. A great BBQ drink."
"This beer pours a very clear pale golden hue, with lots of puffy, thin white head, that leaves minor lace around the glass as it recedes. It smells of mildly sweet white grain, and a herbal grassiness. The taste is sweet white grain, kind of cloying, and earthy, grassy noble hops. The carbonation is on the high side, the body fairly solid, with a bit of glycerol slickness, and it finishes off-dry, a small vegetal sweetness hanging on."
"Solid atmosphere. The appearance is better than average. Decent nose. Pretty basic flavor, but nice balance. Drinks easy. Pretty nice little quaff."
"D- Very sessionable. I have to admit, not being much of a lager guy it was better than I expected. Would pick this one over a Bud/Miller/Coors for sure. Not sorry I had it but probably wont get it again."
"over all not unenjoyable by any means but i dont imagine i will go out of my way to purchase it again."
"Is this the Budweiser of Russia? Love the numbered beers by the way. I'll have a #3, and a #4 for my comrade..."
"Drinkability - Good this is a very decent import lager."
"overall - i dont see myself buying this one again but glad i tried it"
"2.5 D: Not ungodly bad, but the style isn't something good to begin with."
"Well, it's certainly interesting and it fits the style. The russians sure could do better though."
"The taste likewise starts as a rather full-bodied grain with light herbal and grassy hops, sweetish with light bitterness, but then degrades to a simpler taste of slightly old grain and grassy hop."
"I'd have no problem drinking this beer again. However, it's definitely better cold. Further down the glass as the beer warmed to room temperature, it lost quite a bit of flavor and turned a bit stale."
"D - This beer wont blow you away but its a decent average beer for the style to me its a Russian Macro lager thats not too bad"
"Overall - I drank the heck out of this beer when I was in Kyrgyzstan with the the Army a few years ago. We could get it cheap and it was good at the time. My tastes have changed a bit since then. My idea of good beer back then was Busch Light. I had a hard time finding Baltika here until recently. This beer is good for what it is supposed to be. It is a good alternative to the American adjunct lagers."
"Pours a light gold with a very nice looking white head that has decent retention and a good frumpiness. Smells are faint and leaning towards sweet but artificial honey notes. Flavors are very subdued: slightly sweet malts with just the suggestion of hops. Inoffensiveness and mass appeal seems to be this beer's goal and in that sense it is a success. Several other styles by Baltika are much better (especially the hefeweizen)."
"D- Quite drinkable given the ABV and what it has to offer. Will drink again."
"Drinkability: Instantly forgettable, as there's nothing inherently wrong, unique, or even pleasant about it. Some might even go as far to say ""it drink pretty good."""
"Clear, watery pale yellow look with great lacing and a thin, patchy head. Aromas were a bit weak with some grassy tones. Great bitter-sweet taste with a somewhat citrus flavoring to it. Very refreshing with a good, solid carbonation. Overall, the best of the Baltika series I have had so far."
"Although the taste is not extremely good and does not score too far above average, the beer is very, very drinkable, especially considering its price."
"Drinkability - An ok beer. Not great but I'd reach for this before many domestic offerings. Would be a good change from typical ""grill-associated"" lagers."
"Drinkability: Its really good for one thing, and that is drinking this in multiples. I would drink this over bud, coors and miller any day, but its really just a step above them if anything."
"Pretty good...for a pale lager. Abundant aroma, mild maltiness with some crisp hops. Standard pour, nothing to complain about. Mouthfeel is nice but the finish falls off, kind of watery and lacking. Good taste, this one got better and smoother towards the end. Slightly sweet, again a good maltiness, rather crisp."
"D - An alright beer, maybe a tad better than the #2. Taste is still on the edge of total blandness."
"Russian beers are always fun to break out with your friends. It makes it seem like you went to the ends of the earth to find one. Nothing spectacular, kind of like a Russian Budweiser, but crisper tasting; possibly a better grade of hop. Still pours clear yeallow with a big white head. Same corny sugar aroma."
"Picked up a mixed 4 pack of Baltika brews, this pale lager gave a pretty bad first impression with a skunky smell, but the flavor ended up being pretty decent."
"D - Not bad, but fairly typical of the style, it just lacks a lot of character."
"When I learned what the style of this beer was, I initially cringed. Based on the previous Euro Pale Lagers that I've had, I wasn't expecting much of this brew. However, this one is actually not that bad. There isn't a whole lot in the flavor department, but its redeeming characteristics are the mouthfeel and drinkability. It basically seems to be what I remember the previous beers of this style to be, but it has what is arguably the most important charactaristic of a beer - taste."
"Probably the first Russian beer I have had but I could be mistaken, not bad for the money but probably would not buy again, , might be worth trying if you are looking for a good deal rather than a high quality brew"
"I poured this Russian Lager into a Heavy Seas pint glass. This Baltika beer was clear, pale, and straw yellow in color. On top of this pale yellow beer was a 1/4 to 1/2 an inch head of white foam. This small head of foam had decent retention that left behind a small white film and a few small blots of lace. Usual Macro appearance. The aroma was weet and malty with malted corn, a touch of malted rice, a pinch of malted barley, and then finishes up sweet with sugar and yeast. The taste was crispy, sweet, and filled a ton of malted grains like corn, rice, and barley. There wasn't much after the grains. All I got was a slight bitter finish with some crispy floral hops. This was a light bodied Lager with a malty aftertaste of more malted grains. It was a very grainy beer. In the end, it's another run of the mill cheap lager beer filled with cheap malted grains. Well, at least I can it was cheap in price, but you usually get what you pay for."
"Kind of bland and kind of rough, but palatable. Run of the mill pale lager if you ask me."
"TMD-I got this from Russsia when my brother in law went over there. This is a decent brew but not the best from this brand. The taste ids smooth as silk and goes down very easy. I could drink this all night long. I look forward to more."
"D: An average continental lager. You're not going to get the depth of malt flavour you'd find in a mainstream German lager, but for an easy drinker you don't have to think about it's not bad."
"Being Russian brewed I wasn't sure what to expect. It's OK...but then so is Heineken."
"I like this beer, not too over the top in any area, but it is seems to do everything quite well. It has a pleasant flavor it is slightly sweet. Fairly low alchohol level 4.8 makes it very drinkable. I would buy this again when I am in the mood for something a bit better than the typical American/Canadian Lagers."
"D - Easy to drink, this is not particularly complex but it is good for what it is, and certainly the best lager Baltika makes."
"D - Better than BMC pale lagers, but still not all that great. If this stuff was as cheap as Old Milwaukee it could be a good ""lets get drunk"" party beer in the summer. Pretty boring really, but it is clean and refreshing. I might get my Bud Light-loyal father some of this stuff next time I go home."
"Pours a very very pale yellow color with a fizzy white head that settles incredibly quickly. Moderate carbonation. Some faint grassy aroma along with a bit of apple. Taste has just a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery. Low flavor levels help to make this brew a good candidate for a palate cleanser, and i suppose would make fairly good session beer as well."
"Here's hoping the batch I had was poor despite the lack of light-struck taste. Good luck cause I couldn't finish mine!"
"This is another Euro Pale Lager that isn't going to get rave reviews just because of what it is. But, I find this one refreshing without having any horrible flavors. What else can it do? It' a good beer for the style. Recommended, if you're mowing the lawn or something."
"A very typical and boring macro pils tasting beer"
"Good mouthfeel as there is a medium bodied feel to it. Slick on the tongue with lingering sweetness. An okay beer. Wont offend anyone but will not impress anyone either."
"I've only had a few of their offerings so far, but if I was pretending to be Russian, I'd drink Baltika beer. Especially given what else I've tasted from that neck of the woods."
"drinkability is fine, I found nothing off-putting on this one, one of the better beers of this genre IMO, would have no problem drinking again, very enjoyable!"
"Pours a strong yellow with a frothy white head that fades fast. Smell is very sweet with malts, corn, and grain. The taste is not as sweet as the smell, grainy and malty, not a ton of flavor but a good amount is there. A sweet aftertaste finishes off the flavor. The mouthfeel is very light with good carbonation. This one is great cold on a hot summer day, a very easy drinker that is a step up from most lagers."
"Overall - I wasn't too impressed by this offering from Baltika. It was very watery but not bland. There is a constant metallic taste throughout my experience with this. It's not really worth the 96 cents I spent on this. Try it if you want, you're not missing out."
"Overall not a bad beer, a bit sweet, but still drinkable and pretty refreshing."
"Pours a light straw yellow with pillow white head. Right off I am hit with a hint of hops and malty sweet aroma corn? Taste is very mellow with little hop bitterness and very little malt character, except for this sweetness that tastes like cream of corn. No balance really, this beer would be better if the malt and hops were in balance-otherwise I taste an unnatural sweetness-especially at 4.8%. Little hops in the finish, with light mouthfeel-drinkability is good if you want an easy drinking nondescript beer-"
"Actually, I grew up on this beer ... I had it on a regular basis since I was about 16-17 till I was 23, then I moved to US and did not have it for quite a while. After seeing it in the store I've decided to try it and find out if I'd like it now, when I'm not a foolish youngster anymore ... I'm glad to day, I was not disappointed. This is a very nice, very balanced lager, not too bitter, not too sweet, with a mild pleasant smell. It's hard to find something really distinct about it but that's because nothing overwhelms and nothing turns you off. Yes, it is highly carbonated, but I like that."
"A fairly non-descript lager with a few desirable characteristics, but also some flaws. The beer begins with a brightly straw-colored hue, good head formation, and moderate retention, very mild lacing. Aromas of pilsner malts, raw cereal grains, and hints of corn and acidity. Flavors of light malts prevail, later showing some corn flavors (dms), green apples (acetaldahyde), and soft herbal hops. The texture is moderate, but a bit slick and grainy in the texture. Light acidity (lemon-grass) show up intermittenly through the drink. Finishes with a blend of the light malts, grain flavors, and mild hops. The beer is difficult to praise, but fine for a get-it-down kind of beer."
"Got it for $2.50 at the foodery in Philadelphia. Wasn't worth it. Yet another way-too carbonated Russian beer. I KNOW there MUST be good Russian beer (besides all the Russian Imperial Stouts they make in California). Piss yellow swill that tastes like a a cross between club soda and malt liquor. I ended up having to chug it in order to get my money's worth, but before I took that route, I detected a sort of artificial lemony taste, which I suspect is being used to cover for mediocre (or spoiled) ingredients. If you're really interested in trying a Russian pilsner, I reccomend TINKOV. Not bad, but also very carbonated."
"The flavor was pretty light and dry, and slightly bitter. The aftertaste was its real distinguishing character - sweet, yeasty, and creamy. Overall, this beer was decent, and I especially liked how unique it was."
"Mouthfeel is on the light side, this strikes me as a swillin' type of beer, you want it to go down fast and not linger very long, or so that's my impression."
"This isn't an especially drinkable beer. The taste is just too thin and not at all complex to be interesting."
"Poured pale golden from the bottle into my Homer Simpson mug. I was pleased to see a good two-finger head. First sip was disappointing, tasted like skunked Heineken. Bit of a pee smell. Second sip was a little better. Faint sour apple taste, but no unique or prominent flavor profile. Light-bodied, light carbonation, and drinks easy enough. Good price, that's about it."
"Pours a crystal clear, pale, light straw color with massive meringue like head and excellent tracing. Aroma is close to nil with a little green apple and a touch of grain. No cooked corn, just, nothing! On the palate, a smooth slightly sweet malt feel hits first and a nice light noble hop bitterness follows finishing a little jumbled. I'd like to see more crispness which should be the hallmark of this style. Overall though, it is clean and refreshing, good for its style."
"Actually probably better than some of the style, but overall it didn't do much for me."
"D: Overall while not exciting it certainly does not offend. Moderate flavor with moderate drinkability."
"D- Drink ability was okay, it was almost like drinking nothing"
"B'ham UK Jan 2008"
"D: Where's the flavour gone? This beer might look pretty good, but its flavour leaves much to be desired. It might be easy to drink, but I's much sooner switch to another beer. I wouldn't rule this beer out completely in the future, but I think I'll wait for a hot summers day."
"""Classic Beer"" That pretty much sums it up. Plain ol' beer as far as I am concerned. You can tell it is mass produced and you may as well be drinking one of the big breweries of the United States. No outstanding quality, no remarkable personality."
"I'm going to buy more."
"I avoided this beer for months because I thought it would be a sub par Eurolager but surprise surprise it was a decent fresh tasting pils with a very pale colour that looks quite nice in the glass. Much like the Tuborg Pils this beer has a decent hop finish and a crispness that quenches the thirst"
"Taste is lightly sweet, very nutty and grainy with a decent hop profile. Floral, earthy. Soft in the mouth at first, then a mild carbonated bite and finishes sticky and dry. This is a clinical beer, style wise, and it's decent, not cheap tasting and drinkable in spades. A good summer refresher and an above average euro-lager."
"Taste is of corn,grainy and musty finishing off dry,very little bitterness and light carbonation.A very drinkable beer that goes down rather thin and easy,great for those hot summer days."
"¡Salud!"
"Skip it."
"Easy to drink, especially ice cold. Pretty much a premium lawnmower beer."
"I tried this beer on July 25, 2007 after purchasing it from my local LCBO store. It poured a nice translucent gold calour into the glass with a large head that disappeared quickly into nothing. The aroma was very faint malt...very faint. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with high carbonation. The taste was awful, not sure how to describe it really. Almost has salt tones to it."
"From a 500 ml bottle. Poured straw yellow, with little head, and almost no lacing. Nose is fruity barley with just a hint of hops. Mouthfeel was quite weak. Flavor very mild. Very short and light finish. A very mild lager and actually drinkable, but certainly unremarkable."
"Overall its not gonna blow or socks off, but on a really hot day like today, its dam refreshing and very easy to drink."
"D-Not my favourite beer and probably not one i would seek out again. With no real style on the label I wasnt sure what to expect. I believe it was $1.59 for the bottle which isnt awful. Still with the relative obscurity of this beer the places that will sell it will probably have something better."
"Drinks easy, nothing complicated here, but better than BMC to be sure! May be able to score this cheap, but not sure it will always be in good shape. Better than the last time I had it,"
"Overall, very average beer. Wanted to try a beer with it's own Russian taste, not something that tastes like it's from a Busch assembly line."
"I might have 1 more, but that would be about it (after the novelty wore off!)."
"Very pale with an average head that leaves a lot of lacing on glass. Effervescence is good with lots of bubbles rising slowly until the end. Smell of grass, malt and a hint of citrus. Taste is similar to aroma and refreshing with a bit of tartness. i suspect it might be a bit of wheat in this one, since it leaves a fair bit of lacing and taste a bit tart. Light mouthfeel and easy to drink. This beer goes down well on a hot afternoon."
"Skol!"
"Drinkability/notes: Better than typical example of a Euro Pale Lager, well worth a try."
"Drinkable? Maybe. But only if your options are very limited."
"Nothing to get too excited about, but this is definitely above your average lager."
"Easy to drink and very refreshing. Little else."
"Thanks to Pegasus for sharing"
"Pours a crytal clear straw yellow, fizziness reminiscent of typical American mass produced lagers. Little to no hop aroma, some fresh grain. Taste is close to water with a splash of malt thrown in for kicks. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Could be a good lawnmower beer, but there's plenty of those around..no need to seek out this Russian"
"D- Felt pretty ill and thirsty again after 1 pint due to salty aftertaste and high carbonation. Very poor indeed, will never try again,"
"another beer from the Baltika Challenge. poured with a big old white head on a very thin orange beer. has more of a stink to it than baltika #2, sweet, some peat (!), ethanol. not super inviting. taste is slightly sweet malt, alcohol, kind of raw and unrefined....like a beer might taste if a russian guy was making it in his shed under fear of persecution. smooth, ok to drink but i wont buy it again."
"Looks a lot like Baltika #2- clear gold with a small white head. Nose is grains and very mild saaz hops, mostly corn, and a bit of earthiness. Maybe a hint of alcohol at the end of the nose, tied in with the earthiness, which is odd considering the low ABV. Taste is grains with some hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is better than #2, but still jsut average."
"All in all, not very impressed, I shall not be trying this beer again."
"Drinkability: Did I just drink this I can't remember?"
"This beer is pretty basic to me. It is alot like your typical American mass produced beer but with a little more punch to the taste and smell. Not bad but not great either."
"Taste is good, with light citrus taste. Somewhat sour, paste like aftertaste. Slight floral smell, quickly turning stale. Not a real bad beer, but there are some tastes and flavors that are beyond myself to determine."
"D- looks like a bud, smells like a bud, drinks like one too"
"Aftertaste bitterseet, faint. An easy-forgettable beer, and it's better to forget it."
"Ive appreciated and enjoyed some of Baltikas other fare, so I came into this brew with a pretty open mind. Unfortunately, theres few redeeming qualities with this beer. Its one of the few beers that Ive had that I can say that I really didnt enjoy. Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a fizzy head. The aroma is faint, with hints of maltgrain, and a vegetal and corn smell. It was not at all appealing. The taste isnt much better. Modest sweetness and grain with a little harshness. Watery, with a shallow finish. Unimpressive. I was glad to be finished with it."
"This is a boring lager. It lacked real flavor. I drank it, but would not seek out another. Not worth it...a substandard euro lager."
"I fancy this as a quaffing thirst quenching beer , and whilst not scaling great heights it is purposeful and something I wold drink again"
"Aroma holds a hearty bready mash of grains and hay. Pale yellow in color with a tight white thumb thick head. Fore is sweet honey laden malts followed by some grassy hops and a slightly vegetal finish. Yet another pale lager, but decently made and offensive other than a bit of cloying sweetness."
"Baltika 3 pours a pale yellow with a thick fluffy white head from a brown 16.9 ounce bottle. The aroma is slightly fruity, apple maybe. There is a little fruitiness in the flavor as well, malt and a bit of hop are also there. Doesn't do much for me, but compares favorably with other Euro lager type beers, at least this one doesn't have that Euro lager skunk flavor."
"500 ml bottle. Baltika 3 pours out a clear yellow with a small, fizzy, white head. Cereal grain and apple peel aroma. The flavor has a marked corn taste, with some candy sweetness and more apple peel. This certainly isn't the worst tasting Euro lager I've had, but there's something about it that makes me feel like gagging when I take a sip. It may be the corn flavor, of which I am not a big fan. The 500 ml bottle is a chore to work through. This is not a beer I'll try again."
"Pours a pale yellow, kind of straw coloured and clear, big fluffy white head forms, excellent retention and nice lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, with some honey, and a fresh floral hop aroma with a little citrus. Taste is subdued, but slightly malty, and citrus/floral hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not bad at all, the smell is pretty nice."
"Russian beers, it may be unfair to say, make me nervous. They always make me think of Chernobyl. Yes, I know that should make me fear Ukrainian beers but I have to admit that if I had any will-power or was even remotely concerned about standards I would avoid Russian-brewed libations like Stalin avoided freedom of the press. That said, tonight I poured myself, and rather enjoyed, a Balika Classic No.3. Nothing stupendously exciting but not too bad. And it is kind of cool to try something, other than vodka, from the world's largest country."
"500 mL bottle with best before June 1, 2006 on the label. It pours into the pilsner glass a thin gold that has a half inch bone white head that leaves some lacing. It smells of adjuncts, DMS, grainy or toasty malts, and maybe some corn husk and hops. It tastes about the same with maybe a bit of fruit and a mild bitterness. The body is light to medium, and tingly with a short finish. It's easy enough to drink but I won't be seeking this one out again."
"Drinkable, yes. It is what it is...a light euro lager. My wife and I are planning a pierogi party and I will be serving up some Eastern European brews, this will be one for the newbies."
"So, yeah, drinkable, but for a session brew, I would get the US standards at $6 sixers, instead of this one at $1.70 for 500ml."
"I'd get bored of this in a hurry."
"This beer looks alright and smells alright, pretty average for what style of beer this is, taste is pretty bland and fizzy, best way to describe it: ""It tastes like nothing"". Mouthfeel is similar to that of mineral water, not offensive but nothing really to call home about either. This beer however is very easy to drink as it goes down very very easily, like drinking a soda on a hot day. Overall, not too bad, but there are better offerings available."
"Drinkability: Not offensive, a little to sweet and not very strong tasting. OK."
"This is a pretty good international lager. No offensive flavors and a cool label. Worth a try but nothing special."
"Mouthfeel is thin and clean, very drinkable and thirst quenching. A good example of a standard lager, nothing earth-shattering but quite refreshing. This is something I could drink all day outside watching a ball game. (ABV 5.0%, as per the label.)"
"I got off to a rough start with this brewery and it continues. Avoid."
"Opinion: I don't have much to say about this beer. There is nothing really special about it except for the fact that it is clean and cheap. It has a better flavor than a lot of macro brews, but if I were to grab another beer, it would be something else."
"500ml can for $1.79 at Once Upon a Vine."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a rather tall and frothy head that leaves specks of lace behind on the walls of the glass as it recedes. Nose is fruity malts (mostly apple) along with some grassy hops. Taste begins with a light sweetness followed by some herbal notes and dry grains. A mild peppery hop bitterness comes across towards the finish. An average lagernothing more."
"There's a biggish, fluffy pillow: fine, almost white. Lazy streams of carbonation through the clear, pale gold beer. The aroma is apples and ink, but it's kind of nice. Grainsy-fruity front. Smooth, full, fruity buttery middle. A little flabby, not firm. Fresh, fairly bitter finish, but not really crisp. It's tasty. A little mushy, but not bad."
"I was all set to make a joke about how Baltika #3 was half as good as Baltika #6 (Porter), but that isn't the case at all. As EPLs go, it's pretty good. I've only had a few of their offerings so far, but if I was Russian, I'd drink a lot of Baltika beer. Especially given what else I've tasted from that neck of the woods."
"BB 11-8-05. Pale beercolor and not overwelming but lasting head. Nose is very papery, oxidised sweet malts and further quiet empty. As taste is, oxidised, fatty acids, sweetish, lowly bittered and very light. Makes mouthfeel even wth good carbonisation not plesant and drinkable but one I'll avoid in the future."
"The color is standard for a euro lager: pale yellow. Head is bright white and foamy. Carbonation is very low. The aroma is the standard grainy sweetness expected from the style, no green bottle equals no skunking. The taste has a sweet malt body with a mild honey-like flavor. Nice grain tastes and a hint of saaz-like hops kick in towards the middle of a sip. This is very full-flavored for the style, which makes Baltika #3 a pleasent surprize. A crisp mouthfeel gives this even more cache. Drinkability is high. I wish they sold this in cheap 12 packs so I could always have a few in the back of my fridge, especially during the summer."
"Pours a yellow color with tiny head that doesn't stay and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is grassy and slightly skunked. The flavor is really uninteresting. Tastes like a macro lager. Slight grainy flavor with a tiny bit of bitterness. Has a little caramel character as well. Not really bad, but not too good either. Doesn't leave a great aftertaste."
"Its about time I dranke this one. It pours a clear, pale yellow color with a 2 finger head that falls to a generous coating over the top. The nose is not too bad. Slightly grainey and grassy with just a slight hint of lemon crispness. The flavor is right there as well. Light grainey, but not offensive. Slight grassy hop profile. Very clean. The feel is light to moderate at best with an active carbonation. Drinkability is not all that bad either. This would be very refeshing after some hard work outside on a hot day."
"This is a freeway accident beer, you know, ""Move along, there's nothing here that concerns you"". I did enjoy Baltika's porter, but not this. Try it if you wish, but I'll pass on future ones."
"Average macro style high carbonation thin bodied beer. Goes down just like the rest, but I'm not a fan at all."
"An undistinguished lager."
"Overall- Is this the Budweiser of Russia?! Actually goes down better then Bud. Otherwise use for drinking games only."
"The flavor is as the nose suggests, with a sweet semi-grainy adjunct-enhanced malt, a light touch of hop flavor, and a supportive bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with some lingering sweet malt and a healthy dose of herbal hoppiness. It's well done and surprisingly drinkable considering its strength."
"Taste, aftertaste and drinkability: at first, it tastes quite flat and watery on palate and not any specific kind of taste seems to dominate, but later some smooth maltiness and medium-dry hoppyness are noticeable in the background. Overall its a simple, light-bodied (if not too thin), overly easy-drinking lager. I'm afraid that it's not quite impressive if one drinks this beer as the first taste of Russian products."
" Thin and watery, Im afraid. But thats what Ive come to expect form this style. Pretty much every one Ive had tastes like your average American macro lager (the only decent example of this style Ive found thus far is Sam Smiths Lager). Still, its by no means horrible; in fact, its thinness lends it a certain drinkability. Recommended only if your bored and/or you just need something to quench your thirst. Otherwise dont bother."
"Drinkability  The flavor was a bit off but overall it was a good drinker."
"Had a sample of this beaut at the Vintage Cellar for the Friday beer tasting they do. At any rate, this was a very nice beer. Started out kind of average, nothing special was happening, but then a nice wheat/malt/hop taste came about. Had it at room temp, so I think that helped it's taste along too. Very clean and crisp, very easy to drink. Would be a very nice beer to have a hot sunny day."
"Overall, not bad. I'd still take a German lager over this but a nice brew. Worth looking into..."
"Last and saddest of the 10 commie Lagers at the LCBO. Pours a very protirelin hazed pale straw color...small cap, moderate lace. Aroma: again with the veggies!!! what is this with the Ruski brews?....they got no barley??? >grainy corn tastes, weak body, sweet, fast finish no hops to speak of....bad beer..leave it on the shelf...its obscene cheap commie slop like this retails for over 2 dollars in Canada."
"Draft, St. Petersburg. Your standard issue beer for the proletariat. On my second sampling, I find some improvements from what I had originally written, though. Somewhat light in appearance, but still a pleasing gold, with a thin lagery head. The sugary taste I had on my first sample was absent the second time around, and there was a noticable hop balance; just to counteract the malt, with no eaxtra bitterness to spare. This is the most commonly available beer in St. Pete, and the brand that is most active in advertising and sponsorships. You can usually find a portable Baltika stand in front of most railroad stations and several trolley stops, with its blue and white identifiers."
"Like drinking water, with some beer flavorings added. Nothing interesting, but at the same time, it's got a solid appearance and is easily drinkable, even at it's lowest level."
"No one aspect stood out it was a very mellow with a honey and malt like taste. Overall not a bad beer."
"Overall, just an average lager. Won't have again, don't care much for it."
"A beer with the sophistication of Malt Liquor, the harshness of Euro Pils, and the price of an import. Avoid it."
"Moderate straw color. Aroma was slightly bready, with a hint of oxidation, but not enough to throw it off. Very clean and crisp, with moderate body. Flavor was pretty mainstream and conventional for a lager, with some light caramel malt flavor that tilted the balance ever so slightly to a malty character. Finish was pleasant, with sufficient residual hops bittering. Not the greatest lager I've had, but any U.S. macro would be proud to turn out a beer of this degree of quality."
"Bright, very clear, pale yellow colour. Thick head of snow-white foam reduced within a couple minutes to a moderately thick lace. Spicy noble hop aroma with some graininess and sweetness. Some sharpness due to high carbonation with a thin body. Sort of a weak flavour, with some spicy hops and malt sweetness with a slightly dry, bitter finish. Refreshing and light, with more flavour than your standard macro lager."
"Completely unremarkable brew. Must be the Russian Budweiser."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale malt scent with some Czech style hops and a dry lager yeast finish. The taste is average. It has a bland, yet slightly malty flavor with a sweet yet dry finish. It goes down easy, but it isn't as clean and crisp as a German lager. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average beer, nothing special. It has decent aroma that's all."
"An all right drinking beer. Better than Bud, not too bad on a hot day while mowing the lawn."
"baltika #3 pours goldenrod color with light lacy head that was huge for about 30 seconds then almost competely dissapeared. smells of saaz hops dominate with a steely undertone. also some corn in there. taste is alright. more flavor than expected. strong with the saaz hops with rusty iron and corn almost echoing the aroma. mouthfeel is medium light with a lot of carbonation. overall not a bad beer. good for a hot day. there a better beers for less money but, a decent one to check out in a sixer."
"The bartender at the russian bar I drank this at insisted that the russians had just began brewing beer 2 years ago and before that it was straight vodka ;)"
"Looking at the average score, no one seems to be vary impressed with this beer. I didn't think it was anything insanely good, but it's certainly on par with any european continental lager or pilsener. I did check the date on the bottle, whch was several months away, and pulled one of the bottles way in back on the shelf, so perhaps I got the best experience possible from a beer about halfway around the world. It's good, but with all the other choices with a nearly identical flavor profile, I doubt I'll buy this again."
"Good thirst quenching beer. Baltika 3 pours a pale gold, with a small film of a head. Sparce strings of lace stay on the mug. Smells, whoa. The hops are pretty evident in this beer. Very citrusy smell. Also smelled is barley and corn. Tastes a little bland. I was expecting more hops from the smell, but malt and corn seems to dominate the taste of this beverage. Still good. Bit sweeter than expected. Crisp, slightly coarse mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable. A good session brew, hot weather brew or just wanna have a brew brew."
"Taste, well, this beer brought hops to the table - nothing else to accompany or hide it either. It was a delicious bitter, but not very complex. I must commend it, however, for having a very long finish...stays on the tongue, goes the distance."
"And yes, once again I have been disappointed by a lager which tasted different on the first intake and on the second one- the latter being more soury tasting and corny, but never exiting the locked doors of the mediocre. I hold hope for the baltika family though, and its porter nr. 6."
"Appearance: Golden straw color of most macro brewed beer forms a tiny large bubbled head that dwindles very quickly does leave some lacing evenly rung thin and runny however. Aroma: Corn and hop burp aromatics this is a macroswill if I ever smelled one, only European style. Taste: Extremely dull and filled of adjuncts corn doesn't do it for me and a astringent European hop this is just blah. Mouthfeel: Carbonated water says it all. Drinkability: Pass on this one at least if it were their malt liquor I could say it has the alcoholic qualities."
"  bring back the Cold War!!!"
"Baltika #3 poured a clear, golden, pale color with a very big, yet thin head. The carbonation eased up a bit, leaving a sudsy appearance. Some nice lacing was left on the side of the glass. The smell was a weak blend of fruity and hoppy characteristics, with faint grass odors. For a pilsner, it tasted relatively watered-down, retaining only a bit of the common crispness for the style. Clean and easy on the palate, this beer isn't bad, but is disappointingly medicore. The mouthfeel adds to this general malaise...very thin and unfilling. Still, #3 was drinkable, although cheap American macros would deliver the same thing for far less. Luckily, this was a gift from a friend (to whom I am thankful for grabbing this during a recent trip to New York). I won't go out of my way to find this one on my own, though."
"The names of this outfit's beers (#1, #2, #3 . . . #10) are maybe reflective of the imagination they apply to their brewing. Sad and sorry."
"Pale clear yellow appearance, big 3/4 inch bright white and fluffy head that can be classified as rocky. Decent wandering drip laces. Aroma is faintly grassy with some honey on the side. Very sweet and scantly carbonated, again a floral honey combined with a sugar sweetened white bread presence. Hopping is limited at best, making me wonder how this meets a Pilsner classification -- but taken as a product this is decent ice cold, attractive. Not well-balanced or attenuated but very drinkable with a nice texture."
"Poured straw-yellow in color. Nearly clear in opacity. White foamy head formed quickly, but quickly fell and relocated to the edges of the glass. Efervescense is quite noticeable. The smell is of hops and green apples. Hop bite is the predominant flavor, with just a bit of malt before a nice dry finish. Bit of the green apple flavor is present, but took me a while to place it. Overall, though, pretty tasty. The mouthfeel isn't impressive or anything, but the carbonation is there to make the tongue happy enough. Really hits the back of the tongue. A tasty brew, but not really that good of a pilsner."
"This is a standard lager. Everything about it is standard. Not good, not bad, just average. It sits rather yellow in the glass, with a large but fizzy head that is gone before you know it. No trace of lace in this glass. Smell? Hmm... Yeah, I guess there's a smell here. Reminds me of ballpark beer. Tastes about like that, too. Maybe a touch of rice - the label denies the presence of anything like that - with a bit of carbonation and just the tiniest hint of hops. If this were all I could drink, I'd still drink beer, but a lot less of it. Blah!"
"A very light, almost straw colored lager that comes in a brown 16.9 ounce bottle with a foil covered cap. A very light, but dry and refreshing lager beer. Certainly better than the most popular domestic lagers sold in America. There's not much to this beer, but it on the dry side, and very clean tasting. If it were half as light it would be tonic water. At $1.38 a bottle it was a good buy for an import. I've had worse imported lagers for more money."
"The archetypal lager color a transpicuous golden yellow, the head portly in size, bright white in color, frothy in texture, the lace a thin covering sheet. Nose is crisp fresh and clean, all malt, start is lightly sweet and loaded with malt, top skinny in feel. Finish has a perky acidity, the hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste."
"Baltica: half a liter brown bomber bottle.  “certified by Green Cross” whatever that means (very busy label: ads, ingredients, warnings etc).  Clear bright yellow beer, with a mild hops aroma.   Malt tastes predominate early with a spicy hop finish that is clean and refreshing.  99 cents well spent."
"Notes: Not bad drinking at all, clean enough to enjoy though seems to be not filtered at all so as to hold on to some raw flavours. A perfect match with any boiled dinner."
