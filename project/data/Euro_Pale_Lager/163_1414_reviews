"This works fine as a thirst quencher, but is still a very plain Adjunct Lager. I did not see much difference from their Amstel light."

"O: A standard Euro Pale Lager - balanced and quite quenchable."

"This and Amstel Light were my import beers of choice when I was younger and I was limited to imports back in the States. As much as they have some bad reviews they bring back nostalgia and I would still rather drink them over Grolsch and Heineken. It was given to me in an Amstel glass. There was just the right amount of head and the lace had retainability over its transparent body. The aroma was crisp with mild sweet malt tones. The flavor is average for this style. Basic crisp, pils style lager. Mouthfeel is thin and watery."

"The curiousity is cured, but my mouth would like a different beer next. Amstel Lager might just be a novelty item for American tourists like me who (thankfully) can't get this version stateside."

"O: This beer is a basic pilsener but it is very easy to drink."

"Medium-light in texture, there's the tendency to want to read higher level of fullness due to the slightly more substantial malt balance and residual grain sweetness. But the body is light and refreshing to complement island foods well. But in subsequent session, the timid hop balance leaves the beer unsupported and the sweetness fatigues the palate quicker than a lighter beer should."
"D/O- Good for what it is I suppose. Drinkability is high if you don't get a headache. Amstel, and Heineken for that matter, always reminds me of ""wannabe beer snobs"" for some reason. Thanks for bringing this back from South America sister."

"Better than the really standard stuff on tap places, but not sure I would pick it over other popular on-tap beers here in South Africa (Peroni, etc.)."

"I don't know, I used to like it when I was younger but now it would be my last choice among the other dutch commercial beers. I'll give it a high overall mark, just for all those moments we spend together.."

"O: Typical Euro Lager. Makes Heineken taste good."

"overall, a bit chemical-tasting, but much cleaner and crisper than the standard pale lager - is it the can vs. green bottle, is it being in Europe vs. the US? considering it is cheaper than most similar Spanish lagers, it is a clear step above."
"o - Drinkable but forgettable. Marginally better than the standard SAB lagers available in South Africa."
"Of all the beers I had in Holland, the pint of Amstel I had after a hot summer day of walking through Amsterdam for the first time is still one of the most memorable - and not memorable for the wrong reasons. It was cold, clean, ordinary and refreshing - what more could I ask of it? It would be far from the best beer I had that trip, but it did the trick when called upon."
"A very typical beer. I purchased this often in Europe because it was cheaper then most while still offering a drinkable liquid. Pours a little head that dissapates quickly. Does not taste very good at all but is still doable if there is a shortage of options and/or money. Heineken is probably a little better but not by a long shot."
"I really, genuinely love this stuff, it has a good taste, and is very refreshing. Also unlike Fosters it doesn't smell like stale urine!"
"Taste, light, easy to drink, slight Saaz hop feel to it, not discernably different than the light version we get in the states. Uplifting, refreshing, just enough caramel to it. Overall, pricy, but one of the more enjoyable beers in the style. Have no idea why it isn't available in the states. Nothing groundbreaking, but sometimes we're in the mood for an easy drinking, lightly hopped beer."
"Dr: Affordable, but garbage. Don't waste yer time with this one, lads. Grab a Pacifico instead, at this price range."
"A very standard pale lager."
"Everyone knows what these lagers are about: have some and watch a game with some friends."
"D: Not the best Euro lager out today."

"D - . Don't think I couldnt drink more than a 24oz of this stuff. Would only drink this if my options were terrible or if I was given some free at a party. :)"
"Much better than the ghastly Light version. Poured with a huge foamy, frothy, sudsy, fluffy, white head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow gold with some bubble trails. Aroma is a mild skunk hop malt. Flavor is more bitter than sweet, but still not a lot there. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and short. Drinkable beer if other options aren't so good."
"This beer is pretty blah, but it has no off weird flavors, so it goes down easy on a hot day."
"This beer is huge in Greece, It was everywhere. Had it a few times on draft in Rythmno, Crete. Kind of a soft, delicate aroma and flavor, nothing mind-blowing, but quite nice. There was a lasting flowery impression from the gentle hops. Granted, it was overall not a really exciting beer, but it exceeded my expectations quite a bit."
"Not really super nice as easy to drink beer, but because it has a fairly feeble bitterness and especially an insignificant price. Levels flavors, this is a stupid european lager unpretentious which differs from other models by an aftertaste a bit suret and somewhat artificial to suggest that the egg a little acid. Not really relevant to a true beer lover."
"D: This is a great summer beer, and even a good spring beer. Pretty refreshing with a nice beery taste. No nonsense. A solid euro pale that I drink a lot of here in Bulgaria."
"Drinkability: Water is drinkable I guess???"
"Overall, nothing to write home about. But a couple of notches above its cousin Heini, worth the weight on a hot, sunny day."
"D: average drinkability for a Euro pale lager, as this sits at around 4-5% ABV."
"The head is very nice after i poured the bottle in a dutch vase. The beer is best when it's cooled in a fridge."
"Cheers!"
"Stay clear of it, there's hundreds of beers more worthy of the name out there."
"Overall: Not my favorite pilsner, but way better than Hollands most famous pilsner, heineken. I really don't like the metallic taste in this beer. But after being ""forced"" to drink Amster-lite before the match, this is way better."
"Not a beer for the connoisseur but a decent cheap lager nevertheless."
"Not a whole lot to say about this beer, I had it at the airport in Athens and it really wasn't anything especially good or bad. It is similar to Heineken with a less bitter finish and aftertaste and more sweet malt. Carbonation is pretty high and the body is medium/thin."
"Watery and weak feeling to this beer, not impressed at all. I remember this beer before Amstel was taken over by Heineken, it has gone down hill since those days in the 1970's."
"D: This beer isn't very exciting, but I enjoyed it for what it is. I hate to keep comparing it, but it reminds me a lot of Heinekin. It's Saturday night, so I think I will have another, cheers."
"Lightly bodied and more watery than some other lagers. No better or worse than Heineken for example, but not good either."
"A good example of the Eurolager style."
"M&D: the palate comes slightly too fizzy and becomes a bit watery in the end, although the body doesn't fall too thin overall. This Bulgaria-brewed Amstel is a pretty bland offering, but I thank my dear flatmate for her kindest gesture all the same!"
"Pours with a reddish tinge to its yellow. A little white head. Taste is corny, a tad of carmel. Mostly astringent to me, very thin mouthfeel, and a couple of ounces is too much.Very light carbonation. Smell is neutral.Thanks for bringing Mr. Russev.Not too good."
"This Dutch Brew comes in a nice looking bottle and pours a clear yellow. A short lived head is light beige and fizzy. The nose is quite dull, but possibly has some grassy malts. The taste is of stale bitter hops with a subtle grain presence. Body was light with lot sof carbonation. Just another well marketed lager."
"R- Not impressed, i cant seem to get any good beers on this vacation!!!"
"Aftertaste is short and fruity."
"Probably very drinkable to those who just want a refreshing brew. Not interesting enough to keep my interest"
"Review added 12-10-2007, translated from french 1-13-2008"
"Pours a clean, pale yellow with a white head. Aromas of a sweet malt and a small pilsner hop. In the taste, a clean malty sweetness. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweet malt aftertaste. Refreshing, small hop in the nose, smooth and easy drinking. Better than expected."
"Overall: not unpleasant but not very good either. Refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability - i remember thinking this was good about 3 years ago. How the palate changes. A watered down, poor example of the style. Will never have another Amstel if i can help it."
"A sister of heineken, this came near from the amstel river, little more good than heineken, and grolsch, but good for the Mexican, special common drinker with Mexican food, and talk it with friends. good body, defined flavor. it is present at not so hard of the bitterness characteristic of American lager; new in my country, recommendable 75%."
"My parents bought this back from Aruba, MUCH BETTER than the Amstel Light we have here and I don't even think that is so bad. Subdued golden color with decent carbonation, lightly hopped actually very refreshing since you can taste hops and not all grain like other lagers of this variety, this actually isn't half bad at all. Smooth and drinkable, nothing earth-shattering but a pleasent surprise."
"This beer pours a nice golden yellow-orange color, with about one finger worth of pale white head. It smells a bit tart and malty.. It has a mildy bitter/tart taste, very good.. It's sort of like a less bitter (actual Dutch) Heineken, which is a good thing. The mouthfeel is pretty good, with plenty of carbonation. I'd say this is a very drinkable beer, though I'd have to go to Holland again to get more. Please note this review is of the Amstel Bier available in Holland, not the Amstel Lager export variety."
"My cousin went all the way to Austria and brought this back. Live and learn."

"A pretty dull euro lager overall it seems"
"Nothing special but it is capable of quenching your thirst on a hot day. The head and aroma were on par with each other - teetering on non-existance. Not possessing an abundance of flavour the taste is typical of European macrobrewed quaffs. The aftertaste is slightly better, and may be the best thing Amstel has going for it, and can be described as dry and slightly bitter. I can't honestly say I hated it but I can't recommend it, either."
"And what's worse is I've got one bottle left of this nasty stuff."
"shockingly bad beer. theres only one thing i can truly say about this brew that is worth knowing. i didnt know they would bother to brew a VB equivalent overseas, but here 'tis. a total stinker, this is even worse than oranjeboom. there is no doubt amstel is the worst imported euro lager going around. bad and even beneath that."
"I found Amstel to taste very similar to Heineken (Not the same, just similar). The main selling point of this beer in Australia is its price. A box (24 bottles) of Amstel is ~$A30 while a box of Heineken is closer to $A50. With this price difference my pick is Amstel."
"One of the most known beers around but yet one of the least impressive. I don't know in other countries but here in Cyprus, because so few people are really interested on beer, they consider it one of the best. I totally disagree. Nothing special to offer."
"Good, not great.  A rather plain tasting beer.  But that doesn't mean that it's bad either.  Has a decently strong flavor without being too heavy."
"Boring beer which tastes like heineken, just  another lager really, boring as hell, but i suppose you could drink it."
