"Not one of my favorites. The appearance was a clear yellow color with a soft one finger white foamy head that quickly dies down to a film in the center of the beer . The smell had some cooked corn with a cereal - like content. The taste was somewhat sweet for what was there. On the nose and palate, this was somewhat of a macro brew skunk with a watery corn aftertaste."

"The beer is clear and golden with an inch of white head. The aroma is weak, offering grains, malt, sweetness. Crisp and clean. refreshing, though too grainy. Notes of corn and sweet alcohol. A beer for the masses, or to be consumed for free while gigging at a place such as this. I'm just glad guys like me can drink beers like this while playing music like that for people like them."

"Watery without any real taste. Drinkable if ice cold."

"Not particularly nice. It looks pretty good, however the aroma is a non-event and the flavour is weak and plagued by unpleasant off-notes. Average body for the style. Too much grain in the flavour - where is the crisp character and spicy noble hops that distinguish a quality lager? No need to hunt this down; spend your money on something good...."

"overall: when in Rome, stick with the wine. this is a great reason to have limochello instead of an after dinner brew when on the boot."

"SNAP! A crisp lager with a crisp feel in the mouth. Closest cousins are its Euro neighbors to the north, Beck's and St. Pauli Girl. Peroni is the official beer of Olive Garden - order it instead of their crummy wines that come in a screw-top bottle."

"On tap at an Italian chain restaurant. Comes to the table a clear straw yellow color with a decent off white head that leaves spotty lacing. Smells of grainy malt a light floral hops. The flavor is as lackluster as the aroma. Light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Barely better than a Bud, but technically defect free, unless you consider a lack of flavor a flaw."

"O- This is a very simple and decently refreshing beer, and it does not have any major flaw. Among industrial pale lagers, it almost feels like a gem"

"Not special at all but it is funny that most people don't know this beer while they think that the Nastro Azzuro is the one and only Peroni. But this one is the standard non-'premium' version that is, as far as I know, not sold outside of Italy."
"Not much nose, strong taste watery. It's actually very close to water but with a bitter-sweet side unpleasant. The bitterness in the finish is, it, dirty and artificial, which does not give value to the ordinary lager. Persistent non-existent. Not much to put under the tongue, even if we take into account that this is just a classic lager."
