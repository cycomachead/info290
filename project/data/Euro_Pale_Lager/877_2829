It has a fuller body than most euro lagers, and it tastes much how you would expect from the smell: smooth, mellow, and sweet, but with enough balance to keep it drinkable.

2.65,-18.7,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Tried the River Horse Unfiltered Lager on a whim. I had high hopes at first. The initial taste is full of flavor--maybe a little subtle malt/biscuit flavor but as it goes down, it becomes very average. Also, too carbonated for my taste. Appearance and smell also unremarkable.

3.12,-4.3,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"D: Decent drinkability, but not exactly a brew that will wow you. I'd like to think it's probably better for a beer to bore you, than for a beer to make you want to drain pour it. That's where this one resides; it's just plain.","irishking1977","Jan 30, 2010"

4.03,23.6,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,"River Horse Lager pours a hazy light gold with a thin and quickly disappearing head. The aroma is sweet pilsner malt with hints of fresh baking break and herbal hops. The flavor is sweet and malty, without being as cloying as I expected from the aroma. There are some herbal hops in the flavor, but the bitterness is light to non-existant. Overall, this is a pretty solid beer, not too much to intimidate a BMC drinker, with enough flavor to please a craft beer drinker.","ericj551","Dec 30, 2009"
3.3,1.2,4,4,3,3,3,"Poured form a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a hazy dark star color, with small, but pretty pure white foam head. There is visible carbonation rising in the glass. The beer is unfiltered, so the haziness is expected. There is some earthy yeast is the nose, as well as a hint of citrusy hops. There is some acidic sweetness in the flavor, kind of like lemon, but not quite. You can also taste some bread-dough flavored yeast. There is sweet malt in the aftertaste. The beer has a light body and a lot of carbonation that kind of distracts as you taste the beer. All of the sweetness makes for some mouth coating. This beer looks really promising, until you actually taste it. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer, there are just a lot of other pale lagers that I like more.","ToasterChef","Dec 25, 2009"
3.53,8.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,4.5,"D-This is one that's really quite easy to drink. I could see having quite a few of these in a night, even more so if the taste was a little more complex.","samie85","Dec 18, 2009"
2.93,-10.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"The worst beer of the mixed 12 pack by this brewery but still not too, too bad overall.

I've definitely had better euro pale's but this one is a decent shot at one... drinkable, but not the best tasting thing you'll try.","oriolesfan4","Nov 28, 2009"
3.53,8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed on 8/27/09. Bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet floral hops, lagery carboardy malt. Flavor is sweet initially with citrus and light fruits and a malty finish. Pretty decent beer and great for a pale lager. Very refreshing.","LilBeerDoctor","Oct 12, 2009"
3.4,4.3,3,3,3.5,3,4,"M/D - Somewhat silky body with a full mouthfeel, not shocking for an unfiltered American brew. Flavor lingers at the end of each sip. Easy to drink, went well with Thanksgiving dinner but not something I would look for as a daily drinker.","magnj","Aug 26, 2009"
3.87,18.7,4,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The explosive, overactive texture in the mouth is definitely detracting... coupled with the bold flavor, it becomes a bit noisy for the palate to relax and enjoy.

3.3,1.2,4,4,3,3,3,"Solid is the word I begin and end with... interesting citric aroma--clove and softer hops present a welcoming fragrance... golden effervescent body in a pilsner glass, head is thick, creamy lingering with a finger of depth... full-bodied, easily drinkable, with slight carbonation engaging the throat... banana notes lead the tastebuds of this generally roundedm malty lager...as a sampler filler, serviceable... as a stand-alone, not worthy mentioning in the same breath as any of the major lager players...not watered down, but not lively or intriguing enough to warrant another bottle unless circumstance forced it so... solid.","dacrza1","Jun 04, 2009"
2.9,-11,3,3,2.5,4,3,"D: Overall, a fairly nice mouthfeel and taste combination. Nothing to get overly excited about here as the lager finishes smooth, but was a little on the bland side. A little bit more sweet malt backbone and this beer could be much better.","maddogruss","May 25, 2009"

3.6,10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy golden color with a small tight white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of light hay, some green apple and lemon. The taste is sweet, not cloying or anything close to that but kind of a sugar sweetness. Some hay or grass flavor, perhaps a touch of grain. A light body with plenty of carbonation, quite fizzy, maybe too much carbonation. Starts and finishes sweet. Quite a unique lager, IMO not a Euro lager in any regards. I don't know much about this brew but I would say that it has some wheat malt in it. The back of the label seems to suggest this. A sweet lager, though not that sweet. Different but easily drinkable.","Gmann","Apr 21, 2009"
3.16,-3.1,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Golden hue with tumultuous body and exceptionally large white foam head. An unpleasant grass, hay, hops in the nose.

3.17,-2.8,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a yellow, clear color, but with a surprisingly full, thick head. Looked fairly generic. The smell was mostly malty, with a pinch of spicy hops, but overall also kind of generic. The taste was similar to the smell. The beer was dominated by malts and grains, but ended with a little bit of dry hoppiness (but not really any bitterness). However, there was a light, sweet presence in the aftertaste that did separate this beer from some standard marco brew. It was well carbonated, with a thin mouthfeel, which left me the overall impression that this was just a micro version of an average, light session beer.","micahgoldfus","Oct 31, 2008"

3.07,-5.8,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"When poured into a standard Victory pint glass, this River Horse is a clear sunshine yellow that had a miniture head of fizzy white bubbles. It only took these fizzy white bubbles to fizzle away into a few rings along the edge and if you're lucky, a spot or two of lace. It had a solid burnt aroma of toasted malts, citrus fruits, citrus hops, and it finished up with a little lemon zest. It had a crispy taste that contained toasted malts, a small slice of lemon, a few more citrus fruits, and then it ended with some spicy and dry floral hops. It was clearly a light bodied beer with a crispy and dry aftertaste of floral hops and a touch of toasted caramel malts. It was really nothing more than your run of the mill clean fresh session lager.","AltBock","Feb 24, 2008"

The finish was also mildly sweet, but lacking a really good lager flavor.

Grain and grass are first notable in the aroma, followed by a bit of caramel. Not much hops in the aroma, but they do come through in the taste. Its a moderately-dry brew, with a lot of graininess. Seems to have a cereal grain and husk-like quality that doesnt really fit with the flavor. Also, it has a thin, meager body.

It goes down easy and finishes sweet and slightly dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent lager.

2.85,-12.6,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Fresh batch delivered from the brewery 1 week ago. Quite hazy, but it does not appear to have been bottle conditioned. No yeast particulate can be found in either the bottle or the glass - this is some serious chill-haze! Yellow golden in color with a creamy white head that drops quickly but keeps a good collar and light surface coating. The aroma is not off-putting, but somewhat odd. No real malt character is noticeable, and there are no hops to speak of. The body is medium with a fine, moderate carbonation that is somewhat dull in the mouth. The flavor is of a quasi-dryish maltiness supported by an underlying bitterness. No hop flavor is discernable. It's well balanced but lacking in finesse as neither the malt or the hops come through. It's also kind of soapy which may explain things. I'm guessing that this is a bad batch due to insufficient rinsing following a caustic cleaning leaving an abundance of fatty acids and an increase in pH due to residual caustic residue. I'll have to revisit this beer, but it is fresh and it was delivered to the distributor by one of the owners. The packaging is in perfect condition, so I have to assume that there's nothing unusual about this (not an old or returned case going back out to the public) - it's just a bad batch. However, since I hate to put this up I will make an extra effort to re-review it this week.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
