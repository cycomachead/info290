"Pours a golden-yellow in color with a thin white head that settles down mostly along the sides. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. Lots going on with the aroma as there is grass, yeast, honey, herbal and some honey. Pretty much the taste follows the nose with some malts and hops in the mix as well. A slight bitter finish is noted but doesn't linger. Medium-bodied and higher carbonation as there is a lot of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom and sides of the glass. Overall, it wasn't bad."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, K3012G bottle code. Pours fairly crystal clear bright gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and light yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Flavors are very clean as well with no overly estery yeast notes. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale lager style. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"9/6....tallboy can into a glass. The ""reserve"" is far superior to the standard pils.  Light colored, white foam. Nice pils-y taste. But more body than the adjunct version."

"Flavor: nice combination that mirrors the aroma. Toasted white bread, some grassy flavors, and some mild lingering hop bitterness."

"Overall: A bit rough around the edges, the flavor seemed to change from the first sip to the last. Didn't really care for the inconsistency."
""
""
"The biggest issue, in my opinion, is that it is very flat tasting. There was no head after pouring this beer and I see no signs of carbonation within the glass. This leaves something desired on the palate when drinking."

"O- Not good not bad, and does remind me of a junior version of say Grolsch."

"Pours a clear golden orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with a definite malt and hop presence but it's pretty bland and gets much less drinkable as it warms up in my opinion."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and seems a little bland but doesn’t have any offensive aromas or flavors."
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer. For a macro lager, it is surprisingly clean and tasty, as well as eminently drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice clear slightly darker than average lager color, with a bright white head that stays for a bit. Little bit of lacing. Smell is sweet grain but its a bit deeper than expected. Slightly floral earthy hops balance out the nose. Taste is very balanced and impressive. Clean, sweet grain dominates the palate and finishes dry with a slight earthy hop bitterness. Carbonation and mouthfeel are appropriate and enjoyable. Good stuff for the style and I'd have one whenever an easy-drinker is needed. Especially against regular Sapporo and other rice lagers."
""
""
""
""
"Session beers don't get much better than this when it comes to Lagers and unlike Pabst, this didn't have any potato chip-like starch in the mouthfeel. While this didn't blow me away, I'd have another of these over mass-market examples of this style and would love to try it with some Japanese fare. The world needs more beers like this that are light in hue but filling enough in taste and body, as a reminder that not all Lagers need to feel smelly and watered-down."
""

"Sapporo Reserve pours an orange color with an off white head from a gold and silver twenty two ounce can. The aroma is mild, spicy hops dominate. The flavor is quite nice, spicy hops well balanced with malt. This is a very light bodied beer, but is leagues better than most macro lagers. Easy to drink and tasty."
""
""
"I'm giving this beer average marks because I don't think its intended to be a something that you just kick back with and down a few. It is similar to standard macro lagers but with the offensive elements noticeably missing. I'd drink this over most macros any day but it would never be my first choice."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid lager from Sapporo. A bit sweeter and more complex than their Original Draft offering; the difference in quality ingredients is obvious."
""
""
""
""
"Usual medium light body with a not to zesty level of carbonation, this is quite drinkable. I like."
"Overall, this is pretty much a failure all around. It lacks direction and purpose, it's not good alone, and I have to imagine it would be a disaster with almost any kind of food. I would not purchase this again."
""
""
"this is the beer i reach for when i want a regular beer. perfect size, $3 for 22 oz, and doesnt overwhelm the senses. just a great regular beer. first class."
"Nice beer that goes down very easy. Fairly bland but was still enjoyable. Compliments Japanese cuisine very well. Quite good for the style."
""
""

"Not a shabby Euro pale lager, could use a bit more hops, but the malt claim is justified, and I had no problem putting back the can after the warmth of this day. Sassy contoured can too - jeez, can environment have that much affect on a guy's beer senses? Apparently so."

"It's not bad, it's like a typical party where you know what is going to happen, and at the end of the night you are happy, but there were no surprises that left you ecstatic. Overall it is a 3.5."
"RJT"
"M - Light bodied with good carbonation."

"Overall: Eh. This is a small step above bud. I was really hoping for a nice big step from a name like this with it's pushing of its euro hop and all malt bill, but it's fallen short."

"Absolutely nothing special, but a well-made lager. Seems like more mouthfeel than most. And the gold and silver can always makes me feel like I've drinking something rare and expensive."
"O: this is great. By far the best Japanese beer I've ever had."
"This is a pale yellow brew with decent head, clean crisp taste no aftertaste lingering to spoil your sashimi! This is the best from Japan I've tried so far!"
"The sixth entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear pale yellow straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises rice, wheat, and soap. And that's it. The taste has nothing constructive to add to this discussion, unless you consider a few bits of minerals constructive (which, clearly, I don't). The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a kinda crisp, dry finish. Overall, a light, airy beer that doesn't seem to have much else to offer but its lightness."
"This beer pours a pale golden color. The smell is puffed rice almost exclusively. The flavor is upsettingly rice filled. It's sticky sweet rice. Overall I really really don't find this to be preferential. Unadviseable if you truly like beer."
"Drinkability/overall- I have to say overall this beer was better then what I expect having never really tried it before, its a solid lager with nice balance that would go very well with many foods and still have enough flavor to be decent on its own,"
"I got this can at a St Louis store next to some other interesting imports. It was not bad. Smell was just ok, taste was malty but has a watery taste in their somewhere exposing it's cheapness. Overall I liked it for a good cheap drink with friends but its nothing special. The price was the point and this beer is right with other adjunct beers."
"Pours a very clear and pale yellow color. Barley malt is very evident in it's scent hinting that this might have a cheap beer taste. The taste is mild and rather malty. Rather simple and nothing all that special considering it's from Japan. Something new to try from a different country, but considering it's taste...you could go with Pabst Blue Ribbon and not be missing much."
"This beer pours dark honey golden in color with half an inch of pure white foamy head that leaves light to medium lacing down the glass. The aroma is clean, grain, a bit of straw, some zesty hoppiness and a slight metallic tone. The taste is a wave of grainy malt followed by a bitter hoppiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but finishes well-carbonated to the point of stinging the tongue. This beer is a simple, basic, lager that would best be had with some salty, tart or spicy food."
"Notes: It's a good clean lager and an uplifting palate cleanser opposite my pineapple fried rice."
"D: Not my favorite style, but I think this is a good interpretation of it. Clean crisp without a lot of the typical 'bad' flavors associated with the style. It tastes well made, even if it is not my cup of tea."
"drinkability; nothing special, dinkable but not impressive."
"Slightly hazed pale yellow colored body with a bright white thicket of head dwindles slowly even chunky specks of lacing. Aroma has nice cereal notes, pale malts all grain served from a 22 ounce can. This thing is bad ass and sturdy much like the Sapporo Premium can but this one has all malt beer written on it. Nice full on malt profile light biscuit/hints of cracker with herbal grassy finishing hops much better than the average Japanese lager. Carbonation is sturdy body is light but not thin, I'm liking this stuff. Overall drinkability is solid a beer that would go well with a specialty sushi roll or by itself. Affordable on 3 bucks a can, definitely worth it for a 22 ounce portion."
"Drinkability: A pretty typical import aiming at the mainstream U.S. market. I got this to accompany some sushi, but it did not compliment it particularly well. I was hoping this would be an amped up rice lager but its closer to an adjunct lager. I'd take Kirin or Asahi over this any day."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain, oranges, lemons and some metal. The majority of the aroma is taken up by the grain, but the citrus hides in the back and occasionally makes an appearance. The flavor is a mix of grassy hops, bready malt and grain. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing exciting about the beer, but it is not bad."
"D: I was quite impressed with this beer. A definite step up from the typical import rice lagers."
"Pours a typical clear golden yellow with a decent white head. Aroma is quite strong and malty, not complex but still inviting. Flavor is strong and malty, enjoyable if not complex. This is a good accompaniment to a meal rather than a ""stand alone"" beer. Texture is quite tingly and fizzy."
"Crystal clear, gold colour with a thin layer of fine white bubbles. Lacing was sticky and spotty, decent head retention. Soft malt aroma, a bit of hop spice, delicate fruity esters. Low bitterness, nice malty backbone, with lingering hops (floral and spicy). Medium bodied, off dry, moderate and slightly crisp carbonation. This is pretty solid and quite drinkable. I'm actually impressed with the recent Sapporo beers that I've had. Maybe I'm getting them fresher now - I guess Guelph isn't too far away."
"Notes: I'm very impressed with this beer. It has good flavors and is very smooth."
"overall this beer is shit dont buy it!!! the beer is telling you its all barley malt and clearly its not all barley its adjunct crap!"
"This was ok. Not bad, but I won't pick it again."
"This is good for the style, and a completely capable brew. I wouldn't mind being confined to this for a night....could be heaps worse."
"Again, very little hop flavour here, but it IS there. Slightly spicy and reminiscent of Noble variety hops. A real grainy texture with clean malts, the beer is just a little sweet but mostly very crisp and very dry. It's a lot better than I thought it would be judging by scent alone. Prickly carbonation is a little rough, but overall a decently drinkable beer."
"Well done, land of the rising sun."
"D: This is very solid stuff from Sapporo. One of the best beers to be had in the Euro lager category."
"Drinkability: excellent, a decent session beer for a malt liquor."
"D: I could drink this all night. Very easy to drink, pleasant tasting and not overly carbonated. I think this is my favorite Japanese brew so far (even if it is brewed in Canada -- tricky ""import"" advertising!)"
"Taste is slightly sweet-malted with an equally coppery taste, no big surprises, very mild but well balanced hoppy finish. medium bodied, medium carbonated, medium medium average."
"D - Not a bad beer. A few small tweaks here and there could be made, but it's fairly well-balanced and pretty drinkable. It wont be poured out, I'll put it that way."
"Sweet silver and gold can. Pours a clear gold color with a big fluff head, tiny bubbles and good sticky webs of lace. Smells pretty clean, alittle sweet with some grainy aromas. Tastes decently crisp and clean, almost detect hops, slightly sweet and bitter. Id say it feels fairly light and is very drinkable provided it doesnt warm up, definitely better than Sapporo Premium and i wouldnt mind this again. One thing i noticed though is this is brewed in Canada which upsets me alittle, as i thought this was from japan."
"D: Well, I guess I can say I've finally tried it, but it's nothing to write home to the mainland about..."
"cheers!"
"A nice light lager though will likely not pursue this beer."
"D: Seems like a solid session beer. Not amazing, but definitely a decent beer overall."
"Poured from a 22 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smells of malts and grains. Tastes of barley and malts, not overly flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer, but nothing spectacular."
"The taste is a decent, somewhat full-bodied basic pale lager with light grain character, a little apple, and light vague hops, generally grassy and somewhat spicey with faint hints of lemon. It has light sweetness before a light, spicey, faintly grassy bitterness takes over by the finish and dominates it, with a light lingering aftertaste of spicey, lightly grassy bitterness and faint sweet cracker. The elements don't mesh fairly well and they seem to clash a bit, especially the bitterness, which tends to stand out all by itself when drunk without any food. It's fairly enjoyable and the bitterness and what character it has hold up well with certain foods, but it's really rather bland and thin, with a slightly rough feel. I would have no problem drinking this again, but have no desire to drink it alone or seek it out."
"Thinking of it like this, while in Vegas I asked one of the waitresses by the pool what beers they had. They fired the usually array of lagers - Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite, Heineken, Sapporo Reserve, and Corona. Being a beer nerd, there was only one choice...."
"drinkability is good. for a pale lager, this is fresh enough, but leaves a bit to be desired. the profile is a bit bland, but ends up pleasant on the palate. this could easily get stale, which the can obviously protects, but the lager yeast character sustains the pale malts and lightly sweet profile. cheers!"
"Drinks okay, this would be alright some sashimi, other-wise pass"
"Taste is grainy and biscuity. A touch of hop bitterness on the finish and even some hop flavor give it a nearly pilsner-like feel. It is smooth going down the hatch and feels a bit creamy....it's pretty easy to drink, really. One of the better Asian lagers I have had, but still pretty run of the mill."
"D-An OK drinker....but I like the can better than the beer."
"Notes: I enjoyed this beer and will look upon it for future purchase."
"I like this one better than most Japanese lagers. It compliments Japanese cuisine pretty well."
"It is crisp but not quite refreshing. Not much of a finish, but it is drinkable."
"Sapporo Reserve is a maltier version of Sapporo; nice and light and crisp, but the extra malts add flavor. Nice head from the pour, but not much smell at all. Medium carbonation and average color. Overall this just an average beer, but it tastes better than a regular Sapporo. It was the best option at a sushi place and I would drink it again."
"Poured a super clear golden straw color with a surprisingly frothy white head that stuck around for quite awhile. Awesome lacing. There isn't much to the aroma. Clean and malty. Tastes like a euro lager but with some tasty but low key hop flavor. This is one super clean and crisp brew. The malt is fairly sweet. The carbonation is sharp to the tounge. The feel is medium but slightly drying. Very refreshing beer. If the sushi joint has this and the regular sapporo by all means get this. I mean its nothing outta this word but its solid and sushi joints usually have piss like tiger beer or kirin ichiban."
"Atmosphere is ok. Appearance is decent, but nose (although outstanding) is a little unusual. Flavor is alot like the nose. Not bad, but takes a little getting used to. Feel is serviceable, but you have to get past the aftertaste. Some may enjoy the distinctiveness, but not my favorite style. However, when it's all said and done, it's a serviceable quaff."
"Much preferred over many other Japanese lagers."
"The smell and appearance were about average, being similar to the regular Sapporo. The taste was slightly below average, with a noticeable imbalance in its blend of maltiness and crisp lightness. The same imbalance led to its distinct mouthfeel, for lack of a better word. The drinkability, however, was atrocious. I had to give it to my roommate to finish, as I could literally not finish more than a quarter of the hardcore can."
"This was definitely the best of a recent tour of Asian beers I took (all without leaving Wisconsin), but that is still not saying all that much. This beer pours a darker color than regular Sapporo, which is something that you might expect from a beer called ""reserve."" This beer offers some up nice maltiness, which came to me as a baking bread aroma and flavor. More than I expected, but hardly terric."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's not an offensive beer, but maybe just not my style really."
"Definitely give it a shot."
"Trying to review this beer for what it is- a macro in a can. I know it's great with sushi and spicy food. Sapporo reserve has its place in the beer pantheon. You can drink a TON of this."
"Huge three finger head of eggshell white foam brimmed the top of my glass after I aggressively poured the can in. Slowly the head faded back to a thin layer of medium to small sized bubbles. The brew itself is sunflower yellow, (the same yellow as the bottom of the Reserve can - good marketing!) and crystal clear with some visible carbonation. Aroma is dominated by yeast though I do detect a metallic undertone. Flavors are distinctly better than regular Sapporo; definitely an evolved version of the same beer. Slightly sweet hints of malt first touch my taste buds followed by the grainy yeast and barely then the cutting hops. The finish is the same distinctly metallic flavor noted in the aroma and it really takes a lot away from the beer. A shame really because I would not have another for this reason nor can I recommend it as a good example of the style."
"Bought one on a business trip to enjoy in the hotel room with my Tex/Mex from Chilis. Not a bad option, but it wasn't quite as good as I thought it might be. Bright yellow in the hotel glass, with a decent pale head--a lot of head at first, but it didn't last long. Malt in the nose with a subtle (if present at all) hops bitterness. The grain was immediately evident in the taste but so was a strange metallic aftertaste that just left me wondering why. Wasn't as good as I had hoped."
"D: I enjoyed this one quite a bit. A very tasty lager that pairs very well with Sushi. Head and shoulders above Sapporo's rice lagers."
"Very cool looking can which is probably an enticement in itself. Poors a deep golden color with superb clarity and a rocky head. Malty aroma, subtle. Taste is malty with a slight hoppiness present, a little on the sweeter side which affects the crispness a bit. A little less sweetness would benefit this brew, but it's a decent brew nonetheless. Not something I would drink on a regular basis. I had a Czechvar prior to this beer and I preferred the Czechvar over this one."
"D: Average drinkability, one would be plenty at a time."
"It definitely deserves a little more respect than some of the reviews I see posted here."
"This beer offers a noticeable improvement compared to Sapporo Premium Beer. Its all- malt goodness and no- frills approach make it a good beer for everyday consumption."
"D-Can't get over the metal-mouth sensation. It takes me back to my junior-high years in braces, and I don't miss those days. I'm glad I don't drop $5 for these when I eat out Asian food."
"Beer. Nothing more nor less. Did pour with a big foamy frothy head and a bit of lace. Golden amber color. Nose was beery. Oddly mouthfilling but still watery. Hops are there but there's a play between the bitterness and neutral sweetness. Beer burps. Serviceable. Almost a session beer if you don't want anything too bold. Got this one at the big local supermarket."
"It poured with two fingers of rocky, bone-white head that slowly fell away into a light foamy coating on top of the beer. The color was a spectacular golden yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. I could almost read things on the other side of the room! The nose was both sweetish and metallic at the same time. Mouthfeel was on the thin side with a mild sweetness on the tongue. The finish was really metallic, however, and lingered well after the swallow. Oof. It came in a big 22-ounce can, so the price was not something to quibble about, but there are much better (and equally inexpensive) examples of the style available. Give one a try, but for me, it was a once-and-done experience."
"What can I say, I was curious to try it b/c of the can... Light golden clear pour with a decent head. Smell was surprisingly skunky, lager malt/yeast smell, and watery with a good amount of metal aroma and flavor. Just watery, boring, and not particularly good at all overall. Kind of a watery golden/blonde ale flavor about it..."
"Drinkablity: I liked the all-malt character of this brew. One of the best Japanese brews I have had."
"D - This is an easy to drink beer mostly because its like drinking water its not a bad beer though its worth a try at least"
"The flavor opens with crackery, bready pilsner malt. Mild and barely toasted. Soft grassy esters, just a little in there, moving fluidly into a balanced hop finish. Soapy and lightly floral, not terribly pungent but it does the job. Carbonation feels a little blunt, not as crisp as it could be. Medium bodied. The flavor sticks with you for a while, which is nice. Minimalist and clean. Great presentation. Far better than the regular Sapporo. Perfect for my spicy salmon roll."
"Overall: Still not something I would drink every day, but a good summer beer and as an accompaniment to sushi it's ace."
"This one is pretty well-balanced for the style. Some noble hop presence mixes in with the malt. While a bit thin, it does have enough body to it to not be watery and it's not too fizzy. Not a bad EPL at all (and a much better choice than the standard Sapporo, IMO)."
"Drinkability is really where this beer shines. I was expecting something more akin to the adjunct laden ""normal"" Sapporo, that i had to choke down simply to cleanse my mouth of an unintentionally large portion of wasabi, but no... This surprisingly sweet & smooth brew could easily become my ""go to"" beer when i'm in the mood for something cool and refreshing without alot of pretentions and such. Well done."
"D- If I could give this beer extra credit, it would be for drinkability, this is clean and refreshing with a nice full, simple malt flavor, I would place this at the top of my session beer list and think this is a great choice for a summer beach beer (especially in the can), I will definitely pick this up again when I want a night of quantity without skimping too much on quality (PS- Drink Responsibly!)"
"It's much more interesting and flavorful than the standard Sapporo, and well worth the increased cost."
"Pours a golden straw color with a steady head and blotchy lacing. Smells clean, crackery, and a touch of cooked vegetable. A good bit of spicy hop is there too. Has good flavors of pale malt and honey. There's a touch of apple fruitiness. Finishes rather dry and biter with a spicy hop flavor (saaz?). Mouthfeel is a little fulsome and has delicate carbonation. Impressive."
"Overall a nice beer. A great beer for a plate of steamers. A very decent beer to keep on hand. If you want nice flavor in a light style beer, this is a nice selection."
"Overall all it's good not great and I'd prefer an Elephant if i'm in the mood for a malt explosion."
"Not bad stuff, one of the more drinkable beers in the EPL category."
"Canada- no doubt by Sapporo's new aquisition, Sleeman."
"A hard pour gets a nice 1 1/2 head that quick disapates into light lacing. It is a bright golden color, very crisp looking. Nice, soft aroma of grains. Taste is very crisp. For sure starts with the malt and barley but finishes with a little hop bite. Very drinkable, average lager."
"Sapporo Reserve pours a deep gold body beneath a full head of creamy bright white froth that holds well and leaves some nice lace behind. The aroma is exceptionally fresh and clean with welcome waft of hops that expresses flowers and trees after the rain. The body is medium, and it's delicately crisp across the palate with a fine, median carbonation. The flavor delivers a clean, softly grainy maltiness and some spicy, herbal, and floral hops that linger into the dry finish. It's much more interesting and flavorful than the standard Sapporo, and well worth the increased cost."
"650 ml can, poured into a half-liter bottle. The small mouth and shape of the top of the can force a somewhat vigorous pour, resulting in a colossal 2 inch head of foam. Good head retention and nice lacing. The beer itself is brilliant gold and crystal clear. Nose is better than I remember it, with (rather light) soft floral hops and a clean graininess. The modest bitterness works well against the slightly sweet grain (it also is quite well attenuated). Hop flavor is only slight but noticibly noble-hops. The finish is clean and dry. Body seems a tad watery."
"Cool can, but the beer I can't recommend. Generic malty alcohol flavor just doesn't appeal to me (but granted, this is better than some)."
"Overall: Medium bodied, plenty going on for the style, but not too busy. Very well balanced. Could get more out of this but won't try, just going to enjoy it for what it is."
"The taste really surprised me on this one: subtle hoppy notes with a strong malty barley flavor balanced slightly by fruity grape and organic grain notes. Mouthfeel was well carbonated as the appearance led on, and finished smooth and crisp. Overall, it was definately drinkable, went well with the fish and wasabi on my sushi. Prolly not great as a standalone beer, though, but worth your while with a meal."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, very clean beer. The mouthfeel was a little watery, a pleasant malt sweetness, European hops don't linger."
"Poured into a glass, it's a lighter golden colored beer with a lovely display of carbonation, and has a good crown (head) to boot. There's a scent of DMS mixed with a trace of hop flavor. The taste is stronger and for the most part, better than that of it's European brewed counterparts. Nice and hoppy with a light sweetness, with a grainy finish make up the flavor profile in this beer. I thought maybe it was a bit undercarbonated, but otherwise, it's a pleasing beer that matched fine with teriyaki chicken and shrimp tempura."
"I had this from a pint bottle I picked up at a Japanese grocery store in Fort Lee. It poured an extremely brilliantly clear golden liquor. I was very impressed by how bright it was. Very little in terms of aroma. Poured a decent frothy 1 finger head that dissipated very quickly. The taste of the beer was very smooth and very drinkable. You can taste the malt in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was very watery with lower than average carbonation."
"Cannot really see the beer since the vessel is opaque. Comes in a brown bottle. I doubt it looks lihe anything other than a clear golden lager. Foamy white head recedes quickly. But trust me, this lager tastes great from these ceramic cups...I need to find them somewhere for home use. Aroma is malty, fresh, clean...as is taste, super-refreshing, mild, crisp, balanced bitter and malt, very dry. The perfect foil for grilled chicken parts. Ultra-drinkable in this context."
"Drinkability: It's better than most pale Euro macros, but plenty of better options."
"D: Not bad...hard to find anything outstanding nor any glaring weaknesses. Simply a refreshing lager. Serve alone or better with food (it's good with sushi)..."
"Sapporo is a very drinkable beer, a nice change from typical american lagers, or foreign ones for that matter. I was expecting a little better but still good enough. The can is pretty cool though."
"Mouthfeel is metallic, honey sweet, and mildly bitter. This is medium bodied and crisp."
"Notes: I'd have to go through my reviews but there aren't too many good Euro Pale's. This, sadly, is one of the better ones at that. Sapporo surprised me with this offering and shows like most breweries they are capable of making a decent product."
"The thing that caught me off guard with Sapporo is the can. Extremely well designed with reinforcements, and it looks cool too! Props to them on that! Anyways, the beer pours a bright yellow with little to no head. In fact, it leaves a ring in about a minute time. But the beer doesn't look American lagery crap looking. No smell to speak of really, which is good. Means it shouldn't be offensive at all. Tastewise, this beer is all malt, and I like that. Malt, malt, and malt. Kind of reminds you of sea salt and malt vinegar chips. Slight hints of corn in the taste, but I don't mind, its a very different corn taste than something from BMC, probably because the malt is so overpowering. Pretty damn bitter too! The mouthfeel is a bit heavy for a lager, so it puts it above the curve. The drinkability is average, but was totally expecting a Budweiser taste because of the rice used, but this thing is like a super concentrated version of a Bud. A very good lager if youre looking for something different! Finishes dry, too bad its brewed in Canada, doesn't really give you the authenticity."
"Defintely one of the best macros I have had. Good lager, and at a fair price. Go ahead and give this one a try."
"Like drinking water, only tastier, would be a good beer to take camping or to the beach during the hot Summer months. Give it a try and see for yourself...cheers."
"It became very apparent that I had not poured a beer from a can in a while as the substantial head grew to twice the size of the actual liquid in my pint glass. It settles down soon enough and I saw and smelled yet another seemingly meaningless lager in front of me. Not especially thirst-quenching, but not offensive either. I'm sure you can get all the details from the many other reviews, so I'll say this: I wouldn't turn one down for free, but would honestly prefer a Mich Jr. straight from the bottle on a hot summer day."
"Again, to me, this is very similar in taste and aromas to Miller Genuine Draft which is one of the best of the Americans I've had."
"Overall: Pretty good stuff, I think it's worth a shot if you like pilsners."
"Can served at Genjis in Midland, MI. Pours golden amber with a medium creamy off-white head with pretty good lacing. Aroma of corn and malt. Body is typical for a ""premium"" lager, not too light but not rich either. Unassertive malt and hops flavors dont really register, but at the same time it is flavorful enough to not be bland. The finish is mildly hoppy. Drinkable, especially with spicy Japanese food but I wouldnt bother with this otherwise."
"Overall, i remember liking this more. i suspect this might be an old can, but its not bad. i prefer this over the sapporo draft, but it's not one i would get often. cool can though."
"Pours out to a deep golden color with a short lived white foam head. Some lace. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of light citrus and hops, different for the style. A touch of mild malt lingers in the wings. Taste is fair; grain, malt, light hops, corn husk, and a touch of sour wheat. Not bad, but not exactly wonderful. Mouthfeel was slightly thick, with a little bit of sour-vinegar character. Average drinkability. I'd have another, if it were offered. Is this really what they drink in Japan?"
"Large 650 ml can. Sapporo Reserve has a golden brown color with a long lasting head. Malty aroma with a little bit of a wheat smell. The flavor is mainly grain. The flavor of alcohol is noticable too. Not too sweet, thankfully. Very little off-flavor. Some herbal hop flavors come in at the finish, and the high carbonation makes the finish seem slightly spicy. Drinkability is good. Nothing special, but this beer is a simple, tasty, and inoffensive lager."
"I think I've had two other Sapporo offerings prior to this one and I don't remember being too impressed. Maybe it's a case of low expectations being easily exceeded, but that doesn't change the fact that Reserve is good beer. If you're in the market for a JPL (Japanese pale lager), start here."
"In the end, a decent drinkable beer. Pretty mellow and easy drinking, simple in its profile, but sometimes that a good thing."
"This has abit more pleasant taste than most Euro lagers that I've had. It doesn't have that skunky smell/taste to it, with the super malty body and stink hop finish. It didn't really have any huge tastes that stood out from the rest of the beer, which made it pretty balanced, but also bland. On the other hand, it was drinkable and didn't leave a nasty aftertaste. I think this would be a good session beer."
"Drinkability - a tasty import, nothing special, but tasty."
"This doesn't quite do it for me but isn't horrible, just boring."
"Opinion: Well...I can say that if you lined up all of the commercialized light Lagers, that this would be one of the first ones that I would pick up. It isn't my favorite beer, but it isn't the worst of the heap either. I wouldn't seek this one out, but if it turns out that this is the best the bar I am at has, I would drink this over water. I can't say the same for Miller."
"I prefer sapporo original to this anyday. Rice in beer is not always a bad thing."
"The nice thing about this beer is the fancy can. Unlike regular Sapporo this can has nice barley designs on both sides of the can. very attractive. This beer is far more enjoyable straight from the can - if you must drink one at all."
"I shouldn't have worried, this is a nice beer. It is all malt so there is absolutely no hop profile. I have to remember to rate by style!!! Good carbonation. Very clean, easy to drink. Great to chase down some spicy sushi after a long day. Good beer."
"Reviewed 03/31/04 and taken from notes. Color is straw but pours with a haze. Head is full bright white and carries a nice lace. Nose shows hints of grass and slight malt. Flavor is chemical like, something definately wrong with this sample. Body is very dry and reminds one of medicine. Finish in omne word is nasty, not good."
"Cool can, though..."
"D- No major flaws with this beer its just not very exciting. The light hops and light malt are well balanced and compliment each other. It would be nice to drink with a meal that is very light, like sushi or tempura. However any dish that has any spice will overpower this beer in one bite."
"Sinkability  I enjoyed their Japanese Rice Lager that they do, but this was just all wrong."
"The taste is likewise a tad sweet, and the malt's there, but it's quickly bowled over by a hefty metallic aftertaste that's not altogether pleasent. Even so, this beer's quite a bit more tasty than the overall blandness of the normal Sapporo. I'll declare this my current favorite Japanese beer."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It was much better than I expected. I will order this the next time I have sushi."
"Drinkability- Not bad. I have no idea why I am having these on a below 50 degree day, but, it's still pretty damn quenching."
"A pretty good beer. I love the can here, too. Unfortunately, that metallic taste brings my opinion of it down a bit, but it's not bad."
"Light to medium bodied, boring and not very drinkable."
"Orangey yellow. Very little head. Really weird smell, very difficult to identify. Some pumpkin, some bread, some apricot perhaps. Strange. I'm deciding on pumpkin for the smell. Smooth mouthfeel, very inoffensive, no bite like lagers often give. Metallic taste if anything. Very little flavor. I am struggling to find a taste and can't find one. Very boring and inoffensive. Finish is slightly more ""there", kind of skunky."
"Better than average lager. Definitely better than their original draft beer."
"Sampled this out of a huge, sturdy 22 Oz. can. Appearance is a medium golden with an above average head. Aroma is mildly sweet, but on the weaker side of beer smells. Reserve's aroma and appearance left me expecting a much more mundane beer than this turned out to be. Taste is pleasently sweet, malts instantly remind me of some malty sweet German brews. Caramel is dominant flavor here. The overall taste is well-rounded and off-taste free. Drinkability is very good; if this is malt liquor, like the can says it is, then it has to be the best malt liquor I've ever sampled."
"Drinkability: will not purchase again...ever"
"An above average ""lawn mower"" beer."
"This is surprisingly a decent beer. A medium bodied pale lager with bright yellow color and medium white head. It has a rich, malty taste with no obvious adjuncty off flavors. Smooth mouthfeel with tight carbonation. Easy to drink and would go well with food. Also has comes in a very nice looking can that I might keep for decoration. Not an outstanding beer but very respectable for the style."
"Pours to a permanent white head and a bit of lace. Golden color. Aroma is of sweet grainy malt with balance of noble hops. Flavor suggests traditional pilsner brewing with malty sweetness and balancing hop bitterness. Finishes pleasantly grainy and bittersweet. No parching dryness. A respectable brew."
"Very drinkable. Very Japanese, take simple ingredients and make something more from them."
"Sapporo Reserve: from the typical (kinda) cool pilsner style 22 oz can. The can has three stalks of barley on it. Pours significantly colored golden yellow. Explosive head, even when lightly poured, although it dissipates quickly, and leaves very light Belgian lacing on the side of the mug. A blast of skunked hops and adjuncts assaults the nose when first poured, but it settles down considerably when its resting in the glass. Initial tastes were not pleasant, but as it warms up, and settles, very sweet malts start assert themselves. A mild adjunct flavor also seems to dissipate as well, and the flavor literally warms up, leaving some biscuit flavors, and a hint of jam. What hops it has are employed to clean up the aftertaste, leaving a clean, mild malt taste. Cripes, I want to not like this beer, but it is surprising flavorful, light bodied and easy to drink. Worth a try."
"The Quintessential lager gold color on the pour, planetary sized head, could be because I dropped the can twice, head is bright white, frothy in texture with the lace a thin white curtain to seal off the glass. Archetypal lager clean and crisp malt laden nose, sweet malt start, top is light in feel. Finish is crisply acidic and the hops apropos to the style, an average beer at best."
"Not a bad beer, but defintely nothing special either. Given the choice of this or an American macro lager, I would jump all over this."
"Light amber color,small quick disappearing head, very light slightly fruity aroma. Slight sweet sour malt tastewith a little bit of a carmel aftertaste. Didn't seem that complex, no real bitter aftertaste. I would definitely prefer this to an American malt liquor."
"Light gold color, large head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A lighter bodied lager style beer. Nice mild hops. Milder malts with some sweetness. Good balance. Nice full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Smooth taste. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Just a little bit more drinkable than the Sapporo Original Draft. The can for this one is even a little bit cooler. Once again, what little flavor is here just isn't that great."
"BA might add 'Indestructible Can' to serving type. Pours a very clear and shiny gold. A foamy head of varying bubble sizes is fairly sturdy and traces of patchy lace remain throughout. The aroma is of grainy malt and mild metallic hops. There's more body than one typically associates with Japanese macro beer (it's a good thing). Fairly sweet and edged with some metallic and mildly spicy bitterness. Certainly not a great beer, but definitely not a bad beer."
"This beer pours a plain yellow color with a small white head that quickly disappears and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little malty, a little wheaty, but very plain in actuality. The flavor is very plain and uninteresting. Obviously a mass-produced beer, but for some reason, the Reserve is not as tasty as the regular Sapporo. Who knows."
"Actually quite a drinkable beer..not bad at all..500% better than the Draft..but not worth the premium price."
"Drinkability: superior to standard Sapporo to be sure; I always choose this at a Japanese restaurant if it's on the menu (not always easy to find)"
"Helluva can, too. A few of these and some hose clamps and you'll never have to visit Midas for a tailpipe."
"Not bad, but not good either."
"Presenration: Packaged in a custom tall brown glass sixteen ounce bottle with a pop-off crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours with a fluffy white head over brilliant gold/straw colored liquid. Nose is grassy and sweet smelling, quite effervescent too. Taste is sweet and slightly bready, with adequate bitterness showing up late in the swallow. Finishes malty with hoppy dryness taking things to the end. Well made."
"Hazy orange/gold color. Aromas of sweet, sprouting grain. A little nuttiness from a bitter hop infusion appears on the outside. Big, creamy and very dry with driving, fine bubbles. Alcohol sweetness is at the center of a complex of toasted nut, dried apple and dried apricot flavors. This beer seems to be a little top heavy, big, broad alcohol-driven size and weight without much flavor detail to complement it. Extremely drinkable though for such a heady brew."
"Bright golden beer, white head. Smells quite floral and citrusy. Impressively smooth brew, tastes very fruit, like melon or pineapple candy, but not too sweet. Bitter finish and a little bit of a grain aftertaste. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this one."
"Great beer. Beautiful golden color. This goes very well with spicy food. It does have a bit of the can taste in it, but oddly enough, it compliments it. Very refreshing. The best of the Sapporo beers."
"Notes: This is Sapporo's special beer, a Malt Liquor, brewed twice as long as the other variations of Sapporo. I like this brew. A great complement to sushi, and an excellent alternative to many of the American styles of the same."
