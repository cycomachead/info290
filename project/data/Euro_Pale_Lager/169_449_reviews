review_text
"Stella is a great beer to start off with in life. It's light, approachable, you can drink a handful of them. I love Stella because it's great with everything and it's hard for people not to like. If you're looking for a mind-blowing beer, don't buy Stella. But I like it!"
"Served in a Pilsner glass"
"Tastes big brand. Sure have this if you want bland but cheap."
""
"Fucking tasty beer. I enjoyed it."
""
"One of my favorite beers. A standard everywhere. The smell is alright but I can see some not enjoying the skunkiness. Still a classic though."
"rated from previous tasting notes"
"I would say that Stella and Heineken are both very good entry level beers for people who think they don't like beer.  I started with those two just a year or so ago and now I'm learning to appreciate the Gulden Draaks, the Pauwel Kwaks, the EKU 28s, and the Samichlaus type beers.  This is why I still like it a lot and it's my go to because most places aren't going to have the previously mentioned beers."

""
"Good Belgian beer.  Very light, subtle aromas.  Smooth and refreshing taste."
""
"Very light in appearance as well as taste. Nothing stood out in terms of taste."
""
""
"Smooth delicious summer beer. Honestly it's the best for summer BBQs"
""
""
"Great belgian but I never noticed before this app that there is no smell. Only bad feature."
"Very good beer with great taste smooth finish and best when on draft"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff isn't bad, but it is not nearly as good as it needs to be to justify its high price. I'd honestly rather drink Pabst than this, and it'd cost me much less. Overall, it's ok but WAY overpriced."
"Light bodied, light carbonation."
"Better than I expected. Not something I will actively seek out but will drink this in absence of more desirable beers."
"Delicious. Straight up delicious. Only bad part is price. But it is one of the best beers ever. Great with pizza"
""
""
"Like a Rolling Rock if a Rolling Rock was any good. But still… basically that. Very pale. Very clear. Flavor is… plain lager."
"O - This is a beer that would go well with anything and nothing at all.  If not pairing with anything, then it becomes more of a summer beer in my opinion.  Very light and will not fill you up.  3.25/5"
"Decent lager, nothing special. Lots of bubbles"
"Easy to find lager.  It's a clear golden color, and has a slight skunk smell.  It's a crisp light beer with a good hoppy taste upfront.  There is a clean finish at the end.  It's a solid beer in the style that I like."
""
"Love the taste and look of it"
""
"This is the go to light pale euro lager, although I will only purchase it on sale, a little too pricey if not on sale. Look is pale amber with a white head and a little lacing. Smell is a pleasant hopped aroma. Taste is similar, very light. Good mouthfeel, not heavy at all. A good dinner beer, goes with most everything, without the aftertaste you get with some American pilsners. Not the best, but when your unsure of which euro light lager to pick up, you can't go wrong with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like the packaging but a very underwhelming beer.  Tastes like something from a college keg'r.  Overpriced."
""
""

""
""
"When Marlon Brando famously exclaimed ""Stellaaaaaa!!!!!"" In the classic film On The Waterfront, he was almost certainly NOT talking about this beer. Stella the woman is classy, sexy, playful, firm. Stella the beer is...not. She's gassy, she's tasteless, she's haughty for her age and level of sophistication. I get it - she's foreign, but if she's bad in the (hop) sack I don't see the point of coming back for seconds. At the end of the day, Stella is eminently forgettable and doesn't hold a candle to a nice American girl of a similar price."
"Great,  smooth,  good after taste"
""
""
"Good beer. Little pricey for what you're getting. Some domestics are quite better and cheaper."
"Excellent smooth beer. One if my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a truly awful beer. Super skunky."
"Bottle of stella artois drank."
"A very light beer with not much flavor."
""
""
"Ok beer not great but good"
"Perhaps not worth the elevated price, but a satisfying European pale lager with a pleasant finish and aftertaste."
""
"Its a decent lager in the style of what you would expect but its just boring unless with certain food pairings. I like it with fish..."
""
""
"Frothy head, medium body and a pleasant but mild noble hop aroma. It's a sessionable beer and one that has a hint of sweetness towards the end. If you're a fan of lagers this should be a beer that should be on your tasted list."
"One of the great European beers!"
"always a decent dinner beer"
""
""
""
"It's light and crisp. Very drinkable"
""
"Light tasting, crisp, refreshing. All n all decent beer."
""
""
""
"The perfect hoppy lager beer."
"It's basically a tastier version of Heineken. And you don't need much to be tastier than a Heineken."
"A little better than a heineken, but not a good beer imo."
"Smooth, crisp beer to enjoy on a warm day. I've tasted better that's for sure, but totally worth trying."
"Smooth classic beer.  Can't get enough."
""
"Stella, classic dessert. Cool, crisp, light lager!"
"Esta cerveza  es un Elixir  para Dioses"
""
"Crisp and clean when enjoyed in the correct chalice."
"Overall : Too delicate, missing some freshness and lots of flavors, I find this beer a little off. In comparison, the Heineken is better in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Not bad, smooth with just a light kick. Needs salt"
""
"Feel: Very smooth and refreshing. Light-bodied, great for a meal or following a porter/stout."
"Love it! Best green label ever"
""
""
""
""
"Not too much going on"
""
""
""
""
"This beer simply has nothing to offer except, I suppose, a means of consuming alcohol. The lack of aroma followed by the absence of flavor makes this the beer equivalent of eating cardboard. I give it a 2 overall because it isn't bad per se, it just isn't good. One could drink this without any real complaint but I don't know why when there are so many other, better options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favs.  Nice light taste, easy drinking.  Tastes like an American Lager, but there seems to be more body to it.  As long as the price stays low, I will continue to buy this nice beer."
"One of my favorites and very different depending on whether you're drinking the bottled version or the canned.  The canned seems creamier & blander."
""
"Why the 11oz bottle and not the 12oz?  It's almost as if I'm getting robbed out of a beer when I get the 12 pack."
""
"Don't get it. Tastes like re bottled MGD. no flavor and watery. If i had to blind taste it I'd be sure i was drinking a mainstream American lager"
"A classic! Whenever I am looking to switch it up, I reach for a Stella!"
"I've never been a huge fan of this stuff.  It's a little insipid.  If this wasn't part of a variety pack, I would have never bought it."
""
"Best beer in the game"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mediocre at best. This was a light beer with no real body, leaving nothing to be remembered."
"Well this was ok. Reminds me of a skunked beer but with some for flavor of hops that not common. So honestly it's get what you pay for and I respect that. Just try it and judge it yourself."
"I don't get the attraction."
"Pours a straw-yellow in color with about a good 1-finger foamy white head that settles down to around 2mm after a while with some sticky lacing seen after each sip. Lots of tiny streaming bubbles rising the whole time until the end. The aroma has that typical 'skunk' aroma that is so common in green bottles for some reason and also just grains. The taste is pretty much just of grains and sweet grass with a hint of corn. Slight dry finish but it is drinkable. Lighter to medium-bodied with lots of carbonation. Nothing really special and is just OK."
""
""
""
"I love this beer. It's been my favorite since I started drinking and just feels better than anything else."
"Do Belgians really drink this stuff?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"V - Not good. Let the champagne style wrapping on the bottle be a sign, this is considered one of the ""classiest"" beers of the domestics, it isn't cheap, and until you're actually craving one, it's seldom worth the price."
""
"Interesting change of pace from an American lager, but I'd rather have a Heineken."
""
""
"Great taste, body. Excellente beer with great favor. Perfect after taste."
""
""
""
""
"It's not as good as Stella Ortiz."
"Seems almost like a non-alcoholic beer. Like water was run over an open beer can and captured in a bottle."
"After I quit smoking I lost my taste for corona (my old safety beer). This is my new choice which most would agree it's better than the old."
""
"Solid ""session lager", but nothing more than that. Smooth & drinkable.  Some green bottle skunkyness but not a deal breaker."
""
""
""
""
"This beer smell And tastes like a skunk"
""
""
""
"Bad smell and taste like what stinky feet smell"
""
"skunky taste just not very good flavor"
"It tastes like skunked beer."
"Skunked holiday gift set from santa"
"Good smooth beer with good taste"
""
""
"Overall, this beer wouldn’t be terrible to drink at a hockey game. There is much more hype about this beer than there should be. The glassware however is pretty cool! I would pair this beer with something salty – typical pub fare anything from mixed nuts to wings to popcorn. I give it a 68/100."
""
""
""
""
"O) Still a much better beer than the other standard UK lagers (Carling, Fosters) etc."
"Not bad beer better then Bud by a long shot."
"This is my wife's favorite beer, so we almost always have it in the house.  It's very drinkable and significantly more enjoyable than most lagers out there.  Recently we have been enjoying the 14.9oz cans poured into Stella chalices.  The combination of the can and the chalice provides a nice lasting frothy head; nose is slightly sweet with a slight but not unpleasant “skunk” smell; mild hop flavor with some grain, generally very enjoyable.  Drinks like a light beer, but tastes and has the ABV of a “real” beer."
""
""
""
"Good beer among the style."
""
""
""
"Good smooth taste, with a little dryness to it. A great balanced beer, and not very acidic because it is brewed with Saaz hops. One of my favorite hops out there."
""
"It has a smooth taste and a hopy after taste."
"This is an enjoyable lagar and my go-to beer when on the road."
"Light bodied with medium carbonation. Slightly dry. Little thin on the flavor"
"Little thin on the flavor but better than I thought."
"not a bad wee beer at all"

"Before I got into craft beer, I used to drink this one frequently. In fact, it was at one point arguably my favorite. I had heard of the reputation Belgian beers had and I this thought I was being sophisticated. Since then, I have discovered the Belgian style dubbels, trippels, quadruplels, strong ales etc that are truly at another level. Knowing this, I went back to give Stella a try for old times sake, knowing full well that it doesn't hold a candle to Duvel, Chimay, St. Bernadus etc. Nevertheless, I was expecting a pleasant crisp and refreshing change of pace as I used to remember it. I was sorely disappointed. This Stella thatbI tried had a grainy and skunky aroma that truly bothered me. The carbonation was low and the taste was watery and lacking flavor. I couldn't finish it. Have my taste buds grown so sophisticated that I've become a beer snob? Or has the manufacturing of this product changed for the worst. Either way, I did not enjoy it at all."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 1C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 52 02:32. AROMA: low grainy aroma with a kind of sulphury background mixed with DMS. no hop aroma. APPEARANCE: very pale straw color and translucent. average white head with average retention. TASTE: mild grainy sweet flavour with low bitterness. finishes somewhat dry. PALATE: thin body with low carbonation. OVERALL: another bulk pale lager with some odd aromas."
"A great session beer with your mates, light and very drinkable, an absolutely beautiful Belgian lager beer."

"500 ml can. Pours clear straw colour. White fluffy head. Very carbonated. Skunky nose. Skunky taste. Light and refreshing but not much going on. Meh."
"This does not blow me away in any sense - very much reminds me of overpriced Heineken. It is smooth, has a great head & carbonation, but overall is just ok."

"Okay, a couple months before I joined BA, I was visiting a friend down in Norfolk, VA, and he offered me a Stella from his fridge.  Now, I am only a burgeoning beer advocate, and I actually credit this beer with getting me started.  I liked it on first contact.  It's a decent Euro Pale Lager.  The color and head drew me in, and hey, I hadn't been into the craft beers yet, so this to me was something different.  Now I know better, of course, but I would still get this if I saw it, and I would NEVER turn one down.  The taste is a little carbonated, true, but it's smooth.  I rate it up there with Peroni, which also has a tendency to get a ribbing here.  Still, this is a solid beer.  Don't dismiss it."

"Not totally sure why you'd try this in the realm of all the fantastic Belgian beers out there, but I guess it's a gateway beer until you get serious.  Fine for what it is, but there's so much more interesting stuff out there."

"A crisp, average lager. foamy white head settle fast. Feels lite and bubbly. Maybe a tad bit more dry than the average American adjunct, which some may prefer. Out of a bottle the skunk smell was overpowering and the subdued skunk in the taste ruins what would otherwise be a very drinkable lager. Would try again out of a can, steer clear from the bottle."

"So overall would I recommend it ? Its a small yes. If you are at the bar and the price is the same as a Budweiser or Coors Light or bud light.. take the Stella Artois. But here in Quebec Canada the price for a 24 packs when its on special is 29,99 $ you can still go for it but if it isn t on special the price is around 34,99$ and for that price you can go for a 24 pack of Budweiser. So for me it's a small recommendation. But if you are in Europe go for it."

""
"Overall: Ridiculously overpriced. I bought one bottle to review. This beer is a skunk bomb."
""
""
""
"O- Reason for my re-review? Whether my palate has developed (likely) or this is a bad batch (unlikely), Stella Artois is not as good as I remember it being. Its a bland, extremely simple Adjunct Lager that I would parallel to Budweiser (yeah I know). If you find some for a great price, It's definitely worth a try but it isn't worth much more than that."

"That aside, this beer smells fantastic, such a surprised. The taste is at first a reflection of the smell then immediately dies down to something far less impressionable. Undoubtedly does that kill a point or so in the taste score. With a beer of this piss yellow hue of course it will be a tad watery. And so the mouthfeel lost a point or so. Overall since this beer has some perks, I say give it three stars. Try it at least once. Its okay."

"This is a great brew, and ever since that day at the beach it has been my choice of beer for bringing to anyone's house for an occasion. I have found that at every event I bring these to, everyone loves them, even the people that don't really enjoy beer. It's a great beer to bring to any occasion because everyone can drink on it. Instead of bringing your favorite selection of craft beers that everyone else thinks taste like garbage, try bringing some Stellas. You will be the man/woman at the party."
""
""
"When you go into a real dive, this is what a lot of people there consider their ""good beer."" It's not too complex or rare but it does have some good qualities. The appearance is a nice yellow with a white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is rice, a little bit of citrus, and then a bit of malt. The flavor was a little skunky but had a clean finish and I found it to be pretty refreshing. It gets a bit of a bad rap, but if you're buying beer for a large party, this is one of the beers I would definitely point towards."
"It's one of those beers that's seriously just... A-OK. Nothing wrong with it, nothing bad about it. It's not worth raving about (I don't understand its popularity), but it's certainly at least better than Budweiser or even Heineken. Drinking this beer really does make me feel like a total tool, or a faux hipster."

"Poured into an English pint glass. Minimal head which dissipates rather quickly, nice bright clear yellow appearance. Plenty of carbonation. I can't notice much else in smell or taste other than corn. Good price at 2.99 a pint at the local 7/11. Great session beer on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stella is fine. It's light, crisp, and sweet-ish. Refreshing on a hot day. A little bready/yeasty. High carbonation, very slightly dry finish. It's better than other lagers, but it's still a macro lager. Sometimes it's the best you can do, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Stella is a fine everyday beer, when not treating myself to a Czech Pilsner or German brew.It has a subtle aroma, yet smooth and flavorful, with a nice color. Very drinkable. It's a typical Belgian Lager style. It's the one i usually go for when i'm grabbing a quick six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would like it a lot more without the skunkiness (which I know is on purpose).  Its still a good option for non-craft drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This my regular, go to beer when I cant get my hands on my rare Japanese beers. It has great taste, no smell really. I wish it could be more dry but it is fine the way it is. I would recommend it. The white packaging on the box as well as the bottles are neat. The box does have perforated lines for easy access in the refrigerator"

""
""
""
"Overall: definitely a little pricey, but I guess that can be expected from imported beer. Awesome pale lager that would be great on a hot summer day!"
""
"Though this is often marketed as a premium lager, I wouldn't rank it in my top 5."
""

"Flavor: combination of biscuit, grassiness, and some hops in the finish."
"I must say I do enjoy this beer much more out of the bottle then on-tap. Not sure if it had anything to do with the restaurants dispensing system or the beer itself, but of out the bottle seems much more smooth and light. I enjoy light beer and this one is typically very refreshing as well."

"This is what a premium lager should be like."

"Overall: It's an unremarkable pale lager that costs a little more than it should. There are some widely circulated beers out there that have a huge appeal that I understand. PBR: it's cheap and tastes like what more expensive bad beers should taste like but don't. Guinness: it's a classic stout that makes people feel Irish for some reason. Sam Adams: it says, ""I know something about beer, maybe."" I honestly can't pin down the market for Stella. People who like to pay more for forgettable beer?"

"good light beer color, not very high carbonation, head disappears quickly, overall an enjoyable and crisp beer, definetly a sweeter beer with a presence of mild clean fruittiness and minimal malts, a very mild lager. I would reccomend this beer because of its light flavor."

"This massed produced Belgium beer, does not live up to the other beers of Belgium, it is only well known becuase of mass marketing in the United States and hipsters. It is marginally better than massed produced pale lagers in the United States. It pours golden clear, with little lacing, and a medium sized head that dissapears pretty fast after arriving. It has a hoppy, stale, and skunky taste, with twinges of rice and wheat, and the it has the aroma of malt and hops. Goes down easy, low alcohol content, and less filling makes it good for barabacueing and partying, not much else. Nothing to get excited about, not the best, not the worst."

" I got this as a birthday gift, not something I sought out. It is a big seller in downtown Madison bars. Not bad, but I dont understand the huge following. The different taste stands out, the dryness, maybe thats what the people like. The lace on the glass looks like its from a stronger beer. I like how it holds. No regrets in trying."

"Nice light golden color. Always wanted to try this and the host at a Christmas party insisted I give one a try. Tastes like a regular beer to me. Nice and light with a fair amount of carbonation. Nothing too distinct or flavorful. A bit plain. Easy to drink."
""
""
"O: I really like Stella for sittin' around & having a few beers. It's interesting enough to keep it good, but not so strong in ABV nor flavor to overwhelm your palate. It's the European pale lager favorite for me."
""
""
"Poured a clear yellow with lively carbonation bubbles going up the glass and a half-finger white head that receded to a thin ring of white lace very quickly. Standard for a pale lager, nothing special. Scents of lager yeast, maize, some bready malt and faint grassiness. Typical adjunct lager aromas. Nothing special. Flavor begins sweet, with strong flavors of maize, moving into some bready malt and grainy flavors and some dank herbal hops, finish is grainy with a decent level of earthy hop bitterness. Its a fairly typical adjunct lager flavor, made a bit better by the higher level of hop flavor than usual in American lagers. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a semi-drying mouthfeel. Fairly standard for the style. Overall this is a standard pale lager. Its nothing special, but its better than most American lagers and Heineken by a large margin."
""
"Nice half inch head of pure white foam. Good show of carbonation bubbles. Pale straw yellow hued. Brilliant clarity. Faint pale malt aroma. Definitely get the well water lager flavor. Think light club cracker with the pale malt flavor. Very light in body. Great beer for hot summer weather."

"I haven't had a Stella since ""discovering"" craft beer a few years back and tried one on tap at a place where there were few better options. This was a staple in grad school and after having tried so many wonderful Belgian brews there was a certain appeal in rediscovering this best seller from the perspective of someone whose palate has (hopefully) evolved since then. In any event, the pint arrived in the classic Stella glass and although a lot of the time I am less concerned about presentation than other factors such as smell and taste, it was nostalgic to see the glass again. Stella is a pale straw hued, bubbly beer with some white lace and a rather sweet malt and yeast aroma. More yeast on the nose than other pale Euro lagers along with some fruity and floral notes. Hints of spice. The taste is similar, with pale malts and some Belgian yeast character that adds hints of banana and bubblegum that are pallid echoes of those found in craft Belgian offerings but nevertheless welcome. There are dry aromatic hay flavors and a rounded corny sweetness. Unfortunately some stale chemical flavors and DMS show up as the beer warms: Keep it cold if possible. Probably less skunky on tap than in the green bottle but I have not tried the latter recently. Better than the similar Heineken (more yeast character) but certainly a close cousin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was decent beer and a good example of the style, it doesn't taste too similar to some of the other Euro Pale Lagers I have tried and I think that's mainly because of the yeast used in this beer, it imparts a unique flavor for the style. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these if I wanted to catch a buzz. I liked how unique this beer was the most. I liked the slight stale malt flavor the least. I would buy this if I wanted to take some beer to party and wasn't in the mood for craft beer and I think I would order this in a bar if there wasn't any better options. I would recommend this to people looking for a somewhat flavorful session ale. All in all this beer turned out to be better then I thought it would, It's not bad at all, I think it's a solid choice when not much is available."

"I really enjoy a nice ice cold Stell Artois especially on a hot day. Its smooth, delicious and I recommend it to others all the time because of the fact that it is a good tasting beer and the Cidre from Stella Artois is just as good.

"Don't plan on trying again. The store i buy from is very good so I don't think this was a bad bottle. It reminds me of the average large scale generic Euro or US beers. I don't understand why any beer is in clear or green bottles. Are those bottles cheaper to make? Considering the price, I'll take a PBR or Miller Lite over this."
""
""
"O-Euro Adjunct Lager? Belgian imposter? It looked good then went downhill - fast."
""
"O-Sure, Stella is the poster child for deceptive ""Belgian"" marketing, but for a pale, macro lager, one could do worse. I was pleasantly surprised by the aroma, which is intense (all things being relative). If you are looking for a brew to throw down on the golf course or while lounging pool-side on a hot summer day, this might be an option."

"Frankly, this beer isn't worth any more than one hundred words."

""
""
"Pours a deep golden color a little like mildly tarnished gold jewelry. There is a pile of thick frothy head on the top and leaves delicate lacing to the glass. Both the head and the lacing is quick to dissipate. There is lots of good light penetration and just the ever-so-slight chill haze to it. This is the best attribute of the beer. The nose, however, is just average. There is sweet corn smell to it, processed white bread smell reminiscent to when I lived next to the Merita bread factory in downtown Birmingham. I'm not sure if they actually use corn adjunts, but I definitely get that whiff. There is the ever so slight smell of a spicy or herbal hop to the beer that comes and goes. The sulfur smell is slightly more prominent than I would like, and borders on skunkiness, but not quite. Just when I think it smells skunky, it goes away. The taste, like the smell, is just average, but the sulfur notes are much less prominent. The white bread dominates with a tight acerbic bite from the carbonation. Hops are very subdued and slightly spicy; I would assume they are of Noble origin. The mouthfeel is crisp, dry, carbonated and rather refreshing overall, like a premium lager should be. Overall, this beer is average. On tap it is a fairly good lager when the options are limited, but it certainly isn't a world-class lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear yellow with a compact, frothy white head. Dusty grain, a little corn, and some grass. Flavors of fairly clean graininess, light sweetness, and mild floral notes. Bland and harmless...no off flavors like many macros. Crisp and well-carbonated. Refreshing, poundable, and instantly forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"another light, crisp refreshing beer. one thing i hate about stella is the 11 oz bottles, so when you buy a case you spend more for the import and are already two beers light. that rant out of the way, stella is smooth with that hint of burnt after flavor that reminds you it's an import. there's a reason why this is one of the most popular beers in the world - good, smooth-drinking flavor."
"I understand why hipsters have adopted PBR as their beer of choice, but why some have moved to Stella is beyond me. Stella's marketing campaigns are corny and their beer is usually a light struck, skunky mess. They are truly the bane of the Belgian beer world."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation, leaves the palate silky and wanting another sip."
""
"Concerns from the onset: pours a thin, light amber. Fizzz. Head disappears faster than a flash of light. Can't smell much. ""Euro Pale lager"" is an apt description. I feel like I should be smoking a long cigarette and wearing a turtle neck. Taste is OK, lightest of barley and some hop bitterness. Feels like Sprite in the mouth. If this is truly ""Belgium's original beer," I'm eternally thankful that Belgium has bettered herself over the last 647 years."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this on tap (pub pint glasses) and bottled (Spiegelau lager and pilsner glasses). It's fine either way. This is often the best lager available on tap for me (locally); not the best BEER, but the best lager. My OA rating is based on that: how good the beer is within its style, or niche."

"O=I decided to try this as a complement to Buffalo Wild Wings' ""Hot"" wings, and it did not pair that well. I am not familiar with the style, so my points are geared more towards traditional lagers...better than average flavor, but not nearly as good as many crafts out there."
""
""
"o - first time i've ever had this beer and as far as pale lagers go this one was good. if the selection at a restaurant is lacking then i'll go to this one from now on."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is my choice in sessioning beer, even if I rarely do anymore. Its very over hyped and really doesn't deserve that pouring ritual they have for it. Not worth the money for most people but my store sells it at the same price as Bud or Coors which is strange. My fridge is usually always stocked with it. It does get skunky , maybe like 2-3 per 24, but nothing like a Heineken or a Corona. Above average but not ""stellar""."
""

"The taste is a bit better with bready pale malts and an almost tart but also dry hopped finale and lingering bitterness. This is not one that I have frequently but drinking it in a can or on tap would be recommended."

""
""
""
""
"I had it Ice cold from the bottle into a pilsner glass. I can smell hops , some malted barley but not that much , but its basically a similar smell to Heineken , you just get that European hoppy skunky smell but nothing off puting. the beer has about 2 inches of foam white head to it , very appealing golden straw colour to the beer with lots of carbonation. the taste is very smooth , it also reminds me of a nice cold heinken but less skunky , the taste is very nice and soft you can feel the carbonation the whole way through from your tounge to your throat , its basically a heineken but with a weaker bitter aftertast compared to the heineken but overall . Its a very nice beer nothing off putting about, the taste is brilliant , very drinkable. this is a perfect example of you get what you pay for in canada its around 25$ a 12 of bottles and compare it to budweiser which is around 20$ a 12. but yeah great beer i would reccomend to anyone that likes heineken and also great for christmas to. Cheers . merry christmas from drunky the clown"

"Would I buy it again? Yes."

"From the tap it poured an eye-appealing golden color, crisp and clear. The head was white, but small, and it had staying power. The lacing was good too, sticking to the glass all the way down. I couldn't really smell anything but the hops - I was hoping for more, but nope, nothing. Mouthfeel was impressive, it wet my tongue without an overly obnoxious carbonation - that much I liked. It's taste wasn't anything better or worse from some other lagers I've had. In fact, I had to convince myself it didn't taste watery to me. (But just to hedge my bets - I kept it's overall rating at an average lager.)"

"O: Like your typical green-bottled beer, it's all about the skunkiness. Maybe it would be better on tap, but from the bottle, all I really get is that skunk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all, it's just an average beer, maybe a little above average, but by a hair at most. I would say it;s worth a try, but everyone's probably had this before so no need to."

"Much better options out there for Euro lagers. One of my least favorite beers ever."
""

"HUGE difference between on-tap and out of the bottle. One of the most drinkable beers ever made. Clear, golden, and very little head. Smooth and crisp taste, with a very pleasant after taste. Perfect beer to drink to quench your thirst on a hot day. Also, pairs well with food like poultry and fish. Enjoy!"

"Lightly sweet grain, slight grassy, very mild hop bitterness towards the finish. Body is light, dry aftertaste, crisp, well carbonated."

"O> It's hard to say anything bad about Stella Artois, however I don't have anything really great to say about it either. To me, Stella is a solid choice for a euro lager. There are better out there but there are also WAY WAY WAY worse lagers. This blows American macros out of the water. What this beer lacks in character it makes up for by being easy to drink and having a pleasant flavor that could be enjoyed and even appreciated by most. This is a beer I won't buy very often, but if it was offered to me at a gathering I'd be very pleased. Infact I'd probably every compliment the host on their excellent choice of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent Euro Lager, but it's not worth a premium price."
""
""
"Interestingly that the first ones that arrived to Brazil tasted better and then went to the common ground. I though that would follow an international standard. I guess Inbev cares mostly on the short term life span of its brands. Hope they keep Laffe, with a good taste for what your buck is worth it."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium golden straw with a decent bubbly white head that slowly dissipates. Smells of pilsner malt a hint of spicy hops and a touch of skunk. The flavor is crisp and clean. Bready sweet pilsner with just enough spicy hop to try to provide some balance. Medium to light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a spicy bubbly mouthfeel. Meh. Serviceable pale lager that was my best choice at dinner, but really nothing special."

"Meh - another run-of-the-mill macro lager. Bland, watery and uninteresting. I guess it would quench your thirst on a hot day, but it serves little other purpose. Give it a miss."
""
""
"O: Not really a good beer, but if you're looking for a Euro Pale Lager I'm not sure that I could point you in a better direction. This beer is definitely best as an accent of a good night not centered around beer."

"Stella: Take a Bud, crank up the malt flavor a bit and there you have a Stella. Stella is a good option if you want a basic no frills beer. Recommended. Good news is that you can find this beer served in many bars and restaurants these days. Not always a guarantee that you will get the proper glass as you would in Belguim, but I have seen a sparlking Stella in the proper chalice in pretty remote digs."
""
""
""
""
"If you're of the MBC crowd I can see why this represents the epitome of Belgian brewing sophistication. Otherwise it's a better than average beer from a worse than average style."

"Final Thoughts: Even though this is a macro-lager, it has a definite edge on it's American counterpart. There is no adjunct taste in this beer. If you're a macro-lager drinker then take that first step and order a Stella Artois. From there, who knows, maybe you'll conquer your fears by ordering some beers with real character. All in all, I wouldn't seek this beer out again, but I can appreciate some of the craftsmanship that goes into it."

""
""
""

""
"o: There isn't a lot going on in this beer but there isn't supposed to be much with this style. It's a decent example and a good thirst quenching beer but it's kind of flat and lifeless. The nose is clean with out any defects but it is so faint while there is a bit more substance to the flavor it's not by much."

"O/D-There are worse things than Stella Artois. One of those 'worst case scenario' beers I will find at a barbecue. Still, it has the potential to 'hit the spot' on some very rare occasions."
"whatever you thing most lagers look taste feel smell and seem like is what this is. reminded me of coors light. nothing but just another lager to me. no flavor no lingering taste of anything. very boring, boring, boring. could have done with out this one. will do with out this one."

"330ml bottle. Lager glass. Pale yellow color, crystal appearance. White in color, close & creamy froth. Slightly sulphur, yeasty & floral aromas. Mildy malty flavor & citric touch. Light body with medium, but lively, carbonation. Smooth bitter finish & aftertaste."
""
""
""
"o - Overall not a very good beer. Not a ton going on, a bit overcarbonated, and a tiny bit skunky in the taste. Would not want to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Draft pint at a ball game. Clear golden yellow with a thin white head with surprisingly decent lacing. Aroma is bread, yeast, biscuit, lemongrass, and some spice, probably coriander. Taste is bready, malty, and Belgian yeast with a spicy lemon twist. Kinda adjunct lagerish but ok."
""
"O: Refreshing and easy to drink but has more of the feeling of BMC than craft beer. Very sessionable as the flavors/aromas are not too intense and the ABV is moderate."
"Overall certainly a drinkable lager. Would rather drink this over the macro lagers of America. For a Euro Pale Lager it accomplishes what it needs to."
"O: Only worth buying over macro American lagers. Seems to have a lot of presentation. It's basically corn flavored water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice Euro-Trash lager :-)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would recommend this over nearly any American lager and most European pilsners, but if you are looking for more flavor, you need look elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So I popped my first bottle, and poured it into a pint glass. The first thing I noticed was man, this smells like a brewery. It brought me back to a Saturday job I had in the old Seattle Malt and Brewing basement. Any beer that smells like a brewery, and not a model airplane glue factory, or the compost bucket, can't be all bad. So on to the taste - it's got a preponderance of bitter malt, but not strong hop flavor. I feared I would be up against another harsh Belgian farmhouse ale type, but this was rather more like putting a suit on the farmhouse ale and bringing it to the big city. Unlike the normal American standard lagers, the taste does not stick around making you wish you had an Altoid, but leaves you with a pleasant gustatory memory. This drinks real nice, and makes you want to knock back another one. It takes lager beer from a duty to a pleasure."
""
"O - I'm not a fan of Euro lagers, but for the style Stella Artois is decent."
""
""
"It is what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: easy beer to drink and like, you can give this o almost anyone and they shouldn't complain. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: True to the style which usually isn't very good. Still drinkable and somewhat refreshing. One of the better members of the genre."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear yellow-gold with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of light grain aromas and some pretty serious skunking up front that dissipates with time. Taste is of grains and some herbal and grassy flavors. There is a mild bitterness with each sip that quickly fades. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average lager all around that's not all that bad once the skunk disappears."
"Overall... just... so... just... bad!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – For the fancy foreign name and the pretentiousness surrounding this brand sometimes, it tastes like any of the pale or adjunct lagers, just a bit better. At least they give out cool glasses. I would actually drink this again. Stella has broken the “Curse of the Green Bottle,” so for that I give props."

"of all the yucky euro stuff out there, i really think this might be the head of the class. green bottles usually turn me off, especially on imports, but when its fresh and freezing cold, stella isnt bad. pours a thin yellow color with pretty good carbonation before the head fades to nothing. smells like a pale lager, balanced but boring. flavor is the same, tolerable but unexiting. the thing that i think makes this one is the feel. its light without being water, and its bubbly without being soda, two things many of the american versions fail to accomplish. its infinitely drinkable for that reason, and not a bad brew on a hot day. overall i will never buy this, but i will always always chose it over the bud lights of the world."

""

"Overall, not terribly impressive, but better than your usual macros. Not quite a Yuengling, at least they have some flavor profile. Stella is just a smoother AAL that has slightly more body."

"O - A decent lager, but the appearance the introduction is the best part"

"The appearance is a bit of off yellow with a strange, off hue to it. Did not pour for a look at the head but would imagine it would be a thick or lumpy head based on the feel on the beer. The smell is very different, grassy hops and maybe a bit of corn? The taste is different, definitely not my favorite type of beer but not at all my least favorite. The mouthfeel is like beer mixed with Pop Rocks. It is difficult to explain but something that has to be tried to experience and understand, I think. The beer is carbonated but surprisingly smooth and would be a recommended beer to anyone who hasn't tried it."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavors and aromas."
""
""

"Taste is sweet and malty, but not bad. Thin-bodied, but smooth-drinking, like a fresher Heineken almost. But better than that may imply. There's nothing complex going on here, but not bad for what it is."
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a golden color body with a light fizzy head. The smell is of corn and grain. The taste is light ans same as the smell. The mouth feel is average. Overall a good session beer, i would rather drink this than any BMC."

"overall not a bad beer. sweet and refreshing with a slight bitterness at the end. golden color with a snow white head.decent lacing and a pleasant aroma. you will here much talk about how it's a skunky beer but i'd much rather drink this than a bud,coors or a miller. do yourself a favor and give it a fair try and i think you'll find what i did..a hidden little gem!"

"overall, having never tasted this beer before, i'm a bit disappointed even by euro lager standards. price point is especially bad. there are many others within this style i would rather drink before stella. i can't ever see myself revisiting this again after i polish off this 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden ale with a finger of fleeting loose white foam and brilliant clarity. Spotty lace. Smells of some skunk, white grapes, grain and a hint of hay. Taste is smooth with sweet grains and little else. Really quite drinkable, particularly from a green bottle. Light body with moderately hi carb. Not a bad beer for green bottle and potentially long light exposure, the moderate skunk sucks, but overall this beer isn't too shabby, and I particularly like it on tap during warmer months."
""
"Overall, an easy drinking lager, but not very impressive."
""
""
""
"O: Given the category this honestly isn't bad. Granted, the chances of getting a non-skunked pour due to the insane green bottles is very slim. But when it isn't skunked, it's a pretty inoffensive and subtle beer. That's putting it really nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad. An easy drinking, more flavorful alternative to AALs, but similar enough to please AAL drinkers. It's high price is a big turn off, however."
""
"Overall: I drank Stella a lot when I was learning that there were other beers out there besides Miller Lite. I enjoyed it then, but today, it's just an easy drinking, chuggable lager; nothing special, nothing desirable."

When I have a beer I like it to have something going on and this beer has a little to offer that way. Given a choice between this and a Budweiser I would choose this."

"Looks like Busch Light when poured from the bottle. Tastes like Sierra Mist. It's kinda clean. I was expecting more copper taste like Heineken but this one is cleaner. It's fizzy like champagne.

""
""

"It's funny that people think that imported macros (Stella, Beck's, Molson) are worth the extra money compared to their U.S. counterparts...not much of a difference in quality or taste really."
""

"Lean on flavour, but at least it's clean flavour. Not exactly my go-to beer, but I wont say I disliked it either. At least the gift set it came in contained a glass. Merry Christmas!"

"DRINKABILITY: This beer was crisp and refreshing (in the sense of thirst-quenching, not flavor). This is industrial beer -- flavored water a European version of Bud or Coors or Miller. I could drink a few of these -- particularly after working outside during the summer, I suppose, but there are so many other beers out there that are better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its not what I like, but for those who like this kind of beer its for you. For me though, it wasn't all that great or enjoyable. I would rather have me a nice stout or IPA. something exciting to taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light gold with a frothy white head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation bubbles seen rising to top when held to light. Taste is good, very crisp, with a mix of citrus and some fruity sweetness. Again, it is a smooth and very drinkable beer and does not have some of those skunky overtones seen in other euro lagers."
""
"I think I'll have this again."
"While this has more flavor than a bud or bud light the flavor here is just terrible. This is not as bad as a miller chill but damn it is bad!"
""
"Overall, this was nothing spectacular. It hits the style on the nose but reminds me too much of the big name lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"**Best before 26 07 12"
""
"O: This really may be the most average beer on the planet. Straight meh all the way through. Nothing offensive...but nothing at all redeeming, either. Oh, I guess it goes down easily enough."
"Overall: Excellent for drinking indoors or outdoors in little or large quantities."
""
""
"Heavily marketed with Bern Stern photos; obviously trying (and likely succeeding) at making this an “upscale” choice for those who don’t know any better. Skip it."
""
"Poured this European lager from a bottle into a pint glass. This lager poured a slightly hazy pale color, produced a nice white frothy head. Decent retention and decent amount of lacing left behind. The aroma of this lager consisted of sweet malted grain and a afterthought of hops. Light in body, this brew is sweet, dry graininess, and finishes with a bitter broccoli like finish that most european lagers are known for. Decent for a european lager, i have had worse but not something I would ever pay for again."
""

"Overall it is an ok beer but there are much better Euro pale lagers out there. A nice alternative to BMC though."

""

""
""
""
""
""
"T: It's better than a lot of the lagers out there, but it's still just not that good. Faint hops and slightly bready malts along with a faint hint of golden apples."

""
""
"This strikes me as only one step above being accurately labelled as a Belgian Budweiser."

"Overall pretty easy drinking, kind of ordinary, but about as basic as a simple lager gets I would say. I've had lots of this in my life on occasion, and out of the can it works out fine. Stay away from the bottles though, they are more than likely going to be skunked."

"O - I couldn't really find much of anything wrong with this beer. With all the not so great publicity this gets around these parts, it's not all that bad, especially considering the style."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure what I expected here, but overall I'm not impressed. It's a step above the typical ""big three."""
"I compare this to Heineken because it's almost exactly the same as far as aroma and taste profiles go."
"This is the best of the economical beers I have tasted. Some people say the bud light of belgium, but Belgium has some of the best beer in the world, so I am fine drinking quite possibly one of the best value beers out there. I do recommend this beer if u don't want to spend more on high class stuff."
"O-average lager nothing special, may be ok with pub food"
"O - better on a hot summer day, or with different food, I suppose."
"O- It's ok, but for all its name value its not that much better of a pale lager."
"Overall, good drinking for style. Serve cold."
"O- This is one of my very favorite macro's, and will take it any day over it's Euro lager kin. Yummy."
"O: Average beer, but still worthy of semi-craft status. Good mellow flavor and very refreshing to drink."
"alright lets be honest here. this beer is not getting poured into a tulip glass or a chalice. It is a classic lager and it is easy to drink alot of these bad boys. I picked up a 15 pack of 330ml bottles for my adventures at school in london. This beer is simple crisp and smooth. A great alternitive to the big three at home. Its always hard to turn down a cold stella. So all in all this is just a slightly better than average beer but it is definitely a good choice for easy drinking."
"Light grain, a shit ton of belgian slightly funk yeast, and mild hops. For the most part its just the yeast that stands out. Tongue follows, pretty balanced & light brew here. Not robust and rich as found in ales, but highly drinkable and crisp like a lager should be, in my opinion."
"O- not too bad although i think i prefer other lagers over this one. i also have had this with pizza before and it went well together."
"O: Definitely would have over and over have had this many times and realized have never rated it."
"Overhyped and near ubiquitous. For some reason it’s become a marker of a ‘classy’ joint, although there’s any number of better brews just as (or should be) widely available and around the same price point. Anyways, marketing aside this has that distinctive ‘Stella’ flavor profile. Consistent, in the way that I would expect it to be. (Again with the snark!) It was not unpleasant, which is about as generous as I’ll get with this beer. Drank it with pizza. They played well together."
"O-EPL-s are usually bad beers,but this one is more then that,it is good."
"O: Nothing too special. Only reason I still pick it up is due to nostalgia as it used to be a favorite."
"O - Not really into the style but this is definitely one of the better mass produced Euro Pale Lagers. I probably wouldn't buy it but if given to me I would drink it with no problems."
"Overall / Drinkability: Plus for nice appearance, but with the ingredients of malted barley, water, maize, yeast and hops, this is really an adjunct lager. It's odd...but I think the slightly skunked flavor adds some character to the beer when it's in a bottle. Otherwise, this beer is nothing special. Definitely drinkable, but a bit boring."
"Not bad, for what it is; the Bud of Belgium... But this is only barely a step above standard American adjunct lagers. Considering this was one of those ""strange"" beers I started put on back about 10 years ago, I'm surprised how much I find it lackluster now... And even more surprised to see I hadn't reviewed it."
"NOT recommended for purchase though (grins)"
"Overall Impression- I'm very glad I went out of my way to enjoy this brew again! (Haven't had in almost a year!) These brews aren't very poundable as they have quite a bit of flavor and hop presence. Will not be getting this often in the future but will say, go and get yourself some of the new Stella cans! Very nice. Too bad I don't have the glassware that goes with it..."
"I will not try this again, unless it is the only beer option."
"O/D - Not tasty at all. I would never buy this and I'm glad it was free. Typical of the style I guess."
"Clear, golden color with a frothy white head. Aromas are typical grain, with a hint of spice and the faint skunky smell that is common in a lot of European lagers that are imported to the US. Flavors of grain, slightly spicy hops, and a faint yeastiness that distinguishes this beer, in my view, from other large-production European lagers that it otherwise tastes like. An easy drinking style that works fine for washing down lunch or taking a break on a warm afternoon."
"O: I have heard good things about this beer most of my life and actually never had one until now. I probably won't ever have one again either, unless its free (this one was.) It is just boring and overrated, popular only because others say so and comes along with a strong marketing campaign. The worst Belgian beer I have ever had."
"It is very lightly carbonated, on the verge of being flat. It is fairly light in body, making it easy to drink. Overall it is not terrible, and is certainly better than the standard BMC fare. However, for the price, there are much better options out there."
"cheers."
"Overall: More fuller bodied and flavorful than American Predecessors. I can see why it gets slightly higher ratings. But then again that's why they are under different guidelines. This is definitely a beer that I would like to have on hand for a rainy day ""go to"" beer. Especially in the can because I just don't trust green bottles anymore."
"Note about nomenclature: You have to refer to it as ""Stella"" or you get a blank look from the server. Anglo-American and Spanish-speaking waitpersons can't and won't say ""Artois"". If you explain that the second word of the name is pronounced ""ar-TWAH", they just smile and shake their heads as if you're speaking Martian."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, much better than the Bud Lights of the world, but nothing special."
"Carbonation gives it some bite, flavor is pretty standard otherwise. When I say that, I don't mean standard for a Belgian beer. This is not nearly as interesting or complex as the typical Belgian fare, but it is a very drinkable beer. A friend of mine once called it the ""Budweiser of Belgium."" True dat."
"I picked a six up at the pizza shop to try. Overall, not bad, but this won't be a repeat purchase. A head that dissipates quickly, typical coloring for a lager, nondescript taste. I will say that it has a nice crispness to it that stays throughout the serving. Not worth the price."
"O: Good, a very good lager."
"Overall: A decent, but not overwhelming Euro Lager. I guess that's what you get for a 5.0% ABV beer with a shelf life of (at least) nine months."
"D - Simple, but unoffensive. One of the better macro-lagers I've tried."
"The head is weak anf fades to nothing quickly, the taste is citrusy and bland. Not the worst thing I ever tasted but I would not try again."
"O: Typical Euro lager. Nothing really special or something I would grab again."
"A refreshing albeit tasteless and essentially passionless beer."
"Ovearll this is a great beer. It is not something I would drink all of the time but it compliments meals perfectly. It is refreshing in all seasons."
"Overall, this is not a bad lager, and certainly better than the other extremely famous euro lager (Heineken). It is on the pricey side though. The canned version is better than the bottle in the reviewer's opinion."
"O: Though it's easy to hate on this beer, when it's not completely skunked, it's not an awful one."
"22oz bottle poured vigorously into a 16oz glass (nothing larger around). Head is extremely weak at 1 finger (if that), and lacing is mediocre. Smell is typical of light lagers. It smells no better than an AB product IMHO. Tastes of strong wheat with citrus and very slight hops. Just slightly more carbonated than seltzer water and leaves a mild hop/water taste in your mouth that fades quickly. Not a horrible beer but I won't be spending my money on it anytime soon."
"The appearance gave me high hopes for this beer.Nice clear golden color with robust head and lacing. However,as soon as I put my nose close to the glass,an ejecting odor quilled my taste buds. Fortunately the taste is much better than the smell,but it too was weak. One would think a better beer with all the pomp"
"For the advertising you'd think this is awesome. Poured from the foil sealed green bottle into a tall pilsner glass. Fluffy thin head lasted a little bit at least. Golden, corn color. Smells of euro funk but in a not so bad way. Typical euro lager malts with just a touch of hops on the back end. Easy to drink and looks impressive to non-BA friends. Kind of a guilty pleasure for me."
"Nothing wrong with the beer, but there is nothing that stands out either."
"Mediocre at best."
"Overall a nice beer if not very special. Good for a macro."
"A decent brew."
"O: Overall, I'd say this beer is alright. I never thought I'd see it in a can, but its not bad. When I saw a single I knew I just had to give it a shot. Certainly tastes more fresh and clean than the bottled version. But still just an average beer in the end."
"Drinkability is high, appreciable euro lager characteristics, very sessionable and refreshing beer. Great summer refresher."
"O - Not a bad beer, and at a event serving macros only it isn't bad deal. Just not anything special and certainly not a beer to represent Belgium."
"O: Better than I expected. More enjoyable than the BMC offerings. Could drink a few of these with no real problem."
"O- I can't help but moderately enjoy this brew. I had just come back from heavy exercise and was chilling out and yes, this went down fairly well. Saying that, Stella is still average at very best. The fact that it is part of a style that is so saturated with seemingly carbon clones of each other speaks for itself, but as they say: there is a time and place for everything."
"I think the quality of this beer is relative to the situation. In my case it was the better of multiple evils and I was at a beach bar, and it was hot out. If I were to have this beer at home or at a restaurant, it would certainly be a lot worse."
"Overall, a decent sipping beer. But for the price I could do a lot better. Or I could get a comparable quality beer for a lot less. It's an entirely unremarkable beer. Avoid it in favor of its competitors, unless you really want to try it."
"Overall, I would compare this beer to a slightly spicier Coor's light, really not impressing. I sadly would not buy this beer ever again or recommend it to anyone. No reason to drink it but I guess it is better than some of the other options out there (BCM)"
"Presented in its own branded glass, the beer has a medium golden yellow color and a big, fluffy white head. The aroma presents only a faint combination of light grains and a bit of the flowery and musty hops that one expects from a Euro lager. The flavor is similarly light, with a bready sweetness being complemented by a mild hop bitterness that had characteristics of lemon and dirt/earth. The lightness continues through the texture, with a club-soda-like effervescence lightening the medium body. Overall, this beer is light and pleasant yet somewhat substantial, making it not quite the crisp refresher that is often desirable in the style."
"I could drink these all afternoon. They weren't anything to look forward to, but there was nothing wrong with this label."
"If your looking to go out of your comfort zone this is a decent beer to start and is available at most stores. I do recommend it on draft ins a Stella glass I think it makes it taste much better."
"As far as I'm concerned, Stella is a unique beer. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. Nevertheless, I seem to always come back it. There's just something about it that I admire."
"Overall: Ok for a lighter tasting lager, but not much different than a typical corn filled adjunct lager."
"Overall, it's generic swill. Basically beer water. Do not want."
"O: Not much more to say. Better than a BMC in my opinion, so given my options I may have it again."
"what can you say that hasn't been said; i've never been terribly impressed with S.A. pours crystal clear straw yellow, marginal head. smell is faint malt, even fainter (is that a word?) hops, and more than a little grassy. taste - blah. adjuncty mess. whatever."
"A ""fancy"" glass doesn't make a beer good."
"Fun on occasion."
"Selected from the choices at home run inn pizza, served on tap. With a smirk I notice that Stella gets the same grade as busch shock top! Get a grip! This is a nIce summer beer that is refreshing, quenches the thirst and leaves pleasant to no aftertaste. If I come in here wanting something to wash down my pizza and cool off, mission a ccomplished bitches. A complex bouquet of toasted plums and smoky leather couch cigar lingering onthe palate is not on order/.Well anyway it was the best thing home runn inn pizza carries"
"Pours a very thin gold color w/ almost no head. Smell is very thin, weak and bitter smelling. Not impressed at all. Taste is the same as the nose. Very thin, bitter, and nondescript. Not sure why anybody would actually drink this beer if there were better options. I'm actually embarrassed that this beer comes from the country it does. Would almost rather not have a beer than drink this one."
"Pours a nice clean golden yellow, with a 1 finger head and decent retention. The smell is very earthy on the nose, grassy, dirt, mixed with a nice touch of lemon citrus. Not too much in the taste department, grainy, lemons...not much. Very light and crisp, sweet on the finish. This is a decent beer would go well on a nice summer day, but not for the price they want."
"Poured on-tap and served in a goblet, although I didn't see the ""official"" pour technique, not that I was overly concerned. The beer poured an orange-gold coloring, with a dense, thick, foamy head. Citrus and coriander aromas, with a sweet, malty backbone. Silky, smooth flavors with tons of coriander and nutmeg spicing on a light, creamy smooth foundation. Almost a bit overspiced. The finish is almost sharp, with nutmeg and cinnamon flavors, and the finish becomes an amalgamut of spices and slight sweetness in a creamy, but sharp, finish."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"2 fingers of white foam on top of a clear golden body. Streams of tiny bubbles. Good lacing, head never completely disappears. Smells of clean pale malts and a little skunk. More skunk in the taste. Decently hopped for the style. Crisp, refreshing, finishes dry. It's a pretty ""meh"" Euro pale lager as is, but it would be much better without the skunkiness."
"Tried this after watching Discovery Channel on different breweries. Was quite impressed with the smoothness of the beer, which went down smooth but of enough premium quality to where it is best savored than drunk."
"Pale gold color and a soda pop head when poured aggressively. Tiny head stays around. No lacing. Smell is exactly what I expected, which is very little with no trace of any skunking. Taste is very light with nothing standing out. A trace of white grape, malt and a bit of hop. VERY clean and dry finish. Mouthfeel is also light and bubbly. Paired this with a great pepperoni pizza and got exactly what I was after, a light, bubbly, cold and refreshing brew that counters the grease and salt perfectly. Purely for refreshment. If you're in the mood for big flavor, this is not gonna do it."
"D: pretty classic and can expect it at several ritzier metropolitan restaurants that have few taps."
"Overall the beer was not bad, it just wasn't any good and certainly not worth import prices. It is a boring Euro Lager with no character or personality. No wonder it is (or was) trendy in Manhattan. I really have yet to find a green bottled beer that I like. Save your money and buy Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"I got a nice Crack & Glug going and it resulted in a dense finger of foamy, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the distinctive bubble gum sweetness that I always associate with Stella Artois. I am sure that it is a product of their proprietary yeast strain, but it is odd in a lager (unless you brew for Minhas). Mouthfeel was medium and it had a mild sweetness on the tongue, not pronounced with bubble gum, but present. Good lacing was beginning to form in the glass. Finish was semi-dry, refreshing, but not fulfilling. I was glad to have gotten the opportunity to try it in a CAN, but it is not worthy of cooler space."
"O - used to be one of my favorites before opening my eyes - now I can only see it for what it lacks - that being said still drinkable"
"O: I seriously cannot detect much notable difference between this and Budweiser (or whatever other BMC you want to sub in). I'm not a total snop -- I drink BMC more often than I'd like to admit -- but Stella has a premium pricetag while giving swill quality. The only people I can imagine buying this are beer ignoramuses that want to look cultured, but secretly can't handle anything beyond good ol' BMC flavor. This stuff may have been passable fifteen years ago as the bros suggest, but not now."
"Overall, this is what it is; a well made but pretty bland lager. Although my brother (not a beer aficionado) proclaims this as is favorite beer, its just not flavorful enough for me, especially for the price point. However, if you need something poundable that is still actually a beer, this might be exactly what you're looking for."
"M/O. A nice crisp clean smooth beer that is a nice easy drinking and relaxing beer. This may just be the best or one of the best macros available to drink."
"Half litre can, brewed in Belgium but only 5.0 abv compared with 5.2 for Stella that stays in Belgium. Poured into a pint glass, it had one fat finger head. Amber colour, poor retention of the head. Faint industrial lager smell, slight hops. Sweetish taste gave way to a bit of grain. Went down ok, it's a decent euro lager."
"Kicking it in Brazil at a local establishment (The Double B!!!) and my host was buying Stella for session purposes. Unfortunately...this night Stella just wasn't doing it for me....seemed very heavy and not satisfying. The color is golden and clear with good corbonation. There is noe smell other than grain. The taste seemed heavy that evening and there was a grain taste present. The mouthfeel again was rated lower due to the ""heavyness"" that evening. Its an ok beer...certainly better than Budwieser!"
"Final Grade: 3.22, a C+."
"O: This is a very good example of a Pale Lager and is much better that its American counterparts. This beer is perfect for someone wanting to enjoy a few drinks without getting something very hardy."
"This brew was okay. I would easily take a Heineken over this brew. I feel this is just a heineken clone. Clean taste, a tad bitter and dry finish. I really believe this is one if not the worst belgian brew I have ever had though. Hoonestly as one of my rules if Budweiser is the distrubutor of the product it normally is not worth drinking. IMO"
"O - Another average beer available in Brazil. Out of the three that I have tried (Brahma, Bohemia, and this one) I'd have to go with Brahma (though that's not saying much)"
"O: Really honest and decent Lager for a macro brewery. Probably the worst Belgians can do :p. Suitable for a hot sunny day..."
"Overall, I'm a little underwhelmed but happy it's not trash, not a bad alternative to some of the american macros"
"O: You know what you’re getting when you drink Stella. It’s better then most macros so if you’re looking for something easy to drink you can’t go wrong with Stella."
"I think this is an all around good beer indeed. Its appearance is probably the most appealing to people because of all those billboards and hip commercials. The only problem with this beer is that it doesn't really have that good of a flavor to it. You can drink plenty but you simply don't get that much flavor like you would out of a Heineken or something. Decent beer for whenever but I'd rather take a Heineken."
"Oh Stella!, Meh well, its a decent brew. Really nothing special about this European Lager. Its a bit to bubbly for my tastes, and I've even had bottles that just seem beyond overcarbed at times. Had that musty smell that hits the nose as soon as the bottlecap pops off. While I don't think this beer is ""special"" by any means, its a good beer. I've spent many nights around a campfire with friends and a case of Stella..."
"D - I had this at an airport waiting for my flight, my choices were this or Bud/Bud Light; I think I chose wisely; I've always enjoyed this beer from the few macros I actually drink"
"Overall- I personally think this beer is a little overrated for how much hype it gets. It's easy to drink and goes down smooth, but then again so does water. It might just be that I got a bad six pack, but from what I read I'm not too far off the norm."
"M - Thinner, but quenching. A little over-carbonated. A good summer beer at least."
"This beer is pretty generic. The color is a golden yellow a fizzy white head. The aroma smells like a traditional lager, it's kinda got a sour aroma. The flavor is kind of like a pilsner, it's a little grassy but it has some hops too. The mouthfeel is light enough to drink a few in a row if you want to. My thoughts on this beer overall is that this beer is indeed a generic lager made in Belgium. Not a whole lot more to really say about this one."
"-Beer Distributor, Brussels, Belgium"
"After a long day, the first sip was a welcome thirst quencher, but after that it was not of my taste. To me it is like the typical mass production beers. Not much to it."
"D: Really don't like this stuff but it has its better qualities. Still don't understand the use of green bottles. I think Europeans secretly giggle every time an American pops open a skunked Stella, Heineken, Grolsch, or Pilsner Urquell and then goes on to extol its virtues. Sad."
"Aroma is Standard European Macro grassy aroma. Light, very crisp body. Taste is light grassy hops and bready malt. High carbonation makes it difficult to drink. I poured a half of the bottle down the drain. I find it insulting to call this brew Belgian."
"Pours straw yellow with a nice head. Very, very pale beer. Not as good it's cracked up to be. I think I'd rather have a Carona. Is this made with corn? Seems to have a thicker mouthfeel than American adjunct lagers. Not much flavor to this beer. I can't detect any malt flavor, and the hops are low profile too. I have only tried this once before, and I remembered it being alot better. Probably won't try again unless it's Artois or Budweiser."
"It's a decent brew although nothing exciting and certainly on one of the bottom rungs for Belgians. You can do a heck of a lot worse and you can do a heck of a lot better. I'd put this one in the lower quartile of drinkable lagers."
"This beer is a very light clear beer that pours with no head. When you smell it, it almost smells like it is a skunked beer. This is a very smooth light easy drinking beer. There is a basic layer of hops and spice flavor in this beer. None of the flavors are over powering, and this beer is a great thirst quencher. A good beer to have on a hot day. Cheers."
"Good beer."
"One of my favorite Euro maco lagers. Pours out with a. Golden straw color and decent carbonation. Whispy head laces the glass. Smells of grass and graqins but overall very clean. Taste is of hop extract and pale malt sweetness. Despite the cheap hops it is refreshing and it tingles the palate. Not too drying not to wet. Overall this is a standard beer that is drinkable and moderate in price."
"O: Overall, the beer is not offensive, but is just lacking in flavor and aroma."
"Overall: Strong within the mass produced class of lagers, good to offer visitors something decent who do not appreciate craft beer"
"Overall: This beer would be okay with standard bar fare, such as wings, pizza, etc. By itself, it just doesn't have much appeal. I don't care to have another, but it isn't a terrible beer."
"Light and refreshing enough, but I'm not compelled to have this again."
"O- i gave this an extra .5 because i could drink more than one, the taste is just not what i enjoy in a beer."
"Overall-a fine lager but not worth the price premium you pay here in the US. Stick with a PBR, MGD, or another domestic lager and save your money for something else."
"MF- Light and clean body that lets the flavor sit for awhile. Not saying they're great flavors, but they are there."
"not a great aftertaste, and a bit watery but not too much, but overall a ok beer"
"It does finish crisply, but not impressive overall. However, I would pick this over its big macro conglomerate sister Budweiser if I had a choice."
"Quite enjoyable and very easy to go beer, I would not hesitate to pick this one up amongst the choice of vast European's lagers."
"In my opinion this beer is not to bad it has a nice taste to it. It also taste better then most other lager type beers. I would recommend this beer even though it can be a little pricey just give a try you may end up liking it. I recommend you try it while you eat pizza or some hot wings it goes good with food to."
"Overall, I was not impressed. Very overrated. Probably won't drink again."
"D: It is unoffensive overall and that is all I hoped for anyway."
"Standard bar fare."
"Not much different than a BMC beer, resembles a Miller. Greatly overrated by the average American"
"The CPJ"
"OVERALL: This was simply an undrinkable beer."
"But It looks like a standard Lager, with little to make it stand out from the multitude of lagers. It is incredibly drinkable though most lagers are."
"Finished my glass but not without a struggle, noted that I will never buy again."
"Sadly I expected way too much from this one, but in all fairness, they had a Superbowl commercial, Bud is distributing them everywhere, its becoming a very popular beer. Despite what people say i've had some damn good lagers in my day, this isn't one. There's hardly any taste, kinda bland, not much aroma. I like how one dude used sticky as an adjective, it has a very sticky aftertaste. Theres not really much to say about this one except it reminded me of a cheaper Moosehead or St. Pauli Girl. Maybe the Keger is better than the bottle but definitely nothing amazing about this one. Good party beer but than again BA's don't drink party beers at a gathering, they drink session stuff like SN Pale Ale. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Long lasting white foamy head with decent lacing. Banana nut smell. Very refreshing smelling, no bitterness whatsoever, but not sickly sweet. Light wheaty taste with a very slight skunkiness to it. Mouthfeel is too sticky and syrupy. Not a bad beer, but I probably won't ever go out of my way to pick another one up."
"Extremely clear pale yellow color. White head, pretty good lacing. A ton of carbonation. Smells metallic, artificial. Mouthfeel is very watery and bubbly. Low level of bitterness but there may be a hint of hops. Better than average for a beer produced on such a large scale, but their ad campaign that is based on this being a world-class beer is laughable."
"12 oz into a pint glass...pretty much just looks like the pale yellow swill we're used to seeing from BMC but with a fancier name and bottle. Maybe once upon a time in Belgium this was an excellent beer, but now it's clearly just mass produced trash with little flavor and even less character. Pass on this one every time, not worth your time."
"Poured from a 12oz into a Samuel Smith pint. Pours a clear straw with only half inch of head and not much lace. Smells like stale grain with a lemon squeezed on it. Eh. The taste isn't as dusty, but super watery and light. Hard to believe it's beer. Citrus hops make it taste like lemon water. The mouthfeel, lemon water. To be honest, anyone could probably down these all day or party on 'em all night... but is it worth it. Eh..."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink, although I'm not sure if I would try another because the taste wasn't very interesting."
"This beer is highly drinkable, it's pretty average all around but still does the trick."
"This pours a straw yellow with solid carbonation and a 3 finger frothy head that lines the glass. Smells very skunky. Soap and bread aromas also come through. Smells pretty similar to other big market lagers. Taste is not very good at all. Skunk up front and skunk to finish. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and drinkability is mediocre. This is a beer that I get when there is absolutely nothing else available such as when I am at various restaurants."
"Drinkability: Didn't finish my pint."
"D > Dont do it, gross"
"Drinkability - Well, I just polished off the bottle and am about to get another, so I'd say pretty drinkable."
"This is flavourless crap"
"D: Better on warm days. A decent beer to team up with wings, a hot dog or ballpark nachos."
"I think the marketing has a lot to do with the selling of Stella. I've heard it called the ""Natty of the European world," and unfortunately, I can't argue with that. It has substance, if just a little bit; and maybe as such, makes the Natty statement unfair. I'm just not terribly impressed with it. As a Belgian, it betrays itself. It's trying to sell itself before it's trying to contribute to a larger body of taste that its country is capable of, and this is saddening. I wouldn't pay any more than .60USD for 12FLoz. I believe that it could be a lot more than it is right now, especially if they claim a heritage that hearkens back to 1366. Let's see it."
"Pours a darker gold color. Not really yellow but not quite amber either. A limited head with limited retention. The nose was limited overall but some grainy notes as well as some lager yeast characteristics. Very clean overall but if you really start looking you can pick out some lighter hop notes. The taste has more of a malty presence than what the nose indicated. Some grainy tastes that blend well with a very light caramel flavor. The hops are basically non-existent leaving a sweet finish. The beer itself is rather wispy and tones down the sweeter flavors. Some lighter yeast finish but nothing too bad. The body is light but understandable for style. A clean taste but not as crisp for style either. A very easy drinking beer to say in the least."
"D- stella is very very drinkable. Good flavor makes this big time drinkable"
"Stella appears a crystal clear corn/gold head. The super thin wispy white head dissipates almost immediately, and leaves no real lace behind. The nose has a very light pale grainy note, with a faint herbal hoppiness just making itself apparent. The taste is no better. There's a hint of bland, nondescript sweetness, and some DMS flavors, and an almost imperceptible noble hop note. The body blows past light and lands squarely in watery territory. The carbonation at least is fairly decent, just bubbly enough to make an impression. To be honest, the kindest thing I can say about Stella is that it could have been worse. I only ordered it because it's on the list for the Cloverleaf's MBA program, and I don't see myself getting another one anytime soon."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Good carbonation. Light & crisp, even with being a touch sweet. Dusty as it warms. Twinge of acid is perfect. Too bad the beer tastes terrible. I'm embarrassed that I drank half of one of these straight from a bottle earlier & didn't even wince. Jets suck."
"D: to hang in a bar this one does the trick, it's pleasant to the senses. I think it's very drinkable."
"On tap in dark supper club. Looked about what Stella should look like. Pale yellow, clear, little head and some lacing. Smelled likeStella should. Malt and unidentifiable grains. Tastes like a Stella should, which is a fairly neutral lager, easily drinkable and leaves little aftertaste. The best part, very drinkable."
"Brought to me in a plain ol glass. Head of one finger, maybe it was sitting for a while before it was brought to me. Lace at the very top of the glass. Color was a warm yellow, teetering on orange/brown. Judging the color, I don't even know if it was a Stella Artois. Smell was wheat, corn, malt. Taste was a little heavy for a pale lager, but had flavors of roasted wheat, oats, honey, barley, and light on the hops. Very thin on the mouth feel category, more like watered down beer, than beer. It was beer, I just don't know if it was a Stella Artois. I challenged the waiter and got a second for free. It looked and tasted the same."
"All around, this pale lager was much easier to drink than I had led myself to believe. And with the average abv, I could see myself spending another evening with Stella."
"Bought on a whim. Poured into my Ommegang Hennepin goblet. First thing I noticed was lack of any head. Very pale yellow color, almost clear straw. Smells skunky, not impressed..much like Heineken. Taste is smooth, watery, above average carbonation, hop finish is a little strong. Would not spend my money on this again; Harp is a much better representation of the style."
"Food match: Roast pork, roast chicken or a casserole dish. As for vegetarians: fried potatoes, green beans and tofurkey."
"Drinkability: Even without a slight degree of skunkiness that did eventually fade, I didn't really enjoy this beer much. The best that can be said for it is that it is better than some Euro Pale Lagers I've had and no worse than most. I'll probably not be having this beer again and honestly the only reason I had this one is that it was part of a gift package."
"This beer surprised me, I was expecting it to be just like Heineken or some other skunky beer, but it actually wasn't all that bad. It poured and looked just like a skunky imported beer did, and the smell wasn't knock your socks off. But when I drank it, it wasn't bad. It has a nice crisp taste, a little bit hoppy, a little bit sweet malt taste. And the most surprising thing was that there was very little skunk to speak of. Still not an amazing beer, I would say average. But for sure more than I was expecting. Not a bad beer."
"D: This is probably one of the most drinkable beers on the planet. It goes down easy, is fairly pleasant tasting, has a good level of carbonation and sits very nicely in the stomach making this one hell of a sessionable beer. Yes, it's simple. Yes it's overpriced. But once you get over that, it's not so bad, and a good fridge beer."
"Stella Artois has become quite a good beer. It is very good for a widely disributed lager beer. It has the typical, average yellow color, mild carbonation, minimal head, a somewhat fragrant aroma and goes down smooth. A bit pricy at most bars, but definitely better than Bud or Coors."
"Notes- I like it, it's not great but I'd drink it anyday. It's downfall is just its lack of character and boldness."
"My friend summed this beer up the best, ""A rich man's Coors Light"""
"InBev AB major import from Belgium to US. If they toned down the strength, it would be better. There is an after taste that I can not pinpoint but it doesn't agree with me. I have had in belgium before and don't remember such a poor experience, maybe if they make it local it would be fresher."
"D - goes down easy."
"Stella Artois was pale gold in color with excellent clarity. It had a thick head with good retention and lacing. The smell was skunky right out of the bottle, but quickly faded leaving light malt and noble hops. The taste was light malt with some light hops and a little bitterness. The finish was dry and a touch bitter. The mouthfeel was average with a light body and plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall it's a pretty good Euro Pale Lager that is thirst-quenching and refreshing."
"Overall, it is about as average as average can get for a Euro pale lager. Nothing offensive but nothing interesting either. Don't understand why this one is so hyped up and carries a high price tag."
"If you enjoy beers like Bud, Coors, Miller etc. you'd like this one too. Nothing groundbreaking or earth shattering....just a very drinkable brew!"
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, lingering dryness from unpleasant hop profile. Drinks well enough to throw one back when there's nothing else available or for a nightcap when you can't taste much anymore. Neither of these are good qualities."
"Sole redeeming quality is that it will get you hammered without next-day recriminations."
"Cheers!"
"A little carbonated for my taste but not offensive."
"overmarketed, bland and to expensive for what you get."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Overall, it's a good BBQ session beer; something to drink a lot of. It's a nice looking Holiday bottle but not worth the effort to open it like a champagne or wine bottle. If I ever have this again, I hope it's in a regular twelve ounce bottle."
"D- This is better than Bud or Miller but not by much. Why is this a hip beer? Very sessionable."
"D/O- Well if you want to go there, drink a lot of these. At 5% it is very doable. Whether you'd want to is a different story. You see this in people's hands because they think they're ""beer snobs", it's weird."
"remember, an ""A" for one style isn't the same as an ""A" for a more aggressive, master style (like the DIPA or stout or .... etc)"
"Verdict: Stella is the very definition of average beer. Nowhere near as hopeless as an American macro, but not terribly complex or unique either, this fits right in the middle of the quality spectrum. A worthy stepping-stone beer."
"The heavy amounts of head held the flavors in the beer for an extended period of time. However, it failed to hold onto any scents that Stella Artois may have had. Dipping our noses deep into the glass and using all of our nasal capacity brought the scent of faint malts and nothing else. The taste, on the other hand, did not match the faintness of the smell. Malts are the base of all flavors within the brew, almost masking the offensive tastes of tobacco and herbs. To complete the flavor spectrum, a hint of hop-pop was found on the tongue. This beer is bolder than the average domestic adjunct lager, however the unpleasant tobacco and herb flavors left a mild cringe to the face. A smooth texture across the tongue left a slightly bitter lingering afterthought. Knock-backablle, but this beer costs more than its taste."
"D: Can't handle the taste to make this beer even drinkable"
"Overall: It had made a while that i had Stella and i know why. Boring with no depth though it isn't really offensive."
"I saw made in Belgium on the label. I am sorry to say to say this is the Belgian equivelent of American Budweiser."
"I give a Schlitz for this beer, which doesn't make it much of a value."
"D: Dull and bland, fine for a session"
"Poured crystal clear golden/straw yellow with an inch of fluffy white head out of a corked and caged 750. Smells a bit grainy, but it's not overtly sweet like an adjunct lager. There's also a grassy note with a hint of pepper. You can pick up a little noble hops. Taste is similar. The grainy sweetness is dominant, but there's a taste on the back end reminiscent of a german pils. The carbonation has some bite. Just a clean, crisp drinkable beer. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this is probably my favorite."
"Light bodied beer is mildly carbonated and is fairly drinkable as a thirst quencher on a hot day."
"Good carbonation but pretty thin stuff. Goes down ok I guess, but I think Coors Light is cheaper."
"Drinking at the Skylark Lounge with my wife last night, feeling bogged down by the heavy beers I'd been consuming all evening, I saw the Stella tap and figured why not? After all, I'd never had it. Having had it once now, I doubt I'll ever have it again. It was just short of decent, well carbonated, clear yellow with a nice white head. Crisp and clean, drinkable, with a hint of hops, some biscuit and a touch of sweet malt."
"Taste is very sweet both up front and aftertaste...malty...corn perhaps, but its very sweet, unique flavor...so sweet in the aftertaste. I think it lacks real character and is one dimensional but if you like lagers that are easy drinking give it a try."
"This is one of those beers that would be just fine watching a game or pounding a 6 pack with friends. Although even in those cases I would probably just buy some yuengling."
"I've never had Stella on tap and I got what I was expecting, not much. Little carbonation with no head. With light hop, yeast, and earthy tones, the aroma is lacking. Light, watery body with fruit and hop tones. I'm still upset I paid $5 for this. D-Train should have ordered a High Life instead."
"Taste-Grain, faint biscuit, crisp and clean with a small hop note in the finish. Easy to drink, but nothing special going on here."
"Bottle at barbeque, pours a straw yellow, with very thin head. Aroma of light malt, some cereal, light hops. Taste is similar to aroma. Palate is light body, and light watery carbonation. Finish is light malty and cereal, very little hops. Overall good served very cold on a summer day."
"drinkability: very easy to drink, not so tasty in any way. good with food,bbq.."
"D- Not impressive. Easy enough to swallow if you can get past the skunk."
"Fizzy with a moderate hop bite. Good accompaniment to my bacon cheeseburger. Drinkable euro macro lager. MUCH better that from a green bottle! A good bet when it's on tap and you're looking for an easy drinking lager with more flavor than a BMC. Not bad."
"The pour is a very light golden color with a slight white head and not very much lacing. The nose is some really light grain husks plus a touch of light hopping. The taste is some very light floral and earthy hops plus some mild grain. The feel is ever-so-slightly bitter with a pretty good dose of carbonation and is certainly light. Decent body, but doesn't taste very good."
"O - Nothing overly special here though its tasty and drinkable and I will admit it's one of my preferred beers for social occasions. Unfortunately it can be expensive for what your getting and there are others similar to it that are probably cheaper. Overall a solid euro pale lager."
"D: Easily drinkable. A bit more flavorful than many EPL's."
"D: Easy drinking and the flavor is ok when it's there."
"Pours a ugly thin yellow straw color with a thick white head and some slimy looking lacing. Smells of grain and some sweet corn. Tastes of creamed corn and some simple grain and simple syrup. Pretty sweet. Nasty taste, very one note. Mouthfeel is really thin and drinkability is poor."
"I haven't had this in a year or so, so I decided to give this another try since there was nothing good on tap. Pours a straw yellow colour with thin white head. Almost no lacing. Smells quite metallic with some grains. Taste is pretty bland, a bit sweet with no real bitterness. Ok carbonation. I know people say this is better than typical North American macros, but I don't see it."
"D-Very easy drinking, just not anything to get real excited about, which has more to do with the style than this particular beer. I had low expectations and this was better than I hoped for."
"Pours a clear gold with a very fine white head. fine bubbles, and smells pretty grainy and kinda sweet but bitter aftertasting.. not a super beer but its not too bad either. im gonna try this one on tap somewhere and see if its the same. cause i think this one may be slightly skunked. not a super beer like everyone says. but i think the rating on this site says it all. not that good"
"Ive had this beer in both a bottle and on-tap, I perfer it on tap. The aroma is slightly hopy and grainy. Clear pale yellow in color with a white head that disaptes evenly with some lacing. Crisp, clean flavor filled with malt and light hoppyness. Drinks easy better than any of the big threes lagers."
"Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with a frothy white head that quickly settles into a light ring. The aroma is slightly grainy with a bit of a peppery hop spice, typical euro lager aroma. The taste is of carbonated water, some light grain and light peppery spice. I always thought that Stella had at least a very slight Belgian yeast flavor but I do not find that now. Again, pretty standard euro lager, though cleaner flavors. The feel is watery with very crisp carbonation; finishes like water. Not much substance to this beer; some light beer flavor but that is about it. However, it doesn't have any real negative flavors its just blah. I guess this beer is good to quench a thirst but that is about it, not much flavor going on."
"It's imminently drinkable and one of the best beers I have had in this style. It's smooth all the way, and even though it is quite sweet, it's really a delicious beer."
"Drinks easily...A bit bolder than others in this class like heineken , harp, becks. Given the choice I'll go with a Stella."
"Honestly, I just wanted to look fancy during Quizzo, so I ordered this, knowing full well the glass it would come in. Pinky up! It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises corn syrup, wheat, rice, and flowers. The taste doesn't deviate much from this formula, though the rice isn't really that prevalent here. Some very light sweetgrass notes pop up as well. The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat watery feel. Overall, a very OK brew, nothing close to Earth-shattering, but drinkable enough, especially when just hanging out at a normal bar while trying not to get destroyed in pub trivia. (I hate losing...)"
"D: Honestly, I'm not sure what the big deal is about this beer. I think people drink it so they can be seen drinking something exotic without having to explore new territory. I mean, the beer is actually more palatable if I hold my nose to drink it. It's not even as good as Chang or Singha or TsingTao or Heineken, and at the price they're asking - and for giving you almost a full ounce less per bottle - I'd go with any of those other beers. Yes, even the Chang."
"Overall, I highly recommend drinking Stella Artois on tap. Its much more flavorful and refreshing than in bottle form."
"D: This is pretty much a standard green bottle type Euro beer. They go down easy, but not something you really reach for."
"Drinkability : Good for the price. Would like to try how does it taste like on draft since can beer's quality is lower."
"The drinkabilty of this brew isnt bad at all. I would drink it again ."
"To my knowledge this is the first Euro Pale Lager I've had and I'm not very familiar with this style."
"I don't seek this beer out, but I can't say I don't occasionally drink it---my wife has a habit of grabbing me a 12 occasionally at grocer."
"Conclusion: The guy at the liquor store told me this was one of the best beers that he carried. This is a store that actually has some good craft for sale. His reason was that Stella feels smoother and doesn't have any of the 'bite' that characterizes lagers. I don't buy it... This isn't a bad beer but is just like so many others I can't think of anything more to say. If I were to buy a quantity of this style I would buy Kronenbourg 1664 in a heartbeat."
"This beer pours a nice clear golden straw color that would be expected for the style. There is a nice finger of frothy foam that has really nice head retention. The aroma is a little bad. It has the stale citrus smell of hops gone skunked, to which I blame the green bottle. Other aromas are a pale corn malt smell that I don't really care for. The taste is really not much to talk about. There's some sweet maltiness from the corn but overall, there's really nothing there. Which I take as a positive due to the smell of it. The mouthfeel is surprisingly refreshing and clean on the palate and well carbonated. I would actually venture as to say this beer is quite drinkable. Surprised as I may be to say it this isn't that bad of a beer, but I wouldn't pay too much for it."
"Found this to be very uninspiring. Pours with a good head and a decent golden color. However, after that it is downhill in my opinion. In fairness I like a heavier beer. I was hoping for more being from Belgium, but the beer has just a slight touch of bitterness that I am not fond of and little taste otherwise. Reminds me of Heineken. I guess I'd drink it if someone else was buying but there are a lot of things in the cooler I'd turn to first."
"D: Goes down smooth and easy. I would never buy this beer myself, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at it."
"D= I would basically drink this of like a miller light. I think it's overated and really don't see anything special about this one..."
"Just because it is from Belgium doesn't mean it's great but it is a decent beer to drink after a long run or bike ride. It purs a light golden into my Coors Banquet beer pilsner glass and starts with a nice full head but no fireworks go off or anything. I could certailny do better for $7 a six pack but sometimes you need to reset the taste buds and this is a good lager to do that with. Hey, I'm a hop head so I certainly wouldn't want to do it with a Budweiser-unless it was a Budvar Budweiser... Session beer, why not-just throw me a bone, though."
"Drinkability: very drinkable enjoyed a lot very smooth combination of malts and hops with nice aftertaste."
"m+d- quenching beer. nice mouthfeel. tastes much better cold."
"I can see why this beer is catching on here. It is a solid step up from a Bud or Coors in terms of flavor and it has the same sort of ""European sophistication"" as a Heineken. Not a great beer by any means but a possibly a gateway to craft for the BMC drinker."
"Clear yellow #5 brew with ample carbonation. The frothy off-white head lingers quite well. Nose starts out with an offensive level of pungent mercaptoethanol-like skunk, sheesh. After it has aired a bit, this fades off enough to reveal some raw grains, silage, a touch of citrus hop. Skunk is mostly gone now, whew. Mouthfeel is moderately thin, moderately fizzy... not particularly attractive, but a hell of a lot better than American macros. A decent level of viscosity for a lighter beer."
"Read all the bad reviews below - they are mostly true."
"I used to like this beer, around the same time I had only had 20 beers, all of which were macros. I can not go back to it."
"D-Not good.I would imagine that as a last resort this beer could be choked down at a modest rate."
"This was truly an awful beer from start to finish, and is not going to get a proper review. It smelled like a typical green bottled lager, and tasted even worse. It tasted like a watered down lager that some idiot had dumped some pepper into. Yes, pepper. That was the only taste I got. The saddest thing is that I drank this beer after having a Coors Light (yea, wasn't a great beer night) and if I had the chance I would have had the Coors Light again. I will never have another Stella. Absolute failure of a beer. I actually had some decent expectations for this, but was completely disappointed. Avoid this beer at all costs. You will be better of choosing a BMC."
"drank last night. notes taken. beer came on tap and pourd into pilsner glass. straw colored with bright white head that faded fast. smell was awful, taste was too. when i lifted the glass to take my first drink i thought someone around me had passed gas because that's the smell that consumed my nose! everytime i took a drink it returned. it was so nasty. i smelled my wife's drink to see if it was the glassware or just my beer. turns out is was the beer. taste was like it came in the green bottles. skunk and fizz. mouthfeel was like any BMC and drinkability was nonexsistant. only finished my beer because it cost so damn much. i will give this beer one more shot in the future, but not any time soon."
"That said, I would definitely drink it over other BMC alternatives. Oh, and I like the foil top -- I think that really gets people into thinking it's a ""premium"" beer."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. A subtle style, and the balance and restrained bitterness make it almost too sweet, but a good beer regardless. I would have another."
"Pours a clear bright golden straw color with cap of fizzy white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is of damp and musty grass, only a faint hint of dried grain, earthy. Taste brings the qualties of musty grass from the scent, a slightly bitter bite comes accross, but no positive hop notes. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly under carbonated, semi-dry. Nothing special about this, just carries the musty tastes of many other cheep euro lagers."
" Taste is balanced, a nice pop of carbonation - a dry bitterness in the back of the mouth with a very slight ellusive sweetness in front. Not bad but very unremarkable.It tastes and feels just ok, and is reminding me of Rolling Rock or Michelob - nothing special."
"Cheers!"
"Stella is perceived as a great beer. I found the taste to have a strong bite and strong carbonation. Nothing distinguishable about the taste, just another bottled import. The style points associated with this beer probably continue to support its classy image. Overall, a decent beer."
"I am so happy to see this utter garbage on the bottom of the barrel list. I have hated this beer for years and hope to bury it even further. This beer looks like any other macro crap, the smell is mostly skunk. The biggest problem with this beer is its skunky and harshly biting taste. It tastes terrible and is impossbile to drink."
"Notes: Had this in a blind taste (with 9 other macros and such), and this has proven to be one of the better ones"
"D: This is one of the most disappointing beers I've ever tried. Stella Artois has very good marketing, but very mediocre beer. While it is tolerable, I don't enjoy drinking it. Avoid this beer."
"D - Decent Lager. One of my favourites in my younger days. Still enjoyed on occasion. It's better on tap."
"I was a little disappointed as I expected more as Stella Artoris is brewed in Belgium."
"RJT"
"D- Nothing really turning me on to this one. Reminded me a lot of all the BMC. Kind of boring. Easy to drink just not me thing."
"A body but still light enough with the character of Saaz hops in the mouth which features flavors of floral hops slightly spicy. The herbal scent is also spreading in the nostrils and a pretty good way for a lager. The aftertaste remains a slight bitterness from the hops and malt aroma with a discreet but persistent, albeit slight, but interesting is complemented with a touch a little acid."
"Pours a pale yellow color with an average head that dissipates into a thin film. smell is not very strong, but i can get a little bit of hops and sweetness. Has a light grainey taste, nothing very potent. Feels crisp and refreshing. Overall, its okay, but nothing to write home about. I would surely take one if it was offered to me."
"D: Watery with a dull flavor. Very boring. Good lacing though."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a perfectly clear golden color with one finger of pure white head that soon faded to a thin skim. The retention was not great and the lacing weak. The aroma was musty, dry and grainy - not appealing to me, per se. The flavors were better than the aroma with the taste of dry, biscuity malt, Vienna malt, some hints of toasted malt and a little citrus rind bitterness (Saaz hops?). A nice lager with notes similar to a pilsner. The mouthfeel was good, the body light/medium and the carbonation a touch high."
"This is a very drinkable beer with a solid mouthfeel. It's very good with a nice dish featuring fish or chicken. I appreciate the history of this beer and the craftsmanship. (Even though some consider it a macro beer.) It's also a good studying/relaxing beer."
"D - has a nice taste, not too heavy - not too light. A decent everyday beer"
"good beer"
"D- Very easy to drink and great with a meal. Goes very well with fish or pork."
"overall, i liked it, and if it was on tap at the pub, and i wanted a European lager, i would definitely go for it."
"Poured an almost clear golden color with a big head that diminishes very slowly. Smells like a very improved/enriched version of BMC...definitely a lager smell...but better than most lager smells. Kinda has an herbal/grainy smell to it. Not very bad actually. Just kinda bland. The initial taste is much better than BMC, but at the same time...It's much worse than most Belgian beers. For a lager, this is not bad. Nice floral and crisp hoppiness to it. Very sweet and crisp. This could be one of the sweetest (common) lagers I've ever had. The taste is very refreshing and drinkable. The mouthfeel isn't very impressive, but drinking this beer is nothing to be ashamed of."
"D: Its okay. Wouldnt buy it. its expensive but then again I usually buy by 24 or 30 packs. A 6 pack would be ideal for this in my case."
"D: A lot better than most macro lagers, but majorly overpriced for the package. Still, for pizza or nachos, this brew would get the job done, as hops have a decent presence and the cereal malts are there."
"Tapped into its own glass. One finger bright white head which soon diminishes and breaks into lily pads. Lots of fine lacing. Nice clear light reddish amber. Malty smells. Malty taste up front with a mild hoppy finish. Not much else. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Nicely drinkable. A well done lager, just nothing really special."
"Overall, not the best of this style from Europe but it certainly beats Heineken. Very easy drinking and hoppier than you might expect when enjoyed at warmer-than-fridge temps. Will try this one again."
"I noticed many people ranked this beer poorly based on the fact that they had it from a bottle. I suggest they try this beer served on tap. It makes a great deal of difference."
"D: Meh. I've had much worse and much better."
"Poured a golden yellow with a one fingered white head that disappeared quickly with light lacing throughout the glass. Aromas of light spicy hops and grassy grains. And the taste was much like the smell with a light citrus finish. Light on the pallette with fair carbonation. Desent enough brew that went well with a crawfish Po'boy."
"Straw colored with pretty abundant head, carbonation, and generally looks very nice in its own Stella glass. Smell is faint and unexciting, generally clean, a bit grainy like you would expect, nothing offensive. Taste is crisp, bitter, and grainy. Mouth is dry. Not so much hops though and not citrusy. It has a slightly sweet and very quickly vanishing finish that can be pleasant. It's actually quite a good thirst quencher and probably above average for this style. Like a lot of this type of beers when it warms it becomes disagreeably bitter."
"If Simpler Times Pils at Trader Joe's weren't ~$6 less a six, I would actually drink this. Skunking is an issue in the bottle I would bet, but tap is quite acceptable."
"I can't believe that this beer sells. I might even say that I would rather have a Budweiser."
"d: one and done with this beer , i will probablly use the rest of the six pack to marinate meat."
"D: I could have had another, but one sufficed."
"Notes: It seems like another lofty euro-lager that isn't all that special. A lot of fancy restaurants have this beer on tap and I have no clue why. I'm not very impressed with this brew."
"D: it's smooth and inoffensive, clean taste makes it go down good, it'd score better if it had a more distinctive flavor."
"The mouthfeel is very light, and the whole thing feels a little too light to me. It is refreshing and slightly sweet, with some basic bitterness on the back. Crisp enough, and refreshing at that. The drinkability is not bad, and it fit at the BBQ at which I consumed multiple bottles."
"I'd gladly have another pint of this in the Olde Country, but it's never on my list back home."
"Refreshing and very euro in character, could drink a fair amount of this but for the import price premium. Plenty of other crisp, refreshing, domestic lagers at a better price point to sate one's thirst"
"I would keep this in my fridge for those hot summer days."
"D= i wouldnt have more than one or two of these in a night they seem pretty filling."
"Pours a dark straw yellow with a white head that fades quickly. The smell is grainy, maltly, and a hit of skunk. The taste is somewhat grainy with some sweet notes, but luckily the skunk doesn't come through. The mouthfeel is light, crisp, with good carbonation, a smooth beer. The mouthfeel is easily the best part of this beer. This isn't the best pale lager, but is an easy drinker, a usual lager with some odd notes, could be a past prime bottle. I could try this again on tap to see the difference, and see if my bad marks were due to freshness."
"Overall, a typical pale lager that typically fails to satisfy. This one has such huge hype right now and I just don't get it. Much better beers out there. This one was left over from my father-in-law when he visited so I finally gave it another shot. Available here in TX but no more for me. [N;N]"
"pours a transparent golden yelllow color with spare to no head and spare to no lacing. very dull flavor that tasted like sour water. i did not enjoy any part of this beer. used to think this was more of a high class brew when i was a miller light/pbr drinker. don't mean to ""bash"" the beer but this was just terrible."
"D: This is a good summer beer, as many other people have said. Not much to think about. Better than a Bud, but not by much. The taste in this one is very very very light. I suppose this ups the drinkability in some people's eyes, but for the price I would rather go elsewhere."
"I'll always love me some Stella."
"I wonder who in Belgium would actually drink this crap, unless they give it away to the folks in the Belgian equivalent of the Salvation Army. :)"
"Drinkability- ok definitely more of a summer beer, extremely light especially for me, would drink a cold one in the summer"
"Drinkability: It's very drinkable, but not ""reassuringly expensive."" More like Stella Artois found a way to sucker yuppies into drinking something unspectacular."
"D- Very easy to drink and great with a meal. Goes very well with fish or pork."
"Taste is sharp and biscuity. It's fairly tasty but a bit over carbonate and sharp. It's a good beer but surprisingly better in a bottle."
"Drinkability? 1 pint was all that I could handle. Weird how Old Chicago carries this in WY when there are so many better regional brews around to be had. I actually liked this a smidgeon more from the bottle.."
"Overall it is what it is. Drinkable only if it's a last resort."
"D - Very quaff-able on a hot day at the pool. Pleasant, but nothing I would go out of my way for."
"overall: I prefer ales but there are several Pills and Lagers I would rather have."
"After seeing this beer featured in many photos of happy yuppies in cafes and bistros, I thought, ""Hey, if they like it, it must be at least drinkable."" Wrong. There was nothing here to like. Stella Artois is weak, watery and skunky. Not at all what I like in a beer. 12-ounce bottle, served at Red Lobster."
"Poured a straw gold into a pint glass, with a half inch white head. Very grassy and fresh taste, nice hoppyness, with a light citrus note. This beer is actually nice on tap, unlike the somewhat skunky bottles. There was also some really great lacing and a pleasant floral nose. Good session lager."
"side note: I just wanted to add that I had a mirror pond pale ale after drinking a stella and it was night and day. For the same price (or in this case cheaper) I'd highly recommend the Mirror Pond. Wow, so much more flavor and well balanced."
"On par with the cheapest American lagers, only more expensive. Don't buy this beer."
"D: Does its job well enough, if you can avoid the skunk."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: Another beer that probably doesn't live up to its (good) reputation, but I like it anway. Not luxurious, but it doesn't have to be."
"D - Delicious if you're looking for something light. I find this beer very drinkable, not heavy, not overly strong on the flavours, and complements a lot of different foods."
"Stella Artois isn't a bad beer, but it is pretty average. The smell is definitely skunky, and the taste is slightly similar. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste, but nothing terrible. There isn't a great deal of flavor with this beer. As I said before it is very average."
"Note, though, that it is a full 5% ABV. When I say it's a good session beer, still you will find yourself inebriated if you don't pace yourself accordingly. On the other hand, if you have a DD or you're at home...drink on!"
"D - Good drinkability. Makes a very expensive session beer."
"Overall, Stella Artois is your typical European macro lager. It's clean, crisp & light and goes down nice & easy. Average taste, smell and appearance, but it definitely rates higher than the American macro lagers."
"Pours a goldish yellow with a more than respectable head. Good retention and outstanding lacing. Looks better than most pale lagers. Smell is another story however. Stale, skunky, musty corn husk smell. Not an appetizing smell, yet very comforting as it brings back memories of younger years when I viewed Stella as top shelf. Taste is still enjoyable but not nearly as complex as I thought it was when my palate was much less mature. Has a sweet honey malt forward taste with grassy hop flavoring. Finishes with a small sharp bitterness. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkable and enjoyable. When faced with a weak beer list full of macro lagers, Stella is still a fine choice."
"This will disappoint anyone expecting the taste complexities normally associated with Belgian beers. Basically this is the mass produced Belgian beer which is embraced worldwide as a good beer, just not on the same level as a Chimay or Duvel regarding flavor. I always liked Stella's and will always use this as a fall back option when a bar has nothing but macro's to choose from."
"Overall, this is a great summer BBQ beer, not complex or challenging, but not meant to be. An easy drinker and perfect for warm weather. Not sure if this is still the case, but we were in London about 5 years ago and it was literally everywhere. On tap in every pub and bottles and cans littered the streets on Saturday morning."
"D- Eh, not bad. Pair with food. I'd like this with a creamy alfredo, something rich to contrast with it's light flavors and body."
"the mouthfeel is smooth if a bit thin. drinkable for the lower ABV and fair taste. Not bad, but nothing special."
"This is quite drinkable. You could drink these incessantly. It might be a bit boring to do so, but who am I to complain? It' s beer, and it doesn't suck. I've had beer that sucks. This isn't it."
"D - Easy to drink but very plain and skunky."
"Has a very straw colored pal yellow color to it, it doesn't look like much really. Smell is kinda weak has a light malty aroma with some slight hop note. Taste it your generic macro lager, overall boring, but atleast it is refresshing, it's no better than budweiser or coors but whatever, it isn't terrible"
"Not worth the high price in my opinion though."
"D - The crispness and dryness are two positive notes for drinkability. The metallic finish, funky aroma, and unpleasant fizziness make it less so. I don't need to drink this again. I barely finished the one I had."
"M/D: Pretty thin, light body. Very average mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation for this type of euro beer. Decent drinkability. Refreshing."
"D: Could you call a beer a regular - this would be it. Nothing to be upset about but nothing to be very glad about either."
"D - It is certainly unspectacular, and it tastes horrendous if it isn't cold, but it is a decent option overall."
"The bottle serving is also good, but do pay attention to bottling dates."
"golden color with a 1"" thick head sweet aroma with a faint amount of hops. feels good on the mouth and is surprisingly frothy with medium carbonation. If i am going to drink a non micro brew, and i am very thirsty, this is the beer of chose for me.ry beer. Even so this beer is quite dull."
"Notes: It is like other Euro Pale Lagers, made for mass consumption so easy to drink and pretty inoffensive flavor. Compared to other beers like this one, it probably has a slight edge."
"Very light pale color, quite fizzy but can be very refreshing on a hot day. I'm just not sure they should charge a premium over domestic swill. It's just not that much different."
"This beer was not great, would not recommend it to a friend. Taste is strange, stingy, does not go down easy. The taste is almost awkward. I would not buy this beer again, put your money on a different Lager. Good looking bottle. 2 finger head."
"I had this beer when I was visiting Toronto. It was recommended to me by a friend, who was also the waitress at the bar I was eating at. It was on tap and I liked it initially. It had a good flavor and carbonation although it had a watery aftertaste...but when my food came, it lost all of its appeal. With any taste on my pallet it became bitter and almost intolerable, but with beer being very expensive in Canada I drank it down regardless. I don't recommend this beer with a big plate of poutine."
"Pours to a thin white head tht has little retention (could be a dirty glass?) and pale golden color. Aroma is noble hops and grainy malt. Flavor is a more refined version of the typical continental lager: grains, light noble hops, not much else. OK mouthfeel. Overall, It is easy to drink and inoffensive. Being on tap ensures quality. I could drink this all day if the alternatives were Bud, Miller and Coors. Otherwise it is a waste of time and money."
"Stella Artois is a very clear, pale golden lager with a foamy white head that has decent retention and lacing. It has a skunky aroma with notes of grass and lemon. Yeah, it has the green bottle whiff. It's light bodied, pretty watery, prickly and not very smooth. It leaves the palate a little gritty. It has a skunky, green bottle flavor. The best part of the flavor is my burps, which taste a little like noble hops-- maybe Saaz? Now I remember why I don't buy this."
"Remember one cardinal rule of beer bottles. If it's brown, I'm down, if its green, flush it down the latrine, if its transparent, skunking is apparent. I wanted to flush this beer down the latrine so bad. Very watery, generic hoppiness and generic maltiness, only average looks. I'm just not impressed by this beer."
"This is truly a premium lager. It has a light gold color and pours into a rather nice head that sticks to the glass. The smell is really nice with a rather sweet smell followed by hops. The mouthfeel is good nice though a little lighter that I suspected. The drinkablility is great it goes down super smooth and it is rather refreshing!! I really like this lager!!"
"Flavor was decent, mild...and thin. A little more flavor than the aroma presented. Slightly sweet, wheat, carbonated, and very faint maltiness. Drinkability is up due to it's non-complexity and light mouthfeel. So, not great by any means, but glad I gave this another go...it's not bad. A good fall-back beer if nothing else is on-tap somewhere."
"This is a pretty ordinary beer. I guess their marketing division is doing a real good job at making us think we're drinking something special or fancy. It's actually very boring."
"11.2 OZ. green bottle, looks fancy. Poured a super clear pale straw color with little head but large bubbles. Smells pretty clean, a bit skunky at first, and some faint hops, perfumey as it warms a bit. Taste up front is of intense popcorn, almost no hop/bitter presence, maybe light sweet corn. Feels very thin/watery, balanced clean and smooth. Nothing spectacular here but i could drink plenty of it. This is a good clean beer, that maybe presents itself as more top-shelf than it actually is though. Price might be alittle high for what it is, however as a refreshing pale lager i think it does just fine."
"It is a light straw color with a slight scent that is not offensive. It is an easy drinker so the mouthfeel and taste."
"Poured from a 500mL tall can into a pint glass. Pale golden color with a white head that leaves a lot of lacing. Aroma is grainy/grassy and a little bit bready. Nice clean taste with spicy hops. Thin body and a bit over-carbonated, with a dry finish. Overall this is an above-average macro lager."
"Overall, if I had to choose between various American and Euro macros, this would probably be my choice. It's average at best, but when compared to others in the same style it's not too shabby."
"Not great but it has enough flavor and body to justify its exsistance. I imagine this could be better on-tap."
"If you find a beer with a good taste and easy to drink, that's the beer."
" I do like this beer for what it is a Macro Euro Lager. It taste better than the American versions and pours with long lasting head. I certainly would pick this one over a American Macro lager any day!"
"This would be my go to beer if not for the price, but at over $8.00 a sixer Ill look for something with more flavor."
"The body was very weak and insubstantial. This beer is very drinkable, but so is water. It would be easy to have several of these, but why would you? Overall, not a beer that I'm likely to try again, but those who enjoy it can keep pouring them down."
"The lager is fairly derided on most of these reviews: my review may not be as high if tried from the green bottle. It is a refreshing lager, but there are a lot better choices available."
"D-Fine, but this is the first time I've had a beer that tasted okay, but smelled foul."
"It's clean, light, drinkable, mediocre. At restaurants and bars with a poor beer selection it can be a reasonable fallback, but I certainly wouldn't seek it out."
"I find this to be a great beer on a hot summer day. I could drink a few of these in a row no problem."
"Drinkability: Not bad tasting, but a little too simple to stay interesting for long. And not quite good enough to be satisfyingly simple."
"D: Even when it smells like skunk, I can drink this stuff. It doesn't taste bad and goes down as easily as any other beer with so little taste. However, playing roulette with the smell seems a bit odd. Hope for a nice citrus scent and you'll enjoy this beer. Otherwise, you may just clear a room."
"This beer is very good. Very tastes very good, but it's very light. This beer has a decent smell, with a hint of skunk. This beer is very drinkable, and a fine addition to any beer selection or collection. Stella Artois is a good beer to experiment with if your exploring Belgian Beers. This is a very good beer."
"cheers!"
"Definitely one of my favorite beers to drink in the summer. Not a lot of smell but the taste is good and has a nice cold feel to it. Not a great beer, I'm not typically a huge fan of the European pale brews but this is one of the few I will drink. Love drinking it will Italian meals."
"Overall, a very, very drinkable Pils, not the best taste, of course, but certainly not as bad as many people portray it."
"D: Easy to drink lager. One of the better choices if I were going to a bar that favored macros"
"Drinkability: pretty drinkable, though one-dimensional enough that I see little reason to go back to this well unless it were a hot day and I happened to have a sixer."
"Pours crystal clear straw with coarse carbonation that gives a rich foamy white head. Grassy notes on the nose and a nice clean and crisp taste with a very slight yeastiness or breadiness and a slight bitter finish. This is the perfect beer for Australians and yet we drink astonishingly vile macro swill. So this is not my absolute favourite beer of all time but I love you Stella. Love you long time."
"Mouthfeel: Soft, crisp carbonation. A great take on a Euro pale lager."
"D-It goes down very smoothly almost like drinking water."
"D) I really enjoyed it though because of the large production expected much less. As a result, I had several."
"Drinkability- An extermely drinkable lager. I could drink these all night without any problem!"
"For a Euro macro pale ale, this is about as smooth drinking as it gets. The consistency and drinkability are excellent, yet there is just not enough body, flavor, and substance to this beer to really rate it well."
"I can't really knock Stella too much, it's served me well as a solid pale lager. But then again, there's not much going on here. Just a run of the mill pale lager, but due to its ubiquitousness, it's one I will keep coming back to."
"D: At a bar with Stella on tap is a whole different story than this putrid yellow liquid in the bottle. I know that on tap is supposed to be much more fresh and everything, but it's surprising to see such a disparity of quality between bottle and tap."
"All in all, a drinkable beer. Not sure that I'd want more than one or two of them, though. Belgium has much, much, much better to offer."
"I had this for Thanksgiving and will next year. Goes well with Turkey."
"D: The legions of BAs are out against this beer and I'll say I won't turn it down when it's free. I am going to play Switzerland on this one, neutral, no hate and surely no love."
"the dirnkability is good. for a macro lager it's really not bad. it's simple and thirst quenching."
"This beer in my opinion embodies everything wrong with the lager style. It pours out urine yellow with a cloudy white head. Smells like rotting grass. Taste is like mild herbal tea with a bitter finish. There is a bit of bubble in the beer, and in all reality this is very unappealing beer."
"Bottle sample- Pours a head average for this style beer. Blanchy white. Body is almost a ""bright"" yellow. Kinda strange. Aromas of hops and corn. I thought it was flavourful at first, because it does have some bitterness to it, but that faded rather quickly, and the end result was a beer that tasted just above par. Nothing to write home about. I must admit though, they make it seem like the classiest beer in the world."
"Drinkability: I can't believe this beer is actually from Belgium. There are only slight differences from American adjunct lagers. Don't bother."
"D: One of the better casual beers of the macro-brewery type. Very drinkable. Though not complex, it is an adequate sessionable beer."
"D: if the choice is among pale Euro lagers (macro), Stella is definitely near the top of the list."
"A decent light tasting lager, I am stocking it for parties because macro drinkers will drink it and it is refreshing to have once in while."
"Drinkability-I wont be buying this again."
"Beer is crisp and has a medium to low body. It finishes nicely, its not terrible. Its a fine pleasing example of a bland pale lager. No bitterness. Its not horrible, just average."
"Poured a pale golden yellow. Lots of bubbles streaming from the bottom into an imrpessive thick rocky head. Yeasty, musty on the nose gives way a little fruity rasin smell. Yes there is a skunk that lives in there. Not as bad as some, but enough to make it unpleasant. Taste is clean up front with a dry grainy thin malty flavor. A little sweet, sour, fruity apple notes show up. Mild, understated hop bitterness, then the skunk comes out to play again. The other flavors put up a better fight than some, but in the end the skunk wins out. I didn't like it. I was able to finnish the bottle, but I had no interest in another one. Over-rated and expensive. Give me a Keystone Light and I would be just as impressed."
"Over the past decade this beer has become ubiquitous, taking the place of Heineken as the import of choice amongst those who favor big brewer lagers, but want that European cache. ""It's Belgian, so of course it's good."" Except that Stella Artois shares as much in common with most Belgian brews as Heineken... really nothing. All that aside, Stella is probably the best of the macro lagers to my palate with a decent crispness, slightly rounder flavor than most, and a dry ever-so-slightly bitter finish. Sparkly and ""refreshing"" the way big lagers are--very easy to drink for hour after hour, but nothing special."
"D: Very drinkable they could go down fast if you were in of a mind to. A little pricy for what it is."
"I've drank this innumerable times due to its ubiquity and the fact that it usually edges out what else is available alongside it by just a gnat's bollock, sitting there as it does alongside Heineken and Corona on the ""imports"" list so often, at least in the restaurants I have the misfortune to be dragged to on occasion. But why? Why is it always on menus? Really. I can't explain this beer's prevalence on restaurant menus other than the marketing, the name and the bottle lend an air of sophistication to it which makes people perceive it as high end, but the beer itself leaves much to be desired."
"Drinkability: Not bad. This is something I could drink again, but it's not going to make my shortlist of ""must have"" beers."
"This is my go to brew at chain restaurants that don't carry craft brews but do have a few imports. The best big beer lager on the market. It is very drinkable and about as consistent of a beer as i have tasted. It is if you have it on tap but the bottle is very good for what it is as well. Always welcome in my fridge as a taste bud recuperation beer."
"Drinkability: Being so smooth and light this is a very sessionable beer."
"Overall maybe I am slightly harsh on this beer as I was thinking Belgium beer when I reviewed it."
"A quenching beer with nothing out of place. Standard euro lager here, but worthy nonetheess."
"D - Fine for a bar. This is a beer that I could drink without making a face, but I'd never ever feel guilty about leaving some behind. In fact after I got to this point in the review I dumped the bottom finger's worth out of the glass."
"Noteworthy: I resolutely threw out the remainder of the beer after sampling enough to write this review."
"Tastes of cereal and grains, fairly mild. Has some malts up front with a touch of hops in towards the back of the flavor. The hops bring some spice. The carbonation and hoppy spiciness make me want some more even tho the taste is fairly subdued. I would consider it thoroughly drinkable."
"Pours a bright clear yellow with a thick and fluffy white head that retains quite well. Lots of spotty lacing on the glass, very attractive. Smell and taste are corn, light cereal grains, sweet pale malt, mildly grassy hops, and a spicy bitterness to finish. All of the flavours could be turned up a notch (or ten), but the subtlety is what gives Stella its mass appeal. Crisp and clean mouthfeel with a smooth body and plenty of bite from the carbonation and hops. Surprisingly good. Huge drinkability as I finished a 500ml can in no time. Having said that, there is no aspect of this beer that deserves a ""4" because it is simply too mild and indistinct. Stella is a solid drinker no doubt, but its not as flavourful, complex, and interesting as many well-made craft lagers."
"drinkability is good - one of the better macros"
"Pale golden color, medium amount of carbonation, no head or lacing, makes for quick drinking and enjoyable balance."
"Finished off the last one in my roommate's six pack with dinner tonight. Had a pretty standard lager appearance, not too bad, not too good. Smells pretty standard, definitely some corn/grain in there. I wasn't a huge fan of the taste, it tasted a lot like a budweiser to me. Decent mouthfeel, it was pretty light with a lot of carbonation, but it went down smooth. Overall, I wouldn't drink more of 2 of these in a night, just b/c I'm not huge on the taste."
"Overall, the best I've had of Euro Pale lagers."
"The taste is light grain, herbs and juniper with a definite light bitterness. It is slightly more bitter than Grolsch or Heineken. It is slightly tingly and has a lightly bitter the finish. A light soapy quality is noticeable but it's very light."
"D : Easy drinking, not bad at all for a macro, though below average for being a Belgian"
"had this at my next door neighbors house while watching football..it poured a medium yellow color with an ok head..the smell was bread and malt faint hops the taste was bready with faint sweet malts and a few hops,,,its very weak and watery but not a bad lager it is drinkable if that what you want... ive had this many times and its not bad its just not one i think about ever buying..but if its in the cooler ill grab one"
"When I tried Stella previously, it was from a bottle. I don't think I'd be inclined to ever get it from a bottle again, but it's a reasonable brew on tap. Definitely worth ordering at a pizza joint with a limited selection."
"Had this beer on tap in the European Union Area of Brussels. The beer looks like a typical pilsner, with a nice white head. The smell is nothing special. Had this one after the Jupiler, and this beer is so much better for the style. This is not sweet in the after taste, what a relief. Also this pilsner is a good beer for a hot summer day. But from/in Belgium, one should basically only buy/drink the special treats, not the lager beers...."
"No foul aftertastes, a very crisp and light feeling beer, and a flavor that leaves you wanting more makes this beer very drinkable. I am quite impressed so far."
"This was a drinkable beer. Though it was not very interesting, just a basic euro lager."
"Definitely sells more because of its status instead of its taste - the new Heineken. While a decent beer, it amazes me that people think drinking this beer proves they have discerning taste. Typical lager for snobs."
"There's not much going on with this beer. How can you comment on something that's almost average across the board? To be nice, I'll say this beer is insipid, thin, and not much to look at. The night is still young and I've got plenty of real beer I can try."
"This is a pretty good Euro lager. Plus, it looks great in its branded glassware. This is a good looking beer. Golden, clear, with a nice head up front that dissipates quickly. The aroma is faint and mellow, with typical belgian elements. The flavor is straightforward european lager, with some vegetal notes and maybe a hint of weak citrus. Very easy to drink. Feels good going down, and I could drink these all day long. The question is, would I? While this is a very drinkable beer, it is also not particularly unique or interesting."
"This Beer has the taste equivalent of the smell of dirty feet, the aftertaste just seem to stay with me longer than necessary. I struggled to finish the Bottle, I dont even think I finished the Bottle. I do admit that it was better than a Heineken, but I wont go out of my way to get it again."
"Overall, not terribly offensive, but still one of the worst true Belgian beers I've ever had."
"Overall, not the worst macro I've ever had. I don't really recommend too many macros, but this one is slightly a cut above I suppose. Not very exciting though to say the least."
"I had this taste from a can, but I've had plenty of these on tap as well and don't remember it being at all impressive. I recommend passing on the Stella if anything else is available."
"D: This is clearly an over-hyped, virally marketed beer that gives Belgian beers a bad name. Behind all the fancy labels and long-winded explanations about its noble heritage lies a very run-of-the-mill macro lager. The false advertisement and inadequacy in the taste department can turn inexperienced beer drinkers away from Belgian beers before they even grasp a good understanding of the diversity and range of what good Belgians are."
"Edit: I'm to understand after reviewing this beer, it has the nickname of ""Wifebeater"" in the UK. Now I don't condone domestic violence, but I can only assume the reason this beer has that nickname is because if I had a wife and she brought me a bottle of this stuff, I'd be pretty damn angry if I had to drink it again."
"They may have sold out to the masses and maybe altered the taste over the years, who knows, but this is a solid beer that is consistant and always refreshing. It is a golden lager that has a nice light foamy head. The taste and mouthfeel are simple, no off-putting taste, just a nice sweet lager that can be enjoyed anywhere. Stella is a very drinkable brand and they do a very good job on getting the correct glass to serve it in. I'm not a fan of how they do it, but we have to give them credit for getting people to drink better beer, even in the red states, where they would usually drink BUD."
"not what i think of when i hear belgian beer but better than our macros over here"
"D- This beer is refreshing on a hot day, and while it doesn't satisfy my palate, it is very drinkable nonetheless. I would take this over BMC any day, and could drink several in a sitting (if there were a lack of better options)."
"Strictly speaking about the beer....Stella's aroma, mouthfeel, and aftertaste are in the same boat as other Euro lagers - Heineken, Grolsch, Moretti, and Harp. Nothing impressive here, just standard better than Bud lagers."
"Belgium has unarguably the richest terroir when it comes to beers. It is home to some of the oldest and most unique styles and possibly the largest catalog of brands as well. It shares a most intimate history with ale and houses some of the most celebrated breweries and time-honored beers - Belgium's culture is inextricably knotted with the drink. But apparently not even all that exempts it from the plague of shitty, macro-produced lagers."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best before 04/11/09 (yikes) indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a two inch frothy, bright white head that left behind a thick band of lacing as it collapsed. Copious tiny bubbles present in solution. Nose was somewhat skunky - that's it. Taste was primarily cereal grains (very light) and wet cardboard with a little bit of corn syrup sweetness lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and lightly carbonated; probably the best feature of this brew. Not terrible, but not great either. The more I drank this, the less appealing it was."
"Pours blonde with an unremarkable head. Stella has a skunky smell, and I know that is sometime a characteristic not spoilage, but I don't have to like it. The taste is lagerish, in other words, plain, bland, common. Mouth feel is what you would expect in a lager. Good drinkability. I like this a better on tap, but that's not unusual when properly carbonated."
"Pours up a nice brilliant gold with a big frothy bone white head. The way it looks in the glass is probably it's best attribute. The smell is faintly flowery with some yeast and distant honey notes. The taste is a little lemony, maybe a little bit of pills malt, and some mild hops in the finish. Leaves the mouth quickly. Slightly better than your average Big 5 breweries mass lager offering, but only slightly."
"Pours a pale gold color with a slight head. The smell is very faint, there is a slight hop aroma but it is more of an adjunct corn smell. The taste is very crips with some hop bitterness, but the taste of hops is very faint as well. Mouthfeel is a moderate to high amount of carbonation but it is very crisp and clean. Drinkability is okay nothing to write home about, but nothing to make you run away either."
"D: If I was at a bar which had the basic domestic offerings and then Stella Artois, I would pick Stella. However, for any other situation at a bar, I would never buy it. I'd stick to microbrews and such. I wasn't thrilled by the beer; however, I wasn't exactly dissappointed either. I'm in limbo."
"D: A bit of character, if you can manage a fresh, un-skunked sampling. A bit overrated by many, and not usually worth the premium price, but I found this fairly cheap and it drinks reasonably well."
"D: Not a bad option when you're out on the town and no craft options are available. Solid reliable Euro Lager which prob gets a nice bump from a lot of great beer drinking memories together. Don't be scared of this brew, as much as any mainstream Lager, it's your friend."
"O - Its not bad, not amazing, but I'll drink it is its all that's available."
"So, if you want a solid beer while kicking it at the bar. Here you go."
"D: Very good drinkability. Goes down smooth and easy. The sweetness lets this beer go down easier than other lagers. After a couple meals with this beer one would probably seek a more bitter brew, however."
"D - Good drinkability for the brew."
"Overall it's pretty inoffensive, but far too simple and pretty poor for the most part."
"D: Very drinkable, goes down nice with a good carbonation kick."
"Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, as the ABV is low and there isn't a ton of flavor so it certainly goes by quickly. Easy to drink and unoffensive on the palate, but there are so many beers out there, why would you ever settle for Stella?"
"D - Very drinkable, Its easy to have quit a bit of these"
"D: It's amazing how a sixer of PBR can make a typical Euro lager seem like the nectar of the gods. But this one stands on its own quite nicely. It won't make anyone forget Rochefort or any other of the fine offerings from Belgium, but it's a solid lager."
"I sesioned this beer in Qatar while on Rest and relaxation from the boredom of Iraq... I loved it best beer the USO offered! However now that I have been home and had other brews I have to say I wont be sessioning this beer."
"I could drink a lot of these while sitting around the barbeque, waiting for the ribs to get done."
"D- To me this is just an average beer. I'm not real big on lagers so I wouldn't normally want too many of these in a sitting. However, it has to be one of the better lagers."
"Not a horrible Euro lager but not a good Belgian beer either."
"Decent carbonation and medium-lighter body make this much more passable as a drink. It went down easy with the food (what can I say, airport beer choices just flat out suck ass, and this was the best available). I wouldn't pursue this unless you had no other choice. A fairly boring beer."
"Approachable but boring."
"Overall, I would say this beer is drinkable, but not great. It is definitely not what comes to mind when one thinks of Belgian Beer."
"This is certainly a very good beer. I tend to be more into darker beers, but even for someone who is into a darker brew, it's still a nice and refreshing brew. It's a very light and extremely crisp taste. Probably good for serving someone if they are not much of a beer person."
"I'd have to try this one on tap to truly put my mind to ease. I guess I am totally turned off by the green bottles. It's like playing a reverse lottery where everyone wins a skunky beer! Stella is an average beer at best and I just don't see the popularity with it at bars across the country. I guess having AB importing and distributing helps. I'll pass from now on."
"D - Not my fave, but passable and pretty drinkable when selection is limited"
"This is one to go with if it's on tap with little craft or macro selection."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich golden color with a smallish head. Not much in the way of aroma. Has good delicious, slightly malty flavor with a mild aftertaste. Feels light in the mouth and is highly drinkable. This is very enjoyable brew."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a sharp carbonation"
"Pours clear pale yellow; a little watery and weak looking. Nice carbonation and bone white head that quickly lays down. A little of that sour Euro-lager aroma that sometimes hits me a little skunky, but not in this bottle. Taste is watery, but also crisp and refreshing. Sweet malts balanced nicely by sour hops. A little flint and grass, but not unpleasant. Clean, bitter finish. No off flavors. This is my favorite of the mega-produced Euro lagers."
"Give me a mainstream adjunct lager instead. I don't see the hype or the quality."
"Overall, I found this to be a ho-hum beer. Almost all other Belgian beers I have tried have been superior (although admittedly, this one isn't too pricey), and I would even go so far as to say that a lot of ""Belgian-style"" beers trump it. Not terrible to drink, but certainly falls into the class of beers I would consider about tier 2 out of five (with only things like Laker being lower)."
"drinkability:this has never been a favorite beer of mine but it`s an easy beer to drink ."
"drinkability - not a bad beer, i enjoy drinking it. Do not recommend it as a quality beer, but would enjoy drinking it on a nice day :)"
"M/D: slightly bitter with a light feel easily drinkable."
"The verdict is this: Stella is a sessionable Euro Lager. End of story."
"Another one of the first Euro imports that got me on the path to better beer, so perhaps it gets a slight bump in my overall score category for nostalgic reasons. True, it might not be the best Euro lager, but it hits the spot on hot days when drinking with fraternity brothers. A good friend just got back from Belgium on spring break after spending a semester abroad studying in Leuven (where the brewery is located) and he says this beer is markedly better overseas because it is so much fresher."
"d- very drinkable, love this beer, great for sessioning. good work belgium."
"Drinkability - definitely a good beer. The BA C+ average is definitely unwaranted. Good beer, but a bit expensive."
"M-D- Very dry on the taste buds and rolls over the the tongue very smoothly with no real problem. This beer is drinkable in every way but the price. Good beer but i've had better."
"The smell was pretty much the same: pungent and light hops, but the taste however, was so much different! It was really bready and yeasty, with some subtle citrus notes towards the end. It was incredibly drinkable that night, more than the previous sessions. I thought it was pretty tasty for such a skunky beer. It must've been a gem supply, because I had not enjoyed Stella in my previous tastings. Overall, I'd say Stella is an average drinkable beer, as I'd consider looking for other options."
"Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation is crisp and if not for the off flavors, would be a good quencher."
"Poured an extra light straw color, impeccable clear with the faintest white head. Smells like cat urine, watered down hops and a college bar the day after St. Patrick's Day. Taste is surprisingly spot on with the smell. Feels like drinking seltzer water, absolutely no body. Drinkability is low seeing as I want to gag every time it hits my tongue."
"D: Meh, I guess I could throw a few back, but for the price of the stuff, I don't think its really worth it. Just another expensive, mass marketed import. I'm not impressed at all. It's sad to think that people think of this beer to signify Belgium. Time to get out there and educate people!"
"D- Pretty average when it comes to drinkability. It's no better or no worse than your Buds.. Millers.. and Coors"
"9/10/09 Pretty bad, cheap-tasting lager. In my opinion, Stella Artois is about on par with most American macro lagers. There's very little to recommend it. The color is a pale, drab yellow. The small white head dissipates very quickly. There's little aroma, except for a muted cheap malt note, overly sweet and more reminiscent of corn than barley, although I don't believe that adjuncts are used. The flavor is similarly dominated by a cheap, overly sweet malt flavor. There are some hops in there, I guess. The beer is not entirely without crispness when cold. Still, the feel is rather thin, even for a lager probably based on a pilsner style. Overall, I'm not a fan of Stella. The flavor is unclean, which is a pretty big problem for me in a light lager."
"I could drink a few of these, a definite improvement over most of the AB-Inbev library."
"Overall, this is just a fair beer. It's drinkable & pairs well with any seafood or poultry; however, it does have that Euro Lager skunkiness that Heineken & alot of other brews have."
"Drinkable in the way that most mass-market beers are, and better than someout this one, and I don't think I'd want more than a couple, as there are plenty of better beers out there."
"Stella is one of those lagers which you feel bad not finding something good to say about it because it certainly is a step up from bud/coors/etc. but it certainly doesn't offer anything too special..Smell and taste are sort of just your avg. ""beer"" taste, like an adjuct lager but it has at least some flavor and a hint of citrusy even (lime, specifically) that I find in its mild hop presence.. Its main strong points are the light mouthfeel and easy drinkability, what I assume most people who go for one are looking for anyway.."
"This beer has a much nicer color than a lot of the other macro euro-trash beers. In fact, its clearly the color of very very light maple syrup. Smells pretty skunky, unfortunately thats the problem with a green bottle. I really dont hate this beer, in fact i like it, except for the dry paper taste at the end. Its def at the better end of the Belgium macro brews, and if i had to choose one... well i wouldnt, but this one is better than the rest. I could pound a few back on a summer day..."
"Had to drink this at a party so I thought I would review. Beer pourse a very light yellow color, hardly any head and no lacing. Smell is good with the aroma of sweet malt with light hops. Taste is of sweet malt up front followed by subdued hop flavor. Beer finishes too bitter/harsh for me and reminds me more of an ale than a lager. It's not a bad beer, just not up to par with many of the other fine german lagers out there."
"D- Low alcohol but not good enough for multiple appearences. I did not even finish my glass. I don't see why this is so popular, Oh yeah in-bev, I forgot."
""
"It's easy enough to drink but this is strictly a hot weather beer in my opinion. Not bad, just not that good either."
"Drinkability: I have very few complaints about this beer. It looks and smells like nothing, but it tastes good and it goes down easy. And I say this after I fully expected to hate this beer. Good stuff!"
"A pale golden color with a big fluffy white head, lots of carbonation.Aroma of grain and skunky hops with a dash of citrus fruit aroma. Flavor is a touch of pale malt up front then a neutral carbonation and then some citrus/skunky hops. Light body with a crisp refreshing mouthfeel and finish,quite drinkable,and a fun try but not the best I've ever had."
"Taste is not too shabby, with grainy pale malts shouldering most of the load. Moderately hopped with saaz to give it a decent floral and spicy hop presence. It's well carbonated with a dry finish. If this is the Budweiser of Belgium, I'd trade macros with them anyday. One of the better Euro pale lagers I have had. For me, however, the price is way to high for this beer to warrant any regular purchasing."
"D- Stella is a pretty good brew that is drinkable but not the best one out there."
"Here in the US, this beer is no longer a novelty - you can find it everywhere - and maybe thats not a bad thing. Beats the hell out of BMC anyday."
"D - Beer pong beer."
"crisp and clean. kind of boring though."
"Drinkability - a few cans like this in an evening is never a bad thing, just don't over-do it. The taste and refreshment doesn't go out on this great beer."
"I had this on tap at a local restaraunt. It is a pale clear straw yellow with a medium white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is sweet and bready. The flavor is light, sweet and has a pleasant bitter after taste. The beer is light bodied and fairly quaffable. I think this one is much better on draft than bottled."
"Drinkability- Honestly I like this beer, its first time I tried it and I think its a nice session lager better then most macro beers, Its gotta alot more complexity to me while steal being very light crisp and refreshing then most american macros, not something i would get all the time but if given the option theres a lot I would certainly choose it over, one I believe I will visit occasionally when drinking with people who like the macros, highly drinkable no issues slamming one these down"
"d - i would not get this again."
"D 3.5 - I gotta support it since it's Belgian, it's drinkable for sure, just not a huge standout for me."
"Overall- This is a good alternative to the American pale lagers. Seems a bit more flavorful and full."
"The best thing is that it is quite drinkable, but might not ever be my first choice at a bar. I would definitely pick it over any budweiser or miller though."
"At least it's better than Bud."
"overall ive always liked this beer, nothing special about it just always seems to hit the spot."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a flute glass. Pours a clear, crisp golden yellow with lots of bubbles. A one finger thick white head that settles quickly. The first thing I smell is a bit of funk that I can't identify. Not real pleasant. Beyond that, it smells mildly malty and fruity. A bit of a sweet taste up front, followed by a bit of bitterness. Not a real complicated taste, but well balanced. Crisp, light mouthfeel. Very carbonated and burpy. Goes down easy though. It's drinkable when your options are limited. Not bad, not great, but drinkable."
"Stella poured clear and gold with a one finger head that stuck nicely to the side of the glass. It's aroma was crisp and malty which was reflected in it's taste. I love carbonation and this one had plenty which complemented its smoothness. This is a very easy beer to drink."
"Really nice atmosphere on this one. Nice full flavor and feel, however a light palette. Really solid quaff."
"Overall: I was not into Stella at first, but it grew on me by the bottom of the glass. It holds its own, but I won't seek it out."
"Poured a nice clear golden amber with a white frothy head that dissolved to a cover, well carbonated. Little aroma but not unpleasant. Clean dry taste, mildly bitter. Easy to drink. Not usually my first choice, but drink it when its the alternative to BMC."
"Drinkability is limited by taste."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. Not terribly notable, but does have a decent taste and is pretty inoffensive. Can see why it is so popular among those looking for an easy drinking lager."
"Overall- average pale lager, clean and drinkable."
"Drinkability - its drinkable I'd rather drink this than most US macros but this is usually just a ritual beer at certain concert venues"
"D - very drinkable and refreshing"
"This will probably be the last one of these I ever buy. There are a lot more interesting choices out there then this swill."
"This beer is probably well liked by folks enjoying lighter, easier drinking beers. I think is would be great on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is fairly high on this one; it's nice, refreshing and clean. Not something I'm clamouring to get more of, but decent."
"Overall: I can't see myself ever getting this again"
"D - Not bad. I named my dog after this beer, so people always ask me if it's one of my favorites but it's actually just halfway decent and nothing special. I just liked the name since it is beer-related and I'm a big beer geek. It was my wife's idea actually."
"I was surprised that this beer was not as bad as expected. Being a macro beer it is expected to be alittle less then they hype. Not too bad. I would consider putting this on my list of session beers."
"Taste is likewise a bit reduced, and downright watery in the end, thus negatively impacting the feel and drinkability of this brew. If you wish to consume this beer, and I can't really recommend it, then you should purchase the bottle."
"Not a drinkable beer in my opinion. So many great beers out there I wouldn't waste my time with this. Quite honestly if this was the best beer offered at a bar I'd rather drink water or a coke."
"I could not manage to drink the whole beer and gave up after half."
"To think that I used to drink this while at, um, places that involved consuming a formidable amount of mixed drinks (Power Hour!) before nursing beers the remainder of the evening, and this was the best option, really. Now, while not blatantly off-putting, it's not particularly enjoyable when put to this particular litmus test. I'll still finish this, in deference to those heady days where beer-tubs were a going concern for me."
"M/D - Very light bodied and crisp. A touch thin on the feel but a very quaffable lager. Nothing spectacular but a decent beer none the less"
"Overall I was disappointed. This was recommended to me by several people and I ended up being very disappointed. This just seems like an upgraded of Bud or Bud Light."
"Not at all enjoyable. Stella was ubiquitous when I was in Belgium several years ago and I didn't like it then even when very fresh. I like it less now."
"D- a good light easy beer for thirsty drinking."
"D - good beer, never had in the bottle in the states, but enjoyed it over there"
"5/3/4/2/8 (2.2/5)"
"Drinkability is high for me stilll because i found it a fun beer and the skunkiness isn't overpowering. Not bad."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with a bright white 1/2 inch head. Decent retention and only slight lacing. Smells of a lager with some sweet malt but mostly skunk. All of the Stella's I've ever had have this distinctive skunk aroma and taste. I hope this is just the shipping process and not the actual flavor. I wish to travel abroad and sample fresh examples of these European brews. Has a crisp feel with low carbonation and a little to watery. Definitely not strong enough for me to enjoy and the skunk aroma is also present in the taste. Overall, I only tried this again to make sure I get the rating correct. I have never enjoyed any skunky brews."
"D: Another of my favorite, dependable BBQ / summer beers. I don't buy it otherwise."
"D: Good to say you like a Belgian beer but that is about it. Really boring. Also it is not cheap. I would rather grab some American craft beer."
"Not bad by any stretch, just not that interesting. It's not a memorable beer, but it's a pleasant one. Too bad about the price."
"I enjoy this lager. Very crisp and refreshing on a warm summer day, and will warm you up a bit in the pit of winter. Not very bitter and sweeter than most, which is a good thing in my book. For being a mass produced import euro lager it's top of the line."
"This beer gets a lot of underserved attention. Pours clear yellow with an out-of-control white head. Aroma is reminiscent of Heineken. Skunky-sweet with the taste of bread, almost as if someone dropped sugar into a Budweiser. The finish is sickening-sweet. Not a fan."
"NOTES: BBCSD-E1"
"This beer is just kinda ok for me. Its good, but taste more like a american adjuct than a euro pale. Just not worth the $8-9 a 6-pack price. I would pay $6-7 a 6-pack, but not much more. Not something I'll buy again unless maybe on sale."
"I'm under-impressed by this beer. A decent casual drinker, I guess, but I could find plenty of better beers for the same price and popularity. I wouldn't order this at a restaurant or bar and wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but I'd drink it happily if someone gave it to me."
"I bought this beer at the liquor store as a single on advice of a friend. This is my first beer, probably go back and re rate it. I used the Stella Artois glass. A Light and crisp beer Pale in color with bit of citrus and light hops Not a great beer but just okay."
"Leftovers from a party, so I drank a bottle last night. Poured it into a Stella glass (have a set of four - it's a nice glass!). Crisp yellow color, fairly large white head. Lots of carbonation. First thing I always notice with a Stella is that funky smell. It's borderline skunky, masked by the sweet smell of corn. Not a fan of the smell of this beer. Taste is average. Not the worst Euro lager I've had. There's an odd slickness to this beer's body, almost buttery. This sorta slicks over the marginal taste of this beer. Not a brew that I want to have more than one of, if given no other choice."
"D-Good enough drinkability. By no means an all star, but an enjoyable lager, to be sure."
"Update! Was purchased in a single bottle, try the closed case 12 packs to block the light from spoiling the beer. Iv noticed that it makes a big difference! I will try again sometime and update my review if I notice any difference."
"Stella Artois pours a clear yellow with tons of carbonation rushing to the top and a clean white head that lasts a couple of minutes. All in all it looks quite beautiful. Unfortunately the smell is between ick and ordinary. There's just not much there: a faint, nameless hoppiness with the suggestion of an equally unidentifiable malt. Tastes slightly better than it smells, with distant honey sweetness and lemony hops. Reminiscent of camomille - and just as benign! The body is light and the carbonation gives it a nice feel. This beer is pretty drinkable but would be more so if only it had more character."
"I had this in the traditional Stella Artois snifter, which probably didn't make much of a difference, even if I had drunk it straight from the bottle as I often have. The color is a sort of hazy gold with a light head. This beer doesn't have much taste to it at all, so it's hard to fault Stella on bad taste. But at the same time it's extraordinarily plain. An easier import to drink when there aren't any other imported lagers around."
"In reality I can sum this up by saying it's Heineken, Becks, Grolsch, etc....brewed and bottled in Belgium. Rather typical of the European lagers that find their way to our stores. The pour was initially impressive with a fluffy cotton white head, but even that went away as time wore on. This is very drinkable and soft on the palate. Pretty basic and soon forgotten. Average lager."
"D - good drinkablity if it wasn't skunked i might like to have a few"
"This is a good session beer. If I want a refreshing beer, this would work well. Not my style at all, but do able. I will buy again (because my wife like them)"
"I drank this on tap in England years ago and really enjoyed it. The bottle I reviewed was unimpressive and IMHO terrible for a highly touted Belgian."
"Drinkability: Not so hot, if only because it's almost cloyingly sweet, and not a complex sweetness, but a sticky, simple sweetness. Alcohol's fine, well-hidden, but it's just not pleasant enough to bring me back for much more - I ended up handing this one back to the friend!"
"Served on-tap in a pint glass. Once we started to drink this, we were unsure why we ordered it and why we thought we liked it. The beer was a clear very pale yellow with a thin white head. Left some decent lacing, but that alone will not improve its score. No real aroma to it. The taste was awful. Watered down, carbonation was ok, but it was very thin and had no character to it. We could not finish the pint. Enough said."
"One of the summer hot day beers."
"Drinkability: Not terrible, but definitely not worth the price. I would drink it if it was around, but I don't think that this is anything I would go out of my way to buy again."
"Poured to a very light yellow and a two fingered head. Head was white in color. Left some lacing along the glass as it was consumed. Had the skunk smell as it was opened. Reminded me of Heineken. Also smelled of malt. Had a slightly skunk taste. Also some grain. Actually was very light tasting. Nothing strong at all. I expected a stronger taste than what it actualy had. Felt good in the mouth, very light. Carbonation was good. Overall I think this brew was good. Would like to try a session with it. Ill buy again."
"The palest yellow color. Two finger white head that recedes rather quickly butleaving some nice lacing. I can't help but chuckle to myself that is was poured into a Bud Light pint glass. Aroma of skunk, pale malts, very dry and slightly hoppy. Grainy, husk malt flavor, a little skunk again, average hop bitterness, but for than the nose would lead you to believe. Crisp and clean on the tongue. This used to be my ""expensive beer"" before I got into the world of crafts. I enjoy it still, despite my quest for bigger and better beers. Easy to drink and I still like this one on a hot summer day in Wisconsin's countryside."
"M + D: A reasonable, even somewhat rich carbonation which complements the body fairly well. It may not stand out against others, but it's very accessible and drinkability isn't an issue other than being a mood thing in terms of aroma/flavour (or lack thereof). I can do this one without complaints."
"Had a crisp, bitter mouthfeel, and about the same in the finish. Wasn't a bad beer, just nothing to write home about, particular for a ""premium"" beer."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat raspy, which I like. Medium/light body."
"Found a six pack of this on sale at the market for $8. I usually see it at around $12-$13 for a sixer so I thought I'd give it a shot. If you're looking for a beer with decent taste and pretty good drinkability, go ahead and pick some up if you can find it on sale. Otherwise, its not worth the price."
"Poured a nice light gold with good carbonation. Nose is refreshing, a little grainy but not bad. Taste has good malts, slightly hopped with a very light sweet/citrus note(very light). Pretty good overall."
"drinkability: Easy drinking beer that I contantly choose when out. It's starting to take over Heineken in populartity now."
"D - Yuck. There haven't been many beers that I haven't finished because they were just that bad, but this was one of them. Maybe a tap problem? Who knows, but this was one of the worst things to hit my lips in awhile. Perhaps the flavors of the beer don't do well with an on-tap translation."
"Golden yellow lager with a sort of small white head that fizzles out rather quickly. Smells semi-sweet and grainy. A little malty. No hoppyness in the smell but a little bit of hop bitterness in the flavor. Pleasant and clean tasting lager. It tastes like it was brewed from quality ingredients but it's not worth the ten-dollar-per-six-pack price tag. No poor aftertaste. It's definitely better than Budweiser but not worth the price to me."
"Drinkability: Well, low ABV, crispness and lightness lend itself to excelling in this category. Not my main choice for a refreshing beer, but its not bad. Its a better version of Heineken, I'd say, the flavors in this are a little more balanced out."
"D- Best thing about this beer. Easy to pound, but I've had better"
"It's the Budweiser of Premium Imports."
"[Nouse] Aroma is lightly malty (grain), moderately hoppy (herbs), light note of solvent. Smells and tastes a bit industrial."
"Comment a fairly easy drinking beer with some very mild flavors. A good beer."
"I remember this being better... it is pale yellow with minimal head, doesn't look any different than the typical keg party beer. Minimal smell. One taste I picked up that was a little different was bubble gum. I had this beer at the end of the night because I had a few too many heavy beers and wanted something a little lighter. This really isn't any better than any cheap American alternative. Don't pay extra for it."
"This is a beer that I would enjoy at local bar and, or at a get together with friends. I will definitely drink this beer again."
"Notes: A good fresh Stella well have a good delicate and somewhat dry flavor that pairs well with food in place of dry white wine."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not very filling, decent kick, since I didn't really find much difference between this beer and many of the macros out there, I would choose most of them first simply because they're cheaper. This beer didn't give me much of a reason to select it again."
"D: Good drinkability above and beyond. An easy session, easy recommend, and one of the cleanest tasting lagers ive tasted. A prime example by style."
"I was able to pound three down rather quickly, but that isn't the point. Save your money and buy something else...unless of course your friend is willing to shell out the coin for you to drink this ""wonderful drink from my homeland""."
"Drinkability is average but the hangover is even higher. In North America, if you're going to spend this amount of money, you can do much better."
"I like Stella for what it is. It's an easy to find solid session beer. Golden colored, light-bodied, this beer goes down very smooth with very little aftertaste. Refreshing. Slightly grainy and sweet tasting. I'd say this one is ideal for sitting out in the sun and again, not a bad session lager."
"This beer is sold in just about every pub/tavern in the area. I never felt motivated to drink it until yesterday. The best that I can say about this beer is that it is unremarkable and unoffensive. I don't even think it is as complex as Heineken, which isn't saying very much. The best I can say about this beer is that if I wanted to drink a ton of mass produced lager it could be this. It may be a good cross-over beer from people looking to finally mature enough to step away from the Miller Lite / Bud Lite crowd."
"So I decided to try Stella again. Through my many past sips, I always deemed it a failure of massive, well-marketed proportions, and I haven't touched it since my first BA review of the stuff. But after many a friend argued of it's euro lager superiority over, say, Grolsch, I figured I'd give it a shot. And it was mediocre, which is a huge step up from the atrocity that it was the last time I checked (maybe some of them actually are skunked, and it's not just the flavor!). In any case, it's an okay beer, fairly smooth, with some mild skunkiness. Body's thin and not too interesting, and the carbonation's pretty high. Crisp, and none-too-terrible if you're feeling thirsty but also wanna get drunk."
"D - For me, pretty low. For those you're trying to ween of Bud Light, high..."
"D - Most people would not like, but a nice euro take on a lager style."
"I think what I said in the drinkability section describes it best; it goes down great but it's too expensive to justify doing that. I really didn't think there was a whole lot of ""character"" to it. It seems to be just a pretty ""clean"" beer overall. I'm not too disappointed, but I'm not really impressed by it either. However, it's not nearly as God-awful as that Kronenbourg 1664 (which I believe is of a similar style), so my rating should reflect that."
"Drinkability - Is actually quite high on these for me. It's light, smooth, and goes down easily. I could session these, but they're too overpriced for me."
"d: even if you don't want to think about or taste your beer, I would suggest something else. this stuff tends to be a bit pricey. why on earth is this beer so popular? The flavor isn't particularly good and it isnt any more refreshing than a say...a Session lager. Whatever, to each his own."
"This is a fine lager.It has a golden yellow color. A yeasty, slight hop aroma. Nice head. The taste is a nice light crisp lager with a mild hop flavor. great with food. It has excellent effervesence with a light, inviting mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer."
"D: It is a bit overrated by the main stream but you could serve much worse at a picnic or bbq. Will go with any kind of BBQ and has some flavor qualities."
"D- This is not a beer snob's beer for sure. Easy to drink but just not that good."
"Not a bad choice, but I'm not sure it's worth the premium price vs. American Macro's"
"Drinkability: Not quite reprehensible, but notable for it's blandness and lack of character."
"It's very easy to drink. This is a very inoffensive, non-challenging beer. It's nice but, for my taste, a bit ordinary. It's not a bad beer by any means and it's well worth your while to try it if you're accustomed to mass-market lagers and you want something just slightly different."
"Feel and drinkability commensurate with that of water."
"D - Not especially, I do not enjoy skunky beers so after the first one I would switch to another. The more I drink it wasn't to bad, it had a light taste to it."
"D- I can see how fans of this style could have several of these. personally, im not a big fan. however it is pretty nice for a ""grocery store"" beer."
"if you take it for what it is worth, this is a nice beer. It pours brilliant golden, with a fluffy head and surprising lacing. The aroma is strong and honey-like. The flavor is bright, lemony and grainy with a subtle bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel is light and pleasant. The beer is best drunk cold, however - as it warms, it develops a slightly sour, cardboard character, which hurts its overall drinkability."
"D- Initially was not expecting much prior to drinking, considering a macro brew, but came away surprised, would easily select among the better of the macro brews, in a lager area, that i have had."
"D- Overall this was a terrible beer. I'd drink it before another Peroni, but that's not saying much."
"D: OK. None of the flavors are overpowering but if it was a bit fresher tasting it might be better."
"this one is great, the grain is smouth and the hops roll in niceley, this is what a lager is suposta taste like. this pours a nice golden color with a big head that quickley disapers. this is the pinical of what green glass skunkey beer can be. this one always is in my beer rotation. try two or three you wont be disapointed."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and pretty smooth. It just lacks any real flavor whatsoever. I really did not enjoy this at all. I dumped half of it out, in fact. An incredible waste of money for what it costs...not sure why anyone would buy this with better, cheaper options available."
"Mouthfeel is on the oily side, but still fairly thin. Not very memorable."
"Poured with a slightly dark gold appearance. No real lacing. Head was a bit patchy and bubbly. Slightly sweet aromas of honey, malt and hops. The sweet taste was maintained throughout the drink wrapped around a bready texture. Mouthfeel stabilized its sweetness but it is was pretty average. Overall, a decent drink."
"Fairly light head, good lacing. Pale yellow color, like weak tea. Very high carbonation, and overall a pleasant and interesting flavor, with a touch of skunkiness. Good mouthfeel, and drinkable enough; overall a solid beer, but nothing special, particularly among the Belgians."
"Drinkability is pretty top notch. Six packs of this can be polished off pretty quickly, and don't be surprised to order more of this stuff while eating a great chicken dinner!"
"D: One of the better mainstream European lagers out there. The flavour can get boring at times, but overall still pretty good."
"It's the cure"
"I enjoyed this beer. Very refreshing. Will definitely drink this again."
"D - Ok beer, it has a little too much bitterness in the finish for me."
"D: Good"
"A descent pale lager that is always a good go-to when other better beers aren't available. Pretty smooth and tasty."
"Too alcoholic anyway."
"Avoid this swill. A black mark on the reputation of a country that brews some of the finest beer in the world."
"D: Not THE brew for me, but I will drink it to break up the monotony in a macro heavy bar. Not bad, not great. Its ok."
"D: In the end this is just an above-average Euro pale lager, but nothing special. It goes down easily, but would be more drinkable if it had more flavor."
"Body and mouthfeel very average, basically fizzy yellow beer."
"The Belgians brew some fine beer, even their lagers are half decent. This pours a clear golden color with a nice white head. The nose is grainy with some fairly fresh hops. The taste has light hops and grainy malts, but no significant off flavors. A light crisp body. One of the better lagers around."
"A side note - During my visit to London and trying many different pubs around the downtown Westminster area, I found that this beer was served at about 80% of the pubs. Perhaps this is Europe's ""Anheiser-Busch?"""
"My wife likes this beer...which is not a good sign for many beers! (just kidding, huney!...love ya!)"
"Drinkability- Not my first choice but a good substitute to other Macrobrews."
"Not worth it for me, another green bottle disappointment."
"The appearance is typical of lagers but leans a bit towards the weaker side of a golden pilsner. The head comes about huge but dissipates quickly leaving little to no lacing. The smell is a bit funky and the taste is quite skunky (rhyme unintended). Mouthfeel is a tad flat and uninteresting. Drinkability is just average, I would equate this to a flat Heineken without the kick. Go for a Grolsch instead, you'd be much more pleased with the result."
"Thanks, Belgium!"
"Much more flavorful from the tap than the bottle, but even from the bottle, it stands out among its ilk."
"I guess this fall under what I have dubbed the ""Bud"" of a country which is any beer that is mass produced and mass consumed. This beer is the Bud of Belgium. I had it chilled in a pilsener glass. It poured a bright golden color with an OK white head. The nose was pathetic. Only a mild maltiness was dicernable with my nostrils right up to it. The taste was what I expected, a thin, slighty malty brew with a fizzyness on the tongue. I guess it you are a novice at beer and are used to the tasteless lagers, with this you can say you have had something foriegn besides Heineken."
"Drinkability: Definitely a beer I could imagine having again but also definitely over hyped. Some European guys I met over the summer made this sound like the holy grail of all beers going on and on about how ""fohkin stella is the best fohkin beer there is"". I could definitely see where they were coming from however I'd say it is a far cry from the best ""fohkin"" beer out there."
"Notes: Better on tap in my opinion. Typical taste and really nothing to complain about except that the brand is heavily marketed as some kind of wonder brew,nothing of a sort."
"D- Not bad but not great either.This beer is okay but not the great belgian masterpiece it is hyped up to be."
"D - i have had this beer numerous times and this is the first time i felt like reviewing it. it was rather enjoyable and i would order it at a bar with limited selections."
"D: A nice beer to pair with food. Not interesting enough to be consumed by itself."
"Drinkability - Drinkable, and was decent with a steak sandwich."
"Overall, this is a decent euro-lager. Easy drinking and quite a bit tastier than some other choices in the style. Still, muddled, green-bottle skunk is haunting it."
"Bottle, 330 ml. Golden colour, head is not too big but has a good retention and lace. Nose is grain and herbs, not too much mention here. Light body, taste is clean, again grain, herbs and some unexpected sweetness. Very refreshing. I've tried this one many times, on tap too. Maybe Interbrew is doing a more massmarket beer of it, but it's still good, maybe without the whole character it use to had years ago, but enjoyable yet."
"Pours a pale yellow with frothy white head, ok retention and decent lacing. Smell: muted grain and noble hops, euro lager import character. Taste: husky grain, pale malt, light noble hops. Mouthfeel: light bodied, medium carbonation. Nothing special, but decent for the style."
"Avoid if possible."
"D: Nothing special but a good all-around euro-lager that is very easy to throw back and had a nice grassy flavour as well. I pity the person who drinks this beer and thinks it's the best Belgium has to offer. Nevertheless, I definitely see this beer in my future for a long time coming."
"Drinkability is OK but I just don't like skunk. I apologize, I know we are not supposed to review bad beer but I am going to guess that a majority of these are the same. Therevfore, this is normal for these beers and thus the rating. I tried one, not again unless I am closer to the origin."
"This beer actually has hops character and given what I've heard, that surprised me. It's very mild, but there's an undeniably grassy and herbal taste in the back of this otherwise clean and rather plain beer. The malt is just sweet and bready and there's a slight mineral taste to the water. This could pass as an uninspired German pilsner, instead it makes for a decent pale lager."
"Drinkability: Average and a bit refreshing."
"D- Had 2 mouthfuls and couldnt stand it any more, an insult to beer in my opinion."
"D: What can I say? I paid 8.99 for a six-pack of this? I will say that the green bottles and pretty labels look great."
"D: It may be that his bottle was skunked. It sure tasted that way. I could barely finish the drink...but I did. Never Again!!"
"Pours a very clear pale golden color with a thin white head. Even with a rough pour, the head is gone in an instant. Sweet, fruity aroma. Perhaps apricot. Taste follows suit with a subdued fruity sweetness. Aftertaste is nearly as non-existent as the hops. Very mild bitterness after the initial clean finish. As it warms, the hops come out a bit more. Better in the 50's. It is what it is- a macro lager."
"D - Inoffensive and easy to drink. Most of us have had the old wifebeater at some point in our lives, but, if by chance, you haven't, it's certainly not a bad macro alternative."
"Upon opening the Green Bottle Skunk monster was quite present, but it evacuated as I poured into drinking conveyance. Smell is mild, very mild hops. Taste is very similar to smell. Nothing outstanding, average at best. Bubbles are definitely present on taste palate which sort of messes with finish, otherwise, a decent beer and a good choice if nothing else is available."
"D- Not as bad as alot of people say, I even like drinking them with a heavy meal. And sometimes I find myself really craving one. But not something I'd enjoy everyday."
"D - If I were hot and REALLY thirsty, I might have finished that 6 pack!"
"I have been drinking a case of this during the week and I am not impressed. Looks sort of bright yellow,smell light hops, taste not bad but not what I thought from what I was told it would be like. Small head, it is not much for refreshment in your mouth/ You can drink a couple easy enough but do you want to for me two is the max and one is better."
"Definately drinkable, I could have had a few more."
"Drinkability was good, which is no surprise for such a mild brew. Maybe it's me but I'm just not that big of a fan. This beer didn't do anything wrong, it just didn't really do anything."
"it was the best selection they had on the menu to choose from, and in that case it was very drinkable and i would order it again if that was the best choice, but if something else was available i would order that."
"I would consider this a fairly good euro pale lager. Decent flavors, but could use some work on the auroma."
"D: Pretty darn refreshing on a hot summer day, but I can think of 1,500 beers I'd look to first before I'd ever think of considering Stella..."
"Taste/mouthfeel - Semi-sweet pale malts make up the bulk of the flavor. A bit grassy toward the middle with a slight husky bitterness in the finish along with the faintest trace of hops. Overcarbonated, somewhat bloating despite the very light body. Not as clean as I would expect from a macro lager, but there are no major flaws either. Mediocre stuff, but drinkable."
"D - Drinkability is good. It really is a lighter beer that goes down fairly easy. I'll probably end up getting it again."
"Overall not a big beer, but it's not trying to be. This is a step above a Heineken or Becks, but a step below say a Pilsner Urquell. For what it's worth, I sort of enjoy this beer now and then."
"I was hoping from more from this Belgian beer. It is better than Bud but not by much. It is a bit stronger but actually may be somewhat more bitter (not a good trait in my mind)."
"Very easy to drink and enjoy all night."
"Not a bad export lager. Better then a lot of the usual suspects."
"Available everywhere so it's better than most of the ususal suspects. Easy to drink a few at a sitting."
"I usually like a lot of flavor in my beer but this was quite the exception."
"poured 12 ounce green bottle into a 16 oz pilsner glass. moderate head, some lacing. light hoppy aroma with a hint of skunkiness. feels light and thin in the mouth, very crisp in taste with nice balance. a very drinkable beer but nothing to write home about."
"Despite the paleness of flavors, and virtually invisible malts, the body carries a small amount of weight and an uppity but non obnoxious carbonation level. It's a great basic washer or quencher. But there is simply not enough flavor here to recommend it, even against many of its Euro lager peers. Especially with the ""premium"" image and price point it assumes."
"One of my fav beers. I found this one to be a tad better on tap than in the bottle."
"Drinkability: Average drinkable beer. Good guzzler."
"I was a bit dissapointed with this beer given it's sterling reputation. It looked like an ordinary pale lager with a good deal of carbonation. The hop flavors were somewhat complex but also noisy, confused and not unified. It was okay, but not great. Next time I'll order something different."
"D-Quite drinkable. It's pretty light and tasty. Not entirely my style, but it's fairly easy to find, so when there is a somwhat limited selection, this would be a pretty decent choice."
"The body of this one a tad more than light but definitely not ""medium"". I found it mostly average but it has it's limited charm."
"Good amount of carbonation. Very light and easy to drink. Not a style I drink often, at least not anymore, but this one is a decent one."
"The taste is bland. The only thing that sets this one apart is a slight pepper like taste on finish. Carbonation is active and lends a crisp, clean finish. Very easy drinking but if I am paying import prices I am getting something a little more exciting."
"Drinkability: This particular bottle was quite nice and I would enjoy it often if they all were like this. I have had my fair share of terrible stella's as well. The key, I think it to get 12 packs that aren't going to be exposed to light in storage the way that 6 packs would. Rating on this bottle, drinkability is great."
"Not my favorite style, but, all in all, a nice macro-euro-lager."
"On draft, this beer takes a different personaility. It isn't skunky for starters, and the bitterness melds into the overall flavor better, but still pretty dull. The chilled glass and colder beer temperature might have helped. After all, the marketers of Stella Artois insist on serving it at 3 degrees Celcius. After drinking a bunch of ales recently, I found a mellow beer chill out on, courtesy of the bar near my school."
"D- i thoroughly enjoy stella and sometimes purchase a case of this beer on occasion. i figured i would write about it this time."
"This was served at about 40°F (5°C), which causes this well carbonated beer to have a peppery carbonic acid bite to it up front. Crisp, and clean up front with a biting bitterness that easily cuts through the light malt character here. The hop bitterness picks up a bit of herbal hop character to it as it moves towards the finish. The malt character starts out pretty dry and really nonexistent, but picks up a soft grain-like sweetness and a touch of cracker-like malt by the time one gets to the finish. This is very clean and at this temperature has not off flavors. Quite crisp and refreshing actually, but I'll admit that when I am in need of crisp and refreshing I usually opt for water. This is certainly not a bad beer, if they had only used a quirky, Belgian yeast this might actually be quite tasty."
"Could drink a couple of these. Too much of a boring, pale taste to want to drink more than one. Much better offerings of this type of beer can be found anywhere. Don't know why this beer is popular."
"Light golden pour with white head. Light taste overall, and high carbonation. Some honey sweet, malt smell. Similar taste with a light quick bitterness and aftertaste. Simple and refreshing and easy to drink. Nothing to go wild over, but for the style, perhaps one of the better lagers."
"D: Like sipping water in the taste and not at all enjoyable. Ive always wished Id liked this one because some really think its decent but just not happening."
"Drinkability is average because while it's easy to drink one, it kinda blurs together after that first one and you don't really get flavors and it has quite a kick from the deceptively low ABV."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer that's been picked up by quite a few bars (not a good sign). People seem to think because it has a a foreign name it's good. It's averageness is a hard thing to overcome."
"Had this in a bottle at Bone Fish Grill on Route 46 in Jersey... Good Pale Lager taste... decent appearance with typcial lager smell... taste was pleasant, went down smooth and easily and complimented my fish dish very well... an easily drinkable, good mouthfeel, enjoyable social brew... wouldn't definitely try this again if it was offered at a restaurant or pub... a European staple and popular brew for many obvious reasons... I liked this brew although it wasn't anything above-and-beyond..."
"I really think Stella is quite crappy, and thus would not drink it again. However, there is a following among yuppies who see the tap, like holding the glass, and consider it a trendier beverage than Bud Light, it's lesser priced American twin."
"This is the Budweiser of Belgium, albeit a better quality beer than a Bud. A pretty standard Euro-lager, refreshing and unoffensive. It bothers me a bit when someone says they like Belgian beer and are talking about Stella."
"Decent beer, remined me of Pilsner Urquell but maybe it's just the green bottle and pale color. I expected a skunky flavor because of the bottle, but was pleasantly surprised. No skunkiness at all. Mild in flavor, with a slight bitterness. High level of carbonation and poured an almost 2"" head. Overall a good, light, drinkable brew that would be refreshing on a hot summer day."
"D - While its really nothing special I will say that its better than a macro"
"This was really not a good beer for me. Poured a decent straw color with some good head and lacing. Weak malty scent, with a slightly sour/skunk tint. Same for the taste, fairly weak, mostly sour. Went down all right, but beyond the sixer I have, I'll never get it again."
"This review is for the bottle version, which is not as good as the tap version. Still, Stella is my favorite of the widely distributed macro brews. I'm not sure how anyone could think this beer tastes the same as Becks, or how anyone could give it a drinkability score of 2 or lower. Simply put, it's a simple beer, and if there aren't any good or unusual beers available at a restaurant, I'll pay for one on tap. Or, for home drinking, I'll pay for a 12 of these at $12 or $13 if they're on sale. One could do much worse."
"I first had this while doing research in Detroit, and it was a nice lunch accompaniment. This poured a fine light golden body with a finger of white froth. Not much for the nose, though--malt, certainly, but little else. The taste was nice, crisp, clean, and with good hopped flavor. Yet the carbonation was far too heavy, like bold ginger ale, and I just don't like to burp that much, that fast. All in all, not bad--not a typical Belgian style by a long shot--more like a decent German lager masquerading as a Belgian. Give it a shot."
"This beer poured a light gold with a fair amount of foam that quickly dissipated. It smells a bit sweet, and the flavor likewise. There's a bit of grassy hops flavor but not too much. It's basically a watered down pils that is supposed to be sexy because it's an import. I'd skip Stella next time and go with an actual beer."
"If you like a good lager, this looks and tastes exactly like a good lager should. It has the distinct golden aura and smooth taste of many European lagers, but with that added bit of distinction that it has been brewed for over 600 years. This is by far my favorite beer to drink any time, with any fare."
"If you have never tried this beer, DO so. In the scores you will see a wide deviation of scores and reviews unexpectedly polarized. It's also worth noting that Euro Pale Lagers in general score very low among BA reviews (Sort this style by score, and try to find just TWO euro pales scoring over 4.00 points... see what I mean?). Stella is heavily advertised, hyped, and not-unexpectedly it suffers from a possible backlash."
"I love this beer, it reminds me of Peroni in many ways, this would be a great beer to eat with Italian food. this is an old stand by beer, if there is nothing else to drink. I would Highly recommend this beer, but not to timid beer drinkers,I had about 3 of these beers and have heard that Budwieser bought out this beer in Oklahoma, and may not carry it anymore. Hope that is not true."
"Drinkability: Not a bad European lager. I am amazed at how quickly this brand has grown in the U.S. market during the last few years."
"When you buy this beer you're paying for the hype. If you want something clean and clear that tastes like beer, don't pay more than you have to."
"I must note one thing: when I worked at a liquor store in Florida this was an immensley popular beer w/ the ""expensive"" beer crowd (that means the people who didn't buy Busch or Bud). This is a watered down version of a good Belgian, so if you are into Belgians alot you'll probably be better served spending the extra buck or two and buying the real deals."
"Drinkability : bière sans grand caractère dans le style des pilsener de base"
"i was inspired by a recent forum to try this beer ; pours a clear light golden straw color w/ a fluffy white head which dissapates quickly, good lacing ; a vinous, macro, adjunct smell, with a slight hop aroma ; crisp, good hop bite at first, then it just fizzles away to nothingness, almost watery, a very faint alcohol undertone, not as bad as i thought it'd be, but nothing spectacular ; a dry light bodied beer w/ good carbonation ; i consider this a very drinkable beer, if it was cheap i'd replace my Labatt ice w/ it..."
"This is a very unexceptional beer. Tastes like an American macrobrew. By unexceptional I don't mean bad but it is has nothing to distinguish it from the rest of the pack. Golden color with coarse carbonation. Smells kind of like Heineken, in fact I doubt many people could tell the difference in a blind taste test. Feels thin in the mouth with a slightly sour aftertaste. Average drinkability."
"Uggh. I should have ordered a glass of water instead. But, This is Belgian beer for the masses!! I got this on-tap at the restaurant at work. No head when I got it. Faint aromas, like an American Pils. Taste was watery, not predominate BEER! flavors in my face to speak of. I have to give the beer credit though for its easy drinkability. Its gone before you know it, (maybe due to the lack of taste). Anyway, ill drink as long as there giving it to me."
"Nothing too impressive about this brew. From what I've read, seen, and heard, it seems like this brew is considered ""great"" by people who usually enjoy macros, which is fine. I think this is a definite step up from a macro, but still nothing too impressive. It has it's mild hop tastes and malts, but nothing out of the ordinary. Great beer to kick back and relax with, and definitely easier to find than a lot of other beers, but nothing I'd order at a bar if there were other micros around. Overall, if you're at a beer bar or store that only carries macros, this is the way to go. But if you see a good selection of other brews, this probably isn't the best of the bunch."
"This is not worth your time or money. Stella is a beer for those trying to look sophisticated and cultured to people who don't know any better. I never thought I'd say this, but save your money and just get a Budweiser."
"A unwanted dry aftertaste which knocks my drinkability score too."
"This is a great beer to order at a bar. Basically you can find this anywhere now. It's lite, sweet and good. A staple safety beer when there isn't much of a selection."
"Overall it's just about the only mass-produced pale lager I can actually stand to drink. Very easy to drink, goes well with certain cuisines, and is a good ""snack beer"" because it isn't filling and takes absolutely no thought. For the price, I'll take a pack of Great Lakes and keep the dollar any day, but if pale lagers are your thing, this one isn't all bad of a choice."
"EDIT: Recent tastings have convinced me that Australian brewed Stella is actually pretty crap. It's about damn time I reduced the score on this, and a re-review would probably result in an even lower score."
"This was a much better experience. It's still a little overhyped, but had a better experience with the bottle."
"Look, for what it is in my opinion this is a very good beer. A crisp, drinkable, light, refreshing beer."
"Pours a bright and clear light golden yellow color and displays a huge fluffy white head that just won't go away. This beer demonstrates active carbonation bubbles and spotty lacing inside the pint glass. The nose is virtually non-existent, as is characteristic of most light lagers, but some malt sweetness can be detected and there is no tell-tale skunkiness or other off notes here. Doesn't smell bad; it just doesn't smell like much of anything at all. The palate is much the same - very unchallenging, of course, but this beer is designed to be drinkable, right? Slightly sweet malt flavors are predominant and there is just enough hop backbone to keep it in balance. Finish is clean and dry with light acidity. Beer snobs love to slam this beer right along with the typical American-made light lagers, but I don't know that this is fair. While this beer is high on drinkability, and quite plain in almost every respect, it doesn't contain any of the off-flavors that characterize so many of the domestic macros. I can enjoy this beer with an appropriate meal and I'll select it over almost any domestic light lager if given the chance. I'm not saying this beer is great, but I am saying it is better and slightly more flavorful than it's American contemporaries."
"The body is light but understandable for style. A clean taste but not as crisp for style either. A very easy drinking beer to say in the least."
"Pours a clear pale golden color with a fizzy short lived head. No lacing. Aroma is simple. A little grassy. Taste is rather lacking. Nothing special. A little hop bitternes is noticed late in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin, light and almost watery. Not what I expected. Don't let the Belgian name on the bottle fool you, this is nothing to go out of your way to get. On tap it is a little better, but still just like any macro-brewed lager around. The real pisser was that I just forked over $9.49 for a 6-pack tonight!"
"I guess despite the lack of mouthfeel or taste it is pretty drinkable, but there are other beers I would definitely reach for before this Stella Artois."
"Taste has a hint of malt, and some sort of weird spice after-taste. Completely foul."
"Overall this is an average to slightly above average effort. I would drink again but not go out of my way to purchase."
"Medium pale color with a minimal amount of head. Hey, it's another lager. I'm kind of really into lagers now. Anyway, The aroma is light and crisp with a mild sweetness. Taste is very sweet and somewhat bitter at the same time. Could that be the hops, possibly Saaz? Regardless, the taste is kind of heavy and strong, not what I was expecting. Still a decent, middle-of-the-road choice."
"Could drink a whole lot of these"
"Stella is a good beer, and better than its regional cousin, Grolsch. (Grolsch must have changed their recipe in the past 20 years. It's macro-bitter now.) Stella has malt, though it is somewhat dry. Some type of continental hops are here. Considering the price and small bottles, I'll opt for other beers."
"Poured from a Green bottle into a Stella Goblet,got the usual mild skunk aroma right off the bat.Nice clear golden yellow color with good size white head that didn't linger to long with absolutely no lacing,Skunk smell dissipated rather quickly and left a clean,fresh grain aroma.This beer goes down quite nicely,refreshing crisp and tangy with a little bitterness bite to it with a little heaviness to it and carbonation that leaves a dryness behind.Well worth a try."
"Pale golden brew with a decent white head and some average lacing. The aroma is all wheat/grass/bread, kind of dry. But the first taste comes out somewhat creamy for a lager, still bready with a somewhat tart, yeasty quality, a dry finish. I've always liked Stella on tap. it seems a bit less impressive by the bottle, more ordinary and less crisp, as one might expect. I don't pick up so much citrus as I recall from the tap. There is a little sweet malt here but it's well overrun by the yeast and bread flavors in the bottle. Easy enough to drink but it grows a bit worn out after a few."
"Although not overly complicated, I find this euro lager has substantial attitude but is perhaps a little overbearing if you plan to drink several in the same sitting. I think just one of these would take care of my needs, I'd enjoy it but likely move on to something else, if available."
"Stella is the typical ""premium beer"" restaurants have on tap. It is a sessionable beer, I could easily down a few of these. But nothing really stands out about the beer, the hops are there- and there are more than a typical beer, and the flavor is OK. But for the price- 8-9, there are plenty of other good beers."
"Pours a light yellow color with minimal white head. Smell is not very strong, and I can kinda smell some malt and mostly grain. The taste is bittering and gives way to again more of the grainy taste. It leaves a tiny bit of sweetness that might be the reason people keep drinking these. The carbonation is crisp and made a nice compliment with the spicy dish."
"A light golden color with a thin, fizzy head. Smell is of light hops. Somewhat skunky also. Taste is light hops and honey-like malts. Very light and slightly bitter. Decent drinkability though this isn't a regular. I'd rather have it on-tap but can't complain about the bottle."
"Wasn't to much to say about this, It kind of reminded me of Warsteiner only snappier. Does not remind me at all of belgian style beers.It was near 95 that day the grill was going and I enjoyed the few I had. If I had no other options besides BMC I would pick this up in a heartbeat!"
"Run of the mill lager, tasty but not up to it's hype. After it's appearance it's all slightly downhill."
"On tap, and poured into a shaker. This pale lager poured the typical clear, golden color, with a huge amount of dancing carbonation bubbles dancing up the sides of the glass. A very thin, white fizzy head quickly faded away. The aroma of this beer was sweet malts and some surprisingly strong (for a pale lager) hop notes. The flavor was much the same. Sweet maltiness followed by a nice noble hop presence. One of the better pale lagers that I have sampled."
"Always anticipating but always disappointed. Looks refreshing, but the flavor is just plain mediocre, in my humble opinion- and I try everything. It has a slight acidity in the back of the throat when it goes down. I give it the benefit of the doubt time after time, but Mr. Stomach tells me to avoid it altogether now. My brother likes this golden lager, but I always get a sour gut from it. I cannot recommend a beer that consistently makes me sick after one bottle."
"Over-hyped and fairly average lager."
"Overall: crisp and refreshing but very common. The lager style is definitely not a specialty in Belgium."
"This isn't a very a very good tasting euro pale lager, and it's a bit heavy, so I don't feel it's drinkable at all. The best part is the glass, which, along with Belgium's (well deserved) reputation for brewing the best beers, are probably the only reason it's popular."
"This tasting changed my impression of the Stella Atois significantly."
"D: Very Impressive for a mass marketed beer. I'm seeing this more and more at the ""lesser bars and restaurants"" that don't quite carry a decent selection of imports. I would choose this lager over most of the more common selections."
"Drinkability: Par for the course for a Euro Pale Lager."
"There is one thing I did think that did stand out about this one and that was the apperance a nice gold color besides that everything else was pretty much average. The taste was smooth something you would drink after a hard day. The smell (hardly any to speak of) was very faint. It is worth a try but I would try a 6 before a 12."
"Drinkability? Why bother, it's empty calories."
""
"Highly drinkable for the summer, but not the fall and winter."
"This is possibly the most boring Belgian beer you can buy, but it's really not bad. Quality seems quite high, although my bottle seems a bit on the skunked side, so I have tried to account for that in my score. This is the best beer available on-tap at many venues in Australia, so I will probably be drinking it again, but there are a lot better session beer choices out there."
"Partial to Stella in times of mass drinking, I figured it deserved a rating...lively malt crispiness greets the nostrils as a soft, golden effervesecent lacing that forms strong coral-like branches....smooth, crisp and nondescript taste accompanied by lagerish palete with some bubbliness...to me, a macro with at least a clue of how to present itself..."
"The aroma is mild and malty, and not too strong. It pours a nice golden colour with a fair sized white head and looks like a beer should. It is very smooth to the tongue and goes down nicely. It has a mild taste that makes this a very easy beer to drink."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking beer. Pale lagers are not my style, but I'll take this over the bigger name pale lagers - and all macros."
"12oz green bottle. Pours golden with a sudsy head. Big bubbles race to the top of the beer. This brew shows good clarity. Has that sharp green bottle beer smell; kinda like newly mown hay mixed with salty sea air. Spicey malt and salty hops. My samples are fresh from a 12-pack box and are not oxidised. Tastes basically like most euro-lagers except has a pronounced salty bittering hop character. My guess is Saaz hops. Not bad but also not that interesting to me. I know lots of people go crazy for this beer and I'm always up to sharing a round, but I favor other styles. A good beer to keep handy though because of guests who might cringe over all the ales I have around(who keeps inviting these people?)."
"Drinkabilitiy - easy to drink, has that ""less filling"" feel"
"D: Seems like a beer that would go over well with a heavy-drinking crowd that's gotten tired of other European macros or BMC and want to step it up. Oddly enough, it feels like this beer is a step above in that regard, but certainly remains toward the bottom part of the ladder in the grand scheme of things."
"Nice clean refreshing lager. Light mouthfeel and crisp, very clean finish make this a perfect summer beer. Nicely hopped without a lot of heavy malt. Not very bitter. Serve ice cold and drink before it warms up. A good replacement for your the unwashed horde that drinks bud."
"DA: This is one of my favorite Euro lagers."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, not overlly filling and with enough flavor to be interesting."
"I think there is a time and a place for Stella. I find that it is easier to get at most places then other craft beers that I might like more, and it's a good thirst quencher. Good clean euro-lager, better on tap with the fancy-dancy gold rimed stella glass. I think it's over-rated and over-priced to grab a six-pack. I find it priced over $8 for a sixer out here and it kills me to see people buying them over the rainbow of flavors we're so lucky to have here in Oregon, but whatever. Still, not a bad beer, better than the macro lagers here in the states, at least there's a nice hop flavor here."
"this is very light straw colored in the glass and clear enough that i could watch tv through it were it not for the contour of the glass. a snow white head that was creamy with decent lacing, suggesting that it was not force-carbonated like most macros. hay, vegetal, and musty belgian notes in the nose. taste is a mixture of light malt sweetness and light hops in the background. mouthfeel is light in body but without the fake feeling carbonation in the mouth of most macros. light, light, light...i can see why this beer is so ubiquitous. it does have more going on than mast macro lagers, however, and i detected no adjuncts. drinkability is fine, but not enough going on to make you want to keep drinking. maybe a good thirst quencher on a hot day."
"This beer pours a nice clear golden color and has a nice long lasting head with good lacing. Unfortunately it is very skunky, probably because of the green bottle letting UV rays in. It tastes slightly skunky, but is crisp and clean. Tastes crisp and bitter, kind of like a cross between Czechvar and Heineken. Average pils, better than an American Pils, since it does have flavor, but not overly impressive."
"This beer seems to be getting smacked around a bit, but it is a much better than average lager. It is light in flavor and color and mouthfeel when compared to most Belgium beers but when compared to beers like it from the U.S. (especially macros) I find it to be one of my favorite beers when it comes to refreshing, light, and satisfying beers on a warm spring or summer day. Solid head for the style and some lacing. The flavor is slightly sweet that goes well with grilled fish, or chicken. The aroma is light with a hint of hops but nothing to write home about. I had four last night while grilling out and listening to Got The Green Grass by Ian Moore and watching my kids swim. I tell ya, it doesn't get any better than that."
"One of the most popular Belgians out there, but I guess for the masses it is a good bridge to get you there. Looking a standard pilsner, very clarified and clean. A nice bite, and ends just like a standard pils. It is a little sweeter than pils from Germany and the Czech Republic."
"Pours out a pale gold with a thick, full head that leaves tightly wound lacing on the glass. In the nose I get a mix of pale grain, spicy hops, and a touch of booze. Flavor is about the same as in the nose but without the alcohol character. Malts come out in full and end kind of sweet. The hops make a decent showing giving some tea and floral flavors. Mouthfeel is a little slick and needs a little oomph in the carbonation. Overall a decent drinker, and I don't know why people want to knock this. Nothing offensive and certainly steps above corn and rice-laden macros."
"It's a pale Euro lager, nothing to write home about but almost always 'there'. Not really better or worse than others, but certainly not offensive."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, pretty well carbonated, and goes down easy enough. Not a terrible beer for a hot day. If I liked it better I'd call it a session, but I don't think I'd want more than two. Overall, it's an okay beer. I certainly prefer it over an American macro."
"The exp. date didn't effect the beer any I think. If it did, it was very slightly alter. Does a beer made since 1366 need to have a born on date?"
"Pours very yellow and clear, with a small head that fades to just a collar very quickly. Little in the way of active carbonation. The nose betrays some salty, slightly rubbery hops and a light toast (as in heated bread) malt note. It's a decent aroma as macros go. On the palate, initial sweetness gives way to a cardboardish bitterness that's a bit unpleasant. No depth to the malt. Very bland at the finish. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation and light in body, with no distinguishing features. Overall, this is not very good. The aroma is pretty promising, but it falls apart on the palate, with low-quality malt and hop flavors that don't stand out in any way... nor do they please the tongue. Gotta love marketing."
"This isn't quite as bad as the snobs would have you believe. But still, I wouldn't drink it unless it came to me unsolicited. Which this one did. Time for a Scaldis."
"What can you say about a Stella that the last 500 people haven't. It is pale, doesn't have much of a head, has lots of good carbonation. This is a typical euro lager but with a sharpness that compromises its quality. Slight hoppy flavor, cooked vegetables, a dry beer, not all that interesting but not bad either. It is a shame this comes out of Belgium, a country with the finest beers available, and Stella and Maes being the two worst representatives from the country."
"Hands down pick for my favorite everyday beer. Its got that light, almost non-existent hops smell, light carbonation and blond color that says BEER. It wont change your life but it has just a little more than your average pale lager. Bitter but with some fruit."
"If I see another I think I will pick it up,but not going to go out of my way to pick some up."
"Drinkability: I am sure this beer was much better in the past but as it stands right now it is a slight step over the heinekins, becks, buds, etcs of the world. I could probably drink 3 or 4 of these on a hot summer day but thats about it. The price is slightly outrageous, if I were to actually purchase this beer in a 12 pack its almost 15 dollars which to me is crazy. I do not see myself visiting this beer again after my free 12 pack is history."
"O: A good session beer. Not challenging, nor terribly interesting, but very reliable, and very drinkable."
"Plus, the wrapping around the bottle cap makes it seem fancy."
"A decent beer. Golden and transparent, with a moderate head. Aroma is decidedly beery. Taste is malty, no bitterness, no complexity. Not spectacular, but smooth and drinkable, a nice accompaniment for dinner, lively conversation, or a sports event on TV. This is a good party drink."
"without regret."
"Pours a pale yellow, what I would expect from a lager. Smells like skunk and hemp. Taste is refreshing, light, dry and maybe a little citrus. Lot's of carbonation. This is a mass produced eauro lager that I suppose one could drink all night with the intention of becoming totally inebriated, but trying to look more sophisticated than a guy doing the same thing with a bud light."
"A friend of mine kept raving about how great this beer was, so naturally I wanted to try it. He was nice enough to actually buy me one, and bring it over for me to try. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a clear straw, forming a thin 1/4 inch head, that left light lacing on the glass. The aroma is almost all skunky, with a hint of hop sweetness. I expected it to taste as bad as it smelled, but was suprised to find that it wasnt that bad. Very smooth clean hop flavor, with a good balance of malt thickness. Light mouthfeel. Aside from the smell, I could see having one or two of these in a session. Not as bad as I thought it would be. It reminds me of St. Pauli Girl. Once you get past the smell, its not a bad beer. Take a chance, and give it a shot."
"D: really pretty good! I like. It's more interesting I than other euro pale lagers I've had...I think."
"This one goes down with the best of them. I can through Stella Artois down 24/7/365 and not regret it."
"Poured from a bottle, it's a standard looking pale yellow lager. Plenty of carbonation. The nose is a mix of yeast, malt and grass. The flavor is where it all falls down though. It's like a mix of bad Grolsch and Heineken. It's predominantly watery bitter malt with a dry finish, but lacking the metallic astringency of Grolsch and with a particularly poor aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thin, but standard for the variety. Because the flavor is so bad, drinkability is quite low."
"D: I could drink a bunch but I don't think it's worth the extra $. Kind of boring actually."
"overall its an average beer but its not worth the high import cost that you pay for it."
"Very easy drinking,clean,refreshing,could drink a few of these,but would get bored after a while, not enough taste to keep me interested for a long time."
"drinkability is ok. not my cup of tea, and certainly not the best example of the style."
"I am not impressed with this one. I would rather have a Michelob Ultra than this. Just another fizzy Euro import."
"This beer is heavily marketed and readily available in this area. This is a very clear yellow lager with a half inch of white head. Not particularly lacey for a Belgian but predictable for a light (underscore light). The taste has a bit of malt but more of a fast light bitter flavor that finishes quick. On tap or bottle this beer is best served cold. For those looking for a light lager and a new label try it out. This isn't rocket science just a light beer that should appeal to those who don't like Dark, Belgians, IPA's well pretty much not many beers."
"I had heard that i had to try this beer a lot. When i finially bought a sixer of it and tried one i wasn't initially impressed. Maybe because i am inclined to dark beers, but the second beer seemed much better than the first. The taste grew on me. Finially came to the conclusion that this is a good beer, not a standby, but good none the less."
"the appearance of this beer is pale yellow w/about a half inch of head when pored into a mug... the smell is unimpressive w/a sort of ""flat"" smell... the taste isn't all bad- almost comparible to a light pilsner... mouthfeel is boring and the drikability... is crisp. the beer reminds me of something you might drink for a ""quick beer"" after working outside all day"
"I've had Stella before, but i gave it a more thorough tasting last night, as a friend had a 12 pack. It had the appearance of a pilsner, very light. A slight hoppy nose but nothing strong. The taste was that of a light lager, with a decent ammout of hops and a slight malt aftertaste. Pretty good, very drinkable, but nothing that stood out as spectacular."
"Though a relatively popular (or at least well-known) beer, this isn't very impressive. Tastes like a generic Euro lager that borders on tasting skunky. Average at best, but I find that the mouthfeel is rather annoying -- goes beyond tasting ""clean"" to tasting excessively dry."
"Overall, drinkability was nice. Again, I would reserve this for summer consumption on a blistering hot day, Stella Artois would quench a good beer thirst."
"Stella Artois is a light flavored lager similar to other imported styles. This reminded my of Heineken. The skunkiness on a beer that was suppose to be fresh until July of '07 was disappointing (damn green bottles). I'd be eager to try this on tap to see if it's any better."
"I don't know the inside workings of this company, but their marketing department seems to have put a full court press on New England. It is popping up all over the place. It sort of reminds me of ten years ago when Rolling Rock was doing the same thing. All the bars and restaurants started promoting the Geen Bottles. The difference is (at least to me) that Stella is a much better beer. It's perfect when you look down the line of taps and see macro after macro. So whatever, the reason, I'm glad stella is becoming readily available in the last two years. It pours a nice golden yellow. It's sweet and light. Ladies seem to like it more than other beers. It doesn't have the stigma of malternitives and light beers - it's just a good drinking beer. Nice smell, nice flavor - won't be blow you away - but is tasty and predictable. And it's good for sharing with friends."
"Not a bad beer, reminds of a light beer,though, not a heavy beer like other lagers. Light golden color. When i had it on tap, it had head and lace till the last drop. The bottle was some what the same. I would drink it again, if it was on sale, but not to get again. I bought the 12 pavk to share with another beer lover that hadn't try it."
"This is my first Stella Artois, came in a ""Beers of Belgium"" 18 pack (along with Leffe and Hoegaarden) from Sam's. Poured from a 11.2 oz green bottle into a pint glass with large bubbles that dissipates to a minimul head. The smell struck me at first as a typical ""Euro"" beer with a slight skunk smell. But after taking several more smells it leaves a sweet, malty, should I say, inviting, smell? The taste is malty, with a lingering, bitter hops, in the back. It also has a very faint banana, spice flavor?, I 'm not sure, taste something else that's hard for me to describe. This is just my second review, just learning how to take the time to truly taste a beer. The mouth feel is light, slightly carbonated. I could see myself drinking quite a few of these. This would be a great summer beer and one I may introduce to my BMC friends as a possible cross-over."
"A nice crisp lager. Nothing earth-shaking, but a nice beer, a good Euro-macro alternative to American macro, and would probably be acceptable to most American macro drinkers -- excepting those that can't handle actual hops at all."
"I despise most pils and lager, for me beer is about flavour and complexity, both which Stella Artois lacks undeniably. However due to its popularity, its a perfect carton to haul along to a party."
""
"D: This is where Stella shines because you can have this beer everyday and not get sick of it."
"I imagine you can drink multiple bottles/glasses but I don't know why you'd want to."
"Pours a golden yellow with lots of carbonation and a tight bubbled head that leaves a nice lace around the glass. Has maybe an aroma of vienna malt, perhaps pilsen? A nice hop aroma goes along to balance the malt flavors. An excellent example of a nice clean lager. Check out the website to see how to perfectly pour this lager."
"Mouthfeel is OK - not too thin and carbonation feels about right to me. This is not a bad beer, but I can't really fathom a reason to drink it in lieu of something else given the world full of better alternatives we have before us."
"One could drink this as a session beer but there are better choices."
"An above average example of the somewhat under appreciated Euro Pale Lager style. Definitely a couple of steps up from Heineken and featuring a cleaner malt character than Grolsch. Recommended."
"This is a drinkable beer, but an average one. It is a classic Euro lager, and would be good ice cold on a hot day. At $7 a six-pack I think it's over priced. I can get better beer for less, so I doubt I'll have this again."
"The pours is a light straw gold with a descent head that quickly fades into a light lace. Aroma was expected for this style; light and hoppy. The carbonation is long lasting and very crisp. The flavors balance was surprisingly good with a a nice sweet malt coupled with a bitter hops presence just strong enough to compliment the sweet. Mouthfeel was also as expected, however the long lasting crispness of the carbonation was a nice treat. Drinkability is very good due to the light, crisp combination of flavors and carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew that caught me a little off guard (on the positive side). Drink this one as cold as you can get it and it's very enjoyable."
"D: Really one of the least tasting European lagers out there. Its really like a Japanese domestic with a slight hop bite towards the end. For me, this is probably one of the most over rated beers in the world. I really don't know why people drink it."
"Poured this beer bottle into a glass mug. A nice, amber appearance with a decent white head with good retention. Smelled slightly bitter. Tasted very smooth with a slightly bitter aftertaste that was actually quite complimenting. A decent mouthfeel; a little bit more watery than what I was expecting. Overall a drinkable beer; I was able to drink this things all night long. Not too filling and the initial bitterness goes away once you get things going and it begins to taste a lot smoother (no, it's not due to being drunk because I didn't even approach buzzed at all tonight)."
"All in all; it's a nice average lager, with a slightly better than average taste. Good with a light meal, or something to drink at lunch when you have to go back to work."
"My girlfriend likes it which is weird cause she can down a Dead Guy in like ten minutes."
"Light-bodied, watery, fizzy. Nothing wrong with it, but also nothing to it. Drinkable but light and not fulfilling."
"Beautiful packaging for the bottle, too bad the insides doesn't live up. Pours a light golden color with a thick head. My initial reaction was to the strong hoppy smell but by the time I finished I couldn't tell it apart from an American macro-pilsner. Nice amount of carbonation, followed by a nice bitter hop flavor. The initial aftertaste is a sour citrus that is quickly replaced by a doughy, bready flavor. That taste lasts until the next sip. The flavor coated my entire mouth, which was annoying since it wasn't really that great of a taste. That said it's still a fairly easy to drink beer and is defiantly a huge improvement over some of the more common alternatives."
"Stella is an excellent lager, and I wished more were like it. It pours golden-yellow and its clean white head disapates quickly. A light malty smell and taste is very hoppy though with a nice malty sweetness. Good carbonation and it's very crisp and refreshing. Good drinkability, and when on tap I'll put away a few of these!"
"Drinakability-Pretty good. This one was bottled. I've had this beer on tap to. Even if you don't like the bottled version, try it on tap if you can find it. I'd rate the tap version a full point higher."
"Had this at dinner. Poured a dull pale fizzy yellow. White seltzer head which faded to nothing. No lace. Hardly a smell, I guess a light malt if anything. Taste was very bland, should have known that was coming. This is your typical Macro Lager. Will not have another."
"I've had this beer a couple of times, one at a nice little place here in DC and another at a rather strange place/time in up state New York. Both times this beer was constantly good. The color is about what you would expect out of a Euro Lager, light yellow with little depth in color. The head was nice, about a half an inch thick ( I like this for this style of beer personally) with a good about of lacing. I thought that the smell was decent, I didn't notice the ""Skunk"" smell a lot of the other reviews had written about, but maybe I just had a different experience. The taste was pleasant, nutty and rich, very smooth for a pale lager. The finish was clean and my palate ready for more. A good beer that can be enjoyed almost anytime of the year. Cheers!"
"This beer poured a light golden tone with a small head. The smell was fairly light with an aroma of malt and a bit of hops. The flavor had a light/medium body and a light/medium hop flavor and bitterness. I also had a nice very subtle malt aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel was lighter in consistency and had a medium carbonation. Overall, I felt that this beer was very crisp and clean. Although It's body was a bit lighter than I'm used to, it was still a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I would definately reccomend trying it."
"D-Not bad but I didnt remember it tasting like this.I'll have more but not anytime soon.Ima gonna have a couple more."
"Light golden color and mediocre white foamy cap. Floral hop esters, yeasty, sweet bread and little fruity in the nose. Crisp, descent bitterness, champagne like astringent. Mild sweetness but bigger in the finish along with some yeast, yet still relatively clean. Thin body and mouthfeel with some fizz. Honey sweetness and slight grape skin tannin arrive late. Good carbonation throughout."
"Note: Green bottles are stupid."
"This poured a very pale straw color with a moderate sized head. Good retention. Clean smell of grassy hops. The taste is about as average as average can get. Nothing bad at all but nothing exciting either. Very clean and pure with a bit of sweetness and a bit of hops but very ordinary. Goes down incredibly easily and you will have the whole thing done in a minute if you aren't careful. Not because of anything outstanding but because it's such an easy beer."
"It is very light in color. A golden straw color with a good deal of carbonation. It's very light in basically all areas: aroma, taste, body and appearance. I guess that's why Americans like it so. With the American macros, this stands a level above, as it does have some flavor qualities. It's aroma is grainy with a slight sweetness. Much true to for the taste. The water taste is particularly Belgian, but that's about it. It's drinkable, but nothing I would crave."
"I don't recommend this product for anything else other than when you're sampling various lagers. It costs too much to be as weak as it is in flavor, it's almost a stereotypical cheap beer with expensive packaging."
"Not my favorite. Taste is bland. Another light thirst-quencher: not offensive or special."
"I've had Stella in a bottle before and it was OK, but nothing to write home about (or write BA about). Then I tried it on tap and was a bit more impressed. Still not worthy of a session beer, but it went great with wings and crab dip at our celebration (congratulations pilot N!). Color was wan yellow in the glass with a nice pillowy head. Lost a lot of carbonation in the pouring process (vis-a-vis the bottle version), but that improved it, IMHO. A bit of skunky hops in the smell and the same in the taste, which was a bit of a put-off for me. Rather thin mouthful, but sweetness and bitterness in perfect balance for food. I'd try it again with a meal."
"Den"
"On tap. Clear with medium head that fell fast. Light color. Strong aroma of noble hops and a distinct hops bite on the first sip. Refreshing, almost sour from the hops kick. Technical perfection, but no soul. Perhaps the keg was getting old, but the hops aroma was almost oxidized and was almost too much for such a light lager."
" Don't get me wrong, it's better than American macros, but there are so many better beers to come out of that country. I have not tried any other Stella beers, but I would like to, since this one seems to be aimed at the same blokes that make Bud the most popular beer in the world, and I know they can do better."
"D- Very easy, thirst quenching."
"D: It's a mild, inoffensive beer in a mild, inoffensive style. But it's not terrible, and it has more to recommend it than BMC. On the one hand, this beer is built so that you can drink a ton of them. On the other hand, it's not the kind of beer that draws you in and actually makes you DESIRE to have more than one or two. It's sweet, it's mild, and it's a ""last resort"" beer for me when I'm at a restaurant. But it's solid, and doesn't make me want to start a ""you'll never believe what I had to drink"" thread in the forums."
"Good Beer. Definitely worth a try. Most uniuqe thing about it is, according to my waitress, was that when been served in a glass, it has to be served in a special Stella Artois glass, with a gold rim. Not sure if the brewery is requiring the shape of the glass for the tasting or what. I am still a rookie at beer tasting."
"pours a two finger white head with nice lacing to the finish. nice clear light gold color. smell is fresh but not much else distinguishable there. taste has a ginger grain alochol slight hop after taste. mouthfeel light clean crisp dry. drinkability is good its something i would not buy all the time though good for a change of pace."
"This beer was sampled after allmost a month at sea, where there was no beer available. So for quenching my thirst and a ""COLD BEER"" it served it's purpose. Overall it tastes like most of the other ""EURO"" Lagers. Would I buy it upon my return to the states, probably not."
"Pours a crystal clear pale golden straw color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly vanishes. Nose is herbal hops with a bit of grain. Taste has some grassy notes and dry grains along with some mildly spicy hops towards the end. Fizzy mouthfeel. Decent lawn mowing beer, nothing more."
"Crisp, cool, a bit overcarbonated. Not a bad light beer. Can't even taste the 5.2 ABV."
"Drank very easy, wouldn't want to stay on it all day, but could if that was the best beer on offer. Nothing too exotic here just a real quaffable lager"
"Nothing to special about this lager, Mouthfeel high carbonation kinda gets in the way of the weak flavor of this beer. The beer goes down super smooth and is very easy to drink. However, I wouldn't want to drink this all night just because I know that there's better out there. However, I do believe that this beer would work wonders as a crossover beer."
"Definitely prefer these from the tap thought Im a fan of the bottle."
"Overall, just some average European pale lager, nothing special here."
"As with any beer, the draft tastes better then the bottle, but that also depends on where you got it from."
"This is a classic, boring lager. No significant flavor other than some bitterness."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The slick, rolling carbonation in the mouth feels just right, it certainly works with food. This beer has the unique character of being light-bodied yet very satisfying, and drinkability is excellent. Much to my surprise, this beer definitely has its place on a hot day."
"Overall one of the better tasting Euro Pales but its a mediocre beer compared to the rest of the beer world."
"Poured a pale straw colour, fizziness abound, with what could best be described as a white foamy scum on the top, consisting of large bubbles, and a smell, which hits you on pouring. Rancid, wet cardboard, slightly sweaty, with a corn character, which is probably chemical in origin for all I know. The sweet taste had a nasty kind of bitter finish, which clings to the palate for dear life. I noticed a taste of alcohol, even though it's only 5.4%. A fizzy watery concoction which, if it was stronger, could qualify for tramp juice. I think the advertising owes a lot to the success of this abomination in these here parts, making it seem more sophisticated than it is. That said, if you just want to get trashed after a rubbish week in work, then this is the poison to do it with, although if you enjoy good beer, have a curry with it to overpower the taste."
"It is highly drinkable, though must be consumed cold. It's solid for the style."
"Didnt think much of this. Even less because I let it warm as I drank it. That is fine for Belgians, stouts and barleywines, but this beer needs to be drank ice cold. The beginning aroma and flavor were not much, and they got worse as it warmed. Finish was similar to drinking a BMC, dry with a bitter after-taste. I could have these at a party, if free and cold, but doubt Ill be spending money on this again."
"Light body with a wet, watery mouthfeel...it's easy to consume and is quite refreshing. I think it's much easier to drink than American Macro's and is a good example of it's style."
"Stella Artois is your typical St Pauli Girl type lager. These Euro Lagers are all morphing into the same blah, boring category. While not offensive, and quite drinkable, Stella isn't worth the premium price."
"I'll likely be stocking my fridge with this in the future."
"Poured into a Stella Artois glass. Pours a pale golden yellow with a thin head that turns into sporadic lace. Typical dry and clean lager aroma with sweet grain and grassy hops. Taste is a bit spicy and earthy with a decent touch of hops. Not too bad. Overall, this is a decent lager but not worth the premium price tag."
"Pours pale yellow with white head that dissipates quickly, leaving a few random spots of foam floating there. Smells like adjucts (corn, rice?) Not much flavor, maybe a little hop bitterness, tastes like any other euro lager. The mouth feel, while thin, is more present then I would expect. This beer isn't really much different then Heineken or any other ""euro lager"" I wouldn't reccomend this one."
" I'm not a big fan of Euro Pale Lagers, but this I found less offensive than say a Heineken."
"Overall i think the taste isnt really anything great, but with the mouthfeel, it gives this beer a very drinkable aspect. I think without the mouthfeel, this beer would be kinda forgetable. But it beats the crap outta heineken and all the likes. As far as Belgium's stardards, this sucks (i think most of us will agree)."
"Although marketed as a premium beer I saw on their web site that they use corn and rice as adjuncts. Likely in very small amounts but that puts this beer on the macrobrew class. Not a bad beer, just a decent macrobrew. I prefer Heinenken or Grolsch for a Pale Euro lager big time."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a small but persistent head. The smell was faint but slightly hoppy. It has a mild taste that isnt outstanding or offensive. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a carbonation bite. This is a nice beer that I would definitely consider when in the mood for a pale lager."
"Stella has always been my favorite lager without going into the ambers, and Viennas, and blah blah blah. This beer is sweet and easy to drink, and I like that. Poured into the Stella Artois Chalice and actually looks damn good inside it for how yellow it looks. Champagne-esque with a respectably flowing white head that youre supposed to ""cut"" with the provided Stella Artois bar-knife (they are really reaching for image here). Bottle and carriage has always been eye catching to me with the classy white. Smell is average, lots of malt and very floral. Thats where the taste comes in. Sweet and floral with no offensiveness. The perfectly crafted lager in my opinion. The sweetness is just amazing for a mass produced beer. Have one of these after a Pilsner Urquell and its heaven. The mouthfeel is slightly above average, lots of bubbles, and brings up the champagne reference again. Drinkability is damn good, like I've been saying, definitely my favorite lager, albeit too expensive sometimes and they screw you with that little 11.2 oz bottle. Oh well, highly recommend."
"M- Strong carbonation and watery. Overall a pretty bland beer.To watery among other problems."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker by far. Seems though not worth it at all. It's just such a bland beer really. I think it might be a good beer for someone to be introduced to beer with."
"Stella Artois is rather mediocre, but its certainly superior to Bud/Miller/Coors, and for the beer drinker who is trying to get away from those, its a step up. Ill likely not buy it again, but I did get a cool glass so Im not going to whine. Bottom line: Stella Artois is not offensive, but its not my beer either."
"Picked up a 6 pack of this because I wanted something different. Poured a simple pale yellow colour with ample head (may have been a bit warm from the ride home.) Initial Euro-Lager smell gave way to sweet malt and hops. Taste was... well pretty darn good. Good sweet malt taste with a floral finish no real bitterness detected. I think I would buy this beer again as it is pretty good for the price."
"I had this beer on a night when a buddy of mine and I were trying what was new on tap in Carbondale, Illinois. I had about 3 or 4 beers prior to this one and was on the road to having a pretty decent night. Then I ordered a Stella at Buffalo Wild Wings. It looked like a standard lager, and smelled about standard but when it hit my tongue it tasted unpleasantly skunky. Keep in mind, this was on tap; otherwise, I would just have written it off as some bottles left in the sun. I let my buddy take a sip (he's a bigger beer advocate than me) and he quickly passed it back over, making note of its unpleasant flavor. Kind of like a uber-skunky Heineken, I suppose. The worst part about the flavor is that it seemed to intensify in the aftertaste. Ugh. I didn't even finish it. I had about two more beers after that and could never seem to get rid of that awful taste on my tongue. Later that night, I awoke from my sleep to rush to the toilet, (something I haven't done since having way too many mixed drinks on New Years Eve) to purge my system of the awful stuff. Needless to say, I definately don't get the hype surrounding this awful lager... stay away from it. Stay far, far away..."
"This is a beer that has become available in my local area very recently, and it seems to have a big following nationwide. That in itself leads one to assume the beer's mildness of flavor is behind its popularity since the general beer drinking public considers it palatable. Don't get me started on the sales of the urine sample labeled Bud light. That being said, fellow BAs seemed to have ripped Stella a new one(Stanley Kowalski not withstanding). I prefer porters, stouts and ales in general, but have tried to review this lager with the reference of the beer style in mind. It is very mild across the board. It has a mild hoppy finish and is very easy drinking, especially when it's hot outside. I had several while visiting my brother in Charleston SC, and it was hot as hell. I would consider this an upgrade from most macrobrewed domestics with the exception of Yuengling. Look for big beer taste elsewhere, but when a lake trip requires a better than U.S macro talk to Stella. Unlike many of my brethren BAs I enjoy a walk on the mild side occasionally and Stella certainly fit the bill."
"Poured into a stella glass, pale yellow with a nice 3/4 - 1 inch head which lasted a short while and left some nice lacing. The smell was nothing special, typical lager maltiness, with nothing else really discernable, to me anyway. Taste was average as well, started off sweet & malty and ended with a slight hint of hops, nothing special, but nowhere near disgusting. However, it goes down very smooth and is light bodied and very refreshing, something i could drink a lot of given the right conditions. I found the carbination to be just right, and what it lacks in complex flavours i think it makes up in mouthfeel and drinkability. I know this beer gets a bad rap for being overrated, but as far as i'm concerned it's one of the better popular lagers out there."
"I'll have to try some bottles..."
"I still cannot figure out what style of beer this is or is trying to be. Is it a belgian blonde? No..er, let's hope not. A belgian lager..what is that anyway? This is one of the 10 worst beers ever. No head whatsoever, no lacing. Barely any taste except some foul skunky aftertaste. Just the way it smells is appalling. Very skunky. No sugary belgian candies...nothing. I've had this a couple times, but this is finally the last time."
"D - Although it looks good and feels good, thi is just another beer to chuck into the ""drink these on a warm day"" bin that contains all of the other low-taste mass-market Euro-pale lagers. Can you drink a few of these at a backyard BBQ? Absolutely. But only if there were no other craft-brew options available."
"O - Tastes like Heineken to me. Bland and boring, maybe it's good fresh from the source."
"This stuff is just very run of the mill. Light in appearance, flavor and body. Watered down. Full of corn. It did have a decent head but it evaporated quickly. Highly carbonated and fizzy. I don't know, seems like somebody wanted to import a beer, any beer, and make some dough. I wouldn't buy this product again. It is better than Heine Light, Beck's Light and all the Mich's. Other than that...PASS..."
"Well-balanced beer. One of the best European Macro-Lagers."
"It has a clear golden yellow color with lots of bubbles and little head. It smelled of corn. There was also a faint skunky smell which seems typical of most green bottled European brews. The corn flavor comes out as you drink it. I also noted a vanilla-like taste, as well. It had a crisp mouthfeel and was quite drinkable. I would've had more but I only had one on hand."
"Eh. I usually drink them in the bottle and I think it surpresses the worst flavors, this is not the beer you want to probe deeply for nuances. Way expensive considering its lackluster qualities."
"I had heard of this beer through new ads in magazine's and television, did not know it existed, especially since 1366, as marked on the bottle, purchased a six pack, poured into frosty cold pint glass, tasted almost the same as Heineken, same body and smell. average, but very drinkable, a good hot weather outdoor pilsner, would buy again."
"This beer looks like a classic pilsner with a head that is very thin but hangs on for the long haul. It gives a musty bread and soap aroma. The taste is a light bodied cracker-tasting malt base and opening lemon-lime sensations have light berry notes that grow to an overall impression of a mouthfull of cheap gummy bears before they are all drowned in a forcefull metallic bitter. In other words, this shit is funky. It has none of the clean, crisp characteristics I look for in this style. I syrupy mouthfeel with stingy carbonation don't help matters, but this is a refreshing brew inspite of itself."
"a perfect example of a lager style beer. the only thing i don't like about this beer is the price ($8.50 a sixer). this beer could only be improved if it where to be made right in minnesota in a brewpub run by german brewmasters.it has the right color the right mouth feel and smells of hops and grains. very fresh. the flavor is brought out to its peak if you let it slightly warm out of the fridge to about 45 0r 50 degrees."
"Drinkability: drinkable....but that skunked thing hurts it"
"D: I'd never buy it."
"The body is surprisingly big for a pale lager. Not bad. I would drink more, but there are much more interesting beers on the lighter end of the spectrum. Glad I was finally able to at least try it after having worked at a beer store for over a year that had almost every belgian beer imaginable but Stella, which was the only thing anybody ever wanted aside from Hoegaarden."
"Decent brew. Similiar to Heineken, nothing to write home about as far as smell is concerned -- kind of bitter. Appearance is OK -- a typical amber color. Taste is pretty basic. Nothing really jumps out about this beer. It goes down smooth and I enjoyed having it with a chicken sandwich/french fries dinner at the local Chili's, but this didn't bowl me over."
"Overall: A nice brew, maybe not quite the cleanest out there, but the aroma keeps me enticed throughout the whole experience. It stands apart from other beers I have tried in the Euro Pale Lager category."
"A fine and refreshing brew, but nothing extraordinary."
"Overall - A very average beer... Quite drinkable though..."
"D - Not bad, but certainly one-dimensional (well maybe 2 dimensional) without much complexity, and strangely not particularly refreshing. Nothing special anyway."
"I would drink this any day of the week and will be sure to pick up a sixer in the store."
"This is a mediocre beer, at best. Pours out to a light yellow color with a thin head of white foam. Medium level of carbonation and some trace of lace. Aroma is grassy, with a touch of floral hops. Taste? Bland. Watery hops leave a dry note in the mouth, along with a touch of bite from the hops and a sharp grass note toward the finish. Mouthfeel was ok, but a touch more carbonation would've been grand. Drinkability is average at best. This isn't a bad beer, but to call it a Belgian seems like travisty compared to other Belgian products."
"I remember having this on tap several times awhile back and the slight skunky metallic taste was not present. Still average to slightly above average Euro lager."
"drinkablility: nice..nothing really super, but a descent food beer."
"Stella Artois pours a pale yellow with a fluffy white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is standard Euro lager skunky hop profile. The taste also reflects the same skunky hop profile. Not particularly good to my taste. There's cheaper and better alternatives to this. Not recommended."
"Drinkability- wow I started to drink this beer and was suprised only 5 minutes had passed and I was ready to pour another"
"D- This beer is pretty bland with the exceptions of fizz and hop extract, and there isn't really any balance or support from other good flavors. It wasn't skunky although I could see this happening with the green bottles pretty quickly."
"Drinkability: good, but not extreme, considering the bitterness."
"Sessionable, no doubt, but very boring to me."
"Taste is also quite malty off the bat, but balanced with a surprisingly strong hop presence. Refreshingly bitter. This is way better beer from the tap and the can than from a skunky bottle. I am almost impressed. This is a slightly better-than-average Euro-Lager. A good summer refresher."
"Bottle left by some dinner guests. Best before 06 2006 (L 16759 x). Pours a 1.5 finger white head that's got a yellow dusting. The beer is crystal clear and light bright straw in color. Smells pils malty with hops that have a hallertauer honey and a hint of saaz tin. Tastes flat malt with prominent hops that rise, turn earthy, and persist into the aftertaste. Malt sweet stands tall upon the draw, but falls away. By the aftertaste it's just a hint, but does contribute to a wet quality in the aftertaste that I find redeeming. Hops are earthy and tin-like, suggesting Saaz hops. Very aromatic floral. Md body (which I was surprised about) and a bit too carbonated for my preferences. Despite the green bottle, this beer was not skunked. Also, there is still a clingy layer of head on this beer that's left some pretty amazing lacing on the inside of the glass. Euro Pale Lager is not a style I'm very familiar with, but, according to the BA style description, this beer fits pretty damn well. The malt is grainy and clean of fruity esters. The hop character is both noble and noticable. It is light and simple. Well done, IMO."
"Clear medium straw color with a one finger white cap that dissipated quickly to light lacings. Floral sweetness, citrus hops, and a little spice on nose. Clean aroma with light bouquet. Flavor is just as the aroma with floral sweetness, light citrus hops with a little bit of clove and pepper. Very drinkable medium-high carbonation. Finishes with a dry grapefruit bitterness. Great beer to start the night off with."
"Poured a fairly clear, golden color with good head. The smell was almost non-existent, maybe some apples mixed in with a little malt. The taste was especially sweet, with some (but not many) hops showing through at the end. Overall, this beer seemed fairly thin and had too much carbonation. It makes for a decent complement to dinner, but there are a lot more interesting choices out there."
"Really, almost a drainpour. Gimme a Grolsch or a Beck's anyday."
"from the bottle. poured a yellow with a small white head that left no lacing which would have been hard to do in the plastic cup I was given to drink from.. aroma malt grainy, wheat, with some hops at the finish. flavor, malt. sugar, some of the hops popped up nicely. this did go well with the cedar plank roasted salmon I was having for dinner last night."
"the beer remonds me of a souped up canadian lager."
"D - Stella isn't much to drink. It has a poor flavor and smell. It really is not even worth drinking. I guess that stella is bland enough to wash down food. Sessionable, but not by choice."
"Overall: These are somewhat dangerous. As clean and balanced as these are it's easy to polish off several before you've realized what happened. And it's not because there's no flavor - that's there."
"Drinkability was good with my dinner pairing. At the same restaurant I would consider this depending on the plate ordered, but on it's own merits I won't be adding this to my must purchase list."
"I always thought, whenever my wife drank this beer, that it was sort of Belgian Corona. It's really not that bad. It was a pale yellow color with a thin head that dissipated quickly. It had a nice fresh, outdoors odor and a sweet/grainy taste with a little tiny bit of hoppiness. Neutral feeling in my mouth, and an OK beer to drink."
"Mouthfeel is sharp - more carbonated than I expected. Light, but the nice bitterness and carbonation make Stella a potential session beer, if nothing else as an alternative to an AML. Good middle-of-the-road example of the style."
"Had this one on tap at a local steak house - Sanibel Steakhouse. Poured a clear golden color with clean white head. Smell of clean malts and slight hops. Taste was light and slighty sweet , some sort of fruityness , also clean with a bit of hop bitterness in the end. Crisp mouthfeel. Found it to be pretty drinkable."
"The smell of lager. I can smell the fermented barely right out of the bottle. Slight skunk smell, but I like that. Great head in the boot mug. Bright yellow color. Nice lacing. Classic lager taste a little bit sweeter than most. Carbonation is just right. Smooth on introduction, steady throughout and a sweet, only very slightly bitter, dry finish. Dranken well chilled this is a great thirst quencher. After some very flavorful starter beers this can be a good sessioner. This beer seeems to building a snob appeal, not necessarily founded, but quite drinkable."
"Drink it cold, it hides some of the unfavorable tastes."
"Nothing special. Definitely not the high-class beer Stella's marketing dept. would like you to believe it is."
"Not bad, but can really use a more full bodied taste. It improves as it gets warmer, but I still don't think this one's for me."
"I hate when I read so many reviews of European macros and everyone says ""I remember it being better", but in this case I really do remember this being better. I haven't had it in awhile, and I guess you could chalk it up to bad tap conditions, so I'l have to try it again sometime to add to the review."
"Yellow-orange body, thick white head dissipates quickly. Sweet aroma, little grass or corn flavor. Slight astringent quality to flavor, sweet yeast and pleasant taste. Thick mouthfeel; more like a Belgian than a lager. Good carbonation. Pretty drinkable -- my favorite of the style."
"This beer also backs up my dislike of any Euro lager in glass. I often drink Beck's cans in the summer - but cannot drink them out of the bottle. Ditto for Heineken."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Pours out to a light yellow with a small head that subsides very quickly. The smell is very faint, and I can hardly sense the beer at all. The taste is also quite bland. Reminds me of a stale Heineken. The beer is a bit thin, but not as bad as some other beers I've had. In all, this is very drinkable because it's so light. However, I think this will be the last time I get this beer."
" I don't mind a malty beer if it gets me full and has a nice solid backbone to it. Unfortunately, this just doesn't have it. At some bars I go to, this is (sadly) the best I can find on tap, and it used to be my backup beer along with Yuengling or Sam Adams Boston Lager. Those two have not fallen as far down as this has now that my tastes have changed and gotten better. It was worth having one last time to sample, but I don't see myself ordering Stella for a looong time, even if I finally get to watching A Streetcar Named Desire on DVD."
"Not very impressed with the brew myself would see me picking out a lot over this one."
"Pours a very clean golden straw color topped by a white lace head. Floral notes are present in the nose along with bits of hops and smells grains. Taste seems to be a typical lager. Clean, crisp with bits of vague spicy noble hops. Grainy tastes hit the tongue. Very dry finish on the palate with a sweetness. Nothing special in this beer but I still enjoy it when I can."
"Pours a very clear straw, with a soapy one and a half finger head. Poor retention but it produces good sticky lacing. Nose is a combination of light-struck and pure noble hops, very little malt aroma. Semi-sweet pilsener malt, dominated in the aftertaste by the aforementioned skunky and spicy hops. Balance is okay, the off-flavor does not ruin the finish, but the drinkability is not very high either. the mouthfeel is light bodied and well-carbonated; but would be better if not for tainted flavor. Not exactly harsh; but the defect in taste prevents it from being the smooth session lager that it was intended to be. The first belgian import I've tried that has managed to dissapoint."
"Pours transparent yellow with a small foamy white head that quickly devolves to a film and lacing. Smells husky and grainy; sweet stewed corn and vegetables on a soured metallic base. Thin, bubbly body with no distinguishing characteristics. Sweet grainy corn and vegetables on the tongue, a touch of metallic dryness in the finish. No complexity, interest, or after-taste to speak of."
"On tap at the local pub. Pours a light golden color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is light and very grainy with notes of some German-type hops. Interesting. The flavor doesn't really do much for me. Very grainy with some hop character. Very run-of the mill Euro Lager. Slighty skunky. Light body. Nothing special."
"I can't find it in me to summon up Stanley's passionate angst about Stella (the beer), either in terms of favor or disfavor. Other than its surprisingly good looks, I find it to be average in the extreme. No fireworks and no duds here, just another boring, forgettable Euro pale lager."
"For a lager this is very drinkable brew. The straw pale color is quite transparent; the head is light a fluffy. The aroma is quite weak, not much to describe. The flavor is a little hoppy up front and balanced overall. The body is about right on for the style (on the light side). The lightness to this brew makes it a session beer."
"D = average."
"Bham UK"
"This is better than most of the pale lagers that you will come across. Having that said, it is not great. It is not bad either. It can run a little more expensive than American lagers, but the extra half dollar is worth the flavor."
"Pours a clear golden color with a small head that dissipates and leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is slightly floral. Taste has some fruit tastes in it, very clean and crisp. Mouthfeel is thin with a decent amount of carbonation. Pretty drinkable, better than an average macro, nothing to get excited about. One more note, I didn't find this beer to be as bad as some other people and it's a decent beer, but not necessarily worth the price."
"While there isn't anything special about this beer, it is a very nice, clean and inoffensive mass produced lager. Unfortunately, it does lack character and body which lumps it in with alot of other lagers."
"I must say this beer needs a renovation because as it stands, Grolsch, Beck's is much better tasting (I just did a 3 way comparison)"
"D - OK drinkability. Definitely a thirst quencher. I prefer this on-tap much better than out of the bottle."
"Generic and boring. I was able to drink it with food, but wouldn't be able to otherwise."
" I guess I've just matured past this beer tastewise. It's a drinkable lager in a bar with your buddies but not really special in any way but reputation."
"The aroma of this ale is not bad, but very simple and weak. A hint of hops, a hint of doughy yeast. The taste has no complexity. Again, not horrible, but very simple. A bit of the yeast flavor, perhaps a hint of spice? No real body. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and very carbonated. Extremely drinkable, though, if you need something light."
"Poured a clear gold color. Not much of a head but there was a significant amount of carbonation in the glass. Nose was mild and just a tad of hops was noticeable. Flavor was floral and surprisinly tartly/bitterly hoppy. Malts were mild and sweet. Bit of a metallic taste too. Crisp feel but a tad watery. An easy drinking lighter beer for those longer nights."
"D: Pretty easy to drink, a pretty nice alternative to some of the domestice macros but nothing really special to write home about."
"A very nice lager. Easy to drink for any occasion."
"D: simplistic and boring--it's not the worst lager for sure, but tastes quite different from what I occasionally had on tap in Leuven when living there last year (though that one was only fresh and average-quality malty lager at best)."
"a less bitter version of Grolsch, but very drinkable. it surprised me, nonetheless."
"This beer tastes the best on tap."
"Pours a very light yellow, with a white head that quickly fades. Smells hoppy, grainy, and a little bitter. A little sweet to the taste at first, but finishes very grainy and a little bitter. Feels fizzy in the mouth, with medium carbonation. Fairly drinkable, but nothing special."
"Enjoyed at my favorite pizza pub. A very clean and well brewed beer. Aromas are big on the noble / Euro hops for an earthy and spicy mix. Good pisner / biscuit malts shows yeasty and bready character. Looks a medium yellow with medium carbonation. A good head that lingerred and laced nicely. Flavors are lightly malty and picks up on a bit of grain, bread, vegetals, and red apples. Light hop spices and solid hop bittering closes out the complexity. Has a light to medium weight on the toung with a full, almost creamy texture. Finishes lightly dry and a bit minty. A very good beer for style. It stands up nicely to my favorite Bohemian Pilsners."
"The light carbonation gave a very uninspiring mouthfeel. Actually, overall the beer was uninspiring. I just couldn't get excited in a good or bad way about this beer. Just neutral. This is not a good quality to have."
"The aftertaste is slightly dry and bitter and doesnt complement the original taste to well. A good Belgium macro, worth trying!"
"Cheers."
"Overall, if it wasn't for the fact this was a free beer bought for a Friday afternoon 'meeting' at the office, I probably wouldn't be drinking this right now..."
"D = Average."
"A nice golden color,but the head,one finger,is a little small.The smell is a little fruity with some hops,but nothing great.The taste is very hoppy,but with nothing else,kind of boring.The m/f is pretty good and full,not watery like I expected.This isn't a bad lager,I can see having this on a hot summer day,but there are already a whole bunch of this type on the market."
"This beer is very pedestrian and predictable. Skunky and unsatisfying. I could not identify any flavor in this beer except overwhelming acidic skunk. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..."
"While the Stella Artois lacks some of the artistic attributes of many of the great beers listed in the BA, it is a good lager worthy of drinking in large amounts in the company of good friends."
"Had had this brew at macgregors. Bob warned me that it tastes like soapy dishwater. And it does. I guess it is one of those status beers like corona. People think they are the shit drinking this nasty shit because it is expensive yet they know nothing about good beer. This pours a very clear pale yellow with a creamy white head that does not last. The smell and taste is hoppy but not good hoppy. It smells like chemical ass. The taste is similar. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Well I had this because it was 2.75 for 20 ounces(the new november specials) but damn this is not close to being drinkable."
"One of the better beers in te world, this belgian drink, rich in corn and hops; not like the american beers based in rice and corn formula; is special; its smell like hops flower, and corn starch; very floral, like green leaves; generous alcohol content;taste robust and total; try with american and german food; serve in a pint glass; 95% recommended."
"Tried this offering on tap at a local bar. It was served in an enormous-sized growler. A golden not-quite-copper color with a tall, thick white head. The nose is malty. It tastes somewhat sweet and malty, and I notice hints of fruit here and there. Not great tasting, but definitly better than the miller lite or busch that I could have had instead. The mouthfeel was moderate to maybe medium bodied at best. The drinkablility was fine. It was an okay beer, but lacked anything exciting. I would drink it again, but I wont fiend for it."
"Overall, another average lager, though much better than your typical macro."
"Pours a golden but light straw colour with a fluffy light head with decent lacing. Saaz are slightly noticable on the nose and give a flowery smell on top of the malty sweetness. Taste is clean and crisp with good balance. Tastes extremely sweet to me, and bit of a dry hoppy aftertaste exists. Nothing stand-outish about the beer, but nothing bad about it, either. A good summer beer."
"poured a pale amber color with monstrous white puffy head that proved to be long-lasting. Smell is very minimal, maybe a hint of sweet maltiness. Taste is sweetish with some herbal and citrus notes (lemon), Very refreshing and crisp. A bit of dryness is also present. Finishes crisp and dry. A very nice all around beer. Nothing super, but good and thirst quenching."
"I finally decided to give this try after watching a friend of mine buy a six pack of it every 4 days. I found it to be a rather mediocre beer but enjoyable as a session beer and affordable. It poured a tan yellowish color with a little white lace that stuck to the glass left adn right. It smelled of musky and like hops reminscent of cannabis. It tasted very light-bodied and with an initial hop bitterness that takes a little time to get used to. Overall a very average beer."
"Drinkability: There are much better Belgians out there than this. Maybe it's the Euro Pale Lager style? This may be the first one I've had, but from the looks of it the style doesn't seem like it's one people would want to drink all the time. Either way, it's worth trying, but there are better and tastier beers out there to try, especially from Belgium."
"Pours a medium yellow with a 1 finger head and pretty good lace. Sweet malt and a bit skunky in the smell. Not bad for a macro Euro lager. Its not as sweet as your typical abd it leaves a nice hop bitterness mixed with a mellow malt aftertaste. Not a bad beer in the style."
"This used to be something great, eh? Not no more, it ain't."
"Better than BMC but not by much. Tastes better on tap."
"My pint had minimal foam with little lacing. I smell a sharpness that I can't really put my finger on. It's a bit unusual and rather potent, but not in a bad way. My first few sips are tasty and smooth, however, soon after my mouth begins to feel overly dry. The bitterness of this beer develops over time and is mostly held in the aftertaste. Despite it's lack of complexity, it's a decent beer with a refreshing characteristic making it worthy of having a few."
"Opinion: Well, I think that this is a nice beer overall. It is more of a light German Pilsner than something I would think came from Belgium. There is a really crisp flavor, with some subtle flavors rather than the lemony/citrusy stuff we all love so much from that country. I would drink this beer over quite a few others, but I would pick up just about any German pils over this one though."
"As soon as I cracked one open, the whiff of skunk and alcohol dominated the immediate area. Pours light amber, basically piss colored. Short fluffy head, no retention. Nose is skunky, not much else in there. Light flavor mainly consisting of some bitterness and skunk. Altogether, was not impressed. I think it would be better on tap, though. I'd also rather drink this than light American crap (i.e. Miller)."
"There's a huge, white fluffy head over a very clear, very pale, straw-colored beer. Spoonk out the wazoo in the nose. A little sugar, a little corn. Bitter spoonk up front with a little burnt toast. Sweet, corny and quite malty in the middle. Sweet spoonk! at the end. Some tangy fruit, quite crisply bitter. Not bad. Major spoonky euro-lager plus sweet corn and sharp, crips bitterness."
"Bah."
"Stella pours a pale golden color. She has lots of fizz and bubbles. Thin head remains on top throughout the tasting. Smells of corn and spice. The smell of spice leaves one hoping a similar taste will follow. But alas, it does not. The taste delivers a harsh, unbalanced hoppy flavor with a slight taste of corn. Some hint of a chemical like flavor comes through. The aftertaste is very bad and leads one to almost grimace. You need to eat something with this brew to mask the flavors."
"This is a relatively new addition to the Texas beer market so its still a novelty around here, but its one that I drank from time to time in Canada. Its not a bad beer and I'll certainly drink it before any of the domestic macros, but its nothing spectacular. I find it to be mildly refreshing at best."
"I don't remember getting the same caramel/packaged-snack-food aroma from the tap version of this beer. It takes place after the hyper activated, mildly skunky hop extrakt flourish runs its course -- from obvious upon opening the cap, to hardly detectible as the beer sits in a tumbler. Roasted, dry sugar flavors are met with assertive, nutty bitterness. The ""brown"" flavors, nuts and caramel, don't seem to match the slick, light and temporary texture. It's like an ordinary lager with caramel flavoring added. There are hundreds better. Confected."
"I figured I'd give this beer a try, maybe find a nice lager to drink a few of but unfortunately this was no it. It came in its own glass and I was at a bar that didn't serve appropriate glassware for anything else. Nice foamy white head, lots of bubbles, good lacing. Pale yellowish color. Aroma is nearly nothing. I get some barley but that's it. Flavor is weak as piss too. Very watery with just a bit of sweetness. Somewhat crisp finish. I had a pbr after this and it was a lot better."
"I think this was an average beer with average drinkability."
"Pours a dark golden yellow with a finger of lasting foamy head. Smell is pretty muted---some pale malt and maybe a whiff of hops. Taste is lackluster---husky malt with an off DMS flavor, a fairly large dose of grassy hops, with a mildly unpleasant skunk-like aftertaste. Light body with a very crisp carbonation, this is an easy enough drinker on a hot day, but overall is an overpriced import not worth buying."
"It's a drinkable brew, but nothing that leaves you satisfied. Eh, I hope it's a fad."
"Yellow color with almost no head. Fizzy beer. Very light malt smell but nothing that is very noticable. Taste is blah too, maybe the slightest bit of spicyness but that could be wishfull thinking. I can't imagine anyone really thinking that this is a good beer. Not enough taste or body to even warrant being called beer. Fancy name, expensive image but nothing to back it up. Glad i didn't pay for this one."
"Stella Artois is many people's standard of strong lager on draught. It has been well advertised for years and has a slightly up-market image compared to many other lagers, maybe it's that Reassuringly Expensive thing. Stella Artois is a strong lager and has 6.5 alcohol content. The taste and is sharp and crisp. The foam stayed on top until I finished drinking the beer."
"Went down smooth and suprisingly easy to drink. The 12 I had were gone pretty quick."
"Easy to drink for sure, but the hype doesn't justify everyone drinking it. Belgium has so much more to offer, but I'm glad to see people drinking this instead of Bud."
"This was among the ""premium beers"" offered at a trendy nightclub. Served in a bottle that was nearly frozen. Even then, I must admit, there was a pleasant little hoppiness that even made itself felt through the cold. And there is something of a malt profile, perhaps like a watered down Duvel. Still, its a beer thats trying to be the Belgian Heineken. And we need more beers that are ""Belgian"" and fewer that want to be Heinekens."
"Appearance is a cloudy pale yellow, with a very white foamy head that descends nicely into lace. Aroma is crisp and grainy, with some sweet malt. Initial taste is malty and then reveals bitter hops, leaving a dry memory of cooked broccoli. My local Old Chicago Pizza lists this as a pilsner but it is a lager."
"I wasn't particularly interested in reviewing this, but it was cheap, on tap, and I hadn't tried it, so what the hell. Pours a light gold with a fizzy, weak head. Funky hop aroma. Herbal hop bitterness up front, with a little bit of malt to help balance. Dry, bitter finish. Weird, slick, metallic mouthfeel doesn't help things. A decent representation of the style, it just happens to be a style that I don't care for at all. Average when fresh and on tap, I imagine that this would be pretty lousy in the bottle."
"Recommended by a friend at work who loves this beer! Lighter in color than I thought it would be. Taste was good,but didnt blow me away. Went down smooth. This beer is 7.99 a six pack! I would be more likely to drink it on a regular basis if it was less expensive. Nevertheless, I recommend giving it a try."
"Taste is better being moderate bitter, green and hoppy but again butter and oxidation good noticeable. Carbonisation and mouthfeel are OK but too tasteless and oxidated for me to enjoy."
"Pours a clear golden-straw color. The head is tiny and thin, and disappears within seconds. The smell is mild and simple. The only thing I notice is sweet malt. The taste is as simple as the smell. Lightly sweet with mild bitterness to balance it out. The mouthfeel is medium-thin with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is smooth and balanced. The taste is too simple for my liking, but it is still bad. Easily drinkable."
"Purchased with free glass at LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Color is gold with slight haze. Head is full and white but lacks the lace on the side of the glass. Carbonation is full and quite fizzy. Nose is very weak except for slight grassy sweetness. Flavor is also light with a nice crisp mouthfeel. Finish seems to lean toward the sweet and syrupy side. Falls between drinkable and good. Curious as to the age and its effect on delicate hop balance."
"Crystal-clear straw gold color, with an ample head. Nose is sweet, grainy, with a tad bit of fresh hop aroma. Flavor is a pleasant mix of simple sweet malt and a fairly prominant bitterness. Hop flavor is fairly low, slightly floral. Moderate carbonation and a nice crisp mouthfeel. A fairly typical continental pils, well-brewed but not very exciting."
"Pours a straw golden colour with nice fluffy head with tight bubbles falling down to a thin layer. Smells slightly hoppy, slightly skunky. Could be light-struck, green bottle. It's got a pretty good balance, malty taste with nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel so-so. All in all I'd say it's a good beer to have with dinner but I wouldn't want to drink a bunch of them."
"Drinkability/notes: A pleasant Euro-lager, nothing special, but decent and easy to drink."
"I do not know too much about euro ""pale"" lagers but none-the-less i do find this beer enjoyable. Tastes like a typical european beer would usually, bitter,hoppy, maybe though with a little less bite than some. Still this beer is flavorfull and overall good."
"As much as I don't like Stella as a rule, it ain't a bad beer at all. This is like the Coors light of Belgium and I no like Coors light--this is better.."
"Drinkability: What can I say, I know I'll get bashed on by my friends for giving such high marks to a ""European macro", but compared to the other euro pale lagers I've had, I think this is one of the better. Did I enjoy this beer? Yes. Highly drinkable, highly sessionable. Would I buy this beer again? No. Too pricey, especially for a style I don't really care for."
"Finished dry and clean with slight astringent bitterness."
"Overall Impression: Eh. Fairly easy to drink, but so is water. A bit bitter for the style, but I guess it gives it some character. Dont think Id cross the street to try it again, but wouldnt refuse it if offered to me at a party."
"Pours a generic translucent gold color with a quick dissipating head. Smell is pretty homogeneous, smelling like hops and barley with wheat. The taste is pretty generic also for a lager... i would say the only redeeming thing about this beer is that if you are looking to have more than one of anything, this is a good place to start looking."
"A decent session lager, probably recieves more crap than it deserves from BAs and the like, but also recieves too much attention and praise from people ""not in the know"". To many people, this is ""Belgian Beer"" which is unfortunate. With that being said, this is a decent session brew, not nearly as skunky as many other euro lagers of its style. Served out of a green bottle into a pilsner glass. Aroma is a little sweet, slighly hoppy. Taste is crisp, clean, a little sweet, a little hop bitterness in the end. Doesn't have the nasty adjunct taste stuff like Heineken has. I would say that this is an alternative to stuff like Bud, etc that is on tap everywhere, except that this beer is priced as a high-end brew, sometimes even ultra-highend. Not worth the extra price if you ask me, if it were cheaper I'd probably buy it more often."
"This was a tasty beer on a hot day on a recent trip to Florida. I don't feel that it was necessarily special in any one particular way, but just good. It reminded me of a Heinekin at first with a slightly skunky smell, some find that off-putting, but to me its just another unique character to certain beers. It had a nice pour with a head that disapated quickly, not the most desirable quality. I thought the taste was typical of a lager with that slight flowery hoppy-ness to it. I never really feel that mouthfeel applies much to this kind of beer, it should be light and go down easy and it did. I would consider this a very drinkable beer although a bit pricey in some locales. Although I didn' t have more than one on this occasion, I wouldn't rule it out as a sessions beer based on taste and quality alone."
"The pint came out with a nice lite and clear yellow, white head. But again with the Euro lagers, that sulfur skunk peaked its head up in the aroma and slightly in the taste. Still a lightly hoppy brew with a grain base. Thin mouth of course, but I just cant make a long go of Euro brews with the skunk  one or two, OK."
"This is a underrated Euro Lager, but to each their own. It is head and shoulders above the rest of the macro Euro Lagers. It pours a nice light golden color and has a nice white head that sticks around for most of the glass. The aroma is a nice bready malt with a little bit of hops. The flavor is nice and clean... nothing spectacular, but then this is a Lager not a Barleywine. It has a decent hop bite that is missing from most macros. It tastes like Heineken used to taste before it was ruined. The only thing that holds this beer back is it's price. I could get a case of Bud and have change in my pocket for the price of two sixers of Stella."
"Pours out to a light, golden color in the glass with an average sized head. Aroma is rather grassy, with a slight citrus in the background, albeit light. The taste is very ""Euro lager'"" tasting with an initial creaminess that belies a slight sweetness that finishes with a dose of light hops. Hoppier than American/Canadian lagers. Nothing outstanding, but a decent thirst quencher."
"Stale Club cracker malt flavors up front. A little cardboard as well, along with some herbal sweetness. Hops are lightly skunked, but provide more bitterness than expected. Not awful, just very underwhelming. Light, spritzy mouthfeel. Meh...I think there are possibly one or two better beers from Belgium ;-)"
"Drinkability: WHY? The aforementioned tonic water is higher on my list to drink than this dreck.Glad it was only a tasting. I poured this one on the ground. Alas, NOT a waste."
"Mouthfeel was surprising crisp at the start and finish (based on the flat appearance), and had a clean finish. Drinkability is fine, but overall this brew is slightly dull."
"This one always reminded me of the bad Euro Lagers I had when studying for a semester in Italy back in college. On draft, it's just as good as a Dinkle Acker or a Pilsner Urquell. Easy enough to drink but I feel they'll always be better options for the same price."
"No really strong flavour, mild sweetness, and some hop in the finish. Body is fuller then many lagers and the carbonation is what you expect. Drinkability is about average."
"Notes: I bought this because I knew it was Belgian. Thinking this way, I expected a lot more. Now I know that this is swill for Belgians, so I feel a little better (maybe even jealous?) I'm looking forward to better Belgian beer, like the Chimay I'm saving for a special occasion."
"One of the better lagers I've had. I'd love to have a 12-pack of this on a hot summer's day."
"I find this one's much better on tap than from the bottle (although certainly still drinkable in its bottled form). I certainly think this is one of the best (if not the best) widely available Euro lagers."
"Drinkability is this beers reason to be here and it does not dissapoint!"
"Got the 500mL can with the glass gift set. Funny that the glass can't hold all the beer from the can. Still happy with the glass though."
"Really, I can't understand who couldn't subjectively appreciate this beer. It is, in my oppinion the ultimate pale euro lager. Not to be confused with other belgians in different catagories, but to be compared with other Dutch, German, Czech, etc. type Pilsner/Helles/Dortmund style lagers. I beleive this to be a fantastic euro brew & recommend this to many. Pale & clear in color, a slight grassy taste followed by a mild malt sweetness and finally a bit of hops shine through for the proper aftertaste. Becks who? Grolsh huh? What's Heineken? I'm not sure, as I have no need for them now."
"Sinkability  I couldnt finish this one if my life depended on it."
"Drinkability: Ok, if only one in an once, two bottles max. It is really not a beer to get loaded with."
"I thought that this was an easy to drink beer, more like a ""Euro-Pils"" than a standard ""Euro-Lager."" I found it interesting that my first bottle was relatively free of skunk (some light notes of it), but another bottle in the 6-pack which my brother had reeked of it the minute he popped the cap. I've had two more bottles out of the 6-pack since and no skunk was encountered. It seems that this beer can really change depending on whether or not it's lightstruck. To finish, this beer is really not what Belgian beer is about, but it is decent enough to give it a try."
"Right off the pour I can tell this is going to be green bottle brew at its finest. Clear pale straw color, pretty nice white head on the top. Nice lacing as well. Green bottle scent, sweet malt. Light malt in the front, some bitter hops. Fairly thin mouth. I guess you get what you expect from this standard Euro lager"
"Drinkabilty: Actually this is a good sessions beer, but that's about it."
"Drinkability- Poor. Doesn't quench your thirst, and not a very good flavor. I honestly had some difficulty finishing it. A pretty unappealing Euro-lager."
"poured this beer into a pint glass, it pours a nice golden color, there is a nice constant 1/2 inch head. The smell, I get good hops and balancing maltiness. Nothing to write home about, but better than average. The mouthfeel has a slightly creamier mouthfeel than most lager I am use to. This is a beer I could sit down and consume mass quantities if I was in a situation to do so."
"I drink Stella periodically but this time it tastes really average. It is upsetting that a lager with a 650-year heritage has dwindled into mediocrity over the course of mere decades, due to its change from a beer at the forefront of Western European lager to one aimed at the masses with money in mind. It is still definitely potable but it has lost its je ne sais quoi that made the beer as popular as it has become. Cheaper beers that do the same job can be found, in particular (in Australia) with the Dutch lager Hollandia."
"A lager from Belgium? And a relatively good one too. Pours a clear golden with a foamy white head with tons of lace and effervescence. Smell was Saaz hops and not much else, akin to a Pilsener, but a little funkier. Taste is some malts up front, with a pleasant liggering hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was quite crisp and light. This goes great with seafood, and although there are many Belgian beers that make this look like a glass of fizzy golden water, I still enjoy this very much."
"Again, I'm not a lager fan. This lager is exceptional in that it tastes ""clean."" Its is not overly hopped, and it is not watered down. A good strong taste, nice sparkling gold colour. An overall solid beer, slightly above average. I wouldn't buy this for myself, but I would accept it if offered."
"Had this one at a bar in Atlanta called Randevous. I expected to get it in a pint glass, but to my suprise they put it in an actual Stella glass. Thanks to them, I have another glass for my collection, hehehe. Anyways, not too impressive of a beer. Just like a light euro lager pretty much. Thin taste, light color, and nice head to it. The head retention was impressive, but that was the only good thing about this beer really. Oh, and ofcourse, it was friggin' expensive as well."
"Drinkability- I wouldn't seek this out again, but I would take it over other lagers. Would prefer something else though."
"Poured a pale straw colour, with a nice foamy head. Better than average lacing, quite impressive. Other than how it looked, it was just another average euro lager. Taste was crisp and clean. Good amount of hop bitterness. Light malt, but not much else. Way too over hyped. It's kinda like the beer for pretenders at beer bars who think they're drinking the premium stuff but aren't really."
"Drinkability is high, good easy drinking lager that is better than a lot of the euro-lagers I've had, very smooth, and no unpleasant tastes in here!"
"Based on what I have come to know and expect of beers from Belgium, about the only thing this beer has in common is geography. Really did not strike me as a Euro lager and seemed more in line with some lagers produced in Canada, and even then not one of the better ones. Somewhat thin, with a grapey note to the hops. Perhaps this was a better beer in the past before becoming megaopolized, but right now it hits the lower side of average on my scale."
"I see so many people order this beer where I work and I have no idea why they would ever chose it. Advertising? Uneducated? Scalded taste buds? I don't know but I don't feel the need to ever drink this beer again."
"This beer is overrated by most regular beer drinkers but undervalued by the beer snobs. It is quite drinkable with a pleasant hoppy nose. I prefer it over Heineken and Becks and most definetely over Canadian. Not a great beer but not the crap some would have you believe."
"Poured out of the can into the Stella Artois glass that came with the can. It's a nice glass. Anyways, the head is rather small. Goes up to about 3/4 of a finger, and disipates to maybe 1/4 of a finger after about 7 minutes. Though a pale yellow, it's not transparent. I put my fingers on the other side of the glass, and all I see are the shadows. Hazy as well. As if their is a bit of a thick cloud inside the glass. Lace sticks magnificently well. Smells like a typical pilzner. Bit of cracked corn, grain husks and saaz hops. Lightly skunky, but I think that's how it is supposed to be. Tastes incredibly malty. The first sip makes me crave a sandwich on pumpernickel. And at the moment, it 'hits the spot.' Aftertaste is slightly grassy. Not very bitter, but grassy. Smooth, full bodies mouthfeel. Not heavy, but above medium. Certainly a drinkable lager, and definitely a session beer."
"Pours a nice pale yellow with a nice creamy white head. The smell is of grains and lemon zest. The taste is smooth and clean, hints of spice and citrus zest with a floral hop, grains balance out the beer, very clean, goes great with clams or other seafood, light and great on tap."
"Wow. This is one average ass beer. Looks like your typical mass-produced belgium lager, with hardly any head or lacing. Smells like sour malts and a bit of unfresh hops. Tastes a little above average, but not enough ot make it anything special. Once I got down to the bottom, I could definitly taste the ""green."" I was really dissapointed by the mouthfeel. Felt like I was drinking a warm, flat sprite on a cold winters day. And finally, this is a drinkable beer if you can stand it. All in all, an average ass beer."
"An average beer to me."
"Clear yellow body, small head tops it off. Classic crisp pils hop aroma. Mild beginning to the taste with the standard pils hop finish. Pils is not my favorite style, but I can appreciate it. Light carbonation mouth feel, crisp finish, and no after taste."
"guess what, this is a typical euro lager. but it seems to be a few times better than heineken. smell is crisp and dry hops and grain. head is a little creamy and sticks to the sides. taste is clean, crisp, some hops going on, not to well balanced. if you are going to drink a euro lager you might as well drink this one."
"Unerrated, this is a fine brew. Crystal clear, firm,sturdy head that lingered. Smell was forcefully hoppy. Taste followed suit will a nice malt sweetness and a somewhat smoky hop whack. Really good! Competes well with the finest pilsners. This beer is too hip to score well with BA's. Too bad."
"Overall: This is one of the better mainstream Euro-lagers. This is a clean, refreshing and flavorful lager, great for hot weather drinking."
"Rating it again because the can was about as good as the bottle. So if youa re stuck, at least you will get a mediocre OK interbrew that's not metallic tasting. Had a pint on the patio at end of a hot afternoon and could cope. Malt lager that is pale and on bitter side."
"500mL can with best before date stamped on the bottom."
"Clear pale piss yellow. Not golden, just a blah kind of macro light yellow. Thin white head with a little stickiness to it. Slight maltiness, grassy hops and a little of that green bottle skunk on the nose. Dry feel in the mouth. A little spicy. A little more of that skunk. Pretty bland flavor. Mouthfeel is a little low on CO2. Body about medium. This one's average at best."
"I really cant tell if there is anything truly destinctive about this Euro macro lager....its like so many others in shared character. If I was pressed for aa answer, I would say the malt body is a tad heavier than most macro light lagers and the hop delivery is late (perhaps over stated) and bites too hard in the finish leaving the tongue very dry. Poured a light gold with a smallish white cap that dissipated quickly. Aromas of boiled grian hulls with slight sweetness and a mild floral tone from the long boil of the hops. Very carbonated...slightly thin in the upfront mouth feel then mellows a bit as the malt sweetness and bready taste is departed then the finish is crashingly dry. Not bad but hyped too much. A standard Euro-macro lager...the type of thing you would expect to see shamelessly marketed in cans."
"Not awful, but not great. A big seller over here even though theres soooo much better out there"
"Not what I'd expect from a Belgian beer, very bland and nondescript."
"A belgian macro. Its really not that bad of a beer. It actually tastes more like a german pilsner with some belgian overtones. Of course isnt that what a lot of belgians are like anyway? Its not to bad. Id take it over bud any day."
"What's up with the hype behind this brew? Looks like dishwater runoff and doesn't taste any better. Had it on tap at the Irish Pub, Atlantic City. It did come in a cool goblet that I took the liberty of keeping. Save your money and have a coke, I wouldn't drink this stuff it was free."
"As an aside, I really have to hand it to them for those commercials on English TV that are in French with no subtitles, makes them seem really artsy...except to people who can actually speak French like myself."
"Uggh... gave a try after a buddy with decent taste offered. Wont ever drink again. Very bland and boring, nothing unique, average, by the end of the bottle it just tasted like overly carbonated water with a weird taste that I couldn't place, definitely not hops or malt. I don't like to be able to see through my beer. Maybe if it wasn't so carbonated it wouldn't be half bad.... nope."
"Tap: Poured a golden colored beer with a nice foamy white head. Aroma is mostly light floral with some malt. Taste is very light and refreshing with again some malt and floral aspect coming through. Medium carbonation with light body. Very little else to mention for this beer apart from the fact that it seems to be better on tap then in bottle. Overall, a refreshing session-type lager."
"The sharp, impacting carbonation felt in the mouth and throat--which then disappears--adds a nice element of uniqueness I find to this beer--and also makes it quite drinkable, excellent with a meal. Medium body adds some umph. A good mediocre beer with some character of its own."
"This is the Budweiser of Belgium. Okay, that might be a little harsh. To be honest, I would only go as far as calling this average in every way. It reminds me very much of Molson Canadian. It's more malty than anything. There was a mild floral scent and taste along with the malty sweetness of it, but that was about it. I'm not impressed, but not totally disappointed by it. I don't think the price was fair. $5.00 for a pint. I should have stuck with something better for 3.50 a pint. That's what killed the drinkability factor"
"It's definitely easy to drink."
"Poured out a pale gold color with a decent head on it. Some hop aroma in there but it was mostly a clean smell to this beer. This was a light mixture of some malts and hops. They were balanced quite well I should add, but it was just a little too light for a pale lager. If there was a little more flavor to it then it would be quite a decent beer. Granted this is much better than macros, but the price is quite hefty on for a sixer. Maybe I'll revisit this one down in the future."
"Good enough. Easy to drink."
"I was disappointed. Not much body, not much soul."
"Not much to look at, but very drinkable. Not filling or satisfying, but does fill a need for refreshment. Not much of a lager fan but this is something I would go back to, and would drink a lot of, compared to domestic lagers, save for the price point."
"An easy drinking lager, better than most but nothing I'd run out to buy."
"Pours yellow with a decent amount of head. Not much to the smell here, smells like a typical lager. Tastes good, but again, pretty average. The best quality about this beer is its drinkability. Good session beer. Overall, an average tasting brew, but i would probably get it again some time."
"As I bash lagers and pilsners quite a bit, I must say this beer hit the B spot as its like 85 degrees Fahrenheit today. The color on the pour is a crystalline gold with a prosperous white head that is also creamy in texture, with the lace a fine veil to conceal the glass. Nose is prototypical lager fresh and sweet, nicely malted with the start sweet and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a pleasant acidity with the hops apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste and a quite drinkable lager that Ive not sampled in years, a great session beer for the hot summer days in Arizona that are just around the corner."
"Vigorous pour left a bright white 1-finger head that dissipated quickly with a small amount of lacing. Clear, bright gold in color, with constant carbonation. A faint malty aroma that I had to strain to pick up. Basically your standard mass produced lager. Well balanced in flavor, with a crisp maltiness that hangs around. Don't expect too much from this beer and it won't disappoint you. This a pale lager, and even a belgian pale lager can only do so much. It is very drinkable (I drank untold gallons of this stuff when I lived in Belgian), but probably not worth the premium price you would pay for it in the US. That said, it is much better in my opinion than your average american macros."
"12 ounce bottle, best before date of 06,2004. Fresh. I tried to buy a single, for sampling purposes, but was told that was ""against the law"" oh well. Light, straw color, some sulpher in the nose and perhaps some cabbbage. Very little malt flavor. Very moderate hopping. Fairly watery. Medium body. Not much flavor in the finish. I wouldnt bother again. Very hot day beer, or with a salad. Try to find something better to spend your money on."
"I'll take this over a Heineken any day! And I bet it's much better on tap than from the green bottle."
"I thought I would give Stella a chance on tap, figuring that it would be better than the bottled version. I must be missing something, because this has no relationship to good Belgian brews. It doesn't even compare with mass-produced German brews like Beck's or Lowenbrau. It looks okay, but mundane. It looks about like a Michelob on tap. There is very little head, no discernible lacing, and no aroma. The taste is also curiously subdued (that's a nice word for no taste). It is thin in the mouth, but does go down easy, and it was cheap on tap. I talked to the manager about putting a good local beer on tap in its place."
"Very easy drinking stuff. It's typical european continental lager, but I don't have a problem with that. Not too different from any of the other dozen or so varieties we get here in the US, but it's an enjoyable pint when fresh. Much, much better than the bottle, where the carbonation has always been too fizzy for me."
"Riiight! [;-)"
"Beer was very soft and creamy and extremely easy to drink. I had several as it was the best beer the bar offered. I liked this beer more than I thought I would and I dont think it deserves all the bashing it gets."
"Crystal-clear light gold with a small white head that leaves a lot of lacing down the glass. Smell is big, but not that great - a little too grainy and reminiscent of cornmeal. Flavor is fine, feel could be smoother with the carbonation. A step above most pale lagers, but nothing too special."
"-won't drink again."
"Certainly drinkable, no match for a Czech Pilsner though."
"Drinkability: Tastes like a well crafted macro. Nothing special. Good, but not noteworthy."
"Like I said, disappointing; especially for a county that produces Chimay and Duvel, etc."
"Pretty common stuff and hard to get excited about. One of those lowest common denominator beers that doesn't look like much, doesn't smell like much, doesn't taste like much. Good thing falling asleep while you're drinking a beer isn't (generally) dangerous."
"The taste is above-average when compared with most macro Euro-lagers. It has a nice crisp refreshing hoppiness and isn't sweet at all. I don't catch too much of a corn or rice adjunct here, which is nice. Stella is clearly nothing too spectacular, but it is more than drinkable. I prefer this over Heineken, Becks, 1664, et al. My best memory of this beer was drinking it on the streets and public transit of London."
"On tap at Bailey's Smokehouse in Richmond."
"The beer poured a light gold color with a white lace head. The aroma is decent. It has a clean and refreshing scent. It smells of pale malts and lager yeast. The taste is rather good. It goes down smooth and easy. It's simple; pale malts, water, hops, and yeast. It also has that skunky green bottle taste to it. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good lager. Id drink this again and I typically hate lagers."
"Pale gold color, huge white head. Gigantic smell of grass clippings and grain. Has a very mellow flavor, not like a watered down macro, but it is more subtle. Has a very euro lager flavor, with a nice balance of hops. Not my favorite style, you can keep your euro lagers..."
"This beer poured with a very large and creamy head that lasted till the last drop. The color was a very light gold. Nice and clear and crisp looking. The smell as best I could describe was a sweet skunky smell. The taste was good. I have to admit I was surprised. It has a very crisp taste. A slight sweetness and a nice dryness to the aftertaste that I enjoyed."
"Smell is a touch malty and very sweet smelling. The flavor is more solid than I remembered. Even has a nice hint of hops in there. I must say that I prefer this beer in the bottle over the draft. Much more clean and crisp."
"Stella Artois is a nice looking beer and presents a pleasant frothy and creamy head with lots of sticky lace. Stella Artois has a strong aroma and may be labelled 'skunky' by some drinkers. A malty initial taste with an extremely sharp and dry aftertaste. I wasn't expecting Stella Artois to have this much flavour."
"Drinkability: A somewhat better than average lager... would certainly pick it over any American macro."
"One of the better mass produced beers. They are taking advantage of this in Australia and charging a hell of alot for it, and suckers like me fall for it because there are no better options at some bars (beer wise that is - there's always spirits!)."
"average bar without many choices, never had it, bar tender swore it was great, what the hell. pours yellow, but not as pale as macro american lagers, dinky white bubbly head tops its off. served pretty damn cold, not much of a nose...slighty grainy and a bit floral is all i can pull off it. taste wise, pretty close to the standard ""import"" lager (save the few greats). lighty grainy, semi sweet, wth a light clean hop twang. crisp and well carbonated, its a plain lager. nothing more, nothing less."
"The fact that the look is the high point of this beer does not bode well. You can drink as many of these as you'd like, but why would you? It's not vile, I don't want to imply that, but I had one, and immediately switched to Yuengling at half the price, and believe in my heart of hearts that I'd be getting the best deal even if the Lager were the more expensive beer. They say it sells well to the ladies, but I don't want to believe the fairer sex has been duped so utterly. Apparently Stella is Belgian for medicore, at best."
" Unfortunately, Belgium's most popular beer is not thier best example. If I were recommending a nice starter Belgium...I would say try a Witkap Pater Single(5%abv), Leffe Blonde (5%abv) or Val-Due Blonde (6%abv)."
"there are better belgian lagers, but even so, for whats available in my neck of the woods, this is a goer. stella has saved my bacon on a potentially dismal drinking night on many occaisions. having said that, ive never bought a six pack of this in my life. i reserve it strictly for emergencies."
"Char"
"I have no idea why they waste good Belgian water to produce this kind of lager. Not that it's bad, but it's just another European lager. Better suited to a summer afternoon than a November evening like tonight. Not much color or head, but a decent hop aroma. The flavor is good but many others brew this kind of beer better. Put this at the bottom of Belgian beers to try unless you are a big fan of European lagers/ pilsners."
"The Czech Stella, served in a somewhat large .66 liter bottle. Appears golden yellow, with head approaching 0 towards the end. Smells like not much at all, slight hoppy smell. Taste is bland, a little hoppy and consistent. There are better lagers to be found, my friends."
"Ah, the even crappier Russian version of Stella. I ordered this at an excellent Chinese restaurant in Moscow. It came out in a nice logo stemware glass, and didn't look half bad. Slightly greenish gold sits under a one-finger white head that settled quickly. Forget about lace. The nose was malty, grainy, ricey and slightly skunked. The mouth was a bit prickly and fairly heavy, with a bready consistency. The taste features mild bitterness from the start, with musty malt undertones and a touch of cabbage. The finish is vegetable and hoppy bitter, while the aftertaste has a crisp bitterness, with ricey notes. Could I drink a ton of these? Sure. Would I want to? Not really."
"Ah, the crappy UK version of Stella, drunk from a can whilst watching Blaine greet his army of fans. This is watery with no real aroma of hops or malt. The taste is the same....it tastes of something, but what, I don't know! Mouthfeel is light and drinkability is OK. Average"
"I anticipated liking this less. In fact my first try was from a sample bottle provided free. Wasn't moved, even disliked it, at first, but it grew on me. On tap, as you can tell from other reviews, it's quite a nice, simple, thirst-quenching, quaffable pils. I can easily understand it's popularity. There's just enough flavor to make this well worth drinking, and not be just another ""pizza chaser", bland lager."
"overall, there wasnt much to this beer so i cant really give it very high marks. i have to say, i wanted to like this beer, but it sort of left me feeling like i missed something"
"Bombard me with the average while you still can! im certainly distancing myself from the lagers and now i know why: all pales taste like the same mediocre crap no matter if coming from belgium or khatmandu. I was thrilled to try this one but came out disappointed. get out of my sight, good man."
"Strikingly clear pale gold, a nice head that laces very well and lasts longer than many beers in this class. Light malt nose, slight musky funk and seeds. Some slight cardboard to the rather ordinary sweet malt, approaches a light nuttiness. Unidimensional medium light body and just a nod to the hops at the close. There's nothing of distinction to this beer other than smoothness and slight character to the malt bill (and its very overpriced) -- but it is pretty attractive and drinkable and less grainy than something like Harp..."
"Light gold color, medium head. Light bodied lager style beer. Light malts, somewhat hoppy. Taste is a little harsh. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Some green bottle taste. I realize that this is supposed to be a ""classic"" beer, but it really doesn't show me much."
"Its a great afternoon, sitting on the deck brew. Pours a golden yellow with a strong white bubbly head - like a palomino. It leaves a lace as intricate as, well, Belgian lace. A pleasant smell of the stuff beer is made of: hops and malts and other stuff. A light smell, really, that is hard to peg - stronger would be better. Fills the mouth with a real sense of decent lager. For those who think lager can be good this can be a good friend. Slides down well. I like to drink it with salad (yep, its true) but it is good all by itself. It is light and refreshing but very un-Belgian really. Its a good get started beer - you know - for a masses style of beer."
"This beer poured a lemony yellow color that had a real slight haze to it. Decent carbonation. The head that was produced was thick, creamy, sticky and full in consistency and was the color of white. Decent last time then fell to a ring on the edges. The lace created was intricate and delicate. The aromas that came from the glass were of some light citrus fruits, sweet malts, hops, grains (seemed to be very prominent when there were aromas that came forth) and it was bready in the end. All aromas were light and not very pronounced. The flavors that came forth were of fruits (light pear and apple), bitter hops, light hints of alcohol, grains (husks), some sweet malt and a yeasty bread at the end. The aftertaste was light and had a hop appeal to it. Thin and watery was the body and some-what crisp on the tongue. Not what I would have expected from a Belgian beer. It was decent and drinkable. Seemed to me that it had qualities of a macro produced beer. Would I get again and drink. Sure."
"Served at the Eulogy bar. This beer poured a very clear and bubbly golden straw color and was topped off with a large and lively white head. I have had this beer many times before and have always found this beer to be pleasing and drinkable and much better than your standard American macro beer. I think this was the first time Ive had it on tap and it was very good. Its a flavorful beer with a soft grainy and grassy character and has a sweet and sour quality about it. Also leaves an oiliness on the tongue. Light and easy to drink. I like it."
"Another Interbrew on tap offering. Nice looking golden color, lofty white head, not at all like any other pale lager. Served in a tulip glass. Not much in the way of smell, some indistinct grains and a bit of sweet malt. Has a strange taste that dominates the middle...tastes like cooked vegetables?...ahh this is the DMS flavors so often spoken of. I've never experienced it as pronounced as this. Not bad for a pale lager, but not that great either."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I would not buy it for a special occasion and I probably would never have it when I go out to a bar. But if I had access to it, I would have this in my fridge often, and that's the sign of an OK beer to me."
"It has a nice feel to it and can be drunk with ease. Crisp and refreshing it would go very well with a meal. I will try this one on tap and see what transpires."
"Ahh sweet Stella, oh how I have avoided thee in thy green glass bottle, to avoid a skunky experience, but alas the time has come. Belgium is reknowned for their strong ales, but a belgian lager is rare. Pours an extremely clear yellow with a titanic head of fine bubbles. Lacing is consistent and covers the whole inside of the glass. Aromas are light, grassy, just a little ""skunk""... Taste is very light and the mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Fairly balanced between hops and malts, but everything is subtle. This would be good on a hot day and definitely with food."
"I must admit that I dislike Stella for the way that it plays up being Belgian (to the point of its own glassware!) when it's nowhere even close to as interesting as most other Belgians. That said, this is not a terrible lager, and probably better than some other green bottle offerings."
"not a great brew (in fact, i rememebr it being better in the past), but along with peroni, it's probably my favourite amongst the imported lagers in a green bottle. pours a healthy golden colour with just the right amount of carbonation for a lager. a bit heavy on the grainy taste but nothing to complain terribly about. definitely an easy brew to drink and it's available in more places than i thought lately, so it's a nice alternative when your other choices aer bud, miller, heineken, etc."
"This is a super beer for that person who is just getting into beer and is willing to try new things. I remember, years back tasting this beer at a local pub here in Chicago and thinking, hey this is a pretty nice beer. It is light and easy to drink and accompanies all manner of bar food with alacrity. I've had many a Stella with many a grilled chicken sandwich with jack cheese, roasted poblano pepper, and guacamole-don't forget the side of fries and a little mayonaise for dipping. The beer is mainly about refreshing, offering ample sweet malt/biscuit flavors and a splash of hop. If you can, try this one after a long day walking the streets of Paris, and you'll see why this beer is so popular there. Recommended highly for those who like the style."
"Notes: A tasty little quaff. Worth a go every now and then, at least on tap."
"This sampling was a from a green 660ml bottle with a freshness date on the back. Poured out with a decent sized chunky white head, but it faded fast. Clear straw coloured appearance. Left a small ring and some small traces of lace. Nose possesses malty sweetness, mild flowery hops, a bit watery. Flavour is some what skunky, the malt and hops jump in to get to you first, but neither seems to win. It's fairly drinkable, but disappointing for a Belgian beer. The Bud of Belgium is how I have it pegged."
"Overall, better than what the giants in the US spew out, but definitely not what you'd want in a Belgian beer."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color, and it is a little fizzy. Not a whole lot of aroma. A much lighter bodied Belgian beer than many of the countries offerings. It has a fairly nice taste and is quite refreshing. Missing some of that lager after-tatse. Better than your average macro brew. A very good session beer."
"559"
"This beer was quite deceiving to me. It is Belgian and therefore I feel like I should expect something great. The beer was a decent lager and was quite drinkable. This beer may serve as a benchmark for american lagers and for that reason makes me appreciate them more. The overall appearance is that of a pale lager or a pilsner. The beer refreshes throughout and remains quite uniform as you drink the beer. The hops are what separates it from the average pale lager. Definitely chosen with taste in mind. I think this beer is a great representation of the style."
"Good hop aroma with just a touch of contential malt in the nose. Hops continue into the flavor with the spiciness of the hops appearing in the finish which dries out and makes you ready for the next sip."
"Searching for a good non-German lager is like walking up and down the beach with a metal detector; you get frequent false alarms and you rarely find treasure. I wouldn't say Stella Artois is a false alarm but I certainly wouldn't say it's a treasure. This is one of those beers where you'd buy it all the time if it were a little cheaper but for the price you realize it's just too bland. I say, if it comes from Belgium, it had better be god damn good, and Stella Artois is just... ""eh."""
"On draught: Looks like your average Pils clear light gold with snow white head. Tastes just like a German Pils in every way. Crisp clean light body with high effervescence. Subtle malt flavor and ever so slightly bitter.Very refreshing but not a great Pils. More recently I've had Pils from Ayinger and Pinkus which were both far better."
"At the place I went and had this the yuppie folk were buying this up left and right,I guess its the sheek beer around here.Poured into a fancy glass a straw yellow color with pretty nice head,smell was nothing in particular maybe a little hop?Taste was nothing spectacular a little malty with some thrown in at the end.Belgian Budweiser maybe?Anyways not offended by it but nothing to write home about."
"Ahhh... the Belgium macro swill. Not swill compaired to US macros, but not a great beer by any means. The fact that this beer hails from Belgium is shameful. Pours a clear light yellow with a small quickly fading head. Taste is quite light. Not bad, but nothing special. This beer is not worth the time or the money."
"This beer poured a dark straw color and formed a nice bubbly white head that didn't leave much lace as it subsided. The aroma was of green apples and had a slight skunkiness to it, which couldn't have been from the store since Columbus just got this stuff in a few weeks ago. A medium amount of carbonation was present. The flavor was of hops and grain. For a lager, it had a surprising amount of taste to it and the finish actually had a bit of body to it. I can see where people would compare this more to something like a Heineken."
"Bought this in Venice, and drank it in Vienna, Austria. Brilliantly clear, straw golden, forming a white sea-foam head atop small to medium sized bubbles. Retention and lacing are excellent if not exceptional. Aroma is skunked (owing to the green bottle), but I can still detect a smidge of belgian funk...dusty and dry with a note of sour green apples, toast and peanuts. Carbonation is moderately-strong. Mouthfeel is champagne-like with a light, crisp body. Taste begins with subdued flavor hops, followed by a dry bitterness, a hint of sourness and metals, with a crisp, prolonged moderately bitter finish, more so than the draught version. The malts seem to hang in the background, never becoming as dominant as I would have liked, and the bitterness is unbalanced, making it difficult to drink as it warms. The finish starts wet and crisp and ends soft with hints of peanut butter on toast. This beer has alot of potential, but I just keep wanting alot more funk-n-malt."
"This beers Belgian??? It was definitely a huge let down for me. It reminded me too much of Heineken or Grölsch (I personally dont like either of them.) Pours a clear yellow color with a small white head. The froth dies down quickly leaving a no lace. The aroma is very similar to the tail end of an angry skunk, horrible. The taste was just a hint better than the smell. I did, however, taste a little bit of hops amidst the pungent flavor. Mouthfeel was dry and the finish was quite sour. For a country that is so well known for its excellent beers, this is an insult to their reputation."
"A friend of mine left one of these in my fridge. Pours a golden yellow with a thin head that's quick to disappear. No lacing going on here. Smell is fairly clean. Lively carbonation. Taste is slightly sweet, crisp, with a dry finish. A good beer to have with spicy food, but really nothing special about it."
"I've heard this beer referred to as the ""Budweiser of Belgium", and now I can understand why. Pretty bottle, pretty beer, but after that, it's American lager, all the way. Sweet, weak, tastes liked adjuncts are there. My first and last time trying this. If I want Miller High Life, I can get it much cheaper than this (I don't want it, anyways!). This beer pales in comparison to almost any imported lager I've ever had (even Heinekin or Beck's)."
"Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on it because I tried it after a long day of tasting many flavorful Belgian ales and a super-tasty special IPA from BJs."
"It's a little hoppy and slightly dry. Not a whole lot going on inside, but this is a pretty beer. Has a very nice head, and a clean, clear golden color. Continental hop aroma and expectedly bitter. Not much beyond that, however. Average drinkability. Middle of the road, and probably not worth the price."
"The taste was average. A bit dry and hoppy, reminiscent of a Becks. It left a bit of a bitter aftertaste on the palette. Probably not something I would try again."
"My favorite ""foo-foo"" bar added this to their tap selection. It poured a nice amber color, but any hints of greatness or originality were not present. Just an average beer with an unusual name. Taste on the bland side, the carbonation keeping it going. It did go good with food, however."
"The taste again was not bad as is the mouthfeel and drinkablity. The smell makes it hard to make this anything but an average beer."
"Where's the beef. Just another boring import in a green bottle. This is skunk water. Light carbonation, extra-light bitterness (yet very floral aroma fighting through the skunk) Why but beer in a green bottle? Just another marketing SCAM! Why so much hype? Reassuringly expensive? It is in a green bottle, a yuppie magent, and the contents confirm my belief that no self respecing brewer buts his brew in a green bottle."
"A quite undrinkable beer that I will avoid in the future."
"Pours in a nice golden color with a big foamy head. It looks really clear and tasty. Smells...hoppy, nothing more nothing less. ;) The taste doesn't really appeal to me, just a malty and bready taste. Of course it's drinkable, but nothing fancy tasting here. Over all it's a decent pils with plus for the looks, but since when do you only look on beer? :o)"
"On draught at the Uva Cafe in Downtown Disney. This beer really did not impress me on any level. The first thing I noticed on the tap was that this was from Belgium so I guess I was expecting a Belgian Ale, but this is very obviously a Pils, and an uninspiring one at that. Pours an off-putting yellow with a thin white head. Light hops aroma. Bland flavor that did nothing for me. At least it wasn't skunky."
"The price of this stuff doesn't warrant buying it again. If I'm in the mood for this style I'll gladly grab a Warsteiner, or even a cheap bomber of Beck's....Stella is all pretense and no delivery."
"the flavor is a little bitter with good light malts and a nice hop character. drinkability is outstanding, it is very crisp and you can stick with this one all night and maybe longer."
"Not Bad at all, and the 'best' (above average) of the regular Keg Lagers available in the UK on Tap for me."
"This beer is made from pale malted barley -- some say corn mixed in as well -- and hopped with Saaz hops. When poured, the golden champaign-colored liquid produces a moderate amount of foam that dissipates quickly in a matter of minutes. The beer is mild tasting, almost unremarkable, but with a slightly bitter finish that lingers seconds afterwards. A pronounced, but not cloying, sweetness can be tasted long after all the bitterness disappears. The beer is quite refreshing when drunk cold, and mildly acceptable when warm. It has a 5.2% alcohol content. Better than budweiser, but there are better choices available than stella."
"A nice thick foamy head, which complements the golden color. The smell is very reminiscent of a heineken or any other European lager. What's great about this beer is cold, crisp refreshing. The aftertaste a little bitter, but overall the taste is refreshing and smooth. When it comes down to this beer is nothing complex, but I knew that coming into the tasting. This beer is sometimes referred to as Belgium's Budweiser, and all I can say if this is Bud why can't I be from Belgium!!!"
"I could get used to this lager in a big hurry...Such a smooth brew going down, leaning ever so slightly towards a mild hoppy bitterness that pleases the palate. The colour is that of medium gold with a lace that attacks the entire glass. A beer for all occasions."
"had a nice taste but a little to sour for me almost winey nice head good body outstanding color after this one iI was not refreshed I was expecting so much moore!"
"I love to drink this beer draught. Specially with 2 fingers of foam... It's just great. Very nice gold appearance, sparkling and nice smell. Quite good taste but not very strong and it can be drank anytime of the day.."
"Green bottle with a light golden color and little to no white foam. Color and aroma was the highlight of this average to below average beer. There was no outstanding flavor and the finish was just not there. What a let down. I still really haven't found a good beer in a white, green or light colored bottle! I've now tried this beer three times and still impressed."
"clear golden, little carbonation, sticks to the sides well.  mild malty smell.  i'm not a fan of this type but enjoyed this mildly hopped taste.  mouthfeel is full and heavily carbonated."
"Very drinkable, but since I am not a big fan of this style not one that I will go back to most likely."
"All you could want in a pilsner appearance-wise.  Solid gold, lacy white head that sticks around.  Just beautiful.  Nose is appropriately hoppy and grassy, with a very nice bisquity malt note.  Dissappoints somewhat on the palate.  Sort of ponderous and clumsy, with the malt and hops remaining distinct flavors, rather than uniting to make a beer.  Becomes a bit thick on the palate.  Ultimately, its a nice pilsner, but not one I'd actively seek out."
"Golden color with a nice white head and good lace. Also has great clarity. Smells clean with some grain aroma. Light and crisp, but not dry. Sort of reminds me of Heineken but much better and not skunky. Finishes with some hop and a lingering taste. Very easy to drink. A nice lager."
"Hoppy for a blonde (as opposed to a pilsener), crisp with a very nice finish. Apparently on of *the* beers of summer 2002, and rightfully so. I have little desire to drink it in the dead of winter, but it's lovely on the patio. Very consistent in quality, and a beer popular with my ""regular beer"" friends."
"Clear golden color, decent white head. Noticable sour beer smell. Taste was noticably hop heavy, but again a definite lingering sour finish. Harsh aftertaste as well. Lacks the the crisp, clean finish of some other pilseners or lagers. Worth a try on tap, but I wouldn't go out of my way again to order it. Although it better than some others, like Heineken."
"Crystal clear and golden in color. The head is a tight 1/8", and bright white. It dissipates somewhat but leaves a touch of Belgian-lace on the glass. The aroma has a slight ""sour"" malt note and a surprising earthy hoppiness in the background. The body is medium/light and it has an appropriate level of carbonation. The flavor is of a clean, thin malt with a touch of hops. Crisp. Very well balanced. Refreshing, dry aftertaste with good length. Not necessarily lacking in character - it definitely has it's own uniqueness - but not real complex. Then again, how many golden, mass market lagers do? Well done!"
"Good golden colour, good head, good taste, and definitely drinkable."
"Had this one in Canada, and found it to be a refreshing, although not terribly complex, lager.  The only thing I noticed that stood out, which I also found to be typical of Canadian craft lagers, is the yeasty aftertaste.  Good Belgian beer."
"A very nice introduction to Belgian bier.  I remember my first Stella...  A nice head pours out to reveal is bright golden color in the glass.  The first sip is crisp and quite refreshing, and this continues the rest of the way.  A great bier indeed."
"Stella seems to be the standard in the UK...its everywhere...in bottles, in pubs, on billboards. I thought it would be the Budweiser of England, so I was reluctant to drink it. However, it was very good on tap and almost equally good in the bottle. Probably not as good in the States, but I am looking forward to trying it here. An excellent lager."
"First sip. ""water"" i said out aloud. Second sip. ""wait a second", this beer isn't so bad, in fact, it's quite alot better than i was expecting it to be, hops present, crisp, even though it was quite cold. i imagine this would be a great beer to have on a real hot day."
"A good regular beer. Holds a solid head, carbonated just right, feels good going down. A bit skunky. A tad sweet and a hint of cherry (don't know why)."
"The only thing that I don't like about stella is the aroma. Almost smells like it's skunked. But once you get by that you will enjoy one of the best lagers. The head is like whipped cream and clings to the glass all the way to the bottom. Great golden color and a wonderful taste clearly makes this a classic."
"Stella is so very tasty.  A bit more flavorful than most American pilsners, Stella is a nice, light beer that is good for all occasions, with almost any food."
"I may be overly critical of Pilsners, but I tend to like them less than a lot of other styles. That being said, Stella Artois is not a bad pilsner, maybe because it's made in Belgium. Not as hoppy as a lot of the Pilsners I've had, but not too few hops. I did notice that the beer got blander and blander the closer to the bottom of the glass I got. I actually spent most of the glass thinking ""What the hell is wrong with this beer?"" I thought I had ordered a Troubador Blonde, but forgot they were out and I had settled for Stella."
"11.2 Oz. bottle. It is what you wanted beer to taste like when you were 16 (if I had taste when I was 16 years old). Quite drinkable, great with Pizza or Burgers.  But nothing special jumps out enough to make a huge impact on your tougue.  But a solid choice in a limited bar."
"I've finally had it in the bottle.  Light, refreshing Pils style, head and shoulders better than Becks/Henie et al. as it did not have that skunked out taste."
"It is clean, somewhat fruity, yet still barely keeps itself above the run of the mill euro lagers such as Heineken, Becks, etc..."
"A great lager, so easy to drink, but has a nice character and round flavour. Bit pricey in some places for what you get, but still nice."
"Average beer, no better, no worse. Had it on tap last night, and can't for the life of me remember anything that made it stand out from any other mass-produced pils."
"I'm not a big lager fan in general but there are a few that I do like to consume from time to time.  This one just got added to that list.  Not the greatest beer in the world but it is definitely very drinkable and would be very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Disappointing for a Belgium, strong hoppy smell.  they have been brewing it since 1366.  330ML bottle."
"Typical skunked green bottle pilsner.  I think all others (Heine, Becks, St. Paulie, you name it) are more drinkable."
"Not all that impressed.  I had it with Thai food and it went well, but seemed to be lacking something.  Nice balance, some citrus and light malt flavor, but nothing more.  I would not go out of my way to drink this again"
"Good stuff.  Not to expensive and tastes a heck of a lot better than a lot of crap some people put out.  It doesn't get any slick advertising and marketing here, but it's a much better alternative to a great many beers that do.  A very fine beer."
"I consumed huge amounts of this beer back and forth to Belgium on Sabena. It did me just fine ... nothing special just an other Euro lager, sadly this one is trying to ride the Belgain bandwagon and it does not even stand up to what really comes out of Belgium."
"An adequate lager for the masses."
"I'm not sure what the hype is about.  This beer isn't bad, but it's not worth what you pay for it."
"Unfortunately it seems that this beer is slowly suffering from the hand of Interbrew ... we'll see where it goes -- probably to shit."
