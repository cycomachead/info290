I my opinion, it is better than bud/miller/colors/fosters by a small margin. The hops strike with a bit more edge, and the malts are just as good. Light yellow body with tons of bubbles.

If served correctly, ice cold, in an immaculately clean 25cl glass, and in a bar full of friendly belgians, jupiler is hard to beat. I dont know what their export beer may taste like, but I think it is a lager that is balanced, maintains its head to the bottom of the glass, has lacing that runs the length of the glass, balances bitterness at the end with the sweetness that first hits your lips, and is really quite refreshing. Looks like lager should look like, served with a two-finger head that hangs around long enough. As far as commerical lagers go, it wins hands down against all the terrible commercial lagers from anywhere but belgium and germany.","baldiegooner","Nov 15, 2011"

Average feel for the style, med carbonation, light body and feel.

Pours a clear golden yellow colour with thin white head. Nice enough head retention, mild lacing. Smells pretty clean, some mild grassy hops and a bit grainy. Flavour has a hint of bitterness.

Jupiler pours a light yellow with hints of gold and a thin white head that doesn't stick around. The aroma is mostly grainy but there are some floral hops in background. The flavor is light and dry but there is a pretty decent bitterness and some hop flavor hiding in there. Hints of honey linger in the after taste. When I was in Belgium (at least where we visited), this was the everyday beer, if you asked for a beer it's what you got. It's certainly nothing special, especially compared to the alternatives in the country, but I would much prefer it to its American equivalents.","ericj551","Nov 02, 2009"

This was definitely a no-go. I drank it right from the head, so I didn't get a really good look at it but it was quite light from what I could see.

It's basically your standard euro lager, with maybe a little less skunkiness in the odor and flavor than most, and a little spiciness in terms of the malt, especially in the nose.

I eventually gave in and had one (in Amsterdam though) just to see how it was. It has a very light crystal clear amber body with a pure white head. So far, the Bud comparison holds true. The taste is where they differ. It has a light malty body with slight hop bitterness. The nice thing about this beer versus Bud is that you can actually taste the malt profile; even if it isnÂ’t the best beer flavor IÂ’ve tasted. The body is as light as a Bud would be, but it has slightly better drinkability.","drseamus","Jul 29, 2007"

The body is extremely light against its strength(5.2%abv) and overall the mouthfeel and structure is at best mediocre. I can't quite grasp the fact, so it's claimed in the beer catalogue for Wetherspoon's May Beerfestival, that it's the "most popular lager in Belgium"...surely the Belgians know much better and deserve better, even Interbrew's Stella Artois is less boring than this lager?!","wl0307","May 10, 2005"
