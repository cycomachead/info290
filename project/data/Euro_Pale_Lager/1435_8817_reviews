"I was hesitant to buy this one based on reviews, however was pleasantly surprised. I've seen reviews saying that the beer si bitter, however in Ontario, Canada we have the 5.5% version, and I find it quite sweet. It is also fairly smooth going down. Given the cost (about $2.25 per 500ml can in Ontario), this will be my go to for casual beers with the guys during HNIC."

"Pretty hard to find here locally, as it is not really a favor for most. And has to pay premium for a can here in Labuan, the duty free island of Malaysia."

"Can. An ordinary European standard lager. Pretty boring but works as a thirst quencher. Fruity taste."

"Overall-a decent Euro Pale that gets the job done, among the better of the styles and worth trying if it can be found."
"Dr: Very drinkable and refreshing. Decent quality, especially for the price - which is tolerable by Danish standards. My expectations were low based on the original Tuborg, but I found meself pleasantly surprised."
"I could drink this beer all night. It is better than the German beers i had yesterday!"
"D - Overall, I would never buy this again unless there was little else for choices. Nothing memorable here, move along!"
"Pours a pale straw colour with head that dissipates almost instantly. Absolutely no lacing. Smells a little bit grassy with some grain and metal, but mostly faint. Flavour is slightly sweet. Tastes marginally better than the North American macro lagers. Carbonation is fine. This was one of those beers that I would drink sometime before I got into craft... going back to it makes me wish I could go back in time and replace my years mediocre beer drinking with better beer."
"500ml can courtesy of Len. Thanks brother! Pours a standard golden yellow with one finger of bubbly white froth. Strands of lacing cling to the lager glass. Smell and taste are sweet, grainy, and apple-like aromas, a bit pissy, light grassiness, butter, some 'adjunct funk,' canned corn, empty maltiness, and a hollow, metallic astringency to end. Similar to most macro beers, this likely contains hop extract instead of actual hops. Mouthfeel is not quite medium with a vague spiciness midway. Mildly dry finish is grassy, floral, and somewhat tinny. Yikes! On first taste I thought this was decent, but I now realize why Tuborg Gold is $1.95 per can. Comparable to the worst BMC brands."
"A standard euro (pale) lager."
"Aroma is vegetal mostly with a faint hint of herbal hoppiness; some mineral notes; faint kiss of grain sweetness. Flavor basically mirrors the taste, and could not be less bland. The cooked corn notes aren't too present, but some comes through. Bland and boring even for the style. Too much veggie as well, and should have been cleaner. MF is lightish, noticeably lacking in the carbonation department. Bad drinking all-round, not even worth it in a pinch."
"When you crack open a Tuborg Gold, don't expect a rich complex beer. Please expect to drink a well rounded malty beer. To be honest, when I first saw this beer, I instantly thought this was going to be another Macro Lager with its watered down malts and no bitterness. I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted crispy malts with a subtle hop bitterness. I wish I could find this beer where I live."
"Very light overall. Not terrible, but not good. One or two of these might be drinkable, but after that I would probably switch to something with more flavor, or something that is smoother overall."
"Well, a bit better than I was anticipating, but still a plain and underwhelming European Pale Lager. Take a nod from the Bohemians, lads, and investigate the world of hops."
"D: Well this beer isn't bad, but it's not good either. There's almost nothing going on. It feels like they would benefit by putting in more of everything... Not as bad as an adjunct lager but to main-stream for my taste."
"Although, I don't think I would recommend it."
"not a big fan of this one I wont be buying it again any time soon"
"As for drinkability, I could easily have a few of these watching a game of hockey or something."
"D: Nowhere near the best beer I have had in Turkey, a place not really known for beer."
"Musty, grainy, metallic, almost soapy in its astringency, too much of a bittersweet metallic mouth coating to be refreshing."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Has a rich, golden color with a 1 1/2 inch head. Noticeable amount of lacing. Smell is good, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in mouth. Highly drinkable. This beer is very refreshing and overall a good pick."
"Appearance was cloudy, but could be because of the age of the beer (it appears to be over a year past the ""best before"" date). Good foam stability, displaying good lacing. Flavor is malty, with a light bitterness (again could be due to age & degradation of iso acids). Overall, good for a European golden lager."
"Drinkability - this is pretty decent to drink. Not much character but it takes care of my thirst!"
"A burp beer, meaning gassy and crap."
"D 3.5 - rinkable for sure, for a Euro Lager selection, not skunky like some"
"Overall I thought it was an okay beer. It was a bit surprising to me that is has some flavor."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a crystal clear golden color with lots of visible rising carbonation. The head was billowing, pure white and left decent lacing off the skim but otherwise retained poorly. The aroma was standard Euro Pale Lager, corn mash, slightly musty malt and hints of yeast. The flavors were at first slightly sweet but the malt then got blended away into the slightly herbal hoppy flavors leaving no distinction between the two. Not balanced, just sort of mashed together. Nothing else was going on beyond that. The body was medium/light, the carbonation a little too high and the mouthfeel prickly and watery. Typical and unpleasant."
"I tried this beer on May 12, 2008 after purchasing nfrom one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer pours a transparent pale gold with a white bubbly head, and a lot of effervescence. The aroma is sickly grainy malt, with a touch of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. The flavour is very grassy with little else to please the tongue."
"The can is clearly printed with the word ""Lager", but they could have saved themselves the trouble. Just cracking the seal released a sweet smell that simply screamed ""LAGER!"" It produced a finger's worth of thick, bone-white head that sat atop the beer like a layer of marshmallow Fluf. The nose was very sweet and seemed to fill the room with its overpowering scent. The color was a slightly cloudy golden yellow and the mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. It was fairly sweet on the tongue, but I experienced a really unpleasant metallic flavor on the finish. I am finding with these Euro-lagers that the cheap ones are not much of a bargain. I had to restrain myself from making this a drain pour."
"D: pretty average Euro-macro. Easy to drink - would make a decent session beer in the summer time. Nothing to write home about though and I would only buy this one again because it is relatively cheap compared to the other widely-available Euro tall cans."
"bouteille vendue sous le nom de Tuborg Bière de Luxe / Premium Beer"
"Tastes of light malts, dash of hops and a slight bitterness. Just a plain old everyday lager, and I don't like plain old everyday lagers."
"The BC liqour stores are awash with euro lagers in tall cans. Stella and Urquell are $2.50 each but Tuborg is one of the few at $2. I will admit that this is a decent lager with good crisp finish and adequate hops. Good value at the price and better than Holsten or Faxe. Sometimes when you are dealing with a number of beers of the same style you have to look at value for the money"
"Not much here for flavor and aroma but easy to down these especially ice cold....easy drinkable but not much else."
"Final Statement: This is pretty awful. Couldn't finish it."
"D- basic bland macro beer. Nothing to really enjoy here. Not so bad I couldn,t get through it though. Why anybody pays premium import prices for this stuff is beyond me."
"D: I would not activley seek this out, but if given one at a shin-dig...I would hold my tongue and accept it."
"Fairly clean, but also fairly boring."
"D: This beer is decent but nothing to write home about."
"Overall, this beer is all about corn, although a pretty good clean sweet corn taste, nice and tasty with no offputting flavors. I could drink this again when dehydrated."
"Pours a clear golden hay/sumshine hue. A little bubbling but a little under my wants and needs for this style of beer. A little head and foam, but all eventually subside. The first few whiffs where pretty metallic. But they eventually evened out to something a little more familiar. The flavor was also very tinny on the first few sips. But as the beer gradually warmed, it was all right. Somewhat easy to drink, but not sessionable in my book."
"Tuborg Gold was light golden in color with a decent head. The head was soon reduced to a ring aroud the glass leaving minimal lacing behind. There was a faint hop smell in the aroma, but not very good. It had a light malt flavor with just a touch of hops , not really much there. It was fairly light bodied with medium carbonation. Not a beer that I will likely purchase again."
"Far from being an enjoyable beer to drink. I'll avoid this one from here on out."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of clear honey , with a thin stark white head - nose of hay , grass , grainy and slight bitterness  taste of a lot of hay soapy , grainy , slight hops , and sour milk - body is grainy but acidic , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of orange peel , slight hint of hoppy bitterness"
"Eric"
"Tasted old and bad."
"500ml can: Poured a pale yellowish lager with a quite huge pure white foamy head with great retention and some lacing. Aroma of malt is weak and somewhat watery. Taste is dominated by some light malt and some very subtle hops. I wouldnt day that this is a bad beer but probably lack a bit of character which makes it a bit boring but still provide a good refreshment during summertime."
"D - The huge skunk is offputting, but it clears up after a bit. Taste is actually quite good as far as pale euros go. I wouldn't turn down a free one of these."
"mouth: sweet entrance. taste comparable to smell: apples and hay. there's no hoppy bitterness and only a very slight alcohol feel on the throat. not at all a balanced beer. The mouthfeel, though, I found to be excellent. Although it is not visible in the pour, there is a lot of carbonation that really let's you know that the beer's in your mouth."
"It was like Heineken gone really bad. Much better examples of this style are out there, and for less money."
"This evening, I have reviewed a Flanders ale of 8.5% with no traces of alcohol and two Scandinavian lagers round 5.8% that seemed to be strong like a vodka. Did we say craft beer vs. macro junk? Thank God I got my Hungarian hot sausages to soften those beers."
"Overall, the taste is a bit out of the ordinary for a mainstream beer. But I do think this is overmarketed for it's worth. Not my bag of tea."
"Clear, pale golden out of the can but the head it ridiculously huge. A big foamy, airy white head fills the glass before much liquid can be seen. Aroma is not there. Ok, some slight grain, lager characteristics, but not much. Taste is also quite watery. Slight fake sweet grainy astringent flavors. Hops come but are maybe metallic, I don't know, but they're off for some reason. Worse than being totally bland, this is bad. Stay away."
"Tuborg Premium is a decent gold color with plenty of carbonation. The foamy head is average-sized and ultrawhite. Aroma has a standard grainy sweetness with just a touch of herbal hop. Flavor has a grassy sweetness with a mild herbal hop bite. No off-flavors are present, but neither are any interesting ones. This is strictly average and, for those who are wondering, in the battle of Danish macros, Carlsberg is the clear winner."
"Off-yellow in color; ¼ inch white sizzling head. Grainy malts, grass and some earthy notes; warming of the beverage will reveal some fresh cut grass notes as well. Dry and very metallic malts; lingering adjunct flavoringssweet corn and husks. Medium bodied; dry and dull. Maintains that Euro-lager feel, however this is a bit more sweet and dry than its counterparts. Just not sold on this one."
"Reflection: This beer was reccommended to me by my girlfriends Grandmother who used to drink it when she was younger. I hope this didn't alter my judgement on it."
"This is a really average beer. but that is not necessarily a bad thing. No skunky odor, taste is a little bland but still pretty refreshing actually. Pretty easy going brew, better than most domestically produced macros, and some overmarketed euro lagers as well. Worth having a few in the fridge for a hot day."
"Pale, clear, yellow color with a short white head. Foam quickly shrinks away, limited lacing. Smell is kind of grassy, slightest amount of hoppiness. Not much for flavor, grainy and grassy, pretty typical. Thin and somewhat watery mouthfeel. Little bit of a metallic aftertaste. Another basic Euro Lager, but at least it isn't in a green bottle."
"Afterall, it's ""By appointment of the Royal Danish Court""....nuff said."
"This beer is sub par. It reminds me more of a crappy North American macro than a European one (which IMO have way more taste generally)."
"Overall this is an OK Euro lager. Nothing special, so you should probably spend your money on a better beer. However, I can see this being a beer for drinking on a hot day or when you're looking for something light, assuming you can't get a better example of the style."
"A bit of a side note: This also might prove to be a decent gateway beer to show the BMC'ers that there are other beers out there that they can drink without shocking them. Then maybe you can sneak in a few more interesting brews and before long, they'll be willing to try the really good stuff."
"Clear light gold, small quickly dissipating head. Skunky nose with barely a hint of malt (or some adjunct). Bland typical euro lager taste. Carbonic bite substitutes for any hop flavor. Thin mouthfeel and just as drinkable as a Heineken or a Budweiser. Not worth the $1.50. Skip it."
"Crisp in the mouth, solid carbonation and a light body. Basically....well, basic. Easily consumed, but without much enjoyment."
"BBE 12-05. No big head and what was there rapidly disappeared. Beercolor is pale gold. hard to take up the smell as it is so bad. Lots of cream, paper and oxidised maltarome's and would say it has quiet some diacethyl in it but hard to be shure as this brew stinks so bad. Taste is litle better but still oxidised maltsoup, sweet and hardly any bitterness noticable. Yuck what a brew; carbonisation is ok but with that taste mouthfeel and drinkability are ruined also. The beer I sampled was brewed at Alken-Maes so hopefully is the Danish version not as bad."
"Label 5/10"
"A run of the mill lager which I would not care to sample again. If your looking for a good euro macro lager, better off with grolsch or beck's"
"Very nice drinkability..its 91 degrees here in Salem and this went down a treat...lucky I bought three more!"
"Summary: Hot day post lawn mowing beer."
"Drinkable but inferior to the average beer of this style. I had a higher opinion of this beer when I first drank it in Europe. Tasting this beer now I recognize how lackluster it really is."
"Drinkability - a decent session beer, you could do worse."
"Had this in St. Petersburg, Russia; it may have been brewed there by Baltic Beverages. Am I being too hard on these pale lagers? After all, they are nothing more than the style dictates. But Ive still had micro pale pilsners that blow these international ""premiums"" away. Alright, this is immedialtely paler and less malty than the Lapin Kulta I just had, but theres a certain smoothness of character that must be acknowledged. It does seem to be free of the adjunct and addictives of an American macro, and it has a nice lacy foam and plays well in a flute glass, and when I set the glass down, it kicks out an attractive stream of bubbles. But while it has nice sensory character, its still just ""beer"" taste."
"Very good lager. Poured out golden yellow with a fine white foamy head. Odors of malt and a touch of cooked corn. Crisp, straight forward lager flavor that I feel many beer advocates will over look and judge as average or bland. Flavors of malt and smooth bitterness along with hints of corn and grains. I really enjoyed this brew and will be buying it again. At 6 bucks a four pack of 16 oz, it's a nice change up. Recommended for lager fans."
"Okay, what can I say? I'm a bit tired of Euro Pale Ales that taste almost exactly the same. Received this in a Beers of the World gift pack and I believe this was the last of the ten I tried. Actually, I gave this to a friend at dinner who wanted a lighter beer but had a taster. Easy to drink and fine after a hot day. However, it's January right now."
"Refreshing club soda like beer, so easy to drink down this water. A little beer taste and sweetness of malt, faintness of a hop. Beats a soft drink. nothing in the way of colour as pale yellow, head, attractive aroma. No aftertaste. A bit aggressive carbonation."
"Better than some macros, but not that good at all. This one poured a typical clear golden color but had a nice white head that stuck around and left a bunch of lace om my glass. The smell was of overly sweet maltiness and not much else. The taste was not too impressive with nothing more than some astringent sweetness and some fuel type flavors. Not recommended at all."
"A clean very pale yellow beer with a big bubbly white head. Has a very light grainy aroma with a hint of skunkiness. There is a light grainy sweetness with only the vaguest hint that hops were even used in making the beer. Another lager who's only purpose is to get people drunk."
"Presentation is a greenish brown glass bottle. I suspect that if the bottle were made of brown glass the skunk aroma noted above would not be present."
"Taste is again grasyy malt with wisps of light floral hops. Lightly metallic and slightly sour. Crisp up front but mellows into a nice creaminess. however it is thin and watery in the mouth. Very light bodied. Well, it's easy to drink, completely unoffensive but lacking in personality. If they beefed up the body and flavor just a bit it would be a solid or at least passable lager. As it is, a medicore and forgettable one."
"Tuborg Premium Lager is a barely drinkable example of a style that I find difficult to like. It isn't bland or insipid, it just isn't any good. Does anyone make a Euro pale lager that's worth a damn?"
"Pale golden body lacks any glow. Its rather dull, actually, but the head, although small, does have a nice soupy appearance. The aroma is oddly minty with a little rice or corn (I cant tell under that other aroma.) The flavor is pretty unpleasant. Its not so much bland and not good. I dont usually pour a beer out, but this one was a drainpour."
"Overpriced European lager for those who also believe Heineken is superior because it costs $11.50CAN a sixer. Pours a pale yellow with a thin film of head. Not much lacing. Bit of a rim on the top where the pour meets the glass, nothing underneath. Smells like wet vegetables. Notably pees, cardboard and sulphur. Sorry, I meant peas, cardboard and sulphur. Tastes bland. Wet bread, basically. Mouthfeel is thin. Drinkable on a hot day, but I'd probably prefer water."
"The after its disinterment pours a crystalline gold color with a purposeful size white and frothy head, as it erodes the lace forms a thin sheet to coat the glass. Nose is malt, lightly sweet, fresh and pleasing to the senses, start has a nice malt presence and is somewhat sweet, the top light in feel to the palate. Finish is light in acidity and the hops peaceful in their spiciness, dry and sweet aftertaste, drinkable and good when you are hot and thirsty."
"Cheers, Denmark, I hope to one day like one of your beers!"
"Wow, this is one Craptacular brew! Talk about skunk in a bottle. Even when I just cracked the bottle cap, a huge waft of skunk came out. The cooked veggie taste is definately there. Definately not worth the price at $1.50 a bottle. The only highlight of this brew was the apperance. It had a nice head that lasted a little while and then thinned out. Other than that, the beer was nasty and I definately know what to stay away from. Makes you wonder what their sub-premium lager tastes like."
"Overall Impression: Basically like a sweeter Heineken. Pretty standard. Nothing special. Much better if you stick the can in the freezer for a little while!"
"A very average, unremarkable beer."
"It was an okay beer to drink with lunch. That is how I had it. I can see me offering it to my friends who like Coors but drink my funny looking beers to be nice."
"To me, this beer actually seemed well made and contained no off flavors. It wasn't the most exciting brew in the world, but it exceeded my expectations (which were quite low). A quaffable beverage, and one of the better all-around Euro-lagers that I've encountered."
"This liquid is a bland, soapy alcohol delivery vehicle. Based on the soapiness and lack of real beer character, it must have been brewed with scalp cleansing in mind."
"Feels a bit watery in the mouth but overall it's average. That pretty much sums up the whole beer. It's not bad but not good."
"Appearance: Slight hazed golden white head with ample lacing. Aroma: Herbal dose of hops with grainy sweetness seems like a Heineken or Carlsberg with less of everything. Taste: The grainy sweetness is reminiscient of a forty of malt liquor, last time I buy a six pack of assorted cheap Euro lagers. Mouthfeel: Thin watery shit. Drinkability: Wouldn't mind if I never saw this beer again wasn't refreshing just bad tasting."
"Packaged in a green bottle, it pours a pale and clear yellow color with a quickly fading white head. Produces almost no lace. Fairly high carbonation. Grassy, noble-hop aroma. Musty European lager aromawith a hint of malt underneath. First sip is sweet and a bit malty. Mid-taste is lager-like and a bit hoppy. Grainy throughout and a watery, uninspiring finish. Its probably above average when compared to other euro-lagers, but thats not saying much. I probably wont be having this one again."
"In appearance a glorious golden colour (especially as the sun is shining through the glass as i'm drinking it) the head doesn't appear to want to hang around for very long but am unsure whether or not that is the fault of my glass. In smell and taste it is remarkably unremarkable even for a lager and this is good or bad depending on what you expect from your beers. If you just want some classly looking but easy drinking swill this is quite a good bet, on the other hand if you would like a beer which is actually interesting then this one ain't it."
"Yawn. Just another one of those."
"Deep green bottle, from which pours a gold-green beer, with almost no head. Smells of malt, fresh cut grass, and grain. Has that euro malt-skunk-grass flavor that is pretty common. Is the first beer that I had from Denmark, and I am not impressed at all."
"-Oelergud"
"very solid session beer this. compared to the crap lagers i could be forcing myself to drink, its not hard to spend an extra buck or two for a half dozen of these. they will go down a whole lot beeter and be far more enjoyable."
"As Euro-lagers go, this is one of the better ones. Rather unique vague floral/fruity notes, almost, but not quite, a distant echo of a Belgian pale. Some grassy and veggy notes detract. Hops bittering bats clean-up and the finish is astringent, but not mouth-puckering so. One of the few beers that is probably better canned than bottled."
"This one came in a 12oz bottle. Poured a clean golden color with a small head that didn't stick around long. The aroma was a little sweet and malty, but not strong in any category. The flavor was slightly skunky but it was fairly dull overall. Nothing exciting here. I was able to drink this beer without much problem, but I don't see myself having it again."
"Clear darker yellow, nice head that laces in snowflake ring patterns, like the grade school cut outs. Strong hop aroma, but not juicy, a trace of sulfur. Flavor begins weakly malty, starts like light brown sugar but then the bottom falls out with subpar mouthfeel. Finishes with an indelicate vinegary quality that's enhanced by the super thin body. I can't give this ordinary drinkability like some Lagers, there's an unpleasant sharp tone to the finish of this brew that spoils the fun."
"I have had this beer before in bottle, and let me say that on tap it is a lot better! It is a relatively boring lager with no special qualities but it went down a damn sight better than the Aussie lagers that were on tap beside it. Generic Euro-lager, but interesting to see on tap in a small town in Australia."
"Came in a 6 pack, poured from a sargasso green 330 ml bottle that makes me pucker in anticipation of skunkiness. Pours out a clear straw colour, minimal head, slight ring. No skunk on the nose fortunately, but instead sweet malt, grass and metal. Sweet hay flavour with a strong metallic presence, somewhat coppery. Body is light, but not overly watery. Hmmmm, overall an average offering, and not one that I would be partaking of too soon, given the vast selection of more palatable average offerings out there. Where's my Big Rock Grasshopper?"
"Notes: Lets say it together one more time  astringent. Yet another boring Euro Lager, dont bother with this one  it is not worth the $7 a six-pack."
"Not much to rave about with this beer as it lacks character and it was dull and boring.It had a large white creamy head with fine-small bubbles.The body was carbonated and clear.The hue was yellow and there was not much lacing.The nose was somewhat metallic and the flavor was blah.The mouthfeel was smooth, watery, thin and light bodied."
"this cheap should not be an option."
"Faint mild malt scent and a pale yellow color. Light malt flavor comes through but this is rather tasteless. Medium bodied. Malty aroma with hay. Neutral taste, I guess. Very short light bitter finish. Hint of metal. Average, but drinkable. Thin swilling beer."
"Drikablility: i'd have to be in the mood for a very light drinking beer."
"Rating  This pale gold/blonde Dane simply does not have enough flavor, body or aroma, therefore it is a bit disappointing. A foamy white head lingers awhile then settles into a thin coating. The thin light roasted malt give very little in the way of flavor or body (sort of a Rice Crispies taste). The mild to medium metallic tasting hops are nothing to write home about. Think mild Heineken, with a dash a seltzer added. Sneaky kick."
"Tuborg sold the trademark to Vena to produce this stuff for the Russian market. They ought to be ashamed. It pours pale yellow, with a white fizzy head that dissipates almost immediately. There's some decent malt in the nose, but the mouthfeel is flat, and the taste all too grainy. There's a mild hop finish, but the aftertaste is just bland, bland, bland. Vena's own product, Nevskoye, is a much better choice."
"Pours a crystal clear golden body with a foamy head of bright-white foam. The head drops shortly but it maintains a consistent 1/16"" surface covering and leaves some very nice lace as well. A combination of grainy malt and herbal hops make up the aroma which is pleasant and inviting. The body is medium/light and couples with a standard level carbonation to leave it gently crisp in the mouth. The flavor is that of almost any basic European lager. The malt and hops meld seamlessly, backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with a lingering note of herbal hop flavor on the tongue. Well made and easy to drink, but lacking in enough character to want you to have more than one or two."
"I had this with pizza. Likely it would have been less enjoyable with no food for company. Better than most macros by a thin margin, except in appearance, which was a real strong point for this little lager from Denmark."
"Sweetish, bland, boring, tastes the same as other beers from this brewer. Typical Danish lager. Relatively crisp, and without much flavour, some adjuncty flavours noticed, with some sweet malts, pretty boring brew that obviously didn't take much effort to brew."
"This is very nice. Starting from its appearance which is a light golden offering with a thick white crown and abundance of glass cling to the taste of bitterness turning to a mild sweetness on the palate. The body is medium light and exceptional..I believe this to be my highest score to date!"
"I think the taste is decent, a nice lager but a little more full bodied than some that I am used to drinking. Mouthfeel is ok too and drinkablity is very good. The beer is a little creamy which for me makes it less of a session beer."
"This beer by far is one of my favourite lagers, next to Warsteiner. There is a slight hay smell, a bit skunked. Tuborg has an amzing mouth feel, creamy, smooth, medium bodied, just a pleasure to drink. There was a decent white head to begin with, then quickly dissapeared after a few mins. Compared to other lagers, Turborg has a much stronger taste, definatly in the ammount of hops used. From what i think, a very refreshing beer, at any time of the year. This is the one and only beer i actually prefer drinking from the bottle."
"Clear golden color with a white thick head.  The smell has a bit of a malt.  The taste is rather pleasing and somewhat bitter at first with a bit of a harsh bite going down.  The drinkability is about average with this type of beer.  Overall, not a bad experiece but it did not stand out from the crowd."
