"Pours a clear golden color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Many bubbles from carbonation.  Yeasty/bready aroma.  Maybe some underlying fruity quality.  Overall, not much to it.  Taste seems a little watered down.  Mainly malty with a small amount of spicy bitterness at the end.  Somewhat tropical fruity aftertaste.  Not bad but not very complex.  Could drink a six pack if there wasn't a better selection, but wouldn't seek it out."

"3/29/15 (Draft - Mo Dailey's Chicago) - Golden light pour, heavy carbonation, nominal white head. Hops and malt sweet aroma.Nice feel, nominal kick. Crisp and clean, bland flavor. Miss Harp from decades past."
"Less taste than Pabst.  Not worth the extra money.  Just ok"

"Not at all as good as I remember from my college days, but those were different days with far less craft knowledge.  Oh well, it was good to give it one last go."

"Harp has always had a soft spot in my heart. It is reminiscent of booze soaked trips to the Barley Mill in Calgary in the mid 90's. I called the trip a ""Millgramige"" because it allowed me to literally soak in several beers that weren't available in my hometown at that time. Harp was then, and is now, a solid Euro lager. It lacks the skunk of many of its green bottle brethren. Instead, Harp has a nice dry malt/hop character. It is eminently quaffable and remains a solid St. Patty's alternative to Guinness."
"OVERALL:  this beer is not like I remember from my college days, this is an inoffensive beer but nothing special, it is better in a Black and Tan so I would probably not order this by itself."
"Sad, very sad."

"Just not a fan of the taste. Something off about it."

"This is not a particularly special beer. It's okay.  Carbonation lasts fairly long, Head draws down to a thin bubbly layer.  Kind of a tangy taste in the mouth.  There are other  imported beers I would purchase before  this one."

"Good beer made in Ireland for export.Guinness stout is all they drink in Ireland."
"Overall, this beer is what it is. It's a generic Euro Lager, but not a particularly bad one. Thin and drinkable. It seems like a sub-par attempt at a Helles, but then again isn't that what this style is all about?"
"very interesting beer. It’s not awful but it’s not super great. It just is quite plain and super drinkable. It’s the best Euro Pale Lager I’ve had. This beer is really hard to describe. It's just a very satisfying beer."

"Poured from can.  Floral and hay aromas.  Clear golden color with with white head.  Very light bitter taste.  Light body, thin texture, and soft carbonation.  Overall and easy drinking crisp brew."
"Overall (3.69) : A good lager representative of the style in spades. I was expecting some Irish weirdness but instead I got a pleasant beer that was both drinkable and enjoyable. Only gripe I have is the piney citrus bitter that's plaguing the drink. It is however reminiscent of a more pleasurable IPA. But since I don't like IPA's in general I'd say, remove that and it's bliss. This was a pleasant experience."

"Pours a clear light gold and leaves decent lacing. Head ain't bad, quick fade. Smell is ok. Some malt and grassy notes. A bit of earth and pepper. Taste is mild malt sweetness. Earth and grass hops. Clean finish with an light tang. Feel is thin and watery with mild and smooth carbonation. Overall a shadow of what is was twenty years or so ago. Sigh."

"Pours a yellow-gold in color with a half-finger foamy white head that settles to just a thin head on top. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip but settles back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of some grains, yeast with a hint of lemon. The taste is actually better than I expected with the grains, yeast coming together nicely with a hint of corn sweetness. Maybe a very light taste of citrus mixed in there also. Well balanced with perfect carbonation. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Really liked this one."

"Harp Lager brewed by Guinness Ltd pours out a nice amber color. This brew has a small white head like most Lager beers. Harp has a skunk smell and that is about it. I'm no big fan of the smell of this brew. The taste is smooth with a little bit at the end. There is nothing bad about this brew taste. Overall I'm impressed on how smooth this beer is, but the smell is not something to be desired. I may get this brew again if I have the chance too. I'm giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall 3.25 is my rating for Harp Lager. I kind of thought it would have more personality, but I enjoyed trying this out. This would be a refreshing brew if you wanted to cool down with a Euro Pale Lager. I might buy this again."

"Pours clear light gold with a thin head that falls fast but tired to leave some lace. Sparkling with bubbles rising upwards. Nose is light grain sweetness and fresh cut hay. A bit of floral but not too much and maybe a small whisper of the lemon peel. Sweet grains make up most of the palate and the hops offer a gentle bit of sweet grass. Some tart and weak lemon in the background. Drinks crisp and clean with a bit of bite on the tongue from carbonation and nice drying to the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good lager. The hopping is nice. I think they could improve the malt body of this beer to give it a cleaner taste. There is a stale, corn, cardboard thing going on in the finish that detracts from this beer's full potential. Overall it's still a decent drink. I would drink it again if offered. But I probably won't be seeking it out."

"D - Kind of vague uninspired pilsner. Better than Heiny or A few of the common euro pale lagers. Don't get me wrong id reach for this before Byd or Heiny but that's not the same as liking it."

"So Harp ... Guinness' paler and perhaps classier little brother. On tap this beer pours a moderately gold honey amber with white head. Aroma is fairly toasty, mellow, with a hint of sweet fermented honey and fruit. Interesting. Taste is the expected grainy sour malt and green grass, but there is more subtle character as well: Some cidery apple, nutty malts, sour rhubarb and almost a tobacco sweetness with more sour fruit and wintergreen notes on the finish, which is crisp and bitter. Overall effect is more ""deep and dark"" than other pale Euros. There are flaws (a touch of skunk, a bit of metal, some acrid booze) but these are muted and fortunately take a backseat. Could be the Irish king of the European macrobeers and good for more than Black and Tans."

""
""
""
""

"This beer has won numerous awards, and it shows. Give this Irish beer a look. Will not disappoint."

"Certainly not a conventional beer for Guinness. Beer goes down smoothly, but lacks a real bite or bitterness. Looks great in a glass, and even pours beautifully out of a bottle. Definitely has a sweetness to it, very palatable to the average drinker. That all being said, there is certainly nothing that stands out about it. A reliable brew for a hot day, or if you're in the mood for something that is slightly different than your average American lager."

"Nice cold 12 oz bottle. This at one time was a top favorite of mine when I could find it on tap. Has the taste changed a little since it has been brewed in Canada? This bottle of beer has a taste that is very agreeable and I am glad I picked up a case."

"apparently brewed in Canada now, so the label doesn't lie when it still reads, ""imported"". I also still enjoy a harp lager from time to time, a little more hearty than some of the American lagers, and certainly more flavorful than the BMC stuff. it pours a glazed copper tinted color, darker than convention, with a short lived white head. the nose is pale euro malts all the way, not sweet but dry, a little adjunct metallic hint, but nothing offensive at all. the taste is bready and grain heavy, I taste a number of different malts. hops? no so much. this beer could use a more aggressive finishing hop, but that's just me. I like all the malt heft without much sweetness, a nice twist away from the generic. fuller body for the style but still easy drinking, especially on a hot day. good carbonation and a flavorful finish. I bet this is remarkable at the original source, and it doesn't travel too bad really..."

"What could pull me in off the street to a dimly lit tavern, on a warm and sunny Northwest afternoon, on a whim? Why, only the prospect of a crisp and clean Harp Lager. More body than most lagers, nice finish. Surprised by how well-laced the pint glass was. Solid brew."
""
"O: Not bad, not great. This is a beer I could see myself grabbing after mowing the lawn or with a cookout in the summer, but no more so than any other mass-produced lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a fluffy head. Bubbles rising constantly from the bottom of the glass tells me this is probably going to be far too carbonated. The aroma is somewhat that of a typical American lager, but Harp has a bready, yeasty note that tells me there’s something more there. There is also a floral aroma from the hops. The taste is slightly sweet with a faint bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is definitely overcarbonated, yet creamy with more body and less dryness than most beers of this style. You’d expect a beer so lacking in flavor would be thin and watery, but not so with Harp Lager. Overall, this isn’t a bad beer, there’s just not enough flavor to satisfy my palate. I should note that the flavor has become a little stronger since it’s warmed, but only a little. Personally, I’m not one to choose beer when I’m hot and thirsty, (there's water for that) but I suppose Harp could hit the spot on a Summer day. Certainly, there are hundreds of worse choices."

"O - Cant say that pale Euro lagers are my thing by any means, but this one appears to be done well enough for the style. That said, it's nothing that moves me in any way, just a bland boring ""beery"" lager. A BMC without the corn and rice. But, any time a pale lager is free of adjunct ""off"" flavors, it's a bonus."

"Not remarkable in any way, the plain Jane of beers. Should come in the proverbial white can with ""BEER"" written on it in big black letters. It makes a decent quaffer when added to Guinness as a half-n-half, and it is not a bad beer, but I never care to drink this on its own. Macrobrew quality, import price."

"As expected this one wasn't a great beer at all, it was drinkable but only just really and not one that I enjoyed at all. A very basic and cheap lager, probably not the worst out there but nowhere near acceptable either."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some plastic-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a weird plastic-like, chemical flavor on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with aromas and flavors that make it hard to drink."

"Pours a vibrant and clear gold, little soapy white cap and some lace. In the nose, clean bready smell and light floral accents. In the taste, bread and biscuit notes, fresh herbal hops and mild but complimentary bitterness. Muted citrus fruit, honey and grass clippings. Light bodied feel with a crisp carbonation. Overall this is a solid, yet average lager. A good session beer with a low alcohol content and very soft yet agreeable flavor."

"Harp is right up my alley. I have accepted that I prefer lagers to all other beers, and Harp has the balance and taste that I enjoy. Not too heavy, and not too light. However, it has to come off tap if you're really going to enjoy it. I'm in Florida, so bottles don't exactly hold up here. Overall, very solid. Anybody that hates mass produced corn beer should enjoy a Harp."

"A nice lager that seems to fluctuate from bottle-to-bottle, keg-to-keg. This was a very pleasing experience. Definitely a harshly rough bittering hop character, but there are a few other nuances to pull out from the taste. Commendable. 3.5"

"This beer pours a clear, bold yellow with a thin head and lace to the end. It's aroma is of lemons and dough with a hint of hay. The flavor is bready with malt sweetness and a note of cake. It's very smooth and the sweetness is not cloying even without a hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is light. Harp Lager is a good beer, a perfect match for Irish Potato Soup and Bangers and Mash. Recommended!"

"Overall - Definitely not worth paying import costs for. You can get similar beers in US for 33%-50% less cost."

"O: A below average lager from a boring style. To be honest I'd take some Miller High Life over this any day."
"D - Highly drinkable, decently built and affordable. One of my standbys for session beers."
"No need to have this one again personally."
""

"Pours pale gold with little evidence of carbonation. Smell has both hops and malt, very light, kind of pear-like. Taste is very, very light. Very drinkable. Very refreshing and as I've just finished a bike ride, just what I wanted. Very balanced, not as ""macro light"" tasting as I anticipated. I'm not sure what that taste is but then again I am. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, slightly carbonated and generally not noticeable unless I'm reviewing. Overall, not bad. Refreshing when its cold and you're hot, I feel it probably goes downhill from there."

"12 oz bottle. Pours clear straw color with a white head and soda-like carbonation. Nose is of grassy hops and hey. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Taste is barely noticeable - of light hops and some grain. Finish is very short. This brew is on par with other macros."
""
"O - I was definitely surprised by this one. More sweetness than I expected, not really any of that adjunct flavor, and a crisp refreshing finish to it. Probably wouldn't seek it out, but if it's around, it's a nice light session lager."

"really liked this beer and will definetly get some again. Good gateway beer for stepping into imports if you have never tried any."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent beer for the style. A step above the other mass produced Euro lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A respectable lager... Fairly quaffable... Fairly sessionable... Not my first choice, but a tolerable alternative to the BMC set..."
"Tastes like a typical lager, too, both sweet and malty. Hints of caramel, and certainly better than the big boys' lagers, but nothing to write home about, either."
""
""
""
"Harp looks like many other lagers- a pale golden yellow. To the nose it brings the familiar smell of liquid bread. It tastes clean and honest-mild hops and subtle sweetness from the malt. It is smooth on the tongue, and not too fizzy. Like many classics, it is simple and good. For me, it would go with most of the foods that I like because of its simplicity. Cheers!"

"O: Pretty decent Euro Lager, best on tap. Better than BMC offerings."
""
""
"Overall - What we have here is just a nice tasting well balanced lager. I'm not sure it's worth the 'import' price of 7.50$ a pint though. Not something I'd buy again at a bar based on the price that's for sure."
""
""
""
""
""

"Another 500 mL can. I've had several different EPLs over the past few nights, and Harp is not really a standout amongst them. That being said, there's nothing wrong with this as a lager at all (other than maybe the price point). I'm going to leave the grade as-is... this is a respectable Euro lager that is worth a try if you're into the style."

"O: If this beer were an employee, I'd give it a Meets Expectations as a review grade. It's not a superstar, but it's a solid performer that gives you what you expect; good taste and drinkability, and you want it to show up the next day. I wish I'd had a slice of pizza with this; that would have gone perfectly. Off to make a Steak-Umm sandwich for my next beer. Until next time."

"On tap at Tir na Nog outside Penn station in NYC. Golden hue with slight amber capped by a foamy head. Nose of grass and straw. Taste is slight hay balanced by light cracker sweetness. Mouth is light but drying. This is a good way to await a train ride back upstate."
""
"Overall: I have drank this many times and it is probably better during warm weather and served cold. Not a bad beer but definitely not among the great ones, this goes for other ""lagers"" alike. Hope you enjoy, salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very average beer. This is the first time I have had this and I was thinking that it was going to be hard to drink and watered down like the American and Euro Lagers I have had in the past, but this actually has some umf to the flavor. I would not seek it out but I would drink it if it was offered."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is very nice on this Euro lager. I am usually not a fan of this type of beer. Harp does not have the sharp, ""skunk"" hop taste a beer like a Stella has. It is much more drinkable and a lot better."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great outdoor beer to drink in quantity while smoking some meat over mesquite."
""
""
""
""
"O: uh, decent for the style, unsure if I would have this again"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This might be the best Euro Pale Lager I've ever had - but that's not saying much. The lack of skunky scents and tastes makes this one a better option than others in the style, but it's far from interesting. Quaffable and inoffensive."

"This is one of my starter beers that has a little bit of flavor. The beer pours a nice golden color with a nice white head. The smell has a bit of hop and malt. The taste is pretty enjoyable with a decent amount of hops. The mouthfeel is nice with a decent amount of carbonation. Overall this beer is decent, but not great. It is not a bad session beer and I would drink it again if it was at a party or on sale."
"Overall: Well, its just okay. Honestly, there is very little manufested taste to be had. However, and I say this assuringly, I would take Harp over any Big Three lager/pilsner ANY day of the week. It is very refreshing and drinkable, highly recommended for celebration/tailgating beer. Cheers"
"O- This beer looks and smells like an adjunct lager but has the taste and mouthfeel of a Czech pilsner to me. Very refreshing and I would recommend this beer to others. Definitely fits the bill for when you want something light and refreshing"
"Pours a golden color,producing a respectable head,that lingers well.Malty scent for such a clear beer,liked the malts dominating the hops in this beer. No aftertaste,smooth and refreshing! I may mix this with a Guinness, instead of Bass, for my next Black&Tan."
"O - friend of mine brought this to a bachelors party, it wasn't bad but it was the last pack of beer to be finished"
"Very nice bold golden color,producing a respectable top,even with a bad pour. Continued to bubble and come alive as it sat waiting to be drunk. Surprising me again with a malty robust odor for such a clear golden beer,and the taste was even better. Loved the malts dominating the hops in this beer. No after taste,smooth thirst quinching experience and even better with a barbeque sandwich!"
"I enjoyed it and recommend giving it a try!!"
"For a euro pale lager this one isn't bad."
"O - Not bad. A little better than expected. I might revisit this beer again in the future. Maybe by a single or two but I doubt I would buy a six pack."
"Overall it's average in my book."
"O - The six pack grew on me a little bit. When I first tasted it, I thought it was just a big waste of money and I was going to pawn them off to my dad or party guests or something. I ended up liking them more as I drank them mostly because there actually are some hops and bitterness in the finish that you don't get with most other Euro Lagers."
"Notes: trainwreck of a beer. As bad as any AAL from BMC."
"Overall: Decent amount of flavor for a lager."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is about what I expected - full of grain with a little bit of bread and a tad bit of grass from the hops. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of grain and not too much else. There is the slightest amount of bitterness from the grassy hops but the beer is pretty sweet and malty. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours a pale, golden color with dissipating head that leaves lacing around the glass. Smells of hops, I wouldn’t call it ""fruity."" It tasted of hops, very slight sweetness, followed by a little malt presence and a dry, crisp, slightly bitter finish. Not a fan of pale lagers, and this didn’t change my opinion, though it is a lot better than most mass-produced American lagers."
"A refreshing and enjoyable beer."
"Overall it's alright but probably one to pass on I think from now on."
"produced in mass quantities, give me a PBR over this one."
"Poured a huge 4"" white head which lasted awhile. Pale clear straw yellow color. Smells of grass and just barely the beginning of skunking. Taste is any standard BMC with corn and a short finish. Basically this is the Guinness' version of mainstream lagers probably with enough artificially jacked up carbonation to appear a step up."
"Pours a solid straw yellow with a 2 finger head that turns to a lace quick with some good retention. A Earthy, grainy, sweet malt, and faint citrus. Grainy maltiness on the tongue, sour, lemon soap bitter on the finish. Light in the mouth, crisp, enjoyable aftertaste, light bodied. Overall, this beer is decent, its got its sense of drinkability. Very bland for its style moving it to the back of the line when reaching for a Euro Lager."
"O: Have not had this beer in a few years, and I haven't been missing much. Pretty standard mass produced lager. Decent ice cold on a hot day, but drink it quickly, since there is not much to savor. When I visited Ireland in late February last year, this beer was not as prevalent as I had expected it to be. Not much better locally there either from what I recall, but it was a change of pace from Guinness Draught, or a Bulmers."
"So Harp lager poured out as a clear golden yellow color with a pretty nice looking head on it. The lacing isn't the best in the world but there is some on the glass. The smell of fresh grains with a earthy sweetness on the nose. The flavor is nice in my opinion, I find this beer to be one very good lager. The mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing. Overall I enjoy this beer from time to time and I find it to be a great social drinking brew."
"Its ok and easy to drink on a hot day."
"O- i really do enjoy this beer. this is one that i can just sit down and enjoy. very balanced. not to much of anything. not the best but definitly a good well rounded beer."
"This beer has a really clean taste. It is quite hoppy for the style, which is nice. There are some slight malty notes, but the hops are the most prevalent aspect of the flavour. It's a nice change from any other lager, and definitely refreshing but with a bit of bite too."
"D: If this was any more average it would just say ""beer"" on the label."
"nothing worth going out of the way for."
"This was an average beer, not bad for a hot day but not really enough to want to drink again."
"At the very least its a decent choice when pickings are slim. But at best it drinks like a half-way decent lager."
"I favor English stouts and ales however this lager is special. Earthy aromas greet the nose and lighten the feel of this lager. it is refreshing and also somewhat complex if you pick apart its flavours of corn, grass. Given its pedigree I expect more and want more. It is good but being that its from Guinness I expect the highest."
"Mouthfeel is thin and drying and this is appropriate. Overall this beer is a good standard lager. Not too much to write about its plain and drinkable."
"Dr: 4.6% on tap is rickockulous for Galway. It's not popular in Ireland, and is the biggest disappointment to come out of the Guinness factory."
"A smooth, satisfying lager by your Irish friends, and certainly a notch or two above most pale lagers. Pours a clear, straw color with little to no head; some carbonation visible. Grainy aroma and light malts. Crisp, light malt taste, grains, sweet corn, and a hint of hops. Weak overall, but not unbearable or terrible. Light, crisp mouthfeel, and can be refreshing and drinkable. For extremely casual imbibing."
"Pours a clear straw color with good carbonation and medium size head. The aroma is of some mild grainy malt with a little hop presence. There is sweet and butteriness even a little sticky mouthfeel from this brew. Very cereal grainy taste comes throughout the brew."
"Bottle"
"Overall, well color me perplexed, because I don’t get this beer. It is thoroughly unimpressive and lacking in uniqueness and complexity. I would, with 100% certainty, turn down the next free Harp I am offered."
"Pretty uninviting overall, to me."
"This beer enjoyed on tap at Tigin Irish Pub in DFW airport. Pours a clean gold color with a layer of head with little retention but does leave some lacing as you drink. The aroma consists of grassy hops and light malt. The taste is has hints of grassy hop a skunky characteristics before becoming crisp with malt. The mouthfeel is ok... Could use a little more carbonation on the tap I was drinking, but definitely finishes crisp."
"O: This beer would be slumming it for many BAs. It's not at all awful, but it's definitely lower half of the curve. This is a beer I default to at pseudo-Irish pubs. There's really just a hint of corn in it, I think."
"Appearance is a light golden with a faint head and nil lace. Smell has a clean grian and adjunct aroma with malt in the background. Taste of rice, grains and the hops leaving a bitter dry finish in the end. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. I'm Not to excited about it, but I would like to try it on tap at the source."
"So I got this in honor of saint Patrick's day and I was pretty satisfied although a wee-bit on the pricy side. When I pored it into the pint glass it was a little on the pale side for my taste and the smell was a tiny bit weak. The taste was very distinct and very tasty. I had a bit of trouble pounding that shit down (in which is my normal method of drinking). Overall I say a very fine beer and worth a drink."
"A solid European lager, but not fantastic. Probably goes better when paired with Guinness... or food... or both."
"Pours a pale golden hue with a thick head, some lacing, and ample carbonation. Looks like a typical adjunct lager. The smell is of malt and sweet cornsyrup with a touch of hop bite at the end. Reminds me a lot of miller high life. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a touch of bite from the carbonation. An uncomplex beer that tastes very much like an adjunct lager."
"It has a light crisp taste to it something I could drink sitting out back on a nice warm spring/summer day! Over all Its much better then BMC but have had better lagers. Example: Rouges Irish Style Lager!"
"After hearing all the hype I decided to pick up a 6-pack. My expectations were not met, however I was completely satisfied. Saying this beer lacks in flavor is a insult, I think its just a plain lager. Although its plain it makes up in the drinkability. You can drink tons of these making it a great beer. The smell and appearance is great, and the mouthfeel is okay, but overall this is a fantastic beer. I don't think its a recipe that can even come close to half of the reputation that Guinness has made for itself. Pick some up you won't be disappointed. Also they say this is better on tap so try that out too. Stay thirsty my friends."
"More dry and bitter than most Euro or domestics and easy to drink, but quite forgettable."
"I feel odd reviewing this beer as I feel most everyone in the world has had it at this point. It's a lager. It's not particularly great. It is the only beer I've successfully made a Black & Tan with so for that reason I will hold it dearly in my heart."
"The taste is rather non-descript in that nothing stands out very much. It's a very clean beer, really. Unlike other Euro lagers, it isn't heavy on the skunkiness or grains. The body has small notes of grain and a little citrus. Pretty goid hop bite at the end for style. Crisp. Not bad, if not a little boring."
"Pours a pale golden amber with a semi-quickly diminshing head. Scent of standard wheat and malts mixture. Taste is mediocre with a very grassy grain taste to it. A little bit of an after taste but nothing too strong. A decent beer to celebrate the Irish in you, but nothing all that fantastic."
"Aaaahhh....Guinness blonde headed step child. Harp is a very taste beer for those who can't stomach the real goods...yeah that's right the real good....Guinness! Harp is a tasty alternative to going the distance. The color is golden/pale yellow with white foam. no aroma solid taste, and it is an easy session beer!"
"This is somewhere between a yawn and an ugh. Even on future St.Patty's Days, this will not be worth revisiting."
"Overall- Its just a boring beer. If i want something refreshing i would much rather drink a nice German pilsner."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a crystal clear, straw-gold color with a chunky, white, big bubbled foam head. Aromas of toasted oats and light malty notes. The beer is round and a little oily slick in mouth, with slightly sour-malt flavors and a very light hop flavor to balance. Also some cereal type flavors. The beer has an extremely quick finish, with only trace sour notes on the aftertaste. The beer is extremely easy to drink, and goes with just about anything."
"Overall - beer #1 on my way to pakistan! sitting in the AC lounge, access to my own taps, this is living. Good beer, simple and refreshing. This ones for you SpinRSX!"
" A very drinkable lager that does not overfill, but has a refreshing effect."
"Tastes of an sweeter lager; good bittering balance with malt. Clean and easy drinking. Low spec malt. Okay for a staple beer is one appreciates Euro lager."
"The beer was a pale, clear, golden color with a thick, bubbly, white head. It smells of grass and lemon with nutty undertones. The taste consists of bread and grass with a lemony, hoppy aftertaste. The beer is light without being watery, it prickles the tongue and leaves the mouth dry. I thought this was an above average Euro lager, look forward to making a black & tan later."
"D- An easy drinking beer, and easily sessionable, but little about it that's all that distinguishable from other Euro Lagers."
"D - You can certainly throw a few of these back, just nothing special or standout about this beer at all. Probably can get equal quality for much less $$$"
"Pours a clear golden yellow with lots of head up front finding a thin medium after about a minute. Lacing is pretty cool, makes rings on the glass as i drink it and leaves a consistent lAce all around. Smells of livht malts and slight hops. Tastes kind of citrusy with a little hop right off the back of the tounge. The carbonation is not shy and leaves a dryness in my mouth that mAkes me want to drink another gulp."
"Pours a very light straw pale yellow color with a thin white head and very little lacing. Smells of pale malts and a little corn or grain. Very mediocre. Tastes of pale malts a little noble hop and some slight grain. Mouthfeel is medium and it has a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"Pretty interesting this lager is...its very fizzy and has a wheat taste to it...leaves a citrus aftertaste which is nice and id recommend this for people who like lagers to try...its interesting...."
"Not the most adventurous beer by a long shot, but when it comes to (if you'll forgive the term) continental lagers, you can do a lot worse."
"Taste is dry. The flavors don't feel ""natural," no sweet malts, no earthy hops or bitter hops. It's a dry beverage with quite a lot of carbonation. The mouthfeel is OK and drinkability would be fine. A decent choice to replace American macro lagers, and an OK choice for this Euro style. But nothing stellar."
"I'm not a huge fan of lagers but this could be a nice summer refresher."
"Pours a clear gold with a one finger white head that quickly diminishes. Has a pils like aroma. Has hints of citrus and bitterness. Carbonation is very active. I detect some sourness that lingers for a short while. This is a step above most Pale Lagers made by the Macro-Brewers. I'd drink this one again with no problem."
"Usually poured in pint glass often as a half-half pour with Guinness. Pours a clear, faint yellow body with a fine, white head. Light sheeting of lace on the way down. Faint aroma of vaguely grainy maltiness with a thin whiff of Noble hops. Tastes of light pale malts with an equally light cereal sweetness and touch of grain. Expect no more than a hint of floral, spicy hops and bitterness, which remains for the drying finish. Light-bodied; medium carbonation. A tad watery. An enjoyable cheap pale lager at an Irish pub."
"Remember, beer-people...this is a LAGER. It's a narrow flavor profile, so judge it accordingly!"
"D- A bit too controlled & encapsulated. Drinkable, but uninspiring."
"This is a very light beer. It reminds me of some of our average american commercial beers. Nothing special, very boring beer. I will not have this again."
"Not a bad beer really. At it's best when really cold. Refreshing bitter lager."
"Pours a super-duper clear, ultra-lite golden yellow. My sample had a pretty white head that stuck all over the glass. Smell was expectedly mild, some biscuit. Taste was nicely complex, in a mild sort of way again. Some tasty light toasted malts and some Euro bitters. Feel was active and smooth, crisp and refreshing. Drinkability high. I'm glad I tried this brew again - it'd be a worthy choice in a place that may not have a massive beer selection."
"D: Highly drinkable session beer, goes down easy. Would really only drink this if I was throwing back a few and the taste doesn't matter. It's not bad, it's just average."
"RJT"
"For a lager I have no complaints this is what I'd expect a lager to taste like. Has a pleasant grassy smell with a bit of a grassy taste followed by some hops. Poured gold with a white fuzzy volcano. I'm not a big fan of lagers but this one is doable and pretty enjoyable."
"Beer is thin and watery. It has almost no forward sweetness and some sulfur and grains in the mid and late palates. It goes down like water too, but its harsh on the ending with a lingering aftertaste."
"Nice clear golden color.Builds a small head which disappears fast and leaves little lacing. The smell hints a little apple as well as sourdough. That feel continuos after tasting this well carbonated beer. Nicley balanced and smooth finish. Good mass production lager."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle LO237NE2-02:41. A highly carbonated but nice and clear golden yellow pour with a little head that sticks around. The aroma smacks of grains, corn, and vague hops. The body is pretty good and comes in at about medium texture. The taste is clean and fresh with a solid balance of corn and barley malts and hops. A better macro lager than most."
"Pours a moderate golden color. White head and a slight amount of lacing. The nose is some light malt and bread with a tad bit of sweetness. The taste is mostly some light bread. Light to medium feel with good carbonation. This drinks fairly well, but works better in a black and tan."
"Drinkability: Could have a few of them. Would rather have it layered with Guinness."
"D- A very nice easy drinking beer. Always my choice when I go to this bar. Selection isn't that great there but this is the best of the selection."
"Splitting a pitcher or this. Pours a golden orange colour with thick white head. Smells mostly of grassy hops. I'm surprised how hoppy it is actually. Nice bitterness in the flavour. Medium carbonation level. Easy to finish off half a pitcher, as I just did."
"Had this beer on-tap at Finnegan's Wake in town for lunch. Came out a crystal clear pale gold with a thin white head on top. Light lace left behind. The nose was basic: some light grains, buttered-bread, faint hops. Nice crisp clean mouth on it. Refreshing. Nice grainy breads in the flavor, hints of bitter hops, and a smooth sweet finish. This paired very well with my Irish fare. Not a bad beer. I liked it."
"This pours a nice pale golden color with a decent white coarse foam head. The aroma is rather malty, most is actually a nice light caramel notes, but there is a hint of corn syrup in the back. The taste has a bit of citrus up front and is malty and smooth. Then there is a astringent bitterness that attacks in the aftertaste that isn't the greatest. The mouthfeel suffers due to this astringency. But it is well carbonated and smooth in viscosity. It is a fairly good drinking beer."
"Drinkability- its easy drinking but somehow the more i hate the less i really was rapidly desiring more, just something boring and kind of bland about this beer, i mean dont get me wrong its not a flawed beer but just kind of simple and bland, is it better then alot of american macros yes but not by an extremely large margin and far and away from being able to stand up with some of the better European lagers"
"Id like to try this again just to see if the tap was messed up, because flavor was really lacking."
"drinkability: average yet quality of ingredients is evident, it is very drinkable for the style and pleasant overall."
"Worth your money, definitely a different beer."
"All in all, a good example of a Euro lager."
"Verdict: A decent middle of the road beer."
"Drinkability: A sub-standard lager. There's nothing here to really distinguish this beer from other macro lagers. All in all, it's probably overpriced since it's imported and made by Guinness so I'd definitely look elsewhere."
"Well, it's a straw colored, a bit of a head but noting impressive, good carbination. It's got some hops and grain and earthy aromas in the nose. The taste is much the same. Just enough hops to keep it interesting and a bit of earthy grainy flavors I""ve come to expect out of beers from that region. It's not bad if you ignore the huge price tag most bars seem to think it deserves. Certainly not above average or anything but it's got flavor and you can sit back and have a few."
"More Quizzo beer. Yes. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn, light corn syrup, very light citrus, and some light florals. The taste is very similar, though with some greens and heavy notes of flowers and corn chips. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a decent brew, nothing all that special, but drinkable enough to get at a slightly discounted price during Quizzo."
"My pour resulted in a thick fluffy white head of two inches, which took about two minutes to settle down to a light covering. Broken lacing around my glass with not much clinging power. Rates a 6 on the color chart, a light amber with good clarity. Distinctive hop and malt smell. Good flavor with a pleasing bitter bite, but not overwhelming. A little twang on the tongue and palette and pleasing aftertaste. Crisp and flavorful, this is a good choice for a pleasing time at the grill or even yard work. I would recommend this beer to friends who like something with a little more flavor than the basic backyard brew."
"A fairly pale color with a decent head that recedes slowly. Smell is fairly sweet, floral in a way and overall pleasant. Lacing is light but noticeable. The taste is very watery and carbonated. I feel there should be more going on - based on the smell in particular - but there isn't really. On the positive side there is a little bit of hops and a pinch of malt. I really liked Harp for a while but didn't drink it for a year and my tastes must have changed. It is refreshing but there are better examples of the style."
"D: Versatile, drinkable, easy on the stomach and nice to look at on the one hand; not very compelling and import pricing on the other."
"Guinness isn't a bad brew, but Harp is more commercially accessible. It's not an overwhelming smack-you-in-the-face hopped-up brewski, but at the same time it is definitely not your average run-of-the-mill mass-produced swill-water. For what it's supposed to be, it's nearly dead-on. I like it and would recommend it to a friend."
"Cheers!"
"As far as lagers go, this one's not too bad. Nothing complex, but it's got a nice balanced flavor."
"Drinkability: Goes down nicely on a hot summer day."
"Pretty basic...sweet grains with a light hop balance. Really though, not a bad lager at all. Body is fairly light, but it has a nice mouthfeel, decently creamy. This bottle seems to be better than the few times I have had this on draught, fresher with a crisper hop finish. I bought this out of the singles bin on impulse, I didnt expect it to be one of the better Euro lagers I've had this year."
"Tastes sharp hop bitter and carbonation over a non-descript malt sweet. Hop bitter is light, crisp, and very has a mineral edge. Carbonation is strong on the pull and stings in the finish. Malt flavor is pils. Mouthfeel is modest and very drying due to the hop and carbonation cleansing effects. Not much in the way of complexity, but there shouldn't be according to this style. Pretty yummy, I could easily drink another. Too bad about the sulfur nose, this beer would have scored much higher."
"D: Not a terrible Euro lager, I wanted a little more hop character and depth of flavour, but what are you going to do. There's plenty worse out there."
"D: Easily drinkable. Good balance."
"Smell is subdued. Slightly flowery, lemon and butter. Taste is the same. This is a simple, quality brew, counter to one's conceptions of Irish brews, quite light and clean but not having the elegance of a Pilsner Urquell, on the one hand or any kind of complexity on the other. Nice beer, just nothing special."
"very easy to drink.. this brew was a little more than i expected.."
"D - Oh Jeez, very easy to drink, especially on a hot day."
"Served in its own glass which was a tall beaker. A half finger fine white head which soon diminished to a ring. Lots of fine lacing. Well carbonated clear amber. Malty smells. Taste was mild overall with malt up front and a hop finish. Malt flavours. Nice balance. Crisp mouthfeel. The drinkability was up there. Much better than I expected from a major."
"Poured from the bottle, cold, into the pint glass, this is a crystal clear pale gold color with a fair white fuzz cap and a bit of lacing to go with it. The aroma is simple wheat with tangy yeast, not overpowering, not wonderful, but fine for a lager. The first taste brings a slight citrus hop bread deal. Although it has a nice effervescence and a dry hoppy finish, the feel is a bit watery. The lemony hop dominates the front of your tongue to the finish but it leaves a more metalic quality at the back of your mouth, even though this one was from a bottle. The hop bite doesn't have much flavor characteristic and the basic bread idea gets lost in a wimpy feeling liquid. It's certainly drinkable enough, like most lagers but it leaves a bit of a rancid aftertaste, like green compost, though that's being overly dramatic. Before I discovered better beer and bigger beers, I always though Harp was a reasonable brew, but I would say that may be a little generous these days. It'll work but it won't satisfy the taste buds overly."
"In Belfast growing up, this was one of the cheapest beers available and now drinking it in the airport when I leave Belfast it is marketed as upmarket and here in Canada it is pushed as a fancy Irish lager."
"Overall: I actually appreciate this beer. I've only had it once, but it works as a nice changeup to your stereotypical Irish stouts."
"D - Better than standard Pale Lager fare, but still fairly boring. It has a bit of character, and I could occasionally enjoy one if I was in the mood for something light, but I'm certainly not rushing back to buy more."
"The fruity character of this beer really saved it from being below standard. But overall, it's nothing special and overly priced."
"Drinkability: OK. I've had better examples of this beer. Will try again."
"D: Has session potential, but the watery carbonation is too much."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear yellow with a big fluffy white head that retains well and has good lacing. Kind of a neutral aroma. A typical lager taste slight skunky after taste. Back in my college days this was one of my go to beers. I guess my taste has changed or Harp has changed. Just have better memories of it back then."
"D- If you can tolerate the weak aroma and flavor, then I suppose this would be quite drinkable. I would prefer to drink water. An average drinkability rating would be fitting then, I guess."
"It was enjoyable, but I wouldn't order again."
"Altogether a nice beer, although I question where its niche is - it's doesn't go down like a light beer, it's not breadlike like a stout, and it's not hoppy-strong like a pale ale. More like a light stout than anything else."
"Good carbonation and fair body that allows you to get the most flavor possible out of this one. A holdover from St. Patrick's Day, this is one that you reach for when facing much less approachable choices. It's ok, but not great."
"Overall, nothing special, fairly average, drinkable lager."
"Easy to drink. I didn't have high expectations, but this wasn't half bad. Decent enough choice for a Euro Lager."
"D- A highly sessionable beer; great for a game night."
"Nice looking beer. Clear and bubbly with a fairly thick head that retains rather long and laces a bit. Smell is faint. Light floral and a bit grassy. Light hop profile mixed with a decent malt flavor make for a nice palate. Medium body with a crisp feel. Enjoyable beer but not great."
"I vaguely remember this being much better long ago but that is probably because it was on tap and at the Guinness toast."
"Fairly standard lager pour and aroma...nothing too bold. Fresh and clean with none of the aftertastes of most macro lagers. Somewhat more substantial mouthfeel than most macros but still a little heavy on the carbonation. Overall, very drinkable but I would not seek it out again."
"A familiar flavor that tastes best when a 1/2 and 1/2 with Guinness. It can really standup to the boldness and smooth out the total taste."
"D- I'll pass on this one not too impressed with this one. Just plain pretty boring."
"this was easy to drink. ive always liked Harp over the other two (guinness and smithwicks) as it has a much fuller body and more flavor. it's my go to when there really is nothing else left."
"D: Very drinkable, it's low on flavor and alcohol so it can be paired with a lot of things."
"Harp doesn't have an outstanding rating on here, but I was a little surprised by it. I thought it was a very respectable lager. Harp has some decent flavor, but nothing overwhelming. It doesn't have much of an aftertaste either. You pretty much get what you are expecting: a decent imported lager."
"Harp Lager by Guinness pours a light amber color, with a slightly small head. The the smell isnt too strong, it kinda of reminds me of the new Sam Adams Noble Pills. The taste is a bit light, but still has some flavor too it. The light taste, with no after taste does make this easy to drink. Overall I felt its not a bad beer at all, I personally prefer heavier lagers, but this is a nice change every once in a while."
"Pours golden with a fluffy white head. Good retention and pleanty of laceing. Aroma is grainy,with maybe some grassy hops. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is a decent balance of bready malts and grassy earthy hops. Decent finish, but pretty much an average tasting lager."
"I love this beer. It has a golden color that has quite a bit of carbonation. It also leaves a nice lace on the glass as it is being drank. The smell is good with a hint of skunk and a followed by grain with a light hops hint. The tast is great it finishes with a crisp bite of hops. The mouthfeel is good kind of slick on the palate. The drinkablility is superb goes down smoothly!!"
"Taste had quite a bit of metallic, and plenty of yeast. Lacked any significant body or flavoring to speak of, just kind of tasted like beer. I may have just expected better, but I just wasn't pleased with the product. Only real benefit was that it was quite watery, which made it pretty easy to drink...but then again, why bother?"
"D: Goes down easy and isn't too heavy so you can have a lot."
"Drinkability suffers here because why would you spend so much money on a beer that tastes closest to nothing?"
"It looks better and is far more refined in smell, mouthfeel and drinkability."
"12 oz brown bottle to glass. No obvious freshness date, it was from ""genuine Irish recipe"" but imported from Canada. Golden yellow, nice tight foamy head. The smell was the best part I thought, really fresh, zesty, almost like a Champagne-yeast smell, hard to tell if its hops or yeast. Taste is pretty clean and tame, a little malt and a little hops. Carbonation is a little fizzy but basically appropriate for this style. Pretty good."
"D: A great lager. There's absolutely no excuse to drink BMC lagers when this is so widely available."
"This is the first Harp I have sampled in a few years, and is easily the most tasty I have ever encountered."
"Served in a pint glass it has a 10 mm white head that leaves plenty of lacing. The appearance is clear and pale straw. The aroma is malty and of light spicy hops. The taste is lightly malted with mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is light with moderate to strong carbonation and a perfectly clean finish. This is a very drinkable beer; to be preferred over most of the standard fare one finds in restaurants."
"I had tried this beer many years ago and loved it. I I just tried it again recently and it was still a pretty good a solid lager. for me its a go to beer if there is nothing better around, as it is very easy to drink. Somewhat sweet with a nice little bit of bitterness."
"D: An extremely drinkable lager."
"Deep straw gold with two fingers of fine, fluffy, white head. That head fades away somewhat quickly, but leaves behind a beautiful lace as it does so. Sparkling carbonation. Smells of cereal grains with lemon, green apple, and a little bit of dry grass. Tastes of cereal with a grassy finish and just a hint of the lemon found in the nose. The grassy finish gets a bit bolder as the beer warms. Mild bitterness. Light bodied; not thin. Spritzy carbonation. A decent lager with a clean, simple profile."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, yeast, and very slight citrus. Fits the style of a Euro Pale Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast, slight grain, and hint of hops. Overall, a subpar euro pale lager."
"cheers!"
"this beer is an industry standard in my books, nothing wrong with it but nothing worth bragging About"
"Golden yellow in color, fluffy yet quickly diminishing white head. Smell is of carmel and pale malts. Taste is of carmel and pale malts, minimal hop presence and a faint sulfury lager bite. body is medium, despite a slight overcarbonation it is creamy. Nothing sounds too special here, but it doesn't do anything wrong and fits it's style perfectly."
"A well rounded Lager. Color is golden/amber. Nicely hopped. Good carbonation and better than average head retention. Full flavored. Like this one a little colder than some lagers. Good balance of alcohol content and flavor. Does not have a sharp aftertaste like some. And hey....this one has a classic sister!"
"D - Good overall. Especially compared to its American counterparts. Could tone down the corny flavor."
"This used to be my favourite European beer when I was young and naive. Oh how could I have been so stupid. Nothing against Harp but there are so many better brews from across the pond. Skunky smell like wet newspaper. Taste is crisp with a little malt and a little bitter aftertaste. Overall it's quite forgettable with no distinguishing aspects."
"Just blah and bland. Not the worst thing ever, but nothing I care to have again."
"The taste is light grain with light herbal/grassy hops, light mineral water, sweetish followed with light, clean herbal bitterness and clean grain aftertaste. It has lasting light flavour, bitterness, and sweetness, a with a bit more hop character, and a light Euro quality to it compared to US basci pale lager. However, the Euro character is lighter than others."
"Overall its not a bad beer. It doesn't blow away the taste buds buts it's not intended to. Flavors are muted but well balanced. Decently sessionable, but I'd prefer something a little more flavorfull."
"D: Very drinkable you can have several of these and your palate will stay intact. However once you have drank one you get the concept from then on out."
"Pours a pale gold color with a one finger head that goes away quickly to very little lacing. The aroma is rather weak and simple, your basic ceral and corn malt. The taste is slightly watery and has a ceral/corn malt backbone, there is really no hop presence. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and a little too rough around the edges. Overall this is a beer that like the phillies is one and done, it comes off as simple and weak."
"D - This is my go to session beer when I'm out not the most exciting beer out there just a good easy to drink lager"
"This beer pours a pale gold color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of cereal malt, with a hint of spicy hops. It is a pleasant aroma. However, it lack complexity, and leaves some to be desired. The taste is a bit stronger than the aroma which is nice, but it is still very simple. The mouthfeel is thin even for the style with a watery texture, and high carbonation. Overall, it is probably been five or six years since I drank this beer, and now I am reminded that there was a reason for that. It isn't the worst beer around, but with so many great beers out there I can't see myself drinking this again."
"D: Like I said, goes down really easy. Always good to have something like this on hand for when it's really hot or you just want to tune off while drinking, but there isn't a whole lot to it, really. Still, a much better choice than a lot of your typical lagers."
"Solid Lager."
"D- Good session brew, or on a hot day like yesterday."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: I really like this beer. I've had it before this review, and I'll get it again. It's certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability - quite good, and my opinion is that this beer is best for meals. It's something that goes really well to wash down a meal. I should probably try it by itself sometime to see how it is, but every time I've had it, I've had it with a meal (both on tap and in bottle) and I've felt it is a good part of the meal."
"Drinkabilty-classic example of a European Pale Lager, easy to drink"
"D: Maybe it's because I was dying of thirst when I drank it, but this really hit the spot. As far as pale lagers go, you can certainly do a lot worse."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Clean, light aroma. Has a good, crisp taste with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Feels somewhat creamy in mouth. Very drinkable beer and overall a pretty good choice."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer that is easy to drink. I didn't remember it being this good. This is a great Summer beer."
"I suppose that most Euro-type lagers are greeted with a bit of imbiguity these days but for those of us who prefer blondes, this brew is among the better ones I've had. It has a light-golden color to go along with a crisp, malty taste. It has a typical Euro bitter finish but it carries well because of the barley. Harp isn't as watery as some other commercialized Euro lagers and has a pretty damn good mouthfeel with a splendid finish. Guinness did a good job with this blonde and I intend on making her a regular every weekend."
"Grabbed a pint at the Black Rose. Served in an imperial pint glass. Small head that faded quick. Lots of carbonation. Faded yellow color. Smelled a bit musty. Tasted like an average lager. Hints of corn and malt in the taste, not much in terms of hops. Moderately crisp aftertaste. I could see how some people could make this a session beer as it's pretty light. Almost too thin in my opinion. Not me, though, as the flavor was just too boring. Even though you can find Harp everywhere, on most occasions I'll opt for another choice."
"Not a bad beer. A great lager that has a little more bitterness than you'd traditionally find in a similar brew. The carbonation might be my only complaint because it really ""foams"" in your mouth, even with the smallest sip. With that being said, great alternative to traditional Irish food when it might be a little too hot out for a Guinness (those times are few and far between...)"
"This one's pretty drinkable, though you'll find plenty better. I liked this better than I did from the bottle."
"Drinkability: Overall I liked it but wasn't blown away by this. I'd have it again though."
"I could drink a few of these, not offensive at all, easy drinking."
"D: This is a very average lager, its not a bad beer. I'd say it is a little better than Bud, but average over all."
"uh, I guess I don't much like this type of beer, but this seemed especially bitter and sour. a flavor of more balanced hops or a sweetness I feel is important in these types of beers, to balance out everything."
"Better than most American Pale (Adjunct) Lagers. Probably average for Euro Lagers."
"D: Easy drinking lager, pretty standard for the style. I would have liked a richer flavor from the malts, but it is what it is."
"Just not my kinda beer, I could definitely see some people totally diggin' it though."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is grainy with some hops and some sweetness. $11.49 for a 12-pak of 12oz bottles from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Pours a nice clean/clear light golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, very slight hop. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, very slight hop. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, but very slightly, would not buy again."
"D: Very drinkable. Not outstanding, but easy to toss back a few while watching a hockey game. Makes for a nice session beer."
"This beer should be called ""not Bass."" It's just alright. I used to plain not like Harp, but after a few years I'll give it a passing grade. That being said, there's nothing worse than ordering a black and tan and getting half Harp. There's not much more to say about it. Pretty standard and not something to seek out."
"Needs to be really hot outside to drink this one."
"D - Harp Lager isn't interesting in flavor at all but it sure would make for a good session beer. Paired with Guinness is the best way to enjoy this beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. It is not hard to toss back a sixer of these in pretty reasonable succession. It has all the elements that make a great lager and is way better than some of the American alternatives that I end up drinking sometimes. I know I am very passionate about Irish beer being my heretige but I am in no way bias. I would never let a beer's country of origin effect my final review. If a beer taste like crap it tastes like crap there is no way around it. And that is definitely not the case with Harp. Harp is near the top of my favorite macro beer list."
"Drinkability: A very average lager. Not a bad beer, but there are so many better options. It is one step above the standard mass America lager, but not much else."
"a nice, refreshing drinkable brew."
"Highly drinkable, this is honestly one of the better lagers I've enjoyed in quite some time. A little more on the sweet side than crisp, but nicely balanced and very tasty."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a nice golden color with a small, fine white head. The head dissipates quickly leaving behind good lacing. Some malt, bittering hops, and a touch of skunkiness in the nose. Medium carbonation with a dry quality in the mouth. Bitterness on the palate is very forward with the malt sweetness playing second fiddle. A little corn and grain taste. Better put together than American mass produced lagers. Some lingering bitterness and sweetness. A decent session lager for the masses but lacking depth."
"D= High. Like I mentioned earlier its St. Patties day so I'll prolly be having a few of these"
"D - it's easy to drink a few of these."
"D - This is intended to be a session beer. As such it is spot on. It's better than mass produced domestic fare. If you're looking to try lagers, this one is good."
"D: This beer definitely doesn't blow me away. Its not a bad beer, but it is rather lacking in the taste department. If the Guinness becomes too overwhelming on St. Pattis you could move to one of these to lighten things up."
"This beer is a light yellow with very little head. Has a very light citrus smell and citrus and malt flavor. Has a good but fairly heavy aftertaste. All in all it's not bad for a lager. It's certainly better than any of the American lagers I've tried. Get it, it's worth a try."
"White fluffy head with decent retention. Clear body shows that there's little to no carbonation. Real nice tiered lacing. Not much of note is going on in the aroma and taste. Floral hops are present. Overall decent, but unspectacular."
"D: A nice, above-average Euro lager. It's nothing great, but it's got a lot more character than many of its brethren. Pretty good, and a standby at many Irish pubs."
"Final Thoughts - One word describes this beer, and that is tame. This beer tastes like it was designed for new drinkers in mind who can't yet handle bitterness and want to feel like they are getting drunk by how much they feel in their gut. Not bad, a little bit above average but nothing special nor anything notable about this beer."
"A good macro lager from those nice people at guinness, better than the average pale lager but not by much."
"This is very drinkable."
"Pours a tansparent yellow color with a small fizzy white head, poured back to back with the ""old"" Harp you can barely tell the difference between the two. Macro malt in the nose and initial flavor, not much changed here in malt character either. The ""new"" Harp has lost that classic hop bite of the ""old"" Harp recipe, i also found it to be a bit more drinkable to the palate. Its really a hit or miss wheater i like it more or less than the ""old"" Harp. I would get frustrated over this but then i remember, wow its just Harp..."
"While not a particularly off-putting Euro-lager, it also does little to make me want another. Kind of disappointing when sitting in a decent new-world Irish pub, looking somewhat desperately for an alternative to another of THAT stout, even if it's made by the same mega brewing concern."
"D: Great sessionable lager, awesome alternative to any American macro. I can't believe I've ignored this beer so much."
"Drinkability: Tolerable and fairly cheap. Which, I'm sure, has been even said about me at times!"
"Light and not bad tasting, this one is pretty drinkable. I definitely prefer this to any american macro lager, but it is overpriced considering what you can get for the same price."
"Don't worry, I won't go off on any preachy, radical, left-wing tirade. In fact, there was a time before discovering craft beer when I greatly enjoyed Harp Lager. My tastes have matured since that time. The bottom line for me now is that I'm not interested in drinking a beer if its producers can't tell me if barley grows in the ground or on trees."
"For a light lager this is actually rather good. Taste wise it is smooth, with just a small hint if bitterness that lingers on the middle of the tongue. It has a medium-gold color and the aroma is light and pleasant. I would have to say this is a well balanced pale lager, a good altenative to American macros if you had the option."
"Not a bad beer, has a nice flavor and good mouthfeel to it. A lighter beer than expected."
"This had an interesting taste of bitter and vegetable to it. Somewhat dull in its taste, but that's probably what makes it so good when mixed with Guinness for a Half-and-Half."
"D- Easy to drink with no off-putting features"
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a pure white head that settled quickly into a cap. The aroma is grainy, corn-like, some spicy hop skunk aroma. The taste is grainy with hints of the spicy hop, doesn't really have too much of the Euro skunk flavor. No funky aftertaste so I give it props for that. The feel is light, yet not watery, very fizzy, finishes sweet from the malt. Easy drinker, best to do when cold. One of the better euro/macro lagers as it doesn't have a nasty aftertaste. Still, no real appealing flavors."
"In ways, this reminded me of Corona Light. haha."
"One of the better lagers out there, in my opinion. Harp has a nice balanced sweet-bitter conconction that drinks nicely. Not too light as some lagers can be, but not too heavy either. Just a good, well balanced lager. This isn't my first choice when hitting the beer aisle, but I'd definitely drink it if offered."
"drinkability was drinkable but the skunk thing going on was very distracting"
"All in all, I could have sworn I'd just had hop tea. Actually, with the carbonation...Hop Kim-Chee."
"I gotta say this one has exceeded my expectations, I'm quite impressed. Not generally a lager fan but I enjoyed this one. Moderate aroma not much present but still nice. Gracious pour, light gold with a real thick white head and generous lacing. Filling and thick for a lager, smooth satisfying finish. Flavor is nice and mild, bolder than American lagers and not as ""skunky"" as most Euro lagers. I am impressed."
"Pours golden yellow into a goblet, with a billowy white head that slowly thins to a film. Aroma is pale malt, breadiness, fruit, grassy notes. Mouthfeel a little heavy, with medium carbonation. Taste is crackers, malt, tangy citrus, bready aftertaste with a slight tinge of bitterness in the finish. Drinkability is very high due to the earthy breadiness which I like in a beer, as well as the inoffensive flavor. Not very complex; not supposed to be. Overall a solid brew."
"Always better on tap. Can sometimes be tangy, almost as if the tap lines are dirty. Pours clear gold with a bubble white head. Grass and hay in the nose, with a lot of grain and bread. Tart taste on the crisp side. Pale malt with grassy hops and apple. You won't have to twist my arm to drink it again."
"Overall good tasting, light, clean, and refreshing beer. Drinks like a European pale ale. Immediate aftertaste leaves you fairly quickly, but you're left with a secondary subtle malty goodness. This one goes down easy, and is a really solid quaff, especially for this style."
"The pour is a golden yellow with hints of amber. with a white head and carbonation. The nose is malty, yeasty, and citrus, There are other aromas that I could not quite distinguish. The taste is malty, yeasty, with an acidic mouth feel. It is an good beer but not my style."
"Just your typical bland, european tasting pale lager. Hard to pick it out from (insert mass produced european import here). Very drinkable but not much tastewise. Just way too thin of a body to make it even worth a little of the money. Not worth a try."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but doesn't have much of a taste. Not worth it's price, either. I don't have a problem drinking it, but nothing that I would be going out of my way to buy. Could be good on a summer day, but at the price there are much better choices."
"D: Pretty decent. Better than what I was expecting. A step above many beers of this style."
"A mediocre lager in a mediocre style. It's not bad and probably better than American macros, but that's no high compliment. I used to really like euro lagers. Now, they're just boring macros, not so much bad as mild, sour and lacking the depth of a good beer. My score is only so low because of the heights that beer has reached. If Harp was the only beer in the world, I would certainly love it. It is beer, through and through. Guinness is a great brewer, but they're huge and immensely staid. Harp pours a bright yellow with a surprisingly good head. The nose is average but not nearly as poor as other macros. The taste is a downside and would come in a half point lower in a more competitive style. It's all cheap but honest malt and thin sourness. The feel is mildly watery, but it prickles with carbonation. It's not an undrinkable beer. I'm just not sure that I would want it as my first bottle of the night."
"Drinkability: Defintley drinkable, just a little boring. I could easily session these off but this brew needs more character and hop profile to make it stand out. Stick with Guiness."
"Pours a body with an amber gold color. The aroma is very weak, hard to pick up anything. Has a white head. Palate is pale dry, and has a slightly sweet taste to it. Some smoothness."
"Drinkability: I haven't had one of these in a few years, well before I really got into craft. I used to think it was pretty good, but as my palette has grown - this guy has fallen behind."
"The finish has a slight dryness that is nice but again there isn't much else. A drinkable beer but one I could do without."
"Personally my favorite beer of all time is a mix to its when u mix 1 part guinness extra stout to 1 part St. Pauli Girl (delicious) you all should try this taste like a good stout lager"
"D: This is a good, sessionable brew. You can't write a novel about it, but it is what it is. I can't help but go to Guinness for my session brews because I don't find them to be bad at all. Fine beer and gets the job done it set out to do. Can you ask for more?"
"pours a slightly darker golden color for a lager nice two finger white head that hangs around for awhile with a light sheeting of lace down the glaas. smells of malt grains with some spice and hops. slightly sweet malt and grain husk balanced with a clean hop taste. medium body with a smooth crisp carbonation. good any time you need a cold beer."
"Overall not too bad. I would have it again."
"A crystal clear golden Lager with a tad of resilient foam. The aroma exudes grain and bread with a whiff of hops. Clean and light of the palate with decent carbonation. This brew is not very aggressive flavor-wise, but what it has, is not bad. Mostly husky grain flavors complemented by a broad bitterness. The bitterness follows the beer down, but does not linger beyond its welcome. This beer is easy to drink but could use some maturity in its flavor."
"Decent dark golden color and an equally decent fine-bubbled white head. Smells malty-sweet with a cereal grain type of quality and a hint of floral hops. Nice malty flavor as a Lager should have and a little bit of a bitter hoppy aftertaste. Good body and a good lager. I've had better lagers but this one is pretty good. It tastes like it was brewed from quality ingredients."
"D. Nothing that astonishes the taste buds, but it was still pretty good. At least, good enough for a second round."
"I've had this quite a few times but I think I've only ever had it on tap. Pours a golden color with a medium white head. A good amount of lace left on the glass. It looks a lot lighter than it tastes. Nice sweet blend of hops and malt, grassy notes and pretty good. Solid."
"D: An average brew, I would drink it again but not seek it out."
"Umm not the best beer ever, and I probably won't drink it unless its the only thing there and I have something to eat with it."
"D: Drinkability was average overall, barely passable though a tad sweet at times."
"Poured a pale golden color with a head that quickly fades, leaving some lacing behind. Aroma is nice and malty upfront, somewhat bready. Some fruity characteristics are detectable. Taste is very much of the same. Nice, flavorful and almost buttery rich in the mouthfeel. Goes down quite nicely."
"On tap. Pours a pale, golden color with dissipating head that leaves lacing around the glass. Smells of hops, I wouldn't call it ""fruity."" It tasted of hops, very slight sweetness, followed by a little malt presence and a dry, crisp, slightly bitter finish. Not a fan of pale lagers, and this didn't change my opinion, though it is a lot better than most mass-produced American lagers. A little sweet in the finish."
"For a Guinness product of some renown, this beer is a bit disappointing. The light golden color and meager head do not build a drinker's anticipation, nor does the light aroma. The taste is only slightly malty with scant hop character on the finish. It feels and drinks more like an American light lager than most European pale lagers. But it rounds out a night of Smithwick's and Guinness stout if the circumstances call for a lighter touch."
"Pours a pale tan, with healthy head and excellent head retention. Aroma is weak, mostly hoppy. Pleasantly dry mouthfeel at the initial impact, with a little more carbonation than average. Smooth but crisp. Taste is largely of grain, with some hops and a gentle bitter after-bite. Great beer to sip on for longer periods; easy, solid and very drinkable, but not exciting."
"D - Pretty easy to take back and generic."
"Well-carbonated and plenty drinkable, but Harp isn't anything to write home over."
"A little dry for my liking, a light to medium bodied lager that is a little alkie/husky but has some hops on the backend and is complemented mildly by the malts. I don't know, it seems a little off but it wasn't that bad of a beer."
"I could certainly down a few of these in a session, but I'd much rather have something else."
"Notes: For me this was a very enjoyable beer with a beautiful look and pleasing aroma. The flavor is clean, refreshing and highly drinkable. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is very good. This stuff is great to drink after an intense, sweaty gig, especially nice and cold straight from the tap."
"Definition of a session beer."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. I had four of these sitting outside at local restaurant on a fairly warm afternoon. Definitely a session brew."
"Tastes like it's type. Of course, my palate is currently swayed in favor of more flavorful beers, IPAs, APAs, etc. Okay, not great... Pale Yellow with soapy head, nose of a bit of skunk and lager notes. a bit fizzy, though softer than its American counterparts. Meh."
"D: It's fine but not the best import lager by a long shot. It's probably better on-tap as it's likely to have better shelf-life in that form."
" A nice pour it is a beatuiful amber color with a nice head and better than average carbonation. It one of my standard when comparing like kinds of beer"
"This lager pours a pale golden color and holds a frothy white head. The nose has some sweet malts with faint grassy hops. The taste starts with sweet malt as bitter hops build through the finish. Fairly light body and heavily carbonated. Drinkable and one of the better lagers out there."
"The taste is a great combination of the bitterness of the hops which can be tasted at the beginning of the drink and in the aftertaste and the sweetness of the malts, which can be tasted in between."
"Overall - very Irish, simple and satisfying. Goes well with any traditional Irish dinner or as a session beer."
"Pours clear light gold color with thick frothy head and active bubbles that leaves good lace in horizontal lines up the glass. Smells of grain, light malt and maybe a hint of soap. Smooth light malty flavor with a light-to-medium-bodied mouthfeel and a crisp finish from the active carbonation. Light hop bitterness shows up in the aftertaste. Harp makes a good session beer"
"drinkability - Easy to drink beer, Lots of flavor, was impressing for a large production beer. First time I have tried this though I see it everywhere. I will drink it more often."
"Brewed in Canada."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, Lots of flavor, was impressed. first time I have tried this and I see it all the time."
"This is a silky beer; very smooth, dry, soft and highly drinkable. Actually a very nice, clean malt lager and an excellent alternative to drinking the usual suspects of the BMC world. Clean, light, balanced and refreshing."
"D- looks easy to put down but it is a lil rough. Not smooth and the after taste makes it hard."
"Poured a one finger head from a twelve ounce bottle into a glass. A nice golden color to it. As I check my notes I realize I have made no notes regarding the aroma. The lacing held nicely to the glass as I drank it down. Bitter hop taste with a nice crisp finish. Honestly a little less than I remember from drinking this beer years ago. Don't get me wrong, this beer is much superior to BMC but inferior to the american craft beers in general. Times have changed I suppose."
"Overall - A standard macro lager - not really much more to say...."
"D = This is drinkable, but there are better light lagers out there to choose from. Just too non-descript to merit a recommendation."
"Poured an excellent clear straw color with decend head, although very little lacing. Very nice scent, a nice clean and crisp matliness with a little hint of spice. Great taste for a macro-Euro-lager, excellent balance with great maltiness and a slight hoppy aftertaste. Very smooth."
"the appearance is golden with a small head. smell is a bit grainy and froral. taste - the grainyness realy comes out, a just an ever so slight bitterness. mouthfeel is decent, once again a little grainy. i would rather a have a lighter cleaner beer when im looking for a euro lager."
"M/D - Good carbonation but very thin beer. Just not much to it."
"D - Pretty decent, I had no problem having a few pints of this with my dinner, if you like euro pales this one is certainly worth trying."
"D - This is a very good tasting lager. Certainly appropriate for a St. Patty's celebration."
"Pours a clear gold with sudsy white head which quickly fades to a thin layer. Spotty lacing. Smell: grain, noble hops, vegetative off aroma. Taste: grain, husk, sweet pale malt, noble hops for balance. Mouthfeel: light bodied, finishes sweet with a bit of hop bitterness. Decent for the style, refreshing, but nothing special."
"Settled with a dark gold appearance with some amber coloring to it. It also had a pretty good head with some lacing to it. Some hops and spices were sensed as primary aromas from the drink. The taste was bittersweet with its assortment of grain and hop flavors. It did have a good crispness to it, but it suffered from a bit of watery texture. Overall, it is pretty decent."
"Very drinkable. Overall character is mild, but it is simple, and good."
"Tastes at first like a sweeter, higher quality American. Refreshing, yet has some malt backbone. Not much hop, but the tad we have is floral. Sweetens as it warms. Light bodied, and seems to get flat quickly. Even so, the very last sips actually get tastier. Much better than green beer."
"This is a good beer. Of course I had to have a bottle or six on st. pats day. Because dont forget everyone is Irish today. It was a very light gold color with a minimal head. Lacing was pretty good. It was just a bit watery with a mild hoppy flavor. I did however enjoy this beer and I will again too."
"Mediocre."
"Drinkablity: A satisfying brew. Good density and flavor make it very consumable."
"Drinkability is quite exceptional as you get the feel of drinking a heavier beer with the crispiness and cleanliness of a lager. It's a perfect session beer and also perfect to drink when you don't want the high ABV hit but want the flavor / sensation of a beer with a higher ABV than the puny ABV Harp has."
" I love a good lager, but this one is just a bit under-par for my taste."
"Overall, probably not something I'll be going back to. I'm somewhat surprised by this, given Guiness's reputation, I expected a little more."
"This is a disappointing, boring lager that seems to take more inspiration from American lagers than from Euro ones. The taste had virtually no flavor until the finish, which had a mediocre flavor at best. I expected better given that this is from Guinness."
"OK, but nothing special; a fairly decent standard European lager."
"Mouthfeel is light and quaff-able. This will make a good session beer for a night."
"Very light amber pour with just a little white head, on draft at Fado in Austin. Decent lacing on glass. Smooth creamy malt smell, and was more carbonated than the bass I had just before this one. Had the perfect amount of bitterness to that really gave way to and balanced a malty sweetness in the aftertaste. Very drinkable and enjoyable overall."
"overall just a little below average beer..."
"In some ways this is an average beer, but it's oddly drinkable. It has a typical lager-like body, in that it's a light golden color. The smell is fairly unexceptional. There's a certain bitterness to the taste - something I like in a beer - but it isn't particularly complex. It has a low carbonation mouthfeel. But like I said, it has some odd indefinable quality that makes it drinkable."
"D - Very light beer that you can drink all day. My preference is mixed with guiness for a black and tan."
"cette bière blonde blé est assez foncée, col blanc épais et durable, elle a un nez de malt et houblon agréable, sa bouche est moyennement corsé, elle se déploie sur une belle longueur, elle est agréable et surtout facile à boire."
"It was served with absolutely no head at all. Showed a light golden colour. Bright flavours at the beginning that turn a little hoppy. Not much complexity, I was never confused about what I was tasting, yet enjoyed it all the same. At the same time it was a decent beer if that's all you're looking for. Could drink several of these in a row without getting sick of it."
"Brewed by Guinness, but the style doesn't sit right with the stout and Smithwick's. I'd still rather have this than a BMC light or regular, though Bud bottles can be more moderately priced."
"To me Harp is a touch above an average lager. I keep this in rotation with Sam Adams for my normal session brews. I always enjoy it, it goes down easy and has a nice lighter flavor profile. I also find its an easy push to toss on BMC fans as they don't freak out on the first taste. Good intro to real beer!"
"Not a great beer but still very drinkable. Crisp and refreshing on a hot day. I'll pick this one up now and then and enjoy a few at a sitting."
"Pours a clean, golden yellow with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet fruitiness. In the taste, sweet to dry maltiness and hints of fruit, yet very small. A smooth, small sweetness in the mouthfeel and a dry with sweet fruit hints in the aftertaste. Nothing too exciting, yet kind of sweet for a lager."
"D: Very drinkable, as I said before, if this is one of a few choices available it's not a bad one."
"Does have decent lacing and mouthfeel, shame it tastes the way it does."
"Taste is of a lite sweetness in the beginning and some bitterness and dryness in the middle the grass and corn coming thru here,no sign of skunk in the taste,it finishes off dry,goes down like water,very easy to consume these in high quantities,i enjoyed it,not bad at all.Very thirst quenching on a hot day and the beer in the cooler full of ice."
"More notably the tan half of the black and tan I had a tap of Harp. Nothing to outstanding about this brew. It has a light golden color with a 1/4 inch head that didn't last. There was some notice of hops, but more so malts in the aroma. Light taste with average carbonation. This beer was very forgettable. I will stick to having mine with Guinness."
"1/2 of a black and tan. Smells kind of corny. Poured into a pint, nothing else, to a dull yellow with a nice foamy head. Taste is only slighly bitter and very dry. Very light even for the 5% AC. Mouthfeel is good but not too much exciting here. Probably a good beer for its style but doesn't trip my trigger. I think I'll pour a stout in the remaining half to liven it up a bit."
"D- Easy to drink but pretty standard macro euro lager type. At least they use a brown bottle to help avoid the skunking so common in many of its competition."
"Review translated from french 5-25-2008."
"lager with similar light flavours, I can pay a lot less than the plus US$8 I paid for the 6pack. Next.."
"Very nice beer overall. Like it a lot. Even if it's a smooth clear bear, I do like a lot. Much better than Quebec beers like molson n stuff... One of my favourite. I don't know what more I can say... Why do we have to fill 250 characters !?!?!?!?!?"
"Drinkability: Easy enough to drink one with a meal, enjoyable, but not the type of beer that you might want to drink many of at one time."
"Good drink several of these, pretty light beer and the alcohol content is not too high"
"Overall this was the best beer I had this entire weekend. This is in my opinion should be what most lagers should aspire to be. This was a nice straw blonde pouring out into a glass with a decent 1 to 1 and half finger head that when settled left a little lace down the side of the glass. The taste was spot on for a lager as it was clean, crisp and had a good balance between malty taste and hops to give it a good bite at the end. There is no doubt why Harp is considered a cut above most big lager styles out there"
"Had this one again at Hooters tonight of all places and just had to write a review as it was in a bottle. Much better this time around. Nice crisp clear finish. Great taste. This was one that really is deserving of its status. It is a good fallback option always, as the nice english hops really give it a nice feel. Still a winner here."
"Pours a pale golden color with a head that quickly fades, leaving some lacing behind. Aroma is nice and malty upfront, somewhat bready. Some fruity characteristics are detectable. Taste is very much of the same. Nice, flavorful and almost buttery rich in the mouthfeel. Goes down quite nicely. I probably wouldn't buy it again but it's certainly drinkable."
"D: An okay beer, goes well with food, but a little unremarkable for me. Tomorrow when I go to play darts with the wife, Im ordering a stout or a pale ale instead."
"Decent lager, and something that is simple to drink without over analyzing complexity's."
"This beer pours a nice golden color, with a little head. The smell is kind of bitter, but I don't get much more from it. There is a taste of wheat and grain, but nothing too terribly speical. It's a good beer, but I've got to be honest -- I was a little disappointed for the price."
"M.F.: Avg carbonation. On the heavier side of light bodied"
"I had this beer on tap in one of the local pubs. It is a little darker than most lagers I have tried with the average malty sweet aroma most lagers have with a bit of grain. The taste is good a little bitter up front with a buttery after taste. Mouth feel is average to a bit watery. This beer is fairly drinkable just not my favorite."
"Nice Euro Lager that doesn't surprise or disappoint."
"poured from bottle into a glass. yellow color, 1/4 inch head that lingered for a few minutes. Tastes like a regular american lager with a little bit of a bitter aftertaste. the mouthfeel is pretty good its not watery at all like you get with some lagers. but for me its not worth the price."
""
"This was tried on tap in downtown Toronto along with a burger. The colour was a dark gold colour, translucent, with an off-white head about 2cm high. There was not a lot of aroma to speak of however. The taste was crisp and clean with a metallic tinge to it. It felt rather weak on the tongue, not watery, but the carbonation wasn't strong either.."
"Light blonde in color with some head and a little carbonation action in the body. The flavor is a little bolder than your typical lager. Clean, crisp, with a little bit of a banana twist to it, and a tingling finish o slight bitterness on the tongue. A good lager, but a bit expensive at stores."
"Well this beer isn't really that bad but it isn't really that good either. It has some traits of budweiser but not as bad. I'm guessing its brewed with rice. For the money its a bit overpriced like Corona. If I had to choose between Harp and the normal piss water macro lagers I'd choose Harp but its nothing that great and its nothing that bad either."
"was a great change of pace, and it turned out to be a quality lager, period."
"A very drinkable Euro pale lager, if that's what you'r looking for. It was sweet and slightly grainy with a faint aroma and slight head. It reminded me of a fruity version of Budweiser. Not offensive and a decent beer, but nothing special."
"D= beware the random mega-foam phenomenon and resultant massive-bloating and belching that I describe at the top. Otherwise, a good session-beer if you're in the mood and want to pay the extra money over US Macro's."
"D - Light, and easy to put a few away. If I gotta get a cheap beer this is it. Not likely to surprize anyone but something good from the cats in canada, yup its brewed in canada (check the label)."
"Poured clear gold with a big fluffy white head that stuck around. Subtle aroma of hops and honey malt. Taste is bittersweet and full, with a sort of caramely chewyness. This is far superior to many EPLs that I've tasted. Not enough complexity to be a really interesting beer, but a good choice when you want something light but solid. It's pretty widely available too -- at least in the Northeast."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a clear straw, forming a 1 inch head, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is semi-sweet, light floral hops. The taste is light hops, along with an unpleasant grainy flavor. Kind of reminds me of Coors. Light mouthfeel. Overall, I expected more, and got way less. Very lacking in flavor, more like American macro lagers."
"Drinkability: Considering the circumstances, it was very high. On a normal day, it would be just above average."
"I've had Harp several times in the past and for the most part thought it was okay. I've also purchased what I've felt seemed to be older bottles that have probably been on the shelf and sat too long. The taste was skunky and bland at best. This bottle was fresh and the hops seemed to really standout making it a far more respectable brew."
"Its pale like a regular lager should be it smells ok, tastes ok. easy to drink. good ""hair of the dog"" beer. good warm weather beer when an american macro won't do."
"D - This beer is very, very drinkable. It's nice and light. I found myself halfway through the glass before I noticed. I could easily see myself drinking this all night (aside from being charged for imported beer)."
"D - Easy to drink. Not overly impressive, but far from being a bad brew."
"The hops come out in the taste with a bitter start to each sip. Harp finishes malty and just shy of being too sweet. The carbonation and crisp finish elevate the other mediocre elements and make this a decent pub fallback if the other offerings are less than desirable."
"This beer, seems to me to be an above average lager style beer. There was not anything particularly amazing about this beer, but it has a solid taste, not too bitter but very smooth easy to enjoy. The drinkability is high since the abv is around 5, and the price is around 8 for a six pack. This is a good beer for a change of pace, without trying something too different."
"Drinkability: This beer drinks like most American macro swill; however it does have slightly more flavor. But face it; its the Euro Bud Light. This beer is a key ingredient to the perfect black and tan. And it plays that roll well."
"Pours a dark yellow, orange like color. Reminds me of the color of expelled vitamins... Smells decent, but unfortunately for me, this smell always brings me back to my least favorite tasting beer, and that is anything by JW Dundee. Thankfully, this beer doesn't taste as strongly as JWD, but still an unpleasant maltyness to this beer. Watery, not much substance here. Really nothing exciting here except maybe an Irish parralel to PBR with a less offensive smell. Can't say I'm impressed, and I only saved 50 cents by going with this instead of getting Sierra Nevada like usual. Oh well, tis the time of the season for Irish."
"So why drink it? Well, if one is drinking strong stuff all St Paddy's Day, this seemed like a decent alternative to slow down with while ""remaining Irish""...and it was."
"Drinkability - A very nice lager."
"12 bottle into a mug. Appearance was light copper, some visible bubbles, weak, fairly small head, no lacing. Looked like a macro, mostly. Smell wasn't much better. Very mild, some grain, and not much else. Taste was mediocre. Again, mostly grains, maybe some very light fruitiness, a little bit of corn. Feel was thin-bodied, lots of carbonation. Overall, this was pretty bad. For some reason I'd had good memories of this beer, but those were not lived up to here. It's a lager, and not, in my book, a good one. Highly mediocre in every way."
"I like Harp in the bring time, it is that come out from the cold beer, everything spring is, Harp is. I drink it form the bottle, which is rare for me. It has sure a smooth refreshing feel to it, you don't want to spoil it by drinking to many, i would say 2 to 3 max. Once you get drunk Harps appeal is lost on you. The great thing is it is not to filling. It goes great with a meal too, chicken, steak or seafood, goes good with almost anything."
"The pale color is not impressive, but that is its biggest weakness. Smell is fairly beery, and the flavor is crisp and smooth. It has some fruity undertones and no bitter taste or aftertaste. This is a nice lager for parties and sports bars, and is great in a ""half and half"" with original Guinness Stout."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow, with a decent off white head - nose of subtle pine hopps , weak malt , and floral  taste of malts , decent bitter hopps , soapy , and grapefruit - body slightly oily , and well carbonated aftertaste of sour chalk , and crisp"
"Poured from a Bottle into a mug about 1 finger of head (being a bit generous.) When swirled around in mug left a nice lace throughout. Poured a nice golden color. Not too distinct a smell although came with a typical lager smell, nothing offensive in the scent of the beer. Taste is not too bad, nothing exciting but an all around tasteful beer. Bitter Dryness at the end. Which dissipiates rather Quickly. Pleasant mouth feel, and very easy to drink, it wouldnt be hard to put down a lot of them. Overall not so much a beer i would get over and over again, but i may return to it in the future."
"Not too bad but not great. Do-able and probably better with food."
"Nothing great, but I have no problem knocking back a few."
"Drinkability: Not a bad lager in my opinion, not a stand out, it's refreshing, clean, light, not sweet - definitely a little puckering if anything, very dry."
"This beer was served with an appearance of a light-bodied gold with little head and retention. Bright and shiny in the glass with your standard lager appearance. The smell was clean with a hint of grassy characteristics. A clean, smooth taste with a mild, grainy finish. The mouthfeel is well-balanced adding to the smoothness that makes this a drinkable lager. Good, but certainly nothing special."
"Overall, it's a decent and perfectly acceptable lager. But it's a bit boring and too buttery. Guinness should stick to Guinness. I'd rather get a German or Czech Pilsner over this any day -- this is basically the same thing, but with some butter and cream mixed in."
"Tasted: 01/28/07"
"D- I never had this in bottle before, always on tap. I enjoyed this in the past, but in a bar, ice cold and in larger volume. would not recommend this in bottle, but a tap setup would probably change my mind on this sample."
"well I found myself recently at disney world with the family and one night we ended up in the uk section of epcot.they had a stand there with bass and harp on tap and I ordered a yard of harp and watched a band playing beatles tunes.It was my first time trying harp and I enjoyed it"
"Overall, this beer is fairly unremarkable. Pale straw yellow. Fluffy bright white head. Nice carbonation action. Some malty aroma, nothing special. Taste is plain with a somewhat crisp finish. Sweet upfront and a tart finish. Only a minor metallic hint. This beer is simple, yet enjoyable. It is one of the best of the Euro Lagers. I think the brown bottle helps it hold up a little better than some of the others."
"Taste is better than most main stream lagers, but nothing great. The sweetness is hollow and a bit coarse. Hops? Not many. Better to drink cold."
"D: This would make a great lawnmower beer, besides that I probably wouldn't drink it again. WIth that said, it's good for what it is and is supposed to be."
"Drinkability- Good but I am telling you add the lime cordial."
"Drinkability is high if you like the flavor."
"Pours a clear golden honey with a small white head. Ring was long-lasting. Crispy smell, no off-putting corn odors, but still somewhat generic. Taste is approaching an NA beverage, as if there were some unfermented ingredients here. The crispy mouthfeel helps it along, but overall this is simple an inoffensive boring lager."
"The is a good general lager, and it pours a pale gold, a bit darker than many lager. It has a good balance smell, more of grain and malt. The taste is solid and refreshing, a bit sweet and fairly smooth. It's has good drinkability but I tend to not want too many at any time (as I prefer ales more)."
"I walked into a local favorite of mine in DC and ordered a round of Harp for my friends and I. I had heard that this was a good beer for such a night, and as it were that sentiment was correct. The color was a nice golden yellow with a medium to thick head when served in the pint glass. The smell was hoppy and a bit ""fizzy," what I mean by that is this beer seemed a tad over carbonated. The taste was plesent and the mouthfeel was suprizingly smooth (I suspose I shouldn't be too suprized... it is made by Guinness). We ended our first round and the glasses finished clean, the test had been pased; Time for another round mate!"
"Overall: A substandard euro-lager, but useful as a crossover beer at least from the standpoint of getting someone to drink something else that tastes just like x."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. A light golden color with a thick white head that's retained pretty much throughout the beer. A malty smell. Malty taste with hints of bitterness and a slightly sweet aftertaste. Decent mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable beer overall."
"D: Goes down easy and not too filling, but not very tasty at all. To be perfectly honest, I don’t think I can see myself drinking this beer again under any circumstances."
"Drinkability: good, you could have a few in a night; this might be ok after drinking a heavier beer."
"Drinkablity is decent due to the light and refreshing (albeit watery) mouthfeel and the cheap price ($6 for a sixer at WalMart). This is nothing to sit, sip, and ponder, but it goes down easy and is a notch above BMC swill. Also, very good for initiating non-BAs, and weaning them away from BMC."
"D - Not too bad really. Even thought the mouthfeel sucks and the flavor is medicore, it is something somewhat drinkable as a german pilsner rip-off. It isn't my favorite style, but it sure beats Heineken!"
"This is a very drinkable beer, and a good representation of the style. Its probably not the best lager Ive ever had, but passable and I would certainly have it again."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"D- This seems different than what I remember from a few years ago. I know they started to brew this in Canada for North America but it shouldn't change too much. Still a very nice lager and very sessionable."
"This beer poured a clear straw color with a thin head. The smell was mild and faint of hops. The taste was smooth and balanced. The mouthfeel was full bodied. The drinkability is smooth and easy. Overall my impression is that this is a decent middle of the road beer that goes down easy, but at the same time, doesnt really have any characteristics that grab you. It definitely beats a domestic and would be a great cold lager on a hot day."
"This is a decent lager that warrants no more than a brief second look from the first time sampler. It seemed to be a better beer several years ago prior to Guinness ownership. It is good but not great on just about all counts. This and Carlsberg are on tap in every pub in Ireland. If you need a break from stout during your Irish excursion opt for the Carlsberg it's much better on tap especially in Europe. Harp is average across the board, not bad, not great. It'll do in a pinch and that's about it."
"Harp Lager is golden in color and very clear. It had a large white head with rather good retention and spotty lacing. There is not much in the nose, a little sweet malt and noble hop aroma. The taste was some noble hops with some light malt and a clean dry finish. This is a smooth, medium-light bodied lager with medium carbonation. It is easy drinking and refreshing; a step or two above the average American macro lager. It would work well for a session beer."
"Ive always liked Harp lager, maybe in keeping with my Irish roots. On the overall beer rating scale, it is hard to give this real high scores in aroma, appearance or palate, but its a smooth drinking beer, has a good taste, and is a far cry above many of its American macro lager counterparts. Erin Go Braugh!!"
"The beer is very good for its style. Probably my favorite other than Stella Artois and possibly Tyskie. Very mild malt flavor that is a bit sweet with just a touch and I do mean a touch of hops. Mouth feel is ok kinda soft with out much carbonation. I could have 10 and not feel full though so it is very drinkable."
"Eric"
"Harp is golden with a nice level of carbonation. Head is tall with thick foam. Aroma is somewhat weak and short-lived. Smell is typical lager with a bit of herbal hop. The flavor is decent, with just a bit of adjunct off-flavors. The overall flavor is bitterer than most of the style with a good herbal hop punch. A bit of malt sweetness pops through near the end of a sip. Still, there doesn't seem to be enough substance here to keep me very interested. Finish is somewhat metallic. Overall, just slightly better than average for the style."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, but taste-wise it is quite low. I'd say for it's style it is good, but i wouldnt buy a six pack of this, especially for the price."
"Overall: A nice drink due to its good overall balance."
"This beer, frankly, looks lager-y. Golden in color, with a thin head and a lot of effervesence. Tilting your glass produces a wall of lacing. The aroma presents nothing distinct. It's clean and fresh, with a little bit of alcohol and maybe some esters, but nothing really jumps out. Taste is pleasant...crisp, malty-sweet, with maybe a little bit of that ester poking through. The overall effect is something like a sourdough pretzel or maybe a bowl of Cheerios. Dry finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, but the stuff feels heavy in your stomach. Probably very sessionable if you have the means, but not cheap."
"What can I say? This is a classic, although Steinlager is my favorite in this category."
"Its a bit light on the mouthfeel but that makes it that much eaiser to drink."
"Overall, while not terribly offensive, it was a below-average Euro lager - overly simple, boring and pretty tasteless."
"It pours golden in color. Makes a nice attempt at becoming hazy, but doesnt quite succeed. Smell is indifferent. It tastes better than Mr. Bud McMiller's beer, but that shouldnt be considered too difficult. Anyways, not a bad beer if you can catch a sale or a good deal. I probably wouldnt pay good money for this one if there was better available, but I sure wouldnt turn one down."
"Harp Lager pours a macro looking yellow with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Has a nasty, skunk-like aroma. Taste is better than I expected given the appearance and aroma. Decent balance of hops and malt, if a bit skunky. The skunk being fairly typical for the Euro pale lager profile. Not offensive, perhaps a step up from the big three."
"Tastes of malt, hints of adjunct, cereal flavours, a bit of hops. Somewhat harsh and acidic on the tongue. Seems over carbonated. Drinkable nonetheless. Better with food. Not the best lager I've had, but not the worst."
"Overall a very drinkable lager. I previously reviewed the canned version that I bought in Ireland. The bottled version that is available in the U.S. is an entirely different beer."
"D - Again, I like it, a nice change to the beer drawer."
"Drinkability: Overall this isn't a bad brew, though of course by many it's overrated. Still, I'd drink it again, as it goes down smoothly enough and is better than many macros out there."
"I don't like it when beer makes my tastebuds jump off my tongue in order to get away from the taste. Harp has such a sharp, biting sting that just doesn't set well with me. I stuck my nose in it and I thought all would be well, but I'm just not into it. Then again, I am a bit of a wimp. I know plenty of people that rave about Harp. I don't think I'll ever be one of those people."
"As far as a lager goes, this is one of the best I've had in some while. It didn't knock my socks off, but I'm pretty impressed as it's head and shoulders above any other lager I've had in the past couple of years. Well balanced, smooth, crisp, good malt spine yet with a bit of a hop presence and bite. I'll be buying more of this soon."
"Not a bad lager. This is first Euro Pale and I see potential in the style."
"I wish this beer had more depth to it. Between the color, mouthfeel, range of flavors, and aftertaste, it came across as being thin and watered-down. Not a bad session beer, but most common offerings in the Euro Pale Lager style can make that claim as well. This beer's only distinction is it's country of origin. Barely worth a try..."
"drinkability, I would rate as fairly high, not a bad beer at all, and I could certainly see myself havin a session with these. worth a try....reminded me a bit of a euro-lager, but none of that ""skunky"" aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Could be a nice session beer, but the bitter grains could become a drawback"
"Really nice mouthfeel, much better than I expected. To be honest the body on this beer is possibly the most full body I've ever come across when it comes to pale lagers. Creamy is the word that best describes how it feels on my palate. It is easy to drink, and goes down smooth. This is something that I can see myself buying again, but not while there are selections on the shelves that I haven't yet tried. A good beer, definitely one that I'm sure to come back to in the future, but just not anytime soon. It's not something that is so good that you crave it every so often such as Arrogant Bastard, and Chimay Grand Reserve."
"Not a fan, I honestly would rather have a cup of water."
"Overall, better than average in an unremarkable style. Go down good as a St. Paddy's Day leftover, but certainly not to be sought out."
"Overall impression: This one was left over from a St. Pat's party. It isn't bad, but also not something I will be seeking out."
"As lager's go, this is actually a really nice one. Not much in the way of hops, but again... it's a lager. Other than that, not your typical lawnmower beer. A huge body as far as lager's go. I like it actually."
"The taste is crisp and slightly sweet. The hops add a nice bit of balance and some spice notes. Not a world beater but it beats the pants off the big three. Easy to pair with non spicy food. Easy drinker with excellent carbonation. I like this much beter on tap, but still not enough to be a regular."
"The Euro Pale Lagers haven't really excited me much, but this isn't a bad beer. Today I bought it for the free glass deal, but I got a decent lager out of it."
"A classic. Pours out to a nice medium golden color with a big white head of foam. Great head retention. Lots of lacing. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of dry hops and some citrus notes over malt fills the nose. Taste is medium bodied; flavors of grass, malts, bitter hops, some cereal grain. Good taste for the style. Mouthfeel is good; solid carbonation keeps things moving and adds to the higher level of drinkability. Slighty slick as well, but not oily. Good drinkability. I should have this more often, I can't believe i've never reviewed it. Recommended."
"Mix with equal parts of Cider for an interesting concoction."
"The beer pours a vibrant gold, with delicate carbonation keeping a fluffy white head afloat. The taste is light and sweet, with just a pinch of english hops thrown in at the fore. It is quite possibly the sweetest Euro-lager I've had, which isn't a bad thing, just different. I drink it, I like it. Yeah. Nice and simple, no complaints."
"Mouthfeel was quite crisp and cleansing. Medium body. Overall, a beer that you could just sit around and have a casual chat [which is what I did]. Nothing special, but acceptable."
"D: Not one I'll be buying again anytime soon. Stella Artois or Grolsch would be a better example to-style."
"Pours a medium-light yellow with a decent, fizzy head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves very little lacing. Smell is slight, with some hops and a faint metallic scent accompanying the malts. Taste is stronger, with a malt base that has some grains in it, and then a nice hop bite and some butter in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated, and more robust than the average lager, and drinkability is very good. This beer actually exceeded my expectations, even if it's not exactly stellar."
"D- It is a smooth drinking pale lager with not much excitement to it. This is my definition of an average beer."
"Not bad, the nice thing about this beer is that you can find it even in the most macro-infested bars, so its a good beer to fall back on. The problem with this beer, though, is that it has too much in common with those macros: its a wee bit bland, its kinda thin and, although Im not sure that they use adjuncts in brewing it, Harp certainly has that type of taste and mouthfeel. Still, its not bad, especially if youre just getting into craft beer. Recommended."
"I think of this as a kind of a yellow fizzy little beer. The lace is thin and has a very light body. I get a little bit of sweetness on the tongue and then a bitter grain follow through. I think this beer gets picked up more because they see who brews it. If it wasnt for the name, I think this beer would get lost on the shelf with all the other random lagers."
"The clear mellow gold pint is topped with a sparkling white head of small bubbles that left a moderate amount of lacing. A few carbonation streams were present, but not overly active. The smell is clean and only suggestive of some grain and hops, nothing stood out as overly distinctive. The taste was initially sweet winding down to a fairly tame/limp hop finish. Nothing crisp about it. A bit grainy deeper into the pint, but overall fairly mundane. Light body, and frothy carbonation led to a light mouthfeel. Something seemed chemical about this beer, but I could not put my finger on it. I did not find this to be overly enjoyable."
"I liked the bitterness, and it had a decent zing on my tongue, but blast it but that slightly nasty taste undertaste was detracting from every step of the experience. My palette & knoweldge base aren't developed enough to know why that unfortunate aspect of the taste was there. But I know this much: if I want to seek it out (which I won't), I'll just buy a Budweiser. (not to pick on Bud in particular-it is what it is)."
" This beer is pleasant without being great, definitely preferable to Smithwick's or it's other domestic lager rivals."
"Pours a clear medium gold with a small, white, foamy, quickly diminishing head. Smells of lightly sweet cookie-like malts with some grainy aromas and a light herbal hop presence. The taste is crisp and grainy, yet its smooth. surprisingly smooth for a euro pale, with a nicely bittered floral finish. It has a medium-thin body, dry texture, light astringency and moderate carbonation. Well, Im impressed and I dont even like this style of beer that much. Its a delicious and enjoyable lager. Ill definitely give this one a thumbs-up. Nicely done. I hear the real version is even better. Maybe some day"
"D: A bit disappointed by this one. For some reason I expected better. I wouldn't order 2 of these."
"Bham UK Jan 2006"
"This was one of the beers that helped me bridge the gap between Coors light and better beer and I can see why. It's still good!"
"Pours light gold with a huge head. The nose has some hops and the taste also seems full and slightly hoppy. Not a bad lager that only has a slight corn finish. Not up to Grolsch level but drinkable. I am not sure what would make me buy this again as the price is import but the taste says domestic."
"This beer intrigued me, as it combines light color and carbonation with an aroma and taste of maltiness and hoppiness. The taste and aroma lead one to believe it could be a brother of Guinness, although the color is deceptive. I would gladly drink this again, although it is not good enough to warrant the difference in price between it and American macro lagers in my opinion."
"Another good point is that there is very little aftertaste. I highly recommend that it is tried on tap."
"Great to accompany a Sunday football game or to go with burgers or steak."
"Not particularly drinkable for me. I could down another one if I had to, but I can't forsee any reason to buy this again."
"Decently drinkable, although not really a standout within the style. I didn't find it interesting enough to be sessionable, although there's nothing too objectionable about it. Not worth it for the price."
"A decent Euro pale, strong golden color with a decent head, could've lasted a little longer though. More hops in this beer than I originally thought but a little malt balances at the end. Overall nothing spectacular but one of the better (though more expensive) macro lagers."
"Crystal clear straw color with a frothy white head. Light aroma of sweet malt and corn. Flavor is light also - grassy and bitter, but not a pleasant hop bitter, just bitter. Highlights of corn and florals, with an unpleasant burnt rubber finish. Watery mouthfeel, somewhat dry and crisp finish. Low drinkability."
"Looks very much like a pilsener, but appears more watered down in texture and golden color. Some head, but not very thick with poor retention. I detect aromas of malt and alcohol. A poorly balanced beer with fleeting bitterness and sticky sensation in my throat. This is not a very enjoyable beer because it lacks substance. The aftertaste is also very powerful and grows as you take more sips. Usually found on-tap in many average bars, but not worth paying for."
"Pours a crystal clear golden hue, with a bubbly two finger head. Excellent retention, but only modest lacing. The smell is toasted pale malt, with little hop influence. A simple but balanced flavor of sweet pale malt and euro hops. The sweet flavor has some estery tones, but the dry aftertaste hides any impurities. A high level of carbonation and light body give it a crisp mouthfeel, and a very mild residual sweetness allows a good drinkability."
"This poured a nice golden color with a huge airy and long lasting head. The aroma is not quite skunky but it hints at it. Sorta nice though, not too strong. The taste is pretty basic. Mild hops but pleasantly fruity. This is very drinkable. Im not sure why i like this so much. The taste is different than regular lagers but not nasty like most euro lagers. Hmmm dark bottles rule. Stupid Grolsh, becks, heine."
"Its low hop bitterness and bland flavors are helped by an above average mouthfeel making it fairly drinkable, I remember when having a Harp from the tap was a big deal."
"Upon pouring, a light, floral hop aroma tantalizes the olfactory senses while the relatively thin head quickly dissipates. A solid, though by no means overpowering, hop profile is nicely accompanied by just enough malt to balance the brew, creating a rich, full bodied beer. Distinguished by a buttery mouthfeel with a splash of citrus, I found Harp to be reminiscent of an oakey chardonnay. The finish is clean, crisp, and slightly hoppy with just a touch of bitterness."
"The worst irish beer; guinness only w´ll sell its stout´s; this irish lager, no comments about its label; appearance its closer to american lager´s, but dont; mouthfeel rich in malt and hops, smell, taste and drinkability is lower in average; try with cheese and snacks only; 45% recommended."
"This was a drinkable lager, far from bad and actually better than I expected. Nothing I would seek out but better than a lot of what's out there."
"Had this on tap at Finbars, a local pub. This one looks average. Smells of sweet malt. Tastes good, nice sweet malts and even some cinnamon apples for kicks. Carbonation medium high. Drinkability is up there, because its just so crisp and light, and just doesn't annoy at all."
"D: Very drinkable."
"From sixpack that was on sale at a local grocery. 12 oz bottle's label says, ""Product of Canada", brewed in New Brunswick. Pours a clear, pale yellow body with lively carbonation. Modest white head has decent retention and deposits some patchy lace on the pint glass. Aroma is restrained, with grainy malt and spicy hops. No skunk. Mouthfeel is clean and well carbonated. Light bodied. Taste is unassuming, with spicy hop bitterness and grainy, biscuity malts. Both are underwhelming, leading to a pleasant, if unimpressive, balance. Crisp and refreshing, with no off notes, but not much to recommend it. An average pale lager. This one seems a bit tamed down compared to the tap and bottled versions I sampled in Eire a few years ago."
"I've had Harp on draft as well as out of the bottle. Like most beer, its better as a draught and that is what my review will chronicle. About 2 fingers head that maintained good retention throughout. Very mild smell, not too strong. Taste is where this beer shines. Very crisp and smooth, with absolutely no bitterness at all. I could drink Harp on a regular basis and never tire of it. I would recommend this beer to anyone wanting to venture out of the been-there-done-that american beer scene who is looking to try something different. Sure there are better beers to be found in the world, but Harp is a very good overall session beer and worthy of a six pack now and again."
"drinkability was very easy. makes it fun"
"presented as a pale yellow liquid with small white puffy head. Smell is minimal with virtually nothing to be found. Taste had a nice crispnee that I found very refreshing. The crispness continues through at the finish and was a good thirst quencher.Was so easy to drink that my glaas was empty in no time. A bit better than other lagers, but not by much."
"D: Good here, a very smooth lager."
"Great transitional brew for american powerhouse macro fanboys. If you are trying to convert anybody that is..."
"smell is sweet, barley malts, floral, very pleasant but nothing out of the ordinary. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness, finishes quite bitter after a bit of a sweet and malty initial tasting.. It's not unpleasant, but not complex either. Nice carbonation, and a tangyness on the tongue. I'm not as much of a fan of a very soft mouthfeel, so this one is to my liking. A very quaffable beer that I could easily make a session lager out of."
"Better on tap. Much better. Tastier, sweeter, more bubbly, a more enjoyable experience. More floral coming through. Seems to be easier to drink this way. Continues to be very drinkable, and a good ""ok"" beer at a bar. Certainly would rather get this than Bud or Coors. Similar tastes and scents, just... more punch. God bless tap."
"Very straightforward, very drinkable, very refreshing. A fine choice when you don't want to sit around and think about your beer. Clean, light, low/moderate alcohol content.. not exceptional with respect to the entire beer realm but a fine member of it's corner of the beer world."
"Pours a tad darker than golden. Maybe 1/2 finger of head turns to a tiny ring in about 40 seconds. Pretty faint smell. Creamy and medium mouthfeel. First thing I noticed about the taste was the alcohol was slightly more prevalent than I prefer in a Lager, although it tastes suprisingly crisp and goes down smooth. Leaves a little bit of a dry alcohol taste. Other than that, it's not bad at all for a lager...but far from ideal."
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Good malty aroma with just a hint of hops. Fuller bodied than the usual macro lagers with nice hop bite and a clean crisp finish. Easy drinking on a hot day. Good session beer."
"Appearance is sparkling, yellow-gold, topped with thick foam that leaves sticky lace. Aroma is crisp: floral hops, honey malt and ethanol. Initial taste has barley, the bite of bitter hops, good carbonation, and straw. Finish is pretty typical: hops and malt. Recipe appears to have been altered from the Harp Lager I remember. There are others out there that do lager better."
"Pours a clear yellow body, with a sweet grainy aroma. Faint hop aromas. Much too sweet - it overpowers all other flavours. Some husky, grainy flavours. A little bitterness, and ends dry. Still is a drinkable lager though - had at an Irish pub, but otherwise, will not have again."
"A solid beer that I haven't had in a while. Looks between straw and light golden. Highly carbonated with a white head that falls but laces ok. Smells moderately malty and a bit toasty or bready. Mildly spicy. Tastes cleanly malty with ginger, corriander, and clove like spicy sweetness. Holds a moderate body as carbonation fades. Crisp and dry, finishes a bit cidery or zinfandale like. A nice change up from the german and czhec pils that I have been drinking lately."
"A fairly standard offering at British and Irish type pubs in Ontario. Decent aroma, mostly malty and grainy, very light hop character. The flavour's not bad, more malty and sweet than bitter, with a bit of hop flavour. Finishes off-dry. Crisp character from carbonation with a medium/light body."
"Drinkability: I can drink this all day and night, and I have in the past."
"This beer is totally being judged on what it is--trying hard not to be subjective. Lagers have been given a bad name because of the large mass-produced ones, but this is a shining beacon to them all. Pours a golden yellow color with little to no head. Smell is uninspired and is like most other lagers that you will find. The taste is great... instead of being water heavy like other Lagers it has a full body taste. Wheat is really the only decipherable taste that you can point out, otherwise it is too well rounded to pick out. Great overall."
"Had this from a bottle. Pale yellow with a thin head that vanishes immediately and no lacing. Smell is light malt and hops. Taste is a little malty with a hop bite on the end but also with an unpleasant metallic aftertaste. Thin bodied, watery, and fizzy, this really isn't that pleasant to drink. I've heard it's better on tap, I know I'll be avoiding it bottled."
"Not bad as lagers go, but pretty much reduced to a macrobrew quality anymore."
"Smooth and easy to drink. Nothing really outstanding but still a good and very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Next time, I think I'll give it a miss"
"Since I drank this one straight from the bottle, I can't comment on it's head, lacing, etc. Other B.A.'s have mentioned bitterness which I wouldn't say I noticed in this brew. What I did notice was that this beer goes down smooth and easy with none of the harshness that I've experienced with other Euro lager's/ales.Maybe that's because this is just a simpler, mass market brew? My opinion is that this is fuller bodied and more flavorful than an American Macro, which is a good thing in my book. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Better than most macro lagers."
"Strange that I have not reviewed this in my year, but after tasting it again, it may have been a while. Skunky bitter taste and nothing else to impress me. Passed on seconds at a dinner tonight. Appeared nice for a Euro Pale Lager, which is becoming one of my least favorite styles."
"Tried a few sips off of a friend of mine. After the waitress brought the beer, there was little to no head left on top of the clear, light golden body. Smell was very light, mainly of hops. Taste was light malt, with some bitterness and some slight fruit characteristics on tip of the top. Once you swallow the hops stick on your tongue, and you are left with a spicy hop flavor and a little citrus. All in all not bad, but nothing something I'd drink a lot of."
"Nicely bitter to finish. Not too bad."
"This beer seemed average to me. Head faded away rather quickly, tasted bitter and metallic, maybe a little fruity, and went down without leaving much of an impact. I'd like more substance from this beer, although its definitely not offensively carbonated or overly bitter."
"Paid $3.50 for a pint"
"Pours a pale yellow color. ok head that disipates quickly. Very highly carbonated. Lots of bubbles that last a long time. Smell is slightly skunky. Skunkyness goes away as you drink more but there isn't much taste at all. Just an average beer that dosen't live up to its reputation."
"Drinkability: Harp lager doesn't look much as an euro pale lager. According to me, it is closer to Molson Canadian rather than Heikenen. A honest lager."
"The pint came out with a nice lite and clear golden, white head that laced nicely throughout.. Not much in the way of aroma, but a nice balanced pull with a lite hop finish. Medium body and properly carbonated  not to much. Not a standout, but a good session beer, winter or summer. A little Guinness on top would be perfect. Hey, a new idea? yeah, right."
"A rather mediocre lager, but a decent carbonation that grows on you. So I wouldn't spill it out. Very creamy initial pour and creaminess stays in mouth. Balanced between some malts and acid, and hops, so not too sweet. Medium mouthfeel. New bottle and fresh brew for St. Patty Day."
"Weizen-style ~22oz glass presentation. Nice white 3/4 head over the clear dark golden/light amber brew, and laced well. Aroma is lightly of sweet pale malt with a tinge of nondescript hops. Taste follows the nose, with a crisp, lightly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. A reasonable fall-back at the more macro-style establishments."
"Clear gold color...grainy aroma...sweet graininess on the tastes...finishes with almost a noble hop hit like a true pilsner...mouthfeel is round..buttery actually...pretty full for the style....good weight to this but quenching at the same time..good lager..."
"Notes: I got this in an Irish Pub (The Phyrst) as a change of pace from a Guinness. I'll go right back to the Guinness."
"Bottle: Poured a brown color beer with a nice medium head with above standard retention for a lager. Aroma comprised some malt and hops with some floral aspect. Taste is kind of sweet with some nice malt in the background. Bitterness is kind of sweet but a bit too shy for my liking. Overall, this is a decent drink and a lot better then your average macro lager out there."
"one of the few euro lagers ive kind of avoided for some odd reason. why? because im stupid because this was a tastey beer. poured a pretty golden, average head. smelled lightly sweet and grainy. crisp in the mouth, not full and not watered down, just right for what i expect out of a solid lager, sweet with a nice malt hit balanced out with the slightest hoppy twang and a touch of grain. tastey and oh so drinkable. widely available and suited this 70 degree winters day just fine."
"Dark yellow/golden, crystal clear, full sturdy head with staying power, a great start, nice blast of malt for the nose, taste was malty, sweet even fruity!, well balanced by a hop bite, crisp and clean, full mouthfeel for type, this may be one of my new favorite lagers!"
"Notes: I went into this one expecting overpriced, overhyped swill like, say, Heineken, but was pleasantly surprised to find a pretty well crafted example of the style."
"All in all a very average Lager. The apperance is slightly above average, with a nice rich golden color, and a nice head of foam that lingers. The smell and taste are unremarkable, they do the job, exposing the hops, while being a bit subdued and subtle in the grain department. The mouthfeel is pleasing, making the beer quite drinkable. A good beer to buy for friends, as they are liable to find it slightly above average, but not something I buy for myself very often as there are better lagers out there."
"Pours gold with a head that quickly turns to a ring, lacing is excellent. The aroma is of pale malts with no real hop character and a musty corn element in the back. The taste is of sweet almost cloying malts and not much else. This is tastes one dimensional, even for a macro lager. The hops are way too muted, only noticeable in a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is light and processed (metallic?). This is an ok lager at best. Better than Blue but not good."
"Drinkability- Overall this is one of my favorite standby beers. It covers most of the bases for me if I just need a run of the mill beer and don't need my taste buds to be appeased. A working mans beer IMO."
"Drinkability: A good lager, although I don't purchase this often, only when I suspect it may be fresh (around St. Patty's day, due to the Irish connection)."
"Comments - Although I am not a big fan of this style, I think that this is a very good beer. Big beer drinkers looking for a change of pace should like this one."
"This one is a step up from the average mass produced beer.. It looks a lot like the them. Clear yellow, just a shade deeper. The smell is malt and hops. Very average. The taste is more full flavored than the masses. It has a grainy malt flavor with enough hops to give it a more flavorfull bitterness than most masses. Mouthfeel is ordinary. Drinkability is good. Tastes good, not great. Not high in abv. Good session beer."
"Pours clear golden with nice white head that leaves rather quickly but lingers on with above average lacing.Smooth and well balanced. I really wish we could get what is actually brewed in Ireland , ala Guiness Stout, but we must settle for the Canadian brewed.Still, my idea of a great session beer. For the sake of this review I did drink it at the proper temp, but usually I drink it from frosted mugs , yeah ,yeah, I know,but as I said this is my session beer.Slainte!"
"I probably won't bother with this one again. If I see it on tap, I'll give it a try. Once. As far as this bottle goes, I'll opt for a cola."
"A classic beer. Better than the masses but it doesn't give you much more than saying, ""I am a beer, drink me."" A solid yellow color, it looks like your average beer. Smells like a beer with no extra odors. Just your basic hops and malt. The taste is smooth and it feels good going down. It isn't anything flashy and, of course, it goes well in a black and tan. If you are looking for something different, this isn't it. If you want a good beer, this one easily passes muster."
"not as good as I remember, not horrible, just drinkable."
"This one pours a yellow straw color with a thick foamy head. Slight fruit smell but the alchohol was more predominant. Very hoppy in the mouth with a grainy taste / texture. In fact both the color and the taste reminded me of straw. A decent beer but one I would not stock in my fridge."
"Clear gold color, gigantic foamy white head. SMells sharply of grassy malts, not trace of anything skunky. Taste is dominated by one thing, malt. A small trace of hops in the finish, but this thing is as euro lager as you can get. The malt is very well balanced and tastes fresh and slightly grassy, the way a lager should be"
"This beer poured up a nice clear gold with a white head. It had a light malt and hop aroma. Then came the taste; it was malty and no real bitterness, but it had a strange twist to the malt that I found unpleasant. The feel was light and oily. This one ranks in my books as a politeness beer. I would only drink it if bought for me or offered one by someone to be polite. Which does keep it out of the realm of bud and heiniken."
"Alas, it doesn't taste as good as it smells. It's a very subdued sweetness, heavy for a lager but no where near as complex as its smell would lead to expect. Full-bodied but a little over carbonated."
"Beer pours a straw yellow with very little head that was gone before I could walk into the next room. Not much of a nose on this one. Mouthfeel is light with the carbonation bubbling on my tongue. No real lacing to speak of outside of the slightest bit hanging on the glass. Tastes is nothing special, with no flavors jumping out and grabbing me. Not a bad beer to have on a warm summer day if given it, but I wouldn't go out and keep this on hand."
"I get two fingers of off-white, crusty, foamy head and a clear, dirty gold beer. Lacing is lumpy. Nose is toasty crackers, ink, dust and spoonk. The front is zingy, sourish. Middle is fizzy, thick with some caramel. Toasty crackers rebound in the finish. Grain. Bitter. Quite bitter! It's a nice lager, quite full-flavored, a little sour when cold."
"Harp lager was, alongside Guinness, the beer of choice at 'The Botannic', in Belfast, NI. The pour is very light toned with a small head for the type of beer, and not very carbonated. The nose is predominantly malty, a tad of hops also doozes off. The taste, as the body, are of a medium lager but it still is intense, not very watery as i'd expect, rather making it a nice, refreshing lager. recommendable, between pint and pint of guinness up there."
"Harp Lager used to be one of my quasi-standbys, though I haven't had it in quite a few years. It's still drinkable, but that doesn't mean it's good beer. Bottom line: decent and acceptable... which probably qualifies as damning with faint praise."
"This probably is hands down the best lager that is easily accesible. Pours a golden/yellow with a inch thick frothy/white head that dissapates into the glass, bubbles are very well carbonated. Lacing isn't that great. Smell is pretty clean to the nose except for traces of sweet malts. Taste is of grain and hop bitterness, you get traces of malt and the end but the hops are on the forefront of the tongue with the grain. A medium bodied lager, crisp and refreshing. I could drink this with BBQ's anyday. A very good lager, one of those beers to convert macro drinkers into the world of Beer."
"From the bottle pours a clear golden liquid with a white, fluffy head. The head stayed for a while, and there was a great amount of lace on the glass. Smells slightly floral and a little skunky. Taste is a good pale malt sweetness, folowed by a fair amount of hop bitterness, with a slightly floral flavor. Somewhat grainy. Fairly thin, but not terribly watery. Overall, not bad. There are worse. It had been some time, but I am glad I tried this again."
"A fairly inauspicious lager. Poured to an almost blurried yellow with little to no head to speak of. Not a lager to savor. Must be consumed within a shorter time frame as the grainy hops tend to dissipate rather quickly. Heavy aftertaste with an unusual skunkiness smell did not make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. The new Harp slogan should be ""The simple Lager for the complacent beer drinker""."
"Won a bet with my boss pertaining to the Milwaukee Bucks winning more than 35 games. He owed me a six pack and asked me what I wanted. I couldn't be honest and say ""how about a four pack of Three Philosophers."" He knows that I am really into beers so I just told him to go in the store and pick out anything that he thought maybe be different or ""wierd"". He set down a six-pack of Harp. What could I say, it could be a lot worse or a lot better. I guess my thoughts of the bet settlement sum up the taste of this beer. It could be a lot better, but it isn't all that bad. This is a very nice crowd pleaser and doesn't taste too bad after a long week of work."
"Pours a dark golden color with a white, small, foamy head. There is a small amount of lace at the top of the glass that disappears quickly. The taste is mildly spicy and tart. Overall, a good solid fallback beer. Goes good with most foods. I have bought several six packs of this over the past three months and will continue to do so."
"Pours out a golden straw color with mild head generation and some very minor lacing. Head disipates fairly quickly to a thin layer of bubbles on top. The smell is rather bland and difficult to distinguish. It does remind me somewhat of grain, though faint. The taste is strongly hopped producing a very bitter flavor. Somewhat thin though, with a slightly sour finish. I personally enjoy it, but it is what I would describe as an acquired taste. Mouthfeel is thin and nothing special. Drinkability is decent and I enjoy a six-pack of Harp's Lager from time to time. Not an overwhelming favorite by any means, but something I gladly grab when the mood happens to strike."
"Overall - Save yourself $3 and get the Miller Lite instead. It's basically the same type of brew. This beer really isn't anything out of the ordinary. Thumbs down."
"Overall- not a good buy on tap. Harp is now a let down!"
"Appearance is a clear golden hue with a fair amount of carbonation in action. Thin foamy head on the pour, fizzles out before long. Sweet grains on the nose at first backed by some floral hops. Taste possesses metallic grain up front rounded off by grassy and herbal hops that become the more predominent flavour the more I drink it. Crisp aftertaste, it goes down quite easy, with a somewhat watery mouthfeel which is perked up by the carbonation. An okay lager, nothing memorable, but nothing offensive either. Certainly has more flavour than the average macro lager, but given the price I don't think I'd be reaching for Harp as my first pick either."
"To be frank, this beer has never really impressed me, and this sampling ended no differently. Everything about it, from the aroma, to the flavor, and including the overall presence of the beer, reeks of mediocrity. Yes, I could drink more, but in the places where I could, there's usually something else available that I would want more, and I'd not likely ever buy it in bottles. That said, I've liked it just fine as the bottom in a Black and Tan, but as a stand-alone, I'll leave it alone."
"I dislike the ""Irish"" brew made in Canada thing, but even more frightening is the standard macro claim of ""smooth, crisp taste"" and ""authentic spirit"" crap on the label."
"An easy to drink lager. Nothing offensive but nothing spectacular. Give it a try but don't expect much."
"This is definitely a great beer. I was in the grocery store looking to find some Guiness on St. Patrick's Day but they were all sold out, so I found the next best thing, Harp Lager. I fell in love with it, its really great stuff. Has a strong head, tastes great, good mouthfeel. But never it can't quite meet the taste of a Grimaldi Pale Ale mouthfeel."
" Drinkability - rated based on would I buy this the enx time or would I let you spend your money on buying me one? In Texas this is labeled as a Malt Liquor, its tought to knock too many down!"
"It's got a small citrus kick to the typical lager flavor. I like it. It may be just a touch low on flavor content, but what's there is good. The aftertaste is crisp and leads one to another gulp."
"Happy St. Patty's Day!"
"Very drinkable brew, not super complex but a good lager."
"Medium/high carbonation and a fizzy character that makes me angry and reminds me of bud. Pretty good drinkability, actually. Taste is what pulls this brews weight, though its nothing to go home and tell mom about."
"The color is a light yellow, with very little head after you pour it into a glass. There is a hop-py odor, but there is very little taste when you roll it around in the mouth. Fortunately, this is one of those beers that I (and I know others can) drink in bulk. More for the effect than the taste type of beer."
"Flavor is malty sweet with some graininess just like the aroma. The beer finishes with some hop character that makes me thirsty again. This is a refreshing brew that is not overly complex but would be great at the beach."
"Better on tap, but still a terrible lager"
"Golden Yellow color with a small fizzy head. Small amount of lacing. Smell is a very sublte floral hint. This is a crisp lager with a bit of a grainy taste and floral notes. Good blend of hops but the mouthfeel is a little bland. Decent aftertaste of malts. This is not a bad lager but really nothing special."
"Drinkability: Nothing exceptional here, just an average beer. It would make a fairly decent beer compared to a macro, but there are better versions of this style."
"Drinkability  I cant believe Im saying this, but Im going to award a Pale Lager macro the title of average. Congratulations Guinness!"
"Notes. What can i say? When i see a cartoon beer and imagine it tasting like Harp. Extremely traditional nothing to make it stand out but it's not bad at all. If there was a taste dictionary this is what would be filed under beer. Would be a great stand-by drink but it costs way to much. I pay $9.00 for a six pack when this isn't really worth half that. Pleasing drink but i'd rather drink Yuengling Lager for the price as it's half as much."
"This was a decent lager. My pour had a good head on it that faded quickly and left little lace. The smell was quite grainy with a little bit of hop in there as well. The taste was simmilar to many macro lagers I've had...grain with a touch of malt flavor and little to no hop bitterness. Although my girlfriend ordered one and enjoyed a beer for the first time, I do not think I will be paying for another one of these myself.."
"Overall Impression: A well-brewed, clean, straightforward beer. A very good session beer as it is fairly mild, but what’s there is good. I’d drink another, but I’m not going to stock up on this one, the price just doesn’t justify the taste. Try it, but don’t kill yourself."
"I'd only have this again in a 'half and half' (1/2 Harp with 1/2 Guinness stacked on it, you have to have Bass/Guinness for it to be a 'real' Black and Tan) but it's not a bad beer, just a little generic."
"Slainte!"
"An amber color with little head. There was a grainy smell, but there was a scent of hops in the mux. The taste was crisp with a slight hop taste, but I also go a taste of corn. I did like the beer, though it wasn't all it's cracked up to me. This is the bare bones to the middle average lager."
"Pours out a golden yellow with a small head that doesn't last at all. The smell is light malt, crisp and clean. I must admit that this beer has more flavor than I was expecting. Over carbonated which really makes it pop in your mouth. Small malty notes and a hint of hops are appear as well. An average beer that isn't as sweet as some of the other lagers out there."
"Pours crystal clear yellow with orange highlights. Head is soap bubbles that dissipate quickly leaving a mdoerate amount of alce. Mild aroma of citrusy hops and sweet malt. Flavor is very mild malt followed by mild bitterness. Balance is there just very little flavor."
"As so many others have pointed out, definitely better than the macro lagers, but not special by any means. As an option when out at a restaraunt or bar, not bad. Pours a deeper shade of yellow than a lot of other lagers. Smell is bland and unimpressive. Taste is well balanced, but certainly not profound. Somewhat thin and fizzy. Belongs in the category of a lot of beers that are better than the ""big three"" (and their many imitators), but in no way world class."
"Nice appearance, smell. Pale yellow. Nothing offensive. Usual drinkable lagerm appropriate and hits the spot any time you are thirsty."
"it had been a while since id had one of these on tap, and having preferred others. when the choice was presented, i'd looked elsewhere. however on renegging and having a go at this earlier tonight, i was surprisingingly satisfied. once again the irish show what a craic beer is all about."
"A nice lager and something I'd drink again."
"Definately one of the better imported lagers I have ever sampled. Pours a gentle yellow-gold that produces a thin, white head over a clear, golden beer. Smell is attractively sweet without much of a definable character. Taste is quite above average for a lager, with a clear and medium body, a malty smooth start, and a pleasantly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is overall good, but nothing to scream about. Drinkability is quite high as this beer leaves a limited aftertaste, sits light in the stomach, and packs only a meager alcoholic punch."
"Came out a clear true gold hue under a small white head that lingered a bit and left some lace. The nose is mild and sweet, mainly of grainy malt. The mouth was medium carbonated and fairly light. The taste starts very sweet, with lots of malt and what seems like a touch of sugar water. There's a respectable hop bite in the finish, leaving an enjoyably bitter aftertaste. There are far, far better beers in the world, but if I had to drink this and only this for the rest of my life, I'd still drink beer."
"ng"
"Most of the time when I get close enough to have a Harp I'm actually having a Half and Half so I never really get to drink it on its own - until now. Boy, ya gotta love Harp. Pours out a lovely deep gold colour with a nice white head that shrinks to a ring for the rest of the glass leaving some interesting lace patterns. There is a nose of malt with some taste of hops but the aftertaste is . . . refreshing - maybe its the barley. Lots of carbonation as well. For a big time operation this is a pretty darn good lager. Tastes good straight!"
"This was a little below what I had hoped for. It looks darker than American macro lagers and has a full body. It's nice and crisp in body but that's where it ends. No real taste goes with this beer. Flavors are toned down to the point where I can't recognize them at all! Maybe some grassy grain in there and a tad bit of hops came through at times but the flavor was definitely missing for the most part. Not worth the price."
"I have had this often enough before, but not since I started rating. This is definitely not an American type lager, its color is noticeably darker than that, and will already mark you as someone who knows the difference between horse-p--- and beer. Good taste is there, pleasing beery aroma and even some hop flavor. Above average. I had this served at a bar in the Midway Airport terminal; pleased to find some decent beers at such a place, even better that it seemed to be proprtly served in a pint glass."
"Drinkability: Harp is pretty much bred to be a session beer. No real strong flavors to offend the masses. No real character, either, of if there is one, it's a shrinking violet. I'd rather have it's big brother Guinness when visiting the average Irish joint."
"Appears golden crystal clar with a thin white head leaves decent rings of lace. Aroma: Good amount of malt sweetness some mild European hops in there as well not bad at all. Taste: Simple refreshing mildly flavorful with a bready malt tone and decent dose of bittering hops here, finishes clean and smooth not a bad beer. Mouthfeel: Lighter body good carbonation level not much else to note though, simple. Drinkability: Refreshing and able to drink quite a few definitely better than any American mass produced lager just the price inflation will never be worth it, too much for a decent beer."
"Pairs shockingly well with pizza. Not classy enough to avoid drinking out of the bottle, yet hoppy enough to bring out the flavor of all the peppers I sprinkle on my slices. I look forward to swilling this in bulk over lunch."
"Bottle.This was a better beer than what I had anticipated that it would be as this was a very drinkable beer.Although there is nothing very special that stood out about this one, it was an enjoyable beer.This beer poured a medium sized white creamy, rocky head with fine-large bubbles that was mostly lasting.The body was clear with very little carbonation and the hue was golden.The nose was mild, fruity and malty.The flavor was citrus and very lightly hopped.The mouthfeel was smooth with a light body texture.This beer left excellent lacing on the sides of my glass."
"Light gold color, medium head. Slightly skunky aroma. Light malts and hops. Tastes like a Euro-Lager, but there is a touch of soapiness and green bottle skunkyness. HOLY FALSTAFF BATMAN!! IT'S A HEINKEIN!! How does a beer in a brown bottle taste green bottle skunky? Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is bitter and soapy. This bottle is UNDRINKABLE!! I doubt I will re-rate"
"Pours out golden straw color with a thick frothy head that slowly diminishes to a thin spotty lace. Smell hops and some wheat hardly any malt is noticeable. Has a good amount of carbonation giving this a thin crisp mouthfeel but not a tingley feeling on the pallate. Taste some hops and a bit of malts pretty much all I can detect out of this one. Not a bad beer IMO, not a bad session beer at a party or something to drink while mowing the lawn."
"this was a decent brew. It had a nice golden color with a decent head. This was a nice beer to drink. This chased a Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. This has a nice hoppiness at the end which is very pleasant. I don't like a really intense hop flavor but this was just perfect. A good beer. I would drink this again."
"medium gold color with a thick white head. smells a little floral a little citrusy sometimes something almost nutty too... the citrus really comes through in the taste, pleasant hoppiness at the tail end, along with a relatively strong citrusy tang. pretty light mouthfeel, but it suits the beer. overall, not a bad beer, not a great beer either. it's a good standby when available at the bar."
"Average lager color of lightish yellow gold, thin, somewhat loose white head and lacing. Smell is faint of light sweet malts and a touch of floral hops and very whispy citrus noted. Taste is more of the same with light sweet malts and grains in the start, quick, and easy approach, with small balance of hops that are a bit floral and very light citrus. Finishes dry with a small amount of bitterness.Thinnish body feel and low carbonation which makes for easy drinkin - if you must, indulgde, cuz this stuff is found nearly everywhere and is a better option then most marcos and micros that may be served at smaller bars and restaurants."
"This may not be an exciting beer (how often is one excited by a fizzy yellow beer?) but it is a good thirst quencher and the simplicity seems to work for this. No obvious off-flavors, and seemingly adjunct free. A good beer for its style."
"This beer was a nice golden color and left a trail of lace all the way down the glass. It had a malty smell to it and and a small malty taste. The mouthfeel was a bit light. The drinkability was great and this beer goes well with pub food."
"12 oz bottle.Poured a straw yellow, with a fairly good head that lasted, and losts of sticky lacing on theglass that lasted. Aroma is of hops and malt. The taste is slightly sweet, with no hop flavor. Mouthfeel is weak and watery, lacking any real body. I can hardly believe something this bland is made by Guinness."
"The beer poured a light golden color with a thin white lace. The aroma was not very impressive. I couldn't detect any malts or hops anywhere. The taste was much the same; very plain, filtered, and boring. The body was low and it was highly drinkable, although I don't think I'll be having another in the near future. I have had this beer before and remember enjoying it, but like a lot of beers, I find while reviewing them I just don't feel the same way. This is a good outdoors beer if you are in need of something light and watery. Me, I think I'll just stick with the water."
"This beer poured a beautiful, clear golden with a fine head. The lace clung to the glass to the very last sip. By far the presentation was the BEST aspect of this beer. The aroma was malty and nice. With each sip the malt filled my nose and made the lack of malt flavor more bearable. The flavor was mild in all aspects. I was not able to detect much malt and no hops. The mouthfeel was light. This was a good beer to pass an afternoon of eating etuffe with my family. It was a good session beer."
"Harps never been a favourite of mine even home in Scotland I prefered Tennents lager to this."
"harp nowadays is basically an irish budweiser (though still a bit better, mind you) to me. it's lost any and all character i remember it having. both the body and flavour are lighter and less distinct. a bit more carbonated than i remember it, too. it goes down smooth and works well as a session beer, but why waste your time and money here when there are far better session brews that are just as readily available (is there a bar these days that doesn't have harp? it seems not.)? though not a bad brew, there is nothing at all special about this beer."
"pat"
"Consider this the ""red headed"" step child of all the beers Guinness distributes. Based on experience this beer appeals to the beer drinker who usually drinks the monster beers ala ""Miller"" or ""Bud."""
"This is another standard lager. Crisp, clear, and bright gold color. White head with some lacing going on. The taste is grainy, with a hint of hops. Nothing spectacular, but not a bad lager. I got it in an international sampler pack, but normally i think it is almost 8 bucks a 6er around here. Not worth that price."
"-F"
"I love this beer. It pours somewhat yellow with a medium white head that dies off quickly. The aroma is nothing special. The taste is extremely enjoyable and I would drink this beer anytime. I think it is a great beer that is wonderfully smooth. This is yet another beer that doesn't have any extremely complex tastes or aromas, but it is just an overall enjoyable beer that I would drink anytime."
"Harp pours a light caramel with a big, frothy white head that looks like marshmellow fluff as it dissipates to a substantial residual lace. The smell is light and not terribly complex with just a hint of tanginess. There's lots of carbonation in this pale lager which makes for an effervescent mouthfeel. I found the taste rather bland--only the slightest hint of the tartness left over from the smell--and there is a powerful malty aftertaste."
"All in all, Harp is a good beer. However, it's not the beer I once loved. Perhaps it's destined to be a bridge...and that's not all bad."
"Beautiful clear gold with a half inch white head that created great lacing throughout the glass. Very light hopping and a sweet grain sense. The smell was malty which carried over into the taste. There was virtually no carbonation present. Dry finish with a faint sense of bitters."
"Pours like a nice lager should, dark yellow with a decent head. taste is very malty. Definately, the malt is where it's at with this brew. Hops are there but not distinct to the maltiness. Overall, I thought this was a little disappointing, considering Guinness and all. I think this is a typical middle of the road Euro lager."
"A nice smooth malty taste, again not much hoppiness in the finish. A real nice brew, I would happily drink a pile of these. The bottle shows when it was made, in my case I have one not quite 4 months old. There was no skunkyness in the smell and this turned out to be a very solid lager. The taste has some character to it, overall a very good beer."
"Amber lager pours with a fairly large head that displays good retention. As it falls apart into large bubbles of faom, it leaves a bit of clinging pseudo-lace at the top of the pint glass. Large carbonation bubbles are visible at the bottom of the glass. The aroma is the traditional ""beer"" smell, with some added hops spice. Perhaps just a hint of staleness is evident. Not skunky, but just a little too earthy. The taste is rather clean, but it does not taste like an all-malt brew. (Are there adjuncts in this beer?) A little bit of sweetness and some earthy huskiness appear, as well as a lingering peppered hop note on the finish. The mouthfeel is better than many lagers, but not great. The drinkability seems good, also better than many lagers. As I've noted before, I'm not a huge fan of traditional lagers, but this one isn't bad. I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me, although it will be a while before I buy anther one."
"For a european ""mass-produced""style lager, this is one of the better ones. Nice balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness. No discernable hop nose, but that's okay. Nice finish with residual grain/malt aftertaste. It is not skunky or garbagy either. A good solid brew that simply tastes good. No intense hoppiness or maltiness. Just a nice crisp generic lager. The beer ie tried was contract brewed in Canada for Guinness, but no discernable ""canalager"" character evident. Great alone or as a ""bottom"" for a half-and-half (black-and-tan but with Harp rather than Bass)."
"Was expecting something much better from the company that brews Guinness stout. Perhaps they should stick with what they know. Golden, slighty clear appearance with a 1/2 inch head that disappears within seconds. Pleasant alcohol smell, not overbearing yet not weak. Kick of barley to the nose, with a minute amount of hops and malt. Average taste. Medium bitterness with a floral mouthfeel after swallowing. Definitely worth drinking, but not the best lager I've tasted."
"My first smells were of some skunkiness, but nothing outstanding plus or negative. Taste is pretty skunky again, some bitterness as well....both are not unbearable by any means, just noticeable. I'm being picky. This is a bottle review. If you drink harp on tap, it's a different story, a completely super smooth lager that is refreshing. But I have always been disappointed with the bottle offering."
"very smooth with mild carbonation and a pretty light body made it a very drinkable beer. it had a pretty good flavoring with some light malts and a good touch of hops. it was really nothing complex or special."
"Pours a clear golden color with a big frothy white head that fades into a nice sticky lace. Nose is sweet malts and floral hops. Taste is sweet bread and biscuits and is a bit grainy with a touch of spice. A husky hop bitterness comes through in a crisp finish. This is a nice brew from the bottle, but it is much better on-tap."
"The pour a translucent golden color, the head brilliant white and modest in size with a whip cream texture, the lace left behind is in fine sheets that cling to the glass. Malt dominates the nose, crisp, fresh and clean, as a well-made lager should be. Lightly sweet at the front, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish spicily hopped, daringly acidic, and the aftertaste dry as the Arizona desert. Maybe not as good as, I remember, but things seldom are these days, but a long time favorite nonetheless."
"Pours clear, bright golden color with reasonable carbonation that forms a tight but somewhat sparse head. Smell is muted; what nose there is comes through as bitter-crisp. Taste is crisp as well, with a rather monotonic hops bitterness prevailing. Some smoothness and a tad of dryness are present too. Mouthfeel is fine, somewhat superceded by drinkability."
"Light golden color with a thin, pure white head. Grassy hop aromas. Active carbonation, pretty light body. Crisp in the mouth. A nice, clean, bitter lager that is easy to drink. Made me think of summertime."
"taste!"
"When received at the table it has a light gold almost honey color to it. The head is white but does not stay very long like the lace. The aroma is of light malt and hops. The taste is a nice malt with hops that also leave a pleasant bitter after taste. A better then average beer. Drinkable."
"Clear dark gold, nice 1/2 inch head that can hold some pillowy shapes. Aroma of brown sugar. Flavor has a touch of nutty, roasty malt but thins to watery fairly early. Light bodied, hops are a little setzer-like in closing the flavor profile. While this brew has clear advantages over American macros, its so utterly ordinary that it screams ""average"" across the ratings categories. I'll take a local lager over this, just to support the regional economy."
""
"Harp:  Not bad.  Had some malt flavors, no hop bite.  Deep yellow, if that makes sense, kind of a turbo charged macro-lager, but not bad, hit the spot.  (for the second time, my computer chewed up my review.)"
"Frothy when poured and a nice light golden colour. Impressive brew."
"Darker golden color with a thin white lace on top, lots of bubbles. Couldn't get much of an aroma, all I could smell was the pub atmosphere. Slight grainy flavor with some hop bitterness towards the end. Finishes fairly dry. Not bad, but not a whole hell of a lot to love either."
"This beer is very average. I dont know if Id bother drinking another."
"Grey-orange color with no bubbles except what is forced out by the pour. Baby-Swiss cheese pattern to the head. Gym socks and honey on the nose. Good balance of crisp grain, bitter hops and light, silky malt, finishing clean and racy. Soft enough for a novice."
"A standard ""go to"" when I am in a new bar with not many selections. Nice golden hue, and a tang of crispness. No bad aftertaste here. I can keep one of these in my hands through the night. Also goes great with pub food or pizza."
"Pours a pale golden color with a small, thick, stable head.  Slight floral hop aroma.  First tastes seemed a little mix of sour and citrus.  The beer is a little sweet, and has a nice, semi-dry, bitter finish.    Not outstanding, but solidly drinkable."
"A good lager, not as full or flavorful as Stella but good.  Has the usual color maybe a little darker than some lagers (especially US).  The smell is simple but not negative.  The taste is crisp, but really there is not a whole to talk about there.  As far as drinkability goes, assuming you can stand to drink a bunch of lagers, you could drink this one all day.  I prefer to start or end my drinking with them however..."
"A well bittered Irish lager, Harp is indeed crisp and smooth with full body, going all too quickly from your glass."
"Pours a nice gold color, frothy head with nice fair lace and active carbonation . Malt nose with some floral under tones. Start is malt sweet, the middle is somewhat thin. Finishes clean and fresh. Fair hop presence in the finish balances it all out. Nothing great but an above average lager."
"Very drinkable and tastey macro-lager/pilsner.  Cheers!"
"This beer I have had in bottles more than on tap.  It was a dark straw color and formed a white head that left little lace.  It had an aroma of hops and the flavor was of hops with a slight bread aspect.  The finish was light, and a touch dry and bitter."
"Hmm.  Nothing to be inspired about here.  A decent pilsner, crisp, a little citric, refreshing, blah blah blah... seems to me, if you've tasted one pils, you've tasted them all.  Thankfully this isn't always the case, but Harp Lager is your usual run-o-the-mill pilsner."
"Very impressive lighter, crisper alternative from the makers of Guinness. Nice flavor and a great pour. I am not typically a fan of Lagers but this is the exception."
"One of my favorite beers.  This is one of the best lagers, in my opinion.  The color is a bit darker than most, while the aroma offers a little something extra like a sweet-hoppiness.  From the first sip, to the very last, it is smooth with a little sweetness on the palate.  A fantastic brew.  A classic."
"Brewed and bottled by Guinness Brewing Company, Canada."
"Nice amber color with thick full head, but the rest falls short. Harp is just average lager. There is a slight bitterness that leaves a bit of an aftertaste."
"This is a better than average lager.  It's par for the course in color and smell, but it does have a bit more flavor than most lagers out there, especially on-tap.  It goes down like water.  We used to listen to the Fenians and drink this stuff all night when we'd had our fill of Guinness."
"Amber brown in color with a thick white head, which soon fades to a modest layer that lasts to the end, mild carbonation.  Lace is somewhat poor.  Pronounced aroma of sweet hay, almost honey-like, some alcohol, and botanicals.  Tasting yields malt sweetness, followed by strong and lingering hop bitterness - though not excessive.  Harp merits praise for its distinctive character within the style."
"Back in college, this was the beer you brought along to impress your friends and brag about your Irish heritage. How silly that seems now. Anyway, in just about every respect, this is an average brew. Color is golden amber, with quite good head retention. Smell is clean, slightly fruity, and a bit grassy; otherwise, not very distinctive. Taste is rather bitter, with a slight malt presence, then a really bitter, almost unpleasant finish. In the end, this is just another mass-produced macro, albeit better than its American counterparts, and with a bit more mystique than it probably deserves."
"Good lager.  Had on tap.  Nice head, amber color.  Fresh smelling of hops with a smithering of fruitiness.  Full mouthfeel with nice blend of bitter hops and sweet malt."
"On tap -- What a surprise. I actually enjoyed Harp. Nice near amber colour, decent lasting head, creamy mouthfeel, light sweetness, cling-y soft & faint buttery flavour and a fruity backbone. Extremely easy to drink and an excellent session beer."
"Bright gold, bubbly, with a big white head that disapates too quickly.  Hay in the nose. Clean, crisp, balanced.  A step up from Budmillercoors. Two questions - 1. What is the point of marketing Harp as an Irish beer if it is an imitation of American lagers and brewed in Canada?  2. When I drank this back in the mid and late 80's, my impression was that it was far more like Sam Adams than it was to Bud. That is definitely not the case now. Is my memory false, or has the recipe been dumbed down to meet Bud's invasion of Ireland?"
"Light golden in color and typically clear.  There's not much more going on in aroma than typical for style-- a bit of floral and herbal Hersbrucker noble hop nose and mellow, w/ light bready grain.  The relatively low hop bitterness and flavor along with a lack of prominent malt profile render this beer a bit bland, but considering it's more or less an American style lager, there's more going on here flavor and aromawise for style. Although fairly drinkable, I don't plan of having this one again anytime soon unless someone hands me one."
"An overated lager, bland with an edgy taste, i'd look elsewhere first, but still drinkable, but theres nothin in this beer that i can appreciate."
"Good for a lager, but still a lager. I've used it for Half and Halves with Guinness before and since I'm not the best pourer, when I got to the bottom and there was more Harp than Guinness it was a dissapointment."
"Thin head forms a nice sturdy lace. Grainy nose. Meek sweet malt character finishes bitter hop and fairly clean. Tastes three times better with a Guinness Stout sitting on top of it."
"A decent lager.  I wasn't expecting much from Harp to tell you the truth, but it poured to a nice, golden color in the glass and left a ton of lace.  Slightly sweet with a nice hop twang on the finish.  Very drinkable."
"Nothing exceptional about this beer although I do like it better than just about any other american lager.  Good body for a lager.  Nice bit of hop bitterness, more flavor than most of its peers.  A nice summertime cookout beer.  This is the family favorite at the barbeques in the summertime.  All in all only slightly better than average in taste but cool and refreshing in the summer."
"The pour a translucent golden color, the head is a nice white color, dies fairly quick and leaves a decent lace. On the nose malt dominates the aroma, crisp, fresh and clean as a well made lager should be. Lightly sweet up front, good hoppiness, clean in the finish. Overall a decent lager, alot of cheaper options though."
"A decent no nonsense lager for the masses. Very clean taste and slightly more malt backbone than your average lager. If this is the style you like, this is as good or better than most."
"Poured from bottle, had an excessive head that was frothy and maintained.  Very pleasing  malt aroma.  Crystal clear, bright pale gold.  Quite smooth start to finish, with no over powering characteristics.  Finish was dry and somewhat long with a hop bitterness .  Flavor is mostly malt, but aspects of the hops are present. Mouthfeel is medium and unnoticable considering the size of the head.  Would really like to try one on tap in Britian."
"not bad."
"Bread and butter lager.  The name and reputation make you expect more."
