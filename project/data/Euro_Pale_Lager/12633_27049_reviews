"It looks just like any other mass-produced pilsner, but has a Very uninviting taste of metal and corn. Very little aroma (if any at all). I would not get this again."

"Food match: Greasy doner kebab with extra garlic sauce."

"500ml can. Lager glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Pale straw color. Crystal clear appearance. White, brief crown. Herbal, hay aromas & cardboard odor. Sweet malting & citric bitterness. Grainy & fizzy. Light body, high carbonation. Watery texture. Dry bitter finish. Fat & boring."

"Certainly not to be repeated. Fortunately a distant memory once I was in the middle of dinner with a bottle of Macia Batle Crianza."

"Overall: Not great, but not the worst I've had at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but if I was buying for a barbeque on a really hot day (which we don't really have in Ireland) I would pick a couple up. It's cheap, and tastes so. Refreshing ice cold and easy to knock back."

"Meh. Subpar, even for industrial lager. Extrememly bland and tasteless - this really is for those times when you're dying of thirst and there's nothing else on offer. Give it a miss."

"Dull beer. In every aspect. I chilled it, poured in a pilsner glass, and tasted it thirsty and willing to be merciful. But it disappointed me - it's just average colored, average smelling, under-average fruity tasting pilsner with pricky aftertaste. Felt bloated after an hour."
"O- Very much on the sweet side, but still decently refreshing. It actually drinks very easy"
"O-Nothing too special,usual beer,usual taste."
"Pours clear yellow with a medium, frothy, white head. Sweet malts, light corn, mild citric bitterness. Medium carbonation, fine light and mildly dry finish. Flavour is sweet, mild malty notes, some sugar and quite a bit of lemon zesty bitterness in the end. What can I say, this would never be a go to for me, but it tasted OK on a hot summer day."
"25cl brown bottle purchased in Spain and brought back by my father. Pours a crystal-clear straw yellow body with not a whole lot of head to speak of. Smells faintly sweet, fruity, bready, with hints of cooked vegetable. Bread with hints of apple, pear, caramel, with a noticeable herbal hop presence. Hints of butter and cooked vegetable toward the finish. Easy-drinker. Light bodied with moderate to full (but not overly done) carbonation. Not as clean as it could be for the style, but the flavors, while a bit subdued, are noticeable and harmonious. I actually like it."
"275ml bottle. 5.0 abv, brewed in UK, half a finger head, clear, light brown colour. Slight paint smell. Tastes slightly of wheat, no real hop content. Chemical aftertaste. Lots of carbonation. Not one for the beer geek/snob but has it's place in the beer world"
"Per se the beer is not undrinkable, but is without any claim, without elements of interest and ultimately noise and essentially useless. Fortunately that has at least a few alcohol degrees."
"Few aromas on the nose, a very important carbonation that gives the body enough sparkling. As far as taste, we feel the grain but without much conviction, just like a beast european-style lager and so it remains watery. As for the bitterness, it is not interesting enough to raise the level of the beverage. The latter also has a very bad reputation, and it hardly seems unreasonable."
"O: Medium drinkability. Standard Euro Lager with notes of adjunct malts. Not impressive"
"Notes: Really just an average lager with nothing setting it apart from countless other Euro Pale Lagers. A bit on the sweet side with not a lot of hop presence. Decent for a beer just to drink on a hot day, but nothing special."
"I've had a hard day teaching electrical fault finding to 15 students and this is the beer I've choosen to chill with. It is refrfeshing and pleasant enough and you can just about feel the 5.4% ABV within it. No huge flavours or tastes though, just a run of the mill Euro pop sort of beer. I've drank it many times on Spanish Islands (Ibiza and Formentera) and have never had any problems with it, ideal for quenching a thirst on a hot day, but not a 'must have at all costs' sort of thing. Better than average, but only just."
"D-Had this last night w/a spicy dish: an interesting chicken in cocoa sauce. The beer went okay w/it, but at times the phenolic band-aid still showed through. Yes, this beer has a lot wrong with it, but it's still drinkable w/fare that drowns out the flaws."
"D: wouldn't seek this out necessarily, but not horrible either."
"D: Not bad when you're thirsty. Unavoidable to drink once you're in Catalunya."
"Overall a delicate and well balanced refreshing lager. These went down very easily."
"D: If you're going to quench your thirst this could work, but if your not into the very pale lager with small taste and aroma I suggest you avoid this one."
"I had this on-tap in Barcelona and was more pleased with the result than I thought I would be. It pours a hazy, sort of yellowish type of color with a fizzy head and give off almost no smell at all. I was able to detect the maltiness afterwards, but it never left any adverse taste in my mouth. I would try this again, but only if I could find it on-tap."
"Pours a solid, dense, bright white head that fades quickly leaving a few specs of lace. The pale yellow beer holds a few streams of carbonation. Aroma of a nice Pils. It's a mix of light malt sweetness and herbal hops. The pale malt sweetness is a bit overpowering and the mild hop bite doesn't stand a chance. There is a faint stale grain flavor that tarnishes the flavor, and the beer has a kind of corn sugar tasting finish. The mouthfeel is simply average. It is too sweet, and there are some faint off flavors that bring this beer down. It's a not-so-good Pilsner, which I guess is what makes it a Euro Pale Lager."
"I tried this beer for the sake of trying it going in without any high expectations. Had it iced cold in a pint glass. Poured a bubbly plale yellow color with a fast fizzing head. Smelled of mild hops and a little sweetness. Taste was thin and barely hopped with a touch of citrus. An OK beer to sip on a hot day but don't go nuts."
"Nothing really sets this beer apart, but it is very drinkable. It would make a great session beer."
"Pours a white frothy head with a good lacing. Most of the head diminishes rather quickly, but about 3 mm head remains. Clear yellow, sparkling body. Fairly weak aroma, just like many other mass produced pale lagers. The initial flavor is a little bit sweet, but it soon turns into a more bitter flavor. It doesn't taste of that much, apart from this slight bitter taste. Light to medium body with a dry texture."
"Overall - I must admit that the initial taste wasnt too bad, however it was followed by a horrible acidity, characteristic of many mass produced lagers. A one dimensional beer with many flaws but at least the taste is better than some of the other ""macrolagers"". It would take a pub with a really poor selection to force me onto this lager."
"Drinkability : bière pils moyenne, brassée par San Miguel, sans intérêt particulier"
"Sampled a few bottles of this brew in northern Italy. It's a yellow-golden liquid with a thin head. Nicely, the head presents a thin and soapy sheen of lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is uninteresting. A bit of grain, and some malt in the nose, but not much else. It clearly smells a step above typical macro swill, but the aroma is faint and uninteresting. The tast is a bit better. Sweet, with a little malt and bread up front. The finish has a little corn, and a bit of a cereal adjunct flavor as well. Light mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable. This one is not half bad."
"Would not drink this again"
"I have tasted this one right after a local brew from my hometown and this one was by far the more pleasant lager, so have to be careful not to overrate this one ... the first impression is a full body and a ""malty feel", which is good ... however I am not a friend of sweetish lagers and this is definitely on the sweet side, for sure it lacks any refreshing bitterness ... so on the overall, a rather average lager ...."
"Overall: no news here. Another macro lager. Nothing special. Spain has better beers."
"I wish it would taste and smell like a natural brew and not some mix of malt & hop extracts. Don't waste your time trying."
"*I later found (when offering my second alcoholic drink) that I had to pay for that crap. yes, 2.5 euro on Air Plus Comet. I mean, I can understand they charge for rubbish on short euro flights with easyjet, ryanair, vueling, condor, skyeurope, germanwings whatever....but a 10hr flight charges drinks, and offers shit? next time I'm flying Iberia or Air France (they serve free, err, prepaid grimbergen)"
"San Miguel Especial  Euro Pale Lager, 5.4%. Ubiquitous in southern Spain, this review is based on a sampling on tap from the el Rancho restaurant at the Marina del Sol resort outside Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol. A can I saw later listed corn as an ingredient. Comes out clear solid gold, perhaps a shade or two darker than standard, under a one finger white head that looks thin but lasts remarkably long and leaves excellent sheets of lace most of the way down the glass. The nose is full of sweet barley malt, tainted ever so slightly by the corn and with a touch of hops spice. The mouth is light and very prickly. The flavor is pretty standard, with malt up front more bready than corny. A pretty decent hop bite follows, leaving a good mixed finish and an enticing aftertaste. I expected horrible, and got pretty respectable."
