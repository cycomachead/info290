"I picked this up around Christmas of 2013 at the HEB in McAllen, Texas, there was nothing special to it, and it is one of the pourest beers from Belgium. It poured golden, was cloudy, with a soapy head, and lots of carbonation. It tasted like any other massed pale ale, with a watery taste, little edge, low alcohol content, and not filling."

"O- IMO, Stella serves a similar purpose to Corona and might benefit from a lime. While I say that, I should mention that this is definitely a superior beer to Corona and I'm not knocking either beer in any way. Stella Artois is by no means the best beer I have ever had, but it is pretty good nontheless."

"Stella is a highly carbonated golden yellow beer with an oddly metallic taste. It has a champagne-like appearance at times. I find it acceptable in the same circumstances as other pale lagers, however it is not something I prefer by any means. While leagues ahead of domestic counterparts, I feel that Stella Artois is a Budweiser or Corona of Europe. If you're expecting complexity, this is not a good beer for you- it is simple, thin, crisp, and sparkly."

"A very full body and rich beer overall. The appearance of it is a light yellow color with the smell being a sweet earthy and almost faint smell. The taste is crisp and refreshing for a beer and overall very tasty. Mostly a mans beer but a good beer overall none the less. I would for sure buy this at a bar or in store even"

"Report me a review, is a beer you ask me? No not really. This is what I drink for the beach. Not too few or out of reach. This is better than anything here in Costa (aside a rare dark), this includes the locales, hermano. The visual is clear regardless the tint. There is nothing more to this stint. Taste and mouthfeel out beat any male prostitute, looks better than my piss. I finalize this retort."

"The overall - this beer is drinkable, maybe not likeable, but it's drinkable."
""
"Pretty descent beer, pretty smooth with a light white head to it. The taste is probably slightly average, but then in finishes sweet and leaves you feeling satisfied. I can see girls being attracted to this kind of beer. It starts out slightly too bitter but then gets better. Its a good beer when its around cheap beers because they make this beer taste great compared to them."
"Drinkability: Light.crisp refreshing. Drinkable but not very interesting. Good in it's category. Good beer for watching sports and snacking."
"Belgian in origin, but not at all representative of the region's preferred/famous style, this pale golden lager with a thick lace does manage to stand out among the plethora of mainstream lagers out there. The scent is almost floral - a definite spicy, hoppy sharpness and presence. The taste follows this, with more complexity and depth than similar brews. Not half bad, and a solid step in-between mainstream and craft beer."
"The taste is probably slightly under average, but then in finishes sweet and leaves you feeling satisfied. It's supposedly a girly beer, but I don't think many girls would appreciate it. It starts out slightly too bitter but then gets better. It's a good lightly above average beer when nothing interesting is around."
"Good drinkablity this is a pretty good beer and would recommended to someone that hasn't tried it yet"
"D: easy to put down, but not calling me back from the taste."
"Drinkability- Is drinkable because it's a light beer but would drink other beers instead"
"Served from tap into a Weizen glass. Pours a golden yellow with one finger white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of wheat and citrus. The flavor was of citrus and slight malt. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very refreshing brew. Not my favorite brew I've had, but definitely not the worst. This is the one I go with for a lighter brew when the other options are not good."
"This is an amazing pale lager from Europe. This is a great beer if you are a fan of European style lagers. It is really light in color and it is smooth. A good summer beer. The only down side to the beer is it' s scent because it smells a little burnt. Aside from the smell it is a nice refreshing pale lager."
"I understand it seems a lot of people in this website like strong heavy beers, so if that's the case I guess this is not it for you, but to me this beer is perfect!"
"Although light and airy this beer has a very bad after taste to it. the appearance of it is good, if poured correctly the head usually is about 1/2 and inch thick smell is very desireable but i personlly can not sit and enjoy this beer like i would with other ones of its style"
"Start here...but move on, kids."
"Drinkability- Easy going, but pretty nondiscript."
"Stella is quite possibly the worst beer I've ever had. It looks fine, has a mediocre nose, and the mouthfeel is nothing to write complaints about. The taste, however, is where this brew fails miserably. Approaching the average aspects of its presentation otherwise (appearance, nose), one would expect something smooth with little to write home about. Frankly, I expected this beer to be drinkable. The flavor is so off it makes me wonder what they used to brew it, it couldn't have been barley for I can't find a hint of those flavors. The hops are no where to be seen, tasted, or smelled. This brew fails with flying colours."
"Has a stinky smell to it that can be off putting."
"A little skunky smell. Color is pale yellow with a small one-finger head. Loads of bubbles. Taste is average, but a little different than what I expected. It's got an almost ""buttery"" flavor with hints of pepper with some lemon zest. Beer is better on tap than in a bottle."
"D - we drank this stuff like water years ago, guess it's an ok rep for the style but it won't end up in my cart again"
"This beer pours a pale yellow colour with an average one finger fluffy head that fades slowly with hardly any lacing,it smells quite funky really like off watery hops,it has a below average mouthfeel and just tastes like water,malty hops nothing really too it here,and its funny too cos in australia this is considered as a big euro beer which usually goes for $60 a carton or more so yeah i definately cant see what all the fuss is about with it definately not for me."
"Fairly priced and goes down smooth so it could be sessioned easily."
"This beer has a very offensive odor, that dominates its otherwise mediocre to poor qualities."
"Taste is very bland and skunky. One of my least favorite beers."
"Drinkability: I might have a few with some food, but I would not drink this by itself"
"It's a pretty good brew and it's probably best had with food. It's not a beer that I'd take on by itself really. It goes well with BBQ foods and Pizza."
"Overall: A pretty good restaurant beer, goes great with most food and is highly drinkable, one of the better lagers."
"Over all I would rank it an average beer. Not something I would go out of my way to get but if its there I don't mind drinking it."
"D- i dont want to drink anymore of these. it gave me a stomach ache its so bad"
"Got this from LCBO's Beligan beer gift set. Pours pale gold with about a two finger white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is fairly standard for this style lager with a malty accent. A bit of spice up front with a little bite to it in the end. Minimal lacing. This beer is very well balanced but I found it (not suprisingly) to be fairly watered down. Very refreshing and very quaffable, but like most people say, the price is too high for this standard lager."
"Presently on tap at the house and drinking one right now. Definetly much better on draft than bottle. Very decent pour. Beautiful creamy head, even in a plastic cup. Very nice. The beer has a nice golden appearance. Definitely not a heavy European lager, a bit on the light side, not bitter at all. Would recommend this one to someone looking to get away from domestics and into the European market. Not bad for a mass marketed inexpensive European."
"Watery mouthfeel, nice carbonation (best part of the beer), and dry aftertaste. A place that serves this probably also serves more appealing alternatives - go for the alternative."
"I can't complain about this beer, wasn't anything exceptional, but it also wasn't a bad beer either. Had a spicy taste in front of a crisp wheet taste. Smell was kind of grainy. Appearance was golden yellow with a 3 cm foam head pure white. Mouthfeel was crisp, sort of wattery though. Very drinkable though, finished a tall of it with some salmon for dinner."
"Yes, it's a good, drinkable beer. Completely overpriced, though."
"OK at best"
"Had this sitting in the fridge for a few months. Don't remember how it got there, which is not a good sign. Checked the freshness dating and it's still ok. Pours pale straw with fluffy white head. Little retention. Bit of skunk in the nose, but just slightly. Tastes malty, a little bitter and some background sweetness, but overall dull and dry and a bit metallic. Crisp drinker for the pseudo-trendy bar crowd. And how trendy that is for me to say."
"This is better than Carlsberg and Kronenbourg. That's the best I can say for it. I drank alot of it when I lived in London for a few months. In bottles, it is inconsistent (sometimes skunked) but on draft, it's smooth, the corn taste isn't too bad, and it's really cheap. A good session beer, if you aren't out to really pay attention to what you are drinking."
"it's drinkable just not memorable."
"It's been a while since a had a beer so boring I kept forgetting it was sitting in front of me! Never again."
"The only thing that I was dissapointed with was the smell which was pretty bad. There wasn't much head, and no lace to go along with it. There was thin, thin, thin lacing that wasn't sticky either. It went down really smooth, and was pretty solid for a Euro Pale Lager. Don't drink and review."
"Eric"
"Stella is simply a very drinkable beer in bottles, and even more so on-tap, if you're not looking for anything overly interesting, exotic or exciting."
"*Side note, before I said this would not get you hammered. I had 16 oz with a big meal and I weigh about 240lbs. ABV is listed at 5.90% on this site. Assuming that's true (and I have seen them change ratings before) then this may get you hammered pretty quick after all. If you have to have a beer and are driving, this isn't the one."
