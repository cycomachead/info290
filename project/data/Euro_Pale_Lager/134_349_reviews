"One for all. Classic. No holds barred."

"I actually thought this was a pretty good beer."

"Nothing special, poor Belgian beer."
"My first beer; as a teen living in Belgium back in the 80s, this is what I thought a beer tasted like.  It's a bit bitter, but thats what made it so memorable.  Not to shabby, but age has made me realize that it's been above average.  But you don't talk bad about your first kiss either."

"It's your average pale lager, with a golden hue and a faint aroma, it does what you want it to do. It's like a better tasting Stella Artois. For the price, it's definitely worth it."

"O – Meehhh. This is okay, it is drinkable and I suppose it is doing a fine job for what it is but it just feels and little dull to me. In short it is nothing to write home about."

" The taste is pretty ordinary and on the sweet side but not much malt depth and lacks any real hop flavor -pretty cookie cutter lager flavor which is low flavor and best enjoyed chilled. Overall I didn't mind this it is not metallic or grainy as some in the style but it does not stand out either."

"O-This brew is ubiquitous in the old country, but that doesn't make it great. Anyway, I would rank Jupiler one or two small notches above a BMC macro AAL type lager if only for the slightly interesting smell and the slightly heavier mouthfeel."
""
""
"Eh, it's okay. It's probably better than a skunked Stella though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is easy to drink and tastes like an average pale lager, but without any flavors of adjunct malts."
""
""
""
"D+"
""
""
"O: Medium drinkability"
""
""
""
"Cheap and nasty tasting lager, I'm amazed that this is the best selling beer in Belgium and quite frankly it is an awful lager."
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is pale and golden yellow hued with a half inch of white head. A nice appearance for the style. The aroma brings grain, malt, lager scents. The flavor is of macro lager and tastes as if it is mass produced. Grainy finish, lingering bitterness. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. This was just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the thing we liked best about this beer was the cooling aroma and the clean finish to the beer. The nose was softer and less bitter than many of its competitors, and the following taste was equally as pleasant, for the style. Throughout the tasting, however, things never seemed as fresh as they could have been. The flavoring was there, but it was not very robust, deep, or very complex."

"O- Easy drinker, decent taste. Good as a quick refreshing beer"
"As far as I can tell, this is the local substitute for budweiser in Brussels. It is the cheap fizzy lager that everyone in every cheaper bar buys by the caseload while watching whatever the most interesting sporting event is. I my opinion, it is better than bud/miller/colors/fosters by a small margin. The hops strike with a bit more edge, and the malts are just as good. Light yellow body with tons of bubbles. This takes 3rd place in my personal line up of macros, behind viru and Nile special."
""
"An average pale lager, on the plus side not too sweet."

"Cheers!"

"Medium thickness and light carbonation."

"Jupiler on draft at 't lammetje in Brugge. 25 cl. Straw color. High clarity. White fluffy head. High retention. Pilsner aroma, light fresh hops. Taste, lightly bitter, slight sweetness, similar to a German pils. Can't even tell the difference. Decent beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Nothing special going on here.. high drinkability but nothing that sets it apart from other beers in its style category. It's basically the same as something like a Stella Artois."

"Don't believe those Belgians who will tell you how this and Stella Artois are a thousand times better than Heineken or any other Dutch lager. That's not true."

"Having grown up in brussels on jupiler, and the rest, I know the standards of this beer can vary wildly. If served correctly, ice cold, in an immaculately clean 25cl glass, and in a bar full of friendly belgians, jupiler is hard to beat. I dont know what their export beer may taste like, but I think it is a lager that is balanced, maintains its head to the bottom of the glass, has lacing that runs the length of the glass, balances bitterness at the end with the sweetness that first hits your lips, and is really quite refreshing. Looks like lager should look like, served with a two-finger head that hangs around long enough. As far as commerical lagers go, it wins hands down against all the terrible commercial lagers from anywhere but belgium and germany."

"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, basic and standard European lager smells. In the taste, a sweet to dry corn taste, but basically a standard lager. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry aftertaste. I just drank this on the bus from brewery to brewery just so I would not lose my buzz."
"Enjoyed a night full of Jupiler in Belgium. A fair amount of head sat atop the brew for a short period of time. There were not many noteworthy smells and the taste was somewhat bland, yet pleasant at the same time. I'm not sure if I would buy this in a store if I saw it, but I wouldn't hesitate to order it on tap in a Belgian bar."
"Pale blonde with one finger of white head, lots of lace left on the glass. Smell is malty and not particularly aromatic, lightly grassy, mild sazz hops as well. Taste is malty up front, touches of caramel throughout, mild hop profile, there is also a cardboard like taste that comes and goes and was more noticeable towards the end. Average feel for the style, med carbonation, light body and feel. This isn't bad for what it is, its pretty close to being stella or lowenbrau or anything similar, one was ok on a hot day sitting on a patio but i will take a pass on this next time."
"Had this on tap at Fionn MacCool's. Waitress just said it was called Jupiler, so I'm assuming it is the standard one. Served in a branded glass. Pours a clear golden yellow colour with thin white head. Nice enough head retention, mild lacing. Smells pretty clean, some mild grassy hops and a bit grainy. Flavour has a hint of bitterness. This is a pretty nice lager on a hot day on a patio, so it hit the spot. Nothing worth seeking out, but I enjoyed it."
"Because I'm drinking it from a bottle it is difficult to say anything about appearance and smell, but the rest of the features is extraordinarily nice for a cheap commercial beer. It is worth stressing that it has something from Belgian ales - sweetness and banana aftertaste. I will definitely buy a crate of Jupiler the next time instead of Grolsch, Heineken or Hertog Jan."
"ÉcouterLire phonétiquement"
"Looks good poured the standard Belgian bar way, 2-finger head scraped off at the top. Light hop scent. Great beer for an all night social event, nothing too serious here, very fresh and dry, even tinny. Like its sister brands (Stella, Maes, Martens, etc.), soft texture and goes down fast. My personal choice for a fun night out."
"So why is so popular with Belgians? I blame the advertising industry (and InBev or whatever their name is at the moment), plus the ignorance of some Belgians when it comes to matters about beer. I'm sure that something simular could be said about the most popular beer in your country, no matter what it is!"
"They have a lot of bad ones."
"On tap into a Juliper glass at a random bar in Oostvletern...Pours a piss clear gold, a white head with ok retention, but nice sticky lacing...The aroma is light grain and skunk, not terrible but I'm not happy either...The taste is light skunk, really pretty boring, a Belgian BMC but about 50 times better than BMC. No reason to ever drink though."
"Better than your typical euro pale... but still unmistakeably a euro pale."
"Best served on tap."
"D: I suppose this is average undrinkability for the style, Although I'd probably reach for something with less off flavours if I want an easy drinking lager."
"D-nice and drinkable for sure but nothing really interesting going on here. I might pass next time."
"This one was sent to me via a friend in Belgium along with a few other beers. In terms of what I've come to expect from a good Belgian ale, this one is forgettable."
"Pale gold color. Nose grain, like the mouth that tastes also cereals. The smell is quite unique grain and easily identifiable. The body is light at first but with a mouth-taste with a bitter taste characteristic of the Jupiler which is not really nice and comes quickly in the mouth. You can feel the finish of the bitterness of cereal a little dirty but pronounced."
"Notes: Seems like this is one of the Macro-like offerings in Belgium. Not bad and probably slightly more flavor than Macros in the US, but if you are in Belgium there are so many better beers. I got this as a last resort eating in a fast food place because I wanted a beer to go with it, and this is what they had."
"The only thing which is a bit less is that it gave me a slight headache the next morning!"
"M & D: Overall this merits a below average drinkability because it feels like not much effort was put into it. I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered it, but I did expect better."
"Purchased from the Coke machine at Gare De Midi in Brussels for $1.20. I can't seem to find it on Beerfly. Jupiler pours a light yellow with hints of gold and a thin white head that doesn't stick around. The aroma is mostly grainy but there are some floral hops in background. The flavor is light and dry but there is a pretty decent bitterness and some hop flavor hiding in there. Hints of honey linger in the after taste. When I was in Belgium (at least where we visited), this was the everyday beer, if you asked for a beer it's what you got. It's certainly nothing special, especially compared to the alternatives in the country, but I would much prefer it to its American equivalents."
"Well, I guess I found Belgium's answer to Schlitz! This beer was absolutely boring and tasted pretty gross. I got a can of it for my train ride out of Brussels and I wasn't expecting much, quite honestly, but I figured that the Belgians could at least make a cheapo beer more palatable. I was wrong. This was definitely a no-go. I drank it right from the head, so I didn't get a really good look at it but it was quite light from what I could see. Kind of a rank smell, but I think that's just how it is supposed to smell. Don't bother with this one, folks!"
"Had this beer on tap in the European Union Area of Brussels. The beer looks like a typical pilsner, with a nice white head. The smell is nothing special, and the taste has some strange malty sweetness mixed with the regular bitterness that a pilsner should have. A decent beer for a hot summer day, where as other people also mentioned, any other pilsner would do. Only I didn't like the this type of sweetness in this beer...."
"A typical beer to flush away some food or to drink on a hot summernight when any cold pilsener will do."
"Worked pretty well as a thirst quencher or as a ""woman's beer""."
"Notes: I had to try it when in Belgium but now I will not likely again!"
"got this can at a shop across from the train station in Schaerbeek, Brussels, Belgium today. I don't like stinky beer and this one stinks, literally, like cabbage farts. Poured with a really nice big foamy textured head and a little lace. Pale clear gold color. the aroma shows up in the flavor too, but not as bad. Still. Hard to get around that."
"Can't believe this was actually RECOMMENDED to me at a Belgian beer cafe. It's not a terrible beer but just a fairly unremarkable Belgian lager. Some hop action and body but really I could've got that anywhere. Excessively disappointed because it was recommended but tring not be too harsh. Tis what it is."
"I would not recommend this beer."
"I had this on tap at a bar in Amsterdam, which was sort of criminal given the fine Dutch and Belgian ale choices elsewhere in town. This looks, smells, and tastes like Miller to me, which is objectionable. Budweiser is at least 2x better than this. You'll see it available everywhere in Belgium or the Netherlands, I recommend a pass."
"Don't spend to much on a bottle of this but if you ever make it to Belgium, give it a shot !"
"A highly drinkable beer and quaffable for sure, but not much here."
"Got a tiny (25 cl) can of this from some Belgian friends who came and visited. Not really my thing, to be honest, but it's the thought that counts. It's basically your standard euro lager, with maybe a little less skunkiness in the odor and flavor than most, and a little spiciness in terms of the malt, especially in the nose. Mediocre, if a little above average for the style, and you could drink a bunch of them if in need."
"Drinkability: Pretty good! A refreshing, if flawed and unremarkable, light lager."
"Overall: refreshing and crisp lager. Enjoyable quenching beer for a hot day."
"Quite mediocre for a Belgian beer. Standard look and taste, nothing special here. A sour edge when it first hits the mouth, but finishes nicely. Bought this while travelling on business in the Southern Netherlands... there are much, much better local choices here."
"I like to call this a drinking game beer."
"Review translated from french 6-1-2008."
"I had this on tap in Gent and it was very good. Its a nice change from the stronger, tastier belgian beers."
"Not a bad beer for what it is. Consumed in mass quantities by the Belgian proletariat, it quenches the thirst and helps to wash down some of that hearty Belgian food. At the same time, if you are in Belgium there are far better beers to be had! Go out and try 'em instead of just going around the corner to the local bar or convenience store and getting this."
"My impression of this beer is that it is the Budweiser of Belgium. Every crappy bar in Belgium has a Juplier sign out front. I eventually gave in and had one (in Amsterdam though) just to see how it was. It has a very light crystal clear amber body with a pure white head. So far, the Bud comparison holds true. The taste is where they differ. It has a light malty body with slight hop bitterness. The nice thing about this beer versus Bud is that you can actually taste the malt profile; even if it isnt the best beer flavor Ive tasted. The body is as light as a Bud would be, but it has slightly better drinkability."
"Crap, crap, crap."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink because it's boring."
"Drinkable, but for sure not a beer to search for."
"This stuff is really excellent drinking beer-- nothing outstanding, no noteably unique traits-- just WELL-MADE BEER, and very drinkable."
"Final Thought: This is a major disspointment to come from the country known for it's beer. Luckily it wasn't a typcial Belgian ale but a cheap Bud-like lager."
"Pale yellow with brilliant clarity and a dense, but slightly rocky, white head. Quickly reduces to a small ring, but produces some nice lacing. Noble hop aroma with a marshmallow sweetness in the flavour and aroma. Light yeasty character and mild bitterness. Balanced towards sweetness. Finishes on the dry side with some hop character. Light body and high carbonation. Starts with crisp CO2 then becomes moderately creamy. This beer is light and simple, fine for sitting on the patio in the summer, but nothing special."
"Taste is like nose was being oxidated, empty, creamy and aftertaste is litle sweet-bitter. Lack of taste and lots of off tastes make this brew unenjoyable."
"Overall: Not too bad. I would have this over Stella, Tennants, Harp etc."
"Pretty average-crap macro lager"
"It pours a light golden colour, with abundant carbonation and a negligible head... The nose is dominated by water-biscuity to light cider kind of sourness, while on palate it's refreshingly malty, with lime-peel kind of hoppy bitterness and finished with exactly the same taste. The body is extremely light against its strength(5.2%abv) and overall the mouthfeel and structure is at best mediocre. I can't quite grasp the fact, so it's claimed in the beer catalogue for Wetherspoon's May Beerfestival, that it's the ""most popular lager in Belgium""...surely the Belgians know much better and deserve better, even Interbrew's Stella Artois is less boring than this lager?!"
"500 ml red can with ""50cl MAXI' on band around top - brought back direct from Belgium (Thanks for sharing, Jeff). Pours OK, clear, blonde color, with a 1 inch head. Although it is highly carbonated, foam quickly disappears. Smell is of some grain and alcohol. Not much taste to speak of. Obviously meant to be light and refreshing - like water on a hot day. Overall, a pretty basic brew, comparable toaother macros here. I do like the crest on the label - a bull doing his best Karate Kid stance."
"The smell isn't very good, but still not as offensive as some others in this style. The taste follows that up in a similar manner. Hops come through in the wrong sort of way, and it's definitely too sharp in the mouth."
"Not bad. I had this one on tap at a Karaoke bar in Brussels, I was already drunk out of my mind, and this was all they had on tap, so we went for it. It's a dark golden colour with an off-white head. The aromas are simple and consist of light hops, light malts, and a bit of grapiness. The taste is a bit fruity, dry, and stella-like. The drinkability is good, as the mouthfeel is very light and refreshing."
"Pour is translucid golden tone no carbonation except for an easy-fade-off medium head, smell is a bit strong malty and hoppy, taste is full with a nice comfy body, a bit extra bitterness at the end."
"A simply awful diuretic that degrades Belgium beer. Nuff Said."
"Cheers from Cyprus"
"This seemed to be the swill of Brussels ... beer for the masses though few real cafes carried it."
"Had this several times in Belgium. It was commonly served in small, ridged glasses which would raise the fingers from the glass surface and keep the beer cooler, for longer. Not a bad brew, refreshing."
"Notes: Not too bad. Not fantastic either, but, we would definitely not dump this."
