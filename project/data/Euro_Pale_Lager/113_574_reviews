"Honey sweetness to it."
""
"Very crisp clean and fresh tasting."
"What makes this bottle of beer go over the edge is the bottle design as well as its organic nature.  You can taste the quality and craftsmanship, no additives or preservatives (or at least the chemical ones)."
"Overall/Comments: This is one of the better beers I have had in quite a while.  Beer is very drinkable with spot-on flavor and nose.  A prime example of the style.  This a must try lager.  Consumed 1/8/14.  Classified as a Euro Pale Lager @ 5% ABV."

" The taste begins with malt that is mild and yeast fruitinesss with a slight apple/pear quality wiht subtle sweetness level and a hint of spice in the periphery with a slight toasted grain flavor in the middle. The flavor is on the dry side with herbal hops adding to the flavor with mildly bitter taste as it finishes. Overall I consider this very good - a clean lager with a lot of flavor -excellent drinkability for the style"

"This is just a great beer.  Such a simple brew solution yet the product of this labor is perfect!  It's the only lager I've ever found to have malty legs.  Its perfect blend of barley and hops gives you the sense that its malty and bitter attributes are released on to your taste buds for an epic battle (which is ultimately just won by the hops army).  The finish is crisp but doesn't leave your tongue feeling dry.  The complexity of the competing flavors makes for a fantastic taste interrupted by nothing as the malted barley and hops in this beer are organic.  It clearly makes a difference.  I would enjoy this beer in the company of the most boring and annoying people in the world."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/15/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops ,and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean and robust flavors for a pale lager as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent pale lager style. All around great balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth, crisp, and clean to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Everything about this beer is above-average for the style. Refreshing every time, consistency matters. Organic ingredients, why don't we see more of this happening? This is my go-to lager when I need a break from IPAs and Stouts. Highly reco!mended"

"I was definitely pleased when I had this after work a few weeks ago. It is fresh, crisp, and sweet with notes of caramel and honey. I feel its simple enough that all the ingredients blend perfectly with each other and no one part is overwhelming. Its fresh and herbal to start finishing with a smooth caramel spice. I will without a doubt be drinking plenty of these this autumn!"

"O: This is a classic European pale lager that excels in appearance and drinkability. Very sessionable and quite modest, it delivers a distinctive pale lager flavor without the downsides that accompany many and would pare nicely with a variety of foods, especially light meats and anything greasy (I'd love to wash down some fish and chips with this one). I've come to expect this level of quality from Samuel Smith and they again did not disappoint here. Extra kudos for brewing organic. Cheers!"

"Flavor: nicely balanced lager with sweet malts holding forth but enough floral hops to even it out. Overall: I can’t find anything to criticize about this beer. Excellent and enjoyable."

"Poured a pale straw color with a tall, foamy head. The head disapated quickly and left a bit of lacing. Citrusy aroma from the mug I poured it into. Pleasant taste -- malty with a crisp, wheaty finish. Excellent palette ... creamy and smooth. I would stock up on this one if it wasn't quite expensive ($4+ for a 550 ml bottle)."

"Overall: The gold-standard for Euro Pale Lagers, in my book. A great beer in an underappreciated style. This one really showcases the subtleties pale lagers can have if brewed correctly and this is indeed a masterful example of such."

"Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager Beer pours a brilliant, clear gold, with about a 1/2"" of fluff adorning the top. Bubbles are consistently rising, indicating a fair amount of carbonation. It's almost perfect, as the head also clings to the side of the glass nicely. The nose is that of fresh baked bread, and the smells of Spring fields. A soft, European hop aroma can be detected within as well. While the scents leads one to believe the beer will be delicate, the taste is much more vibrant. It's got a hearty, buttery malt taste in the background with the crisp, yet floral hops coming in next. The fading sensation in the finish is gradual and pleasing. The mouth feel is very light, borderline watery. The best way I can describe it is that the back of the throat is filled with the presence of the beer on the way down more than the beer actually coats the mouth during each sip. This is a great beer to get someone started on the finer lagers in life, or for any beer enthusiasts who are skeptical about European lagers or lighter ABV beers in general."
"Overall, a decent, quaffable beer but not worth the steep price it commands. I would much rather drink a Baltika 3."

"And maltheads, sign up ..."

"O- One of the more intriguing beers I've ever had. The smell is OUTSTANDING and I may buy again based on smell alone. The taste is just as compelling for what it lacks in comparison to what it has to offer."
""
"For whatever reason, I have Aerosmith's ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing"" stuck in my head right now... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-buttered biscuit, very light grass, and a hint of honey. The taste holds notes of dried honey, light toffee, even lighter biscuit, and a vague sense of funky lemon peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, though I could possibly see this working well on cask (don't ask me why, I just get that impression here), it just didn't do it for me out of the bottle. This is quite the letdown."

"O: A very clean and simple lager with nice flavor and great drinkability. Good price point, as usual with SS. Definitely recommended for those who like lagers"
"Raul was pumped on this, but he highly disagrees with it. Raul will use it to clean his windows instead. Peace!"
"O - This one is easy to enjoy, wouldn't mind a few in a row at a wedding or the like. Much better values to be had though. Look elsewhere."

"This is a good beer. It has a yellowish gold color, and nice head when poured in a pint glass. The taste of it is similar to Sam Smith's Organic Lager, but with less of an acidic aftertaste. The soft water in Pure Brewed Lager helps it go down smooth and easy. There is a good amount of carbonation that blends well with the grainy aftertaste. It's very pure tasting with well balanced flavors and texture, something I can drink regularly."
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. One of the best Lagers I've ever had"
"O- I've been meaning to try a few of the Samuel Smith lagers but haven't because I'm accustom to paying no more than a dollar a beer. When i'm made of money I will be buying bottles of these in place of tall cans."
"overall? dang! i like it. 5%, too. plain wrapper. plain beer. refreshing. maybe it's NOT a commercial beer in england, afterall . . . .seems EVERYTHING samuel smith is EXCELLENT. way better than that samuel ADAMS junk too...."

"The alcohol was spot-on too and had I hard another bottle, I would have downed that after finishing this. I wish more lagers were this floral and easy to drink. There's nothing flashy here but this was enjoyable and ups the ante for a style that doesn't get a whole lot of love!"
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and some slight grass/hay aromas. Taste is much the same along with a slight fruity note. There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is very refreshing and very easy to drink."
"This is a decent light-bodied lager that's easy to put away. It has a nice, corn flake-like flavor that is welcomed in a see of musty, watered down Euro lagers. I would try this again if I were in the mood for something highly sessionable."
""
""
""
"O - Tastes really good and hits the spot. Nothing overly complex, but doesn't need to be."
""
""
"A solid pale lager, of the European bent - full, comprehensive, and thorough - you could be forgiven if you think I'm talking about insurance policies, but, no, it's a lager - and a damned good one at that, if stiff British upper lip-ism is your thing."
""

"O: A beautifully poured lager with a clean, refreshing taste. Extremely easy to drink."
"The appearance was almost perfect,..good smoke after opening, nice blonde color,very busy with bubbles and good robust fluffy head and lots of lace. Looked like a TV commercial. The smell was also very enticing, an aroma with a clean malty sweet odor and yet some bitter hops to it as well. The taste is wonderful...again a great balance,very satisfying,no after taste, a wonder how they get both a malty robust taste and yet so light and a bit of hops to it as well. Overall just one of the best Ive had,and would recommned to anyone who likes beer."
"Pours a light golden color, white head forms and little lace. Aroma of lager yeast, some fruityness, fresh buttered bread, mild floral notes. In the taste, almost has an ale yeast fruityness, with apple and pear flavor. Some buttery diacetyl, bread and leafy hops. Not too bitter, but hardly too sweet either. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, carbonation is at a low medium. The feel is a little flimsy and not quite as crisp, but still fine. Overall, a decent lager, plenty of character, has that Samuel Smith's taste, more than probably from stone vats the beer is fermented in."
"Overall another solid Smith, but I prefer their other lager beer than this one."

"When you search for an offering from England, a lager does not usually come to mind. Despite the cost this lager is worth trying even though it pales in comparison to Samuel Smith's ale offerings."

"Clear and light yellow in color with a nice fluffy head. Retention and lacing are solid. Aroma is mostly bready malt, cereal, a touch of grassy hops. Plain and to the point. Taste is very much the same, straightforward pale lager, mostly a clean malty flavor with light hoppiness, faint bitterness, very crisp and easy to drink. Very moderately sweet. Solid carbonation, short finish. Decent session choice, although I feel it’s the least interesting beer I’ve had from Sam Smith’s and I generally prefer the German lagers to begin with."
""

"A very good Euro pale lager--perhaps a great one. That being said, the style is quite limiting and simple in nature."
""
""
"This poured a clear yellow with a finger's width of off-white foam. Smell was clean mildly sweet biscuit malt. Taste was biscuit malty, caramel, quite refreshing. Not bitter. Mouthfeel was almost creamy in a medium body with nice carbonation. Good lager, nice drinkability, another good one from Samuel Smith."
"o: a good clean crisp classic looking beer that would be very sessionable and help steer others towards craft beer."
"As far as Euro Pale Lagers go this one is pretty good. Probably wouldn't seek this one out though, definitely better lagers out there."
"O: A very decent offering by Samuel Smith; I do like their stouts much better, though. This is great for a long day of watching football and eating nachos. Enjoy."
"My pour gave me a finger-and-a-half of thick eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Perhaps I should have waited until a dreary February day to have opened this one ... Nose smelled of pure, unadulterated lager - slightly sweet with an underlying earthiness. It is never going to knock your socks off, but when you have been on a steady diet of AALs as I have been with The CANQuest (TM), a clean adjunct-free lager is a welcome treat. Mouthfeel was medium with a honey-like taste that is (or should be) lager's trademark. Man, I just weep for what we Americans wrought with Prohibition. People developed a taste for bootleg hooch made with whatever was at hand and lost their taste for well-made beer. Boo hoo. At least some breweries did not do away with their traditional recipes. Finish was clean, refreshing and semi-sweet, just as I would hope all lagers to be."
"O: This beer is great. It looks good, tastes good, and feels good. It’s not the best lager I’ve ever had, mostly due to its lack of zest in the nose and palate, though it’s not offensive. It’s a drinkable lager that Samuel Smith should be proud of. And if I can get my hands on a few more bottles, you know I’ll be a happy man."
"This lager pours crystal blond in color with a generous fine bubbled head that lasts fairly well. It has a nice balance of hops and malt. It is what most lagers aspire to be. Lovely taste, that one does not tire of. Definitely worth trying. It is a bit expensive in the USA for regular consumption."
"This beer pours a golden yellow color, with very little head. The smell is a bit sweet, and there seems to be a bit of an apple juice aroma. The taste is lighter, just a bit of hops, a bit of malts, very balanced, and I keep picking up a flavor like apple juice. Light flavor, easy to drink, but wont stay on the palette long. Overall decent, nice in the summer, I would get it again, but i wasnt blown away."
"O - Quite a bit better than SS's Organic Lager which preceded this. Very drinkable..."
"All in all, a great lager beer."
"O: As usual a good beer from Sammie Smith. Very unique and quality flavors."
"This beer poured out as a traditional golden yellow color with a pretty good foamy head on it. The head fades after a few sips and leave a little lacing in the beginning. The smell of the beer had a typical lager aroma, grass and a little skunk to it. The taste was pretty crisp and clean. It's got a nice bitter finish and a little bit of sweet grains in there. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side with some good carbonation. Overall this beer is a decent one to have when you got a group of people over and just wanna offer a good beer to them."
"Notes: Sam Smith has done it again. When you think that Britain is all about ale, a lager such as this comes along. Very tasty and easy to drink. It's one of the cleanest brews I have tried. Very refreshing."
"This one pours a clear golden color with a tiny head. Lacing is good, nonetheless. The aroma on this one is pale bready malts with a touch of mineral water. The taste is just a nice crisp lager, the smooth malts and just a hint of hop zest make for a tasty lager. The mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is just about right for the style. A good lager from Sam Smith's, probably not worth import prices though."
"Tastes great, more malty than typical pale lager with nice grainy notes, caramel sweetness, and a lemony bitterness that all goes down easy with balanced carbonation. Extremely drinkable but enjoyable on a higher level. While you could throw back a 4 pack of these easy, you really want to slow down and enjoy them more."
" As far as Lagers go I think its got a lot af flavor and could easily drink a few of these in no time. nice little beer all around!"
"D - Could easily down 10 of these and not notice."
"O- This is an A plus Lager but will never get that because of its Lager lack of luster as compared to big time brews. Its great washing down a meal with a beer that has some taste to it."
"Value: Paid $2.50 for a single 12 oz. Great deal!"
"D: I could see myself drinking a couple of these, especially on a hot day. It's a rather straight forward beer, and a good example of the style."
"Try again boys, whew."
"Pours a honey-yellow color, moderate level of carbonation, two-finger white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Has a bit of a bready aroma, taste is quite nice with a mix of sweetish malts and a mild hop taste in the finish. I noticed that this beer seems more medium-bodied than most lagers, was a bit thicker but nice. Drinkability is high, this is a refreshing beer that still tastes good after it has warmed up a bit. This isn't Samuel Smith's best beer in my opinion, but if you are a big fan of old-fashioned, all-malt lagers, this is a good choice."
"The palate opens moderately hoppy with a moderate bitterness and a rather robust hop flavor. Earthy and mineral-like, the bitterness quite perfectly balances these flavor components. While I don't know my malts very well, I could almost swear that there is some Marris Otter and pilsner malt in here, there's a complex, delicate sweetness present. A little bready, this tastes moderately rustic. Almost a touch fruity, this beer dries out on the finish with a lingering bitterness. Carbonation is high, this is a top notch lager."
"D - For this style, easy to drink and tastes good. A fine choice for the Lager lover."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent lighter beer with a little bit of substance making it worth drinking for a while."
"Pours a pale yellow with a small short lived white head. Aroma of light malt, cereal, and lightly fruitiness. Taste is malt, some grains, a light fruity notes. Palate is light to med body with moderate carbonation. Finish is light malts, some cereal and light fruitiness. Overall an average lager but drinkable."
"Lighter to medium body, decent carbonation, refreshing profile throughout. Smooth feel combined with solid flavor makes this a pretty easy drinker, although the higher price tag is a bummer."
"Pours a hazy golden with a small short lived white head and nice carbonation. Aroma of apple, honey, yeast. Not much hops in the nose for the style. Light body with herbal hops dominating the flavor with some citrus and sweet malt in the background. Finish is short and dry. Brits should stay with ales."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking Lager more than one would be no problem. Not an overwhelming beer."
"Drinkability is off the charts with an exceptional lager like this. Great smell, great taste, great feel; it has all the qualities of a great beer. Samuel Smith knows how to craft excellent, no-frills brews. None of that triple hop advertising garbage. Just a delicious drinking experience through and through."
"This beer pours a dark honey golden color. Aroma is of a slightly dusty grain bin full of recently harvested grain, with a hint of floral sweetness. It has a full malt and grain flavor, a bit of the musky lager funk and a slightly crisp, slightly creamy finish on the mouth. Pretty good overall but does not stand up to some European lagers that are more flavorful."
"Soft, and pleasantly drinkable."
"Pale yellow with a finger of white foam. Replenished by the glass. Smells predominately of very fresh hops. A nice springy smell, slightly sweet. Has a weak flavor, nothing strong. Reminiscent of American style lagers. But a good balance, and quality tasting. Quite bitter on the end. Feels very light in the mouth, again like American style lagers. Carbonated moderately heavily. Overall, this is a nice session beer, quite refreshing on a hot day in London."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty smooth. Mild sweetness up front, low carbonation in the mouth. No aftertaste, wet finish. Some graininess but its not bitter or astringent. Just nice. This beer is highly drinkable and I can see it being a nice light lager to sip on a hot day (such as today). I would definitely drink this again."
"Certainly drinkable due to its light character, I was expecting a bit more in the complexity department. I'm sure it would be very refreshing as a session beer."
"Refreshing and smooth, great session beer."
"Price is a little on the steep side for what it is, but I can't think of too many examples that are better for a lesser price."
"Overall, an easy drinker, with plenty of character and flavor for all seasons. This was great on a bar rooftop on a humid summer day. Good to try for sure."
"Light chill haze that quickly disappeared, leaving the beer a bright gold colour. Sticky white foam coated the top of the beer in a thin layer and a more substantial collar left clumpy lace on the glass. Nice aroma, malty, caramel and biscuits, honey, light hoppiness with notes of fruit and grass. Good balance, enough bitterness to keep the flavour crisp while letting the sweetness of the malt and grassy/herbal hop flavours stay in the spotlight. Light caramel. Lingering bitterness and mineral character. Slightly crisp carbonation, light to medium bodied, dry, the texture's more rounded and smooth than a good pils. Easy drinking and quite tasty. I'd pick this up more often if I couldn't get less expensive high quality lagers on a regular basis."
"From the 355 ml. bottle. Sampled on June 5, 2010. The lot code is smudged on the bottle altough the last few numbers seem to be 511. Too bad because it is a good indicator of whether my bottle was better or worse than someone else's. The pour is light yellow, a bit cloudy, with no head to speak of. The aroma smacks of freshness as well as a bit of malts and floral notes. The taste tenbds to be a bit better with more emphasis on the malts and creaminess. It is not bad but Samuel Smith's brews many that are better."
"D: Definitely a well-brewed lager."
"Very good drinkability. A great beer to enjoy on a hot summer day. Definitely another good one to ""session."""
"550ml bottle into a pint glass. Very pure appearance, like it was brewed with nothing but the purest ingredients. The first whiff reveals aromas of malt, hops, yeast, water and purity. Pretty tasty, too. It's got a nice bit of maltiness to it, though it's quite dry and crackery. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Mild lager yeast character. Dry, bitter and hoppy finish. Yummy yum yum, I like beer."
"In summary, if you're looking for a smooth and tasty lager with a nice aroma, you cannot go wrong with this lager from a truly elite brewer."
"Wife picked this up for me....though I'm not sure I would have on my own. My mistake. Pint glass pour and I am met with a crystal clear light yellow ale with a bright white foamy head which quickly dissolves into a thin layer. Malty aroma with some rice, grass and earthy tones. Very refreshing taste. Crisp and clean with some mild spice and a lot of light malt. Very clean finish with a minimal aftertaste. I was expecting a somewhat lingering aftertaste from the aroma but I got none of that. Nicely done. Light carbonation in the mouthfeel and very dry, thin sips. A very easy drink and very refreshing. A hot summer lager to view the days going by."
"Nice clear, light golden straw color. White fluffy head with some stick, lots of carbonation bubbles. A lot of simple sugars on the nose, a LOT of apple, a bit of apricot, a bunch of light wafer. Pleasant and snack-like. Taste is just as sweet and has a pronounced floral quality that twists quickly into a decently bitter finish. Mouthfeel is slick. A good, crisp linger and dryness at the end. Drinkability is definitely above average, but it's enough like a dessert beer, imo, that intake of a 550 ml bottle will suffice. Very nice."
"Pretty damn good brew especially on a hot spring day. Great balance of quaffable and flavorful. Top Notch!"
"Very drinkable, delicious. Fantastic as the months get warmer here."
"This is a pretty standard euro pale lager, nothing special."
"Overall - A good example of an EPL that's NOT in a green bottle. Also try the very similar River Horse lager."
"Drinkability: easy drinking beer. Flavor profile is a bit mellow so one 550ml bottle may be enough for one session."
"Drinkability: well, its flavor is not my favorite but overall it is a pretty drinkable package. In a hot-weather or hot-food context, I'm sure I could down a couple of these; however, I doubt I'll seek this one out in future."
"Overall, this one of the, dare I say, best lagers I've ever had. If you like Heineken or are a macro lager drinker, try this well-crafted brew. You will realize instantly what a true beer drinking experience is. Many thanks to the Samuel Smith Old Brewery out of England. I intend to try more of your beers in the future."
"Flavor is lightly bitter, crisp with a nice bite, clover honey and biscuit flavors dominate. Some mild hop bitterness and a fleeting impression of grass or weeds. Light bodied and a little too watery. Ultimately clean with no off flavors and an agreeable taste. Quenching and easy going. A benchmark lager."
"Notes: Skeptical at first, this side by side comparison of organic vs. non organic showed me that organic can possibly really offer something. Interesting."
"Served from a 550 ml brown bottle. Pours a medium golden hue, with a significant head with moderate retention. Leaves a pleasing, significant lacing. Aroma is malty and creamy, with some very subtle vanilla notes present in the background. Taste is very well balanced, with a nice malty character set off by hops on the aftertaste, along with a hint more of vanilla. Very good mouthfeel; full and creamy with a satisfying richness. All in all, this is a very drinkable and pleasant beer."
"Poured from a brown 18.7 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smeels of malts, a bit sweet. Taste is crisp, malty finishing slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this mkes for a decent selection."
"A very drinkable, clean crisp lager. Does more need to be said? It is nothing complex, but is a great basic beer, promising nothing more. A clear, clean, bright yellow pour with a small bright white head that lessens to little leaving trace lacing. Thin-bodied, but crisp & clean, this is a a refreshing lager with minimal hops & basic grain-malts that don't try & be more than that. A nice beer to down after a tough day."
"Overall, really unimpressed. Somewhat suprised considering their organic lager is fantastic. This is probably an old bottle, it sure tastes old. Review over."
"Overall - This is the kind of beer you could give to your BMC swilling friends to give them a taste of what's out there. Us beer geeks have seen and tasted stuff that's way more exciting, but sometimes you just need a nice, simple, good-tasting brew without pretense. This is that kind of beer."
"Cheers!!"
"Drinkability: Superb! Proof that lager doesn't have to taste like abrasive fizzy water. There is no hint of the horrendous metallic taste that affects the vast majority ""Euro lagers"". This is a lager that should be on tap at all pubs instead of the generic macro crap that seem to dominate."
"It's hard to say that this is one of my favorites, because I'm a fan of bigger darker beers, but for what it is, it's quite nice."
"I usually don't like lagers, but this was very clean and refreshing. It pours a crystal clear straw color with a foamy head. It delicately laced the glass. The smell was very clean. The flavor was refreshing, consisting of light grain and a gentle noble hop tartness. The finish was crisp and dry."
"A very nice pale lager that I will drink again."
"this has it all quite consistently. a nice mild apple malt nose. mild sweet fruit with a woody twit earth finish thats brisk, present but refreshingly not lingering. i would compare it closest to an Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier. quite similar... i think i'm going to even do a parallel tasting this week seeing as i like both so much."
"D - Certainly sessionable. A good british take on the Euro style pale lager."
"D- Moderately high to insane. A bit pricey, but worth a try...for some of you this is a must-buy."
"Notes - Could use a little more carbonation."
"D- This beer is easy to drink and smooth but I wasn't expecting that much sweetness in a lager. It was nice to taste some lager qualities and some ale qualities and have a good depth of flavor. I would love to try this on cask next time I hop over the pond."
"This is a very refreshing, summery type lager. My 1st thought when I took the sip was me lounging in the pool with a glass of it. It is very flavorful but not overly complex. I am a huge fan of the maltiness!"
"Pours an extremely clear, extremely pale yellow colored body, with a huge frothy white head, lasting. Vegetably aroma, corn, straw. Malty. Some sweetness too, like something I can't place. Maybe sweet corn. Corny, vegetably taste, especially in the aftertaste. Sweet taste. Clean. Refreshing, but still a lager. Carbonated body."
"D - Refreshing. Extremely drinkable beer could have many of these without being overwhelmed by ABV or taste."
"Beer drinkers distinguished by candor and insight boast in their inborn belief in the superiority of Samuel Smith beers. This lager is a harbinger of success. It is teeming with life. It is Unreservedly, unequivocally, and absolutely right, and I feel called upon to asseverate that Samuel Smith's Brewed Lager Beer will flow in a notable way amidst the mountains of God. I would say so in the presence of an Apostle."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus foamy white head, with some small islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some lemon notes, slight spice. The taste is slightly sweet on the lips, malty, nice little citrus note, with a slight spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew."
"Off-white head slowly shrinks on top of the clear golden yellow body. This really is an amazing lager. The floral and herbal hops provide just the right amount of spice and bitterness to balance the sweetness. What can I really say, it's another great beer from, what is in my opinion, one of the best breweries."
"This lager pours a brilliant light golden color with a moderate fluffy white head. The aroma is sweet grain and floral European hops, quite pleasant. The taste is sweet, with a bit of grain and there is a nice hop presence to balance the malt. The finish is quenching and satisfying. Overall this is a well put together beer with some nice flavor."
"Exceptional tipple."
"Drinkability- I have now had every mainstream US imported Sammy Smith brew and I am very impressed. I will be buying many of these in the future."
"Of course, anytime you have good memories associated with a good beer, the beer becomes one of your all-time favorites. Consume this beer when you want some good memories with good friends. Cheers!"
"will keep this one in mind as one of the better lagers."
"Like it's organic counterpart, this is clean, easy to drink, and darn good. And they taste practically the same as well. Hmmm, imagine that...."
"Going by appearance, this looks just like any standard lager. I'd bet money the folks here on BA would never bee able to tell this from a macro. However in every other category this is a full step or two up. It's not an over the top hop bomb, nor a heavy ale with a high ABV. It's just a very pleasing, simple beer which hits the spot."
"For the style, I enjoy this beer. It is clean, crisp, grassy, flavorful and simple. Not every beer needs to have a quarter pound of spices or a half cup of hops poured into every bottle. This is great in the simplicity of it. Good session beer, well rounded taste."
"Easily the best lager I have had. Another great offering from Samuel Smith."
"D - I'm not a big fan og lagers, but this would be a good lager to give to friends stuck on American macro 'lagers'. Crisp, refreshing and flavorful."
"Good thing it comes in the bigger size bottle, cuz it goes down quickly and 12oz would not last very long."
"Bottle from Winking Lizard. This beer pours a clear pale orange-gold color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly. Spotty lacing. The aroma is mildly hoppy with a bit of malt. Light-bodied with a light hops and malt flavor with touches of grass and fruit. The finish is lightly hopped and short. Overall this beer is rather subpar."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - One could find themselves drinking copious amounts of this beer, at least I sure could. From start to finish this beer left me wanting more. Sip by sip, I absolutely loved its rich caramel start, and dry hopy finish. This was my first Samuel Smiths beer, and it wont be my last. I definitely recommend you try this, you wont be disappointed. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A generally pleasant, well-balanced lager that has all impure brewed lagers beat by a mile."
"Future outlook: I look forward to drinking this again when the heat returns...."
"D= good I feel like after a little time I would want something a little more interesting bit its truely one of the best lagers around"
"The first from my Samuel Smith Gift Pack (hand-picked by ""UF""... thanks UF!). Larger (half liter?) bottle. Decent pale yellow color and nice foamy head, a bit hazy with light carbonation visible. Fruity hops (a la euro lager) in the nose, with malt coming through in the first sip, but balanced fairly well by the hops. As euro lagers go, this one was free from the typical ""skunk"" smell and I attribute it to the really heavy brown bottle it came in. Quite drinkable and enjoyable, but not particularly complex. A fresh alternative to similar styled offerings from Europe."
"D - This lager is easy to drink due to its lightness and thinness. It's got the typical watery taste that makes it easy to down a few."
"From a brown bottle - Pours a very light pale yellow with almost no head or carbonation. Smells of sweet malts with just a tad of light hops. First sip is sweet with very little hops coming through. Pretty much flavorless. Finishes slightly bitter. Well under carbonated. Not much happening here. Worth skipping this one!"
"D- easily a sessionable beer. This would be case worthy in my eyes. I dont say that too often. I nice beer for the weekends for football. Go Steelers!"
"Poured with a nice head and some lace has a nice light malty aroma. Pleasing gold color. Nice body. Very well balanced. Not a lot of flavor. Super subtle. Clean. Just not a lot there. Finish is similar to the rest. Guess it's not bad, kind of boring. I like all the other Sam Smiths a lot more."
"This beer feels more like a thirst quencher to me. Something you would drink after a hard days work out in the yard and, or while grilling out side on a hot summer day. You can also include fishing on that list :-)."
"Overall, this is an above-average pale lager, but nothing that will amaze anybody."
"Hops and yeast on the nose, a classic straw gold color in the glass. Typical S.S. perfect frothy head that displays great retention and laces like a champ. Smooth on the tongue with a good mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated. Flavors are nice but a little watered down. Some hops and subtle malt. Clean ,crisp finish. Very refreshing. Not my favorite style but a great example of what a Lager should be."
"Sam Smith, based on this and past offerings, is a fairly formidable brewery and I am always on the hunt for their beers."
"Not a powerhouse brew by any means, this one reminds me very much of Rogue's Kells Irish Lager, and that's a good thing!!"
"Thanks for the 12oz bottle mom and dad. Pours a light, clear amber with a quick eggshell had that very quickly recedes. The aroma is a very musty toasted malt. The taste is pretty bready with some light floral hops. Very musty, adjuncty palate with maybe a littl citrus here and there."
"I have been a fan of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stoat for quite some time and after recommendations to try this I was not disappointed in the slightest. I still can not believe how very smooth the drink is. Definitely is one of the best lagers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I can now believe that Samuel Smith Breweries can do no wrong with their beer making. Highly recommended if you enjoy lagers and this will get my highest grade yet."
"Poured with a darker shade of gold with a thick head at first that settled to a creamy lacing on top and throughout the glass. Aromas are a bit thin but apparent of biscuity hops and more of a floral sense that its organic counterpart. Taste is much sweeter than Smith's Organic Lager with an almost spiced, herby aspect to it. Mouthfeel is still superb with a great crispness, balance and lightness that does not, at all, take away taste. Overall, I preferred the Organic one more for its consistency but the Pure lager from Samuel Smith still has great dimensions."
"MF&D - Very crisp and clean tasting. Thin bodied and extremely drinkable. If you like pilsner you have to try this lager."
"Strange to have bought a British lager--here goes. Pours a bubbly, transparent golden body with a swiftly thinning, white head--looks ""pure""... aroma is reminiscent of of an Eastern block pilsner--crisp sharp malts and perfumy yeast... full-bodied yet pleasantly mouth-watering and satisfying with a buttery-smooth presence in texture... malt is soft and sweet--balanced with a mellowness that invites another... lagers are tough to argue against when they present little flaw, and the Samuel Smith brewers aren't about to offer a second-rate anything apparently... clean and crisp, as a lager should be..."
"Another excellent offering from Samuel Smiths.Found this at a nice little spot in Dunedin,Fl (Kellys). Beautiful crisp golden near perfect looking. The smell was sweet and grainy, as was the taste. Very drinkable,on the highest levels. I could enjoy this flavorful Lager again and again,and I will next time I see it!"
"I picked-up this very good Lager at The Grapevine in Pocatello, Idaho; it came in a brown 12oz. bottle. This is a very tasty Lager. I'd say that it's a very good brew....actually....I said it...very tasty. Nice and simple Lager. Really nice head that stuck around for a bit. Enjoyed it while gardening. Plain and simple, this Samuel Smith Pure Brewed Lager is a Good drink;)"
"Pale straw color with nice white head. Spotty lacing. Very clean aroma and taste, classic Sammy Smith. Great balance all around, I could drink this all day. The complex grain profile makes it so delicious. Finishes slightly dry. Overall, I dig it. For the style, this is top notch. Cheers!!"
"Enjoyed everything from Sam Smith want to try more! Just goes to show you can make great beer with reasonable alc. and non imperial huge beer."
"D - I've recently become a big fan of the Samuel Smith family of beers, but this was a big dissappointment... Not much substance other then a nice aroma..."
"D: The finish was clean making for a decent lager with pizza."
"D- damn near perfect world class euro lager. tadcaster has obviously lent some of its ale techniques to the making of this one and the result is a wonderfully flavorful, uniquely complex beer the likes of which i could have never imagined. i'm not one for this style, but my favorite english brewery continues to amaze me."
"drinkability is excellent. this is a light bodied lager with excellent flavors and aromas, and a rich profile, despite its light mouthfeel. another excellent brew from Samuel Smith. cheers!"
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It boasts primarily of pale malts and lager yeast with a mild hop scent. The taste is good. It is clean and refreshing. It has largely a pale malt flavor with a light hop taste. It is light and highly drinkable. This is a low bodied beer with decent carbonation. This is the best lager you will have. This is the best lager you can find other than the organic from Sam Smith."
"This wasn't a bad beer, but it might be the least interesting offering I've tried from Samuel Smith's. I assume that perhaps the style itself isn't all that interesting, and Smith's brewed one of the better examples."
"The taste is full-bodied grain that lasts all the way through, with herb and grass elements providing a nice, tingly herbal bitterness that smoothly blends with the sweet malt body."
"One of the better light-lagers I have had."
"Verdict: Can't go wrong with this lager."
"Clean, crisp grass hops are balanced very well with malted barley for a balanced flavor. No hints of vegetable or tin sometimes found in Euro lagers. It's not going to blow anyone away, but there is something to be said for its quality of ingredients. Thin and carbonated mouthfeel, and highly drinkable. Very enjoyable lager from Sam Smith."
"D - This is a pretty good Euro Pale Lager. Much better than others of this style."
"Good beer for sure.. just probably way out of range on expenditures if we are talking about a daily drink. I wish I could brew an English lager this well. but I will probably only buy it again if I am brewing this style."
"Overall, I wouldn't say this is absolutely my favorite beer, but it's really quite incredible. I enjoy beer that's not very dark, or fruity, or spicy, or sweet. Like I said, I'm anh all-American macro lager kind of guy. But this is what macro lagers strive to be, they're just unbalanced at some point. I admit, this is no perfect beer, but wow! Balanced! Smooth! Delicious! EXPENSIVE!"
"Eric"
"I, like most beer nerds, talk the talk about appreciating light lager style beers, but when it comes to walking the walk, tend to only really enjoy big high alcohol ales. This is an amazing lager. What you imagine budweiser tasted like before prohibition. Full rich malt, buttery, yummy and oh so clean. I may never buy another regular lager again."
"On the whole, this was a little disappointing to me. While I've certainly had worse beers, I expected a much richer, more complex beer from Sam Smith. It was like they were intent on imitating lesser, more mainstream beers."
"Poured with a nice bubbly head, mostly small bubbles with a few fisheyes. The brew is a crisp, clear golden yellow. Smells of citrus and hoppy... maybe a little too sweet in my opinion. The taste is clean, with a good amount of carbonation. There is a sweet maltiness to it, but it maintains a nice hoppy bite. It finishes pretty sweet, but dies off quickly leaving nothing but a hoppy bite on my tongue. Definitely not my favorite Sam Smith, but a great lager in my opinion and sometimes that's exactly what I want"
"Simple slightly honey sweet & subtle malt smell with a doughy tang and yeasty, sweaty breadiness. Short to medium lasting bright white head. Taste is simple, somewhat light, but quite good, with a semi quick finish and a touch of lingering sweetness. Nicely carbonated, and a very good, simple easy to drink lager. Nothing that will blow your socks off probably, but a tasty lager"
"An average brew in all respects, sampled many selections from Samuel Smith that I really like, and this was probably the weakest... pours an apple-juice color with no froth and a slight carbonation present... not a very appealing appearance... smell was almost non-existent, very bland, as was the taste which was non-descript and slightly watery... mouthfeel and drinkability were also about average, just wanted to try this one because all of the other Samuel Smith brews were great, this one was a miss... Not recommended..."
"This beer still won't make me a lager fan."
"D: Very easy to put down, and enjoyable to boot."
"12 ounce bottle, $2.57 for a single bottle at Anderson's (East Columbus). Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a yellow/gold color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like sweet malt and grain and nothing else from what I can tell. But it is a nice clean aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some herbal/grassy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light, with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, it goes down pretty easy and it's non-offensive. It's a decent beer overall, but for the price I don't think it's a good deal. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out, but I would drink it again. It's not a bad lager at all."
"Sweet taste of malt, finishes dry and crisp. Body is a bit watery, the only drawback. Nice drinker, but a bit pricey with the import fees. Bummer there."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The near perfect texture in the mouth is fantastic, and the best part of this tasting. Smooth and rolling, it becomes soft like seafoam and goes down easy. It complements the effortless balance of pure ingredients, and would make a good pairing with everyday simple cuisine... from pizza to sushi, this beer lets the food do the talking."
"A substantial beer but has too many tastes in it that should not be in a lager...although it is well made and satisfying"
" This is a high quality lager that is very easy to drink but slightly on the light and thin side, otherwise worth it's $3.49 price tag."
"One of the most solid Euro Pale Lagers I've had. Seems to possess a bit more substance than many others. Not particularly memorable, thus with the price tag it doesn't warrant being an everyday beer, but it's definitely one to try."
"Smooth and mostly clean, this light-to-medium bodied lager is a nice, tasty refreshing brew."
"Final Statement: Definately the least exciting Sam Smiths I've had to date. There's definately better lagers out there."
"Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager Beer pours a golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle that has a foil neck and cap wrap. A little bit of malt is noticeable in the aroma. Toasted malt is strong in this beer's flavor. Hops balance it out toward the end. Very enjoyable lager."
"Honey sweet & subtle malt smell with a doughy tang and yeasty, sweaty breadiness. Decent lasting bright white head. Taste is simple, somewhat light, but quite good, with a semi-quick finish and a touch of lingering sweetness. Nicely carbonated, and a very good, simple easy-to-drink lager. A tasty English lager that surprised me by how much I liked it."
"I see this being a good gateway beer but it's not something I'd quaff regularly. Especially if Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout or Nut Brown Ale is sitting right next to it at the store."
"output. The label is gorgeous. Tasty."
"Very very beery. As in, there's nothing special about this brew, just drink it... but for about $9 a 4-pack! around here, why would you drink it unless money is falling out of your anus?"
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with an average white head that didn't leave much lacing. The smell is of nobel hops and pale malt, bready. The taste is pale malts, cracker-like, with a nice nobel hop kick, very similar to a fine pilsner. Very simple form of a lager, crisp, light, and very refreshing. The feel is light and a bit watery, finishes a tad dry. This is the ultimate in a summer brew (though it is not a summer brew), very drinkable and no odd flavors to get in the way."
"A very fine lager from a very fine brewery. Pours a lighter pale of yellow with a nice head, no lacing, a nice aroma with no skunkiness. This is a little on the thin side as far as body goes, it could be a little bit more dense, but it isn't. The taste is a bit citrusy, I think somewhat lemony, with the hops coming through in the middle. You can taste a wheatiness (or as some would call it) a grassiness in the malt. The aftertaste is mild and the beer does mellow as it warms. It's a good lager, you won't go wrong. It is truly solid but I wouldn't call it exceptional. L'Chaim."
"Light bodied, slick, easy drinking. Low alcohol makes it a great summer night session beer."
"Pours from brown 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Nice golden hue with lots of carbonation. Aroma is grains with faint floral and some pleasant citrus. Taste is rather grainy malts with just enough hops to keep you interested. Very delicately balanced. An excellent lager and a perfect summer session candidate."
"This beer poured a very clear light straw color  decent lacing. The smell was quite hoppy. The taste is bitter and spicy. There is also a hint of citrus. Overall, this is a very flavorful beer. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. Id say this is a refreshing beer that is quite drinkable."
"550ml brown bottle from Florian's. Yellow-amber with about a half an inch of white head that dissipates rather quickly. Caramel malt and English hops dominate the aroma. Tastes like equal parts English hops and roasty/caramel malt, though somewhat aqueous. Finishes rather clean. Lighter mouth feel. Flavor is pleasing albeit a bit weaker than expected. Very drinkable though, as it's pleasant and tasty. Not a great beer, but good for what it is, probably the best Euro-lager I've ever had by quite a bit."
"Poured a hazy pale gold much like a pale ale. Small white head that dropped almost at once. Nose is caramel, toffee, and apples, rather pleasant and unusual. Taste is smooth and round and rather sweet, not a lot of bitterness though the hops are there if you look for them. Finish is dry. A solid but easygoing beer."
"Pours a light, clear yellow with a two-finger pure white head that lasts quite well and leaves substantial lacing. Vigorous surfacing carbonation is apparent. Smell is of grains and light malts. Noticeable hop presence, light and floral, gives this lager some distinction and demonstrates that it's been brewed by someone who knows what they're doing and wants to produce a real beer. Taste is lightly fruity, some citrus showing, with a grassy tone as well. Very clean and pleasant, if not particularly distinctive. Mouthfeel is very crisp and well carbonated, and drinkability is excellent. Impeccable, but unexciting."
"Cheers"
"Overall: A very good lager. Recommended."
"Taste has clean crystal malt and a small amount of residual hoppiness but not much. Actuallly, in general, like the Annoat system (a shout out to Star Wars geeks), there's not much there. There is a slightly unpleasant grassy note to the taste and mouthfeel is strangely overdry one sip and refreshing the next. This isn't even real good for the style, like I expected; I feel a little cheated for my $3..99 for 18.7 oz. It hurts to give Sam Smith such a low score, but I have to call 'em like I see 'em."
"Drinkability: Decent brew. Not as good as some other euro lagers."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable English lager. Flavor focus on the clean and tasty , paler malts. Well worth a try if you like lagers."
"Medium light body with the alcohol well masked, a super easy to drink beer that is very sessionable. A lager that I would definetely recommend and enjoy again in the near future...cheers."
"Pours from the bottle a deep shade of gold with a white foamy head that rises up quickly, maintains very good lacing and a nice layer of head throughout the beer. Light fruity smell with good mouth feel, but I think it fell a little flat on the finish. I agree with other reviewers here, this beer is a quality lager, but cannot quite compare to the quality usually offered from this brewer - which, by the way, is incredibly high. A decent beer, but average when compared to other good lagers."
"Poured from the bottle to a golden yellow, with thick, snow white head, and good lacing. Both bottles I had have foamed out the top upon opening, so Im not sure if it is the beer or handling. Aroma is fruity, mostly lemons, with a hint of floral hops. Flavor is harder to pinpoint, althogh it is tasty and mold, with a smooth fiinish. Although not as highly touted as some of its Samuel Smith relatives, it is one of my favorites from that brewer so far."
"I love Samuel Smith beers, but unfortunately this does not live up to the (incredibly high) standards of this brewery. A nice appearance and mouthfeel but there seems to be a bit missing that prevents this beer from being the usual treat that Samuel Smith provides. Just seeing the name on the label makes me crave an Oatmeal Stout, so I plan on passing on this one in the future to move on to the other well crafted brews from this company."
"Notes: Although I'm a huge fan of Samuel Smith's this is the one offering I'll pass on."
"a nice very drinkable lager, american macros should take note."
"Overall an enjoyable brew when in the mood for lighter lagers. Worth having again."
"Pours clear pale yellow with a nice white head that leaves pretty good lacing. Smell is of fresh cut hay, grass and malt. Taste is dry and crisp with malt and grassy flavors that finish clean. Overall an enjoyable brew when in the mood for lagers. This is definately one of the best lagers that I have tried."
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... Very drinkable and certainly worth a try..."
"550ml bottle: This one pours a crystal clear golden color, with only a small head on it. The aroma was slightly floral, but very weak. It was difficult to make anything else out of it. The taste was quite non-descript. Like the aroma it was OK, but very bland. Certainly not worth the price of a premium beer."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer, and I would probably appreciate it more on a really hot summer day. This isn't a lawnmower beer as it has too much body and flavor. This is a light flavored beer, but could not be used to rehydrate. This is a front porch kind of beer and one that I definitely would like to drink again."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick and creamy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful pale malt scent that is a bit sweet and bisquity. It also has a dry and earthy English ale yeast aroma as well as a light noble hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a sweet and creamy pale malt flavor that goes down slow and finishes dry and slightly hoppy. It's sweet in the flavor, but bisquity and earthy in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good lager, but it has a little too much body for my tastes. This is my least favorite Sam Smith brew."
"Overall: This is reminding me a bit of meads as much as it does beer. This beer is very clean and crisp. Perhaps it's too well crafted for me to want to drink rather than savor."
"Pours out pale golden with a loose, white head. Smells of honey and hefty malt with a nuttiness in the background. Tastes of bready, sweet malts with an aggressive hoppiness that offsets the malt perfectly. This tastes distinctly Samuel Smith and I can't figure out why. I thought at first that it might be the yeast strain, but would they use said yeast strain for their lagers too? Mouthfeel is extremely smooth for a pale lager, but feels a tad too sticky in the finish. This is an excellent beer from the great Tadcaster brewery. Without a doubt, this is the best lager I've ever had."
"Beer poured a nice golden color with a thick head. It had a nice honey smell, and the taste was sweet honey with an easy hoppy bitter aftertaste. It had less carbonation than I expected. It had a decent mouthfeel, but was a little watery at the end. Drinkability? Not too shabby. I could sit down with a few of these again."
"beer # 7 in last nights meeting of the Michiana Coalition of the Drinking. Golden, clear, small white head. malt odor with hints of citrus. Dry taste, somewhat bitter. malt and hops both very subtle. good lager, if a bit weak. i could drink it again but overall its kind of boring."
"D - Definite session beer. If you want a Euro lager then this is it. Stronger than american lagers but still classic in its taste."
"Very clean, refreshing and drinkable. Tastes fresher most the lagers I've tasted from Europe lately. Try it"
"12 oz. slender bottle, served chilled in a pilsner glass. It's a golden hue with a few beads of carbonation and a half inch white head that leaves some lacing. It smells very clean with maybe some grassiness. The taste is biscuity/grassy with a mild bitterness from a light dose of perfumy/floral hops, and the body is light to medium. There are traces of skunk in the flavor. Overall not a bad lager, probably better when it's more fresh."
"I am going to go have one right now!"
"Drinkability - a tasty but rather indistinctive brew. For the price I can do better."
"Probably the benchmark lager."
"M&D: very lively on the mouthfeel and almost full-bodied, but leaving no sugary or sticky residual taste in the end--crisply clean in the finish, making this beer taste just the way a quality lager should be like. The draught/tap version definitely has the upperhand over the bottled one. This beer proves the quality of SS to make not just great ales, but very decent lagers as well!! (but their Ayinger range of lagers brewed under license are not impressive, though... don't know why?)"
"Whether I pay $5 a bottle or $2, I still cannot find a decent Euro Pale Lager that I will order time and time again. Even though Samuel Smith makes some pretty fine beers, this one doesn't do anything for me. Though better than your Heineken or anything produced in Italy, it still seems basic, plain, and flat. Personally, Kroenenbourg is a better and more economically feasible choice."
"Overall I like this. Almost like a maltier version of the Organic Lagar. Something about the Organic that was more enjoyable."
"A step down from the organic lager and ale, but still a charming beer."
"notes: i'm not so into this. it's better than most lagers, but i'm not so into this type of beer. personally wouldn't recommend it unless you're really really into lagers."
"550 ml bottle, pours very light straw, with a long lasting white head, nice malt husk nose and this one leaves moderate and thick lacing. Nice smooth and rounded mouthfeel. Soft on the palate with notes of light honey and ripe melon. Soft and delicate grainy hops in the background and late in the finish. Soft, delicate, understated, subtle, elegant, a fine light and flavorful brew. would be great with some fish, cheese, salad etc etc."
"A pleasant and flavorful lager. In all honesty, I dislike this style, but this version is actually quite tasty. I'd be happy to grab another one the next time I'm in the mood for a lager."
"Went down quickly. great summer brew."
"I don't taste much difference between Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager and Organically Produced Lager. I would think that the word 'pure' would apply more to the organic beer, but 'pesticide-enhanced' probably didn't make it past the marketing department. This is a decent, drinkable lager. I still haven't found an EPL that does much for me though."
"Pours a straw gold with a nice white head and active carbonation. A nice looking lager. Nose is grassy with some very faint spicy, peppery notes. Nice biscuity malt in the taste with some grassy hops in the finish. Not terribly complex, but its simplicity is quite pleasant. Good mouthfeel with the carbonation not too aggressive. A drinkable lager and a good standby if you need a bit of a break."
"Picked up at a relatively good price, so I figured that I would try it. Pours a light golden color with a quickly retreating white head that leaves a nice lacing down the side of my Sam Smith pint glass. Smell is faint but grassy and slightly peppery. Taste is very clean with a slight european hop bite that finishes very subtle. Super drinkable. Nice beer but nothing complex at all, hence the uber short review."
"It's very smooth and refreshing, and surprisingly complex for a lager."
"Pours a deep golden with a thin, but quickly dissipating head. Aroma is a mixture of sweet, doughy malt and some grassy hops. Flavor is begins with sweet malt which is balanced by some grassy and herbal bitterness in the finish. Moutfeel is light and the carbonation is quite low for the style. This is a solid, if unspectacular brew. Although for the price, I don't think it's one I'll be buying again. I can find many local craft-brewed Pilsners or Dortmunders that are more satisfying than this one, and they are all less expensive."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that fades soon leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium bodied. Slight malty/hoppy nose. Light carbonation. Starts with a mix of hops and sweetness, finish is clean. $2.32 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"I really enjoy Samuel Smith brews, but this one I can do without. Pours out to your typical lager golden yellow, with medium carbonation and a short lived white head. Medium odor of hay and barley. Tastes a bit watered down with flavors of hops and stale malt. A touch of sweetness on the finish. Not one of my favorites, but possibly more akin to those who have a more developed palate. Go for the Oatmeal Stout for what I would call a good brew."
"Poured a straw color thin sudsy head with little retention, smell was fairly interesting light hop aroma ,fruit as well, taste was light hop and fruity tang, mouthfeel was thin and watery, not the best Sam I've had, but beats the shit outta a Bud! drinkability is good, I would have another, but with all the other great varieties of Sam Smith, it could take me awhile to get back to this one."
"This was from their 550ml bottle .( I liked the green and gold foil around the top, for whatever that's worth.)It poured a nice pale gold with a decent head that left quickly. There was a nice balance of malt and hops , a little grassy aroma and flavor.I did a side by side with thier organic lager , and I must admit that even though I feel we ingest way too many unnecessary chemicals,this was a much better tasting lager. There seemed it had better carbonation and overall much more satisfying. As a lager drinker ,I will definitely try this one again."
"Overall: Yet another fantastic brew from Samuel Smiths. A true classic. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it."
"A nice refreshing lager, similar but slightly different to the 'organic lager'"
"Very Drinkable. For me personally, I would much rather bye a 4 pack of the Taddy Porter or either of the Samuel Smith's stouts. Overall this is a very enjoyable offering."
"This is a very drinkable lager, or would be if not for the price. A sixer of this would put you well on the way to 20 bucks. Acceptable in a bar, perhaps, but not when you're buying it in a store. This beer goes down easy and it's relatively mild abv guarantees a seasoned drinker several with no dire consequences."
"Beautiful sparkling yellow with one of the most impressive heads I have ever seen on a lager/pils, full bread-like aroma with a nice dose of grassy hop, taste followed suit and did not disappoint, very well balanced, a nice hop intro that backed of quickly to a clean finish, mouthfeel was frothy and full, a very bavarian English lager, tally ho!"
"This brew is a clear straw/gold color brew, with a nice white foam head topping it off. Not much of an aroma that i can detect other than some malty bits. The front is all light sweet malt, some light hop action in the back. Dry finish, light to medium bodied. Nice light refreshing lager, but besides being good for the style this brew isnt my all time favorite."
"Overall Impression: A good lager. Im not doing back flips, but maybe that is just a quality of the style more than the beer. This might be a good one to wean the macro crowd with."
"Overall, it was drinkable, certainly - you could drink a few without being overwhelmed, but there really wasn't anything to recommend this particular lager of any other."
"Picked up cheap due to it just hitting its used by - absolutely nothing wrong with it, a class beer through and through, will be back for some more."
"I try to avoid mentioning price on reviews but given the premium required to acquire this beer (in America), I'd recommend other similar beer before this one. It's worthy of a taste to let you decide whether it works for you."
"Two fingers of white, noisy, rocky head leave arcs and swoops of lacing. The beer is a clear, pale gold. The nose is really quite floral, with lots of sugar and corn syrup. Aromas echoed in the front. A pleasant goldeny (?) malt middle. Finish is quite nicely bitter: hoppy, somewhat grainsy. This is just a good, fresh, sweet lager."
"Medium yellow clear hue with a middling head that's a skim after a minute. Good lacing, complicated patterns. Aroma is lightly grassy, some sense of musty notes, a little like modeling clay. Dry flavor, well-balanced in medium hopping with light but equal shortbread and slight almond characteristics. Carbonation is lively and about right. Nose was slightly off for me, flavor meets quality-Lager characters and the mouthfeel works well. Seems slightly less buttery than Sam Smith's Organically-Produced Lager."
"its been ages. this pours out a clear golden with fat white head. the nose is light, some malt here, light hopping there. smells a bit grainy. taste wise? lemony, raw grains, straw....different. a light hop bitterness finishes things off. strong carbonation makes it crisp, this is a refresing beer. pretty drinkable, not my favorite lager and a bit different than what i usually like, but not bad either."
"The Pale Lager poured a bright gold with a thin white head that settled down to an oily lace. It smelled of malt and hops with a slight citric aroma. It is slightly malty with just the right amount of hops, and features a dry finish with a minty flavor. The feel is smooth and oily with a dry finish. This lager has a beautiful blend of malt and hops. This is a beer that will find it's way to my table again and again."
"Super drinkable, too bad it is a bit expensive."
"Despite the slightness of malt character, the beer is not particulary dry. The flavor has none of the astringency that one associates with North American all-malt lagers, but there isn't the malty-breadyness of many of the German lagers. There's nothing like a well-balanced beer."
"I am almost embarrassed to say this is a beer I recommend trying.... Oh I'm turning into a diry yuppie!!!"
"Overall, This is so watery it goes down quickly. maybe a good beer for drinking games or quenching your thirst after playing tennis but not a beer drinkers beer!"
"anyways, it is very good and drinkable and thats about it. if ever i'm a millionare i think the first thing i'll do is buy a bunch of sam smith and drink it as a session beer. what a night that would be!"
"I would have to say that this beer did remind me of some Czech pilseners that I've had (namely Pilsner Urquell and Czechvar). This beer is almost too quaffable, if there ever was such a thing. I think this would complement a chicken dish very well. Quite simply, one of the best pale lagers I've had."
"Light copper in appearance. Well developed head, but didnt last but a few minutes(due to my glass?). Smell was very subtle to me. It was a slight hoppines aroma. Taste was quite smooth and mellow. Very easy to enjoy. Almost tastes of pears of some other fruit I couldnt quite put my finger on it."
"It really is a lovely lager. I didnt emphasize it in my initial review, but the grain here is just terrific. It makes the beer, IMHO. This is so much better than the standard fare its not even funny. Way to go, Sam Smith!"
"This lager is one of favorites of the style. Appearance is a rich amber with a fluffy white head that retains and laces well. A pleasant aroma of grasses, malts and hops. Taste is on par for the style and is very well balanced with the expected hops finish. Great session lager and a must try whether one is into the style or not."
"A very nice English style lager that is pleasing to the eye and to the palate. The clear golden body is topped by a semi-lasting white head that does very light lacing of the glass. The lighlty malty nose is mild and non-complex, bringing forth the typical lager aroma. The flavor is subdued and malty but dry at the start and through the finish. Very mild bittering and clean, fresh fell with lingering aftertaste. Very drinkable lager beer."
"Sorry Sammy, where it counts, ya ain't got it!!!"
"Appearance: Crystal clear golden with a vibrant white nice formed head minimal lacing as it dwindles though. Aroma: Sweet subtle grassiness with a nice floral soft hoppiness and somewhat a biscuity yeast tone that I come to have found characteristic in most Sammy Smith's I have sampled. Taste: Crisp clean grassy and a great slightly citrusy bitterness with subtle bready tones very nice flavor a session brew if found cheaper. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied good amount of carbonation tickles the throat. Drinkability: Is clean taste refreshing low abv and quite flavorful version of a lager."
"Light straw color, medium head. A light bodied lager. Crisp and light mild flavor. Mild taste. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Fairly well made, very standard tasting lager beer. Nothing particularly wrong with this beer, its very well made just not a lot of taste or flavor to it."
"One of my new favorite lagers but I really had to give it a chance."
"This beer is amazingly average. Pleasant but not great. I guess I one never knows what to expect frrom a generic ""lager"" but I was expecting something more. More color, more flavor, more anything. So what is this beer? I imagine this is what Heineken would taste if it was unskunked and fresh. Not a bad beer but not worth the high price."
"I really enjoyed this lager. It drinks well and is medium bodied. Slightly more dense than most lagers. If you have gotten away from lagers I say try a return(recall. California joke) visit with this one. A great English lager."
"A respectable lager that poured a clear light yellow, faint aroma of malts with a white head that did a disappearing act. Good taste and a pleasant mouthfeel, with smooth and finely tuned finish. I swooned the brew by swirling in the glass as it warmed, hoping to summons potential latent aromas and tastes, but it didn't happen. Overall an above-average lager for future enjoyment."
"The wife says ""I want a light beer, it's hot outside", so I figure, how can I go wrong with a good lager? It poured a nice yellow color with a crisp white head. It's been a while since I drank a lager, or perhaps, I just haven't noticed before: they have hops. It had a slight bite, a good one. Mmmm. A pleasant discovery."
"550ml bottle. Poured a straw yellow, with very little head, and no sign of lacing. Aroma of malt and fresh mown hay. Taste is light, slightly sweet, and also of fresh hay. Mild carbonation, and a smooth and clean mouthfeel. In my opinion a very good lager."
"When poured this brew had a small white head with fine-small bubbles that quickly diminished. There was a lot of carbonation with this brew. The body was cloudy and pale yellow in hue. The aroma was malty and the lacing was fair on the sides of my glass. In my opinion, this brew had a bitter taste that lingered."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized white bubbles that left little lacing and a cloudy straw yellow carbonated body. It has a plesant malt-hop aroma. Ifelt it was a rather smooth brew with a mild hop flavor. Its a nice all-around brew, but nothing special to write home about."
"The beer pours a clear, straw color with a cotton-candy like, bulbous white head. Wonderful smells accompany the appearance.floral hop aromas, mixed with malt and yeast.a little grassy. Taste is solid and clean, with citrus up front and a nice sweet, malt backbone. Finishes clean and crisp, with a nice hop presence. This is one nice beer!"
"I've always enjoyed this beer, and consider it to be one of the best lagers I've tasted. Tonight, I had it in a taste-test with what I consider to be the best lager in the world, Weihenstephan original. The latter won the taste test. The Sam pours a nice golden hue, small head and some lasting lace. Taste is crisp and refreshing, with a flowery, malty smooth fragrance. This is a nice lager, as good as the rest. Just not THE best. That title remains with Weihenstephan (IMHO)."
"This monster pours a pale yellow, straw color with a thin head that will last throughout. An aroma of bread, hops and fruit, very complex smell for a lager. A delicious taste of malted barley, hops, some yeast and bread notes are noted, balanced well. Somewhat dry, but not too much, and malty on the palate, very pleasant and easy to drink. Clean, crisp, one darn fine lager, to be expected from Samuel Smith!"
"Clear pale golden color with a moderately sized snow-white cloud top head and quite good lacing. The aroma is quite sweet and perfumed, like freshly mown grass and honeysuckle. Tasting yields smooth, slightly sweet malt, followed by mild lemon hop bitterness. Finish is crisp and very dry with lingering metallic notes. A well-crafted beer that is a pleasure to drink. Praise too, for the brown glass bottle, just as elegant as the clear version, but affording protection to the precious beer."
"Pours a golden straw color with a medium-sized fluffy white head that dissipated slowly leaving a very thin lace. Aromas are of malt, hops, and apples with mild hay-like undertones. The taste is very similar to the smell with just a hint of apples in the finish. This is a very smooth and easy drinking beer. Its a very refreshing beer to have on a warm spring/summer day."
"Golden-straw in color with a white head that dissipates. The aroma is of sweet English malts and hints of grain. The flavor is of sweet malt, with a bit of grain. The hop bitterness is subtle. This is a very clean, refreshing, easy drinking lager. A decent lager, but nothing really stands out to make me want to sample this one again."
"I am not a big lager fan, but this is a great beer. I guess I had just never tried the right lager before. I will revisit this beer again very soon, especially with summer headed this way."
"expensive lager."
"Brown bottle."
"This brew was a sort of hazy color with a very small head, and thats with an aggressive pour. There wasn't any lacing either. There was a large amount of bubbles rising to the surface though. The aroma consisted sweet malts, a grassy aroma, and a sort of metallic aroma. I have no idea where the metallic smell came from? The aroma was complex, but not very good. The taste was not very good either. There was a malt taste up front followed by a grassy taste and it finished with a weird metallic flavor. Where is that coming from? Overall I was not impressed especially considering the brewery, however I don't care for many lagers."
"Its great to see such a renowned ale producer like Samual Smiths produce such a top notch lager.Poured great with nice golden color,with freash aroma of bread and even a little minerally?The hop presence really comes through on this but there is a malty backbone.Very easy to drink,very high quality will again for sure."
"The beer poured clear and gold with a nice, thick white head. The head receded fairly quick and left little lace work on the glass. It had a sweet malt smell and the taste, like the smell, was sweet and crisp, and had a slight spicy bite. It had a nice full mouth feel and was of medium carbonation. This was a good beer that I felt sad to see finished."
"Absolutely clear and golden, light carbonation, fully diminishing head. Fresh aroma of buttered bread (dinner rolls) and honey. Lots of soft pale malt, and lightly bitter. This is a very tasty lager. Why is Samuel Smith's so great in ALL their brewing efforts???"
"Light, slightly sweet malt aroma with aspects of honey, and just a hint of sourness. Medium and mildly steady white head. Gold and slightly cloudy with slight lacing. Mildly rich, with a largely pale malt lager flavor which is consistent throughout the drink, yet finishes with a mild bitterness with some lingering. Medium to light mouthfeel, that has adequate crispness, thus some thirst quenching qualities. Medium to fully carbonated. Decent English lager. Consistent flavor that could compliment food well."
"Taste is super smooth, sweet up front, more than a hint buttery richness. I can almost imagine dipping a corn cob into the glass. The taste though is smooth and very balanced. It has a great richness yet clean taste to it. Nice malty sweetness, and definite crispy saaz snap. No metallic or bitter harshness than is so evident in the big American lagers. Moderate carbonation, right on for the style. The creamy rich taste was really impressive, and made for a very very drinkable beer. I was more than surprised and will definitly reach for this again. I thought it just as good as a Victory Prima Pils. This would be a great summer cookout beer. Give it a try."
"Certainly the best Lager brewed in England, and maybe the UK, well with the possible exception of Cask-Conditioned Schiehallion Lager from the Harviestoun Brewery, Scotland."
"Cheers"
"Pours a clear Golden color toped off with a white head, which quickly faded to a small white collar. I like a bit more of a lingering lace with my beers. It could have been my glass. Another reason to drink this Larger again. Nice aroma, not over powering, a bit sweet maybe citrus tones involved, some malt and a touch of hops. Very nice flavor, a fine balance of the malt at the top and finishing with a touch of hops at the end giving it a pleasant aftertaste. A very nice Larger. Is good alone or with food."
"-Oelergud"
"An excellent lager, from the presentation down to the last drop. This is what Canadian Macros could be with a little effort."
"Its clear, deep golden body is topped by a short and foamy bright white head that drops shortly to just a creamy collar. A softly sweet malt greets the nose along with some mild grassy/herbal hops. The body is medium/light with a very fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly zesty on the tongue. The flavor mimics the aroma with a straight-forward malt that has some grassy/herbal hops flavors tightly woven throughout. It finishes dryish with a lingering earthy/mineral maltiness and some very light hoppiness. A well-balanced and enjoyable lager, but probably not worth it's elevated price as there are many better lagers available for less."
"Pleasing opalescent straw color on the pour, brilliant purposeful head, and the lace thick sheets to coat the glass. Clean and crisp nose, dominated by the malt, with hints of citrus, quite nice actually. Front is sweet malt; top is slim, with a nice hop spicy bite, portly carbonation and a very dry aftertaste that is quite long lasting. Still one of the better ""Lagers"" brewed anywhere, and that tells a lot as we all know, its not a favorite style with me."
"Brown bottle."
"Sam Smith’s Lager: Eh, its an euro lager, well made with taste, but you can find a lot of beers just like this, and as good, from Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Anyhow, it looks like a euro pilsner, and its pretty good, but I had as good for half the price. If its British, it had better be an ale is my new motto."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with aromas of malt and hops and reminds me of fresh hay.  It tastes just like it smells and has a somewhat dry refreshing, slightly bitter quality.  A smooth beer that goes down very easily.  If not for the price, I would make this a regular in my beer drinking rotation."
"This one from Sammy Smith is pretty decent. It pours a golden straw color with some foam that thins out after a while. It has nice lightly hoppy smell. The taste is great, very smooth but not watery. It goes down pretty well. I like this beer but it is a little bit too much for my pocketbook."
"This beer poured a straw color and formed a nice airy white head that left some nice lace.  The aroma was of hops and malt.  The flavor was also of hops and malt, with a slight sweetness of citrus with a bit of a doughy finish to it.  Not a bad lager from Old Tadacaster crew."
"This was a very tasty, well-crafted lager. It poured a pale-golden color with a small head that held up decently, leaving some decent lace. The mouthfeel was very smooth and I noted some zest in the nose. This lager is quite pricy, though, and although I enjoyed it, I probably won't be drinking it too often."
"Notes: This is a good classic lager from a legendary brewery ... though there are lots of other lagers that are comparable at a cheaper price. Top notch of an English Lager ... give it a try."
"Golden color with moderate creamy head that dissipated quickly.  No carbonation to speak of and there was a faint sweet aroma.  The beer had a mild hoppy taste and the lack of carbonation gave it an average mouthfeel. A mild beer overall but not worth three times the price of most macros."
"the organic was a little better, cleaner and a hint smoother, but this was clean smooth, and marvelous. samuel smith's brews are made for the top shelf. they are wonderful"
"Decent British Lager, pale straw with a nice malty taste. Obvious choice over domestic macros when in the lager mood. Probably not as good as some domestic micro lagers but I find myself choosing it over said beers.  Good drinkable beer."
"Clear golden hue.  The head settles unfortunately quickly & doesn't leave any lace.  The earthy and grassy Hersbrucker hop nose is accompanied by a touch of toasty Munich malt.  Lightly bodied, w/ a soft and a bit understated malt flavor, but the mild hop bitterness provides sufficient balance.  This is a lot like Sam Smith's organic lager in aroma and flavor.  If I did a side by side comparison any differences would be more noticeable. This is a no frills, drinkable, and relatively flavorful lager."
"I cant wait to taste the Samuel Smith Porter!"
"This always seems more ale-like than lager-like.  Pretty substantial body with a distinct, malty molasses/caramel flavor."
