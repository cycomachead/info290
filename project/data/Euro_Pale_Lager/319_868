Not the most attractive thing, but beer nonetheless. The aroma has a strong bread character--very doughy--coming from it's pale malt. This theme continues on the palate and is joined by a hint of sulfur and metallic. A carbonated finish is tinged with the slightest bitterness. This beer exceeded expectations, which were not very high to begin with.","BeardedBoffin","Apr 02, 2014"

3.03,-4.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Clear and pale yellow with a white, finger-high cap that dissipated over a few minutes leaving behind a thin skim of bubbles coating the surface.

Clean, mild flavour with some dry malts up front, low bitterness, floral and grassy, and a hint of spicy hops in the finish. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, fair texture. A passable euro lager, but ultimately forgettable.","DrJay","Jul 31, 2011"

1.82,-42.6,4,2,1.5,2,1.5,"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a faint skunkiness, sweet malt and kind of standard lager like smells. In the taste, a small dryness, a light malt, and actually no real taste at all. A smooth, and light and watery mouthfeel , with a small dry malt in the aftertaste. Thin, no real taste and lack there of aroma.","OWSLEY069","Oct 27, 2010"
3.97,25.2,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Taste is nice, full grain, plenty of tingly, almost minty herbal hop bitterness, a light mineral quaility. It leans slightly to a leaner, less malty, hoppier and more bitter side so it's more like a very good, if not great, German Pilsner in taste and feel, rather than a helles or Czech Pilsner. I would say that this is really a German Pilsner, but it falls well under the ""Europ Pale Lager"" category, too, being a bit simpler and with a thinness and faint roughness to the character. However, although not among the best German pilsners, it is far better than many other German Pilsners I've had and is very good.","Offa","Sep 23, 2010"
3.32,4.7,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As far as Euro ""umlaut"" lager is concerned, this one ain't bad.

Still, a highly drinkable lager, and a decent summer brew.","JohnnyBarman","May 25, 2010"
2.35,-25.9,2.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Picked up a 500 ml can, proclaims to be Austria's finest beer, let's give it a whirl. From the first smell this must be an adjunct. This brew smells like corn and more corn. Checking the label it says ""kornmalt"" which appears to be in line with my assumptions. The beer pours to a bright yellow with a thin head that dissipates quickly. The taste is well, corny. Tastes kind of like a corn mash that got fermented way short of moonshine. Very similar taste to ""chicha"" a fermented corn beverage sold in the Colombian countryside. Taste aside from corny is sweet and dry no real bitterness to speak of, consistent throughout. For fermented corn its not bad, for beer its not to good. Well if this is ""Austria's finest beer"" I won't be seeking out any more brew from Austria.","mooseisloose","Apr 21, 2010"

3.53,11.4,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"D- I like this beer...it isn't the most refreshing beer out there, due to a thicker body than what is typical and is a flavorful beer overall. The alcohol is well hidden.

The beer smells slightly skunky, but has a good taste. The mouthfeel is nice, a nice amount of carbonation. The drinkability is very high for this beer. It is easy to drink and doesn't really have much of an aftertaste. If you're looking for a decent light lager then give Gösser a try.","Cubsfan1087","Feb 14, 2010"

Aroma of slightly skunked adjunct malt is evident as soon as the cap is popped - light notes of moderately bitter pops and pilsner malt, but mainly skunk. Palate is a balance between mildly sweet adjunct malt and some slightly skunked hops. Mouthfeel is typical of a Euro lager - light and a touch creamy. I suppose I could put a few of these back, but it's not exactly a memorable experience.","ElGordo","Jun 30, 2007"

The smell is faint and grainy, has that Euro green bottle skunk smell. The taste is of light grassy noble hops, grainy malt, and a metallic skunk taste. The feel is watery and dull, doesn't really have that crisp taste of a lager. A typical Euro lager sample probably a notch above the mainstream Euro lagers. Easy drinking, good for summer weather.","Gmann","Jun 29, 2007"
3.35,5.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Quite surprised by this Austrian Export. Poured a bright pale yellow, with a very slight haze. The head was tight and compact lasting well over 5 minutes. A sharp aroma of noble hops with perhaps a faint smell of malt in the nose. The lager was fairly well balanced, a bit sweet in the middle, with a nice dry hoppiness in the finish. While not a great lager, it does tower of most massed produced Euro-Lagers. Closer to a North German Pils than a Dortmunder Export.","jpkoch1962","Apr 09, 2007"

There is also nothing with the aftertaste to be desired. This beer would be great if youre looking to down many of them, but as far as a craft brew goes it falls well below par.","Toddv29424","Nov 24, 2006"

At first, it smells like a Heineken, but that hoppy note fades over time, and a slight palte malt aroma comes out. On the palate, slightly creamy malts, grainy at the mid-palate, finishes dry. There's not much there, but nothing offensive either. Mouthfeel is thin, a bit watery, without any brisk carbonation. Overall, there's not a helluva a lot to like here, but compared to other lagers of this type, there's very little to dislike. I'd take this over a Heineken or Stella any day.","geexploitation","Oct 30, 2006"
3.48,9.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I've had a hard time categorizing the Austrian beers because they're less hoppy than their German or Czech cousins. Pretty balanced light beer.","3frog","Oct 20, 2006"
3.53,11.4,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Will lose the battle to an average Czech or Bavarian lager, but clearly a winner over other Austrian pale beers.","ernie","Jun 27, 2006"
3.45,8.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"First taste is quite hoppy and earthy, very pleasant and refreshing. Grassy hops move on to reveal a quite pleasant and mellow sweet malt presence. This is a much more hoppy beer than I expected though, closer to a Pils than a Euro Pale... A bit thin in the mouth but goes down very dry and quaffs well. Quite a refreshing beer, extremely enjoyable, but possibly mis-categorized.","trevorwideman","Apr 12, 2006"
3.93,24,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5," D: drinkability is really high. You could take a few of these down in the summer no doubt.","pjwilson","Dec 27, 2005"
2.63,-17,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Overall: Soft, inoffensive and a low key Euro lager. Just, well..boring really.","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 25, 2005"
3.61,13.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"500ml can purchased from LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Reviewed while the beer was freshly purchased, and fresh period. Medium gold pour and a full white head with full fizziness. Just right for style. Sweet malty nose, more malty than most. Flavor is grainy and grassy in the forefront then is folowed up with the sweetness of the malt. Aftertaste is long and dry, dry enough for another.","jimbotrost","May 31, 2005"
3.45,8.8,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Good stiff foamy head with an aggressive pour, clear straw yellow, nice puff of hoppy/skunky nose which was quite enjoyable, taste that followed was a more subtle version of the smell, could have used more oomph, mouthfeel was very smooth, a very gulpable beer that takes it's place among other solid Euro lagers, but does not stand out.","surfmeister","Apr 07, 2005"
3.73,17.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Yellow under puffy spume radiates roasted oat marshmallow treats. Creamy clean attack dries quick leaving a mild tin residue around the back of the tongue. Whirls of soft sulfur accompany these other things. Gösser is not sweet or hoppy enough for most people to enjoy but will wash down a mouthful of sushi like a champion.","inebrius","Mar 15, 2005"
3.32,4.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"1/2 liter can poured a golden-straw colored lager with a decent fluffy cap. Good lacing and the cap has fair retention. Medium effervescence. A pungent aroma of bread dough with grassy-mown hay hop tones ( very promising). Mouth feel a tad thin... malt backbone ( sweet doughy) does not stand out against the hops ( far too pronounced for a helles) which add a lemon twang to the clean finish. Not a bad beer but not enough malt pronouncement for a Helles and a tad much for a pilsner... Is this a pilsner trying to be a Dortmunder or a Helles trying to be a Pilsner? ...this beer has an identity crisis....not bad though.","pootz","Feb 27, 2005"
3,-5.4,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Looks to be, at first glance, another one trick pony of a euro lager, and was I right. Pale straw color, bubbly white head. Smells predictably of grassy malt and nothing more, no hops, no nothing. More of a malt backbone than other euros, but still a predictably boring, hopelessly hopless beer.","TastyTaste","Dec 25, 2004"
3.63,14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It pours a clear straw golden color with a decent white head that doesn't last too long, yet leaves some lacing, light grainy and flowery aromas. Bready and grainy flavors, light to medium bodied, nice crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean with some sweetness, I am very impressed with this above average lager.","maxpower","Dec 18, 2003"
3.59,13.2,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"The mouthfeel is full but finishes very crisp, very quenching. This is great stuff, I think I found a new favorite pils. It would definitely make a great session lager. A fine example of the style, and it's quite a looker too.","IronDjinn","Dec 18, 2003"
2.52,-20.5,2,2.5,2.5,2,3,"When poured into my glass, the head was very small sized, white and it contained fine-sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was clear and there was very little carbonation present.The hue was yellow and there was no lacing.The nose was malty and the flavor was bitter, hoppy, tangy and it had an aftertaste that lingered.The mouthfeel was tingly and light-medium bodied.I was not real impressed with this beer.","hotstuff","Aug 16, 2003"
2.98,-6,3,2.5,3,4,3,"Light gold color, cloudy, medium head. Aroma is grainy, fruity and sweet. A light bodied wheat beer. Milder malts, slightly sweet and somewhat fruity. Some banana and clove flavor. Mild taste. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftetaste is neutral.","beerguy101","Aug 11, 2003"
2.93,-7.6,3,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Clear and pale yellow color, decent 1/2 inch head of foam. Partial comma-like lacing in a standard pint glass. Acidic aroma, slight sufur skunk, and a sense of hops somewhat like milkweed. Light body, a bit too overcarbonated for my tastes. Malts are straightforward, slight skunk and a tea-like hop impression balance adequately and dry the finish somewhat. Not awful or great, could be an OK session brew...","ADR","Jul 06, 2003"
2.55,-19.6,2,2,3,2.5,2.5,"Bought and drank this one in San Marino. Clear, straw golden with a sea foam white head atop medium-large bubbles with poor retention and no lacing. Aroma is lightly of apples, yeast, and weak hops. Mouthfeel is fizzy with a thin watery body. Medium-high carbonation. Taste is weak, watery with a sweet corn tang halfway through. The finish has a plain bitterness with a moderately dry finish. Alcohol is barely perceptable. Plain through and through...nothing to ring home about.","Mitchster","Jun 12, 2003"

3.7,16.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Color is a clear gold bordering on being pale, with a strong foamy white head thats about two fingers high with some divets and leaves patchy lace. Smell is faintly soft with a acidy tang of lemon-lime-like bittersweet hop. Taste is pretty intesting, its smooth, crisp, and clean with the hop standing out as a unusual lime peel, very bitter tang twing to it thats not strong but its there. Not like a belgian wit or hefe-weisen strength in taste. It remined me of a mild IPA with a bit more thinned out malt and hop. Its not bad, its more of a solid pilsner feel and taste, but as a pale lager its a bit short.","tavernjef","Apr 10, 2003"
3.18,0.3,4,3.5,3,3,3,"It looks nice but the taste and the smell are undesireable. Straw color with little body and a bitter aftertaste. Not a good Austrian beer, a weak lager and not a great representation of Austrian brewing. It is good on a hot day when it is served very cold, but for the price should be avoided and a wheat or abbey tripel could be more enticing.","bierman2000","Mar 13, 2003"
3.45,8.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Gösser is the only Austrian beer I have found to date, so what beer style should it taste like? This mild Lager is straw/gold in color and very clear. There's an herbal quality to the light/medium malt. The hop bitterness is unique in that they possess a pectin and lime-like flavor. Smooth and velvety. Clean and refreshing and a low amount of aftertaste. Good summer brew for the sausage cookout.","BeerResearcher","Mar 13, 2003"
3.88,22.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pretty much all I can ask for in a beer.","SaunaKing","Feb 15, 2003"
4.02,26.8,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"--I enjoyed this beer. It was nothing spectacular but I could sit in a pub, preferably in Austria, and drink this all night. A great beer for hanging out, and having a few.","canadianbarman","Feb 13, 2003"
3.12,-1.6,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Clear bright yellow hue, small, but well-retained head. Sweetly aromatic from afar: a little floral, dry hops, on the pilsener side, with a touch more sweetness. I was a bit put off by an initial resemblance in the aroma to typical American lagers, but that soon passed. Decent, but short finish. Clean and smooth, but woefully short on flavor of any kind. Pretty much lock-in-step with any old lager. Light body, minimal texture, nothing terrible here, but absolutely nothing to remember it by, either.","feloniousmonk","Jan 22, 2003"
3.26,2.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours very clean with a decent white head. Good hoppiness. Very crisp and clean tasting. Tends to be a little skunky. Light in body, but big in flavor. Goes down smooth and lingers with a spritzy lemon-like taste. Overall, I recommend this beer. Serve at a medium temperature. A good summer beer to drink outside.","Rifrafboy","Dec 29, 2002"
1.6,-49.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,"Pretty thin and horrible, too fizzy aswell. Yellow appearance, with fizzy mineral water head, no aroma, and pretty close to noe flavour, perhaps a bit of malt in there, but too bland in my books.","rastaman","Aug 18, 2002"
3.7,16.7,3,3,4,4,4,"Gosser: This is an Austrian import that seems very popular in my area, and is virtually always on sale.  It is sold in green bottles, and has a similar aroma to other Euro-lagers, with that faint skunk aroma. However, the taste is much lighter and refreshing than a Heineken, for example, and went down very, very well.  This is a smooth beer that is worth a look.","jackndan","Jul 03, 2002"
3.8,19.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Notes: Found this at the bottom of the shelves at my local ghetto package store. Came in a 12-pack box. To my surprise Gösser turned out to be a very nice alternative (to the US norm) lager. Very enjoyable and flavourful. Great all around knock-em-back beer.","Todd","Jun 16, 2001"
