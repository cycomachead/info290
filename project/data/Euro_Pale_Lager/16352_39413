4.13,18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.25,"I began by demonstrating the Crack! and inverted Glug, producing a finger of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a gorgeous golden-yellow (SRM = 7) with button-brightness and I was shocked to see Croesus, Midas and Mammon appear, but it was just that golden. Usually, they CANfine themselves to my kitchen. Nose had a clean maltiness, not fouled by unwanted adjuncts, along with a light grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was soft and the interplay between the malt and hops was just what I am looking for in a lager. Nothing pretentious or over the top, just a nice, clean beer. Finish was semi-dry with the grassiness coming to the front. I was glad to have tried it, even in a field setting, and I would have it again if the situation called for a CANned lager.","woodychandler","Dec 07, 2013"

3.2,-8.6,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Courtesy of Strykzone. Pours a metallic gold with an off white head that hung in there well and left good lacing. Nose of caramel malts and some floral hops. Body light to medium and palate is clean and crisp. The flavor is well balanced between the malts and hops. Well made lager can be very nice to drink. This is a nice one.","rkuhnel","Feb 16, 2011"

3.12,-10.9,4,2,3,4,4,"12 oz. bottle with clearly marked freshness date. Brewed to 13P, hopped to 22 IBUs and lagered six weeks at the brewery. Nice clarity on the pour yields an amber hue reminiscent of a marzen, with moderate carbonation and an inch of frothy head that leaves some wisps of lace. A bit fruity in the nose, vegetal, with perhaps some caramel and hops. Tastes toasty (Munich or Vienna malt?), with a light fruitiness, and some green hops that impart a mild bitterness on top of a light and dry body. Not too bad; could be a bit more fresh (was in the back of the fridge), but reminiscent of a Vienna lager. Worth a try when down in Virginia.","mmmbeer","0"

3.56,1.7,4,3,3.5,4,4,"They tried way too hard to come up with that name. It pours a clear pale straw topped by about a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat and some light citrus hops. The taste holds notes of light wheat, greens, and a vague floral bitterness. The body is light, with a lightish carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a decent pale lager, but nothing special.","TMoney2591","Jun 21, 2010"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a solid local offering. This is my local Go-To Beer. Pours a Clean straw color with a great two finger white head. smells of roasted grain and fresh hops. Tase it great. Again, it's grainy, mild bitterness due to hops, hops lend a faint piny note balanced malts. It's not overly complex, but solid enough to return to over and over. If you ""just want a beer"" this is your ticket. This is one local brewery that i speak highly of often.","PreacherBrewer","Feb 21, 2010"

3.57,2,5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Tastes creamy smoothness and modest hop bitter. Nice hop flavor is earthy and turns tin-like in the aftertaste. Grain flavor is beneath the hops as biscuit or light toast. Hint of an off flavor, either sulfur or DMS. Moderate, but fine stingy carbonation helps clean the creamy mouthfeel off the tongue.","mentor","Jun 05, 2009"

4.33,23.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The flavor is of sweet malt, a little graininess and the distinctive profile of noble hops. There is a hint of bitterness in the finish, but it is very slight. The noble hop flavor, however, lingers several minutes beyond the swallow. The first few sips reveal a slight fruitiness, but the firm maltiness and noble hop flavor soon overpower the fruitiness. This is an excellent lager, reminiscent of a fine Munich Helles.","biglickbrewer","0"
