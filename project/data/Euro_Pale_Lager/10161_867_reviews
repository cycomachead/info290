"Easy and refreshing, better than Peroni in my opinion."
"Just another run of the mill pale lager.....drinkable, taste ok but for me .....yawn...."
"A crisp pale lager, that has a crisp clean and refreshing taste. Smooth, a touch of hop herbal in the finish , no real bitterness."

"Light flavored , alright tasting, colors light/budlight"

"good when its very cold. as it warms up, it starts to taste bad, just like your average lager."

"Here is a lager that kind of surprised me. The golden color is nice, the taste is a little on the bitter side for me, which is why I gave it a lower score.  Worth the try in my opinion."

"Yeasty and overly carbonated.  Way too watery as well."

"Tastes just like miller lite"
"Overall: for me, this was a bit of a diamond in the rough. I had 'Euro Pale' lager night, which I was not looking forward to since it is really not my favourite style. After a bunch of average beers and a bunch of awful beers, this one actually comes across quite refreshing with a subtle and quality flavour profile. Impressive for AU$42 a case. I'll have it again."

"This beer is easy to drink, a balanced and smooth taste that goes down well. Moretti is a good lager that goes especially well with Italian food (naturally!)."
""

"Birra Moretti brewed by Birra Moretti (Heineken), with an ABV of 4.60%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head.  Birra Moretti is an filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell nice with grains and malts.  You also pick up on some sweetness in the smell of this brew.  Now for the taste, it is rich with with malts and a mild sweetness.  This brew has a nice balance it it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel is is nice and clean. This brew is also relishing, Birra Moretti  did a nice job with this one. Over all I'm giving Birra Moretti  a 4.75 out of 5. I would buy this brew again."
"I only drink it cause its made in Italy, which doesn't mean high quality, just that its my heritage.  otherwise it would be just a light lager with limited complexity.  Cold is best."

"Just like Italy's other big beermaker Peroni, this product is merely ok.  If you go to Italy, don't bother drinking beer.  Have wine instead."

"Overall- This is just okay for me, Italian beers don't get a lot of love, pretty much for a good reason."

"Great tasting Euro pils. Medium bodied, tons of biscuity malt flavor, followed by a refreshing hop bitterness. Really hard to beat IMO. Kicks all others in the heinie. The most desired beer in Italy."

"Overall – There is nothing really wrong with this but nothing really good about it either. It is just dull, having said that if you drink it with an Italian meal it does have a better flavour following the meal but not nearly enough to make it interesting. So my advice is either drink this as your accompaniment to an Italian meal or treat it like a Miller, chill it to near zero and drink it quick so you don’t notice the lack of flavour. I also tend to feel that this last point makes this a worrying beer! What I mean by that is best explained by this… imagine if a bunch of rowdy teens get their hands on this. At 4.6% they would be pissed pretty quickly and would just keep on drinking as there is so little flavour it would taste like water even to them."

"Tasty, strong for ABV, nice bite/kick. Does the job. An enjoyable evening lager"

"A good lager.  Since Moretti is part of Heineken, I was expecting some skunk.  This lager, however, was free of any sulfur taste and was very crisp and clean, actually quite enjoyable."

"This beer is a Munich Helles style. Clean, rich, malty. Pours perfectly golden clear and maintains a slight head for the duration. Malty nose and slight sweetness comes through. Not for the hop-a-holics....who knew that the Italians could brew such a clean Bavarian brew? Despite the poor ratings and reviews, I think this a solid drinker"

"Wow, a whole 330-ml.! I'll be done before I really get started. I got started with my usual heavy-handed pour, resulting in a pseudo-cascade, and producing just under three fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with good retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. For the second time today, I feel like I have passed urine that was darker than the beer in my glass. Nose had a grassy, Saaz hops-like aroma. No adjuncts, anyway. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Taste was mildly grassy with a biscuit malt backbone. Not bad, especially for the price point. Finish was semi-dry, rather unobtrusive and fairly pleasant in total."

"Very ""skunky"" aroma but pleasant to drink. It has a very refreshing taste. Think Heineken but a little stronger. Nice clear golden color with a frothy head. Aftertaste is a little dry. Low carbonation. All in all, it's a beer that you could definitely sit down and watch a game with. Although, nothing to write home about. It's cheap and easy."

"Bottle poured into a pint glass at pizzeria in Calgary. A light golden amber brew with maybe a half-inch of large white bubbles, a shade darker than many other Euro pales and featuring less doughy sweetness as well. Smells like grain husks and faint grassy hops, less doughy and more malty than its sweeter yet crisper and fruitier countryman Peroni. This one is dry as well but features a more rounded tannic maltiness somewhat like weakly steeped tea, vague lemon rind, some DMS but less than expected, dry stale popcorn, and a metallic tingle in the dry grassy finish. Thin and super fizzy but maybe just a hair thicker than something like Heineken. I did note that the spicy sauce on my pizza brought out some added dry grape and pale malt character. Good example of a food pairing that raises up the beer half of the partnership."

"I am surprised at the head retention. The color is alright. Very light and can almost see exactly what's behind it. So almost translusant. The he's only poured to about a quarter of an inch. But stayed that way all throughout the drinking. You can't see through the head and it's almost silky. This is probably the only thing that makes this beer ""different"" from other. The taste is okay nothing to really discribe. Hoppy at the end. More refreshing than anything. Overall, an okay beer"

"A respectable lager, light and delicate overall. The appearance is its high point. The flavor is fairly nondescript and doesn't stand out in any way. Easy drinking and does wet one's whistle..."

"Overall: A very poor Euro Pale Lager. Has none of the malty sweetish note expected of this style. Taste like a poorly brewed domestic beer."

"Taste: It is light and creamy like a cream ale style with a cereal grain flavor and a honey after taste. There is very little hoppiness with a hint of grassy and citrus notes. This can be a decent session lager."

"Pours to a thin, white head that falls to thin ring with little retention. Color is pale gold. Aroma is spicy hops and sweet grains, pleasant and balanced--doesn't smell cheap or skunky. Good hop flavor that has a spiciness suggesting regional hops of the Saaz variety. Finishes dry and crisp. Mouthfeel is light and clean, moderate CO2. The only beer I will drink with certain Italian dishes. It has a light, delicate flavor that works in places where a white wine would normally go in food pairings."

"The perceived quality of a beer needs to be considered in the context of what it is intended to deliver. Moretti is not trying to be an English Ale or an American West Coast IPA. Moretti is light in color, mouth feel, and flavor with a bit of a German lager and hoppy goodness on swallow. Fairly low IPA, too. But don't compare it to the best of other styles. Moretti is a good lager that goes especially well with Italian food. Don't believe me? Try it with a plate of lasagna and salad or a thin crust pizza - no other beer is a better food pairing."

"O: Unimaginative. Bland. Run of the mill. Dead. You be the judge. I would even go for a Miller Light before this. Very surprised that an import of this cost could be so depressing on the palate."
"Final Grade: 3.42, a respectable B-. I had low expectations coming into this review, but Birra Moretti is actually a fine lager - a damn fine one, in my humble opinion, and a surprisingly solid choice for my 450th review. Normally these Euro lagers are a one-and-done for me, but this is one I could actually see myself purchasing again, and I'd certainly pick it over Peroni or 90% of the other imported lagers that crowd the shelves around here. A justifiable option at its LCBO price point - if you're a lager fan looking for something simple to quaff on a hot day, give this one a shot."

"To the Point: a good lager, as far as, lagers go; 12 bucks for a six pack – I know I can find a better beer for this kind of money and not be stuck with some typical lager beer. Factoring in the price I'll have to give it an okay -"

"O: Typical Euro Lager."
""
""

"Decent for an adjunct lager, good choice of hops with a fair quantity for the style. But it has a low cost benefit in Brazil, should cost less than a Heineken which has a superior taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste of light cereal malt, thin bodied with a light flavor and a corn flake-cereal finish. Utterly forgettable and just as bland from the source (Italy) as imported."
"O: This beer is easy to drink. Although it's not very interesting, the taste is rather good when compared to other beers in the style. It would have been a lot nicer if it didn't have the skunky aromas and flavors."

"Gotta love watching Peter O'Toole as Pope Paul III whilst drinking this seemingly Italian beer... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises funky corn, funky wheat, light flowers, and a light layer of dust. The taste brings in more of the same, along with an unfortunate extra bit of dust and dirt. Hm. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet, fluid feel. Overall, this is a pretty weak bit of beer, something I'd hope the burgeoning Italian scene is quick to rebuke."

"I can not wait to head back to Disney in June and eat the great Pizza at Via Napoli and drink several Moretti beers, Next time I head to the beer store I will be picking up some bottles of these, as I just found out they are in stock!"

"I haven't been missing out on this beer before now."
"one of the more available Italian beers, this one is pretty much the pale euro standard, nothing special. it pours a really faded straw looking color with a rapidly rising white head, aided by the pilsner glass im using here. the color is really pale, too light, even for the style, it lets me know not to expect too much taste here. the nose also gives that indication, with just a crystal light malt grassy sort of nose, a little skunky, without any more than basic bittering hops in the finish. the flavor is identical to the nose. I mean, this is plenty drinkable, in fact its really easy down, but there just isn't much taste. not a lot of off flavors, as the skunk has subsided, but its a pretty watered down beer. still, there is something unique about moretti, I don't know if its the yeast or the grains or what, but I can always pick this beer out blind with other similar ones because it has a sort of burnt bread element that stands out. not much else going on. the feel isn't bad, just really light and lacking on alcohol. as such it would be a good all day drinker. the carbonation is also really bright, which makes it good with some heavier foods like pasta and chicken marsala. overall its better than peroni, but a far cry from europe's best."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours pale straw with short-lived, fluffy, white head and lively carbonation. Nose is of hay and grain. Body is light and crisp. Taste is some grassy hops and sweet malt. Finish is short and light. I could finish this standard macro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Going by a review I did of this back in 84, gave it 3 mugs on a six mug scale. Color was a nice golden straw with a clear hue. Head was full and lasting and the flavor was yeasty and grainy. Aroma was also grainy or bready. Aftertaste was mild and clean."
""
""
"Better than most examples of the style - fairly bland, but drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thinner body, but amply carbonated. Decent crisp refreshing feel. Simple flavors white bread, lemon, a bit of lime, simple grains. This was decently refreshing and went quite well with my pizza. Nothing I'd go out of my way to get, but nothing I'd turn down either."
""
"Overall, this beer is pleasing yellow color and white lace with a satisfyingly failure smell and taste similar to that of Heineken in my younger years. In short, it’s an average strong hoppy bitterness that stands out the most, yet strangely works well with pizza."

""
""

"-Overall 3.0: Standard -and slightly below, in some aspects-- Euro-lager. This would be a good beer with food and is completely sessionable, but is just kind of...blah. I checked the price on a six pack of this and it was -are you sitting down?-- $9.00 in the ATL area. Just craziness. you could get a 12 pack of Labatt's for that at some places. OK beer, but just not worth the price here in the USA. If I'm ever in Italy, however... . ;)"

"Slightly more taste than its ABV would suggest, but this beer is the very definition of mediocrity. It could be worse I guess."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight citrus hops, slight bread, hint of sulfur, and a hint of nut. Fits the style of a Euro Pale Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of citrus hops, and adjunct. Overall, decent aroma, appearance, but weak body."
""
""
"Overall – Ah… Nothing I would really want to drink again and nothing I would recommend."
""
""
""
""

"330 mL bottle Light clean grassy aroma backed by hop. Clear brassy color with a vigorous white head. Starts with light malt sweetness, a bit of carbonation bite, and the finish is rather dry and a bit bitter. Something of a light pilsner. Not a bad drink, just not very flavorful."

"O – This beer is pretty good and actually exceeded my expectations. As far as macro lagers go, it looks pretty good as it actually has some lacing and there’s some semblance of more than adjuncts in the smell, flavor, and mouthfeel. Definitely a decent beer for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not bad for what it is, the malt character is a bit better than average for and international industrial lager and there is an herbal hop flavor that gives it a hint of pilsner character in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Comes to the table a solid golden color with a decent sized white head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of floral hops and bready malt with a hint of honey. The flavor follows the aroma light bready and floral with a mild grain sweetness. Light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Decent light lager, nothing special, but better than the other choices on the menu."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad for what it is, but man oh man give me an IPA or a brown ale any day of the week..."
""
""
""
"O: A mild version of a Heineken. Not a beer that I will drink again"
""
""
"O - it's ok, I'd have more with pizza."
"I hate how it came out smelling slightly skunky, but then so did the Weihenstephaner Original. Bright yellow body with a white head. The smell is mainly sweet toasted corn, as is the taste. its a very simple Euro Pale Lager, with no frills. Finishes clean."
"Overall, what can i say? It's a non-skunked Euro lager. Drinkable, but NOT WORTH THE PRICE."

"It tastes okay. The grain is forceful but not in a bad way. Light malt sweetness and a light hop bitterness round it out and I find it easy to drink. I bought this bottle in a mixed 6er; that's the only way I'd buy it if I wanted more."
"Overall: Good beer. I have had this one a few times now amd always enjoy it."

""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the drinkability. There is nothing really offensive about this beer, and for the style, it is an easy drinking, rather refreshing brew. The flavoring throughout, however, is pretty mild, making the drinker wish for something a little more robust."
""
""
""
"O: Not a beer I will be revisiting. Someone left a few in my house and I was just intrigued to try them. Slightly better flavor profile than standard BMC products, but only slightly. Incredibly light, the drinkability depends entirely on how much carbonation ends up in that glass."
""
""
""
""
"Although weak, there's an interesting flavor. I wouldn't turn one down but it's by no means a particularly good beer. It's too sweet and bland."

""
""
"O- I think I'll pass on another one of these."
"Moretti: At dinner, Maggiano’s Little Italy to be specific, so an Italian beer was a must. Came in a bottle, which is good because I have had some bad experiences with flat beer on tap lately. The Moretti has a very clear golden color in the glass with moderate carbonation. The head is thin and pure white with a subtle aroma of malt. The flavor is lightly sweet and malty with a faint finish of bitter. Very nice overall. I had a second. The Moretti reminded me of Heineken, and as I reviewed the label in more detail, there it was, “brewed by Heineken in xxx, Italy”. It’s different enough from Heineken, but there are similarities. Give this easy drinking beer a try. See what you think."
"O: This is far from horrible, but there's nothing that stands out. It's just an ok beer. On a hot day I wouldn't mind one or with food(if my choice was limited). The skunky aroma can be distracting. I don't see myself buying this again."
"I had this beer for the first time in years and by I was shocked at how it tasted. I use to love this beer, but the more mature your taste buds get, I guess you lose interest in beers like this. The appearance was average, with the yellow straw color. The smell was also average with a bit of malt and a tiny bit of hops. The taste was pretty watery with a tiny bit of earthy taste. The mouthfeel was pretty carbonated, not much else. Overall this is a very boring beer. I would never buy it again."
"A decent lager, very sessionable."
"Birra Moretti is a crystal clear, straw colored beer with a white head that vanishes instantly. It has a funky aroma with a note of grass. There a very slight, soft sweetness that kind of smells like cake. It's pretty light bodied, lively and smooth with a dry finish that leaves the mouth just a touch silty. It's lightly flavored and just a little funky. It tastes grainy and there's a little wooden bitterness at the finish. It's a bit like a Czech pilsner. It's not horrible and pretty refreshing."
"Moretti: Italian for ""shit."" Well not quite, but it is a pretty boring beer over all. Looks like your typical pale colored lager, yellow with a white head. A little better than Budweiser with less adjunk and a little hoppiness. A little metallic on the finish. As a guido I am a little disappointed in my country's beer offerings as of now, but I guess the wine is good."
"Had Moretti with my Pizza last night and it wasnt bad....and it wasnt great. Fairly solid Euro lager...much like all the rest. The appearance was golden clear and had decent carbonation, but no real head retention. The smell had some sweetness to it, lil malty, some grain....nothing out of the ordinary. The taste was solid, malt and grain start and clean pallet finish. Was very good with my pizza. The mouthfeel was easy and it certainly could be a session beer."
"Pours a clear lightish yellow with a 1 inch puffy white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace form along the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain and grass notes just like the average Euro pale lager. Taste is of grains, grass, and citrusy flavors. A mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good carbonation level makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with nothing bad but nothing great."
"Unfortunately, it looks better than it tastes. Which isn't to say it tastes bad or anything, just pretty average. It's creamy than many of its Euro Pale Lager brethren, but I can recall the flavor of Stella and Heineken better than this one (although Heinekens definitely don't taste as good). I wouldn't mind having one of these again, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to buy another."
"It is a very pale straw color with a soapy white head. The beer is very skunky with hints of apple, raisin and grass. The taste is kind of funky with grains, lemon and a slightly bitter finish. The beer is light with some prickly carbonation and a dry finish. This is just another average Euro lager."
"Lacks character but not bad, went rather well with a pizza in Stockholm."
"O: A pedestrian, non challenging, non threatening beer. This is great for the masses who would like a weaker tasting beverage. This beer would go acceptably well with most foods. I probably won't look for Moretti again, but if I was handed one, I wouldn't turn my nose up at it either."
"Overall- Try the beer once at least. Its refreshing on a hot day, if somewhat bland and lacking in a ""wow"" factor."
"From the 330 ml. bottle marked 9323390HL. Sampled on July 15, 2011. The pour is a typical pale lager straw yellow with a fizzy, bubbly head. There are pale malts in the aroma with a slight hoppiness. The taste has some malty character but it is overpowered by the bitterness which is kind of like chewing a pill. It is much like an American macro."
"O - this is ice cold and is going down easy probably because I am thirsty after a long day. I think I will order another."
"O: Could be okay if it wasn't so horrendously skunky."
"Taste is also very plain, bread ,grain and little bitterness at the end. Very plain mass production beer. Will not buy it again."
"This beer pours out of the bottle much like all the other Lagers out there, It's got that golden color body with the fizzy white head that evaporates quickly. The Smell is skunky, it kind of overpowers many if not all the other aromas in the brew. The taste is a little funky too, it's got some aspects of a lager hidden in the aftertaste. It's kinda dry and has a medium body to it. I wouldn't need to have this one again."
"We are in the register of aqueous strong lagers but we must highlight the ease to drink this potion. The nose is certainly absent, mouth very insipid and bitterness just limited to a simple aromatic hops unoriginal, but it's very simple to use and fairly refreshing. No big twist, just a simple beer but without big bad taste."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D: Flavour wise even in the Euro Pale category it's below average. In the end it's non-offensive, it does have some hop character to it, there a lot worse out there."
"Dr: Wouldn't have it again, especially at Irish prices."
"Next time I'm at Leo's I'll order iced tea."
"This is an ok brew. No flavors are potent. The most prominent flavor is grain, but it is not very strong."
"Pours a pale yellowish color with a mixed wheat and citrus scent. Has a grassy and grainy taste with a light hint of citrus to finish it off. Is rather smooth but a little weak and thin in it's texture. A decent find though."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavours and aromas."
"D - Well, its a step above your run of the mill macros. Just is one mediocre thing after another with this and somehow at 4.6 I can still taste alcohol."
"M: Goes down easily, not too filling, not very tasty, mild kick, and ok representation of style. Not a beer that I would sit with for an evening - nothing horribly wrong with this beer, but nothing exciting either."
"Felt easy in the mouth, but close to watery. On average it was average."
"Overall, this was about what I expected it to be, a basic Euro Pale Lager. I could see myself drinking this again at an Italian restaurant if there were no other options. If I ever make it to Italy I don't see myself wasting time with this beer."
"RJT"
"Drinkability - this was a good choice compared to coors light as i was out for dinner. Not something i would seek again."
"There are many other breweries in Italy that are up and comers and I'd focus on them before I'd go back to another Heineken clone."
"Straw colored and crystal clear. Lots of carbonation. Fair head retention with a bleached white head. Grainy aroma. Carbonation bite with medium light body. Unspectacular middle and end. Not much of interest here, drinks like a average/slightly below average light lager."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. Golden color and fizzy carbonation yielded very little head and minimal lacing. Smell was of corn and a tiny bit of skunk. Have had this at a local italian restaurant so I tend to like it. Mouthfeel was thin and drinkability was high due to the style. Pairs well with Italian food."
"Overall: Not as good as Peroni."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, about what you would expect out of the style, I've had worse but overall this is not a very good beer."
"Overall, wouldn't turn down, but definitely would ask if anything else available to weight the options..."
"D- average, but bitter. Refreshing but bland."
"D: Very average Euro Lager... Low ABV, pretty balanced and good with pizza. Nothing to run looking for but not bad."
"Overall, a very average experience. Color is a bit vibrant for a pale lager, but in the end it's just yellow. Head is formidable and dissipates slowly. Corny, wheaty, grainy flavor. Very bubbly with a crisp dry finish. OK all around, but uninspiring. Would drink it again if it's there, but wouldn't seek it out."
"A good thirst quenching lager but nothing special or unique. Pairs up well with food."
"You can definitely tell it is a Euro pale lager, that's for sure. The typical tastes are all there. For its style, it's just fine. Very drinkable and sessionable but not the best."
"Don't get it unless you have too."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice golden appearance with a great sustaining head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is pretty representative of the style. Flavor, the same. Nothing special, but tastes like a pale lager... malt and yeast. Overall, this is a pretty solid quaff."
"Clear thin pale yellow brew puts up 1"" of fizzy white head and a bunch of carbo clinging to the glass. Smell is mild and predictable, faint light malt sweetness, skunk and lemon hop. Taste is similar but just a little stronger on the hop and skunk. Feel is light with just enough carbonation to keep it crisp but little enough to keep it smooth and chuggable."
"D. OK if you have to. I had this on a train from Zurich to Milan, all things considered, not terrible. 2.5 "
"overall again not terrible, these are the ones i can throw down in a half a second."
"Ate dinner this past Saturday night with my wife at Delfino's Italian restaurant in Roslindale Village. Ordered a bottle of Moretti with my veal parmigiana. Poured into a semi-cold pint glass. Bright yellow colored body. Lots of carbonation. Whispy white head that faded quickly. Smell had some hints of corn, but not much else. Taste was average but not awful, so it was bearable. Just a bit of hops and malt noticed in the flavor. The standard Euro lager flavor. Mouthfeel was OK, as it was crisp, cold, and smooth. An easy beer to drink with Italian food as it doesn't do much to mask flavors in the meal, and does a decent job cleansing the palate. Moretti is a fun beer to have with some tasty Italian food, but not a beer to order at a beer bar."
"Drink - Definitely a light tasting beer, not something I would seek out again, but not something I would turn away if offered to me by a friend."
"Had this at an Italian restaurant and figured I'd order it because I've never had it before. Pours a pale yellow with thin head and no lacing. Not much in terms of smell or taste. It has very grainy malt and I don't really get much hops or bitterness. Very prickly carbonation makes this a bit hard to drink. I think I would have preferred the Canadian that my friend ordered."
"The pint arrived golden and clear with minimal head retention. The faint aroma was largely malt and a strange mineral odor. The flavor was fairly sweet and slightly medicinal with very little hop presence or malt backbone. Overall, it was refreshing if rather bland. The body was thin with a largely clean mouthfeel helped by noticeable carbonation. It was light and refreshing for the summer, but I did not ask for another."
"MF/D: a crisp, light beer. easily drinkable with dinner or as a session beer."
"Its just fine, nothing special, but easy drinker on a hot day outside at a pizza restaurant."
"Poured into a pint glass a pale lemon yellow with a small one finger head that disappears quickly. Carbonation continues to rise throughout though. Kind of a sweet-sour fruity smell, a subtle hint of grapes. Mild bitterness in taste and easy going down with very little kick. Pleasant and refreshing but nothing really special. It goes rather well with a heavy pasta dinner. I usually get a couple of these when I go to Carabba's."
"Well... Probably OK for a hot Italian afternoon."
"I can see why Italy is not so famous for beer, this one looks much better then it is"
"The body was fairly typical for the style, light and crisp. Drinkability was good, smooth and easy, and would go good on a hot afternoon. Overall, a decent example of the style. Worth a shot."
"very thin bitter taste, very light-bodied, refreshing, with no discernible end"
"There are, however, a good number of tiny, artisanal producers popping up around the country and, assuming you know where to find them, you're in for some real special (often eccentric) treats. It can be said with certainty that beer in Italy is finally starting to earn the same appreciation as wine, but as for Moretti doing anything to further that along, don't count on it. It's beers like this that are to blame for the bad rep in the first place."
"not a great deal to write home about. very sessionalable. However, when it comes to italian beer I will take 1 Panil to a case of these. Thanks Birra Moretti."
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours a clear light yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is very heavy on the corn. Smells like a macro lager. The flavor is a mix of corn with some earthy and spicy hops. Nothing in the beers flavor is any good. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a good beer."
"Crystal clear, straw yellow with a short, white cap of fine bubbles. Fair head retention with a bit of spotty lace. Aromas of grainy malt, lemon, faint spice, slightly metallic. Moderate bitterness up front, but faded towards the end. Malty sweetness throughout, lemony hops lingered in the finish, accompanied by faint hop spice. Light bodied, average carbonation, crisp and dry. Pretty solid overall, especially compared to a lot of other pale lagers I've had. I enjoyed this a lot more than the Peroni I had earlier in the afternoon."
"Overall I despised this beer when I was in Italy, besides the labeling which is kind of cool. Anyways, this is one of the grainiest beers I have ever had. There was nothing good about it and I found myself at times lusting for a Peroni, which I wouldn't even touch in the States. If you enjoy wine, stick to it when in Italy because I didn't have a good brew the whole time I was there."
"Overall I had zero expectations going in and they were met with flying colors. Epic fail."
"D - could easily drink enough of these to get alcohol poisoning."
"D - Eff that son. Poured. 1.0"
"Drinkability: I've had this beer in the past and it wasn't this bad. Perhaps this was an old sample or was abused in shipment or by the restaurant. Maybe I'll try it again to see for sure."
"Taste - light malt up front complimented by equally subtle hoppy finish. Smooth, crisp, and nothing in the way of adjuncts are noticeable. This isn't anything special, but it sure is tasty. Excellent session brew."
"Taste, not much. Barely a hop or malt presence. Kinda refreshing, like a water would be. Enjoy this more with spicy mexican than Italian food. I don't understand why this is all good in Europe, but then American crap is denigrated. Bad is bad. This isn't 'bad' but it gets close. I guess what pisses me off the most is how expensive this beer is. And for what? There's no mouthfeel, I really don't know what ingredients go into it, but it ain't much."
"Taste is light and malty with a very light hop finish. It's pretty bland and inoffensive though. It's god to drink with an italian meal though."
"This is a perfect champagne breakfast buffet beer. Loads of burp from a very clean, light golden fizz and a nice hopped edge on the aftertaste. What's NOT to like for this style? Certainly won't stand up to serious beer for beer competition BUT this is the type of refreshing hot summer beer that's best served very cold for thirst quenching. My wife was very happy when I introduced her to this beer. Like I say THIS is the BEST choice for a breakfast bar beer - nothing else."
"Pours as a very pale straw colour with loads of carbonation and a massive foamy white head. The aroma is very weak, what this is is grainy, with a hint of soap. Again the taste lack power. There is a slight bread malt, with a papery taste following, and that is pretty much it. Really not a great beer, if you see it don't bother."
"It is the typical golden straw color that this category seems to have. Though I had minimal foam with a good amount of carbonation. I would have friends who only drink macros give this a try. It would be a good step into something better."
"pretty drinkable"
"i didnt notice any sweetness come through at all. a beer this sour should be advertised as such."
"Overall, not a bad Italian beer. It's definitely nothing special, but better than any BMC offering I can think of."
"Decent as far as drinkability is concerned. Not bad overall but certainly not a must."
"Somewhat adjuncty smell reminds me a bit of Mexican lagers like Sol or Corona. Pours with very little fizzy head which recedes leaving no lace. Medium straw transparent yellow. More carbonation apparent on the tongue than in the glass. Not too much flavor beyond alcohol, grain, and fizz. There's really no there there. Easily drinkable, but why pay premium prices for a mediocre beer?"
"D: Yet another middle of the road EPL. A perfectly passable beer, but does nothing to justify its price premium over many other comparable beers. The low ABV makes this a quick drinker."
"Overall a sub average beer."
"D: Good to accompany spicy food."
"I had this on tap at a local restaraunt. It is a pale, clear yellow with an average head. The nose is biscuity, slightly sweet. The flavor is pretty typical for a euro lager sweet, and bready with enough hops for a bit of balance. The finish is crisp. The beer is light bodied, well carbonated and easy drinking. Even though it is not my favorite style, this one is not bad."
"Heineken owns this brewery and thats a pity because i am fond of this brewery and the way they take over the smaller breweries is a country."
"A bit grainy on the back end, but in my experiences with Italian beer over the years, I attribute the grainy minerality to the very calcic and mineral-rich water that adds an odd taste for many people who are unused to it."
"Overall an average beer.... Not much else to say."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, with a touch of hops. Taste is slightly sweet, malts with some hops. Feels medium bodied in mouth. This beer goes down very smooth. Overall this is a decent beer."
"Drinkability: Decent, if you like this kind of thing."
"The strap line is ""The Beer in Italy"". Maybe that's why they drink wine."
"Pours a pale, clear yellow with a minor amount of white head. The aroma isn't too stark in any direction--there's a little bit of malt and some European hops. Taste is similar; just a tad bit sweet. Mouthfeel is thin with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but a little too much carbonation and not enough flavor for me."
"D: Aargh. This is foul."
"D: Not recommended except in the most dire of circumstances. There is very little to suggest this beer. Flavorless and without character, it is the Italian MGD."
" Poured into my favourite tasting glass (a big old fashioned English Pub nonic) a pretty yellow or light gold and clear. It had a white lace that seemed to stick. It was a bit bitter - the hops methinks - but I kinda like that. Light smell of hops and such but the taste was kind. A bit of a fruity taste but not unpleasant - just not a real strong taste. If you offered it to me at a meal I would say fine. I regretted not trying it with a pasta or some such thing."
"Pours clear gold yellow color with a small white head, and smells of malt and a hint of yeast. Good, clean and crisp lager with a nice malty taste with a slight hint of roasted flavor and a touch of sweetness; zero lacing, medium to high carbonation and very enjoyable. This beer has been good over the years and always goes down smooth, almost water like. It is what it is, a Euro Pale Lager so expect medium flavor and high drink-ability."
"tastes alot like it smells. mouthfeel is typical for this type beer. very sessionable beer... if you like it..."
"Notes - I've had this beer before on draft and I thought better of it then."
"Drinkability - good marks on drinkability, well balanced, lightly hopped and at 4.6%abv almost a session beer."
"Full bodied."
"Notes: I would have been excited to have this ""Italian"" beer in Roma but it is brewed by Heinekin."
"d- i'm gonna go with an ok for drinkability, not the tastiest euro pale lager i've had, but it is drinkable, i'll drink again, but probably won't buy any more of this, i had higher hopes from my motherland."
"Drinkability- Pretty decent lager. Better than BMC, but nothing special."
"Cafe Mediterraneo, a very nice restaurant in Portsmouth, NH, has this on tap. Served in a pilsner glass, it is a clear golden color with a thick white head and some lacing. A nice-looking beer that doesn't live up to the promise of its appearance. Aroma is mildly floral, and taste is mildly hoppy, and it is somewhat refreshing. I think that's about all there is to say about this beer."
"Slightly dry after taste."
"Nothing special, which is no surpise for the style. What is surprising is the overall clean flavors and the lack of skunk or other off flavors that seem to plauge many beers in this style."
"This is a good beer, considering the style. Definitely drinkable. I do recall enjoying it little more under the Italian sun."
"In a land with decidedly fewer wine options, and way better beer ones, this is overwhelmingly average. However, it's the only remotely appropriate beer available at my favorite Neapolitan pizza joint, and the recently arrived summer heat again calls for a cold one."
"While my opinion of this beer is not very high, I have had it several times and will likely have it again. Its high carbonation pairs well with heavy Southern Italian fare, though I typically find wine to be the better option."
"Pours a golden color with a white head. Not much aroma on this one. Grains and slight hop aroma dominate. Very light flavor with some grains and earth tones. The flavor has a soft maltiness with some bright citrus character up front but gets nicely bitter as it goes back. Ok but not great."
"drinkability: very easy. but not really worth drinking a beer."
"Pours a very transparent golden yellow color with a small film of white head. Corny, macro malt nose, some hop presence but nothing impressive. Light in flavor and body, cleaner than some import macros but it still leaves your tongue with a slightly offensive taste. Crisp and very drinkable, it does its job without a doubt."
"D- I went into this not knowing if I would like it or not. I didn't know I ordered this until she brought it to me (this place I was at had 250 bottles there and I said the wrong number). It was a interesting try but something I would not seek out on my own again."
"I find it an example of an almost perfect balance between authentic robust beer flavor and character (body), yet light enough to drink many of them in one setting."
"Hmm, this one equates to a just above average light beer."
"Like most lagers (not adjunct or macro) it gets along very well with a thirsty palate. So yes, in a hot sunny day i would have more than one"
"Very good euro pale ale, not skunky, and no odd taste. Just very smooth and very clean drinking. Don't expect some big flavor or some incredible beer, expect a euro pale lager, as it should be. Good beer that really should be a benchmark for the style."
"drinkable for sure, not too exciting, but thats the style. it is refreshing and would probably be good with pasta"
"The taste is nice, clean, but very light. It has a crisp strong grain taste with mineral water, junipery hops, a bit sweet in the mostly grain aftertaste, a bit watery but overall fairly good."
"Drinkability: Another light, easy-drinking lager, but, thankfully, there's nothing inherently off or wrong about it."
"D- An ok brew that didn't wow me."
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer. I've definitely had many beers that are better. I would not seek it out. However, it is a reasonable beer and would likely go good with very spicy food. I will not search for this beer, but when in Rome do as the Roman's do."
"This beer might be just a hair above average. The most inoffensive aspect is the metal, but even that is low. As with many imported beers, there was a bit of skunk that diminished as the beer spent more time away from the bottle. Overall, it's worth a try."
"I tried this beer on a trip to San Pellegrino Italy. The locals will drink this beer if they run out of wine. Not a great beer,it is now imported by Heineken. it has alot of the same characteristics as Heineken. The Pilsner stlye beer is sharp on the toungue, and finishes skunky. There was a sour aftertaste, the appearance of the beer was good as the head lasted, and there was moderate lacing. The hops were evident in the nose, and slightly in the taste."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, pale golden in color, lots of bubbles from the carbo, minimal head and lacing. Smell is of yeast, wheat, and other earth elements. Taste is a subpar Pilsner to me, not very much going on beside a small dose of hops, some water elements and some yeast. Mouthfeel is carbonated, although crisp and refreshing. Can see this one going well with lighter dishes to say the least. Overall, not a favorite but a respectable Euro lager."
"Pours a dark red/brown colored body, with a small head, off-white in color. Has a malty effervescent aroma. Smells like a lager type beer. Has a bitter, sour, malty taste. A clean cold taste. Not a fan of lagers, could use a little more flavor, or crispness."
"Poured a clear honey amber color with a thin white head that almost didn't make it to the table. No lacing and no cover, but well carbonated. Clean crisp aroma, kinda of a clean straw smell. Clean crisp flavor also, lightly hopped, nothing offensive nor overpowering. Overall a good example of the style. Very drinkable and will have it again if its offered"
"I'd rather have a Carlsberg or a German pils, but these aren't as bad as the reviews make them out to be. On tap it's unoffensive and it certainly has more flavor than the domestic macro lagers."
"The Italians seem to appreciate simple pleasures to the max, and a solid, crisp refreshing lager is one of them."
"The Birra Moretti had a very clear, golden appearance with some okay head retention. The aroma was sweet and slightly grassy. The flavor, however, was pretty weak. It had a light, smooth and slightly water mouthfeel. There is not much to this beer and would not get this one again on it's own (it was part of a beers of the world package)."
"Pours a clear golden amber with not much head. Aroma is crisp and typically lagerish but with a hint of fruit. Flavor is like any average lager except for a fruity tough, but with a nasty, unpleasantly bitter undertone. Texture is thin, and it leaves a harsh, bitter aftertaste. Maybe my sample came from a bum batch."
"Just a step above the typical American Macro Lager. Nothing unappealing but nothing interesting. Pale yellow in color with no head. Mild grainy smell with some butter. Hint of grains and butter aroma. Faint hint of some fruity hops. Green apple maybe. It's drinkable enough and went well with my steak at Carrabas. Next time I'll try thier La Rossa."
"D. A nice little brew here. Some quality ingredients lend subtle flavors. Would like a bit more malt to fill it out, but I wish Euro Pale Lagers like this were more popular. Also this is leaps and bounds better than Heineken."
"D= An ok beer that I prefer to many other Euro Lagers. Clean flavor through and through."
"D - Would get it again, but not by choice. Probably would be better on a warm day; but other than that nothing to rave about."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style pale lager."
"D- Very drinkable. Best aspect of the beer is you can pound it"
"D: Undoubtably a very drinkable lager. Personal choice over American lagers."
"It was a very standard lager in my opinion. It poured a very nice color of amber with no head at all. There was almost no smell and the taste is exactly what I expected, a thin balance of hops and malt that didn't linger at all. Smooth drinker, could see myself having multiple of these if that was what I was in the mood for. An average beer, you'll get what you expect."
"Drinkability- Avoid this beer, it is awful."
"D: just too bland overall to entice me back. A little too bitter without some complimentary sweetness,citrus,anything."
"Overall-my short sentences define everything, it's a standard Euro Pale, doesn't do anything outside the ordinary."
"Drinkable. Turbog is a little better, peroni much worse."
"On tap at Mission Pizza in Fremont. A clear, yellow beverage with a fluffy white head. Aroma is mild, light grain and hops, borders on skunky but not offensively so. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, more so than its appearance would suggest, but it has a pronounced sweet malt flavor, balanced with a crisp hop finish and is ultimately a fairly drinkable beer. I would think it would go very well with pizza, but I'll have to verify that some other day."
"Overall it's not great, but it's not that bad either. Good enough to drink more than one of. I won't be getting it again anytime soon, but it's still a decent beer."
" An average euro pale."
"There's not much to look at, smell, or even taste, but it somehow manages to have more good than bad flavors, making it pretty drinkable for what it is."
"Wholly average in all respects..."
"not a great deal of carbonation. ok beer. probably will not buy again."
"It's very light almost watery, easy to drink, like lemon water, but the metal taste is the real turn off."
"Note: I was trying to buy La Rosa because I heard that was the best of the bunch from this brewery. Must have picked this up when I wasn't looking close enough, really dissapointing."
"Very average lager, nothing special about it. At least it is quite refreshing. Actually better than expected, considering I bought it very cheap in the supermarket."
"a light golden in color with a one finger white head that quickly faded and no lacing. strong metallic smell thats a real turn off. taste is dry, grainy, metallic tasting and little hop body to it. mouthfeel and carbonation were ok. pass this beer up it's not worth the price."
"D: Below average drinkability cant think of much of a reason to finish the beer I got let alone drink another one. Was a struggle to finish to say the least and one that is best avoided. Their La Rossa was better, try this instead."
"Not really an instant favorite of mine but is probably the best Italian beer that I've had so far."
"But really, considering the wines that Italy produces, isn't this like expecting a great SUV from Ferrari?"
"Pours a clear light gold. Some carbonation visible, decent white, sticky head dissipates quickly, leaving only a thin ring around the edge of the mug. Smells grainy, some corn and slightly sweet. Tastes like slightly sweet honeyed grains and a bitter finish. Low carbonation gives it an almost smooth and creamy feel in the mouth, but the body is a little thin. Low in alcohol, but this beer isn't quite refreshing enough for even a very hot day, and nothing impresses me enough to want another."
"Mouthfeel was rather sharp. Some grainy roughness. Medium to light body. Overall better than I expected and a nice accompaniment to a meal."
"M/D: A sharp feel from the hidden carbonation had a medium amount of weight and felt a little grainy. A refreshing brew and a decently drinkable beer."
"Pours yellow-gold with a white head that actually retains pretty well. Aroma is faint grass and grain. Flavor is analogous to a US macro but without the disgusting adjunct taste. Light, grainy, and a little fruity. Easy to drink, goes well with food."
"A bit grassy and grainy, light body and crisp finish. I guess drinkability is pretty good, it's just not great. This'll be my first Italian lager, and so far, it's not good...I'll give it one more try, assuming I can get a fresh bottle...which is probably unlikely as they do not put dates on them."
"D- Easy to drink not a whole lot going on here kinda boring and simple."
"Overall a painfully average European lager; neither offensive nor notable in any way. I'd rate it one step above Heineken and two steps below a Spaten, Paulaner, et al."
"Definately not a beer I'd drink again, unless I was at a bar in Italy. And in that case I'd probably drink some of the local wine. This beer just isn't very insipring."
"Can't think of anything that recommends this for any reason."
"Started off with something light today and it was not bad, my friend had talked about how good this was over in Europe so I decided to give it a try, would not drink again, not worth trying"
"drinkability is pretty good. it's a touch too sweet for what it is, and rather boring, but there's nothing wrong with it."
"Overall not as bad as I thought it was going to be. No skunk and a very clean finish. Not bad not bad..."
"Pours light gold with short lived white head. Smell is light sweet honey like malt. Hint of bittering hops. Pleasant smell. Taste is kind of light and sweet with honey again and some mild balancing bittering hops. Very easy drinking with no off flavors. Just a touch too sweet, with light carbonation and nice for a pale lager though."
"I would get this over other macros but it is just psychological."
"This pours a clear crisp gold with thin bubbly head that leaves behind a little bit of lace.The aromas are mostly of grainy malts and a Euro skunkieness.The taste is straight forward and similar to your average macro lager,again with a Euro Lager aftertaste,almost has some non-alcoholic similarities in flavor(cardboard comes to mind).There just was'nt anything that seperates this from your average run of the mill BMC."
"honestly, i could drink 12 of these beers"
"Someone gave me this beer, so I'm not that upset."
"On the whole, this is a pretty uninspired beer. One wonders what Birra Moretti was like before Heineken took them over. Now it's just a run of the mill macro lager. Pass on this one."
"This is a good beer. It poured a nice light amber with a small head. The taste was surprising and full flavored for the style with a good balance between hops and it's great sweet malt backbone. The mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy. I would definitely have it again."
"D: a decent Euro lager that, in my opinion, deserves a little better recognition than what it has been getting on this site. It's clean, its refreshing and makes a great session beer. On that note, I would buy this beer again."
"The ""UN"" beer--unremarkable, uninteresting, underwhelming. Pours a transparent straw yellow with very little head and no lacing to speak of. I honestly could not detect ANY smell to this beer...and the same thing can be said about the taste! There is NOTHING to this beer. Water with a small, small, small hint of malt. This is what I would expect if someone was trying to pass something off as beer that clearly WASN'T beer. The only thing about this beer that can be said is it has a good amount of carbonation and is easy to drink, but that is about it. Not good."
"I had no expectations of this beer that my parents picked up in Sicily, nor for any Euro Pale lagers. This one was okay, however. No bitterness like others, some notes of berries. No head retention and below average carbonation. Drinkable enough, maybe nice on warm day."
"I essentially bought this to give Italy a chance at showing me what they offer in terms of brewing. And it is a decent lager, but I would certainly reach for a beer from elsewhere if given the option to do so."
"Poured a clear golden color with decent white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Not too much aroma to speak of, much like an American macro lager. Taste was actually pretty decent, I was pleasantly suprised. Very smooth and easy drinking. Wouldn't seek this out, but wouldn't turn down either."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a straw yellow with a 2 finger fizzy head, OK longevity and good lace. Not much aroma to speak of - slight honey and malt and not much else. This tastes wierd. Initial tastlessness leads to quickly fading honey followed by an off hop bitterness that lingers too long. Its just a weird Euro macro. Stay away."
"another from a Christmas mix-pack"
"Drinkability was good, carbonation seemed slightly off for the taste but it surely went down smooth and this seemed to be a good beer if you needed to pace yourself through a long night with a decent taste."
"Poured golden, one finger head, not much lacing, smelled slightly malty, more like bread dough. This had more flavor than I expected, tasted more like a dark beer than the color showed. Not sure how long it was in the fridge....probably wouldn't run out to personally buy a case, but would like to review under different circumstances"
"This is a ho hum beer but decent for a macro lager. It has more hops and body than its american counterparts, still pretty insipid though."
"Overall this was a simple yet enjoyable beer. Would make a great session brew, as it's pretty easy to knock more than a few of these down at a sitting."
"Drinkability- Pretty go with Italian food. A little too expensive to be a party beer."
"D - This is probably my favorite of the euro pales. It's smoother and not as sharp. Bitterness is still mild, but these just seem to go down very easily. Plus how could you not love the man on the bottle? Is he contemplating the beer or sulking in it? Who knows, but I'm about to join him..."
"D - This is a fair average Euro Pale Lager. Nothing outstanding and nothing I'd buy, but if its free I'll drink it."
"Pours a very pale color with a thick, fluffy head that recedes slowly. Aroma is strong and malty, bready as well. Nothing truly special here. Taste is very thin and suprisingly drinkable. Goes down like water and leaves little if any aftertaste. Might be good on a hot day of mowing a lawn but largely unimpressive."
"Still worth it if you're in Italy, considering the price."
"D: I recall years ago having this brew before Heineken took it over. At that time I enjoyed the lager and shared it with friends. The current version is too thin, lacks character and has a distasteful sour aftertaste. Wantabe beer...at best."
"D: Very good. I had three with my birthday meal. It was perfect with my Pasta 'too good' that was full of chicken and shrimp in a butter sauce. This beer complemented my meal really well."
"This beer is basically a step up from Bud but more expensive. And like Bud, it would be a great beer to drink after coming home from working out in the sun all day. Oh yeah, and did I mention the mustachio is killer."
"It's an Italian Budweiser, except a little better. Refreshing on a hot day, but that is about it."
"This beer poured fine, not much of a head, but a nice carbonated bubbling. It's smell, though, was rather acidic and sour. It's tasted was equally sour. It's a rare beer that I cannot finish, but this was one. I made it maybe a quarter of the way down my glass before quitting. I thought I had bought a bad single, so I waited a week and tried again, but with the same results. After drinking the occasional Peroni, I was a disappointed in this brew."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color that looks almost neon in color. Thin white layer of head almost completely disappears. Smell is of corn, and grains with a light skunky kind of smell. Mouthfeeling is a little oily, and watery. Not the greates of beers but I like to enjoy this at some Italian restaurants."
"Rerate, 330 ml bottle, now available in Norway (ICA). ABV is 4.6%. Pale golden colour, large head. Theres an initial Heineken-isch whiff when you open the bottle (an American would probably say ""skunky""). In the glass the moderate aroma has notes of maize (corn) and cooked vegetables, hints of flowers and honey. Spritzy mouthfeel. The flavour actually has some malts, and also moderate hops in the finish, so this one is far from being the worst pale lager Ive tasted. Quite drinkable."
"Pale yellow color with a whispy head at best, but good lacing. Smells of grapefruit and bread. Pretty straight forward, typical faire. It tastes of mild wheat with a citrus overtone, a little malt noted. It is nicely carbonated, very fine bubblage. Paired with pasta, as I did while sampling this at a restaurant in Manhattan, this became quite suite, like cantaloupe. Fairly ordinary, no need to run out looking for this one, but refreshing enough, good with food, etc."
""
"One of the better (less macro-skunk flavored) tasting and drinking Euro Pale Lagers in my flight."
"Drinkability: I would drink this as an alternative to the normal macro lager. This is a really good beer for price. I wouldn't chase it but I wouldn't run from it either."
"Not a whole lot to say about this one. It looks good in my stange glass, smells and tastes like a pale lager, but it was rather watery feeling. You could drink it like water if you wanted to, but why would you? I imagine it's better with food than as an after dinner drink."
"Certainly preferable to a Bud or a Coors, but really nothing notable or memorable about this one. Standard European macro."
"Well this is a beer I was not expecting much and my wishes came rue. Pale straw yellow color. A very slight malty sweetness in smell. Taste, light malt flavor, very light citrusy flavor, light hopiness. Thin mouthfeel. Overall it is not impressive. If I were to compare to any BMC I would say it's a lot better than what we can produce, and if BMC wants to make a good dull beer, this would be it. A nice lawnmower beer and that's about it."
"Overall, a beer that is lacking in any depth or character."
"Average beer. I enjoy the Rossa more and need to find the non-Heineken version of this beer to see if it's better."
"This is a pretty uninspiring beer. Within its style, it's fine, but I just can't get behind this beer."
"I could be wrong, but Birra Moretti might be the first Italian beer I've ever had. The beer poured a pale yellow with visable bubbles. The aroma was clean but non distinct. It had a transparent, deep golden hue with a thin white head and moderate lacing. Full, smooth mouthfeel, well malted flavor. Compares well with many classic German lagers."""
"Overall: A fairly decent if unremarkable Euro lager."
"Drinkability- Ehh, just another macro-esque brew. Not horrible, but no reason to revisit again. I feel sorry if this is Italys go to brew."
"Pours a very light crystal clear straw color. I can actually see my fingerprint on the other side of the glass through the beer. There's a little white fluffy head that fades away pretty quickly. The smell is slightly yeasty and not much else. Tastes fairly clean with some slight hop character, but very little. I can't taste any malt at all, it must be made with a lot of adjuncts. Finishes cleanly. Mouthfeel is bubbly and a little creamy, not bad. Overall, it's fairly drinkable cause there's not much there to object to. Other than that, it's a standard macro with little flavor."
"Average looking lager, some retention and lacing which may turn out better if I'd let the beer warm a bit more. Smells of grainy malt and slightly of cooked veggies. First swig did not make a good impression. Maybe the old guy is spitting into his mug? Bland except for a harsh mineral water aftertaste. Mouthfeel noted a touch a creaminess, but can't get over how blah this lager is. At $12.99/sixer I'll be taking a pass on this one."
"Medium-light yellow with a very small, white, frothy, quickly-diminishing head. Smells of that typical euro graininess with that typical euro stink. Grain and straw. Tastes like all the characteristics of Heineken I dont like, magnified. It has a thin body, watery texture and low carbonation. Overall, theres no reason to ever pay this much for a cheaply made import."
"My loving wife brought me back a 750 ml bottle of this from her trip to Italy. The bottle sports an October 2007 freshness date. Pours a crisp, clear yellow with a thin white head. Very little intention. Pretty basic beer - clean taste, malty center, little bit of a hoppy aftertaste. Slightly watery mouthfeel. Although not exceptional, this beer is definitely a step up from a vast majority of American macro lagers. Very easily drinkable, not too complex, but goes down well."
"Pours a pale yellow, with a thin white head. Not much retention, but good lacing. Nice bottle. Smell is weak,and bready,with maybe some faint hops.Body is thin,and carbionated. Taste is typical macro. Grainy, with a slightly bitter finish. I would take it over a Bud."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light straw, forming a very thin head that faded quickly, leaving very light lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly skunky, with a little hop citrus notes. The taste is light hops, a little grain flavor, and water. Mouthfeel is very light and thin. Overall, this tastes like a cross between St Pauli Girl, and Bud Light. Not horrible, but I could NOT make a session out of this one."
"I would recommend the Moretti Amber. Much more flavor and an overall better beer."
"The taste wasn't anything to write home about either. Typical Euro Pale fare, with a cereal/grain flavor dominating, a bitter/skunky finish, and little hop or malt character in between. It tasted almost exactly like a Foster's, for my money. The one thing I did enjoy was the mouthfeel. It wasn't overly carbonated, but smooth, and fairly full-bodied. That was unexpected. Would I have another? No thanks."
"looks fine, smells fine -- both standard macro lager fare. taste was okay, weak malt profile, slight hops, maybe a hint of grapes -- until it warmed a bit. then it tasted very stale. very high level of carbonation made tasting the beer a struggle. wouldn't turn it down if it were the only thing offered, but i would definitely not purposely have this again."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a 2 finger head that dissipates quickly. Not much to smell. Not much to taste, some hops, all very mild and thin in the mouth. Maybe okay on a hot summer day; you could throw down a few of these to quench your thirst. Only my second Italian beer."
"D - Suffers from the bitterness and musky rot-gut taste. I will never drink this again."
"This beer is drinkable, but average. I prefer an American lager to a Euro anyway, but I think there are probably better Euro lagers as well."
"No real mouthfeel, this has not impressed me at all. On a warm, sunny day in Italy, it may taste different, but on a cold November night in England, it has scored very poorly."
"Pours yellow into pilsner glass, white head with moderate retention, leaves some lacing. Aroma is grainy and floral hops. Malty flavor with hop bitterness in the finish. This is without a doubt better than any US macro lagers, but is kind of average amoung European lagers. If this were the best available I would choose this and enjoy it, but otherwise I probably won't revisit this beer."
"Birra Moretti is enjoyable to a great limit, but since is export i believe its price is not compare for what you are buying, i even had italian opinion saying that naztro azzuro is the best italian beer, and i agree"
"D: Easy drinker, but boring."
"poured a pale yellow body with a nice foamy white head and thousands of tiny bubbles that continuously streamed to the top. Aroma is of sweet malt along with some grassy notes. Tastes of sweet grain with just a hint of malt in the background and a slight bitterness in the finish. Light-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Real easy to drink, but just a little too boring to want to."
"Birra Moretti pours a pale yellow with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma has a mild skunk note and I think I smell corn. The taste is decent, it is heavy on the malt. Not bad for a lawnmower type beer. I like that there really isn't any skunk in the taste, which is all to common in Euro lagers. Worth a try."
"Overall-a decent selection from a fellow beer club memeber. However, as summer is winding down, this light refresing deck beer comes a tad late for me."
"12 oz. bottle with some code on the label - served in a pilsner glass. It pours a clear medium gold with light carbonation and a finger of white head that leaves some wisps of lace. It smells clean, with lemon/apple and a light skunk/spice. The taste is similar with the addition of grapes and grassy/spicy hops that leave a mild bitterness. The body is medium - thicker than expected - with medium carbonation and a short finish. Overall not great, but more flavorful than American macros."
"Poured into a pub glass, a light golden color.transparent,a small layer of white foam,not a lot of carbination.Foam does cling to the side of the glass.A bready,grainy aroma.no real hop presence.A thin mouthfeel,tastes like fillers were added,not a real malty taste.a slight bitterness at the finish.It's like an everyday normal drinking beer,not bad nothing special.Not a filling beer ,not a real tasty beer either."
"A very pale yellow pour, with good carbonation, and thin white head that floated atop the glass, but virtually no lacing. Aroma was your typical BMC-type skunky hops, and the flavor wasnt anything to write home about. This all added up to a lackluster, dry finish. I enjoyued the Moretti La Rossa, but this one didnt do anything for me."
"It was fairly sharp and crisp, but after two bottles Id be squinting at the brew too."
"Not recommended."
"This beer was lighter in coler with just a bit of golden hue. There was a foamy white head. The smell was of corn. The taste was like a light beer with a touch of vanilla. There was a sore throat like aftertaste usually assostiated with malt liqour. The mouthfeel was fairly creamy but the aftertaste was too much. I would likely pass this beer next time."
"Drinkability: Certainly useable as a quaffer, but brings little else to the table. As simple as they get."
"Very average all around. It was an easy drinker though. Very smooth and light, and since it's about 105 degrees right now, I found it easy to suck this baby down. The euro malt flavors are always welcomed by me. I could easily enjoy a few of these on a hot day, when just looking for an easy drinker. Better than Peroni."
"Pretty average euro lager. Similar to the Heineken I had last night, and surprise, surprise, this beer is affiliated with Heineken. A decent beer that is refreshing on a hot day, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get another one since Heineken is similar, more readily available and cheaper."
"Overall, this one isn't bad. I'd take it over many other green bottle euro lagers."
"Never been a Euro pale lager fan but this one's not too bad. No skunkiness and fairly smooth"
"A good light lager for warm weather days and to drink anytime."
"Notes: Did nothing to change my mind about how I feel about lagers. Nothing else really to say about this one."
"Eric"
"Very drinkable beer. Recommended, especially when in Italy."
"Overall: Overall quite clean  nothing bad going on, but not a beer that stands out, either."
"Light golden color, white fine white head and fine carbonation beading throughout the beer. The beer has a moderate creamy head with good retention. The aroma is strong and sweet and the beer has a light sweet taste with a very slight toasted malt flavor. This beer is light on the palate, but toasty. This is a tasty beer for the style and would be a great hot summer day drinking beer."
"A very drinkable Italian beer. I had this in a restaurant, but would consider picking up a six pack."
"This is a decent beer, light colored, light flavored. While it doesn't offend, it did not keep me from switching over to some interesting wines for dinner. Decent enough for a ""waiting"" for your table beer."
"Drinkability - For a hot day, refreshing. Better selection than many other lagers, such as Becks or Heineken. For a European lager, it's not bad. Overall, a very average beer. Neither offensive nor special in any way. (For Italian beers, better than Peroni or Castello. Not as good as Moretti La Rossa - but more refreshing than La Rossa on a warm day or as a thirst quencher.) Could have this as a mediocre session beer."
"Otherwise....Borrring."
"Rather drinkable, due to a good flavor and a mouthfeel that keeps you going back for more, despite being a rather forgettable pale lager. A good, quaffable beer. I'd pick this over any macro lager."
"Overall. i like this one over others in its style. a little different in its flavor, but rather enjoyable."
"Very pale gold in color, very clear, with a tiny head. Aroma is a bit bready, but the warm, slightly sour smell reminds me most of... piss. Sorry, not trying to be derisive, just descriptive. The flavor is straight macro lager, with little in the way of malt flavor and a slight hop bite for bitterness. Not very substantial, this beer fades from the palate quickly and doesn't fill you up. There's not really much here to like, but too much to dislike either. This beer's offensiveness is in its banality."
"Figured I'd crack an Italian beer during the Olympics, and I hadn't reviewed this bad boy yet.. Very clear pale yellow color...decent head for a lager as light as this. Faint grassy aroma, nothing too much going on in the flavor department either. Not offensive in the least bit..I'm really just pleasantly surprised this wasn't complete euroskunk."
"Drinkability: Bland and forgettable. Most of these euro lagers are as repetative as american macro lagers."
"Overall - An average lager... worth a try maybe once...."
"I had this one on-tap, as an accompaniment to dinner. Its a pale straw color with a large, fluffy, white head. Very modest aroma: grassy, a little grain, a slight hop smell. The taste is of pale base malt and corn. Theres a little hop bitterness. The brew is of moderate sweetness, with a very light body and fairly high carbonation. Theres really not very much thats special about this brew. Its a slightly above average macro lager. Its decent and enjoyable for what it is, but doesnt go beyond that."
"Taste is unimpressive, although not quite as bad as I expected given my dislike of the nose. The mouthfeel has a sharp character to it which gives it a slight kick - a good thing, given that otherwise the taste is fairly bland. There is a European, slightly sweet character to the hops but there is not much else to speak of. It's slightly bitter, slightly tangy, slightly flavoursome. Slightly drinkable."
"Pours to a golden color with a good head, doesn't hold up too bad. Has good carbonation. Almost a honey aroma. Tastes sweet with a smooth finish throughout. Light and smooth, refreshing after a 15 hour day. A good thirst quenching beer. I could drink many of these, especially in the heat. Refreshing, but not as quite as tasty as when purchased in a quart bottle from a street vendor in Venice, and quaffed while sitting on the seawall."
"Really pale in color but with a nice large fluffy white head. Aroma is dry and spicy with a wet grass note. Taste seems to offer little other than a straw grain quality. A bit of cardboard in there and some residual sweetness. Finish is dry with some grassy hops. Aftertaste leaves a metallic note in my mouth. It became hard to finish just one. There's some flavor here but most of it are off-flavors."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some decent crispness in the finish."
"Poured into a Pilsner glass, and it dosen't look bad. Pale, good clarity, vicious carbonation, and good head retention. Dosen't look flat at all, a problem I've had with generic Euro-Lagers.... Smell is sweet and malty, I was expecting a certain skunkiness, but it's not there, thankfully. Taste is very bready, so much as to be almost nutty, not much more, a slight hoppy bitterness washing down. A decently balanced brew, I'm surprised with this one. Not complex, but quaffable, and the 4.6% isn't a drawback, as it feels pretty full-bodied in the mouth. This is a surprisingly good lager, much more than I was expecting."
"Drinkability - Being this as light as it is, you can probably down a few a night and still drink some more."
"Clear straw yellow with some golden hues. A foamy bright white head rises up a full inch and leaves some simmering meringue that slowly fades. Aroma is slightly bitter and grassy, a little malty. Flavor is buttered corn upfront, followed by biscuity malt, with a slight tingle in the finish, which may be more from carbonation than hops. Flavor is even, not too complex, but refreshing and enjoyable. Biscuity malt and hints of corn continue evenly throughout the glass. Mouthfeel is smooth and even, moderate carbonation."
"pours a 2 finger head that laces the glass strongly. has a nice herbal, spicy aroma. its taste sans the nice aroma is quite macro-lager prototypical with a light mouthfeel. very drinkable as a macro-lager should be. a nice addition to an italian meal out."
"I would not go thirsty by not drinking this one."
"It was an alright beer with little above average drinkability."
"Another ""gem"" I found at the local Winn-Dixie that was closing. Paid $4.30 for a six.Cool label. Thats about all I can say good about this beer. Pours a very pale golden yellow color with little head. Sweet, malty aroma with a little grassiness in the background. Nothing noteworthy in the taste department. An Italian Fosters?"
"as a side note, i just had a steinlager that would kick this beers ass. this seems way off target style-wise in comparison."
"Slightly watered down mouthfeel, but flavors of corn and dry grains are evident. Bitter foreign hop quality with a bland backdrop. A straight Euro lager, but nothing special."
"Smelled like a typical lager except that I'll add this beer does have a backbone in the smell...a bit of a malty burnt type smell that had me interested. My first gobble was nice and refreshing. As the beer warmed up a bit it was tougher to consume as the carbonation wore off quickly which left to much of the beer undisguised. It has a surprisingly nice mouthfeel though that has a bit of a creamy feel. overall a beer I could session without hesitation."
"Really needs some flavor behind it."
"Drinkability: It drinks easy and smooth and you could easily knock a few of these back. But when it comes to Italian food I think ill stick to red wine. Dont get me wrong it was an enjoyable beer just not anything special."
"Appearance is a nice light gold with an ivory head that leaves some nicely retentive lace. Aroma contains barley and hops, alont with something akin to tin. Initial taste is creamy and light, with honeyed malt and grains that settle down to a dry tinny flavor after the hops add some lemon zest. Finish is reminiscent of sweet Lipton. Drink it with food, and it might work."
"Taste is grassy, rice crispness. Sparkling mineral water flavors. Long unpleasant mineral bitterness. Clean and crisp mouth. Very fizzy. Overall, unpleasant little lager lots of that mineral water bitterness (for lack of a better descripter) and not enjoyable on any level."
"I could have done without ever having drank this beer. It's moderatly drinkable, despite its fizzy body. Mostly because it's so plain."
"It pours a light golden colour in its own Moretti glass which was chilled in the fridge. An initially foamy head under my careful pour quickly retreated to my disappointment, leaving very, but not fiercely, fizzy body. On nose it had very light lager malts and a little hint of grassy note of hops. On palate, again, very light malty flavour was underlined by a dash of doughy sourness, finished with some dryish feel in the mouth and nothing else... Overall the mouthfeel is quite smooth for a fizzy and standard macro lager like this, but the body is way too flat and even watery throughout. After several sips I was thus more than happy to quaff it along with my meal, a thing I would never do to any beer I deemed enjoyable in its own right."
"Well, CAH had some Moretti glasses last night. They tell me that it's the LaRossa on-tap. HA! It was this damned Heineken clone. My first thought was Heineken from the moment the skunkiness hit my nose. Then I log on to do my review...and there it is...""associated with Heineken"" right there at the top of window. It shows. My notes say, ""Heineken with sugar"" for the taste. Ultrathin mouthfeel and a fizzy lazy finish. Not meant for repeat tasting. Cool logo and glass though."
"Drinkability; I knew what I was in for when I cracked this open and there were no surprises; a decent Euro lager but nothing to ponder over"
"Sinkability  When in Italy, take the Brunella over the Birra."
"Fairly average beer, nothing to make it stand out."
"their doppelbock rocks, though."
"A visiting buddy left this one in my fridge, and I wasn't that excited to try it. Beat my expectations by a little bit, but nothing I really want to try again."
"Drinkability: Average brew. Not exceptionnal, not awful."
"While not one of my fav's this beer went PERFECT with a piece of pizza (it was given to me while sitting an a pizza parlor outside the Vatican). Drank out of a bottle so I cant say much about the color, but the taste was what an American mass-produced lager (Bud, PBR) is supposed to taste like. Very heavy on the wheat which gives it a good grainy mouthfeel, but once swallowed this dissipates almost instantly. Kind of a dry aftertaste which warrents another. Very enjoyable for social events, when you aren't looking to examine for taste."
"I tried a bottle of this omnipresent brew, while having a slice at my local pizza parlor. Pours pissy yellow, white, medium bubble head. Not any aroma to comment on. This is, as expected, a thin grainy brew. watery, with a hint of malt in the background. Also noticed some hoppy dryness in the minimal finish. Typical, unexciting macro lager. Did serve the purpose of washing the 'za down, but thats about it. l"
"Golden straw in color; clean, with a decent, rather thicck, soft-white head. Light biscuity malt aroma gets lost in the stronger, minty euro-hop smell. Light skunkiness, but not too bad. Taste...where's the malt? Now sweetness. Faint cardboard wafer flavor. Hops are better and lightly bitter, vegetal, and minty. Flashes of grain in the finish. Light-bodied and overcarbonated. Needs more malt, but not too bad."
"I have no idea what Birra Moretti's calorie count is, but it strikes me as a classic light beer. Light in appearance, light in aroma, light in flavor and light in body. If that's what Castello Di Udine was shooting for, they nailed it. Good for rehydration?"
"A pretty fair lager for what it is, nothing special though"
"This one poured out golden with no head, bits of white that swirled up here and there, and lots of carbination rising up. Crappy Firewaters for an insanely detergent laced glass.... can barely smell the beer.... (soon I'm going to realize they are doing me a favor!) Barely get a whiff of floral maltiness... Giving it the benefit of a doubt, this bottle is well past it's prime. Freaking skunky tasting as allhell. Very low carbination in the taste, especially for all the bubbles that you see, you cannot feel it. You get a bit of caramell sweetness, bit of bitter hoppiness are still present, but I just keep thinking of roadkill skunks swirled up into my glass. Ok, I managed to drink about an inch into it, and even got Mark and Karen to try it... god am I cruel! Finally just asked the bartender to pour this out, not worth making myself sick over... To give them credit, I did get a makeup beer from them."
"Pours pale yellow like hay. Head? not really. There are very large bubbles that stick around for a few seconds but barely a head. Smells of wheat and alcohol, rather beery. Not as much skunk as others. Taste is a bit weak. It reminds me of a European style lager made lite. Was decently clean in mouthfeel. Overall, it was OK, nothing special."
"Another pointless lager taking up shelf space at my local SAQ..."
"This is a modestly flaovred beer that is inoffensive and easy to drink. It's uncomplex but not bad."
"Final thought: A decent lager, but there are better ones at a better price. I only purchased this because it was on sale for $6.99 a six, when it is usually $9.39 a six."
"The mouthfeel was likewise somewhat weak and thin. An OK beer to pound down a few, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Drinkability - easy to drink, all around good beer."
"When in the North End, have the wine instead."
"A very average, European pale lager, but better than I expected based on some unpleasant experiences with Italian brews in the past. This one is quite drinkable and refreshing, albeit average for style. I wouldn't seek it out, nor would I turn it down."
"Overall not bad for an import lager. Very easy drinking. The crispness and supporting hop flavor does a nice job of cleasing the palate while enjoying Italian fare, specifically with red sauce or something a little greasier like sausages. Although nothing spectacular Moretti is something worth considering."
"I'd choose this over American mass produced stuff, but that's about the only time it would really win out with me. Again, not a bad beer, just not something I enjoyed a whole heck of a lot."
"Drinks really well."
"Quicky fading head on a transparent yellow color body. The smell show dark fruits and caramel. The taste is malty and reminded me mostly of watery caramel. Nicely nutty, almost chestnutty. Salted, a bit buttery, and with a chewy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is ok, maybe a bit weak, but hops and chestnuts combine enjoyably on the palate. Decent."
"The mouthfeel is thin and mildly crisp with a fairly clean finish. Some sweetness of the malt lingers for a brief moment after swallowing. Slightly higher than average in the drinkability category."
"Okay so italians are known mostly for wine with the meals but this beer does Italians proud. This is what a lager should taste like, light crisp and very refreshing. Pours a gold yellow with minimal head, The smell is of light grains and hops. The taste a light crisp blend of hops and a little honey, creamy for a lager. On a hot summer day by the BBQ this is a great refreshing lager. I strongly suggest serving this beer at your next BBQ for people you usually only drink bud, millers etc."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored brew with almost no head. Aroma is quite thin and almost non-existent. Taste is a light mix of sweetness with some floral malt. No aftertaste to speak of and carbonation is not good. Body is quite thin. Overall, this is a refreshing lager that doesnt have much in term of taste."
"Pours a pretty good looking clear deep gold under a one finger white head that settles surprisingly slowly. No lace. There's a bit of adjunct grain and metallic hop in the nose. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste is surprising - there is a mild cherry fruit-sweetness here to accompany a bit of malt. This is followed by a very mild hoppy bite, which intensifies to not quite bitter in the finish, but leaves very little aftertaste. A good session beer."
"Definitely a session brew."
"Quite drinkable, but by no means a stand out."
"Drinkable"
"Medium bodied malt taste with a layer of bitter hops that runs throughout. Lasting light hop bready finish. A nice, drinkable lager."
"I will definitely give this brew another try. Restaurant lighting (soft, low incandescent) and the frosted glass could have had some effect on the way I rated this beer."
"Now owned by Heineken. 4.6% abv pours a pale golden hue with a bright white head forming nice but it doesn't stick around, give or take a few small specks of fine bubbled lacing. Aroma strong cereal grains, cooked vegetable mild biscuit malt breadiness. Flavor assertive grassy hop flavor compared to most pale lagers, touch of bitterness but some cooked vegetables and cereal grains arises with biscuit malt sweetness. No skunkiness to be had here just some spicy herbal hops in the finish with a touch of sulfur. Mouthfeel is a bit high on the carbonation really tickles the back of the palate all the way up to the nasopharyngeal junction. Drinkability not bad especially when served cold, suitable for a mainstream macro/Euro lager."
"I must admit, this was far better than I had expected. The Bier tapped to a golden and bubbly presentation. What little bit of a head was left for me quickly vanished into the atmosphere. The aroma offered me a little more in the way of hops and malt than I expected, but it was still somewhat metallic, and the aroma overall was average at best. This Bier drinks rather well though. Light in flavor and light on the palate, I can see this one pairing very well with any number of Italian dishes, and being able to stand up to and cut through just about anything. Not bad."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale malt scent that is dominated by a breadlike lager yeast smell. The taste is good. It is light, but mildly malty with that breadlike finish. It is slightly bitter and dry. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks quite well; a fine brew from Italy."
"This lager from Italy poured a ligh, crystal clear, and effervescent golden color, and in both smell and tadte it was about what I expected: a lightly-hopped beer with citrus aroma and a thin, smooth lemony taste. A good complement for a heavy meal, but not a beer I'd drink in and of itself."
"This is an evenly blended brew. Very Dry! Good on a hot day I suppose."
"I can't abide a brewery/beer that doesn't try to push the envelope somehow- make it extra hoppy or extra malty or add anchovies--do something!"
"Very drinkable."
"This golden beer poured a nice little head that went away quickly. The smell was more reminiscent of wine than beer. The taste was a little more reminiscent of beer. I had this with some pizza and it complimented it fairly well. Very little mouthfeel to this. This was not a beer really worth chasing down for another taste."
"Overall, this was one of the better pale lagers I've tried. It went well with the chicken and pasta with a white sauce. The beer's taste and feel did well to complement the meal and it would probably make for a decent warm weather cooler."
"In general I was quite satisfied with this first introduction to Italian beer. I'll admit I've come across many beers from better-known beer-making nations that weren't nearly as good."
"An OK beer in a session. Light, malt, acidic, yellow, much carbonation. Hoppy. White bubbly head. Like your average beer on tap at a meal. A abalance with food.. Very standard eastern European style beer, but slightly better brewed than a North American national brand."
"Overall Impression: eh. Enjoyable, but mild. Put this out to expose the hard core Bud Lite drinkers to something different, but not exotic."
"The prototypical lager clear gold on the pour with the head average in size, bright white in color, frothy in texture and a decent sheet of lace. Malt dominates the crisp and somewhat sweet nose, start is lightly sweet, top a bit thin for my taste. Finish is prickly in its acidity, hops are apropos to the style, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting."
"Much less flashy than a lot of other beers, though this isn't always a bad thing. Completely drinkable, perhaps good for just kicking back and relaxing."
"Really bad aftertaste I think I still taste it today!!"
"Overall, I prefer this over Italy's other main macro, Peroni. Although this beer isn't all that exciting, it seems to me that it is crafted a little bit better than Peroni, and the brown bottling doesn't hurt either. Good hot weather beer, plus I wouldn't mind trying this with some pasta if I ever get the chance."
"I really enjoyed this beer. A friend brought a six pack over for a barbeque we were having. This beer complimented the grilled chicken quite well. Pours out to a darkish yellow in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of grains, but it also has a floral smell as well that is really good. This beer, tastewise, reminds me of beers from the Czech Republich, i.e. Budvar, Pilsner Urquell, Rebel,, etc., but might be even more balanced. A very surprising beer and one I will pick up again."
"I must say, this has got to be one of my favourite brews. It pours a light golden colour, and has a delicate, snow white head about it. The head is a little quick to dissipate to a light, white haze over the surface that I would hesitate to still call the head. Delicate lacing of the glass, and a soft, ""clean"" smell (if that makes any sence at all; that's the only way I know how to describe it.) The taste is quite good indeed. Likewise, the mouthfeel is also pleasant. This beer isn't at all aggresive, and has a nice finish with a pleasant aftertaste I have trouble describing. As I mentioned before, this is indeed one of my favourite brews and I could drink these light weight Italians all night long. They also go well with Italian cuisine. A nice veal parmesan accompanied by a cool pint of Moretti is quite tasty!"
"I actually liked this beer. Went nice with my meal (pasta) and very easy to drink. Price is a little high for this style but a better alternative if you are anti-big-brewer but like this style."
"I credit the greatness of this beer to the fact that Friuli was once ruled by the Hapsburgs. It should be compared to other great beers from that empire such as Pilsner, Budweijc, and Vienna Lager."
"Medium straw color, very large head. A medium bodied Kolsch style ale. Subtle malts, mild and somewhat sweet. Mild hops with a slight spiciness. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice refreshing ""summer"" beer."
"Very pale clear yellow color with a fast dissappearing bright white head of rather large bubble sizes. Charged with upwelling carbonation. Sweet hay-like aromas, enough sweetness to suggest a decent malt backbone. Simple and straightforward malt flavor of sucrose and husky grain with a bitter nut-skin hop balance. Swallow is a little unsettling, too much carbonation and some vague phenolics that lean on the metallic side. To my mind, too sharp at the close due to the finishing effects."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden yellow, with a big head that slowly receded. No real lacing is evident. Aroma is of malt and hops, taste is slightly sweet, with some bitterness of the hops in the finish. Seems just like any other fizzy yellow beer. Not bad but nothing great."
"Not a beer I would actively seek-out, but it was the best beer offered at Magianos. I would have no problem drinking it again!"
"Pours a crystal clear gold with a generous white head. Fairly retentive head with decent lacing down the glass. The nose is malty with hops overlay. The flavors are mostly of the malt with some notes of grain. Little bittering to balance the malt body. Slighty thin and watery body. This is a clean, refreshing and drinkable beer with little to recommend it over dozens of other pale lager style beers."
"Drinkability/notes: A simple but pleasing beer that I think would compliment spicy foods. Very easy to drink."
"It was just like any other lager of it type. It poured a light golden yellow with little foam. The aroma was the same as all other your lagers of this type. But, this is the better of the Italian beers. Little on the bitter side, but, refreshing and interesting taste. I would serve it to my friends that don't know the difference. Any light color lager is great to them."
"Was introduced to this beer at a special tasting on tap at a local pub, but the review comes from the bottled version. This beer pours a golden color with a thin white head that leaves little lace on the glass. The aroma was nice, but nothing special. The taste of this beer is very good for its classification - very satisfying and enjoyable. I've found the only problem with this beer is that it becomes skunky very quickly, so be careful if you're having it out of the bottle."
"A nice golden color with some fizzy carbonation and a very thin pathy head. Aroma is faint, some wheat and hops can be detected. A slight grainy and malt combined taste off the top, a little touch of spicy hops, very little are noted through the body. A somewhat bland beer that lacks any decent characteristics, I was hoping for more flavor and taste."
"I had this with a pizza here in Greensboro at Elizabeth's pizza,light gold/yellow color with small head.Smell of hops with malt backbone.Taste was pretty decent good balance,a little fruity.Nothing spectacular but very drinkable,better than Miller low-life and AB products."
"The smell is ok, a little sharp but I was ready for that. Nothing that is going to turn me off this beer. Little head, kind of flat and a pale yellow colour. The apperarance is even worse if you count the goofy looking guy on the label with the fur growing on him. Taste is somewhat sweet and goes down easy making this a good session beer."
"F."
"This was my first taste of an Italian beer. I tried it in London, England while eating pasta in a small Italian restaurant called Delartista. It was the one bere they had and I must say that I enjoyed it. I thought that it was probably a mixture of the bere and atmosphere so I just tried it again back in Canada. Again I was pleasantly surprised by the overall taste. I would definetally drink it again."
"Slightly dark straw color with active carbonation and a barely off-white head of average volume and persistence. Pours completely clear. Light, grainy smell with a touch of hops; quite pleasant though not so strong. Sweet from start to finish, though the texture gets somehow fuller and the taste more honeylike toward the end. Too syrupy-sweet to enjoy in quantity, but a nice beer nonetheless."
"very light golden colour. not much of head on this beer. i found it to be nicely hopped....more than a generic macro lager but less than a classic european pils ie. urquell, kozel etc. still quite an easy drinking beer that is average and drinkable but not great by an stretch of the imagination. i would have to try this beer again in order to give it a fair shake. (i had a few before my first sample)."
"Pours a semi-clear golden yellow color with a thin white head that fades into a thin sticky lace. Fairly light and clean aroma with notes of sweet grains and spicy hops. Taste is light and crisp with flavors of fresh grains, raw honey, and a bit of citrus. Mild bite of spicy hops in the finish. A nice brew that cries out for a big plate of spicy pasta."
"Consumed 1 January 2003"
"The appearance is a bright and clear yellow / straw color. The head is frothy, white in color, somewhat creamy, the settles to decent lace. On the nose the aroma is slightly grainy and slightly grassy. On the palate grainy husk flavors, grassy, dryness, sharp mouthfeel, very soft citrus bite, slight sweetness, underlying bitterness, dry and crisp, but there is nothing that really makes you jump out of your seat... decent though."
"A good euro lager that is hard to say anything bad about. It's not great or outstanding in any way; just a good beer."
"I have always loved this beer. Great with Italian food and when you are thirsty. Nice crisp lager style. Done very well. Much better than many lagers from the states. Crisp, corn taste."
"I visited Italy this summer and i, like most people, wanted to enjoy pasta and pizza with beer. I tried this beer with pizza and pasta and i have to admitt i really enjoyed it. As soon as i came back to Cyprus i looked for it and found it in some Italic Restaurants. Quite nice appearance, can't really tell the taste since i only tasted this beer with food. Drinkability 4/5 especially when really cold"
"I always order this at Regina's when I am eating pizza. It really has no taste. Almost like a light beer. Yellow color, it looks watered down in the glass, with very little head. No bad after taste, and it does not seem to battle the taste of the food. Who would drink wine with pizza anyways?"
"nice golden color, a vigorous pour produces a fine head which leaves a fine lace down the glass.  smells of grain and malt, and a bit of hops.  tastes ok....euro grain and malt flavors abound with a dry and crisp finish after a somewhat smooth mouthfeel.  an average beer but i would imagine it would be a good choice to wash down some delicious Italian dish."
"I looked forward to trying this brew as with other italian offerings. What impressed me most with thisone was its appearance. Its pure yellow gold,very clear body while topped with a frothy, cream-puff pillow that settled down to lace about average. Its a above average in carbonation while the taste is not weak but more mellow. It lacks a crisp bite. Anyways, with pasta & pizza you don't want to overpower the sauce, making this a good companion."
"it was good, not great, but definitely worth trying. kick of carbonation and a nice malt flavor were the most noticeable traits of this one. it went down great, and stood up to fierce competition on a sampling night."
"A very average and typical Italian lager. Tastes not unlike Peroni. Clear, very carbonated, with a decent malt flavor. A very drinkable brew, goes down smoothly with not much else to speak of. The guy on the label looks kinda cool though."
"Hmmm...where to begin.  Well, I am going from memory of last night but well, i do remember being pretty disappointed with this brew.  Here it goes...This beer is very carbonated, the first thing that hits you is the pitter patter of its bubbles hitting off you palate similiar to that of pop rocks (figuretivly).  Its a nice novelty for the first few sips but once that wears off you realize that what you have in your hand is a boring beer.  The taste is nothing really worth commenting on or berating; it's a little bitter with a slight creaminess to it.  I do not want to anger anyone by saying this but well, to me, this beer is the Italian Corona, flavorless and no where near worth what it costs."
"Clear, light golden in color with a bright white head that dissipates quickly. Fast rising tiny bubbles add to the appearance.The aroma is richly malty with a very light, spicy hop in the background. The body is medium with a very fine, highly effervescent carbonation. The flavor offers a very nice, rich maltiness that's well backed by grassy, spicy hops leaving a short, dry finish with a gently lingering maltiness and bitterness. Well balanced with an interesting malt character."
"Just a notch above awful for every category, sweetish and bland, fizzy and yellow, and overall, pretty much a snoozefest, no character at all, their La Rossa is much better."
"Crystal clear yellow color, thin fizzy white head. Head didn't last for more than a minute. Lots of grainy and bitter hop smells, slightly metallic as well. Taste was crisp light bitterness, lots of snappy hop taste. Bitterness was right on for a European Pilsener. Light bodied, not much malt to notice, more of a grainy finish. Nothing lingers to long, overall crisp and refreshing. I would order it an Italian Restuarant."
"Decent retention with a sticky white lace, nearly clean aroma with a trace of overcooked hop and husky sweet grain. Crispness gets lost within the grainy mouth feel, big grass almost earthened flavour from the grain with a sturdy yet underlying hop bitterness. Decent beer all around, seems to go better with pasta in a heavy cream sauce rather than the typical red gravy."
"Birra Morreti: From the bottle.  The color was a standard amber/golden euro lager.  This beer had a slightly unusual odor, almost like the metal copper. This was very much a light in body euro-lager, with slight malt flavor.  Toward the finish, and in the aftertaste, hops became much more pronounced, no doubt to compete with Italian food.  Not a bad accompaniment to an Italian dish."
"Straw yellow color with a creamy head.  Not much in the way of its' weak hops aroma.  Weak and watery flavor of malts and hops that was dry, clean, and boring.  Nothing offensive, bit of hops at the end, but very flat, thin, and dull overall."
"Slight malt nose, very light gold color with a white head.  Slightly smooth maly mouth.  The taste is one of a solid malt presence.  It does not have alot of punch.. but it is balenced enough on the hops presence side. Great with cheese, olives, and bread."
"This is a better than average Pilsener, but it's nothing spectacular.  It has a decent white head that sticks to the side of the glass and a decent malt flavor.  If you're out for dinner and want something Italian, order some Barbaresco, Barolo, or Chianti.  The Italians do wine better than beer."
"Medium amber with small head. Slighty hoppy but with more malt sweetness.  Very fizzy.  Goes down fairly smooth."
"Malty with a definate hop edge. Slight fruit on the nose. Seems overly carbonated but not bad. Slightly sour with a light aftertaste. Rare in the states it seems."
"I agree with Todd, this is better with a meal than sipping alone.  Not outstanding, but overall a pleasant beer.  To me it almost has a slight melon flavor, leaning toward apple.  I wouldn't buy this at a store to take home, but if it's on the menu at the Italian place I'll order it."
"Notes: Not a bad beer at all. It lacks the crispness of say a Peroni, but is still quite enjoyable. It's also the Moretti's flagship beer. I'd pair this with a nice Italian dish vs. drinking it on it's own."
