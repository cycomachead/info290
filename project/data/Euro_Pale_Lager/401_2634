AROMA: biscuits and bread, with funky bad-breath elements forcing their way through the glass--a turn-off ... PALATE: mildly effervescent, oily, fizzy and long bitter, astringent ending ...TASTE: mildly sweet, with faint caramel; a pungent finish, with awkward, cloying unbalanced corn maltiness--were are the hops? ...OVERALL: the dark offered a malty character; this suggests the palest lager with enough malt to affirm its allegiance...","dacrza1","Feb 08, 2015"

A fairly plain tasting lager - not altogether bad, just nothing to make it stand out at all. Some malt, hops and water. Mouth feel is also kind of meh - very thin body.

One taste of this and I feel like I'm going to go live under a bridge. It's all fusel and DMS. I think my eyebrows are falling out. If I had this at a blind tasting I wouldnt've guessed it was beer.

The flavors were similar, dominated by the grains (mostly corn) with some sweet malt and herbal hops. I liked the bitter/sweet balance and it finished crisp.

I had this over dinner with a Russian friend and Russian food so the context added a lot to the enjoyment. All in all this is a slightly better macro lager that was thoroughly drinkable and a much better alternative to the average Australian swill that gets passed around here.

Usual Macro appearance. The aroma was weet and malty with malted corn, a touch of malted rice, a pinch of malted barley, and then finishes up sweet with sugar and yeast. The taste was crispy, sweet, and filled a ton of malted grains like corn, rice, and barley. There wasn't much after the grains. All I got was a slight bitter finish with some crispy floral hops. This was a light bodied Lager with a malty aftertaste of more malted grains. It was a very grainy beer. In the end, it's another run of the mill cheap lager beer filled with cheap malted grains.

Flavors of light malts prevail, later showing some corn flavors (dms), green apples (acetaldahyde), and soft herbal hops. The texture is moderate, but a bit slick and grainy in the texture. Light acidity (lemon-grass) show up intermittenly through the drink. Finishes with a blend of the light malts, grain flavors, and mild hops.

I ended up having to chug it in order to get my money's worth, but before I took that route, I detected a sort of artificial lemony taste, which I suspect is being used to cover for mediocre (or spoiled) ingredients.

Sort of a weak flavour, with some spicy hops and malt sweetness with a slightly dry, bitter finish. Refreshing and light, with more flavour than your standard macro lager.","DrJay","Aug 29, 2004"

3.17,6.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale malt scent with some Czech style hops and a dry lager yeast finish. The taste is average. It has a bland, yet slightly malty flavor with a sweet yet dry finish. It goes down easy, but it isn't as clean and crisp as a German lager. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average beer, nothing special. It has decent aroma that's all.","WesWes","Jul 29, 2004"

3.19,7,2.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"baltika #3 pours goldenrod color with light lacy head that was huge for about 30 seconds then almost competely dissapeared. smells of saaz hops dominate with a steely undertone. also some corn in there. taste is alright. more flavor than expected. strong with the saaz hops with rusty iron and corn almost echoing the aroma. mouthfeel is medium light with a lot of carbonation. overall not a bad beer. good for a hot day. there a better beers for less money but, a decent one to check out in a sixer.","ramrod666","Jul 25, 2004"

3.63,21.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Looking at the average score, no one seems to be vary impressed with this beer. I didn't think it was anything insanely good, but it's certainly on par with any european continental lager or pilsener. I did check the date on the bottle, whch was several months away, and pulled one of the bottles way in back on the shelf, so perhaps I got the best experience possible from a beer about halfway around the world. It's good, but with all the other choices with a nearly identical flavor profile, I doubt I'll buy this again.","UnionMade","Apr 07, 2004"
3.24,8.7,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Good thirst quenching beer. Baltika 3 pours a pale gold, with a small film of a head. Sparce strings of lace stay on the mug. Smells, whoa. The hops are pretty evident in this beer. Very citrusy smell. Also smelled is barley and corn. Tastes a little bland. I was expecting more hops from the smell, but malt and corn seems to dominate the taste of this beverage. Still good. Bit sweeter than expected. Crisp, slightly coarse mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable. A good session brew, hot weather brew or just wanna have a brew brew.","slitherySOB","Apr 04, 2004"
2.91,-2.3,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Taste, well, this beer brought hops to the table - nothing else to accompany or hide it either. It was a delicious bitter, but not very complex. I must commend it, however, for having a very long finish...stays on the tongue, goes the distance.","GuinnessSmurf","Mar 11, 2004"
2.62,-12.1,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"And yes, once again I have been disappointed by a lager which tasted different on the first intake and on the second one- the latter being more soury tasting and corny, but never exiting the locked doors of the mediocre. I hold hope for the baltika family though, and its porter nr. 6.","Andreji","Feb 28, 2004"
2.07,-30.5,2,2.5,2,1.5,2,"Appearance: Golden straw color of most macro brewed beer forms a tiny large bubbled head that dwindles very quickly does leave some lacing evenly rung thin and runny however. Aroma: Corn and hop burp aromatics this is a macroswill if I ever smelled one, only European style. Taste: Extremely dull and filled of adjuncts corn doesn't do it for me and a astringent European hop this is just blah. Mouthfeel: Carbonated water says it all. Drinkability: Pass on this one at least if it were their malt liquor I could say it has the alcoholic qualities.","WVbeergeek","Dec 23, 2003"

2.73,-8.4,3.5,3,2.5,2,3,"Baltika #3 poured a clear, golden, pale color with a very big, yet thin head. The carbonation eased up a bit, leaving a sudsy appearance. Some nice lacing was left on the side of the glass. The smell was a weak blend of fruity and hoppy characteristics, with faint grass odors. For a pilsner, it tasted relatively watered-down, retaining only a bit of the common crispness for the style. Clean and easy on the palate, this beer isn't bad, but is disappointingly medicore. The mouthfeel adds to this general malaise...very thin and unfilling. Still, #3 was drinkable, although cheap American macros would deliver the same thing for far less. Luckily, this was a gift from a friend (to whom I am thankful for grabbing this during a recent trip to New York). I won't go out of my way to find this one on my own, though.","SchmichaelJ","Sep 09, 2003"

3.26,9.4,4,3,3,3,4,"Pale clear yellow appearance, big 3/4 inch bright white and fluffy head that can be classified as rocky. Decent wandering drip laces. Aroma is faintly grassy with some honey on the side. Very sweet and scantly carbonated, again a floral honey combined with a sugar sweetened white bread presence. Hopping is limited at best, making me wonder how this meets a Pilsner classification -- but taken as a product this is decent ice cold, attractive. Not well-balanced or attenuated but very drinkable with a nice texture.","ADR","Aug 19, 2003"
3.45,15.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured straw-yellow in color. Nearly clear in opacity. White foamy head formed quickly, but quickly fell and relocated to the edges of the glass. Efervescense is quite noticeable. The smell is of hops and green apples. Hop bite is the predominant flavor, with just a bit of malt before a nice dry finish. Bit of the green apple flavor is present, but took me a while to place it. Overall, though, pretty tasty. The mouthfeel isn't impressive or anything, but the carbonation is there to make the tongue happy enough. Really hits the back of the tongue. A tasty brew, but not really that good of a pilsner.","jlervine","Jul 08, 2003"
3,0.7,3,3,3,3,3,"This is a standard lager. Everything about it is standard. Not good, not bad, just average. It sits rather yellow in the glass, with a large but fizzy head that is gone before you know it. No trace of lace in this glass. Smell? Hmm... Yeah, I guess there's a smell here. Reminds me of ballpark beer. Tastes about like that, too. Maybe a touch of rice - the label denies the presence of anything like that - with a bit of carbonation and just the tiniest hint of hops. If this were all I could drink, I'd still drink beer, but a lot less of it. Blah!","Globetrotter","May 22, 2003"
3.48,16.8,3,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,"A very light, almost straw colored lager that comes in a brown 16.9 ounce bottle with a foil covered cap. A very light, but dry and refreshing lager beer. Certainly better than the most popular domestic lagers sold in America. There's not much to this beer, but it on the dry side, and very clean tasting. If it were half as light it would be tonic water. At $1.38 a bottle it was a good buy for an import. I've had worse imported lagers for more money.","marcobrau","Apr 17, 2003"
2.26,-24.2,3,2,2,2,3,"The archetypal lager color a transpicuous golden yellow, the head portly in size, bright white in color, frothy in texture, the lace a thin covering sheet. Nose is crisp fresh and clean, all malt, start is lightly sweet and loaded with malt, top skinny in feel. Finish has a perky acidity, the hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste.","Gusler","Apr 08, 2003"
