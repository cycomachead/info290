The bottle was stored in the cooler at the Party Source, but I'm pretty sure it's nowhere close to being fresh at this point. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a half inch white head. The head went away quickly, and there isn't much lacing, either. Aroma is sweet and bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a weird bitter taste that I don't care for. Mouthfeel/body is light, and it's a bit slick. It's also smooth and goes down easy. For the style it's not a bad brew. Worth a try if you can get a single bottle of it like I did. I might have to try a fresher bottle of this in the future.","bluejacket74","May 27, 2011"

At first on the front it's very malty and tasty. After that it flattens out considerably and becomes very average.

Very drinkable - I could easily have another one or two of these, especially with the smaller bottle size. I originally picked it up just for the weird bottle but now that I've had it - I'm very glad I did have it and I'll have to get it again. A bit pricy since it's coming all the way from Estonia, but not a bad beer at all.

Clear golden straw color to the liquid, pale yet attractive, only sparse bubbles visible, not much difference towards the rims. Noticeably sweet nose of corn syrup, honey, cane sugar and potato bread, waft of orange citrus, rice and mixed grain, no real herbaceous character, highly innocuous. Medium-bodied, good solid bottom keeps it anchored in the palate, remains on the sweet side here too with that corn and other adjuncts, honey and caramel, the orange citrus pulp and sweet, notes of standard peach and apricot fruit. Moderate hay, meadow grasses, once more avoids any really herbal bite or overall bitterness. The carbonation is light but tight enough to help it finish with elevating dryness.

2.73,0.4,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"I admit it, I picked this beer up because of the unique bottle. That being said, it pours a clear jaundice topped by a cute finger of bright white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, light corn syrup, and miscellaneous vegetable matter (kinda like sniffing a used in-sink disposal after cleaning a salad bowl). The taste does away with the veggies (thankfully), leaving some watered-down corn syrup, wheat, rice, and a slightly metallic wannabe-bitterness. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. I've had many better from this particular Baltic state. Nice bottle, though.","TMoney2591","Jul 24, 2010"

2.91,7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"I was searching for Carolina beers at Chip's Wine and Beer in Kill Devil Hills, NC and found this. I figured I'd never has Estonian beer and gave it a shot. It's basically just another clean continental lager. The aroma has very mild vegetable off-notes, but otherwise it's a simple and refreshing beer. It's no big surprise, but Estonians can make a macro lager as well as any one else.","tempest","Jun 26, 2010"
2.35,-13.6,2,2,2.5,1.5,3,"Notes: Pretty much a typical mass produced, easy to drink, low on flavor kind of beer just in a neat looking bottle and from Estonia. Had a slightly off and metallic taste that wasn't necessarily good or bad, just different. Not really worth seeking out, unless you want to try a beer from Estonia or want the bottle.","FreshHawk","May 27, 2010"

2.93,7.7,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a clear golden color with a white, soda-like head that dissipated really quickly. The nose is mostly absent, but there is a faint grainy, buttery character way back there somewhere. There's not much in the way of flavor--that's probably the point--but there is a subtle hint of hay-like malt in the center, just past the subtle hint of sweetness at the front. It doesn't have much body; it drinks like water. Surprisingly, this comes in a 10oz bottle; one could drink gallons of this without any trouble! Drinkable? Heck yeah! Interesting? Heck no!","CWiggins","Apr 26, 2010"

2.13,-21.7,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"There are good Baltic lagers, but this isn't one. Rather than make a bad beer, they seem to have decided to make a completely insubstantial one. More drinkable, I guess, but why would you?","StJamesGate","Apr 06, 2010"
2,-26.5,2,2,2,2,2,"The best thing about this beer by far, is the bottle. There isn't anything really ""bad"" about the beer, unless, by bad you'd mean without any character. There are no foul characteristics, but there's not much flavor, aroma, or palate. The head is white and almost disappears quickly with no head. Color is a clear yellow. Aroma is faint world beer. Flavor is the same. Body isn't totally gone, but there isn't much. Hardly any finish. Forgettable except for the cool bottle.","drpimento","Mar 11, 2010"
2,-26.5,2,2,2,2,2,"Strange bottle, looks like something my grandmother would keep oil or flowers in, first beer ive had from estonia. Pours a very light pale yellow with very little head that is gone quickly. Smells like any other commercial light beer, very light grains.Nothing special about the flavor of this one, typical for this style, not much here. Very light body with no residual flavors to be talked about. Could pound these all day by the pool and get extremely bloated and unsatisfied.","brewbasterd","Mar 03, 2010"

2.33,-14.3,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"After seeing this beer in the local supermarket, I bought it solely for the unique eight-sided slender bottle. The beer itself is a clear golden color. Initially, it presents a bright fizzy head, but this is extremely short-lived, and the beer quickly retreats to flatness. The aroma is of a little malt and distant grains. Not much to impress. The taste is similar, with a sharp carbonic bite and a little metallic tin-ness. Light and uninteresting. The bottle is neat, but the beer inside is completely forgettable.","Suds","Nov 23, 2008"
