"Deep gold colour, 1/2 inch fizzy white head disappears quickly. No lace. Mild, vaguely beery aroma hints at fresh baked bread lightly buttered. Sweet, malty flavour with notes of white bread and light diacetyl. Light hop bitterness in the finish. Light-bodied with light carbonation for the style. Slick mouthfeel. This would be decent if it weren't for the diacetyl fault. As it is, this is not good beer. Take a pass on it."

"Pleasant flavours of straw and wheat, light on the palate with white bread malt. Very cautious but recognizable hop bitterness, lemon peel, with a metallic touch, due to the high carbonation, which gets especially recognizable as it comes to the aftertaste. Between gentle wheat flavor and slight hop bitterness, there is a whole lot of nothing, watery middlepart, not much going on the palate. A bit too incommunicative overall, even for a light-bodied beer."
"500 ml can with a production date stamp of September 9, 2014. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a transparent gold with a small and quickly dissipating head. Smell is not very noteworthy.  Tastes slightly malty but quite waterey and no remarkable taste at all.  Reminds me of a corona or other similar lagers. The feel is quite carbonated and no real finish to speak of. Overall a fairly low quality lager in my opinion."
"Horrible brew, came in a 1 liter can, over carbonated, but it disapeared fast and instead you are left with 8 DL of pure butter mixed with metal."

"Edit February 25 2014- had this the other day and there was a sulphur quality to the smell and the flavour that was very unpleasant. Don't know if this was a bad can or not and will reserve judgement but if this is the case the smell and taste ratings should be dropped by about 0.5 as this seriously detracts from an otherwise average EPL."

"O: Not a bad beer at all. Fairly generic and a pretty bad aroma but its okay and just that."

"Overall: Why bother with this? If this is your only choice for a beer, i really pity you."
""
""
"O: Drinkable beer. A good Lager, I would dare to say"
""
""
"Light and crisp, goes down easy. If you want a pretty boring lager, this will serve you quite well. Better than Heineken or whatever. I dunno, it's hard to review stuff like this. Cool can, though. Which is how I got here in the first place."
"I was kind of disappointed with this one."
"Final Grade: 3.26, a passable C+."

"O: Yet another boring Danish macro beer with a corny overdose."
"Overall – I'd say this is a slightly above average euro-lager. There is nothing offensive about it and its pretty drinkable. It's still not something I'd buy again however."
"Overall a good, slightly above average Euro Pale Lager. Likely won't get you excited, but won't disappoint."
"Pours a clear golden-yellow colour with thin white head. Smells grainy with almost a hint of hops. Flavour is quite sweet, only a faint hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Fairly big carbonation level, probably too high to make this really drinkable. Clean enough flavour, nothing off. Just an ok lager overall."
"Overall I don't think I will have this again. Taste isn't good and is quite bland. This is a beer to get you drunk, otherwise I don't see the point. 33.8 Ounce can is what got my attention with a cheap price. That should have been my warning sign there. Oh, well... at least a slight buzz has landed."
"I think half of all purchases of Faxe must owe to the novelty of the gigantic 1-liter can. It's a bit of a budget Heineken -- it reminds me of a Heineken copycat beer (whose name escapes me) that used to come in 12-packs. Anyway, Faxe is a little too light on the palate -- thin body and not a lot of flavor. That said, not a bad quaff when you are interested in volume at a decent price."
"Drinkability: I could probably nurse one of these for hours, and wouldn't refuse it for a second if offered under any circumstances. Quite nice overall."
"D: I got this as a gift. It came in a 1,000 ml can with a giant mug. It's very easy to drink but don't drink it if you're looking for something tasty. It's basically like a American macro beer but I think I might prefer this over most American macros."
"Moral of the story. Decent drinking beer. Have it with meat and potatoes. Can't go wrong."
"I doubt I'll be drinking this again, nothing special and odds are where ever you are you'll have better options"
"D: Overall this was a ho-hum experience that continued to get more tiresome and boring with every sip. A single serving would be a struggle and waste of time let along trying to consume the whole liter. I originally bought this as a joke with regards to the oversized can, I guess the joke ended up on me. Not worth the aluminum its packaged in. A big pass."
"3$ a liter isn't bad, it's not bad for the style either."
"Drinkability: What can I say? It's nothing special. It's got nothing to offend and nothing to write home about. I'd pick it over most other macros brews. The best part on this particular occasion was the 1L mug it came with."
"D: This is probably one of the best macros I have had. The malts come in and balance of the graininess with is nice. It's not that expensive and not terrible in taste. A good go to macro/inebriation beer."
"An barely-average European macro lager, rendered all the more unimpressive by the apparently additive-free nature of its ingredient list. Increasingly unpleasant as it warms, the dead-eyed sweetness of this one will haunt you for a while after the finish, I guarantee it."
"T- Slight pilsner taste, but very smooth. Far better than an American Macro Lager. Slight bitter aftertaste. Very solid, even if nothing is spectacular."
"D - It's drinkable but it's just an average brew that I'll occasionally enjoy."
"Overall-not great, not terrible, wouldn't go out of my way to get it but wouldn't refuse."
"Overall, nothing premium, more like very average."
"Drinkability - not bad but nothing special, in my opinion. Not a really memorable brew, but I wouldn't outright refuse it if offered."
"Drinkability : a not impressed beer in the style Pale Lager."
"The can is damned fun though."
"My pour formed a finger's worth of bubbly bone-white head with low retention. The nose had the ever-present lager-sweetness, leaving no doubt as to what I was drinking. The color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a slightly metallic taste on the tongue. The finish had a lager sweetness, but I still caught that metallic taste on the extreme finish. Oof."
"I tried this beer on June 11, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer pours a translucent dark gold with some reddish hues. The head started out as loose and bubbly before quickly receding to a thin ring. The aroma was very grassy with nothing else notably present. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, medium carbonated. The flavour was primarily grainy malt with a little peppery spiciness on the tip of the tongue."
"Drinkability- I dont really recommend this beer other than to give it a try."
"belle couleur blonde-dorée très claire, la mousse est blanche et passablement durable. nez malté peu prononcé, pas de houblon au nez, la bouche est très rafraichissante, vers le malt, un peu métallique ce qui ne l'avantage pas. très ordinaire"
"D:	A below standard macro lager - easy to put down, but not particularly enjoyable. I wont be buying this one again."
"Overall an ideal beer for quenching your thirst, but not a world beater in excitment or inovational brewing."
"Drinkability: If I was a Viking, I would consider it a slap in the face if one my kind was on this beer label. To me, a Viking is suppose to be a fierce fighting machine, but this beer is the complete opposite, weak and light. Basically, I found this beer is just another cheap macro to get Biltzed on. There's nothing interesting about this beer, except that it came in a 1 Liter can. That's it! There's no way I would touch this stuff again."
"Exp 05/09/08. Pale yellow, clear and see through. Big white head initially, carbonation was just barely there but it stayed throughout. Minimal lacing as the glass emptied, second pour brought quite a bit back. Smells a bit skunky but not offensive, wet grass / damp basement. The taste is bitter, mildly hoppy, with a bit of malt in the background to smooth it over. There is a thin body and dry mouthfeel. This is quaffable enough although a little gassy. Overall, pretty standard fare and true to the style; not the best example of its type but certainly not the worst either."
"Overall an unimpressive Euro Lager. Many better out there. The one liter can was pretty cool though."
"From a one-liter can, this is a decent and drinkable lager. It presents a nice floral hop aroma and a restrained but genuinely pleasant malt backdrop. It's a clear, golden-yellow color, and the head is tall and firm. The beer is clean and straightforward. It's also satisfying, which is a lot more than can be said for other european lagers. The finish has a little hop bitterness, but could have carried a little more flavor. It's an okay brew...also, the can is perfect for a one liter mug."
"A nice deep chapagne color and beige head top off this beer, as the large frothy head settles into a constant 3 finger state. The aroma of the beer hints of fruits and hops, and the taste is of mostly malty but also some hoppy notes. The 5% ABV is barely noticeable behind this as it is drinkable. The only problem is there is no backbone in the beer, there is taste on the front end of it, but barely any on the back end. An average beer at best imo, nothing to go out of your way for."
"A decent euro lager..one that is easy to drink and might be killer on tap. Would certainly be a good entry beer for someone unfamilar with Euro lagers ( ie. Molson Canadian Drinker)"
"Not bad at all for the style. I was pleasantly surprised. Sure beats many other Euro-lagers as far as taste...would make a nice summer ""no brainer but tasty enough"" refresher..Good enough to wonder if this comes in a keg for a summer barbecue..."
"Brilliant pale yellow with a big frothy white head that quickly diminishes. The smell is a pleasant sweet, grainy, malt with a hint of floral hops. This Faxe Danish Lager, out of the 1L can, is light bodied and has a low carbonation that gives it a smooth mouthfeel. The taste is light and balances the dominant pale malt with a very, very slightly bitter/mettalic finish. Overall a beer that is easy to drink and surprisingly light tasting for a 5.5 ABV."
"Clean, well-brewed, Euro lager. Nice golden color. Average head retention. Floral and herbal hops in the nose with a touch of grainy malt. Nice, lightly sweet, just slightly tart malt base (because of pH from yeast and fermentation - not infection). Solid bitterness. Really nice balance. Clean, drinkable, refreshing. And, OK, the big-assed can is kind of cool!"
"Needless to say, I up ended the huge can into the sink and looked for something else in the fridge."
"Taste is not unpleasant, the same juicy sweetness is in evidence, apples, pears. Slightly nutty malt backbone with a citric acidity. Nothing mindblowing here, mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, but isn't overcarbonated. Nice alcohol warmth on the way down, but the thinner body really makes this a chugger. I guess if I had a lawn I'd call this a lawnmower beer."
"Sampled on a hot summer day, which was in its favour! Dull yellow in appearence, no real head. No aroma (probably a good thing!) Light hops with underlying malt in the flavour. Carbonation was at a good level but flavour was flat. Clearly macro. Decent quencher, could never be much more. I cant say I didn't enjoy it, it was fair enough, but I wouldn't recommend buying unless to cook with it."
"best part is the Viking on the can"
"D - Looks good. Feels good. But I can't get past the taste. The remainder of this beer wound up in a pile of gravel as soon as I got through the rating. I give it 1/2 point extra for luring me into tasting it."
"A nice Euro Pale. Pours out to a medium golden orange color with a short livedwhite foam head. No lace. Medium to medium low levels of carbonation. Aromas of buttery malts and sweet fermented grain dominate, with traces of biscuits and yeast. Taste is enjoyable; mildy buttery malts, raw grain, sweet bread and light rye, with a touch of light smoke. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a touch of bubbliness on the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd have this again. Worth a try."
"Ah, faxe. Had this a few years ago while in Denmark digging up dead Vikings... I feel the same way about it now as I did then. It's okay enough looking, golden with some head. Smell is practically non-existent. A bit of sweetness, but you have to sniff really, really hard. Taste is watery- in fact, it tastes like water with a shot of beer in it. Barely hoppy, barely tasty. Mouthfeel is watery and thin. I could certainly keep drinking this- yes, the litre- if it was kept cold, and it does have some interesting Danish memories attached, but I will not be going after this again any time soon. Still, a litre that doesn't taste like crap and is cheap- college kids, get this instead of Bud."
"Unexciting, uninteresting... just big and kinda cheap. Frat boys are likely to be all over this stuff."
"Canned sample. Gold in colour with strong carbonation. Light malt aromas with a very mild of a floral note. Some grainy sweetness in the mouth, with some chemical astringency. A bit more full bodied than others of this style. Poor ""dirty water"" kind of finish. Overall, it smells better than it tastes. Not recommended"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Surprisingly good texture, but to no avail... this beer can not be saved from the depths of my kitchen sink's drain. The most offensive beer I have yet to review."
"Pale beer with faint aroma. Produces fluffy unstable head. Taste is thin, sweetish with obviously no character. Malts are present, hops are absent. Finish is bitter-sour. Cheap beer designed for mass consummation at all kind of fests and other big gatherings. Other Ceres products are much more interesting."
"D - Surprisingly ok. exceeded my expectations after the extra strong (10%..blech)"
"This is worth a try if you like Euro Lagers, otherwise it doesnt offer much. Too watery and DMS is present."
"The bottom line is: Why would I pay premium import price to drink this when I can enjoy a domestic macro like Molson Canadian for less money?"
"Overall it's an okay, not to heavy and not overly light. It's very similar to Castle Lager in terms of aftertaste."
"Nothing really special here. Fairly run of the mill, but it just has a couple of qualities in each area that turns me off slightly so that it doesn't get average marks, even though it's a thoroughly average euro pale lager."
"Pours a clear amber/gold, fluffy white head forms, laces well and has good retention. Smell is sweet and malty, honey, citrus, some floral hops, quite pleasant. Taste is sweet and malty, lots of citrus and floral, mild bitterness in the fnish. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thick, medium bodied with medium to low carbonation. Not bad at all."
"The taste is an open lager palate with banana tones initially followed by a not as nice metallic touch to the tongue. Still, this is not some sloppy Euro lager with no self respect. Some discipline here in the crafting keeps this to decent levels of drinkability. A bit of tartness or clove keeps the house in order and this is drinkable stuff, although downing a full litre can will take a little while. Better than I expected, if not a real superstar."
"Features a pure white head sitting atop clear golden-yellow liquid. Gentle carbonation. Pleasant nose with aromas of grassy and lemony maltiness, sharp hoppiness. The taste is bittersweet with a great balance malt-to-hop, and a nice long bright hop finish with just a slight adjunct note...but not strong enough to distract from the enjoyability."
"Fairly easy to drink to the lightness fo the brew, but still slightly overcarbonated for my taste. You could easily polish off three or four of these, before it begins to burn the back of your throat."
"Can: Poured a bright golden color lager with a medium lightly foamy white head with better then average retention. Aroma of light floral malt is quite evident. Taste is refreshing with a nice dose of malt but sadly lacking hops resulting in a thin watery finish. Overall, this is just a slightly above average premium lager."
"A bit fizzy going down, but I find most lagers are. Easy to drink, a good session beer. Best served cold."
"Poured a clear greenish gold under a thin one-finger white head that faded faster than water freezes in Moscow in early January. There's a bit of malt in the nose, plus a touch of sweet fruitiness. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste? Well, there isn't much. A bit like rusty pipes, with a note of sweet malt. There's a touch of hops in the finish, but hardly worth noting. This isn't a drain pour, but it sure won't be followed by another of its ilk."
"I found this beer about average, maybe a little higher than average for a lager. I believe a lover of Coors, Miller or Bud would adore this beer. I am not a huge fan of lager but I will probably pull one from the fridge and have a big cold one following a hot day under the summer sun."
"Came in a 500ml can with a freshness date stamped on the bottom. Pours out a nice clear golden hue, with a bit of a head that immediately fizzles out like a spent firecracker. Not much of a nose to detect. Taste is of grainy sweet malt, hops are oh so faint, as if they're hiding. It goes down smooth though. An uninspiring lager, but it's drinkable."
"A malty smell without any trace of hop bitterness. A very bland taste and relatively low in carbonation for a lager. The taste is also a little too sweet. Below average."
"Everything about this lager is average and I can appreciate that."
"Flavorful Lager from Denmark.  Worthy of an above average rating for a lager.  Tasty and refreshing, with no objectionable after tastes or smells.  If your belly (or wife) permits, you can easily drink massive quantities of this."
