Very cautious but recognizable hop bitterness, lemon peel, with a metallic touch, due to the high carbonation, which gets especially recognizable as it comes to the aftertaste. Between gentle wheat flavor and slight hop bitterness, there is a whole lot of nothing, watery middlepart, not much going on the palate. A bit too incommunicative overall, even for a light-bodied beer.","aleigator","Dec 18, 2014"

The taste is bitter, mildly hoppy, with a bit of malt in the background to smooth it over. There is a thin body and dry mouthfeel. This is quaffable enough although a little gassy.

Mouthfeel is watery and thin. I could certainly keep drinking this- yes, the litre- if it was kept cold, and it does have some interesting Danish memories attached, but I will not be going after this again any time soon.

1.55,-45.2,4,1.5,1,3.5,1,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Surprisingly good texture, but to no avail... this beer can not be saved from the depths of my kitchen sink's drain. The most offensive beer I have yet to review.","yelterdow","May 30, 2006"
2.21,-21.9,3,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Pale beer with faint aroma. Produces fluffy unstable head. Taste is thin, sweetish with obviously no character. Malts are present, hops are absent. Finish is bitter-sour. Cheap beer designed for mass consummation at all kind of fests and other big gatherings. Other Ceres products are much more interesting.","ernie","May 28, 2006"

2.98,5.3,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"This is worth a try if you like Euro Lagers, otherwise it doesnt offer much. Too watery and DMS is present.","CAMRAhardliner","Apr 04, 2006"
2.76,-2.5,3,2,3,3,3,"The bottom line is: Why would I pay premium import price to drink this when I can enjoy a domestic macro like Molson Canadian for less money?","vanrassel","Mar 04, 2006"
3.32,17.3,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it's an okay, not to heavy and not overly light. It's very similar to Castle Lager in terms of aftertaste.","CrazyMike","Feb 09, 2006"
2.6,-8.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Nothing really special here. Fairly run of the mill, but it just has a couple of qualities in each area that turns me off slightly so that it doesn't get average marks, even though it's a thoroughly average euro pale lager.","Noxious26","Nov 19, 2005"
3.65,29,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear amber/gold, fluffy white head forms, laces well and has good retention. Smell is sweet and malty, honey, citrus, some floral hops, quite pleasant. Taste is sweet and malty, lots of citrus and floral, mild bitterness in the fnish. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thick, medium bodied with medium to low carbonation. Not bad at all.","Viggo","Sep 11, 2005"
3.72,31.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The taste is an open lager palate with banana tones initially followed by a not as nice metallic touch to the tongue. Still, this is not some sloppy Euro lager with no self respect. Some discipline here in the crafting keeps this to decent levels of drinkability. A bit of tartness or clove keeps the house in order and this is drinkable stuff, although downing a full litre can will take a little while. Better than I expected, if not a real superstar.","daliandragon","Jul 29, 2005"
3.58,26.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Features a pure white head sitting atop clear golden-yellow liquid. Gentle carbonation. Pleasant nose with aromas of grassy and lemony maltiness, sharp hoppiness. The taste is bittersweet with a great balance malt-to-hop, and a nice long bright hop finish with just a slight adjunct note...but not strong enough to distract from the enjoyability.","beerluvr","Jul 21, 2005"
3.18,12.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Fairly easy to drink to the lightness fo the brew, but still slightly overcarbonated for my taste. You could easily polish off three or four of these, before it begins to burn the back of your throat.","Bestuurder","Mar 24, 2005"
2.13,-24.7,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Can: Poured a bright golden color lager with a medium lightly foamy white head with better then average retention. Aroma of light floral malt is quite evident. Taste is refreshing with a nice dose of malt but sadly lacking hops resulting in a thin watery finish. Overall, this is just a slightly above average premium lager.","Phyl21ca","Jan 09, 2004"
3.55,25.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"A bit fizzy going down, but I find most lagers are. Easy to drink, a good session beer. Best served cold.","BDTyre","Jan 06, 2004"
2.5,-11.7,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Poured a clear greenish gold under a thin one-finger white head that faded faster than water freezes in Moscow in early January. There's a bit of malt in the nose, plus a touch of sweet fruitiness. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste? Well, there isn't much. A bit like rusty pipes, with a note of sweet malt. There's a touch of hops in the finish, but hardly worth noting. This isn't a drain pour, but it sure won't be followed by another of its ilk.","Globetrotter","May 29, 2003"
3.18,12.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"I found this beer about average, maybe a little higher than average for a lager. I believe a lover of Coors, Miller or Bud would adore this beer. I am not a huge fan of lager but I will probably pull one from the fridge and have a big cold one following a hot day under the summer sun.","Sheldon","Feb 22, 2003"
2.84,0.4,3.5,2,3,3.5,3,"Came in a 500ml can with a freshness date stamped on the bottom. Pours out a nice clear golden hue, with a bit of a head that immediately fizzles out like a spent firecracker. Not much of a nose to detect. Taste is of grainy sweet malt, hops are oh so faint, as if they're hiding. It goes down smooth though. An uninspiring lager, but it's drinkable.","IronDjinn","Beers"
2.68,-5.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"A malty smell without any trace of hop bitterness. A very bland taste and relatively low in carbonation for a lager. The taste is also a little too sweet. Below average.","SaunaKing","0"

3.7,30.7,3,3,4,4,4,"Flavorful Lager from Denmark.  Worthy of an above average rating for a lager.  Tasty and refreshing, with no objectionable after tastes or smells.  If your belly (or wife) permits, you can easily drink massive quantities of this.","stoutman","0"
