Once you get past the initial assault, this beer disappears in a hurry and leaves a barely noticeable hop trace.

Flavour is similar but quite thin, leaving very for the otherwise dry finish. Some sweet malts come through in the middle with notes of apple and some subtle citrus. Thin on the palette...not too much going on here.

Tells me their lager yeast strain isn't that awesome, it doesn't get the nose. However, this is a very clean brew with an exceptional mouthfeel that goes down very easily. Not a champion brew, but it sure is getting trashed by reviewers. I'm pretty critical of bad beers but this is certainly no adjunct crap, it's just not that amazing either.

This was shaping up to be less than average, and the taste, not a strong as Ballantine, not as sharp as Heineken, certainally better than BMC beers, but it was just another yellow, fizzy beer with an import price that didn't meet even the minimum that would make me buy this again.
