In that case its time to switch to something else because the whole batch is bad, and every Harbin in the bar will taste the same.

Head falls off to a white ring fairly quickly. Laces fast and wetly. Smells of rice, malt, ethanol, vague apple-y esters. Flavor is reasonably clean up front, with an apple tang that grows. Sour ethanol is a bit much, making the drinking experience reminiscent of a malt liquor. Thin bodied.

It has a smooth pale malt and adjunct flavor. It goes down easy and finishes clean with a bit of malt sweetness. It's dry with a slight green bottle skunkiness, but nothing too off putting. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good Asian lager.

In all I would say this beer is very drinkable and certainly worth a try. I would recommend spending too much time looking for it because youll be disappointed but if you come across one go for it.

2.31,-18.1,3,2,2.5,2.5,2,"Well, it came in a pretty little sake'-like bottle. At least that was my justification for buying the beer. Afterwhich, I realized that this was not a good beer. Green bottle Euro-type beers almost always promise disaster. The offset of aromas give a tom-catty aroma; pungent and musky; nearly skunked. The look is a near-fizzy carbonation, disapointing retention, but hey; it has a clear straw color. The taste was of grain, rice, and malt. Very sweet, similar to raw corn sugar. Very little complexity or variety. The feel is a slick coating of the mouth. Finishes with a mild hop flavor, earthiness, and pronounced sweetness. The beer was just not that good.","BEERchitect","Jan 24, 2007"

This "Euro Pale Lager" pours a lighter apple juice with a quickly fading perfectly white foamy head. Smelled a bit skunky, common for me when comparing the nose's on a lot of European Lagers. Taste was fairly clean, though there was subtle skunky bitterness that thankfully didn't translate into the finish. This light bodied lager would indeed pair well with spicy Chinese fair though, lending it's thirst quenching abilities when you need it most....Enjoy","Greenfloyd","Jan 21, 2007"

Fairly inoffensive aroma, with soapy, dank, skunky hops in that Heineken way. Some corny notes, with crispy pils malt. The flavor is altogether mild, reminding me of a Bud clone. Funny, as I'd drank half of this before sitting down to type a review, and saw they were affiliated with AB. Mild, semi-watery malt fading off into a lightly hopped, floral/soapy finish. Some mineral water notes, leaving off very dry and vacant. There is a nice crispness to the carbonation, and the body is light and easy. It basically tastes like Bud with much fancier packaging. On closer inspection, i even see they have the horse-drawn beer cart above the brand name. The packaging's really what grabbed me. Amazing how appearance will sway the consumer, even an educated one, huh? I didn't dislike this one, but it doesn't bring anything to the table in terms of flavor. You never know. It could have been great. Stranger things have happened when I pop open unfamiliar beers. I'd rather have a Tsingtao if I'm going the chinese route.","UnionMade","Nov 30, 2006"
