Maybe some underlying fruity quality.  Overall, not much to it.  Taste seems a little watered down.  Mainly malty with a small amount of spicy bitterness at the end.  Somewhat tropical fruity aftertaste.  Not bad but not very complex.  Could drink a six pack if there wasn't a better selection, but wouldn't seek it out.","jngrizzaffi","Monday at 03:14 PM"

3.35,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Harp has always had a soft spot in my heart. It is reminiscent of booze soaked trips to the Barley Mill in Calgary in the mid 90's. I called the trip a "Millgramige" because it allowed me to literally soak in several beers that weren't available in my hometown at that time. Harp was then, and is now, a solid Euro lager. It lacks the skunk of many of its green bottle brethren. Instead, Harp has a nice dry malt/hop character. It is eminently quaffable and remains a solid St. Patty's alternative to Guinness.","Bunman3","Mar 15, 2015"

3.69,14.6,,,,,,"Overall (3.69) : A good lager representative of the style in spades. I was expecting some Irish weirdness but instead I got a pleasant beer that was both drinkable and enjoyable. Only gripe I have is the piney citrus bitter that's plaguing the drink. It is however reminiscent of a more pleasurable IPA. But since I don't like IPA's in general I'd say, remove that and it's bliss. This was a pleasant experience.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 30, 2014"

Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip but settles back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of some grains, yeast with a hint of lemon. The taste is actually better than I expected with the grains, yeast coming together nicely with a hint of corn sweetness. Maybe a very light taste of citrus mixed in there also. Well balanced with perfect carbonation. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Really liked this one.","BeerWithMike","Apr 05, 2014"

I'm no big fan of the smell of this brew. The taste is smooth with a little bit at the end. There is nothing bad about this brew taste. Overall I'm impressed on how smooth this beer is, but the smell is not something to be desired. I may get this brew again if I have the chance too.

Nose is light grain sweetness and fresh cut hay. A bit of floral but not too much and maybe a small whisper of the lemon peel. Sweet grains make up most of the palate and the hops offer a gentle bit of sweet grass. Some tart and weak lemon in the background. Drinks crisp and clean with a bit of bite on the tongue from carbonation and nice drying to the finish.","utopiajane","Mar 12, 2014"

3.58,11.2,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"So Harp ... Guinness' paler and perhaps classier little brother. On tap this beer pours a moderately gold honey amber with white head. Aroma is fairly toasty, mellow, with a hint of sweet fermented honey and fruit. Interesting. Taste is the expected grainy sour malt and green grass, but there is more subtle character as well: Some cidery apple, nutty malts, sour rhubarb and almost a tobacco sweetness with more sour fruit and wintergreen notes on the finish, which is crisp and bitter. Overall effect is more "deep and dark" than other pale Euros. There are flaws (a touch of skunk, a bit of metal, some acrid booze) but these are muted and fortunately take a backseat. Could be the Irish king of the European macrobeers and good for more than Black and Tans.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 12, 2013"

Looks great in a glass, and even pours beautifully out of a bottle. Definitely has a sweetness to it, very palatable to the average drinker. That all being said, there is certainly nothing that stands out about it. A reliable brew for a hot day, or if you're in the mood for something that is slightly different than your average American lager.","mschram72","Sep 26, 2013"

I also still enjoy a harp lager from time to time, a little more hearty than some of the American lagers, and certainly more flavorful than the BMC stuff. it pours a glazed copper tinted color, darker than convention, with a short lived white head. the nose is pale euro malts all the way, not sweet but dry, a little adjunct metallic hint, but nothing offensive at all. the taste is bready and grain heavy, I taste a number of different malts. hops? no so much. this beer could use a more aggressive finishing hop, but that's just me. I like all the malt heft without much sweetness, a nice twist away from the generic. fuller body for the style but still easy drinking, especially on a hot day. good carbonation and a flavorful finish. I bet this is remarkable at the original source, and it doesn't travel too bad really...","StonedTrippin","Jul 21, 2013"

2.1,-34.8,1.5,1.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,"Pours a pale yellow with a fluffy head. Bubbles rising constantly from the bottom of the glass tells me this is probably going to be far too carbonated. The aroma is somewhat that of a typical American lager, but Harp has a bready, yeasty note that tells me there’s something more there. There is also a floral aroma from the hops. The taste is slightly sweet with a faint bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is definitely overcarbonated, yet creamy with more body and less dryness than most beers of this style. You’d expect a beer so lacking in flavor would be thin and watery, but not so with Harp Lager. Overall, this isn’t a bad beer, there’s just not enough flavor to satisfy my palate. I should note that the flavor has become a little stronger since it’s warmed, but only a little. Personally, I’m not one to choose beer when I’m hot and thirsty, (there's water for that) but I suppose Harp could hit the spot on a Summer day. Certainly, there are hundreds of worse choices.","kvnstfrd","Apr 21, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, and some plastic-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a weird plastic-like, chemical flavor on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Very refreshing and as I've just finished a bike ride, just what I wanted. Very balanced, not as "macro light" tasting as I anticipated. I'm not sure what that taste is but then again I am. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, slightly carbonated and generally not noticeable unless I'm reviewing. Overall, not bad. Refreshing when its cold and you're hot, I feel it probably goes downhill from there.","roblowther","Mar 25, 2012"

Basically this is the Guinness' version of mainstream lagers probably with enough artificially jacked up carbonation to appear a step up.","MoreThanWine","Jul 09, 2011"
3.11,-3.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a solid straw yellow with a 2 finger head that turns to a lace quick with some good retention. A Earthy, grainy, sweet malt, and faint citrus. Grainy maltiness on the tongue, sour, lemon soap bitter on the finish. Light in the mouth, crisp, enjoyable aftertaste, light bodied. Overall, this beer is decent, its got its sense of drinkability.

2.68,-16.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"O: Have not had this beer in a few years, and I haven't been missing much. Pretty standard mass produced lager. Decent ice cold on a hot day, but drink it quickly, since there is not much to savor. When I visited Ireland in late February last year, this beer was not as prevalent as I had expected it to be.

When I pored it into the pint glass it was a little on the pale side for my taste and the smell was a tiny bit weak. The taste was very distinct and very tasty.

Saying this beer lacks in flavor is a insult, I think its just a plain lager. Although its plain it makes up in the drinkability. You can drink tons of these making it a great beer. The smell and appearance is great, and the mouthfeel is okay, but overall this is a fantastic beer. I don't think its a recipe that can even come close to half of the reputation that Guinness has made for itself. Pick some up you won't be disappointed.

Faint aroma of vaguely grainy maltiness with a thin whiff of Noble hops. Tastes of light pale malts with an equally light cereal sweetness and touch of grain. Expect no more than a hint of floral, spicy hops and bitterness, which remains for the drying finish. Light-bodied; medium carbonation. A tad watery. An enjoyable cheap pale lager at an Irish pub.","CuriousMonk","Jan 31, 2011"

3.13,-2.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured from the bottle, cold, into the pint glass, this is a crystal clear pale gold color with a fair white fuzz cap and a bit of lacing to go with it. The aroma is simple wheat with tangy yeast, not overpowering, not wonderful, but fine for a lager. The first taste brings a slight citrus hop bread deal. Although it has a nice effervescence and a dry hoppy finish, the feel is a bit watery. The lemony hop dominates the front of your tongue to the finish but it leaves a more metalic quality at the back of your mouth, even though this one was from a bottle. The hop bite doesn't have much flavor characteristic and the basic bread idea gets lost in a wimpy feeling liquid. It's certainly drinkable enough, like most lagers but it leaves a bit of a rancid aftertaste, like green compost, though that's being overly dramatic. Before I discovered better beer and bigger beers, I always though Harp was a reasonable brew, but I would say that may be a little generous these days.

No skunk. Mouthfeel is clean and well carbonated. Light bodied. Taste is unassuming, with spicy hop bitterness and grainy, biscuity malts.

Finishes dry with a small amount of bitterness.Thinnish body feel and low carbonation which makes for easy drinkin - if you must, indulgde, cuz this stuff is found nearly everywhere and is a better option then most marcos and micros that may be served at smaller bars and restaurants.","tavernjef","Jul 14, 2003"

I have had this beer before and remember enjoying it, but like a lot of beers, I find while reviewing them I just don't feel the same way.

3.26,1.2,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Amber lager pours with a fairly large head that displays good retention. As it falls apart into large bubbles of faom, it leaves a bit of clinging pseudo-lace at the top of the pint glass. Large carbonation bubbles are visible at the bottom of the glass. The aroma is the traditional "beer" smell, with some added hops spice. Perhaps just a hint of staleness is evident. Not skunky, but just a little too earthy. The taste is rather clean, but it does not taste like an all-malt brew. (Are there adjuncts in this beer?) A little bit of sweetness and some earthy huskiness appear, as well as a lingering peppered hop note on the finish. The mouthfeel is better than many lagers, but not great. The drinkability seems good, also better than many lagers. As I've noted before, I'm not a huge fan of traditional lagers, but this one isn't bad.

Nice finish with residual grain/malt aftertaste. It is not skunky or garbagy either. A good solid brew that simply tastes good. No intense hoppiness or maltiness. Just a nice crisp generic lager. The beer ie tried was contract brewed in Canada for Guinness, but no discernable "canalager" character evident.

What is the point of marketing Harp as an Irish beer if it is an imitation of American lagers and brewed in Canada?  2. When I drank this back in the mid and late 80's, my impression was that it was far more like Sam Adams than it was to Bud. That is definitely not the case now.

There's not much more going on in aroma than typical for style-- a bit of floral and herbal Hersbrucker noble hop nose and mellow, w/ light bready grain.  The relatively low hop bitterness and flavor along with a lack of prominent malt profile render this beer a bit bland, but considering it's more or less an American style lager, there's more going on here flavor and aromawise for style.
