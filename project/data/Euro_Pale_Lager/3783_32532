It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises musty wheat, light flowers, very light brown grass, and a faint hint of the beginning of skunking. I have no idea why, as the store in question isn't conducive to daylight entering the store to any appreciable degree, much less the beer section near the back wall, but at least the skunking seems to be at a decided minimum. The taste brings in more of the same, with the mustiness in full force, stronger than ever, providing evidence that the skunk-like smell wasn't actually evidence of skunking, but rather a crappy beer. Hell, the finish is awash in soil-encrusted tobacco. This is awful. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, what I thought was a case of light-taint turned out to just be a horrid beer. Well, at least I don't have to have a talk with the beer manager, and, better, I don't have to drink any more of this swill wannabe.","TMoney2591","Apr 21, 2013"

This one, Lech seemed curious to me, being a Polish beer, it aroused my curiosity, because I have had some decent Polish beers the last few weeks. This beer is amazingly drinkable, but lacks a nice head, and lacing. The head is a egg foam like appearance which is nothing to scream about. The beer is colored with a pale golden hue with transparent waterline edges. Also, while it maybe very versatile, it tastes of a watered down lager, similar to a crappy Pilsner, (not that I hate Pilsners of course) but a little better. However, it still sells very well in our store, for probably two reasons, one being that it is a Polish Beer, and that our Polish clientele will naturally go for it, and two being that most Americans prefer light lagers, or Pilsners anyway, so when they experiment on a unknown beer they obviously get something they think they would like. Overall, this beer was ok, not great, very drinkable, and makes a good addition to any beer selection.","StevenBilodeau","Jan 07, 2010"

2.06,-31.6,3,2,2,2,2,"Not one of my favorite beers. I bought it because I was told Polish delis in my area cannot keep it on the shelf. Tyskie is much better. Whoever is buying it up can have my share.","junkman203","Jul 01, 2008"
2.39,-20.6,3,1.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Drinkability: In fairness, it was drinkable, just nothing special. Actually left me with a little stale aftertaste that could only be abated by another drink.","Haybeerman","Jun 25, 2008"

3.25,8,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Poured a pale yellow, pretty transparent, but with a decent head that disappeared soon after. Smelled like an indescript lager but with added stale sweetness. Sweetness becomes much more apparent in the taste, overcoming any corny adjuncts or sharp edges. Slight hop bitterness - not much to speak of. moderate carbonation. fairly watery, making for weaker characteristics but higher drinkability. Almost like a light bock, if I may be so bold. The only english words on the can are "premium" and "party," so I didn't really know what to expect. However, this beer significantly surpasses the standard american shitty macro lager in taste and drinkability. So drink on, lager loving party people.","redmagik99","Nov 30, 2007"
3,-0.3,3,3,3,3,3,"This had an almost clear golden color with about 2in white head. This had a very light aroma, almost musty. It had a smooth taste, was light in the mouth with medium carbonation. There was a slight hop after taste but very unimpressive. Not too much else to add. I was able to drink 4 or 5 pints before going to my room, so it was drinkable.","WJVII","Oct 10, 2007"
3.18,5.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Taste is fairly clean but a bit unexciting. Grassy hops, wet earth, crackery malty sweetness with just a hint of alcohol in the finish. Medium dry mouthfeel, medium body, and well executed carbonation. This a decent, inoffensive Euro Lager, not too sweet or cheap tasting, a good thirst-quencher.","trevorwideman","Sep 16, 2007"
2.24,-25.6,3.5,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Had big notes of fusel alcohol that one would expect to have in a malt liquor, big notes of corn on the palate and in the nose. One could do better by visiting or revisiting other Polish beers and I thought a better name for this beer would be Belch !","hoser","Jul 23, 2007"

3.15,4.7,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Looks like a pale lager, clear yellow/gold, thick white head forms, starts to disappear rather quick, some lace spots. Smell is sweet, lagery, some citrus and floral, bit of corn, nothing special. Taste is sweet, little bit malty, light honey, floral, average at best, quite weak. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Moderately refreshing, carbonation is lighter than average, easier to drink. Still pretty crappy though!","Viggo","Feb 03, 2007"
3.65,21.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Crystal clear pale gold. A large bubble floats up now and then. Initially, the head was puffy and white, settling down into a thin collar after a couple sips. Soapy, saazy hop aroma. Some grassy notes, and crispy, crackly pils malt. The flavor is much like any continental lager, with perhaps a more pronounced floral fruitiness. A trace of apple and freshly mown grass, sitting atop crisply grainy pils malt. Lagery smooth, moving quickly into a moderately hopped, floral and soapy finish. Feels softer, less dry than your average euro lager, maybe more in the bohemian style. Still has that nice snap-off in the finish. An easy drinker after a long day.","UnionMade","Oct 12, 2006"
4.13,37.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4" white head above the clear light golden brew. Frothy head fades slowly, with ample sticky lacing. Aroma is Saaz hops with a light sweetness. Taste is pale sweet malts upfront, with crisp and lightly spicy hoppiness, with a clean close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice, this one is a great representation of the style. Would gladly have this one up again.","ppoitras","Sep 13, 2006"
3.71,23.3,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Overall a good feel about it, I am not a big Pilsner/lager drinker, but this did enough to please me and I will be drinking it again, not regular, but if it is hot, I am thirsty and it is cold in my fridge.","BlackHaddock","Aug 29, 2006"
