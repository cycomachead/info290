"The taste is a pretty straight forward corny, grainy, ale malt character with a clean hop finish. But it did not enthrall me all that much. Nothing unique or individual. I'll have some burgers with this. That much I can defend."
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
"Not that great. Feels like a cheaper Peroni knock off."

"Poor lager beer without aroma!"
"This beer is very light in color, the smell is grassy and lightly malty. very light bodied, with a sweet and grassy predominant taste. I don't think is too bad it just plain and water down lager."

"Overall: this beer is pretty much akin to Amsterdam and Oettinger - pretty basic but very cheap. Not much to say about the beer except it is exceptional value-for-money if you're looking for a Cheapie McCheap. AU$37 a case of 24."
""
"Crystal clear light golden color with a smallish quickly dissipating bubbly white head that leaves spotty lace on the sides of the glass. Aromas of light pilsener malt, light earthy hop, and light fruitiness. The flavor is quite sweet with malty sugars and faint bready malts. No hop flavor, but a hint of metal of ash is in there. Better than that cape verde beer, but nothing horribly exciting."
""
"Mearlry a 'fizzy yellow beer' nothing sets it apart from any other 'American Adjunct' While it's remarkable smooth and drinkable. It lacks substance and Flavor in a major way. May make a great beer for guests or after dinner/easy drinking. Nothing I would ever recommended to a snob/nerd... That said, is rather easy to drink at 5%"

"No off-flavours, hell - very little normal flavour either, for those of us keeping count. A bland, unassuming Continental lager, nothing to recommend, but nothing to turn your nose up at by the same measure, I gotta say. If beige was a taste and experience (wait a bit, and some overpaid marketing hack will actually pitch this, I'm sure), then Oranjeboom is replete with it."

"Keep your money in your pocket and buy something else. This lager is reminiscent of all of those cheap watery lagers we used to have to buy as teenagers because we didn't have the funds to buy anything else. It's so light and tasteless that it can barely be considered worthy of even being on these forums - it's barely a beer! It's weak and doesn't even lead to anything of a buzz, so what's the point in it?"

"Easy drinking beer, clean, with a cracker grain backbone and light floral hops. The mineral character is unique and somewhat mouthwatering."

"O: This is so damn dull, it's unbelievable. It's not even dull in the right way - instead of drinking like carbonated water, it's like drinking carbonated water that's obstructively sweet. It'll get finished unlike two others I drank earlier. I'm now officially sick of macro lagers for a few days - I need a proper IPA right about now."

"A six pack of tallboy cans goes for $5.99 at the local Trader Joe's. Brewed according to German purity laws. Oranjeboom is a good value for an all malt lager. It is enjoyable when camping, fishing, or out in the hot sun. Good if you want to throw back a few while watching the game. Orangeboom is malty and dry. It is an economy version of the Euro lager. But its pretty damn good for the price."

"This beer is a cheap, inoffensive but otherwise unnoteworthy beer. I can’t conceive why I would be drawn to try it again."

"Overall, Oranjeboom is a decent macro-style lager that I'd drink again if in the mood for the style. It's certainly much better than most of the macros produced on this side of the Atlantic."

"The Verdict: Not bad. Fairly well balanced and goes down smooth. Almost too smooth. Nothing outstanding about it, but nothing to complain about either."

"RJT"
"Overall / Drinkability: Not bad, but nothing special. Good drinkability though - washed down chicken and caprice salad easily without getting in the way. I think that's what makes this beer - it's an average beer, versatile with food, but nothing special. A staple beer to have with food if you're not looking for something interesting."
""
""
"Pilsner appearance, light carbonation. The smell is more complex than other cheap beers that I've had. This one has a cereal nose with a hint of, you never would have guessed it, orange. The taste is nothing special, just crispness in a can, and you can certainly drink many of these guys. I'd say this is a great summer beer. Overall, I'm impressed for the price. This shows that the Europeans make great cheap beer where America makes shitty cheap beer. Go craft in America, go cheap in Europe. That's my slogan."

"light corn yellow, fizzy head that fades to a dusting of sud. smell is light and corny. taste: crisp and biting, but with a horrid metallic aftertaste. some faint citrus, melon, cinnamon. putrid kinda mouthfeel and aftertaste."

""
""
"Light Pilsner with a refreshing sensation, for a hot day."

"Not a bad tasting beer, just not enough taste within the thin walls of this glass of beer."
""
""
"The body was good, smooth, even, clean and well balanced. Drinkability was very good, the beer went down quickly and easily after a 2+ hour bike ride. Overall, an above average example of the style. Worth grabbing a can if you see it and are in the mood for light, smooth, easy drinking beer."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but doesn’t have any interesting aromas or flavors."
"O: This beer is not bad but it not anything special either - easy to drink and sessionable but not sure that I would really want to have more than one of these at a time. I wish this had a little more hop presence (not a ton but just a hint more)."
""
"just about even with your typical American macro. In a nutshell: I won't be buying any more of this brand."
" Overall: 3 out of 5. An average Euro-lager. Not bad at all, just nothing exceptional. I'm thinking pork sausages and potatoes with this one."
""

""
""
"O: An average Euro Lager. Easy drinking. Nothing special"
"O: A strictly mediocre beer. Still better than the American adjuncts."
""

"There is nothing special about this lager. It is clean yet lacks any kind of flavor."
"O - Not too bad for a macro pale lager, head and shoulders above most."
""
"I bought a six pack of cans from Trader Joe's for dirt cheap. Not nearly as bad as some of the other reviews have given. Can popped with no fizz but it poured a 2"" off-white head with medium lifespan. It's a clear straw yellow color. Smells like grass and grain. The taste is mild with malt and a very tiny bitter aftertaste of hops. The mouthfeel is a little creamier than most American BMCs but otherwise they're equivalent."
"O - Overall, an okay beer. There are better examples of this style out there, but this one is cheap, and makes a decent lawnmower/hot day kinda beer. Can't really complain here for the cost."
"A tang, rather than a taste of hops. Not even worth the price at Trader Joe's, where it has been a cheap Euro lager staple for years. The Simpler Times Wisconsin beers are even cheaper but so much better."
"500 ml can from Trader’s Joe. Pours golden with a thick, long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of grass, grain and dough. Body is light and smooth. Taste is a little bit of hops, a little bit of biscuit malt and a lot of sourness. The can was probably old, but still I don’t think I will buy this beer again."
""
""
""
"Overall - Its better then a miller or bud, but not worth buying. Its low alcohol, easy to drink feel would appeal to the classic american macro beer drinker, or someone that likes imported beers like becks or heiniken. Not for me, cant recommend it."
"Poured this 16 oz can into a pint glass. This Euro Pale Lager poured a clear golden color, produced a average white head and featured poor head retention. It provided a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this lager smelled of cooked vegetables, malt and a touch of hops. Light in body, this lagger is thin, and it features a earthy grain flavor. There is a suggestion of citrus and it has a dry finish. Overall there is not much flavor or much of anything to be excited about- I will avoid this one in the future. Prost!"
"Overall: a very drinkable pale lager. This is one of my choice tailgating beers."

"Pours a brilliant clear golden color with a bright white colored head, I've never seen this beer in the states. Country of origin is definitely Holland but this stuff is brewed by Hofbrauhaus in Braunschweig, Germany. 16 ounces in a six pack of cans for 7.99 you really can't beat that price. But how does the actual beer match up to the price. The symbol is the royal orange tree with a crown over it, can alone is very nice with blue silver and orange color pattern, literally made me want to buy this beer and believe that it was something special. Aromatics don't impress me much more of a muted cooked vegetable, corn syrup fermented out. Although brewed in Germany, I don't think this was brewed with just malts, hops, barley, and water. As I take a few more sniffs there is something pleasant about the overall smell I'm getting that makes it bearable. Flavor has an assertive grainy flow that has metallic edges and moderate sweetness suggestive of corn/malts with mild light herbal muddled hop grassiness. Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated lighter bodied mass produced industrial lager from Europe. This beer has a history of an original site in Holland, that has been bought out by Interbrew, now Inbev, and is just now part of a portfolio of similar beers that will sell well to the masses. Overall a slightly above average Euro lager with some redeeming qualities in between some rather harsh moments in each sip."
"Overall, this is an average example of the style. It does nothing to separate itself from the rest of the pack, but is by no means not drinkable. This beer has its place: a nice sunny day working in the yard or at a ballgame."

"Overall-- meh. This isn't good. It isn't terrible, but it is so bland and boring that if it some how became a vapor, birds would fall from the sky- dead of boredom."

"I got this can from Trader Joe's. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, grain, and hard water. The taste holds notes of wheat, light orange peel, slight floral and malt. The body is quite light, with a light carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty standard beer, nothing to rave for or against."
"Golden color, not super high carbonation, not really very fragrant but beer is the common man's drink and this is definitely worth having in the fridge for a cold one"
"My oranjeboom 330ml can poured into a glass mug with a transparent amber colour with a thin head that left little to no lacing. Smelled weakly of sweet grain, and tastewise there was were uninspiring (but not too off puting) flavours of yeast and corn. Mouthfeel of mine had fleeting carbonation which quickly turned watery. Overall, there's not really any reason to come back to this forgettable cheap beer."
"Drinkable yes in a Stella/Heineken sort of trashy euro lager way. Drink it ice cold and straight out the can and it is not bad. A buck a can at TJs make it decent value. Better IMHO than a Bud or Coorlight with the fact you can taste and smell hops but it is not up to the Grolsh/Pilsner Urquell standard in taste."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a 2 inch fizzy off-white head that fades to a thin cap. Random spots and streaks of lace slide back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grains, corn flakes, and some sugary notes. Taste is of sweetened grains and corn flakes with a dry grassy flavor on the finish. A slight herbal bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. Carbonation is average with a crisp, clean feel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer - nothing too good but nothing too bad. On the cheap at Trader Joe's."
"O) A refreshing beer cold for a hot summer day but not a standout. Still a beer and capable of being enjoyed."
"More enjoyable than the typical mainstream domestic lager. It does have actual hop flavor that avoids both skunkiness and any real bitterness. Not a bad session beer for $6 a 6pk of pint cans."
"The body is a very pale brass colored body. The off white head and lace are excellent. Both have a lot of creamy staying power. The smell is mild. The taste is also very mild it hard to really get a sense of anything. It is light and thin with mainly cereal esters with some yeast spice."
"While it is just another run-of-the-mill lager from Europe, at least Oranjeboom is cheap when you get it at Trader Joe's. I can't complain too much about a $1 pint can."
"I picked up a few tall boy cans at Trader Joes last week and just cracked a cold one to have after a day in the sun. Not bad at all--simple, crisp, refreshing lager. Reminds me of a lighter version of Grolsch. Some nice light hops and malt. A touch of the Euro lager skunkiness too. Overall, an enjoyable brew and certainly better than most cheap American brews."
"Overall this is an okay lager - better than bmcs"
"D- Refreshing, though nothing special to taste. Respectable (read: more expensive) alternative to Budweiser. I picked up a six pack at Trader Joes, which seems to carry nothing but Sierra Nevada and douche beer. Wasn't really in the mood for Sierra Nevada, so I grabbed this one. Hypothesis confirmed."
"Beer was less agreeable the more it warmed. One of the few I'd say drink cold and enjoy the skunk on it."
"If your into trying new beers like I do, go get yourself one and check it off on your list of conquered beers. Otherwise, any standard American BMC will do just as well."
"Food match: Boring food... steamed vegetables and plain white rice. The hint of honey I found might make it go well with dessert, but who drinks beer with desserts?"
"Dr: Affordable by Irish standards, but nowhere near a great beer."
"O- Very crisp and light brew. Just really nothing going on here."
"A very average beer; certainly not what qualifies as premium in my book. Flavourwise, it's bland and uninteresting. Might be refreshing in hot weather, although I can think of better things to drink. Pass...."
"Pretty good beer."
"This beer reminded me a lot of a Grolsh or Heineken. It's got that traditional lager flavor to it where it's a little bitter and aged. The color is plae yellow and not overly exciting. Just about another European Lager. I don't see myself really trying to find this one again any time soon."
"D: Overall this is a very light and refreshing lager that is both easy to drink and easy to stomach. Very sessionable, but not overly palatable. At $6 for a six-pack, this is an absolute steal."
"D - Not a hard one to drink for sure."
"This was an average brew but still worth a try and kind of fun to have at New Year's since it's not super popular here in Central PA."
"Sometimes you've gotta wonder at the random beer you can find for real cheap at Trader Joe's. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, corn, dust, and hard water. The taste holds notes of wheat, light orange peel, flowers, light greens, and corn syrup. The body is quite light, with a light carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty standard beer, nothing to rave for or against."
"Would be easy to session. $8 for a sixer isn't a bad price either. Another Euro lager that trumps your typical American rice and corn beer. Would drink again."
"Drinkability is good. This would actually be tasty in the summer months as its light and you can definately put a few away. I'd say the cloying kicks in about round 4."
"It is what it is and I would take it over a BMC, or at least a BMC light."
"Picked up a single can for $1 at Trader Joe's to try, since I always see this beer here. Poured into a tall pilsener glass. Bright yellow color. Foamy white head with some lacing and decent carbonation. Smelled like an average Euro lager. Taste was better than I expected. There was a bit of malt with some corn flavor, but there were no real offending flavors to turn me off at all. Mouthfeel was crisp enough to please me. Drinkability was fairly good, as this beer was smooth and easy to drink. For a dollar, I wasn't expecting much, but it wasn't too bad. I would drink a can of this beer again if the price was right."
"Poured from an extra tall can, pours a glowing gold with a short-lived fizzy white head. Aromas similar to those of the self-proclaimed King of Beers fail to impress. Fortunately the taste is nothing like the KoB's, but it's still falls short of being interesting. Faint grains and a light, sugary sweetness dominate the profile, which finishes long and honeylike. Watery body is unappealing. Sadly I bought a six-pack."
"My pour created an impressive two fingers' of bone-white head with excellent retention, especially in the face of the broiler oven that is today. Nothing like high heat and humidity to make me want to crack open a CAN of beer! Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the characteristic malty/lager-sweetness that lagers are supposed to have - not the weak, diluted smell of AALs. Sure, my sixer was a little more expensive than a rack of Miller, but that is the trade-off for not using adjuncts. You CAN't have it every which way but loose. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant lager sweetness in the mouth. Finish had a faint taste of honey, another characteristic of unadulterated lagers. This was a nice, pleasant lager and one that I would put in my cooler. It's not going to knock your socks off, but it won't require choking it down either (hear me, Minhas?)."
"Pours a clean, pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a dry, sugary, almost orange-ish like lager smell. In the taste, kind of a standard Euro pale lager with a small orange hint. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, small orange like aftertaste. Standard lager, but hints of orange are different."
"Update: The 5% version is mostly the same notes, only sharper, ironically making a less drinkable beer. Still ahead of most other cheap lager in a can, though."
"D: Easy drinking for sure. Though another country's basic lager. So yes it is drinkable, but would I buy it again... no."
"Overall: Might be an ok beer without the metal."
"An acceptable beer, but pretty underwhelming for something with the word ""boom"" on the can."
"This one is cheap, if you need a cheap beer it works."
"D - This was worth a try once but I don't think I'd want the imported version we get in the U.S. again. I'm sure it is much better closer to the source."
"D- Crisp and light, no real distinct flavors, weak and slightly watery...probably won't be a ""go to lawnmower"" beer ever, cheap is what this beer has going for it. Better than your typical Pale Lager, but not much to get excited about. Good alternative to more expensive Euro Lagers..."
"D - A good European lager."
"This beer struck me as a good alternative to Heineken with a similar flavor profile for a cheaper price(purchased a 6 pack of 16oz cans for $5.99) The color is nothing too spectacular with a light goldish color and a decent frothy head. Smell was of grass and dirt with a hint of malt sweetness in the background. Flavor was on par with other euro lagers such as Lowenbrau and Heineken; sweet malt and earthy flavors up front with a bit of a dry finish. But this is by far the driest beer I have had in awhile. maybe just a bit too dry. Anyhow, this is a decent and cheaper alternative to more pricey euro lagers and tastes like it will do the trick on a hot summer day, give it a shot."
"The mouth is smooth but no more than slightly above average. I suppose its an easy enough beer to drink, but there is not much to recommended and not much to disparage with this one."
"Beer is a golden yellow with a good head, some of which was knocked off by the bartender. It has a sort of grainy smell. The taste fairly crisp & refreshing. Much smoother than I expected. Beer is good for more than one. Not a bad Euro beer."
"One pint, while easy to finish, satiates my desire for this beer."
"In the mid 1970's it was my prefered Dutch beer on tap (I lived on the Dutch/German border). I don't remember it being so bland then, I think it has changed a great deal since those days."
"Not quite the sum of its parts."
"Eric"
"D- Pretty easy to drink but nothing I will seek out again. Better than the the 3 Horses from the same company I had earlier tonight but neither one are anything special."
"The can must be the way to go. The beer is a simple lager, really cheap and from a can no skunk. The beer has biscuity malts, almost no hops, is slightly sweet, not much bitterness to counteract the sweetness. But the flavor is minimal anyway! Probably a great summer beer."
"Golden amber. Small head fades to nothing. Aroma is mostly honey and some nice biscuity malt, but also a little skunk in the background. More honey and sweet malt on taste. Very gentle short-lived bitterness. Very watery and too much carbonation. Too sweet and not enough hops, but otherwise pretty good for a macro lager."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smells of malts, some sweetness. Taste is very mild, slightly bitter. Not a whole lot of flavor here. Feels good in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre beer."
"Pours out a clear yellow color with a medium white head. The aroma is light malts, some skunked notes, and grassy aromas. A sweet grassy and malty flavor, light hops. A crisp and clean pale lager. A decent choice, though I'd rather have a local version."
"Picked up a single from Liberty St. Tavern. Oh man, this is Skunk City, USA. Even after letting it air out for a few minutes, which is all a lot of skunked beers need, but it was to no avail. Beyond the stank, this beer basically tastes like Heineken. There's a yeast-driven fruity sweetness, though the beer isn't very sweet, along with a very pale grain taste. I'd honestly need to drink them side-by-side to tell them apart. This one might have a little more flavor, but the skunk makes it hard to tell. Freaking green bottles."
"D: This is nothing more than another mass-produced Euro lager. No real personality or taste to speak of."
"Drinkability: Not nearly the hop profile I would expect from even a Euro-pale lager. Lack of carbonation makes the beer too syrupy and cloying."
"Oranjeboom pours a transparent orange, slightly brown color with a 2 finger white head and some sticking. Classic marco lager nose...hmm. Nothing amazing here in taste either, macro, cheapo malts, weak hop character and an overall skunky, funky taste. Gotta love those green bottles. This beer is no stand out, and is much better on draught in Amsterdam. It sports a light body and is extremely drinkable, if you like this kind of stuff."
"Pouring from a one pint can you see a decent golden color but a minimal head that quickly fades to nothing with zero lacing. The smell isn't bad but not very pilsner like; just a plain ol' Dutch lager. The taste is mild in its maltiness and with modest bittering and floral notes from the hops. There is some of that traditional hop smell found in pilsners and Dutch lagers. The mouthfeel is thin and light with balancing carbonation. If you're hot and not in the mood for something heavy or serious, this is not a bad place to go for $6 a sixer of pint cans."
"Pours a very light, crystal clear, golden color with a big lid of fine white foam. I got some lightly sweet lemon with lightly toasted grainy malts and a touch of grassy hops. It's got a light body with a loft of soft foamy carbonation. Pretty basic stuff here."
"I would drink this beer again if it was available, but would rather try another beer if possible."
"This is pretty drinkable, and I really like the 16oz can serving. This is definitely a beer I will get again, because of the great price and value compared to some other macro beers. Doesn't finish as smooth and crisp as others, but still a decent beer nonetheless."
"Poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass. Body is a bright, mellow golden color, topped by a small. bright white head. Sweet, bready aroma of adjunct malt and just a hint of fruity hops. Palate is sweet, corny adjunct malt, with a mildly bitter hoppy edge on the finish. Body is a touch creamy, but still thin, much like many Euro lagers. Not a bad option, but, like many in its class, should probably be avoided. Still, not particularly offensive, and I could drink a couple of these if given inferior options."
"Drinkability: so-so at best. Typical euro macro flavor that is boring but you can drink in a pinch."
"Brisk taste with some noble hops commanding the flow. This is crisp and pretty drinkable. Aftertaste has a tinge of metal which is a negative. Overall this is a good cheap sixer for when people are coming over for the game but not really something to look for when you want to drink one quality brew."
"16 oz can - $1 at Trader Joe's. I'm not one to complain about decent beer at a value price. By no means is this a top tier beer, but it is very easy to drink and has no real offensive qualities. Conversely, there is no semblance of a chance being taken here either. There are no strong flavors or aromas - the appearance is normal. A totally average beer and there is nothing wrong with that in my estimation. Recommended."
"16 ounce can, bought from Anderson's for $1.15. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing is low. It smells like sweet/bready malt, grain and a little bit of hops. Aroma isn't bad at all, but it is weak. Taste is sweet and grainy. For the style of beer, it's not bad. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin but not watery. Has a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's prety easy to drink. Overall this beer is pretty average. With that being said, it's OK to drink and it's not offensive. I'd drink it again."
"D: This goes down like a champ!"
"Avoid. Trust me."
"usually these brews are thin and watery, but a solid mix of aromas and flavors give this brew a wonderful array of attributes that work together on its behalf. it is light bodied, but not thin. it is pale, but not weak. a solid example of a pale lager. cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied. Carbonation seems on the light side. Relatively smooth, though with a watered down taste. Overall, it's pretty much unimpressive. Not recommended."
"Another selection from my Israeli adventure... purchased a four-pack in a sixteen ounce size for pretty cheap and wasn't completely dissapointed... This beer got me pretty buzzed and for the money I paid, wasn't a bad experience... A nice flavor which was grainy and light compared to some other styles I sampled over there... actually saw this brew again in Trader Joes but passed it up as it was much more expensive in the States... Mouthfeel and drinkability weren't bad... this beer went down real nicely and I could easily drink a few of these... Would recommend this beer being an above-average example of the style..."
"Could drink many of these because it is light and does not fill you up too much like some other lagers might"
"Oh well, I have a few more to take to the pool on a hot day...that's about it...not much to say about this one..."
"Overall, just too sweet and nothing interesting going on. Don't bother."
"Recommended"
"The taste up front has some decent hop character...not citrusy, maybe a touch of grass. The malty side moves in rather weakly about midway through and it finishes fairly dry but kind of watery. The more sips I take, the less ""interesting"" it becomes. Nothing special here and is really only useful for the sake of trying it and reviewing it."
"I'll be taking the rest of these with me when I go to play volley ball with my friends! It's great for an active summer day!"
"D: Very drinkable and thirst quenching on a summer day in Southern California, I got through the 16 oz. in a matter of minutes, and would definitely drink this again. Great price, and a great summer beer."
"It's Beer!"
"Very drinkable. It reallly hit the sopt and went down nice after a tough day at work."
"Overall nothing that stands out. A cookie cutter low cost Euro lager. Easy enough to drink however."
"Notes: Not alot to say about this as its a run of the mill beer with no imagination whatsoever. You'll be better off leaving this on the shelf."
"Easy drinkability level and somewhat quaffable. Reminds me of decent pilsner. A straightforward lager with crossover appeal."
"Mouthfeel was zesty with a lingering oiliness. Not one I will seek again."
"Picked up a six pack of pint cans for 6 bucks at TJ's. Pours a typical yellow, darker than some euro lagers, lighter than others. Tid bit of head that goes away quick. Aroma is of apple peal, pears, noble hops, summer nights in germany. Flavor is basic lager, non-offensive. Not as crisp as it could be. Decent amount of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel, like I said is not as crisp as a lager of this type should be."
"M&D - light bodied, and highly carbonated, not smooth, but not harsh either, a better than decent euro lager"
"More thin than I'd like but the carbonation isn't bad and this is really aimed at people who drink swill anyhow. When compared to others of its ilk, it stands up rather well. I'm not having another, but I could see how a certain demographic would find it a step up from their everyday offerings."
"Drinkability: Not that bad, average is a good descriptor."
"Typical light lager that's very drinkable but doesn't really have any stand out features. There isn't really a distinct aroma; smells a bit like corn/grains. Mouthfeel is very good; light with just enough carbonation. Taste could be improved if turned up just a little bit; its hoppy flavor and bitter aftertaste is pretty good, I just wanted more of it."
"An ok beer but nothing special. This one doesnt try to hard to impress."
"Pours a nice golden color with lots of white chunky head that eventually fades but leaves lace all over the glass. Smells mostly light struck. There's a faint hop aroma, but too faint to really pick it. Tastes very clean, slight bitterness. Leaves a sort of coppery aftertaste, not sure where that came from. But mostly it's just a clean flavor. Mouthfeel is like slightly heavier water. All in all, it's very drinkable. Mostly because there isn't much flavor there to dislike. Would be good on a hot day."
"Drinkability: Next question, please. This one is not worth pondering"
"Cheers!"
"The appearance is light gold with a fading white head. The nose has light grains and hops. A corn flavor rudely joins the grains and grassy malts and I'm picking the carbonated water in taste. Thank god none of those have more than very mild flavor profiles. The only positive that thing stuff has going for it is the price tag, but even so, it is more expensive than High Life and PBR, neither of which is any worse."
"Drinkability: Certainly nothing here too offensive, but nothing to inspire a second tasting."
"This one is a bit tough to drink in the grand scheme of things. It's not a great, standout lager to begin with but the mouthfeel definitley kills this and draws out all the negatives that keep this beer weighed down."
"Overall: My sample was quite clean, with good overall balance. An enjoyable experience. This beer is not unlike Löwenbräu."
"It is in offensive ,possibly because there is not a lot to it ,but is different in that it is not dominated by malty sweetness which I suppose must be a bt of a positive"
"Pours a clear orange hue under a one finger white head that lingers reasonably well as thick film and collar, generating no lace. The nose is nasty: strong of malt and cabbage - not a pleasant experience at all. It doesn't seem skunked, really; just bad. The mouth is light and harshly prickly. The taste is not horrible, thanks to lots of sweet and bready malt. There's a touch of peach or apricot, but even that is a bit on the overripe side. Very little hops emerge in the finish as just a tickle of dryness in the throat. Overall, this beer is a waste of time. (Guess I wasted a lot of time in my early days in Kazakhstan...)"
"What could be a decent Euro-Lager ends up becoming rather bland and boring in the end. Drinkable, and possibly a good hot weather brew, but nothing too special here in the long run."
"Boring beer. Pours out to a light yellow color witha head of white foam that loooks like someone spit in my beer. Hints of lace. Medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of wet cardboard and sulfuric farts. Ugh. Flavor is weak and uninteresting; watery malt and barely, a touch of dry hops, some adjunct-y flavors, and that's about it. Mouthfeel was kind of bubbly, but then again, so is Pepsi. I won't go for this again unless it's free and i'm already fit-shaced. Pass on it."
"This beer poured a clear bright, light yellow with a long lasting white layer of foam. The aroma is subtle malt. Not overpowering, clean and nothing out of place. The taste of malt struggled to overcome the sour taste. The sourness lingered for a long time on the tongue. The mouthfeel was the most impressive part of this beer. The carbonation played with my tongue and made this beer enjoyable. I don't plan on buying this beer again. It is not bad but it is barely average."
"A decent Euro Lager. A lot like Staropramen. Strong straw color. Very clear and carbonated. A bit sparkling. Good head retention that fades to a trace. Aromas are mostly grainy, corn-like, and a bit light-striken (not bad enough to call skunky), grassy, earthy, and yeasty. Flavors are similar, throw in bready, hoppy (of the noble variety), a bit citrusy or apple like. Finishes crip (but not dry), refreshing. Easily drinkable with a pizza."
"A below average lager"
"Standar pale yellow lager body with a small, bubbly white head that fades fast. Lightly-sweetened malt, some grain on the nose. Dominated by skunky euro-hops, vegetal and spicy. Also a hint of spent coffee grounds. Taste is soapy toasted grain and corn. Skunky hop bite takes us into the not-quick-enough finish. Bleh. Very watery body, even for the style. There are much better eurotrash lagers out there."
"Drinkability- Think I will pass on this. Was strangely somewhat excited to try this one because my friends' dad swears by this beer. He grew up in Scotland and drank nothing but Guiness, Smithwicks, etc...and he likes this the best?!?!?! I think that deserves a WTF! Not horrid, but I don't think I would need to buy this one again."
"Okay, of the ten beers I received in a Beers of the World gift pack, this is the only one that came in a pint can. Cannot tell too much of a difference between this and a Budweiser, except the latter would be cheaper to buy. The smell is worse however. Tastes of corn and other vegetables. No impressive appearance or mouthfeel qualities."
"I guess on a very hot day, if this were very cold, I could drink a couple, unless I had Pabst or Schlitz in the refrigerator."
"Looks like the can tends to get better reviews."
"The taste has hoppy edge to it but alas, very thin and somewhat grassy and finishes dry."
"Big, coarse, white, foamy head. Clear, pale gold beer. Sticky spots of lacing. Sweet, malty nose shows some corn, some sugar. Nice enough. Corn syrup front. The thin middle sours a little toward the sugary, bitter finish. Some crackers. It's a decent sweet lager."
"Bought in a 16 oz ""tallboy"" Typical lager to look at, golden with a massive frothy white head. The aroma is quite Ok..neutral..mostly hops. flavour is strane, Its ok to start bready, semi sweet malts, then theres an odd bitterly astringent taste,maybe its the hops..I dont know, strange. goes well enough on the tongue. Overall this is not very good..had many better Dutch lagers."
"Pours a clear light gold with a thin white head. Aroma is nothing more than a light bit of grain... same thing for flavor... some sweet malt with no discernible hop flavor or bitterness. No real off flavors, but then again, no real flavors to speak of. Mouthfeel was slightly acidic and dry. This is a terribly boring beer... there is nothing offensive about it... unless you are offended by flavorless fizzy yellow beer... but I can find no reason to have this beer over almost any alternative, including water."
"I can drink this but why? Colt 45 is better than this; Miller Lite is better too!"
"Served at about 50 degrees. Straw pilsener color with a soapy off-white head. Bready and malty aroma prevails in the aroma with faint notes of hop presence. Mostly sweet maltiness, clean tasting with a slight bit of dimethyl sulfide in the overall aroma/taste (not offensive, though). Mouthfeel's thin and smooth. Drinkable, but boring."
"Appearance: Clean, moderate golden color. No head to speak of. Aroma: Vey sharp hoppy aroma, kind of like the bitter lawn clippings (oh, sorry, they call them ""greens"") they put into expensive salads at upscale restaurants. Very bitter smell- I hope I didn't hurt my nose. Taste: the sharp bitter aroma follows through into the taste- it isn't as noticeable on the first sip, but it strengthens through the finish. I think there are some floral/citrus flavors too, but they are overwhelmed by bitterness. It is probably pretty refreshing on a hot day while mowing the lawn, but today isn't one of those days."
"even if your hard up for cash and want a beer, dont bother with this. i can think of several others down at the lower rungs of the price scale which are more worthy that this. i wouldnt even drink this beer if i was desperate. probably the worst european import going around."
"Oranjeboom is an odd brew that I'll recommend. Don't expect to be WOW'ed but an average beer worth a try. Bottles only!"
"Light gold color, medium head. Aroma is grainy, grassy and sweet. Mildly hopped and lightly malted. Good crisp clean taste. Light flavor. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is crisp and very slightly bitter. Some fruitiness to it as well. Typical Euro-lager. Not skunked, but not surprising since it is in a can.. Drinkable but nothing special"
"The Rathskeller Wine & Ale Fest:A medium sized white head with small sized bubbles that fully diminished.The body was clear with fizzy carbonation.The hue was yellow and the nose was moderately hoppy and lightly malty.The flavor was sweet and the mouthfeel was smooth and light bodied."
"Comments  A mixed bag for sure. I cant believe that this is what the founders had in mind in 1671."
" Not too bad on a hot day. A step up from the macro swill if that's a slight compliment. Won't buy it again if something better appears on the shelves at Joe's. Not a glutton for punishment but payday better come quick!"
"This beer pours a light yellow color with little head and lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly malty, but not strong at all. The flavor is very soft on the tongue and has all the good qualities of a pilsner. It's very easy to drink and quite smooth. I give this one a thumbs up."
"Didn't find anything to great about this beer. It poured a golden amber and had average foam for a lager. The smell was nothing to write home about. I could smell so malt, but nothing outstanding. The taste was just OK, again, nothing outstanding that would make me try it again."
"A great looking lager beer that is light amber to dark gold with a half inch white head that dissipates moderately quickly. Superior lacing is noted from the remaining ring. A bit of a skunky smell from the green-bottled beer, but not highly objectionable. Remaining aroma is somewhat yeasty. The taste is decently balanced with no overpowering sweetness or bitterness. Refreshing overall sense and quite thirst quenching. A quaffable brew this appears to be."
"It pours a crystal clear golden body with an orange-ish cast. It's a bit darker than many similar lagers. The bright white head holds well before dropping to a creamy collar that leaves transient lace throughout the glass. A clean, softly grassy, and gently malty nose greets you. It's light/medium body appears nicely crisp in the mouth due to a fine, median carbonation. The taste, however, is quite basic with a well-balanced combination of moderately grainy malt (some adjuncts are used), light grassy hop flavor, and restrained bitterness. It finishes dry and refreshing; but leaves you wanting more. Well done, but quite mainstream."
"Light gold, little effervesce activity, sticky white head, vertical strips of lace. Skunky nose, no growth beyond that... next to nothing after it airs out. Grainy palate, semi-sweet, hint of husk, the finish is softly spicy, this is when the carbonation is noticeable really plain tasting. Clean finish, boringly dry. Yawn, a boring beer through & through. Skip it."
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a tall and foamy white head that fades into a bubbly and sticky lace. Nose is fresh grass with a touch of honeysuckle. Very light in body and quite crisp. Taste is sweet malts at first followed by some strong medicinal notes similar to mouthwash. Very unusual. This is not a beer I plan to try again anytime soon."
"Not much to say about this really. Basically is about as flavourful as soda water. Average looking lager with zero taste. And this was recommended to me in a bar in the Netherlands. Last time I go to that bar, I can tell you that much. Really so little to say cause it is awful but I have to keep typing or it won't let me post this."
"Crystal clear medium golden color with sheets of carbonation and a small head that, as Jason says, looks exactly like frothed milk. The head retains well and offers lots of sticky glass coating lace. Massive skunky aroma overpowers the sweet malt scents and slight hops. Taste begins with faintly sweet malt, followed by cooked vegetables, finishes dry with a harsh medicinal bitterness. The mouthfeel is watery, although the head is wonderfully creamy. This beer is a curious mix of strengths and weaknesses."
"Skunky aroma and nice piss-yellow color. I hate to say it but I'd drink a Heineken before this. Truly nasty. Unfortunately it's really a waste of a cool name. At this rate I am staying out of the low countries."
"No different from things like, Heineken, Bavaria, Hollandia, etc. Sweetish flavour, light in body and taste, slight skunkiness, a bit funky, but generally bland, its hard to say anything good about it, except its drinkable.....just."
"Notes: There is not much to this lager at all, oddly there is not much of an imported flare which was the only surprise. I’d pick a domestic US macro before this one. The only thing that saved this beer for me was that it was quite clean with not too many off flavours or aromas."
