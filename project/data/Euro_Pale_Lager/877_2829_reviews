"This is a LIVE Cultured beer - Very Unique - if you get the chance you have to try as it is NOT being brewed any longer"

"Overall this is one of the worst lagers I have ever had. It's sour then as you drink becomes more drinkable. Almost as bad as BMC yet crafted?"

"""Wow"" was the first word out of my mouth after tasting this. Incredible clean and smooth. Bit of sweet apple and dry cereal on the front end with a very dry finish. Bit of nuttiness through out. Balance is impeccable. Well blended with a body that's on the heavy side of light. The body really makes this beer, being well carbonated but well held together as well. Very good."
"O- the Yuengling Lager is still one of my favorite lagers. this isnt awful but it is a decent go to if there is nothing else around. A middle of the road lager."

"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours slightly hazy-golden with a medium lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of biscuit malt and grassy hops. Body is medium and crisp. Biscuit malt balanced on the palate by herbal, grassy hops. Finish is medium lasting, semidry. Nice lager, I would definitely buy it again."

"O: It’s a good beer, makes for a good session beer. I could see enjoying a few of these bad boys, hanging out with my beer geek buddies while grilling meat. It’s perfect with a nice salty piece of food. Cheers."
""
"O- A good enough beer as a default. It is definitely a good example of it's style."
""

"Slightly hazy dark gold in color, this beer supports a nice frothy white head. It has a pleasant, clean aroma of sweet grain and maybe a hint of hops. It has a fuller body than most euro lagers, and it tastes much how you would expect from the smell: smooth, mellow, and sweet, but with enough balance to keep it drinkable. Overall a tasty lager worth trying if you are in the lager mood, but nothing stands out. Well done."
"O - overall i believe this is a really nice summer-time beer, or a good ""in"" for those new to craft beers"

"Overall: a decent if unspectacular pale lager. The initial flavor is great but the aftertaste takes a bit of the shine off of this beer for me."
"O- very surprising. I went into this with low expectations, but came out pleasantly surprised. Infinitely drinkable with great smooth and well blended flavors."
"Overall, a drinkable beer, hinted at a touch of cider in a piles or pale ale."
"The aroma was dull, boring, and bland. This was your classic macro lager. Light aroma of grain and rice and that was about it. The taste went nowhere as well. While it was crisp and refreshing, so is water and this was not what I wanted at the time. Very light grain flavor and no depth at all. The finish was non-existent"
"A good tasting beer with lots off flavor well made."
"O: The beer is very drinkable and it’s quite flavorful for the style. It would make a good accompaniment to a meal."
"Sadly the taste and aroma is on the bland side but the refreshing feel of the beer helps it out. This is certainly a session beer and is what saves it. I think people who are getting into beer, this is a non-offense beer to try; definitely better than your macro Lagers."
"Overall-interesting if not entirely successful take on a hoppy lager. Ok but pales in comparison to some others. Worth a try."
"O - Easy to drink. Not a remarkable taste but not boring either."
"Overall- nicely done lighter lager. Pleasant brew here."
"Not really sure what to think of this one. Just seemed way too sweet for a euro pale."
"Drinkability:Super sessionable. I like the grassy honey combo. River Horse's best so far. For the style, this beer is exceptional."
"The taste is very bready malts with a slight sweetness. There was also fruity(apple and pear) hint in the finish. A bit of a hoppy biterness in the finish caps things off pretty good. Definetly a clean crisp quality Lager. The beer is medium and a lot fuller than I expected it to be."
"Could drink a bunch of these. Not overly complex, but an easy going well made lager."
"One of the best lagers I've had in a while. Meduim hop profile and clean sweet malt flavor. Great balance. Very nice biscut taste towards the end. Finishes pretty clean but still sweeter than other euro lagers. I was itching for another sip again and again. Went great with my buffalo wings. The drinkabillity is exceptional. Ill definately be looking for offerings from this brewery in the future."
"Drinkability - This is an awesome beer. I think it is making my list of faves."
"Tried the River Horse Unfiltered Lager on a whim. I had high hopes at first. The initial taste is full of flavor--maybe a little subtle malt/biscuit flavor but as it goes down, it becomes very average. Also, too carbonated for my taste. Appearance and smell also unremarkable. The end result is not unlike a very average domestic (mainstream) beer."
"D: Decent drinkability, but not exactly a brew that will wow you. I'd like to think it's probably better for a beer to bore you, than for a beer to make you want to drain pour it. That's where this one resides; it's just plain."
"Overall - This could be the state beer of NJ; could be the SABL of New Jersey and a shore fixture."
"River Horse Lager pours a hazy light gold with a thin and quickly disappearing head. The aroma is sweet pilsner malt with hints of fresh baking break and herbal hops. The flavor is sweet and malty, without being as cloying as I expected from the aroma. There are some herbal hops in the flavor, but the bitterness is light to non-existant. Overall, this is a pretty solid beer, not too much to intimidate a BMC drinker, with enough flavor to please a craft beer drinker."
"Poured form a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a hazy dark star color, with small, but pretty pure white foam head. There is visible carbonation rising in the glass. The beer is unfiltered, so the haziness is expected. There is some earthy yeast is the nose, as well as a hint of citrusy hops. There is some acidic sweetness in the flavor, kind of like lemon, but not quite. You can also taste some bread-dough flavored yeast. There is sweet malt in the aftertaste. The beer has a light body and a lot of carbonation that kind of distracts as you taste the beer. All of the sweetness makes for some mouth coating. This beer looks really promising, until you actually taste it. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer, there are just a lot of other pale lagers that I like more."
"D-This is one that's really quite easy to drink. I could see having quite a few of these in a night, even more so if the taste was a little more complex."
"The worst beer of the mixed 12 pack by this brewery but still not too, too bad overall. Nice hoppy aroma and slight bitterness to the taste, but had a bit of a funky aftertaste that didn't sit too well with me. I've definitely had better euro pale's but this one is a decent shot at one... drinkable, but not the best tasting thing you'll try."
"Reviewed on 8/27/09. Bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet floral hops, lagery carboardy malt. Flavor is sweet initially with citrus and light fruits and a malty finish. Pretty decent beer and great for a pale lager. Very refreshing."
"M/D - Somewhat silky body with a full mouthfeel, not shocking for an unfiltered American brew. Flavor lingers at the end of each sip. Easy to drink, went well with Thanksgiving dinner but not something I would look for as a daily drinker."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The explosive, overactive texture in the mouth is definitely detracting... coupled with the bold flavor, it becomes a bit noisy for the palate to relax and enjoy. However, the overall session was an eye-opener to a very expressive, well done example of an unfiltered lager."
"The taste was very pleasant. Not bitter or sour, but, mildly pleasant for a lager. Great summer quincher or just sit back and enjoy this good lager."
"Drink I guess would be good but with the sweetness of this beer it could be much better."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild, sweet aroma. Taste is crisp with, somewhat malty with a bit of hops. Feels good in the mouth and goes down very smooth. Overall this is a quality lager and worth checking out."
"D - Quite sessionable at 4.5% ABV... Not outstanding nor disappointing in any particular area, just a nice brew overall..."
"Solid is the word I begin and end with... interesting citric aroma--clove and softer hops present a welcoming fragrance... golden effervescent body in a pilsner glass, head is thick, creamy lingering with a finger of depth... full-bodied, easily drinkable, with slight carbonation engaging the throat... banana notes lead the tastebuds of this generally roundedm malty lager...as a sampler filler, serviceable... as a stand-alone, not worthy mentioning in the same breath as any of the major lager players...not watered down, but not lively or intriguing enough to warrant another bottle unless circumstance forced it so... solid."
"D: Overall, a fairly nice mouthfeel and taste combination. Nothing to get overly excited about here as the lager finishes smooth, but was a little on the bland side. A little bit more sweet malt backbone and this beer could be much better."
"M&D: It's well carbonated with a light mouthfeel and lends itself very well to superb drinkability. Definitely a worthy summer beer."
"D - Very drinkable, but very forgettable."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a small tight white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of light hay, some green apple and lemon. The taste is sweet, not cloying or anything close to that but kind of a sugar sweetness. Some hay or grass flavor, perhaps a touch of grain. A light body with plenty of carbonation, quite fizzy, maybe too much carbonation. Starts and finishes sweet. Quite a unique lager, IMO not a Euro lager in any regards. I don't know much about this brew but I would say that it has some wheat malt in it. The back of the label seems to suggest this. A sweet lager, though not that sweet. Different but easily drinkable."
"Golden hue with tumultuous body and exceptionally large white foam head. An unpleasant grass, hay, hops in the nose. Tastes of grass, light hops from middle to finish, alcohol, light floral. Mouthfeel is light and flat on the palate. Lacking in notable characteristics that standout. Chalk this one up with Rolling Rock and other macro light fizziness."
"Picked this up as a freebie in a trade a few months back and well curiosity finaly got to me. Pours a slightly darker shade than most BMC with no haed and no lacing as expected. Smells of slight skunk hit me followed by faint malt. Taste not bad not as bad as it smells but still not great. It is kind of drinkable could totally see myself with this beer on a nice warm summer night easy drinking not offensive heck I bet the neibors might even drink this"
"This is a very basic beer, and on the better side of the style. Not quite like Budweiser but more like a Heineken."
"D - Highly drinkable and decent tasting. Fairly basic, but that with this style you don't really want anything too over the top."
"All in all, the rating on BA is a little bit harsh in my opinion. This is one worth trying but not a world-beater by any means."
"I love this stuff. Lagers, especially pale lagers, are my favorite style. They are woefully underrepresented by American craft brewers in my opinion. Much respect to River Horse for this offering."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Very easy to drink."
"D> definitely a summer beer I'm downing in the middle of winter, I'd be lying if that didn't impact my thoughts a bit. But overall a very solid example of the style in my eyes."
"D: Fine but not great."
"Overall- Better than I recall. Decent lager that won't offend. A good light beer!"
"Poured a yellow, clear color, but with a surprisingly full, thick head. Looked fairly generic. The smell was mostly malty, with a pinch of spicy hops, but overall also kind of generic. The taste was similar to the smell. The beer was dominated by malts and grains, but ended with a little bit of dry hoppiness (but not really any bitterness). However, there was a light, sweet presence in the aftertaste that did separate this beer from some standard marco brew. It was well carbonated, with a thin mouthfeel, which left me the overall impression that this was just a micro version of an average, light session beer."
"I was a little taken aback by the color and smell of the brew, but the taste redeemed it from a flush. I wouldn't pick up a 6, and I'm a little hesitant of what my perception of the next one of these from the mix pack will be, but for now, it's okay."
"Got a variety pack so I'm going to taste them all though."
"Reading the other reviews, maybe it's just that my standards are low when they come to this style, but if this was available in my neck of the woods, I would certainly use it as an introductory beer to the macro types, and go back to it occasionally myself."
"It looks freaking GRAY almost - a very dull and hazy gold color. I smell some classic lager sulfur notes and a slightly sour grain note. The taste is pretty mediocre craft-brewed lager - more hops than a macro or euro-lager, but the malt taste and body suffers. I could totally drink this all day if it was free. Buy it? Nah."
"Basically a decent, inoffensive lager. The malts are a little similar to an export lager for the sweet grains. I also get a yeast character that reminds me of apple pie filling. So while this isn't a terribly complex beer, it's something a little different for the style and tasty."
"Thin and watery feel. Not unpleasant but not much there. It's a not-bad lager. Very run of the mill but drinkable."
"T/M/D: Malty sweet, some sugary flavours, a bit of light citrus. Mouthfeel is a medium carbonation and a lighter body. A touch of bittering on the finish, but a little on the light side, overall. Decent drinker, certainly easy enough, but other options are out there."
"Medium-bodied, crisp mouthfeel along with a good level of drinkability to match... Not the company's best brew, but a decent stab at the style nonetheless..."
"O: Overall a dry, sweet lager that sits somewhere between a boston lager and a yeungling. Its been years since ive had this so decided to update review. Has a bit more flavor and sweetness then a yuengling, but a bit rough around the edges at times, and not as smooth or polished as a sam adams."
"Clean golden color with a loose, minimal head, it does have a moderately interesting, very slightly hoppy aroma that I enjoyed. However, when it comes to taste..ummmm....what's the opposite of bold? Mild I guess would be generous description - or maybe like an English-style bitter of sorts. Water-like and uninteresting is probably more accurate."
"When poured into a standard Victory pint glass, this River Horse is a clear sunshine yellow that had a miniture head of fizzy white bubbles. It only took these fizzy white bubbles to fizzle away into a few rings along the edge and if you're lucky, a spot or two of lace. It had a solid burnt aroma of toasted malts, citrus fruits, citrus hops, and it finished up with a little lemon zest. It had a crispy taste that contained toasted malts, a small slice of lemon, a few more citrus fruits, and then it ended with some spicy and dry floral hops. It was clearly a light bodied beer with a crispy and dry aftertaste of floral hops and a touch of toasted caramel malts. It was really nothing more than your run of the mill clean fresh session lager."
"D: Could be sessionable, but there are other choices out there... not the best from River Horse."
"The clear golden color has a slightly orange tint topped with a modest head. The aroma is muted, but what is present is pale malt with a small hint of yeast. The flavor mirrors the aroma, with subdued malt and slight sweetness. Not much of a finish. The mouthfeel is light and not bad. This beer is not very assertive, but the flavors that do come through are not bad."
"Drinkability- It wasnt what I would really call a regular lager but it was good and I would have to say very refreshing."
"Cant really say all that much about this beer but this is just completely run of the mill. No more, no less. I guess you can call it drinkable, but very watered down and flavorless- right in the eyes of a macro light."
"The drinkability just is not there for me as I don't like this beer at all. MK"
"It's somewhat drinkable if you are looking for a no-frills beer. It might be average-at-best if it were a macro, but as a craft beer, it's a miss."
"The. first impression of taste really impressed me. There was just the right amount of carbonation. There was a really nice refreshingly slick feel. There was also some actual taste in this Irish Lager. I'm sorry to say this but I just had some Smithwicks the other day and I prefer this beer(I know thats an Irish red Ale, I just wanted the comparison of Irish products/style lines). Lots of zesty grains and malt flavor; some nice balance. This would go really well with a burger or hot dog with spicy mustard."
"This was essentially anotehr underwhelming brew from River Horse. Seems the special and/or seasonal brews are the ones to try and the regulars are fairly average at best."
"Paid $1.49 for a bottle. A very lazy slightly almond/amber brown with a hint of orange. The most noticeable smell is like under converted malt. The taste is similar - like i'm drinking right out of the mash tun. Low carbonation and mouthfeel is quite wimpy and weak."
"Cheers!"
" This is not horrible for a lager. I could see it on a hot day in the summer."
"I see no reason to drink more than one of these beers in a sitting. This is not a horrible beer, and it does not seem to be overly beset with major flaws, but with so many quality beers available today I would not recommend this brew."
"Drinkability: lower than good in my book as this is just not an exciting beer on the flavor and aroma front."
"poured a hazy light amber color with scant white head. Smell is slightly sweet, but very minimal. Taste is very sweet and citrusy (lemon) and extremely pleasant. Finish is refreshing, but a slight dryness coming through. Was a very easy drinking beer. Would be a good session beer for a hot summer arfternoon. Nothing complex about it."
"Just say no."
"This is the second Euro Pale Lager I've had in two days, and they are pretty similar. On the sweet side, but not cloying, kind of effervescent, with some detectable hop presence. This one is on style, if my understanding is correct. Maybe not my cup of tea, but it is a well made beer."
"This poured with a thin, white head that seemed to evaporate as quickly as I could pour. It turned out to be a pale yellow color with some floating yeasties in evidence. The nose was sweet, but not neccesarily of all malt. I thought that I may have detected some corn in there. The mouthfeel was thin and grainy with a light sweetness on the palate. The finish was also mildly sweet, but lacking a really good lager flavor. This would be good as a summer beer; with an outdoor barbecue and friends; as a session beer; but I'm not going to reach for it as a matter of habit."
"Pours a pale golden yellow w/ a finger of bright white head. Some small dark particles visible. No lacing to speak of. Very little aroma--just a small bit of grainy malt, a small bit of grassy hops. Taste is a husky pale malt with some caramel flavor coming through, a slight hop bitterness at the finish. Medium body with a medium carbonation level. There's nothing really great about this beer, but it's a decent lager that's a step above the macros."
"I pity people that are trying to expand their beer horizons, pick up this, then think, Damn, I couldve bough 2 cases of Bud for the price of that 12-pack."
"Yellow. Bad sign. I usually do not like yellow beer. Fizzy head. Went away fast. Smell is full of adjuncts. Sweet corn and rice. However, I did detect the slight presence of slight hops. Taste was very much like a macro but I could find hints of a slightly more impressive grain bill. Kind of a husk thing going on as well. Did not really like that. Mouthfeel was actually full of flavor and very crisp. Kind of like a good tasting macro. This could be a craft lawn mowing beer."
"Pours out a hazy gold yellow with minmal head.Smells grainy smells like a light beer.Has a sweet taste with minimal to no hop flavor.Mouthfeel thin typical adjunct nothing special. Drinkability is ok, theres better lagers out there,nothing special. probably wouldnt go out of my way to buy again."
"Poured out a light golden color with a small head, no lacing left on the glass which told me that it wasn't the freshest out there. Smell consisted of some sweetened malts, light whiff of corn, and that was pretty much it. Quite light in the smell and taste department. Taste was slightly on the sweet side with a hint of some pale wheat. Mouthfeel was slightly watered down I thought, it also seemed to be a little flat. Overall it's not the best lagers out there, but to wash down dinner, I guess it gets the job done."
"Presentation: from a 12 ounce bottle, this is a hazy, straw-colored liquid with a thin, unremarkable white head. Grain and grass are first notable in the aroma, followed by a bit of caramel. Not much hops in the aroma, but they do come through in the taste. Its a moderately-dry brew, with a lot of graininess. Seems to have a cereal grain and husk-like quality that doesnt really fit with the flavor. Also, it has a thin, meager body. I wasnt particularly impressed with this brew, but Id probably have it again, in a pinch."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a grainy pale malt scent along with a rice aroma. It is light on hops and seems quite dry. The taste is decent. It has a grainy pale malt flavor that is weak and watery, but at least it tastes like beer unlike most macros. It goes down easy and finishes sweet and slightly dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent lager. It has pretty good flavor, but the appearance and aroma need to be tweaked a little. All in all, it's a good drinker."
"Not too good, but I can drink it easily. I wouldn't get it again, though."
"I Taste alot of fruit, almost like a granny smith apple. it leaves no lace around the glass, however it goes down real smooth and tastes real good in your mouth. Almost like you could leave it there for awhile. I could see myself drinking this on an everyday basis."
"Hazy light golden appearance. Small off white head recedes to a bubbly collar quickly. Lace is minimal. Aroma is corn. Definitely corn. And very sweet malt tones. Taste has a little cooked corn quality to it. Quite sweet. But a little bit of a dry finish. Nicely carbonated and medium bodied. To me personally, there's not a lot of difference between this and most Mass Marketed Adjunct Lagers."
"Thin, anarchic cream haze top. Fizzy and active in the glass, of a dark gold color. Good-looking for a lager! Nose is a bit smelly, of dusty wheat. The first thing that I was struck by besides the low carbonation of this brew was a tart, limey (not British) taste that felt like an off-taste to me. Otherwise, there is a nice honey-sweet cream of wheat in the aftertaste. Ends quietly. From a sampler case of River Horse, this ended up being my favorite--but probably not New Jersey's finest offering."
"The beer pours from the 12-ounce brown bottle a slightly murky gold color with a moderate frothy white head and the residual lace a thin but concealing sheet. Archetypal lager nose, all malt, sweet, crisp and clean with a sweet start that carries to the cadaverously thin top. Finish is stern in its acidity and the hops apropos to the style, drinkable, but a little light for me."
"Zum wohl!"
"Pours clear pale straw, with a small white head that races to leave, barely any remnants left behind as lacing. Aroma is very slightly grainy, with a little sweetness. Flavor is crisp, slightly sweet, but mostly grainy maltiness. Body is slightly thin, finish is crisp, clean, and quite refreshing."
"This beer is just bland. Not in a Budweiser way for sure but the lable led me to expect something more."
" Where is the flavor? You will pick up a very bland malt base with basically nothing else going on. It is hard to tell if the flavors would be good if there was more because it is very difficult to pick up on much of anything. This beer was a major let down."
"Going to have to disagree with some of the previous posts and say this is a decent session beer -- there are times when a beer like this is just what you need when you just need a beer. ;-)"
"Fresh batch delivered from the brewery 1 week ago. Quite hazy, but it does not appear to have been bottle conditioned. No yeast particulate can be found in either the bottle or the glass - this is some serious chill-haze! Yellow golden in color with a creamy white head that drops quickly but keeps a good collar and light surface coating. The aroma is not off-putting, but somewhat odd. No real malt character is noticeable, and there are no hops to speak of. The body is medium with a fine, moderate carbonation that is somewhat dull in the mouth. The flavor is of a quasi-dryish maltiness supported by an underlying bitterness. No hop flavor is discernable. It's well balanced but lacking in finesse as neither the malt or the hops come through. It's also kind of soapy which may explain things. I'm guessing that this is a bad batch due to insufficient rinsing following a caustic cleaning leaving an abundance of fatty acids and an increase in pH due to residual caustic residue. I'll have to revisit this beer, but it is fresh and it was delivered to the distributor by one of the owners. The packaging is in perfect condition, so I have to assume that there's nothing unusual about this (not an old or returned case going back out to the public) - it's just a bad batch. However, since I hate to put this up I will make an extra effort to re-review it this week."
"It's not that bad, drinkable brew from the neighbors!"
