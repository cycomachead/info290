This was the first brew that I ever sampled on draught. In Holland in fact. I was all of 15 years old, and no one batted an eyelash when I ordered up my first glass. Ahh Europe... Well, decades later I picked up a 6-pack at a local gas station and was a bit disappointed that they  have departed from their signature stubby bottles in favor of a more generic looking longneck. I had no plans to actually review this beer so I never even poured it in to a glass. Even so, the bottle still emanated that familiar sulfurous skunk aroma. I've come to actually enjoy that lightstruck lager scent. There isn't much else to the nose. Maybe a little corn sweetness. In the flavor department I was a little disappointed. It's been awhile since I've had a Heineken, but I seem to recall that it had more pop to it with that Euro pale lager funk. This rendition was very light on flavor. Smooth, crisp, slightly drying with just a hint of dankness. It was so much cleaner and less controversial than I recalled. Watery, with fizzy carbonation and popcorn-like hints of adjuncts in the finish. I was able to crush that 6-pack without any problem. In fact, when I was done, I wondered what happened. If not for the buzz, I couldn't be sure that I even had any beer at all. Still, there's nothing to complain about here. I only wish there was a little more of that aroma and flavor that has come to define Heineken in the US. This was so mild that it really gets lost in the lager mix.","JohnnyI","Jan 19, 2015"

What hit me right away when I grabbed the bottle was the very strong skunky odor.  The appearance of the brew matches other Euro pales I've had.  The taste is mild, with a nasty edge of skunk on the back end.  Moderate carbonation is prominent on the mouthfeel.  Overall, this is a passable beer, but not much more than that.

Shortly after I moved on to harder stuff for a while but rediscovered the joy and memories of that slender green bottle when I got a couple years older and started hitting the clubs.

It's always trendy to slam the "mega-brews," but there is a reason Heineken is one of the world's most popular: it's actually pretty good. Excellent with all food types, this Dutch juggernaut just keeps on rolling after all these years. Certainly not one of the best beers in the world, it is, nonetheless, one of the better lagers and imminently sessionable. Found 24 of them on sale for $20 at Total Wine in Atlanta and could not say no.","BeerDocT","Jul 09, 2014"

I like high gravity dark ales generally, but a relatively light lager like heineken is good for a sunny day at the beech for a refreshing thirst quencher. I like this beer and compare it to Tsing Tao in overall character. Im not a hop nut. I like a good balanced beer with floral notes (fuggles,wilamette hops etc). Heinekens noble hops is really its driving force. I wouldn't call Heine's the bees knees, but Its by my estimation better than most domestics. I like the skunkiness of heineken. This skunkiness makes heineken the perfect beer for any beer batter recipe. I make onion rings and breaded mushrooms with heineken based beer batter frequently. For you hop nuts, and other beer snobs complaining about Heineken, dont drink it... Stick to your hopslammer, and Belgian Triples, and your beer ego will not be compromised. I know you like to think you have an evolved palate, and your beer smugness is dually noted.","Freeker","Jun 05, 2014"

It is comparable to pilsner urquell from a can (newly available and delicious)- but with not quite as deep of a maltiness, and certainly not as bitter as pilsner urquell. But still, quite delicious, and my mini-keg is working quite well. Bought it cold from the store, brought it home (gently), tapped it right away, first glass was a little foamy, other than that just fine!","DubbelTrubbel","Jan 26, 2014"

3,10.7,2.75,2.75,3.25,2.75,3,"Poured from the iconic green bottle. A pale straw color that fizzes and pops with too much carbonation. This classic Euro lager is quite variable depending on age and storage conditions, but at its best yields a doughy sweet carmelized or "cooked" aroma with some musty grape notes and hop spice that round things out a bit. Tastes much the same, with a cooked DMS flavor, some tannic grape skins, some hop bitterness in the chalky dry finish. The classic skunk although this can vary from mellow to rank. A metallic ting and rubber flavors show up if you pay close attention (a reason not to pay close attention). Heineken is an OK beer for what you get, a mass-produced industrial product with some historical cachet. Do not pay exorbitant sums for large quantities of this. Drinkable in quantity when you do not feel like analyzing a beer to death.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 20, 2013"

It has some decent wheat flavor, the refreshing feel of a lager, and that's it. It's a high quality pale lager. The problem is high quality or not, pale lagers are almost always far too bland for my taste, and Heineken is not an exception.","Pyramid_Head","Sep 22, 2013"

Scent was mostly grassy hops and sweet crystal malt. Not bad, but not amazing. Surprisingly there was no skunk, despite this coming from a green glass bottle. Flavor was mostly sweet crystal malt, maybe some adjunct sweetness, and some grainy flavors. There was slight hit of grassy hops at the end, but no where near what I want in a lager. Mouthfeel was light bodied, which is good, but with a high, aggressive carbonation that I didn't care for too much. Overall it's a stunningly average beer. It's better than many American macro-lagers, but it lacks the flavor and bitterness that defines a truly good European pilsner or lager.","Auraan","Aug 24, 2013"

Contrary to popular belief, the "skunky" smell and taste are not unintentional, but the adjunct flavors certainly don't make this the elite European beer that it claims to be. This lacks complexity even when compared with average European pale lagers. Flavors of dry hops, yeast, bread (?) and sulfur. It just never tastes fresh. One thing I will say is that if you are opposed to the skunky scent, you can avoid this to some degree by choosing the beer on draft or in a can as opposed to the green bottle.","DeFaz","Jul 14, 2013"

The smell is your typical lager - mostly hops and barely - although at times I would say there is distant citrus smell. Taste is above average - not much, not spectacular, but better than most other lagers. Mouthfeel is close to perfect - just the right amount of carbonation with no aftertaste or stickiness. Overall, it's better than most lagers I've had, not the best, and I'm always happy to pick one up and think of my dad...","jjamadorphd","Apr 22, 2013"

Aromas of toasted grains, some floral highlights, and a touch of skunky weed. Seriously, there is a touch of cannibus in the aromas. Flavors are fairly watered down, with a toastiness for the backbone and some tangy, sweet overtones. Floral highlights, with some spicing of oregano and peppermint. Very light bodied, with a minimal aftertaste. Toasty flavors linger on the palate, with a skunkiness that is hard to shake. Watery, clean finish. This one really doesn't do a whole lot for the palate. It's a bit awkward on the flavors, limp on the body, and not overly refreshing at all.","GarthDanielson","Apr 05, 2013"

Finish was slighty sour dough like. Texture was smooth but had an initial coarse edge from the carbonation although this faded. Slightly thick body. Overall this is better than quite a few Euro Pale Lagers out there. Not that interesting but well made and not offensive in any way.","jonb5","Mar 18, 2013"

3.52,29.9,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Heineken was always one of my favorite beers from the very first time I drank one. Heineken is a very skunky green bottled beer with a slight bite, finishing slightly bitter when swallowed. It's a bit of a full beer, meaning some people might not choose to drink a six pack of it, but might have one or two with a meal. Heineken is a trendy beer with good marketing, but that's not why I consider it a top ten for life. I consider it a great beer because I love the taste and texture, slightly skunky, with a bit, into a smooth bitter finish. For me, it's a good anytime, anywhere kind of beer, every now and then I may opt for something a little "lighter" but not very often.","Hophead85","Dec 31, 2012"

It’s got the same old metallic, bland, cooked vegetable feel as other inexpensive beers and for that, I have to say that Heineken is not worth your money. You can get the same thing for a couple of bucks less on a case of 12.","Stephan99","Nov 19, 2012"

Smell is mainly of malt and grain aromas. Taste is much the same with a sweet finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

I thought that I had also read that they had dropped any adjuncts that may have been in the recipe. Maybe it's just the can. I don't know. This beer is very refreshing. Very Malty. Pours the same dark straw color that you would expect from a Euro-Lager. A bit of bitter hops. Since I have tried this in the can, I had also stopped by at a local pub and have had this on tap. This beer is actually a decent beer. It is not Paulaner or Spaten, but for the price it's pretty good and not much more than American swill.","metallistout","Jul 17, 2012"

I've tried other German beers in the past with no particular avail to my taste buds but this is definitely a more similar to what I am used to drinking. Only real complaint is that this beer is wayyy too pricy. It just doesn't bring enough to the table for me to constantly be shelling out $28 for an 18 pack. The mouthfeel was pretty bitter, Though oddly enjoyable. The appearance was like most other beers around here, just with MUCH less carbonation and a darker color.

There's a good amount of taste going here that I would assume comes from an all grain mash. Prefereable to the American adjunct style for sure. If this stuff sold at regular price for less than a buck a can/bottle then it would make an excellent fridge stocker.","VaterRoss","Jan 26, 2012"

The smell of the beer has the standard lager yeast aromas and fresh cut grass notes on the nose. The taste of the beer to me is decent, I don't find that this brew is too overpowering with the lager flavors of grass and such. There is a little bit of a metallic flavor to it from time to time but I somehow manage to look past that when I drink it. The mouthfeel is light but it does feel heavy once you drink a few of them in a row. Overall when it comes down to it... If I'm stuck choosing between several American Adjunct Lagers or this one, I'll take thsi one every time. I don't mind this beer at all.","Knapp85","Dec 31, 2011"

The only even slightly drinkable option, so what the heck- I didn't feel like any hard liquor, although that's usually the way to go on a flight. The one good thing I can say about this is that it's not skunked in the can. One thing I always hated about Heineken was the green glass bottle- that always increased the risk of a skunky beer, and I've had many a skunky Heineken back in the day. So this is a huge improvement in that respect. As good as the can is, it's only as good as the beer that's in it. Unfortunately, that beer is Heineken. Pours golden with a thin white head. Smells relatively clean, with earthy bitter hops, and notes of lager yeast. Of all the bmc type beers out there, I always did think Heineken was one of the hoppiest, and kudos for that. Tastes grainy with some more bitter earthy hop notes and a noticeable lager yeast twang. Tastes somewhat creamy with a crisp finish.

Pretty large amount of carbonation coming up through what I would call a barely darker than piss yellow color. The beer is completely transparent, the head is now gone, but it looks like I'm getting pretty good lacing out of this beer. Overall it looks like an adjunct lager, but it's got some nice areas. The smell is very faint, what I can pick up is some sweet malt, which is nice, not a bad smell for adjunct lagers, usually I get a more sour malt smell. Underneath that there is a small note of hops in there. I have to say the smell isn't horrible, for sure an adjunct lager, but not a bad smell. The taste is very smooth, it goes down pretty easy with little interruptions. This unfortunately means that there isn't too much flavor, but I was expecting that. The flavors I can detect are much like the smell, small amounts of sweet malt, and underneath that a small amount of hops, the rest is all water. I mean the beer is a very weak beer, super light, super watery, but the flavors that are there aren't bad at all, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. I also appreciate that the smell and the taste are exactly the same. Overall not a bad taste, unbelievably weak, and barely any taste in here, but where it is, it isn't bad. Mouthfeel is decent, bigger than I would expect, and not as much carbonation as in some adjunct beers. The drinkability is exceptional, this beer just goes down like it's nothing.

Light in body and easy to drink, this sparkling clear beer is a textbook lager. The taste offers slightly earthy and crisp hop notes, but lacks an attractive aroma.

A typical lager in feel, a light to light-medium bodied feel, with a crispness and dryness left on the palate. In the world of macro beers, this is not half bad.

The taste, which, again, is fairly similar to most beers popular throughout America, is mostly just wheat-like with only the faintest imaginable trace of hop or barley. The reason it is better than others, at least, is because I'd say it's got a very clean feel to it and it's easy to drink as a lawnmower.

2.83,4.4,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Heineken is a beer that I expected more from. With it's place among the classic beer of the world secure, let's get down to the review. The colour is a straw gold colour that it representative of so many North American style lagers. The aroma is slightly hoppy and not too overpowering. The taste is pretty mild with nothing to really distinguish it from anything else. Not a bad beer, but it isn't a favourite of mine either.","cyrenaica","Jun 24, 2007"

Decent for what it is though.","MrHurmateeowish","Jun 08, 2007"
2.24,-17.3,3,1.5,2,2,3.5,"I bought a keg can with hopes that I would actually try a Heiney without the skunk. Poured a 24oz keg can into a 22oz tall glass. Pours clear with little head and no lace. Nothing if any in the smell department and no shunk (good on the skunk part, so I thought). Next thing I noticed is that the beer is very sweet. I wonder if it needs the skunky flavor to cover the sweetness. Other than sweet nothing comes to mind to discuss. Mouthfeel is light and the finish is sweet. For me, I don't like this at all in a can. Back to the bottle or tap if I have Heineken.","mattgert","Jun 02, 2007"

The taste is bland and uninteresting. This could be one of the worst beers coming from such a wonderful beer-centric part of Europe. It is too bad. This is the beer that you see at bars and package stores that have no selection, and at weddings where you have choice between Budweiser, Miller Lite, Amstel, and Heineken. They add this crap to the list as though they are appealing to people who know decent beer and have taste. Unfortunately, it's European Budweiser and nothing more.

The alcohol is very easy to taste, sometimes so strong it masked the full power of the hops.

The smell carries over into the taste and the skunk remains, which isn't quite as good as the smell. Definitely crisp and smooth even still. I could easily find something better for the same price but it's not bad to have a few of these after a hiatus.","ncvbc","Mar 22, 2007"

It is also somewhat pricey for what you are getting. I still enjoy Heineken but for my money id rather get Anchor steam, or SN pale ale. That said its still a good beer to try, its also a good beer if you are new to beer. Its not too aggressive but a good deal better than alot of the other watery options.","Redwood21","Mar 20, 2007"

Smallish white head, faded pretty quick and left a slight lacey film along the top. Lots of visible carbonation, chains of bubbles through the glass.Smell was not at all bad. Decent malt presentation, light grain and bread. A little bit musty, but at least had some character. Taste was crisp clean and refreshing. Very light, with lots of carbonation, very lively feel to it. Taste was a classic lager, very thin but had body, big malts with nothing to really balance.

A slight malty aroma, and no skunk. A light buttery taste tagged along with the typical euro lager. Also, to me, Heineken has always had that "skunk" to it, but this special bottle I could not notice it. I dont know if it was the cork or what, but this beer seems to have aged superbly, especially for as boring a beer as it normally is.

The aroma is "skunky", which reminds me I will be enjoying a crisp lager. The flavor is afforementioned, and has a fairly clean finish. Perhaps my review is biased, as this is an old fallback for me. The fact that I keep purchasing is a cue to it's drinkability. This beer is refreshing, if you are looking for consistency in the same old thing: quality.","ewurm","Nov 25, 2006"

I liked the smooth flavor, and light body of the beer. It is truely a nice drinkable lager, great for a mild summer afternoon. It has a nice clean after taste, without that characteristic green bottled paleness we see in the US. Overall I have always enjoyed Heineken for what is was, a standard European lager from the Netherlands, imported for it's exotic appeal in the US. After touring the brewery and tasting/reviewing several beers from the source, I have a new opinion of a good solid pure lager, with great history and tradition of brewing excellence, but still with a slightly dismal masproduced lackluster quality to it.","mwagner1018","Nov 24, 2006"

The only beer where I can truly say there is no discernable taste, which i suppose is amazing enough in itself.

Honestly, it is a very good session beer because it won't offend you or get you ripped like an Aussie. Some say its better from the can, but I say its better from the bottle, and drunk from the bottle. In a glass it just seems way too bland! In a bottle it kinda concentrates the hop presence and carbonation with you throughout the drink. Anyways, the color is typical euro lager, of course, you knew that already. Produces a tall head at first, and leaves some lace here and there depending on how fast you drink it. The smell is fairly bland; of course thats if you dont get a skunked product. Now the taste is pretty balanced, and thats what I like about a Heine! A good part malt and a good part hops. Mouthfeel is decent for a lager, doesn't have a stickiness to it like an ale has and the drinkability is its best part I believe. You can session with this the whole day.

The color isn't bad, there's a little bit of amber to soften the neon-yellow of its nearest competitor (that's Budweiser, the only brand in the world that sells more). But for me taste usually determines how appealing the color looks. The head is pretty small and weak too, though better formed than the very worst American lagers. Smell is pretty weak on tap and a little on the nasty side. You can smell a little grain, and that's not too bad, but the hops do not smell very good. Taste still isn't good, but at least I could almost finish the beer without an effort. The malt was weak, but strong enough that I didn't have to concentrate to find it. The hops are middling in strength, not very interesting and definately too bitter. They are also a little on the funky side, though not enough to make you think they purposely brew the beer to taste like its spoiled like in the bottle. There was also a nasty aftertaste that kind of grew as I got further down in the glass. Then, I thought it was the hops which like I said, are stronger than in your normal American macro-lager, without being better. But now I'm wondering if it wasn't from cheap grains. I notice some other reviewers seem to have tasted adjunct grains, which I assumed weren't in Heineken. Anyway, the mouthfeel was on the thin side, like its American macro cousins. And drinkability was bad both because of that aftertaste that made it harder to drink as I got deeper in my glass, and in this case because I was paying for my beer by the glass and the bar hand my favorite beer in the bottle for less money. Anyway that's Heineken for you- better than Bud or Highlife, worse than almost everything else. Drinkable, but barely. And ridiculously overpriced. If you do happen to like this beer, the one thing I can say to improve your drinking experience is don't drink it from the bottle. If you like bottled Heineken you should save your money and drink Natural Ice. Or maybe just hairspray. Oh yeah, drink it cold too. I'd hate to think what room temperature would do to a beer like this.","casualbeerman","Jan 03, 2006"

When Im out with friends, often times this is the only other beer available besides the American crap. And yes, I still do enjoy it at home. In fact, there is one sitting in front of me as I write this review. Poured into a tall pilsner glass, it's easy to get caught up watching the bubbles rise in it's golden, crystal clear liquid (ok maybe that is just a throwback from my drug days!). Overall it is a mild and unoffensive beer. A little more full flavored than the American macros, but not much. But that makes it a great beer for drinking one right after the other. My biggest problem with Heineken is its inconsistency. Due to the fact that they bottle it in a green bottle it can very easily become skunked.

This was my favorite beer for a looong time before I encountered BA and such. The keg can enables me to actually enjoy one of these from time to time that isnt a skunky piece of shit. I poured this out into a tall pilsner glass. It looks like a good Pale Lager should, crystal clear, straw colored, light carbonation moving through the body. A nice head is produced, doesnt have the best retention or leave any real lace, but no biggie. Let me say again how nice it is to have a Heineken that doesnt smell like skunk-spray, it lets the fact that it does have a bit of character be revealed. The malt on the nose is like buttered sour-dough, spicy green hop aromas are present as well. The flavor comes across a bit sweeter than I remember it beingsame light buttery-biscuit flavor that I picked up in the nose, little spicy hop in the finish. Its really light, slick, and finishes really clean, I can see the appeal to the less educated crowd. The flavor is a lot lighter than I remember as well, leaves me wanting a little more (even from a Pale Lager). I still stand by the fact that is a decent beer, and Heineken gets its propers for the keg can. An especially good beer for washing down food.","FormatKid","Dec 18, 2004"

A wave of skunkiness hits as soon as the bottle is uncapped, thankfully this smell almost disappears completely after the initial whiff. The remaining aroma is grainy with a bit of light sweetness. Taste is grainy and balanced. Nothing too exciting here, but no major detractions. A little taste of sweetness pops out at the end of the sip.

For flavor this beer is extremely crisp with a grassy hop flavor and just a slight bit of biscuity malt tones. There is honestly more flavor in this brew from the carbonation I feel than from the malts and hops but heck it is smooth. The finish to this brew is just faintly bitter with just a slight hop presence. The mouthfeel to this brew is extremely light and the carbonation creates a decently effervecent quality to this brew.

The aroma is more pronounced, however, featuring some malty notes and something else as well, almost a faintly fruity or spicy note. The flavor itself is dominated by maltiness too. In this case, the malt notes are soft, with some complimentary hints of hop flavor as well as hop bitterness. The carbonation level is a tad lighter than the light American beers.

Remaining completely objective, I was floored by this beer. BRILLIANTLY clear light golden, forming a thick white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma is clean and crisp, with delicate floral hops, soft water, and a distant sweetness. Mouthfeel is extremely soft with a great wet finish. Carbonation is mild. Taste begins with lager yeast, minimal flavor hops, giving way to a pleasant and unique tea-like maltiness, followed by mild husken character and a soft, wet, well-balanced delicate bitterness with darjeeling/muscat character. This beer is infinitely superior to the many Heineken's I've had over the years from bottles and cans. Why they continue to bottle in green is beyond me.

Boy do I remember that smell which I used to think was exotic because it contrasted so sharply with the smell of American macros. Now I understand that it is the smell of a spoiled (aka skunked) beer. The taste is just as revolting as the smell. The only time I ever had an unspoiled Heineken was on tap in a bar in Brussels and my recollection is that without the "skunk" it tastes just like every other macro brewed lager..bland and without distinction.

For these people this is a very bitter beer. Other than the hops, there is not too much other taste here. A little sweetness and some salt are the only things that keep the taste buds distracted from the assault of the big carbonation. Also, it has a thin but appropriate mouthfeel.
