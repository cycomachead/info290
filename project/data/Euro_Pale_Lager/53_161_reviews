"this is either new to the market here or so poorly distributed as to be irrelevant and overlookable. its an interesting euro lager though, quite frothy in creamy in both look and feel, and has a nice wheat sheaf sort of body to it, different in its grain base for sure, bigger, not adjuncty at all to me. its a little sweet throughout, but its nicely carbonated and the finish is pretty quick, so i dont mind that. its just a lot more beer than some of its peers, and i definitely can get behind that. its sort of a cream ale meets a lager in a lot of ways, pretty boldly flavored, but fresh, not macro tasting, not tinny, not oxidized or anything, and its actually a pretty passable beer for something i have never even heard of. i could drink a ton of this, mindless beer, and you sometimes need that. good for sporting events and the like, dont think about it just drink it kind of stuff. one of the better of those types i have encountered in awhile. maybe this will do well here? the creaminess makes it."

"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, considering the style this beer is pretty solid but overall itâ€™s mediocre at best."

"O: had this last about 5 years ago in the UK - that was the ""velvet"" lager (nitro?) draft offering... this isn't all that bad, it's serviceable - thankfully has some malt flavor, to provide a modicum of interest"

"Overall, a good thirst quencher but that's about it. Decent flavor but nothing really special."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: All in all it's a Lager whose defining characteristic is the peaty taste to it. I'm not sure if that is what you are looking for in your Lager, but for me it was a good one off, but that's about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"For as many of these beers are out there, are there really that many people that love this style of beer compared to such beers as IPA, Oktoberfest, Porter, Stout, Red, Barley Wine, etc. Really puzzles me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sessionable, but not overwhelming. A standard in Scotland, but I much prefer Innis and Gunn."
""
""
""
"Better than most of the canned Euro lagers readily available, but nothing really stands out. Not sure what I was expecting, but with it being Scottish I expected something a bit more robust than this."
"Overall considering how cheap this beer is, it isn't that bad. It's good value if your having a good old fashioned drinking session down the pub."
""
"Nothing offensive to the senses, though nothing all that interesting, either. I imagine this as an acceptable stadium beer, one that won't make you wish you were somewhere else, just for the beer."
""
""
"Overall - I expected more from this one.. all I got was just another boring euro beer. It's not offensive and it is very drinkable, it's just plain and unremarkable. There are too many better options available out there - I wouldn't buy this one again."
""
"Pale yellow colour, just over one finger of white head, lots of lace on the glass. Smell is lightly grassy and floral, but everything else suggests malt sandwich, grainy with some graham cracker as well, some earthy hops as well. Taste is fruity and malty, a little on the sweet side, light lingering bitterness in the finish, biscuity and grainy aftertaste but slightly bland. Medium to high carbonation, light-med body, OK feel. This is a little better than some examples of style but nothing impressive here to say the least."
"Overall not bad for a pale lager."

"This is very traditional euro lager but taste and aroma docent seem to have the hein/Becks smell or taste... It certainly got more to it than the others"
"O: Standard pub beer. Good for a couple. Nice change form all of Bitter I have consumed on this trip."
"Tennent's was ok, The pour reminded me of something similar to a Miller Lite. The head was basically no where in sight. The aroma was grainy and had a little something else in there I'm not quite sure of. The taste was kind of on the sweet side. Not really the best mouthfeel here. This beer was nearly water when it comes to that. The beer isn't the best Scottish beer out there. It was nice to try but I've never thought about going back for more."
"Pretty poor lager that I try to (and frequently fail to) avoid."
"D: Not very *good*, but not bad. It's on the right side of undrinkability. Still not recommended."
"Golden yellow in color with a decent white head that dissipated pretty quickly. No head retention or lacings. Light malty aroma with hints of biscuit and a light floral, fruity hop character. Medium bodied, a bit of a buttery feel, with refershing carbonation. Sweet malty flavor with hints of bread/biscuit and a fruity apple and pear hop finish. Very easy to drink."
"Notes: Interesting story about how I came about trying this, and it hit the spot as a really needed an easy to drink beer (or any beer). All together, this is an easy to drink lager. Nothing that will blow you away, but it isn't a horrible Euro Pale Lager."
"Decent enough lager. Nothing to write home about but easy to put down."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a pretty blond with a nice big white fluffy head. The smell smelled like a skunk which I knew because for some reason that is what beer in a green bottle smells like. Green taste also, kinda sweet tasting. I will not buy this beer again."
"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is skunky. Taste is good, malts and grains, a bit on the sweet side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall a pretty good quality beer."
"Drinkability: If one were to excuse the ghastly skunkiness, it's really not such a bad lager, and, according to the label, is even ""Scotland's Finest Lager"". As I can't name another Scottish lager, I can't readily argue with that statement. Scotland's Finest Lager!"
"Was looking for an alternative to Heineken, but this is not it. Its appearance is impressive -- a sparkling gold with a foamy inch whitish head, but the smell is skunky just like Heineken, and the taste is even SKUNKIER than Heinekent. Dry & malty with a little bit of sweetness makes the drinkability OK, but just not a great beer."
"I'm a little surprised with how much I like this...it's a nice workman like lager...some spicy hop notes on the aroma but a clean, sweet maltiness on the flavor....biscuity and toasty maltiness...very refreshing and crisp...big problem is the skunky notes from the green bottle but I bet this is pretty good fresh on tap"
"Taste, a little surprise, mildly pleasant, even if it tastes like the malt backbone was lightened by some adjunct like corn or even rice. Minimal, but effectual hop presence. Prickly. Mouthfeel, not a lot, but enough and remains drinkable, a good hot weather session beer."
"D- All in all, a pretty sessional brew. I'll keep an eye out for this one when it warms up outside."
"Very nice golden color with a pure white head-has macro lager written all over it. Very sulfury and earthy aroma-very industrial like. Pretty straight forward malt flavor. Minor hop presence. Chemical and solvent like flavor. Mild corn taste. Average mouthfeel to it-standard as far as Euro lagers go. I could see this on a blistering hot day on tap and being fresh. As much as I love Tennents 70/ this is a wide pass for me."
"Overall, definitely not something I will be revisiting soon. If I did have a choice between this or other BMC products, I would choose this one."
"D: A classic Euro Pale session lager in the UK regarded on-par with Carlsberg and Harp, but without as good of a reputation. Not bad for what it is, but ultimately, just a cheaper version of the European Bud."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, and mildly citrusy in the finish."
"I would try this again, but only if it was either free or on-tap, preferrably in Scotland."
"So many of these beers taste like flat keg beer, but this holds up better. Nothing special. No lacing. Appearance is average to good. No hops, not too bitter, sessionable. Not bad, but no need to search it out."
"At 5% ABV, it's very sessionable and one you could certainly have a few pints of with friends."
"drinkability: very easy."
"D: No thanks..."
"M/D: The beer has a light body to it, but clean, crisp and very refreshing. The beer is very smooth and very easy to drink. I probably could have sat there for awhile and had a few more (but there was more of Glasgow to see and more pubs to hit) Overall, a good beer and one I would order again."
"When the Tennent's showed up at the party, I felt good...until....Typically, the scotch ale that Tennent's makes is a good beer & this what I expected. As soon as I saw the green bottle, I thought ""odd", but continued to open it. Weal yellowy macro-ish pour with white fluff head that disappears in a blink leaving little to no lace. Sweet corn & sour hop along with the prevalent skunk aroma made me think of Heineken & Presidente. The aroma was killed by the skunk & had no real notes of worth. This would be fine at a show with cheap taps or as a cheap can of hipster irony. Otherwise, I'd probably save a buck & get the Schlitz."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of air, with an extremely faint hint of bready malt. The taste is like the aroma in that it is missing from this beer. The carbonation is annoyingly high. Overall, this beer is more water than beer. I cannot see myself drinking this again."
"Taste: It has a nice hoppy bitterness to it. Not enough to counteract the skunkiness, though. Unfortunately the carbonation didn't last long, the mouthfeel suffers because of it."
"D: Like most adjunct lagers, this one's pretty drinkable. Whether I like what I'm drinking is another story."
"D- Easy to drink like most lager"
"Not a horrible beer but maybe they should stick to making Scottish Ales."
"This is what passes as the typical macro across the pond. Really bland, boring, and not something I would recommend."
"Don't bother unless int's on tap"
"Drinkablity: That's what these are made for..."
"If you're looking for something unique, this isnt it. If you're looking for that nostalgic scottish pub feel, Mmmm."
"Overall: Don't bother, especially at $9/6-pack."
"D: Ok overall, but a typical macro. Was not too impressive, and I would probably reach for PBR before I went for this one."
"Not bad..."
"D: One you could finish but is not saying much. Wouldn't recommend or try again."
"When ice cold this was boring, but with a few degrees on it, it proved itself superior to the macro lagers of Australia. Far from interesting, not complex or particularly balanced, just a simple, inoffensive, easy drinking beer for the masses. I have a feeling that it might be a little better from a bottle and on-tap."
"l"
"Served in a pilsner glass, this was an unobtrusive beer. Gold in color, medium head, tiny bit of lacing. It had a fresh, outdoorsy aroma. A bit of malt presence in the taste, with a hint of hops. Fairly refreshing, a true session beer. It goes well with a Reuben."
"I believe this is the first Scottish lager I have tried, cheers! Served it chilled in my Sam Smith pub glass. Poured a crisp straw color with a fizzy head. Smell was of a true lager, nice earthy, grassy notes from the hops and a slight malt sweetness. Taste was full and crisp with a good finish that fizzes on the tonuge."
"Poured a nice straw color with decent head, but little lacing. It has a nice refreshing scent, with an actual burst of maltiness. Good taste for a mass-produced lager, clean and crisp with a bit of maltiness, although very little in overall taste. Goes down very smoothly, it was a nice quaffable beer to go with my shepard's pie."
"D - Outstanding, this could be a great session brew or summer beer, I can actually say I'll be revisiting this one. I'm not sure how it compares in bottles though, so I'll have to research that one as well. Worth trying."
"Overall: A nice beach vacation lager. Better than Grolsch. Not nearly as solid as my memory from '99 in the motherland, but then again my palate has matured considerably since then (but I see other reviewers also hinting at a demise...). Good with brie and french bread."
"Well to say the least, I was quite suprised by this one because I did not expect much. Quite drinkable."
"M/D: i could drink this all day, its by far a step above the macro examples, but not so far beyond that you'll crave it"
"Carbonation was nice at least, giving it a somewhat smooth, crisp feel. But I just couldn't drink this beer much longer."
"Overall, not a fan of this one. That flavor i get just doesnt sit well. I dont think it is a bad bottle, but this is the only one i have had of this beer, so it could be."
"Drinkability- Refreshing but nothing out of the ordinary."
"A solid and slightly unusual Euro macro."
"clear light gold with no real retention, but left a surprising nice bit of lace on the glass. i thought it smelled really nice. nice malty scent - kind of pilsish with some stinky euro hop. taste wasn't quite as good as the nose suggested, but was okay for sure. light bodied and just slightly off dry. easy drink, and i'd rather have one of these than a beck's (who tennent's is in cahoots with) any day of the week."
"Light gold, almost U.S. macro-yellow. Smells of dry maltiness with a hint of sulphur, surprisingly not unlike a continental pilsner. First taste reminds me of beers like Beck's, Peroni, Stella and their ilk, which is not bad considering this is from a land of ales. Firm, brisk light breaded malt just off-dry. Not much finish, yet reminiscent of younger days walking the streets with my open container in hand. There is a slight sweet grain character as I go along. A good effort considering its origin, but not something I would reach for in favor of a good German pils/helles/export, or a Czech pilsener. But that assessment wouldn't surprise many people."
"pours a clear golden color with a two finger white head that holds fairly well with some light lacing. cooked veggie with a slight hop aroma. typical lager taste, slightly bready malt with cooked veggie that gets a little stronger as the beer warms. mouthfeel medium and carbonation ok. a plain light lager nothing special very easy to drink. price was a little high, i think i would look for something else at $9.99 a six pack."
"Nothing really remarkable about the taste. Maybe a little sweeter than others and the hops are weak. It has a light body and finishes crisp but my bottle may have been a little flatter than most. A decent Euro lager but nothing I would go in search for."
"Drinkability: easily drinkable and refreshing. Nothing overly special, but nevertheless, a nice Euro lager."
"Nothing particularly exciting about it, but has a certain unique character about it for the style. A decent choice for an easy ""no-brainer session"" brew. Not bad for a green-bottled Euro-lager."
"D Â– This is an easy to drink beer Â– I think it would make a good session brew."
"Flavor is very light, a touch of malt backbone with lighter hops flavors as well. Slight sweetness, a little bit dry at the tail end. Very light overall, but a decent sipper."
"Overall not a bad session beer."
"Lite but very smooth lager. Very easy to drink more than one."
"The aroma concerned me, freakinÂ’ euro skunk and cooked veggies, but the quaff brought this one back to drinkinÂ’ status. Lite taste of malted wheat made for an enjoyable bottle. Body was smooth, crisp and dry. If not for the import price, IÂ’d have it again. But with the price, IÂ’ll stick to local lagers."
"Deep golden body topped by a 1.5"" head. The head slowly fades and leaves patchwork lacing on the glass. Aroma - almost none. Typically what you may expect from a lager, but a bit of noble-like hop aroma does come through a little. Almost peppery in nature. Flavor is sweeter than expected, with just a hint of bitterness. Sweetness lingers on the palate juts a bit. Maybe just my imagination, but I can almost taste a hint of peatiness in there a swell, like drinking the melted ice out of a long finished glass of scotch or bourbon. I have had a few Dorts that exhibit a similar sweetness (Great Lakes used to be sweeter than it is now, for example.) Mouthfeel is solid. Carbonation is a bit restrained for the typical lager. Drinkability is actually pretty good. I expected something like Heineken, but it's much better than that. Surprisingly, I like this beer."
"12 ounce slim grrr-een bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Has the euro-typical golden yellow in color, a creamy white head that dissolves into patchy lacing noticed throughout the course of this ale. Light hops and musty/earthy notes, some grains also indicated on the nose. The mouthfeel is a touch bitter, with some over-dominating grainy sweet malts, with lingering carbonation. The body is definitely light, but not in the flavor department. Above average for the style and worth a go!"
"This beer pours a translucent color with a terrific effervescing process. The head is not large, and dies down quickly. The smell is light and mostly just has the wheat taste that is synonymous with lagers. The taste does little to differentiate itself from other euro lagers that I've had, except for a hint of sugar toward the end of it that are especially apparent when it warms up. I would say this is a good example of the style, but of course there are a myriad of others."
"Not bad compared to other beers of this style."
" Bottom Line: Pretty good, a scottish beer that did not not me down, and I would reccomend it to anyone. Ta Ta"
"At Pourhouse 50. Light yellow, lot of lace. A tad floral aroma.Some yeast taste, on the funky side,but otherwise another Europe light lager session ale.A bit of grassy hops, not all that quaffable. A bit of grain in a medium mouthfeel. Rather bland but passable."
"D- No chance, its 1 pint then you are totally bloated. Absolute rubbish!"
"I will drink lager, especially in the summer months it can be a nice alternative to a pint of heavy. However I cannot understand why this is even being sold, far less a popular drink. For lagers try Grolsh, Stella or 1664, or any of the other european lagers as they are far superior."
"A nice effort with very good drinkability."
"Tennent's Lager pours a medium yellow with a fluffy white head from a green 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is mild, maybe a little malt is noticeable. Malt is most noticeable in the flavor, balanced nicely by mild hop flavors. Definitely a step up from the average lager. Sessionable."
"I don't like lagers, but this one is done very well & is dangerously drinkable. Easily the kind of beer where a six pack intended to be stretched over several days could disappear in a night."
"poured a very pale golden color with small white head and a good amount of very sticky lacing. Smells of skunky malt and grain. Flavor is very light, just a touch of hops and not much else. Tasted skunky at first, but I believe that was just due to the aroma. When I didn't inhale as I took a sip, the skunk taste was not there. Light bodied with a dry finish."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color with a sticky white head that laces the glass. Nose is a nice malty lager aroma. Taste is all lager. Pretty straight forward and simple but not bad. Overall a decent brew for what it is but nothing I will be rushing out to get again."
"D - It is fairly drinkable. I would like to try another, in case I just had a bad one. Darn green bottles!"
"Final Statement: Better than the big name euro lagers, but still not a repeat buy in Nova Scotia, as we only sell it in singles, I'd be likely to buy a case of it, but I won't pay the money they charge here for it on a consistant basis. It's worth a try."
"11.2 ounce green bottle. Pours a golden straw color with a nice fluffy head and sticky lacing. Sweet malty aroma with some floral hops in the background. Taste is on the sweet side with just a little hop bitterness and a medium to light body. Just a decent average euro lager."
"D: Drinkable, I'd recommend it to people who drink nothing but American macro lagers"
"Had this on-tap several times during our tour of Scotland. Beer poured a golden color with a beautiful head. Nose was of malts and little else. Taste suggested malts and pale hops and not much else. Mouthfeel was very smooth but it was very light bodied. This was a sessionable beer and OK to try."
"Mouthfeel was excellent. Crisp, clean and smooth going down. Makes this little guy an excellent addition to my lager list. I would and will drink this one again. Hell, I might even do it now."
"D: One could easily drink several of these, but I suspect that is the point at a sacrifice of taste. Meh, I did keep sipping the beer, more because I have already had a few and it reminds me of my college days of crappy beer..."
"Pours a medium golden yellow with a fairly large and thick pure white head that dissipates pretty slowly and leaves solid lacing. One of the nicest looking lagers I've seen in a while. Smell is pretty routine though, malts and grains with that lovely little green-bottle skunk aroma sitting in the background. Tastes is better though, with only the faintest hint of grain accompanying the spicy maltiness which is the dominant flavour, and a bit of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, not bad at all, and drinkability is good. Not a bad little lager."
"This is just your standard, mostly tasteless lager that you can buy anywhere in the store. Ah well. At least I got a nice glass from the Winking Lizard."
" There's nothing wrong with this moderately good easy drinking light lager. Lawnmower, session, or whatever.."
"D: I have been trying a lot more of these yellow fizzy beers lately, it doesn't mean I am getting a taste for them, but this one is pretty decent and would be another I'd have with Pizza."
"Taste is particularly subdued. Very watery, very little flavour. Not much to the mouthfeel. I suppose I wasn't expecting a great deal from this one, but even still, it disappointed."
"Well,...a pretty good beer that caught me completely off guard. Just picked an arbitrary beer off of the list that I have never had before. Expectations were low when the green bottle arrived at my table. The lightly golden brew was actively carbonated and retained a fair foamstand. Smells lightly malty, grainy, hoppy, and with a modest light-striken aroma. Flavors hit home. Graininess and huskiness was surprisingly low. A moderate pilsner malt base hosted a decent helping of noble hops to deliver an earthy, hop flavor and bitterness. Light oatmeal like textures really smoothed the brew out. Finishes light, refreshing, and quite clean. It won't knock your socks off, but it's certainly worth a try."
"Notes: While the mix of flavors is disturbing to me I could see how folks could enjoy this for session material."
"Very smooth and drinkable with more taste than some lagers."
"No, this wasnÂ’t a good beer."
"In the flavor, the hop profile (with some lemon) steps up and dominates the nice crisp clean malts. Oddly enough (for me), the hops hit my palate first, and the malts are present at the finish, during the swallow. For me, beer flavors hit me almost always the other way. Makes this a refreshing beer, even if it isn't terribly complex or something that makes me want to come back again soon."
"Not my favorite brew, but still a good beer. It has a nice golden appearance and a nice hoppy smell. I like the clean taste it has and it's mouthfeel is also nice. I've also had this in the bottle and it's not near as ""clean tasting"" as off tap (yes I know that's true of many beers). The bottle does ruin the tast of this one, though. I rate it pretty high on drinkability... that's on tap. Drinkability is reduced to probably a 3.0 if by bottle. Yep, the bottle does that much ""damage""."
"Though there are slight vegetal flavors in this beer, the decent hop profile makes up for it. Ive had a few skunked samples that were terrible, though fresh ones are decent and worth a try."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and smooth pale malt flavor that seems a bit sweet as well as bitter. It has a slight green bottle skunk, but it only enhances the aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a silky smooth pale and Vienna? malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter with a mild skunkiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Euro lager. It's smooth and flavorful; a real treat."
"Pours clear pee yellow from the crummy green bottle, with a nice head for what it's worth. Obnoxious skunky aroma. The taste was on par with most of the rest of its Euro lager brethren. Very mild malt and hop flavors mix with the obligatory skunk to make a combination of sweetness and astringency that quickly cloys. A wholly unremarkable beer. I would not drink this again."
"Tap: Poured a clear golden color lager with a nice medium white foamy head with great resistance. Aroma of crisp hops and light floral malt is quite pleasant. Taste is full of crisp hops with a fuller body then expected. Floral notes and light bitterness makes this quite enjoyable for the style. Also, I would suggest avoiding the bottle for this one since it doesnÂ’t seems to do it justice."
"SlÃ inte!"
"This is not a bad beer. It just lacks the depth and character of other European lagers. Okay but not great."
"Pours light gold with a small white head. Strongly skunked aroma! Taste is surprisingly sweet and malty... would probably be pretty good if not for the skunkiness. Wouldn't mind trying one of these from a brown bottle... not sure why some brewers insist on using green bottles! Decent mouthfeel, but the smell kills the drinkability for me!"
"I'd drink it if someone offered it to me, but I woudn't go out of my way to buy it. I've had much, much worse."
"Drinkability Â– This boring effort at the style probably wasnÂ’t as bad as I made it out to be, but IÂ’m a real fan of the style so this was a let down. I finished it but would definitely not buy again."
"Not really good, but I have a feeling that if you can find it on tap, it might be better."
"Light golden colour with a dense, bright white head. Nice head retention with a smattering of lace. Crisp aroma with some light malt sweetness. The flavour was malty sweet with slightly spicy hops and a soft bitterness. Sweetish finish that is fairly clean. Medium light body."
"The taste was very smooth with a nice malty start and finishes with a nice hops bitterness and slight dryness."
"M&D: heavier than normal for a lager, but smooth and quenching."
"Very crisp with an almost anise taste to it. A mild hop finish polishes off this pleasant lager. Highly drinkable, this one goes down almost too easily."
"Has an interesting flavor for a lager, heaver then expected with a slight Carmel taste somewhat like Bass ale. Had a full mouth feel without being thick. Went down real good. A person could drink a few of these on a warm day or watching a football game."
"Tastes of an ordinary beer. Good light feel in the mouth with no serious after effects. This has a light beer appearance with a good kick. It is hard for me to judge since I love a darker beer, but this is a great hot weather afternoon type sipper. Not the best, but at least something different from the mainstream."
"Not bad, and very easy to drink, but there are much better beers out there"
"Taste is the typical crisp light malt from a eurolager. But it does have a bit of body and some hop profile. Lightly spicy and fruity. Light and crisp with a refreshing light hops aftertaste. If it wasn't for that skunk you get in your nose each time you lift the glass for a sip, this would be a pretty solid macro-lager. As it is, it's OK (maybe better on draft?) but nothing worth revisiting."
"Drinkability is average."
"Mouthfeel is almost creamy, not as watery as I expected."
"The taste wasn't so bad. It went down nice and easy. I aquired this stuff rather cheaply, so I can't complain too much. In fact, if it were served extremely cold on a hot summer day, it would probably be desirable. As it is, it's lacking character."
"I mst remember to buy more Tennent's when I'm in the mood to revisit a tasty lager from my past."
"Appearance: Pours a pale golden with a white frothing head very nice, solid even rings of lacing form with each sip. Aroma: Nice sweet maltier than your typical lager with a nice floral dosage of hops, not typical of lager in my mind I tasty session brew enjoyed at Piper's Pub. Taste: Sweet crisp slight bitterness in finishes very clean nice beer. Mouthfeel: Light to medium body, slightly syrupy in texture. Drinkability: Solid session ale to be enjoyed by the imperial pint."
"a fine example of how a lager should present itself, tennents lager is one i keep coming back to when im in the mood for the style. its not easy to come across in oz, but when i do im always compelled to grab some just to remind me of how pleasing a lager can be when the situation calls for it."
"I was surprised this wasn't lightstruck and skunky because of the green bottle. I must have received a fresh batch and it turned out for the better because this is a good beer to use as a thirst-quencher or to wash down some hot food. This was a decent surprise altogether, because instead of getting a skunky Euro-lager, this turned out to be a good, clean, crisp and refreshing lager."
"Light gold color, large white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Medium bodied lager. Light and refreshing. Slightly hoppy, malts evident. Nice and crisp taste. Mouthfeel is full and smooth . Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is smooth, slightly bitter."
"Pours up a light clear golden colour, mild carbonation, and a big foamy white head. This stays for half of the glass before falling to a decent cap which also leave intermittent lacing. Nose contains sweet grainy malt, almost bready, with a slight floral hop presence. Flavour is grainy and metallic, mild hop finish. Creamy full mouthfeel for a lager, a bit oily. Very satisfying. As far as lagers go, this is what I first reach for aside from Charlie Flint's Original Lager from Alley Kat."
"Pours with a white head that stays, leaving a some lace. Light-medium carbonation. Pale golden color, light bodied, starts malty/hoppy, finishes hoppy. Nose seems like it is skunked but it isn't. Malty hoppy flavor improves as it warms. Smooth finish. The ABV on the bottle is 4.0%."
"A quite drinkable beer indeed.."
"This beer pours a darker yellow (slightly amber) color with a nice bit of carbonation, but a small head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma has hints of maltyness and just a tiny bit of skunkiness to it. The flavor reminds me of really cheap domestic beer such as Coors or something like Rolling Rock. Kinda skunky taste. Not a fan of this one."
"Tennent's is not the best beer I've ever had but it is drinkable. The light flavor makes it a good sesion beer as well as a dinner beer with spicy foods. I wanted to like it more than I did so I was a little disappointed."
"Pours golden amber in color with a thick and creamy white head that loves to stick all over the glass as it dissipates into a heavy lace. Nose is light malts and mildly spicy hops. Very light in body with a very soft carbonation. Taste is mostly malt sweetness but there is a touch of hop bitterness towards the finish. An easy drinking crisp and refreshing lager and a definite step up from the macros."
"This one pours a clear golden with minimal orange tint. The head is thick and lively and well lived with some lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is subtle and sweet with a spicy/woody hop nose. The taste is a very good lager. The sweetness of the malt is perfectly balanced with the hops leaving a clean mouth with a subtle rise of hops on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a very satisfying lager and I am glad I got it."
"Color is a off pale golden yellow with a fluffy white head that got about two fingers high but faded fast to leave little lacing effect and just skimmed into a misty, bubbly top. Smell is mostly light malt thats soft and clean with a bit of grainyness lingering in the back. Taste starts slightly sweet, delicate in its acidity, with spotty hops and the finish going into dryness. Feel is light bodied and thin but is pretty drinkable, not bad, but good be better."
"Tennent's Lager is a good beer to drink cold on a hot day. Appearance-wise it is a pale yellow with a fine white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma and taste are similar to Heineken lager, which I'm not that crazy about, but Tennent's has more body which makes it work! It's good enought that I've been a repeat buyer, which says something. Overall, a nice session beer."
"A decent, solid lager."
"OK, I know I'm not supposed to like this beer. The export's not what it is at the home tap, the bottle's the wrong color, and it has that skunky smell on most opens. Still, I keep going back to this when I just want a nice lager for eating or when it doesn't matter what the flavor is because I'm not reviewing it. The appearance is a pleasant, light-ish golden hue, and the head is fluffy white, if not long-lasting. It does usually have the skunk, but maybe that's not a problem for me because of the taste. I like the background alcohol taste that blends with the very light hops overlay. Frankly, it quenches and pleases. What else is really important?"
"The typical translucent golden color I expect form a lager, the head modest, white In color, the texture frothy with decent lace to cover the glass. Nose all malt, lightly sweet as is the start, top slim in feel, with the finish mild in its acidity, the hops sparse and the aftertaste dry. Mediocre at best and drinkable I guess, but not something that appeals to me only once every 3 years when I re-sample, but that may change as my list is to big, a beer that is destined be added to the Â“Dead BeerÂ” database along with all American macroÂ’s."
"The beer poured a light golden color but had good foam that left nice lace down the glass. The aroma was lager-like with a light hop and malt smell. The taste was a bit light, but good: nicely hopped with the malt coming through. The mouthfeel was good, with light carbonation. The drinkability was very good."
"I was pleased to find this at my local store. I admit, I was expecting something a little stronger. Pours light in color with hardly any head. Taste is quite grainy, but surprisingly smooth. Very slight hop taste. Malt flavor was almost non-existant. A little fruitiness evident in the aftertaste. I would call this the ""Budweiser Of Scotland"" being a far cry from Mcewan's Scotch Ale. It doesn't even compare to the European macros. I can only hope it is better on tap. Glad to try it though!"
"I was really surprised by this! I was expecting a thin and bland generic lager but found something that had more body, some hops, and was remotely interesting! It pours a deep golden body with a creamy bright white head that holds exceptionally well and leaves some nice lace throughout the pint. The bouquet, however, is only of the ""generic beer"" type with a light touch of hop thrown in. Still, it's way above average! The body is (surprisingly) firmly malty in the Scottish tradtition. Very well done! The flavor offers a rich and sweetish maltiness, a very mild fruitiness, and some hop flavor towards the finish which is semi-dry with a lingering malt characteristic. Quite the charmer! Worth trying if only to see what Scotland's best selling lager is like!"
"clear golden in color. adequate foamy head which dies quickly, leaving a bit of lace. a very light euro lager aroma, not skunky though. medium to light mouthfeel, smooth and creamy in the middle; somewhat crisp in the end. pretty grainy taste, bordering on astringent with a slightly spicy and earthy hop finish to balance. just an average euro lager but decent nonetheless."
"Appearance and mouthfeel are just average for this brew and these are the fine points, it is down hill from here. The taste can best be described as metallic/hollow and sorry. This test was from a cold offering, it might be better warm.....Will let others decide that one,"
"Tennent's Lager pours a golden colour (a bit pale) with white head that lasts very limited time. For a European-Style Pilsener i would say that this beer is quite impressive..."
"Pale golden color with a hugh fluffy head with big pockets that dissipated to a thin cap with lots of sticky lace.  Floral hops and malt nose.  Good lager taste with malt and hops with a very slight amount of sweetness and spice.  Light aftertaste with mild hops bitterness and malt sweetness."
"Clear gold color, little head that's just a skim in 20 seconds.  Hoppy and slightly skunky aroma.  Aroma adds to a slight skunk in the flavor, also hoppy with well-balanced but non-descript malts.  This brew is very similar to many mass marketed Euro-lagers that end up getting imported to the US, but with a fuller mouthfeel and less overcarbonation.  Middle of the road but drinkable in many instances."
"Another beer that tastes like Heineken but a little worse. Nothing really good or bad stands out about this Lager. Typical skunkiness can be expected."
"Some people (not refering to this site) totally trash on this beer. I like this one for what it is. As a light lager this is stuff is good beer. Light, malty, with a nice floral hop. Not something that I would walk a mile for but it does put a smile on my face and it is some EASY drinkin'. One thing though, with its light character it does have to be resonablly fresh. With the light green glass to does turn fast"
"Notes: A light yet refreshing lager. Still far superior compared to other light lagers, almost too drinkable as we could drink this all night long without complaint."
"Very pale in color gold/yellow.  Lasting white head and lace.  Not huge by way of smell.  Very malty sweet taste.  Great smooth mouth.  Above average for the style."
"They may makes some good ales in Scotland, but they sure as hell can't brew good lagers, really thin and watery and edgy aswell, tried this once and will never try again."
"Decent drinking lager with the balance tipping toward the malt side. Fine lace adorned this deepstraw beauty. Overall nothing offensive in this brew, drinkable, could use a touch more hop finish, but a good beer as light lagers go."
"A decent lager, more flavorful than it's American counterparts."
"Slightly more assertive than your average lager."
