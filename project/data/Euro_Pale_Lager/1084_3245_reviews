"Cool bottle but hardly stuff of the gods, barely better than the usual faux lager"

"First sip in Santorini May 2005 with Mai, Shipp, Debby."
""
""
"This drinks like so many Pilsner styles from Europe, with a bit of cracker, rice, light cereal malt and that all too often skunk. Easy to drink, to the point of watery it's a decent pairing with a Gyro."
"Only remotely decent thing about this beer is the look."
"Better than budweiser or miller lite."

"Im not a fan of American pale OR India pales, so this was a pleasant change. First two sips I didn't like. A bit ashy. But ended up enjoying the way it went down. Not too bitter. Not too heavy. Glad I had bought two! The taste gets better and better."

"Unappealing pale yellow colour. Tastes faintly of cigarette ash. Probably more enjoyable in a hotter climate."
""
"Taste was sweet, no bitterness, was fairly smooth to drink, and a teeny bit strong too. Recommended."
"Overall: another cheap Euro lager that doesn't really make the grade on aroma, flavour or feel. There are better lagers for less than $45 a case too."
""

""
"Enjoy"

"Palate-  A light bodied beer with medium carbonation.  A different flavor of a lager, I would drink this again."

"Bottle at the Macon, GA. Greek Festival. Pours yellow with a white head. Aroma of hops, grain and grass. Tastes of grass, grain, and very slightly floral. Light bodied and refreshing. Went well with my Spankopita and Dolmada. Opa!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Luckily, I was served a bottle that had not skunked yet. Not much there to taste otherwise. Cold grainy fizz to wash down some fried smelt. In that sense, I have no complaints."
""
""
"A few years since I've had this one, This time it was the only local bottled beer in a restaurant in Oia, Santorini. I found it hard to finish, and it had a funny aftertaste. So not a beer I'll be revisiting anytime soon!"

"Sat alfresco eating olives and potato chips drinking this beer in Greece ,pretty enjoyable not great , reminiscent of Gennesee Cream Ale ,maybe it was because of the green can too."

"Basic mass produced generic lager from Greece.  Had this poured out of the bottle into a pint glass in Santorini.  The appearance is actually quite inviting, it pours a consistent golden yellow with little head, very crisp look to it.  The taste is a little sour, it's basically the beer they have in most bars in Greece that's easy to get.  The nose isn't so hot, smells a little sweet which was strange.  Not so hot."

"Pours a light golden amber with a quite nice one finger pure white head with good retention and lacing. Aroam on opening of pure skunk, with light sweet malt and hints of grassy hops underneath. After sitting in the glass a more typical Euro pale / adjunct light sweet malt and grain aroma. Flavor of subdued sweet malt, starting with faint biscuit malt and developing a bit more sweet malt, finishing light with a hint of hop bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Very lightly flavored, but did not seem watered down, simply lightly malted. The flavors that are present are quite nice, but really does not stand out in any way. A mild, simple pale ale. Good and unobtrusive with a meal. Not my style, but pleasant enough. Green bottle, booo."
""
""
""
"O- Average lager. more hop character than an AAL, but mass produced and made for chugging. Just how most of Europe like their beer."
"I bought this Greek beer at the Friar Tucks in Savoy, Illinois. It pours fizzy yellow, with two fingers sized white head, and plenty of lacings and carbonation. It has relatively little aroma, a metallic taste, with strong notes of malt and wheat. It has a light body with no edge or bite, malt after taste, and is not filling."
""
""
""

"Got this bottle from a co worker who was ranting and raving about this beer...we definitely have different tastes in beer, and this is just a nasty brew. Very generic, watery taste..taste like an over produced beer not ranking much higher than a domestic in my book. Never again."
"Adjunct lager all the way...what can ya say....washed down a meal at a local Greek diner well, enough but not much going on beyond that"
""
""
""
"Alright beer overall but not worth expensive price"
""
""
""

"Light in taste, and together with teh carbonation makes it a great refreshment, but that's just it. No more to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is really good compared to some of the euro lagers."
""
""
"The price on this one has exploded from 8.99 to 11.99 for a mere SIX PACK, which is absolutely nuts... not sure what to think anymore, other then... going in a different direction until they wise up and bring the price down."

"To the Point: I didn’t like this beer on the first couple of sips; the more I sipped - the more l liked it; it still is only an okay lager but, on a hot summer day and it is today – it is refreshing if nothing else and looking at those flavors I mean nothing else."
"Not bad if it is used as a summer thirst quencher. Actually it gets better as it warms up, and it has no off-flavors."
""
""
"O:I was at a Greek restaurant that I enjoy. Next time I know to order the wine!"
""
""
""
"Overall typical ""imported premium-like pilsner", light skunk and sulfur, husk, typical pilsner characters, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pored into a 16 oz. goblet. Pours a bright golden color with a small, foamy head. Smells of grassy malts, bread. Taste is sweet Munich-type malts with mild, herbal hops. Clean, crisp carbonation with a light body. Nothing special, but very drinkable. A good summer-time lager."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but the artificial type of sweetness in the taste is a little strange."
"O: This beer is not offensive but definitely not great - there is a somewhat artificial sweetener flavor in there that seems to contribute the overall hints of sweetness to the beer. Light flavor and low alcohol makes this one pretty easy to drink but this one is a little too boring for me."

"A below average euro pale lager but not the worst."
""

"A good lager is what this is. From the green bottle we get a transparent honey colored bubbly with a head whiter than Santa's beard. The smell is refreshing, yet not over powering leaving the nostrils in a mystery after tracing pieces of hops in the air. I get a long finish with this brew and content with the massage tracing my throat. A lager is a lager, but this one is above the grain. It is a mystery how a country can deal with fiscal responsibility, but it is not a myth that the Greeks can fathom a few feathers of thought toward providing a brew worldwide."

"Poured this Euro Pale Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. 2nd attempt at a Greek Lager...Poured a cloudy golden yellowish color, produced a small white head, poor retention and left minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of grain and the classic Euro Skunk. Light in body, this euro pale lager had a foundation of malted grain, then dominated by the ""Skunk"". There is some citric hop flavor at the finish- which is also dry. Overall, its the better of the two Greek beers that i tried but not something I would ever order again. The Greeks should stick to the Pitas and the Gyros. Prost!"
"Light, crisp, sweet, honey, lager. It pours pretty light, without much carbonation. And what little head it does have, dissipates pretty quickly. Fortunately that doesn't effect the flavor, because I do like it. It's nothing special, but overall it's good to drink. Especially on a hot summer day, or at Greekfest."
""
""
""
"D - not bad, it is a pretty standard euro lager with a watered down pilsner flavor.  Better than bud, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing extraordinary about this beer. It is your typical lager, not as bitter as one would expect but it does go well with Greek food. I would drink it over an amstel or heineken. The color is a bit darker than your average lager and the flavor is a bit fuller but average overall."
""

"Pours pale straw in color, very transparent, with a healthy white head. Vigorous carbonation can be observed frolicking throughout. Aroma smells of cheap beer and some skunk. Flavor is so mild that it's difficult to discern what's there. There's probably some variety of grain, a little alcohol, and maybe some hops. The tongue experiences the carbonation more than anything. One of the lightest beers I've ever tasted, and that's saying something living in a country that's filled to the brim with light beers. This is a rare case where simply trying a single bottle feels like a complete waste of time, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider this might be the case when I bought it. I guess there's a reason Greece isn't known for its beer."

"Overall a decent enough lager, refreshing and thirst quenching. Its a slightly above average euro lager."
""
""

"Overall - If your not in Greece on vacation, there really is no need to buy this beer anywhere else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting body on this beer, but not in a good way. I wouldn't go near this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 2.88, a C. This is far from the worst beer I've ever had, and a fresher sample might prove more enjoyable... but this is not something I will go out of my way to try again. A brew most people would probably be better off skipping."
""
""
"O: Clean and refreshing, I thought this was a decent lager."
""
""
""
"Pretty boring."
""
""
"O- It's a generic pale lager. Not much better or worse than Heineken et al."
"O - Absolutely terrible. I couldn't finish it. Never again."
"O: Pretty average Euro Lager - nothing I would bother with again."
"A decent beer with a pale appearance, moderate head and lacing. Light Czec style pils aroma. Clean malt taste with sazz type finish. Light feel with a crisp finish. A nice lawn mower beer and a good one for large barbeque as it is clean, crisp and refreshing. Not the one to grab for a night of flavor exploration but hey there are plenty of those as well. A good step above BMC style brews."
"A bog standard macro lager - OK for a hot climate. Taste could be cleaner, but this probably isn't a problem if it's served cold. There are plenty of better beers out there - pass on this."
"O-Average EPL,plus on appearance."
"O: This is a favourite for Swedes vacationing on any Greek island, and it's easy to see why - it doesn't intimidate anyone - here's no skunk, and you could drink loads of it by the pool. Right now it's doing me good after a long day of Swedish summer - the only thing missing is a great Greek salad with a lot of olive oil and feta cheese."
"Creamy. Right out of the bottle, it feels like a slice of lime, like a Carlsberg or Heineken. Pale yellow transparent. Entry into mouth quiet first, followed by a slightly grassy hop ending, finally, finish with a somewhat bitter but far from being truly exceptional. Just as nice lager but nothing more."
"Big thanks goes out to Greece and their fine select choices! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grain, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, wheat, and slight fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was blah, plain and simple. This thing reminded me of a Greek version of Budweiser if I am honest only fruit was added. By fruit I don't mean like Bud Light Lime... Just not good in any aspect. I should have been tipped off by the aroma, but I never listen as I am a glutton for punishment. The group of us collectively drainpoured this one."
"One of the better lagers in my comparison."
"The beer pours a pale fizzy gold, crystal-clear, and is capped with a scant white froth. The nose is slightly sweet with hint of corn and alcohol, and is basically just beer-y. The taste offers no surprises, it is moderately sweet, replete with light grain flavors, toasted corn and earthy herbal minerals. It surprises me how even the swill of a place like Greece is substantially better than the K.O.Bs.; I guess it shouldn't."
"Food match: Saganaki was a game, set & food match for me. I could also see a Souvlaki going down a treat... in fact I would mix this drop with pretty much any Greek cusine you can think of. Yiamas!"

"I would say this is a good beer if you are gonna eat mousaka, lamb kabobs and just go whole hog deep greek."
"Sit back watch the Aegean sunset and guzzle a few"
"when had fresh, even in america. if i had a case, i'd squeeze some lemon on it."
"Overall – Another unremarkable beer that doesn’t really stand out in any way. I’m not even sure I could recommend this as a lawn mower beer because it doesn’t have that refreshing and crisp flavour to it that some of its competitors do. I wouldn’t buy this beer again."
"Its like a heinken but not as much of a bite. Very little aftertaste. Not bad for a greek beer. Not sure if I would drink several of these. Color was heinken color, smell was exactly like heinken too. But not as much kick. 4.7% alcohol content. I thought it would be a little bit stronger especially at 5 bucks a bottle."
"While not exactly ""good," this is fairly inoffensive & doesn't do any harm. I have a feeling this is a ""context beer."" This might fit a little better in the context of my town's huge Greek food festival in June. In the context of sitting in my home on a January evening, drank with a critical eye, it doesn't really hold up. That said, if given no alternative I could drink several of these & not be any worse for wear."
"This is an all-malt, green-bottled Euro lager from Greece, so it's a rarity of sorts. It is an exceptionally clear, pale yellow with a solid white lacing. This lager brings a hint of cooked corn and hops with a side of grassiness in the nose. It gives a smooth and refreshing mouthfeel. This beer has a hint of sweetness, but a dry malt palate throughout. Dried grass comes to mind, with a bit of bread as well. The hops show more bitterness than flavor, and some cooked veggie flavors show up in the dry finish. This lager has a bit more life compared to the typical fizzy yellow lager. This one is worth a go."
"But the Eagles are getting asses handed tothem and the Packers look unrelenting. So my good mood has changed and the beer is backto what it is. Water."
"Easy drinking lager, better than most of the Italian lagers I tried."
"Drinkability: Quite good for accompanying a simple meal. After trying it alone I had it with a roast chicken and oven-cooked potatoes. I could drink a couple; not that it thrills me but it's not insulting in any way either."
"Pours a golden straw color with a minimal white head that fades quickly without much lacing. No lacing in the end. The nose is ligh grain and some German Helles characteristics. It's too bad skunked hops cover everything up. Feel is light and skunky with high carbonation. I could not finish this one."
"Nothing noteworthy with this insipid brew - while not a light beer, it certainly called to mind Bud Light - rather thin body, sweet, adjunct malt and light hopping. This is my first from a Greek brewery, and I hope those in that country have better choices than this."
"D - Decently drinkable but nothing fantastic."
"I was in a Greek restaurant and ordered this because it was on the menu. I was not at all familiar with this beer. Brought to me in a 12 oz bottle with pint glass. Poured very clear, mildy yellow, very bubbly. Lots of fizz on top that settled quickly into no head. Lots of carbonation. No lacing to speak of. I took a big whiff and had a hard time getting a real good sense of the smell. Not a bad smell...just very mild. Some sweet aroma, no hops to speak of. The taste was, well, nonexistent. I was really trying to get a good handle on the taste, but it had no taste. I only got a hint of malty sweetness. No aftertaste, no bitterness. Light, fizzy mouthfeel. I suppose this could be considered drinkable because of the very mild flavor and light mouthfeel. I could probably drink a dozen of these with all my facilities fully in check. I suppose I'd drink this again, but not at Disney World prices, which is what I paid because I didn't know any better. *note* - my wife asked why I didn't check BA on my phone before ordering the beer."
"Not a bad lager. It has a good amount of flavor and isn't very watery. It has a dry finish, but very slight sweetness when going down."
"D - Average beer, glad I tried it especially since I was at the Greek festival."
"Drinkability is not bad. Cold, this one is fairly refreshing, but I'd rather drink one of the other euro lagers while here in Greece."
"Drink this in Greece. Maybe its nostalgia talking, but the American import lacks the depth of the Greek offering."
"D- a somewhat drinkable beer if you feel adventurous, i wouldnt make it a regular thing though."
"overall this could have been better but it is what it is right."
"Surprising. Sure, it won't pull Greece out of bankruptcy, but Mythos would make a good companion with Greek/Mediterranean cuisine."
"Overall- Glad I tried it but nothing special or unique about this beer compared to a dozen other lager beers that you run into. Definitely not a beer I would seek out or probably try again. I enjoyed having this beer at the Greek festival I attended and it paired very well with the gyro I drank it with."
"Drinkability: light and refreshing, but the grain thing is just too much for me. I'll not seek this one out again."
"I think this is an average lager, has the typical pale color, thin feel to it, not much of a head. Taste was average, but I didn't notice the ""skunkiness"" other reviewers mention. Just a bit of graininess, some citrus taste also. I could drink a few of these, it went well with a Greek dinner. Seems similar to other Euro pale lagers but without as much of a skunky aroma like Heineken."
"M/D: Thin and watery, but it has some kinda feel that makes it reasonably smooth/ the tiniest bit viscous. Chugable."
"Drinkability - This beer is definitely easy to drink. It went well with my Greek meal, and all-in-all it was a decent beer. Its weakness is the flavor. That bitter aftertaste is not all that desirable, and I like a beer that has a little taste at the end. I would, however, certainly drink it again."
"In short unexciting macro, greek style."
"D: Better than a macro like Budweiser or Miller, but still only a slight notch above."
"The smell is not very inviting but more like 'hmmm wonder if this tastes'. I must say for a warm day as today in Holland every beer tastes as long as it's served cold. During the tasting the beer is actually not bad at all, Far away some citruslike fruitsmell."
"The Greeks invented a lot of things but beer was not one of them; going by this national brand they evidently have no claim to having perfected it either. And apparently they're not too familiar with the concept of UV rays; I rather like this beer but the green bottle has got to go if it ever has a chance at being a truly palatable, pleasurable lager."
"Had a Mythos tonight with my Greek food at Skara Grill in WR. Poured from the bottle into a pilsner style glass. Decent sized head forms. A bit darker shade of yellow than most macro lagers. Plenty of carbonation. Smell was pretty average, mostly corn. Taste was actually decent. Noticeable amount of malt, and a clean and crisp aftertaste. Mouthfeel was bubbly and smooth. Drinkability gets decent marks in my opinion, as I have had much worse. I think this is a decent choice to pair with a cuisine, better than some Mexican or Asian lagers I have tried to pair with dinner. Definitely preferred this ice cold when it came to the table. Reminded me of my honeymoon in Greece, where Mythos was drunk everywhere, so maybe I am partial to this beer."
"D: Light in body and flavor, so not hard to drink."
"Easy to drink in warm surroundings when served really cold."
"Overall-inoffensive lager, I'd call it more of a euro pale than a helles by its profile. Not too impressive."
"D: Eminently drinkable. I downed pints of this during my trip to Greece. Seems to be the national beer if Greece. A very easy, unoffensive lager."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, ok tasting. I would have others of the style before opting for this one."
"D=Offered this where there were no alternatives, I wouldn't refuse to drink it again. But I would sure wonder why there are no alternatives. Drinkable--barely."
"this is a fine lager beer for a day of recovery after the ridiculousness of hard liver. a monstrous foam attempts to peak above the rim of the glass, but i play defense and prevent it from assaulting my counter. it appears innocuous, the color of an Irish plucked eyebrowline. malty aromas, very little hop presence, an interesting yeast profile. it is all malt and yeast in this one and the flavor is pretty one dimensional. for me, though, today it is the perfect beer to make sure that barley wines have not wrecked my palate forever. thanks, greece."
"Opa!"
"Drinkability> Won't have again."
"A light body and only a bit crisp on the tongue. Overall I wasn't really impressed by anything about this beer. The taste fell flat for the most part and it wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. I think some American counterparts would have been more refreshing and satisfying than this."
"D - The best part of the beer is the drinkability. It goes down smooth but with enough character to remind you that you are drinking a quality made Euro beer and not anything else. This is a pretty standard beer, but the first I've tried from Greece. They put a nice spin on the style though if I must say, try a bottle and you'll see. Worthy of a try at least."
"True to the style, it is boring. Somehow it deserves to lose some points for the lack of distinguishing characteristics. Yet, as I said, it doesn't do anything wrong."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0912-DanielleV"
"D: This could work on a warm greek beach in summertime. In cold wintery Sweden in mid-january, I don't think so."
"In reinforcing opinions from 3 others I proceeded to dump the remainder of the bottle."
"File this one under the 'typical Euro macro-lager' category for mediocre beer."
"to the best of my knowledge this is the first Greek beer I've ever had, for their sake I hope they have many others too choose from"
"D: Nothing special about this beer and the grainyness was to apparent."
"Drinkability: Easy to down with a solid taste. I would imagine this being a sort of PBR of Greece or something in the sense of each countries lager standards."
"Good appearance, typical for an adjunct. Smell was sweet, and seemed like it might have been just a little skunked. Not sure if this is normal for this beer, but I am looking at the green bottle disapprovingly. Taste is about what you would expect for an adjunct lager, clean and crisp, but a little watery. Mouthfeel is appropriate, but drinkability is definitely lacking."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, fruity, and spritzy. It actually is like a light champagne."
"Smooth beer that could use some more bubbles. It seems that some more CO2 would give that little bit more acidity and sharpen the faint traces of hops. A good one ice cold on a hot day in Greece but I'd be more inclined to cook with it rather then struggle to drink a sixer."
"T- Kind of a smokey pilsner taste, with some sweet caramel flavoring. Despite its overall rating, this is a solid beer. Nothing special but nothing bad."
"Funky."
"My first Greek beer. It was about what was expected."
"It's pretty drinkable. Maybe at a summer party when you're not thinking too much about what you're drinking. In all aspects, it reminds me a lot of other European lagers, but I wouldn't reach for it over others like Heineken or Grolsch. It's worth a try, just to say you've had it, but that's about it."
"D: Good especially in this hot Greek summer."
"Definitely overcarbonated. It reminds me of the beer from Utica Club or Genesee--just another national macro, this time from Greece."
"Drinkability: Not too good, but I'm sure it'd taste better under the proper conditions. Still, I remember tasting this long ago and not being impressed. Forgettable."
"Great restaurant, bad beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty underwhelming beer. I hope it isn't representative of the entire style."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is mild and sweet. Taste is crisp and malty with some sweetness. Feels great in the mouth and goes down very easily. Overall I found this to be an enjoyable beer."
"It's an interesting if underwhelming and fairly typical beer."
"D: Paired decently with the Shawarma I was having, but it didn't have any unique flavors to pique my interest."
"It's fairly forgettable, but fairly drinkable too. There isn't a whole lot of character here...but if you're in the mood for something inoffensive on a hot day you may reach for this."
"Overall, this tastes like a bad German pilsener, but really it just smacks of poor brewing. Not tasty, and not refreshing, not much to recommend."
"Tastes a lot like a Heineken. Refreshing and light-bodied with a bit of creamy mouthfeel. Overall, smoother and easier to drink than a Heiney; none of the skunky-sour aftertaste that you can sometimes get. Not bad, but nothing to write home about either. Good with a gyro, but what wouldn't be?"
"If you need to drink beer fast, this is a candidate. Very forgetable."
"I drank this beer everyday in Greece, and for a beach beer this is a lot better (and cheaper) than Corona or a lot of other lighter macro lagers."
"This beer did not meet my expectations."
"Overall - meh, I've had better and worse."
"Final Thoughts - Though nothing special, this beer was fun to try from the Greek market for an authentic Greek night."
"On the good side this beer does have a nice, easy drinkablity and mouthfeel. It a little watery but does not weight very much on the pallete."
"Overall: Not offensive by any means but kind of bland a little. Drink this cold because i found it the taste deteriorates as it warms."
"My scores are based solely on the 4.7% bottle but I descrbied both for reference."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pilsner and Munich malt scent that's a bit sweet along with a nice German hop aroma. The taste is average. It has a crisp pilsner malt flavor that goes down with some prickly carbonation. It has a German hop presence and a green bottle skunkiness to it. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with too much carbonation. This isn't a bad beer, however I'm not inclined to buy anymore."
"D: At just 4.7%, this paired very well with the stronger flavors of the Lebanese cuisine. I made sure to have at least 3-4 sips before the food arrived, stealthily scrawled some notes, then compared once the food and beer met up. A satisfying example of the style - would have again in the right setting (such as today)."
"Pours a golden yellow colored body, with a huge creamy white head, lasting, with okay lacing. Has a light strange aroma, maybe corn or something. Sweet. Has a watery palate, and a sweet taste, with that same corn from the aroma, in the flavor."
"Nothing particularly special, a plain, inoffensive Euro-lager, unless of course you're out and about and getting your Greek on (I know that has other connotations, but I'm strictly talking about their cuisine) and tolerable enough to have a few, that is if the retsina isn't quite doing it for you."
"Final Thoughts - This is one of those beers that I am sure is just the ""Generic Fallback"" beer of Greece. Nothing stands out or impresses and the beer is clearly meant to be guzzled down. It's not that it's a bad beer, it just leaves the pallet wanting something more. Maybe if I lived in Greece, it wouldn't be that bad, but the import cost for this beer makes it not worthwhile to buy again."
"Feel and Drinkability: I've never said this before, but this beer is wet...I mean the finish is very wet feeling, very watery. Carbonation isn't as high or as prickly as I thought it would be. It drinks like water, feels like water, tastes very watery... This is easy to drink, but it doesn't satisfy. Way overpriced. Don't go seeking this one out, its definitely not worth it. Those greeks better watch out, a beer like this might anger Dinoysis, and who knows what he'll do exact his revenge...."
"Not much that impresses or strikes me as remarkable."
"A new bottle i saw at the LCBO. Onto the review, pours out a nice light yellow color, with little laceing. Looks like a nice light lager. Smell was pretty good, nice floral hop aroma and a bit of skunk in the background. This tasted great! Goes down nice and smooth, with little hop bite, its just like velvet. Sometimes i just enjoy a light flavorful lager. Mouthfell is nice and full, perfect carbonation, like velvet. Drinkability is great, i have slammed mythos all night, and it was great. Great cheap beer!"
"Not as bad as I was expecting. I dare say it would taste a whole lot better if I was sitting in the sun with the Aegean in front of me."
"Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer pours a golden yellow color with a white head from an 11.2 ounce green bottle. The aroma is grainy and skunky. The flavor is grainy and there seems to be a touch of lemon like flavor. Not as bad as I feared, but not especially good."
"This is a typical mass produced lager beer intended to be consumed as a refreshment rather than beer. Pours a clear yellow color and has a very weak smell. The taste is very common and also weak with some metalic aftertaste. Too light to the mouth, over-dosed with CO2 to hide its mediochrity. I might drink a couple of these if I had nothing else to drink but that's it..."
"Pours a pale straw with a very bubbly white head that receded fairly quickly and left decent lacing. The aroma is pretty tame with some corn and light sweet malts. The taste is on the sweeter side of things as lagers go with a solid malt backbone with some typical lager grains as well. The mouthfeel is bubbly with a slightly unpleasant bitterness in the finish. This is pretty drinkable, especially while sitting on the beach in Crete, but I would put this on my recommended list."
"Pours clear light yellow with little white head. Smell - malty, sweet, grassy. Taste the same, a little too sweet. Lack of carbonation, feels too flat. It's drinkable I guess, but there is nothing special. I would have this on ocasion, but really, you can find much better lagers out there."
"Update: Oct 2011, holiday on Zante: again hads this beer in three forms (can, bottle, on-tap), refreshing but still boring!"
"I do not recommend."
"This one features a reasonable crystal malt backbone with a decent hop laden finish. This somehow tastes a little more authentic than most generic macro lagers. Too much carbonation to really allow the drinker to appreciate the flavor fully. This is not a bad brew but definitely not something you need to look out for. Natch."
"adio"
"D - Fairly typical for a European lager. By no means the worst, but certainly not worth buying a case."
"... if you are in Athens."
"Had a bottle at a local Greek restaurant with dinner. Not as distinctive as other Greek beers Ive had. It tastes like most other mass-produced European lagers; if you had hidden the bottle and told me it was a Bitburger or Amstel, I probably would have believed it."
"A: Nice blond lager, normal head, S: nice hop nose with a little malt, T: refeshing nice malt taste. D: perfect beer fot hot summer days. I expected a less tasty beer, better than most of canadian blond lager beer. perfectly recommandable."
"D: This is a smooth and refreshing beer that is easy to drink in multiples."
"As far as drinkability goes, it goes down easy. I would not recommend this to an Aficionado, but those who have yet to discover better beer may find this refreshing and enjoyable. I would not go out of my way to try this beer again. I have tried very hard not to let my love of hops and malt interfere with this review. But I enjoy and respect complexity and this beer had none. I would say a very average or below average for its style."
"Clear golden, corn syrup hue, finger high white head. Mildly carbonated, very slow. Some lacing sticks around. Smells a bit skunky, damp socks, perhaps malt. Taste is bitter, dry mouthfeel that lingers, comparable to a Stella with a dense body and texture I find in some euro lagers. I can appreciate one of these on a hot day or a steamy night but I wouldn't want to drink too many of them at one sitting. Really not much more I can say about this."
"D - Suitable for sitting on the beach and looking for simple refreshment and does go down smooth but nothing to write home about"
"I tried this beer on August 31, 2007 at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto. The beer poured a translucent gold colour with almost no head but a lot of effervescence. The aroma had hints of malt and wheat. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a high level of carbonation. The flavour was grassy with a hint of hops on the back of the tongue. This was a pretty forgettable beer, but knocked Greece off of my country list."
"D - Drinkable beer that would be fine on a hot summer day on a greek island but short of that I won't be revisiting it any time soon."
"Drinkability: Average. The Greeks seemed to be really proud of this beer. The woman on the ferry boasted how this was a great beer simply because it was made in Greece. After being pressured into trying it when I really wanted a Carlsberg, and adhering to my grandfather's axiom of ""always be bold, try new things Mike," I had a go. After suffering a sunburn and a killer thirst in the Delian sun, Mythos was just what the doctor ordered. But I wouldn't have it again unless I was in similar circumstances in Greece."
"Not a bad lager at all, better than most 'mass' produced lagers in the world. Has a good head, but retention is low... Aroma is of crisp dew grass and light skunky hops... Taste is refreshing with a touch of crispness. Some muddled flavours, average stuff."
"Not a foul beer, but certainly nothing to recommend itself. Donated by a close friend whose also proudly Greek. I imagine that it's listed as an expensive ""premium"" in a Greek restaurant, but don't take their word for it. It's basically a mediocre lager that gullible customers will leap on as an ""import."" But I'm grateful for the free refreshment either way."
"Drinkability: Another boring euro lager, but since it was available at the Greek restaurant I was at, it was a natural choice."
"Poured straw colored, 2 finger head that slowly melted away to a light lace. Smell was mild, some hops with citrus undertones, perhaps lemon. Not much stood out in the taste, the hop and the malts balanced fairly well, and the aftertaste was a light, hoppy linger on the tongue. Light carbanation and body, kind of a crisp taste. Good enough, drinkable enough, but it doesn't stand out in any way."
"Poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer was a nice golden color with spider lacing and a fine bubbly head. Smelled kinda skunky and tasted green to me with a bitter finish. I was not to pleased with this beer and will not buy again."
"There's no need to knock it this time around, there's nothing wrong---maybe it's a particularly fresh sample---but you don't need to knock yourself out to try this one. Ho meets hum in the land of Greece."
"Quite like an hell."
"Overall a medium beer, very easy to drink, but don't expect much from it."
"Slightly sweet slightly spicy taste. Smooth..unoffensive easy to drink..if fresh, a nice beer on a hot day"
"Light malt in the nose, almost wheaty, definitely grainy with a distinct skunky aroma that takes over. The taste is pale malt that starts off sweet, turns a bit skunky with some fizz and ends rather dry on the tongue. Nothing really special here, just another average lager of this style. Light body, easy drinker and that's about it."
"cheers"
"Very inoffensive brew- deliberately middle of the road, but still true to the style. Though not as flavorful as some helles, what can you really expect form a greek macro? Decent head retention, bright pour, sticky malt aroma. Easygoing hops not enough to counteract the malt, but this was expected. I didnt get any weird skunk or metallic tastes, though it was served at a greek restaurant, with good turnover. Drinkable, but not on my list of repeat brews."
"Smell was mostly grass, and I could tell before taking as sip that it was skunky. The taste was, sure enough.. skunked! Very watery too, with a touch of hops and straw. Maybe I'd enjoy this in Santorini, but only because I'd be on the beach enjoying a fantastic view."
"Munich Helles?"
"D - Not bad, not great. Not really anything special."
"DI wouldnt have this again. I tried it on a whim since I was having Gyros"
"This brew pours a pale golden color with an enormous head that recedes very slowly into nice lacing. The aroms is of soft malts with a faint noble hop presence. The taste is a lot like the aroma, but with a noticable metalic flavor which is quite unpleasant. The mouthfeel is rather light bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this would be a decent beer if not for the metalic taste. That being said I will not buy this beer again."
"While not necessarily noteworthy, there's nothing offensive here. I saw green bottle and thought skuny, adjuncty euro-lager, but this is indeed a decent approximation of a helles. If I'm ever in Greece I know there's at least one local drinkable beer."
"drinkability: easy drinking but not good"
"Overall, this beer is not to bad. Can be refreshing but quite pricey."
"I dont recall ever having a beer from Greece. This one pours a clear yellow color with a beautiful frothy head. The head is stable, and leaves intricate lace all the way to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is a let-down, however. Theres a core of cereal grain, with a little grassiness and a euro-lager sulfur hop smell. The aroma is, though, a little faint. The taste is modestly sweet, with a background of graininess. Its light bodied, and very carbonated. A little more substance in the mouthfeel wouldnt hurt this beer. The finish is a little sweet and lingering. I wouldnt go out of my way for this one."
"A friend brought this from Greece and said it was her favourite beer of her trip. Poured a pale straw yellow, and started with a half inch creamy white head, which dissipated very quickly, leaving a small ring and no lacing. Smell of malt, what seems like corn and a little skunkyness. The malt character is up front and sweet, and their is a bitter skunky hop flavour present at the end. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and light bodied. I suppose it would be easy to drink a lot of these, but it was jsut too much of a bland lager for my tastes, not awful but just there. Im sure it'll be great on vacation on a greek isle though."
"Very nice beer. It could have been a bit cleaner in the finish, but that probably would have detracted from some of the more subtle flavors and smells."
"This definitely isn't a Munich Helles. The misconception is probably due to the fact that it says Hellenic Lager Beer on the label. Hellenic is basically another word for Greek. So it's calling itself a Greek Lager Beer, and that's what it is. It's a sub par euro pale lager. The flavour isn't too bad, but the aftertaste is horrible and just won't go away. The harsh mouthfeel is another liability. Not worth writing home about."
"This poured from the green bottle to a standard lager yellow with very little head, Rather uninspired. Smell is grassy, not offensive, not terrible. Flavors however in this are rather dull. On the palate there is very little in the way of character, however there is a not too bad hop note on the finish. Not bad going down and dangerously easy to drink, but that appears to be the only redeeming feature of this brew. Other than that, it's rather boring."
"Pale straw yellow with noisy and fizzy white head. Aromas of sulfuric acid and some spicy hops as well as a yeasty ""beer"" smell (light malts, I guess). The flavor was somewhat spicy, but tended toward skunk at first, then a more or less sickly sweetness kicked in that just didn't sit right with me. Thinnish mouthfeel with some prickly carbonation. I suppose this would be okay for washing back a bunch of heavy Greek food, and that's exactly what everyone else who shelled out $4 bucks for every bottle of this stuff was doing at the Hellenic Festival here in Buffalo last weekend. I was the only person I saw not drinking it straight from the bottle. Talk about feeling like a jerk."
"taste is also off, but worse. i don't like it. it's not as bad as happoshu, but i recently had some really good craft lagers and this one just doesn't do it for me. a little harsh. overall average, japan has FAR worse to offer."
"A friend brought this back from Greece. I figured..Greek beer...well, if this is Greek beer, I know why the Greeks are not known for beer. It is, perhaps, okay for a very hot summer day when the choice is water or this - not much of a difference. It poured a very light straw-like yellow. Not much of a head, and even that disippated quickly. There is no real flavor to it. It doesn't have any offensive taste, but then neither does water. In fact, it tastes like water, with some attempt at beer."
"Unless you need a beer from Greece take a pass on this one!"
"Clear straw yellow with a big, fluffy white head. Some lacing and decent retention. Mild malt, spicy hops and a sulfury character in the aroma. Flavour is on the sweet side, a bit of crackery malt in there. Very mild bitterness throughout. Sulfur and floral hops. Short finish, but unpleasantly sweet. Light body with moderately high carbonation. Not my cup of tea."
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow color lager with a nice foamy white head with better retention then expected. Aroma of skunk is not very surprising considering the green bottle and the distance it traveled. Very little hops are present in this beer with some limited sweet malt. Body is thin with a very watery mouthfeel."
"Just feels a bit too sweet to be something I could drink a lot of, if I wanted to drink a lot of it. Glad I tried it, but never care to have it again."
"Pours a clear golden, medium fluffy white head forms, disappears fast, little spots of lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, some citrus and some skunk, not much there. Taste is sweet with some vanilla, citrus and a little skunk. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, pretty smooth."
"This beer was not impressive at all. I had it at a Greek restaurant in Decatur, GA along with lamb. At least the lamb was good. The color is a clear straw yellow with very little carbonation and a very thin head. The smell is very light but sharp and bitter. The taste is also thin with very little flavor and sulfurous overtones. The mouth feel follows the taste  very thin."
"Completely average Euro lager here. Flavor is very similar to a Heineken except a little sweeter; average in all respects."
"Pale yellow, clear and totally ordinary in appearance. Soupy head swims with murky marks, poor laces or head retention. Lightly grassy aroma, verging on eggy and sulfurous. Slightly overcarbonated, very thin mouthfeel. Little going on in the flavor, some elements similar to the aroma, and emphasized by the catty aroma. Too gassy at the finish to even call this one particularly drinkable. Unfortunately, this is sold in six packs, maybe the rest will have some novelty appeal at parties, but I always feel a little bad bringing these kind of brews."
"Notes: Who in their right mind would classify this a Munich Helles Lager? It's not Bavarian, in fact it doesn't have anything in common with any German lager, it's very thin and would be much better classified as a generic Euro Pale Lager. I reviewed it as such. If this were a pale Munich lager just about every other beer in its class would be superior to it. Overall this beer is not too bad, but it's entirely meaningless - just fizzy yellow water really."
"Also, as a side thought: if you're in Greece.... who'd be drinking beer anyways with all the local wines/grippa/ouzo around? Like I said before.. enjoy the novelty."
"Served in a .5 litre green glass bottle. Enjoyed while on vacation in Mykonos, Greece. Beer has the strong odor of skunk, like some of the other beers here. The taste is fruity but the skunk flavor is a bit overwhelming at times, especially as the beer warms toward the end of the session. A nice beer though for a hot Greek summer afternoon. My try one or two more while in Hellas."
"impression: smells and tastes a little light stricken, probably because of the yeast sourch. Bohemian lager, grainy, earthy, sour."
"Quite refreshing nonetheless, and faced with little choice on Greek holiday islands, it is a reasonable stand-in. Definitely not the worst to drink while on holidays, but if you saw it in your local shop you would not ever consider it."
"Im still looking for my first real good Greek beer. Opah!!"
"I think that the long trip from Greece to Williamsburg, VA didn't treat this beer too kindly. A strong skunk smell rushed out of the bottle as soon as I opened it. Pours and looks like the standard Heine-clone. Taste was rather flat. I think that this was skunked, but I'm not going to try it again unless I'm in Greece. A 7,000 mile trip in a green bottle, coupled with a long wait on the shelf before purchase, will almost always end in a skunked beer."
"Flavor is ok, but also weak. A decent malt/hop balance, but nothing special. Some bitterness that gives it some interest, but it just doesn't have much to it. Mouthfeel is decent and reasonable. but nothing special. As a result, the drinkability is not great. I can drink this, but it doesn't excite me."
"Drinkability: Mythos is of the worst beer I ever had. I think the greek gods are against us."
"Medium gold color with the smallest of heads, just a layer of white foam almost paper thin. Smells of cereal grain and light grassy malt. Taste matches exactly. This is a non-descript euro lager that is really not worth wasting your beer budget on. I swear that most of these euro lagers come from the same vat.."
"Bottle from favorite Greek restaurant...light straw color...white frothy cap ...some herbal pilsner saaz aroma...light body pale malt sweetness over light hopping....light quick finish...another characterless pilsner-like beer...sems like a major UK mega brewer want a presense in the Greek tourist islamds and restaurants...this is a mediocre attempt at a pilsner bettern than some and not as good as continental pilsners."
"Drinkability- I really hope this was just a super bad bottle. This is damn bad. It even leaves a putrid aftertaste. Already have downed two pints of water in the past 15 minutes trying to get it out of my mouth and nasal cavity."
"pours a gold color with a frosty shortlived head and swathes of soft lace. The aroma is of crackers, rye bread and some spicey grassy hops. The taste is a slightly abrasive maltiness with grassy hops. The aftertaste is metallic and slightly astringent. The mouthfeel is thicker than expected with a healthy carbonation. The crisp and rather full bodied nature of this lager makes it quite refreshing and drinable. It has more flavor than other macro lagers."
"color is that of golden yellow with a touch of shade to darken, head came out strong, disipated fairly fast, but the carbonation keeps the head alive in trace amounts, (atleast until the first sip), scent is very lager...nice and crisp. flavor is easy to find here and gets better if you can ""aggravate"" or bubble it up.. but straight out the glass its run of the mill center of the tongue lager flavor, the aftertaste is nice. It could have a bit more mouth, flavor stays just on the center of the tongue..."
"This is yet another fresh standard lager. There is nothing special about this; an OK thirst-quenching brew for hot Mediterranean days."
"I am starting to wonder if the myth is that there are really any good Greek beers out there. Clear golden color with a short-lived thin white head and hardly any lacing. The aroma is somewhat skunky with a light hoppiness underneath. Light-bodied and carbonated with a sour hops flavor along with some sour malt for balance. The finish was equally unpleasant. I can only assume this was a bad bottle but it was highly undrinkable."
"Pours a straw golden, with light white head. Smell is light as well. Taste is dry and uninspiring, with light hops and light malt. Drinkability is good because of the lack of flavor. A bland beer for bland food. Better than most macros, but just barely."
"Skunky euro lager. Pours a very pale yellow, with a two finger head that disipates to nothing. The top has a rim of lace, beneath is nothing. Has that distinctive skunk smell. Bit floral and lemony as well. Taste starts out really bad. Like licking a skunk's genitals. Has an aftertaste of lemon. Thin, watery mouthfeel. Not something I'll buy again."
"A cloudy light yellow beer with a little bit of foamy white head that vanishes almost imeadiately.There is a sharp bite in the backround of the grainy aroma. That sharpness comes in at the begining of the sip followed by the grainy sweetness and a smooth bitterness at the end. This seems a little more robust than most lagers."
"This beer is not my favourite beer and i think this was the first and last time i drank it."
"all in all an average European lager that goes down well,and that I would drink again,but nothing exceptional."
"I dunno what all the proud fuss is about down in greece when they oh-so proudly introduce you to their finest national, Mythos. This to me tastes like most (rather than just say any) other world macro lagers, and, to ruin your expectative on a mythologically arse-kicking beer, I must say that no archaeological remnants of brewing directly connect mythos with this fine civilization. And if it were so, it'd still be rubbish."
"Came in a green 330 ml bottle, little golden unicorn on the logo. Pale yellow in appearance, slightly hazed--upon closer inspection suspended particles can be seen. Fizzy white head that fizzles out, leaves a small ring. Biscuity sweet aroma on the nose, faint floral hops. Flavour is grainy and metallic, a little skunky, citrus and hops on the finish. Aftertaste is very dry, almost makes the mouth pucker. It's actually kind of upsetting my stomach too, isn't sitting very well. Not impressed with this stuff."
"Quite anonymous."
"The taste is quite crisp, though there are no outstanding flavors, and the palate is left quite clean. Its a nice compliment to a meal, and fits the afternoon quite well. Sadly, its not as special as I'd have liked for #100."
"Golden straw crystal clear with a vibrant white artificially carbonated white head, leaving lace thoroughly around the edges of my pint glass. Aroma is a characteristic European green bottled mildly hopped beer, with the skunk aroma from the hops and an underlying malt sweetness. This beer is a bit watered down in the flavor with a slightly fruit toned grainy sweetness this beer is good at cooling you down in the hot sun, but as far as being a challenging well developed representation of any beer I say no way. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonated making me burp with every couple sips, nothing special to note about this beer. A fairly drinkable speaking in quantity but why would I wan to drink a lot of this beer with so many other great beers waiting to be tasted."
"Sweet and fizzy, little bitterness, bugger me, not good, skunky cat pee. Painful to drink. But a new country for me. I really can't right too much more about it, other than it was awful, very thin, and painful to drink, and its making this character rule pretty darn hard to pass, not good."
"Thx."
"drinkability is in question due to the malty sweetness.."
"Mythos beer misses from it's smell and taste in can. Beer is not the favourite drink of the Greeks and i experience this every year because i visit Greece 2-3 times a year. This beer is best enjoyed when served in bottle."
"BTW, green bottle no skunk."
"Mythos From Greece: A Hellenic Lager, in a 11.5 ounce green bottle.  Strong euro-skunk aroma.  Thick white head, long lasting, with pronounced Belgian lace.  Light bodied, deep golden color.  Very light and refreshing.  Nice balance between malt sweetness, and a hops bite.  Long lasting caramel after taste.  Not bad."
"Notes: Wasn't really impressed by this beer, pretty average. Although the ""skunked"" aroma and flavour is part of the character, it's a bit too much a part of it."
