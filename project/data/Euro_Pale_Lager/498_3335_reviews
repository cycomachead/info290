""
"standard cheap adjuncts with cereal grains, and not really much else here.drinkable"
"Overall: it may not be a great lager, but it is also AU$33 for a case of 24 x 330mL. Can't fault that."

"Hollindia is a decent cheap beer. Id prefer it over a Bud, Miller or Coors. The price is right too. At Food 4 Less you can get a 4pk of 16.9oz cans for 2.99. That has to be one of the best deals you can get for a beer that wont make you gag. It really is like a cheap version of Heineken. Id recommend this beer to anyone who just needed a couple of beers for the night and was on a budget."

"O: Another Euro Lager that is non-offensive."
""
"It is more of a barley juice with low drinkability, I will remember not to drink it again."
""
"D- It's drinkable for sure...very light and easy going. Low alcohol which I like. Good cheap party beer for MilBudCor people. ...And they'll think they're livin high and got something imported. :-)"

"Overall, I prefer other versions of the style but this was good to try in a mix pack."
"and I will probably drink it again."

"-Overall 3.5: Very good, basic lager. I have tried lagers that cost twice as much as a four-pack of Hollandia, but are on par with it or somewhat below it. The price this beer usually runs ($6 for four 16.9 oz beers) is hard to beat for what you get. It certainly is not ""swill," just a pleasingly low-key, well-executed European lager. Recommended for those who know what that is and what to expect."
"O: slightly below average lager, not terrible but nothing memorable"

"You can carry on with your life without having to drink this one and not really having missed anything."
"Overall, it wasn't that bad."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the look, and how mild it ultimately was. It could have been much more offensive with the level of metallics and adjuncts for the base, but it was surprisingly even throughout. The flavors were all very separate, without blending for a coherent product. Rather, we were left with a disjointed brew, that was not that pleasant to drink in the end."
"O- The only reason I bought this is b/c I honestly thought it was a nice beverage at a beer/wine/liquor festival that I attended....I was also hammered by the time I got around to sampling this one...it's no longer a 5/5 as I put in the book I had. On a hot day, this would be super refreshing I have to admit, but then so is Budweiser, and Bud is cheaper if I'm going that route! Not the absolute worst beer I've had but still....Thumbs down!"

"better then some of the other offerings I've had from these guys but still nothing to brag about"
"By looking at the cumulative score, one might be a bit misled - not all things do well by dissection and investigation - sometimes an adequate stadium beer is just that - thankfully non-represented 'Orange' colours aside - a so-so, still drinkable lager, if only for a can or two. Nah, just the one, please."

"Nice dry, crispy body and carbonatd finish, not something I'd try again, but on my quest to try every beer I must face the facts and try all these cloned lagers."
"Final Grade: 3.04, a C+."

"Just because a suit is made in Italy doesn't make it a good suit. And just because a beer is brewed in Holland, a country with rich brewing heritage, doesn't make it any better of a beer - certainly not when it's brewed to resemble every other insipid yellow lager on the market. Hollandia should be somewhat of a disgrace to self-respecting Dutch beer drinkers."
"Overall – I guess the small highlight for this beer is the light floral hop bite.. and I mean very light. But other than that, it's just another euro lager filling up the shelves at my local beer store."
"Dr: Cheap shite beer. Better than Budweiser (what a compliment!)."
"It has a sweet taste to it very pleasant. I is definately one that is in the rotation"
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malts. Taste is also on the sweet side, some malts, a touch of bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good brew, great for a hot summer day."
"Thanks to the detractor who said that he dislikes the auditory nature of CANs, this Crack and Gluggg is for you! I had never even considered that aspect of CANned beer, but now I live for it. My initial pour resulted in two fingers' worth of rocky bone-white head that fizzled like the time one of my bunkmates tried to hard-wire his alarm clock into his rack lamp. Arc & spark action, baby! Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see THROUGH the Sunday comics. No, not really, but it was crystal clear, just like the water they purported to have used. My oh my, but I CAN really get used to putting my nose into anything that is not an AAL. This had a pleasant lager sweetness without anything getting in its way. That also included hops, so don't look for a hops fix here, you lupulin junkies. Mouthfeel was medium with a very malt-forward sweetness on the tongue. Finish was incredibly smooth, relatively sweet with a mild hop bitterness at the extreme finish. Baby, where you been hiding all this time? You are getting a special place in my cooler! Relatively low ABV means that I won't stumble off the beach in a stupor. Me like."
"Overall I was pretty pleased with this, drinkable stuff, pleasing taste, good price. A good buy for a few pints of lager. I think it is relevant to point out most reviews for this come from a green bottle and this sample is from the pint can."
"Could drink a few of these."
"The words boring and bland came to mind, but it it is better than that, only just, but I'm going to call it an average lager/pilsner considering all things."
"Just another boring euro."
"D - This is an okay lager. Not something that I'd pick up regularly but it is drinkable."
"Drinkability - Not bad, a lager that isn't an immediate turn off just something not worth going out of your way for. Nothing special and actually a little below most other euro-lager imports."
"Not extremely offensive, but pretty dodgy all the same."
"Hollandia pours a pale yellow with a white head from a stubby green twelve ounce bottle. I can smell skunk as soon as I crack the cap open. The flavor is a bit skunky with some cereal flavors. A second class version of Heineken. Not particularly good, I'd pass."
"The color is a golden yellow with carbonation. No head. The nose is skunky malty aroma with hints of yeast. The tastes is very yeasty skunky and the malt is an afterthought and very bitter. The mouth feel is harsh with no finish. This was not a good beer."
"D: Very mainstreamish, & typical of an import lager that tries to please everyone, could have done with maybe a little more body & flavour. The price certainly makes this an easy drinker. Could buy a 6 pack & think ""yeah. not too bad""."
"D: Drinkability was unimpressive, and didn't care to finish this one. A big pass here needless to say."
"Pours a straw yellow macro lager color with a small head that faded quickly, leaving behind no lacing. Smell is a little skunky, but could be from age. Some grainy malts in the taste, crisp and dry. Medium carbonation, somewhat smooth. I had one of these in college many many years ago and thought it was ok, and thought it would be nostalgic to revisit this one. The nostalgia was short-lived and remembered why I started drinking good beer when I could afford it."
"This felt like a week version of stronger beers, the beer tasted like a week version of peroni, it was not a full bodied beer, was a wee bit week as far as taste, but overall it was not the worst beer I have had, it was pretty good. I would not be opposed to drinking it again."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes very quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of skunk with some grainy malt underneath the skunk. The taste is more malty and less skunky than the aroma, but it still isn't pleasant. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a bad beer. I try not to review beers which I think might be skunked. However, I see no need to refrain from reviewing a beer that is skunked due to the fact that it is bottled in green glass, which is something the brewer can control. This is a bad beer. I will not drink it again."
"A very boring, very watery beer (in the spirit of 'Heineken light perhaps) that does have a very clean refreshing aspect to it."
"Drinkability- A good clean lager. I just may revisit it in the future. Lawnmower beer?"
"Serving is chilled, in a pint glass. Pours golden straw with some head and very little lacing. Smell is clean and dry. Very grainy. Taste is smooth, of malted grain, but no bad aftertaste. Somewhat malty with hints of floral tones. A faint dry malt aftertaste, with a lot of graininess.Sweet and lightly malty taste in the end. For the price this is not too bad, will buy again.This cheap Euro beer is better than most of our domestic macros."
"Overall - id recommend this beer to anyone who wants n easy drinking imported beer. n also cheap n different to the australian beers."
"It's really light in color and smells a little like malt liquor. Tastes like Heineken, only with a slight off putting sweetness. Slight hop tingle, maybe Haulleture or Saaz. It's no Grolsch (which I favor in out of the Dutch Lagers), but it's tasty."
"Overall - This certainly isn't a beer I'd recommend people to try. However, it is very cheap, and better than I expected considering the price."
"Pours a clear & bright light golden color with chunky white head that fades away pretty quickly. Smells a little lightstruck (damn you, green bottles!) and a little of grassy hops. The taste is very light and crisp, finishing clean. Not really much in the way of flavor, but what is there is fairly well balanced. The mouthfeel is fizzy and a tiny bit harsh. Overall, it's fairly drinkable, but nothing really stands out about it."
"Drinkability is outstanding, this beer puts every American macro to shame! Flavorful but light and easy to drink, this beer is a session winner."
"Pours a golden color with a nice white lacey head. Smells mostly of hops and a little malt and perhaps citrus. The taste is typical pale lager style. Nothing about this makes it an interesting lager. The malt profile and the hops choice are par for the course and nothing stands out as being different or extraodinary. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly and it goes down easy. Typical lager drinking fair here."
"D: Although very similar in appearance to a typical mass brewed American Pale lager, this beer was distinctly enjoyable or at least preferred over a domestic example. A little more ""heat"" would round this beer out nicely IMO."
"Straw yellow coloring. Decent head which leaves no lacing. Smells of hops with a bit of pale malt. Pretty boring flavor like most European Pale lagers. Typical Pale Lager dry finish. Easy to drink and cheap I like it more than Heineken and it cost less. Definitely not a beer to sip slowly."
"I could drink these all night long, but I wouldn't want to. I bought this on accident and wouldn't have tried it otherwise. It is exactly what I expected it to be. Boring, bland, and just plain bad."
"Don't let the ""it's a good value"" statements think this one's worthwhile. I won't be spending my money on it again even if it is a good value."
"A drying finish that has some pleasant back palate. I would rather drink this than its ""Bavaria"" stablemate... but only just."
"All-in-all, I'm glad I tried it. I'd drink it again for a buck a pop, but I don't find it too special."
"No need for a glass for this beer. Drink it cold, drink it from the container, drink it quickly if that's your thing. Not too shabby at $6 for 6 pints but nothing worth going out of your way for."
"Poured a pale yellow color with slight haziness. Head is bold and creamy, long lasting with very attractive lacing. Smell is grain like with moderate presence noted. Taste is clear, slightly malty and crisp. Taste rapidly dissapears from the mouth. Finishes is a bit dry and is somewhat enjoyable. Easy drinking and very refreshing."
"Not a good choice; I had been out in the sun and wanted something light and quenching from the nearest store. These were next to Grolsch for almost $3 less -- and now I know why."
"I can't really say it sucks, but it doesn't rule either..fine in a pinch but I won't go looking for it again..blah, blah, blah.."
"This is an average beer, suited to rapid thirst drenching guzzling ...Straight from the bottle !"
"Overall, a very average beer, but not bad for a cheap lawnmower light. Just be sure to get the cans."
"A dutch pale lager; made with generous hops and malt, special for cheese, german, mexican and american food; pale appearance , smell like a boiled hops; taste good over the average; mouthfeel little bitter; its drinkability made special for the pilsner glass or serve in a mug. 80% recommended."
"Pours golden clear with thick white head that fades slowly. Nose of citrus and pleasantly toasted oak. Burnt wheat seems to be the predominant flavoran asset, not a liability. Grassy, light bitter flavor. Mouth is nicely watery and slightly bitter. Drinkability is good. A decent but unremarkable lager."
"¡Salud!"
"No skunk, nothing really offensive just routine but drinkable and refreshing as it should be. Euro lawnmower beer.."
"Hollandia is very light. Well carbonated. Swallow it and the flavor is gone. It is drinkable but I think I have had mine and now it is time for something else!"
"Faced with a $5.50 sixer of 16oz. Hollandia cans to the shelves of red, white, gold and blue the decision is easy."
"Pours to a deep golden color and thin white bubbly head. Aroma is skunks and rubber. Taste is cheap, dry eurolager crap. Finishes with a dryness that is not too bad. Overall, this is a crappy, smelly, cheap tasting beer that has few things going for it."
"This beer was pretty much what I expected it to be: a fairly average Euro macro. Appearance is a nice wheat color, head is average, fairly high carbonation. Smell is rather weak, but clean, about what is expected from a Euro pale lager. Luckily no skunking here. Taste is middle-of-the-road enjoyable. Begins with rather weak hops bite, and finishes mildly sweet with some honey taste. For the money this is a nice, solid euro lager. It won't wow you, but it is a decent session cheapie. By the way, this beer tastes a lot like this brewery's Bavaria beer, except that one is a pilsiner."
"Cheaper than even a 6-pack of Budweiser at my local grocery store, and for good reason. Avoid this one at any cost."
"Ok, but f all"
"It pours very golden and carbonated, with a big fluffy and frizzy head. Yes, inconsistent. Its smells maize-like but also bitter. The mouthfeel is light, crisp and a tad dry. The taste mainly is composed of a sweet corn characteristic. The finish is mostly sweet, but transfers nicely into a hop bitterness that dries out the palate. This brew is completely average. I'd call it a better version of heineken."
"A nice lager... typical but very pleasent."
"Hollandia came in a green bottle. It was a clear gold color with lots of bubbles and nice to look at. The head was small and vanished soon after pouring. The slightly skunky/earthy aroma wasn't too exciting. The taste was slightly malty and sweet with some hop bite and crispness. The finish was dry and inconsequential. If this beer is cold and you are hot and thirsty it performs its function well."
"Not too much to say about this beer. This is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill lager replicating something from Miller or Anheuser Busch. It isn't bad, but it is far from something good. This review is on a 16 oz can, and that is about 12 oz more than I really need. If you have very simple-drinking guests, this one might not be bad."
";t"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a white lace head. The aroma is decent. It is mildly skunky with that green glass smell, but it has a nice pale aroma with a bit of hop scent. The taste is average. It is dry and watery, but it has a fair malt and hop flavor. Again, it is skunky, but it goes down relatively smooth. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with less than average carbonation. This beer drinks decent; an average European lager."
"Clear gold color, huge white head. Lots of active carbonation. Stink lewdly of grass. I can smell the empty bottle 6 feet away. Tastes of malt, grass, and a little hops. Very dry. Not one of my favorites. I don't like the euro lagers very much, but one of the better ones I've had."
"Seemed a bit over-worked and processed. Malt had a rough grain husk edge that was a bit detracting, but not enough to put me off the beer. Of its class, this is a bit ahead of the middle of the pack. Bright and clean, very drinkable but not a lot of soul."
"Straight and uncomplicated. Decent price."
"Its crystal-clear straw-gold body reveals hundreds of average-sized bubbles rising quickly to fall in line beneath its creamy bright-white head. The retention is good and it holds a thin, creamy cap as well as leaving sheets of dappled lace. The nose is clean but offers little more than a mildly sweet, slightly grainy malt that's just lightly infused with leafy or herbal hops. The body is light bordering on medium; and it's crisp in the mouth. The flavor delivers a mildly sweet and lightly grainy malt that's solidified by an undercurrent of hop flavor and restrained bitterness. It finishes with a touch of sweet malt that dries fairly quickly."
"A light yellow beer with a small, quickly diminishing white head that left no lace whaysoever. The flavor is surprisingly bitter as if highly hopped, yet the hop flavor is quite neutral leaving no distinct sense of hop style. This beer appears to be cleanly brewed with giving any strong adjunct sense and finishes quite crisply."
"12 oz green bottle. Poured a typical straw yellow, with a moderate head. No lacing to speak of. Fairly descent carbonation with numerous small bubbles. Aroma is slightly skunked, which cleared after sitting. Taste starts off mildly sweet but quickly fades, leaving a faint bitterness behind. Wattery and bland is all I can say! This is another one of those beers you could sit and drink all night, because it's so much like a macro lite beer, nothing there to fill up on."
"Pours a pale golden colour with a thick foam head that fades slowly, some lacing left, and some carbonation is present. The smell has more than a few hops and some maltyness present. The taste, nothing special, is rather watery and bitter leaving behind most of its true possible flavour, and this gives it a less than sterling mouthfeel. Good to try, but just to get it out of the way: won't be at it again."
"Drinkability/notes: Not a particularly good beer, even though it is cheap. Bavaria, from this same brewer, is better."
"Pale hay color, absolutely clear with a whitish head of 1/8 of an inch of soapy bubbles. Sweet vegetal aroma, slight skunk, and little to zero hops. Flavor is slightly better than the aroma, slightly sour but with some peppery hop sense to offset the absolutely tasteless sweet mash. A bit of a weird hot cinnamon in the aftertaste. Doesn't generate enough flavor for me to have much of an opinion -- other than it doesn't have the dryness of a decent Pilsner nor the drinkability of a mid pack Lager."
"Hollandia is one of those cheap averagely made beers, that only sell cause they are erally cheap, they should only be drunk if you get them for free, and there is nothing else to drink. Taste is rather average, slightly hoppy, tastes like a bad bad batch of Steinlager (and thats saying something). Still it's cheap."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a thick and bubbly white head that fades into a patchy lace with large bubbles. Nose is overly cooked and stale grains. Light and crisp in the mouth. Taste is a bit bland with notes of cooked corn and a sweet finish. I dont know what else to say about this beer other than I dont recommend it."
"This is a bland and boring beer in a green bottle but here it is another 90+ day so it makes a good lawnmower beer and would be easy to pound down several with an ABV of 5.0%."
"Tastes quite similar to Heineken and I guess it should being that it is their original recipe (from what I've been told).  Really nothing happening with this brew.  It's good to give to friends who really don't know any better.  They think you're breaking out the good stuff when it is actually cheap swill (around $5.00 for six).  I did, however, drink the heck out of the first six I bought.  I guess I figure if there is no taste to savor, throw it on back."
"Probably down there with heineken, but perhaps better at half the price, only drink in situations where your moneys running low, light fizzy, easy to drink, no character."
"Notes: Nothing like a crappy Dutch beer, Heineken may have done it right the bad way but this beer steals the show for being not only bland but with the imported lager taste too and doing it all the wrong way ... either way they are the same only this one is cheaper $$$ so buy this one over Heineken. This beer is just not happening at all."
