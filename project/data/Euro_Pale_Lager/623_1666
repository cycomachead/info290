Aroma was pretty weak, with some ver slight grainy malt notes, no hop or bitter notes in the smell. Taste was sweet malt and corn with just a touch of bitterness, not much else. As it warmed, I got a bit of a metallic taste - not good. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, but nothing special.

3.46,13.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 10/22/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, pear, cracker, bready grain, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with well balanced pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with weak strength. Taste of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, bready grain, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, bready grain, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid pale lager. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 30, 2014"

Most Polish lagers seem to take on a gasoline aroma when they warm up, but Zywiec‚Äôs flavor held - nice light malt character and really drinkable.","smitty4657","Jan 13, 2014"

Occasion: waiting for Matt and Jerry to arrive to begin the golf weekend....Appearance: pale, sallow golden body; large bubbles collect and release for the glass's bottom; frothy, soupy uneven white head that leaves uneven tracings... Aroma: odd, pungent doughy malts leave a locker room funk in the nostrils; not thee fresh pilsner hops hoped for... Palate: oily, almost buttery consistency with minimal presence at the teeth; drinkable, yes--this could be a backyard barbecue accompaniment ...Taste: a rather nondescript lager, with little profile and discussable points; almost perfectly rinsing the mouth... Overall: being a parishioner of a Polish church, the Zywiec is a presence at adult functions for sure; the bottle trumpets itself as Poland's #1 beer, but unfortunately Budweiser does similarly in America, and the parallel may be fitting...not bright or crisp, not refreshing enough to garner future interest, this beer files in behind many better, more engaging lagers...","dacrza1","Jul 12, 2013"

Living there and being a young guy, I was naturally drawn to the social aspect of this beer. Everyone was drinking it between shots of wodka, this was pretty good stuff. The women usually got a couple of pumps of raspberry syrup and drank it from a straw?? Weird, not really my thing. Until I discovered Tyskie and Okocim, this was my go-to/have a fun time/party beer! It pours an average light yellow, smells pretty blah and isn't really something worthy of writing a long review about.

3.42,12.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D - As far as cheap Polish lager goes this isn't all that bad. Not a world beater by any stretch but still better than most of the local Australian mass-produced crap.","xylophonica","Nov 11, 2010"

3.13,3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a very clear and bubbly straw color with very little head and no retention. Scent is extremely light with notes of damp straw and yeasty bread. Taste brings the qualities from the scent with a touch of stale earthy hops... no lager twang. Lighter side of medium bodied, bubbly for a while. A decent BMC alternative but not much more.","rfgetz","Nov 08, 2010"
3.1,2,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a clear, pale, straw color with a decent white head that retains fairly well. Smells of cereal grains, yeast, and a touch of earthy hops. Tastes of doughy malt, lots of yeast, light noble hops. Light and crisp mouthfeel. It's not bad. I'd take it over a BMC beer. It's along the lines of a Heineken.","Doomcifer","Nov 07, 2010"

3.03,-0.3,3,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D - not much to it, a slight step above its American counterparts with a bit more "real" and less fake adjunct flavoring. might accompany some Asian food or a simple salad nicely.","Stigs","Nov 03, 2010"

2.61,-14.1,3,2,2.5,2.5,3.5,"there's really no need to write a full review on this beer. i had one of these with lunch at the hippy food store and i didnt know it was in any way related to heineken but the first thing that came to mind upon drinking this was "heineken with a slight apple taste/smell". not really a beer to complain about in general but its pricier than heineken and i dont really see any way that it's a step up. overall its a good beer i suppose but you wont catch me buying any more of it.","wallaceandvomit","Sep 27, 2010"
3.27,7.6,2.5,3,3,4,4,"Notes: I haven't had too many mass produced lagers but this was better than I expected and very drinkable. Definitely a C for this style.","4000qtrap","Sep 22, 2010"
3.12,2.6,3,3.5,3,3,3,"500ml bottle at Paddington's Pub in Grand Bend, ON. Zywiec pours a pale golden yellow with a sliver of white froth and zero lacing. Smell and taste are flowery, grassy, and herbal hops, light bready malts, mineral water, mild cereal-like graininess, bittersweet aftertaste. Typical Euro Lager flavour. Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, creamy palate midway, bitter and chalky finish. An easy drinking EPL that fails to stand out from others in the style. Neverthless, this is worth a sample if nothing better is available to you. Quaffable.","cratez","Aug 29, 2010"

2.81,-7.6,3.5,2.5,2.75,3,3,"Taste, not a lot to speak of. Light malt, little to no roasting, barely noticeable hops combined with big carbonation. Does at least have a greater than average bitterness to it. Cheap hops, long boil I guess. At least it isn't overpriced.","Beerandraiderfan","Aug 11, 2010"

2.95,-3,3,3,3,2.5,3,"M/D: The dark caramel aspects give a heavier feel that seems out of place. I'd like it better if it were more crisp and light. Carbonation was very rigorous after the pour but soon settled to an appropriate level. Overall there are a few things I don't like about it, but it's not too bad. Pretty typical EPL.","BeerNinja007","Jul 26, 2010"
2.75,-9.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,3,"Taste reminded me of the nose. Was rather bitter on the palate and not really in a good way. I also found it to be a little dry. Very simple beer.","pwoody11","Jul 23, 2010"

2.76,-9.2,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Poured a nice clear golden yellow with a two fingered creamy just a touch off white head that dissapeared quickly to thin lacing. Aromas of light sweet crackers and grass with a touch of gun metal.Taste pretty much like it smelled on the palette but the metal finish was kinda weird. Medium light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Wasn't truly impressed with the overall of this brew but the abv's kept it from a total washout.","Bizz88","Jul 15, 2010"

3.26,7.2,4,3,3,3,4,"The crispness will allow you to drink many of these and the higher ABV will get you trashed faster than with American NASCAR beers and after three or four you'll forget that it's basically an average beer.

3.78,24.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"The body was surprisingly full for the style. drinkability was very good, I'd happily grab a bottle of this to have with a sandwich at the park for lunch. Overall, a very nice brew that's worth a shot if you see it.","beertunes","Jun 16, 2010"
3.56,17.1,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall a good lager with a nice hop presence. The dry/chalky mouthfeel is great. It's clean and nonintrusive. It's simple and satisfying.","malty","Jun 14, 2010"
3,-1.3,3,3,3,3,3,"I bought a 4-pack of 16.9oz cans for $4.99 at the famed DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY and drank two post-haste. The only real problem with Zywiec IMO is that it has an unpleasant alcohol-y edge that makes it taste spiked, as if they tried to take a shortcut and enhance the ABV by means other than fermentation. (A brewer would probably be able to diagnose this better than I can). If it were possible to separate that aspect this might be a decent European-style lager; as it is, I'd pass it by for any number of better offerings.","hmk22","Jun 13, 2010"

2.24,-26.3,3,1.5,2,3,3,"I'm sure it would go well with almost any food, and would probably go down like water on a hot day. It was interesting to try something different, but it's not one that I'd likely buy again.","kkoz","May 09, 2010"

4.1,34.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I initially got two foamy, soapy fingers' worth of bone-white head that settled down pretty quickly. Color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a soft hoppiness, present but not in-your-face. In fact, it really smelled like lager should, no adjunct scents to get in the way. Mouthfeel was medium with a lager sweetness on the tongue. I have not had Zywiec since my Bloomfield Bridge Tavern days and it brought back fond memories of their Red and White dinner platters, sitting around with Stosh, drinking Polish and Baltic beers. Finish was smooth, soft, very lager-like. This was quite the hook-up and very welcome in my cooler at the beach!","woodychandler","Apr 19, 2010"
3.25,6.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Overall, it is always fun getting to try new beer and a Polish beer is never an exception. This tastes a lot like American macro lagers, but it definitely has that European tough to it with the hops and malt flavors I can taste. Relatively drinkable.","mothman","Apr 08, 2010"
3,-1.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a pale golden color with a white head that quickly disappears. Aroma of malt, grass, yeast, and a slight metallic smell. Taste has some sweet grains and more grass. Average body for a lager, with mild carbonation. Not too bad, but not something I'd buy again. There are better Euro Lagers than this.","chickenm","Apr 01, 2010"
3,-1.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours dark golden colour with a thick white head. Hoppy aroma with grains, also with some floral accents. Both fairly faint though. Taste is malty sweetness,grassy hops, honey, and for some reason reminds me of a malt liquor. Decent. Bottle from the LCBO.","mrmanning","Mar 08, 2010"
2.83,-6.9,2.5,2,3,3,3.5,"Again, as in the aroma, the flavor is pretty bland. Very soft carbonation up front with pilsner malt being the most prominent flavor. There is also a touch of the light crisp fruit notes from the aroma and subtle grass/straw.","corby112","Feb 05, 2010"
2.96,-2.6,4,3,3,3,2.5,"D-Definitely tasty but a bit on the heavy side so I can't see myself drinking more that two or three of these.","12puebloyankee","Jan 23, 2010"

3.46,13.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Pure malt in the aroma, straight forward and enticing. Transfers into the quaff nicely, big malt backbone with some light grass and hay notes. Very nice pilsner beer to enjoy with the Saturday football, not an average beer at all.","Vancer","Jan 16, 2010"
3.12,2.6,3,3.5,3,3,3,".66L poured into a pokal. Pours an amber gold with an initial one finger head that settles quickly to a thinning ring. Sweet malts are immediately apparent to the nose. The malts take to the fore in taste, leaving a mild, slightly hoppy aftertaste. As for drinkability, this is not a bad beer for mass market, competing (as it does) with Lech Premium in Poland. I could easily spend an evening enjoying a few, but not something that I would go out of my way to find.","sunrisesolara","Jan 10, 2010"
3.13,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Now, while the Beer Advocate Brothers have graded this beer a pretty low grade, it was my understanding that Zywiec had won a gold medal in 2007 I believe for best Polish beer? I could be mistaken. Anyway, as much of the beer I have reviewed this beer is available at the store I work at. I was impressed originally only because I thought it was going to be terrible. The beer has a decent crisp taste, especially severed cold. Zywiec has a golden amber color, which leans toward a mediocre head. Some lacing occurs, but nothing to scream about. Overall, a decent beer, nothing great, better than I expected.","StevenBilodeau","Jan 07, 2010"

3.25,6.9,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Notes: Being Polish, I've wanted to try a Polish beer for a while. I'm not disappointed, but not overly impressed. This beer is about what I expected, a standard Euro lager. Flavors aren't bad, but not bold, at least its cheap.","dpodratsky3","Dec 13, 2009"

4.2,38.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Zywiec is obviously a mass market beer in Poland and is widely available here in Chicago, making it easy to lump in with average-costing imports like Becks, Heineken, etc. But, be aware that this is a far better beer than any comparably priced import. Nothing offensive here in the taste dept. The taste is fresh, crisp and clean. The carbonation is perfect and adds just the right amount of bite. The alcohol content is a bit higher than others in it's class, but with the richness of the taste it blends right in. This is what mass market American beers dream of being, but can't seem to pull off. This may be a buck or two more than Bud, Miller, Pabst, etc., but well worth it. This is a real quencher and goes down smooth and tasty. An excellent beer for getting out of hand and pounding down a few with an added touch of class! Very tasty!","MNJR","Dec 03, 2009"
3.18,4.6,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: For the style this is decent. It is somewhat more tasty than others in this category. I would have this again if I was looking for a beer in this style, but otherwise would pass.","tigg924","Nov 30, 2009"
3,-1.3,3,3,3,3,3,"The taste is a bit lemony, tart, metallic, grassy, a bit biting in parts, a little bit of citric lemon comes through. The beer is refreshing, watery, lagery, drinkable, with some bland mustiness in there as well. There are some grains that could be nice but are covered over with mustiness and the metallic flavors. A compromised lager, but it's okay.","albern","Nov 20, 2009"

2.2,-27.6,2,2,2.5,2,2,"Overall this beer is thoroughly underwhelming and doesn't stand out much. If I was planning on getting tipsy with a few friends, however, this brew would likely be a step above other beers of this style.","iD9","Oct 01, 2009"

2.3,-24.3,2,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Poured a very pale yellow that I personally found somewhat unpleasant. Smelled very skunky (like someone said, despite the brown bottle...which is intented to avoid skunky taste and chemical changes which can occur in the bottle under bright lights and when exposed to heat). Tasted nothing special, very malty, but not in the saltine cracker type way. The malt was more like a bland piece of stale bread which has lost its flavor. I think there was lots of hops present in the 4 bottles that I tried on 4 separate occasions, so I can only assume that this beer tastes this way in every bottle a person would buy. The flavor that sticks out the most in this beer is the fruitiness of the lager that persists until the bottle is done. I actually somewhat appeciate it, but it's not enough to redeem this lager as something I would regularly drink/buy. It does it's job at 5.5% ABV and although you would think this would make one think that it's a great "session beer", I'd say reconsider and try some other Eastern Euro-Lagers before diving into this one as your first choice. It's passable as a decent E-E.L beer, but only barely.","RyanBelle","Aug 25, 2009"
3.01,-1,3.5,2.5,3,2,4,"Poured crystal clear blonde with a modest head that quickly reduced to a collar and eventually, nothing. The aroma is pretty quiet, not a lot going on. The taste is sweet, I can not find any bitterness. Feel is light bodied with very little carbonation. Drinkability: you should be able to drink a lot of these and under certain circumstances, probably would. As you can tell from the review, the one remarkable characteristic of this beer is... Bland. At $1.99 for a 500 ml bottle, the price was right though.","kegger22","Aug 23, 2009"

3.78,24.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"A Euro pale lager made in Poland and imported by Heineken. What do you expect? And yet it was a bit better than anticipated. Served cold, poured frothy yellow in the glass with a decent head and a bit of skunk (despite the brown bottle) but some malt in the nose. Taste was both a touch sweet, a bit biscuity and somewhat balanced with fruity hops, though far less than one might expect. Very easy drinking beer--almost too much so. You could put down a few of these on a cold night in Warsaw (or War-shington). Hand-delivered by UF from Pittsburgh. (Thanks UF!)","tugdriver7","Jun 08, 2009"

It's biggest flaw is that it lacks any real flavor or character. I suppose it's worth a try. Generally, it's tough to find a Euro Pale that's worth a damn. This one's run of the mill for the style.

I smell a cabbage skunk malt and noble hop on this. Tastes similar to how it smells. If my memory serves me well it reminds me of a St. Pauli Girl. The barley and noble hops pull through but it's a little skunky and pilsner-like. Fairly drinkable euro lager, more flavorful and more barley than your average american macro.

Moderate acidity takes the shape of tomatoes and sulfer, however kinda add to the complexity in a wierd sort of way.

When frothed on the palate, a few subtle citrus notes are released and a little malt sweetness can be detected. Dare I say this, but it tastes slightly like a Dortmunder with its no-nonsense taste,cold, refreshing, not weak. I was hoping this brew might be a little more complex but feels like a Euro-macro if there is such.

2.9,-4.6,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Another Polish pale lager, coming in the 500ml brown bottle. Nice enough labelling: white with lots of red and traditionally-clad figures of a man and woman--the cap has the same logo. The label on the back has a little gadget I have never seen before, and I thought it was cool: in a little box are the words "Beer Thermometer" and then beside that it says: "Refrigerate, wait until Zywiec logo appears that indicates ideal drinking temperature." Sure enough a little red Zywiec symbol appears after cooling the bottle. First time I have ever seen that. Zywiec is a super-clear honey-golden colour, with a fairly dense but quickly moving aspirin-white head. Rapidly moving lacing. The head settled as a patchy paper-thin covering. A typical and average looking Polish lager. The nose is a mixture of honey and fresh green grass. Dusty continental hopping, some sweetish light malts, and a hint of spritzy alcohol. There is a bit of a creamy marshmallow aroma too. More malty than a Dort-export or Czech Pils. The hops are well balanced with the malt though, and all in all this is a good aroma for its purpose and style. No "off" smells. Again, average. As the beer warms, the aroma seems to exhibit too much sugary maltiness, like malt-liquor. The beer's taste is rather light overall, with honeyed malts and the faintest hint of dusty bitterness. There is a bit of a sourish/underdeveloped malt note here, adding some unpleasant cardboard tastes. It finishes decently, leaving equal parts light sweetness and coppery dryness. The poor malt flavour seems to be at the front of the tongue, because in the middle and back the malting is all right, adding some toasty bread flavours. There is really nothing much else to describe. The mouthfeel is medium in carbonation, and light bodied. Quaffable I grant you. There is really nothing to complain about here, despite Zywiec's commonality and average flavour. Still better than a plethora of lagers out there.","Cwrw","Feb 10, 2006"

There is some light crispness in the middle but it does get railroaded. For the finish, the sweetness increases exponentially and leaves quite a fruity trace behind it. Very nice. There is some masterful yeast going on in this beer. I can understand some may be disappointed by the lack of hoppiness in this pilsner-style beer, and that is understandable. Some may even find it bland. Well I really liked it; the yeast is the most volatile, temperamental, complex part of the beer and this beer is nothing less than thrilling if you're into that, like I am. Like a good Belgian, disguised as a bland Euro-lager. Drink with strawberries or maybe raisins (this is just guesswork here; I am not eating either of those things at the moment).","Thrasher","Mar 06, 2003"
3.7,21.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Basically how a lager should taste and look. Nice, goldish color with great medium lasting foam. Nice bubbles after pouring into a glass. Decent aroma. First few sips and tastes indicate that it is better than a bud, then the malt aftertaste comes into the play, which is fine for a lager.","stoutman","Feb 24, 2003"

3.68,21.1,3,2.5,4,4,4.5,"A great Pilsner in my opinion. Has that nice bitter taste. Color is what you would expect, a nice copper with very little head. I expected it to foam up a bit more. It is one of the better Pilsners I have tasted actually. Would be a great sumer beer and one that you could drink TONS of.","Jdiddy","Feb 10, 2003"

2.75,-9.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"A cloudless gold or straw color on the pour with a mountainous white head that erodes into fine sheets of lace that cling to the glass. Aromas of malt, and light citrus tones, clean and crisp, with a skinny top. Start is sweet, finish has a scarce hop presence and is overly acidic with a droughty aftertaste. While it is drinkable, it¬ís just way to light in all categories to score well with me.","Gusler","Dec 06, 2002"

3.03,-0.3,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Very clear, golden-straw colored beer with a medium sized white, puffy head. Initial taste seemed very sweet to me, but the sensation quickly fades and the finish is almost tart. Aroma is faintly floral, but it takes a good bit of sniffing to detect. It¬ís a smooth and refreshing beer, but not all that impressive. Flavors and characteristics seem muted throughout. I did like beer thermometer on the label, though.","Suds","Nov 23, 2002"
2.53,-16.8,3.5,3,2,3,2.5,"Pale straw, just slightly darker than Budweiser, with a fairly mild, somewhat grainy aroma. A smooth beer, especially when drunk at the fairly low recommended temperature (neat thermometer gizmo).  Initially mild hop bitterness becomes more pronounced as beer warms.  Metallic tastes mid-palate, reminiscent of soda-water.  Very little malt body, and a somewhat harsh finish, with a soapy aftertaste.  Medium-light bodied.","mzwolinski","Nov 10, 2002"

3.77,24,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Clear, amber color with a thin white head that cannot hold. It does, however, keep a decent collar and some surface foam. Lacing is minimal. The nose is of a lightly sweetish, bready malt and a light herbal hoppiness. The body is medium with a fine & moderate carbonation that leaves it lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is a reflection of the aroma with a softly sweet grainy malt that's supported by an underlying bitterness; and enriched with a non-distinct herbal hop flavor. It finishes smooth and light, and fairly short and dry. An pleasant beer with some nice malt and hop character.","NeroFiddled","Oct 16, 2002"
3,-1.3,3,3,3,3,3,"The bottle was kind of cool... red white and blue attired Polish dancers, and a beer thermometer... a little stip on the back which shows the name of the beer when it's at the right temp.  The beer, hever was pretty boring. Translucent gold, with almost no head.  Very high carboantion, crisp, with a light body.  Kind of malty / grass aroma, with a bit of a biscuity flavor.  Nothing distinguishing or complex.","zerk","Sep 06, 2002"
3.92,28.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"At Polonia Restaurant in Hamtramck. My friend ordered this and I poured a little in my glass to taste. It is absolutely interchangeable with Becks. Clean, flavorful, a real Hanseatic emblem. High quality to appeal to the bourgeoisie without unneccassary, earthy complications of non-pasteurization or excessive dry-hopping. It embodies a wealthy, industrial aesthetic that, right now, I find attractive if not comforting.","putnam","Aug 22, 2002"
2.8,-7.9,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Light golden in color, very bubbly and typically clear.  The large bubbled head isn't quite as thick as other pilsners but is persistent enough to leave a decent lace.  Mildly grassy Saaz hop nose upfront followed by a hint of graininess, but there's not much else there aromawise.  The flavor is clean, but a bit bland.  Hop bitterness is clean and light but malt sweetness and body is light as well, resulting in a balanced but prosaic flavor profile.  Finishes clean, dry with a barely perceptible breadiness and a touch of sweetness on the tip of the tongue. Take domestic Bud, get rid of the corn and rice adjuncts and you'll have this brew.  Definitely lacking in both malt character and hop bitterness for a good pilsner.","marc77","Jun 20, 2002"

2.89,-4.9,3.5,2,3,3,3.5,"Odd little coloured paper thermometer on the back label ¬Ö I¬íd rather see a freshness date than odd gizmos. Good frothing white head and very good clarity for a beer that comes from Eastern Europe. Orangey and mildly skunky aroma from the hops due to an obvious pasteurization or over boiled hop, a little grassy in the nose. Big fresh cut hay flavours from the hops as well as a think graininess ¬Ö both flavours don¬ít let up and try to dominate each other. Lightly metallic and salty in the palate. Mild crispness with a light body, malt flavours are mostly dry and grainy, the only sweetness is upfront and it does not stay around for long. As the graininess kicks in the hops double up with bitterness and show some astringency though in a semi cleansing way to the palate. Comparable to the usual mass produced imported lager.","Jason","May 08, 2002"
