For some reason I have passed this beer up for the last 4 months since I first seen it sitting along side it's counterpart brews from Karbach. This is one of the finest lagers available. I picked up a six'er at HEB. I like cans, they are the next thing in craft beer, stays fresh and gets cold fast. This beer taste like a lager should. Clean, crisp and refreshing with a nice balance. Good lacing if poured. The can taste great as is. Maybe a good BBQ beer, beach beer? You decide. Don't be afraid to try this one. I'm happy with it.

4.03,13.2,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"From Karbach Street to Chez Woody, I began with a standard Crack, followed by an inverted Glug, resulting in cascading action at the juncture between liquid and foam. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. The tawny head was massive and lasting and resembled the top of an ice cream cone. Nose was pleasantly malty and sweet and I am OK with that, especially in a lager, following so many AAL clunkers on The CANQuest (TM) to date. Mouthfeel was medium and the grassy Saaz hops were immediately obvious on the tongue. Finish was dry and moderately bitter and I CAN get behind this! I would take this to the beach or put it in my cooler for Hula in the Coola Day (01 February, annually). Houston, I have no problem with this beer! Bravo to all involved.","woodychandler","Aug 05, 2012"

3.73,4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Smooth graininess with a pretty big punch of hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is surprisingly full and rich for this type of lager. Id actually place it more in the American Pale Lager category or maybe a helles as opposed to an Amber/Red lager. There is nothing amber or red about it. Whatever you call it, it is damn tasty. I’ll be buying this one again, for sure.","twiggamortis420","Mar 10, 2012"

Karbach blew me away with their first release. Not so much with the others. Still very enjoyable and worth a try.","champ103","Sep 28, 2011"
