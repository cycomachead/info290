Country of origin is definitely Holland but this stuff is brewed by Hofbrauhaus in Braunschweig, Germany. 16 ounces in a six pack of cans for 7.99 you really can't beat that price. But how does the actual beer match up to the price. The symbol is the royal orange tree with a crown over it, can alone is very nice with blue silver and orange color pattern, literally made me want to buy this beer and believe that it was something special. Aromatics don't impress me much more of a muted cooked vegetable, corn syrup fermented out. Although brewed in Germany, I don't think this was brewed with just malts, hops, barley, and water. As I take a few more sniffs there is something pleasant about the overall smell I'm getting that makes it bearable. Flavor has an assertive grainy flow that has metallic edges and moderate sweetness suggestive of corn/malts with mild light herbal muddled hop grassiness. Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated lighter bodied mass produced industrial lager from Europe. This beer has a history of an original site in Holland, that has been bought out by Interbrew, now Inbev, and is just now part of a portfolio of similar beers that will sell well to the masses. Overall a slightly above average Euro lager with some redeeming qualities in between some rather harsh moments in each sip.","WVbeergeek","Feb 24, 2012"

Sure, my sixer was a little more expensive than a rack of Miller, but that is the trade-off for not using adjuncts. You CAN't have it every which way but loose. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant lager sweetness in the mouth. Finish had a faint taste of honey, another characteristic of unadulterated lagers.

The nose is nasty: strong of malt and cabbage - not a pleasant experience at all. It doesn't seem skunked, really; just bad. The mouth is light and harshly prickly. The taste is not horrible, thanks to lots of sweet and bready malt. There's a touch of peach or apricot, but even that is a bit on the overripe side. Very little hops emerge in the finish as just a tickle of dryness in the throat. Overall, this beer is a waste of time.

It's light/medium body appears nicely crisp in the mouth due to a fine, median carbonation. The taste, however, is quite basic with a well-balanced combination of moderately grainy malt (some adjuncts are used), light grassy hop flavor, and restrained bitterness.
