I've seen reviews saying that the beer si bitter, however in Ontario, Canada we have the 5.5% version, and I find it quite sweet. It is also fairly smooth going down.

Smell and taste are sweet, grainy, and apple-like aromas, a bit pissy, light grassiness, butter, some 'adjunct funk,' canned corn, empty maltiness, and a hollow, metallic astringency to end. Similar to most macro beers, this likely contains hop extract instead of actual hops. Mouthfeel is not quite medium with a vague spiciness midway. Mildly dry finish is grassy, floral, and somewhat tinny. Yikes! On first taste I thought this was decent, but I now realize why Tuborg Gold is $1.95 per can.

The head was billowing, pure white and left decent lacing off the skim but otherwise retained poorly. The aroma was standard Euro Pale Lager, corn mash, slightly musty malt and hints of yeast. The flavors were at first slightly sweet but the malt then got blended away into the slightly herbal hoppy flavors leaving no distinction between the two. Not balanced, just sort of mashed together. Nothing else was going on beyond that. The body was medium/light, the carbonation a little too high and the mouthfeel prickly and watery. Typical and unpleasant.","thekevlarkid","Dec 07, 2008"

Just cracking the seal released a sweet smell that simply screamed ""LAGER!"" It produced a finger's worth of thick, bone-white head that sat atop the beer like a layer of marshmallow Fluf. The nose was very sweet and seemed to fill the room with its overpowering scent. The color was a slightly cloudy golden yellow and the mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. It was fairly sweet on the tongue, but I experienced a really unpleasant metallic flavor on the finish. I am finding with these Euro-lagers that the cheap ones are not much of a bargain.

Alright, this is immedialtely paler and less malty than the Lapin Kulta I just had, but theres a certain smoothness of character that must be acknowledged. It does seem to be free of the adjunct and addictives of an American macro, and it has a nice lacy foam and plays well in a flute glass, and when I set the glass down, it kicks out an attractive stream of bubbles. But while it has nice sensory character, its still just ""beer"" taste.","DrunkMcDermott","Feb 25, 2005"
3.44,26.9,4,2.5,4,3,3.5,"Very good lager. Poured out golden yellow with a fine white foamy head. Odors of malt and a touch of cooked corn. Crisp, straight forward lager flavor that I feel many beer advocates will over look and judge as average or bland. Flavors of malt and smooth bitterness along with hints of corn and grains. I really enjoyed this brew and will be buying it again. At 6 bucks a four pack of 16 oz, it's a nice change up. Recommended for lager fans.","Frozensoul327","Feb 08, 2005"

This one poured a typical clear golden color but had a nice white head that stuck around and left a bunch of lace om my glass. The smell was of overly sweet maltiness and not much else.

Not much lacing. Bit of a rim on the top where the pour meets the glass, nothing underneath. Smells like wet vegetables. Notably pees, cardboard and sulphur. Sorry, I meant peas, cardboard and sulphur. Tastes bland. Wet bread, basically. Mouthfeel is thin. Drinkable on a hot day, but I'd probably prefer water.","slitherySOB","Aug 27, 2004"

The cooked veggie taste is definately there. Definately not worth the price at $1.50 a bottle. The only highlight of this brew was the apperance. It had a nice head that lasted a little while and then thinned out. Other than that, the beer was nasty and I definately know what to stay away from.

2.65,-2.2,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Packaged in a green bottle, it pours a pale and clear yellow color with a quickly fading white head. Produces almost no lace. Fairly high carbonation. Grassy, noble-hop aroma. Musty European lager aromawith a hint of malt underneath. First sip is sweet and a bit malty. Mid-taste is lager-like and a bit hoppy. Grainy throughout and a watery, uninspiring finish. Its probably above average when compared to other euro-lagers, but thats not saying much. I probably wont be having this one again.","Suds","Feb 01, 2004"

In smell and taste it is remarkably unremarkable even for a lager and this is good or bad depending on what you expect from your beers.

One of the few beers that is probably better canned than bottled.","Brent","Oct 27, 2003"

Flavor begins weakly malty, starts like light brown sugar but then the bottom falls out with subpar mouthfeel. Finishes with an indelicate vinegary quality that's enhanced by the super thin body. I can't give this ordinary drinkability like some Lagers, there's an unpleasant sharp tone to the finish of this brew that spoils the fun.","ADR","Oct 14, 2003"

A foamy white head lingers awhile then settles into a thin coating. The thin light roasted malt give very little in the way of flavor or body (sort of a Rice Crispies taste).

The head drops shortly but it maintains a consistent 1/16"" surface covering and leaves some very nice lace as well. A combination of grainy malt and herbal hops make up the aroma which is pleasant and inviting. The body is medium/light and couples with a standard level carbonation to leave it gently crisp in the mouth. The flavor is that of almost any basic European lager. The malt and hops meld seamlessly, backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with a lingering note of herbal hop flavor on the tongue. Well made and easy to drink, but lacking in enough character to want you to have more than one or two.","NeroFiddled","Jun 11, 2003"

Compared to other lagers, Turborg has a much stronger taste, definatly in the ammount of hops used. From what i think, a very refreshing beer, at any time of the year.
