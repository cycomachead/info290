Poured from 0.5L can into tulip. ABV says 4.5%; but all writig is norwegian. Pours a golden color with a finger of head - actualy nice lacing and rim of head remains. Smell is skunky fruity ""heineken""like. Taste is a bit fruitier than most of the style, but its not bad at all. Nice euro lager flavor, sweet, slight hops, but honestly its pretty good.

Taste is mostly what you'd expect from an EPL - quite watery with a slight hoppy bite although that's followed by a strange metallic flavour. First few mouthfuls feel quite full and fizzy followed by a cleansing dryness on the palate although the carbonation seems to wear off in the glass very quickly. Drinkable enough beer if you're looking for something resonably refreshing and very light in flavour - could potentially quench a thirst when eating something spicy.","Ruaidhri","Nov 26, 2009"
2.73,1.9,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This beer pours a pale straw yellow with a thin fluffy one finger of white head. Head retains alright, leaving big soapy lacing on the side of the glass. Nose is sweet, corn based adjuncts, with a hint of grass. Taste has a malt character that is not detectable in the nose. Definite presence of grass, grains, and corn. Finish has a bite to it, though no real hop is present. Light bodied, high carbonation, feels very thin, somewhat watery. Goes down easily, but nothing very special.","Jayli","Aug 30, 2009"

Smell was nothing to relate to except that of a normal lager, although smelt rather fresh. Taste was a pleasant surprise, nice and crisp with a sweetness that lingered for a while which ended with a bitter note. Mouthfeel was rather thin and was very mediocre on fizz.
