"O- Crisp and light like an American Adjunct Lager but with an added burst of hops, although rather mild. Easy drinking and pretty tasty for a lager. Better than any adjunct for sure. This would be a beer a would drink with a nice steak."
"Tastes like industrial waste and vomit"
""
"Solid, highly drinkable lager.  Goes down easy, beats big brand macros any day.  Very nice to pair with food as well."

"O: Taste exceeds the nose by far. Labeled a Euro Pale Lager, this stands out in uniqueness and flavor. Enjoying it, the new can style is really hip as well."
"According to the brewery's web site, the company conducts 45 minute tasting and product knowledge sessions every Friday and Saturday for a cost of $10 plus taxes, but no longer does tours."

"Overall - A fine beer, but as one of the two craft selections on tap that night, it was merely the best available beer. Wouldn't hesitate to get it again, but with other watering holes just around the corner offering over 20 craft selections, I probably won't be back to try this anytime soon."

"Overall: This isn't a great beer but it isn't bad either. For a craft lager, I'm pleased. It's easy drinking and something you could sit down with for a long time. Probably a step up from LaBatt and Molson Canadian (though I've not tried either of those), but not notably so."
"Poured from a tall boy into a true pint, the beer is a bright, yellow-gold coloring with a ton of carbonation bubbling through the body and a thin, frothy, bright white head. Nose of toasted grains, floral hops, and a touch of honey sweetness. Flavors of toasted bread, honey and caramel subtle sweetness, and a pepper spiced and floral hops character at the end of the palate. Very balanced and very clean. The aftertaste is roasty and bitter, with some buttery highlights. Clean, smooth finish, which is slightly effervescent due to the carbonation. Decent, and very drinkable."

"Nothing wrong with this beer, just not particularly memorable, fine for a hot afternoon."

"Not my personal favouritee, but believe it to be a better choice within the style-type than many imports."

"Overall â€“ There is just something not right about this beer.. I can't put my finger on it, but it there is an odd musty taste to it. Not something I'll have again."

"Final Grade: 3.4, a respectable B-."
"I doubt even the most casual, easy to please lager drinker would find Amsterdam Natural Blonde anything more than 'comme ci, comme ca' at best. The only worse lagers out there are those racked with industrial adjuncts; I don't think I've ever had a less tasteful beer that wasn't either skunked or soiled with additives. I can't imagine a reason to drink this again."
"Pretty easy to drink if it's ice cold, but gets too stick and overly sweet to remain enjoyable."
"I suppose this is better than a lot of macro lagers out there, but really, is it worth it? So many Ontario sessionables I'd rather have than this..."
"d-I got a soft spot for this beer. I always forget about it and rediscover it when I head into the Beerstore and can't figure out what I want."
"Splitting a pitcher of this. Pours a clear golden yellow colour with thin white head and almost no lacing. Smells of lots of grains and some very mild hops. Flavour is very clean with some very mild bitterness. Good carbonation. A typical bland Ontario beer."
"Drinkability - Not a beer i would seek out again or recommend to anyone looking for a pale lager. It does not offer much along the lines of unique taste."
"D- Very very easy to down, and not a bad choice for a cheap can. One hell of a beer compared to most macros, but that doesn't say much."
"D: Drinks decently."
"On tap at the Woolwich Arms in Guelph, Ontario. Pours a sparkling yellow body, with a thin white head. Faint fruity and hoppy aromas pair up with mild hops bitterness in the mouth, and a grassy lingering finish. Good amount of carbonation. Standard fare."
"Overall, a decent beer at best, but since I have yet to session more pronounced, craft beers, this is the best to date. More tastey, more body and more drinkability then the other standard sessioners. Excellent in the field of macros but mediocre at best in the field of crafts."
"Had on tap at an Irish bar in Toronto (Flynn's or something, can't remember the bar name). Overall this was a disappointing drink, not unlike any number of macro lagers as I will attempt to qualify: The beer is clear as water, lpale yellow hue, thin white head. The smell is muted and neutral, mainly malt. Very mild flavor, hops are present only in a meager bitterness, malt is minimal, nothing offensive but nothing compelling. I don't want to be overly critical so I'll note that this has good carbonation and is not hard to drink. I wouldn't have actually ordered it if not for the paltry nature of the other selections."
"This isn't a beer I would revisit, simply because its not my style, but I think its been done fairly well and have to give it marks for that. It does lack some of the complexity that could be there, but I suppose that's not essential for a simple summer quaff."
"Well, this is truely a gem of a beer from Toronto! It reminds me alot of Brick's Red Baron, anyway onto the review! Beautiful golden yellow color, with a 1-2 inch head, that sinks down to a .5 inch head, and leaves rings of laceing all down the glass. Smell is great, smells really fresh, malts, and nice hop aroma. Wicked. Taste, well I really like these Blonde Lagers, like really like them. So to me this is perfect. Goes down smooth, carbonated, with a nice crisp hop finish, with little after taste. Great. Mouthfeel is full, carbonated, and satisfying. Drinkability is through the roof, when cold these can be consumed in excessive quantities, and even when warm still very drinkable. Overall my secong favorite blonde lager, next to Red Baron. If you liked that beer, you will definatly like this beer! this is HIGHLY reccommended!"
"Overall its a pretty standard blonde. Nothing special here, though I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't overly sweet."
"Watery mouthfeel, lacks body, overall a decent lager that I probably wouldn't buy again, but it is cheap."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with a big pure white foamy head with medium retention and no lacing. Aroma if quite refreshing with a light sweet malt profile. Taste is also quite one-dimensional with some medium sweet malt and very subtle floral notes. This beer was as easily drinkable as it is easily forgettable."
"This is the type of beer that's a welcome switch from traditional bland macros, but the bite of the taste leaves something to be desired and I couldn't see myself downing a lot of these in a row. Pretty much a by-the-numbers European lager."
"I tried this beer on October 28, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The bottle poured a very nice translucent gold into the glass witrh a very loose frothy head thad disappeared quickly. The aroma is mildly hoppish with citrus tones. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with mild carbonation. The taste is a combination of citrus tones, hops, and a little grass."
"A pretty mediocre lager, relatively bland and too sweet. Its not offensive, but the lack of hops makes it not worth visiting again, at leat for me."
"Smells and tastes similar to a macro but with a bit more hops and sweetness from the malt. Notes of light grassy hops on the nose and palate along with sweet malt and an unpleasant metallic taste. I can't recommend this one but its nothing awful."
"D: A decent drinker."
"This was a piss poor lager. I've had cheap macros that taste better than this. Not worth the money, don't waste your time with this one."
"D - Quite drinkable, but not something I'd go to often. A crowd-pleasing, basic lager without any off flavours."
"Last of a six-pack brought over by a friend a couple of months ago. Although not a lot stands out in this beer, notable items for the style (at least around here) are a) lack of any adjunct flavours, and b) a really solid body and smooth mouthfeel. Other than that, a good, straightforward light-tasting lager that's widely available in Toronto, and therefore often a good option next to the macro selections."
"Taste is hoppier than expected from the nose, which is a pleasant surprise. Malt is subdued and well-balanced with a light roasted character. There's a nice lemony sourness to go along with that. Dry with a Medium body and medium carbonation. Drinkable and good for hot day."
"Clear, light gold colour topped by a short, white head that lasts about halfway through the pint and produced no lace. Smells of light malt and citrus hops. Mild flavour, mostly malty and sweet with minimal bitterness or hop character. Light body, moderately high carbonation. Overall, the character is a little thin throughout."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, medium white head forms, minimal lacing on the glass. Smell is malty, some citrus hops and a tiny bit of skunkiness, little bit of spice. Taste is malty, minimal hops and anything else, pretty bland and tasteless. Mouthfeel is light, medium carbonation and slightly refreshing but almost tasteless."
"Poured a pale gold colour, with a small white head, ok lacing, not much head retention. Faint malt aroma. Taste was grainy, a little hops, some lemon taste. Finish is dry. Good amount of carbonation, quite drinkable on a hot summer day with some wings. But otherwise just a mediocre lager, a step above national macros, but nothing special."
"Not a bad stab at the all malt universal lager style...but like all Amsterdam brews, just a tad watery."
"Soapy, thin mouth feel a la typical Amsterdam. Another mediocre lager. Complements of Bow & Arrow anniversary night. Yellow colour. Some hops and bitterness. Better than water on a hot day on the porch. Spot fruity mid-sip from sample of yeast in there. Better in bottle, complements of Pootz."
"Poured a honey color with a white head that didn't stick around too long. Smell is barely of yeast and a bit of hops. Very clean, considering. The taste is not spectacular - a bit of yeastiness, a bit of maltiness, and a crisp finish. Mouthfeel follows suit - decent, but not exciting. Sure, I could drink this all day. I could also hammer tacks underneath my fingernails, but that would be more exciting."
