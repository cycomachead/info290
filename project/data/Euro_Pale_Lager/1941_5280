I did not have an appreciation for lagers until I embarked on The CANQuest (TM) and came to realize just how many adulterated versions of lager exist in a CAN. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very dry, driven by biscuity/cracker-like malt and grassy hops. Mmm. Finish was likewise quite dry and very tasty.

Aroma has a mild skunky dose of hops that fits the Euro pale lager style quite well to offset the hops come some cereal sweetness blended with a cooked veggies tone. Flavor contains mild bitterness and more of that characteristic skunk not too much green bottled gone wild skunk but the edge is there along with this comes mild lemongrass blended with hints of light toasted malts and corn/rice adjuncts in there as well. Mouthfeel is light moderate factory made carbonation does tickle the back of the throat a bit, but smooth and unihibited for the most part.

The head retention is average and there's only limited lacing left about the glass. The nose expresses straw-like malt and an herbal hoppiness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp. The flavor is clean with a surprisingly broad malt and hop character. It has a bit of a nutty character that's interesting, and I can't really place where it's coming from, although I suspect it's the grain. And although there's also a very light touch of fruitiness to it, it's really quite one-sided with just the grainy malt and herbal hops dominating. The bitterness is remarkably well-balanced though. The low-key sweetness of the grainy malt and the kept-in-check bitterness of the hops do more to dance together more than they do to lock horns in a stalemate. Eventually, the bitterness prevails at the swallow, and the herbal hops linger amidst a dull bitterness. It's decent enough, but not really memorable.","NeroFiddled","Aug 01, 2006"

2.95,-3.3,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Light copper in colour and well carbonated. A little bit of grassy hops and skunk on the nose. Cereal malts, herbs, and subtle spice flavors are apparent. Thin bodied, and a short finisher. A fairly average and drinkable pilsner, but it needs considerably more bittering, flavoring, and aroma hops to be of any interest.","fisherman34","Aug 12, 2005"
2.75,-9.8,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Clear medium yellow look, white head of a half inch in hieght, decent duration -- but breaking up with cheap large bubbles exploding. Laces in sparse downward dripping strings. Alight maple syrup aroma, some glue, some slight grape suggesting bare hops. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation a bit too fizzy for me. Flavor starts out malty, some corn syrup elements, but backed up by a medicinal bitterness. Becomes flat and thinner mid mouth. Finish is a little below par, chalky and slightly unpleasant in the throat. A little more hoppy than some, average drinkability, some off things going on.","ADR","Jun 29, 2005"
3.63,19,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"This beer pours a clear golden color with a white head that fizzled away shortly after the pour. The aroma was mild. It has a light malt smell with no real hop aroma coming through. The taste is refreshing. Light malt flavor with a little bit of hop in the finish. Leaves a little bit of a dryness on the tongue. Good mouthfeel, medium carbonation, and a light body. Its a drinkable beer. I would recommend it. It's a good drinking beer. I could see putting a few of these down in one sitting easy.","Brian700","Jun 20, 2005"
3.21,5.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability is decent, but this one fails to impress.","merlin48","May 29, 2005"
3,-1.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a very standard clear gold under a very standard one finger white head that fades pretty quickly to leave absolutely nothing behind. Standard adjunct corn and malt nose with a run-of-the-mill metallic hoppy scent. Standard light and pretty prickly mouth. The taste is pretty standard for a macro - some sweet barley and corn, followed by a touch of hops with a hard edge and a lingering bite. The aftertaste is like chewing on a tin can. There are so many better beers in the world, but this is nothing less than a mass produced, least common denominator product that I am sure sells well within the standard. Yawn.","Globetrotter","Apr 17, 2005"
2.77,-9.2,4,2,3,2.5,3,"It took me this long to get to a Polish beer. This one was on clearance for 99 cents at Cub Food, so why not. This is pretty good as this style goes. Pours a big temporary head over a golden body. Definite bitter hop taste seems to impart slight toasty quality to the malt. Smell is pleasant, but with slight oxidation, but thatÂ’s the chance you take.","DrunkMcDermott","Apr 01, 2005"
2.8,-8.2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"4th of the 10 LCBO bland euro lagers. This one pours like a labatt product golden, clear, fizzy white head that doesnÂ’t last...faint aromas of boiled grains with light medicinal hopping. sharp front side (mostly from too much carbonation obviously injected to bulk up the mouth feel of this thin lager) light malty taste...medicinal hops increase into the fast finish where they leave a light bittering taste... a bland forgettable Polish pilsner.","pootz","Feb 13, 2005"
3.3,8.2,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery with tiny bubbles of carbonation. A nice brew to drink in the summer or when you're just looking for an uncomplicated lager to quench your thirst.","orbitalr0x","Dec 17, 2004"
2.58,-15.4,2.5,2,3,2.5,2.5,"This beer pours a super pale gold with a quickly dissipating head and minimal lacing. The aroma is quite weak, with sweetish cooked corn and just a wiff of hops. The taste is a little better. The downside is the adjunct laden malt profile. The up side is that this actually has some hop character. Theres nice herbal, grassy hop flavors on the palate. Unfortunately the plasticy adjuncts detract from the hops. The mouthfeel is processed and there is a slightly chemical aftertaste. Overall this is only an average beer. The extra hoppiness distinguishes it from most of its Eastern European Brethren but its still not great.","CAMRAhardliner","Dec 10, 2004"
2.7,-11.5,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"(Dec 2005) Second taste...same. But the price has gone up to $1.19. Put another buck in and buy a 24 ounce Becks Bomber.","wgk","Nov 21, 2004"
4.15,36.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A deep honey colored liquid and butter-colored head that holds up pretty well actually. The aromas are fairly intense with piles of cracked, raw grains including barley, wheat and corn plus a dose of sweetened, candied hop resin. Fruits are strawberries and canned, fruit cocktail. On the palate it's broad, creamy, dry and nutty. The texture is full and chewy. The finish lingers on a harmonious note of roasted herb and dry honey flavors. Wonderfully executed beer that is plagued with none of the usual Warsaw Pact lager nonsense such as extreme alcohol presence, sewery hops flavors and jagged, industrial textures. It falls short only on one point - ambition. This is a rather straightforward, even simple lager - however generous and rich.","putnam","Aug 25, 2004"
3.06,0.3,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Okay, most Polish beers I've had were sub-par. Essentially, skunked pilzners. This was a bit different. Better. Tyskie pours a crisp, light yellow colour. The head starts out around two fingers, and disipates to one. What impressed me is that the head lasted until the end. What confused me was that for such a long lasting head, their was no lace. Take a big gulp, and the lace quickly runs down the glass and back into the head. It's as if the foam is calling them to come back, in fear it will disappear. Smells somewhat skunky. It's a brown bottle, so I doubt it was from light. It's a faint skunk smell, so I'm assuming it is the saaz hops. Their's also a unique malt smell. Not sweet, but starchy. Like stale bread. Tastes like bread at first, followed by a bitter aftertaste. No skunky taste whatsoever. The smell is still their, but the taste of skunk is nonexistent. Dry, carbonated mouthfeel. A bit light. Not a bad beer. One I wouldn't mind drinking again.","slitherySOB","Jul 18, 2004"
2.32,-23.9,2,2.5,2,2,3,"Pours to a quickly retreating head and pale yellow color. Aroma is weak, with grainy malt and typical import hop smell. Flavor is dry and bland. Decent hop and alcohol bite in the finish. Bland as hell and boring. The best thing about this purchase was the price. 99 cents for a 500ml bottle can't be beat for an import.","EagleTalon","Apr 24, 2004"
1.58,-48.2,2,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"Pale yellow. Really sweet and flabby, slightly syruppy texture, pretty bland in general however. Oh well. Another challenge for the character minimum, i'm really sorry, but i couldn't write more, there was nothing to write about, i could write stuff, like the size of the bottle what the label looked like, but theres really no point.","rastaman","Mar 01, 2004"
3.13,2.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel was kind of thin, but drinkabilty is ok, if youÂ’re looking for a no brainer type beer.","Redrover","Jan 05, 2004"
2.8,-8.2,3,3,2.5,3,3,"What can i say other than this was another clear, golden lager with little distinction. The headed faded fast. The nose was dull...very mild on the hop count. The taste again, was mild and bland. A crisp and clean mouthfeel. Drinkable but...what else? i dunno. The bottle claims that Tyskie won ""Gold Medal and Grand Prix at the Brewing Industry Awards in London.","Popsinc","Dec 25, 2003"
3.8,24.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice, light, golden colour with a dense white head. Strong lagery aroma with some sweetness. Medium-bodied; Sweetness in the taste, somewhat different than the normal lager. A sweet malt taste in the finish. Overall, a nice and refreshing brew. A pretty good beer for the style!","stoutman","Dec 05, 2003"
3.03,-0.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, lacking the fluffiness of a good pilsner style beer. Drinkable, sure, memorable, no.","Realale","Dec 04, 2003"
3.45,13.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a light golden and features champagne like carbonation, and sports a moderate head for the style and a trace of sticky lace. Aromas are clean and typical with grainy malt aromas followed by very light hopping. A refreshing brew that goes easy on the hop and just right on the malt. This is exactly the kind of brew that you want when you stock up at the local Polish deli. And, we have alot of em here in Chicago. Just right with a deli tray, and some perogies.","moulefrite","Nov 17, 2003"
2.53,-17,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste leans to the sweet side and has a mouth coating that will not quit.","Shiloh","Sep 20, 2003"
2.52,-17.4,3,1,3,3,3,"Anyways, in hopes of freshness still being a possibility, I pour it. SKUNKED! Yuck, the aroma was noticeable from across the room. It smells like Heinekin times 10. Well not so fast skunk! First sip, and....well...it was ok. I didn't taste but a smidgeon of skunkiness. What I did taste was a little bit of that pale lager sweetness and a touch of hops in the finish. Zingy carbonation, slightly watery mouthfeel, not all that bad. Smell? horrible. Taste? passable as semi-fresh. So I pinch my nose and finish, not as bad as I thought. I thought the drain beckoned it's call like the devil. But this beer was tolerable, maybe even better than tolerable. I will eventually get around to buying a FRESH bottle of this and re-reviewing it. Until then, make sure you check the dates!","AudioGilz","Mar 21, 2003"
3,-1.6,3,3,3,3,3,"I had reservations but they were unfounded, as this was a decent brew. My major complaint is that this beer seemed way too overcarbonated. Otherwise there was nothing offensive about it and I look forward to trying Tyskie's other offerings. I noted that ""Surgeon General"" was spelled ""Sugeron General"" on the label. Insert Polish joke here.","Dogbrick","Aug 05, 2002"
