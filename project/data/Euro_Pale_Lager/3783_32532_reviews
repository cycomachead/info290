"Good session lager, had this on draft in Poland, and glad it is available in the UK now. One of the better mass produced lagers that is widely available."

"Nothing special, very avarage in taste"

"O – Drinkable but not very exciting"

"Poured from can. Can’t really detect much of an aroma, maybe a bit floral. Pours clear and pale. The slightest hint of bitterness. Light and thin, with average carbonation. Overall, not that great, but still somewhat refreshing on a hot day."

"Overall: a standard Euro lager - acceptable but not mind blowing. I only bought a can of it, but apparently Dan Murphy's sells it for $36 for a case of 24 x 500mL - making it the cheapest beer by far."

"Overall - serviceable but indistinguishable pale lager. Ok, but non-descript overall."
"A truly boring beer."

"I prefer a bit dryer beer but for anyone looking for a good crisp Euro lager that might turn their wife on to beer, this could be it"

"Another 'Premium' beer, that offers nothing of the sort. At least this one is actually OK, I could see downing multiple cans of it, were I in the company of Polish friends at a summer 'cue. Otherwise, just an average Euro-lager, and all that implies, trope-wise, vis-a-vis their Yankee counterparts."

"I haven't had a beer from my ancestral homeland in a while, but this find on a local mix-a-six shelf lends me such an opportunity. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises musty wheat, light flowers, very light brown grass, and a faint hint of the beginning of skunking. I have no idea why, as the store in question isn't conducive to daylight entering the store to any appreciable degree, much less the beer section near the back wall, but at least the skunking seems to be at a decided minimum. The taste brings in more of the same, with the mustiness in full force, stronger than ever, providing evidence that the skunk-like smell wasn't actually evidence of skunking, but rather a crappy beer. Hell, the finish is awash in soil-encrusted tobacco. This is awful. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, what I thought was a case of light-taint turned out to just be a horrid beer. Well, at least I don't have to have a talk with the beer manager, and, better, I don't have to drink any more of this swill wannabe."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some pleasant flavors of bready malts, but it seems a little bland and like it could use some more in the way of hops."
""
""
"Like most Polish lagers this is a clean and well finished beer but with mot much in the way of complexity. Since it is in a can there is no skunk so the lightness of the beer tastes fresh. Nothing really wrong with this beer but no memorable at all so I probably will go with a Grolsch or a Wernesgruner next time."

"This wasn't exactly an interesting beer. Not entirely offensive, but there wasn't enough offered here that would make me reach for another one of these."

"I had worries about a green bottled beer from a cooler case but this had no signs of skunk at all and, for what it is, was a totally enjoyable beer..very good for the hot weather now."

"O: good decent lager, nothing bad to say about it"

"Overall an above the average pils, very pleasant and with high drinkability."

"Overall - An easy drinking lager from Lech. Nothing super spectacular with the flavours going on, but a very refreshing brew for a hot day. I always like to come back to my roots with Polish beers and this is one of the ones I return to."
"Didn't like this one at all. Normally if a beer is subpar due to an issue like it being past its prime or infected then I won't review. The brewer chose green bottles and thus, its skunkyass flavor. Pass, unless you can't find another Poland tick elsewhere."
""
"Normal looking pale lager, head fizzes away quickly, but I got a decent amount of thin lacing. Smells grainy, slightly lemony, weakly of hops and some honey. Tastes not bad, pretty good in fact, but nothing special. There is nothing off about this beer, but it is a bit thin in the flavor dept. A bit more of everything that's in here would make this a damn good beer. The way it is, this could be a go-to summertime quencher if it were cheaper."

"Overall: Recommend to anyone who looking for stronger fuller lager from eastern europe you'll like it."
"O Slightly too sweet but pretty good for a Euro lager, not offensive or dominated by ajuncts."
"Low profile beer, useless and avoidable."
"Final Grade: 2.73, an unimpressive C-."
"Overall, definitely not one of my fave's. I wouldn't turn it down but I don't see myself buying it again in the future."
"The taste was of sour grain and cheap hops. It was not especially good. It was better than plenty of American macrobrews, but it was definitely not good. My favourite thing about this beer was the name. Lech. I felt like leching, so I had myself a Lech."
"This isn't a bad beer, but its nothing special. It reminds me of a lot of the mass-produced Czech pilsners; easy to drink, refreshing, but not particularly memorable."
"Overall: ehhh, no taste?"
"just dont like the corn taste and the shitty malts they use.."
"This beer is good. Great balance of hops/malt and at 5.2 percent, it is more or less the perfect lager. Very impressed with this Eastern European Lager offering. Worth it for sure. I think that the only thing that could make this beer a tad better is if I could find it in a glass bottle, so as to not tamper with the natural flavor too much. Try this one!"
"If pronounced properly, Lech is a sound that would normally only ever come out your mouth when vomiting. But I assure you, it shouldn't come to that. Although it may not live up to Poland's full potential, it's doubtful to exercise any gag reflexes and, more likely than not, should actually prove itself a middle-of-the-road, easily quaffed lager."
"Pours as close you can get to clear, with a yellow'ish tinge. White head that dissipates with some lacing. Smells of cooked vegetables, with some very mild grassy aroma. Flavour is almost non-existent, but a some small off flavours in there. Not completely bad either, since the flavour is quite faint. Huge carbonation makes this a bit harder to drink. Would be ok on a really hot day, but not in the winter. Took a chance on buying this, not impressed."
"The finish gets more crisp as you drink it."
"Better than say Slavutich, and better than I expected. Would like to try a fresher sample however."
"Drink - A nice light lager, good for the summer months. An average beer that I might seek out again if the weather is right."
"Drinks similar to many other European Pales, such as Grolsch or Peroni. When you can find it on tap, not a terrible buy at a substantial discount over these more readily available brands. Still, nothing spectacular to add to the world of beer. Usually there are better alternatives to be had for the same price at most establishments, even in Poland."
"It is a good lager beer if you are thirsty, no more and no less. Balanced mouthfeel and dito drinkability."
"D. Light enough to drink several but only when kept very chilled. Taste drastically changes for the worse as it starts to warm. Drink fast!"
"this beer looked good but not much else, nothing offensive just nothing worth mentioning"
"Overall, it was fun drinking this beer. I knew it would taste like an American macro, but Europe/Poland has different malts and hops than us so it was fun to try something new. It was a fun experience. Fairly drinkable."
"Won't get this one again. There are much better beers of the style for that price."
"Very good drinkability. I'd seek this one out again."
"Interestingly, a .66 liter bottle. Poured into a pokal, initial head faded quickly. It settled into a deep amber with just a trace of carbonation. The aroma was very strong right after pouring, a slightly sweet and fresh scent. The mouthfeel was mundane and the taste middling. Drinkable, but nothing memorable. My Polish boss (from whom I received the beer) indicated that this is one of the most popular beers in her country. The lack of complication probably lends weight to it's popularity."
"This beer got my attention at my work, Wines Unlimited of Stratford, CT. We have a pretty good beer selection, especially of Eastern European Beers. This one, Lech seemed curious to me, being a Polish beer, it aroused my curiosity, because I have had some decent Polish beers the last few weeks. This beer is amazingly drinkable, but lacks a nice head, and lacing. The head is a egg foam like appearance which is nothing to scream about. The beer is colored with a pale golden hue with transparent waterline edges. Also, while it maybe very versatile, it tastes of a watered down lager, similar to a crappy Pilsner, (not that I hate Pilsners of course) but a little better. However, it still sells very well in our store, for probably two reasons, one being that it is a Polish Beer, and that our Polish clientele will naturally go for it, and two being that most Americans prefer light lagers, or Pilsners anyway, so when they experiment on a unknown beer they obviously get something they think they would like. Overall, this beer was ok, not great, very drinkable, and makes a good addition to any beer selection."
"A great pour into a tall flute got me two fingers' worth of bone-white head with solid retention. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a definite lager-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice lager sweetness on the tongue. Finish was definitely lager like."
"Lech Premium, like most beer with the word premium on the label, is fair-to-middlin' at best. I was all set to call it Blech, but it's actually a decent, drinkable version of the style. And it's better than most American pale lagers with multi-million dollar advertising budgets."
"was served at an outdoor bar near old town, Warsaw. Had a big white fine, foamy head with lots of lace. Color was a bright, clear polished brass. Aroma was a common beery, very fresh, clean and balanced 'tween malt and hops. Flavor's exactly the same. Body was decent and so was carbonation. Not a lot of flavor; nothing offends. It's ok and that's about it. Finish is very short, bittersweet leaning towards sweet. Could be a session beer because it's so easy."
"Thanks to a friend for bringing this can back. Fresh, like this, it's a decent Euro lager. Clean and well-made, but nothing special in character. It's more simple proof the brewers are technically adept than anything else. It's slightly sweet and smooth, and completely unremarkable."
"Drinkability - Totally middle of the road. I'm not spitting it out, I'll enjoy the rest of the pint. If offered another, I might accept. But I might also go for the many other better options for this style."
"It's just a weak beer. It is too sour, kind of like a Pilsner gone kind of wrong. There isn't anything that stands out and it leaves a bad aftertaste. Not a fan."
"Pours a clear dark yellow not quite gold with a white head and active carbonation. The smell is hard to detect but a little earthy like grain. The taste is slightly bready with some grain hop. Some euro skunk. THe mouthfeel and drinkability are okay. It goes down fairly crisp and clean but I couldnt see myself drinking more than one every once in a long while."
"This this is basic Polish lager, which is what everyone drinks when they're not drinking vodka."
"Drinkability: It is average on levels but it is also refreshing."
"If you see this one, give it a shot. It'll be in my basket the next time I'm out."
"D- Very drinkable."
"D- Drinks quick and painlessly like a cheap Euro Pale Lager should"
"D: Drinkability is not very, a typical euro-pale that underachieves and leaves much to be desired. Don't bother."
"Not one of my favorite beers. I bought it because I was told Polish delis in my area cannot keep it on the shelf. Tyskie is much better. Whoever is buying it up can have my share."
"Drinkability: In fairness, it was drinkable, just nothing special. Actually left me with a little stale aftertaste that could only be abated by another drink."
"Typical blah Euro Lager ... no horrible but nothing I'd go back to again."
"Nothing particularly special, but better than the average EPL, in my opinion. At only a buck and small change for the 500 ml bottle, it's not a bad ""lawn-mower"" beer."
"D- Poor taste, poor mouthfeel, i dont feel refreshed, just a stale residue left on the tongue. Give me a Rothaus Pils!"
"Chicago"
"Poured a pale yellow, pretty transparent, but with a decent head that disappeared soon after. Smelled like an indescript lager but with added stale sweetness. Sweetness becomes much more apparent in the taste, overcoming any corny adjuncts or sharp edges. Slight hop bitterness - not much to speak of. moderate carbonation. fairly watery, making for weaker characteristics but higher drinkability. Almost like a light bock, if I may be so bold. The only english words on the can are ""premium"" and ""party," so I didn't really know what to expect. However, this beer significantly surpasses the standard american shitty macro lager in taste and drinkability. So drink on, lager loving party people."
"This had an almost clear golden color with about 2in white head. This had a very light aroma, almost musty. It had a smooth taste, was light in the mouth with medium carbonation. There was a slight hop after taste but very unimpressive. Not too much else to add. I was able to drink 4 or 5 pints before going to my room, so it was drinkable."
"Taste is fairly clean but a bit unexciting. Grassy hops, wet earth, crackery malty sweetness with just a hint of alcohol in the finish. Medium dry mouthfeel, medium body, and well executed carbonation. This a decent, inoffensive Euro Lager, not too sweet or cheap tasting, a good thirst-quencher."
"Had big notes of fusel alcohol that one would expect to have in a malt liquor, big notes of corn on the palate and in the nose. One could do better by visiting or revisiting other Polish beers and I thought a better name for this beer would be Belch !"
"This is an above average Polish lager and I am surprised I like it as well, if not more so, than Okocim Zagloba."
"Overall i found this to be a nice change. If offered, give it a try. I think i might pick this up again, maybe in the summertime."
"Looks like a pale lager, clear yellow/gold, thick white head forms, starts to disappear rather quick, some lace spots. Smell is sweet, lagery, some citrus and floral, bit of corn, nothing special. Taste is sweet, little bit malty, light honey, floral, average at best, quite weak. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Moderately refreshing, carbonation is lighter than average, easier to drink. Still pretty crappy though!"
"Crystal clear pale gold. A large bubble floats up now and then. Initially, the head was puffy and white, settling down into a thin collar after a couple sips. Soapy, saazy hop aroma. Some grassy notes, and crispy, crackly pils malt. The flavor is much like any continental lager, with perhaps a more pronounced floral fruitiness. A trace of apple and freshly mown grass, sitting atop crisply grainy pils malt. Lagery smooth, moving quickly into a moderately hopped, floral and soapy finish. Feels softer, less dry than your average euro lager, maybe more in the bohemian style. Still has that nice snap-off in the finish. An easy drinker after a long day."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" white head above the clear light golden brew. Frothy head fades slowly, with ample sticky lacing. Aroma is Saaz hops with a light sweetness. Taste is pale sweet malts upfront, with crisp and lightly spicy hoppiness, with a clean close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice, this one is a great representation of the style. Would gladly have this one up again."
"Overall a good feel about it, I am not a big Pilsner/lager drinker, but this did enough to please me and I will be drinking it again, not regular, but if it is hot, I am thirsty and it is cold in my fridge."
