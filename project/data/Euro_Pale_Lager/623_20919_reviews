"I got this one as a trade from a buddy of mine. I'd say he did right by me as it was an easy drinking beer."

"Enjoy"

"If price did not matter I would not buy as there is better beer out there. But the price allows me to drink a beer worth drinking when on a budget, its worth your pocket change to buy something for a party."

"Pours clear golden with good bubbly off-white head, retention is ok, some laces are present, but all quickly dissipates. Smell is clean, malty, rather sweet. Taste is full malty, slightly chalky, bitterness is weak, definitely lack of hops. Low carbonation, the beer loses all gases before being imbibed. Dull."
""
"Overall - Decent beer for the style and affordable. Would purchase on occasion again in the future."

"Overall: Disappointed here. Definitely some off flavors popping up on the body. I would definitely pass on this and go to other Polish pale lagers."
"Tatra poured a crystal clear golden colour with a thin white head that disappeared inside one minute. This beer actually looks more like a cider...but certainly has the aroma of a beer. Sweet malts dominate the aroma, with a hint of wet dirt...the combination of which actually works well. Its taste was sweet light malts up front, with a hint of wet dirt that disappears almost instantly, and a mildly bitter finish which lingered for a few seconds. I would describe Tatra as a smooth beer, easy drinking and light bodied, though with a bit of a thin mouthfeel to it. In summary, a decent beer most notable for that unique 'wet dirt' aroma and taste (not a bad thing in this case), but not memorable enough that I would buy it again. It was interesting enough that I will try some other Polish beers though. Tatra is reasonably priced at $1.90 per 500 ml can."

"Tatra isn't going to be one of the first names which I conjure with Polish beer. Could be worse....could have been infected (I'm looking at you New English)."

"O- Some nice hints of flavor in here but a bit thin and watery and the hops start to take on a soapy quality as it warms."
""
"Overall, a very tasty beer. It's a little hard to find here, although I might seek it out one of these days."
"O - Easy drinking, but nothing spectacular, though I wasn't expecting to be blown away. Typical euro pale lager and nothing more, it's pretty unlikely I'd ever pick up another can of this."
""
"A- To me this is the epitome of many european lagers- smooth and easy to drink with a decent ABV, but really nothing spectacular. It lacks any real aromas or complex flavors. It isn't bad, but it isn't good either."
""
"Maybe the score given doesn't do it justice, since overall it offers a good drinking experience, nothing too vile, nothing too fancy, and for being a cheap euro lager, it does its job well."

"I lived in Poland for about 8 months, in a small, provincial town that resembled something out of a Disney movie as a kid, or an English period piece with Daniel Craig. While there, I found that the only beer available was lager and lager, and occasionally, dark lager. I liked the beer prices in Poland and liked how I could pick up a few brews from the supermarket (being from Canada, we can only buy liquor in liquor stores). This one was something I picked up as an alternative to the Zywiec I normally drank, and I was glad I did. It poured a decent light yellow and it smelled really quite sweet, but not off-putting. I drank it from the pint glass I had in my concrete, Communist flat and I enjoyed its sweet nectar as it flowed nicely. I had another just to make sure, but this is one I would probably pick up from my local liquor store just for the nostalgia. It won't change anyone's life, but it will make you happy you tried something different."
""
"Not sure we need another Polish Lager in BC ( we have 5 already) but this is a decent take on the style that has a full mouthfeel and tasted pretty fresh probably due to the can. I used it to make beer brats for a New Years Day lunch party and I tasted pretty good out of the can as I cooked those sausages."
""

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is very mild and is of malt and grain aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight grassy and hay flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but nothing too special."

"Overall - An easy drinking, refreshing lager from Zywiec. Not much to this one, but quite enjoyable."
"Was hoping for a bit more flavor."
""
""
""
"Although not a beer style I'd ever choose (unless on a n over-night train within Europe), certainly not the worst variant I've ever tried!"
""
"This is a tolerable example of the style, definitely nothing special and not particularly refreshing either, which sucks because that's kind of the only reason to drink these lagers (other than maybe price). Not the best Polish beer I've had by a long shot, but acceptable value for the price. There are no compelling reasons to drink this and I doubt I'll get it again. Very comparable to Zywiec, but I'm a Tyskie or Zubr guy."
"The beer is what I figured it to be, an unobtrusive pale lager without much character or flavour. Straw yellows, fizzy white head with no lacing. A bit of cooked corn and sweet mat on the nose. Decent body with sweetness and little else of note. Not what I want in a beer, but it would be a decent alternative to a macro lager."
"The first few sips were quite nice: sweet, flavorful, refreshing. But the sweetness of the brew - coupled with the lack of anything else interesting about it - becomes tiresome after a few sips. Really nothing much to say, other than I suppose it's a touch better than most Euro lagers in that the tinny-metallic-herbal character is minimal at best. But there's nothing different here."
"The smell was light, nice grain and yeasty bread like smell mixed in with some kinda light fruit, maybe some banana, and a touch of alcohol, but it was pretty standard lager. The taste was like a really strong budweiser. It tasted like your standard fare macro lager, buch just stronger. Typical grain adn yeast, maybe some corn in the flavor."
"Well I was right with the lager part, I grew up on Yuengling Lager and I have to say I now find this more drinkable."
"This beer is more or less the poster child for the EPL style. It has lots of bubbles, lots of glass lacing, a high alcohol percent (my can is 5.5 abv) and it's got that skunky characteristic which I've come to know and love EPL's for. It delivers. But it does nothing else. A classy high abv session beer that would theoretically get the job done a slight bit quicker than a coors light or comparable light beer. Not ""worthy", but at the same time...totally passable and drinkable."
"D: Because it comes in a tall at my seller, the size is enough to not want to get another one."
"Drink - Pretty much like every other Euro macro beer out there. I wouldn't buy this one again."
"I know it's kind of disagreeable, and even lazy, to cite 'inoffensiveness' as a leading attribute, yet here it is indeed apt - there seems to be multiple potential sources for off-flavours, yet everything, in the end (not to forget the beginning and middle), meshes quite well, rendering quite a decent, if eventually forgettable, and of course drinkable in the now, eastern Euro-lager."
"D- Generally this is easy to drink, however, it is slightly boozy and metallic, and really comes through on the side and back of the palate as it warms, so I would recommend having this extra cold. Other than that, it is one of the better Eastern Euro beers that I've had and would get this one again."
"Picked this up at my favorite Polish deli, Delikateski in Concord, Ca. This wasn't half bad, but overall, nothing to exciting. I don't know if it's storage or age, but most of these tend to be sweet-maltiness, with little else, not much else. Very drinkable, but could have a little more character."
"Rather strong alcohol taste which is odd for a bohemian type jasne Pelni. While the grassy side is present as in all beers of this style but we find no malt in all its qualities, including one where the sugar comes in a subtle way to make the beverage so easily drinkable, which is obviously harmful for beer thirst."
"I realize that this is not an ice beer, but the parallels it has in taste and aroma, justify an indirect comparison. Overall, its not a bad beer, but its not one that I nor many people on this site will be rushing to revisit anytime soon. However, all in all, for costing only 2, it was 2 well spent."
"My initial pour created a finger of foamy, bone-white head that was intent on dissipation. Bye! Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Pale lager, my butt! This was much more colorful than most AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers. Nose had the standard lager sweetness, nothing wrong with that, but it CAN become boring. Mouthfeel was medium with a clean, crisp lager sweetness on the tongue. Finish was likewise clean, refreshing and adjunct free! While there was nothing especially notable about this beer, I would choose it over the Warka that I had earlier. I CANnot say exactly why, but it was a nice overall beer that might make its way into the cooler, especially on a hot summer's day."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Yellow, crystal clear, with a head that foamed up but then died shortly thereafter. No lacing to indicate it was ever there. Corn, cereal grains, and a mild tang in the nose and the palate. If there ever was an identical taste and smell, this is it. DMS, very slight cereal, and a metallic twang. Thin, watery, no depth, hardly any flavor, hardly any excitement here. I poured it just so I can get on with the next beer."
"Adequately malty, decent zytec hop balance dry finish...a very unpretentious 2 dimensional Polish Pilsner Decent but not outstanding"
"Throughout its history, Poland seems to have always had the misfortune of being neglected, taken for granted, or outright invalidated; their beer is no exception. There is still much reverence for Czech and German brewing traditions, yet Poland's brewers seem to have been forgotten. Too bad, some people don't know what they're missing."
"It is the kind of stuff you drink when you want to have an easy drinker that packs a little extra abv."
"This is a pretty good Polish lager in my opinion. I will definetly buy this again."
"It's easy to drink and the 6.0% alcohol is barely noticeable. I just don't know if I'd want more than one due to all the cheap sugar."
"Very drinkable, Tatra was something that aroused my curiosity due to its high volume of purchases at the store I work at. It is a good Pilsner like beer, light lager style. It has a malty back bone with sweetness. Dry finish, almost too dry. Quick head, little lacing."
"Not my pick among the Polish choices out there."
"nothing overly offensive just a little average in my books, there's better Polish lagers out there for a similar price"
"Flavor is passable, again just a variation on a worn out theme. Fizzy astringent cardboard corn drink. Bleeehhhh. Horribly metallic, corny, with a cardboard aftertaste. Not worth finishing. This is horrible beer, don't let the new label fool you. Foul tasting, watery corn silage. Do not drink... this is garbage masquerading as beer."
"D: reasonable, though a bit sweet, so a pounder feels about right here. Wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this, labeled as a Czech pils, but lacks crispness and the bright saaz hopping ive come to expect per style. A average/decent beer by itself , per style comes off as a poor representation."
"Overall a decent euro lager."
"Can from the LCBO- Deep yellow liduid pours a fizzy white cap. Faint floral hops meet grains and honey. Tastes of sweet grains with metallic floral hops, a bit of biscuit and pale malts. The abv doesn't seem to be a factor until the very end, where it starts to creep up."
"Pours an insanely bright and clear golden, darker than most Euro lagers, medium sized but slightly fizzy white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around the glass, few lace spots stick. Smell is sweet, sugary, somewhat fruity, honey, strawberries, apricot, toasty, almost a doppelbock sweetness to it, very heavy and malty, some light grassiness, not bad. Taste is similar, sweet and toasty, some citrus, floral, lightly fruity, honey, weak in the finish, watery, biscuity/bready malt. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not a Czech pilsner but alright for a Euro lager. Has a real nice maltiness to it, not bad stuff."
"Drinkability is good. For how cheap per bottle this stuff is, it isn't a bad beer. It's a smooth brew and it does taste good, but it feels a bit unfinished. Not bad, but it could be better."
"Somewhat disappointing for a beer with ""Character."""
"In the end, did this beer have character? Nope! Did it have a full bodied taste? It wasn't even close to that. Was it truly Polish? It sure was because that's where the label said it was from. I thought this was another cheap macro tasting beer. At least this beer was cheap! I don't remember how much it was, but I know I didn't pay much for it."
"Pours a nice deep golden colour with about a 2 finger fluffy head that quickly dissipates. Smell is very sweet and bread like; doesnt deviate much from the smell of a standard pilsner. Has a nice full bodied sweet taste with a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Even though this goes down easy, I dont think Id like too many of them. Overall a decent brew, but Im not a big fan of czech pilsners."
"This is a decent Euro Lager with a good malt profile. I wouldnt really classify it as a pilsner, the hop presence isnt there."
"D - Overall, not bad. Nice clean pils."
"This was a new can I saw at my local LCBO, so i picked it up. Tatra pours out a really nice deep yellow color, with a nice thin layer of head. Looks exquisite. Smell, was the worst thing about this beer, but it wasn't even that bad. Nice floral hop aroma up front, but there was a metallic smell to it, and that kind of ruined it. Otherwise pretty good. This was a nice smooth, crisp tasteing pilsner, with a nice bittering crisp finish. Really good. Mouthfeel was full and slighty carbonated. I really enjoy cold pilsners, so for me I could really knock these back. This is almost as good as Uruquell."
"My expectations where not met."
"Expiry 02-04-2009, from a can into a tall Boddington's Pub Ale glass, it surprized me with a half finger off-white head and good carbonation to begin with. Initially looked like clear apple juice although it was more pale gold with a slight orange hue once it settled. And settled it did, it was down to a wispy film and minimal lacing after a third consumed and then only slight carbonation. Smell was distinctly corn-inspired with a wet grassy aroma. Taste was much more malt than hops, very macro-lager but not offensive. Mouthfeel was a bit dull and the finish abrupt. I can't say there was nearly enough of a bitter presence, something was missing that might have made this a finer beer experience. Still, it was quite acceptable overall and would likely go down even better if one were kicking back in an outdoor patio in central Krakow or overlooking the mountain vistas in Zakopane and could follow it with a Zywiec Porter. Sto Lat!"
"The aroma is very true to type with grainy malt and grassy almost herbal hops. The appearance is pale gold with an average head. The taste is also true to type and matches the aroma almost exactly. The aftertaste is clean. The palate is thin but OK for the style. Overall it's a pretty average beer but not ""Beer With Character."""
"An unremarkable brew. Tough to find tasty stuff from Eastern Europe ..."
"D: I won't this one again, much better pale lager are on the marketfor the same price (2,05$)."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are about average. Couldn't bother to be impressed by much about this brew."
" ~ I'm lucky to been able to sample this good beer. It pays to have friends that travel the world."
"Crisp and clean tasting, light malt, some dry corn, a little tartness, and a mild hop bite in the finish. Bubbly carbonation but made for a thirst quenching brew. Overall a decent Pilsener that got the job done, not outstanding but nothing to really complain about."
"Overall - An OK beer... worth a try...."
"D: I'm not disappointed by this canned beer at all--to put it more positively, maybe it's time that I try to review some canned beers as they are presumably well-made and better than I thought they could be..."
"a big head vanished into thin air as soon as the glass hit my tableno lacing, no foamy film. nuthin. really weak malt and no hop character to speak of. i suppose it's possible i got a watery pour, but this was pretty disappointing. it fell short of a few of of the BJCP guidelines for a czech pils (not that this should always guide one's opinion)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" white head above the clear light golden brew. Head is frothy and lasts well, with delicate lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet, with a pervasive spiciness. Taste is smooth malt pale sweetness, with a crisp, spicy hops character. Mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying for the style, which sometimes seems watery, but not this one, and drinkability is superb. If you see one, try it out."
"Aside from a rather thinnish body, this is a pretty nice pilsner. I'd place it more in the bohemian/czech style, with the soft roundness of flavor, but again, it could use body and a bit more malt presence. The bitterness is great, but the malt contributes very little flavor, especially in the finish. I actually enjoyed the flaws, the esters and phenols that contributed some extra fruitiness and clove-y notes. The high(-ish) alcohol may have something to do with that. I like it for what it is, rather than looking at it technically. A flawed, but good pilsner. I'd recommend it."
