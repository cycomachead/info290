"Draft in a pilsner glass.  Pours a golden amber with little head.  Clean and clear.  Traditional lager done right.  Well balanced hops.  Not bitter. Smooth.  Easy drinking.  Nice summer beer.  Good effort."

"O: Overall pleasant, drinkable, and refreshing, but I think I would pass this one by for others in similar styles."

"Poures into a becker a dull light goden with a half finger bone white head atop that leaves a few broken globs of lace behind as it settles.Grainy with a light smack of herbal hobs in the nose but it's pretty clean.Quite dry on the palate with a decent crispness and pretty full feel.A good after work beer and will go good in my homemade German sausage Iam making tomorrow."

"I began by demonstrating the Crack! and inverted Glug, producing a finger of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a gorgeous golden-yellow (SRM = 7) with button-brightness and I was shocked to see Croesus, Midas and Mammon appear, but it was just that golden. Usually, they CANfine themselves to my kitchen. Nose had a clean maltiness, not fouled by unwanted adjuncts, along with a light grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was soft and the interplay between the malt and hops was just what I am looking for in a lager. Nothing pretentious or over the top, just a nice, clean beer. Finish was semi-dry with the grassiness coming to the front. I was glad to have tried it, even in a field setting, and I would have it again if the situation called for a CANned lager."
"O-an above-average but not extraordinary lager. I'd go with their kolsch over this one."

"Over all I like this beer, but will probably not have it again unless it is offered to me. It is nothing spectacular just a solid beer that is worth trying but now that I have had it probably wont purchase again."

"An easy drinker and rather sessionable. A nice light offering suitable for the season."

"Light straw-yellow color, clear and bubbly, with a thin white head. Light grassy aroma, thin pale malts. Taste of pale malts, lightly toasted grains, crisp but timid grassy hops, lager yeast. A pretty standard Euro lager here, good, if that's your bag. Light body, slightly bitter in the aftertaste. An easy drinker, but not exactly my style."

"Courtesy of Strykzone. Pours a metallic gold with an off white head that hung in there well and left good lacing. Nose of caramel malts and some floral hops. Body light to medium and palate is clean and crisp. The flavor is well balanced between the malts and hops. Well made lager can be very nice to drink. This is a nice one."
"Drinkability: This lager is pretty standard, but it really did the trick after a day at the beach"
"Extremely smooth mouthfeel and completely drinkable. There's no crazy aftertaste, it's not too bland, this is one to keep in the fridge."
"12 oz. bottle with clearly marked freshness date. Brewed to 13P, hopped to 22 IBUs and lagered six weeks at the brewery. Nice clarity on the pour yields an amber hue reminiscent of a marzen, with moderate carbonation and an inch of frothy head that leaves some wisps of lace. A bit fruity in the nose, vegetal, with perhaps some caramel and hops. Tastes toasty (Munich or Vienna malt?), with a light fruitiness, and some green hops that impart a mild bitterness on top of a light and dry body. Not too bad; could be a bit more fresh (was in the back of the fridge), but reminiscent of a Vienna lager. Worth a try when down in Virginia."
"Drinkability: easy to drink this beer. Not overly exciting, it does hit the spot on a hot day."
"They tried way too hard to come up with that name. It pours a clear pale straw topped by about a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat and some light citrus hops. The taste holds notes of light wheat, greens, and a vague floral bitterness. The body is light, with a lightish carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a decent pale lager, but nothing special."
"This is a solid local offering. This is my local Go-To Beer. Pours a Clean straw color with a great two finger white head. smells of roasted grain and fresh hops. Tase it great. Again, it's grainy, mild bitterness due to hops, hops lend a faint piny note balanced malts. It's not overly complex, but solid enough to return to over and over. If you ""just want a beer"" this is your ticket. This is one local brewery that i speak highly of often."
"3.0 D: Not terrible, but definitely much better lawnmower beers out there."
"Overall: Middle of the road lager, nothing great, but an easy going beer that you could drink multiple of during the evening."
"Tastes creamy smoothness and modest hop bitter. Nice hop flavor is earthy and turns tin-like in the aftertaste. Grain flavor is beneath the hops as biscuit or light toast. Hint of an off flavor, either sulfur or DMS. Moderate, but fine stingy carbonation helps clean the creamy mouthfeel off the tongue."
"six-pack from the brewery in Afton"
"A very drinkable lager. Thanks to mntlover for my first Blue Mountain brew.."
"This is definitely a good beer for drinking on a hot, sunny day as it goes down very easily. An above average pale lager."
"M/D - I think this is an ok brew from Blue Mountain. Not my favorite, but i'm glad i got to try it. It might have been my bottle, it seemed way overcarbonated and took forever to get it into my glass."
"Notes from and tasted on 02/19/08."
"D: An excellent all-malt lager. The style given here is off -- this beer has tons of body and is better tasted when the temperature can be controlled (and not overly cold) to enjoy the grainy and noble hops goodness."
"D - Drinkability is good. This beer actually went down easy and quick. I would have no problem at all haveing some more of these."
"Overall = I felt this beer was well balanced and very easy to drink."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a 1/2"" white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a dry, bisquitey lager yeast aroma. The taste is good also. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down a little sweet and finishes dry and clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a very enjoyable lager. It's all malt and easy drinking; a wonderful beer."
"Drinkability is just fine - this beer is what it is, which is a decent small brewery craft lager, and I wouldn't have any problem at all taking a six pack or two of it to a party."
"D: Could be a touch high in ABV for some, but I would certainly treat this as a session brew. Quite good for its class, and fortunately, it's a local brewery. It serves as a good respresentative of its style."
"The flavor is of sweet malt, a little graininess and the distinctive profile of noble hops. There is a hint of bitterness in the finish, but it is very slight. The noble hop flavor, however, lingers several minutes beyond the swallow. The first few sips reveal a slight fruitiness, but the firm maltiness and noble hop flavor soon overpower the fruitiness. This is an excellent lager, reminiscent of a fine Munich Helles."
