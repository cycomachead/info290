"Imported to USA by Global Village Imports LLC (KUNDA & SONS) in King of Prussia, PA. Reminds me of a skunked Heineken... it was nothing worth getting excited about."
"Always happy to find this in the UK, as it reminds me of my trip to Tasmania. It's a nice drop."
"Not a bad drop better than cascade"
"Skunky and nothing else. At least it does not taste as bad as it smells!"

"I am neutral on this beer."

"Pours a dark golden yellow with a small short lived white head. Aroma and taste is of grains, cereal, grassy and light fruity notes. A medium body palate, crisp with good carbonation. Finish is grains, grass and fruity. Overall a very non descript mass produced brew, but still an ok brew for summer drinking."

"The appearance and smell are wanting but the taste and texture are fine enough."

"In a time that is dominated by powerful IPAs and unique tastings brews, this was like a visit from an old friend."

"Food match: Look you're not going to be drinking this with a fine poached lobster tail in a light cream sauce, so really the cuisine this generally pairs with is junk food; pizza, burgers, fries, etc."

"O: Good drinkability. Standard Euro Lager, nothing special"

"Mouthfeel & Overall: lightly carbonated, medium-bodied, clean-ish on the palate although the sweetness does lend a somewhat slick feel overall; this is a grain-dominated lager beer which benefits somewhat from the belated entry of hop bitterness on the palate. Not very good, but, equally, not terrible."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent enough. Light hue, bubbly head, and some fair lacing. Nose is bready and grassy. Pungent bready malt, with a hint of sweetness. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a mildly average euro pale lager, too overcarbonated for me, and the flavors are just not out of range of other lagers of this style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I just paid US$1.75 for a Carlsberg that I could get in a 12-pack for 50¢ Each. Nonplussed. Cut the overall rating in half because of the value proposition."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very pale, yellowish golden amber with a hint of a white head and light slippery lacing. Aroma of light biscuit malt, grain and a hint of skunkiness (more evident after opening the green bottle), but fortunately not as noticeable in the glass. Flavor is slightly sweet bready malt, grain, hints of adjuncts and light grassy hops. Ends abruptly, but has a pleasant faint malt aftertaste. Light bodied. Pretty much a middle of the road macro lager, too bland to seek out unless you want to tick Tasmania."
"RJT"
"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent straw color with visible carbonation on the glass and a nice white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of grain but the ""import smell"" dominates. Tastes of plain grain like many macros, but with a fuller body. Beer goes down really smooth, high carbonation and that is ok, nice light body. Overall, a slightly above average beer, and Happy Australia Day from the USA."

"Overall: this is a highly drinkable and very clean lager. I feel like I could quaff tons of this stuff."
"O: Decent non-offensive euro lager. bland but seems to compliment most meals."
""
"O: This beer is quite drinkable. Although the taste is a bit bland, there’s nothing offensive about it and it isn’t watery."
"Poured an 1/8"" white head and left minimal effervescence in the body, but the head did last a surprisingly long while. Clear straw yellow body verging on golden. Smells grassy. Taste is BMC and light and smooth but definitely creamier. Medium long finish. Really, it's a pretty decent lager."
"O - Certainly not the worst or blandest macro out there, but I wouldnt pay for this stuff."
""
""
"Overall: a reasonable macro lager, better quality than the XXXXs and VBs. It is a bit more expensive, but overall worth the extra $5 - $10."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was nice and crisp, but did have a bit of a sweet, lingering finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down easily enough and I could see throwing a couple in the cooler for sitting by the bay. Overall, not a great beer, but it's probably worth a shot if you see it."
"Overall an average to below average pale lager."
""
"Tasmania's finest. Right on. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, very light grass, and I wanna say there's a hint of lemon rind, but that could just be wishful thinking on my part. The taste doesn't change all that much, though a touch of sweet flowers finds a way to work its way in there. It's all very light, very bland. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly watery feel. Overall, a bland, sad little beer. I'd like to think Tasmania can do better than this..."

"James Boag's Premium Lager states to be ""Tasmania's Finest Since 1881."" It poured like clear apple juice, with lots of rapid carbonation, and a huge fluffy head. Very mild nose, just vague sweetness. The taste, again, was extremely mild. A little tart apple, a little bitter/metallic taste, and a little bit of grass. Light, smooth, pleasant enough, but not enough flavor or substance to make it stand out."
"A pretty weak beer and not worth the ""import"" price. At least I got a tick out of it."
""
""
"So why don't mainstream brewers put some flavour in the beer?"
""
""
"As a Euro-pale I didn't expect much in the way of complexity. However, this doesn't have that cleanliness, or crispness, that the head and carbonation alluded to in the appearance. Even more so, it's a bit flat in flavor and feel. A lingering aftertaste of musky malt doesn't help."
"This beer poured out as a clear golden yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The head fades and doesn't do much in way of lacing. The smell of the beer gives off the earthy lager aromas that are typical in this style. The taste of the beer had a decent grainy and lightly hopped flavor to it. The mouthfeel was light but still had some good carbonation and body. Overall it's a decent brew."
"Better than a BMC, but not by all that much."
"Finish was semi-dry and very satisfying after having had salad for lunch. Worth seeking out? Probably not, but it makes for a pleasant tick. I drank this just before its Best Before date of 08/12/11."
"A medium-full body for the style helps to cover up the less-than-desired amount of carbonation. Overall, this is an average pale lager. It's absolutely not a terrible pale lager. You shouldn't run out and find it or anything, but its surprisingly alright."
"Nothing exciting going on here, with a creamy mouthfeel, a light crisp, body, high carbonation and high drinkability and what could be a session beer for basic beer drinkers, but this was so dull that I'd only drink it if there were no better options. Basically, it tastes like an Aussie Bud."
"Overall this is passable beer. I am not impressed but its not horrible either. Pass on this."
"Certainly drinkable, better than a lot of Aussie lagers, but nothing exciting. A bit of tweaking and this could be much better."
"Overall a nice drinkable beer that can be enjoyed. Medium body that has a smooth finish and after taste."
"I feel like this must be a typical type of beer in Australia, but I have no idea. It's not a bad drink but it'd a bit watery and bodyless for a lager."
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, and the drinkability is average for it's style and ABV. A decent lager, but nothing worth seeking out. I wouldn't turn down another."
"D- It's not a bad beer actually. I'm sure I could put back a bunch during a cookout. It just doesn't separate itself from the domestics or big name imports that fill similar genres."
"James Boag's Premium is a very easy drinker, but not the most impressive beer. There's really not much that distinguishes it from your average lager."
"Aroma is crisp and malty, not very inspiring but not repulsive either. It pours an average clear yellow with a nice fluffy white head. Flavor is malty and crisp, not complex, again about what one expects from a regular lager. Texture is fairly fizzy, and it leaves an OK tingle."
"D - As far as lagers go, this one is average and easily quaffable (if you really enjoy the style). Would be easy to drink on a hot summer day, but not being the biggest lager fan I would go for something else."
"Dr: ""Tasmania's finest"" is just that. A passable lager, but nothing special."
"Drinkability: This was drinkable but really only because it was the best beer on offer. I'll certainly not seek it out in the future and I found little in it to set it apart from the other Euro Pale Lagers I've tried. In reality this is a quite average beer with its best feature being the head."
"Even rating to style, this is still lacking in any hop punch or malt body. Not skunky and balanced, I guess, but largely insubstantial. Lawnmower beer for a *very* hot day."
"It's not really that offensive, it just has very little to offer. You could probably swill this down alright for a while, but after a couple you'd probably start to hate yourself."
"Drinkability - This is a very refreshing lager that's more American than Euro."
"D: Would recommend it if you ever go out to Outback as an alternative to Fosters."
"D - High drinkability if you're trying to get drunk. If you're looking for taste with a meal pass."
"D - good, similar price per 6 pack to eurolagers, larger bottles, smooth beer ."
"Drinkability: It's not much. It's drinkable and inoffensive, but I wonder if it'll give me diarrhea."
"From the 375 ml. bottle marked 28 NCL-14:48. Sampled on May 20, 2010. The color is mainly golden to pale yellow with a quickly rising then quickly fizzling white head. But the upward carbonation continues throughout. The aroma is potent with malts along with a honey-like scent. The mouthfeel is in the medium range. The taste also has this kind of honey sweetness mixed in the with the mainly malty beginning and lightly hopped finale. Not all that bad but also nothing outstanding. But I found it to be drinkable enough to make it a memorable experience."
"M/D: Watery with medium carbonation. Not very drinkable at all."
"Weak hops and grain flavor, but enough to make it beer. Slight mineral taste from the Tasmanian Esk River water source. Smooth and easy to drink."
"Overall, a passably inoffensive lager. I would drink this over Bud/Miller/Coors/Heineken/St. Pauli Girl etc... any day."
"Not too crazy about the slightly soapy character in the aftertaste. All-in-all it's a typical, run-of-the-mill, green bottled Euro Pale Lager."
"James Boag's Premium Lager pours a golden yellow with a white head from a green 12.7 ounce bottle. I can't get much of anything in the aroma, perhaps a slight bit of grain. The flavor is also pretty mild, a touch of malt, maybe some hops and a bit of a sour flavor. Unremarkable."
"D: Goes down easy, but not very flavorful, not a lot to this beer."
"Pours with a slight and short lived head. Appearance is clear and clean pale straw colour. Not much aroma other than a slight bready note. Flavour is crisp with a bready malt and slight grassiness. Not much in the way of complexity but nice simple drinking. It's an OK beer for a barbecue but not a great beer for art's sake. It's much better than the average OZ macro swill and if you only have these to choose from then Boags is definitely the Premium drop."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is of malts and a bit skunky. Taste is crisp, refreshing, slightly bitter. Feels light in the mouth. This beer is very drinkable, goes down with ease. Overall this makes for a good selection."
"D - A fine summer beer. Great for it's simplicity but not for complexity. The flavors in this beer don't misbehave. This is one of the best lagers I've tried in a while, and I'd pick this over dozens of pilzners and similar styles."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a slight head and very little lacing. The smell is of corn and basic hops. The taste is of a slight hop characteristic and some corn. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall you could drink a lot of these however, there is not a lot going on to keep your attention."
"Overall an above average euro lager."
"Tried this beer simply because it is from Tasmania. Poured a straw gold with a full course head that stuck around well and left some good lacing. The smell was full and sort of sweet but this was not reflected as well in the flavor. The flavor did come across as being a pure lager with a refreshing clean taste but did not reflect much in the line of grains or hop characteristics. The low carbonation did lead to a good finish to compliment this otherwise simple beer."
"D : Very tasty and refreshing beer. If I were in Australia, this would definitely be my session beer"
"(Bottle poured into dimpled mug) Had a nice clear gold color, with a slightly sweet aroma with a hint of spice. Felt smooth, but there was a very lively carbonation to the beer, something that surprised me looking at the pour. Refreshing drink, but a slightly bitter aftertaste which was also surprising given the aroma. There was nothing wrong with the flavor and it was very refreshing, but I would not go out of my way to grab this one again."
"D- This reminds me of a good Kolsch beer with the slight sweet sulfur note that enhances the hops but is not over the top. The full lagered malt flavors are great and it really is a nice lager with good depth and character. 4"
"Very clear, golden yellow, and when poured into a glass. This beer had a kind of sweet smell to it. Surprisingly it is not bitter, and it is really quite smooth, and I also found it to be light, crisp and refreshing. James Boag's is good, but its too much like a common lager to go out of the way for, at least in my opinion.  It would be a great beer if you're looking for refreshment as it does have that ""crisp"" thing going for it."
"Pours a typically clear, pale yellow with a modest white head that faded to a collar. The aroma is lightly skunky, not awful though. The taste is completely inoffensive, just like a lager, with medium carbonation. The feel is light bodied. Drinkability is very good, especially on a hot day."
"D: It's ok for a change, and nice to see what Tasmania is doing these days.. It says ""Tasmania's finest"" on it. I certainly hope this isn't true, for the sake of all it's citizens..."
"Encountered this bottle at an Outback Steakhouse in South Portland, Maine. The color is a completely clear gold with moderate carbonation, just a whispy white cover and similar lacing. The aroma is simple wheat and a vague grass hop. Not much else to capture here.The taste brings crisp grass hop, a little more bitterness than the aroma would suggest. Refreshing enough, good with a meal or on a hot day I suspect. Fairly thin but lively. Drinkable I suppose, but not much enticing here. Just another serviceable lager, and not very Australian based upon my Foster's experience. Don't bother if you have other choices but it's not bad if options are limited."
"This beer pours a clear light golden hue, with two fingers of puffy white head, that leaves a fair bit of lace around the glass. It smells of light, wheaty malt, and mild floral hops. The taste is somewhat acrid cereal malt, and a slight fruitiness, with a barely-there floral hop essence. The carbonation is quite abundant, the body moderate in weight, and it finishes off-dry and clean. Overall, if it wasn't already obvious, this is a very lightly-flavoured beer, but it goes down well in the patio sun, once the bubbles have settled. However, the only thing premium about this offering is the import price."
"D: Drinkable, but for the price I will not be seeking again."
"Drinkability: Eh. One of an endless line of faceless, instantly forgettable, vapid pale lagers."
"Overall though I enjoyed it more than most typical lagers flavour wise, I can't see myself every going out of my way for this. Over priced considering its not an import here and it's image as a sophisticated beer turns me off considering it's not that sophisticated a beer. In a pinch I'd probably save money and buy a XXXX over a Boags if I couldn't find a brew I really enjoyed."
"One could easily drink a few at a time and in a room full of macros this is certainly the best pick."
"Pours a slightly murky gold with a waft of vegetal skunk to the nose. Off-white head leaves this planet quickly but leaves a thick streak of lacing behind. Smells of green grass, straw and is a little musty. Tastes malty with a surprisingly good hop bite at the end. Pretty crisp overall. There might be some spice hidden in the background. I'm also noticing some more vegetal notes at the very end, which get a little bothersome as I go and don't sit well. Not overly tasty, but not a bad representation. Didn't have high hopes for this one, but it ended up working out ok."
"Drinkability gets a good mark. I liked it and had no problem finishing it. Not my favorite style, but that's the only reason I won't revisit it. If it were served at a party, I'd have it again."
"Typical golden lager appearance. Small head fades to thin covering. Lots of skunk on the nose, some grainy malt and an off-putting sewer like aroma. Sweet bready malt upon tasting, followed by what seems to be pride of ringwood metallic bitterness. Massively overcarbed."
"a drinkable brew, but i swear this is like champagne in a beer bottle."
"Taste: Mostly skunk and a fair bit of hop bitterness as well. This would probably be a really good lager if it wasn't for the skunkiness."
"Overall, it is not a bad beer, but it lacks flavour, sometimes there was a feeling the beer has been diluted."
"i liked this offering and would recommend trying. i would love to have this fresh on tap for comparison."
"Lighter bodied, but coats the mouth with a very clean grain flavor. No corn/rice/dextrose sweet bullshit. Everything about this screams macro, but it has character of its own. This has so much potential, but it is so goddamn watery that you just can't get much out of it. I can see sitting down on a really hot day and having a bunch of these to cool off, but it is about as close to H2O as you can get. Bought this as I wanted to try something from Tasmania. Won't get it again, but I can honestly say that I don't hate this either."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. One inch head with decent retention and slight to no lacing. Head consists of large bubbles that impede retention. Smells of clean yeast and slight malt. I couldn't detect any hops. It almost fits the style. Smooth and crisp mouth feel with high carbonation presents. Tastes of lager cleanliness and slight malt (mostly noticeable in the aftertaste). Weak body overall."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with very little head. What little white head there is dissipates quickly into a small colar. Minor laciness. Aroma is very skunky. Taste also carries the ""skunk"" as well as some barley. Very sweet and sour aftertaste. The texture is not watery but on the thin side. Flavor is not there to recommend as a session beer."
"Notes from and tasted 11/14/07."
"The mouth is crisp with good carbonation. Easy enough drinker given my limited choices. Would I buy it at the store, no, but it works."
"D - This is a pretty boring and unremarkable beer, but I think it would be a good ""food beer"" when you really want to showcase the meal and not the beverage. For example, sushi is one of my favorite foods, and its delicate and relatively expensive so you don't want to kill it with an IPA or something. When I eat sushi, I usually order a Kirin Ichiban or Asahi, and this would be a good alternative."
"Considering this was skunked and sort-of thin in flavor, this wasn't too bad. Obviously a fresher bottle would have drank better."
"Drinkability - This is a very refreshing lager that's more American than Euro."
"Medium body & effervescence, fairly smooth. I'm not a lager fan but this was quite good and I would certainly drink this again."
"Clear and yellow poured from bottle with slight head - soapy - decent lacing. Smells grain - corn some hops. Taste bland malt up front hop fairly clean hop finish. Deeper flavor than say harp - thin mouthfeel and easy to drink I suppose but not exciting enough to keep interest."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was bready smelling and had a nice golden color. The beer was sparkly and I thiought apply tasting like a cider almost. The beer had a nice white head. I did not think it was all that great and will not buy again."
"D. This was a fairly overpriced ""import"" at a resteraunt and I was fairly unimpressed. Not a great flavor, a bit harsh overall. I'd rather go with Fosters if I was seeking an Aussie Macro Lager."
"D: Average drinkability, but not as crisp per style as I like."
"It was a standard Lager, except for the nice little head of foam on it. That was the only thing that stuck out of this beer. Is it worth a shot? If you never had a Tasmanian beer that was brewed in Australia before. Maybe then."
"Worth a shot..."
"D: I think J. Boag & Son should invest in some brown bottles. Plain and simple. While I'm not a huge fan of lagers to begin with, I felt this one would have been pretty good had it not been so destroyed by its skunky quality. A missed opportunity."
"Overall, a boring macro Euro lager. Bland, but not offensive, so it could be used to wash down some greasy food."
"new at my local market, thought i'd give it a shot. pours nice and golden, some have compared to a beck's kind of color, i would agree. the nose seems very two dimensional, there's the soapy kind of smell and the slight lemon citrus notes. great lacing and real solid head. nice bubbles as well. overall really nice, overpriced i think but decent. not something i would go to tasmania for but not bad for right down the street, much better than some euros i've tried."
"d: one of the worst beers i have had in a long time; weaker than a lot of american macro lagers; never again"
"D- Pretty standard fair. I wouldn't complain if someone gave me one, but I wouldn't purposely try to order this. Not bad."
"VERY average beer here, not much to recommend it except it is something new. Not interested in trying another one."
"If I didn't know better, I would say this is simply Molson in another bottle. Pours incredibly pale with a light white head. Smells a bit of honey with a slight bitterness The aroma carries through to the flavor, which is slightly honeyish - thin, slightly malty with only the faintest echo of hops. Mouthfeel is pure water. Not horrible, but nothing worth bothering about either."
"This lager has a light golden appearance and a thin, light head. It had a sour smell; lemony, but also a hint of butter. It tasted a little sour too but not much of a taste on the whole; rather empty. There was no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp. This is a drinkable beer. It is refreshing after a hot day, but do not expect much as far as varied taste goes."
"I had this for the first time at Outback Steakhouse. It had a pale gold yellow color. They gave it to me iced cold in a pilsener style glass. Smelled of mild hops and some cereal grains. Tasted like any other run-of-the-mill lager which equals to not much of a taste. Probably the ""Bud"" of Australia."
"D - Not too bad, but I can't see myself wanting another, I can't help but ask myself, why bother? Not a bad brew by any means, just a watery euro pale that struggles to define itself."
"Taste has a malty front with a long, slightly acrid finish. Evidence of a long bittering hop addition late in the palate and a finish that definitely leaves an impression. Not quite so complex but certainly a fair amount of character on this palate. Mouthfeel though is slightly flat and lifeless. Overall, an enjoyable and interesting lager."
"Overall, I would not recommend this. It was a miller lite with a different label. Really a poor excuse for a beer, I really hate lagers."
"This pours pale yellow with thick white head and a good amount of lacing.It smells a bit skunky,with some slightly grainy notes.A very typical Euro Lager,tasting mostly like corn,and malts with some underachiving hops that leave a little more to be desired.I must give credit,this brew has a wonderful creamy finish that is crisp clean without the typical skunkieness I picked up in the nose."
"To be honest it tasted like your run-of-the-mill keg beer, great for drinking games, and perfect for a summer bbq due to it's crisp, clean finish. Best served very cold."
"smell is of a skumk (swamp scum+skunk) and old grass ... some head, but pretty weak .... ""it looks like it could gore"".... taste is sweet and the bitterness level needs work... a waste of 10 bucks, maybe if it was $6-7, but probably never ever again... better than fosters and steinlager from NZ but..."
"The beer is light, crisp and clean. The flavor disappears fairly quickly after you swallow it. Overall I am not impressed by this beer. Not enough flavor for my liking but that tends to be the case with a lot of lagers. If you do like it it definitely falls into the session category."
"The beer was Light in color, having a small white head. The taste was citrusy and hoppy. Smelled hoppy like you would expect beer too. Had a crisp smooth mouthfeel medium in body. It was really drinkable. Drank a bottle at outback with my king crab legs."
"When your looking for a cold one and have a few of these in the frig, more than likely you'll be grabbing one of these from the ""Land Down Under""."
"Drinkability: Tasty brew. Smooth, refreshing and satisfying."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a thin one-finger head. Aroma is mostly malt/cooked corn with some fruitiness and not much else. Taste is cooked corn with bitterness that makes it unpleasant to drink. A second sip confirms the same thing except that there's more sweetness than bitterness here. I don't honestly see anything ""premium"" about this lager."
"Poured a clear golden color with decent head and very little retention. Aroma was kind of skunky and not that inviting. Flavor was very similar to a Heinken. Not too impressed. Mouthfeel was pretty good, carbonation level was good. Drinkability was ok, if you like Heinken, you would probably like this"
"Some cheap beers are just that, cheap. Some of them have a time and a place; occasionally, a cheap beer tastes just right. My initial impression of this beer was that it would fit this mold, of having its own right place, but never being a ""good"" beer. As I got closer to finishing the bottle, I realized that there was no situation where this beer could usurp the rightful place of say, a budweiser at a ball game, a corona on the beach in the sun (cold as possible, of course) or any other situation based-beers. The smell left nothing, the taste reminded me of a light cheap lager, and was surprisingly similar in taste--I felt- to a Corona. Not a beer I plan to pick up again anytime soon."
"This beer poured a very clear light golden /straw color with a thick head  some retention. The smell is hoppy with a touch of sweetness. The taste is cereal and slightly sour. The mouthfeel is thin and there is a little lag on the tongue in the finish. The drinkability of this beer is good  fairly smooth. Id say it is a good cold quencher, but not extremely exciting."
"A decent beer -- no problem to drink, but I probably wouldn't get it again on my own. It gets tiring and tastes like a slightly spicier version of many Central American beers."
"This was close to scoring a 3.65 (if I had raised taste to 3.5), but my general thought is that this is not as good for its style as Boag's Draught, an American Macro Lager that I found to be tastier than the premium. Still, this is a highly competent lager with no real flaws, and it is priced competitively. I would choose this over a Crown Lager any day."
"Somewhat refeshing, but this one is a bit lacking in character"
"When your looking for a cold one and have a few of these in the frig, more than likely youll be grabbing one of these from the Land Down Under."
"D- Yuck. Not the worst macro lager, but pretty bad. Why drink this when you can have Sam Adams?"
"Sampled at Outback Steakhouse - expectations weren't high, and they weren't disappointed. Pours from a green bottle a light yellow color, little head and no lacing. Mild, lagery nose, some apple and adjunct. Taste is cidery, bit of lemon tartness and vinous character. Mouthfeel is slick, body is light. Drinkability is weak - I quickly switched to Cooper's Sparkling, which while not great is heads and shoulders above this swill."
"I didn't expect much, as it was at Outback, but while I wasn't surprised necessarily, I can say it's better than most macros. It's ephemeral in places, but at least it hints at some basic goodness. The strength here is the drinkability, as the light nature and crisp clean finish leave you ready for the next one without regretting the one you just finished. Life can be too short, but this is good enough overall to not waste one's limited opportunities."
"Overall Impression: Light, fizzy, yellow. Three strikes youre out. Not enough interesting going on to make me want another, but not anything drastically wrong either."
"Overall, a nice and refreshing beer. Reminds more of a czech pilsener. A fine lager that is full of flavor and body, yet still maintains the crisp and refreshing characteristics you would want."
"This well exceeded my expectations"
"I remember this having more flavour but oh well. This is a very pale lager with a real clean light taste. I rate well above the xxxx/ Foster's that taste of corn and finish sweet. This beer won't knock your socks off but it tastes just fine on a patio and is a good example of the style."
"I had this beer at a recent family event. Served cold, the brew was refreshing, but average. It has a light gold color and small white head. The aroma is of grain, a bit of european hops, and a little sulfur. It's similar to a euro lager. It's light in body, with a little more hops than similar brews. Fairly dry up front, with just a little sweetness in the mid-taste. It's a nice everyday lager. Nothing out of the ordinary, but a consistently drinkable brew nonetheless."
"Fairly smooth and easy drinking which is not suprising given where it originates from. Found it perhaps a touch watery, but still quite drinkable on a hot summer day. Unfortuantely, theres lots of similar beer at lower prices that do the same job."
"James Boag's Premium Lager is no better than the vast majority of Euro pale lagers that are actually Euro in origin. I know that Aussies are capable of brewing good beer. One of these days I'll run across one that proves that point."
" Pours a bright golden color, topped by an ephemeral wisp of fizzy white head that disappears almost instantly. Aroma of buttery sweet adjunct malt, a hint of light fruity hops, and just a touch of skunk (courtesy of the green bottle). Palate is light malt with some Euro noble hops, and a light sweetness towards the finish. The body is pleasantly creamy and a tad buttery. I guess the appearance and smell belie an otherwise solid lager. Pretty nice."
"Easier to drink than I was expecting."
"Pours a three-fingered white head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Skunky nose. Flavor is sweet corn with hops in background, good lawnmower beer. Why are premium lagers not premium?? $1.50 for a 12 oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Pours a golden clear color with decent head. The carbonation looks quite high. It smells a little sweet and an piney. The carbonation is very high going down, but moderately smooth. There isn't really any hop flavor present , but is quite sweet with some bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall I say this beer is so-so. There isn't anything special about this beer, but wouldn't mind having this again sometime. It would make a pretty good session beer."
"Great hoppiness in this one! Noble as all hell, grassy earthen flavour dominates, and there's a very little bit of apple juice sweetness but nothing cloying in here at all. Malt is just little bit nutty but it dosen't lend much to the overall experience. All in all an extremely refreshing and clean lager with a decent hop profile, which in this style is about all you can ask for. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but not overbearingly so. Extremely dry, which is also very welcoming. This is very, very drinkable to me, and it's finally the time of year when I'm wanting this type of brew. Fresh on-tap in a bar in Tasmania would be extremely pleasant I'd imagine..."
"Notes: This is one of the better euro pale lagers I've had to date. Very clean and refreshing without anything annoying or out of balance. I'd put this up with budweiser as far as being clean crisp and refreshing. I haven't had this enough to know how consistent it is but this six pack was outstanding."
"Drinkability was no problem and I found myself thinking this would make for a decent summertime session brew. Boag's Premium Lager is what it is; a decent lager which is easy drinking but won't set the beer world on fire. Still, not bad."
"Light floral hop taste and a good combination of grain & hops overall. This is actually a lager that managed to survive the trip over here pretty well and would be worth another purchase. Not a complex beast, but I'd certainly welcome a few of these on a warm summer day."
"Could be a an American macro or a pale Euro. Either way its another adjunct lager. Actually has head and great lacing. Although its in a green bottle, I dont detect any skunk. Just smells like watery beer, really. Taste is light, sweet, but a touch harsh and a little creamy. I'd call it a slightly bolder version of Bud Light (not quite Bud), but with slightly lightstruck."
"D: I'm more impressed with this beer than I thought I would be. Not to say that this is something that I would buy very much of, but for what it is and is supposed to be, it's pretty good. A good lawnmower or BBQ beer."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale malt scent along with a hoppy aroma that reaks of German hops and lager yeast. The taste is average. It has a grainy pale malt flavor that goes down bitter and finishes with hints of metal; yuk! The mouthfeel is decent. It's a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average Euro lager. It's light and bitter, but it just doesn't have good flavor."
"Drinkability: Drinkable? Sure, but at 4.25 a bottle I'll save my money for something better."
"Pours a clear pale golden color with a fizzy white head quickly fading into a wispy lace. Nose is fresh grain and grassy hops (thankfully, no skunky aromas despite the green bottle). Taste is sweet malt and dry grain along with some herbal grassy hop bitterness. Pretty basic. Possibly a good thirst quencher, but thats about it."
"pours a golden yellow with an average head with lots of carbonation, no distinct smells. tastes like you're average lager, watery and without much taste, the alcohol very present which is surprising for a beer with only 5%, unfortunately this beer is average and thats about it."
"This is an interesting brew. It's better than average but pales to the Kiwis much better Steinlager."
"(Down in Tazmania, come to Tazmania... WE MEAN YOU!)"
"It's always a toss-up between this and Coopers Pale Ale when I'm down at the bottle shop looking for a carton to take to a party or back home to watch the game with the boys."
"Notes: What the hell do the folks down under REALLY drink?! Not Foster's, not this stuff, Cooper's maybe? Anyone? Please, help me with this pondering and pestering question."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce green glass bottle with a pop-off crown, embossed ""Tasmania's Finest"". Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Tasted like a pilsner from America only better. No bitterness, and not too over carbonated, which was nice. Mostly smooth character with a grassy feel."
"Pours a clear yellow with very small bubbles that be seen only at the top of the beer. Light head only a half finger big with no retention. PLenty of grass, adjncts in the nose. Good and dry adjuncts though. The taste is a little tart almost, but I guess thats just the dryness of the light hopping and sanguine malts. Very refreshing, maybe dryer than I previously thought. Great session beer if I'm n Tasmania. I liked this lager."
"Good lager for all occasions... a 6-pack at the local Chinese would be perfect...."
"Overall- a typical lager, but I will say this is better than the average American lager. When I eventually make my way to Tasmania I would drink this again. Best on a hot day."
"Well, the Alstrom Bros. asked us all to be nice and practice diplomacy when reveiwing beer. Having said that, ...this beer is horrible. Well, actually, they asked us to give reasons why the beer is rated poorly if we, in fact, do. First, the beer leap out of the green bottle with a medium hue and low levels of carbonation. The aromas of cream corn gives my first impression. At second sniff, I also smell skunk aromas (uuummm...breakfast of champions.) The taste is, unfortunately similar to the characteristics found in the nose, though not as strong. The beer is adjuct laden, giving a grain flavor and texture. Little in the complexity department. The flavor does have light apple and pear flavors to go along with its moderate malt flavor; which saves this beer from hosting a really bad rating. The finish is sweet and less than refreshing. Almost scrubbed to the throat. Simply, not a good offtering."
"Worth a try but not much going on."
"I've been waiting two years to see this in the US and I finally found it at my local store. It was almost worth the wait. Smooth, crisp taste with just the right balance of hops and malt; and a decent mouthfeel. A bit pricey, but one of the few imports (outside some of the Germans) that I feel worth a try."
"IT is crisp cleansing and well carbonated , that at least lifts it above the average lager that is readily available, but I couldnt justify paying the premium price that it is undeservedly placed on it"
"Pours a pale straw color with a light white fluffy tall head. Pretty impressive for a macro. Sticks around for a while too. Smells yeasty and hoppy, no skunk, despite the green bottle. Good so far. Taste is not very malty, more hops than anything, but really not much of anything. No bad flavors though. Mouthfeel is a tiny bit harsh, but not bad. All in all, it's a good beer, very drinkable. Would be better if it didn't cost so much, though."
"BB 13-12-05. Good poorout with a nice head, not overwelming but lasting well. Nose is malts, litle sulphuric and litle oxidated. Taste is sweet malty, very light and probably very high fermented. This and no tastable bitterness make this one pale and flat. Oxidation did his part to it but am shure would pass this one fresh for anything with litle more taste."
"Pours a straw yellow with light foam head which dissapates quickly. There is a sweet fruit aroma which is faint but inviting. The beer itself is slightly hoppy, with a sweet middle and dry finish. It also has this distinct taste, which i notice in most Tasmanian beers. Must be the water down there. Anyway, good beer. Just not great. Does the job. A bit pricey though."
"Pours out a clear light golden colour, very impressive tight white head on the pour, and just as impressive head retention. Sticky, clinging lace down the glass. The nose is very sweet and fruity at first, that of ripe melon, accompanied by strong floral hops and a bit of sweet grain. The flavour, in turn, is the converse. Bready malt, some grain husks, and a very crisp dry finish with no real discernable aftertaste. In fact no real finish either, where did those hops go? I can easily tell that this is hot weather beer, brewed in a warm climate for the locals. It lacks in flavour but is very quenching, better than any Caribbean lager I've ever tried. Very dry and quenching mouthfeel, not exactly smooth because the carbonation does lend a bit of a bite. Not an exceptional lager by any means, especially not for the price, but not very flawed either. Just lacking in more flavour, but I get the feeling this was meant to be a quenching beverage for time spent in a hot climate."
"This is Australia's best lager, because it's flavoursome, refreshing, and a good session beer that everyone likes. It looks good, light gold (Beck's colour), has good head retention, it's very well carbonated (but not too much) and has different flavours in different areas of the mouth, most notably the aforesaid fruity flavours which only occur in the rear corners around the tongue. It's somewhat overpriced but is better than the other readily-available Australian and imported premium lagers: Heineken, Beck's, Nastro Azzurro, and is far better than Cascade and Hahn premium. It's not the best Australian beer, as certain Cooper's and Redback are superior, but it's definitely a reliable beer from a reliable brewery. It's got a nice picture on the label too - the one in the photo is wrong - that's now the label for Cascade premium."
"My only problem with this beer is its high price."
" overall, an average to good beer although i would be more inclined to experiment on something different before trying this again."
"Crystal clear with a deep gold sheen. The head is limited, dissipating quickly but leaving a thin, whispy layer of off-white around the edge of the glass. The aroma is pretty basic malt & hops; not impressive, but there are some hops here. The body is light and gives a somewhat thin mouthfeel. The flavor starts with a lightly ""bready"" malt, followed by some limited hop flavor, and finishes with a short dry hop aftertaste. Crisp, refreshing, slightly dry lager. Although this bottle doesn't show any signs of age (oxidation, etc.) I suspect it's lost a lot of it's character. Probably much better on draft."
"Standard Aussie lager, not much flavour to speak of, but quite smooth and crisp, sadly i don't think this will imporve now that San Miguel has moved in."
