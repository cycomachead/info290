I'll explain later. Anyway, it pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises white bread, corn, dusty wheat, and light honey. The taste brings in more of the same, with a dull sweetness and a vague twang of booze duking it out amidst the aforementioned elements. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty meager beer in general. As a marzen/O-Fest, it's downright terrible, but as a normal Euro lager, it's just mildly sad.","TMoney2591","Aug 10, 2011"

3.25,4.8,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Flaccid feel, clean and dry aftertaste, apple and papery notes dominate. Pretty much like every Polish lager out there, very clean but one dimensional. Not much in the way of noble hops here, they may have already faded (bottle not dated). Pretty dry. Clean and easy to drink, went well with smoked alpine sausage from Gene's also.","emerge077","Sep 29, 2010"
3,-3.2,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a golden yellow color with 1 finger of head that fades to a ring with some lacing. The aroma is a mix of grainy malt and that sharp, crispness common to domestic lagers. It starts off fairly bland and sweet, with just some light bitterness on the back end. The finish is fast and clean with just a hint of corn sweetness. The body is slightly fuller than a typical macro lager and the drinkability is on par with macros. This is a decent lager, but I would hardly call it a Marzen.","curasowa","Aug 10, 2010"
4,29,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Well I was not expecting a Fest beer when I picked this one up but there it is. I was thinking it was going to be more of a Czech Pilsener or a Euro Lager but it is well in keeping with a good old German Fest beer.","generallee","Jul 01, 2010"

2.47,-20.3,3.5,1.5,2.5,3,3,"This is the latest addition the unusually wide range of Polish lagers at my local off-licence, and one of the most attractive so far. But it's still not going to win any beauty pageants, not with its generic golden body and completely average white head. The nose is noticeably and aggressively alcoholic, smelling kind of like a can of cheap cider, without much nuance to speak of save a hint of sulfur and a touch of glue. The flavor is sweet and a bit thick, so if this style classification is to be trusted, then it's pretty much spot on, but that's the best that can be said for it. It tastes like some kind of lemony beer and rum concoction, and that's how it drinks. Not terrible, but far from recommendable.","soulgrowl","Jun 17, 2010"

Nose had a very Saaz hop/Pilsner bite to it. I am curious as to its being an O-fest. Mouthfeel was slightly watery with a lager-like sweetness on the tongue. I really CANnot believe that this is an O-fest and I have sent the company an E-mail for clarification. Finish was mild, unobtrusive, definitely some sort of Lager, maybe an O-fest, maybe not. Drinkable? Sure. Cooler worthy? Yes, but not worth seeking out. It would be a nice, simple beer to have with a nice, simple Polish meal, no question.","woodychandler","Mar 08, 2010"
3.01,-2.9,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"I thought it more of a Euro Pale Lager than a Marzen/O-fest, but I suppose the sweetness puts it into the latter... Anyway, it's a rather bland, sweet, though ""drinkable"" brew.","jwc215","Jun 27, 2009"
2.9,-6.5,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a dark amber body wqith tons of carbonation and a huge off white head. Aromas are caramel, malt, bread, and some hops. Taste is sweet malts, caramel, some hops, molasses.

I opened this brew expecting some sort of Polish version of a Euro-Lager and instead I was amazed to be treated to one of the best Oktoberfests I've ever had, and that's saying a lot since I've had quite a few and it's one of my favorite styles!
