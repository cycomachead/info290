As much as they have some bad reviews they bring back nostalgia and I would still rather drink them over Grolsch and Heineken. It was given to me in an Amstel glass. There was just the right amount of head and the lace had retainability over its transparent body. The aroma was crisp with mild sweet malt tones. The flavor is average for this style. Basic crisp, pils style lager. Mouthfeel is thin and watery.","MTNboy","Jul 13, 2013"
