I love Stella because it's great with everything and it's hard for people not to like. If you're looking for a mind-blowing beer, don't buy Stella. But I like it!","Michelleluw","Yesterday at 06:31 PM"

I started with those two just a year or so ago and now I'm learning to appreciate the Gulden Draaks, the Pauwel Kwaks, the EKU 28s, and the Samichlaus type beers.

A good dinner beer, goes with most everything, without the aftertaste you get with some American pilsners.

Lots of tiny streaming bubbles rising the whole time until the end. The aroma has that typical 'skunk' aroma that is so common in green bottles for some reason and also just grains. The taste is pretty much just of grains and sweet grass with a hint of corn. Slight dry finish but it is drinkable. Lighter to medium-bodied with lots of carbonation. Nothing really special and is just OK.","BeerWithMike","Jan 19, 2015"

Recently we have been enjoying the 14.9oz cans poured into Stella chalices.  The combination of the can and the chalice provides a nice lasting frothy head; nose is slightly sweet with a slight but not unpleasant “skunk” smell; mild hop flavor with some grain, generally very enjoyable.  Drinks like a light beer, but tastes and has the ABV of a “real” beer.","Baltimore_Adam","Dec 22, 2014"

I had heard of the reputation Belgian beers had and I this thought I was being sophisticated. Since then, I have discovered the Belgian style dubbels, trippels, quadruplels, strong ales etc that are truly at another level. Knowing this, I went back to give Stella a try for old times sake, knowing full well that it doesn't hold a candle to Duvel, Chimay, St. Bernadus etc. Nevertheless, I was expecting a pleasant crisp and refreshing change of pace as I used to remember it. I was sorely disappointed. This Stella thatbI tried had a grainy and skunky aroma that truly bothered me. The carbonation was low and the taste was watery and lacking flavor. I couldn't finish it. Have my taste buds grown so sophisticated that I've become a beer snob? Or has the manufacturing of this product changed for the worst. Either way, I did not enjoy it at all.","Gajo74","Dec 11, 2014"

Now, I am only a burgeoning beer advocate, and I actually credit this beer with getting me started.  I liked it on first contact.  It's a decent Euro Pale Lager.  The color and head drew me in, and hey, I hadn't been into the craft beers yet, so this to me was something different.  Now I know better, of course, but I would still get this if I saw it, and I would NEVER turn one down.  The taste is a little carbonated, true, but it's smooth.  I rate it up there with Peroni, which also has a tendency to get a ribbing here.  Still, this is a solid beer.  Don't dismiss it.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Nov 15, 2014"

2.92,-5.2,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"So overall would I recommend it ? Its a small yes. If you are at the bar and the price is the same as a Budweiser or Coors Light or bud light.. take the Stella Artois. But here in Quebec Canada the price for a 24 packs when its on special is 29,99 $ you can still go for it but if it isn t on special the price is around 34,99$ and for that price you can go for a 24 pack of Budweiser. So for me it's a small recommendation. But if you are in Europe go for it.","kevofficiel","Sep 13, 2014"

The taste is at first a reflection of the smell then immediately dies down to something far less impressionable. Undoubtedly does that kill a point or so in the taste score. With a beer of this piss yellow hue of course it will be a tad watery. And so the mouthfeel lost a point or so. Overall since this beer has some perks, I say give it three stars. Try it at least once. Its okay.","Gabriel_Vaughn","Jul 08, 2014"

The appearance is a nice yellow with a white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is rice, a little bit of citrus, and then a bit of malt. The flavor was a little skunky but had a clean finish and I found it to be pretty refreshing.

Standard for a pale lager, nothing special. Scents of lager yeast, maize, some bready malt and faint grassiness. Typical adjunct lager aromas. Nothing special. Flavor begins sweet, with strong flavors of maize, moving into some bready malt and grainy flavors and some dank herbal hops, finish is grainy with a decent level of earthy hop bitterness. Its a fairly typical adjunct lager flavor, made a bit better by the higher level of hop flavor than usual in American lagers. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a semi-drying mouthfeel. Fairly standard for the style. Overall this is a standard pale lager.

3.16,2.6,2.75,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"I haven't had a Stella since ""discovering"" craft beer a few years back and tried one on tap at a place where there were few better options. This was a staple in grad school and after having tried so many wonderful Belgian brews there was a certain appeal in rediscovering this best seller from the perspective of someone whose palate has (hopefully) evolved since then. In any event, the pint arrived in the classic Stella glass and although a lot of the time I am less concerned about presentation than other factors such as smell and taste, it was nostalgic to see the glass again. Stella is a pale straw hued, bubbly beer with some white lace and a rather sweet malt and yeast aroma. More yeast on the nose than other pale Euro lagers along with some fruity and floral notes. Hints of spice. The taste is similar, with pale malts and some Belgian yeast character that adds hints of banana and bubblegum that are pallid echoes of those found in craft Belgian offerings but nevertheless welcome. There are dry aromatic hay flavors and a rounded corny sweetness. Unfortunately some stale chemical flavors and DMS show up as the beer warms: Keep it cold if possible. Probably less skunky on tap than in the green bottle but I have not tried the latter recently. Better than the similar Heineken (more yeast character) but certainly a close cousin.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 24, 2013"

3.24,5.2,3.5,3.25,3.25,3,3.25,"Overall I thought this was decent beer and a good example of the style, it doesn't taste too similar to some of the other Euro Pale Lagers I have tried and I think that's mainly because of the yeast used in this beer, it imparts a unique flavor for the style. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these if I wanted to catch a buzz. I liked how unique this beer was the most. I liked the slight stale malt flavor the least. I would buy this if I wanted to take some beer to party and wasn't in the mood for craft beer and I think I would order this in a bar if there wasn't any better options. I would recommend this to people looking for a somewhat flavorful session ale. All in all this beer turned out to be better then I thought it would, It's not bad at all, I think it's a solid choice when not much is available.","StoutHunter","Oct 20, 2013"

I would say if you like ""Heineken"" you will like ""Stella Artois""..because they pretty much taste almost Identical,and I am a big fan of both,a Fantastic beer for summer cookouts,backyard BBQ's/partys,or when you just want an Ice cold Beer for a thirst quencher,Gr8 session Beer,will not wiegh you down,a very decent mass produced Macro Euro lager IMHO~Cheers!","Beerwolf666","Aug 20, 2013"

Both the head and the lacing is quick to dissipate. There is lots of good light penetration and just the ever-so-slight chill haze to it. This is the best attribute of the beer. The nose, however, is just average. There is sweet corn smell to it, processed white bread smell reminiscent to when I lived next to the Merita bread factory in downtown Birmingham. I'm not sure if they actually use corn adjunts, but I definitely get that whiff. There is the ever so slight smell of a spicy or herbal hop to the beer that comes and goes. The sulfur smell is slightly more prominent than I would like, and borders on skunkiness, but not quite. Just when I think it smells skunky, it goes away. The taste, like the smell, is just average, but the sulfur notes are much less prominent. The white bread dominates with a tight acerbic bite from the carbonation. Hops are very subdued and slightly spicy; I would assume they are of Noble origin. The mouthfeel is crisp, dry, carbonated and rather refreshing overall, like a premium lager should be. Overall, this beer is average. On tap it is a fairly good lager when the options are limited, but it certainly isn't a world-class lager.","estlinska","Apr 16, 2013"

I can smell hops , some malted barley but not that much , but its basically a similar smell to Heineken , you just get that European hoppy skunky smell but nothing off puting. the beer has about 2 inches of foam white head to it , very appealing golden straw colour to the beer with lots of carbonation. the taste is very smooth , it also reminds me of a nice cold heinken but less skunky , the taste is very nice and soft you can feel the carbonation the whole way through from your tounge to your throat , its basically a heineken but with a weaker bitter aftertast compared to the heineken but overall . Its a very nice beer nothing off putting about, the taste is brilliant , very drinkable. this is a perfect example of you get what you pay for in canada its around 25$ a 12 of bottles and compare it to budweiser which is around 20$ a 12. but yeah great beer i would reccomend to anyone that likes heineken and also great for christmas to.

The lacing was good too, sticking to the glass all the way down. I couldn't really smell anything but the hops - I was hoping for more, but nope, nothing. Mouthfeel was impressive, it wet my tongue without an overly obnoxious carbonation - that much I liked. It's taste wasn't anything better or worse from some other lagers I've had. In fact, I had to convince myself it didn't taste watery to me. (But just to hedge my bets - I kept it's overall rating at an average lager.)","jjamadorphd","Dec 17, 2012"

There are better out there but there are also WAY WAY WAY worse lagers. This blows American macros out of the water. What this beer lacks in character it makes up for by being easy to drink and having a pleasant flavor that could be enjoyed and even appreciated by most. This is a beer I won't buy very often, but if it was offered to me at a gathering I'd be very pleased.

The flavor is crisp and clean. Bready sweet pilsner with just enough spicy hop to try to provide some balance. Medium to light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a spicy bubbly mouthfeel. Meh. Serviceable pale lager that was my best choice at dinner, but really nothing special.","johnnnniee","Oct 20, 2012"

It brought me back to a Saturday job I had in the old Seattle Malt and Brewing basement. Any beer that smells like a brewery, and not a model airplane glue factory, or the compost bucket, can't be all bad. So on to the taste - it's got a preponderance of bitter malt, but not strong hop flavor. I feared I would be up against another harsh Belgian farmhouse ale type, but this was rather more like putting a suit on the farmhouse ale and bringing it to the big city. Unlike the normal American standard lagers, the taste does not stick around making you wish you had an Altoid, but leaves you with a pleasant gustatory memory. This drinks real nice, and makes you want to knock back another one. It takes lager beer from a duty to a pleasure.","sabinelr","May 22, 2012"

There is a mild bitterness with each sip that quickly fades. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Did not pour for a look at the head but would imagine it would be a thick or lumpy head based on the feel on the beer. The smell is very different, grassy hops and maybe a bit of corn? The taste is different, definitely not my favorite type of beer but not at all my least favorite. The mouthfeel is like beer mixed with Pop Rocks. It is difficult to explain but something that has to be tried to experience and understand, I think. The beer is carbonated but surprisingly smooth and would be a recommended beer to anyone who hasn't tried it.","Steve_O34","Mar 27, 2012"

Taste is smooth with sweet grains and little else. Really quite drinkable, particularly from a green bottle. Light body with moderately hi carb.

Malts are the base of all flavors within the brew, almost masking the offensive tastes of tobacco and herbs. To complete the flavor spectrum, a hint of hop-pop was found on the tongue.

The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat watery feel.

The taste is really not much to talk about. There's some sweet maltiness from the corn but overall, there's really nothing there. Which I take as a positive due to the smell of it. The mouthfeel is surprisingly refreshing and clean on the palate and well carbonated. I would actually venture as to say this beer is quite drinkable.

It has a slightly sweet and very quickly vanishing finish that can be pleasant. It's actually quite a good thirst quencher and probably above average for this style.

The color is a pale, drab yellow. The small white head dissipates very quickly. There's little aroma, except for a muted cheap malt note, overly sweet and more reminiscent of corn than barley, although I don't believe that adjuncts are used. The flavor is similarly dominated by a cheap, overly sweet malt flavor. There are some hops in there, I guess. The beer is not entirely without crispness when cold. Still, the feel is rather thin, even for a lager probably based on a pilsner style. Overall, I'm not a fan of Stella.

This is very clean and at this temperature has not off flavors. Quite crisp and refreshing actually, but I'll admit that when I am in need of crisp and refreshing I usually opt for water.

Yet the carbonation was far too heavy, like bold ginger ale, and I just don't like to burp that much, that fast.

Doesn't smell bad; it just doesn't smell like much of anything at all. The palate is much the same - very unchallenging, of course, but this beer is designed to be drinkable, right? Slightly sweet malt flavors are predominant and there is just enough hop backbone to keep it in balance. Finish is clean and dry with light acidity. Beer snobs love to slam this beer right along with the typical American-made light lagers, but I don't know that this is fair. While this beer is high on drinkability, and quite plain in almost every respect, it doesn't contain any of the off-flavors that characterize so many of the domestic macros.

On the palate, initial sweetness gives way to a cardboardish bitterness that's a bit unpleasant. No depth to the malt. Very bland at the finish. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation and light in body, with no distinguishing features. Overall, this is not very good.

Bottle and carriage has always been eye catching to me with the classy white. Smell is average, lots of malt and very floral. Thats where the taste comes in. Sweet and floral with no offensiveness. The perfectly crafted lager in my opinion. The sweetness is just amazing for a mass produced beer. Have one of these after a Pilsner Urquell and its heaven. The mouthfeel is slightly above average, lots of bubbles, and brings up the champagne reference again.

It looked like a standard lager, and smelled about standard but when it hit my tongue it tasted unpleasantly skunky. Keep in mind, this was on tap; otherwise, I would just have written it off as some bottles left in the sun. I let my buddy take a sip (he's a bigger beer advocate than me) and he quickly passed it back over, making note of its unpleasant flavor. Kind of like a uber-skunky Heineken, I suppose. The worst part about the flavor is that it seemed to intensify in the aftertaste. Ugh. I didn't even finish it. I had about two more beers after that and could never seem to get rid of that awful taste on my tongue. Later that night, I awoke from my sleep to rush to the toilet, (something I haven't done since having way too many mixed drinks on New Years Eve) to purge my system of the awful stuff.

Don't get me started on the sales of the urine sample labeled Bud light. That being said, fellow BAs seemed to have ripped Stella a new one(Stanley Kowalski not withstanding). I prefer porters, stouts and ales in general, but have tried to review this lager with the reference of the beer style in mind. It is very mild across the board. It has a mild hoppy finish and is very easy drinking, especially when it's hot outside. I had several while visiting my brother in Charleston SC, and it was hot as hell. I would consider this an upgrade from most macrobrewed domestics with the exception of Yuengling. Look for big beer taste elsewhere, but when a lake trip requires a better than U.S macro talk to Stella.

The beer is crystal clear and light bright straw in color. Smells pils malty with hops that have a hallertauer honey and a hint of saaz tin. Tastes flat malt with prominent hops that rise, turn earthy, and persist into the aftertaste. Malt sweet stands tall upon the draw, but falls away. By the aftertaste it's just a hint, but does contribute to a wet quality in the aftertaste that I find redeeming. Hops are earthy and tin-like, suggesting Saaz hops. Very aromatic floral. Md body (which I was surprised about) and a bit too carbonated for my preferences. Despite the green bottle, this beer was not skunked. Also, there is still a clingy layer of head on this beer that's left some pretty amazing lacing on the inside of the glass. Euro Pale Lager is not a style I'm very familiar with, but, according to the BA style description, this beer fits pretty damn well. The malt is grainy and clean of fruity esters.

Balance is okay, the off-flavor does not ruin the finish, but the drinkability is not very high either. the mouthfeel is light bodied and well-carbonated; but would be better if not for tainted flavor. Not exactly harsh; but the defect in taste prevents it from being the smooth session lager that it was intended to be.

The first sip makes me crave a sandwich on pumpernickel. And at the moment, it 'hits the spot.' Aftertaste is slightly grassy. Not very bitter, but grassy. Smooth, full bodies mouthfeel.

Nose is prototypical lager fresh and sweet, nicely malted with the start sweet and the top light to moderate in feel.

Don't expect too much from this beer and it won't disappoint you. This a pale lager, and even a belgian pale lager can only do so much. It is very drinkable (I drank untold gallons of this stuff when I lived in Belgian), but probably not worth the premium price you would pay for it in the US.

There's nothing of distinction to this beer other than smoothness and slight character to the malt bill (and its very overpriced) -- but it is pretty attractive and drinkable and less grainy than something like Harp...","ADR","Oct 03, 2003"

A pleasant smell of the stuff beer is made of: hops and malts and other stuff. A light smell, really, that is hard to peg - stronger would be better. Fills the mouth with a real sense of decent lager. For those who think lager can be good this can be a good friend. Slides down well. I like to drink it with salad (yep, its true) but it is good all by itself. It is light and refreshing but very un-Belgian really. Its a good get started beer - you know - for a masses style of beer.","PiratePete","Sep 23, 2003"

The head that was produced was thick, creamy, sticky and full in consistency and was the color of white. Decent last time then fell to a ring on the edges. The lace created was intricate and delicate. The aromas that came from the glass were of some light citrus fruits, sweet malts, hops, grains (seemed to be very prominent when there were aromas that came forth) and it was bready in the end. All aromas were light and not very pronounced. The flavors that came forth were of fruits (light pear and apple), bitter hops, light hints of alcohol, grains (husks), some sweet malt and a yeasty bread at the end. The aftertaste was light and had a hop appeal to it. Thin and watery was the body and some-what crisp on the tongue. Not what I would have expected from a Belgian beer. It was decent and drinkable. Seemed to me that it had qualities of a macro produced beer. Would I get again and drink. Sure.","Jarod","Sep 22, 2003"

It is light and easy to drink and accompanies all manner of bar food with alacrity. I've had many a Stella with many a grilled chicken sandwich with jack cheese, roasted poblano pepper, and guacamole-don't forget the side of fries and a little mayonaise for dipping. The beer is mainly about refreshing, offering ample sweet malt/biscuit flavors and a splash of hop.

Retention and lacing are excellent if not exceptional. Aroma is skunked (owing to the green bottle), but I can still detect a smidge of belgian funk...dusty and dry with a note of sour green apples, toast and peanuts. Carbonation is moderately-strong. Mouthfeel is champagne-like with a light, crisp body. Taste begins with subdued flavor hops, followed by a dry bitterness, a hint of sourness and metals, with a crisp, prolonged moderately bitter finish, more so than the draught version. The malts seem to hang in the background, never becoming as dominant as I would have liked, and the bitterness is unbalanced, making it difficult to drink as it warms. The finish starts wet and crisp and ends soft with hints of peanut butter on toast. This beer has alot of potential, but I just keep wanting alot more funk-n-malt.","Mitchster","Apr 27, 2003"

The taste was just a hint better than the smell. I did, however, taste a little bit of hops amidst the pungent flavor. Mouthfeel was dry and the finish was quite sour.

3.61,17.2,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"I'm not a big lager fan in general but there are a few that I do like to consume from time to time.  This one just got added to that list.  Not the greatest beer in the world but it is definitely very drinkable and would be very refreshing on a hot summer day.","Murph","Feb 09, 2002"
3.31,7.5,3,2,4,3.5,3.5,"Disappointing for a Belgium, strong hoppy smell.  they have been brewing it since 1366.  330ML bottle.","jdhilt","Jan 11, 2002"
2.4,-22.1,3,3,2,3,2,"Typical skunked green bottle pilsner.  I think all others (Heine, Becks, St. Paulie, you name it) are more drinkable.","pbrian","Jan 04, 2002"
3.2,3.9,3,3,3,3,4,"Not all that impressed.  I had it with Thai food and it went well, but seemed to be lacking something.  Nice balance, some citrus and light malt flavor, but nothing more.  I would not go out of my way to drink this again","AaronRed","Nov 21, 2001"
3.8,23.4,3,3,4,5,4,"Good stuff.  Not to expensive and tastes a heck of a lot better than a lot of crap some people put out.  It doesn't get any slick advertising and marketing here, but it's a much better alternative to a great many beers that do.  A very fine beer.","theman336","Oct 28, 2001"
2.81,-8.8,3,2,2.5,3.5,4,"I consumed huge amounts of this beer back and forth to Belgium on Sabena. It did me just fine ... nothing special just an other Euro lager, sadly this one is trying to ride the Belgain bandwagon and it does not even stand up to what really comes out of Belgium.","Jason","Oct 20, 2001"

3,-2.6,3,3,3,3,3,"I'm not sure what the hype is about.  This beer isn't bad, but it's not worth what you pay for it.","bk3nj","Jul 05, 2001"
3.46,12.3,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Unfortunately it seems that this beer is slowly suffering from the hand of Interbrew ... we'll see where it goes -- probably to shit.","Todd","Sep 12, 2000"
