"This is Poland's version of a pale lager, similar to Stella or Harp, etc.  It's pretty decent, and can be a nice complement to what is usually pretty heavy food.  If I'm at a Polish place, I'd get this one, and maybe try others from this brewery as well."

"Overall: Unimpressive overall but I would recommend it for a macro drinker looking for something different within that similar price range. This brew just need more character in all areas. Good for a warm day barbeque though."

"poured a dark gold color. head dissipates quickly. no carbonation visible. corn and malt aroma. the interesting thing about this beer is that I get a flavor reminiscent of sweet tea with lemon. my friends concurred. there is the slightest hint of skunk flavor, but primarily i get flavors of tea and lemon. hit me completely off guard."

"Poured from a 16oz can into a Pint glass, almost no head but a nice golden color. Aroma was of sweetness, corn and malt with a hint of alcohol. Slightly sweet taste with a skunky after bite and a mild malt finish. Mouthfeel is wet at first and then fizzed to a dry end with a suprising bit of carbonation, left flavor hints on the roof of the mouth. Overall a nice Euro Lager that had some flavor, I'm sure there are better and worse Polish Lagers to be had....and I want to try them."
"O: Although this beer is a little sweet, it's not too difficult to drink because any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste. It's not a bad beer for the style because there are no off flavors."

"500 ml can, bought at a polish shop in Arnhem. Poured into a Guinness pint glass. ABV 5,7% Golden yellow colour with one finger of soapy white head, with low retention. No lacing of course left behind, just a couple of bubbles in the body. Typical macro lager aroma, but very faint, almost non existent. Malty taste but only a bit sweet. Aftertaste is much sweeter. Very thin and watery body, minimal carbonation. Overall less than average macro lager tasting beer, very easily forgetable."

"O: just another standard macro lager. This is rather a Euro Pale lager than a MÃ¤rzen. Absolutely nothing to write home about."
"Pours a copper color, super fluffy head, low lacing glass. Light carbonation. No real smell, and light mouth feel. Tastes kinda flat cause of the lack of carbonation, yet is clean and smooth. Has a very slight bitterness at the end, preceded by a skunky, syrupy, caramel flavor. Not the worst Poland beer I have ever had, better than most"

"A very clean and easy drinking beer that would make for a refreshing picnic beverage."

"Overall - not very intriguing, but still a pretty solid and decent brew."
"Let me preface things by saying that I'm ignoring the current designation of this beer and reviewing it as a Euro pale lager (or something generally akin thereto. I'll explain later. Anyway, it pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises white bread, corn, dusty wheat, and light honey. The taste brings in more of the same, with a dull sweetness and a vague twang of booze duking it out amidst the aforementioned elements. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty meager beer in general. As a marzen/O-Fest, it's downright terrible, but as a normal Euro lager, it's just mildly sad."
"O: As usual with the Polish standards, it doesn't benefit from the slightly higher ABV. Warka is far from the worst example, though. It's still drinkable. The taste is neither good nor bad."
"Overall - very drinkable and fairly sweet."
"O - Definitely a surprise that this one isn't terrible, after all, I was expecting it to be when I bought a single of it. I suppose lower standards help. A decently drinkable polish brew."
"Flaccid feel, clean and dry aftertaste, apple and papery notes dominate. Pretty much like every Polish lager out there, very clean but one dimensional. Not much in the way of noble hops here, they may have already faded (bottle not dated). Pretty dry. Clean and easy to drink, went well with smoked alpine sausage from Gene's also."
"Pours a golden yellow color with 1 finger of head that fades to a ring with some lacing. The aroma is a mix of grainy malt and that sharp, crispness common to domestic lagers. It starts off fairly bland and sweet, with just some light bitterness on the back end. The finish is fast and clean with just a hint of corn sweetness. The body is slightly fuller than a typical macro lager and the drinkability is on par with macros. This is a decent lager, but I would hardly call it a Marzen."
"Notes: Well I was not expecting a Fest beer when I picked this one up but there it is. I was thinking it was going to be more of a Czech Pilsener or a Euro Lager but it is well in keeping with a good old German Fest beer."
"D-Okay at best. Nice balance. Good in a pinch and certainly thirst quenching. Marzen?"
"This is the latest addition the unusually wide range of Polish lagers at my local off-licence, and one of the most attractive so far. But it's still not going to win any beauty pageants, not with its generic golden body and completely average white head. The nose is noticeably and aggressively alcoholic, smelling kind of like a can of cheap cider, without much nuance to speak of save a hint of sulfur and a touch of glue. The flavor is sweet and a bit thick, so if this style classification is to be trusted, then it's pretty much spot on, but that's the best that can be said for it. It tastes like some kind of lemony beer and rum concoction, and that's how it drinks. Not terrible, but far from recommendable."
"Regardless, solid malts and enough hops - better than most out of Poland."
"My pour resulted in two fingers' worth of thick, foamy bone- white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a very Saaz hop/Pilsner bite to it. I am curious as to its being an O-fest. Mouthfeel was slightly watery with a lager-like sweetness on the tongue. I really CANnot believe that this is an O-fest and I have sent the company an E-mail for clarification. Finish was mild, unobtrusive, definitely some sort of Lager, maybe an O-fest, maybe not. Drinkable? Sure. Cooler worthy? Yes, but not worth seeking out. It would be a nice, simple beer to have with a nice, simple Polish meal, no question."
"I thought it more of a Euro Pale Lager than a Marzen/O-fest, but I suppose the sweetness puts it into the latter... Anyway, it's a rather bland, sweet, though ""drinkable"" brew."
"Pours a dark amber body wqith tons of carbonation and a huge off white head. Aromas are caramel, malt, bread, and some hops. Taste is sweet malts, caramel, some hops, molasses. Smooth and creamy. Very dangerous considering it is 7%. Not my favourite ES, but all in all, well made, and given the high ABV, a well made brew."
"Recieved a six-pack for my birthday. Immediately after pour, smells like angelfood cake. Didn't expect that. Head disipated quickly. No trace of lace and the carbonation left quickly. Taste is sweet and syrupy, with caramel and some kind of fruit, like raisins? Alcohol was prominent to me. Never had anything like this one. Glad I tried it. Don't think I'd buy it."
"D - Just this morning I was brewing up a batch of pale ale homebrew, and I happened to sample the malt extract raw after I got all I could out of the can, and this tastes a lot like that raw malty sweet and bran-y flavor. I opened this brew expecting some sort of Polish version of a Euro-Lager and instead I was amazed to be treated to one of the best Oktoberfests I've ever had, and that's saying a lot since I've had quite a few and it's one of my favorite styles! An outstanding O-Fest ... from Poland! Who would've thunk?"
"11.2oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark golden orange color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly disappears. The aroma is dominated by slightly toasted malts, some caramel and a hint of toffee. The taste much like the aroma is mostly malt with some caramel and a barely noticeable hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and under-carbonated for my liking. Overall, I will likely pass on purchasing this beer again."
"It tastes like a light nut-brown ale. It has decent quality, but it really doesn't do anything special. When you finish it, it's like, ok that was good, what's next."
"Sweetness may be bothersome to some drinkers. It's almost sickly sweet."
"I was expecting a standard Euro-lager when purchasing this brew, but I knew my Polish friends would not steer me wrong. I would eventually like to try the Strong variation of this beer, but I may have to make a trip to Poland in order to do that (which is fine with me :-). An easy drinking beer, and a good one to relax with."
"Rich mouth feel medium body on this lasger...drinkable and satisfying...one pf the best Polish lagers on par with Okocim."
"Poured nice into the glass with a nice white head. the color was a amber color with the smell being sweet. The mouthfeel was not clean but that of a light syrup texture. The alcohol content was 7 percent but the alcohol wasn't present in the taste.The beer was lacking character along with taste. Overall I was disappointed"
"Surprisingly good drinkability from a beer from an iffy country. Nearly in the same class as the best of the style from Germany, this is a beer I can recommend."
"Drinkability was OK... I could have another if I wanted to, but I wouldn't be terribly drawn to it unless the only other thing available was macro-swill."
"Taste is pretty sweet, very malty, malt is quite present, woth shy hoppy flavours which rounds up a floral bouquet. Very watery and smooth, there was some presense ethyl in the end."
"Warka Beer pours a dark amber. The smell is decent, no unpleasant notes. Mostly malt and maybe just a touch of hops. The taste is dominated by malt, not much hops. Nothing special, but not bad either, definitely drinkable. I'm not sure I'd pick one up again, but I could see someone else liking it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" off-white head above the clear light golden brew. Frothy head lasts and lasts, with lots of lacing. Aroma is light, relatively balanced, with spicy hops tipping the scales a bit. Taste is sweet pale grains, with a crisp Saaz-ish hoppiness. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is nice as well. Not bad, esp for the travelling this can has done."
"Beautiful gold hue, almost no head. Smells sweet, malty. Has a good taste, sweet, malty with a nice roast at the end. Tastes very much to the Oktoberfest style. Mouthfeel is good, just the right amount of carbonation. This is a great beer, very drinkable and perfect with a nice dessert."
"dark gold in color with a white head that fizzes itself out quickly. malty aroma with caamel, vanilla, and a light fruitiness. honey aromas make a showing as it warms. slight astringency and hints of an almost maple syrup aroma also show up. very sweet with candy like flavors that mirror the aroma minus the astringency. apple like fruitiness combines with the caramel to create a very pleasing caramel apple taste (obviously). lighter medium body with average carbonation. good drinkability, while very sweet, it is not overwhelming at all. worth a try if you can get your hands on it. i gotta admit, i was pleasantly surprised with my first polish beer."
"This is a very good euro lager, definitely the best Polish beer Ive tried yet. Id get this again."
"This beer has a couple of nice touches, but is just too sweet to be really enjoyable. Not enough balance, too watery."
"Malty nose, smells somewhat like a golden graham cereal. Almost tastes like a graham cracker sort of a lightly sweet, syrupy, and grainy flavor. The deep straw gold color with a steady stream of carbonation throughout begs to say ""drink me'. Not quite enough hops for me, but has the sticky sweet finish and nice mouthfeel most real beer drinkers talk about. Perfectly drinkable, and, surprisingly to me, a dangerously enjoyable beer."
"I don't know if I would classify this beer as a Marzen/Octoberfest. It is clearly a pilsner. Pours out to a bright yellow in the glass with a very active carbonation and a nice, fluffly white head. The aroma is that of hay/freshly cut grass. The taste is superb for a ""fizzy, yellow beer"". There are hints of caramel and honey with a nice, little hop bite on the finish. Incredibly drinkable. I don't think I've rated a pils this high before."
"Apples and caramel in the start of the taste. There is a solid grainy kick just before the aftertaste, which is dry and bready. If it weren't for the apple taste overpowering the grains, this one would be a much better brew than it is. It is easy to drink, and the carbonation is at the right level."
"It's been awhile since i've had beer from a can and i wasn't expecting much but i was pleasantly surprised. The crystal clear straw yellow color was covered by a fluffy white head that faded slowly leaving a thin white film on top. A faint odor of cardboard is there but very little aroma overall.This brew is lacking in the taste department, i would say it's like a thin vienna lager at best. By not being over carbonated i could drink many of these with a couple kelly dogs on a hot summer day."
"Beer pours a quite deep gold to almost copper color with a pertinent white head that is frothy in texture, and the lace a nice thick sheet to seal the glass. Nose is dominated by malt, somewhat crisp and fresh, a bit musty and the start a bit too sweet, the top thin. Finish is strong in its carbonation, with the hops adequate and the aftertaste dry and lingering, drinkable, but not something that ÂLit my beer fireÂ."
"A dark offering, almost amber in colour with a taste of fruitiness and almonds and a little thin. This is a full bodied brew with a minor lace as its crowning glory or lack of. Does nothing for me...but I am glad I met it..."
"Can version. Poured a nice amber color with a thick beige head. Malt and caramel aroma. Sweet malt flavor but kind of thin for a Vienna. Granted, GL's Eliot Ness has ruined me as far as other Vienna's go. It is nice to know that people had a beer this good 500 years ago."
"Warka Beer: From Poland, in a half liter can. Deep amber color, with a thick rocky white head.  They claim that this beer has been around since before Columbus sailed.  I was fully expecting a skunked out euro-lager, but instead found a slightly thin Vienna style lager.  Very, very sweet, with dominant malt tastes, almost honey like.  A simple hop presence at the end does what it can to balance out the sweetness.  Nevertheless, this was a surprisingly good beer, particularly for $1.29 a can."
