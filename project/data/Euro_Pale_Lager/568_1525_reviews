"Top 5 beers in my opinion"
""
"500ml bottle. BB 29-04-15. Pours a very pale gold colour with a dense white head which disappeared quickly and left minimal lacing. Metallic aroma with some corn and malt. Slight malty sweetness with mild, spicy hop bitterness. Some alcoholic warmth and the finish is quite dry but has an almost salty, mineral quality to it."
""
"Great European Lager! Almost perfectly balanced. Nice and hoppy. Very crisp and refreshing I would definitely get this again!"

"O.K. Beer from Browar Okocim S.A. with an ABV of 5.6%. This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. The smell is sweet with grains and malt. Nothing bad so far. The taste is sweet, but this brew has a smooth finish. You pick up on some grains in the taste of this brew. To me this brew is like an American Lager. Mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is no bad aftertaste.. Browar Okocim S.A. did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. This brew was better than what I was expecting. I would buy this brew again."

"Overall a tasty Euro lager. Better than most."

"O: Easy drinking basic lager."

"Overall: This is definitely more then o.k. beer. A lager that hits all the traditional points it should while having some pleasant hop tones which take it to the next level. And for $5 a 4pk, this one is going to be a staple in my fridge for a long time."
"I poured this into a glass, it has a golden color body with a very small head that fades to a thin lace around the edge of the glass. The smell has a sweetness to it and also a little malt and corn. The taste is sweet and has a grainy flavor to it. The malt is kinda there. The mouthfeel is smooth and is very drinkable."

"This reminds me of a much better version of Stella Artois. Large noticeable malt presence, but if the sweetness was dialed down a bit this would be real impressive."
"O: This is much better than the last Poland beer I tasted. O.K. Beer is arguably the best Euro Pale Lager I've come across. While not a particularly exciting style, it's good to know that there are examples of it that taste good."

"O: Of all the Polish macros on the market, this is easily the best. It's a simple lager, but it offers a pleasantly straightforward drinking experience with more flavor and character than the others can offer. A perfect pairing for Polish cuisine. It can stand up to any sausage, and has the power to cut through more fatty and flavorful dishes."
"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting lager - earthy overall is a good way I would describe this beer, but definitely something that works in large servings. A 500mL bottle is a good serving size for this beer. Nothing so strong in flavor that you tire of it, but at a weakness in flavor that you need a whole bottle to really get to know it. Then again, I suspect a beer like this has been crafted solely to drink in large quantities with food. I did not have this with food, but I can see that it would go really well with a wide range of meat & potato dishes, probably some heartier vegetable dishes as well. So nicely drinkable, but overall nothing amazing. Nice looking color though. Strangely, like the bottle says, it's an OK beer."
""
" Not bad, not exactly good, pretty much standard for the style, which has it's place, but just not interesting enough to bother buying again."

"Overall: For my introduction into Polish brew I can't say I'm flabbergasted and about to shout it on the mountain top but this lager is genuine. I feel I'm starting to fall in love with most Euro lagers for their affinity for being clean and straightforward. That der brew dis Oky Doky wit me brew"

"Clear yellow beer with little head.  Smell is weak...maybe malty floral scent, but hard to tell.  Taste is clear, crisp with malty tones.  Clean mouthfeel with little aftertaste.  Refreshing beer, moderately bubbly.  Pretty tasty beer, I would buy more."
"O: this was a very pleasant surprise, and very high on the drinkability dimension."
"This beer was one of the cheaper offerings at the Hennessey Market in Uptown Butte, Montana (6.99 for a four pack of pint cans, which is equivalent to craft brew on sale or clearance in this town). At this price it is well worth the money and well worth the try."

"Overall: Not an expert in this style, but this is a good beer on hot humid day like today."

"Okay. This stuff pours a clear brass-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises old wheat and light dry grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of odd fruitiness and an aftertaste laden with the dust of many unkempt attic rooms. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty weak and odd-tasting beer, one I couldn't easily say ""Okay"" to any time soon."
"Much like the Baltika brew I had the other night, skunky aromas fill my senses as soon as I pop the top on this bottle. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a decent sized white head that dissipates quickly to a cap. After airing out a bit the skunk is still in the room, but maybe my nose is used to the smell a bit because I can find some bready pils and a hint of flowers. The flavor is a bit better than the aroma advertised. Nice sweet bready malt presence with a hint of graininess. There's a firm spicy hop bit that provides a great balance to the malty sweetness. Carbonic acid is a bit high and does detract a bit. Medium body with a sweet bubbly mouthfeel and a moderate level of carbonation. Not a bad brew after it airs out a bit."

"O: This beer is a simple-flavored pale lager that is very easy to drink."

"on tap at the new world of beers on Colorado boulevard. from Poland I reckon, this beer pours a really light pale straw color with a big and full white head with O.K. retention (pun intended). generic nose of spent crystal malt and everyday yeast. there is a light lemony flavor up front, but after that this is your classic eastern European wash, not poorly made, just terribly uninteresting. its plenty sessionable though, with a really light body and a relatively excited mouthfeel. a curious beer to import, since its like so many that are made here at home, but I guess variety is the spice of life, even if there isn't much spice happening in this brew. my Molson drinking old man would like it, but it didn't strike a chord with me, it was just O.K. (fine I will stop now)."

"I'm more of an IPA type, but also a Saas hops pilsner fan - not much better than a cold Urquell on a hot day. Also, shamelessly, a Heineken fan - as far as go-to refreshing daily drinkers go. This O.K. Beer/Okocim is a worthy addition to the aforementioned brews when in the mood for a crisp lager/pilsner with a bit of a bite-y overtone. I like a li'l skunk in my junk. Plus, you can bash someone over the head with the heavy, eastern european-style bottle, if the occasion arises. O.K. indeed!"

"O: Overall, the title holds true, its an OK beer, I'd say its in the slightly above average beer, it's very tolerable, not offensive or overbearing, but its not something I would call outstanding. It's pretty decent so it's worth a go."
""
"O - A plain lager, neither here nor there"

"Overall - It's an adjunct lager with a Polish Label on it. I'm sure that are excellent beers from Poland, but this isn't one of them."
"O: This is a solid example of lager. It's a step or two up from a Bud of Bug Light, that's for sure. It's nothing spectacular, but what can you really expect from the style. It's drinkable and enjoyable... if you're in the mood."

"Pours like apple juice with carbonation with a bright white head forming and fleeting quickly. Aroma has cooked cereal grains flowing with a slight metallic character, and herbal hop aromatics. This is Euro pale lager, with a definite bite to it, a bit harsh. Flavor grows on you with a sweet husky grain character minimal hop flavor, a bit one dimensional in the Euro lager department. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying with some residual sugars, carbonation a bit rough uneven flowing beer across the palate. Drinkability isn't what I have in mind for a relaxing Friday night beer drinking experience."
""
"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on March 24, 2012. The pour is the ideal golden yellow for a pale beer with constant upwardly flowing delicate carbonation bubbles and a lingering white head. The aroma is bready with the yeast strain they must use along with a mild hop character in the background. The body is light to medium. The taste has an astringent bitterness attached to it along with the bready malts and clean hopped finale. This is a good lawn mower beer."

"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear golden color with one finger of white head. The retention was good as a cap at first but it soon became a thin collar. The lacing was spotty. The aroma was of cereal grains and sweet malt. The flavors were very standard in my opinion. I tasted the cereal grains and sweet malt but also a bit of European hops that gave it as clean finish. The Euro Pale Lager style tends to be very bland and this was a good example of what can be done with it but I still had trouble being impressed with such a beer. Still, it is to be said the mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation spot-on. It was indeed ok."
"Poured from the bottle into a pils glass. Very light body; almost see through. Some nice carbonation and a tiny wispy white head. It's just so watery looking. Smell was grainy and grassy. Taste was average, since it didn't have any skunky flavors I was expecting. It tasted fairly fresh. Mouthfeel was pretty limp and boring. Slightly bitter aftertaste on the back of the throat. This beer didn't turn me off, so I drank it effortlessly. Probably halfway decent on tap in Poland, but out of the bottle, it was barely OK."
"Overall: OK price is a important factors for me in judging a beer. There are some inexpensive beers that really measure up. This six pack was $7.99 around the price of Heineken, St. Pauli and other imported beers. For the price is nothing to write home about. In fact I am a little disappointed. There are better beers for around $5.99. The after taste is pretty good I can see how some people would be turned on by this beer."
"I'd rather drink sewer water. Honestly."
""
""
""
"Notes: Balanced, with a very soft mouthfeel. A tad too much body for the style, but still quite easy to put back. Not a bad beer by any means. It has its flaws, yet it excels in the style."
""
"O-this is like a slightly (very slightly) better version of an american light beer. its a lot more balanced and smooth than other euro pale lagers that i've had. the higher alcohol seems to be completely hidden. overall, its a very boring beer that i won't be needing to get again unless my only other choice is an american adjunct"
"Pours a clear yellow with a 2 inch foamy white head that fades to a think film on the top of the beer. Broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of fresh grains, grass/hay notes, and some sweetness. Taste is of grains, grass, and some sweet honey-like flavors on the finish. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel on this one. Overall, this is a pretty good lager out of Poland. I need to seek out the Baltic porter from this brewery as well."
"My can states that the ABV is 5.6%? The desciption above says 6.2%. Perhaps they lightened up the beer a little to make it more drinkable?"
"Certainly the last time I have this one, but I’m oddly not upset about this one. The fact that it is about 2 bucks a bottle doesn’t hurt."
"Overall? This is my new go-to lager beer, I'm cleaning out BevMo's shelves of this stuff the next time I go back. At just over a dollar a pint, this is the best random buy I've ever made."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised with this one."
"Pouring the can into a pint glass creates a decent-sized head which dissolves in less than 30 seconds. Smells very sweet and fruity, almost like a watery cider. Tastes pretty sweet also, like fruit and bread. There is some slight bitterness as well. O.K. Beer is more than okay."
"Well what can one say about a typical European tasting beer that hasn't already been said...this beer pours a clear pale yellow with white head and ok lacing. The smell is grainy/wheaty and surprise surprise....so is the taste. This beer is boosted by 6.2% ABV which makes its drinkability and mouthfeel not as nice a more subtle Euro beer like Pils Urquel or its bretherin Okocim premium. Not tasty enough to risk a big hang-over during a session....but some make enjoy!"
"A mighty fine lager, props to my friends and possible ancestors in Poland for this one! This is definitely an ""OK Beer", perfect for a hot summer and might even compete with my favorite lager - Weihenstephaner."
"Overall, it's an interesting beer that calls for a simple, Eastern European dish to accompany it - bigos, rye bread with bacon and onion, smoked kielbasa with potatoes and sauerkraut, etc. It drinks well and is different from more well-known Czech and German lagers."
"D: Enjoyable throughout, can't taste the alcohol at all, wife enjoyed it as well."
"Pretty easy drinking. Definitely bland, but not really offensive at any point. I probably would mistake this for a decent American macro. I guess you could call this beer... O.K."
"Drinkablility is pretty good. It's easy to drink and refreshing. Would be a good choice on a warm summer day."
"This beauty pours a golden and translucent, lot of carbonation and a white lacey head. The aroma is of hops and and sweet malts nothing complex. Great taste, I was not expecting much from this beer but this beer is crisp giving some nice malty flavors off the front and sharp hops at the end. This beer is light but not watery, and the flavor lingers and is not overpowering. Great brew."
"500 ml can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is all bready and sweet malt. With that being said, for the style it's not a bad smelling beer at all. The taste is the same as the aroma, it's all bready and sweet malt. It's not too sweet, and there aren't any offensive aromas or flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light, but it's not watery. Moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough, it's smooth and goes down easy. I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. For $1.09 a can, I think it's a good deal. For the style of beer this is, I thought it was pretty decent."
"D: This is a nice session lager, and a nice imported choice. Nothing crazy going on but could fall back to this one."
"Simple yeast finish. Not a whole lot here. Not particularly pleasant."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, some malts. Taste is good, malts and grains, a bit of sweetness.A fine beer on a hot evening. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overalll a good quality lager."
"I never appreciated the auditory aspect of The CANQuest (TM) as much as I do today, following a (mostly) ten-day hiatus. Crack and Glug, indeed! My two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head began falling almost immediately, but in exchange, it left some nice lacing. Color was a deep-golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. ""Pale", my butt! Comparatively, historically, sure, but for the style - negits. Nose was pure, unadulterated lager. A slight, malt-driven sweetness led the way, but there were also Noble hops as the back-up. Mouthfeel was thin-to medium and I got a slight metallic tang on the tongue along with the initial wash of malty sweetness. Oh well. Finish was more tangy with the hops accompanied by a metallic taste. I CAN live without that aspect of some lagers."
"I would drunk this instead of water, and I can't say that of many lagers. It was OK."
"Still, overall a nice beer."
" D- The only real flavor is the buttered corn qualities which are a bit to much but the slight sweetness adds some nice depth to the grain hints."
"Overall: Overall the beer was average. I'm not a huge fan of Pale lagers, but it's decent for its style."
"Clear golden color with a large head that slowly settled to a thick cap. Just a little lacing is left behind. Smells almost like an ale. Fruity and bready. Nothing too surprising in the flavor. Has that Eastern European lager taste. Also slightly sweeter than pale lagers. Has some interesting fruit notes of apricots and peaches. Substantial body for a pale lager. A little slick. I found this better than OK. One of the more interesting lagers that come out of that part of the world or almost anything else in Carlsberg's portfolio."
"O.K. Beer, that about sums it up. The beer pours as clear as the morning with a cap of quickly dissipating foam. Doesn't look to bad, really. The aroma comes off sweet, bready and perhaps a hint of corn. On palate, however, it starts light, just the right amount of sweetness, and ends with a snap of bitterness. Sweetness lingers on the palate a bit too long, though. Like I said, an OK beer."
"D- A decent beer that drinks better on the colder side. A bit too sweet."
"D- not the worst beer ive had, but far from the best. something i dont think i will seek out again."
"D- The drinkability on this one is god awful. I remember almost liking this one when I was a little younger but now I just don't know. I had a hard time drinking this one and ended up drain pouring the last quater of my pint."
"Good beer. Metallic (copper) flavors are noticeable but not overpowering. Smell: nothing special. A nice grainy, crunchy mouthfeel, crisp carbonation and flavors of light, hoppy citrus balanced by an equal background of malt. An interesting beer and hard to categorize. It is amazing this stuff can be had for $1 for a bottle or can. Great value for your money with this brew. High alcohol vs. others in this style, but again this beer has it's own personality. Could be a guzzler because it goes down easy, but the high ABV will creep up on you. Not delicious but very good."
"D - Very drinkable. I am surprised at the simple quality of this brew."
"D: average lager, not bad, but not special."
"D: This one is what it is - a middle of of the road Euro Pale Lager. Clean, crisp and dry, without a lot of character, it is not overly exciting, but it is easy to drink."
"D: Like the name says, O.K. Drink ability from an O.K. Beer."
"Damn drinkable! Super slammin' good stuff! Okocim and Poland can be proud of this yummy, nearly perfect lager!"
"Went down smooth and is quite drinkable; overall a decent beer, but nothing special taste-wise and like the name itself, it's ""O.K.""."
" mouth feel is smooth. I could drink this all night. beer is almost always better on tap and i think that some of the issues other had with this we're noticeable for me. a great refreshing, crisp, pale lager."
"drinkability is ok would prefer some more flavor up front but a decent beer lawnmower brew"
"Drinkability is good. O.K. Beer is a very refreshing pale that definitely quenches thirst. There is a good balance on a lot of the taste, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"D- The definition of drinkable/session-able, and while it is not that interesting, it is simultaneously entirely inoffensive in every way. I could kill multiple bottles in a sitting easily."
"I had 3 dollars left after I bought the rest of my beer and tried this one. It pours and looks exactly like a bud or miller. The taste was rather skunky and had an unpleasant after taste to it. It reminded me of the taste of steel reserve. Although it is nice to try new things, this is not a quality beer. Overall I found it to be a terrible beer."
"Pale gold and crystal clear with a nice fizzy head and minimal lace. Smells nice and hoppy, citric with toasted grain. Tastes good, fairly nice hop bite balances well with malt sweetness. Seltzery carbonation and light bodied. Finishes squeaky clean. A good example of the style and stronger than most."
"Taste is pretty light, more so than the nose indicates. Extremely smooth flavor profile, but my bottle is starting to show signs of oxidation and the hops don't taste as fresh as they could. Hop bitterness is pretty low and really creates an unbalanced taste, leaning toward very pale sweet malts. Does not have much specialty grain flavor. It's ok, and has the potential to taste pretty good fresh, but pretty average euro for me."
"pale golden straw with a decent pure white head and perfectly clear. the rest is like any macro lager but with a little more in each area. i'm not sensing adjuncts in this. minimal nose of grassy continental hops and biscuity pale malts. taste follows suit with a pretty even balance. feels lighter-bodied than the abv would suggest. i would think that there could be more character for a 6.2% beer. it is just O.K. O-kaaay!!!"
"Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a Pilsner-esque beer."
"D - A very drinkable lager. Happy that I tried it."
"Drinkability is very good. I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in European pale ales or just something completely different in general. Top notch stuff!"
"Drinkability- High on my list because of family heritage. Overall a nice experience to share with other family members. Probably not for everyone."
"What I like about this beer is that is smells like mustard, nice brown spicy mustard but behind that lies a fresh bready and nutty sweetness, I sear this smells like a piece of whole wheat bread with nice thick spread of spicy mustard on it, already I am thinking about how well this would pair with a corned beer sammich. Taste is again crisp, grassy but really more of a bright and slightly sweet beer. I really wish the spiciness of the nose remained in the taste but instead it becomes a bit washed out and muted in the sweeter, maltier aspects of this beer, I mean its there but I almost wish it were overstated. I know, I know it's totally American of my to say that but damn it I'm an American, a proud American! To steal from the Simpsons: I like my beer cold, my T.V. loud and my homosexuals, FLAMING! and so it goes with this beer, and like many current episodes and like the beer itself says on the bottle, it's just O.K."
"I got this from a variety sample pack from World Market. From the label I honestly was not expecting much from this beer. But, I guess the Poles know how to do it right. This is a very good Pale Lager. Very crisp and refreshing. This was very good and I would certainly drink this again if it were easily available."
"Overall a good beer not a bad pilsner. I rather enjoyed drinking this. I thin Pilsners are one of my favorite styles."
"Probably popular in the area it's brewed in, but this one isn't impressing me. More light husky grains and not much else."
"One of my father's Polish friends from work brought home a 6'er of this. The European Saaz hops are clearly present and make this a nice drinkable, light beer. A pretty high ABV for the style but it's very smooth and undetectable. I haven't tried too many imports but this one makes me want to try a lot more."
"This one isn't bad - nothing to seek out in the States but probably a decent option to remember when in Eastern Europe. Decently drinkable."
"The beer is a nice golden transparent lager with little head, but sparkling carbonation. The nose is slightly malty, but the real maltiness of this brew bursts all over your palate with the first good mouthfull. A very smooth finish with mild bitterness and more malt at the end, coupled with a perfect texture in the mouth make this a great beer for summer drinking. A bit high in alcohol for a session beer, but if the weekend afternoon is long and hot, and you've got a good place to sit while you watch the beautiful Polish people walk by, well why not make a 2-liter session out of it, even if you feel a bit light at the end."
"not great, simple, and delightful. a good brew as a conventional lager."
"Turns out it wasn't too bad - it's light and easy to drink - but it doesn't have any real distinct aspect about that I could categorize."
"Overall: I won't remember drinking this beer in 5 minutes. Utterly forgettable. I suspect (like others that have negatively reviewed this beer) that I got a skunked/old bottle. I need ""zero"" ratings for this beer because it didn't even rate a 1.0 in any of the categories."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some hops, spices. The taste is sweet, malty, hoppy, some spices. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad, thanks Joe."
"Man, this is one of those straightforward, delicious lagers."
"Recommended..."
"Given the other reviews, I can only assume that I had a very bad, very skunked sample. The lesson to readers: make sure your bottle is reasonably fresh before you begin your tasting."
"Pours a clear gold with a one finger white head with great retention and lots of little bubbles rising in the glass. Sweet orange citrus aromas with some tea and fresh cut grass. Toasted malt flavor up front with light tea/lemon hop mixed in and some bright citrus. Medium carbonation and body, starts with a creamy mouthfeel that becomes cleansing. Easy drinking beer unlike anything else I've tried and very moderately priced."
"This beer is more than O.K., it is delicious."
"Poured a very clear pale-gold color with a thick frothy white head. The head retention is very good. The lacing is light but nice. The aroma is kind of grainy and lightly hoppy. There is a slight metal flavor to it. The is a slight butterscotch flavor also which is cool. Very clean, sweet and malty. The hop flavor is light but nice. This tastes great, especially considering its at 6.2 percent abv. The feel is smooth and barely tingly from the light carbonation. No skunk, no harshness. Nice."
"D: I am disappointed, this isn't even a very good pilsener. Probably wouldn't pick this one up again."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, but to expensive for what it is."
"Pours clear yellow-gold with a thin head that vanishes almost instantly. Aroma is grassy with a bit of 'skunk' to it. Taste is grassy with faint malts. There's a faint hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite effervescent. Easy to drink, but not much there to create any excitement."
"MK"
"D-its a decent beer and i might consider a six pack of this. Nothing to extraordinary though."
"""Full pale"" that is a bit light in color with a creamy head, not macro like though; from a vigorous pour, the head holds. ARoma is hgently hoppy but mostly sweet pale malts. Taste is like an unhoppy pils, very much like harp; good flavor but tamer than heineken, say. Sweeter, less hoppy, Also, while ithis doesn't taste ""old"" it's missing that fresh taste that I'm used to from more local brews and careful date checking. Mouthfeel is carbonated, medium bodied for a pale lager. Overall its truly O.K. beer. I prefer a pils, which this is not and was hoping for a score for my fridge here but it was a miss. A likable beer in it's own right, but not even close to balanced or fresh enough for me, will recommend this to less picky drinkers that might prefer a tame but taste pale lager in a big bottle (or 12er) for a fair price."
"The color is a lovely gold with a uniform centimeter thick head. The head dissipates quickly. Carbonation is active but not excessive. A pretty beer in the American pint glass. Smell is surprising clean but also quite light. Just a hint of malt, but no skunkiness. Solid malty flavor, far more than I expected for this style. No fizzy offputting weakness. Mouthfeel is alright. The finish is sweet and crisp. A very enjoyable beer that is exceedingly drinkable. I will seek this out for a warmer weather easy drinker."
"Poured from bottle into hefe glass. Pours light golden, crystal clear, and a nice thick, fluffy head. Somewhat poor retention and lacing. Smell is of some malt, grass, and ""skunk."" Taste is heavy on the malt, some grassy/straw-like tastes as well with some light bread tastes. Somewhat bitter aftertaste. Overall nice and crisp, light mouthfeel, I have a feeling this would be great on a nice summer day. While its not a great beer its better than a Heine or Becks and was an easy drinker. I should note that my bottle lists the ABV as 5.6%. I checked the other beers from this brewer and this is definitly the same one, the labels are identitical, but the ABV is apparently different."
"This beer poured a golden color with a lingering two-finger head. It has malty aroma with a little hint of something early like grass or straw. The taste is a mix of malts and hops with a surprising amount of alcohol feel that tends to linger on the palate. It's a fairly crisp tasting beer that isn't unpleasant to drink. The label says it all, this beer is simply ""O.K.""."
"i think this is my first polish beer, how exciting. anyway pours a light golden color with hardly any head whatsoever, looks very macro-ish, but smells quite skunky, taste is surprisingly smooth, has a skunkiess to the taste, it is a decent lager all around better than a BMC from what i can tell, but i'm not much of a lager fan."
"Overall, this is a nice pale ale, one that won't knock the socks off but one you shouldn't turn down. Not in my top five pale ales, but a pretty good beer."
"Perhaps this is the best of the lawn-mower beers."
"I wouldn't seek out this beer again, but it was interesting to try. I'd say it would be an easy drinker but there are many other beers of this type which are much better."
"While I'm not a fan of their stronger Mocne, this ""diluted"" offering hit the spot. Beware, the alcohol is a little heavy to make it a session brew."
"500ml bottle. Appearance is not very appetizing, pale,shallow yellow, almost no head at all, just urine like bubbles. Aroma however is a big improvement, lightly hoppy but fresh, like hay, pale sweet malts underneath. Low carbonation, slightly grassy, semi-sweet malts, long low bitter finish. I liked this on the palate, the low carbonation made for a smooth mouthfeel. Which I like in a beer. Over all a nice enough lager, and pretty drinkable."
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. Extremely easy to drink but gives nothing up in flavor. Looks like this beer is now owned by Carlsberg?"
"D: A good Euro pale lager, one of the best from Continental Europe that I have had, refreshing on a hot summer's day, especially after manual labour, the Porter is this brewery's masterpiece, but this lager ain't too shabby, as they say. If you're looking for a cheap, inexpensive beer with flavour, try this."
"The abv is there and you can tell.It was a good beer but nothing I would buy,the sweetness just got to me.It didnt have that skunky taste either that I incorparate with euro lagers."
"Overall: A good brew, intresting pale lager. To me it was fairly well balanced unlike many Euro pale's. I would drink this over beck's hein, ect any day. Give it a try."
"Overall: Another ho-hum Euro lager. The name says it allOK."
"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a pint glass. The pale straw body is topped by a sizeable creamy white head that dissipates almost immediately. Ample carbonation keeps the bubbles coming. Pleasant aroma of slightly sweet carapils and adjunct malts, with a nice biscuity character. Palate is nice, light, and well-balanced. A sweet malt character up front melds with a decent dose of European hops to provide some bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and a bit creamy, very enjoyable. Not particularly groundbreaking, but a well-constructed eastern European lager."
"Not too drinkable to my tastes due to an unpleasant aftertaste and too strong in ABV to be a summer cooler."
"poured a light golden, high carbonation, small head. Smell of slight light hop, not too aromatic. Tasted metallic and small bitter. too much fizz for this kid, however smooth and a light-medium bodied. It was worth the try, good pilsner representation."
"Bottom line: try Okocim's Porter...it's IMHO the best beer ever brewed."
"This is a very enjoyable beer. A big malty backbone starts out the front, giving it a smooth, sweet taste without becoming overpowering. There's a pleasant hop profile here that is a bit out of the ordinary, but I enjoyed it. You never experience a grain/corn quality to the taste, and it's not skunky at all (unlike many light Euro beers). The finish is smooth, clean, and has a pleasant aftertaste. To be honest this is a fantastic session beer that I'd love to find more of. Certainly the best Euro pale lager I've had to date, and a great alternative to the macro Euros."
"This one was looking intresting for a try, and my first beer from Poland! Poured a golden pale yellow, no head, no lace, but a nice visible stream of carbonation, classic euro lager look. Smell was very light, corn, grain, bread, sort of a musky smell, again pretty run of the mill for the style. The taste was crisp, and clean, classic lager, grainy malted taste, slight hint at the european hops. Very smooth and a classic session beer. Overall it was ok(lol). I could easily put down several of these on a hot day. Nothing terribly spectacular, but definatly not bad."
"I'd definitely buy this again for an afternoon of watching sports/tailgaiting or for watching a movie at home with friends."
"For the style, this one is pretty good. While the typical EPL sweetness is there, there is an above-average hoppiness and spiciness that makes this one stand out. OK Beer is more than OK."
"A decent pale Euro lager. I'm guessing its probably better fresh in Europe, but my bottle was alright. The hops seemed a bit skunked, but at least there were hops. With the style, it was light with a fruity flavor from the yeast. Add a touch of hops and a little grain. An easy drinking beer, but nothing amazing."
"Bottle smell is malty sweet for a lager. Pours to a honey bronze color with a good head that quickly disappears. Taste is full palate a strong malty taste with slight bitter hop taste detectable throughout. A classic lager finish. Surprisingly high AC, not at all detectable. A well brewed beer. Good balance of tastes. Very drinkable. I think I'll have another."
"In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine 12oz OK beer, 1 1/2 cups water, 2 cups chopped yellow onions and 2lbs kielbasa. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 25 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and cool. Slice the sausage into 1 -inch pieces. In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt 2 tblspn butter. Stir in 2 tblspn flour and cook for 4 to 6 minutes for a light brown roux. Stir in 2 tblspn white vinegar, 1 tblspn sugar and the reserved beer and onion mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and continue to cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Add the sliced kielbasa and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley."
"(330 ml / 11.2 oz. light brown bottle with 'Okocim' embossed around the neck 4 times)"
"Malty delight, really not bad for this basic style. A bit of fast fading head on top of clear yellowish liquid, and some mix of malt in there, even a tad floral. Easy drinking. I would have again, decent brewery based on what I have had. Would drink again in a pinch."
"Part of my beer of the month club delivery, this beer is in a brown bottle with a really cute label with some eastern european artwork on it. And surprisingly, O.K. Beer is more than just that! Pours a very clear, although solid looking, golden yellow. Big white foamy head that disappeared into a nice lacing. Although the lacing disappeared as the beer was consumed. The aroma is pretty strong for a beer that may initially come off as being possibly weak in stature. Nose is full of strong polish hops with just a tiny hint of sweetness and alcohol. Smells like a strong pilsner, actually. The taste starts out with the same hops in the aroma. I can imagine that some folks might find this flavor to be a little stringent. The hops get stronger as the flavors spread through the palate, then in comes some sweetness and a little bit of alcohol. Finishes pretty dry with a slight biscuity aftertaste. Overall, a very smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation presence. Nice. Now, this beer may seem not too drinkable at first, and I wasn't able to test out my theory. However. I think after two or three my palate would adjust quite nicely and I could really settle into a good session."
"Drinkability - Very sessionable. Be a nice easy drinking lager on a hot day."
"D - While I'm not a huge fan of EPLs as a style, it's not a brain surgeon's task to pick out the ones are better than the others. This is one of them. Easy. That's the best way to sum it up. This beer is OK in my book. Heh heh... Sorry. I couldn't resist. Just too easy..."
"Pours a brilliantly clear straw hue with a fizzy white two finger head. Passing retention but little to no lace. Weak saaz aroma with background pale malt and a hint of corn or DMS. Sweet pale malt and a pinch of light munich malt upfront, followed by a mild saaz and spicy tettnanger hop flavor. Drying aftertaste, with muted hop flavor but decently balancing bitterness. Crisp carbonation and lightish body- borrowing some depth of character and texture form the munich malt. A lively and zesty mouthfeel that accentuates the timid hop acidity. Finishes clean and highly drinkable. The hop character is surprisingly subuded, but this still has a great flavor and is a credit to the style."
"O.K. Beer pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is a little grainy, maybe a little hoppy. The malt hits first followed by the hops. It's not bad for the style which typically doesn't get me too excited in the first place. Worth a try, particularly if you like continental lagers, especially the eastern European varieties."
"I will have to look into this beer a little more in the summer months..."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale malt scent that is a bit sweet. It also has a grainy feel with a slighty musty aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit dry and just a tad musty. Hops are present, but low in bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's smooth and highly quaffable."
"5.6% alc by volume on label,poured into a 1.5 liter stein a clear light golden with a nice fluffy white crown atop.Light aromas somewhat sweet and grainy mainly malt driven a light toastiness comes thru as I drink more,lightly sweet flavors with that husky type flavor really showing thru into a spicey finish although not real sharp just a nice little bite.A better than average pale lager to be had maybe a newer recipe because its not as big as many past reviewers stated and the alc% is lower than posted,a pretty good offering."
"*The label also boasted this as a 'full, light beer'. The percentage it listed was 5.7... ok?"""
"Pours a golden color with pretty good head. Has a very nice aroma with great maltiness and a touch of hops. The taste is sweet and clean with a bit of hops for a clean finish. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation but is pleasant. A very drinkable lager."
"Mouthfeel is the saving grace of this beer. Light bodied, but bigger than some pale lagers. Strong carbonation that lasts through the swallow is very lively and interesting. Still, I didn't enjoy this beer and didn't even really want to finish my portion of it."
"Pale golden, forming a nice creamy head. High initial carbonation, appetizing smell. Taste is rather diappointing, on the sour side. Lots of hops and yeasts, but their balance with malts is obviously improper. Aftertaste is also sour. Typical Polish lager, losing points to Czech and German counterparts."
"Mouthfeel- Light and slick, the carbonation is excellent... all I can say is *wow*... what a perfect all-day quaffer for the summertime when a bit of sharp, dry European flavor is on your agenda. I will be aggressively seeking this out for the cooler this year."
" Typical simple but decent stuff from the north side of the Tatras."
"My expectations were exceeded with this beer. The nose was one of the best I've experienced for this style of beer - very earthy/malty and fresh. I'll revisit this lager when it's grilling weather. I'm sure some bbq flesh would go nice with this."
"This one pours a clear yellow-gold color with a brilliant white head. The head falls pretty quickly, but leaves a small lace-producing ring around the glass. The smell has more of a hop character than I expected. Flowery and hoppy, with a pils-like malt foundation. Just a touch of sweetness in the taste, with a nice hop flavor. More pilsner malt comes forth in the taste than the aroma. I have to admit, its much better than expected, and certainly better than just okay. Soft and rounded body, which leans appropriately to the lighter side. Hoppy finish, although a little more bitterness would have been appreciated. This is a nice drinking brew, and, I think, would make a decent transition beer for the macro crowd."
"D - Ugh. This is not an OK beer. This is a pretty terrible beer. It's flavor is not appetizing at all. I will never have this again. I could not bear to session it. I'd take any American macro lager (that I have had) over this. Sure, this has more flavor, but more isn't always a good thing. I was, in an extreme fit of masochism, able to finish this, that is the only reason it is scoring this high in drinkability."
"Its what you would expect from the style to be honest. Refreshing and fairly easy to pull down just nothing to crack any interest. Some will say its great sessioning this or good lawn mower type beer but there are much better offerings available that don't come from across the pond."
"Nothing I'll go out of my way to find again, but I won't turn one down if handed to me."
"I will definately be buying this beer again. And it comes in a brown bottle! Praise Jesus, a Euro-lager in a brown bottle! And it has enough alcohol to survive the trek across the atlantic. Praise be!"
"This is a darn good Pale Euro Lager. I enjoyed it."
"The mouthfeel is average, and the drinkability is good. I could down it quickly, and the small amount of flavor it does have is enjoyable."
"O.K. Beer from Okocim Brewery is impressive, most impressive!"
"Pours a beautiful light honey color. Haven't seen a pale lager with such nice color. Smells a bit grassy with apple. Taste is delicate, fruity, and about the same as every other european lager (sad, but true). Can't knock it for this though, because there are some nice subtle flavors here. Very drinkable. My bottle says 5.6 % ABV. Worth a try."
"Poured a vibrant golden straw. Muted aroma, a bit of grain. Flavor was bright, and surprisingly fresh, since I'm sure it took a while for this beer to make it to my local store. Hopping was reserved, but there were clear Czech/Bohemian influences. Some smooth grain and a touch of grassyness finished. Not bad at all."
"Smooth, easy drinking, and pretty inexpensive for a quality beer."
"Tastes light and citrusy with a lot of lemon coming through, sweet, perhaps a nuttyness to it. A lot more ""OK"" than I thought it would be- especially for two dollars. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, a bit watery, nothing special. Quite drinkable, goes down easy, and inexpensive- a solid beer."
"Tried this after reading some of the many favorable reviews on BA. Poured a clear bright gold with a white foamy head, not much lacing at all. Slightly grainy nose similar to American lagers but more prominant and much less skunk like. Taste was pleasant, somewhat grainy again with a touch of lemon? A little bit of a hop kick in the finish. Overall, an easy drinking light bodied brew that is well suited to the weather I have now in N.Y."
"Quite typical of a European Lager in that it looks medium straw in color and forms an dainty white head that laces decently. It smells terribly skunked at first but dispates quickly; unlike Heineken. After the aroma settles it becomes watery quicky but holds its malt / hop balance. Moderate vegetal and buttery tones. Holds fairly creamy mouthfeel, but slick. Aftertaste is crisp and lingers with mild hop bitterness."
"The name, ironically, says it all. This is an O.K. Beer, no more, no less."
"Drinkability: OK for a Euro lager; note that the abv on my bottle was 5.6% so perhaps the abv has been reduced across the board for this brew"
"Has that grassy, wheat corn aroma, prevalent in many European lagers, with a slight malt sweetness, and a grainey bitterness, slightly bolder than its American counterparts so its slightly better, and ranked as only average. Medium golden lager with an average white head and lively carbonation and a short, watery finish. Short be able to finish alot whilst working in the yard on a hot summer day."
"very drinkable, unlike with american pale lagers, were this clean, smooth and flavorful."
"In the end, O.K. Beer is okay beer. It's a big fish when judged against its peers, but not when forced to swim in the larger ocean of craft beer. I understand that the O.K. of its name is based on the name of the brewery, but it does convey a certain lack of self assurance and may be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or I could be spouting a bunch of absolute nonsense (the most likely theory, I'm afraid). Better though to call your beer 'Abso-fu**in'-lutely Fantastic Beer' and take your chances, no?"
"Mouthfeel thin, but not bad. Generally refreshing, and it tastes pretty good right now. Overall, not a classic, but it is a decent session/lawnmower-type beer."
"I haven't had this one in a long while. Perfect session brew. It is listed here as 6.2%, but my bottle says 5.6%. When 98% percent of humans think of a perfect beer, this is comes to mind. A .5L bottle pours into my pint glass with a frothy head bringing it exactly to the rim. It has a golden hue with a little bibt of orange. The flavor is malty with hints of citrus. They don't cocme more drinkable. A perfect beer to throw back while sitting on a bar stool. Cheers."
"Overall: Tasty stuff, much better than I expected, and remembered."
"Not worth what I paid, but certainly not bad."
"Drinkability: I cant see how anyone could call this something other than perfect. Realize; this is not the most flavorful, complex or even tasty beer around, but it has an awesome ability to be consumed and appreciated for what it is: A European export lager. I can only imagine how easy this is to drink when fresh on tap. SUPER easy to drink. Amazing fact about this beer: Its 6.2% ABV. It tastes mid 4s. Drink with caution."
"Picked this one up out of pure curiousity. No freshness or best before dating on the bottle, I'm curious to the age. Pours a nice golden yellow with a minimal head into my glass. Faint malty aromas invade the nose. First taste of this leaves me pleasantly surprised. There's a nice slightly sweet finish to this beer with no notes of alcohol. Miniscule notes of floral hops round out the palate. Mouthfeel is not watery thankfully. Drinkability is super high on this one. I had no clue of the 6.2 abv. This was a decent pickup. These kind of lagers will probably never be my favorite but I could easily convince some of my macro drinking friends to pick up a few 500 mls of these."
"this is a good lager. pale and clear like most, its cleanwith a big malty profile, a modest dose of hops and the slightest alcohol whiff. clean and smooth throughout. its simple and does nothing amazing but everything good. a more than easy to drink crisp beer ill have any day of the week. good stuff."
"Well being Polish myself, I could get quite a bit of Polish brews. So slowly I'll try to review as much as possible. However, I've never had the O.K. beer and I quite like it. Pours out a pale yellow with a decent enough head on it. Smell consisted of malts and grains. Some hops at a distant though. Taste was nice. Malts upfront with some grain and some spicy hops towards the end. It's nicely done. For a 6.2% beer, the mouthfeel was a little too thin though. But other than that it was a good brew. Gotta like the crest with the goat trying to pick up and drink the beer."
" I was impressed with this Polish lager, and would keep a few around if I didn't have to drive three hours to find it. This would be an excellent, session lager."
"Copper color, with a head that leaves a layer on top after it fades from a moderate white head on the pour. Not a very strong scent. A light euro lager scent. Taste is big and malty, with the alcohol melding nicely with the flavor. One of my favorite Euro Lagers so far. I would get this again, very solid."
"Very drinkable. Didn't know that Poland made good beer. I will buy this again."
"Pale golden color with nice frothy white head. Nice, consistent lacing along the glass, and a balanced aroma of hops and malt. Significantly hoppier taste, slightly salty. Brisk and refreshing mouthfeel, though a bit smoother than its American brothers. Brings to mind fond memories of brick oven pizza."
"It really is an unassuming lager. It doesnt do anything spectacular but doesnt screw anything up, either. I really think that this is the standard-bearer based on availability here in the US. Nicely done, Okocim!"
"For you Viking pilsener fans, like Aass, bad Grolsch, baked Bitburger, etc., this is your beer. Chewy Pils here. High in alcohol ... I think. At least that's how it seems after basting my palate with it. Scented of steamed roots, herbs and mustard, it wanders across the palate with bitter, green woody tannins and glazed tropical fruit. Humongous lager. Over-reaching, stern and violently bitter on the finish, it is not a stoopid beer. Instead it is branfrax. Threatening, but satisfying. Filtered probably. Pasteurized? don't knowe..."
"Pours a pale golden color with an agressive head that stays for a long time. Smells of grass and not much else. Taste is rather average in my opinoin, nothing to write home about. Malt breadiness is the main flavor and herbal hops are there to balance it out, but the flavors are very subdued. I can't believe this is 6.2% abv because I don't detect any alcohol presence. Finish makes me forget that I am even drinking beer. Overall this is a well crafted, balanced beer that lacks the bite to truly be a ""good"" beer in my opinoin."
"This is easy to drink and pretty smooth. Needs a little more flavor to be more than ""ok""."
"This is the beer that made me fall in love with polish lagers when I first had it on tap, tonight I sample the bottled version. Pours an incredible head that fills the glass and sticks to it all the way down. Color is a very pale and very clear gold. The nose is sweet with a mild spicyness. Taste is typical to the style which is dominated by the sweet malts. Not much in the way of hops here except maybe in the aftertaste. I could drink several of these in a sitting without stopping to think twice about it. A fine light polish lager."
"Color is a light to medium golden yellow. Poured with a very large head. Crystal clear. This one smelled a bit skunky, but not too bad. Flavor is a bit watery. It's an OK pilsner but it has much more potential. Dry finish with some bitter aftertaste. Not much alcohol taste despite the fact it's 6.2abv according to the label. This one is has a better than average drinkability since there is not much to think about. It's a stright forward clean crisp pilsner, nothing complex. Better than an American macro, similar in taste to a Canadian macro. Would go great at the ballgame with a hot dog. A good example of a European Pilsner, good, not great."
"This is a very good lager/pilsner, stronger and creamier than what is typical for the style. Pours a nice, golden hue, with a creamy head that remains. Malt and hops are evident, no trace of the extra alcohol. The taste is discernably different, has an almost salty character. Not quite as refreshing as my favorite pilsners, but creamier and more of a kick. If you see it, give it a try. A nice alternative."
"Interesting brew!"
"Just a shade on the amber side of gold. I didn't get much head retention. Intriguing, brassy aroma of light caramel maltiness and forceful medicinal hops. Flavor profile contains white bread, mint, and a subtle smokiness. Finish is very dry and crisp with a metallic twang that I would say is the only offputting feature. Unusual herbal, minty, medicinal hops give this beer a twist from the ordinary fizzy yellow lager. Some may think this is a poor purpose for a beer (and they would not be accurate), but this would make an excellent palate cleanser. Easy to drink and alcohol is nestled unobtrusively in the malt flavor."
"On the pour a cloudless gold or straw color if your so inclined, the head impressive in size and frothy in its consistency, the lace fair sheets to cover the glass. Malt dominated nose, that is also crisp and clean, refreshing also comes to mind. Start is sweet and the top lean in feel. The finish is spitefully acidic with a middling hop presence and a droughty lingering aftertaste, average and drinkable, which is good enough I guess."
"This was the last remaining bottle of my recent score of Polish Pilsners, and I'm glad I saved it for last. Pale straw in color, with a thin, bubbly head. Aroma is very mild with slight grainy notes and a hint of hops. The taste starts off with a pleasant, slightly citric hop flavor, undergirded by a light malty sweetness. Malt picks up a little mid-palate, accompanied by a moderate warming taste of alcohol, and is finished with a somewhat unusual and astringent hop bitterness. Very well-carbonated and light in the mouth. Best cold, but definitely one of the better pilsners presently produced by the Fatherland. Na Zdrowie!"
"Boston area I can get it for less than $2 a 500 ml bottle, a six pack of the stuff in NYC is about $12. Needless to say I like buying it in Beantown. Perky white lace and a good golden clarity, clean aroma with a whiff of hops and sweet malt. Superb crispness with a dry malt character that brings a bready flavour to the palate, clean in the mouth with a quick snappy bite of hops that linger into the after taste. One of my favourite Euro lagers."
"Notes: A most interesting and strong lager. The unique hop profile might take certain drinkers some getting used to."
