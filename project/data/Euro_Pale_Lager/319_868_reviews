"Had it in a restaurant in Vienna. Wasn't impressed."

"Overall - one of the best pale lagers I've ever had, cleaner and crisper than others in the style and more of a floral feel to it."

"O: A cross between a Munich Helles and a Czech Pilsner, slightly forgettable but I wouldn’t refuse another if offered one."

"Gosser pours from the 11.2 ounce bottle a cloudy yellow color with fairly thin foam. Some lacing reluctantly stuck to the glass and trailed the liquid surface down. Not the most attractive thing, but beer nonetheless. The aroma has a strong bread character--very doughy--coming from it's pale malt. This theme continues on the palate and is joined by a hint of sulfur and metallic. A carbonated finish is tinged with the slightest bitterness. This beer exceeded expectations, which were not very high to begin with."

"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Pale amber green color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light grain and malt nose and flavor is light malty sweet and grainy. 330ml bottle from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."

"Gösser is exactly the kind of serviceable and well-constructed lager you'd expect from a nation of people who appreciate good beer, like to drink a lot of it, but don't care much to deviate from what they're accustomed to. It is a good national-brand lager though, like any national-brand lager, the country produces better brands that are simply harder to come by."

"O: This beer might seem to be somewhat bland, but it's extremely drinkable and doesn't have any off-flavors or skunk. The fruity aromas and flavors seem to be a little unusual for a lager (as opposed to an ale) and might be a byproduct of the Austrian water. Overall, I thought that this beer wasn't that bad compared to others in the style."

"O: Good drinkability. Classic easidrinking German Lager. Recommended"

"Good balanced, sort of, flavours. Sweet malts, some grain, lighter bitterness here than in the smell. A well rounded brew that I find satisfying and a good price..$8.69 for the 6 pack of 11.2 oz bottles. Not as good as the Dark but like i said, satisfying."

"Overall it wasn't great but I would have a pint of this lager before any macro. In fact it was better than other Euro Pale lagers I have tried. It surpassed most beers from Polland I have tried (Zubr, Warka, Zywiec). Not worth a detour but if it is available give it a try its enjoyable."
"O: Gösser is a classic party beer amongst my friends. The flavours are small, but nice, and it's very easy to drink. Well, those are its best features. The beer is also great with salty snacks and lighter food - like peanuts or sandwiches."
"Clear and pale yellow with a white, finger-high cap that dissipated over a few minutes leaving behind a thin skim of bubbles coating the surface. There was a bit of short-lived, spotty lacing. Mild aroma with light notes of grainy malt, noble hops (spicy and floral), and fruity esters. Clean, mild flavour with some dry malts up front, low bitterness, floral and grassy, and a hint of spicy hops in the finish. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, fair texture. A passable euro lager, but ultimately forgettable."
"Final Grade: 3.13, a C+."
"Overall, this is a pretty average beer. It is drinkable, but not special for any reason."
"O – Not a lot here… a refreshing highly drinkable brew and a decent beer, but if this is “Austria’s Finest Beer” I’m won’t be going to Austria anytime soon 3"
"I bought this thinking it was the Dark. How disappointed am I? 1 very average beer."
"D - Easily drinkable, but not all that memorable. Would quench your thirst on a hot day, but there's more flavourful offerings that I would choose over this one."
"Drink - Just another average euro beer.. nothing worth seeking out."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a faint skunkiness, sweet malt and kind of standard lager like smells. In the taste, a small dryness, a light malt, and actually no real taste at all. A smooth, and light and watery mouthfeel , with a small dry malt in the aftertaste. Thin, no real taste and lack there of aroma."
"Taste is nice, full grain, plenty of tingly, almost minty herbal hop bitterness, a light mineral quaility. It leans slightly to a leaner, less malty, hoppier and more bitter side so it's more like a very good, if not great, German Pilsner in taste and feel, rather than a helles or Czech Pilsner. I would say that this is really a German Pilsner, but it falls well under the ""Europ Pale Lager"" category, too, being a bit simpler and with a thinness and faint roughness to the character. However, although not among the best German pilsners, it is far better than many other German Pilsners I've had and is very good."
"As far as Euro ""umlaut"" lager is concerned, this one ain't bad. I just really wish brewers would stop throwing around the ""best beer"" or ""finest beer"" moniker on their labels, cause this one sure isn't. Still, a highly drinkable lager, and a decent summer brew."
"Picked up a 500 ml can, proclaims to be Austria's finest beer, let's give it a whirl. From the first smell this must be an adjunct. This brew smells like corn and more corn. Checking the label it says ""kornmalt"" which appears to be in line with my assumptions. The beer pours to a bright yellow with a thin head that dissipates quickly. The taste is well, corny. Tastes kind of like a corn mash that got fermented way short of moonshine. Very similar taste to ""chicha"" a fermented corn beverage sold in the Colombian countryside. Taste aside from corny is sweet and dry no real bitterness to speak of, consistent throughout. For fermented corn its not bad, for beer its not to good. Well if this is ""Austria's finest beer"" I won't be seeking out any more brew from Austria."
"Notes: A decent beer for when you want just something easy and inoffensive to drink. Refreshing pilsener, but a bit too thin and not enough flavor to really be good."
"The beer smells as a pilsner should, fresh with a light citrus smell. The head is very white and stays for a while. Nice carbonation."
"D- I like this beer...it isn't the most refreshing beer out there, due to a thicker body than what is typical and is a flavorful beer overall. The alcohol is well hidden. It's clean and would be a good session beer but might change up after 2 or 3. A nice Austrian brew!"
"Gösser gives you a very respectable light European lager. It pours a light shade of gold with a white head that seems to linger a little bit. The beer smells slightly skunky, but has a good taste. The mouthfeel is nice, a nice amount of carbonation. The drinkability is very high for this beer. It is easy to drink and doesn't really have much of an aftertaste. If you're looking for a decent light lager then give Gösser a try."
"Taste: This tastes kind of fake, and the lemon citrusy taste that comes through is that off citrus taste that lemon cleaning products have. Otherwise it is a typical, not too bad, drinkable euro pale."
"It paired perfectly with some delicious homemade cheesy bread. I imagine it would be great with almost any other food. I would recommend this beer to anyone I know, as it far exceeded my expectations."
"D- I could see myself drinking this paired with food, but, not so much as a stand alone beer I would drink solely to enjoy."
"Light bodied with spritzy carbonation. Thin and watery. It's not a drain pour, but I wont be having it again."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale gold color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is fairly mild. There is a light bitterness but not a lot of flavor from this beer. Feels watery and bitter in mouth. Drinkability is good, it goes down smooth. Overall a mediocore brew."
"Overall, better than average for the style. The canned version (reviewed here) isn't bad. No tinges of metallic taste, etc. I do have to say that it is better on tap. Complimented some nice Austrian comfort food pretty well."
"Drinkability - decent enough, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have another."
"D- This is an interesting enough beer that would be pretty easy to throw a few of them back in one session.This is definitely a little more interesting than your average Euro Lager, but not something that I would go out and purchase again. Worth a try"
"Overall for the price, its just terrible. Avoid."
"D: This is a slightly more interesting version of your standard Euro lager, with a nice mouthfeel and a refreshing taste. Although not amazing, it's pretty nice."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery and I struggled to finish my can so I'd rate drinkability quite low as well. Austria - I wonder how you feel about this being labeled as your finest."
"Comes out of the tap a clear golden yellow with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong and crisp and has a faint citrus hint. Flavor is typically lagerish but with a little more depth than most lagers. Texture is clean, crisp and smooth. Worth a try."
"the problem with Austrian beers will be similar to the problem with Swiss beers I guess: the water is too hard ... this usually gives a light bodied beer with a soury note ... ok as a thirst quencher in summer, but not a beer to enjoy"
"The carbonation is average, the bubbles medium. The liquid is a bit smooth."
"D - Not bad at all. Could be a very nice session lager, or a good beer to woo your BMC friends away from the macro crap lagers that are prevalent in the states. Euro lagers are never really mind blowing, but they are light years ahead of our domestic shit-lagers."
"Compared to some of the usual BMC suspects, this one might hold its own for throwing back a few during a ball game, but I didn't think it was anything special."
"Drinkability: Fairly bland even for the style, and I could certainly do without all the sourness."
"I was quite impressed, if this is the beer of austria, it can't be so bad!"
"D- This is a very easy drinking euro pale lager that I could drink in great quantities, this is a good candidate for a foreign session beer as it is well-balanced with good, but not outstanding flavor. I am not a big fan of the style, but this is a solid, simple lager worth trying out."
"I tried this beer after purchasing it from the local LCBO store. The beer poured a medium translucent gold colour into a glass with a loose white head that disappeared within minutes. The odour was similar to many pale lager types with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel was clean, crisp, and light. The flavour wasn't very hoppy at all. Not too many discernable flavours if any."
"Pours a pale golden color topped by a small, tight white head that dissipates after only a few minutes. Aroma of slightly skunked adjunct malt is evident as soon as the cap is popped - light notes of moderately bitter pops and pilsner malt, but mainly skunk. Palate is a balance between mildly sweet adjunct malt and some slightly skunked hops. Mouthfeel is typical of a Euro lager - light and a touch creamy. I suppose I could put a few of these back, but it's not exactly a memorable experience."
"Pours a pale straw color with a nice and fluffy white head that so far has left a wall of lacing on the glass. The smell is faint and grainy, has that Euro green bottle skunk smell. The taste is of light grassy noble hops, grainy malt, and a metallic skunk taste. The feel is watery and dull, doesn't really have that crisp taste of a lager. A typical Euro lager sample probably a notch above the mainstream Euro lagers. Easy drinking, good for summer weather."
"Quite surprised by this Austrian Export. Poured a bright pale yellow, with a very slight haze. The head was tight and compact lasting well over 5 minutes. A sharp aroma of noble hops with perhaps a faint smell of malt in the nose. The lager was fairly well balanced, a bit sweet in the middle, with a nice dry hoppiness in the finish. While not a great lager, it does tower of most massed produced Euro-Lagers. Closer to a North German Pils than a Dortmunder Export."
"So . . . what is good about this beer? Well, it is delicate and drinkable. It lacks many of the flaws that I see in American macro-lagers, while still trying to be as close to water as possible."
"pale yellow beer left virtually no head. Smelt of faint hops and grain. Taste was very light compared to other euro pale lagers. Subtle hops and malts were noted. A bit thin on the palate, but overall a smooth, easy drinking beer. would certainly have this on a hot summers day."
"This beer pours a boring golden color with a moderate head. The smell is much like a pilsner with a hint of wheat and a bit of sweetness. The taste doesnt have much too it, but is mostly like a wheaty lager with a good amount of carbonation that keeps the taste dancing on your tongue just long enough for you to enjoy it. There is also nothing with the aftertaste to be desired. This beer would be great if youre looking to down many of them, but as far as a craft brew goes it falls well below par."
"Pours a pale gold, close to yellow, with virtually no head and not much rising carbonation. At first, it smells like a Heineken, but that hoppy note fades over time, and a slight palte malt aroma comes out. On the palate, slightly creamy malts, grainy at the mid-palate, finishes dry. There's not much there, but nothing offensive either. Mouthfeel is thin, a bit watery, without any brisk carbonation. Overall, there's not a helluva a lot to like here, but compared to other lagers of this type, there's very little to dislike. I'd take this over a Heineken or Stella any day."
"I've had a hard time categorizing the Austrian beers because they're less hoppy than their German or Czech cousins. Pretty balanced light beer."
"Will lose the battle to an average Czech or Bavarian lager, but clearly a winner over other Austrian pale beers."
"First taste is quite hoppy and earthy, very pleasant and refreshing. Grassy hops move on to reveal a quite pleasant and mellow sweet malt presence. This is a much more hoppy beer than I expected though, closer to a Pils than a Euro Pale... A bit thin in the mouth but goes down very dry and quaffs well. Quite a refreshing beer, extremely enjoyable, but possibly mis-categorized."
" D: drinkability is really high. You could take a few of these down in the summer no doubt."
"Overall: Soft, inoffensive and a low key Euro lager. Just, well..boring really."
"500ml can purchased from LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Reviewed while the beer was freshly purchased, and fresh period. Medium gold pour and a full white head with full fizziness. Just right for style. Sweet malty nose, more malty than most. Flavor is grainy and grassy in the forefront then is folowed up with the sweetness of the malt. Aftertaste is long and dry, dry enough for another."
"Good stiff foamy head with an aggressive pour, clear straw yellow, nice puff of hoppy/skunky nose which was quite enjoyable, taste that followed was a more subtle version of the smell, could have used more oomph, mouthfeel was very smooth, a very gulpable beer that takes it's place among other solid Euro lagers, but does not stand out."
"Yellow under puffy spume radiates roasted oat marshmallow treats. Creamy clean attack dries quick leaving a mild tin residue around the back of the tongue. Whirls of soft sulfur accompany these other things. Gösser is not sweet or hoppy enough for most people to enjoy but will wash down a mouthful of sushi like a champion."
"1/2 liter can poured a golden-straw colored lager with a decent fluffy cap. Good lacing and the cap has fair retention. Medium effervescence. A pungent aroma of bread dough with grassy-mown hay hop tones ( very promising). Mouth feel a tad thin... malt backbone ( sweet doughy) does not stand out against the hops ( far too pronounced for a helles) which add a lemon twang to the clean finish. Not a bad beer but not enough malt pronouncement for a Helles and a tad much for a pilsner... Is this a pilsner trying to be a Dortmunder or a Helles trying to be a Pilsner? ...this beer has an identity crisis....not bad though."
"Looks to be, at first glance, another one trick pony of a euro lager, and was I right. Pale straw color, bubbly white head. Smells predictably of grassy malt and nothing more, no hops, no nothing. More of a malt backbone than other euros, but still a predictably boring, hopelessly hopless beer."
"It pours a clear straw golden color with a decent white head that doesn't last too long, yet leaves some lacing, light grainy and flowery aromas. Bready and grainy flavors, light to medium bodied, nice crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean with some sweetness, I am very impressed with this above average lager."
"The mouthfeel is full but finishes very crisp, very quenching. This is great stuff, I think I found a new favorite pils. It would definitely make a great session lager. A fine example of the style, and it's quite a looker too."
"When poured into my glass, the head was very small sized, white and it contained fine-sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was clear and there was very little carbonation present.The hue was yellow and there was no lacing.The nose was malty and the flavor was bitter, hoppy, tangy and it had an aftertaste that lingered.The mouthfeel was tingly and light-medium bodied.I was not real impressed with this beer."
"Light gold color, cloudy, medium head. Aroma is grainy, fruity and sweet. A light bodied wheat beer. Milder malts, slightly sweet and somewhat fruity. Some banana and clove flavor. Mild taste. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftetaste is neutral."
"Clear and pale yellow color, decent 1/2 inch head of foam. Partial comma-like lacing in a standard pint glass. Acidic aroma, slight sufur skunk, and a sense of hops somewhat like milkweed. Light body, a bit too overcarbonated for my tastes. Malts are straightforward, slight skunk and a tea-like hop impression balance adequately and dry the finish somewhat. Not awful or great, could be an OK session brew..."
"Bought and drank this one in San Marino. Clear, straw golden with a sea foam white head atop medium-large bubbles with poor retention and no lacing. Aroma is lightly of apples, yeast, and weak hops. Mouthfeel is fizzy with a thin watery body. Medium-high carbonation. Taste is weak, watery with a sweet corn tang halfway through. The finish has a plain bitterness with a moderately dry finish. Alcohol is barely perceptable. Plain through and through...nothing to ring home about."
"A very smooth offering, I am glad I have met it...Recomended."
"Color is a clear gold bordering on being pale, with a strong foamy white head thats about two fingers high with some divets and leaves patchy lace. Smell is faintly soft with a acidy tang of lemon-lime-like bittersweet hop. Taste is pretty intesting, its smooth, crisp, and clean with the hop standing out as a unusual lime peel, very bitter tang twing to it thats not strong but its there. Not like a belgian wit or hefe-weisen strength in taste. It remined me of a mild IPA with a bit more thinned out malt and hop. Its not bad, its more of a solid pilsner feel and taste, but as a pale lager its a bit short."
"It looks nice but the taste and the smell are undesireable. Straw color with little body and a bitter aftertaste. Not a good Austrian beer, a weak lager and not a great representation of Austrian brewing. It is good on a hot day when it is served very cold, but for the price should be avoided and a wheat or abbey tripel could be more enticing."
"Gösser is the only Austrian beer I have found to date, so what beer style should it taste like? This mild Lager is straw/gold in color and very clear. There's an herbal quality to the light/medium malt. The hop bitterness is unique in that they possess a pectin and lime-like flavor. Smooth and velvety. Clean and refreshing and a low amount of aftertaste. Good summer brew for the sausage cookout."
"Pretty much all I can ask for in a beer."
"--I enjoyed this beer. It was nothing spectacular but I could sit in a pub, preferably in Austria, and drink this all night. A great beer for hanging out, and having a few."
"Clear bright yellow hue, small, but well-retained head. Sweetly aromatic from afar: a little floral, dry hops, on the pilsener side, with a touch more sweetness. I was a bit put off by an initial resemblance in the aroma to typical American lagers, but that soon passed. Decent, but short finish. Clean and smooth, but woefully short on flavor of any kind. Pretty much lock-in-step with any old lager. Light body, minimal texture, nothing terrible here, but absolutely nothing to remember it by, either."
"Pours very clean with a decent white head. Good hoppiness. Very crisp and clean tasting. Tends to be a little skunky. Light in body, but big in flavor. Goes down smooth and lingers with a spritzy lemon-like taste. Overall, I recommend this beer. Serve at a medium temperature. A good summer beer to drink outside."
"Pretty thin and horrible, too fizzy aswell. Yellow appearance, with fizzy mineral water head, no aroma, and pretty close to noe flavour, perhaps a bit of malt in there, but too bland in my books."
"Gosser: This is an Austrian import that seems very popular in my area, and is virtually always on sale.  It is sold in green bottles, and has a similar aroma to other Euro-lagers, with that faint skunk aroma. However, the taste is much lighter and refreshing than a Heineken, for example, and went down very, very well.  This is a smooth beer that is worth a look."
"Notes: Found this at the bottom of the shelves at my local ghetto package store. Came in a 12-pack box. To my surprise Gösser turned out to be a very nice alternative (to the US norm) lager. Very enjoyable and flavourful. Great all around knock-em-back beer."
