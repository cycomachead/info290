A bit more honey than vegetable in the flavor and more skunk/ sulfur on the nose. However it is very quaffable and refreshing and sets it's own standards. Good not great.

Revisiting it this weekend was uninspiring. It's heavier in malt than I remember, seemingly stale and under carbonated, and definitely light struck in its once distinguishing green glass. Skunks for sure, this may be a little older than optimal, but it's heavy as these lagers go, more sturdy and definitely with more malt flavor. I bet this is much better fresh at the source, but it doesn't travel real well in my experience. More filling than it should be, just quite unremarkable compared to my nostalgia.","StonedTrippin","Nov 02, 2014"

2.49,-19.7,2.5,2.75,2.25,2.75,2.5,"DATE REVIEWED: May 31, 2014... GLASSWARE: 22oz. pilsner... OCCASION: today Shan and I entered the 21st century and purchased smart phones... APPEARANCE: bubbly, translucent straw-gold body that holds a soapy yet meaningful white head for a few minutes--pedestrian from a distance or close up; zero lacing... AROMA: beefy, metallic malts couple with a somewhat funky yeast profile to imbue a biscuit and cracker aroma--not aromatic, but not a turnoff... PALATE: medium-bodied, warming with heavy aftertaste; nearly water at the teeth... TASTE: yeasty, doughy and metallic, evoking a hot summer sip of the garden hose; rather easy drinking, but an aftertaste that offers gas and malt liquor sweetness...some cardboard in the finish...OVERALLL: the 16 oz. stopper-top bottle is retro cool, but no getting around the fact that the beer is pretty average at best, with a better critic suggesting this combines the less desirable traits of a pilsner and a lager--pinging and fat, so sessioning is not on the to-do list with Groslch either...on the plus side, it is fun pronouncing Grolsch correctly in front of friends and bartenders....","dacrza1","May 31, 2014"

3.18,2.6,3,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Gets style points for the iconic bottle and you have to try this one eventually, assuming you are willing to sample mainstream Euro lagers ... Pours a very pale stubble hue with ample carbonation. Aroma is notably skunky but perhaps less so than some other green bottle ""classics", sweet corn, some wet and almost swampy barley malt, a whiff of vinous fruit. Smells like a pale Euro lager in a green bottle, albeit maybe a tad better than average: A recurring theme here ... Better than expected but only a little better than expected. Palate is quite crisp and bitter, some DMS cooked flavor but a decent dose of pungent fresh green vegetable flavor as well (grass, carrot, zucchini), dry popcorn malt, a little nondescript tartness that hints at grape, metal, oxidation trans-2 nonenal notes like wet cardboard, and a dry bitter finish that does not stand out as particularly unique to any one hop variety. All in all, this well-known beer may capture a classic lager flavor profile better than many other commercial examples (dry, crisp, bitter, not particularly sweet) but the name and instantly recognizable container may goad one in thinking that this is going to be more exciting than the cold, fizzy reality bears out.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 17, 2013"

The nose comprises light powdered sugar, wheat, and a touch of dry grass. The taste holds notes of grass, sweet corn, funky wheat, and a kiss of greens. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a limp little lager, one that eschews a pilsner background in favor of a more, shall we say, mass-produced adjunct-y character.","TMoney2591","Nov 15, 2012"

2.51,-19,2,3.5,2,3.5,2,"Oh, and I noticed that this one was brewed in the U.K., as many Euro lagers are here in Britain. European breweries will often set up a separate brewery in the UK for their sales there or license them to another brewery. However, this is often done to produce a second lower-alcohol version of the beer which apparently is more popular with the English. In the case of this Grolsch, the alcohol content is the same, so it may be an exact replica of the beer actually brewed in the Netherlands.","ElCommodoro","Aug 09, 2011"

There isn't much to it so you even get some CO2 from the nose as the carbonation takes hold. The beer is actually very drinkable, because it doesn't have much flavor. It's just pale malts with a light bitterness. It drank light and crisp and disappeared too quickly. This is very drinkable but not because of what it brings to the table. It's a standard Euro pale lager, nothing special.","aasher","May 26, 2011"

I can understand the roots of our American Adjunct Lagers when I taste a good German lager and it makes me sad for what we lost for so many years through Prohibition.

When the skunk factor is removed as it was on these it was a whole different animal. When I popped the top and poured there was no skunk aroma at all, just a nice blend of malt and hops. Of course this is a milder beer but it was exactly what it should be. If you can find it fresh it is an excellent Euro Pale.

Still, it's pretty good, as far as lagers go. The color of Grolsch is golden, and it has excellent clarity.

Pale euro lager in appearance and pretty much no head for the most part. The smell is kinda skunky because it's been sitting under supermarket lights in its single form, so I wont hold it against the beer. The taste is for the most part, average. Like a maltier, tastier version of its mass produced cousin. The mouthfeel is also fairly heavy for lager, and I commend them for achieving that with how pale the beer is! The drinkability is the high part of this beer. Very sessionable, and out of the ordinary. It will definitely get people talking if you drink it right out of the flip top!

It is everything a generic Western European lager should be. Poured into a pilsner glass. Pretty carbonation, good head retention, and the colour of pale straw, everything I look for in a lager. The smell is where it gets tricky. I've always known this to be a skunky beer, but it's one of the top most skunky beers I've had the pleasure of smelling. Other than that, corn adjuncts, malty sweet, and a slight soapiness that all compliment the skunkiness. Taste isn't awful, decent hop bitterness to offset the malts. Dry mouthfeel, sticks to the throat a bit, zingy on the tongue. More drinkable on tap I think, but whatever, this is a very average Euro lager, not super offensive, but certainly not the peak of the brewers art.","trevorwideman","Jan 04, 2006"

I know it's mass produced but so are Beemer's, and , look at them compared to a tin can Cadillac. Europeans seem to take a little more pride in what they do. And, compared to the mass produced garbage made in the U.S., if this is one of Europe's lawn mower beers, I wouldn't mind getting a grass cutting job in Holland. This beer has a nice light appearance and doesn't have to be chilled with nitrogen to enjoy. The aroma is consistent with most beers that come in a green bottle. Sort of skunky? Although I'm a fan of strong browns, I can get used to the refreshing taste of this brew. Winter or summer, the mouthfeel is clean and drinkability is good. A lot smoother than Heineken, which is more hoppy. I can down a bunch of these, unlike Bud or Coors, and almost never wake up with my head in a vise. This grog is widely available in my area and it's not overly priced making it a good choice to have if the fridge in case your Miller buddies stop over. If you're one of the 'Big Three' drinkers, do us all a favor. Instead of spending your cash on piss water which only funds commercials that jam up the air waves, buy a case of Grolsch.

Once you get past the aroma, this is a pretty good beer.","Morris729","Jan 14, 2003"
3.54,14.2,4,2.5,4,4,3.5,"I've avoided Grolsch for quite some time because popular opinion deems it on par with that other big selling beer from Holland. But this couldn't be further from the truth according to my humble buds. Okay, so the nose is a bit disconcerting, perhaps like washing your socks in stewing wort, but the taste more than makes up for it. Toasty, rounded, fed pickled hops the night through. I couldn't pound a whole lot of these, no, but I wouldn't turn one down either.","inebrius","Dec 19, 2002"
3.38,9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"I love the swing top bottles, except for the fact that they replaced the ceramic part with a plastic part, when I was in college we did some crazy stuff with that ceramic part.

2.88,-7.1,3,2.5,3,3,3,"The sample I tasted was from the large 1.5 liter bottle with the well known swing cap top. Some care must be taken in pouring as there was an abundance of carbonation. The head lasted until the glass was empty. There was a distinct hop bite upfront. The palate was clean with very little mouthfeel. There was a dry finish to the beer with an aftertaste that lasted long after consuming the beer. There was, however, a slight off taste noticed in the finish after consuming about one liter of the brew. To me this beer would be best enjoyed with food that stimulates the tastebuds such as a New York or German hot sausage. It was also a bit pricey for the product received.","mrjimcat","Dec 14, 2002"

1.68,-45.8,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,1,"Poured a dark clear golden color with a white foamy head that disappeared quickly. Aroma was of malt, hops with a slight skunkiness that worsened as the beer warmed. Taste was crisp with a sweet malt front that turned into a sour lemony middle and a finish that was bitter and skunky. I've had this in the past and I don't remember Grolsch being this distasteful. Expiration was marked 07/2003, but this bottle was just plain awful. With so many options out there I don't know if I'd waste my time with this one again.","Winter","Nov 28, 2002"
3.22,3.9,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"I only drank this beer with food. I must admit that it goes great with food. Fine effort by the Dutch but it needs a lot more effort to make it to to the top of Europe list...","ipogios","Nov 16, 2002"
2.28,-26.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,3,"I thought that trying this on-tap would alleviate the symptoms of the green bottles which are the scourge of Eurolagers. Alas this beer is still lackluster, with off flavors like those prevalent in Heineken, Beck's, and Amstel. Thicker than these other huge European beers, it still contains their synthetic, mass-produced waterlike blandness. It really is almost identical to Heineken. If that sounds up your alley, you might as well get a skunked sample in one of those semi-neat swingtop bottles since it tastes like crap on tap anyway.","Thrasher","Nov 05, 2002"
2.62,-15.5,2,2.5,3,2,2.5,"I wasn't even lucky enough to get mine in a cool bottle (but I was lucky not to get a skunked one). Typical Lager attributes. Clear golden color with a white head. Dry flavor with minimal hops.","Dogbrick","Nov 05, 2002"
3.88,25.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Standard capped green bottle - not a flip top. Clear, golden body topped by a frothy white head that has surprisingly good holding power, keeping a solid 1/16"" throughout the glass and leaving some spotty lace. The aroma is mainly of an herbal and earthy hop (not at all skunked) that's reflected in the flavor along with a dryish malt that's well balanced by bitterness. The body is light/medium with a very fine carbonation giving an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. It finishes dry with a gently lingering bitterness, hop flavor and maltiness. I remember this being a popular fad some years ago - I'm guessing because of the flip-top - but it's actually quite nice and highly drinkable although fairly basic. Still, an exceptionally well done beer that ranks with some of the best German lagers.","NeroFiddled","Oct 20, 2002"
3.01,-2.9,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"A clear golden straw color with a thin white head, half way through the glass it was completely gone.  The smell is a bit skunky, however it doesn't taste as bad as it smells.  It goes down pretty good, reminds me a bit of Heineken but tastes a little better.  Overall an average European Lager.","Sheldon","Oct 13, 2002"
3.24,4.5,3.5,2,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear golden color with large white soda-like head with large bubbles.  The smell is the typical skunky (but not skunked) smell of this beer that is so overwhelming, it is hard to smell anything else but maybe some faint hops.  Has a grassy twang type taste that finishes with a dry bitter hop.  Actually not bad.  Has a light to medium bodied mouthfeel and the bitter finish leaves you wanting another swig.  Proost!","BeerAngel","Oct 12, 2002"
3.63,17.1,3.5,3,4,3,4,"Having never tried this beer, I was somewhat impressed.  It has a very clear amber color which reminds me of Ginger Ale.  It pours with a very nice head that slowly fades to nothing.  Fairly fine bubbles give a lightness to the mouthfeel.  This beer is somewhat sweet with hints of some fruit, perhaps its apple I taste.  It also has a slight maltiness as well, with a different and interesting hp flavor on the finish.  Overall, I'm surprised by the disguised sweet flavors, and impressed with this beer.  Not an everyday drinking beer, but definitely a good change of pace.","aaronh","Oct 10, 2002"

The aroma is also very bland with that Holland-ish skunkiness. It does not go down smooth and is not very drinkable. It was gross and I only drank a pint. I do not recomend this beer to anyone.","tang214","Sep 29, 2002"

3.58,15.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I give this beer big appearance points mostly for the bottle, gotta love the flip-top bottle, even if it is green.  The smell was hopped up with very little malt, like most other pilsners, and the taste was more of the same, with a higher malt content than the smell (not by much).  Average mouthfeel, but I think it is a very drinkable beer, if you can find it fresh.","ryanocerus","Sep 07, 2002"

Finish was a bit sour, and lingering. A bit thin and bubbly, not much to note. I think it's better than a heineken and others. They seem to be making a big push in Florida recently, showing up in every grocery store on sale, and new handles in the bars.","StevieW","Aug 19, 2002"

When I saw a single pint bottle with the swing-top in the store, I thought I'd give it another try.  Pours with a dense white head and a burnt golden color.  Has a spicy smell, but seemed to be on the borderline of being skunked.  Somewhat astringent mouthfeel.  Displays shades of sweetness with a crisp hop finish.  After the first sips, I really wasn't enjoying the beer.  However, its qualities sort of grow on you, and by the end of the bottle I admit that it was better than I expected.","Suds","Jun 16, 2002"
