"Overall : Surprisingly good rich flavors, great freshness while being a little dry...really impressed! Love this beer!"
""
""
"This is my favorite beer to have with Thai food. It goes especially well with spicy Thai chilly basil. It certainly beats the usual ""BMC"" offerings as well as the Japanese adjuncts. Nicely balanced between malts and hops, finishes slightly bitter."
""
""
""
"An okay beer but nothing much to make it stand out. Okay look and smell but taste a little too watery for me and not much on mouthfeel. Overall, I would group it with other average beers."
"Somewhat sweet and filmy for such a thin beer. Slightly metallic. Not outright terrible, but nothing redeemable about it either."

"My favorite Asian beer, good taste, got a kick to it, I love it!"
"I was thisrty and I could chose a tick or some wather. I made the wrong choice."
""
"O:  Bad."
""
""
"For being from Thailand it's a very  tasty beer. It's not bad at all no after tastes."
""
""
""
""
"When overseas and parched, this will do the trick. Otherwise, nothing amazing. Thailand is not known for their beer."
""
"This beer wasn't too bad"
""
""
"Singha used to be the main local beer 20 years ago, but now is considered ""premium"" compared to the even cheaper and crappier offerings like Chang and Leo.  It is still not very good, but better than those other ones.  The best Thailand piss beer."
""
""
""
"Thai beer at a Thai restaurant. Not too many other options. It wasn't bad"
""
""
""
""
"Goes perfectly well spice Thai food.  Besides that, it's pretty flavorless.  Refreshing."
""

"Much like a macrobrew, this is a pale gold, clear brew. Grainy with little hop bite. Thin but appropriately so."
"Overall an excellent euro lager that has some real flavor.  I was not expecting such a tasty beer from Thailand."
""

"Overall a not half bad beer, I was pleasantly surprised. Most beers out of Asia tend to be watery and bland, but this beer had a decent flavor and was refreshing. Wouldn't drink everyday but I will definatly pick it up again the next time I go to  BYOB Asian diner"

"Excellent beer brewed under German technology.  Great head smooth lager beer taste.  Tastes best at a beer garden overlooking downtown Bangkok on a typical hot, humid day.  Aroi maak maak. Tried it in Bangkok and other cities in Thailand, best beer in the country with Chang a close second."

"This poured a light amber gold with a fat creamy head of white foam. Clear and had bubbles rising to the top. Lovely presentation. You could call it glorious. The nose is sweetened grain. it has a richness on the nose that is deep. A slight hop herbal grass to sweeten it. It drinks well. Hearty grain, dry and robust with plenty of depth and the hops are accents. They add some sweet herbal grass to the palate for definition and depth. The beer has a medium mouthfeel and is not shy. I would call it forcefull in it's malt stature. The malt is the drink. It's pleasing and leaves with a slight bit of dryness and maybe an earthiness that you could call bitter. This was made by a thai brewer who got his training in Germany and it's evdent in this beer. Tall golden liquid grain with a an enthusiastic and crisp presence."

"Not a bad beer with Thai food but I wouldnâ€™t recommend it with much else."

"The overall rating is quite low. It is not specially tasty, but it is quite easy to drink."
""
""
""

"This is only a slight step above the typical American macro lager. It's high points are how easy drinking it is, and it's a tick from Thailand. But other than that, it's nothing to write home about."

"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a medium straw amber with a thin white head that dissipates to a thin ring around the glass with little lacing. Served in a cold glass at a restaurant and allowed to warm up bit before tasting. Mild aroma of sweet malt and a hint of grassy hops; typical Euro pale / adjunct lager. Flavor follows with mild grainy malt with a hint of biscuit and a light grassy hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied. Quite as expected for a light foreign lager, perhaps with slightly more mildly astringent hop bitterness in the finish than the body can support, but overall a nice neutral accompaniment to my Thai meal, even if not something I would buy as a stand alone ale."

"It pours a super clear light yellow with a small white head and vigorous carbonation. There's a Caro syrup smell all too reminiscent of an Icehouse Lager, with some clean pale malts and a hint of lemon. Tasting it, I get sweet malt, bland soggy grains, and as it warms up, an extremely bitter metallic taste on the back end. It's no wonder they served this in a frozen pint glass. Goes down fizzy with a watery, light body."
""
""
"Enjoy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a mild but pleasant beer. It reminded me of a Budweiser but with actual flavor and not watery. There's a nice, buttery like smoothness to this beer. And obviously it pairs well with spicy Thai food. The next time I'm at a Thai restaurant, I might have to get a bottle or two with my meal."

"Food match: Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian are sure-fire picks. Aside from that BBQ fare is also a great match. One could even see this brew working quite well with sushi."

"Pours a brillinatly clear light golden color with a huge fluffy white head that persists forever. Smells of sweet bready pilsner malt off set with a light amount of spicy hop and a touch of sulfur and mineral water. The flavor is sweet and a hint tart. Light sugary malt sweetness with a hint of earthy spice. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Middle of the road pale lager. not offensive but not particularly complex either."

"One of many (over the years) bottles had at a Thai restaurant. Pours a light straw color, a bit darker than most adjunct lagers (this is all-malt), with a lot of white foam. Aroma of malty bread, some grassy/herbal noble-type hops and a whiff of skunk. Overall this beer is very malty, grainy, and bitter, with just a little residual sweetness. Sourdough malt predominates but there is a little hop spice and a fairly dextrinous body. There is a hint of apple but the finish is dry and bitter. A classic pale Euro lager flavor and much less sweet than most mainstream examples of the style. Fewer flaws as well, although there is a little metal and skunk on the palate. Great with spicy curries and stir fried chilli and basil chicken, and has more character than its countryman Chang."
""
""
""
""
"O- not a bad beer, I was expecting less flavor considering the lackluster appearance and smell. Much better than a lot of the other more well know euro pale lagers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised, especially by the way the bubbles tingle in mouth and on the tongue. Beer is pretty standard otherwise, but would work well with spicy foods in particular."

"I love this beer , the first biggest brewery in Thailand."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer. No other beer in Southeast Asia comes close. Can be consumed warm or ice cold. Prefer ice cold. Heard the original brewers trained under the Guinness Brothers and modeled this beer on Harp, only difference they sourced the ingredients locally in Thailand. Not certain that is true but the beer stands out and I buy it whenever I see it all over the world. In Vietnam, where I live, I gt it delivered 5 cases at a time. It's carried by a single guy on the back of scooter."

"Two finger frothy head on a bright.golden body. Scattered lacing. Aroma is very grainy, with pale malts rice and a hint of sweet corn. Flavor is very clean with more of the same from the aroma with mostly grains and minimal sweet corn. Not too sour although the finish is a bit bitter. Light body and high carbonation, crisp. Standard euro pale lager. No off putting flavors until the finish affecting drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly hazed golden straw in color, fizzy cap of prickly bubbles. Light scent, lingering sweetness with lighty bready and grassy notes. Taste leads with sweet malts, as with the nose, bready malts and lightly grassy and faintly herbal hop notes. Light bodied, bubbly. Decent pale lager with nice flavor and no major faults."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is what it is...a beer with no standout characteristics. It would likely save you if you were dying of dehydration, but it would be difficult to want another of these unless you were actually dying. Very plain."
""
""
""
""
"overall - pleasantly surprised by my first Thai beer."
""

"Enjoyable, even better with SPICY Thai food."
""
""
"Solid and drinkable with good flavors and balance."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and a sugary aroma. Taste is much the same with a slight metallic flavor on the finish. There is a very mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer all around but it's drinkable."
""
""
""

"330ml bottle, contact brewed by Schlossbrauerei in Hallertau, Germany. Poured into Leffe chalice, pale colour, clear, small head which didn't hang around long. Tasted malty, some hop content, could well have been Hallertau as this is where it was brewed. Malt forward taste, on the sweet side but balanced, hint of apple, wheaty finish. Crisp texture, well carbonated, thin body. Overall I'd say this was more a Helles than pale lager. Went down well, quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"I had this easy-drinking lager in a Thai restaurant in Bonn, Germany. Beer has a nice color, but the foam disappears very fast. It's very drinkable, inviting you to go for more. It's a perfect match with spicy Thai food and I would recommend it in such an occasion, but otherwise would go for some German beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I like this beer because of the nostalgic feelings I feel from traveling through Thailand. It is just your standard run-of-the-mill mass produced beers. Sessionable, sure."
""
""
"O - I'll say it is overall average in that you will likely find this in a Thai restaurant and it may be the only interesting beer option. For that it works. But beyond that it is nothing special."
"Boon Rawd.. the first and still the biggest brewey in Thailand. Malty lager herby and golden yellow abv 6% They brew it with german technology.Builded in 1933.I love this beer but it is more expensive than other beers in Thailand. It is worth the extra money."

"There are certainly worse lagers out there, in fact, much worse. This beer has saved me many times while out eating Thai food as it was by far the best beer on the menu. It makes sense for such a purpose as well- a fairly crisp lager with a rounded flavor from all malt, and a snappy finish- you can actually taste the hops! Really not that bad, especially for a Euro style lager. That being said, I won't get carried away either- it still IS a Eurolager- and not all styles should be treated equally. Some are catch-all categories for - average- beer. This one pours golden with a moderate white head that settles to a thin swirl. Smells grainy and full bodied, with sweetness on the finish. Tastes full bodied and grainy and fairly thick, but with a nice crisp finish, while overall evincing some creaminess. It is what it is, but better than most in the style."

"O: Pretty good Thai beer to match with the Thai food I was having. The sweetness of the beer marries nicely with the spice flavors in the food. I thought the beer was really well paired with the food but not sure I would want to have it on it's own."
"O: Pleasing to drink. Nothing special, but an above average beer."
"From a bottle stamped: FILL070511-EXP 070512. Sampled on February 25, 2012. The pour is pale yellow with active carbonation and a small short-lived white head. There are grains and malts on the nose but little else. But that is about average for the style. Thin to medium body. The taste brings out the malty character more but it is also pretty grainy. Some crisp hops fill in the blanks. All I can say is that it is very typical of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprisingly good beer; Iâ€™ll admit that I wasnâ€™t expecting much, but it overachieved. Itâ€™s a nice, simple beer, but well-crafted. Iâ€™d get another one of these from the local beer store, and knock down something nice and salty to go along with it. Until the next time, everyone."
""
""

"Overall very average. often the best choice at the Thai restaurant."

"O: There's nothing overly special about this beer but is not bad considering it is from Southeast Asia and would probably go well with spicy food."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Poured nicely with a medium head which receeded quickly. Very light taste. A quick finish with little after taste."
""
""
"A light malt with a slight sourness to a light dry aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: A lot of sweet malts, some corn, and a pretty decent amount of grassy hop flavor. Sure, there are better beers out there, but I can't think of much that goes better with Thai food."
"Mouth easy but a little too light that passes for a bit of water to take off. The finish is slightly dirty and a touch of grain is not important faigt felt. Well, that business remains strong so no real surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Euro Pale lager, what can I say, but are these ever really interesting, yet I probably would still have it again"
"Feels smooth in mouth with some lively carbonation on the tongue. Probably my favorite Asian style. Way better then other malts such as Kirin or tsingtao. Went well with the Pad Thai."
"Overall - I was surprised by this beer.. I like it a lot."
"O - I was forced to drink this several years ago on a Thai airways flight from cans.. suffice to say it was probably the worst beer I think I'd ever drank. So for this review I used the bottled version.. So my verdict would be that it's better than out of a can. Definitely not as horrid as I remember but scarcely worth a mention."
"O - no rice here, this is quality barley beer and a perfect finish to a long hot day under the blistering sun. i personally prefer a few of the smoother lagers w/ the hint of sweetness that lingers just a bit, but there's no denying this is superior SE Asian brew that also holds its own outside of the region"
"O - Not the worst lager you can get by any means, but that's not saying a lot really."
"My first Thai beer. The alcohol is hidden well. The pour looks like your standard American Lager. The head retains well throughout the session, leaving decent lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell is barley and rice. Taste is pretty good, with the 6% being hidden well. There is no alcohol burn here. Overall, I'll have this again and again. Part of a ""mix your six pack"" at Friar Tuck Beverage."
"O: While it's good to try new things, I find it kind of irritating that beers from exotic countries like Thailand aren't more exotic themselves. Still a decent enough beer."
"RJT"
"one of domestic footballs most advertised beers, one can see why it is easily marketable as well as distributed. refreshing to say the least...or perhaps most."
"O â€“ Introduced to this by a friend and it was better than I had imagined. Very drinkable with good flavor for such a light lager, will be entering my future rotation. 4"
"I am not a lager drinker by any means, but I am thoroughly impressed with Singha. I believe this beer to be perfect on a hot day and one that is extremely sessionable. Medium to light golden in appearance, this lager is darker than most American style lagers. Pour is as you would expect with a good 1-2 finger head. lacing is minimal but apparent. Taste is of slight peach and honey. mouth feel is light-medium, possibly due to the amount of barley used in this brew. A slight sodium-dry finish is felt at the back. All in all this has become one of my favorite lagers, which is a short list. This matches perfectly with Thai food and coconut curry. Try this one FRESH for the best results, you will not be disappointed. Cheers!"
"I like it. I would TOTALLY try this beer again. Actually, I might go order another one. Bottoms up people!"
"Overall I don't know what it is but no matter what country they are from in Asia, all beers of this style taste so similar. This one is a bit better that other I've had though. But it's nothing I'd ever buy regularly. Im just sitting at the bar waiting for my togo Thai food and decided to have and review their Thai beer."
"O - Overall this isnt that bad of a beer. Alot better than I expected to get at a Thai restaurant. Would order this again to go along with some Thai curry."
"Overall: Perfect for an end of the week, smooth summer savoring. It's a really good lager. Crisp and smooth."
"Overall: nice beer, although it could use a stronger hop presence. Worthy a try."
"O: On its own, not all that great. But, when in Rome (Thailand?) do as the Romans (Thai?) do. The lager cut through the fatty, sweet coconut milk of the curry and cooled the spices adequately. I wouldn't get it outside of this environment, but I'd probably get it there again."
"I like Thai food...this is a good beer to be from Thailand....easy to drink and goes well with the curry, satay, peanut sauces and other flavors of it's country. Not a knock it out of the park beer...but like other beers that go great with BBQ and hot food...this one will do just that and not knock you down."
"O: not a bad go-to lager."
"Probably wont go after this again, even though its texture lends itself beautifully to summer drinking. Light and effervescent, it is certainly refreshing, though I would likely just opt for a glass of water instead."
"This is a surprise from southeast Asia. It's got this citrusy sweetness to it that was totally unxpected. I have to admit, I'm somewhat impressed by this euro lager. the head is fluffy and retains well. The nose is subdued, but contains dry powdery grain aromas. the flavor is mellow on the hop side, but it's quite sweet and pleasant for a lager. Very pleasantly surprised by this beer."
"As Lagers go this was up there. I would not hesitate to get this beer again."
"This beer pours a pale golden straw color. Large soda sized carbonation bubbles rise up to a fat fingers worth of pure white head. The head falls rather fast to a skim coating that hardly leaves any lacing. I smell some grass, worcestershire, and a faint light whiff of skunk. It smells like a lager, maybe a European lager, not a good one though. Doesnt taste bad, but its far from great, it is herbal, and grassy. Light body, light carbonation. It feels like it leaves a film behind. I dont like this beer!"
"O: Not sure what I really expected, but this was not something that I would care to drink again."
"Bland but refreshing. The best aspect of this beer is that the flavour is clean - no unpleasant 'off' notes. Otherwise it's a run-of-the-mill lager, nice on a hot day..."
"O - Not bad but definitely not worth picking up. While it's refreshing, it's certainly not as refreshing as the constant ads for it on the back of All About Beer make it out to be. Not that I was expecting it in the least... Average anyway."
"Drinkability: the flavor isn't great, but paired with savory, spicy East Asian or Indian food, this beer might just be spot-on. It's got its flaws, certainly, but it's a relatively quenching beer that I don't hate. Make of that what you will."
"This beer pours out as a clear pale yellow brew with a white head on it that fades within a few minutes. The aromas coming from this beer are mostly grains and some funk. The taste is pretty mild with malts and some hops in the mix. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Overall it's pretty boring to say the least. I wouldn't run out of my way to have this one again."
"Choc-tee! Beertracker"
"It poured a very bright gold. The perfect colour to describe as gold. It wasn't yellow and it wasn't pale. It was GOLD. It also had no head. None to start with whatsoever. It had a unique smell that was hard to place. A slight sweetness that was maybe vaguely fruity, like a pear? Something else was present that I couldn't quite place, sort earthy. The taste was unique. Tasted vaguely of unhopped malt with no corn, which was a refreshing difference from American cheapo beers. It was a bit sweet, but once again, not in a corny way. It's definitely a very watery beer. But also VERY refreshing. This is something I could see myself craving on a hot day. More so than Busch or even Sol. This is TRES SMOOTH. Well designed for the tropics of Thailand. It went well with the very spicy Szechuan sauce I put on my rice, too. This is clearly a cheaply-made beer, but damn it's refreshing."
"O- Not a terrible example of the style. I found it too sweet and too carbonated to be anything resembling a regular purchase, but it goes down easily enough."
"Pours light yellow with a thin white head that faded fast. No major aroma comes out from this beer other than some sweet and yeast/grain notes. Taste is thin, sweeter than expected with a subtle mix of flavor. The mouthfeel was light, somewhat smooth, with nice carbonation. I had this with thai food, and it worked well with the strong thai flavors as a palette cleanser, but not a lot of flavor coming out of this beer."
"As Thai citizen, this is my number one Thai beer. If u have a chance, I recommend this one with Thai food..believe that Singha will not disappointed u."
"I only tasted this beer because my wife had a large bottle with her sushi, but I'd much rather have a German Pilsner with real beer ingredients. This is a mass produced beer made with adjuncts from Thailand, and I could not find anything in taste, or smell that would make me seek it out or purchase it again."
"D: Clearly one of the better Euro pales out there, I'd put this up with classic pilsners, a great match for Thai food I'd imagine."
"Overall-while this had more hype I actually thought Chang was better, simply not a great beer even for a style where being an import and inoffensive usually gets you great hype."
"Containing astonishing refreshing ability, high drinkable beer that is well fit with spicy Thai cuisine."
"Taste is enjoyable and there is more of it than with a typical American counterpart. Think of this as a beer that lovers of this style can enjoy. I will seek this one out if I ever dine at a Thai restaurant."
"Clear golden pour with a frothy white head that doesn't last long. Slightly sweet aroma is mainly of malt but there are some grassy hops as well. Flavour is the same as aroma with added lemon and corn notes. Light, dry mouthfeel with high carbonation and some mild bitterness on the finish. Pretty bland lager but drinkable."
"D: This is pretty basic stuff. It's certainly inoffensive and goes down easy."
"D: Fine, easy going down and relatively light."
"Light bodied with a decent balance of pale malt and crisp, slightly bitter hops. The hops are faint but add a little bit of flavor that is usually missing in these beers. Slight grass and straw notes but unfortunately the grainy notes from the aroma are very apparent. Lots of corn and rice but overall this beer isn't terrible. Cogan brought this to a Thai restaurant and they were a nice compliment to the spicy food."
"D: Nothing is wrong with the beer. Average all around. Standard lager flavors, maybe a bit more bitter than some."
"Light golden with a bleached white head with decent retention. Tons of carbonation. Aroma is sweet with fruit notes. None of the grassy characteristics one would expect from a lager. In this respect it is more ale like. Lots of carbonation, perhaps too much even for the style. Cooked vegetables in the middle followed by an uninteresting bitter finish. Light bodied, dry finish."
"Drinkability: overall a dull lager with little to no refreshing quality."
"D - Very easy to drink and very quaffable with a pretty OK flavor; not bad on the whole (3.5)"
"D: My first Thailand beer.... Not bad... Why too sweet for my taste but worth looking into if you want to try Tai beer."
"(http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/)"
"Pour into a pint glass, very clear golden yellow, with very little foam that is gone within a min. Very little carbonation. No lattice to speak of. Smell of grass. Slight bitter taste with a some what smooth finish. Not a great beer but not horrible."
"The drink on this very is very high. This could be a great session beer. I am very impressed, firstly because I am not always a lager drinker. Secondly, because this is the first Thai beer I have ever had. Its a nice refreshing brew, I will most certainly find this one again."
"D: This is one of those examples of a beer with nothing serioiusly wrong about any one ingredient, but as a whole, just didn't go together well."
"This is one tasty macro lager. It's very easy to drink and would be great on a hot summer day."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed in this beer after reading some good reviews. Its a standard Euro pale lager, nothing special about it. It is at least all malt which is a plus, but everyone of my friends who tried it said it tasted like PBR. I did enjoy it with my Thai food and will probably drink it again with Thai food, but definitely not any other time."
"Drinkability: I'd pass on this one, but if you normally like sake or other Asian-brewed beers, this might be a winner in your book. It certainly isn't in mine."
"Not pleasant, bleh."
"Taste, somewhat refreshing, if only because there isn't much there to pick up on other than water and the slightest hop presence. Nothing real offensive going on here, other than the price for this. Didn't try it with spicy food, but I imagine it would be ok. There's just not a lot to this beer, and yet, the price is as if there was."
"Overall, I found the beer to be just fair, or average."
"Rather easy to drink, nothing unpleasant - or exiting."
"Coming in brown glass at least there's a chance this beer won't be skunked on you. Pours fairly standard look and color and smell for cheap American pilsners. Taste actually wasn't bad, a fairly balanced malt and hops and sweetness. I'd take this over Sapporo or Tsintao."
"Serving type: Can."
"D - Delicious paired with some spicy Pho."
"Golden body, above average carbonation rising from bottom of wine glass, quite thin layer of white head, quick dissipation with o.k. lacing. Sweet malts (or adjuncts?) dominate the nose, little hop presence. The taste is once again quite sweet, hops not noticeable. Average mouthfeel, not bad effervescence. While I won't hesitate to order one of these with lunch at Beervana's favorite Thai restaurant, this isn't something I'll drink at home again."
"The malt flavor and the stellar crispness does what not many lagers can, it harnesses an epic refreshing quality and maximizes drinkability. You don't have to be eating in a Thai restaurant to drink this beer; it's good enough to stand on its own."
"overall i have had worse but it certainly was not worth me tracking down at all."
"Pours a deep golden color, high carbonation but the head fizzles out pretty fast. I was disappointed in the aroma and taste, thought it was surprisingly ""skunky"" and harsh, had maybe a bit of sweet rice flavor but the overall feel was a letdown, especially for the price. Not drinkable for me, I wasn't eager to finish the bottle. I'd drink one if I was given one, but wouldn't order it again."
"The fact that most beers, certainly the most common and nearly all mass-produced ones, resemble this - watery, cheap corn syrup - is probably why most people have to acquire the taste for beer and why many never bother to. I'll admit that it took me some time to stomach lagers like this with comfort and, by the time I could, I had already realized there were much better, much more exciting and enjoyable offerings out there."
"D rink - not a beer I'd have again, better off drinking tsingtao"
"I'd only drink this again if I was in Thailand. ...okay maybe here if in a thai restaurant."
"perhaps a safe alternative to the jungle water but other then that I wouldn't go looking for this one"
"Carbonation is pretty high but at least this dries out the sweet malt well."
"D: It goes easy. A summer beer. Nothing special apart the characteristic perfume"
"Notes: Overall a decent Euro Lager but there are better ones out there for the same money. I think this beer is somewhat overpriced. It isn't as good as the cost would indicate."
"It definitely was crisp, and I am looking forward to a tasty spicy meal to complement it."
"Rather a-one dimensional beer , it wouldn't be bad if it hadn't that unpleasant kind of smell and taste in the background."
"Drinkability is very good. Nothing too exciting, but it's refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall decent for what it is and considerably better than some well known European Pale lagers. May not buy it again soon unless I'm at a Thai resturant but if I was offered this by someone I would certainly accept it. I can see this being effective for cooling down after spicy food."
"D: Nothing objectionable here. A refreshing beer, especially after a day trekking through the sticky heat of Thailand."
"Good finger+ of pure white dimpled foam, holds steady for a decent while before breaking across the surface, thin rivulets of lacing cling here and there. Orange to dark gold color consistent throughout, transparent but not watery, very few bubbles to be seen. Beery nose of barley, lentils, lemon peel, metallic rust, honeyed malts and cane sugar, can be slightly offputting at times. Light-bodied with a weak handshake, tries to slip the churning carbonation in there swiftly to create presence and distract from the presence of diverse flavors. Honey, corn syrup, malted milk balls, rice mask a good deal of the more bitter hops and grassiness. Undistinguished florality fills in some blanks through the finish. No real glaring flaws but pretty gosh darn boring."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Lives up to its style by pouring a very pale straw, like urine when a lot of water has been drunk. The initially strong white frothy head dissipates rather quickly, though stoically, into nothingness. The nose is faint notes of caramel, wheat, and grasses, with a light syrupy sweetness riding cavalier through it all. The taste brings these elements together, toning down the sweetness a bit and ratcheting up a bland grassiness. The body is definitely on the lighter side, with active enough carbonation and a smooth but watery texture. Overall, not that bad a brew, but definitely nothing to write home from Bangkok about."
"D - Easy going beer but very plain and simple."
"Not something I would drink for it's own sake, it did compliment my meal perfectly."
"I approached this beer with very low expectations, and it was actually a little better than I thought. It did have it's off flavors and unpleasantries, but otherwise wasn't too bad. More flavor than I expected."
"Thankfully, the taste is not overly metallic. The grains are slightly husky, sweet and biscuity. Light hopping, but you can tell it is there on the finish. This drinks like a malt liquor more than a Euro Pale Lager. Not bad, and goes well with Thai food although a bit pricey at a restaurant. One of the better EPLs I have had."
"It has great mouthfeel and you can feel the carbonation. The taste is nothing special, but it is easy to drink and goes well with food. I enjoy it more than the average beer and have bought a 6-pack to enjoy at home."
"12 oz brown bottle to glass. Light golden yellow, head fades to almost nothing. Fairly typical lager smell, maybe a bit sweeter. Tastes sweet as well, and a bit of alcohol comes through at times, but not objectionable. Maybe a tad bigger overall flavor than the Sapporo I tried recently. I drank this in a matter of a few minutes, so goes down easy but overall a fairly middle of the road beer."
"Appearance has a light golden yellow color with a thin crisp head. Smell is grainy and hoppy. Taste is a little grainy with a sour note in the back giving way to a little dryness. Mouthfeel is of course light with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it's not a bad beer, but not that good either that I'd buy another."
"Nothing beats a draft Singha during Happy Hour in Phuket. Gret with just about any Thai dish or seafood. Also tried the cans and bottles and they were equally as good. Nice pale golden appearance. This lager has a typical German style taste and seemed pretty consistent from can to draft to bottle. The smell is typical lager and it can definitely be a session beer. Had no problem downing 2-3 on a humid Phuket afternoon."
"D: Not crisp enough to suite me. Bitterness boring, hop character underwhelming. This could have been due to the bottle being a bit past its prime, but this is what the beer has always tasted like to me."
"It has a very medium presence in my mouth. It was light and heavy, without being to much of either. It had a very crisp taste and a smooth style that made its drinkability exceptional."
"I don't think I'd have this a third time, but I bet it would go decent with some Asian food. I doubt I would turn this down if offered it for free, if that helps."
" M- This beer has a light airy mouthfeel with a tight fizz finish. D- The light and crisp beer has a nice soft sweetness to it that the sulfur flavors are muted. There is not much flavor there but what is there is pleasant."
"Singha is a tasty lager, well above the BMC class. I believe this to be the best euro pale lager I have had."
"It's an easy to drink beer. Pleasant enough, though slightly forgettable after the fact."
"While hardly something I'd want to drink much of on its own, this always goes down well enough with spicy East Asian fare, go figure. The brown bottle belies the skank factor inherent in this one, which can only point to a cheaply-made brew in the first place - hello, country tick."
"Overall this beer wasn't bad. On its own it is drinkable, but could shine with the proper accompanying dishes. Quite refreshing on a warm day and has some nice thirst quenching qualities."
"Pours a light pale straw goldenrod sunlight on a Sunday morning color. No head to speak of, very fizzy. Smell is pretty bland, a little rank, pungent, slightly malty and tinny. Taste is bland, boring, watery, thin, unrefined, skunked. Mouthfeel is small and unsubstantial. Drinkability is low because it just feels so wrong to drink this."
"Singha poured from a bottle into a Singha glass. Little to know head, steady carbonation, no lacing, yellow and clear. The beer has almost no aroma and it feels average in the mouth. This is a decent example of an Asian lager, but there isn't really anything sepcial about it. Kind of an average beer. I drink it when I need to cleanse my pallet. If you like Tiger or Tsintao, you may enjoy this, it isn't as dry as those others, its just an average beer."
"Had to fill the mix a six up so went with some mass produced imported beers. Pours a very light golden color with a nice head.. but it quickly goes down to nothing. Has the skunkiness of a german beer a'la Beck's or St. Pauli Girl. Kind of a biting aftertaste to it but taste wise and body wise it's better than most of the other imports I've tried. Good if you want to try a beer from Thailand but that's the only reason I would get it, just a run of the mill import with little no flavor or care in the beer."
"Drinkability - I've tried to drink more than a few at a time, and just couldn't. Heartburn set in and got all bloaty, oh well."
"From a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a tad skunky. Taste is also mild. Crisp with some hoppiness. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Not as good as I remembered it on my travels in Thailand. Overall a pretty average beer."
"Not a bad import lager. Tastes like a lot of other Asian breweries' lagers but not quite as sweet. Nothing special though."
"D: I will say that it was a refreshing break from the spicy Thai food I was eating, but was a bit too flavorless to hold its own without food to accompany it."
"From the can into a Pilsner glass. Golden, light yellow with a thin head. Smell is very lagery...I mean just plain malty with a little lemony hint if you imagine. Tastes plain with a bitter alternate. Feels very watery on the palate. Very drinkable when served ice cold. Singha is the pride of Asia."
"D: Well, I'm rather surprized - I thought a beer from south east of Asia was rather easy to dismiss, but no! This must be one of the best beers from that region."
"This beer pours a clear golden straw color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma almost entirely consists of nothing. There is an extremely faint hint of malt, but that is it. It isn't a bad aroma, it just isn't an aroma. The taste is more of the same. There is a little more malt, but mostly it taste like carbonated water. The mouthfeel is light bodied with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this beer is a bore, and I can't think of much else to say."
"Had my first Thai food experience and I wanted to have a Thai beer to go with it. This was the only Thai beer the restaurant had. And while it is not a bad beer at all, it's just a very typical lager. I could have easily ordered a Budweiser and had the same experience. Because of that there is not much to say other than this beer was slightly sweeter than most AALs."
"Poured into pint glass, which produced a delicate head that quickly faded to half a finger. Smell is of cereal malts, but hints of doughy sweetness have a strange and inviting quality...no real hop aroma. Taste is of sweet toasted malts with a hint of bitterness and no real hop flavor. Quite surprised by the amount of flavor for a macro. Mouthfeel is thin but not bad, a slight oiliness is present. Overall really not too bad. I have a feeling that a fresher sample would be quite nice with spicy foods. Makes you wish some American macro lagers were this drinkable."
"Drinkability- wouldn't usually drink it but will occasionally at the thai restaurant"
"Pretty interesting for a Thai beer!"
"The best of the East Asian lagers."
"Drinkability: Just too sweet; unbalanced"
"This is a lighter beer with a pretty nice, fluffy white head considering the style. Some stale malt characteristics in the nose bring the Adjunct Lager to the forefront. Somewhat sweet with a touch of green citrus. Taste is light, mostly light malt and hay. Still, it could be refreshing after a hot summer day with a semi-crisp finish."
"I don't know that I've ever had beer from Thailand before. I wasn't expecting this to be good beer, but it's flat out bad. I hope some folks over there can brew something better than this, but I'd believe that this is as good as it gets. Thailand doesn't come to mind as a land of brewing trailblazers. This one needs to go back to the drawing board. It needs a ton of work. Can't recommend this one."
"i think this would be very refreshing and drinkable alone on a really hot day. this would have to be ice cold, of course."
"Drinkability is fine what can I say, I'm happy I had a beer with my dinner."
"Singha is nothing necessarily remarkable, but yes, it is definitely drinkable."
"D - I gave it a 5.0 on drinkability, this beer isn't the sum of its parts. It tastes great, the mouthfeel is really good too, and its so easily drinkable with just the right amount of carbonation, pleasing flavors and bite to keep you coming back for more"
"Drinkability: This is one of the better options available in most bars in Thailand. Although there are far superior options available back in the U.S., I am ok having a few of these with some Spicy Pad Thai or Tom Yum."
"Singha has a pale golden straw color. There were many tiny bubbles and head was non existant. Nice artwork on the label. It had a nice hoppy aroma though the smell was somewhat faint. This beer has a nice crisp taste. It is a bit sweet with hints of barley and wheat. You can defiantely taste the happy hops. The brew tingles your tounge on contact and goes down very smooth. I find this beer very drinkable. I first encountred this brew in Hawaii but while in thailand this beer was not consumed as much as chang mainly due to price."
"Had tonite with Thai food. Poured a nice straw yellow color with bright white foam head. Smelled of malt and a little citrus. What a nice clean crisp taste. Full malt and grain flavor with a good amount of sweetness. Obviously matches great with Thai food or other spicy cuisine. Has a hint of a citrus taste, with a that clean malt flavor you expect from the category. VERY very drinkible. These will be good to keep in the fridge for those double-header baseball sessions at home in front of the TV."
"Drinkability- Highly highly drinkable, a great session lager, I have to say I am sometimes hard on the lager style as I prefer ales but this one is good, I find something very unique and refreshing in this one, I'm glad i found this one and I think its one I will be revisiting"
"simply put, this beer is not a good beer. it was not at all easy to drink this along with my sushi."
"Drinking this added another country onto my reviewing profile, Thailand is my 50th now visited on here."
"This beer may be best consumed as an accompaniment to somethng spicy, where its' service is as a coolant."
"Had this lager all over Thailand. It is the beer over there but substandard here. Poured like a Bud Light, yellow, no head, not even fizzy, no nose and no body. Cheap malts and this beer is really not worth a review. Very grainy and lacks hops. Lots of asjunct here and pretty poor on taste and drinkability"
"Oh, BTW, I had this beer in Thailand from a can and it was pretty much exactly the same. When I saw it back here (US), I wanted to try it again and see if it was the same beer. It definitely is. Took me back to Thailand again..."
"D- Easy to drink. I'd have another. Good pairing with Asian food like Pad Thai."
"Overall- I've read that this is actually an all-malt beer. Comparing it to many of the adjunct beers on the market is a little unfair. Singha beats many of these quite easily. Against other all-malt options, it would be a much closer race."
"Drinkability: It'll do. Singha delivers a bit more character than expected, certainly more than rest of the endless parade of sad, vapid lagers out their."
"Pours clear gold with a medium white head. Lagery metallic aroma. Taste was more of the same, yet sweeter and less corny. More of a rice flavor. I had this beer at PF Chang's. It tasted good with the Dan Dan noodles. But when I see it sitting there on the shelf at BevMo, I know it will never make it into my fridge."
" This really does have it's place amoung Restuarants of the Asian variety."
"Taste: The alcohol comes through a little bit. This might just replace Sapporo as my favorite Asian lager."
"This is basically clean, inoffensive and drinkable lager. It certainly doesn't taste like an American macro, it reminds me more of a bland Munich helles lager. There's a very light bready malt note with tinge of hops at the end. Very drinkable, no brewing flaws. Not a lot of flavor, but I'd never turn a free one down."
"Give me anothery!"
"Pours a white head, but is moderately quickly diminishing. Body is very light yellow in color. Not much aroma-slightly sweet malty. Has a bland flavor, and some malty aftertaste. Slightly fizzy palate."
"I'd definately have some more of this 'interesting' asian macro lager."
"D: overall not impressed drinkability wise, a pass, and basically a mindless drink."
"Light body, with lots of carbonation. Not terrible, if cold."
"D- Keeping in mind the style, this is a very good beer. It's my first Asian beer, but when comparing with any of the American and Mexican macros and even a lot of the Europeans, this is top class. I don't know if I'd call it a session beer, but definitely a great beer to go along with a pizza, burger, or some other food. This might become a new tailgating beer for me."
"Smell is of malts (sort of sweet smelling), sort of subdued. Taste subtle as well. Not bad, actually, quite palatable for this style. Decent mouth feel, bubbles have a ""club soda"" feeling, and finish rather smoothly with little after taste. I'd drink this again, but I think it would have to be with a nice spicy Thai meal."
"A classic sampled on tap at (of course) a Thai restaurant in southern Vermont. Poured a clear, golden color with a pillowy, white head two fingers thick. Moderate retention and good lacing. Aromas of yeast, hops and some sweet malts. The flavors are very typical of an Asiatic lager, sweetbread malts, general grains as per a macro brewery and a bright hop finish. Very crisp! Balanced but lacking depth making it a good food beer. Medium carbonation and light body. Beautifully counterpoints spicy food, especially something with a little sweetness like Thai or Chipotle sauce."
"Easy to drink, this beer is my Asian lager of choice. It goes very well with Thai food, spicy or otherwise."
"Well I can now say I've tried ""The Original Thai Beer."" That and I can cross off another country in which I've tried a beer. As for the beer, it's pretty bad. Looks and tastes like cheap swill. Golden colored, not much head or lacing. Some sweet malts but mainly it's got a skunky, corn, grainy taste. Going down it's bearable but the aftertaste is terrible."
"This beer isn't bad, just not good, a little watered down."
"Pours a light straw color with a bubbly white head that hung around for a while leaving no lacing. The smell is fairly skunky with everything you'd expect in a macro lager - light malts and some grain. The taste was slighter better for me with a slight sweetness on top of the typical grain and malt macro taste. Mouthfeel was light and fairly thin. This one actually wasn't too bad with my Thai meal and drinkability was pretty good. Not sure if I'd order it again though."
"D - It is not undrinkable, but it isn't the smoothest beer to drink."
"This is hot day knock em down beer. Worked well with the Thai food I was eating, but wouldn't buy a 6 pack of this stuff."
"This one isn't anything special. Clear, yellow, little head, mild scent/flavor. But it is good very cold, it's refreshing and I didn't taste the usual mass-brewed taste of so many similar beers. It's no great shakes, but if you need an ""exotic"" beer to make you feel cultured, this one is ok."
"Well I took a chance and tried this beer, it wasn't the highlight of my night thats for sure. It was everything beer shouldn't be to me. I could only smell alcohol on the smell, the appearance was decent. The taste brought me back to when I was 14 years old drinking Old English 40's behind 7-11. Yeck. It did not have a nice mouthfeel and the drinkablilty was nearly impossible for me. Unfortunately I was unable to finish this beer and had to dispose of it, maybe the fishies will enjoy it."
"I don't usually go with Asian Lagers, but I picked up a special Filipino treat today called Balut, which apparently goes quite well with beer. Poured in to my new Bar Harbor Brewing Pils glass a clear golden color, with a decent enough white heading...looks just like your run of the mill golden Lager. Not a whole lot going on in the smell, biscuit, bread dough, fresh grain, bit of hop...very raw smelling. Taste is dry, and fairly complex, with many of those smells coming through even more so in the taste. Body is light, nicely carbonated, and perfect as a session beer. This goes down as one of the more refreshing beers I have sampled in a while. I will visit it again when I am looking for something light and simple. Now lets see if it goes well enough with the little bird. Cheers"
"Mouthfeel is thin with good carbonation, and the beer is resultantly very, very easy to drink."
"Nothing special..."
"A great beer to have with Thai food. Or anything spicy really... it's just because it's so strong I wouldn't drink more that 2 at one session because it'll knock you down if you have more than that."
"Pours clear light gold with a filmy lasting white head. Smell is sweet honey like malt. Taste is quite sweet with no ""strong hop characters"" as the bottle states. No balance or hops at all in the flavor and just a big malty sweet bubbly bit o water. Not great. In fact, pretty bad."
"Over the years I have been drinking this beer with my Thai food so I thought I would review. Golden lager color with white foam that recedes to nothing. A fresh unassuming malt aroma. There is a pleasant crispness to this beer and a nice fresh taste, a nice touch of hops, makes it wuite refreshing with spicy food. Certainly better than many Asian macrolagers, IMO."
"This is a good example of the style and I see no problems having it again."
"This is one of the best in the category, and it can be found cheaper in bombers than the usual imports, although this bomber is only 21.3 ounces (versus 24). This warrants a try."
"Something about the phrase ""American macro lager"" already lowers a good beer aficionado's expectations. Never the less I had to give this one a try. Served it well chilled in a pilsner glass. Poured a lucid canary yellow with a mild head. Smell was faint but I could barely pick up some grassy hops and a little malt. Taste was pretty balanced with some spicy hops and faint malt, a little light on the palate with a crisp finish. It may go pretty well with some spicey Thai food but I think something sweeter would be better."
"The taste is similar and strong, flowery, fruity, with grain and clear but smooth alcoholic warmth, and a spicey-bitterness in the finish."
"12 ounce bottle. Beer is a very pale golden color with a slightly sticky head. Pale malt notes in the aroma, but there was also some metallic whiffs that I found somewhat off putting. Carbonated on the palate, which helps with the spicy Thai food. Taste is fairly standard for the style--sweet malt and graininess. Hint of hops at the end. OK with Thai food, but not a session beer."
"Served really cold, which I think is the way to drink this one. Not as bitter in the grainy malt as I expected, and actually not a terrible brew to throw down with some extremely spicy Thai food. Looks like you'd expect, almost like beer-flavored sparkling booze. Eh, it's nothing, really."
"Drinkability: A fun change."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Pale lager, made by Boon Rad brewery"
"Had dinner this past Friday at a Cambodian/Thai restaurant in Allston, so I thought I'd grab a beer to match the cuisine. Poured into a cool looking Chang beer glass. The color was pale yellow. Moderate head with abundant amounts of carbonation. The smell was average, very faint like most macros. Taste-wise, it was boring. A plain old lager in a fancy different bottle. Only ordered it to match the fact I was eating Asian food, so mission accomplished. It was worth one and done, that's about it."
"D - This is one of those beers that most people would be able to drink several of. For me the beer came across as about average. Thus, I probably will not be seeking it out again."
"The carbonation was great for a lager, enough to make it refreshing, but it didn't distract from the taste."
"D - I could have a few no problem. I would need to try one purchased in the states to compare but I personally felt this was much better than the C grade it received."
"Drank a lot of this beer on a recent trip to Thailand.. it was ok, not great. The mouthfeel and the sppearance was average. I did notice a definite difference when I poured the beer into a glass (as opposed to drinking it from the bottle) and let it warm. A really nice caramel flavor came out and made it much more drinkable."
"Overall an okay brew but nothing singularly fantastic about it. I enjoyed it with some spicy Chinese food and it complimented the meal nicely."
"Try it if you're feeling adventurous or while eating Thai food. Otherwise, don't bother."
"Overall, not a particularly drinkable beer. Much too thin and lacking a lot in the flavor department."
"D- Average, but its always proper to try a new beer especially when dining on the country`s cuisine."
"Drinkable?: yes of course. For the style it is a touch hop bitter. But in a good way."
"Mouthfeel is just the slightest touch syrupy, but otherwise light and crisp with lots of carbonation. The butter and cloves only emerge after a closer inspection. Overall very easy to drink. Simple and clean, everything you would expect from an asian pale lager. Honestly I don't really like pale lagers but this one is drinkable by my standards."
"No surprise on the pour. Crystal clear with a small white head that quickly dies down. Nose seems slightly nutty. Flavor is slightly sweet, with that touch of nut that just shows up a very small bit. I also got what I thought was just a hint of apple that showed up and left in a flash. The feel is surprisingly high on smooth bubbles. Much more than I would have expected. Drinkability? Absolutely. There is by no means a lack of flavor and it is quite smooth. The semi-sweet tone might turn some off, but this is worth having once or more."
"Tried it with Thai food at a Thai restaurant on Christmas Day, it poured out the standard straw colored lager with tons of carbonation, although it did have some great head to it. Nice crisp and clean malty scent, with a nice clean taste. Went down fine and I would try it again, but probably only with Thai at a restaurant. Just a nice decent macro lager."
"d - ate this w/ some sushi and it's a good beer to pair with."
"An average version of this style. It's nothing special except that I'm always looking for opportunities to try beer from other countries (other than Germany, Belgium and the UK) and even if they're bland, oh well."
"This is a pretty simple beer, but really not unpleasant, there are certainly worse drinks to sip on while enjoying a meal. Singha is light, crisp and good for a macro offering."
"Poured a clear golden color with a decent white head that lasted a while. Aroma is typical American macro-brew, nothing really that discernible. Taste is malty, but not much in the way of a hop character to it. Mouthfeel is okay and beer is pretty smooth. Drinkability is fairly high, as there is nothing really offensive about it. Not an abundance of taste or aroma, just your typical lager and nothing else."
"The classic Thai beer despite the recent upsurge of Chang. The name and mascot pictured on the label-- the Singha-- is a mythical lion believed to inhabit the forest surrounding the home of the gods, Mt. Meru. It is often served with ice at bars and restaurants, contributing a-- you guessed it-- significantly more watery taste. However the ice is often necessary to keep the temp down when drinking outside and helps to cover up some of the less desirable flavors-- fine, all flavor. All the same I prefer mine without ice. Decent as far as macro lagers go."
"Drinkability: Good when very cold on a Thai afternoon. Some bars in Bangkok will serve it over ice to maintain optimal temperature."
"Drinkability- An ok beer to sit back and enjoy with a spicy Thai meal, not one of my favorites though."
"D - Not bad. I would definitely have this again if I saw it at a Thai restaurant and I think that it would complement spicy food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to bring any of this oddball brew home."
"Would probably make a great palate cleanser for most Asian dishes. I'd pick this up in a restaurant. Far from good, but certainly an adequate brew for the proper occasion."
"Pours pale clear straw with a decent head. Smell is grassy hops. Some sweetness in the backround. Fairly typical macro aroma. Taste is sweet with grassy herbal hops. Actually surprised at the hop presense here. I mean there aren't a ton of hops but quite a bit for the style. Pleasant bitterness. Balanced. Light to medium mouthfeel. Well-carbonated. I actually wouldn't mind drinking several of these. Would be nice with spicy food. Overall, for the style, this is quite nice surprisingly."
"Lightness in body, and faint in flavor. But, am I holding my breath for a Thai barleywine, or chocolate stout? No, sir, ree...this must go excellently well in the heat, and the alcohol makes it's presence known before too long,...excessive imbibement can bring on some crazy Bangkok nights."
"I was prepared to hate this beer, but to be honest it's not bad for what it is. It goes down smoothly, has an enjoyable sweetness, and doesn't leave a skunky aftertaste in the mouth. Now, of course it has its limitations, but it's better than I was expecting. As it says under the score, this one is worth a try."
"I tried this beer on September 14, 2007 at 'The Beer Bistro' in Toronto. The beer poured a dark translucent gold with a light whit head. The aroma was slightly malty with a whole lot of grain. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with mild carbonation. The flavour was very grassy. Not a beer I will buy any time soon (if ever again) but it does knock another country off my beer passport"
"Pours the typical pale golden straw color as many other Asian and Latin American lagers. Keeps a thin lace of head atop the beer. Smells of pale malts with a hint of cooked vegetables and a touch of tea hops. Some bread and honey are in the background. Taste reminds me a lot of Heineken: pale malts and faint adjunct graininess. This one, though, has a bit more of a nice, bittering hop kick and a welcome alcohol warmth from the 6%. Mouthfeel is prickly but rather substantial in weight. I'm actually impressed with this. I see this falling more in line with the ""Euro pale lagers"" (or however you want to deal with the arbitrary pale lager style guidelines) rather than ""American adjunct lager"". This beer is going extremely well with some lamb and lentil soup I cooked up."
"D - Meh. Well, I guess I would pick this over a Bud, but that is about it. And only if I was in Thailand."
"Similar to other SE Asian lagers, but with a bit more alcohol. Pours clear yellow with a small white head. Nose is as expected, but maybe with a tiny bit of sweet fruit. taste is metallic, grainy, yeasty, with some alcohol and slight hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability both poor to ok."
"A row of 2s."
"This beer poured a pale golden straw color with a foamy bright white head that disappeared quick and left just a little lace on the glass. It had a sweet grain smell it a little bit of a flowerily perfume to it. There was also a little bit of a carbonation aroma at first. The beer had a malty sweetness and a grainy flavor. It had a little bit of a hops bite but over all a very crisp flavor that finishes fairly clean. It has a light, smooth, crisp feel that in the end is very refreshing. All in all I would say there wasnÂ’t any thing too surprising with this beer it was done well for your typical lager with nothing to great to speak of."
"***Edit...found out through the BA mag that it is made with 100% barley malt with no adjuncts which is a plus in my book****"
"My girlfriend picked up a six pack for me. Nice of her but the beer is not anything special. Pretty much your typical macro with a bit more flavour and a higher abv. Clear golden colour one of the most transparent beers I have ever seen. The nose is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol and slight skunky notes.. Pretty much tastes like it smells. Well I am glad she didnt buy a 12. But I can stomach a 6 or leave them for my friends who don't really care what they drink."
"Good session beer if the local mini-mart is out of Budweiser (ha!)."
"Overall, I would certainly choose this over most American macros in the summer..if anything just to change things up a bit. Worth a try if you've never had it."
"D- not a bad beer for what it is, i guess it would be a good beer to get drunk off of with 6.0 and pretty much goes down like water."
"Clear straw color slightly murky. leaves a while head that sticks around for a bit. smells of floral hops. taste hoppy and bitter not to my liking. Drinkability- decent when served REALLY cold on a hot day. leave this on the shelf."
"Flavor is slightly sweet with a mild spicyness and a crisp finish."
"Not perfect, but very crisp, refreshing, and gets the job done with spicy food."
"From another website explaining the formaldehyde rumor - ""strongly suspect that the originators of the story were -- and remain -- American and British expatriates and soldiers trying to explain what was to them an odd phenomenon. Singha, you see, is not just another Â‘international lager.Â’ It is a relatively strong 6% alcohol by volume, and is an exceptionally bitter lager, at 40 International Bittering Units (by comparison, Budweiser is about 5% ABV and around 11.5 IBU)."" = Myth Busted."
"A light golden look, with a fizzy head that dissapeared quicklys. Not a distinct smell, just somewhat hoppy. The taste is overall unimpressive, dominated by malt, and leaves a dry, slightly bitter, slightly hoppy aftertaste. I have had this beer several times, and its taste can improve depending on what you eat with it. If you have a sweet Thai dish, don't drink this beer. If you have a spicy Thai dish, this beer can provide a decent compliment."
"there is a rumour going round about formaldehyde being used in some of the asian brews ... not sure what to think about it ... has anyone got any inside infos?"
"Bottle says fill date of 08/23/06, expiration date of 08/23/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear golden yellow with pretty much no head at all. The aroma is just malt and grain, nothing else that I can tell. Taste is sweet malt and grain, but it's not offensive. There's a little bit of hops in the aftertaste, but there's not much bitterness in the finish. Supposedly it's 6% ABV, but you can't tell that at all. Mouthfeel is light, and it's a bit watery. Drinkability is OK, it's doesn't go down bad at all, and it's relatively easy to drink. Not much to distinguish this from most typical macro lagers, but at least it's not awful. Luckily I just bought a single bottle of this, I don't think I'll seek this out in the future."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a frothy thin white head - nose of hay , straw , cereal , milk , and slight hopps Â– taste of malt , wet hay , straw , and acidic Â– body is acidic , and textured Â– aftertaste of sweetened malt , and vanilla extract Â– lingering"
"A typical lager. Nothing spectacular, but it is certainly more palatable than some beers (maybe I should say alleged beers) I have consumed. Appearance and smell are OK. Taste is crisp and not complex, and there is no bitterness, but it has no interesting undertones or hints. A good beer for when you are watching a game or at a party. Worth a try."
"Pretty basic macro-lager. No off flavors, with some malt and hops. Well balanced, a touch of bitterness in the finish. Appropriate body and carbonation. Smooth, with a crisp and dry finish. No complaints."
"It goes down easily, I'll say that for it. This was fantastic sitting on the beach and looking over Phang Nga bay. As a beer to appreciate though, it's pretty woeful."
"A big flavorful lager. Not as crisp/dry/refreshing as most examples, but the body and flavor make it a nice beer. Maybe just not a refreshing ""lawnmower"" beer."
"Notes: I could see this being better with some food. As a stand alone it is not good and not worth another purchase."
"Due to the freshness, this could be a decent session beer as this 22oz bottle had a fill of Aug. 17th 2006, just 10 days old! Why can't they make an Imperial version? After just 2 days in Asia, I would do anything for an Ale, Porter, or Stout."
"This is a good solid lager, which is a perfect compliment to Thai food, and is generally available at Thai restaurants. Pour pale gold with almost no head retention. The smell is fairly typical with a bit of a hoppiness to it, and the taste is bitter bit balances well, particularly with a spicy curry. Well carbonated and good well with the meal but not likely more than a couple bottles."
"Taste was good, much more hop bitterness than the aroma would let on. Lots of bubbles in the mouth from the carbonation. Good with food, not really something I would want to pound all night."
"You won't go wrong with this beer from Thailand."
"An ok beer but nothing special"
"Pours a clear straw color with a nice head and displays good carbonation. The large bubbles turn to a frothy goodness. Nose displays faint hops with the malt being most evident. Has a well-balanced malty taste with a ltttle alcohol bite on the finish. Feels light to medium bodied and is quite enjoyable."
"D: The taste is quite different but enjoyable, easy to drink, not very filling."
"Would definitely not buy this one for consumption on its own but it's a great beer for pairing with something spicy which brings out more of the malts and allows the food to take center stage."
"Finish fairly cripsly, without cloying. And matches the spice of Thai food perfectly."
"Had this beer with some sizzling beef at one of my favortie Thai resturaunts. Poured into the standard food establishment mug. It had a golden yellow color. The nose was cereally and slightly malty. The taste left much to be desired, but was refreshing with a spicy thai meal."
"Drinks pretty easy, especially in hot humid weather. This is beer is fairly consistent be it in Thailand or abroad, never was wowed by this, but a nice thirst quencher or acompanyment to some seafood curry or padthai"
"Overall, it was better than I expected for the style [which is not one I generally like]. Nothing offensive in this beer. Just a basic macro lager, but better than many macros."
"M&D: the carbonation is well-controlled, not as fizzy on the palate as it looks, while the clean palate and no presence of undesirable sugary taste make this 6%abv. lager pretty drinkable. All in all, this is a medium-bodied beer without impressive elements of a really good lager, but is well-balanced and void of any unwanted taste of chemicals and adjuncts--an ""honest""-tasting beer, so to speak. Not something I'd feel like revisiting any time soon, though."
"I discovered this beer on a recent trip to Thailand; and feel in love with it! I think it has been unfairly treated by some of the reviewers, after all, itÂ’s an adjunct larger brewed for drinkers working and living in a tropical climates. Singha dumps all over boring euro pilsners and it also has far more flavour, whilst being just as refreshing, as many other Asian beers. This is a very good example of a light adjunct larger!"
"I get this at my favorite thai place where the choices are this or Miller products. It's better than any Miller product which is saying very little. Bland, inoffensive, thin lots of carbonation. Ok foe washing down spicy food but basically after a bite of Thai curry you can't taste it anyway. I've always felt that strong, bitter beers go better with spicy food but it sems every country known for spicy food brews weak beer. Go figure."
"11.2 oz serving. Not a bad lager really ,to look at light golden , attractive carbonation rising to a quite nice looking thick white head. Aroma is mainlly malty..no chemicals detected. A mainlly malt driven lager and really its quite pleasant actually, slightly grassy, touch of citric to finish. Not that bad on the palate ok beer. All in all much better than I was expecting..this reminds me of BeckÂ’s a lot, not all that bad."
"I had this with some very good (and very spicy) Thai food on a hot summer day, so I was unable to rate it as thoroughly as if I had just been taste testing. However, it had a good appearance, yellow, with pillowy white head, and decent lacing. The aroma was very difficult to dtermine, and the taste was basically what I needed at the time...cold and wet. Not a bad beer all and all."
"Poured out of a 11.2oz bottle into a pilsner glass. I found this at my local World Market store and thought I'd give it a try. Poured with a nice head that quickly dissapates, althoug some lacing sticks quite well to the glass. I thought the beer was to close to a bud light though, but holds its own as well. Will definately go well with spicy food or is a beer that you could drink a lot of just beware of the alcohol content. Sweet with a bitter slightly hoppy taste at the end. A good but not great beer."
"While fairly smooth, it's a mediocre brew at best, even for the style. It won't interfere with spicy foods, which it is good enough to down with, but nothing much to have on its own, as it is thin and lacks any character."
"D Â– Above average for a macro lager"
"D - It is a pretty good Asian lager. Next time I'm at my local Thai place for dinner I might have one. It might be a nice compliment to the spice food."
"A very nice Asian lager. Enjoyable and few complaints. Most of these Asian lagers I would drink in a restaurant but never buy to bring home. Singha is an exception. It goes well with spicy Thai food and I'm sure it would go well with other spicy dishes as well. Not manditory, but worth a try."
"Singha pours a yellow color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I can smell corn in the aroma. Tastes okay for a macro lager, a little sweetness, some grain. Crisp finish. I've had worse lagers. I wouldn't turn one down, on the other hand, not worth seeking out."
"This beer is overpriced though. For the 25-30 dollars I'd have to plunk down for this, I could easily get a case of superior tasting lager, ale, or porter."
"Pours out a super pale, almost clear, yellow. It's like adding a drop of yellow food coloring to a pint of water. The white head disappeared very quickly. Smelled lightly of corn, but it was very light. Not much in the taste. It's very smooth on the tongue. There might be a bit of a rice flavor in there. It wasn't bad at first. I was enjoying the smoothness of the feel and taste, but then as it warmed the alcohol became apparent and that ruined whatever enjoyment I'd found. Very thin mouthfeel. Except for the alcohol disturbance, this is averagely drinkable."
"Certianly a classic option whenever I eat Thai food or any Asian dishes for that matter. The 6.0% ABV is a bonus with such an easy drinking brew. I think this is one of the better imported beers for the style."
"I have had worse beers, but this is certainly not a pricewinner."
"An interesting beer. Not as bland as could be expected from a mass-production Asiatic lager."
"This beer wasnÂ’t a bad pair for the Thai food I hadÂ…after the spiciness it was cool and refreshing. That said it is not something I could drink on its own as it is so boring."
"Eric"
"The pour gave a very thin head that got even thinner, and quick. Was a golden yellow color, typical of the style. Smelled of faint malts, somewhat corny and sweet. The flavor was almost non-existent. The only thing going for it is a pleasant malty sweetness, but otherwise it lacks any discernable traits. Disappointingly boring and bland. Felt springy and buoyant in the mouth, but unfortunately there was nothing backing it up. Certainly not the worst beer ever, but so non-descript I actually wished I'd ordered a soda instead."
"Overall: OK, aroma is slightly objectionable, but not excessively so Â– doesn't make it undrinkable. Even still, it doesn't do that much positive, except for the dry bitter finish that is typical of some German style pils. Even though it is 6% ABV, the alcohol is not readily apparent."
"This beer is crisp and feels average for a macro lager on the palate. There isn't anything outstanding about the way it feels, the carbonation levels are typical for this style, usually being fizzier than most other beer styles. Leaves a bit of what I would refer to as a slick sheen on my tongue that quickly is removed with one or two swallows of saliva. This beer is easy to drink, as a matter of fact I probably prefer it over all other macro lagers, however, why would I want to spend money agian on this brew? Dropping 5-7 dollars for a six pack of this isn't worth it. Sure it tastes alright and is probably one of the best macros I've had to date, but if I want to spend 5-7 dollars on beer I want something that has more flavor."
"First taste is as expected, but possibly worse. Alcoholic bite, a brash and unpleasant acidity that isn't citrusy or anything, just sourness. Oh yeah, and those cheap malts I was telling you about. This is a poorly constructed lager and greatly offends my tastebuds. Perhaps my stomach as well, since I can feel the beginning of heartburn. Too carbonated and sticky as well. Not even recommended as a patio beer. Certainly not recommended by me."
"D: Not very drinkable, slightly unpleasant."
"Light in body with a fizzy tang, turns watery, mouthefeel. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, but the overall flavor gets a bit tiresome, as most lagers do for me. Pretty ok as far as Macro Lagers go."
"Overall: Really wasn't taken aback until the taste. Just can't bring myself to drink another one."
"Attractive 11.2 fl.oz brown bottle pours pale yellow with a tall fizzy head that pushes to the brim of the Paulaner 0.5L Weitbier glass. Little aroma from hops or grain. Low bitterness, thin malts, and light body. Slightly tart finish. A typical American Macro Lager with a ""fill"" date 11 23 05 from the shelves of World Market near Scott AFB."
"Imbibed at what I believe is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, located in Shadyside My Thai is off the hook when eating some Pad Kee Mow or Pad Thai you have to have a crisp tasty beer to cool down the fire. Singha Thai beer is just that appears a golden clear hue with forms a nice sized bright white head leaves behind fine vibrant lacing. Aroma comes off as German in origin with a grassy herbal hop character sweet lightly toasted 2 row malts and maybe a touch adjuncts in probably rice I'm guessing, along with this I'm getting a spice sweet ginger tone that's just barely noticable but present. Anyway much freakin' better than the ""typical"" asian macro, the taste is clean flavored crisp lager one gives the balance of light sweetness and herbal hop flavor with low bitterness but mixes well and complements the food so well. Mouthfeel is clean crisp light body with crisp even carbonation very nice. Drinkability, definitely a beer I'll continue to imbibe on when eating Thai really helps to douse the addicting fire of their dishes, oh and after the beer and food don't forget your mango with sticky rice...good stuff."
"This one was really light and easy to drink, but I wasnÂ’t in too much of a hurry to finish it."
"Mouthfeel is thin. That said, I bet this would be great for washing down some spicy Thai food when you don't care what your beer tastes like."
"D - Well.... it's a macro. But deceptively good, given the initial touch of skunk. I've had far worse for sure."
"Overall: A decent lager but hardly worth the price of a Â“premiumÂ” beer."
"Like a Bud for the Orient, this beer has a very weak nose and a sweet taste too it with a slightly hoppy bitter aftertaste. It has a very light mouthfeel and very is easy to drink (a lot). As others have mentioned it's a good brew to pair with spicy foods; i.e. great for putting out ""papaya salad"" and ""pork salad"" fires, but not much else. If you're at a Thai restaurant pick up one of these to impress your cute waitress, but if you're at the beer store keep walking."
"Was at a Thai restaurant so I figured why not. 12 oz. served chilled in the enlarged flute they gave me. Looks about like what I was expecting - golden with a small white head and average carbonation. Smells pretty clean with some grassiness and some green apples/grapes. Doesn't taste quite as good but still tolerable, with a light mouthfeel and I'd say it's pretty drinkable. I probably paid too much for it but ah well, that's how it goes when you eat out. Overall, not a great beer, but not a bad beer."
"Body is very light, with spritzy carbonation and a somewhat chalky mouthfeel. Don't bother."
"There is a crisp taste that is pleasant... a touch of hop bitterness on the swallow."
"Beware of the 6.0% alcohol- it certainly isn't present in the taste- it'll catch up with you pretty fast."
"Okay I need to write this quickly before my f-ing laptop freezes again (this is also a test run). The pour is clear and a gold color that is lighter then, say, the 49er's helmets, but darker and much more beer like then anything from BMC. I'm getting a mild grassy hop aroma. It's reminiscent of a pilsner, just softer. The taste is clean and crisp with a noticeable hop character. This can wash down any type of food and do so with a satisfying flavor that I didn't expect from a macro lager."
"Drinkable and refreshing ice cold and does work well with spicy food."
"Pours light straw colored, no head, moderate carbonation. Smells of wheats, light hops, and a bit of skunk. Smell is stronger (not as good as) Heineken. Taste is also Heinekenish, but more bitter and lighter. Also, the finish is not as clean. It wasn't all that great. I think if I had had a spicier dish it would have gone better. But, as I went with a milder entree this time, the beer's subpar quality was more pronounced (if that makes any sense :))."
" I almost always have one at a Thai restaurant but wouldn't go out of my way otherwise."
"For an imported beer I bought it cheaply , however not cheap enough to buy again"
"The smell and taste is upfront grainy, with some cooked scents but not objectionable. It's sweet but a balancing dry feeling from the alcohol and hops. A nice level of hops through the drink and then a lingering bitterness. Not as watery as I had expected, it has a nice body for a pale lager. A pleasent surpise to have with my Pad Thai."
"I guess this is about what you'd expect from the style. But itÂ’s better than the likes of Bud or Miller Lite, and better than some of what Mexico and Japan offer too. IÂ’d probably order it when eating at a Thai restaurant. Drinkability is decent, as I had no trouble finishing this."
"A golden color with excellent carbonation and very little head. I smell malt and some light hoppy texture. Not a complex beer, but not bad either. I enjoyed this with some Asian cuisine and it went well. This brew is refreshing and quiet so as not to disturb the tastebuds. There isn't much going on here, but what is there isn't offensive or harsh. Overall, I enjoyed this with my food, but it is on the bland side without a lot to offer. I will have this again, but it is not a favorite nor is it something I will want often."
"Had this a Thai restaraunt, it was this or BMC. Poured a clear pale straw tellow with a finger of white fizzy head that actually stuck around for 30 seconds or so. Nose is faint, a clean light malt, a bit of grassiness. Taste was a grainy malt with a slightly spicey hop finish. Nothing really great, simple, but more flavorful than most macros I've had, and didn't taste nasty as it warmed up. Med/thin mouthfeel, high carbonation. This is an above average macro, went pretty well with my mildly spicey Thai, and I will get this again next time I eat out here."
"A good brew for the region. Borrows some characteristics for Bohemian Pilsners. Brigh gold in appearance, accessive carbonation, good head retention. Smells moderately malty, hoppy, and a little sourness (skunk). Tastes nicely malty and grainy. Hops bring out a 'bite' and some spiciness. Skunkiness fades after a minute or two. Moderate to light body. Finishes clean and mildly alcoholic."
"Golden yellow pour with a small disappating head. Mild to medium hop aroma but there's definitely something funky going on here. Bitter taste and almost tastes slightly skunky, yet it's nothing so harsh that you can't drink the beer. Oily mouthfeel with a bit of a bitter aftetaste. I could drink a couple of these if I had to, but I would much rather prefer something else. Interesting beer though, definitely like nothing I've tasted before."
"Not the best taste, but quite good for a macro at 5.9%. Actually, that isn't saying much. Kind of harsh and burny on the tongue, tastes like it would get gross fast, though really cold it would be OK on a hot Thai evening. The more I drink, the more I lower my score for flavour. Rough and unpleasant mouthfeel, and abysmal drinkability: I would not want to be drinking this all night. Overall, quite a bad beer."
"This beer is what it is. Nothing special, but not bad either. The aftertaste is a bit of a downer and the aroma isn't very enticing, but all in all it's alright. I won't rush out to buy another, but wouldn't turn one down either."
"I swear when I drank this that it was in a 1 liter bottle and it seemed like it was 10% ABV, but that might have just been the feel do to the fact of the 20 hours in airports or airplanes. It was a smooth refreshing beer with not a whole lot of flavor or originality. Light color, light head, light hops, light flavor. The malt and bitterness gives it a slightly refreshing welcome to Thailand, pretend you in Europe feel."
"Pours a thin straw color with no head at all. Smells of nothing at all. Luckily ( or unluckily) it has some flavor. Tastes very sweet, but not malty at all, a little bitter, but no hop flavor at all. I wonder if they brewed this entirely with adjuncts and concentrated hop oil. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, but not too good either. Just a lot of carbonation, and some heaviness.. All in all, it's fairly drinkable, simply because it doesn't have any bad flavors. I probably won't bother getting it again, since I can get bland flavorless beer for much cheaper than $3.50/bottle."
"A pretty solid standard macro lager from Thailand, pairs well with spicier foods."
"A good lager with more flavour than I had expected, and it works very well with spicy food."
"Bottle: Poured a gold color lager with some great carbonation resulting in a medium head with standard retention. Aroma is quite weak with some malt and light alcoholic side to it. Malty taste with some hops and some subtle floral notes. Light alcohol burn made this a little less unpleasant though."
"Nothing special here. Poured out to a clear yellow color with a short lived foamy head. Odors were a bit skunky, but not enough to make the beer undesireable. Flavors of corn and malt were detected. Finished rather crisp, with a touch of bitterness on the aftertaste. Worth a try, but not anything to go out of your way to find."
"My bottle gave a web address (www.singha.com) that does not work and was stamped ""for export only""...interesting considering they sell the same stuff in Thailand. (Maybe this is a way of determining what's to go overseas and what's to be sold domestically)."
"Bottle. Pours out like another pale, stale straw colored lager...poor head retention modest lacing, sharp carbonation. nothing spectacular in the nose...some sweet grainyness, light grass tones. Sharp up front peppery ( aggressive carbonation) nice biscuit malt spine with lemony hop balance... clean sharp finish with a citrus-bready after taste. Not bad...the distinct malt backbone was a pleasant surprise and the lemon departure of the hops near the finish give you the impression this is a sharp spritzy helles. Just the thing to knock back with some spicy Tai Bar BQ."
"The Bottle definitely gives the impression that I'm drinking something impressive. The glass I just emptied does not labor under that misapprehension. Yeah you get a little more flavor and a little more booze and maybe that helps you know you're alive, but this beer simply doesn't taste very good and likely won't have you coming back for seconds."
"Very oddly shaped 12 oz. brown bottle. Medium gold color, with a big white head that fades to an unveven rocky surface. Not getting much in the smell department. Very metallic and citrusy, a very noticable hop presence. Full bodied and grainy, this is an interesting beer, one that actually has something more than your standard import lagers."
"Probably better on tap at the open-air beer markets during the winter. But IÂ’m no snob. IÂ’d have mine anywhere, including late night plastic tables outside AM/PM, throwing rocks at stray dingoes."
"Not something that I would go out and get, unless adjunct lagers were the only fare or Thai food is involved, but a rather solid lager."
"Take it with you to a Thai restaurant, order spicy Kow Pad Gai (chicken-fried rice) with mixed vegetables. Ask for a chilled glass is available and drink up. Chockdee!! (Cheers)"
"Picked this up in the new (around me anyway) 12 oz. bottle six-pack.This pours with a healthy rocky snow white head settling over light straw colored liquid in the glass. Nose is lighty sweet/malty, with no discernable hops detected. First taste is a little malt sweetness leading to a sharp bitter hoppiness that dries slightly at the finish. Lingering hop bitterness leaves a pleasant clean aftertaste in my mouth. A nice light bodied beer that falls into the pilsner/malt liquor catagory. Goes down great on a warm day."
"The beer poured a pale yellow, had no head whatsoever. It was pale yellow, and it looked very much like Budweiser or MGD. Had a weak, bitter taste with a hint of syrup. Left a hint of a bitter after taste. The only reason that I bought it was to drink a beer from Thailand. Its not the worst beer that I've ever had (that's a tie between Miller High Life and Edison Light), but its not very good. Try it to say that you've had beer from Thailand."
"Comments - This beer was better than I expected. I not not a huge fan of adjunt lagers, but this one is worth a try. I noted that the label says that the ingredients are water, malt, and hops (no yeast), so I'm not sure why this is an adjunct lager (or how it was fermented, for that matter). At the risk of copying every other review written about this beer, it seems like it would be a good idea to pair it with spicy food."
"The semi-sweet, lemony taste/aroma pared well with the Thai food, little disappointed there wasnÂ’t more hop kick - but still little aftertaste. Yeah, could drink *several* of these, but they would be much better with the spicy Thai food. Will have them again."
"I figured since I'm eating a spicy dinner, that I should drink a beer brewed in a land where spicy cuisine abided. Pours the pale, adjunct lager yellow. A shade or two darker than urine. A one finger head forms, lasts for a minute, then quickly fades away to film. A few whisps of irish lace, specifically around the rim where the beer reached its peak. The first smell was killer. I actually exlaimed ""Yikes! They expect me to drink this?"" The second smell wasn't as bad though. Perhaps my nostrils quickly adjusted? Who knows. Sulfur, which is what I believed that first whiff was. Grains, grass and overcooked vegetables. Their is a unique taste to this that I can't quite put my finger on. What is it? I looked through the reviews and none of them seem to ring that bell on what that taste is. Sort of a stale, bitter/sour taste. This soon subsided to a diacetyl, lemon grass taste with a malt backbone. Aftertaste has a hint of that unique taste, but a little less stale. That unique taste, it isn't good I'm sorry to say. It's not terrible, which is about the only good thing I can say about it. The mouthfeel reminds me of sea water. Something I would not choose to drink again. I've had worse beers. However, their is very little I could say that is positive about this beer. Perhaps, this is a beer best used for cooking and not for drinking."
"Singha has a touch more flavor and, therefore, a little more personality than many macro lagers. It's still incredibly mediocre beer. If I ever find myself in Bangkok, I might 'go native' and toss back a few cold ones. Absent that, no thanks."
"Taste is sweet and lagery. Almost no hops in the taste either. Fairly clean aftertaste."
"Oh gosh, Please don't drink this. I got a case of this for cheap through a distributer. It poured yellow and smelled like water. 6% ABV and a malt liquor, if that is what you like. Buy this beer if you are going for the high. Went into an area market and this was going for 10.99 a six pack. Go immediately there and purchase this. Give them a 20 and get back 8 dollars and a few cents change and then quickly pick up a phone and call the police, you have been robbed. I did get some thai food and had a few and it didnt treat me too bad."
"eh. below average i think. pretty standard stuff as far as asian lagers go. it pours a very pale yellow colour with a soapy thinnish head that dissolves rather quickly. the smell is a touch malty with very faint hop noticeabillity. perhaps a touch sweet and even a bit metallic at times. the flavour is more of the same but with a grassy/straw kind of flavour. this one sort of went well with my pad thai, but i would have preferred something with a bit more body and flavour overall. i could probably be coerced into sampling this one again with thai food as that's it's origin and it a basic brew that washes down the food somewhat nicely, but i would look for other options first and would never just sit around and drink one on it's own."
"A pale yellow/straw colored beer with a bright white head that disappears quickly. There is a light sweet and grainy aroma with just a hint of lemon in the backgroung. The taste starts out with that light sweetness on the tip of your tongue but there is a good assertive hop presence that takes over quickly. There is a peppery spiceyness to the finish that is interesting. The 6%ABV is not high enough for the alcohol to make it's pesence felt in the taste but you do start to get warmed up after a few."
"Unique broad shouldered bottle shape, sort of like a stubby. This pours a very clear pale yellow color. The head quickly disperses into a pure white wisp and leaves almost no lace (Im big on the lace). The smell is sweetish with some lime and hop notes. The taste is also sweet but a lot better tasting than North American Adjunct lagers, the corn/rice and DMS are at an absolute minimum. Theres also some subdued noble hop flavors. The finish is sweetish but sufficiently balanced. Mouthfeel is quite light but actively carbonated. This beer is quite drinkable, with no really off flavors nor any stand out ones. It doesnt seem like a malt liquor to me, too flavorful and light. I agree with the other BAs who classify it as a German Pilsner."
"drinkability: Not bad, but nothing to get excited about either, this beer was suggested to me by my cousin, as going great with spicy food! I haven't tried it with food yet, but, it isn't that bad a beer, pretty decent!"
"If you want to drink a beer, this is not what you should reach for. However, it does serve an important role. A lot of Thai food is pretty spicy, and when you eat something very spicy, you want to reach for a glass of water to wash it down. Alas, there's no booze in water, and thus it can't get you drunk. Enter Singha. This is a flavorless, textureless, odorless beer. It's essentially seltzer that also gets you tanked; which can be a very good thing. After eating some really spicy noodles it isn't like you'd be able to really taste much of anything anyway, so it would be a waste to get a Delirium to eat with your spicy pad thai. However, if you're going to be going to a Thai place, and need something to put the fire out, Singha acts as water extra."
"Pours a pale yellow with a foamy white head. Skunky nose with a very faint background of real hops. Taste is full of adjunct malt, tempered slightly by a light fruitiness and a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is a little bit foamy, with a strange stickiness around the roof of the mouth. Probably OK if you're drinking it with Thai or Chinese food, but on its own, I'm not impressed."
"Note: I wish I could be more descriptive in my review, but this is not the type of beer that lends itself to description. It simply is. Neither good, nor bad."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light gold color with one finger of head. There is just a little bit of lacing. The smell is fairly sweet and malty, some grassiness. A light aroma, very faint. The taste is malty at first with a touch of sweetness. Slightly hoppy finish. A little adjuncty. The mouthfeel is a little light and watery, and the drinkability suffers some. Just an average lager."
"Thx"
"What a suprise this was. Pours a light golden yellow with a foamy frothy head that retained farely well. Lacing was gobbing down the glass with each sip. The smell was of corn and grain, slight alcohol scent, a little roasted malt detected. The taste was smooth and sweet. The crisp refreshing hops went well with the caramelly smoothness. A medium bodied lager. Hints of fruit bring up the rear, a great lager. Very drinkable, great with kung pao chicken or spicy foods."
"What made this beer stand out from others like it was its dryness. The malt was well hidden behind this crisp dryness and lingering hops. The hops didn't bite, per se, but squeezed the tongue through out the taste."
"Very clear, pale golden with a very thin white head that didn't last long. Stale hop smell, sweetness evident with a characteristic lager sharpness. The flavour was lightly sweet with some bitterness balancing things at the finish. Fairly well balanced with a light body."
" Enjoyed at a nice Gloucester Thai restaurant. Pours an appealing bright gold, with a white and lacy head. Smells crisp and pilsner-like. This beer isnÂ’t bad. It focuses on the spiciness of the hops. A crisp and refreshing beer, this does what it was designed to do, compliment Thai food, but in my opinion it canÂ’t compete with the best Czech pilsners."
"And then about halfway into the bottle, a mask of pressure settles around my eyes and sinuses. I check the bottle and find a freshness label--""FILL 122503""--so it's not that old a bottle. The discomfort lets up in a little while, but it's unsettling. I think I'll try something else for Thai food next time."
"Like a draft I had in college only more malty. Pepper lemmongrass licorice spice. No aroma. Bit of foamy soap suds on yellow. Mid-sip notice acidic sour and grainy and it would calm very spicey food, about it. Touch of hops. Refreshes more than water."
"Had this last night at a wonderful family-run ""like you get in Thailand"" Thai restaurant. It paired up with spicy baked/fried fish and spicy curry very nicely. I probably would not drink this in those times when ""I want a beer", but it worked well in this setting. I'll admit that my ratings may be a little higher because I had it with good food."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't have ordered it if I wasn't at a Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't hesitate to have it again (at a Thai restaurant)."
"Oddly enough, in Thailand the locals drink this on the rocks."
"A straw-golden pour with a medium white head. The heads fades quite quickly and the beer looks much like apple juice. The nose is moderately malty. Taste wise i found the maltiness was accompanied with a grainy sweetness that stayed through the finish. A pretty light mouthfeel, nice carbonation, but light. This an slightly below average beer as it stands. An easy drinker but not one that i would return to on many occasions. Overall, a light malty beer of little distinction."
"The taste is of a very basic lager, with maybe a bit more hops, and a thicker mouthfeel and aftertaste. The bitterness wasn't enjoyable. Maybe a very light aspect of caramel, but it's well hidden. I don't think I'll drink that one again, unless I'm forced to do so..."
" Very disappointed in this one, as I love Thai food."
"I can imagine drinking this beer with a meal and not even bothering to notice what type of beer it was, nor even thinking to. Unmemorable."
"Drinkability is ok, if thereâ€™s nothing else besides really awful swill. Hopefully, that situation hopefully will not arise."
"A good brew for Thai food."
"Pours to a white head that eventually fades to a thin ring of bubbles and no lace. Urine-yellow color and ample carbonation. Sulfury smell eventually fades away revealing sweet, ""lagery"" malt aroma with a little hops. Flavor is european lager-like with extra sweetness and alcohol flavor. This is what American malt liquor should taste like! 6% alcohol by volume helps you feel good fast. Tingly mouthfeel aided by hops and alcohol. Not bad for a big-brewery style beer. Quite drinkable and would go well with Thai food. This brew goes down fast and easy for a 6% beer so be careful. Especially in Bangkok."
"Mouthfeel was thin. Drinkability is tougher, this is not a session beer, but even given its short comings, it went well with the tasty Thai food that this restaurant offers. Perhaps the good food raised the score of this otherwise mediocre beer. I noticed this is labeled a malt liquor, is that due to the 6% alcohol?"
"Drinkability: Good; tasty, crisp and substantial--great with Thai food. While Asian beers tend to be pretty mediocre, IMHO, this is a top-notch pilsner that will hold its own with its Euro counterparts. No Urquell or Czechvar, but good stuff."
"Singha's initial dollop of sweet maltiness is immediately followed by a crisp, crackling hop character that turns sweetly grainy in the aftertaste -- or so claims the 365 days of beer calendar that I got for Christmas. I'm trying as many of the recommended beers on the day they appear and, unfortunately, January 7th was Singha. It looks and smells like a cheap lager, virtually no head and virtually no taste. ItÂ’s a bit thicker on the palate than American crap beer, but it's your basic ""serve cold, swill it down, catch a buzz"" beer for the masses."
"This beer isn't as bad as I imagined it to be, but it's quite different from what I usually favour. I was ansty about trying this one, but I would recommend this to people as an extremely unique, if not exciting, beer."
"It starts mild and crsip with some acidic quality, but not a lot of distinct flavor. As it settles onto the tongue, Singha becomes light-bodied and smooth, but with complex sour notes. Fruit-like flavors are also discernible when the beer is fresh from the refridgerator. It finishes rather unpleasantly. Singha rolls off the tongue quickly, but its aftertaste comes back with a vengenance. The beer's leavings become a lot like cough syrup as you get to the bottom of the glass. The heavy taste sits in the center of your tongue for a long time after the bottle has been put in the recycle bin."
"Singha is a bit creamy and sweet for me to want to drink more than a half dozen at one sitting, but it is a damned nice beer and one I heartily recommend."
"What else is their from Thailand?"
"The appearance when poured into the glass was of a plain yellow color, nothing fancy, and it boosted some carbonation. The head that was formed was white in color that lasted only a moment then fell to almost nothing, except a ring on the edges. It did manage to leave some lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of malts, light hops, pepper spice, and some light fruit (plums). The malt and pepper seemed to stand out. The flavors started off with a pepper spice bite then the hops came over my tongue, then as it settled over my tongue I noticed a sweet malt and spicy pepper dominate the flavors as it started to slide down my throat, and finished off with a fruity flavor in the back. The aftertaste was mostly a combination of malty pine with hints of fruit (as it warmed). The body was light to medium. I did notice that when first served cold it had a kind of plastic feel in my mouth that was noticeable but diminished as it warmed. But I also noticed that it became slightly bitter as it became too warm. Over all I would say that it was not a bad beer to drink. I rather liked the spiciness appeal it had to it. I would have liked to try one that was a little fresher, and if get a chance to I will do so."
"This is one of those beers that, judged on its own, would not fare terribly well. But taken in context with the ethnic cuisine to which it is particularly well-suited, the beer gains a notch or two. Pale straw, some vague sweet grain in the aroma. Very smooth, with a slightly astringent sweetness. Not bad, but pretty pedestrian. Team it up with some potent Thai spice, however, and the beer kicks into gear as an ideal salve to sooth a raw tongue. Mutes the fire a bit, and then gets out of the way."
"I would lump this in with Natty Ice and Elephant as amongst some of the most foul beer I've tried. From other reviews, it looks like that this could be a decent beer at times. I do not have anything good to say about this beer though."
"Overall, Singha is still pretty close to what I remember from my stops in Thailand. Back then I could hardly choke it down and would opt for nearly anything else. I still wouldnÂ’t get this unless approaching Â“last resortÂ” status."
"poured with a very energenic head and settled to small white head, very pale straw-yellow color. some hint of sweetness in the aroma (being from malt or corn I can't tell) followed by a slight spicy hoppiness. the corny/malty sweet taste is there again followed by more hop character than I was expecting and a good dose of co2. all in all this is a very good compnion with a spicy thai food, the residual sweetness and co2 clears the palate and some of the heat."
"Drinkability: I wasn't prepared to like this as much as I did. I'm not saying it's world class, but I'll definitely have it with Thai food when eating out. Easily drinkable and goes quite well with the myriad flavors of Thai cuisine."
"This pilsner poured a fizzy, yellow color with creamy, tall, white foam that left good lace on the glass. The smell was malty with some grain and a faint hint of sulfur. The taste was tangy, malty, with some grain, and with a sourness in the finish. As the beer warmed there was a light sweetness (corn?). The mouthfeel was crisp and tangy with some sourness in the finish. It was relatively clean, with medium-light body and good carbonation. This was an easy drinking, lighter pilsner, and was well suited to compliment spicy food very nicely."
"This is a beer that has its ups and downs. When its fresh and not abused, as my samples were yesterday, it is very fine indeed for drinking with spicy Thai cuisine. In that context, both the sweetness and richness work well. I can't really imagine drinking this on its own however."
"Not bad overall. Went well with pizza."
"Not magnifient, but good enough to share with your friends without hurting anyone. Don't know if I could drink a ton of these and stand the sweetness."
"I wish Logan had some good Thai food to try this with (maybe I should learn to cook my own). Clear yellow with a little fizzy white head--not a great looker (could pass for Bud). It does have a smell though--some malts, but mostly pungeant, resiny hops and a bit of alcohol. Taste is surprisingly strong flavored honey malts with a modest, bitter finish. Is there corn in here, I can't tell. Definitely more flavorful than most macro lagers. I think I'll wait until I visit Thailand before I buy this again."
"First time I had this was during one night in Bangkok with some friends listening to some bad Karaoke in a hotel bar. Multiple pitchers were shared. Now to try this again... Pale yellow in color with a foamy white head. Smells kind of sweet, some hops and grains in there as well. Has a hoppy metallic flavor, some mellow grains. No distinct flavors here but has a very clean taste. Quite drinkable and the burps really sting the nose. I could have used ten of these at Teton Thai. Now if only I was back in Thailand..."
"This is one of those beers that everyone can enjoy, meaning some guy who wants to drink to get drunk can use this as a session, and the beer lover won't get too offended at it's taste. The nice lacy head dies too fast, and there isn't really much of a faint hop smell. Very sweet, which really compliments Asian style cooking."
"Not something I enjoy at all, the double tapered bottle was more interesting then the sweet but bland beer."
"The somewhat uniquely shaped 12oz bottle has a cool label. The beer pours a nearly perfectly clear golden color with a fair amount of head and an abundant CO2 supply beneath. The smell is malty and hints of mild bitterness. The taste is sweet and bready with an almost dusty dry aftertaste. Hops aren't apparent, but the nice crispness suggests they're in there. This beer is very good with a wide variety of foods and as an after work thirst quencher."
"All in all this is a great brew to pair with Spicy BBQ, spicy Tai cuisine would be the obvious pick."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden yellow, with a fair head that quickly receded. Immediatly after pouring came the aroma of skunkiness. Even in a brown bottle. Very little carbonation, it seems like it all disappeared in the head. Taste is flat and bland, with just a trace of hops bite. Skunkiness is still there. Reminds me of alot of macros just flatter."
"Yuck is my first impression of this brew. It poured a medium white head of mostly fine bubbles. The body is yellow and there was carbonation observed. There was next to no lacing on the sides of my glass. The only description that I can give for the aroma is ""yucky""."
"This brew pours a medium head of fine to medium sized bubbles and a carbonated weak pee yellow body. Its aroma is very strong and replusive. It barely tastes better than it looks. Its flavor is fizzy skunky thin and slightly hopped. Definately a brew to finish and go on to the next one."
"Came in a 335ml brown bottle. Colour is an incredibly light straw colour, considering this 6% malt liquor. Nose is...ooooweee...is that a skunk for the golden logo on the bottle? A bit skunky at first, it smells sweet, a bit boozy, spicy hops, a little metallic. Taste is very unassuming, in fact it's hardly present. Kind of grainy and sweet, and it has a slight boozy kick for a finish. I can barely finish this one, don't think I'd go back for another. Perhaps it is better complimented with Thai food, which I do enjoy, so I wouldn't write it off completely."
"Singha Lager was the beer in a glass tonight at the Flying Saucer. The beer poured a nice yellow with a robust white head. The aroma of an adjunct (I suspect rice) dominated the beer but not nearly as much as it dominated the flavor. I thought that the beer had been skunked but I tasted all the beers at our table and thought they all tasted equally bad. I would have to be eating some VERY spicy Thai food not to rate this a bad beer. It would be good to demonstrate the effect of adjuncts on the taste of beer but little else."
"Singha would also pair well with Jerk shrimp/pineapple kabobs or rustic style pizza with a daiblo sauce and thai basil."
"Poured a nice yellow hue. Whispy head. Good carbonation. It had a lot of malt, not overwhelming. It tasted like a well malted lager IMHO. Minimul hops present. I would not consider this a ""homey"" malt beverage, but rather an exoctic alternative to enjoy with hot Thai cuisine."
"What can I say about this beer. I poured, smelled, sipped and poured it down the drain. The color was a medium golden with little foam. The smell was not pleasing at all, just nothing there to even seem good enough to drink. The taste was bitter and tasteless. So, I poured it down the drain. If I don't like a beer, I just get rid of it! I don't beleive in suffering, just dump it!"
"Golden in color when poured with a thin white head that left behind a little lace. The smell was of malt and grains, with a sharp crispness to it. This crispness followed through in the taste. If any of the mass-swill producers had any cahones, this is what America would be drinking in mass quantities. Hop character was pronounced and abrupt, and the beer left little to linger in my mouth after swallowing. This beer was certainly easy to drink, and was the perfect accompaniment to tonight's pad prik and roti cani."
"Sadawi, crup! Oh, sweet nectar of Siam, the perfect companion to spicy Thai fried rice, prawns, and tenderloin of water buffalo a la pataya. The definitive beer of Thailand still satifies the thirst with strong malt flavors and solid body. Light yellow with a white head, malt nose, and decent aftertaste, it stands up to strong foods with its full-bodied goodness."
"Color is light clear yellow, with a fairly big head of frothy foam about three fingers high and settled after a few minutes to uneven white foam. Smells of musty grasses, grain, and malt. Taste is thin and sweet with a corn grain and a thin wheat like presense. Feel is very thin and watered down to a light body with no hold. Not all that bad, but not all that good either. More flat and empty then anything flavorwise."
"Initial smell, when cold, is some pretty strong lagerpfonk that tames to let through some grains. Maybe some corn. The front shows a little caramel malt at warmer temps. The middle is thin and sweetens some. When cold, the finish is slightly metallic with some obvious alcohol. This too tames to a decent hoppy and grainy taste. This isn't bad compared to American macros and some other strong export lagers, but that's about it."
"pat"
"Pours a pale medium golden color with a foamy white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is light malt and grain with some notes of cooked corn. Light in body and very crisp and refreshing. Taste is sweet malts with some yeasty grain notes. Bitter hops come through in the end with a citrus rind flavor leaving a very dry and crisp finish. The alcohol level of 6% is fairly well hidden, especially for such a light brew. Nothing special overall, but it does pair nicely with a plate of spicy Thai food."
"I had this with some Thai food, and it's a decent accompaniment, but this is not a beer that I would choose to drink. There is nothing offensive about it, it's just not very interesting."
"This beer was perfect in the strip bar in which I had it. Or maybe it was just the girls who made life and everything about it seem so sweet."
"The aroma has a hint of citrus being noticeable. It's appearance is a light gold, but with an unimpressive head, if any at all. The flavor is a little too malty/sweet and leaves little for the mouth to savor. It isn't as smooth as I would've liked, but I've had worse asian beers than this one."
"Pours a very clear pale straw color with lots of carbonation and a large white head. The smell consists of cooked corn, light hops, and a faint alcohol. The taste starts with a light carb bite and transcends into an earthy grain and light hops finish. This is a light bodied brew that finishes in the middle of the road between sweet and dry. Not at all bad! Choc-tee!"
"Light golden in color...grassy nose....pretty tasty little beer....tastes a bit like a Canadien Lager...a tich of alcohol spiciness...and a tight dry finish....slides down reall easy for the high ABV...about medium bodied for this style...not bad at all...would match nicely with spicy Cuisine I imagine.."
"Sickly pale yellow with a tiny white head, soapy retention. Sweet malty nose, some husk and grassy spice with underlying skunk. Palate is not indicative of Malt Liquor but rather a spicy, grassy European Lager. Some bitterness, thus the hops make more than a cameo. Light, watery. Finished dry, somewhat clean. I was rather indifferent towards Singha."
"A classic straw-like gold color with a ok white head that settles to a very thin film. Leaves an oil like slight lace on the glass. The smell is grain-like with a malty overtone. A very smooth beer to drink with a spice or onion-with meal. Rich malt flavor & slight hop complete this beer. The kicker is infact, the kick. The 6% abv quietly mellows as it warms you as you complete the meal and it may surprise you when your done, so be for-warned."
"Interesting product from Thailand...this brewery does a fairly good job....The colour is of a clear light gold with nice carbonation. Limited head which turns to light lace and a medium ring. The body is close to being full and the taste is of a hint of lemon hops, leaving a lingering dryness."
"Pour a quite pale gold with a thick and creamy cloudtop head. Lots of lively carbonation and plenty of broken lace. Grainy aroma with some mild hops. Taste begins with quite sweet malts, and a sting of carbonation, towards the middle of the taste bitter citrus hops appear, finishes with a distinct metallic bitterness. Quite a different sort of beer that makes for an interesting change of pace."
"Malt liquor? Tastes more like a strong German Pils with its nice and malty spine and long, bitter finish. Nose is big husky malt, stainless steel and lime leaf. If given the choice, I'd take this over nearly all mass-produced Asian Lagers no matter what the cuisine."
"The pour a clear gold or straw color if you prefer, the head white, adequate as with th lace. Malt nose, somewhat sweet start, the top ""Thinner Than My Wallet After A Beer Quest", finish is modestly hopped, middlin on the carbonation, clean and crisp finish. Drinkable, but nothing to ""Scream About""."
"Clear golden in color with a bright white head that drops quickly, but leaves a reasonable collar and some whispy surface foam from a very fine & highly effervescent carbonation. There is, however, no lace to speak of. The aroma is skunky, but also offers a distinct grainy maltiness. The body is medium with a brisk carbonation that gives a little bite on the tongue. The flavor starts with a sweet grainy malt, then reveals some light hop flavor as it warms in the mouth, and finishes with another touch of hop flavor and a fair amount of bitterness that's bouyed by a sweetish maltiness that sticks in the mouth. The alcohol, which is only listed as 6.0%, is somewhat apparent. Apart from the fact that this is not a complex beer, and coupled with the skunkiness of the aroma (remember a fresh bottle may be clear of that), and the apparent alcohol - this is a very nice, and interesting beer. I really liked its big malty quality and the hoppy bitterness that followed it. I remembered this beer the next day and wanted to have another. However, I think a case of it would be way too much! Still, enjoyable and interesting."
"Singha, from Thailand: 6% alcohol.  Has a filled on date of 4/2/02, not too shabby for coming all the way around the world.  Bright yellow beer, completely clear with a nice head that clings to the side of the bottle.  Light, almost absent aroma.  Very dry, with persistent hops bitterness. As it warms, citrus/lemon flavors begin to emerge.  Seems like this beer has more carbonation than taste.  Average."
"Poured into a Pilsner glass...clear, pale greenish-yellow.  Skunky aroma to put it kindly.  Head is big-bubbled but a fleeting one.  Metallic and scouring flavor, sulfurous and skunky, with a strangely bitter tone.  Not malty smooth, this settles into a downright unpleasant flavor to me.  But, the brew definitely makes a stand.  I'll pass..."
"Pours a bright yellow and shiny color... huge head that dies young. On the nose slight saaz hop aroma. Saaz hop flavor on the palate also as well as, hint of chewy maltiness, and a slight spearmint hoppiness to it. Finish is mostly dry. I could not even dectect a hint of the 6.0 % abv.. Pretty average stuff, good considering it's made in Thailand."
"This is the best Asian beer I've tried.  It's got decent color and smell and a nice semi-sweet malty flavor with enough hops to notice.  It goes very well with spicy food, but don't limit it to Thai food.  Singha also goes down nicely.  Any beer mentioned in song by the Pogues can't be all bad."
"A bit of a sweetish alc. smell and taste at first, but quite dry and even bitter towards the end, i like it with Thai food, but thats all."
"Th only beer to have with Thai food.  Nice mouthfeel and balanced sweetness."
"For a beer at 6.0% abv, this has a slick, syrupy alcohol flavor. Pleasant malt to balance."
"Highly recommended with Thai food -- quite the refreshing contrast."
