It isn't filtered, so you get some of the malty thicker sediment in each bottle. It tastes of corn with a hint of barley right before the leafy finish. It doesn't have a very unique feel to it, but it's a beer I would drink while I'm socializing. Not the best beer in the world, but one I enjoy and will continue to drink.

Its aroma was simple but satisfying, being dominated by sweet malts with undertones of grassy hops. The beer's flavour very much followed its aroma, beginning with a strong, pleasant malty sweetness which gives way to a very mild hop bitterness, with a clean, dry finish. Ekstra had a soft mouthfeel and I would describe it as fairly light bodied. There's nothing complex about this beer...it is simply a solid, enjoyable brew, especially for those like myself who lean towards sweet, malty tastes. At $2.35 per 500 ml bottle, the beer is reasonably priced, and that Lithuanian gent in the liquor store did not steer me wrong!","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

Uniform smoothness does well to add a huge refreshing quality. Lots of pale malt flavor, with hints of baked apple and delicate floral hoppiness. Perhaps the slightest suggestion of sulphur here, but it’s really not something that pops out. Very clean throughout, with a finish that lands dry. The label notes that it is unpasteurized, which is certainly noticed. A standup lager—worth a go.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 14, 2011"

3.1,5.1,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Pours a dark golden straw. The light, meringue-like head is insubstantial yet retains well enough. Lacing is splotchy. Sweet bread dough aroma and a good portion of earthy, woody hop aroma. A little bit of apple sweetness in the nose distracts from the soft malts and hops and, when combined, gives off a horseblanket-like twang. Tastes like a very old apple pie; malts are sweet and smooth, but does not finish clean. Maybe too much sulphur, but a slight earthy/mushroomy taste in the middle. Hops are not as aggressive as in the nose. Feels almost too smooth and could use some soluble carbonation. Not as dull as others of its ilk.","tapman","Nov 09, 2011"
3.48,18,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Hazy, pale straw colored with a decent looking head of shock white fizz that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Lemon zest, herbal hops and untoasted grain make for a pleasant nose on this one. Well balanced but a bit more Pils than EPL, hay and raw grain with just the right amount of hop bitterness and carbonation to clean the palate. Ekstra is on the leaner side of medium bodied with a seltzery, tongue scrubbing carbonation. An above average import lager.","biggred1","Aug 21, 2011"

The beer reminded me of other northern Euro lagers, like Okocim, as it has a little more character than Heineken, but is still no pilsner.

Not too much here on this one, could be any macro. A little sweeter than most and the hopping isn't bad but this one doesn't really rate the fancy foil top.

Not much to smell, either; cornbread, tin, and dish soap dominate. Somewhat odd tasting, but not really bad, with some unusual processed grain flavors that are very reminiscent of corn flakes - strange, because if I am to believe the label, there is no corn in this beer. Rummy sweetness sidelines whatever pleasantness the malts may have to offer, while a whip-crack of hop bitterness and a completely unnecessary tangent of alcohol help distract from the not-dry-enough finish. This beer is not as highly carbonated as it looks, and the mouthfeel suffers for it.

The aroma is bit muted, but slightly sweetened with round, light malt. There are notes of lemon, hay, soft grass and medicine. It is light bodied and a bit chalky and alkaline in the mouth. It's actually not too watery. This beer tastes a lot boozier than it is. There is a strong fusel taste, followed by corn, solvent and black pepper. The hops almost come through at the finish with their soft grassiness, but the toll of the alcohol(s) drowns everything out. This kind of tastes like a 40.

The nose is clean and bright with sweet, adjunct malt and grassy hops. It's lightly crisp in the mouth with a moderate carbonation and dextrinous, medium body. The flavor delivers a semi-grainy, obviously adjunct enhanced, semi-sweet maltiness; backed by a solid bitterness; and peppered with lemony, grassy, and herbal hop flavors.

The nose is mild with bready malt and traces of grain and corn, the slightest trace of something resembling hops lingers in the distance. The flavour, while not bad in an awful way, is very nondescript, and what can be discerned doesn't really paint this beer more favorably. A very grainy profile, a bit tart due to this, with a dry finish and grainy aftertaste. Well along the way of the aftertaste some faint herbal hops start to emerge. Better late than never, but I'm not sure why they bothered at all. The mouthfeel is light with a bit of carbonation, although pretty watery overall. If this stuff won a gold award like it says on the label then I'd be wary of trying the rest of the stuff in the competition as well.
