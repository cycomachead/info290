"really good and tasty. surprised by the effect."

"Better than the typical American lagers, but not saying much.  Pretty average, nothing too exciting.  A lot of carbonation."

"O:  interesting keeps coming up and up with this brew, for it's got a lot of smell and taste notes and even a mouthfeel that is different from anything else I've had ... not 100% unique, not completely different but still different.  the peachy/apricot flavor slowly takes hold, but the grain and lemon flavors, the bread malt and the mix of many different aroma notes make for a cool path to the leveling out fruitiness.  great brew."
"Nose grains, sweet malt, light fruit, bready, cereals.  Taste light lemon, herbal grassiness, sweet malt, hay, biscuits, & hoppy bitter finish"
""
"I smell/taste the slightest hint of honey. This is a really nice, crisp light beer. Very sessionable"

"This is just my favorite beer ........ever.  Such a simple brew solution yet the product of this labor is perfect!  It's the only lager I've ever found to have malty legs.  Its perfect blend of barley and hops gives you the sense that its malty and bitter attributes are released on to your taste buds for an epic battle (which is ultimately just won by the hops army).  The finish is crisp but doesn't leave your tongue feeling dry.  The complexity of the competing flavors makes for a fantastic taste interrupted by nothing as the malted barley and hops in this beer are organic.  It clearly makes a difference.  I would enjoy this beer in the company of the most boring and annoying people in the world."

"Poured a clear golden yellow with very little white head that quickly receded to a ring of white. Abundant carbonation bubbles could be seen going up the glass. Very nice looking and true to style. Scents of lager yeast, grainy malt and slight earthy hops. A simple but well rounded and bright aroma, very suitable to the style, quite pleasant. Taste begins with sweet malt, moving into some grainy and bready malt in the middle, before finishing with sweet malt and slight hints of hops. The aftertaste is sweet, with faint undertones of herbal, earthy hops. A good, crisp, bright flavor, befitting a pale lager. Maybe a touch on the sweet side and needing a little bit more hops, but otherwise quite good. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a crisp feel. Very nice, quite easy to drink. Overall this is a good lager with a nice refreshing aroma and flavor profile. My only complaint is the relatively low hop character, but otherwise it's a nice beer."

"I'm generally a bit intolerant of this style, but this is actually fairly drinkable - it's definitely one of the better blond lagers I've experienced, though I'd choose a german pilsner over this any day."

"Pours a clear, pale yellow, nice effervescence; pristine 2 inch, white head. Light hops & barley smell with some flowery notes. Very smooth, slightly sweet taste, no bitterness; the hops, barley, & malt are very well balanced. Mouth feel - medium carbonation, light bodied. Overall - a pleasant surprise and a nice break from the heavier beers I've been leaning toward lately. I almost passed this one up; glad I didn't."

"Overall - I think this may be one of my new favorite session beers. I'll revisit this one quite often. This is a world class lager in my book. Probably the best Euro Lager I've sampled. Samuel Smith makes another masterpiece, and is a brewery that is certainly one of the best on the planet."

"from now on every lager I taste will be compared to the bruerys humulus, so im sorry to all the well made generic lagers, you will never be the same to me. this one though, is quite good for what it is, absolutely not a mind bender, but a solid beer no doubt. pours dead clear golden with an inch of lasting white airy head. the thing about this though, is that theres a launch point, a central feature of my glass thats rocketing spiraling bubbles hurriedly to the surface forever, it wont stop, and its sexy. the nose is straight lager yeast, over a light malt body, no inspirational but well done. the flavor is the same, with some decent bittering hops and that crispness that any good lager needs. with one sip left in my glass, the bubbles are still sprinting to the surface, its so awesome. a littler herbal, a little hoppy, a true euro lager, better than almost all of them, plus its organic, so props for that. light body, super soft and clean, like a Swiffer. overall a solid brew, not as fun as the stouts and stuff, but a worthwhile offering that I would like to share with my Molson drinking father."
""
""
""
""
"O- not great by samuel smiths' standards, but that still makes for a solid brew. nice to see a lager that's a little more hop-centric than most."
""
""
""
"Overall I am going to vote this in the world class lager realm. And maybe even one up them because it is NOT in a green bottle to get skunked!"
"Overall: generally, I am anti-""organic-movement"" products, but with this beer you can really pick up on the clean, crisp and pure flavours. A very nice lager indeed. My only concern is that I still don't think a lager is worth this. Sure it's a damn quality lager, but it is still AU$83 a case of 12 x 550mL (2013). Ouch."
""
"O - A superior pale beer, has the strengths of the style without being beer-flavored water. Overall I recommend."
""
"This poured a very crystal clear pale gold -promising. White feathery head that disappeared in seconds - 1st warning.. Aroma was mild, not very hoppy at all -2nd warning. Mouthfeel was mild, not flat, not overly carbonated.. just average. And that pretty much explains this beer -average in every sense of the word. The hops were almost non-existant. Tasted like a watered down Miller High Life without the hops and malt. As if the MHL is malty in any way. Considering the price I paid for this experiment (4 or 5$ for the bottle maybe? I forget, kind of like how this beer is forgetable), i'd take the Miller hands down every time. It's not that this Sam Smith brew is bad in any way -there is nothing obviously ""wrong"" with it. It just doesn't stand out at all or do anything ""right"". The malt is light as expected, the aroma is milder than expected, carbonation was right on -not high or low. More hops would give this some decent flavor -something it is lacking. It is drinkable but the question is.... why would I ?"
""
"It pours a very light clear gold with a white head that dissapates quickly. Lacing is nice once the head dies down a bit. Very grainy on the nose with a touch of hops and citrus. The taste shows a lot of grain up front, but then fades into a malty mildly bitter finish. The carbonation is ferocious, but it gives the lighter mouthfeel some character. I love that is is organic,but I just wish that there was some more body behind it."
"Samuel Smith's Organic Lager Beer ---4/5."

"O: A real good Euro Pale Lager / Pilsener."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – While the bitter is possibly slightly a little too intense for a lager, the flavor transitions, look, smell and feel are all quite nice. Not bad."
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw color with a solid sheet of white foam. Brilliant clarity. Standard grainy, slightly fruity nose with a hint of corn. Flavor is clean and subtle with straw, a bit of soil and some lemon. Light bodied with soft carb and an off dry finish. Nice beer."
""

""

"The con I see with this beer is the acidic aftertaste. It takes some getting used to. But, overall, it is a good beer."
""
""
"O: Its a pretty decent beer, don't drink pale lagers too often, I understand why some may be disappointed from a beer like this coming from Samuel Smith (their Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown Ale are impeccable), Its a decent beer, not amazing like some would expect from Samuel Smith but its alright, little lacking on flavor in my opinion but wouldn't hurt for anyone to try. Props for being organic too."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a huge fan of this beer – it’s cool it is organic but. First beer by Samuel Smith that disappointed me."
""
""
""
"O - Yeah, they don't make any crap beers at Sam Smith's but this one is pretty forgettable."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and definitely tastes organic with all-malt flavors."

"Pours a clear honey color with a 1/2 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some grassy and hay aromas. Taste is much the same along with a slight fruity flavor. There is a mild herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good and easy drinking beer that is pretty refreshing."
""
"O: Quite a good thirst quencher, but a little expensive for what it is. At least it offers enough over the Heinekens of the world to make it worth it."

"Overall - This is a very good lager. It's interesting to try an organic beer. It's very refreshing and would be great on a summer day."
"Overall: a full flavored and aromaed beer for the genre which almost diverts from the genre."
""
"Poured in a glass mug. Pours clear straw yellow with a large white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates slowly. There isn't much in the way of lacing left on the side of the glass. The beer has that nice, crisp clean lager smell. There are pale malts with some hops in the aroma. There are flavors of cracker and some hops. It's mildly bready. The body is light with abundant carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good refreshing beer. If you're looking for a different Euro lager, you can't go wrong with this one."
""
""
"A solid light lager, not something I have said a ton up until now. The aroma had me a bit worried but this one is flavorful and balanced."
""
""
""
"O: Lagers aren't my favorite, but this one's clearly above average. I'm not sure that the organic ingredients add anything but marketing flair, but they don't hurt either. All in all, a very refreshing and drinkable option, and better than most American lagers (especially those from the macro-brewers)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite a good lager. Ingredients must be the key as well as a great yeast and brewing process."
"Perfect beer for a hot summer day and pairs well with almost all types of food."
""
""
""
"I do not mean to insult this beer in any way, but this is the perfect lawnmower beer. It's light bodied, only faintly coats the tongue, and well carbonated. Washes down really nice and easy, would be a great refresher on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this os a very good lager. Clean taste and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Now I am thinking that I'd like to pit this beer against Noble Pils in the spring. Samuel Smith vs Samuel Adams. I could easily see myself preferring this beer."
"O: A very well made lager, certainly better than the large majority of so-called Euro lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do like this and the aroma is very nice which may be my favorite part. Compared to a german pils I don't like it as well but it seems to be most reminiscent of that style to me with hop and malt profile. I believe there are some cheaper alternatives that are close that are better."
""
"A very good Euro pale lager--perhaps a great one. That being said, the style is quite limiting and simple in nature."
"O: This is a very unique beer and although it's a bit expensive at -some- places, it's totally worth it imo. The grassy nature of it gives it such a natural vibe and a new refreshing taste to the entire concept of 'beer'. Good stuff!"
"550 ml bottle, got it for $2.99 on sale at my local Giant Eagle this morning. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is sweet and grainy malt along with some lemon peel. The brew tastes like grainy malt, grassy hops and a bit of lemon peel. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp, refreshing and easy to drink. I think it's a solid beer. Nothing really impresses me about this, but it's certainly not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - not a terribly intriguing beer to sample, but still good-tasting nevertheless."
"O: The best of the style I've ever had, its obviously doesnt have the intense flavors of a RIS or DIPA but for a pale lager its really good. I wouldnt go too far out of my way for it though, its still just a pale euro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the more expensive lager examples, but its a solid one. Drink fresh, these have a tendency to get all yeasty all over the place when they get older, replete with chunkie floaties."
"Really don't see where the A's coming from here. This is really nothing to write home about and bears striking resemblance to an American adjunct lager. Organic on the bottle is pretty much nothing but a marketing ploy. No enhancement of taste, IMO."
"Finish-Grains and a bit of fresh lemon are all that stay, dry finish but refreshing, very clean, overall not a bad beer, very easy to drink, excellent balance even though the flavor is light."
"There's nothing particularly interesting or complex about this beer, but it's good for what it is."
"Quite useless beer."
"For a euro lager, this is pretty solid. It has some of the same smells as the macros, but the taste is cleaner and more balanced coming close to a pilsner."
"O- such a clean, refreshing lager. A constant go to for my dad and me both."
"The appearance was a clean,bubbly wheat colored hue and the smell too similar. No skunk or bitter odor. The taste expecting to be full of hops,was to me a great mixture of malt,fullness and body,but also a kick of hops and honey sweetness. Ive had 2 kinds of Samuel Smith's now and again..I loved this beer. Can't wait to try another kind and see if they hit it out of the park again!"
"Overall: Very solid and clean English lager. No frills here, but certainly sessionable. Exceptional for the style. I will get this again if not just for the clean finish."
"The flavor is excellent, and I can see why this beer ranks best in its class. Clean and refreshing. The beer is light, simple, and pleasant. Toast, biscuits, bread, with a hint of citrus. Terrific balance. I could drink several of these. Thoroughly enjoyable. I wish this was available in six packs. I will certainly be having this one again."
"O - I burned through the bottle pretty quick, just an excellent brew after a long day at work!"
"A very nice lager from Samuel Smith - has the intensity of a good pale ale, but the light lager body. Very nice beer."
"Overall a great drink to be had, and what a fantastic summer beer this is on a hot day, I think it makes me appreciate it more."
"Overall it's a delicate, but pleasant to drink beer. The real issue is price. For a fraction I could drink any number of pale lagers that are just as good, if not better."
"Overall: average brew from one of my favorite traditional English breweries"
"O - Pretty decent but not mind-blowing or worth spending the $, as it is relatively pricey for a straight-up lager."
"O: good for its style but overall I wouldn't buy it again. From the Samuel Smith beers that I have tried this one was my least favorite, but not bad by any sort of measure."
"Overall a great beer that will make you want to keep a few on hand ""just in case!"""
"My pour netted me a big, foamy cap of a dense finger of bone-white head with very good retention. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the characteristic lager-malt sweetness with grassy undertones. Fantastiche, especially after all of those AALs! Mouthfeel was soft, not overly carbonated, but I am unsure of their claim about it being a hoppier lager. Instead, I got a good bit of clean lager sweetness and by clean, I mean adjunct free. If you really want to understand the impact adjuncts have on lager beers, have and afternoon of AALs followed the next day by one of these. Finish was dry and refreshing, just the way lager should be. ""Organic"" usually = more expensive, but this bottle was the same price as the other beers from Sam. Smith's and it was very pleasant to drink. I would have it again."
"Comments: All people who hate cheap beer should drink this to see what it is modeled off of. There aren't many lagers this good."
"This really grew on me as it opened up. The butterscotchy, buttery biscuit flavors were wonderfully executed and a nice change of pace from the lagers I've had recently."
"O: This is on par with Heineken and the like; it's not something I care to drink again."
"This lager pours out much like any other lager. The color is clear and yellow with a white soapy looking head. The aroma of this beer is a little grassy with some fresh wood coming through along with the malts and hops. The taste of the beer is lightly grassy and has a good amount of malt upfront. This fades into the slightly hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp and mostly on the lighter side for a lager. Not too bad of a beer."
"Overall: A solid lager that I would definitely seek out again. I usually like hoppier lagers/pilsners, but this one is a sessionable, refreshing beer."
"The mouthfeel is what takes this from a typical lager to something I would choose to drink again despite my preference for ales. Light and smooth, but with just enough body and dryness in the finish to make this a crisp and enjoyably drinkable beer."
"A well refined simple lager, much better than your average beer of this style. Thumbs up."
"I am not sure how old this bottle is, but this lager does taste fresh. Lagers usually don't come to mind when you think of Britain, but this is a solid effort. While this four pack was quite expensive, it is worth seeking out."
"Telegraph Road is a song by Dire Straits. Organically this is a brew that should be the coconut falling off the tree that hits you in the head, lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get the immediate farm smell, like I am feeding hay to cows. The smell then accelerates to a golden grain meadow but quickly goes white grape. The pour is nicely golden with an off white mutli bubble head that laces nicely. The taste is all grape as the smell might preclude. This is a sweet lager with minimum hopping that would pair well with seafood and light fare. Not my cup of tea, but rated for what it is, not bad and refreshing. I think the chunnel was a bad idea. This beer shows you why."
"Pours a very, very transparent golden color, bordering on a bright apricot. A pretty-hard pour produces a single-finger head that reduces to half its size somewhat quickly, though leaves a pretty good bit of lacing behind. Good looking collar sits around the edges. The nose brings forward a bit of grain and a slight fruitiness. Some English yeast present; not much, but it's there. Slight earthy feel to it as well. Taste has a nice bit of hoppines and a smooth, crisp bit of grain. Finish is really smooth and crisp. Great character in the finish. Quite drinkable and enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is great, it's highly carbonated and slips right down my throat. The drinkability is also awesome. I could drink this all night, I just have a single bottle though. A great beer that makes all the other Euro Pale Lagers I've had seem like a bad joke. Highly recommended."
"That being said, pair it with the light, yet flavorful foods that you want to eat on those nice days. Fried fish tacos, a niçoise salad, deviled eggs, sushi, a lemony pasta dish, crab cakes, etc. As for cheese, set up a cheese plate with a good garlicky salami, some olives, nuts, and an assortment of cheeses to try with this beer. Some mellow middle-of-the road cow cheeses such as Pleasent Ridge Reserve, or Montgomery's Farm Cheddar will pair well with the delicacy and acidity of this beer. A fresh, local goat milk cheese, such as Snowdrop from Haystack, or Cabra Blanca from Avalanche Goat Dairy will be a nice compliment as well. Feel free to play around a bit though, this beer offers an interesting, complex texture and flavor profile that offers a great deal of cheese pairing potential."
"Poured from a brown 18.7 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of mild malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, malts and hops, very refreshing and solid flavor. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer."
"Light straw old with a large white fluffy head. Clear liquid with good retention and lacing. Smell is light sweet malt breadiness with a twang that is typical of an organic ale. Nice light herbal hops. Taste is just grand and proper. Smooth malt and grains with a touch of funk and earth. A hint of doughy sweetness. Dry clean finish features excellent hops with some bread crusts and crackers. Feel is light, crisp, and quenching. A gentle carbonation aids feel and drinkability which is superb. I went through my 500 ml bottle in a flash. This has taste profile that goes with so many things that I could spend a month drinking and combining foods. Yum!"
"Cheers"
"Drinkability. Good drinkabllity - I could see myself having another one very easily. Went very well with Pizza, and I think it would go well with a lot of other meals. Overall a very solidly good beer."
"D - Good overall. Refreshing and very drinkable. Not outstanding but how much can you really do with this style? It has the qualities of most pale lagers but I'd say the hop flavor shines through making this one unique from the rest. More flavorful than others and quite refreshing. A good beer that I'd definitely buy again"
"Yeah, could really take or leave this beer."
"D: Not a half bad lager, and for the style, this is pretty good. I like the idea of an organic beer, and luckily this one isn't as bad as some of the other ones on the market. Worth a try if you're in the mood."
"Jake"
"D - While this isn't the most exciting beer out there its a good tasting easy drinking beer worth picking up sometime"
"Hey I'm a big fan of Samuel Smith's beers, I just didn't find anything special about this one."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied and creamy with a touch of a crisp edge. The beer goes down way too easy. A wonderful session lager. Overall, this was a nice way to end our tasting. Cheers to Samuel - safe travels, friend. We look forward to seeing you in Tadcaster sometime soon!"
"M- High carbonation and a light-medium feel clean/crisp."
"D-Very easy drinking, just not anything to get real excited about, which has more to do with the style than this particular beer. One of the better organic beers I've had."
"Extremely high. Probably the best Euro Lager I've drank so far. A perfect session beer."
"D - this one could easily break someone of a Bud addiction. it has all the seemingly positive hallmarks of your average high profile adjunct beer (light, simple taste, familiarity, drinkability, etc) and and then some. great for a summer day like today"
"Drinkability: Although the flavor is pretty mild here, it is very smooth and goes down pretty easy. Not something I would crave, but would definitely do if options were limited."
"a great brew that i'm worried may have been too old... in comparison to the original (non organic) lager this was not as brisk. didn't really contain any bitter palate cleanser. just a mild sweet of apple pie. golden in color with some lace. the malt had a mild caramel that i didn't come across before. good summer brew none the less. a session starter. drink this! not american lager. they yeast is more interesting."
"This a great tasting brew. The smell and flavor profile was something I've never experienced before. Different but good. It just feels like a lot of love went into making this beer."
"Pours a clear gold with a small white head; fine stream of carbonation race upward for several minutes. It smells and tastes far better than other Euro Pale Lagers in that completely lacks that chemically/metallic quality that ruins so many of its competitors. Its flavors are simple but well balanced and without blemish. In my opinion this is perhaps the best pale lager in the world."
"Overall, a nice little beer, worth trying if you haven't, and worth grabbing a couple bottles to keep around for summer sipping."
"Gold and crystal clear with a bright white cap. Lots of sticky lace, good head retention. Balanced aroma of cereal grains, doughy malt, pears, herbal hops. Nicely balanced flavour too. Moderate bitterness with an herbal edge, sweet malts with a hint of caramel, grassy hops with a bit of spice and lemon in the finish. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, light dryness and a crisp character. Good stuff. Highly drinkable and quite tasty."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable and refreshing. If there were a little more complexity, then perhaps my interest would remain piqued long enough to rate this even higher. Still, I would gladly have this again. I find it *considerably* better than the SS Pure Brewed Lager Beer."
"Overall: I like this beer, it is a good solid lager. But I must admit , I am a bit biased. When I reach for a beer, unless I really in the mood I don't normally reach for a lager. That being said it is a pretty damn good lager."
"Overall this was a nice and understated beer. Nothing spectacular but no flaws. Worth a shot."
"Overall a pretty uncomplicated, straight forward lager. Easy to drink and refreshing. Definitely a cut above standard lagers. Something you might want to share with a BMC drinking friend that you are trying to convert."
"D: A fantastic, sessionable lager."
"Poured a deep yellow with a light head that dissipated fairly quickly. Very little lacings sticking to the edge of the glass. Nice clarity. Sweet, malty aroma with wisp of hoppiness. Lightly carbonated. Initial heavy malt feel with a surprisingly light finish. Nice malty lager flavor with a pleasant light hop finish. Not a whole lot of character but very drinkable. Could definitey put a few of these away at one sitting."
"Super easy drinking beer with some flavor to enjoy without needing to pause to contemplate anything about it. Kudos to Sam Smith's for being organic and pulling off an English Lager. I was pleasantly surprised. This would be ultimate go-to for football parties if money was not a concern."
"Cheers!!!"
"Libation: Very drinkable, and the 5% ABV means you can have a few without flinching. Not the most flavorful lager on the planet, but I think is has enough complexity for the style. Probably a very good beer to wean people away from generic macro brews."
"D- Sam's organic ale beats out the lager in my opinion, but they are two different genres of music. There's really nothing spectacular about this beer and I could have expected more from my favorite English brewery. Not bad by any means, and really quite tasty. A little too sweet for my taste but easily drinkable. Still for something of this nature, it's nothing more than ordinary. Even if it is all organic."
"D- very much so and I can see why this one of Europe's most popular lagers."
"If American Macro lager tasted like this, none of us would rip on it. Sam Smith Lager has more body and flavor than mass-produced lagers, but it still delivers the crisp refreshment that makes a good lager such a turn on."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink this lager and the flavor profile hits the spot."
"SKÅL!"
"D: You can't get any more drinkable than this. Perfect balance of malt and hops, clean, dry, well attenuated and just plain good!"
"D - Refreshing and easy drinking."
"Drinkability is high, mouthfeel is medium bodied and finishes cleanly. There is some mild sweetness at the front of the mouth and overall its a fine beer. Not much to say, but I did enjoy it and would drink it again."
"D: Great lager. Very refreshing and easy to drink"
"It has lived up to my expectations. In fact, it is my new favorite and I can't wait to get more. It is very flavorful and so easy to drink!"
"While I'm sure that I don't know what actual contributions are made by the organic properties of this beer, overall, this is a clean and refreshing lager. A simple concept, but not always easy in its rendering, and this purveyor of fine English standard ales shows that to be the case here."
"Notes: I have to admit I was a little skeptical of a pale organic lager. I should have known better. Apparently, Samuel Smith can do no wrong."
"550 ml bottle into my samuel smith's glass. Pours a transparent golden with a decent head that lasts much longer than expected. Smells of fresh malted barley and hops. Taste is smooth grain malted barley, I was expecting this to taste much more like that offensive barley you get from miller lite, but none of that here. Maybe because the ingredients are ""organically grown withou the use of chemical sprays or artificial fertilizers"" which is nice, if you're into that kind of thing. Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. Very drinkable. This would be a great session beer. Of what I would characterize as this style, this is definitely one of the better beers I have had. Cheers."
"Salud!"
"Drinkability: A decent lager. Exceedingly drinkable with much more flavors than your standard pale lagers. Worth a try."
"Another plus is that this is an organic product and the hippy in me just loves that."
"for british style lager, this is right up there at the top. heck, it's organic. like in the old days. very drinkable. i need some pub food. organic or not."
"Body is a little thin, but very refreshing beer that is remarkably easy to drink."
"D - Fairly drinkable and refreshing. Just not a big fan of the cidery sweetness. Lacks punch."
"A very decent lager, very smooth and cleansing. The carbonation is slightly too extreme, but otherwise I found it perfectly drinkable and enjoyable. Nice."
"Notes: Next up is the non organic Sam Smith Lager so that I can see if there is any appreciable difference. Lager is not my favorite style but this is a nice, flavorful one."
"big frothy white head and a slightly orange golden body. completely clear body as well. slightly citrusy nose, with a weaker malt body. for a euro pale lager this nose is pretty good, nice bit of hops. the taste is better than average for the style, and extremely drinkable. good thicker than usual feel."
"Simply put, this is an amazing combination of drinkability and unique tastiness. It's got all the refreshing qualities of a good lager, with a whole bunch more. The aftertaste has a delicious creaminess that lingers on the palate and tickles my tongue. Every sip makes me want more. I have to say, I have never tasted a lager this good. Even though it traveled here all the way from England, it tastes as fresh as the day it was bottled. At around $10 for a four pack it's a bit pricey, but I find myself looking forward to the next time I can buy it non-the-less."
"D - Easy to drink, because there's not much to it. Just don't want to drink many of these."
"but samuel smith has never really done me wrong."
"D: One of the better EPL's. The lightness makes it an easy drinker. Not the most complex beer in the world, but a decent pickup overall."
"Pale lagers aren't my favorite kind of beers, but this was a well executed example of the style."
"Overall: I like this beer, it is a well crafted high quality lager. I could have stronger grain and malt in the flavor, but that is a personal preference. If you like lagers, try this beer."
"Pretty much everything Sam Smith brews is money and this is no exception. Even the simplest of styles comes out beautiful. Could drink buckets of this stuff."
"Overall a fine a very drinkable lager. A tasty summer slammer lawnmower beverage that also has some style. A good beer."
"Drinakbilty: Not as carbonated a the pure brewed lager by Samuel Smith but still quite active. Good lager better than 99% of lagers on the market."
"This was consumed in front of the grill on a real hot day, and it hit the spot. Clean crisp flavors, no off aftertaste. Solid beer. I'd buy again."
"Drinkability: Euro Pale laggers are usual a hateful thing. Even when they are good they are just ok. This brings flavor to the world of euro pale lagers. At the price though there are much better beers to have in both the lager and ale kingdoms respectively. A good take on a rather boring style"
"i would reccomend trying this one out, it's not bad, but i'm a ale/stout guy so it's not my fancy, but good for what it is."
"A very pleasant and well done lager, but those who think that it is the world's best one in the world... They have probably not been in Germany."
"Drinkability: even on a hot summer's day I'd rather have something with either more body or more carbonation and refreshingness. This has neither."
"A nice easy to drink lager. Tastes clean and flavorful. However, there's nothing special that sets it apart from the pack. A good one and worth a try but not an award winner."
"Mild carbonation and a smooth body make this a nice session lager."
"This beer has enough up front, but the finish is where its at. A touch light on the finish, but VERY smooth. Quite refreshing and carbonation is just enough to cover the beer through the finish. Oaty, fruity, malty finish that is just delicate enough to melt away in your mouth."
"Jordan."
"Drinkability is huge. This is a wicked refreshing lager. Easily among my favorite lagers, and something I'm probably going to buy a lot of this summer."
"It's not a flavor explosion but a crisp refreshing beer. Poured a golden yellow in my tulip glass with a fluffy white head. I have a weak nose, but really not picking up anything in the aroma department. The flavor was a crisp malt and subtle, yet spicy and with a little citrus and floral hop bitterness. Right level of carbonation and a really enjoyable refreshing beer. Impressed that an organic, which can have all sorts of off tastes, can be so fresh and clean."
"Definitely a good beer. I look forward to having this again sometime down the road."
"Drinkability: I love how this beer uses organic hops and barley to make this one up, reminds me alot of having a glass of cianti, the grape like aromas and taste make this one a good subsitute to your traditional wine pairings. Goes well with pasta and heavier meals. Overall, I enjoyed the flavorings and thought this one hit the mark. An excellent beer that makes you think about how much beer can take wine on head to head."
"Pours a very clear honey-yellow colored body, with an average white head, but diminishing. Some maltiness, spice. Fresh like hay or grass. Not much aroma. Laggerish taste, that same fresh plant smell. Clean aftertaste. Amost watery."
"I could certainly have a session of these but only if somebody else was paying. For my own hard earned I want a lot more."
"D: Stays true to its style, though it's definitely on the bottom of the list for me. I might have one this summer as it's easy to drink, but I can't say I'd reach for this over a wheat beer on a hot summer day."
"Probably my favorite lager i've tried, and I'd expect no less from Samuel Smith. Excellent with pizza."
"Drinkability: Very pleasant. Low alcohol makes it easy to have a few."
"Pours clear straw color with active carbonation demonstrated by swirling bubbles to a thick foamy white head that leaves a web of lace. This is a great looking beer. Good malt aroma with light malt and hay. Nice clean taste that is light and malty on the initial followed by a pleasantly lingering lightly bitter aftertaste that has a mild tobacco overtone. Really nice. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with an active carbonation that is just right, not overly so. This is very drinkable, goes great with indian food, pretzels, or just about anything that calls for a mild beer. This makes a fine one for a session as well. Nicely done."
"This is for sure a carefully crafted beer. They've struck a wonderful balance for a beer so crisp and clean. Extremely drinkable, medium-light flavor profile but pretty tasty. I probably wouldn't pay what they tend to charge for this beer in 4 packs, but I can't deny that it is a very good, drinkable lager."
"Drinkability- Nice lager, even nicer considering it's organic. Sammy does it again."
"D - Light and refreshing lager with a crisp, clean character and a nice floral hop profile. Certainly easy to drink though I don't think I'd have more than a couple pints."
"Overall really well done and the fact that it's organic is just an added bonus."
"Soft drinkable beer."
"I would buy this again."
"D - Simple and tangy. all around good example of a lager."
"Very bright straw color with decent lacing. The aroma is subtle, but lets you know it's a pale lager with a bit of grass. The flavor is snappy, but not sharp like a pilsner. Mildly sweet, but very clean. The taste isn't vastly superior to an average lager, but you can taste that this is a quality beer. It's crisp, which blends in with an ample carbonation making for a bright, effervescent but not overly bubbly mouthfeel. Not something I would buy (this was a gift) but nice to experience Sam Smith's take on a pale lager."
"Very light color..a thin straw-yellow...appearance is saved by a nice frothy head, reminiscent of cappuccino. A nice enough smell with mild citrus and sweet nilla wafer. Hmmmm...surprisingly thin flavor, yet oddly what is there is extremely well balanced -- sweet up front but a nice hoppy finish that helps keep the palate clean and refreshed. There just isn't enough of the flavor coming through. Could definitely drink these easily, especially on a hot day, but there are so many less expensive options that will deliver more flavor just as nicely."
"Style wise this beer is tops, have never been happier to drink a beer labled 'euro pale lager' in my life. As a session it is hard to beat, light, crisp, refreshing and complex without being pretentious. Fantastic beer, should be the benchmark for all other beers of this style. Drinking a beer like this makes me wonder why/how macro beer became what it is today. I suppose capitalism had something to do with it when companies realized they could make tons of money even after cutting back on more expensive ingredients. That being said though, I am willing to bet my paycheck that if you gave this beer to a stone cole BMC drinking in a blind taste test with the BMC product of thier choice they would choose this beer every time and then immediatly after realizing this they would commit suppoku for the unbearable amount of shame such a realization brings and spill their entrails right on the floor of the tasting room. That is how good this beer this."
"Overall: One of the best lagers I've had, being usually not a fan of beers that taste like macro-lagers."
"(rated Aug 14, 2008)"
"I've tended to find grassy/off flavors in organic brews. This beer lacks any of that. A boring style for me, but they nailed it. Kind of satisfying in a simple kind of way also. Has a nice crisp finish, but lacks any grainy or metallic bite to it that ruins so many lagers."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Dry crackery malt flavors appear up front, again, very clean and crisp. Slight sweetness appears mid-palate. Light bodied. Very light frutiness toward the finish, with a mild dry aftertaste that's faintly metallic and grainy. A damn fine lager, somewhat rough but in a good way."
"D- This is a refreshing session beer no doubt. Pretty delightful."
"D: On the whole, this beer wasn't bad. It's about as good as a lager's going to get. It's not the first beer style I'd choose."
"The taste is very nice, full bodied, with good light complexity. It has bread and grain, with a flowery herbal-lemon bitterness and some apple, great bitter-sweet balance, with strong malt taste transitioning into a pleasantly bitter, hoppy finish. Refreshing and tasty, it's very smooth and drinkable."
"A sessionable lager, and certainly respectable enough. Might serve as a good crossover brew, and would make a for a great fit on a summer's day, i should have enjoyed this one months ago."
"Moderate and unoriginal, but it is organic I guess. Light hops, not a bitter beer. Crisp, clean, mild, and well-rounded. Refreshing & easy drinking. It is a plain vanilla beer."
"Beer pours a pale straw with minimal head. The smell is of a light lager, not very impressive. The taste is very complex, sweet and light malt with a back end of hops. It leaves a nice feeling on the tongue. I could drink this all day and night. A beautiful beer. Beer leaves moderate lacing in the glass. I strongly recommend it, best example of its style I've ever had."
"I haven't come across a bad one yet."
"deac"
"Solid lager that doesn't fill you up. Not much on first impressions but well done."
"Slim 12 ounce bottle w/o freshness info. Pours quite light golden amber and very clear. Soft white head, retentive at the 1/8 of an inch level and leaving scattered lace upon a more then gentle swirl. The nose I pick up is of some grass, and lemony/floral mild hops. Pleasant and easy drinking. For the style its got generous hope bite up front riding over an undercoating of soft and friendly malts. Better then average interest here, nice beer to try out on your unfortunate macro swilling amigos. Bring on the spicy foods as this one has the crispness and bite to ""cut through"" the heat and fat. Worthy offering, dare I say ""one of my favorite Euro Pale Lagers"""
"This was a very good, but not the absolute best Lager that I have ever had. Nice head, that fairly quickly reduced, but the crown marked all the way down to the finish. Good and fresh smell, and mouthfeel was well above average. This will be a Lager that I will probably keep around, but not a staple. Very good drinkability."
"Drinkability: Subtle + Complex + low ABV = High Drinkability. A really tasty lager - one of the best I've had. Samuel Smith never disappoints."
"Probably one of the best organic brews I have ever had. It has a great balance of clean malts and hops. Very refreshing and solid beer."
"I'm not typically a huge Lager fan but I did enjoy this one. Golden color and pours a fairy nice thick white head. I'd say it lasts halfway through the beer, then it's gone. Mild sweet grassy aroma with malty notes. Very smooth tasting, fruity notes, grassy and a touch of hops mixed in. Solid Lager."
"bought in to complete the samuel smith line up ... a prettty decent lager ... a good bitterness level ... low lacing ... a good organic that dosn't remind me of hippies .. not much else to this beer, to sum it up: a simple non offensive organic-fad lager from tadcaster..5%.."
"First thing I noticed was the generous head this beer produced when poured that showed great retention and some lacing. Classic orange/gold color as a lager should have. Appealing citrusy aroma of hops. A little light in the mouth but exceptionally easy to drink. Balanced flavors of barley, hops and dry malts. A good session brew. A great addition to the organic market."
"D - Nothing wrong with the beer but not something I'd worry about getting again. The organic factor is good but there is plenty of local made beers that I'd rather drink."
"D - This is a great tasting Euro Pale Lager. I was really impressed with the sweet malty flavor."
"Drinkability: A very competent lager from Samuel Smith."
"The fact that this is an organically produced beer isn't much of a selling point for me, but it's definitely a worthwhile lager. Nice lemony color and a thin lacy head, lots of bubbles in the glass and in the mouth, and a fruity aroma and hoppy taste that go down easy on a summer day. Or any day, for that matter. A pleasant break from ales, I wish this came in a six pack!"
"Settled as a medium color gold with thin lacing and a thin head. Aromas are delicate wheat, bread, and hops. Taste has a great clean punch with a slight bittersweet hint. Mouthfeel was superior; incredibly crisp, refreshing, light and well balanced to keep flavor tight. Overall, a great lager."
"The only downside is the price. I paid $10 for a 4-pack ($2.50/bottle) in New York City. Ouch."
"D - High. Very high."
"Pours a pale gold with a tight white head that sticks around for a bit. The nose is fairly rich for a pale lager with a nice breadiness, some grassy hop aromas and a touch of light lemony/herbal citrus. Pretty light on the palate. The bready flavors have faded a bit, but there is still a nice clean graininess coupled with very light herbal and earthy hops. Not as much lager yeast tanginess as is often found, which gives the grain and the clean flavors of this lightly hopped beer to shine. Very smooth and easy to drink, I've converted a number of macro ddrinkers with this. The organic hook seems to work with a number of people. As some others have commented, this is the real deal, though. It is organic, which is laudable, but more importantly it is a fine tasting beer. Kudos."
"Soft carbonation speaks to a British touch and really allows me to focus on flavor. An easy choice for a session beer. I'm always wary of things labeled ""organic"" as they can be focused more on marketing than quality. Here, however, Sam Smith's delivers."
"Smooth and clean; well-carbonated and refreshing. Excellent drinkability."
"Overall, leagues ahead of most other Euro pale lagers and macro style beers I've had. The organic thing is great, and I think this could serve as a good gateway beer. As for me, I'm glad I tried it, and might suggest it to some friends that don't know a lot about beer, but I doubt I'll be picking it up again myself any time soon."
"Who knew the British could make a quality pale lager? This is not your average pale lager."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It boasts primarily of pale malts and lager yeast with a mild hop scent. The taste is good. It is clean and refreshing. It has largely a pale malt flavor with a light hop taste. It is light and highly drinkable. This is a low bodied beer with decent carbonation. This is the best lager you will have."
" This is easily one of he best Organic brews I've had and a very unique lager."
"Drinkability is very good, a great euro pale lager. Probably cost prohibitive to drink by the case, but it would sure beat Heineken or something if you wanted to switch it up for your non beer geek friends."
"The downfall, in my opinion, was drinkability. It begins taking on an acidic feel, and the leafy, almost grassy flavors don't sit well."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Everything about this beer screams drinkable, but the flavor isn't there for me."
"Verdict: Nice example of an organic lager. Smooth and drinkable like a lager should be."
"D - this one is really easy to drink."
"I'm looking forward trying other organically produced beers."
"The beer was light bodied and crisp with nice carbonation throughout. I would fit this into the session category with the second one tasting just as good as the first."
"A good, solid, no-frills brew that flirts with the notion of being a paradigm beer; and it's organic - for what that's worth. Good show!"
"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a Samuel Smith's imperial pint glass. Crystal clear golden color with a medium head that dissipated quickly and left hardly any lacing. Smelled like a standard lager - hops with a bit of citrus. Tasted extremely crisp on the palate. Fairly dry and light bodied. Nice hop flavor, a bit of sweet malt on the tip of the tongue, finishing nicely with a bitter aftertaste. Really crisp, clean brew."
"Pours a golden orange color with a watery white head. Not much lacing on the pint glass. Aroma is pretty standard lager, with clean grainy flavors, a hint of citrus, and a smooth sweetness. Flavor is much the same. The graininess is very clean and crisp, with some caramel to it. Hops come into play as a tart lemony citrus that's quite subdued. Mouthfeel is very smooth but the carbonation is a bit high. Clean, dry, and refreshing. Easy to drink."
"Poured a clear golden into a SA BL glass with a good finger of white head that falls into a decent blanket cover for a while and then disappears. A very mild aroma of sweet malt, a faint hop note and familiar lager yeast. Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, a grainy flavor with a little sweetness and a very faint hop bitterness. Crisp, clean finish. Very drinkable like many other pale lagers of this ABV range. Although I don't visit this style very often it is easily the best pale lager I've tried."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer.. no problem as session barring the price. I've had it 7-8 times over the years and all note point toward expensive but tasty."
"Overall I'd have to say that this is one of the best lagers I've ever tasted."
"Take away the skunky nose, this would be a superb lager. Although it was served in a brown bottle, this obviously had sat on the shelf for too long."
"Overall- My first organic brew. It was good and light with very refreshing factors. I enjoyed it and would drink it again on a hot day."
"Very light, two inch, carbonated head that settles quickly. Pours light gold and pretty much clear. Light bitter smell. Actually smells a little like a pilsner. Good fruity taste, they skimp on the malt. Im not particularly impressed with this beer, however, Im not a huge fan of lighter beers in general. You have to respect it as a good light lager. In fact, if you have a friend that refuses to drink anything except for miller light or bud light, introduce them to this. It might direct their taste toward the better beers."
"Had Samuel Smith's regular lager beer and wasn't too crazy about that one... it's amazing what prouducing a beer organically can do, because this one was the definite flip-slide... good appearance and smell coupled with a great taste was more in-line of what I was expecting from a good company like Samuel Smith... citrus and bready flavors that went down smooth as water... Recommended..."
"Not much of a lager fan and being organic still doesn't make much of a difference."
"I'd seen this for months at my local Trader Joe's, passing it by for other beers each time, and I can say that this beer will likely become my TJ's beer of choice."
"D = A nice refreshing lager, which could definitely serve as a session beer but for slightly too high an ABV or as the half of a half and half with a good solid stout."
"D: Good. I happy about this bloke beer."
"This organically produced lager is a wonderful beer! I followed the first 550mL with another 12oz that I had bought, and both were great."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, good representation of style, decent kick, this is one of the better organic beers that I’ve had, but there isn’t enough to it to make me choose it, unless I was limiting myself to just organic beers."
"A tasty ""thirst-quencher"". A nice, easy-drinking lager from England (a country and brewery known more for its ales than lagers). This one hits the spot, especially on a warm day. It reminds me, too, that I haven't tried the other lager that this brewery produces in a long time - will have to look out for it!"
"Pale yellow color. Decent level of head, but average retention. Smells slightly bitter, but nothing special. Tastes a little bitter, but there's a good balance of hops and malts. Could be drank over long sessions, but there's not much that keeps you coming back for more. It's a very average beer, overall."
"Quite drinkable too bad it is quite expensive too. As Organic goes this is about as good as it gets. Recommended for the experience and if you just have to drink organic beer sometime."
"Well, it basically tastes like a bland Dortmunder, so I guess that's on for the style. The aroma has hints of skunk, which doesn't seem to covering much up. The skunk carries over a bit in the flavor which mixes with a bit of grassy hops then mostly creamy malt with a touch of bread. Sure it's drinkable, if you don't mind paying over $4 for a large bottle. I give this a thumbs down, not emphatically, but still. And I am blaming the skunk on SS because it seems to be so consistent in their beers - even with a brown bottle."
"drinkability is great. this is not a heavy or complex beer, but a simple and crisp lager, which does what a euro pale lager should. very refreshing."
"Nothing bad to say about this one except the outrageous price! Gimme a break..."
"D- This is what a Heineken / Beck's should taste like!"
"Very drinkable given the right occasion and setting. I was suprised by this beer and will purchase again."
"Pours a ultra clear, ultra pale straw color. Thin head of small white bubbles. Aroma is spicy and earthy hops. First sip yields a balanced, yet hoppy flavor. Mild fruit and grain character. Clean and crisp. Mild bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great; not nearly as light as I expected from the appearance. Wonderful summer beer."
"550ml bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a creamy white head that quickly turns into a white lace. The aroma is grain, a slight biscuity flavor and hops. The taste starts out with a smooth malt flavor with a slightly spicey hop finish. Overall, this is a nice, clean and highly drinkable lager."
"Pours a big head that retains very well,and with al= wonderful lacing. The color is gold and clear. The head hasn't fallen past 1/4'' yet. The smell is pretty damn good, reminds me of the beer from Germany (My first English Lager). The smell is bready, but not over bready, it's slightly hopped as well which balances it very nicely. The taste is a little old. The hoppiness and the breadiness come at you at the same time. Mouthfeel was good, nothing bad there. Overall I would love to try this again, but I'd like to find a fresher bottle first."
"Not sure if I would have paid $60USD for the case but a damn fine beer nonetheless."
"Color of light straw with a thick creamy head. Smell of sweet malt, light hops and a slight note of honey. Taste has slight sweet malt that is clean and refreshing with a light body. An easy to go down lager that would be quinching on those warmer days."
"Overall, this is a light, refreshing and easy-drinking beer that serves as a nice palate cleanser with food."
"Clean and refreshing taste showing decent balance, marred only by a metallic tint at the finish. Maybe a little sweeter than I'd like but still crisp and drinkable. Another quality product from Sam Smith''s, showing that any style can be home to quality beer if the brewer has talent and cares."
"Overall, an above-average Euro lager, but very drinkable."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Refreshing. If it were not so pricey, I'd drink it more often. A special treat once and awhile."
"After pouring this lager that was a medium light yellow in color and very little foam, I was pleasantly happy with the flavor. I could taste the light hops and malts that wern't over powering or, like many others, tart and bitter. This was a very smooth and mellow Lager. This has to be one of my favorite Lagers and will drink more often. Other breweries should learn a lession here!"
"Overall, very easy to drink. A nice session beer."
"355ml brown bottle. Golden yellow translucent body with a quarter inch of white head. Smells sweet, fruity, and hoppy. Tastes sweet and malty, with some hop. Clean finish. On the lighter side of medium bodied, with a little less carbonation than one might expect. Still pretty damn good for the style, though I wouldn't expect any less from this brewery."
"This is has become a favorite to keep around for both myself and my father and I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a crisp lager."
"Not matter how the ingredients were grown, or where they came from, I found this to be a good lager under any circumstance and very good. An unremarkable appearance gave way to an interesting and layered taste."
"Sammy's organic lager is a pretty standard European-style lager: Clear golden body. Short cap of creamy white foam. Average head retention and better than average lacing. Grassy and lightly floral hops in the nose. Medium-bodied and crisp on the palate. Straightforward malt and hop blend in the flavor, seemingly Hallertauer or Tettnanger. A touch of mineralish character. Solid bitterness beneath. Well-balanced. The fact that it's organic lends it point and helps to balance it's extra cost, but for the most part there are better golden lagers out there for less."
"One of the very best lagers I've had. Exceptionally well-made. Irresistable."
"Picked up a 550 ml bottle at Trader Joe's in Geneva. Chilled to 45 F. Poured a medium-light yellow with an unremarkable loose white head, which dissipated quickly. Aroma was faint and unremarkable for a European pale lager. Flavor was of subdued malts and nice English hops playing off each other in a retrained and genteel manner. The body of this beer is rather light, which with the evident but moderate hops bitterness makes for a very sessionable brew. At 3 bucks for slightly over a pint, it's not a bad value, but I'd rather enjoy some of SS other more assertive offerings for that price. For a pale lager fan, this is a very well balanced brew."
"The mouthfeel is tangy and light bodied. This is a unique lager that is unexpectedly good."
"This is an interesting lager... the flavor is definitely not what you'd expect, and this is anything but a generic beer. Plus it helps the planet, so bonus points there :) This is the first time I've approached this beer, but it's definitely something I'll be picking up again. Another great beer from Sam Smith's."
"Pours light and clear with a reasonably fluffy white head. The smell is crisp and clean, mainly grain. Taste was no suprise, mainly grains with a touch of hops. Aftertaste was a little sweet, but overall nice and clean with only a hint of fruity tartness. Mouthfeel was light, but not so light it was water. For the style, this is really great stuff. Plain, simple, no frills. This is what so many other crappy lagers should taste like."
"An average brew. Not bad but nothing exciting. If you want to support organic products then this is a good beer for you."
"Oh yeah, the stick waving mob of skirted girls. Turns out a bar regular has a connection to the local high school field hockey team who won their 3rd connsecutive state championship whilst I sat on my bar stool, so he bought a round for the house! Thanks girls!"
"2.	It is not a style that is high on my radar."
"I have had this lager twice this year, once at my brothers house and once, last week, at a local beer watering hole. I find this to be a very pleasant, tasty, and enjoyable lager. It's easy to drink, yet has more chartacter and flavor than your basic lager you would find in the US that is mass produced. Good when it's cold, but as it warms up it developes a nice malty smell and flavor. In the past I have not paid attention too much to English beers, but this is an example that has changed my mind, I will be sampling more in the future. I would recommend this beer."
"Drink this beer when you just want to chill out."
"Damn nice clean lager....very nice. Samuel Smith has yet to disappoint me and once again, Tad delivers. From the 550ml brown bottle it poured a beautiful deep yellowish golden colr and a firm one finger head that faded to a thin layer that lasted about 3/4 of the drink...nice lacing throughout. My initial thoughts on aroma were floral and bit sweet, a touch of grain and not the usual lager smell that I'm used to...what a relief. Tastes were a very nice balance of slight hoppy bitterness up front followed by a grainy malty smoothness....golden. A bit of grassiness in the flavor, but just a touch. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, smooth and not too dry. Primo lager in my book, yes ma'am, I'll have another."
"Drinks pretty easy, nothing too complex here, but good for a few pints to be sure"
"Poured from the bottle to a golden yellow color, with medium thick white head, that lasted for most of the glass, and left good lacing. Aroma is very hoppy, with a hint of floral. Taste is more hops, with no real recognizable flavor jumping out. Palte is on the dry side, but not bad. I have tried several Samuel Smith beers, and while most are decent, I dont find any to be outstanding, and this fits in that same mold."
"This is quite a refreshingly tasty brew; I did not quite know what to expect from this beer, but am pleasantly surprised. I really like the light honey note that runs throughout this beer; it is a nice mix of organic malt and hops."
"Overall - An OK lager.... Nothing spectacular but worth a try...."
"Drinkable? Yes. Have a few, no problem."
"I dont think that Ive been disappointed with any of the Sam Smiths products, and this, although no star, was also no exception. The beer is clear and golden, with a thick white, lace producing head. The aroma is clean and a bit malty, with some graininess. Theres a herbal hop aroma as well. The taste is similar, lightly sweet and a bit malty, with some fleeting caramel flavors. Hops come out stronger in the taste. Soft mouthfeel, with a medium body. Its well rounded and very smooth. The brew is not complex and not extremely interesting, but its very well done and very enjoyable."
"Poured a clear straw yellow, decent size head. Aroma was very mild, I only picked up a slight hop scent, maybe citrus? Taste was very well balanced, with a slightly bitter dominance. The mouthfeel was very smooth, carbonation added a nice crispness to it overall. An easy to drink beer that I enjoyed while working the grill."
"CRUX: GOOD LAGER. Very good drinker, and the best organic beer I ever had."
"Another fine one from Samuel Smith's. I must admit, I was unsure of what to expect from ""organic lager", but saying ""Tadcaster"" on the bottle reassured me that I would not be dis-satisfied. It poured a medium orange gold colour with a snow white foamy head that lasted approximately 90 seconds or so. The liquid was crystal clear with a steady stream of carbonation bubbles trailing towards the surface. A lovely sight, indeed. The smell was a bit malty, and perhaps a bit biscuity. The wonderful English hop varietal aroma that I enjoy so much was present, as well. The taste was terrific. Faintly, faintly sweet with mostly bitterness / dryness dominating. The mouthfeel was light weight and smooth; very easy to drink. A fantastic lager and wonderful product from Sam Smith!"
"Great Beer. Period."
"A very drinkable lager. As far as organic though, I really can't tell the difference."
"Drinkability: Well, this isn't great, but you could do a hell of a lot worse for the style. Perfect for kicking off a session."
"D- This is a very average beer. There is very little flavor to offend anyone or interest anyone either. I feel like adding some fruit to give it some flavor."
"Haven't had a Sammy Smith in quite a while, but I've been digging the English beers lately, so it's about time. Man, how did they get this beer so clear? Perfect clarity in this straw colored beer, with a decent white head, which fades slowly. Sweet malt in the nose, with plenty of grains and a dry English hoppyness. Very sweet in the taste too, as the malt takes over up front. Grainy too, and even slightly fruity, and ripe. Hops take a backseat here, but they are actually there, dry, dusty, and spicy. Very smooth and drinkable, and not at all light. Not as crisp as some lagers, but it's more well rounded. Perfect for and early spring day, with just a bit of warm weather starting to speak up on us."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. The flavor is mild enough to make this a pretty enjoyable session beer. I like how the British hops are a major player, and that is not something that you get to enjoy too often, as the majority of British styles are ales. It is an interesting mix to get to try them showcased like this. This isn't my absolute favorite beer, but it is different enough that I will probably be drinking it again in the near future."
"This is a pleasant, unassuming beer. It is yellow-orange in color with a fairly thick white head. It has a sweet, fruity odor, mostly of apples (almost a cany apple smell). The taste is sweet, mildly fruity, with a little caramel there too. A nice beer, but not outstanding."
"A solid Lager beer that doen't exactly fit the Lager flavor profile. Looks predictably straw / golden with a fluffy white foamstand. Smells much more malty and fruity than expected from a Lager. Flavors of apples, peaches, pears (of the almost-bruised variety) and with a bold maltiness about it. Barley, a little caramelly (typical of English beers) and bready. Sweet malt character and estery fruitiness takes away from the crispness or refreshing Lager quality, but substitutes it with better malt character and complexity. Still a bit grainy with a lightly oily finish."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a frothy white head that leaves a little lace and a little film. The smell is mostly some mildly sweet maltiness with the faint aromas of hops. The taste is also mildly sweet along with some hops. There is also a tad bit of spiciness. There is a good mouthfeel and a good carbonation. Overall this is a good easy drinking beer. especially as the weather gets warmer."
"Decent enough. I guess it would be the lager I would reach for if I needed a lager and wanted to save the world and buy organic."
"Delicious - I actually honestly didn't have great hopes for this, but this is a really, really good lager! Definitely in there with the top two or three I've ever had. I wish I had more!"
"Came in a 550ml bottle (brown, I wish they would put the rest of their line in this type of bottle), poured a nice light orange color with a thick fluffy white head. No off smells in the aroma, taste is pretty good for a European lager. This is one of the first organic beers I've had, and I think its pretty good. Give it a try."
"An enjoyable organic lager. I could probably drink a bunch of these...if not for the $4 price tag."
"I could have many of these, easilly."
"A good beer, if this style's your cup of tea."
"Overall, I find this a more drinkable beer than you'd expect. It's light and easy, and good enough quality to make it quite quaffable. I've been known to drink these straight from the bottle when I just need a relaxing beer -- this is sort of a nice ""Bud Light"" for me. It's a bit expensive to call a cheap lager, but a decent lager it is."
"Overall: An above average lager, though somewhat pricey."
"On the dryer end of the my handy lager scale otherwise known as my palate. Easily a top notch sessioner and would pair nicely with a light meal."
"For this style, which is usually given a pretty short leash amongst BAs, I would say this is one of the best. Highly recommneded."
"pours a very nice golden honey color with a thick frothy two inch head that slowing dissapates leaving a mild amount of lacing down the sides...not much as far as the scent goes but what is there is mildly hoppy...the taste is very clean and crisp with the malts being the first thing that comes through to my palate...enjoyable...i can definatley suck down a few if not more"
"Drinkability: Light and sweet, yet quite refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day or when something lighter is simply in order."
"Drinkability: I want another one. For a brew with such little flavor, I find this to be very satisfying. Great session beer."
"Looks like a regular pale lager when poured into the glass, light golden with a small white head, some laceing as the beer goes down. Again the aroma is average for a good lager, slight grassy hoppiness and some malts. It s rather thin in the flavour department but the well done carbonation makes up for it. It is quite a sweet lager with a tang of perfumy /flowery hopiness, I also get a slight hint of pear flavour for some reason. Overall its quite a nice lager and very drinkable."
"Medium bodied lager with a sweet, grain presence. The sweetness is similiar to that of honey. Nice snap finish. A tad more hoppy than most lagers that I have had. Clean and refreshing which lead to a good drinkability level."
"A pale lager all the way. Nice straw gold coloring with a white head that leaves some lacing in the Imperial pint glass I crammed this beer into. Well I must say nice brown bottle too. Anyway is smells decent with an acidic edge popping through the head a little deeper is some malt and a lager yeast smell. The taste is killed for me by the heavy metal salt taste, but after fighting through the metal the is a decent malt base that yeilds up a tasty floral hop finish. After I got over the metallic zing, it was ok."
"Darn good stuff!!"
"Overall: A little pricy, but hey it is a quality Yorkshire Beer and as a Tyke that matters to me. I am not sure that I could ever differentiate Organic beers form erstwhile brethren, but I guess that is not the point. Even so, of the ones that I have tried, this is one of the best Organic brews out there, and by far the best Organic Lager Beer. Despite its pricey tag, I always sample this great brew once in a while. York-shire!!!"
"Taste is full of goodness- spicey, sweet, sour- crackers in there? wouldn't think it would fit, but it does- also some honey- very well-balanced and complex, very tasty. Some hops and bitter in the background. Mouthfeel is smooth and chewy, and the bubblyness works its way in. Pretty drinkable- a clean, tasty, refreshing brew, one that everyone should try."
"As compared to many other lagers out there, think home grown vegetables as opposed to grocery store or frozen vegetables. There is a difference."
"A fine lager, better than many pils in Germany and the continent. Better than the other lager from Sam Smith, too."
"It's been awhile since I had a lager. Pours a golden/yellow with a two finger head which disipates quickly, but leaves a nice lacing. Taste is very nice not to full with a light feel. Not too malty or hoppy. Many of these can be drunk if you do not watch yourself, LOL."
"Drinkability and Notes  One of the better pale lagers that I have had, but this is a category that I normally avoid because of the lack of complexity and excitement. This is a fine summer beer or a good choice to give to a friend who normally drinks Heineken or the like."
"Pale yellow with a good lace for a head. Head retention is good for the style. The aroma is typical Euro pale lager. Clean grassy grains and some hoppy herb. Taste fairly clean. Sweet malty flavor hits the tounge at first and is balanced well with some mild hops. Clean grainy aftertaste and a great drinkability. A very tasty Euro lager."
"First time having and reviewing this one, although I enjoy their regular lager. Appearance is very nice: bright, golden, rising small bubbles, with puffs of white head that resemble a petri dish. Aroma doesn't seem too bad, but a deep whiff brings up some sweetness, a little bit of jelly beans. Tastewise, I am not picking up as much sweetness as indicated by the aroma. It's actually pretty refined grainyness, with maybe just a touch of honey in the end. I do enjoy the mouthfeel, medium with nice, small, not overwhelming carbonation. I have to say the drinkability is decent, and I would drink another right now if I had one."
"A beautiful beer."
"Drinkability: I could drink this bitch all night. I'd like to try more organic beer."
"Easy to drink, very crisp, only bad thing was the aftertaste reminded me of a certain silver bullet."
"Decent example of a traditional lager, I'd say. May be a bit pricey at close to $4 for a 550 ml bottle, but it's refreshing."
"This is pretty good beer, all things considered. It's far from the best pale lager that I've ever had, but then it's equally far from the worst. While it's much more expensive than the regular offerings from the Big 3, it's also a much, much better beer. ""You get what you pay for"" isn't always true, but in this case, it's right on the money."
"This is one smooth lager. It pours gold -nice head--stays for a while-lvs some moderate lace. The smell is mild malt-- a basic lager beer. It tastes like a very straightforward gold beer. I wish they sold this at Fenway. This is a beer that would be good to give to a bud drinker and see if they can be converted to better beer. The mouthfeel is a little dry but not unpleasant. Drinkability--oh yeah--you could have a bunch of these as long as you dont get bored with the flatness which is so common in many British beers."
"Nothing impressive. Really a let down from a usually superlative brewer."
"Pours a golden, light amber color with a decent-sized head. The smell is about the same as most mainstream lagers- it's grainy, and it has a slightly sweet-smelling presence. The taste is sweet and malty, and it's extremely simplistic compared to other Samuel Smith beers that I've tried. It's smooth and drinkable, but I was hoping something a little more interesting."
"Simply put, this is a good lager."
"Drinkability: Good quaffing lager with almost no real weaknesses."
"This was poured from a 550l bottle.The color was a whiter shade of pale gold. It had a very decent head that lasted a pretty good while.An Average well balanced aroma and taste.But, I did a side by side with their pure brewed lager ,and, I had high hopes for this one, becauseI do believe we ingest way too many chemicals. Unfortunately I think this came out fairly weak.The carbonation seemed flat and overall ,not very interesting.Organic is a nice idea ,but , this one ain't working for me."
"Drinkability: While I'm no real fan of the style, this is quite a good example of it, I could drink this again."
"The lager poured a nice gold with a small white head. It's aroma is a pleasant, but faint, mix of malt and hops. It has a good malty taste with a well done hoppieness that shows up in the finish. It's medium bodied and is slightly oily and has a dry finish. A good beer, but not a match for Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager. This beer seems to be a weaker copy of it in all but appearance."
"A nice refreshing lager"
"Update  I originally review this with an 04 vintage so thought Id give it another crack with an 06. Id say definitely lighter than medium-bodied for sure, but otherwise this is just the way I remember it. I have a few of these over the course of a year, especially when the winter weather first breaks. Its a great way to celebrate springs arrival."
"Wow what a lager. Pours a nice pale yellow with a nice foam head, lacing will linger on the glass. The smell uprfront has floral tones mixed with fresh fruit, a very clean nose. The taste is smooth and refreshing. The fruit taste is so pleasant with the subtle sugared grain that you can't help but raise the glass over and over. Light bodied and very pleasant, god bless this beer."
"Poured out a golden color with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell is straight forward. Malts, grassy, barley-like aromas. It was pretty clean and crisp. Taste was quite decent. Sweet malts hit the palate and then blend in with some slight hop flavors with a grain like aftertaste. The aftertaste was slightly buttery as well, but not too powering. This beer won't knock off any socks, but the taste is pretty decent and could be a great fall back beer. Perhaps you'll notice the organic part by the very crisp and clean taste, but seemed like any other lager out there. Decent enough though."
"D&N: Originally bought this one for the gimmick factor of an ""organically produced"" beer, but leave it to Sam Smith to make a darn fine brew. The weather is a bit warm today, and this one really hits the spot. Nicely done, Sam."
"A very nice brew...I am not a lager fan, but I was intrigued by the Organic lable..so I gave it a try. Appearance was a crystal clear yellow, nicely carbonated with a nice head that left some lacing on the side of the glass. Smell was a nice malt aroma with some earthy and fruity undertines. Taste was malty and lightly sweet with a hint of hops on the finish. Mouthfeel was excellent with a smoothness and crispness balance that was very refreshing. Extremely easy on the palate...very drinkable."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"If you see it, give it a try."
"Good beer, not quite as interesting as some of Samuel Smith's other offerings, but quite enjoyable."
"Golden with an enthusiastic head which diminishes slowly. A very slight haze was present. The aroma offered up hops and doughy yeast, a sign of a quality lager. Hop and malf flavours are well-balanced, and this beer tastes crisp and has a clean 'bite'; another sign of a quality lager. I'm not the biggest fan of bottom-fermenting beers usually, but this is top quality and enjoyable."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It boasts primarily of pale malts and lager yeast with a mild hop scent. The taste is good. It is clean and refreshing. It has largely a pale malt flavor with a light hop taste. It is light and highly drinkable. This is a low bodied beer with decent carbonation. I think this is an outstanding lager; probably one of the best I've had."
"In summary, a good beer but not quite as impressive as the Pure Brewed Lager. Certainly better than most macro-swill. I would think that this would really appeal to the health-concious and the stricter vegan types. Another good beer from Samuel Smith's."
"Poured a light, golden tone with just a hint of cloudiness and a fine frothy white head--just what one might expect from a lager. I could smell the wheaty aroma most clearly, and there was a hint of ginger. Both of these were in evidence at the initial tasting, but the taste went flat quickly, and there was little follow-up, just a touch of bitters. The consistency was thin, but sparkling. A good lager."
"A very tasty lager, much better than I expected. Easily the best english lager I've had the pleasure of drinking. Absolutely Fabulous."
"Light gold color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A medium bodied lager. Mild malts and fairly aggressively hopped. Full flavor. Good taste. Clean, crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Dayton, OH AleFest:A light bodied beer whose palate was smooth and somewhat thin.It had a small size white head that contained fine sized bubbles that mostly diminished.The body was clear and there was carbonation observed.The nose was malty, fruity and sweet with a light bitter flavoring.There was nothing really all that special about this beer as it needs to have more character in order for it to be an enjoyable beer in my opinion."
"Organically produced eh?....well it pours a glowing golden amber crystal clear tone with an exubriantly white full vivacious head very bubbly in a good way lacing is left in thick tuckets great appearance for a lager. Aromatics are grassy lemony sweetness with a not full on aromatic but nice and mellow touch of hops not bad. Flavor is crisp with a bready malt characteristic easy drinking and enjoyable on this humid day the hops come through with just enough bitterness. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with mellow carbonation solid beer. Drinkability for the price I don't think I could justify buying this beer regularly, but hey it has satisfied my beer craving and for that I thank thy beer."
"Let's see here. I'm not particularly fond of organic food or drink (even though it is much better for the environment) nor an I too fond of lagers. So why did I get this? I don't know, it seemed interesting enough and might be good during these hot summer days. So I bought one and drank it a week ago. It tasted sort of grassy but not in a bad way. Malts are weaker than the hops which aren't that aggressive either. But this is smooth and goes down easy. I probably won't get this again but it wasn't too bad."
"Rich gold appearance with a trace of a fluffy 1/8 of an inch head that lasts for a short time and laces practically not at all. Nice nutty candy bar aroma, some almond, some buttery diacetyl. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, mild carbonation, and an accurate reflection of the malt aromas in the taste statement. The hopping seems too ""tight"" to properly balance this beer throughout, it seems more apparent in the aftertaste than in the mouth. Overall, a very enjoyable Lager here."
"Light golden in color with a nice thin, foamy head. Grassy and light hops on the nose. A tender balance of malt and hops, but rather mellow. Light bodied, lacks good quality for the style, it is clean and rather refreshing, but not the best that Samuel Smith has produced."
"This beer was a hazy or cloudy deep yellow with a minimal white head. There was also minimal lacing effect. The nose is of malt and there hints of hops lurking there as well. The flavor is a nice malt and grain with nice light hop balancing. This is a nice beer with a decent body and feel. Very drinkable with a clean, pleasant finish. My sense is that this is a very well balanced and thought out formula."
"This is perhaps one of the most drinkable lagers on the planet...perhaps the entire universe. Pours out a deep golden color with a puffy and foamy white head. The lace lingers and fades slowly, leaving spotty traces. The aroma is of sweet caramel malt; a faint whiff of fruit and light floral hops arouses the senses. The lightly herbal and slightly sweet malt is a perfect compliment to the citrusy and tea-like hops. This heavenly liquid is balanced, rounded and smooth, but flavorful. The complexion and flavors change ever so subtly as the glass warms and the change is good. One is not enough!"
"Drinkability/notes: I had rather low expectations for this beer; prior to trying it, the ""organically produced"" statement concerned me, as if it were the reason for producing this beer. These concerns proved unwarranted, this is a very good beer, organically produced or not."
"It poured a nice yellow color with somewhat of a head. But the taste, typical. It tasted like Bass. Non-eventful, perhaps they should add some non-organic ingrediants and ""spice"" it up. That's the ticket! Maybe some industrial strenghth hops."
"I hope this wasn't just an afterthought for one of my favorite brewery's in the world. There is no reason that I know of why an ""organic"" beer should taste any different than a...what...""synthetic"" (?) beer. But this has an overall much more rustic, awkward character than Tadcaster's other Lager. Notes of pine-infused water, brick dust, and ragweed adorn respectable lager texture and glycerin. For the finish, which manages to come into decent balance, I say it is pretty drinkable."
"The fact that it is organically made is a plus of sorts. Not a typical clear Samuel Smith bottle, another plus of sorts."
"Cheers!"
"On the pour an opalescent gold color with a modest sized head, the lace is a fair sheet to cover the glass. Nose is malt, slightly earthy, clean and crisp. Front is slightly malt sweet, the top skimpy, the finish is purposefully acidic, hops are meaningful, the aftertaste dry and long lasting. As I normally don't care for lagers/pils, this one is clean and fresh, and a good beer for the ""Long Hot Summer Months""."
"Golden glowing lager juice sports a thin top and a few skeletal lace fingers. Breakfast in bed as the aromas of toast, a wedge of melon and a fresh mum drift through your nose. Less sprightly than your typical lager makes for prompt and easy drinking. A fine, toasted malt base flows into a loamy hop flavor that turns a mild bitter and strolls across the backsides of your tongue. Good stuff."
"By far, the BEST lager I have ever tasted. Clear golden color underneath a beautiful fluffy white head that won't go away and sticks all over the glass. Aroma is somewhat spicy, almost that of a Belgian ale. Good malt character, and a smoothness to kill for. Slight hop flavor towards the end. This is what all American lagers wish they could be."
"Light straw color. Pillowy white head. Bready, light grain aroma. Plenty of flavor packed into this light brew. Biscuity malt flavor with oily but reserved hops. Carbonation nips at the throat. Light mouthfeel. An appreciation for a fine lager like this should not be understated. A quality brew."
"Pale golden color and clear as possible.  Fruit and flowers dominate the nose and flavor.  Good mouthfeel and nice finish.  Definitely worth checking out as it is a pretty unique beer.  Just beer worried about skunked bottles as the bottles are clear."
"Its good to know that there are good organic beers out there, as for buying this again it is more of a novelty item. No great shake here, just a good drinking lager."
"a great clean lager. lighter in color and smooth down the chute. my first experience with an organic lager, and it was a good one. it was great like sam smith's lager, but this was toned down."
"Golden in color and slightly hazy.  It's topped with a head that dissipates readily. The mild noble hop nose is herbal, a touch spicy, unassertive, and is coupled w. a mellow graininess.  The aroma is pleasant overall.  Lightly bodied. Soft, bready malt flavors and mild sweetness is very well balanced by hop bitterness.  Hop flavor, although secondary, seems a bit grassy. The finish is clean and mildly grainy.  This is a lightly bodied and flavorful brew, but seems more like a Dortmunder Export rather than a Helles, since it was a touch shy on malt character."
"Frothy golden, slightly hazey, bit of sediment in the glass.  When pouring it's almost like looking through water.  Raw barley, clove, ginger on the nose.  The flavors on the palate have strong resemblance to the scent on your nose.  Crisp? Yes.  Refreshing? Definately.  Healthy? I'd like to think so."
"Thanks to Merchant Du Vin for the fresh sample."
