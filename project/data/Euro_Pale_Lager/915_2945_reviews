"Seems to me like this is a pretty bad Kiwi beer that gets mass produced and focuses on export and marketing. I am not a fan"

"Skunkayyyy! For some reason, I have always enjoyed the pure skunkaliciousness of Steinlager. Its a lager that hits you in the nose and mouth. Once you get past the initial assault, this beer disappears in a hurry and leaves a barely noticeable hop trace. I'm a sucker for beers in green bottles (Moosehead, Henry's Blue Boar, the original Rolling Rock), so it's no wonder that I fall for this beer from time to time."

"I feel that this beer would not outsell Most American lower level beers. In fact I can't even decide what flavors are in this beer."
"Seriously, I am not a fan of euro lagers. It may be great, but it tastes like bad Heineken."

"Overall: excellent and well done pale lager. Would like to try it from a can or on tap to see if the initial skunk is not present."
"Very basic type beer. Reminds me of a basic US domestic beer. Not something I would normally choose to be honest. Pretty smooth with little flavor. A bit spicy and almost grassy type aftertaste. Nothing special. Would not miss it if I never drank it again."

"Nothing special about this one, just your typical refreshing and drinkable lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not terrible. It's slightly above average in the Euro Lager category. The hop taste and bitterness are a little more aggressive than is the norm for the style."
""
"Pass for me, nothing to see. Get the Steinlager Pure instead, if you can find it - It's very superior to this."
""

"its the Bud of New Zealand. in Oklahoma its here today and gone tomorrow. really. they cant keep it on the shelves and have a hard time finding it to replenish it. there are a few beer Pubs that carry it, and thats where you have to go to get it because the Liquor Stores don't carry it all the time. and did i tell you thats its a perfect all around beer..."
"Overall: Just about as average as it comes for this style. You can picture it in your mind before you drink it, and then what do you know - exactly that. Although I guess in some ways that's not a bad thing?"
""
"The Verdict: Average. A drinkable yet forgettable lager, pretty much like any mass produced swill from the big brewers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Reminds me of a run of the mill Euro Lager. Drinkable but there are much better beers available in NZ."
""
""
""
"As expected to be honest, a basic and cheap lager that isn't quite as bad as some of the mass produced ones I've tried over the years. It's not great but it is by no means the worst and it was pretty easy to drink. Definitely not one worth picking up but not quite drain pour either thankfully."

"O/D - Pretty clean and strandard for a macro lager. Lacks the corny grossness that alot carry with them. Cheap and inoffensive."
""
"This beer seems to remind me of a lesser quality Budweiser."

"O: The flavors are good at first, but then they do not finish strong. Still an average beer."
""
"O: Definitely fits the style. Refreshing, but nothing special. A little too much bitterness for me even if I did enjoy the creaminess. Probably best consumed cold and out of the bottle."
""
"Overall - A good representation of a euro pale lager by NZ Breweries. The intensity of the grains/malt flavours make this lager stand out from similar brews in this style. Nothing fancy, but definitely for a hot summer day."
"O - Don't bother, just more macro piss water."
""
""
"Weak sauce - bland with unsavoury undertones. Watery and characterless. Avoid."

"Served cold and poured a smallish, white, thick head that settled down and some lace. Color is a clear yellow with some bubble trails. Aroma is mild, beery. Flavor is bolder than nose, with hop bitter coming out, a hint of sweet, and strong carbonic tang. Body is ok, carbonation sharp. Finish is like flavor with bitter/tang dominating and slowly tapering after some time. Not really for me."

"Pours a clear, straw color. 7/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pale malt, grain, slight hops, hint of sweet malt, and a sulfur aroma. Fits the style of an Euro Pale Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, slight hops, hint of sweet malt, and slight sulfur. Overall, good appearance and everything else is tainted by the sulfur aroma and taste."
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a puffy 1 inch white head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, grassy notes, and slightly like some cooked vegetables. Taste is of sweet grains, grass, and some citrus zest on the finish. Very mild bitterness on the tongue after each sip. A pretty good level of carboonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good European style lager. Not too shabby."
"Overall: This needs to be cold, it can be very enjoyable. What sets this apart from others is the dryness that keeps is crisp and refreshing but highly drinkable."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. Would be interesting to compare to American industrial lagers, whether any of them are flirting with this touch of hops. Or compare with Sam Adams Light."
"This is a good european style pale lager. It's not bad, but not great either. This bottle was somewhat skunky, thanks to the green bottle, but I like the bitterness of euro lagers, so I was willing to give it a pass. First beer from New Zealand, and somewhat unremarkable. I'd drink another if someone gave it to me, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"large bottle. clear, fizzy yellow liquid, fairly heady. Aroma of euro hops, tettnang/saaz, light skunky profile. Tastes like a clean lager with the hop presence, medium bitterness and a bready sweetness that lingers. An unoffensive, accessible lager that easily quenches a sun drenched day."
"Steinlager is a lot like as Becks, or a Stella to me. This beer is a golden yellow looking brew that has a quick dissolving white head on it. The aroma of malts and some hops are the basic aromas that I get from this beer. The flavor of this beer is grains and some grass, there's a little bit of a hop kick in there but not much at all. This mouthfeel is light and fairly crisp. It's a decent social beer. Not much complexity or anything like that."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Pours very pale yellow with a decent white head and some nice lacing. Smells of grassy hops and biscuits. Flavour is similar but quite thin, leaving very for the otherwise dry finish. Some sweet malts come through in the middle with notes of apple and some subtle citrus. Thin on the palette...not too much going on here. On the plus side, for a relatively generic Pale Lager, it's very refreshing and I can see it making a decent lawn-cutting beer."
"An average pale lager for the price ($3) but I guess I lucked out and dodged the skunk on this one."
"T - attempting to ignore the skunkiness, this beer is crisp and, for a lager, hoppy."
"12 oz into a snifter...pale yellow with a decent head. Right away, I notice that that 'lager funk' is missing. Tells me their lager yeast strain isn't that awesome, it doesn't get the nose. However, this is a very clean brew with an exceptional mouthfeel that goes down very easily. Not a champion brew, but it sure is getting trashed by reviewers. I'm pretty critical of bad beers but this is certainly no adjunct crap, it's just not that amazing either. If it's not a bad price, you might want to grab this one time, but if there are some good craft pils on the shelf for a similar price, I probably won't buy this again."
"This is an ok example of the style, perhaps lacking some of the malt backbone to counter the bitterness."
"Overall, this is a typical Euro Lager. Taste is mediocre but easy to drink, glad I didn't get a skunked bottle. Would recommend if you want to try a New Zealand beer, otherwise to expensive."
"D: Easy to drink. Not as bold as some, but balanced and clean."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style pale lager."
"overall totally shocked by this one, but in a fantastic way. wahat a damn good beer on a hot night, i could have drank a half dozen of these."
"Bottle purchased from The Beer Emporium, Sandbach. Poured into glass slight head soon dissipated, colour was pale straw. Smells strongly of malt. Taste was a pleasant surprise, a good bodied well balnced taste with a good caramel / malty base. Alcohol was well hidden. Carbonation was adequate without being excessive. I found myself quite enjoying this lager."
"I cant say the drinkability is high because between the odor and the fact that its nothing special I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy a different beer of this style."
"D: Blech, this may have been a bad bottle, but from reading some of the other reviews, it seems like it's just bad overall."
"Overall -above average Euro Pale lager, which isn't saying that much but it isn't bad for the style. Nothing to seek out but in a pinch, it works."
"surprised its not more popular, a solid macro."
"Steinlager is continuously in the most underrated beer category in the world! Sure, it is a common, easy to find beer, brewed in a large brewery, but that doesnt make it a BUdweiser or MGD. There are large breweries that make outstanding mainstream beers i.e. Heineken, Hollandie, Stella Artois, Peroni, etc. This is not a unique beer, just a good ol fashioned good lager beer. If you like Heineken and beers like that, you will fall in love with Steinlager."
"Drinkability: Sure, very drinkable, but totally unremarkable. Not bad, but the fact that it begins literally almost flavorless (more-so than any light beer or BMC stuff I've had) is a huge turn off."
"Drinkability - Could finish it, but it frankly wasn't that pleasant"
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple inches of white head. It is pale yellow in color. The aroma was an immediate turn off. I get a skunked, grassy smell. It comes in a green bottle so the smell was expected. The taste is metal, sweet malt and finishes a nasty bitter. This is not a beer to be revisited unless it is on tap. I need to quite trying these imported green bottled beer. I don't think I've had a good one yet. On tap is a different story since kegs shouldn't get light damage. Of course then there's temperature . . ."
"Sweet grains remind me of corn syrup, but the beer tastes like it might be all barley. Not much hops in here, but does have a slight drying effect on the finish. Fruitiness in a lager is a bit of a turnoff. Malts provide a full-ish body, but doesnt really do much for the beer. I am not digging this much and am working hard to finish the 25.4 ounces. I seem to remember this tasting much better while in Hawaii 10 years ago...go figure."
"It is drinkable, but that's about all."
"Its not the worst beer i have had, but its close..."
"Good effervescence, medium bodied. Overall, just OK at best, not worth spending any of your money on."
"Just a quick review for this one. Basically an average beer for it's style. Light gold color, fluffy white head with good retention. Grainy, grassy aroma and flavor. Very carbonated and light body. Easy and smooth drinkability. At $2.50 for a 25oz bottle, this would be a good grab for a quick, easy beer to go with a sandwich for lunch and still be able to function the rest of the day. Not a bad beer, worth a shot."
"Overall- It is nothing really special. It is defintely different for sure. I wouldn't mind giving this one another try because I haven't had it since that time in the dorm and that was two years ago and my pallete has matured over that course of time. The problem is I can never seem to find it around here it seemed like a one time thing. It is not worth seeking out but if you ever come across it for a decent price it is atleast worthy of a try. As far as pale lagers go it isn't the worst I have had. I actually would like to take a stroll back in time to my crazy college days with this beer sometime soon. My old roomie is visiting Chicago sometime within a month or two I should pick him up a six pack as a joke if I can find it that is."
"D: Very well off thirst."
"This was a very clear lager. I really wanted to like it, but it's pretty mediocre. Not bad, just average. It poured a very clear yellow/gold with a very large head. The head never quite desipates, and it sticks to the sides of the glass all the way down. The smell is really malty, with almost nothing else. The flavor is also malt. It has a slight metallic flavor. I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. I'm just not fond of that metallic taste. Carbonation is about right. I suppose it would make an okay session beer, though I wouldn't have more than one, and I won't be in a hurry to get more. It's okay. Just nothing special."
"Overall it is unique to the category but nothing very special, it was only 12$ for a 12 pack so I guess it is a pretty good deal for a cheap alternative if you are in a pinch."
" Drinkability- Very drinkable and decent for the price,a well made N.Z lager."
"D- This isn't the worst beer I've had....it does have some flavor, which is good for a pale lager, it's just nothing special. With that said though, it's a decent refresher for a hot day and I won't refuse to drink it in the future, I probably just won't go out of my way to have another one."
"dont go looking for this one but dont turn it down if passed too you"
"Drinkability: it's a light enough beer that it would work as a session drink, if only the taste were a little better."
"It is a lager like a great many other (see my review for Tiger Lager). A fine beer if you are sitting in the first pub that you find outside of the Auckland International Airport. Nothing really special, nothing really bad. I agree with yaegerje's comment ""might as well go with a domestic lager and save the cash."""
"D - No shock and awe, might as well go with a domestic lager and save the cash."
"For a beer that was developed to counter Heineken in NZ, they've done a pretty good job. It's not quite as good as Heinie, but it's pretty darned close."
"D: Yet another mid-pack EPL. It goes down easily enough, but is devoid of much real character. Things would be much better if the vegetable flavors were eliminated."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is skunky and slightly sweet. Taste is crisp and refreshing finishing a little sweet. Watery and a little bitter in the mouth. Highly drinkable, especially in the heat. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Overall: Not the best beer. Not awful though. Today is over 100 degrees, and this beer hits the spot."
"A pretty straightforward offering for the style, nothing noteworthy. A tad off-seeming, yet I can't possibly put my finger on what could be causing that? Not really worthy of seeking out beyond the country tick, maybe."
"This one has more than enough carbonation to clear your palate, but it actually makes this a bit filling. I had a single from the fridge, and don't care who had to drink the rest. Won't be going back to this again."
"Bit of an unexpected assault on the tongue as compared to the nose. Sweet grains and a bit of a drying hop bitterness gives the beer a thick and almost 'oily' body on the swallow, segueing to a more coarse finish. Light citrus flavor from the hops throughout. Bit drying in the end however. Decent and likely a flavor that one could acquire a taste for."
"D: not bad, i've never had kiwi beer and i think it's better than any ausie beer i've had yet"
"It's drinkable, but nothing the slightest bit remarkable. Fizzy tingly carbonation. It's not awful, it's just blah and at this low of an abv perhaps it makes a good drinker for a camping trip or something.. Not going to recommend this one to anyone, but not going to tell someone not to get it. It's a good beer for it's pricre and it's pretty true to style aside from the skunking taint."
"Drinkability: Well, that was surprisingly sufficient. Nicely balanced and easily drinkable."
"D- Not the same as in the green bottles in the States. Very manageable for a lager, its rather run of the mill."
"Beers is light golden color with mild carbonation and little head. Smell is subtle and mainly malts with a little grain. Taste is similar, bready, malty, grains. A little bit of bitterness in the finish. I didn't expect much from this beer and it delivered about what I expected. Something you could session, play beer pong with, not sure it's good for much else. I would put it a small step above your typical american macro beers."
"D: I could drink a fair amount of this, but I don't know if I would. Its slightly flavorful, but really a disappointment."
"Such a disappointment, I didn't even finish it."
"Pours a pale yellow with thin white head that leaves quickly. Really not much to look at. Really dead smell, can sense some corn with real mild hop. Earthly flavor with some bready undertones. Some sweetness I have hard describing. Mouthfeel is and drinkability are the highlights of this beer as they are slightly above average."
"D- Ok lager but nothing really special. Watch out for skunked ones (thankfully mine wasn't)."
"D- Not great. It's not overly offensive, but I sure don't see the point of picking this beer over any other popular import."
"Very drownable, but rather boring. Pretty well-balanced, though, and not a poor lager, but certainly nothing special. If this is, as the label suggests, New Zealand's finest beer, then I would really hate to try their worst."
"D - This beer is just not good."
"One of my favorite beers for the price. One of my most widely consumed beers in college. Has a very light apperance with a very hoppy aroma. It has a very refreshing herbal taste. I think the mouth feel is about average. New Zealand knows whats up!!!"
"D: As macro-brewed beers go, this is an easy to drink example. Of course, this doesn't make it a quality beer."
"D-It goes down very easily, but certainly not the best pale lager out there. I could have a couple of these."
"Pale straw color with a cloudy bottom and little head or lace. Fresh, slightly malty odor. Kind of blah. This doesn't taste very good. It's kind of watery with little to distinguish it in either hop nor malt. It does feature that saver of macro brews, a crisp, clean finish that provides a modicum of refreshment. Not worth going to New Zealand for but drinkable in a pinch."
"This beer is a clear pale golden color with a medium thick and foamy white head that diminishes slowly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Lightly skunky aroma with mild hops and grass. Light, clean body with light hops and malt, corn and hay flavors. The finish is clean and short with a mild hops flavor and aftertaste. Pretty boring overall."
"d) Not bad on a hot day, but would look towards Europe for better examples of style."
"When is comes to pale lagers, I like this one. Clear yellow with a bubbly white head. Bready, veggie, and slightly metallic aroma. Sharp bite that quickly goes sweet. Dry finish. Enjoyable and refreshing, and truly like no other pale lager I've had."
"Overall: it is a good beer to drink with pizza. It has a clean and crisp finish."
"Out of a big ol' bottle this beer was a pale golden color with lots of visible rising carbonation. The two-finger head was bright white and both rose and fell quickly leaving some patches of thin lacing. The aroma was musty, slightly skunky and very macro-lager-like with only a slight pleasantness from the pale malt. The flavors were similar but better, the pale malt being first this time. But after that skunky character came through and led to a rather dry and bitter finish. The mouthfeel was ok, the carbonation appropriately lively and the body medium/light. I used to dink this all the time when I was in NZ and retrospectively I don't know why..."
"Conclusions: This selection is very forgettable."
"Overall this is a beer I would never kick out of bed. I enjoyed it although it was not a beer I thought of as a memorable beer. It happens to be one of the beers that could go great with some italian food or some good old sports food, lil smokies, or southwest eggrolls. pretty good but not a stand out beer like peroni, as in when you see the beer you cannot really remember how it tastes but you know it was good."
"Given to me by a friend. Drank straight out of the bottle (didn't expect enough to pour it into a pint glass). Mediocre is the best way to describe it. Yellow and fizzy, high drinkability and clean finish. Would easily confuse it with an American Macro light beer or German macro. Not sure the price tag on this baby but if its comparable to the above mentioned types, I'd pick a case of this up instead!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Yellowish gold with a frothy white head that recedes quickly and leaves little lacing. Aromas of fusel alcohol and grain. Sort of pils malty base with a miniscule dash of noble hops. Dry water-cracker finish, lots of carbonation. There's even a little bitterness at the back of the palate, although that may be a metallic note rather than a hop note. Not overtly adjunct-laden, which is nice. Not awful."
"D - OK. Besides the skunk it's not too bad."
"D: Not terrible but for the price I will not be seeking out again."
"Nothing to tempt me back..."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a small white head, little but of carbonation. Nose was kind of skunked and grainey. Taste was grainy, a small dash of hops and sordove grassy. mouthfeel was rather thin, weak and somewhat refreshing. Not my favorite but average."
"lots of carbonation. Pours OK. Pale straw color. Looks like a pale lager should. There's an 'off' smell to it, sort of skunky, perhaps a touch of wheat to it. very very lightly hopped. Taste is bland and unremarkable. It's not crisp, not malty, not fruity.... not much of anything really. It's easy to drink, though, exactly because there's really nothing there. It's the bud light of NZ."
"D: Drinks easily enough. Not a great tasting beverage, however. That kinda kills its drinkability."
"purchased for a 60 year old republican old fart political fundraiser held at my parents house. Chosen b/c it reminded me of my NZ trip 4 years ago. Pours a clear pale yellow with minimal white head that reduces quite quickly, Skunky smell, and skunky green light penetrable bottle taste. some grassy notes and a bit of a pilsnery not, although quite minimal. Pretty much your average macro slammage lager. ok to have around for guests or for when your palate is totally thrashed. better than a bud, but no urquell."
"Steinlager pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very skunky. The flavor is also very skunky. Makes me wonder whether it's supposed to taste like this, or if it would taste better out of a light tight container. Avoid."
"This looked like an interesting beer because I have never had a beer from new Zealand. Had a nice golden color with a light head. The smell was very skunky, like you left a heinekin in your trunk for about 2 weeks. The taste was thankfully better then it smelled, but thats not saying much. For the price id say pass."
"Not bad..."
"This comes out of the tap a cloudy straw yellow with a frothy white head. Aroma is malty, not too strong, has a hint of banana. Flavor is malty, nice and crisp, more mouth-filling than most lagers. Texture is sassy and jazzy so it makes you take notice while it is headed down the pipes."
"Pours fizzy yellow with a pretty decent head. Relatively clean, not lots of adjuncts some piney, spicy hop aroma, albeit somewhat light. taste is similar. I've had worse and I've had better. Okay for a backyard quencher after yard work, but not much else. Also I hate the green bottle, but at least this batch tastes fresh."
"D - Not a fan of the Euro Pales Lagers in the first place but not bad, refeshing."
"I picked this beer up because I've never had a New Zealand brew. Had it well chilled in my favorite pilsner glass. Poured a bright yellow color with a big white head. Smell was sweet like sweet corn. Taste was thin and bubbly dominated by cereal grains and slight sweet corn. Not much flavor and pretty clean on the palate."
"The taste of the corn husk flavour is pretty strong and the hops inject some bitterness but don't add any real flavour. Light bodied and pretty well carbonated, it's not a bad tasting brew at all; it goes down easy enough and there's not much of an aftertaste so it's okay for occasional consumption."
"D: Didn't enjoy this one enough to really want a second one. I suppose if it was put in front of me I wouldn't refuse it."
"Poured into a pilsner, got a thick fluffy white head (with an aggressive pour) that disappears in about a minute or two into a thin white layer of bubbles. It looks like a really good drinking beer, the body is crystal clear with a bright yellow hue and has some mild carbonation topped off with a good head. It smells crisp and malty... and that's all. Its got a very light body, its mildly crisp when it first hits your tongue, slightly sweet throughout, and has a bit of a bittery aftertaste. This is a really refreshing beer on hot days or nights, not bad overall, but not good either."
"Decided to finally buy a 12er I seen at a local market on sale, so I figured what the hay...All I have to say is I drank alot of beer over the years and this stands as one of the worst I had ever tried. OK looking but tasted very grassy if that makes sense...maybe I gotta bad batch (damn green bottles!) but wouldnt bother trying a 2nd time...thank heaven it was on sale..."
"I tried this beer on Fenruary 26, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario. The been poured a translucent gold with a thin white head that didn't last long. The aroma was very grainy/grassy with some malty hints. The mouthfeel was clean, crisp, medium bodied, and medium to high carbonation. The flavour was overwhelmingly grainy with some hoppy hints at the finish. Not a great tasting lager, but it goes down very well."
"D- One and done. no more of these for me. Worth a couple sips but not a full beer."
"The taste is also a stronger, fuller pale lager, but still pretty basic. It has grain with a definite grassy, piney hop quality with definite light bitterness and hoppy aftertaste just dominating the light sweetness. It's crisp and drinkable with some character."
"D: It went down ok, but it wasn't very good. Considering the green bottle, I'm just happy it wasn't skunked."
"Very pale, almost clear in color with a huge amount of carbonation rising to the top. Big two-fingered, fluffy white head on top with very good stick. European pilsner malts, and very delicate noble hop in the nose. Taste is quite a letdown after the pleasant aroma. Starts out with a grainy sharpness that quickly disappears and leavs a bland watery taste in the mouth. Finish is kind of astringent with a 'catty' bitterness. Mouthfeel is very light and prickly. I would say that the drinkability of this beer is good until the unpleasant aftertaste. The smell of this beer lead me to believe that it was somewhat fresh, but the taste was a letdown. Probably past its prime."
"D: Overall reminds me of a henieken or a fosters. Pass."
"Poured from ""King Kahuna"" [extra big] bottle into a Lager glass. Aroma is . . . different from the good beer I have been drinking recently. . .smells of grass (both the type growing in your yard as well as the illegal drug), there is also light citrus, heavy skunk and light malt. Pour typical golden straw color of mass produced pale lagers. Frothy white head and it appears to be very over carbonated. Over carbonation confirmed on taste. Watery to bitter flavor. Tastes cheap."
"This beer is bad, although not horrendously bad like VB which you often find in the same bars. This one is your standard straw macro-lager color, lots of fiz but no real head. Nose is slightly skunky, malt and some random junk in there (rice? corn?). Taste is likewise, a little stronger on that frustrating Corona skunkiness. Not a good flavor, and just biting enough that you wouldn't really want to toss back 50 of them. Feel is thin. Overall, bad."
"I would not recommend this beer to anyone."
"Skunky, cardboard flavors, dry and astringent in the back of the throat. After a couple sips, all I want is water to wash the taste out. Light vegetal flavors add nothing redeeming, and ultimately it's wretched to drink. Gassy carbonation, unpleasant aftertaste, and very drying. Definitely avoid the green bottles."
"overall, i bought this in a make your own 6er and i dont think that i will pick up another"
"d - i probably drank this in 5 minutes, mainly just to get rid of it."
"Overall, it is drinkable but unexciting. Will still drink it if it is given to me...but won't search for it [or pay for it!]."
"Drinks good. Nice for a change. Better than macro lagers."
"D-Easy to drink and cheap. You tell me what this is meant for?"
"Pours with a light golden color, minimal head and lacing. Smell is mildly hoppy. Taste is minimal,but with a cooked veggie overtone (DMSO, perhaps?), but nothing much else. Overall, a good average beer to drink with pretty much anything. This is a beer I could drink in quantity, as it pretty much improves with the number of drinks; not necessarily a good thing, but it WAS on sale..."
"Pours a very pale color with a thin one-finger head. Smells skunky with a touch of cooked corn in the nose. Taste is somewhat malty and bitter, unimpressive by quite a bit. Certainly nothing that stands out. Another typical euro pale lager. It goes down ok but I would think that a beer should have more going for it than just that."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and clean tasting brew."
"Purchased at a store that sells a lot of beer and it was refrigerated. It was about two weeks before I got around to drinking this beer in part because it came in a 750 ml bottle. Poured into a clear 12 oz tumbler. About 2' of head that slowly receeded as I drank. Smelled slightly skunky in the bottle nice grassy herbal notes in the glass. Lots of lacing as the level went down. A crisp well balanced flavor with a slight bitterness to the hops. Overall not bad for macro-type beer. I enjoyed all 25.4 ounces."
"Light yellow, white head which fades quickly. This is a fairly un-interesting, skunked lager from New Zealand. There some grains, grass, a bit of earthiness, yada yada, and it's slightly bitter on the finish. nothing else to say really. Moving on. Next..."
"Could drink a fair amount of these if you could handle the taste"
"Drinkability- I would not recomend this beer."
"Comment: Never again (unless its free and I have few other options)."
"I decided to by this beer because I never seen it before and it came in a 750ml bottle. When I poured it into my glass it looked very good golden yellow with an inch or so head. The smell of it is quite strong and not so good when you first get into it but it goes away a little bit. The taste is ho hum its better than a can of Coors or something but not much more than fancy lawnmower beer. Each sip is smooth with a bit of carbonation. I would say that this is just an average beer and I'll try some other beers before I buy this one again."
"This is a very easy to drink lager which is perfect for a hot day."
"Pours an extremely clear bright gold, almost shiny yellow, with lots of foamy white head. Looks almost like champagne, except with lots of head retention. Sweet smell at first, followed by a bland alcoholic quality. Taste was okay, for a pale lager. In my opinion, was quite refreshing. Would certainly reach for this over a Heine or Bud, but other than that, not much to write home about. Would make a great lawnmower beer. Crisp and refreshing."
"750 ml bottle ...i like that"
"12. oz bottle in a Boag's footed pilsner...inch and a half frothy foam that slowly dissipates...active champagne-like effervescence...a little yellowish in the gold...aroma is evident from a few feet away (and outdoors!)...familiar metallic tin with banana notes...a bit of ""earth"" detected as well....slick, oily consistency...flat metallic aftertaste...reminiscent of Miller Lite...holy beer pong balls, Batman! The start reaks of Silo cup and the end feels like I'm rollling them back across the table...I intended to have this as a tailgate apertif for the Yanks/O's game today--good thing I celebrated the O's win with this a few days later...this one shouldn't hit high in the order...."
"Pours a pale straw color with a very nice and fluffy white head. The brew was poured aggressively but the sheet of chunky lacing is impressive none the less. The smell is almost non-existant for better or worse, some light grains. The brew has a bit more of a malty presence than a Budweiser, it has that almost tin like hop character, not grassy or citrus but a bitter edge. It doesn't really have that skunky Euro lager taste. The feel is light and watery and moderately carbonated, overall pretty neutral. An average beer at best, beats a macro anyday."
"Pours very light, more yellow than gold, with a big, immaculate white head that disappears quickly. Very little aroma, only some faint herbal hops and an adjuncts-and-malt base. On the palate, bland is the word... things open with fairly brisk carbonation and bitterness that's substantial for the style, but there's little hop or malt flavor. Just another bland Euro lager, nothing special."
"D - This is a farily predictable Euro Pale Lager. Bad smell and a sweet corn taste."
"Appearance is a light straw color with a thick crisp head that lasts awhile. Aroma has a slight skunk maybe a bit of cracker. Taste has some breadiness,sweet with a slight metallic note, Euro. hop with a good amount of carbonation that dances on the tongue having a light mouthfeel. A typical macro type lager, having nothing too special, but a good refresher."
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy yellow-gold color with a glistening white head. The smell is similar to most euro pale lagers, slightly grainy with a touch of fruitiness and a definite skunkyness about it. The taste is also skunky and slightly bready but it has a distinct hop bitterness about it that isn't very flattering. The beer is light in body and finishes smooth. I could drink a few of these if someone offered them up but I don't think I'll be perusing any Steinlager anytime soon."
"D: Not hard to drink, I got through the bottle pretty easily, but not something I would seek out again."
"D: Not tasty at all and doesn't go down well, at least it isn't filling, I had this beer at a tasting and hated it, but I decided to give it a fair chance by trying a full bottle, since I've had beers that have tasted very different when drinking a full bottle instead of a sample. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times and this beer tasted just as bad as it did the first time I tried it."
"Average. Indistinct. Worth a try. But probably not worth the price over the long haul."
"Poured from the bottle, beer was standard macro lager, medium gold color, light head that didn't last long, with minimal to no lacing. The smell and taste both mild, some yeast and grass scents and flavors. Mouthfeel was light, some decent carbonation, not too much aftertaste. All in all, OK."
"Drinkability: a rather dull flavor profile keeps the marks down here. It is easy to drink this quickly but it quickly becomes boring."
"Pours a clear light golden color. Minimal head. Aroma is corny and grassy with minimal hop aromas. Mostly rice. Taste is a bit lacking but pretty much uniform for the style. Light in flavor but not as crisp as I would have hoped. Okay drinkability but I wouldnt search this beer out again."
"D - Pretty good. This is a great light pils alternative to BMC for a day out on the lake or by the pool...this has some good session potential on a hot day."
"Well, this beer isn't going to set the world on fire, that's for sure. It's a color-by-numbers pale lager, with a cereal-based flavor, slight earth bitterness, and a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is way to thin and overly carbonated, too. Overall this wouldn't be my first choice if I wanted a light Euro, but it's drinkable if you're presented iwth ."
"Pours a pale straw color into a glass with a nice, dense head that sticks. It shares its smell with European lagers in green bottles; skunky. The flavor is farily unique, but might have been better if it weren't foir the skunk. It has grassy and herbal flavors, distinguising itself from your standard lager. Soft on the palate, light, and creamy, it reminds me of a lighter version of Grolsch."
"Thanks Jason B Bad!"
"This is a beer in all respects identical to middle-of-the-road American Macro."
"Here's a good example of a middle-of-the-road European style macro lager. The beer pours yellow-gold. It's very clear, and had a pure white head that left lacing on the sides of my glass. The taste was crisp and moderately hoppy, and the beer had an overall pleasant flavor. This was a very easy drinking beer. Nothing complicated, nothing hidden, just a garden variety Euro macro. Don't go out of your way to look for it, but its worth a try if you find it."
"Drinks a little above average, no new ground broken here, but would take this over BMC anyday. About the same as most eurolager, zzz. I'm sure there is better beer from new zealand, but this & the steiney light are sadly, all I know"
"Drinkability- Nice hot weather pils..or lager, whatever the hell you call it. Not offensive (except the initial smell), but nothing to shake a stick at either. They have good sales in the grocery stores for this. Can't argue much with a 12pk for less than $10. Keep some on hand for maybe moving the lawn on a hot sticky August afternoon."
"Another Euro Pale Lager, a fizzy yellow beer. Clear pale gold color. White foam was formed with the pour, but no retention or lacing to speak of. Aroma is as expected: grainy, grassy and that ""euro-skunk"" that I just can never get used to. No real flavors to it, tastes like it should, with a bit of metallic aftertaste. Carbonation is OK giving it a thin, yet appropriate mouthfeel. Hot weather, easy drinker, but for the extra 'import' price, not really worth it."
"Basically this is just a generic Euro-style lager with nothing special going for it. Though generally drinkable and not too bad, it has some taste and apearance problems. For the price it's not worth it, with a million other beers offering the same thing."
"Drinkability- Pretty drinkable. You have to watch it tho with this dumb green bottles. It's not hard to get a skunky one."
"Cheers2Beers"
"DA: I find this style to be a bit boring and this offering is no exception."
"Smallish green bottle, no freshness notes, this one pours very light, very clear and very grassy/skunky in the nose. Snow white head, a few sips and its clear that this is the dreaded pissy yellow Euro macro pale lager piss water that most of us hate. No big suprise that most of this ended up down the drain instead of down the hatch. Spend your money on better beer then this..."
"Looked and poured a very lager like yellow. Very little head to speak of. Smell of slight skunk probably due to the green bottle syndrome. Slight hint of malt followed by sharp bite from the hops. Finishes quite clean and would make a nice summer time lager served cold if you could find a fresh pack."
"Feels like flat tonic water but with less of a body. It just feels like there's nothing to this brew. This is a beer I'd not buy or want to drink again. It just sucks, there are much better brews that fit this style that are much better out there. Sure its easy to quaff but why...? THis is one beer I'll not be revisiting."
"They ""Americanized"" this beer - I had one several years ago and found it to be ""skunky"" - I bought a 6 pack recently of the new version on the reccomendation of a friend - I poured the first one in a frosted pilsner glass - nice head that hung around all the way through - it was much different than my first try, light, tastey, no bite or skunkyness. - I drank the next 5 right out of the bottle - good beer not too expensive - I bought more and genuinely like this beer - I'm bringing 2 cases to my bro-in-laws Super Bowl party and expect this beer might have a few more fans after they try it."
"Not a terrible beer, but it lacks some character to it. I could easily have more than a couple of these guys and not think twice. I don't know enough about this beer or the brewery, but I suspect it might be the Bub/Miller Light of New Zealand: around, available, acceptable in a pinch or out of a cooler at a 10 a.m. tailgate."
"I dont pour beer down the drain, but this stuff was putrid. I hope they have other offerings in New Zealand"
"Light and refreshing in the mouth, a very drinkable brew."
"Big 23.5 ounce . Very clear and pale straw in color. Nice big head, with tiny white bubbles that persist. Sweet malt aroma, a hint of DMS with some grassy hop notes (I also picked up a faint skunk note when first poured....could be the green bottle). Nice malty flavor, balanced on the bitter side. Almost like a pilsner in the hop character but not as hoppy. Would consider this in the category of light lagers. Well carbonated, finishes dry and with a bit of hop astringency. Nice beer for a hot summer day."
"Enjoyed in a bottle in Hawaii a long time ago and then found it again just recently in my local store. I remember watching coverage of the 1989-90 Whitbread Round-the-World sailing race when the New Zealand boat Steinlager 2 (skippered by the late Sir Peter Blake) won every leg--a rare feat. Now I know what they were racing to get on the other end. Really an excellent beer--and ""Euro Pale"" isn't one of my favorite styles. This is more of an Australian lager (e.g., Boag's) fruity/veggie flavor... a bit exotic and (like the boat) adventurous. Worth trying."
"D: I find this beer to be well balanced and quite refreshing. I'm digging on the blend of dry and sweet. One of my favorite warm weather beers, a beer I will turn back to again and again."
"23.5 ounce monster bottle. Clear golden in color. Sweet malts coupled with some freshly cut grass and musky hops. Grassy hops are evident in the body; combined with a decent malt-based background. Ever so carbonated and a body that resembles a spritzy sodabubbly and bland. Grainy-like finish with a cleansing palate. Easy enough to drink, not bad."
"Drinkability/notes: Average"
"Overall not one that I'll buy (this was brought by a friend; neither of us had tried it). If you put a Bud Ice to my head and told me to drink the Steinlager, I'd do it, and I'll sure as hell drink it for free, but it's not great."
"Easy to drink. Uncomplicated. It is what it is. I think this would be a good, light weight beer for burger and fries. The 99 cent price tag for the big bottle increases the drinkability."
"Average mouthfeel, not at all drinkable. I'm glad that I just sprang for the single instead of the sixer. This beer really wants to be a Euro-style lager, but it gets the whole thing wrong. It's got the look, but not the substance."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with white head. Skunky aroma that is also a bit musty with some grass and grain as well. Taste starts out malty but quickly turns bitter and skunky the longer it sits. Overall, this is just another average lager that doesn't do much for me."
"This brew pours a clear straw color with a huge, fluffy white head three fingers in height. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is suprisingly more hoppy than I ever would have imagined. Noble hops with a touch of cirtus dominate the noise. The taste isn't quite as bold as the aroma, but is nice nonetheless. The mouthfeel is a touch ligher than medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, if memory serves me correctly, this is one of the best Euro Lagers I have ever had. I would certainly drink this beer again."
"overall- not terrible, but not anything to write home about. The flavor comes across lightly and the finish is smooth and non-offensive. This might serve as a nice thirst quencher with some spicey bbq or wings. Only paid $0.99 for the 25.5oz bottle, which makes it hard to complain."
"Life is short. Drink something else."
"Pours to a golden color, with a pillowy white head that lingers throughout, and excellent lacing. Aroma is floral hops. Taste is more of the hoopy floral, with grassy taste more evident at mid-glass. Finish is dry, with lingering floral aftertaste. An okay beer, but nothing great."
"While drinking beer beyond its best by date is usually not a problem having a lager sit for a year and a half is pushing it. My can produced a half-inch head that stayed a long time. The beer was bright yellow with some flakes in it. Not good. But since a friend imported it to Amsterdam from New Zealand I just hated to throw it away so I drank it. Despite the foggy appearance it wasn't all that bad, really. But my ratings don't mean much..."
"It's a sub-par Euro-lager. Too watery, no real flavor. Bland."
"Overall- This has such a corn flavor it amazes me!?! I'll pass on this in the future!!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just shy of medium bodied. The beer is well carbonated. This beer beer isnt a bad beer. The beer was easy to drink. For $0.99 for 25.4 oz this is a ok beer for easy consumption."
"I sampled this one with my wife. Its a very clear gold color with a fizzy, uninspiring foam. The aroma is of pale malt, with a modest sulfur background and a little slight hint of hops. The taste is a little grainy, with some cereal ajunct flavor and a little sweetness. Theres a fleeting caramel flavor as well. Medium mouthfeel, given the style, and modest carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. This isnt a bad beer at all. Its not outstanding, and certainly isnt interesting. Still, its thirst quenching and fairly enjoyable. Its a dinkable, no frills lager."
"This poured from the bottle a pale yellow with a 2mm head sitting at the top of the glass. Smell is horribly skunky, consequence of being in a green bottle I reckon. It really doesn't taste that bad, hops are prevalent and some malt notes too but because of the skunk it really doesn't go down that well. A little harsh and difficult to down, unless I can get this in a can I doubt I'll be trying it again any time soon."
"Overall an average to above average Pils - nice and spicy. Seemed a bit fresher and smoother than its continental relatives."
"Fizzy, typical and unexiciting mouthfeel. Again, lawnmower beer. Great served ice cold on a hot day...I could really used one earlier today! Despite the 3/4 litre size, still very drinkable...and cheap to!"
"Opinion: Well, this beer doesn't suck. It is OK...a bit out of balance for my taste, but is still pretty decent. I will finish the huge-o bottle, but that will probably be enough for me for quite a while."
"Smells sweet, corny but aromatic almost with a bit of spice.. Pours to a pale golden yellow with a nice head. Flavor starts sparkly and sweet with a very slight bitter finish. Seems kind of bland in the middle. Not much backbone to speak of.. Refreshing but not a stand out."
"Poured a pale yellow color with massive white head. Smell is very minimal with only a slight maltiness detected. Taste is also very mild with some malt present and a moderate bitterness at the finish leaving a pleasant dryness. Average at best, but not a beer is revisit."
"This is a drinkable beer, a good hot weather thirst quencher, but otherwise not a particularly attractive choice. It is average to below average in almost all respects. It reminds me of most macros, although I think its probably better than most American macros anyway. I would drink Steinlager again, but I hope to have better choices at hand."
"Drinkability/notes: Overall, a fairly medicre example of the style, not particularly well made. The attenuation and tannins suggest that the grain bill might have been pushed beyond its reasonable limits."
"Appears a bright clear straw golden and it forms a nice large cloudy white head textured like a stay puff marshmellow forms a rising biscuit center with scattered lacing as it dwindles. Aroma contains nice grassy and toned down citrus notes from the hops and mild sweetness from lightly toased malts character adding another country to the list, I've had in the past and it sometimes takes awhile to revisit. However, with this one I have no idea why I'm guessing availability it was in every corner grocer in Cali while I just now ran into recently in Southeastern Ohio. Flavor is nice with a even bitterness with more of that grassy Euro esque hop character slight biscuit sweetness very easy going even flavor, but it's pretty flavorful especially for the style some may call this one another skunk but I'm a fan tasty brew very refreshing I drank a couple this past Father's day weekend outdoors in 90 degree weather and enjoyed it pretty thoroughly. Mouthfeel is light bodied not thin even carbonation doesn't bring about any unnecessary burps. Drinkability is good especially with some grillin' foods great tasty euro lager for me one of the better ones."
"Overall: A bit rough around the edges. Solvent aroma and nothing special in the flavor do not help either."
"The color is a pale golden with high carbonation. Head is a medium height. Aroma is of sweet grains and herbal hops. Despite a green bottle, there was no skunking. Taste is very full-flavored. A nice sweet malt, grainy, with an edge of honey is joined by an herbal hop. No offensive adjunct flavors are noted. The is very flavorful and has a fresh taste. This is one of the best of this style that I've sampled."
"Very European. Clean, hoppy, and bitter, along the lines of a north German pils. Quaffable."
" Eric"
"Overall Impression: Over stretched the grain bill? Too dry, hop taste is a bit off, not skunked though, surprised given the green bottle."
"This is crystal-clear gold with a little bit of white head. The smell is light-struck (""skunky""), which isn't too big a suprise given the green bottle used as its means of conveyance. Smells like your generic green bottled European import lager. More skunk on the palate, along with adjunct. The flavors are light and low, and the finish is watery. This beer would be completely neutral except for its skunkiness, which instead puts it squarely on the wrong side of average."
"A completely average mass-produced lager. I'm glad I only bought a single bottle."
"NZ's budweiser, and much better than bud at that. Appetizing smell and decent appearance. Taste is light on both malt and hops and balanced at that so neither is very distinguishable. There really isn't enough flavor for a beer lover. Even Bud has more flavor even if it is a bad flavor. You would think that a country so good a rugby would also be enthusiastic about their beer. I blame christianity for giving prohibition a foothold and stripping NZ of their variety."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pale malt and adjunct scent that is accompanied by a nasty green bottle skunkiness. It's dry and a bit bitter. The taste is average also. It starts rather nicely with some pale malt flavor, but quickly turns bitter and skunky with some residual sweetness in the finish. It has a dry and somewhat fruity lager yeast presence as well. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average lager at best. It has too much of that nasty skunkiness for my taste. It's one and done for me."
"Da little disappointed in this one. I really was hoping for more flavor, but it isnt there. Might be good for the summer, perhaps after yard work on a hot day?"
"A clean very pale yellow beer.Has a very small white head that disapears quickly. Light citrus notes up front in the aroma. With a light grassy character in the background. The taste starts with a light lemony citrus note that quickly fades. Followed by a quick snap of a peppery hop bite on the finish."
"This New Zealand beer is a fairly new arrival to the Omaha market. The green bottle turned me off but I found a single of it so I said, what the hell. I am glad I did. Will I go back to this in the future? I dont know. I liked it fine but I still have quality control issues. Stick this in a brown bottle, lower the price a tad and it would be a winner. Still, IMO, dont avoid trying this because it is damn easy to drink. Purchased in Omaha. Try one."
"Pale and clear less-than-gold color, big frothy head with giant bubbles and not a lot of lasting power. Laces are minimal, some rings and marks on the glass. Mild aroma, some senses of honey and canvas. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation, more than average. Flavor has some of those canvas qualities, wet hay, a camping trip, but overall, quite a bit of sweetness in front, middle, and end. Slightly insipid and offputting as it winds down, like Cheerios cereal with lots of sweetener added in. In some ways, I don't actually think this beer is as well done as some tighter American Lagers, it could actaully use a sense of crispy fade to punctuate the ending a bit more."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel for such a light bodied lager, there are better beers in NZ than this, for sure. Worth a try..."
"Big ass bottle for fairly cheap price. Looks like a dull golden color with a medium to small foamy head. Carbonation seems low. Aroma is quite skunky, I know its the hops but there's a ridiculous nasty skunky smell here. After a bit, I get some grainy dry maltiness but the skunky hops and yeast dominate. Flavor is less skunky but still strong on the hops. Not really too smooth either. This is definitely more pils like than lagerish. Very straightforward beer to boot. Grainy malts up front and a strong Euro hop finish. Body is medium and drinkability isn't too great. Rather uninteresting and overly skunky hopped for what it's supposed to be imo."
"Worth a try, especially if you want a bit more hops bite than typical American lagers."
"This New Zealand Breweries beer distinguishes itself from the hordes of lackluster EPLs by looking like a dream and by being much hoppier than most. Given the unfortunate reality that a beer brewed half a world away is unlikely to reach the plains of Iowa in its ideal state, I have no trouble believing that Steinlager is a beer to contend with on its native soil."
"Immediate impression was ""this is Ballantine"" which I didn't mind that much. So, skunky, a tad metallic. It poured with very little head and little head retention with limited cabonation and was lighter yellow, again, it seemed like Ballantine. Mouth was that of Heineken, light, minimum foam, light alcohol. This was shaping up to be less than average, and the taste, not a strong as Ballantine, not as sharp as Heineken, certainally better than BMC beers, but it was just another yellow, fizzy beer with an import price that didn't meet even the minimum that would make me buy this again. The JWD beers are far better and cost way less."
"Pours a off-yellow color with a thick white head. The smell is skunky and slighly sweet. The taste is pretty much the same, with bitter and baking soda flavors in the aftertaste. I wasn't expecting a great deal from this beer, so I'm not very dissapointed. It's drinkable, and that's about all. Mouthfeel is pretty basic. I doubt I'd buy this again, but it was worth a try."
"Overall: Too brash for my taste; otherwise, an unremarkable lager."
"If you can find it fresh and protected from the light try it."
"Its a quaffable lager that should have no pretensions but its a passable beer"
"Pale yellow coloured clear brew, medium carbonation, not much of a head but a nice lacing. Smells very skunky, underneath is a bit of mild bready maltiness, not much exciting here to speak of. Taste is very dry and the malts are a bit on the over-roasted side. A slight, almost grapefruity hop sourness and a mild sweetness, but not much. Mostly sour aftertaste. Sparkles on the tongue, then sticks in throat. This is just not an exciting beer to me. I've had better bottles of this in the past, I think it has a hard time surviving the trip over...."
"Pours out to a nice golden color with a full and cotton like white head, some notes of lace. Medium level of carbonation. Aroma is of burned malts and stale earth. Hope this isn't indicitive of the other 5 in the fridge. Ugh. Luckily the taste is a welcome change to the smell; cooked veggies, medium malts, hops, and some hay and grain. Not bad. Mouthfeel is pretty good, the carbonation makes this brew more quaffable than most. Drinkability is average. I could take or leave this. I will sample a couple of other bottles and see about the aroma. It really kills the enjoyment of the beer."
"This is just an exceptional beer. I would consider this a faultless Pils and the finest I've ever had, even next to Prima. I wonder why I haven't bought this in so long, as I used to drink quite a bit of it when I was younger. I could drink these all day long. As soon as I popped the top, I was immediately reminded of what I have been missing. Highly, highly recommended!"
"The high light of this beer was when it poured a nice light golden yellow. The rest was all down hill after that! The smell was of weak hops and really nothing else. The flavor was really not impressive. It was someone soaked his dirty socks over night in the vat. Move over, here comes and lousy beer!"
"Pours a two-finger white head that lasts and leaves a good lace. Crystal clear golden color. Nose is grainy & hoppy. Medium carbonation and light bodied. Starts and finishes hoppy with a lingering aftertaste. Reminds me of the American macros without the skunky nose. $1.35 for a 330ml bottle from RSVP Liquors Portland, Me."
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer. If it wasn't so freaking weird I think I'd like it more, but it's damn confusing as it stands."
"Drinkability: 2.5"
"12 oz green bottle pours a clear golden-straw color with a good creamy white head that lasts with some lacing, grainy and flowery aromas. Bready, cracker flavors with a mild sweetness that has some dryness in the finish. Light bodied with a watery and kind of thin mouthfeel, this beer looks great but thats about it."
"Drinkability is pointless on this one, you would be better served to get yourself a glass of water. I have had many Macro light beers with more body and flavor than this one."
"After carbonation gives way this ends rather creamily. This tastes much better than the average adjunct. There is little of note here, but it would be pleasantly refreshing without the aforementioned creaminess. The flavour is slightly chalky and salty (think soda water) and a little fruity despite hops dominating malt. This is a cut above most American mass consumption lagers, but still an also ran in the quality stakes."
"Yellowish heavily carbonated pour. A bit of hops and grass on the nose but a bit too light to stand out. Grainy with something resembling flax on the tongue, not quite hoppy. I'd say it was chewy but it was more like slimy residue. When nothing else was available, it was at least a new brew."
"Overall, this is a good beer to serve with spicy food, but it's kinda like a macro lager to me, just, ""eh"". Cold and refreshing, but uninvolving."
"25.4 ounce green bottle."
"Appearance is clear light yellow with some foam and short lived lace. Aroma is barley with some brussel sprouts. Initial taste is of sweet malt and brown sugar and dough. There are lots of hops here, and they overcome the malt. Allspice and grains leave a finish on the tongue like spice- bread, but dry and clean. Not good, not bad."
"Pale golden beer and nice head that's lasting well. Good nose for the way it's went and lightness of the beer giving fresh maltarome, litle sweetish and hops that survived the green botle and light quiet good but litle skunkyness there. Taste is fresh and tasty but light; maltyness there and good and fresh hopbitterness that gives the beer a litle fruity carracter. Not to much of everything but actually quiet enjoyable on a hot night like this."
"Another pale lager import into Ontario. Not the worst of its style, some thirst quencher on an oppressively hot day. Nothing much to look at colourwise, a bit of temporary foram. Some substance in the taste. Malt, and some yeast. Malty balanced aftertaste."
"Pours a piss yellow amber, lots of head and a surprising amount of lacing on the glass. Smells like light malts, little bit of skunkiness, grassy smell. Tastes like grass too, weird skunky fresh cut grass taste, little bit of bitterness in the finish. Theres this really nasty flavour too it, like alcohol but even weirder, the kind of an anise flavour? I remember this being better, medium carbonation and smooth mouthfeel, kind of watery, not very appetizing."
"Got this one in Maui and tried it just because of their lack of choices. The appearance of this is typical to swill lager like heineken or amstel. The smell is a little foul and skunky with a gym-sock backing. The taste had an a vegetable aspect to it with a sour grain finish. The mouth feel was a little acidic and unpleasant. I really could't imagine drinking any more than 1 or 2 of these. My guess is this stuff would throw you a wicked hangover."
"330 ml bottle, at a bar in London. Pale golden sparkling beer, poor head. Moderate hops and grass in the aroma. A tolerable amount of hops in the flavour makes this beer A LITTLE better than the average swill lager. Wont buy again, though. I you want a good NZ lager, look for Emersons in stead!"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but it will makes you burp easily too in reason of its high carbonation levels. Not a so bad product, but I have seen better too."
"This is not a good beer, though it's definitely better than Canadian or Blue. It pours a bland very pale straw color with an almost non existent head and a tiny bit of lace. The smell is of vegetal DMS and a slight wiff of hops. The taste is the same with some thin malt flavor in the back and a nasty metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery with prickly carbonation. Just another macro lager.."
"A limpid golden yellow beer with low carbonisation, very clear. The head dissapeared really fast, yup this Kiwi was shy! I had no smell at all from that beer, very macro, nothing to say actually. Her taste was a tiny bit fruity, unbalanced, very matly and bitter with a shy bit of hopish flavors."
"I will be game to try this again when it arrives in more responsible packaging. In fact, you might even hear me recommending it."
"Say it isn't so, another dissapointing lager. Pours a straw yellow with a fizzle of a white head, the smell is very skunky, so much so it is hard to find any traces of anything. The tase is again slightly skunk and earthy. Grainy tones are in the forefront with almost weedy dry aftertaste. Feels light and dull in the mouth and would not consider to have this anytime soon, I'd rather not look at it again either."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored beer with a standard head with no retention. Aroma is a mix of malts and skunk which doesnt start too well. Taste is again dominated by that skunk taste (damn! People should know that green bottle are not made for imported beer) with a little bit of hops. Overall, this is another garbage macro lager. Wont be seeking this again anytime soon."
"To be avoided."
"Drinkability is fine if you were weaned on Bud Lite. Otherwise, steer clear of this. If this is anything to go by, beers in New Zealand aren't so different from America."
"Kiwi beer. Pours a standard golden lager color with a spittle white head. Smells a bit of the skunk, with notes of otherwise clean maltiness and a moderate dose of hops. Taste is full of cereal grains accented with some honey sweetness that is well balanced by some slightly metallic hops. Not bad, but I think the Southern Alps are the real reason to go to New Zealand (and perhaps the girls)."
"ahh a new zealand offering from the utah state liquor store. mild skunk aroma accompanies this pale yellow fizzy beer that contains a sticky lacy head. lots of grain and vegetables on the palate with lingering cereal flavors. no adjuncts though...a welcome surprise. Better than a lot of macros, an average beer at best though."
"A clear yellow pour from a 33 cl green bottle with a label that taunts the consumer about the World's Cup. Now that's marketing! But back to the beer. This thing has a reasonable head on it that lasts through the drinking session- pretty unusual for a lager in my experience. Lots of carbonation. Aroma isn't much of anything- sweet, light and bright with a slight hops signature. The flavor is mild, unexciting, with an herbal sense and a sharpness at the back of the throat at swallow. Generally pleasant, better than many, but not all that exciting. I'd take this over an American Macro!"
"Drinkability  When will I learn to stop buying Pale Lager in green bottles."
"Pours a pale golden color with a light whispy head,smell was slightly skunked (green bottle) and musty with some sharp hop bitternes coming thru.Taste was harsh and not very pleasant,it was albeit slightly skunked.Some light hoppy notes but nothing I would want to try again thats for sure."
"crisp taste with a bit of bitterness up front. better than your average macro lager, but nothing to get too excited about."
"Very drinkable. Smell is the strong point."
"I must agree that the self-promotion on the label ""worlds best lager"" is perhaps taking it a bit too far, Steinlager is a pleasant drop yes but hardly exceptional. It is one of the strongest smelling beers i've ever had which is interesting. It ltastes to me quite a bit different to the dutch lagers, perhaps the taste and the smell are due to the use of NZ hops???"
"solid import that comes at a reasonable price and does hit the spot during the course of a session. steinlager doesnt live up to its claims on the label, but its still a handy beer on the whole."
"Steinlager has a strange attraction to it. Theres really nothing remarkable about it yet it has an easy drinkability thats hard to reconcile. Better than an American macro, but not by much."
"Considering I've used the word three times already, all I can say its is clean and crisp. Decent drop."
"Mediocre beer. Comes in a 750mL green bottle with a nice label of a New Zealand shore. Pours a crispy leaf yellow, with a small head that quickly disappears to film. Lacing is thick on the glass, creating nice patterns of art. Very weak smell. Some malt and hops, but it's faint. Slight bitter taste. But it doesn't seem hoppy. I'm thinking it's a weak hop, or that their aren't enough hops in this beer, but even lesser malt. Like the nose, weak taste. Course mouthfeel. Carbonated when entering the mouth, rough when flowing through the throat. I won't be buying this again. It's not that good. Tolerable, but below average drinkability."
"On the pour, a limpid golden color, the head portly in size, the texture frothy, the color a bright white and as it erodes a nice concealing sheet of lace is formed. Nose is citrus crisp, sweet malt and a real pleasant sniff for the old schnozzle with a sweet malt laden start, the top fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasantly acidic, the hops adequate for the style, dry lingering aftertaste to finish off this quite drinkable beer. A Great Beer no, a good pleasant session beer Yes, and I do love those 25.4 ounce bombers, a pleasant treat during the record Arizona summer heat."
"I've had much worse. I'd definately take this over a Bud."
"Came in a hefty green 750mL green bottle. Time spent on the shelf was questionable. Pours out a light gold lager hue, decent carbonation, with a thin head of foam that leaves small wisps of lace. Did I get a bad bottle? Nose has a hint of skunk, some grains that remind me more of scotch than a lager, and a bit of fruit, sweet, almost like apple juice. Flavour is also grainy, almost like half baked bread, which lends itself to the mouthfeel as well. The hops do it a bit of justice. I've had touch and go experiences with this particular beer, have found it difficult to make up my mind for good, as it has never remained consistent (although New Zealand IS a long way to import from). This time around was like liquid herbal bread dough in a pint glass. Disappointing."
"Qute a drinkable lager i dare say if all you had ever tasted was Bud."
"Difficult to gauge the taste with that overpowering hideous smell but I was able to finish the bottle so it couldn't have been too bad. Malty taste with no sense of what the hops are doing to this beer. The bottle says some kind of hops grown in NZ are used for this beer so maybe that’s it. Mouthfeel has a sweet finish to it that is bearable. Drinkablity is also low, mostly due to the putrid smell."
"Nothing really special here, just slightly below average but acceptable. It pours a light golden hue with minimum head and good carbonation..The taste begins with an assault by the malts which is replaced with a slight hoppy bitterness. Does have some character but it is weak."
"Looks like a lager and smells like a lager. Not much taste, floral hops, not enough malt, sort of tastes like an alcohol-free, malt-free beer, but without the virtue of being alcohol-free. Hard to make a beer this uninteresting. Definitely plain, probably a good yuppie or chick beer.. stick a lime in this one! all crap beer needs a lime.."
"I guess this would be a Kiwi macro. Pours with nice head. Smell is weak hops. Very nice carbonation. Taste is very crisp, good and malty. If this is the Bud of New Zealand they have one on us Americans. This was actually quite a treat. Somewhat impressed. This is not as heavy as a lot of imports. Good beer to toss down. I will not buy this again, as the bottles are 11.2oz. What a rip off."
"Light yellow in color with decnet carbonation. Thin lace.  Smells somewhat grainy with a very slight hint of bready malt.  Grainy flavor with a sweet malt character that tries to stand up and be taken seriously.  Warms slightly in the mouth as you finish your glass.  Finishes with a slight aftertaste of adjuncts."
"Notes: Decent at best, better than an American Macro Lager but not much better. Could be confused with a macro German Lager with the name and the flavour. At $1.50 a pop I can’t complain too much."
"floral, semi-decent brew from New Zealand, hoppy, suffers from lack of bitterness though, try one though, don't go out and get a case of it... you will be sorry."
"I've never had a Steinlager that didn't smell like the ass-end of a skunk, with a taste to match.  Maybe those I've had weren't properly stored or were too old, but they should at least try some brown bottles."
"This is an easy beer for those trying to get into beers because it doesn't have a lot of bitterness or much taste, but it's not horrible. Its got a little bit of sweetness. Still not great."
"Just and average lager, maybe a bit more hoppiness though. Easy to drink, simple and boring, its OK."
