"Hyper-carbonated--beyond soda pop. Again the graininess is dominating. No hop. I will not finish this beer. I think it's poor even by most macro standards."

"O - this was easy to drink due to how light and watered down it was but overall this was not enjoyable. i will not be drinking this again"

"Smell is sweet and corny, on the apple juice side. Also tastes quite sweet and of corn and apple juice. Thin bodied, mild carbonation. Not offensive, just anonymous."

"it could be worse but it could be better, everything's faint and boring, don't bother"
"Probably the best lager, so, beer, that I've tried from China, and while it saddens me that it's from the AB/Inbev arm there, it also doesn't surprise me. This is pretty much Bud, since the usual runoff skank I get from this country's beers seems to be absent. So, considering the many degrees of degradation, um, good?"

" I will continue to seek out these larger(fresher?)Harbin's and hope that anyone aware of a direct supplier of them please let me know, as I really enjoyed this beer but refuse to drink the sub-standard 12oz variety that seems to be the only thing available at this point to me. So if you can find a source of the 22oz Harbin's, definitely chill one good and give it a try...goes great with sushi too :)"
"D: The carbonation and extreme dryness of this beer make it a little hard to take down. I feel like I would need some water after a couple bottles of this."
"O- Honestly, I remember this being better while on vacation, but then again, it was humid and warm. Again, like pretty much all other Chinese lagers, this one isn't anywhere near special, but for thirst quenching purposes, this hits the spot. It's pretty standard fare, but I'd drink it again and will at some point I'm sure"
"This beer pours out as a golden color with some quick fading head. The smell was hardly noticeable at all. The Taste was just about the same as the aroma, very light. The mouthfeel was carbonated and light. Overa this beer wasn't that great. Nothing to rave about."
"O: It is easy drinking and is not offensive enough to mind downing the entire large bottle."
"Specifics on my bottle: Bought at a large Chinese supermarket in Qingdao, China. According to the label, it has at least 3.6% ABV with 10 degree Plato gravity."
"Beer Advocate desperately needs a ""Asian adjunct lager"" category. I think this beer wouldve got better ratings of they expected a euro pale lager. I think this is one of the best Asian adjunct lager I've had. Better than sapporo or sing ha or whatever its called. Give it a shot if you want something cheap tasting."
"drinkability: easy drinker but i'd pick others over this (of the style)"
"This is a sad looking piss-yellow beer with no head. Corny and grainy. Not much else here. I'm struggling to find descriptors here. There is just a massive lack of flavor. Ok, I found some DMS, but isn't that unwanted in a beer? This isn't just a bland beer, it has a strange twang to it that I can't put my finger on. Regardless, I'm glad to have gotten rid of this last bottle from my fridge."
"Comments: All in all, this is an enjoyable, albeit average beer with some decent attributes."
"This is one of those ""When in Rome ..."" beers, meaning you'd be lucky to find a pan-Asian eatery that has a diverse beer selection, so this will suffice in the meantime. Perhaps one of the cleanest Chinese Lagers to date, and a sure pick when put up against the rest. Kung pao beef with a side of Singapore fried rice would be sizeable enough to tangle with this beer."
"Seemed to have some kind of zest equated with hops though and a slight enjoyable bitterness. I mean, it grows on you, what looked doubtful, made a return back to acceptable and beyond. I dunno what they used as a barley malt substitute, but its very light. Its a light beer, but its pretty enjoyable, don't think its corn, not that kind of sweetness."
"Compared to other beers in China its one of the better ones, but still quite poor compared to beers from the rest of the world. Taste is very inconsistent, usually its fine, a basic light larger. I have found on many occasions that its can have a stale taste. In that case its time to switch to something else because the whole batch is bad, and every Harbin in the bar will taste the same. Other times It seems overly hopped for the style, which is a pleasant surprise due to the fact that chinese beers hardly have any hop flavor at all. Also I found a fly in one of mine, so drink with caution."
"Harbin was a good lager, nothing exceptional, but solid."
"Light bodied and well carbonation, but short of vapid and fizzy. This has a bit of character to it, albeit subtle. Its biggest asset is its thirst quenching ability. It's better than quite a few true ""Euro"" lagers out there. Better than expected, but still about mediocre."
"Taste: A little bitterness at first that leads into a slight sweetness. There are no strong flavors either way but they are fairly balanced to make a good, not great, taste."
"Cool to try just to say you have had a beer from China, but nothing special and the Chinese are not really known for brewing world class beers, I'll take their food over this beer any day."
"Notes - The bottle came in a plastic cloth like cover that was nicely tied around the neck of the bottle and had Chinese writing on it. They should have invested more in the beer flavor and less about what the packaging looked like."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. There is a slightly skunky aroma. Taste is light and dry. Not much flavor. Feels light and watery in the mouth. Drinkability is good. Overall an average beer."
"Beer pours a crystal clear light golden color with decent cap of white foam above it. Somewhat bready aroma, but some adjunct (rice, maybe corn) as well. Light on the palate, slightly carbonated. Malt with more adjunct in the flavor. Finishes snappy with a little bitterness. Not terrible, but could do with out the adjunct. Fairly average for the style."
"Best paired with extremely greasy and/or spicy entrees; including egg foo young, noodles, vegetables, and rice."
"Overall: A carbonated mouth feel that is a little dry. The body of the beer is very light and the finish is nil. This beer is nothing special. To me it taste like a hopped up Budweiser."
"Pours bright yellow with a sturdy white head. Aroma of pilsner malt. Taste is slightly sweet with most of the flavor coming from the malt, but it's very well balanced. Sort of like Miller Lite if it was good at all.. and from China. Lots of carbonation, very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Drink: Exceptional drinkabitity. Careful! This beer could be habit forming."
""
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Clean and kind of crisp which is all the good I can say. I dont plan on trying this again."
"Bottle from one of the sacramento BevMo!s that i picked up because it looked fancy and happened to be cheap. Pours a clean yellow brown with a soda-like white head. Head falls off to a white ring fairly quickly. Laces fast and wetly. Smells of rice, malt, ethanol, vague apple-y esters. Flavor is reasonably clean up front, with an apple tang that grows. Sour ethanol is a bit much, making the drinking experience reminiscent of a malt liquor. Thin bodied. Mot worthwhile to seek out, nor worht mentioning particularly besides the fancy and slightly odd packaging....not terrible overall, just slightly less than ok."
"Interesting beer, too bad it was stocked with the Microbrew Bombers and not the 'imports'/'Macros'."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The saving grace of this beer, I'm loving the wonderful texture. Thin and unassuming on the outset, it quickly effervesces and becomes almost perfectly suited for drinking alone or with food. I'm happy to have had the opportunity to sample this."
"Pours a golden color with a 2 finger head. Smells of malts and a bit skunky. The taste was very bland malty and a bit of rice and skunky after taste. Mouthful was very carbonated for me. The drinkability isnt all that great. Just didnt do it for me."
"Light in color with a nice 3 finger head as poured. Head was long lasting. Unfortunatley, the flavor, like most lagers is mild and non remarkable. Still, for a Chinese lager, I feel it is quite good. Clean malt flavor but mild. Very drinkable. Bbeautiful bottle is a beautiful emrald green. Almost worth saving."
"D Good introduction to let BMC drinkers know there are other craft beers out there. Nothing special though."
"(rated Nov 28, 2008)"
"Pours a light golden straw color with a thin fizzy white cap that leaves no lacing. The nose is light grains,it smells like corn Chex cereal and Euro skunk. The flavors are a bit more doughy than the nose with some subtle malt sweetness and faint earthy hoppage. The body is extremely light with average carbonation and a crisp finish. This is extremely drinkable and with a lot more flavor than a BMC or most Chinese brews for that matter. A decent Lager that could go well with spicy food. Better than expected."
"This beer is average at best. The bottle with fancy (good looking) labels and foil far exceed the contents within."
"The taste is similar, with grassy grain, nuts. It's a little sweet with a light, brief, grassy and herbal bitterness with a hint of citrus at the end. It has a rather full feel and somewhat long, pleasant grain aftertaste. it's highly drinkable and has nothing off."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is faint bready malt, with some corn. The taste is like the aroma. It has no complexity what so ever, but it is pleasant. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this beer is pretty good for a Euro lager. I could drink it again if nothing better were available."
"This beer is just too boring and plain and the little flavor it hasn isn't too great. It's not a drain pour by any means, but still why bother?"
"Not recommended..."
"D: Drinkability was slightly less then average, and macro-like. Wouldn't go out a buy a sixer of this. Wouldn't drink a second one back to back."
"Wow, wrapped in a nice cotton cloth with a gold elastic band - looked so fancy. $2.09 for 24oz -- hmmm -- something's up. Pours a nice frothy fluffy white head, better get a good look, oops, it's gone. MMM flat ricey, hay flavored beer. Where's the hops? It's not even sweet. Ugh, only half a mug to go. Awful stuff -- not recommended."
"Well...it is better than Tsingtao, the nation's other mass-marketed beer available in the US. I do have to admit that although this beer is simply average, the outside wrap engraved with Chinese writing, then tied to the bottle like wrapping paper to a gift, gives the eye the impression it's something special."
"As far as Asian beers go, I would go for a Singha, Asahi or Tiger before this one. I will pass on buying this again."
"Drinkability- Average nothing I would go out of my way for."
"A decent beer for the hot summer months and IMO, better than the BMC out there."
"Good luck in Beijing but I recommend avoiding this one."
"D - Well, it is easy to drink....but then again, it tastes a lot like water. Might be a good choice for someone who is being introduced to world beers."
"So I tried this beer after the Bud girl that stocks my store recommended it. There was my first mistake, it was the Bud girl that recommeneded it! Anyway, I thought I'd give it a go, had some cool Chinese on the label probably means ""We pee in beer, you Amercians drink now!"" Poured a light watery gold color with a fast fizzling head. Smell was mildly hopped with an even milder vegetable/soggy cereal sweetness. Taste was thin and grassy with a metallic finish. I just stick with the Chinese food."
"D: This is just another mass-produced beer. Zero flavor and no personality whatsoever. Pass."
"Poured a little darker than expected. Nice head that quickly dissipated. Aroma wasn't bad. Thought it would be skunky, but it wasn't. Pretty much a typical Chinese lager. Tasted a little better than others I've had, but doesn't compare to a good German lager. Got it because I'd never had it. They were practically giving it away at the beer store. Probably won't get it again."
"D - This beer is pretty boring, and almost nasty. In a blind taste test, this could be confused for Natural Light or something of that ilk. Pass."
"This Chinese lager is certainly better than most if not all Chinese beers I've had to date. It reminded me of Japanese beers (Kirin, Sapporo, etc.) Some skunkiness but nothing offensive. Not a bad lager, not an awesome one either. Great for Chinese standards!"
"Note: It is OK for try a North Chinese traditional beer."
"Pours an expected clear straw gold. Nose right from the open was with a touch of sweet, but it quickly faded to basically nothing. Flavor is more of what youd expect. Mild and smooth, though there is a touch of slight sweet to it and a fresh taste. Mouthfeel is standard. Drinkability is high since it is so light and goes down easy. For the price, not really worth it. Might as well drink a Tsing Tao. Overall, its beer. Nothing to run out and try. (I can see how AB would be affiliated with this brewery)"
"Harbin pours clear and honey colored in the glass. It has a medium white head and a very nice nose full of spicy hops and malt. The flavor tends toward sweetness but there is enough hops in it to keep that under control. It finishes with a really nice lager snap. This brew has a fair amount of depth and character for its style."
"The beer pours a luminous gold color, the head average and a creamy white, as it quickly settles, the lace forms a thin coating upon the glass, nose is all malt, lightly sweet and crisp, start has a fair malt profile with the top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a customary acidity, the hops barely there, dry aftertaste, drinkable but just barely."
"Pours a very pale color with a fluffy head. Aroma is slightly skunky with the typical pale lager characteristics. Smooth, somewhat grainy and goes down kind of rough. Tastes of corn in the aftertaste. Very average, unimpressive. This is from China? I'd have a hard time believing that if it wasn't on the label."
"For a run of the mill Chinese macro, this was a pleasant surprise. An alternate theory is that the only reason my expectations were exceeded was because they were so low. Worth a shot for the curious."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a crisp, clean pale malt and adjunct scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. It seems to be maltier than some Asian lagers. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth pale malt and adjunct flavor. It goes down easy and finishes clean with a bit of malt sweetness. It's dry with a slight green bottle skunkiness, but nothing too off putting. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good Asian lager. Like I said, it's got more malt flavor than most, which seem almost entirely made with rice and corn. It's smooth and clean; an easy drinker."
"D - Not bad at all, I'd choose this over many of the other departures from our beloved selection of beer, but overall it is very forgettable. As far as I'm concerned, if I had to choose between Heineken and this, I'd probably take this."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce green glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours out a straight up yellow with a thin head that fizzes out to nothing. Looks absolutely still. Smells of pale malts, graininess, little alcohol, and has a pretty strong solvent edge. Tastes pretty much like a lighter Heineken with all flavors subdued. Faint malt, faint, graininess, nearly non-existent hops, and has an odd but somewhat pleasing twang to it at the end that reminds me of all-sorghum beer. Mouthfeel is pretty light and fizzy but a little sticky as well. This is OK and a bit odd, really. Wouldn't buy it again, but as far as Chinese beers available to me, I'd take this over Tsingtao."
"hop and the pretty green bottle. Meh."
"Overall- Blah. Very little flavor. Not worth the time."
"Aroma is strong, typical of a lager - malty and with a bite - but better than most lagers I have tried. Color is a typical lager yellow with a fairly thick and not persistent white head. Flavor is malty and rich, with hints of hop flavor and bitterness, as well as a good alcohol zing. This lager seems to fill the mouth as few lagers, especially American macro-brews, do."
"D - Well, I drank it really fast, and I don't think it was to get the experience over with. It actually went down nicely and was quite easy to drink."
"drinkability is great. this is a brew that has a good balance of aroma and taste, while remaining refreshing and light on the stomach. that being said, nothing stands out about it, it is just your run-of-the-mill pale lager."
"Poured into a pilsener glass a straw golden color with a thick white head that builds up and then dies down quickly. Smell is some spices, and rice. The taste is a little sweet wit some Honey and maybe a little ginger as well. Mouth feeling is light and a little smooth creamy as well."
"Drinkability: I bought one just to try. As I finish it off there is no need to ever have another. Not very good. There are much better macro lagers available for much less. Skip it."
"This beer poured a golden straw color with very foamy bleach white head. It had a strong smell of grain. The taste was a little skunky and very light. It had a European lager quality and really didnt have a strong character. It was clean and refreshing and went down smooth with very little body. In all I would say this beer is very drinkable and certainly worth a try. I would recommend spending too much time looking for it because youll be disappointed but if you come across one go for it. Its a non offensive beer."
"Overall Impression: Yawn. Standard issue Euro Lager Heineken knock off."
"A very light amber color with a thin head that disappears quickly. Very fine carbonation and not much of an aroma, maybe a slight corn/rice hint. Taste is clean, rice, mild and refreshing and kind of fizzy/tangy on the tongue. I pick up a wheaty quality that isn't too bad. It reminds me generally of the other quality beers from China/Japan.light and refreshing. A bit too watery for me."
"Harbin pours a golden yellow with a white head from a six hundred ml green bottle. I feel the need to describe the packaging of this beer, there is a green bottle with a foil neck cover and a white paper/plastic with chinese script tied around the bottle by a gold cord. Very fancy presentation. Typical Euro lager aroma, hoppy bordering on skunky. Not bad, taste is in the same vein as Heineken. Pretty good for an Asian lager."
"Decent AB backed option when eating sushi, remember they have stakes in Kirin as well and I'm sure somebody as a piece of Sapporo products but here it goes. Appears a clear bright straw golden hue with an eggshell white colored head dwindles quickly leaves specks of sporadic lacing. Aroma some mild sweetness cooked veggies, corn and rice, herbal hop presence mild skunk ""green bottle"" effect very mild though. Flavor mild bitterness light herbal grassiness hops cleanse the palate well sweetness is backed by corn and rice very light but blends nicely with the sushi, wasabi, and ginger flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied moderate sturdy carbonation industrial lager in all it's mediocrity. Drinkability decent for what it is give it a shot if eating some sushi goes well I must say."
"....a surprise seeing as the other 2 chinese lagers weren't so great, and the price was good too. worth a try if you like pale lagers!"
"Avoid!"
"D - This is an okay beer. Fairly typical for the style. I don't recommend it unless you are a big fan of Euro Pale Lagers."
"Sweey corny bottle smell. Pours to a golden clear color. Not much head. Good mouthfeel carbonation is right. Taste is a good balance of maklts and hopping. Not too sweet no bitterness detectable. Quite smooth. Typical lager taste throughout. A good basic lager without bells and whistles."
"Very well-made. A very nice beer."
"PS. It didn't."
"Very average, nothing I would seek out."
"There are many fine beverages from Asia but unfortunately this is not one of them. I was actually reminded of many of the US malt liquors out there when I sampled this beer. A few sips and it was poured right in the sink"
"Caught somewhere between German pilsner and American macro, not quite enough yeast character for a Euro pale lager. Theres a touch of hops and bready grains, theres hints of adjunct, but the corn or rice doesnt dominate the beer like most macros. If this were cheap and not in green bottles, I might have it again."
"DA:"
"Drinkability: A really clean lager, lighter on the malt, pretty heavy hops, and a very dry finish would it make it good to pair with any meal where the flavors would not over power this beer."
"D: More drinkable than I expected. It's not a fantastic beer, but it's a decent lager."
"Very light mouthfeel with bits of grainyness. Goes down easy enough,like water, just needs more flavor."
"It was such a nice looking bottle too..."
"A light straw in color with a white head that sticks around awhile. Smell is skunky with rice and grain. The taste has a sweetness along with rice, but overall rather muted in flavor. A simple lager with a light - med. mouthfeel and light carbonation that is generally not to bad."
"Drinkablitly is the strong point here.."
"This beer was drinkable not drainworthy."
"A really easy to drink beer, if not a great one. I actually rather like it."
"I had no idea what to expect from Harbin Lager. What I got was the best Chinese beer I've ever had. I assume that 'affiliated with Anheuser-Busch' means the boys from St. Louis made sure the brewing standards were up to snuff. If so, it definitely shows in the final product."
"Price: $2.49 for a 16oz bottle at Liquor Barn Hurstbourne"
"Really well-made. Superbly balanced. Quite nice."
"Harbin is a respectable beer. If I was faced with a poor beer selection at a Chinese restaurant I would order this over BMC, Heineken, or most other Asian lagers. I would never consider buying a six-pack of this beer even though every damn grocery store carries it. Thank you AB! I purchased a snazzy 600ml Chinese New Year bottle with rice paper covering. I couldnt say no. Maybe it was going to be good? And, in some ways, it is. Ill finish my bottle. It is worth a try in a pinch. Not that bad."
"Well, it came in a pretty little sake'-like bottle. At least that was my justification for buying the beer. Afterwhich, I realized that this was not a good beer. Green bottle Euro-type beers almost always promise disaster. The offset of aromas give a tom-catty aroma; pungent and musky; nearly skunked. The look is a near-fizzy carbonation, disapointing retention, but hey; it has a clear straw color. The taste was of grain, rice, and malt. Very sweet, similar to raw corn sugar. Very little complexity or variety. The feel is a slick coating of the mouth. Finishes with a mild hop flavor, earthiness, and pronounced sweetness. The beer was just not that good."
"Though the pakaging is fantastic, this is what I assume to be the Chinese version of Macro. This ""Euro Pale Lager"" pours a lighter apple juice with a quickly fading perfectly white foamy head. Smelled a bit skunky, common for me when comparing the nose's on a lot of European Lagers. Taste was fairly clean, though there was subtle skunky bitterness that thankfully didn't translate into the finish. This light bodied lager would indeed pair well with spicy Chinese fair though, lending it's thirst quenching abilities when you need it most....Enjoy"
"The whiff of euro skunk lead into a sharp bite of hop, this had a decent taste of malt and hop. Surprised me, and I would say a full sixer of these would not be a bad afternoon. More of a lawnmower brew  but at $7 a sixer that is a little pricey. And the bottles were only 11.2 ounce. Also, no dating, so Im not confident how fresh this may be."
"Pours a bright gold, with the slightest hint of red, pillowy head that eventually fades to the slightest bit of lacing. Aroma is a little sweet with fruity malty tones and the slight nip of a floral hop aroma. Taste is much like the nose, with maybe a little more hop presence. Carbonation is soft, and pehaps a little lacking, a little more pop would do this beer good. All in all not unpleasant and I wouldn't say no if given one, but..."
"Bottle is notable as it came wrapped in an unusual silky paper sleeve. Pours a light golden amber color with a bright white head. Nose is probably the highlight of the beer with notes of piney hops and perfume. The carbonation is nice but the beer is too thinit comes across like watered down champagne. Taste is watered down grain and a bit of grassy hops. Might be acceptable on a hot day, but thats about it."
"Another sample from my AB buddy. This one is just like drinking a good old IC light. That said, its not horrible, so if you out in an exclusive Chinese restaurant and it all they got, then give it a swill."
"Light toasted grains and corn come through on the profile with a tad of sweetness. Rather smooth and drinkable. Maybe bland and uninteresting, but somewhat refreshing too. In many respects, I think this beer is true to the style and it lacks that awful skunk kick associated with most Euro-lagers. Worth trying for novelty sake, but not recommended."
"I rate this pretty high on drinkability because I truly enjoyed this one."
"Brilliantly clear honey, topped with a big, puffy white head. I wish the head hung around a bit longer, but it was impressive at the start. Fairly inoffensive aroma, with soapy, dank, skunky hops in that Heineken way. Some corny notes, with crispy pils malt. The flavor is altogether mild, reminding me of a Bud clone. Funny, as I'd drank half of this before sitting down to type a review, and saw they were affiliated with AB. Mild, semi-watery malt fading off into a lightly hopped, floral/soapy finish. Some mineral water notes, leaving off very dry and vacant. There is a nice crispness to the carbonation, and the body is light and easy. It basically tastes like Bud with much fancier packaging. On closer inspection, i even see they have the horse-drawn beer cart above the brand name. The packaging's really what grabbed me. Amazing how appearance will sway the consumer, even an educated one, huh? I didn't dislike this one, but it doesn't bring anything to the table in terms of flavor. You never know. It could have been great. Stranger things have happened when I pop open unfamiliar beers. I'd rather have a Tsingtao if I'm going the chinese route."
"OK drinkable and a notch above the usual microbrewery lagers but that doesn't really make this a great beer. I can't see buying this again; I would buy Pabst Blue Ribbon first."
"A drinkable lager, yes, perhaps a bit boring, but could easily have a few when in the mood for a simple lager in the slower summer months."
"Overall: This was a cheap pick-up during a recent trip down to HiTimes in Costa Mesa. A brew from China, all delivered is some fancy looking packaging. Something different, but nothing exciting."
"Drinks okay, nothing special, but better than BMC"
"Pours a yellow apple juice color with a virtually no head. Corny smell hits first off, then slightly sweet malts and an ever so slight dustiness that I'm assuming is some hops. On the palate, bland and a bit sweet, with little in the way of hop bitterness (on a bit comes in at the end). The end finishes with sweet dried corn. Thin mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, not an appetizing beer, and not even really drinkable given that sickly corn smell/flavor."
"Drinkability  Okay, but as it is twice the price of a Tsingtao where I live, I can't find a reason to order a second bottle"
"Actually very nice presentation ( if a little odd with it being wrapped in some fancy clean room hair net thing with a gold bow), and the bottle/label is very cool. 600ml Dark green bottle. Reasonably nice looking lager, deeper yellow than usual with a nice sized bubbly pure white head. Aroma ..ohhhh well, I will leave it at the ""hairnet"" did not stop this beer from getting skunked bad, only other aroma i pick up is a graininess .\taste while nothing special is better than the aroma, just plain lager here, some fruitiness and a touch of grassy hop. Rather watery palate. After all the money and thought they put into the packaging, i would have liked at least some effort put into the beer. Not horrible but far from good."
"If you took the label off this and served it, I would swear it is Tsingtao. Apparently, this light colored, light bodied lager, with little taste or aroma, is a Chinese staple. Not much more to say about this, other than that if I have it again, Ill make sure I do so with Chinese food instead of a stand alone. Obviously, A-B is trying to tap into the enormous Chinese populace with this purchase."
"The pour is gold with a large fluffy head. The aroma and taste have mild saaz-y hops and practically nothing else. There no offensive adjuncts. I don't see how this light, flavorless brew can reflex the tradition and culture of China's most northern province of Heilongjang. I'm not an expert on the culture of Heilongjang, but still..."
"The mouthfeel was very light. No cleansing. Was somewhat ""slippery"" feeling. Not good. Overall, this beer looks nice in the bottle and in the glass, but there is not much going on after that. Nothing offensive, but no character."
