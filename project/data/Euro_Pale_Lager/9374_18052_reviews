"When I think of beer, I think of the taste of svyturys extra. Not extraordinary, but tasty"
""
"500ml bottle poured into a dimpled mug.  Pours cloudy golden with a  Very small half finger head. Aromas of grass, citrus and slight skunk. Tastes malty but not overpowering. Earthy grass taste also present. Overall a slightly above average lager."
""
""
""
"Baltic Lager that has a nice malt character. Hops head need not try this, but those who like to expand give it a shot. It goes great with Central/ Eastern Euro meals."

"Clear golden color , big white head. Aroma of malt , bread and grass. Malty taste with grassy notes, minimal bitterness. Average beer."

"When you first pour this Lithuanian staple into your glass, you notice the pale golden beer culminating into a small head of carbonation that builds up, softly clinging to the glass. It isn't filtered, so you get some of the malty thicker sediment in each bottle. It tastes of corn with a hint of barley right before the leafy finish. It doesn't have a very unique feel to it, but it's a beer I would drink while I'm socializing. Not the best beer in the world, but one I enjoy and will continue to drink. Cheers!"

"Another so-so, half-assed national corporate lager, trotted out as the best a country has to offer (like a Budweiser screed), once again. There are real malt lager tendencies here, but the corners that have been cut almost glow with precision and obviousness. As far as I'm concerned, if this engenders good feelings about the land that you bailed on, then the rest of our provincial complement is all yours."

"Ekstra poured a clear golden yellow colour with about 1"" of short-lived fluffy white head which left some minor spotting down the glass. Its aroma was simple but satisfying, being dominated by sweet malts with undertones of grassy hops. The beer's flavour very much followed its aroma, beginning with a strong, pleasant malty sweetness which gives way to a very mild hop bitterness, with a clean, dry finish. Ekstra had a soft mouthfeel and I would describe it as fairly light bodied. There's nothing complex about this beer...it is simply a solid, enjoyable brew, especially for those like myself who lean towards sweet, malty tastes. At $2.35 per 500 ml bottle, the beer is reasonably priced, and that Lithuanian gent in the liquor store did not steer me wrong!"

"Pours a clear light gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some grassy and hay aromas. Taste is much the same with a corn flakes flavor on the finish. There is a very mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but nothing very exciting."

"A nice lager to begin with, it's well balanced although it is quite basic and the flavours are all pretty light with the exception of the grassy hops and lager malts . Not a classic export lager but a nice one and one that I might be inclined to try again."
""
"And no the beer wasnt bad."
""
""
""
"Could us more carbonation."
"Really a better than average Euro pale lager. There are countless examples of the style out there with little to set them apart. This beer, however, has no off flavors at all and is quite refreshing. Something I will seek out again."

"Overall: a very average lager that feels like it would get tired fast"

"While the clear golden sunshine hue is stunning, it’s missing pretty much all of the head that was there. Fresh-cut hay and cracker-like maltiness in the aroma. Uniform smoothness does well to add a huge refreshing quality. Lots of pale malt flavor, with hints of baked apple and delicate floral hoppiness. Perhaps the slightest suggestion of sulphur here, but it’s really not something that pops out. Very clean throughout, with a finish that lands dry. The label notes that it is unpasteurized, which is certainly noticed. A standup lager—worth a go."
""
"Pours a dark golden straw. The light, meringue-like head is insubstantial yet retains well enough. Lacing is splotchy. Sweet bread dough aroma and a good portion of earthy, woody hop aroma. A little bit of apple sweetness in the nose distracts from the soft malts and hops and, when combined, gives off a horseblanket-like twang. Tastes like a very old apple pie; malts are sweet and smooth, but does not finish clean. Maybe too much sulphur, but a slight earthy/mushroomy taste in the middle. Hops are not as aggressive as in the nose. Feels almost too smooth and could use some soluble carbonation. Not as dull as others of its ilk."
"Hazy, pale straw colored with a decent looking head of shock white fizz that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Lemon zest, herbal hops and untoasted grain make for a pleasant nose on this one. Well balanced but a bit more Pils than EPL, hay and raw grain with just the right amount of hop bitterness and carbonation to clean the palate. Ekstra is on the leaner side of medium bodied with a seltzery, tongue scrubbing carbonation. An above average import lager."
"Final Grade: 3.26, a C+."
"I've certainly had American craft lager at similar quality and a worse price point. Bottom line, worth a try... if you trust your retailer, give it a whirl."
"There must be some good examples out there, assuming this is a real style. Seems to me more of a lowest common denominator manufactured products."
"Picked up a bottle at EuroMarket. The skunking was a bit rough on the aroma, but after about 20 minutes it let up and there was a touch of toasty grains. The beer reminded me of other northern Euro lagers, like Okocim, as it has a little more character than Heineken, but is still no pilsner. You can actually taste the barley and feel a balancing hops bitterness. However, given the bad condition of the beer, I probably wouldn't drink this unless I were actually in Lithuania."
"D: Decent attempt at a brew, nothing more."
"Dr: Poorly priced, especially in Ireland, and not particularly a good beer."
"Glad I grabbed one of these randomly on a beer run and will definitely try it again. It's not blowing me away, but could be a nice session beer for the summer months."
"very crisp tasting with a tiny bitter finish. drinkable and boring and generic. nothing stands out here at all."
"One of several decent lagers from the Baltics. Hops are maybe a bit light, even for the style. I wouldn't put it against a German brew, but it's head and shoulders above macro-lagers."
"Overall - Basically the same as all the other euro lagers available in Ontario other than the fact that it had a bit of a honey sweetness to it. I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Overall, Ekstra Lager seems like it's the Lithuania version of a macrobrew to me. Although better than its US counterparts, it lacks any real substance. As someone who likes to try as many new beers as possible, I do not resent trying this (especially since I never had a beer of Lithuania origin), but I won't be going back for seconds."
"You really got to drink this one cold. Started getting hard to drink halfway through the first glass. I see no reason to buy this ever again. Buy any other canned Euro Lager you can find in Dépanneurs instead."
"I bought this partly because I like trying as many beers as possible and partly because I've never had a beer from Lithuania before. Pours a pale yellow colour that starts off with huge head, but it dissipates fairly quickly to almost nothing. Faint lacing on the glass. Smells of grainy malt with the slightest hint of grassy hops. Clean, sweet flavour, some bitterness in the aftertaste. Just an ok lager, though pretty indistinguishable between 100 other European lagers that we can buy in Ontario."
"Appearance is golden straw in color with a nice thick crisp head. Smell of grain with a light honey sweetness. Taste has that eastern European lager flavor thats grainy and ends lightly bitter sweet. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Athough its nothing exiting, it's not bad at all."
"Jake"
"D - Drinkable in the sense that if you're not paying attention you could throw a few of these back."
"Take it or leave it, this is one of the better mass-produced overseas EPLs I've had."
"I had to edit due to the fact that this brew really was just average compared to other beers"
"If you ask me, those changes would have definitely helped although, truth be told, they really only need to make one to turn this into an appreciably flavourful and drinkable lager: cut out the rice. That should be something that any brewery with actual ""brewers"" - as oppose to ""technologists"" - would have been able to figure out on its own."
"Drinkability is decent. Fairly poor tasting, forgettable beer."
"Good drinkability due to the relatively low abv, light body, and simplicity. No worries of palate fatigue with this one."
"500ml bottle from Lithuana, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top this brew smells alot like an adjunct macro but there is a hint of the Purity act and some light hopping. The brew pours to a bright yellow with a bright white multi-sized bubble head. Taste is lager all the way. Slightly bitter run of the mill with good carbonation and a steady flat bitter aftertaste. Not too much here on this one, could be any macro. A little sweeter than most and the hopping isn't bad but this one doesn't really rate the fancy foil top. Side note: reviewing the bottle it does list rice as an ingredient so this is an adjunct."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, malty, a tad sweet, quite refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Meh. Doesn't taste like much, but I suppose there's also nothing offensive here. I wouldn't buy this again."
"Drinkability: this beer might do on a warm afternoon looking for some light refreshment, but on a cold evening it doesn't cut it. Easy to drink but flavorwise it will leave you wanting more."
"pour is a yellow with a wonderful lacy white head. a rather simple beer of european caliber to a american marco but a more distinct hop quality. mild lemon zest and grass nose with a palate of basically that... some crisp straw qualities. nice and mild. not sweet like most americans... not particular yeasty. average with a nice look and feel."
"Pours a very clear light yellow colored body. Grainy aroma, corn flavored. Light taste. Corn, lagery, grainy taste. Very vegetably. Not bad, but a little heavy. Wish these lagers tasted better, this one was too vegetably and corny tasting."
"I didn't mind this beer but compared too how it looked everything else was going to be a bit of a let down. worth trying and not a bad way too knock an obscure country off your list"
"Very easy to drink. Would I buy again? Only if very cheap. It was a gift, so I don't know the price."
"Overall, an average beer that is drinkable but you won't remember much about it later. Better than your standard mass market beers but below the good flavor of most craft beers. Rotation: avail here. One and done for me since not very flavorful."
"Bottle, 350 ml. Mmmm, not that bad as I expected. Pale golden colour, normal head that doesn't hold but leaves some lace. Smell is fresh, sweet malts but also some floral hops. Light body, simple pleasant flavor, and thirst quenching mouth feel, taste is mostly sweet, but it has some grain and lemon touch. Nothing to die for, but not that bad at all and it's refreshing."
"It is not a factor in the beer, but it was a most impressive CAN. It was made of pressed-aluminum, like pressed-tin signs, so that the side and bottom had wavy grooves plus the name and logo were raised. Yow!"
"It says proudly on the can - ""Our Very Finest"". I am glad I know that many Lithuanian beers are way better than this. Never ever again."
"Really not all that bad. Aroma was quite pleasant: More sweet than bitter, very fresh (from a can so no light struck probs), very ""beery"". Poured with a big, foamy head that settles down to a thin cover and some lace. Color is a clear pale yellow. Flavor is like aroma. Body is a touch thin. Ok carbonation. Clean, pleasant finish. Definitely a session beer. Got this on at Sam's in Chi."
"Lithuania's most popular beer (so the packaging says) is probably, or at least hopefully, not Lithuania's most good-looking beer. In fact I would call the appearance of this beer insipid: a pale canary-yellow littered with clusters of large bubbles that rise up into a stark white head with poor retention. Not much to smell, either; cornbread, tin, and dish soap dominate. Somewhat odd tasting, but not really bad, with some unusual processed grain flavors that are very reminiscent of corn flakes - strange, because if I am to believe the label, there is no corn in this beer. Rummy sweetness sidelines whatever pleasantness the malts may have to offer, while a whip-crack of hop bitterness and a completely unnecessary tangent of alcohol help distract from the not-dry-enough finish. This beer is not as highly carbonated as it looks, and the mouthfeel suffers for it. Strange beer, this one - I can imagine it being kinda-sorta refreshing if it's kept exceedingly cold, but otherwise... not for me. Sorry, Lithuania."
"Conclusion: This is a great quenching beer with FAR more character than 90% of the offerings in this category...this was great with a German bratwurst and sauerkraut"
"I noticed Ekstra on the bottom shelf of a cooler behind the bar at a banquet facility but it wasn't mentioned when I asked about their brands of beer. Compared with the other choices, US megabrands, it was really a standout! The head was big and didn't collapse. While the color was a bit hazy, the taste was good and refreshing, not too fizzy and certainly no alcohol taste. It was a pleasant introduction to Lithuanian beers and I'll be looking for this one again."
"D - This one is alright but I'm not going to plan my next vacation to tour the brewery."
"D: Low ABV and dry finish makes this a decent session brew. This is my first Lithuanian beer review and I'm not mad at the country for brewing this. I got it as a gift so I don't know how expensive it is but this is a solid lager."
"Thanks to Vaidas for providing this bottle, adding Lithuania to my map. vyturys Ekstra is a sparkling, slightly hazy, light golden lager with a thin, dense, waxy white head that fades pretty quickly, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is bit muted, but slightly sweetened with round, light malt. There are notes of lemon, hay, soft grass and medicine. It is light bodied and a bit chalky and alkaline in the mouth. It's actually not too watery. This beer tastes a lot boozier than it is. There is a strong fusel taste, followed by corn, solvent and black pepper. The hops almost come through at the finish with their soft grassiness, but the toll of the alcohol(s) drowns everything out. This kind of tastes like a 40. I could see drinking this in a dimly lit place, while chain smoking."
"D: Very drinkable, would not get again due to price but glad I had this brew."
"D-Paired with lentil lamb ragu. Went well, but the phenolic character somewhat ruined a decent match."
"remarkable here."
"16.9 bottle from CL Specs @ $6.29 .... Pours a slight hazed golden colour with a big fluffy white head ... simple smell ... taste is quite simple too, doesn't seem offensive but lacks any real character.... lacing kicks A ... Decent, bet it's better in the mother land!"
"D - Drinkable, if a little bit forgettable. Not a bad basic lager by any means. I wish our macro lagers were even slightly this tasty here in the US."
"Fair hit of yeast on the front palate descends into a slight, barely perceptible hop bitterness. (That was ripped straight from the back label but it's a perfect description). Drinkable but very bland (That's what SHOULD be on the back label), could use a lot more bittering and just more flavour in general. Pretty poor overall actually."
"D: Overall a beer is very sweet, somewhat bland and non offensive to the taste buds. Would drink this over any of the American macros if no other option was available but in limited quantity."
"This is a nice, very drinkable Dortmunder/Export. It is categorized here as an EPL, but is a Dortmunder/Export, and fits the latter style very well, with a good, forward taste for the style, IMO."
"Pours a slightly hazed gold with a white head. Nose is of bitter and doughy character. Flavor is hoppy with an almost earthen flavor that borders on tasting ""dirty"". Feel is a bit high on carbonation. Drinkable, sure. But overall, this is basically an average brew with nothing interesting or unique going on."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with plenty of foamy white head that sticks around for a while and clings to the glass. Smells like noble hops and yeast and light malt. Not much spicyness or floral scents, but it's still pleasant. Tastes dry and a bit sour at the same time, not a whole lot of sweetness of any kind, but there's hop flavor there. Finishes sour/dry as well. Mouthfeel is foamy and a little creamy. Overall, it's fairly drinkable as it's not too strong in any one area, but it's not a real enjoyable beer for me."
"Easy going, but after the initial taste, it loses it's luster."
"D-Why import something like this. I am sure Lithiuanian expats mightbe looking for a taste of home but this is awful. Maybe this is good at home? I doubt it."
"I tried this beer on September 13, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe' in Toronto. The beer poured a translucent dark gold with a thin white head. The aroma was malty with hints of grass. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with high carbonation. The taste was very grainy."
"All in all, not bad, in fact it would hold up well against other better known European lagers and is certainly superior to all the mass produced ones. Glad I tried it."
"Better than many eastern-European lagers I've had, with at least noticible hop character."
"By no means an unpleasant experience , just a very ""European ""one,"
"D: Quite a drinkable brew with a pronounced hop presence that's above average, making it a good call, whatever the hell its style may be."
"There's not much to say that hasn't been said in other reviews, pretty standard euro lager here. Clear and fizzy appearance; faintly malty, organic, slightly funky aroma; bland but not particularly clean taste, with a slightly astringent bitterness. Not the worst beer ever, but nothing I'd ever care to drink again."
"I will give it the benefit of the doubt as far as mouthfeel goes. I tried not to keep it in my mouth long enough to feel it. I hope there are better offerings in Lithuania for the good people over there. If not, we must start a beer drive immediately. Nobody deserves this."
"Mouthfeel is super-light with heavy carbonation. Call me crazy, but it seems like I've had this beer before..."
"thank Crikey it was cheap...certainly prefer Old Mil. to this swill."
"Pours a bizarrely pale, clear yellow. Corny aroma, even more corny flavour. ""Mmmm corny!"" I believe was grub's reaction. Mild kool-aid grape background, oddly enough. Maybe it was just chemicals. Bleh."
"This was a nice easy drinking lager that has a real nice smooth water chemistry that adds a extra depth to the overall flavor profile. The pale gold color and slight white cap holds a nice aroma of small malt and a little balance of hops. The body was a medium density and it makes for a good beer to drink at the club or with dinner."
"Thanks for the sample Grub!"
"drinkability is not good."
"Tastes quite sweet pale malt, corny DMS-type flavors. Persistent light noble hops help to balance the sweetness and save the beer from a drain pour. The hops are odd tasting, never tasted a hop profile quite like it before. Mouth is lightly sticky, finishes with the hops then finishes clean. This is below average but not by much. I was expecting far worse."
"Not bad, not great. I've had worse national beers. Pours very yellow, slightly pale with a white head that fades away quickly. Smell is very faint, with a little bit of sweet cereal grain and some soft hops. Taste is crisp, very slightly sweet and with some faint but noticeable hops. Tastes pilsnerish. Mouthfeel is pretty crisp with a good carbonation level, but there is a little bit of soapiness in it as well. Drinkability is so-so. Its refreshing and not cloying."
"Taste also very mellow. Reminds me a bit of a weizen, some banana and pear, wheat malt, yeast and a very very slight lemon acidity. I'm really confused here, this is not what a normal Euro Pale tastes like. And the cloudiness is much more like a Weizen as well. Maybe bottled wrong in Lithuania? Mouthfeel is a bit bitey, with a sharp carbonation, maybe a touch watery, but not terrible. I think this is an extremely drinkable beer, and I'm finding hard to see what all the negative fuss is about."
"Svyturys Ekstra is far from wonderful beer, but it's at least the equal of its stablemate (1784) that is actually considered to be a German Pilsener. I don't imagine that there's much to choose from in Lithuania, so I have to believe that Lithuanians are pretty pleased to have some halfway decent beer."
" A quick pour yields a 3 finger head which quickly falls to a whisper over the light golden liquid. Taste is ghostly malty, with fleeting hops in there somewhere. Where this beer shines is in the mouthfeel, if served cold. It's creamy, with an almost fruity residual aftertaste. Nice."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy light amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight wheat nose even though this is a lager. Starts sweet but hops take over that leaves a metallic after taste. Amazing that it won a gold medal. $2.69 for a 500ml bottle from John's Market Tigard, Or."
"M&D: a light-bodied lager, semi-sharp in carbonation, and the texture falls thinner as it goes, but it's easy to quaff, and benefits from a bitter edge prevailing from the mid-point onwards that is welcomed by a Bitter-lover like me. Not a lager to write home about, but not a terrible beer, either. Trying it once in a life time is quite sufficient though, and luckily I actually didn't pay for it~~"
"Overall - A pretty poor lager... Nothing really to recommend about it..."
"A surprisingly average (I expected garbage for the price) Dortmunder style lager from Lithuania. Pours piss yellow with outstanding carbonation streaming and a generous white cloud that dissipates to a ¼ inch. Minimal lacing. Aroma is quarried rock, dust, lime, corn, powdered sugar, and iron. Taste is biting but quickly turns to corn sweetness with attached rice notes. Metallic and rock notes persist. Body is very light. Drinkability is pretty low. After a few gulps my stomach is becoming queasy. Its not as bad as some of the reviews would make it sound but how on Earth did this win a gold at the world beer cup?"
"Pours a hazy golden with a foamy head that leaves some serious white residue but the taste isnt too bad. Taste is kind of grainy and corny. Leaves a slight metallic aftertaste, nothing too bad. Has an odd cracker smell. Regular lager color and head after that. A little bitter and malty, however, nothing really stands out. Just an ordinary imported dollar bottle of beer."
"Crystal clear, thin yellow colour. Big fluffy white head from the pour - thins out quickly, but leaves a bit of lace behind. Sweet, lemony aroma - smells acidic. Sweet, little bitterness with lemon. There's an unpleasant herbal character as it warms, slightly metallic finish, and cooked rice towards the end. Creamy body from the carbonation, actually a little surprising. Another forgettable euro-lager."
"Overall a decent brew. A fair price and a nice light bodied change from the heavier strong euro lagers that I have been sampling these past few days."
"Apparently it was in a ""world beer cup 2000"" though. Doesn't say if it won or not."
"Drinkability... well, now I can say I had a beer from Lithuania, but I wouldn't try this one again."
"I drank the bottled version of this beer labeled vyturys 1784 Ekstra. Appearance is similar to most German-styled Pilsners a medium gold-yellow with a light head. The smell is typical Pils a light hoppy fragrance. The mouth feel is light, crisp, and frothy. I just wasnt impressed overall. Please take into account that Im not a Pilsner guy but do have the opinion that some Pils are better than others. This wasnt one of them. Tasted like a watery version of a PBR."
"This is mediocre. Among the worst Euro lagers Ive tried so far."
"But if you can find this, it's definatly worth a try. It is relativly cheap and comes in single bottles. If you want to get into Baltic beers, this is a good starting point."
"500 ml bottle. This beer pours out a pale yellow with a large head off dense white foam. Lots of rising bubbles well after the pour. Malty aroma with lemon and grassy hops. Bready malt flavor is a little too sweet, but partially balanced by the grassy, bitter hops. Crisp and refreshing. Light to medium body. High carbonation. Not a very complex beer, but way better than some of the reviews would have you believe. A good choice if you want a light, refreshing beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Can't really complain, this beer is forgettable and unimpressive, I would definitely skip it."
"Sweet upfront with malts and some grain. Bitter, but weak hop flavor creeps up and stays in the finish. A little grassy. Nothing bad, but not enough to keep me interested. The mouth is appropriate and finishes clean. Better than Heineken, but that isn't saying much."
"A good friend gave me this bottle. I appreciate it. The brewery should invest all of the income it earns from beer loving loyal Lithuanians everywhere in some better ingredients and personnel. I write this as a fan of Baltic lager beer in general."
"Hoppy and with a bitter-sweet aftertaste, Svyturys 1784 Ekstra is solid but not remarkable. The label on the 500 ml bottle doesn't indicate what type of beer this is but I am assuming it is a pilsener. I bought this beer in the LCBO in Ontario and, while it is still within its freshness date-range I would like to try one in Vilnius to make a fair decision."
"I found this most drinkable. I will have to go against the grain on this one and declare it a good helles."
"Wow, Lithuanians know how to make beer! Who knew! The Ekstra pours a crystal-clear straw-gold body with yellow highlights beneath a full head of bright white foam that holds really well and leaves some very nice, wide rings of lace about the glass. The nose is clean and bright with sweet, adjunct malt and grassy hops. It's lightly crisp in the mouth with a moderate carbonation and dextrinous, medium body. The flavor delivers a semi-grainy, obviously adjunct enhanced, semi-sweet maltiness; backed by a solid bitterness; and peppered with lemony, grassy, and herbal hop flavors. It finishes dry, hoppy, and refreshing. This is actually a great beer for a summer BBQ; and it also pairs well with a wide variety of foods including some Indian and Thai foods."
"I to am surprised at how low this was rated. Sure this is not MY style of beer but the one I drank was clean fresh, on the malty side (as it should be) with a well placed lemony grassy hop flavor. It poured straw yellow with a good but quickly falluing head. Frankly I do not know what else someone would expect out of a Euro Pale Lager."
"330 ml bottle, now available in Norway. Golden colour, large foamy head. Strong perfumed aroma of shampoo, flowers, molasses and green apples, not entirely pleasant. Flavour is grassy with lemon notes, some sweetness. Low bitterness. Drinkable, but no masterpiece."
"Poured from a 500 ml brown bottle, the back label possesses the numbers chart for a best before date, but nothing is notched off to give me any idea of how fresh this is. Pours out a clear straw colour with a massive cloud of foamy stark white head. A fair amount of lacing. The head's about as good as it gets regarding the appearance of this stuff. The nose is mild with bready malt and traces of grain and corn, the slightest trace of something resembling hops lingers in the distance. The flavour, while not bad in an awful way, is very nondescript, and what can be discerned doesn't really paint this beer more favorably. A very grainy profile, a bit tart due to this, with a dry finish and grainy aftertaste. Well along the way of the aftertaste some faint herbal hops start to emerge. Better late than never, but I'm not sure why they bothered at all. The mouthfeel is light with a bit of carbonation, although pretty watery overall. If this stuff won a gold award like it says on the label then I'd be wary of trying the rest of the stuff in the competition as well. Towards the end of the glass I'm beginning to contemplate a sink pour, the flavour tends to degenerate the more I drink it as it warms up. Nope, I'll pass on this one next time."
"What is it about most Euro-lagers? I got through about a third of this, despite it's claim to be an ""award winner"". Typical sweet, grassy euro lager taste. Skunky smell, and almost sickly sweet in the taste. I'd prefer Bud over this one."
"Taste, now I am surprised, many here did negative reviews on this beer, maybe we should drink this beer expired. The taste was shy hops, fruit, banana ester with a sweetness following, not great, but just fine. A shy bitterness also composed this beer, a tiny bit dry too."
"Not acceptable to a true hophead."
"The 3rd of the 10 LCBO slavic lagers to be tried. Possibly the best as this is a Dortmunder-Helles style and Im partial to them. In the glass we see a pale straw, slight haze, rockey 2 finger frothy cap with fair retention and lace. Moderate carbonation. Nose is promising; sweet bready malts over a slight citrus note, in keeping with a helles. Good lager body, sturdy malt pronouncement, very well balanced with herbal hop presence which adds some bittering in the medium finish..the rice is barely detectable...very nice put together little helles....and a heck of a good find at the LCBO as I expected all the new dozen east block imports to be bland and characterless as the others I had tried"
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow color beer with a medium head with standard retention for the style. Taste is quite crisp with some noticeable bitterness at the end. Im not very knowledgeable on the style but would say that I enjoyed it more then some other eastern European lager out there."
"Poured a pale, slightly cloudy, yellow straw colour. Small white fluffy head in the beginning which subsided to a thing haze over the surface of the liquid. Decent lacing. The smell is quite faint and whith the exception of a bit of hops and a tiny bit of malt, it really doesn't smell like much of anything. The taste has a little bit of hoppy bitterness to it and again, a tiny bit of malt, but other than that, there really isn't anything present here to get excited about. The mouthfeel is decent, though it is quite thin and lifeless, I have had worse, but not much worse. This isn't terrible, but one can see ""terrible"" from where this one stands."
"Your average lager beer at best. Poured a clear golden color with a great pillowy head that lasted. Smelt of grain and gym socks. Tasted thick and malty with a slight ammount of grain in there. Not that bad of a lager but nothing that stands out too much either."
"OK drinkable, it is overly sweet like a Bitburger which it greatly resembles in flavor + some cardboard."
"Uggh."
"This poured a nice deep golden, smell was a bit fruity, this tasted WAY!!! better than most of the euro-lager's I've had! good drinkability! no problem at all!!!, I would recommend this to anyone searching for a new euro-lager to try! further more, this was one of the best Euro""s that I've tried!"
"Taste is pure malty goodness with the herb-grass like elements. Luckily the pinchy smell doesn't come through on the palate. This is an excellent gold colored beer. It finishes a little buttery but in a nice fresh way. Drinkabilty is exceptionally good-- I could drink 5+ of these no problem."
"The beer erupts from the 500ml bottle a limpid gold with a generous creamy white head and after its demise; the lace forms a thin sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is sweet malt; fresh, crisp, clean with the start somewhat sweet and the grain profile light, top is thin in its feel to the palate. Finish is mediocre in its acidity, the hops pertinent to the style with an alcohol bitter dry aftertaste, not that great overall."
"2.5 years later, watery."
"Well, put this offering from AB Svyturys into the ""one try only"" category for me. If you see Svyturys Ekstra and get the urge to try it, do yourself a favor and fight the urge. Your nose and palate will thank you."
"A pathetic euro lager. I remember years ago being in Lituania and the beer was much better than this. Poured a shiny yellow, like a glowing urine color. Uch. Thin, one finger head that disipates fast. Smells a bit pathetic. Can malt go sour? Because this smells like sour malt. Short, malty taste. Sweet, bit of citrus and skunky hops. Pretty bland. Mouthfeel is clean and nothing. Drinkable like water, but not drinkable as a beer. The Sambuca Ramasotti I had after this was more satisfying."
"A below average lager. Won't have again."
"An odd aftertaste remains for several minutes."
