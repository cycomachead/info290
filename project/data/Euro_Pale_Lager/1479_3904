Flavor is slightly sweet bready malt, grain, hints of adjuncts and light grassy hops. Ends abruptly, but has a pleasant faint malt aftertaste. Light bodied.

Fairly thin but lively. Drinkable I suppose, but not much enticing here. Just another serviceable lager, and not very Australian based upon my Foster's experience.

The carbonation is quite abundant, the body moderate in weight, and it finishes off-dry and clean.

The aroma is of grain, a bit of european hops, and a little sulfur. It's similar to a euro lager. It's light in body, with a little more hops than similar brews. Fairly dry up front, with just a little sweetness in the mid-taste. It's a nice everyday lager. Nothing out of the ordinary, but a consistently drinkable brew nonetheless.","Suds","Jun 16, 2007"

3.47,12.7,2.5,3,3.5,4,4," Pours a bright golden color, topped by an ephemeral wisp of fizzy white head that disappears almost instantly. Aroma of buttery sweet adjunct malt, a hint of light fruity hops, and just a touch of skunk (courtesy of the green bottle). Palate is light malt with some Euro noble hops, and a light sweetness towards the finish. The body is pleasantly creamy and a tad buttery. I guess the appearance and smell belie an otherwise solid lager. Pretty nice.","ElGordo","May 30, 2007"

Noble as all hell, grassy earthen flavour dominates, and there's a very little bit of apple juice sweetness but nothing cloying in here at all. Malt is just little bit nutty but it dosen't lend much to the overall experience. All in all an extremely refreshing and clean lager with a decent hop profile, which in this style is about all you can ask for. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but not overbearingly so. Extremely dry, which is also very welcoming. This is very, very drinkable to me, and it's finally the time of year when I'm wanting this type of brew. Fresh on-tap in a bar in Tasmania would be extremely pleasant I'd imagine...","trevorwideman","Apr 10, 2007"

Well, actually, they asked us to give reasons why the beer is rated poorly if we, in fact, do. First, the beer leap out of the green bottle with a medium hue and low levels of carbonation. The aromas of cream corn gives my first impression. At second sniff, I also smell skunk aromas (uuummm...breakfast of champions.) The taste is, unfortunately similar to the characteristics found in the nose, though not as strong. The beer is adjuct laden, giving a grain flavor and texture. Little in the complexity department. The flavor does have light apple and pear flavors to go along with its moderate malt flavor; which saves this beer from hosting a really bad rating. The finish is sweet and less than refreshing. Almost scrubbed to the throat. Simply, not a good offtering.","BEERchitect","Feb 01, 2006"

The nose is very sweet and fruity at first, that of ripe melon, accompanied by strong floral hops and a bit of sweet grain. The flavour, in turn, is the converse. Bready malt, some grain husks, and a very crisp dry finish with no real discernable aftertaste. In fact no real finish either, where did those hops go? I can easily tell that this is hot weather beer, brewed in a warm climate for the locals. It lacks in flavour but is very quenching, better than any Caribbean lager I've ever tried. Very dry and quenching mouthfeel, not exactly smooth because the carbonation does lend a bit of a bite. Not an exceptional lager by any means, especially not for the price, but not very flawed either. Just lacking in more flavour, but I get the feeling this was meant to be a quenching beverage for time spent in a hot climate.","IronDjinn","Mar 30, 2005"

It looks good, light gold (Beck's colour), has good head retention, it's very well carbonated (but not too much) and has different flavours in different areas of the mouth, most notably the aforesaid fruity flavours which only occur in the rear corners around the tongue. It's somewhat overpriced but is better than the other readily-available Australian and imported premium lagers: Heineken, Beck's, Nastro Azzurro, and is far better than Cascade and Hahn premium. It's not the best Australian beer, as certain Cooper's and Redback are superior, but it's definitely a reliable beer from a reliable brewery.
