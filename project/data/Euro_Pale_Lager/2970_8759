Did some research and found out that Beer Lao is made from Thai's Jasmine Rice. I'm not sure about this Gluten Free fad, but didn't even realize what was the ingredients.

Keep your expectations low, and you will be happy.  Taste is similar to Asahi or other Asian beer with rice adjunct.  However, one of the villages I stayed in did not have refrigeration, and we drank these beers at 80 degrees in the evening.  I couldn't do that with a Bud or Miller, so I give this beer a little love.  Or maybe it is nostalgia.","captaincoffee","Jan 19, 2015"

3.5,14.8,,,,,,"There was a nice, long lasting head when I poured it into the glass, with plenty of carbonation rising to the top. Many of these type of beers have heads that fade quickly, so I was impressed that it lasted almost as long as it took to drink it. The aroma was slightly sweet, expected from a beer made with rice & malt. I was prepared for the worst when I took my first swig, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. I would equate the taste with Budweiser. For an import from Laos that may have been months old, and could have suffered the consequences of traveling half around the world, this lager was still fresh tasting and enjoyable!","rorjets","Oct 19, 2014"

3,-1.6,3,3,3,3,3,"I decided to just dive right in with my pour and get the party started. I got two-plus foamy fingers of bone-white head and it looked like Fluf atop the beer. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and I knew that I was not going to be winning any points in Greg Koch's eyes by drinking it, but I am not in the business of trying to impress others. Nose had that sweetish lager-like characteristic that I find hard to define, but easy to recognize. I also did not recognize any adjunct smells, so things were definitely looking up. Mouthfeel was medium and I was getting the honey-like sweetness of pure unadulterated lager on my tongue. Winning! Man, I CANnot tell you how many bad AALs I have put up with in pursuit of The CANQuest (TM), but it has been enough to make me appreciate a simple lager, free of adjuncts. Mmmmm. Finish was semi-dry and it begged for a pretzel to go with it and by coincidence, I had a bag of Hammond's Pretzels on-hand for just such an occasion (like any time that I am drinking beer). Don't bother to seek this out, but do be aware that better lagers exist than the BMC AAL type of lager.","woodychandler","Mar 28, 2012"

There is a general consensus among travelers in the region that Beerlao is better than the other, especially Thai, regional beers. While I am agreeing, also note that the competition is extremely weak. As with the others of this ilk, it is best slammed colUd before being allowed to warm. It is common for locals to pour it into a glass with ice to keep it cold, and the thinning isn't all that noticeable since it is pretty thin to start with. Gives you an idea of the beer scene in SE Asia...","sprucetip","Mar 24, 2010"

3.45,13.1,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"The bone white head crests over a finger, finespun enough that the it collapses down to the surface with ease, nice thin traces of lacing, retains a thin layer across the surface. Washed out orange to worn gold in color, transparent but not squeaky clean per se, few bubbles visible within. Bready nose with a honeyed touch, buttered corn, hay, caramel, no real fruit or citrus presence, just a slavish desire to please by maximizing sweetness and minimizing anything which might offend by requiring thought. Medium-bodied, lowgrade fizz for carbonation, no surprise that the palate has the same character as the nose, all poised to please the lowest common denominator and blend into the pack. Corn syrup, maple syrup, caramel, all this makes it stick to your mouth pores. The hay or grass is without edge, has sufficient hops to have good posture, that's it. No problem taking another sip, A step above domestic macrobrews, that is its best attribute.","farrago","Nov 30, 2009"

The taste is more of a light sweetness, some of the basic barley tastes coming through. Mouthfeel is about the same, below average.

It won't leave your skull thumping after a few (like Beer Chang), and it just tastes better than Singha.

3.86,26.6,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Beerlao is best enjoyed in a large, extra cold bottle on the banks of the Mekong River. I was recently in Laos and consumed, on average, 10-15 bottles a day (it's hard not to at $1 for a liter; and that's bar prices!). I bought some in the smaller bottles upon my return to the US from a Thai supermarket and it wasn't as good. May have been a combination of the hot/humid storage conditions and the amount of time the bottles had been sitting on a shelf. Regardless, this is a very refreshing beer that I much prefer to Singha/Tiger/Leo/Chang and other SE Asian beers. Nice crisp taste with no bad aftertaste. Pours a good head and is quite carbonated. Worth a try (if you ever visit Laos, the stuff is 100% unavoidable: only 2 beers served in the whole country)...","Englandmj7","Feb 04, 2008"

The mouthfeel was crisp with light body and low carbonation. The slightly sweet flavor lingered.
