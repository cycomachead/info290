"Poured from a 7oz bottle my mother in law smuggled back from Aruba into a shaker pint, the beer is a pale, crystal clear, almost watery looking straw gold coloring with no head.  Aromas of toasted grains, hints of baked bread, and some buttery highlights. Yikes. Flavors are toasted grains forward, with a fruit sweet undertone that I'm not sure is supposed to be there. Floral notes throughout, too, but otherwise light in flavor, jacking up the drinkability to the levels of water.  Light, crisp bodied, with a toasted grain aftertaste. The finish is smooth and clean. Fairly unremarkable, and fairly innocuous. I can see drinking this in large quantities on a beach in Aruba, devoid of other options."
"always skunky. Better than nothing"

"Still, it was nice to have a cold one on a nice hot day in Aruba. Right about now I would like to be back there."

"Overall: Not a bad beer to have when you're sweating on the beach, but it is nothing to be savored. Would likely lose its appeal in any other setting. Not a bad beer, but I preferred cocktails on my stay in Aruba."

"Currently sitting by the pool and enjoying one fresh. Although yes this may not be a great beer, it is good for what it is. Decent taste, nothing really to note on color or mouthfeel. It is cool to have while in Aruba As I would much prefer it to other American light beers, but this is nothing to seek out."

"Drink it if its free, otherwise avoid it. Bland and generic."
"Honeymoon in Aruba and lets just say craft beer hasn't come into vogue on the scorching desert of an island. Balashi is the Aruba beer and you can find it everywhere. I got the chance to try this on tap, in green 12oz bottles and in brown 7oz bottles, it makes no difference the beer is a pretty crappy macro lager. Smells and tastes like you'd expect light with hints of corn, honey, grains, and some skunk. I often found a mineral taste, but not always. When in Aruba this is certainly your freshest choice, but certainly nothing to get excited about."
"O - Nothing really special, but it's about context, for something light and refreshing,i it's a good option"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Lacks a bit in flavour but a decent enough hot weather beer, refreshing. Thanks Jen!"
"Overall: Had this beer on Aruba during my honeymoon. Therefore, rated higher on the scale than it deserved as location, location, location and place it was consumed will evermore be linked. Wish I could get this in Albany, NY! Sigh. Recommended!"
"When visiting Aruba, drink the local beer, just like other places I visit. Color is a deep yellow with a almost two finger head and broken and moderately clinging lace. Very clear with lots of micro bubble action. Smell is crisp with scents of roasted wheat, corn, and malt. Taste is clean with a little bite. Flavors of wheat, roasted corn, sage, black pepper, sweet malt, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel was moderately creamy, and tingly, with a wonderful after taste that was present when I exhaled. Not a bad choice when visiting Aruba. Better on tap than from a bottle."
"I had Balashi via cans and draft while in Aruba on our honeymoon. I did not drink anything else there but Balashi. This is a very underrated beer. The beer is made by Aruban water - so fresh and crisp! The beer has a deep golden color totally clear and transparent, with a bitterness which is soft to the tongue and nose however with an aroma of fresh hops, a short aftertaste and easy on foam. The combination of all feels fresh and smooth to the mouth when cold, perfect for Aruba's hot climate. I brought a beer back with me to the states to give to a friend who went to Aruba years ago and he shut his eyes and sighed, ""That's the Balashi I missed in Aruba"". This beer temporarily takes drinkers back to paradise. You have to be in Aruba (or there before) in order to fully appreciate this lager."
"Last thought: 11.27 Fl Oz = 333.3 mL in a CAN! New England Brewing needs to put Neighbor of the Beast in a 22.54 Fl Oz CAN (chew on that one)."
"An average exotic adjunct lager."
"Overall Impression: Well, at least I crossed Aruba off the list."
"D: Goes down very easy, not much kick, not filling at all. I believe this beer is misclassfified as it is more in line with a pilsner than a macro. This beer is one that you can throw back all day long and works with the heat of an Aruban day."
"One should note that I gav a quick google search to see if I can buy it in the US. Apparently not, but I can see from several chat rooms, that I'm not the only one looking for this suds, stateside."
"F: Somewhat crisp lager flavors, with a slight lingering toasty malt, but mostly the syrupy adjunct flavors linger on the finish. It leaves a touch of wheat as well. It finishes pretty quick too, almost like water, but leaves that macro adjunct syrupy flavor too long."
"Much better than any macro, a perfect summer time beer. Wish it was available up here for sure"
"Feel/Drink: Mouth and drinkablity are both good. Nice carbonation but not too crazy like most AALs (I did it again!)"
"Overall, Aruba did an okay job."
"Then again when one is in Aruba, if the only thing you have to complain about is the fact that there is no great beer, than you should probably just go with the flow and keep your pie hole shut."
"A can brought to me straight from aruba. Pours a yellow orange color into a pint glass with a small white head that dissipates quickly leaving average lacing, nothing exemplary. Smells of corn and sugar with an herbal tea like background. Tastes like corn seltzer with green or white tea steeped in it mixed half and half with bitter apple juice. Mouthfeel is surprisingly nice, well carbonated. This is the beers' only redeeming quality. Drinkable-ish. Its light but i cant imagine having more than 3."
"D- Highly drinkable, it is good on a hot day, but there are better pilsners out there"
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin. In Aruba, drinkability is ok. Here, with 60 other beers stashed around the house, it is no big deal."
"Balashi is a beer that is best drank within it's environment just like Red Stripe is. Reminds me of a less skunky Heineken. The pickin' is slim in Aruba so this is my top beer choice. Both the can & bottle were equal in taste and they say 5% ABV."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer, despite the pretty sour taste. The smooth and refreshing feel of the beer overcame the biting taste to make it somewhat enjoyable while I sat in the hot, Aruban sun."
"i had fun with this beer.. average yellow color.. nice carbination.. taste was smooth and crisp..it was kind of intesting it was 11oz can but it seemed to be just enough.. no realy hops or malts jumped out just an average tasting pils.. but it was a little sweet cheers"
"Bon bini!"
"Pretty aggressive carbonation pricks the tongue which overwhelms the very light body. Makes it extra hard to drink."
"Notes from 09/26/08."
"My go to beer in Aruba. Pours a clear golden yellow with a white head. Aroma is slightly hoppy. Taste was fairly clean, with a little more bite than the other yellow beers that Aruba had to offer (Polar, Bud, etc). Drinks very easily, especially when ice cold. Probably not a choice I'd pick up here in the US, but after snorkeling at Baby Beach this seemed like the perfect beer to quench my thirst."
"I greatly enjoyed this beer. Pretty much stuck with it for my entire vacation. This beer isn't perfect, but hard to beat when it's 90+ degrees and there is sand between your toes. And it's better than most of what is readily available when in Aruba. I prefer this on on-tap."
"I could not tell any difference from the tap version. Nice beach beer."
"Its an improvement over your bud, and millers etc. Though I think its optimally drank, while relaxing poolside/on the beach versus with your dinner back home."
"Finally, I rated drinkability as exceptional because, despite its mild flavor, that flavor holds up glass after glass. You could--I have--drink glass after glass of Balashi and each one would be as refreshing and satisfying as the first. It does not overpower food--it has just enough flavor to be consistently interesting."
"T: Thin body, with heavy carbonation actually creates pleasant mouthfeel. Taste isn't....bad. Light malt body with a slight hop finish. Tastes like a watered down pilsner, nothing interesting, but not bad. Very refreshing and clean taste, nice on a hot day."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Clear pale yellow color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Grassy nose. Flavor is muted grassy and lacking. Clean but wicked dry finish. Gift from a traveler 220ml bottle from Aruba."
"D: Sweet, buttery and an easy drinking beer perfect for the Beaches of Aruba. good beer in regards to its environment."
"D- I could definatley knock a few of these back on a hot island day. I will seek this out if ever in Aruba. Not bad. A better alternative than the BMC crew."
"D- Well, when Aruba I drank a ton of these. If I ever go back I'll do it again. Not a terrible brew. Easy to drink and on a hot Aruba day I'd put a few more away again."
"Overall, a drinkable beer that went pretty good with my spicy spinach curry. More hops and a bit juicier malt backbone would've been welcome."
"Light-bodied and quite fizzy. Maybe in the heat of the tropics it is a thirst-quencher, but that's about it."
"(of note, I did prefer the bottle over the canned)"
"A very transparent golden color with a pretty big head that calms down to near nothing within a few minutes. No lacing evident. It smells of musty grains and grass and perhaps a hint of the can, as well. Not overly attractive but passable. At first the cold brew had a vague citrus/wheat taste and a slight bitterness at the back. But as it warmed a few degrees it seemed to improve, taking on a slightly maltier flavor. Certainly refreshing and pretty drinkable but it leaves that dryness at the back of your mouth that isn't very consistent with what you want for refreshment. It is nicely carbonated to help the quenching process but overall this is ordinary faire."
"Pours a pale yellow color, with a white head. In the nose was a European/ saaz hopand small amount of earthiness. Tastes dry for a lager and a small presence of hops. A very clean, smooth beer. Not much in aftertaste, yet very refreshing. Close similarities to an American macro lager, but a little different with the earthiness."
"From what I can recall, ABV was 5.0%, maybe 5.5"
"I rated drinkability higher only because these went down very easily in the hot Aruba sun and was actually refreshing."
"Overall: This one is great when you are sitting under some shade enjoying the cool breezes off the water. An earlier reviewer is way off topic in respect to the water, especially since their state-of-the-art de-salination plant is prevalent from most of the non-touristy areas."
"The bars in Aruba only seem to carry this and the usual macro brews, so you may as well give Balashi a try. Especially since it is very unlikely you will come across Balashi anywhere else."
"Even if they still don't do tours, I think they have Friday night events at the brewery, so check it out when you are lucky enough to get down there. Don't be fooled by the Natalie Holloway news, Arbua is a safe island and the locals are friendly."
"On a side note, not really related to the scoring...many of the locals in Aruba drink a venezuelan ""import""...not balashi. I do give credit for this small island brewing their own and marketing it."
"Filtered down watery american-pilsener style lager, tastes just like Budweiser (which I believe has a share in the brewery, go figure) not that much of a head, not many hops to speak of, smooth enough, other than that its from Aruba this is fairly normal. Fairly boring too."
"I had this beer on a recent trip to Aruba. Light bodied beer. This is a light Pilsner beer modeled after the Dutch Pilsners, due to the obvious Dutch influence in the area. Very refreshing beer with little after taste. Perfect for a day at the beach. I was very impressed."
"PS-when you ask for it, ask for ""Belushi"" with a U. Wait till you see the expression you get."
"Thanks to Mom & Dad for bringing this back from Aruba for me. Pours a crystal clearmedium straw color with a good head, but not so good lace. The head also faded rather quickly. I didn't even have to get my nose close to the glass to smell the skunk. If you can get through it there are some average pilsner sweet malt aromas. Taste of an average macro, but I'll bet it tastes great on the beach in Aruba. A typical macro pilsner. A brown bottle would make this better - keep out more light. Easy going down thus high drinkability. Not a bad beer, will do in a pinch. Except for the skunkiness, its average."
" 94 K people packed on a tiny island. Add who knows how many drunken tourists.Turn up the heat. Now let nature kick in with everyone shitting and pissing. Where do you think all that festering sewage is going to go? Nowhere! Fortunately the Arubans came up with a plan. It involved little green and silver 22cl cans."
"When I go back, I will probably hit some of the grocery stores and see if I can score some Guinness Draught or Foreign Stout as I uncovered that on the last days of our trip!"
"Maybe it just got skunked. Maybe I got a bad one. However, since I have no other 'fresh' ones to compare it to, I would suggest you only drink it if you like licking postage stamps and gnawing on cardboard."
"Cheers"
"Golden in color and completely transparent with minimal head.  Hop presence on the nose, with a soft yet forward bitter hoppy flavor and a sufficient dryness.  Nothing particularly outstanding in the flavor.  Carbonation is moderate with a very brief finish.  Best to not let this one get warm."
