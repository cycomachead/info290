"Beatiful bottle, taste like mahou or even worse xD"
"underrated, this has all the traits of a baltic region lager, super cold fermented feeling, patient beer, fuller bodied, well carbonated, and drinkable forever. maybe some reviewers have had dated bottles, but when fresh, this is really nice, not a trace of off flavors for a pale lager type, and pretty clean finishing despite all the body. fun beer, awesome bottle obviously, aside from the fact it only hold 10 or so ounces of beer, feeling a little cheated there, but the beer tastes fresh to me, cleanses the palate but still has flavor, and i think its my first beer from the land of estonia, so thats always fun. not sure i would buy it again, but in a restaurant context of macro brews, its a fun bottle to drink. definitely a league above most of its peers."

"General: Una cerveza ligera y muy sencilla de tomar."
"Pours a light golden color with a thin lace of head. Not much aroma in this but is slightly sweet. Goes down smooth with moderate carbonation. Taste is slightly bitter and sweet with hints of carmel malts. Not sure what to think overall. At first it tasted good, but the sips i take the more it tastes like an adjunct lager, so i'm torn."

"O: Basic Euro lager. A ""premium"" Estonian beer. Thank goodness it's premium, cause I don't what to try anything otherwise."

"Bleh - a decidedly subpar lager. Looks pretty average, while the aroma and flavour are faint and beset with off-notes that detract from the experience. Lacklustre body. No great shakes; bland and unsatisfying. Do yourself a favour and give it a miss."

"Overall: There is an overwhelming egg aroma and taste that ruins this brew."

"I stumbled upon this Lithuanian beer at Roosevelt at 7, McAllen, Texas. One should note that the water in this beer is from one of the deepest wells in all of Europe. It pours crystal clear yellow, little head, and average carbonation. It tastes like well water, with hints of malt, corn, honey, and a sweetness, it has a metallic aftertaste, and is not filling. It comes in a unique bottle...."
"It is a refreshing drink, but with a little more intense than expected bitterness. Besides the wonderful bottle design, the content is poor. I think it is better to take it very cold, to not notice the flaws. The taste reminds me a lot of Corona or Budweiser. Nothing special."
""
"A novelty sort of thing is all this is. The bottle's neat, but the beer may honestly be worse than Bud Light in my opinion. Bud Light somehow has more flavor. This seriously might be the first time an adjunct lager sort of beer has actually let me down. I wish I waited a couple days to review this beer for April Fool's Day, because this beer is a joke."

"The taste is light, sweet and watery. No real bitterness present. Not even in the finish. Too bad. Still drinkable, but no real taste to it."
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light straw yellow with a thin film of white foam with decent retention. Typical adjunct aroma of sweet malt, grain and faint hops. Flavor is light biscuit malt with a slightly harsh grain, grassy hops, faint apple juice. Light bodied with active carbonation. A decent pale lager, with a little more flavor and hops than most adjunct ales, but also a little less smooth and sweet. A satisfactory light lager for drinking with lunch but fairly average. Cool bottle."

"Pours to a thin white head and moderate lacing. Color is pale gold. Aroma is grainy, bready and slightly sour with a very faint hint of spicy noble hops. Flavor is typical for the style, clean, crisp, grainy, balanced with noble hops and light. Dry finish. Light mouthfeel with CO2 appropriate for the style. Overall, this is a good beer for the style, not too weird or offensive but not very remarkable either. I don't know why it is getting such bad reviews, it is not bad at all."

"The mouthfeel is light bodied. It slides over the tongue easily enough."
"Viru ---2/5."

"Cheap tasting pale lager that is exactly what I had expected going in. The beer is inoffensive and fairly easy to drink although there is touches of grain and some skunk that are slightly off-putting."
"When taking the price into account, I'd rather just have a Kokanee than this."

"O- This is an easy drinking, reasonably smooth beer to drink, but it just doesn't deliver overall...it is still a cheap Euro lager, that while it does have a richer malt profile, it is still full of adjunct blah-ness. I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy this one again, but won't go so far as to say that is shouldn't be tried by anybody...just not the beer that the good people at Viru say it is, that's all!"

"A perfect lady beer, for a beer garden - for ladies, who don't really like beer. It is inoffensive throughout - but also just fail to impress on any level."
"Easy to drinik and thirst quenching, though uninteresting. There is nothing offensive here and it did add to an enjoyable afternoon with friends."
"O- Not an impressive beer, but i'm finally tasting an industrial pale lager that feels natural. Highly drinkable and refreshing, it brings exactly what you would expect from the style"

"Tried this one in Naples, Italy.. Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma is malty, cardboard with some grain. Taste is also sweet malty with some grain leading to an ultra lightly bitter but dry finish from the saaz? hops. Pretty ordinary and inoffensive but a GREAT OCTAHEDRAL BOTTLE!!"
"O - Overall, this is quite the subpar beer. I would rather drink an american macro than another one of these."
""
"This isn't a bad beer...Very very gulpable lager."
"cool bottle but that's about it, I doubt I'd bother with this one again"
"Overall, this is a better-than-average offering, and pretty good if it actually is an Adjunct lager."
"O: This is just another bland Euro lager that just happens to come in a cool-looking bottle."
"EDIT: This one actually improved when served at what I would consider too warm for the style. As such, I've edited my ratings a bit."
"My Beer Rating: 1.5"
"O â€“ Estonia checkmark is the sole reason to visit this beer, very light and drinkable but unenjoyable for me and I will not be buying or drinking this again when my 4 pack is gone. 2.5"
"Overall- What a disaster! About 4 ounces was more than enough."
"Yep, pretty appalling brew, this one. Very artificial tasting, thin, weak and unpleasant."
"Overall: Not a good first impression from Estonia. I was expecting more from this country."
"O: This was one of the strangest beers I've ever had. And not a very good one."
"Overall let it warm up and it blooms, I loved it!"
"10 ounce bottle, date on bottle cap of 07.10.10. The bottle was stored in the cooler at the Party Source, but I'm pretty sure it's nowhere close to being fresh at this point. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a half inch white head. The head went away quickly, and there isn't much lacing, either. Aroma is sweet and bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a weird bitter taste that I don't care for. Mouthfeel/body is light, and it's a bit slick. It's also smooth and goes down easy. For the style it's not a bad brew. Worth a try if you can get a single bottle of it like I did. I might have to try a fresher bottle of this in the future."
"Like many I picked this up due to it's bottle. In Louisiana it completely stands out and I just had to have it. It poured light gold very highly carbonated and had a strong hissing with lots of bubbles. The head dissipated fairly quickly. The first sip is by far the best for this beer. At first on the front it's very malty and tasty. After that it flattens out considerably and becomes very average. I wouldn't buy it again at the price but the bottle still is cool."
"Overall / Drinkability: First of all, I don't think this is an adjunct lager. It has aspects of one, but it's very different and the website for the brewer doesn't claim to have adjuncts present. So maybe this is a Euro pale lager? Anyway, it's pretty good overall. Very drinkable - I could easily have another one or two of these, especially with the smaller bottle size. I originally picked it up just for the weird bottle but now that I've had it - I'm very glad I did have it and I'll have to get it again. A bit pricy since it's coming all the way from Estonia, but not a bad beer at all. I was expecting worse due to the reviews, but no, it's not that bad at all and is a very drinkable beer."
"Frosty golden liquid with a finger of head that goes right away. Smells very bready, also some banana, corn and very faint citrus. Tastes like crisp vegetables with sweet fruit. For an adjunct lager this stuff is really, really good. I'd drink it all the time if I lived in Estonia."
"I originally bought this because it had an awesome bottle and it was fairly cheap. But after cracking it open I found it to be a surprisingly pleasant experience. I wouldn't rush back for more, but I would definitely come back at some point. Good summer day beer."
"Fans of bohemian pilsners and German Maibocks may want to give this beer a shot- robust for a lager and surprisingly flavorful and textured for any beer that includes adjunct grains."
"D-this is probably one of the best adjunct lagers i've had to be honest. it goes down so easily. i honestly feel that BMC drinkers would prefer this to...well...BMC. my glass disappeared quickly."
"Close to two finger head of bone white and delicate microfoam, hard to even see the contour of most of the bubbles, retention is slight at best, simmers down swiftly, lacing fares about the same, some immediate stick then gone. Clear golden straw color to the liquid, pale yet attractive, only sparse bubbles visible, not much difference towards the rims. Noticeably sweet nose of corn syrup, honey, cane sugar and potato bread, waft of orange citrus, rice and mixed grain, no real herbaceous character, highly innocuous. Medium-bodied, good solid bottom keeps it anchored in the palate, remains on the sweet side here too with that corn and other adjuncts, honey and caramel, the orange citrus pulp and sweet, notes of standard peach and apricot fruit. Moderate hay, meadow grasses, once more avoids any really herbal bite or overall bitterness. The carbonation is light but tight enough to help it finish with elevating dryness. Nothing really noteworthy, does have high drinkability and general smoothness."

"Overall, really mediocre but it is refreshing. The bottle alone is a reason to get this, but it is like any other adjunct lager."
"D- With this beer not being full of off flavors like a lot of adjunct lagers it makes it very drinkable. Refreshing? Well that might be pushing it. Although I really did like this beer for what it was I wouldn't drink a sixer although if it were hot outside I think I might."
"They did go all out with a cool bottle."
"All in all, as far as Amer. Adj. Lagers go, this one is really not all that bad. seems a bit cleaner than many. Not a beer I'd really crave, and it's not exactly cheap... but it's certainly not the worst. And by far the best Estonian brew I've had."
"D: Perfectly inoffensive and easy to down. There's nothing here that makes this beer stand out from the crowd, which might be the point."
"As neat as the bottles is, the beer runs in entirely the opposite direction. Bland, inoffensive, I suppose, and just not worth the novelty."
"D - It's fairly refreshing, although some hop bitterness would make it an easy summer thirst quencher. Not offensive, just not real good. Really just bought it for the kickass bottle, which the girlfriend wants to use as a vase. At two bucks, the beer (that rare Estonia tick) seemed like a bonus."
"What it is missing in complex nuances, it makes up for it by being really refreshing. Still, a no-frills lager."
"300 ml. bottle. Very clean and pale yellow colour, with a head that doesn't hold.The only remarkabler thing about the smell is that it makes you think it has more alcohol than it has, besides that, just grain and hops. Light body, I think I find some apple in mouth, but nothing more. Normal dull beer, but it comes in a nice bottle."
" D- The aroma was stronger than the taste but there is realy nothing to either of them good or bad. It was a bit like drinking carbonated water."
"D: Well, it's refreshing because it's very watery but it does not worth the price paid in Switzerland since you can have a Budvar of Urquell by the same price in the same supermarket"
"Overall: Decent pilsner. Fairly balanced. It is very light and loses flavor toward the end of the bottle. At least it comes in an interesting bottle."
"Tasted from 10oz bottle purchased at Binny's Hyde Park. Pours pale yellow with a fizzy and short-lived head. Nose is pale malt with a just a hint of hops, banana and yeast. The nose is rather subdued. The flavors are even more subdued with just a little bit of malt and hops. The body is light and watery with very little carbonation. This is not a very good beer."
"If it wasn't for the distinctive tall octahedral bottle, Viru probably wouldn't have found its way into my cart. If that's what it takes to sell more beer, more power to the brewery. Bottom line: too bad the contents of the bottle don't match the distinctiveness of the bottle itself."
"Decent summer quenched and the shape of the bottle might draw you in."
"D - Easy to drink just like the style suggests but would be easier to drink if it tasted better."
"D: Here is the shining positive aspect of this beer. HIGHLY drinkable as a liquid, but not especially tasty. If for some reason I decided to drink a large volume of tame beer I would choose this over any of the American light lagers, if only because it would look decidedly badass to have ten or fifteen of these weird bottles laying around my apartment the next day when I woke up."
"D: Cool bottle, but the bottle is better than the beer. This is your basic american lager, but without the distinct flavor that many others can achieve."
"Crisp and refreshing... low on flavor... thin but balanced... a little sweet... medium malts... like every single other blah eurolager. The bottle is still strong."
"I admit it, I picked this beer up because of the unique bottle. That being said, it pours a clear jaundice topped by a cute finger of bright white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, light corn syrup, and miscellaneous vegetable matter (kinda like sniffing a used in-sink disposal after cleaning a salad bowl). The taste does away with the veggies (thankfully), leaving some watered-down corn syrup, wheat, rice, and a slightly metallic wannabe-bitterness. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. I've had many better from this particular Baltic state. Nice bottle, though."
"This one really isn't undrinkable, and it went pretty well with the pasta salad and spinach cake I was eating on a hot afternoon."
"I was searching for Carolina beers at Chip's Wine and Beer in Kill Devil Hills, NC and found this. I figured I'd never has Estonian beer and gave it a shot. It's basically just another clean continental lager. The aroma has very mild vegetable off-notes, but otherwise it's a simple and refreshing beer. It's no big surprise, but Estonians can make a macro lager as well as any one else."
"Notes: Pretty much a typical mass produced, easy to drink, low on flavor kind of beer just in a neat looking bottle and from Estonia. Had a slightly off and metallic taste that wasn't necessarily good or bad, just different. Not really worth seeking out, unless you want to try a beer from Estonia or want the bottle."
"This is pretty bad, not worth looking at, buying, or drinking. Try again Estonia."
"Pours a clear golden color with a white, soda-like head that dissipated really quickly. The nose is mostly absent, but there is a faint grainy, buttery character way back there somewhere. There's not much in the way of flavor--that's probably the point--but there is a subtle hint of hay-like malt in the center, just past the subtle hint of sweetness at the front. It doesn't have much body; it drinks like water. Surprisingly, this comes in a 10oz bottle; one could drink gallons of this without any trouble! Drinkable? Heck yeah! Interesting? Heck no!"
"Overall a forgettable beer for bottle collectors."
"There are good Baltic lagers, but this isn't one. Rather than make a bad beer, they seem to have decided to make a completely insubstantial one. More drinkable, I guess, but why would you?"
"The best thing about this beer by far, is the bottle. There isn't anything really ""bad"" about the beer, unless, by bad you'd mean without any character. There are no foul characteristics, but there's not much flavor, aroma, or palate. The head is white and almost disappears quickly with no head. Color is a clear yellow. Aroma is faint world beer. Flavor is the same. Body isn't totally gone, but there isn't much. Hardly any finish. Forgettable except for the cool bottle."
"Strange bottle, looks like something my grandmother would keep oil or flowers in, first beer ive had from estonia. Pours a very light pale yellow with very little head that is gone quickly. Smells like any other commercial light beer, very light grains.Nothing special about the flavor of this one, typical for this style, not much here. Very light body with no residual flavors to be talked about. Could pound these all day by the pool and get extremely bloated and unsatisfied."
"The bottle sure is cool, though."
"Overall both the mouthfeel and flavor are quite flat. A touch of bitterness on the finish, but not a lot going on here in terms of flavor."
"After seeing this beer in the local supermarket, I bought it solely for the unique eight-sided slender bottle. The beer itself is a clear golden color. Initially, it presents a bright fizzy head, but this is extremely short-lived, and the beer quickly retreats to flatness. The aroma is of a little malt and distant grains. Not much to impress. The taste is similar, with a sharp carbonic bite and a little metallic tin-ness. Light and uninteresting. The bottle is neat, but the beer inside is completely forgettable."
"bought this because of the beauty of the distinctive octahedral bottle ... and to be honest, the bottle is about the only thing impressive about this brew ... smells like a dried out toast bread, actually not far from the flavors which develop on the tongue ... the mouthfeel is unpleasant and comes with a metallic and adstringent aftertaste ... again, the bottle is a classic ...."
"At least, a quite beautiful bottle."
"Not a beer I'll be having again. Only bought it because of the bottle shape. Conned again, I'll never learn!"
"Other comments: Interesting bottle, bad name, boring beer."
