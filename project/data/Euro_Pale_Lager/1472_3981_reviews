"had a hite over the weekend pretty good! @irnva"
"Hite does not excite me. After my can, I switched my alcohol option on the plane to red wine."

"only if you wanna get drunk and want carbonation. People usually mix this with soju which is Korean distilled beverage"

"it is an extremely easy tasting drink: sweet, clear and crisp. Its smoothness making it go down very well. There was a lingering grain sweetness throughout in the beer that stays nice till the end, no bitterness found in this beer. It tasted of a little rice and pale malt, some grains and a light hop flavour. Very refreshing and clean throughout, I enjoyed this beer.  This beer is pleasant. and perfect for the light beer drinker.  Definitely a top class session beer, perfect for a night out with friends to a restaurant, say perhaps a Korean restaurant! Would work very well with some light food."

"Pairs well with karaoke, and that's really about it."

"O - I've been wanting to try this for a long time since I am a fan of the LPGA and see several golfers with Hite logos on their equipment and clothing. If I was at a golf tournament in South Korea I could see putting a few of these away. Until then, I've had it and don't see the need to pay a premium for it in the states."

"Nice for a refreshment, but not much to the taste."
""
""

"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a pure white foamy head with light retention and not much lacing. Aroma of light adjunct notes with some cereal notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by light cereal notes with some adjunct and light sweet finish. Finish is actually crisper and cleaner then I had expected. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. This is actually better than I was expecting but still not great though."
""
"Adjunct lager a bit above average, hops are mild but they can be sensed and adjuncts are on the low side and probably rice rather than corn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was looking forward to this after not seeing any adjuncts listed in the ingredients.I was let down when I experienced just another bland, mass-produced Asian lager. The can states: ""Clean & Pure!"" as well as ""Freezing Point Filtration System."" It is surely clean and pure, but they seem to have filtered out the beer flavor."

"It's notable the that ""cold meter"" on the bottle label has apparently reached Korea, and my bottle indicated that it was the appropriate time to drink. Unfortunately there were no cups available to see the beer to evaluate it properly. But it was obviously the golden/pale lager color. Smell was dull at best, and taste followed suit. Hite gives you the effervescent sensation as any other mass produced lager. Would I drink it again? Not a chance. The only uniqueness to this beer is that it's the only Korean beer I've ever had."
""
""
"O: This is a poor product with a big adjunct-vibe to it. If that's what you're into, this could be gold, otherwise - avoid!"
""
""
"Honestly, this was one of the worst beers I've consumed. When I think about my least favorite beers, this ranks better than only Corona and perhaps Bud Select."

"Sometimes I think that asian beer isb underrated and then I'm like hey man fuck that hites ggood beer beer beer I enjoy beer but especially watered down hite gice it a chance yiull love it and if you don't FUCK YOU. Come onnn man oh man they want youb to get pretentious as shit on these reviews butt when it comes down to. It yum is yum- ehhh"
"I think this would be great with spicy asian food, to rinse your mouth a bit, but it doesn't stand so good alone. Maybe on a hot summer day, but then, with so much carbonation.."
""
""
""
"O:I like drinking this beer. I was able to get a large bottle for $1.59. I prefer beer that is economical and mellow."
""
"One bottle is enough"
""
"hite beer - works well with the garlicky, spicy cuisine of its country of origin, but less satisfying on its own. pale golden color with a foamy, soapy head that diminishes within a minute. hints of dishsoap along with cooked cereal grains on the nose. mildly bitter in the way foreign lagers tend to be, but not in a big hoppy sense. i taste sweetness for a second up front, followed by a bit of sourness as the beer slides back. perhaps more texture than your big three domestics, and more than i would have guessed for a 4.5% brew. when the bottles are super-chilled and the weather is scorching, i find hite a refreshing beer (kind of like high life in that regard). as the beer rises in temperature it loses that appeal."
"Another bog-standard macro lager. It's relatively clean tasting and refreshing, but bland and dull. Wish they didn't mention Yakima hops on the label, it gets your hopes up that there might be some hoppy aroma. Couldn't really recommend unless there was nothing else available."
"Out of glass, feel is creamy, with carbonation. Flavor is not too noticeable out of a glass, but I'll go so far as to say this beer is pleasant."
"The taste seemed to bring out a slightly more grainy character but I was not put off by it in anyway. I thought it went very well with the barbecue beef I ate."
""
""
"O - Horrible beer. The only reason it scored this high with me is because I don't really like giving 1s unless the beer makes me puke. Not worth the buck I paid for the single 12oz bottle. Steer clear from this on people."
""
""
"Overall - While the beer has a nice crisp flavour that leaves is very refreshing; it is in no way anything to write home about. It would work well to tone down a spicy meal or to beat the heat on a summer day. I'd like a lot less carbonation though. I wouldn't pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
"Yes it goes OK with the food, but it really isn't good beer, and I am not sure re Euro Pale Lager given adjunct flavours."
""
"This euro lager is much like many commercial american style light beers. It is very pale. I would say it is right for many light beer fans but not for me. I did notice that it is highly carbonated. Unlike other reviews the head lasted a few minutes and then dissipated as described. In my opinion it is overcarbonated."
"O: This beer goes down rather easy and makes a nice accompaniment to the spiciness of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken)."
""
"The body was very thin and watery, even for the style. Drinkability was on the ""why bother"" side of the scale, there are better examples of the style out there. Overall, not a good beer, try it to tick it, otherwise avoid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable, but nothing I'd seek out. The best part about this beer is its value - just $1.99 for a nearly wine sized bottle."

"Onward! A Crack followed by a no-holds-barred Glug produced a massive two-plus fingers of fizzing, foamy bone-white head with very limited retention. Hey, if I'd have known you were going to leave so quickly, I would not have bothered showering! Ya hear me, ya jagov?!? Bye! On an up note, the color was a deep-golden yellow to make Midas and Croesus proud, coupled with NE-quality clarity enabling me to read the postcard offering me a a complimentary entree for my birthday. I will be headed to PHL tomorrow to the University City Mad Mex to take them up on their offer. Once again, I digress ... Nose had the sweetish smell of pure unadulterated lager, no adjuncts, and my mouth began to water. I swear, there are more CANned AALs than I would have ever imagined. Mouthfeel was a tad thin and it tasted like lager with Noble hops, slightly tangy, mellow in a grassy way. Yum! Finish was semi-dry and definitely refreshing, so kudos for them for truth in advertising. It really is not a bad beer and I would probably fill a cooler with it for a day at the beach. YMMV."
"Overall Impression- I would definitely come back to this brew! Very refreshing and had a nice banana character mid-drink that I found. Would enjoy this before most BMC products and awesome we can get something from South Korea! Thanks for carrying this Friar Tuck!"
"Had a sushi restaurant because they were out of Hitichino. Too bad for me."
""
"I've seen this beer in an odd larger format 1.6L plastic bottle also, called the ""pitcher"" size. The empty bottle may or may not have been thrown at a Wyomingan."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: It starts out tasting like an American macro brew but the taste goes away really fast and then tastes very watered down."
"O: A large production rice based lager. Nothing special here..."
""
""
"Pours a wan straw yellow - not inspiring - with a white head that doesn't stick around for long. OK, maybe it gets better. Aroma is typical of a pale lager, malty with a fruity hint. Flavor is typical, crisp and malty and just a little fruity - nothing special, but OK. Texture has average body and a fair amount of fizziness. Mediocre, but give it a fair shake."
"I probably should have given Hite lower marks, as it really is not a good beer, but I associate many fond memories with this brew so that is undoubtedly influencing my opinion."
"D: No matter what the occasion, I would choose almost any other beer in the world over this one."
"I purchased this at Lotte/ Assi Plaza in Atlanta; $4.99 for a six pack. 4.5% ABV."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch bubbly white head that fades to a few bubbles on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of grains, rice, and cooked veggies. There is also a sulfur smell that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is of grains, bubble gum, and vegetable broth. For such a bubbly head the carbonation level is on the low side with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. This is a pretty bad beer. Their motto is ""cool & fresh"" which I would have to disagree with on both claims."
"Tempted to class Hite as sparkling alcoholic yellowish water, though I can say I never got a hangover from it. Points awarded on that basis. If you ever find yourself in SK, feel no qualms about drinking 20, so long as you had a friend phonetically spell out what to tell a taxi driver to get where you're staying and you're confident you can do it in deep."
"Re-review 16-01-2013 (I edited the review were neccesary. Still pretty much the same. Less tasteless as I remembered.)"
"O: This might be an OK ""lawn mower"" beer for some; if you are really thirsty and drink it fast and colder. I am trying very hard to review this keeping the style in mind and thinking of other beers that I have drank in this same category. I have to admit I do like my beers on the more aggressive side."
"Overall, not a bad beer for what it is. Nothing aggressive or offensive. Decent sessionable beer."
"Overall, drinks much more like a Cream Ale than a Euro Pale Lager. On that card, it acquits itself nicely. Grab a few bombers and bring them to a card night."
"To give his beer credit, it is refreshing and has no offensive qualities. It doesn't have any strong qualities either and is border-line light beer. I'd recommend drinking this with spicy Asian food."
"A drinkable beer that is pretty weak and watered down, it reminds me of cheap lager that is usually served at Chinese or Indian restaurants across the UK. Not bad but certainly not good either."
"Overall: Forgettable. Not enough flavor to be interesting, no major problems though. Could be a good companion to Asian dishes."
"YUCK, DON'T BOTHER!"
"The reaction: well, I now I don’t want to post this. It’s made in Korea. Has a BA rating of D+ It has an ‘indicator’ for when it’s cold enough...I’m at a loss for words...Fuck it, I’m drinking this with pride. I have two friends that live in Korea to teach English, and I’m cheersing to them. To the crowd, you’re welcome to tell me I’m obviously a noob at tasting."
"330 ml bottle, with 11112010 printed on the label. Not sure if that's the bottled or best by date. Also, the ""open mark"" on the label turns blue at it's optimal tasting temperature. The open mark is still blue, so it must be a good time to drink this! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear pale gold color with about an inch white head that went away quickly. Pretty much no lacing. Aroma is sweet and bready malt. Taste is sweet malt and corn. It doesn't taste or smell bad, but it's not appealing either. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. For the style it's not a bad overall brew. It's worth trying if you can find a single bottle of it somewhere."
"Oddly reminiscent of Heineken..."
"My first attempt at this beer was skunked. Luckily, I gave it a second try and hopefully this was a genuine impression of what the beer was supposed to be. To be honest, it wasn't much better. It smelled sweet, but it didn't really smell like anything. It had a starchy character with very little flavour. The only note I could discern was that of figs, which made it difficult to enjoy after half of a glass. It was far too sweet for a beer that is supposed to be refreshing and easy to drink in quantity. I've had sweeter beers, but with no other discernible flavour, this beer was cloyingly sweet. And that fig flavour just built up as I drank. At the time, the only alternative was Budweiser, so I continued to drink the Hite, figuring it was probably the lesser of the two evils, but not by much. Too much sugar in this beer."
"Overall - I'll try pairing this with some asian food. Does not go well as a session beer. Reminds me of an astringent Miller High Life."
"D: Decent, but forgettable. Nice and clean, with lightly sweet malt flavors, but overall something I probably wouldn't buy it again. Still better than a lot of the other brews available in this style."
"Conclusion: I don't know what all the hate is for on this site for this beer, I mean a D+ average? This isn't trying to be an Imperial Pilsner. The label says cool and fresh, which when served chilled this beer is. Some Euro pale lagers are certainly not fresh tasting, but this is closer. I would drink this as an alternative to Heineken any day..."
"D - Main virtue is it pairs well with korean food, however prefer OB in that respect. Not a beer one should ever seek out."
"I had to try some just because I was there. Really bad though. I was not expecting much, but US macros are much better than this no matter what kind of beers you like. All I can say is that this was another tick."
"Clear, pale yellow with a skim of white foam that instantly shrinks to nothing. Green apple skin, corn and cereal grains with some dusky, herbal hop notes in the aroma. Light and grainy with a distinct cheap, adjunct beer quality. Sweet and corny with a touch of washed out hop bittering. Light and highly carbonated. Why is this beer exported..it really isn't worthy, I've had American malt liquors that blow this crap import away. No thanks."
"American marketers have made big-sellers out of crap beer like Heineken and Corona. Let's see them pitch this to the masses."
"D: Had with a Korean meal. It makes OB & Cass look pretty good."
"D - If you are in Korea and don't feel like spending too much money to get your drink on then I recommend this beer. If not, stay away."
"D - I tried this so I could say I've had a beer from South Korea. That's about all I'll ever say about it though."
"Many Asian countries have substantial history and artisanal proficiency at fermenting beverages made from rice and barley - this surely does not speak to that. The rice in this malted beverage was used because it was more economical and would result in a less distinctive beer. This may be Korea's number one selling beer but let us not overlook that that statement is a reflection of popularity, not of quality."
"overall i wouldn't really choose it out to drink again, maybe if i was in the country"
"I hope the good people there have more to choose from then this."
"Bottle from LCBO: Light gold modest white head with fair retention, light lacing of the glass. Aroma is mainstrean commercial euro-lager, light noble hop grassiness, light sulphur must from lager yeast and light grainy tones. Light body, smooth with some real malt and hop ambiance finishes fast clean and sharp. For a light lager this is better than most commercial mega-brewed Canadian lights...at least it's all gristed malt, no malt extracts no corn or rice and has a modicum of flavor. Drinkable but absolutely undistinguished."
"Good for sake bombs and not terrible by itself."
"Drank this while in Beijing at a Korean restaurant. Pours a pale yellow, with little head retention. There is a bit of barley and malt flavoring that shines through on the beer. It has a slight alcohol taste, not really watery. It was fairly good to drink with the food I was eating."
"Drinkability - It's definitely not appealing and I wouldn't drink another one. Definitely not."
"D: It's light, low ABV and tasteless if cold. Actually, this beer is almost tasteless warm too. Certainly easy drinking, if nothing else. Pretty much a mid-pack adjunct lager."
"Possibly the most flavourless beer I've had. Even beats Kilkenny in that way. However, no flavour is better than bad flavour!"
"Drinkability: Easy drinker. Would not try again unless I'm at a korean restaurant"
"While I surely don't know everything about the whole ""Clean, Crisp and Fresh!"" claims on the label, I can proffer my opinion of this average Asian macro lager - it is certainly none of the above, but hardly off-putting by the same measure. Watery, generally inoffensive to your average bear, and good enough, I suppose, for a tick from a nation so preoccupied with that Soju shit."
"This is not a great beer, but it serves its purpose, and I can only imagine the vast majority of the demographic that drinks this beer could give a shit less about BA. This is not something I could ever see drinking on a regular basis, but it actually pairs quite well with Korean dishes that exhibit a lot of umami, like bulgogi, kalbi or dol sot, and helps to cleanse the mouth (much in the way pickled ginger does)."
"Easy to drink and goes perfect with korean bbq."
"Conclusion: It is what it is, and what it is, is way above typical for the style"
"Verdict: I would never drink this on its own, but it does an admiral job of cutting through the sweetness and spice of daeji bulgogi, without overwhelming it. At $3/22oz during happy hour at my spot, it's pretty hard to beat."
"taste is watery, grain, sourish malt, touch of corn, ends with a strange aftertaste that is somewhat nutty."
"Taste is thankfully much better than the nose. It is sweet and grainy with a refreshing crispness. There is even a few hints of floral hops in there that along with the fairly high carbonation level leave a dry, clean finish. I dont think I will have much of a problem finishing off my 22oz of this. It would be tasty ice cold on a hot afternoon. I may go so far as to say I might buy this again, and would not be bad with some Korean barbecue."
"I don't think I'll be ordering it next time."
"Pours a clear pale yellow. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of adjunct and a lager (cleanliness). Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of lager cleanliness, adjunct, and some pale malt. Overall, a pretty common adjunct lager."
"M + D: Carbonation is quite mellow, and body is quite thin. This was picked up simply because it was available, and I don't see myself grabbing anymore... no big recommendations here."
"An easy drinking beer, but I would not go out of my way to get any. Just slightly different than other macro lagers."
"This beer was surprisingly not...awful. It poured a golden color and had decent head. Aroma was faint but hinted at the presence of (dare I say it?)...malt and hops. Mouthfeel was a touch thin. Not too shabby, but I won't be seeking this out, and I recommend you follow that same course."
"Drinkability: Ugh. Hite doesn't exactly represent the height of lager brewing."
"From a 12oz can - Pours a clear light pale yellow. Not pretty at all. No carbonation, no lacing . Smells of corn and very light malts. First sip is almost flavorless with just a tad of hops and malts ...almost water like. I cannot imagine consuming this product."
"Look for the soda style bottle."
"Hite pours a golden yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There isn't much in the way of aroma, no off odors in any case. The mouthfeel is the same as any other lager. The flavor is very mild, there is a bit of hops. This is a very crisp, refreshing lager. It's probably as good as any other macro lager I've tried. Sampled at a Korean restaurant in Orlando, I haven't seen it available anywhere else in central or south Florida."
"I didn't detect the overwelming sweetness that bedevilled other reviewers. An average to slightly below average lager..nothing more, nothing less."
"This drinks slow mostly due to the extreme sweetness, but work well with spicy sushi, i prefer this to BMC"
"Thin-bodied and refreshing with macro-style carbonation."
"D - it's refreshing with some korean food which is the only way that i've ever had it. it does its job, but it's not a beer to seek out for enjoyment on its own."
"Good as a thirst-quencher with spicy Korean food as you can drink it like water and the alcohol is so low (is it really 4.5%?) you won't even notice."
"Pours a clear straw gold. White head. Blah blah blah. They all pour like this. And the head never stays. Very minor citrus tone it seems on the nose. Flavor is, well, bad. Really. Isn't skunked, but it tastes way dirty. Definitely not cleanly filtered. Feel has a good level of carbonation, and the liquid is a pretty good feel too. But overall this is one mediocre at best lager. Bad. Bad, bad, bad."
"Appearance is a light golden in color with a big crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell of very light adjuncts. Taste is light from malt to hops with a bit of sweetness and good carbonation. Mouthfeel is of course light that has refreshing aspects that could be enjoyed in warmer weather."
"It makes a good lightly colored water, just not worth the price."
"This beer is all about crisp refreshingness...dry, a bit tangy, nice bitterness, like one of those Japanese rice beers. Very good for thirst quenching with Korean food, nothing offensive to get in the way. Better than many of these macrolagers."
"Drinkability: Perhaps the highlight of this beer - you can drink a lot of it, and very quickly if you needed to. That said, why bother?"
"Overall: Not a whole lot to dwell on here, but this is better than almost any other Asian beer I've had. A strange colour (very yellow and radioactive-looking) but it's refreshing and just what I was after."
"Overly carbonated like bud light and thats the only thing that let me know I was drinking beer."
"Packaging looks like bottled water, tastes like beer-flavored sparkling water."
"Drinkability: Well, this is not a very tasty brew, but nothing disgusting. Light flavors, watered down and a pretty bad mouthfeel overall."
"This was a trade I did with someone, not impressed with it. I gave it a 1 because I split this with someone and I didn't finish it."
"Notes: I would put this in the below average category within the style. Easy to drink as I watch some College Basketball. Nothing to think about here."
"According to the bottle, a Korean brew that I drank from the bottle (sorry, no visual descriptives as a prelude) but since there were other reviews on this, just had to put my 2 cents in. A strange empty tasting brew (?malts?) with no flavor. But there must be something in it, because it leaves an awful aftertaste."
"Drinkability/notes: Drinkable, rather nondescript, inoffensive, but lacking character."
"D: Naw, i'm gonna pass next time. Nothing special here. Couldn've been an American Macro made in Milwaukee, and I wouldn't have known the difference."
"Thanks to Pegasus for sharing."
"Drinkability- Goes down smooth"
"d: Isn't much of a beer (btw; the menu in the restaurant lists Soju in Korean with English translation ""hard liquor"")...but it's definitely drinkable."
"Overall, not one I will have again. You need to drink this very cold and very fast. As I mentioned, the first sip wasn't bad. But I let it sit in my glass too long and it just got worse and worse. I didn't even finish the bottle."
"However, I did see a great poster that advertises this beer. (It was not displayed, but I was fortunate enough to see it.) The great bodies of naked women with body paint on them. If you can, grab the poster, leave the beer."
"640 ml bottle - dull gold hue  no head  nose of sweet corn , bread , and sweet rice - bitter, malt, skunk, cat urine and slight hopps taste - light semi dry body- cat pee , bitter skunk aftertaste do not have have anything else to say about this beer"
"First off, it's one of the lighest color beers I've ever seen. If you soaked a few grains of straw in glass of tonic water for an hour, the color would be unmistakeably Hite-ish. The smells would probably be similar too. The taste isn't terrible - it's watery, there's lil character but it is refreshing. At a Korean bbq you'll probably drink like 4 before you realize that it's not very good. But for those 4, at that bbq joint - Hite does the trick."
"Overall, it's a pretty decent, refreshing golden lager."
""
"Downed 2 quick ones in Nagoya while waiting for the train. This stuf is NOT BAD. Somewhat watery with lots of head when poured. Clear color with a little lace. Some hops detected and better than any domestic lite beers. I cracked up when I read the can... ""Brewed with water found under the ground"" .. Doesn't have a whole lotta flavor but there is something about a cold beer on a hot day after eating wasabe coated sushi."
"This isn't a craft beer but I can't say that it is offensive either. This your basic light lawnmower beer with a bit more carbonation and a bit of extra hops. Not a first choice but I could drink this when hot and thirsty if I had too."
"This beer is quite literally everywhere in my residence in Incheon and I utterly detest it. Many places it's the only beer on tap and sometimes the only beer at all making soju your only other option..ouch."
"It has a decent head on it from the pour, a finger and a half of white foam that retains longer than most N. American macros. The body however is a pale, pale clear straw-like hue, very washed out and watered down looking. The aroma is also quite bland, a quick intake of cidery corn sweetness, an underlying sourness, and that's all you get. The flavour gets worse the more I drink it, a grainy cidery flavour with a bit of an adjunct burn on the finish in lieu of where the hops should be. The mouthfeel is actually pretty average for what it should be for this style except that the sandpaper rip of the overcarbonation over the palate and tongue spoils the party. Not a very pleasant or user-friendly beer for the most part, I'm only halfway through the bottle and I can't shake this nasty cidery aftertaste, while my tongue gets sandblasted from every sip. At least there's some comfort knowing that the macros from other countries overseas are just as bad, if not worse, than our own."
"Nothing to write home about, this korean brew doesnt bring much to the already crowded dull tasting macro pale lager market"
"Sinkability  I wouldnt drink this again if someone paid me to. The s-hite refrence was already used, so Ill just assume that the word hite is Korean for, nasty-ass crap in a bottle."
"The beer dispenses from the bottle light gold color with the head bright white and modest in size, texture is frothy, the lace a thin velum like sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is malt sweet, crisp and clean; start is sweet, thinly malted, top cadaverous in feel. Finish is mild in its acidity, the hops present but quite subdued in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a typical thin waisted lager that has little merit in my humble opinion."
"Okay, so Hite isn't the greatest brew on the planet (or even in Asia) but there are worse. Nonetheless, I'd advise against wearing out a pair of shoes trying to find it."
"If you enjoy American macrobrewed beers you won't find too many faults with Korea's best selling lager. Goes down nicely with red pepper paste (with a drop of sesame oil) and dried cuttlefish and anchovies."
"Notes: One word, ""s-hite""."
"I was actually a little surprised by this one. Surprised it was not vile. Pours a clear gold color with a thin white head. No real lacing to speak of and the head was short-lived. The aroma is lightly sweet which was another surprise. Light-bodied with a barely average hops flavor. The finish is a little sweet and a little fruity. This isn't a beer I would seek out again but I would drink it in Korea over a Bud."
"very pale golden beer, very clear, with a ghost of a head. The carbonation disappears quickly. The smell is subdued, almost nonexistent. The taste sweet, slight, and somewhat non-descript. There's some malt, and its a crisp drink, but not memorable."
"It is what it is; a palate cleanser between bites of Kimchi. A rice lightened lager intended for people who like easy-going beers, Hite's only stand-out quality is an above average bitter hop profile. Inoffensive, but there are way better Korean beers to be had. Aren't there?"
"If you can get past a bottle that looks a bit like Diet Sprite, this beer's not too bad.  I've tried this at Koreatown (L.A.) sushi bars and have found it to be better than all the Japanese beers.  It's not quite as grainy tasting as the Japanese beers and is more drinkable."
