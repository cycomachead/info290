This is reflected in the flavour, accompanied by a decisive bitterness. Good body for the style; it envelops the palate. Didn't pick up on the grapefruit, but it really doesn't matter.

Color is a gold amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is fresh beer, malt, hop, a little fruit and spice. Flavor's like nose, plus sweet in the front, bittler on top, tang on the sides; some grain and a little hop floral. Body and carbonation are excellent.

BC brewers could learn a thing or two from them. This lager pours a bright golden colour. Fruity, honey aromas with floral notes pour forth. Great easy-drinking mouthfeel with enough hops on the finish to balance. A terrific session beer for summer.","CookstLiquor","Jun 05, 2012"

Definitely a session beer, but not something to quaff or drink too fast. Somehow the bottled-version tastes very differently from the cask-conditioned version. I had a pint of it on cask each at GBBF 04 and 05, and it tasted much more grapefruity, sweeter and while at even lower carbonation, it was more like a golden bitter to meThis bottle tastes cleaner, more refreshing, and allows the more subtle German hop flavour to come out at a perhaps lower serving temp. Id say I like both versions, and would love to compare them side by side if given any chance!","wl0307","Jul 30, 2005"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle, now available in Norway. ABV here is 4.7%. Golden colour, large to moderate white head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is initially surprisingly moderate but nice and pleasant, improves as the beer warms up a little (started drinking it too cold), flowery and citrussy hops (Hersbrücker and Challenger), hints of honey too. Flavour is zesty and grapefruity, the hops dominate but there is also a sufficient malty base. Bitter aftertaste of grapefruit peel. A very unusual lager, clearly related to its golden ale cousin, the Bitter & Twisted.","Sigmund","Nov 17, 2004"

Yes, tis true, a cask-conditioned lager does exist (Slaters premium is another one, is it not?). This is a light golden coloured brew with a small white head of foam. Aromas are of fresh floral hops, and nice bready malts. The taste is simple as well. Like any good German lager, except much fresher, and much, much better! The mouthfeel is creamier than most lagers, and the drinkability is insane. As Darren said, you can have 6 of these bad boys, in no time!
