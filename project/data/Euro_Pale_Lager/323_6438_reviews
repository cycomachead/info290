"Citrus twist but a deft touch with a slight bitter aftertaste"

"Pours clear golden with bubbly white 1-finger head, retention is moderate, reduction to a ring of froth and nice laces. Aroma is grainy and crisp, grassy notes. Delicate balance between malt body and hop bitter finish. Moderate carbonation. Excellent suggestion among other lagers."

"Drinkability – This lager has more flavor than a typical lager, though it isn't one of my favorite lagers."

"Nice - a quality lager. Gives the impression of having been properly matured. Looks the part, with a relatively subtle aroma of hops and yeast. This is reflected in the flavour, accompanied by a decisive bitterness. Good body for the style; it envelops the palate. Didn't pick up on the grapefruit, but it really doesn't matter. A great beer from a brewery that knows what it's doing - well worth sampling if you come across it."
"Overall: good beer. If you're after a good quality lager, this is much pretty spot on."
"O: not bad at all! bitter, but not biting - somewhat surprised and delighted by the malty goodness - looks and tastes a good bit German (as in Kölsch) - very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Very crisp and refreshing taste, delicious zesty and piney flavor. Bitter aftertaste. This is definitively among the top range of beers with high drinkability I have tasted so far."
"With this I believe I've tried all the Harviestoun beers available on our shores. I dig what these guys do."

"Good quaffer for those warmer days."

"Aroma is mainly husky grains, bready malts and fairly floral in the hop department. Feels very smooth as if on nitro, creamy and medium bodied. Malt forward, English in character with a pleasant hop bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Full flavored and full bodied for a lager, pretty nice in fact. Would drink this regularly if it was more widely available."

"Pretty decent brew. Poured at a good temperature with a nice, foamy, frothy, off-white head that settles after a bit and a smidgen of lace. Color is a gold amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is fresh beer, malt, hop, a little fruit and spice. Flavor's like nose, plus sweet in the front, bittler on top, tang on the sides; some grain and a little hop floral. Body and carbonation are excellent. Finish is like flavor, of average length and very easy drinking. Tasty, but a little pricey."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle. It's great to have Harviestoun beers in BC. They are perfect examples of how beers can be ""small"" but flavourful. BC brewers could learn a thing or two from them. This lager pours a bright golden colour. Fruity, honey aromas with floral notes pour forth. Great easy-drinking mouthfeel with enough hops on the finish to balance. A terrific session beer for summer."
"Overall: a very drinkable and refreshing pale lager, I would definitely have this again."
"Food match: Seafood springs to mind... yes, I am a vegetarian and it is a worry that seafood springs to mind... oysters on the half shell or a decent crumbed calamari, with a nice light salad... yum."

"Flowery, enamoured, a tad indulgent, you may say. Whatevs, this is a kick-ass example of the style, and quite ripe for promotion to a more heady classification. Try if you can."

"O: This lager is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties with its dryness. It’s quite unique because normally you only see this much hops in IPAs."

"500ml bottle. Lager glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Bright golden color. Crystal clear appearance. White, dense, crown with fairly good retention. Sweet malt aroma, floral hints. Crisp upfront & sweet maltiness. Flavors involved by sweet/sour fruitness & subtle puckering touch. Evident bitterness showing citric notes. Gentle clean bitter palate. Medium body, soft carbonation. Slightly fruity aftertaste. Interesting hop selection : Challenger, Styrian Golding & Hallertau Hersbrucker. Very pleasant drinkability. Well balanced flavors & aromas. An elegant lager above the regular average. Highly recommended as refreshing session beer"
"Overal a nice refreshing lager, one of the beter ones I have had (mostly macro's)."

"Overall: Schiehallion has that strong lemony tone I felt their Bitter & Twisted had, leaving it just a bit too Lemon Pledge-y for me."
""
"Mouthfeel is just mildly dry. And then there is some tannic character, like licking a broken open banana peel but not nearly as intense as a banana peel."
"A very drinkable beer; it goes down quite easily."
""
"aroma is light grains, bready malts, a hint of light bittering hops but nothing special really, until i take the first taste and I am blown away by how good this one is, crisp, clean and nearly perfect carbonation gives way to a classic lager. i had no clue this one was coming. notes of clove, quick hits of light hops and grain, a healthy dose of bready malts and a smooth, clean and wonderfully refreshing finish"

"O - Refreshing. Not a bad lager. Decent balance of flavours. Drink it cold."
"Overall , a beer of two halves. Don't know if it's off or not. Sad."
"Overall a very nice beer. Used to be an A- on here. I'm probably slightly more inclined to opt for the Bitter and Twisted because it can be a bit more aromatic. Subtle, drinkable and affordable. Go to beer."
"Probably (heh) the best craft ager in the UK."
"Pours a clear pale golden hue which leaves a two finger head that settles to a layer of froth and clingy lacing,the smell is herbal hops,sweet caramel malts and freshly cut grass,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and has tastes of sweet barley sugar,herbal grassy hops,sweet caramel malts,pears and finished with a herbal hoppy dryness and overall even though this brew wont set hearts on fire it is very drinkable and a total session drop and for that value id buy again and dont let its low rating fool you because if sessionability was a rating it would rate 5 cheers."
"Good body depth (for the style) and all in all a good friendly lager. very surprised however to find it in the UK's top 100 beers on BA, reviewed 30 times now!"
"This is a wonderful midrange beer, but it remains a C. It kills me to call it a rating associated with ""average", because it's anything but average. But it lacks the complexity and uniquity to propel it into the B echelon."
"Overall I was a bit let down with this beer, I’d be more understanding if the ABV were a bit lower but I was expecting more heft given the extra 1% or so ABV. A well done beer that’s worth a shot but not worth seeking out."
"Overall pretty easy drinking, interesting take but can't say I would highly desire this beer again."
"Nothing spectacular, but still a pretty solid beer."
"M: The mouthfeel reflects the concentrated biscuit flavors, gradually pulling in hops flavors. Good, especially because I'm not likely to see it on cask anytime soon."
"Very nice beer. Way to start and evening."
"It's a very easy-drinking beer, and the hoppiness comes through when it's needed to add the crispness. A very decent pilsener."
"D - This is miles ahead of competing Euro Lagers, and I like it more than Bitter & Twsited due to the hop character and attenuated malt bill. If it weren't for the slightly harsh carbonation, this would be a great session lager. Try this when visiting Europe if you can find if fresh."
"Poured into a pint glass. Excellent lager. Golden, slightly cloudy beer. Citric, floral and herbal hops and malty aromas. The flavor follows the aroma and is refreshing and light, despite its complexity in the aromas. Is very well balanced and has great drinkability."
"D- Very confused beer to me, its obviously brewed as a lager but with very obvious pale ale characteristics. Not a good clean finish a good lager should have, and carbonation not high enough. Not a beer i would go out of my way to find."
"Notes: Hard to really decide what style this taste like, a lot like a lager and an IPA, but when talking about Euro Pale lagers, something like this definitely doesn't come to mind. Good hop flavors, and easy to drink. Easily recommended if you have a chance to get it."
"a great Pilsner."
"Exceptionally drinkable which teams solid flavours and craft with classic lager crispness and refreshment. This is a truly great beer."
"d) Not sure... seems like I'm drinking a liquified lemon tart. Need a pale ale to wash it down..."
"Overall - A good, clean, crisp and very drinkable lager.... recommended..."
"D: Incredibly drinkable."
"Not my usual style of beer, but yet I found it very drinkable and even went back for a second round. As an ale it was a bit disapointing, but once I accepted this was more like a lager it made for a more pleasant experience."
"D - Drinkability is very high. I'd love to try this on cask."
"This appears a bog standard straw colour, but the nose is wonderfully sweet and citric. It has a rather dry feel and certainly doesn't taste as sweet as the smell suggests, but it is certainly good stuff. The flavour is more lemon rind than grapefruit and there is a hint of black tea in there too. Definitely a beer for hop lovers."
"Bham UK Jan 2006"
"D: medium-bodied, fantastic lager with plenty of flavours and a good depth of tea-like texture which I like the most about this beer. Definitely a session beer, but not something to quaff or drink too fast. Somehow the bottled-version tastes very differently from the cask-conditioned version. I had a pint of it on cask each at GBBF 04 and 05, and it tasted much more grapefruity, sweeter and while at even lower carbonation, it was more like a golden bitter to meThis bottle tastes cleaner, more refreshing, and allows the more subtle German hop flavour to come out at a perhaps lower serving temp. Id say I like both versions, and would love to compare them side by side if given any chance!"
"500 ml bottle, now available in Norway. ABV here is 4.7%. Golden colour, large to moderate white head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is initially surprisingly moderate but nice and pleasant, improves as the beer warms up a little (started drinking it too cold), flowery and citrussy hops (Hersbrücker and Challenger), hints of honey too. Flavour is zesty and grapefruity, the hops dominate but there is also a sufficient malty base. Bitter aftertaste of grapefruit peel. A very unusual lager, clearly related to its golden ale cousin, the Bitter & Twisted."
"Man, this goes down easy, easy but really tasty!"
"On-Cask somewhere in Scotland, where else!? HA! No, really I sampled this one on-cask at the excellent Three Judges pub in Glasgow, Scotland. Yes, tis true, a cask-conditioned lager does exist (Slaters premium is another one, is it not?). This is a light golden coloured brew with a small white head of foam. Aromas are of fresh floral hops, and nice bready malts. The taste is simple as well. Like any good German lager, except much fresher, and much, much better! The mouthfeel is creamier than most lagers, and the drinkability is insane. As Darren said, you can have 6 of these bad boys, in no time! Anyway, this is one awesome lager, and it has to get 4.5s accross the board from me. If you ever see this beast on cask in Scotland, have a few pints!"
"Its odd to find a cask lager, but this beer really did suprise me, very good"
"This lager poured a clear, golden color with white foam that persisted fairly long before settling. The smell was a ""wort like"" aroma, reminiscent of German ungespundete lagers. There was a touch of hops in the smell. The taste was floral and bitter hops with some slightly sweet malt to balance. The sweetness was then followed by some hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low carbonation. Slightly tangy. This was a very decent and interesting lager."
"I've been buying 1-3 bottles of this on each shopping trip for 6 months or so now. I like it."
"Note: Somewhere above, I have no doubt probably offended the entire Scottish nation more than Mel Gibson in Braveheart, for which I unreservedly apologize. Don't think that all Scottish Beer is McEwans Scotch Ale. What I will say is that if you ever get to the UK and see this beer on Handpump - HAVE IT, and add to your Beer Styles tally !!!"
