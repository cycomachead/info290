Label says ale...but it doesn't look that different than the Dortmunder lager also made by Shiner. So is it the same beer or a different one? Can't quite tell, but if this is an ale, I think it's mislabeled and instead it is indeed a Dortmunder export lager. All that potential mislabel aside, it's a good beer that goes well with food (Zucchini cakes in this case) and I suspect it would go well with a lot of other food, or all by itself.","damndirtyape","May 06, 2012"

It's light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. It's clean and crisp and the flavors make this very easy to drink. One could easily session this.

But as I enjoyed this while playing some serious Black Ops, the beer had time to warm by perhaps 10*F which improved the taste drastically.

It was too much hop flavour for me since I'm not a fan of hops, but even so it was all right.

Even in Germany, the Dortmunder or ""export"" style is dying out. It just falls too readily between the Munich Helles and southern Pils styles.

Pours brilliant golden crystal clear completely filtered with a bright white foamy head that sticks arounds and coats the glass at the same time. Aroma has pale malts a bit of biscuit/bread dough baking complemented by an assertive herbal/citrus/grassy hop character. Flavor wise it has a honey drizzled biscuit like malt profile with just enough hops to keep it from being cloying sweet, the herbal/citrus/hay like hops dry out the sweet bread malt base so that things just seem to work. Even a bit of mineral water/metallic edge that doesn't offend me or take away from the drinking experience. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a crisp smooth natural feeling carbonation level.

On the bright side served cold it is light and refreshing and absolutely a step above BMC but IMO not much more than average American lager.

I'd definitely be more interested in it during the summer months though.","Fatheranderson","Feb 06, 2011"
3.05,-10.8,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Not bad, but not great. Pretty one-note, but maybe that's all you want in a light spring seasonal. I only bought a single of this though, and I can't really imagine buying any more. Decent but forgettable.","BatDaddy","Feb 06, 2011"

3.83,12,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Opinion: Well, overall this is a pretty decent beer. It has a pretty good mix of malt and hops which is essential for this style and I would actually say that it is pretty close to what the guys over the water are doing. It could use a different balance to the water as this is currently too clean. Either way, it is a pretty good beer and I will enjoy this glass to the end. I'd give it a try if I were you and it was convenient...but I wouldn't drive 100 miles into Texas for it or anything.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 05, 2011"
3.13,-8.5,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured a bomber in anticipation of last year's funness, but nyet. Weird, and I mean WEIRD, aroma and taste that I gotta think was not supposed to be there. Smelled like wet cardboard and burning plastic. Basically it was like I left my GI Joe (in its original cardboard, '70s box - PRICELESS HEIRLOOM!) out in the rain and then it caught on fire. That's what it smelled and tasted like.","specksnreds","Feb 04, 2011"
3.31,-3.2,4,3,3,3.5,4,"D - Drinkability is good. I could see myself putting a few of these back during the warmer spring/summer months. A very ""sessionable"" brew.","kevinv","Feb 03, 2011"
3.33,-2.6,3.5,3,3,3,4.5,"Bought a six pack of this and it was ""ok"" to say the least. I was not too impressed and I would not buy again. Poured a clear orange/yellow. Little hop presence, more malt. Don't prefer this over the regular shiner. Carbonation is average and the taste is not anything to die for.","joshuacavett","Feb 01, 2011"

3.65,6.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours clear copper brown in color, with a white foamy head. Has decent retention. There is a little lacing as well. Smell is mostly of bread and grain malts maybe a little toffee, although there is a nice clean lemon hops presents in the background. Not too complex on the nose. Taste is malty and biscuity with a nice lemon bite to it. Pretty much like the nose although the bread characters are more pronounced. Finishes clean with just a little lemony aftertaste. Very good carbonation. Light to medium body with good bubbly carbonation. Very refreshing a crisp mouth feel. Although very simple it is very good. Seeing is that this is in season and very well priced, I will be picking up more of this beer.","depechemode1983","Jan 31, 2011"
3.88,13.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"FourthBeer potential: ABOVE AVERAGE. A solid effort by Spoetzl. A few of these would be quite refreshing after a round of golf.","kinupanda","Jan 29, 2011"
3.23,-5.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D: I really can't compare this to beers of the Dortmunder style as my only other sampling is Dog Days and that was probably three years ago. As far as I am concerned this is an average Spring release from the boys at Spoetzl, meaning this is something you can grab a case of, throw it on the boat, and enjoy the day out on the water. Too bad it isn't in cans, that way I could take it with me Toobin' on the Guadalupe.","pilotgod","Jan 29, 2011"
3.1,-9.4,3,3,3,3,3.5,"D- The lower ABV on this beer makes it a good multi-drinker. The flavors are a little off but it doesn't make it a bad beer. Nothing too terrible and I would love to have another one if given the chance.","alleykatking","Jan 25, 2011"
3.9,14,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinks really easy, not a world beater here, but one would happily sip on while watching sports on TV or having pizza. There's a few from Shiner I can't stand, but this one is pretty tasty","russpowell","Jan 24, 2011"

3.48,1.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Very lively beer pours a rich honey color with a very bubbly, loose head. Good looking beer. Sweet honey malts and piney hops in the nose. Light pear wisps and some spice, too. Pale malts with more piney hops varieties. A little harsh on the palette, spicy bubbles and a good hops bitterness gives it a slightly raw character. Definite honey tastes. Not bad.","SamN","Jan 23, 2011"
3.89,13.7,4.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Poured into a nonic English pub pint glass, a nice golden color. White head that dissipates to minimal lacing. Smells of floral hops and a whiff of sweetness from the malts. Taste up front is grain followed by light malt sweetness finishing with light floral hops. Carbonation is perfect, flows down the throat with great ease, I could have a few of these and I wouldn't mind.","beerguzlor","Jan 22, 2011"
