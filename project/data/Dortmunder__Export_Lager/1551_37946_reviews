"Overall – A decent lager with a very easy drinking taste and feel. Nothing outstanding but rather crisp and refreshing."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a grassy flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but nothing I would go after again."

"A bit too sweet, reminds of euro pale lager."

"o - Overall a pretty average lager. Lots of that grain and corn in the nose and taste. Not bad at all, but pretty average. Would suggest trying one of their other beers."
"Initial mpression is a cross between unmalted and malted pale grains. Relatively thin, but the aftertaste has a touch of bitterness that brings some good balance. Overall, I'd say this is a true to style Dortmunder. The taste provides a nice recovery from the poor handling of the glassware."
"Had the Golden Export at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a clear yellow with white head that laced slightly. The aroma was common of dortmunder grain, Saaz hops, etc. The first taste was overpowering with grain and was a bit rough, but the following drinks were more smooth. The grain and malt was balanced with hops and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was smooth and easy. good session beer."
"Poured a golden-yellow with a small fizzy white head that fizzled out rather quickly. Grainy aroma, with a light citrusy hop profile. Simple taste, nothing too interesting happening. Lightly toasted grains and light citrus and piney hops, leaving a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Balanced, but just too light for me. Drinkable if you're playing it conservative."
"Aroma of noble hops w some malt. Golden straw color, very clear. Mild hop bitterness, with mellow malt. Overall, good session beer, but a bit thin for my pallet. Restaurant setting w a nice outdoor seating area. Food caters to the masses, as does the beer."
"Not a bad beer overall, which is surprising considering their other beers. I would order this again, especially at GB considering their other options. Good beer for the summer."
"D- American macro lagers wish they could taste like this."
"Poured a medium golden color with a small amount of white head. Not a lot going with the smell but do get a bit of malt and hops. Taste is similar to the smell, nothing much but very clean. Medium carbonation and really easy to drink. Had this as well as a couple other beers at Gordon Biersch. Not great but not bad either."
"Sampled at Gordon Biersch restaurant in Dallas, TX. Pours light-golden hue. Aroma is of hops and some biscuit malt. Body is medium, crisp. Piny hops and biscuit malt are balanced on the palate. Long, dry finish. On the whole, it is nice Helles lager."
"Feel is really nice and crisp. Drinks well in the summer. A style I'd like to see more of and this one is pretty well done."
"The beer felt light and maybe a bit over carbonated, but overall felt right. The beer's best quality was the drinkability. I could have easily could have downed a couple without thinking about it. Overall, a decent beer, but certainly not one that I would seek out or make a special trip to try."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised with Golden Export. I would definitely drink more of this."
"Just bland. Nothing wrong with this beer, but uninspired. Good for what it is, a light lager. Though nothing that resembles a Dortmunder/Export Lager."
"GE pours a very clear, lemon-like gold color with a white head. I could smell a bit of pils malt sweetness in the aroma. The flavor of the beer is balanced between equal parts pils malt and hop bitterness. The pils malt is just a little sweet yet balanced by a medium amount of hop bitterness that is very smooth and sticks around on the palate for a bit. Overall it is medium bodied, medium carbonated, and smooth & balanced."
"Drinkability: Versatile; goes well with a burger or other Gordon Biersch fare"
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Miami brewpub. Medium yellow coloured body with some white head, and lacey. Not a good aroma, cheesy beer smell.A decent bitterness tht has a fresh crispness, though dry. Some apple juice. Better when it was just below room temperature.Below average mouthfeel."
"The first in the line from the 6x Sampler at the Rockville Restaurant. Obviously a very popular beer at GB, but (even by admission of the waiter who said it was popular and added, ""it compares to your typical macro beer""). I wouldn't say it's that bad, but it's definitely the beer of choice for the ""micro-uninitiated."" Plain gold in the glass with soft cream-colored head. No lacing per se, but a nice malt in the nose, soft carbonation, and the taste is almost all malty slick--like butter. Enough hops bitterness to (barely) balance the malt, but definitely a macro-lover's beginning foray to the craft world. Went down well, but I was glad I started with it. The rest only got better."
"D- This veer has a big crisp sulfury flavor with other flavors falling behind or are covered up. I don't hate this beer there is just little flavor character to review."
"A catch-all lager that's smooth, crisp, and rounded and is a complement to nearly every entree on the menu."
"A light, seethru golden body with minimal head that did stay with the beer and maintained some lacings. A crisp, earthy smell belied by some hop bitterness and some fruit notes. A watery, almost bland beer but there is a sharp hop bite and it does go down smooth. I guess this is there version of a light beer, and it is better than a Bud or Miller. That being said, I think this is the beer a non-beer drinker gets and if you like real beer you can skip this, trust me."
"Overall, somewhat refreshing. Not one I would search out. Just too light and lacking any character."
"The export lager poured very clear, a light golden color, with persistant carbonation. Its initial head dispersed to a ring, leaving sudsy retention on the glass. Golden malts, light hops, and as it warmed, an aroma of wildflower honey. Nice. Tasted of floral hops, clean sweet malt, and a slight bitter yeast. Fairly crisp finish. Damned fine for the style, which admittedly is not my favorite."
"Presented as a medium golden color beer with white puffy head. Smell is light with slight malt notes present. Taste is light and refreshing and unobtrusive. Finishes with a slight sweetness but not much else. Easy to drink, but nothing great. A step up from a macro."
"Sampled at the Washington DC location 11.5 Plato, 5.0% ABV. Nice golden pour with a light head bright white in hue. Carbonation level medium and nice. Nose is clean, some hop, some malt, but clean and light. Sweet light malty flavor finishes with a very nice crisp aftertaste. This beer was very well made."
"Very crisp in the mouthfeel, and very clean dry finish. The drinkability is quite nice, and this would be a great choice for a hot summer day."
"This is one of Gordon Biersch's better beers: a pleasant, medium-bodied brew that goes down easy, beer after beer. I've had it at the GB brewery restaurant and in bottles. It's often on sale at Trader Joe's (CA) for $4.99/sixpack, which is a bargain for an above-average beer. GB Golden Export isn't a great beer, but it's a good one: not at all bitter, perhaps even a bit on the sweet side. Not my favorite, but a contender at the right price!"
"Not a bad beer. I've had several and like them but GB has better."
"As I take my first smell, it flashes me back to my days of downing Milwaukee's Best Light after losing at beer-pong. I cant describe the smell very well other than it smelling like a cheap American Lager. The taste is more of the same. Nothing special. Starts like carbonated water and ends with a slight hop bitterness to remind you that you are drinking a beer. The mouthfeel is that of carbonated water. As for drinkability; I could drink it but, why would I want to?"
"Drinkability  This went down quite well."
"This lager poured a clear, yellow color with white foam that settled. The smell was minimal: malt and some hops. The taste was a bit thin: light malt and a touch of bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Overall a bit thin. This was an OK beer, easy to drink, but rather light."
"The beer pours a typical lager/pils golden yellow, monstrous bright white head, frothy in texture and the lace a thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is the archetypal sweet malt, crisp and clean with the start excessively sweet, fair malt presence, top thin as my patience after sitting in the airport for almost 8 hours. Finish brisk in its carbonation and the hops apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste that lingers on to long."
"Overall, this was the best of the three G.B. brews I tried (the others being the Marzen and Blonde Bock). Golden Export had an easy drinkability thanks to the light, crisp feel. This was a nice beer to sit down with after a couple hours of yardwork."
"I really wanted to like this beer, I didn't want to believe the plethora of negative comments about GB. I will not purchase another GB product. I've renamed this beer ""Golden Shower"""
"Though I wouldn't run back to Columbus for this beer, if I got my hands on a bottle, I would be pleased. A nice little lager!"
"Quite a drinkable Dortmunder..though I dunno..the taste grows on you."
"Light straw gold color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is grainy, fruity and sweet. A light bodied dortmunder style lager. Lightly hopped, lightly malted. Mild flavor. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slighty spicy. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly malty, not bitter."
"This beer is very light, in color, aroma, and even taste. Its a blanched straw color with the slightest amount of head. There's very little detectable aroma, other than the slight hint of malt you'd expect from a light lager. The taste is somewhat surprising though. Its a very delicate but interesting beer in this regard. For such a clean taste, it really has many subtle flavors that really compliment each other, and make the beer quite enjoyable. It would be an excellent yard work beer. Quite a surprise."
"This beer is a bright golden yellow, clear, with a moderate head and very little lacing effect. The aroma is fairly light with a nice malt sense. This is also a very crisp beer with plenty of bready grain sense. A good solid beer, but not one tha will set the world on fire. A bit light in body sense."
"Beer was easy to drink, would be a good session type of beer."
"Overall, good food. Unfortunately, picked the wrong night to go as the place was packed to the rafters."
"So this is a Dortmunder. Nice hops and gold (not yellow!) color. Medium head and minimal lacing. While crisp and refreshing, this is by no means GB's best beer, if you are getting a GB, go for the Marzen or Dunkles."
"As usual, a very good-looking beer. Taste is simply malt and a slight sourness that seems common in Gordon Biersch beers. Not impressive but not bad. This beer goes really well with the pot stickers. Actually tastes better with them than without."
