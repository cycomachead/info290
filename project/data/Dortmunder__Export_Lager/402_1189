Aroma is bready with some honey notes & a hint of biscuit, grassy & floral hops. Taste is biscuity & soda cracker malt with toasty hints, lemon, grassy hops, a dominating bitterness & a malty, mineral aftertaste.

Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off-white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, honey, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, biscuit, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, clean, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Dortmunder style. Good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 07, 2013"

Bitterness is up there with a clean, supportive dietary supplement. Fresh cracked biscuit with some sharp churned butter.

It had a miniature head of small white bubbles that just fizzled away in a matter of only a few seconds. It just left a spatter of white bubbly lace and rings. If you put your ear to it, it sounds a lot like Rice Krispies. You can hear snap, crackle and pop! It barely had an aroma to it. The aroma was just toasted malt, hops, sweet butter, and with a hint of citrus fruits. The first taste I received from this beer was butter. I thought the first taste was going to be malt, but not this lager. After the butter comes a pinch of toasted malt and just a slight snap of citrus hops at the end. I didn't know Old Dominion was buttering up their beer. I guess they had some butter lying around the brewery and decided to put it in the beer to make it taste like you're eating popcorn at the movie theater. The mouthfeel was light and just had a small aftertaste of citrus fruits. Without the butter taste, it would have risen this beer to an average run of the mill Lager beer that would have been OK to drink, but with it, I wouldn't drink it again. Too much butter and not enough malt or any other decent flavors.","AltBock","Mar 14, 2007"

The light body gives it a good drinkability. This is a good session beer. You can take this beer to a picnic or BBQ. It works perfectly well in situations when you will drink more than one.

Diacetyl is also big on the palate, there is a nice bitterness that lingers and a hint of metal. The flavor is substantial and the malt notes remind me of a brown ale.

Old Dominion is a Dortmunder Export, very similar in character to the the excellent, Great Lakes version. This pours a clear, golden body with a healthy vanilla white head that is mediumsized, The head hangs around quite a bit, and leaves a moderate dose of patch lace on the glass. Aroma has lots of floral hoppiness with an undertone of grainy malt. A hint of clover honey caps the bouquet. Mouthfeel is underwhelming, but decent enough, with light to medium body and adequate carbonation. The taste is quite good. Assertive floral and herbal hops are augmented by some sour lemon. Malt presence balances well, with a touch of soda cracker and clover honey. Fruity pear notes appear midway. Well balanced finish with mild citric bitterness. Complex for a lager, but this is a well rendered version of the Dortmunder style, which in my opinion puts Classic American Lagers to shame. Excellent drinkability.

3.55,-1.1,3,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Clear pale golden color with a very thin head and minimal lace. Forced carbonation is very lively. Aroma is clean and grainy with subtle delicately floral hops. Taste is again clean grainy malt with very light hoppyness. There are almost no fruity esters to speak of. A little citric tartness starts creeping in mid palette. Enjoy this for what it is folks, a simple, clean, sessionable lager. Pretty similar in most respects to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but a bit less malty. Thanks AragornUnplugged for this trade.","rajendra82","Mar 28, 2004"
2.97,-17.3,2.5,3,2.5,3,4,"I'm drinking this nice beer out of a Dominion pint glass I just bought at their Ashburn, VA, brewpub this weekend. It's a dark golden color that had a nice white head (gone now, though). I'm not quite sure what niche this beer fills because it won't help macro-drinkers convert to micros, but it's not really different enough from a macro to attract your average micro-drinker. Actually, however, that's one of its strong suits for me: I don't like Bud and Coors because I know they taste bad to me, but my palate is not refined enough to taste all the subtleties in most craft beers, so their flavors are often lost on me. This one has just enough flavor, carbonation, and body to make me enjoy it-- and it's not even a style I normally enjoy.","AndIWantYou","Mar 07, 2004"

3.92,9.2,5,3,4,5,4,"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied dortmunder/helles. Malts are mild, slightly sweet and a touch fruity. Hops are mild as well. Spicy and citrusy, but not very bitter. This is a very well balanced beer. It smooth as silk and very clean tasting. Nice ""lager"". Would make an excellent gateway beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Aug 10, 2003"

3.65,1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a golden color and formed a foamy white head that left some lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, hops and grain with a touch of caramel. A flavor of malt, hops and caramel. The finish was light with some hint of caramel and grain. A nice lager but a bit sweet for the style in my opinion.","Wildman","Jun 10, 2003"
4.05,12.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Proper lawnmower beer - sweetish (honey/apricot) malt and slight graininess with a well balanced hoppiness (I get mostly noble hop, but there is some citrus way in the back), good underlying bitterness, and a slightly drier finish followed by a slightly sweeter aftertaste. My buddy in DC always has a good supply of these on hand, and for good reason - it's a very drinkable everyday brew. Homebrewers take note: The brewpub will let you take a jar of slurry home, and I've tasted some homebrews using this yeast that are very, very good.","sponberg","Apr 20, 2003"
4.05,12.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall, a good, clean lager. This isn't a style I'm really into, but I enjoyed this beer and would be glad to have another. Not quite as much character as GLBC's Dortmunder Gold, but one of the better pale lagers I've tried.","PhantomVodoo","Apr 16, 2003"

4.03,12.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This lager pours a clear bright golden with a nice white head. Balance is the watchword for a Dortmunder style lager and I would say this beer is one of the most balanced I have tasted in a long time. The aroma is very mild and all malt. The flavor is quite balanced with a little malt sweetness and a hop bite that lingers on the tongue. This is a crisp fresh beer that has a surprisingly medium nearly creamy mouthfeel. I would recommend this beer and find it quite drinkable.","LarryKemp","Mar 29, 2003"
3.53,-1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a good head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Clear amber color with more malt than hops but the balance is there. This beer has a crisp, smooth, and clean malt palate - very different from the big lagers like Bud. It finishes with a good balance of malt and hop but not bitter.","jdhilt","Mar 24, 2003"
3.88,8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew pours a deep golden color with a very foamy white head. A light hoppy aroma introduces a light bodied lager with a floral hop presence and a dry malt flavor. The finish is clean a crisp. Altogether a very drinkable brew that goes down easily. Great Sunday sports brew.","beernut7","Mar 23, 2003"
3.97,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A clear golden body is topped by a short, foamy, bright-white head that dissipates fairly readily but holds a decent collar and thin surface covering as well as leaving some trace lace. The nose welcomes you with a firm expression of grainy malt dressed up by a softly floral & mildly citrusy hoppiness that's actually quite interesting with a soft touch of lemon (?). The body is light/medium with a fine carbonation that caresses the tongue and then falls away quite smoothly. The flavor is exactly as might be expected - a lightly sweet and grainy malt that's gently infused with floral & softly citrusy hop flavors, backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes short and dry. A well-done, refreshing, and enjoyable lager that could easily fit many occassions and would make a great cross-over beer for the macro drinker. It makes me think of summer, baseball, and backyard BBQ's although it's just as good on a crisp night nestled in with a good book or video.","NeroFiddled","Dec 25, 2002"
4.07,13.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy bright golden color with a thin white head.  Smell has nice hop aromas.  The hop flavor is light, but it compliments the smooth malt flavors of the brew very well.  Nice light body and nicely smooth in the mouth.  Very drinkable.  This is a very nice brew.  Will definitely go well with the hot weather of the summer.","Murph","May 18, 2002"
4.06,13.1,5,4,4,4,4,"Old Dominion Lager is the primary house brew. I like it on tapthough sometimes it has a slight sulphurous aroma and after taste do to overuse of the yeast.One of the original recipes at OD I believe was created by John Mallet former brewmaster.Somewhat rich in flavor as a lager better in cooler weather.","DOCALYN","Aug 17, 2001"
