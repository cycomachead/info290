" Overall, a very respectable 3.75 for Labrador Lager from Thirsty Dog Brewing Company. This was very refreshing and clean. I will buy this brew again!"

"Labrador Lager brewed by Thirsty Dog Brewing Company with an ABV of 6.0%. This brew pours out a dark amber color- almost brown- with a small, white head. This is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell of this brew is sweet with some grains. Reminds me of sweet brewed tea. Nothing bad about this brew so far.The taste is clean, sweet, smooth ,and refreshing. You pick up on sweetness of this brew. Labrador Lager is a real nice balanced brew. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth and sweet. Overall I'm giving this brew 5 out of 5. This is a great brew with a great taste. I will buy this brew again..."
"Not sure why people are rating this beer so low. It's a fantastic Dortmunder. Full bodied for a lager and great flavor and after taste."

"Very sessionable, basic, refreshing lager. The floral hop notes are nice, but that tangy acetaldehyde note kind of ruins it."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly cloudy deep gold color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of cracker, biscuit, honey, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, biscuit, honey, herbal, floral, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, biscuit, honey, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good dortmunder style. Good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Set aside your preconceptions of lagers as fizzy yellow brews with little character. This is a creamy brew with a refined, if rather subtle, aroma and taste. Sure, it is neither rich nor bold, but very pleasing nonetheless. It is above average in all respects, but the perfectly carbonated, lively but soft mouthfeel may be its strongest point."

"In fact, even some of the most renown beer writers have had difficulty pinning down exactly what distinguishes the style from other pale lagers. One thing we know for sure, Dortmunders originated in an industrial city - not an artsy one. It is a utilitarian beer by design, produced to deliver efficient, thorough refreshment - not contemplative sipping. Thirsty Dog gets it."

"Pours golden straw, with a thin white head which disappears quickly. Seems very carbonated. Aroma has all the typical notes of a lager, light slightly sweet, and bready. The taste is very fruity at the tounge, which turns to a bready bitterness in the finish. This is middle of the road for me, I've had lagers that are better and worse. Overall I would like to see the bready malt kicked up a notch to balance the sweetness."

"O: It is a very drinkable beer. It will serve you well on a hot day to cool off. It is definitely worth a drink if you can get your hands on it."

"Overall/Comments: This was a very tasty well put together brew that goes down easy and wont fill you up. I really enjoyed this one!! Classified as a Dortmunder/Export Lager @ 6% ABV. Consumed 4/11/2013."

"O: This beer seems to be a bit heavier compared to other beers in the style but it is still very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good beer, it's a bit fruity and floral for the style. It feels like it's approaching a bock in many ways (body & sweetness), but overall it's a tasty and drinkable brew."
"one of the best lagers I have had, and it were available locally, I would make it one of my go to beers."

"O - The only other beer of this style I have had in Great Lakes Dortmunder. This has a different taste to it. Reminds me more of a British style. I am pleasantly surprised by how good it is."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent enough Dortmunder, though I would like to see a bit more hop balance"
"Notes: Dam this is tasty an amazing meal in a bottle and very drinkable. Cheers."
"Overall, this is just a beautiful example of the dortmunder lager. One of the best I've had. Well balanced, true to style. If you like them a little drier and hoppier, get Great Lakes BC."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch off-white head that stayed around a little while. There's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready and sweet malt, and some light grassy hops. It tastes like bready and sweet malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. It goes down easy enough. This certainly isn't one of the better Dortmunder Lagers I've had. It's not a bad beer by any means, but there's nothing about this that would make me want to buy it again."

"Lager is one of my favorite styles and this is a good one. Some craft brews are just overpowering. Golden color, yeasty nose and a thin head. Nicely hopped and a slightly sweet finish. I enjoyed it as much or more as other Ohio craft lagers. Enjoyable by itself and washing down some nachos as I watch hockey."
"Notes: A bit too sweet for my current interest in drier German-style lagers. I was hoping for a little more bittering hops."
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought that it wasn't a good example of a Dortmunder, the flavors were bland and there was way too much sweetness that seemed to dominate everything else. This beer doesn't have good drinkability, it doesn't hold my interest and is way too sweet, one is more then enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the label, it's pretty sad that the label was the best thing about this beer, but that's the truth. What I liked least about this beer was pretty much everything else, there wasn't one part of this beer that didn't have some issues and the sweetness really hurt it. I wouldn't buy this beer again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This seems to be the first miss that I have had from this brewery, it just missed the mark on what a good Dortmunder should be like, and so far this is my least favorite Dortmunder I have had with Great Lakes Dortmunder gold still being my favorite, and this beer isn't even remotely as good as Great Lakes Dortmunder. I took a chance on this beer and it didn't turn out how I thought it would, oh well you can't win them all, better luck next time Thirsty Dog."

"In Cleveland and tried the Labrador from Thirsty Dog. The beer poured clear golden color with some white foamish head that left some lace. The smell is a bit of strong yeast, some malts. The taste is typical of most Dortmunders, some fruit, grassy hops. The mouthfeel is light in body and good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer and can be sessioned easily."

"One hell of a yellow lager that competes with GLBC Dortmunder Gold."
"O: Pretty accurate to style. Quite quaffable."
""

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and malts. Taste is crisp, grains, some malts, a tad sweet, just a touch of hops. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and pretty good beer."
"D: It goes down easily, and it quite quaffable. I like it."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer of the style. It was both easy drinking and flavorful and pretty enjoyable overall."
"O: Overall a very easy, drinkable beer, would have more of these ... Thirst Dog. Mmmm"
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of earthy malt, slight citrus hops, and hint of dough. Fits the style of a Dortmunder / Export Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of dough, slight citrus hops, and hint of earthy malt. Overall, poor appearance, but good aroma, blend, and body."
"Really nice and tight looking as white head of maybe an inch and a half came up and settled down, fading slightly but holding its own. Light grains and bready malt notes really pulling through here. Some smattering of hops in there but again nothing really pushing that way, this was a well rounded, and very straight forward lager. As I take the first sip, crisp, clean flavor rolls across the taste buds. Really very well put together. Earthy, nice touches of grain and smooth, mellow caramel notes infiltrate as it warms. Light banana and clove maybe then coming through. I am very pleased here"
"Overall I like this lager it has a very good flavor and is almost in the IPA territory with the ABV. Smooth."
"An easy drinking, pleasant beer, one which you'll enjoy, but also one which, you'll frankly find rather forgettable. A serviceable, yeoman-like brew."
"Overall: A slightly hoppy very drinkable lager. Worthy of another purchase"
"O- This beer tastes like if Anchor Steam and Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold had a baby. This is very nice Dortmunder style lager from Thirsty Dog, I actually prefer this one to Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold, a little more complex."
"Taste is also bready, with some definite grains as well. Nice carbonation. The grains are prominent, probably typical for a lager which I just don't have that much, but this is a nice surprise, good substantive beer, pretty solid, would buy again."
"This was a nice refreshing lager, more flavor than expected from this style. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Hey this is a golden hazy lager.It smells sweet and fruity,has a very nice aroma.Next up as far as taste is considered I wish would have bought a six pack instead of a single.O yeah taste really good with hints of bubblegum,fruity sweetness and not really too hopp driven.THis beer is a very smooth and refreshing brew. look foward to buying more.I couldn't tell the abv was 6.0, but its nice to know."
"This beer pours a clear, gold color with thin head, no lace. The aroma has faint hints of dough and pine. It's flavor is grassy with a bit of citrus with a dry crisp finish. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Thirsty Dog Labrador Lager is an average beer, sessionable and refreshing. Slightly recommended."
"D: The beer comes of as slightly too sweet and with an almost cloying finish that really ruins the drinkability. Also, the lower than desired carbonation hurts drinkability."
"This has a glimmering golden color and a lacing that most beers would be jealous of. This beer has a malty nose and a hint of fruit and herbs from the hops. Smooth lagers with a clean medium body win us over ... this is one of those. It's malty, but mostly on the dry side. The hops are well rounded with a sizable bitterness and a drawn out, somewhat subtle flavor. This beer is bready and yeasty with some alcohol in the finish. A very impressive lager. It stands bigger and more complex than expected."
"D - Very drinkable and balanced, would go well with almost anything."
"D- A nice American take on the style. Nice."
"Update: Fresh variety pack sample of this beer increased freshness equates to increased enjoyment. Pours a bright golden hue with a slightly hazed body maybe a bit of yeast left unfiltered it's like a Dortmunder/kellerbier. Aromatics offer up a liquid bread combination of malts and floral hops, I'm a fan for sure. 6% abv well hidden for a golden lager, ample hops at 22 IBUs fits the style guidelines without any issues. I love the bright white flowing head, leaves even layered lines of speckled textured lacing. Each gulp takes you into a very refreshing crisp combination of rich layered biscuit malts, a bit of honey sweetness balanced with herbal grassy German hops, not too pungent or bitter but very fresh and balanced which is key in this style of lager. Mouthfeel overall is as pleasant as it gets, and as hot as it was working outside today the beer tastes that much better. Ample natural feeling carbonation crisp inviting finish makes you want to take the next sip that much faster. Overall a highly drinkable skillfully brewed, and meant to be enjoyed in number go seek some out if your in Ohio or some of the limited distribution of this brewery."
"from Half Time cooler,Pours mid-yellow body with some white foamish head. Aroma is a bit of strong yeast, some malts. Middling mouthfeel. Tastes so-so,minerally, somewhat apple,grassy hops though 20 IBU, not overally drinkable.You have to be in the mood for this, maybe that's not having a beer all week and it's hot."
"A very indifferent beer. Not bad, not great, just middle of the road. Reasonably drinkable."
"The malt profile and refreshing flavor is ideal for a hot summer day. I could enjoy this one any time of the year. It is good to see more breweries producing this style."
"In the end i love the style and love the beer its great for a light offering. And even better for a lager. I recommend trying this for a great lighter microbrew."
"One of the better ""pale"" lagers I've had."
"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass pours a crisp, very bubbly orange with a decent eggshell head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp sweet malts with a Worther's Original like caramel scent to it. The taste is an overabundance of sweet malts, not quite cloying, but almost. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation, but the sweetness gets in the way. This is one that smell's WAY better than it tastes, not anything I would have again."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"Serving type: 12 Fl. oz. bottle"
"(d) I could drink pint after pint of this stuff. Great with food, great just by itself. Overall one of my favorite lagers, handsdown! (4.5/5)"
"D- Super easy to drink and refreshing."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent milder beer to drink for a while, but there are other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"that is lower in abv."
"D: Good. Can drink a bunch of these, low ABV, enjoyable taste."
"Pours a rich, deep golden hue with a smallish off-white head. Smell is all sweet malts. First taste is like the smell - bready and sugary - but has a subtle toastiness, almost nutty, with a nice dash of hops for the bitter finish. Great feel, excellent combination of flavors without being over-the-top. I would gladly drink more than a few of these."
"Picked up a single from Abe's Cold Beer. Pours a clear gold amber with a short white head that leaves a bit of lacing. The malt is disappointingly plain with a mild bready cake taste and aroma. The hops do a little better and bring both floral citrus and a little grassy herb forward and long into the aftertaste. Smooth and drinkable, but unremarkable aside from some pleasant hop character."
"Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is the best dortmunder that has ever entered my glass. Labrador Lager isn't quite that good, but it's a surprisingly well-brewed version that I'll definitely look for again. This is a great all-rounder that is delicious solo and should accompany most foods with ridiculous ease."
"Definately not my favorite Dortmundner. I've only tried three so far, but the other two I've had blow this one away. (Great Lakes and Two Brothers)"
"Highly carbonated, giving it a crisp mouthfeel. I thought I had smelled the telltale signs of adjuncts. Here, I think the taste confirms it. Overall, a very dry beer. There's some bittering hop flavor in the aftertaste."
"Notes: The second less than stellar beer out of Thirsty Dog (had their Barktoberfest recently). These were the first two Thirsty Dog beers that did not really impress me. I found there Cerebrus 10 and Siberian Night to be exemplary."
"This is a very crafty craft brew here. Distinguished looking, tasting. I just hope we can get this year-round. It would be nice is the night clubs I frequent around here would start selling it. Actually, that would be bad - I would drink too much."
"D- I could definitely knock over a 1/6 barrel of this stuff in a couple days. A Great offering from the boys in akrowdy. It's an agreeable beer for the lighter beer drinkers with enough flavor and complexity to please the real beer drinkers."
"Overall, a very solid offering from Thirsty Dog. Its not in the same league as something like Dortmunder Gold, but drinks very well and is worth the checking out. Recommended."
