"Can. A standard and good tasting swedish pilsner. Nice flavour that is dominated by malt and soft bitterness"

"Another ""fun fact"": This is the second most sold beer in Sweden, after Sofiero Original - Sofiero is one of the cheapest ones at Systembolaget, while Mariestads is considered ""premium"" as it costs 5 SEK extra (and I actually understand why)."
"would not buy it again"
"Drinkability: Well, unlike most lagers, this beer doesn't strike me as particularly sessionable since it ends up unpleasant rather than boring and generic. So while the malt/hops balance is on point, Spendrups managed to make this beer completely unbearable, especially for Dortmunder fans such as myself. Unremarkable and i'm being nice."
"D: Low. To be avoided. Once in the IKEA in the mood for a beer, go to the Old Gold (also from Spendrups Bryggeri) witch is at least, decent."
"D-Better than what I expected. I'm not going to buy a 6-pack, but I'd drink it again."
"The carbonation is good and the beer quench your thirst rather well."
"Had a bottle of this at the Lund, Sweden train station cafe. Poured with a big, foamy, frothy, almost creamy texture and color head and lace. Color was a very clear, deep, rich, medium amber. Aroma was malty, caramel, and a hint of cinnamon. Flavor was about the same with bitterness in the finish but sweet overall. Body was average. Nevertheless not a lot going on and basically forgettable."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is slightly sweet with malt, surprisingly good for a label that has ""export"" on it. 58 SEK ~ $9.74 Villa Godtheim Restaurant Stockholm. From my notes - 7/7/2008."
"the beer is amazingly shitty. but it was all they had on the train. nothing else i can say about it. I should've assumed when something is labelled ""export"" it translates to ""rubbish""."
"A lager with some more diacetyl than many others... I cannot really see why this one is selling so much. It might be the lavish marketing, as this is the premium brand from Spendrups."
"Comes on pallate somewhat malty. A reminder of what malt is really makes this beer bad. Sweet sugary hops are in there as well with some carbonation and some alcohol."
