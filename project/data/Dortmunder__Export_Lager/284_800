4.09,20.6,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"The previous beer made me a little nervous with its propensity to foam up and overflow, so I went with a more gentle pour on this one. It was still slightly foamy, perhaps due to heat and humidity, but it was under CANtrol all the same. Two fingers of rocky, bone-white head were the result and I watched it as it slowly bubbled and popped its way out of existence. Color was a gorgeous golden-yellow and I could only laugh as Croesus, Mammon and King Midas fought for a drop. Nose was very honey-like, very much like a clean, unadulterated lager. From a CAN?!? I am already a fan. I CANnot tell you how many AALs in a CAN that I have been subhected to and it is never pleasant. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and I caught a grassy hoppiness that made me think of a GER Pils, but I will buy Dortmunder. Finish was pretty dry, a real gem on this hot, humid day. I really liked the grassy finish and might CANsider it for a lawnmower beer CANdidate.","woodychandler","Jul 21, 2013"

I mean they solidly thump the macros and a lot of the European import Lagers, but aren't quite as good as local craft offerings. I'd really like to see Sapporo bring some of their other brews over to brew locally. Not sure how they could market it, but I've been a fan.","TheHammer","May 25, 2012"

3.53,4.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Yebisu is one of my favorite canned beers to drink simply because the malty flavor carries through even packaged in such a medium. Often, canned beers lose so much of their magic that is normally found in bottles or especially via tap (take Guinness as a perfect example). However, as far as canned beer goes, Yebisu is amazing. Full of malt, wheat-flavored with a bit of citrus in the aftertaste, this beer goes particularly well with things like Korean BBQ or curry with some spice. I often pour it into a glass, and any pilsner or tulip style glass will do, depending on how much head you want on it. The only negative side to this canned version that does not bother me when it comes from the tap is the excess gas in the beer that translates to some nasty burps. I've had Yebisu in all forms (even from the brewery in Ebisu, Tokyo), and this only seems to happen when I drink it from the can. However, since that does affect my overall image of the beer, I do have to stick with this ranking for now. If you have a chance to have it from the tap, I would recommend it, as it easily would rank a 4+.","shigg85","Feb 05, 2012"

I have to say, it's not the most pleasant-tasting beer I've ever drunk, slightly too sour for my taste, not much of an aftertaste and still not as flavoursome as I like.

I don't mean to go on a RANT here, but STOUT DRAFT is confusing!!","beerguy101","Oct 05, 2003"
2.85,-15.9,2.5,2.5,3,2,3.5,"As mentioned, this has a little more flavor that its brethren, but this is a pretty unremarkable beer. The flavor was crisp, clean, and quite drinkable. I would probably go for this if I see it in a Japanese restaurant.","Beastdog75","Sep 28, 2003"
3.42,0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"White 2 cm head on a yellow gold body. Leafy malty aroma. Reminds me of a restina, firm lasting bitterness, but more than the average Japanese lager. A little husky, rich flavor. Significantly different from the common Japanese swill, but nothing amazing.","Naerhu","Sep 21, 2003"
3.44,1.5,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This lager poured a clear, golden yellow color with thick, creamy, white foam that had good staying power and left a coating on the glass. The smell was faint and malty. The taste was light: slightly sweet malt, hints of hops (floral and bitter) in the background. The mouthfeel was clean and smooth with medium-light body and medium carbonation. The aftertaste was mildly hoppy. This was an easy-drinking lager on tap.","UncleJimbo","Jun 20, 2003"
3.05,-10,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Poured a deep yelow color with minimal head,smel of pretty much nothing maybe a tad of sweetness.Taste was malty and maybe some apple tartness but pretty weak in the flavor department,highly carbonated and a little thin on the mouth.Was expecting more not to impressed with this.","oberon","May 29, 2003"
2.45,-27.7,2,2,2.5,2.5,3,"Honey colored, slightly cloudy, hardly any head or flavor really. Wasn't too bad once it warmed up a little. I like Japanese beer but this one is not a quality brew. Served it's purpose which was to wash down some Japanese food. I can't say enough enough about this beer for the required 250 characters.","BierReise","Apr 29, 2003"
3.08,-9.1,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Not bad but not special in any way, other than being an all malt Japanese macro brew.","TXHops","Mar 27, 2003"
2.91,-14.2,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a medium golden color with a bubbly white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is stale grains and a bit of cooked corn. Taste is a bit of sweet malts up front followed by some notes of wet hay and musty grains. Some mildly bitter hops are present in the end leading to a dry finish. Better than many other Asian beers Ive had, its still no better than an average brew.","Morris729","Mar 25, 2003"
2.82,-16.8,4,2,3,3,3,"Thick white head, leaves a lot of lace, golden color. Nose is clearly skunky and not stout-like. Indeed the label has stout draft but this is a whole new definition of stout - not dark nor medium/heavy bodied. Label is veeery misleading and won't be purchased again even at $2,75 for 16oz.","jdhilt","Mar 02, 2003"
3.41,0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I smell muchu roastiu nutsu, along with proof of lager. The taste starts off with candy giving way to a sourish, nutty middle. The finish is tangy and slightly sour. This is actually pretty darn good.","kbub6f","Mar 02, 2003"
3.46,2.1,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Yebisu Stout Draft: Served from a fairly fancy sixteen-ounce bottle. Stout draft? No, not Guinness, but rather a darkish gold color under a very impressive thick white foamy head. Left some fairly thick lacing down the side as well. The aroma is fairly impressive, some skunk, some malts. The taste is impressive, and hard to compare to other beers. I can taste somewhat of a pronounced floral/vegetable taste, which follows up closely with bready malts. At the end, it is fairly clean, with a tiny bit of hops.","jackndan","Feb 19, 2003"
4.47,31.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The 1 Pint bottle has particulates in it leading me to believe it to have some bottle conditioning. Pours golden with just a hint of amber to the color. The Head is thick and luxurious settling quickly to a fine lace on the glass with the faintest hint of tan color. The nose is reminiscent of very fresh and bitter hops. The nose released from the head is quite good. The 1st sip is malty and sweet. This is quite good. Malt with hops and a distinctive bitter aftertaste. Well balanced beer though the finish builds to a powerful bitter. But I like Bitter so Hoo Rahhh! Mouthfeel is like liquid silk. Verrrrry smooooooth beer. I am so happy I tried this one. Not quite a 5 but damn close - especially for an Asian beer.","AtrumAnimus","Feb 14, 2003"
3.7,9.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The name itself is quite a misnomer, calling it a stout, when it's anything but that. It's mildly spritzy, almost fruity, and delivers a heck of a punch in the aftertaste department. It's not a beer that I'm wild about simply drinking on its own, but as an accompaniment with some great food, this beer is definitely a winner.","49degrees","Jan 01, 2003"
2.06,-39.2,3,2,2,2,2,"The average pour a golden yellow, the head modest in size, bright white, frothy, the lace a fine sheet to coat the glass. Nose is all malt, lightly sweet, crisp and clean. Sweet malt start, top cadaverous, finish is strikingly acidic, hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste.","Gusler","Dec 30, 2002"
3.8,12.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Medium golden color with a decent snow-white head and spectacular clouds of rising bubbles, lots of thick, sticky lace. Nice aroma of sweet malts, grain, and hops. Taste begins with grain flavors and a sting of carbonation, mild bitterness and dry characteristic appear midway through. Slight sweetness and a bit of metallic bitterness bring the taste to a close. An eminently refreshing and drinkable beer.","Pegasus","Nov 20, 2002"
2.7,-20.4,3,3,2.5,2,3,"Anyway, this is definitely the best Asian beer I have come across so far, but still not a great brew. Still, I think Sapporo may be on to something. Pours a very orange color with a medium off-white head. Medium sweet malt aroma. Lightly sweet malt flavor and medium effervescence. There was some hops in the finish but everything seemed understated about this beer. Nothing really stood out, but if I am in Japan I will order this before a Sapporo or Kirin.","Dogbrick","Nov 13, 2002"
3.85,13.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a golden straw color with a decent white head that sinks quickly and lots of yeasties floating around as I didn't know the beer was bottle conditioned when I was pouring it.  Slightly sweet malt smell with a husky grain quality to it.  The beer has a very dry and grainy start to it that makes it rather refreshing and quenching.  The brew retains this excellent dryness until a short and sweet malt burst at the end comes through.  It is then back to the dryness for the slight lingering finish however.  The graininess provides a very dry and crisp mouthfeel which makes the brew very refreshing and very drinkable.  I can imagine that this would go excellent with sushi and other japanese foods.","Murph","Oct 01, 2002"
3.69,8.8,3,4,4,3.5,3,"The "all-malt" on the label is a misnomer to a true malt lover. Guess yebisu is a malty beer compared to other to japanese zymurgical efforts.. this beer is dry, with a light malty mouth taste and feel. The hops too provide a mild aftertaste to the palate. All in all, a decent refreshing flavor. Served ice cold, this light beer could be a thirst quencher.","stoutman","Sep 28, 2002"
3.8,12.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is by far the best beer I've had in its style... dry, as you would expect... malty, and refreshing.  Deep gold, with a very thin head... malty smell and flavor, with a balancing hop bitterness.  Thin to medium mouthfeel, and highly carbonated.  There just might be no better compliment to a good sushi dinner.","zerk","Sep 26, 2002"
3.6,6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Like everyone else, I had this at a Japanese restaurant last night.  It was definately an above average lager.  What struck me was how different (in a good way) a mass-produced lager can be without the use of adjuncts.  Hoppier, maltier, creamier than any US macro.  Enjoyable.","pbrian","Aug 29, 2002"
3.85,13.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I didn't even know this beer existed until last night at a sushi restaurant.  The label caught my eye:  "all malt" making it unusual for Japanese beer.  I tried it and was very pleasantly surprised. It's darker in color than other Japanese lagers.  The hop aroma is actually fairly strong and the malt smell is there too.  It's has a pleasantly sweet taste and is not as dry as other Japanese beers.  This is a surprisingly good beer.  Seek it out next time you're out for sushi.","mickeymac","Aug 18, 2002"
