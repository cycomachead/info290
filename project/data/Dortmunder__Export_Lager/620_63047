3.93,14.9,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours clear golden beer with normal 2-finger white head. Typical german nose: grainy, bready, semi-sweet with herbal hops. Taste is rather roundish, malty with noble hop bitter finish, some elusive tartness. Full-bodied, well carbonated. Very positive representative of deutsch export lagers.","Dentist666","Sep 27, 2012"

3.65,6.7,3,3,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Don't let the bright colour and clarity fool you - this is no light lager. Good Dortmunders, which certainly describes this, have a particular gratification that few other pale lagers (save pilsners) can usually offer. It's a style that requires no imagination - it's simply refreshing, delicious beer - and therein lies its strength. This reminded me of how good the Germans have it - we'd all be so lucky to have our everyday beer be this good.","biegaman","Apr 11, 2012"
3.23,-5.6,3.5,3,3.5,2,3.5,"Final Grade: 3.23, a high C+. HÃ¼ttenbier is a passable Dortmunder, but by no means is it a particularly good one. It tastes ok, and is drinkable - but I cannot find any reasons to offer any more praise than that. DAB is cheaper, better, and available everywhere, so there is just no reason to go out of your way for this stuff. I'd drink this if it were being offered, but it's not something I'd bother to buy again. In a slightly more positive vein... if you see this for a decent price, and are in the mood for a thirst-quenching German lager, this isn't a bad choice, but I wouldn't bother seeking it out.","thehyperduck","Dec 07, 2011"

3,-12.3,3,3,3,3,3,"A friend brought this back from Munich airport. Thanks, Mike! A clear, golden beer with a minimal, white head. Malty-sweet nose with a fine fruityness. Malty-sweet flavor, yet it feels quite dry, with fruityness and a fine bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. Slightly bitter finish. A decent beer without flaws, but a little boring.","chickenflea","Beers"
